Subject: [sfraves] RR: Weekend Review...

Good lord - what a weekend.

Started off by rolling down with Mr. Jonas R to Bam's company Halloween 
Party @ Suede where we both spun (alongside Mr.Redstickman, Bam & Nick 
Nyquil, etc.). It was really funny jamming nuskool & tech-funk to a rack of 
little hip-hop loving folks. No less than 10 times I was asked if I had any 
hip-hop. Um, obviously NOT?!!? Whatever - still had a ton of fun and got a 
nice alcoholic buzz on.

Good friends of mine from the DC area who moved to Seattle flew down Friday 
night so's we could all go to Otherworld on Saturday for what turned out to 
be an epic party.

On to the Otherworld...we rolled in @ 10, and other than the delay in 
getting the party going - the party went off like gangbusters. The place was 
packed well into the 5am hour. Music was absolutely off the heezy.

Highlights:
Finally getting to see Shazbot in action...dude, you RIPPED up that hallway. 
Had people grooving all night long, and the beats were on point. I was mad 
impressed, as were my people - and we all thank you for the cd's! (I still 
want a list of vinyl you played there!!!)

El Juan - good lord. I thought I was pretty much over D&B till hearing this 
guy, but he delivered one of the best sets I have heard in AGES! I don't 
know how this guy is not just HUGE by now. My mission is to get him booked 
out east where the junglist massive (as it were) is still huge...

Sutekh, Praxxis & Minor Minor - I'm putting em altogether since they played 
one after another, and dropped some of the sickest techno I have ever 
witnessed. Hard-hitting, but totally danceable - none of that sparse, cold 
crap here - all bass rumbling, pounding techno beats. I would pay good money 
to see any of these DJ's again - especially Sutekh & Minor Minor who just 
devastated the joint. SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICKNESS!!!

Azeem & Zeph - These guys sound REALLY polished at this point. Some of the 
best hip-hop I have ever heard live. I'm glad the Otherworld crew are really 
supporting this cat, cuz he is destined to blow up sooner or later, and I 
want to be able to catch him as many times as I can in a setting like the OW 
warehouse while I still can. EXCELLENT!

The OW residents - what can I say? They created a rockin' atmosphere, played 
great music, and once again proved what a crew can accomplish when they bust 
their asses. My hat's off once again...

It was nice to meet/see people from SFR too: Li, Terry, Tyler, Osby, Ryan, 
etc. W00t!

Anyhoo - back to work with me....thanks again everyone!!!

Thanks Marco, it was nice meeting you. Thank to you everyone that packed
the hallway over the course of my 2 and a half hour set--even if I

Subject: [sfraves] Halloween set ready to download

Heya All. Here is the set I played at a Halloween
Party:

Some songs in the mix: 

Jerk It
Cowbell
Thrill Her (Halloween and all)
White Lines

Mostly breaks, a few house tracks:

Live - Halloween 2004 http://redirx.com/?gxjn

I converted these older mixes into mp3 format from
ogg.

A Tribute to Bob Marley http://redirx.com/?gxjb
Logical Progression http://redirx.com/?gxj5
Another 2 A.M. http://redirx.com/?gxjb

I hope you enjoy the music =)

Matt 
AKA DJ Dub

OtherWorld just keeps outdoing itself. So much thought and effort into the
decorations and setup. 4 rooms of sound and such a diverse lineup. I heard
it all genre wise. I can't say I really heard anything bad either. Doing
sound for a room that was 90% live PA was interesting. Thanks to one of the
performers things went a lot better. It's nice when everyone playing works
together to sort out their problems. Carrying 4 stacks of sound to the
overflow space upstairs is not something I want to do again. Hell, we have
to go their tonight and tear it all down and load up the van again. Ugh. I
have to say that over all the party was a blast and it felt like it went
forever. It was a chill night for me. No climbing walls. No trying to get
into the power panel. I think I wandered so much that night that I must have
walked over 5 miles. Really good night of techno. I'm not a big fan of it,
but what I heard that night was all consistantly good. It was great to see
so many people really dancing and into the party. I'd say they easily had
500 people in there that night. When it was the peak hour it was chaos. I
love that. I love when all the rooms and hallways are just jammed with
people. So much more exciting. I loved the trees with the hands reaching out
in the main room. Those were cool. Oh and the stuffed animal hallway. That
was funny shit. =)

Good to see a lot of familiar faces that night. =)

I didn't get to go to this what sounds like wicked event!! But I did want to 
chime in on the minor,minor comment. He was one of my first techno 
influences way back in the day and got me buying techno. If you think 
minor,minor is dope.. Someone should be old school techno Master Trent. He 
use to play tech at all the harmony parties back in like 93 or so.

aww memories of harmony parties at brookdale, camp swig etc...

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Homeland Security Agents Visit Toy Store


Oct 28, 5:20 PM (ET)

ST. HELENS, Ore. (AP) - So far as she knows, Pufferbelly Toys owner 
Stephanie Cox hasn't been passing any state secrets to sinister foreign 
governments, or violating obscure clauses in the Patriot Act.

So she was taken aback by a mysterious phone call from the U.S. Department 
of Homeland Security to her small store in this quiet Columbia River town 
just north of Portland.

"I was shaking in my shoes," Cox said of the September phone call. "My 
first thought was the government can shut your business down on a whim, in 
my opinion. If I'm closed even for a day that would cause undue stress."

When the two agents arrived at the store, the lead agent asked Cox whether 
she carried a toy called the Magic Cube, which he said was an illegal copy 
of the Rubik's Cube, one of the most popular toys of all time.

He told her to remove the Magic Cube from her shelves, and he watched to 
make sure she complied.

After the agents left, Cox called the manufacturer of the Magic Cube, the 
Toysmith Group, which is based in Auburn, Wash. A representative told her 
that Rubik's Cube patent had expired, and the Magic Cube did not infringe 
on the rival toy's trademark.

Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said 
agents went to Pufferbelly based on a trademark infringement complaint 
filed in the agency's intellectual property rights center in Washington, D.C.

"One of the things that our agency's responsible for doing is protecting 
the integrity of the economy and our nation's financial systems and 
obviously trademark infringement does have significant economic 
implications," she said.

Six weeks after her brush with Homeland Security, Cox told The Oregonian 
she is still bewildered by the experience.

"Aren't there any terrorists out there?" she said.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Conversations with voters

	These snippets of conversations with voters from an activist urging 
people to "end the war in Iraq" while passing out fliers for 
Libertarian presidential candidate Michael Badnarik:

A lady said: "I'm with you. I'm voting for Kerry."
Me: "Kerry will expand the war."
Lady: "Kerry will end the war."
Me: "That's not what he said."
Lady: "Do you believe everything you hear?"

	Vote for my candidate because he's lying. What can one say to a 
response like that?

Another voter said: "Who's this guy?"
Me: "He's Michael Badnarik."
Voter: "I don't know who he is."
Me: "Well, read about him here."
Voter: "It's very hard to change."

	Yes, we've noticed. That's what we're here to help with.   8)   Vote 
Libertarian and win a free country!

Peace, love & liberty,
					<<< Starchild >>>

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: HELP!

So my lame beast of a car finally died on me for once and for all...

Does anyone out there in SFRaver land own a vehicle that they need to get 
rid of on the cheap? Something that will actually run with little to no 
repair work and doesn't cost an arm and a leg? (Tall Order I know, but hey - 
I need to budget!)

Anyone? Chance to make some $$ people!!!

Marco

not too surprising ....

Let's send this to a lot of Republicans, since Badnarik is expected to siphon 
votes away from Bush. 

(p.s. to Starchild: I met a guy on Bart a couple weeks who was carrying a 
sign with your name on it. He said he had just met you and said you were a cool 
guy, and that he was definitely going to vote for you for school board.)

Reward yourself:

$2 Drafts
$3 Margaritas

Cast your ballot, grab some dinner, then come watch the returns come in.
No matter how it goes, this night will call for drinking.

Drum and Bass Tuesdays in Downtown Oakland

Yeah, you heard me. D&B in the 510, huge upstairs club with a wooden
dance floor, pool table, stage and a patio so you can drink and smoke at
the same time. Easy parking, 2 blocks from BART (last train to SF leaves
at 12:48am), and no neighbors to bitch about how fucking loud we are!

YEa - it's pretty  fucking sad too.

If the idiots in Florida wouldn't have voted Nader (i.e. voted Bush by
proxxy), Kerry woulda taken it by landslide.

Fucking sad.

     Bush is ahead 210 to 199 in the electoral polls at this hour of 8:16pm 
pacific standard time, on Tuesday night, but he hasn't won any states he wasn't 
already predicted to win except for maybe Arkansas. Kerry a.k.a. the 
"comeback kid" is sitting pretty just like the Boston Redsox were when they were down 
3-0 against the Yankees. Only a liberal team from Massachusetts could pull 
that off...
     Also the NFL states that when the Redskins of Washington DC lose the 
week of the election the incumbent president also loses. Superstitious as it may 
be, good signs for Kerry. - "keep bouncing"

The last I checked (last night) nNader had pulled enough votes in Fla to 
give Kerry the electoral college votes - as we now know - it was enough to 
give the votes to Dubya.

*sigh*

I guess I'm not surprised. Most of the country is comprised of complete 
idiots.

it's almost 8 in the morning, the day after the election, and it ain't over 
yet!  CNN shows Bush with 254 electoral votes and Kerry 252. 

Something seems fishy. The turnout was 7 million more than last time, and a 
larger turnout normally skews the results more toward the Demos. Earlier in the 
day, according to CNN commentators, Republicans seemed depressed that Bush 
seemed headed toward defeat. Exit polls indicated that Kerry would win handily, 
almost a landslide. 

Through it all, Bush wore a smirk -- just like he did in the last election, 
when somehow he "knew" he would win Florida. 

It feels like his friends at Diebold were tweaking the results so he would 
just barely win the key states. After all, the head of Diebold promised him a 
victory, didn't he? That's what someone told me. 

To me it's just inconceivable that Kerry could do worse than Gore. With 
Bush's terrible performance in office, with much more of a buzz about Kerry than 
there was with Gore, with Michael Moore and Al Franken and everyone else 
pointing out Bush's failures ... how could Bush possibly win?  

Do we want to live in a country where the majority of the people would vote 
for someone like that? It's really depressing. I'm so disappointed in the 
people of this country. 

Who wants to start an SF Raves "cell" in Vancouver?  ;)   (getting out my ski 
jacket)

Yup... rigged from the start.

I'm actually thinking in more along the lines of Tokyo, myself; 
Vancouver being a bit too close to this benighted country for comfort,  
It's clear to me now, that in the era of Diebold, voting is a pointless 
exercise.  So what's left, except to figure out some way to leave?

Remember, as bad as the last four years have been, it's going to be a 
hundred times WORSE from now on.  The only moderating influence on the 
SOBs, the need to seek re-election, is now gone; leaving them not the 
slightest reason NOT to grind the people of this country under their 
heel.  Look for expanded and extended versions of the, PATRIOT act, 
rave act, DMCA, TIPS, Carnivore, etc.  Look for protest to be outlawed, 
except for their "free speech zones".  Look for media that disagrees to 
be marginalized by the FCC, and forced off the air, as with Howard 
Stern's departure to satellite radio.

I wonder how long he'll wait before he reinstates the draft?


cya,
john

What it really is - is sad. I mean, if more than 17% of 18 - 29 y/o's had 
voted, Kerry woulda swept it - easily. But of course that didn't happen. 
Then you have the 3rd party voters whose votes woulda counted enough to oust 
Bush - and that didn't happen.

Of course I'm sure it didn't hurt that Dubya's brother runs the most 
decisive "swing" vote state. (gee that wasn't rigged again, now was it?).

BLAH.

I'm off to check into what I need to do to move to Canada.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] :(

I've been saying this for days... and while it may seem ridiculous,
it's all very possible in theory.

I was thinking to myself last night while I sat at the laundrymat,
glued to the TV. If we assume that 50% of Californians are democratic,
what percentage of those people would support the idea of California
claiming independence?

We generate 1/3 of the nation's money. We could easily operate as an
independent country. We have the most fertile lands, the most
open-minded citizens, the best technology.

The other option is organizing a militia (liberals with firearms
unite!) and just starting a civil war. But I think Bush would like
that too much.

I'm nominating myself for President of California!

Well call Arnold.

He knows damn well the Congress will never get the 2/3 majority it
needs to pass the constitutional amendment that allow him to become
president. I'm sure he'll be all for having his own country.

The bigger problem is where Pacifica gonna get its military? since
Californians are so damn empathetic. You know US forces will invade as
soon as California sucede from the Union.

That really is the rub now isn't it? Americans have a rich history of 
"liberating" land from people - what's to say they wouldn't just roll on in 
and snatch us back up anyway?

(Ventura, CA)  Participant Access Code: 20041103

listserve, respond to this email and you will be added.

Much will happen these next days and it will be important to stay connected
and show the scope of people power in our nation.  Make sure to keep in
contact by sending up reports of how your events worked out.  Photos and

November 3: Beyond Voting Core Messages and Talking Points
Prepared  for beyondvoting.org
Nov 3 2004

Tips:
1) Be calm, and passionate. Speak from your heart and your own experience.
2) Its not about the question they ask. It's about creating a real
democracy
3) Everything is on-the-record.

Core Messages

       We're here to defend the rights of everyone to vote and participate in
democracy--to have their vote counted and to have real choices and real
power to make the decisions that affect our world and our lives.

       Voting is just the first step, and today is just the beginning!
There is
so much more to Democracy than voting on Nov 2­that's why we're going
beyond voting on Nov 3 to demonstrate what real democracy looks like.

       Some of the most important issues facing our country and our lives 
are not
being addressed by the 2 candidates, and we are taking to the streets to
demand real social change in America:

       Nov 2 we went to the polls Nov 3 we are going to the streets. We stand
united on the day after the election for peace, democracy and global
justice, and united against an empire agenda of aggression abroad and
repression at home.



What is "Beyond Voting"?
Beyond Voting is a decentralized grassroots effort to demonstrate what real
democracy looks like in cities and towns all over the country the day after
the election. Today there are over 30 groups around the country doing what
we are doing here today­gathering together as neighbors and working
together for change beyond Nov 2, because getting rid of Bush is just the
beginning of the fight to take our democracy back.

Because the crisis of our democracy didn't start yesterday and it won't end
tomorrow. Beyond Voting is part of the history of grassroots struggle, for
suffrage, for civil rights, for the environment­the history of people
working together at the grassroots level to make democracy happen.


Isn't it undemocratic to be protesting the outcome of an election?
We're demonstrating for a real democracy.  There's more to democracy than
just a once a year choice between 2 rich white guys who have many of the
same opinions.  We're also highlighting the deep flaws in our electoral
process ­ from Big Money donors buying the candidates, to rampant voter
disenfranchisement.  Democracy is more than voting at the ballot box, it is
mobilizing in our communities to have control over the decisions that effect
our lives: our jobs, health care, education, are all under attack by the
Empire agenda of the Bush Administration and we're in the streets to say --
Democracy not empire!

How do you respond when people accuse you of being sore losers?
The real losers today are those who were intimidated and disenfranchised at
the pollsthe 45 million who go without healthcarethe 1000 families who
have lost a loved one in Iraqthe 100,000 Iraqi families who have lost
loved ones in this brutal war

What is the definition of a stolen election?
This election was stolen from millions of black and Latino voters who are
disenfranchised by the system. Lets not forget whose land we are standing
on­this country was stolen in 1492! So when we talk about stolen elections,
let's be clear, that the majority of people don't vote, and millions can't
vote­that this system has historically denied women, African American, and
politically marginalized communities a voice in the process

Isn't America a republic, not a democracy?
America is a country with a dark past of genocide of native peoples, slavery
and the vast majority of people (except rich white men) being denied the
right to vote.  200 years of grassroots movements struggling for justice
have given women, African Americans and others the vote.  However we are
still seeing efforts to prevent people voting and to give them still have
massive disenfranchisement of people trapped in America's growing prison
system. The mobilizations around the country on Nov 3 are part of this
ongoing effort to make America a real democracy by building grassroots
movements for democracy, peace and justice.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

heh.. well while i was traveling around the world for
the better part of this last year, after revealing that
i was in fact american (to which the general response
was that i was one of the most unamerican americans
they had met--thanks!), eventually everyone asked what
i thought of bush and the (then) upcoming elections..

to which my response was, should bush win in november i
am moving out of the country... most people would laugh
and say, well there is no way that he would win again,
right? (i think the world gives americans as a group
too much credit, thinking that we would be smart enough
to realize what a douche bag bush is) i had to point
out that i came from a part of the country that
generally speaking is more educated and progressive
than middle america... and unfortunately a lot of
americans are ignorant and dont take the time to look
for unbiased media and news, therefore they just lap up
the bullshit bush propaganda and take it for honest to
god truth.. 

well, i suppose that if nothing else, bush has made an
honest woman out of me ;) though i cant say that i was
going to stick around even if he had lost.. 

love and hugs and kisses,
tina

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a

itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."

I spent all my free time the last couple of months talking to people in 
"Jesusland."  Deliberately placed myself on lists where Republican and 
other points of view were well represented.  I believed that talking with 
folks who believed the same things I do would be unproductive and wasteful.

I learned quickly that I had to divest myself of the elitism about religion 
that defines the "United States of Canada" or whatever you want to call our 
haven of secularism.  You can blame the Brits for unloading the Puritans on 
us, but fact is their beliefs rule the middle of the country and they rule us.

I thought I would be talking about politics, the problems in Iraq, and 
economic philosophy.  Nope.  Aside from a pervasive fear that these people 
in Jesusland shared of Arab heathens storming their white picket fences -- 
and that fear was palpable -- all we talked about was the Bible.

Now I was trained in prep school by Jesuits and so am well prepared to talk 
Jesus.  I've studied the New Testament in Latin and Greek and am still 
good, I discovered, at doing biblical exegesis.  The only inroads I made 
with these people was by staying on one important message:  Jesus' core 
message was love and compassion.  Actually, though I'm not a Christian 
these days, I'm in agreement with this message and can talk about it with 
passion because love and compassion are core beliefs of mine.

I discovered many Christians who were anguishing about the 100,000 civilian 
deaths in Iraq;  who were conflicted on the issue of war and violence;  and 
were open to my peace and love deal.

Problem with many liberals is that we approach these Christians, many of 
whom are intelligent and very strong believers in Christ's teachings, with 
arrogance:  that is, your beliefs are trash;  we atheists or whatever, are 
cooler than thou;  and you're stupid for believing in this superstitious 
trash.

Any political inroads in Jesusland must be accompanied by creative, and I 
believe, proper use of the New Testament.

Finally, anything can happen in the next four years.  When Nixon was 
elected for a second term I was in despair, as I am now.  But....Watergate 
came along.  This war in Iraq is going south fast as is the economy in the 
long run under the monkey who spends and cuts taxes.  There will be a 
battle on the right on these very issues and there will be hell to pay 
whoever won this election.  Believe in serendipity, 'cause it rules the 
universe.

And fight on.  I will.  I think Bush in all his hubris in going down hard 
before the end of his term, and I intend to do everything I can to 
facilitate this.

Leave the country.  Fuck no.  It's MY country too and I'm not one to be 
defeated.  "Hasta la victoria siempre!"

Love,

Apollo

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

I do not have a link to anything written about this
but I started going out way before this music was
mainstream, i.e. the first time I heard house/acid
house/techno whatever first played in a public place
was back in '94 on Height. 

In my underground career, mixed tapes seem to appear
in the 80's. Mostly DJ's just making tapes for thier
friends and clubs recording to hand out free or to
sell as party memories. These tapes got duped and
given to friends of friends. Not sure the exact year
but in the late 80's early 90's DJ's were selling
tapes for a number of reasons. 
1. to learn new records
2. to make money to buy more records
3. to get thier name out
4. give to friend
5. demo's for gigs. 

I am sure this goes back to the disco days some how
but I just missed that era.

Hope this helps. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. 
Maybe I should write an article on this. Let me know
if you need more specific info and I will find it for
you.

=)

That's what sucks though! Rather than using facts, logic and reason, we
have to relate every issue to a book written thousands of years ago.
Religion exists everywhere on this planet, but it seems that only in
America (and ironically, the fundamentalist Middle East) are the
majority of people simply unwilling to frame any issue outside the
context of their faith.

I only wish I had the opportunity to explain to a Christian
fundamentalist how my disbelief in God is only *confirmed* by the 4
years running up to last night's election: seriously, what God would
allow somebody like George Bush to become president in the first place,
let alone get re-elected after what he's done thus far? I think anyone
who interprets the Bible literally should take a good, hard look at all
of Bush's policies (and the actions of the Republicans that support
him), then re-evaluate their support for a man that wages endless
immoral war, cuts social programs for poor Americans while indebting
future generations with huge tax breaks for the rich, and ravages the
environment at the behest of the energy industry.

I just don't understand how gay marriage--something that doesn't hurt
ANYONE, let alone affect ANY of the people who so strongly oppose
it--can be one of the deciding factors when so much more is at stake.
Yet 11 states overwhelmingly voted to ban it, and some even went as far
as banning civil unions and domestic partner benefits. That's fucking
depressing.

I find even serendipity hard to believe in these days. Bush is the
Teflon President; every single one of his mistakes and misdeeds has been
deflected, then more often than not dishonestly projected onto his
opponents and critics. The Republicans, rather than losing seats in
Congress as a result of their bitter partisanship and rancor, gained a
larger majority. Corporate America get richer every day, at the expense
of our middle and lower classes, the environment, and Iraqi citizens.
The media continues to prefer pitting pundits against each other and
calling it "news" instead of reporting the facts against either side.
Karma's going to be a serious BITCH if it ever gets back to these
people.

Me too. I also started visiting conservative blogs a couple of weeks ago
in an attempt to talk to sense into the people that think George Bush is
a "compassionate conservative", or some other such bullshit. I don't
think it's about relating to religion. Most of the time, I've found
reasonable people who are willing to have civil discussions as long as
you show some respect for them. That's what's missing in politics today,
and my hope is that Bush may yet live up to his promise of being a
"uniter" in his second term.

Unfortunately I think the President will point to this election as a
mandate to enact even more radical policies that will divide the
American electorate even further, if that's possible. We can look
forward to more misguided national education reforms; the privatization
of major public services, including Social Security; renewed attacks on
the civil rights of gays; the continued illegal imprisonment and torture
of both American citizens and foreign nationals; the further dismantling
of important regulatory agencies like the EPA, FDA, HHS, and the Labor
Department; and more tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of our
nation's poor.

As much as I'd like to say that none of these things affects me, I
can't. And to any potential voters that sat out this year because you
couldn't decide or just don't care, I implore you: educate yourself.
Listen to NPR or read a newspaper during your morning commute. Learn the
facts about the issues that affect your everyday life and those of your
fellow citizens. Register to vote, and cast your ballot based on those
issues. Voting is what makes our democracy work, and as long as you sit
on the sidelines, your country will continue to elect people without
your interests in mind. Bottom line: you can't complain if you don't
inform yourself and vote your conscience.

Cheers,

the fundamental problem is that it's called 'GAY MARRIAGE'.

why not call it what it is?  how about the "government needs to keep 
the fuck out of my sex life" proposition?

Sample:

Summary of Proposition A:  Should the State have the right to tell its 
citizens whom they may dedicate their lives to or have sexual relations 
with?

need to feel better.

That aside, does anyone know of any demonstrations, peaceful protests... 
anything?

Thank you,
susie

haha so i was watching comedy central and this
commedian said we should stop calling it gay marriage
and call it the male sexual wish fulfillment measure..
she said that by calling it gay marriage the
politicians automatically think of two men, but you
know if they thought it was a lesbian couple and
passing this would mean they would have naked hot
lesbian couples sunbathing and moving into every house
on their street, it would be a constitutional
ammendment! 

i thought it was funny :) 

love and hugs and kisses,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr new map of us

Damn, the guy's a good DJ and well spoken.

*claps*

I'm agreein' 110%

You wanna hear something really sad that happened to me this week? My 
brother and I, arguably the more "left" of the family, got IM's from my 
neice (who is a mere 14) - who was absloutely TERRIFIED because people were 
voting for John Kerry. She was under the impression that if Kerry won, we'd 
all be in concentration camps under the thumb of militant Muslim warlords in 
the next couple of years. Basically, the rhetoric of fear that Bush's 
"America" is cramming down our throats on a consistant basis is starting 
take hold even in the least likely of places. Both my brother and I were 
sickened by this, and heartbroken that our neice (who is otherwise quite 
intelligent) had been bamboozled by this crap. Bush is doing damage in 
places I never thought he could get to. I swear - there has GOT to be SOME 
way of impeaching this asshat before he pulls a "Rome" on our asses and my 
neices fears are realized....

I know - not exactly on topic, but it seems to fit in with todays events.

I didn't make the movie. I just happen to see something in it that will

Truly as a species we're bringing this upon ourselves. It's that simple. 
Mass murder? No - it's not. If a virus gets out like that (which will no

so in some really skewed logic - it's au natural. Change comes with

When people are afraid they often turn to religion, or booze, or 
both:)  Seriously, good political strategy arises from reality, not some 
dreamscape.  It has been said that Liberals can understand everything but 
the people who don't understand them.  I believe that's true and, again, is 
the result of a lack of true compassion.

That was my strategy and it seemed to work on a limited scale (ie, within 
my own outreach experiences).  Put simply, what does the gospel say about 
war, greed and violence.  Bit more complex than that, though.  Take for 
example the phrase:  "....you shall have dominion over the earth."  Many 
conservatives believe this to mean we can screw the environment as much as 
we like.  However, a more correct translation reads:  "...you shall have 
stewardship over the earth."   Thus, one must protect the environment as 
any good steward would.  This was one discussion I had, and I had to go to 
heavy scholarship to deal with this.  Even those who read the New Testament 
literally are going to have trouble reconciling, say, the sermon on the 
mount with the actions of a "Christian" empire flattening the rest of the 
world for it's own benefit.

The whole issue was handled ineptly from the beginning.  The term 
"marriage" should never have been used.  Were I to have created a political 
platform for establishing the legal and other effects of marriage I would 
have called them civil unions, and moved to create legislation that would 
have focused on the needs of straights, as well as, incidentally, gays and 
bisexuals as in the EU.  Most folks these days, I understand, don't have 
marriages but, rather, civil agreements.  Marriage here has massive 
religious connotations.  "Family values" and the rest of it.  A shrewd 
politician understands this and works with it.   Now 'tis a bit late for that.

Things do happen, Shawn.  I feel events in Iraq are going to worsen and 
terrorism will continue to flourish under Bush.  His economic policies are 
under fire from both traditional conservatives (the American Conservative 
endorsed Kerry btw) and the neoliberals.  All gonna' collapse, and it may 
well be a very good thing that a Democrat isn't captain of this currently 
sinking ship.

Ain't no way.  He is a divider and that's just fine.  What mandate does he 
really have?  60% of the electorate voted this time...big deal for 
America.  What the hell do the other 40% think?  And of that 60%, a bit 
over 30% voted for Bush.  That's what we call a landslide here.  A 
"mandate."  The youth vote was a fiction.  Same percentage voted this time 
as in 2000.  Shame.  Here in CA we had about a 50% turnout, lower than 
expected.

What needs to happen is some outreach to the 40% who don't vote, and 
putting some fire under the kids who are just to cynical to get off their 
asses and participate.  I think a draft will take care of the latter:)

Basically, and I see it all around me, folks would prefer to live in denial 
-- some consensus reality.  Well, everything isn't going to be just fine, 
as Bush says, and I guess it will take some great pain all the way around 
to get through the bullshit we surround ourselves with.  That pain is 
coming.  We elected it, and those who were too busy to vote deserve what 
they get, as do those who have succumbed to their fears.  The longer you 
delay dealing with painful reality the worse things become.  Anyone who has 
lived more than twenty years knows that.

In closing, I must say I thought Kerry was the worst choice the democrats 
could have made.  If they really wanted to go for the security mom vote, 
etc., they should have chosen Wesley Clark -- good Democratic, decisive, 
and well capable of dealing with military needs.  Me, I supported Dennis J. 
Kucinich in the beginning.  Kerry is a universe away from Kucinich.  Kerry 
on foreign policy, the war in Iraq, and terrorism mirrors the same "kill 
'em before they kill us" philosophy as Bush.  The Democratic party, to my 
mind, has rendered itself meaningless and without beliefs other than 
imitating the other side to win.  What have you now?  Two parties with 
increasingly similar political philosophies.  No dialectic.  The end of 
democracy as we know it.  Something must change here, or we are lost.

Further, the treatment of third party candidates in this election was 
disgraceful.  Both the Democrats and Republicans are owned by the 
corporations these days and those who really rule the country don't want a 
Nader, Green, or Kucinich ruining this sweet deal.  So we have what we have.

There are, however, winds of change out there and much of that is now 
coursing through DSL lines round the country and world.  There will be 
revolutionary change in the next few years, and it will come from the 70% 
of the American population who didn't vote for Bush.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr new map of us

There are very few seculars who would treat normal, average Christians
indiscriminately. We stypicaly jump all over right-wing Christian
fundamentalists with arrogance because they treat other people with
arrogance with the first place.

The fundamental issue being that a rational secular is naturally
incompatible with a religous zealot. You can't use rationale on these
people because they rely on blind faith.

And to a greater extend, I believe the the average American tends to
hinge on religions more so than many other western cultures because
America is a young country without a clear sense of roots. The
Britishs, Frenchs, Germans, etc., all have centuries of history and
tradtions to protect and honor. Amerian traditions, on the on other
hand, only consist of the concept of freedom and Christianity. Oh and
maybe Thanksgiving and Halloween

And when American pop culture became the global pop culture, .it
stopped being an identifying element for Americans. It pushes the
fundamentalists to hinge tighter onto their religions. This is
particular telling in the fact that while most of western europe has
written religions out of their legislations, Americans are trying to
write them back into it, in the name of protecting traditions.

I think things would be quite different with these people if America
had a few more hundreds years of history and  non-religous traditions.

Personally, I think the better angle to reach the
irrational-but-non-fundy Christian types would be via religious
freedom.

The fundies, obviously, are a lost cause.

Liberals need to understand that many liberals are Christians too, and
it's OK to apply personal faiths in campaigns. Kerry didn't ever
attempt to appear to be a religious person. There was a time when
religion wasn't a partisan issue. We need to take our half of the
Christian card back from the fundies.

The whole gay marriage thing is very simple: the average American
feels that their tradtions are being threatened. Those of us who live
in urban areas don't think twice about gay people because we know gay
people are normal people. But the average mid-western/sothern folks
typically never met a normal gay person in their life.

They feel particularily threatened because in the pastfew  years gays
have made inroads in mainstream entertainment: shows like Will &
Grace, Queer Eye, Queer As Folks, etc. Frankly I think they're hurting
us because they perpetuate stereotypes.

As much as I hate MTV, I thank the Real World for changing young
Americans attitude towards gays. I can't tell you how many teenagers I
talked to who said that their first ever exposure to a normal gay
person is from watching Real World.

Bush and his neocon friends are tearing the Republican party apart.
Those people are squeezing the moderate Republicans to a corner.
There'll be some dramatic changes in the near future, and it'll come
from within the Republican party. It's time for Democrats and
Republican reformists to unite and work hard.

Iraq is all Bush's responsibilty now. If he fucks up, he's gonna go
down in history as the loser. It's only a matter of time.

Not to mention there are a tons of scandals waiting to be exposed. Why
is Bush's Enron connections being buried? His Saudi connections? What
if he's found neglience of the facts that lead to 9/11? What if we
find the smoking gun that prove conclusively that he **knew** there's
no WMD from the get-go and lied about it?

This administration has defered a lot of questions. Now we have
another 4 years to grill them.

Those who don't vote because they don't believe in the system. Because
they think it doesn't matter. And you know damn well they're right.
Presidential elections doesn't matter 99% of the time if you don't
live in a swing state.

Change doesn't come about by casting a single vote in a presidential
election, electing a president means noting if there isn't a channel
for the people to ether candidate once he's elected. We need to change
the system. We need to make the government accountable, we need to
make the media got back to their job to channel public opinions to the
leaders. And we're gonna change the system via untraditional means.

I'd use Creative Commons as an example. We all know damn well that the
copyright laws as they stand only benefit the labels and publishers
and media megacorps, and there's very little the customers and the
artists can do to challenge that. So here comes Creative Commons, it
attempts to create a new media culture that encourage creativity reuse
and respect fair uses, without changing the interpretation of existing
copyright laws (in fact, it relies on existing copyright laws to
function).

The same thing goes for the hippie/anti-war/civil rights movement. It
brought a mass of social and legistrative changes in our system by
actrively pursuing them outside of the system.

Like I always say, if we can't beat somone in a game where they make
all the rules, then beat them with a new game where **we** make all
the rules. Foxnews did just that.

No, we need to stop lying to ourselves that a vote is gonna make a
difference. Getting our ass out there to vote b/w a dolch and a turd
then sit on our ass for fourstraight years isn't gonna change
ANYTHING.

We need to find a way to energize the people to do things b/w
elections: monitor our government, voice our opinions, bring about
social changes, help the less fortunate, etc.

Yeah I think Wesley Clark would have been a much better choice. A much
better candidate for the war on terror, and a likable personality. His
lack of expriences in office can easily be offset by picking up a
veteran in Congress as a running mate.

Exactly the sort of story I'm looking for...

Any more?

Anyone know of disco era DJs circulating mix tapes? 
Lots of people made mix tapes in the seventies (I was
there) but I haven't been able to confirm that early
club DJs used them.

Regards,

Peter

Yes, Peter, I have some information for you on this.  Lots of reel to reel 
recordings made in the seventies and passed about.  Larry Levin made one 
for me when I was an erotic dancer:)  Lots of Bobby V's tapes from the Troc 
in the seventies have now been burned onto CDs, and I understand Barry 
Lederer in NYC and others are doing the same with other early disco 
sets.  I personally have two complete Troc parties on CD.

Not focused on this now, but if you'll remind me tomorrow I'll see what I 
more I can dig up.  I do mention this several times in House Music 101.

Love,

Apollo

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

There are many references to influences of mixtapes in the rave scene from=

conducting this search, while none specifically give a diatribe on just=20
this influence, there are some worthwhile links:

http://www.google.com/search?q=3Dthe+influence+of+mix+tapes+in+the+rave+sce=
ne&btnG=3DSearch&hl=3Den&lr=3D

It might be interesting to conduct research, search opinions and=20
experiences and write an article specific to this "scene".

This may not be exactly what you are looking for, but there are some good=
=20
reads here on how mixtapes influenced the Hip Hop scene, which in many=20
ways also influenced electronic music.

Here are a few references of the history of mixtapes=20
in another genre of music, known for its historical use of mixtapes:

and:
http://www.superswell.com/samplelaw/samplelaw03.html

"...Back in the day, I remember that there weren't many radio stations=20
playing hip-hop. MTV was concerned with Dire Straits. The only way a lot=20
of us were exposed to new artists was by buying mix tapes. If any of you=20
live in a normal urban area, you know that mix tapes still sell as well=20
today as they ever did. Mix tapes, in my opinion, are what carry on the=20
original traditions of dub. Turntablists are hip-hop purists. They are=20
doing exactly what Kool Herc did. Maybe a little differently, but mixing=20
records on two turntables and mixer is as primal an element to hip-hop as=
=20
the beats themselves. Most mix tapes, of course, are banned by copyright.=
=20
We all know that there are at least two kinds of DJs in the world.=20
Category A are radio disc jockeys and people who play CDs at weddings and=
=20
bar mitzvahs. Category B is anyone with two 1200s and something between=20
them. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has been very=20
vague about mix tapes that fall into Category B, what I like to call,=20
"transformative" compilation. Here is a snippet from a recent RIAA press=20
release:

"DJs are not exempt from copyright laws. When radio and nightclub disc=20
jockeys compile a CD or cassette of tracks from a number of unrelated=20
albums to use in their work, each song must be authorized -- even if the=20
CD is made by a legitimate CD manufacturer.

"The law is simple: Duplicating copyrighted sound recordings for=20
professional disc jockey purposes without the authorization of the sound=20
recording copyright owner is a violation of federal and/or state copyright=
=20
law. This includes copying all or some of a sound recording to analog or=20
digital tape, CD-R, mini-disc or a computer disk/hard drive. Violators=20
could be civilly liable for statutory damages of up to $100,000 per=20
infringed sound recording, in addition to costs and the copyright owner=92s=
=20
attorney fees. Criminal liabilities include up to five years imprisonment=
=20
and/or a fine of up to $250,000.

"The RIAA=92s continuing enforcement efforts focus on the manufacture and=
=20
distribution of illegal compilations throughout the DJ community,=20
including businesses that allege to be authorized but are not. The RIAA=20
also addresses flagrant copyright infringement by DJs who create and=20
manufacture multi-disk compilations of top hits without obtaining=20
appropriate licenses from the copyright holders." [RIAA]

After reading this, one would assume that they're targeting people who=20
manufacture "Top Hits" CDs, what's "hot" that week and so on. But with the=
=20
threat of five years in jail and a fine of up to $250,000, how badly do we=
=20
want to find out..."

6. To provide a cheap medium to distribute music, given the constraints of=
=20
recording formats and cost of distribution in the early 70's, 80's, 90's=20
as mixing and recording formats changed from analog to digital.

7. To interpret, alter, influence, perfect, expand and better the mixing=20
techniques of many djs.

8. To sample, dub, and alter the art of mixing music with various sound=20
inputs.

9. To distribute the latest tracks on a tight budget. (See #6)

10. To give artists, producers, promoters, listeners another way to=20
communicate their musical style.

11. To distribute tracks that may or may not have had another means=20
of distribution due to copyright restraints or those which are/are=20
not an offiical release, commercial release or promotional release.

12. To provide a gauge for how well a certain track might be played on the=
=20
radio, in clubs, purchased in stores, played by other djs, or how an=20
audience might respond w/ demand versus supply.

13. To provide a medium for experimental or custom music releases.

14. To give listeners the option have portable music, the option to listen=
=20
to their favorite artists on the "go".

15. Mixtapes break new artists, help the music industry discover unsigned=

talent, and increases music industry sales as a street promotional tool.

Yow thanks Karina!

I did a google search and found some of those links,
but you've turned up some new ones I didn't find. 
Thank you!

Regards,

Peter

P.S. Did I ever thank you for giving my kids those
giant round jellybeans in the park?   In case I
forgot, thanks again!

hey amanda, thanx... i'll gladly hook you up with a hard copy too, just send me an address or come introduce yourself sometime... =)
glad you liked the cover art too, my girlfriend helped me with the graphic design and layout and did a pretty dynamite job...
haven't had time to update my bookings on the web page but i'm playing this friday, nov. 5 at antares, it's a scorpio party at the dungeon in sf... then on dec. 4 at the seekr party, and, subject to confirmation, at nocturnal beats in sac on dec. 16... i'll try to update the web site soon with all the info... cheers...

Subject: [sfraves] bsp:  bam plays 1015, grooverider in the main room

a tiny little BSP that i'm opening the VIP room at 1015 this friday.  
breakthru is hosting all breaks upstairs and Grooverider is headlining the 
main room.

this is my first time playing at 1015 and while the place has gone through 
it's share of ups and downs...i'm still pretty excited since it was the club 
that got me into the electronic dance music scene (or whatever you call 
this) in the bay area.  oh, how many long long long nights and mornings were 
spent there...

free before 10:30 and i play from 10:30-11:30.  how perfect.  ;)  i'll be 
warming things up with a little funk and groove break action.

$10 presales online at 1015.com.  or $5 off at the door with flyer.

Subject: [sfraves] (bsp) (nrr) Subversive Soundz presents author Derrick Jensen at AK Press

so, this is way, way off the rave topic, but i don't
post too often, and we've been talkin' politics, so
here goes...

Derrick Jensen is one of my favorite non-fiction
authors, and I'm really excited to have him speaking
here in the Bay Area.  He's able to skillfully
interweave stories of our relationship to the natural
world, prisons and racism, people's resistance, and
the continuing occupation of North America plus much
more.  While Subversive Soundz generally does musical
events, we do branch out.  

(and hopefully this will be done in time for me to
catch jeff samuel at the rx gallery afterwards.)

Details below:

AK Press and Subversive Soundz present:

Author Derrick Jensen 
on  Dismantling Civilization

Saturday, November 6th
7pm
AK Press

Derrick Jensen is the author of books A Language Older
than Words, The Culture of Make Believe, Listening to
the Land, Walking on Water: Reading, Writing and
Revolution, and most recently, Strangely Like War: The
Global Assault on Forests and Welcome to the Machine:
Science, Surveillance and the Culture of Control. 

>From Derrick Jensen: "We are members of the most
destructive culture ever to exist. Our assault on the
natural world, on indigenous and other cultures, on
women, on children, on all of us through the
possibility of nuclear suicide and other means--all
these are unprecedented in their magnitude and
ferocity.  So began my first book, Listening to the
Land . Why do we act as we do? What are sane and
effective responses to outrageously destructive
behavior? What will it take for us to stop the horrors
that characterize our way of being? My work and life
revolve around these questions."

Jensen is a writer increasingly recognized as a major
new voice of cultural dissent. A Language Older Than
Words has become an underground best seller on college
campuses and The Culture of Make Believe was one of
two finalists for the 2003 J. Anthony Lukas Book
Prize, which cited it as "a passionate and provocative
meditation on the nexus of racism, genocide,
environmental destruction and corporate malfeasance,
where civilization meets its discontents." 

"A typical Jensen event is multidimensional and feels
a bit like traveling beneath the earth among tree
roots, as they twist their way into soil, rock, river
beds and accompany fish, insects, discarded tires,
cellophane wrappers, animal minds, history, and human
instinct on a strange and interlocking journey." 

Event includes special guest Agent Apple of the Biotic
Baking Brigade.

$5-10 sliding scale donation, no one turned away for
lack of funds. A benefit for Break the Chains prisoner
support (www.breakthechains.net).

AK Press is located at 674-A 23rd. Street, Oakland, CA
between MLK and San Pablo - near 19th St. BART and
West Grand Exit of 80/980. 

Wheelchair accessible.

Never Say Die-bold: So You Dont Think the Bush
Campaign Stole This Election? Think Again 

By Jackson Thoreau 
opEdNews.com 

If youre looking for one word to sum up the way the
Bush-Cheney campaign stole another election Tuesday
besides obvious ones like cheated, try this one:
Diebold.

An election judge where I voted Tuesday in a heavily
Democratic precinct in Maryland knows what that means
and wasnt adverse to sharing his opinion of the
Republican-owned company. As I was about to vote with
the electronic system, I asked this judge if they had
a way to check peoples votes through a paper backup.


The official said no, and then in a low voice so no
one else would hear, added, And that really makes us
nervous, with Diebold as the owner of that system.


Goodbye, hanging chads. Hello, computer fraud that
leaves no trace, no chads hanging. 
  
Diebold Inc. of North Canton, Ohio, supplied scores of
machines and counted millions of votes Tuesday, while
reportedly discarding many votes for Democrat John
Kerry, according to British investigative reporter
Gregory Palast. Walden ODell, chief executive of
Diebold and a top fundraiser for the Bush campaign,
wrote in a fund-raising letter last year that he was
committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes
to the president next year.


That he did.


Software errors involving the system can change
results, computer scientists say. Since the majority
of touch screens in the United States do not produce
paper records, the machines could alter ballots
without anyone noticing. 
  
What has most concerned scientists are problems that
are not observable, so the fact that no major problems
were observed says nothing about the system, David
Jefferson, a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California, told the Associated
Press. The fact that we had a relatively smooth
election yesterday does not change at all the
vulnerability these systems have to fraud or bugs. 
  
Some 8.2 percent of touch-screen votes in senatorial
elections between 1998 and 2000 were lost, according
to an MIT/CalTech study. That was more than any other
system except lever machines, which lost 9.5 percent
of votes. 
  
Bev Harris, author of Black Box Voting and the
BlackBoxVoting.com web site, has documented numerous
cases of electronic disasters. One occurred in Volusia
County, Fla., in 2000 in which county election
officials hand recounted more than 184,000 paper
ballots used to feed the computerized system, after
the central ballot-counting computer showed a
Socialist Party candidate receiving more than 9,000
votes and Al Gore getting minus 19,000. Another 4,000
votes were received for Bush that should not have been
there. 
  
Election officials eventually tallied Gore beating
Bush by 97,063 votes to 82,214. But the wrong numbers
had already been sent to the media, which were used by
FOX and other networks to erroneously call the
election for Bush and swing the public relations part
of the recount battle in his favor. 
  
On Tuesday, Election Protection, a program of People
for the American Way, had more than 15,000 calls to
its hotline about ballot problems, voter intimidation
and other
situations.


The Institute for Public Accuracy also outlined
various problems. Susan Truitt, co-founder of the
Citizens Alliance for Secure Elections, was quoted on
its site saying that seven counties in Ohio had
electronic voting machines without paper trails, and
scientific exit polls showed Kerry with the lead. But
verifying votes was impossible, she said. 
  
A recount without a paper trail is meaningless; you
just get a regurgitation of the data, Truitt said. A
poll worker told me [Wednesday] morning that there
were no tapes of the results posted on some machines;
on other machines the posted count was zero, which
obviously shouldnt be the case. 
  
Other problems include Ohios version of Katherine
Harris 
  
There were many other problems in Ohio. Like in
Florida, the Ohio secretary of state, Ken Blackwell,
made decisions on what could be counted and other
important matters even as he shilled for Bush as a
co-chair of his campaign. This raised serious
conflict-of-interest concerns, said Ohio state Senator
Teresa Fedor. 
  
There is a pattern of voter suppression; thats why I
called for Blackwells resignation more than a month
ago, she said. Blackwell, while claiming to run an
unbiased elections process, was also the co-chair of
the Bush-Cheney campaign in Ohio. Additionally, he was
the spokesperson for the anti-business, anti-family
constitutional
amendment Issue 1, and a failed initiative to repeal
a crucial sales-tax revenue source for the state.
Blackwell learned his moves from the Katherine Harris
playbook of Florida 2000, and we wont stand for it.


The Ohio tally also included a version of the Florida
butterfly ballot, said Bob Fitrakis, an attorney with
Election Protection. The absentee ballots were
misleading in Franklin County, he said. Kerry was
the third line down, but you had to punch number four
to vote for him. Bush was getting both his votes as
well as Kerrys.


There were also far fewer machines in the inner-city
districts than in the suburbs, Fitrakis said. I
documented at least a dozen people leaving because the
lines were so long in African-American areas, he
said. Blackwell did a great deal of suppressing
before the election - like attempting to refuse to
process voter registration forms. 
  
I heard a report that one Ohio voter had to wait in
line 15 hours to vote. In one of the busiest precincts
in Columbus, Blackwell only supplied it with three
voting
machines. How many people gave up and did not vote
there?

Dirty tricks by Republicans on the rise 
  
A few days before the 2004 election, the Washington
Post published an article detailing increasing dirty
tricks, mostly by Republicans. 
  
In Lake County, Ohio, some people received a memo on
bogus Board of Elections letterhead informing voters
who registered through Democratic and NACCP drives
that they could not vote.

In Leon County, students at Florida State and Florida
A&M universities who signed petitions to legalize
medical marijuana or impose stiffer penalties for
child molesters unknowingly had their party
registration switched to Republican and their
addresses
changed. The latter would affect their ability to vote
since they would not be registered at the proper site.
The media traced the source to a group hired by the
Florida Republican Party. 
  
In Allegheny County, Pa., fliers on a bogus county
letterhead were handed out and mailed, saying that
due to immense voter turnout expected on Tuesday,
the election had been extended. Republicans should
vote Tuesday, while Democrats should vote on Wednesday
 the wrong day.


In some Milwaukee black neighborhoods, a flier warned
people that they could not vote in that election if
they had already voted in another election that year.
If you
violate any of these laws, you can get ten years in
prison and your children will get taken away from
you, the flier said.

In Charleston County, S.C., a fake letter supposedly
from the NAACP threatens
voters who have outstanding parking tickets or have
failed to pay child support with arrest. A similar
flier was distributed in Baltimore in 2002. 
  
Such tricks are not new. There are famous examples
like the 1971 break-in of Democratic National
Committee headquarters by Nixon. There are also many
lesser known examples. In 2002, Ron Kirk, a former
Dallas mayor who ran as a Democrat for U.S. Senate,
reported a bogus automated phone message dialed to
voters in Austin and other cities. The message asked
voters to support Kirk because he supported same-sex
marriages and gay adoptions. Kirk said he didnt
support either issue and blamed more Republican
pre-election dirty tricks. His Republican opponent,
John Cornyn, denied being behind the false phone bank.

  
U.S. has a long history of rigged elections 
  
The U.S., of course, is no stranger to rigged
elections, even well before Tuesdays and the one in
2000. A famous case was the controversial way that the
late President Lyndon B. Johnson won a U.S. Senate
seat in 1948 in Texas on his way to the White House
that reportedly involved votes from dead people. What
some overlook in this case was how LBJ had lost an
election in a similar disputed fashion seven years
before. 
  
Another lesser known case involved the 1984 landslide
presidential election of the late Republican Ronald
Reagan. In Dallas, where both Bush and Cheney lived at
one time, there were 217 ballots cast in a precinct
that had zero registered voters. That would not affect
the election, but it demonstrates that fraud has
existed for a long time. 
  
As early as 1986, Michael Shamos, a Pennsylvania
computer scientist, testified during a Texas hearing
that the computer hardware and software used to
tabulate voters ballots could easily be manipulated. 
  
Computers can be manipulated remotely, by wire or
radio, or by direct physical input, Shamos said. The
memories on which these computers operate can easily
fit into a shirt pocket and can be substituted in
seconds. The software can be set to await the receipt
of a special card, whose presence will cause all the
election counters to be altered. This card could be
dropped into the ballot box by any confederate. The
possibilities for this type of tampering are endless,
and virtually no detection is possible once tabulation
has been completed....Even if the software is not
altered, there is no reason to believe that it is
correct. Many tests performed on such programs have
revealed faulty logic and wildly incorrect results. 
  
Suzan Kesim, then-vice president of a security
consulting firm in South Bend, Ind., also testified in
1986 that many of the computer auditing procedures
used by the banking industry that have been tried and
true could easily be modified or used as they are for
auditing elections....Fraud possibilities include
hidden programs.  
  
Texas even had its own voter purge almost two decades
before Florida attempted to strike some 60,000 voters
from the rolls with false accusations of felony
convictions. In 1982, lists were provided to Texas
election officials that made mostly false accusations
of felony convictions against voters. The accused
included public officials who successfully sued for
slander. The state also hired armed officers at
minority voter precincts and posted signs warning
voters against casting illegal ballots. Charles
Knutson pointed out in a Democrats.com report that the
Texas purge probably involved Bush mastermind Karl
Rove, who worked for then-Texas Republican Gov. Bill
Clements in 1982.  
  
Another odd case involved a West Texas county where
the systems optical scanners misread ballots and at
first reported landslide wins for two Republican
commissioners in 2002. But the next day, after alert
poll workers became suspicious of the wide margins of
supposed victory, they discovered a defective computer
chip in the scanner system. After two hand recounts
and another count with a replacement scanner chip,
officials announced that Democrats Jerry House and
Chloanne Lindsey actually won by wide margins. 
  
It was hard to believe that that type of mistake had
happened, Robbie Floyd, one of the Republicans who
lost, said in one press report. 
  
So could Kerry have been ripped off by a defective
computer chip in Ohio and Florida, where scientific
exit polls indicated Kerry wins? We will never know
since, unlike the Texas machines in 2002, the Diebold
machines in Ohio and Florida have no paper trail. 
  
How convenient. 
  
Popular vote fixed? 
  
With all the former and current Republicans supporting
Kerry  even a long-time Texas Republican friend of
mine voted for a Democrat for the first time for
president on Tuesday  its hard to believe that Bush
got about 3.5 million more votes than Kerry and 8
million more than he received in 2000. 
  
There cant be that many new devil worshippers or
Christian fundamentalists. 
  
A larger turnout  Tuesdays 60 percent turnout was
the largest since 1968  has favored Democrats in the
past. But about 6 million of those votes have not been
counted. 
  
Some said that exit polls were accurate in states that
had paper trails, but not in ones without the paper
trails for e-voting. 
  
Even though Kerry conceded, groups like the
International Labor Communications Association refused
to follow suit. The group is waging a campaign to
count all the votes in Ohio. 

Kerrys concession was really strange and
disappointing. Would Howard Dean have conceded so fast
to Bush? Gore fought Bush harder than Kerry. I dont
get it since Kerry even had Bruce Springsteen play No
Retreat, No Surrender at a campaign appearance and
used that song during other events. John Edwards also
pledged to make sure votes were counted. Then they
surrendered without putting up a fight in the overtime
phase. That was most disappointing, more so than
Gores concession in 2000. 
  
Did Skull and Bones members blackmail Kerry into
conceding without a real fight?


Perhaps Kerry simply foresaw the inevitable result,
but he still could have seen the counting of
provisional ballots through to the end. It would have
raised some more awareness about the problems with
Diebold and possibility of vote tampering. It would
have shown Bush-Cheney that Democrats werent backing
down, especially with so many questions about vote
reliability and reports of Republican voter
suppression and dirty tricks. 
  
But Kerry called for unity with the Evil Empire. Why
is it that Democrats are always trying to call for
unity and compromise with Republicanazis? As Carolyn
Kay with MakeThemAccountable.com said, we have to
completely remake the Democratic Party. We have to
learn from right wingers to take a licking and come
back kicking. It is absolutely essential that as soon
as possible we pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off,
and start working to take over the Democratic Party.
It has lost its moorings, and because of that it is
losing elections, over and over and over again. 
  
Sure, the deck was stacked against Kerry. Perhaps the
last week of bad news for Bush, the Washington
Redskins loss, the exit polls, and other omens that
seemed to spell a Kerry victory were mere ploys by
Rove to make his side work harder and our side slack
off a bit. 
  
One thing I know: We have to keep fighting these
cheating thieves, not try to make peace with them. And
I hope many people on our side wont move away 
though I realize moving out of the country is the
ultimate protest and I understand that choice. We all
have to figure out what is the best path to take for
ourselves. 
  
As for me, Im staying in the belly of the beast, in
the shadow of the Evil Empire, to continue to sucker
punch it in its bloated, bullshit-filled gut. Starting
now, just as many conservatives boycotted France for
its correct stance against the Iraqi invasion, Im
boycotting the state of Texas, where I lived for 40
years before moving to friendlier and more progressive
confines last year. Bush got his political start in
Texas, where the Republicanazis imposed a
redistricting scheme that made that far-right state
even more Republican. Every statewide official is a
Republican there. The Texas Republican Party platform
reads like a nazi playbook, even calling for getting
out of the UN, abolishing numerous federal agencies,
making homosexuality a crime and teaching the Bible in
public schools. 
  
Enough is enough. Fuck Texas and the horses that Bush
and Cheney rode in on. 
  
And fuck Diebold, too. 
  
As for you, Sen. Kerry, I appreciate your hard work,
your intelligence, your dedication to this campaign,
although I was disappointed by your finish. But, with
all due respect, you know where you can stick your
call for unity..

	I haven't found that most conservatives base their politics primarily 
on religion. Certainly for many of them it informs their beliefs on 
hot-button issues like homosexuality, but look at the prominent 
conservative or conservative-leaning news sources in the U.S. -- most 
have more of a secular focus. For example, Rush Limbaugh, Insight 
Magazine, Weekly Standard, Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, National 
Review, WorldNetDaily.com, Townhall.com, American Spectator. Even the 
Washington Times, owned by right-wing religious figure Rev. Sun Myung 
Moon, doesn't have much of a religious focus. Thinking of 
religion-based news sources, only Pat Robertson's 700 Club comes 
readily to mind.

	If you look at history, or even just what's going on in the world 
today, George Bush hardly even shows up on the chart of causes of human 
misery and suffering. First you've got to figure out why a benevolent 
God would allow people in power like Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-Tsung, Pol 
Pot, Robert Mugabe, and Kim Il Sung.

	Conservatives (and libertarians) feel the same way about legal gun 
ownership, which actually *reduces* violence. Why would anyone want to 
ban it? Living in the Bay Area you may not know much about the gun 
culture, but even if you set aside hunting -- which I have a personal 
problem with as an animal rights advocate -- millions of Americans 
enjoy the recreational use and/or collecting of firearms. Yet thousands 
of gun control laws have been passed in the U.S., and most are still on 
the books. Even though the Constitution clearly protects the right to 
keep and bear arms, politicians are allowed to get away with treating 
it like toilet paper. That's fucking depressing too.

	For many on the right, guns are a *very* big deal. Maybe even a bigger 
deal than religion. Many conservatives are afraid of a police state too 
-- but while you worry about John Ashcroft rounding up the Arabs, or 
throwing you in jail for drugs, they worry about politicians like Ted 
Kennedy and Hilary Clinton sending people to take away their guns and 
their kids and EPA or UN bureaucrats kicking them off their land. They 
see the mainstream media, Hollywood, and the educational establishment 
as actively hostile to their culture, and they generally don't see 
government, corporations, or unions standing up for them either. So 
they are more into self-reliance -- knowing how to shoot back if 
somebody comes after them. When leftists talk about more gun control, 
they directly threaten this self-reliance and what conservatives view 
as their last-ditch means of preventing a police state.

	Fortunately, I think the tide on guns is turning. The Democrats are 
starting to realize that there is much less political benefit in being 
against guns than they thought there was. Kerry made pains this year to 
be photographed in hunting gear, to talk about how he believed in RKBA, 
how he'd been hunting since he was a boy, etc. Unfortunately for him, 
he lacked credibility, because he'd been casting anti-gun votes in the 
Senate for the past 30 years and never disassociated himself from those 
votes or explained how he'd changed his mind. When an organization in 
West Virginia gave him a gun as a gift during a visit to that state, it 
turned out that he would have been committing a crime to bring that gun 
across state lines back to Massachusetts because of a law he himself 
had helped pass!

	Ultimately, if the real police state does arrive, we cultural liberals 
better start learning how to shoot too. If the Iraqi insurgents can 
successfully fight an urban war against the might of the U.S. military 
and government, we can do it on our own turf too if push comes to shove.

	The way I look at it, Bush has done much more wrong than right. But 
the main opposition (Kerry and the Democrats) failed to focus on the 
worst of it -- the growing police state in America. In a national 
scientific poll taken earlier this year for Libertarian presidential 
aspirant Aaron Russo (who lost the party's nomination to Michael 
Badnarik), 34% of respondents said they think the country is becoming a 
police state, and an additional 17% said they weren't sure. That's a 
majority, 51%, who either believe the U.S is turning into a police 
state, or think it might be happening. Those numbers should have been a 
wake-up call.

	I believe Kerry and the Democrats failed to focus on this because they 
themselves are complicit in it. The police state has been growing since 
well before Bush took office, under Clinton and previous presidents -- 
Bush just accelerated it. Kerry voted for the Patriot Act, and has not 
disavowed it. "Free speech zones" were in place at both the Republican 
and Democrat national conventions. Both parties conspired to shut 
alternative candidates out of the debates. Both have gone along with 
fascist security measures at the airports, increased police ability to 
violate the 4th and 6th Amendments, ramping up the "War on Drugs," 
adding yet more gun-carrying government agents, cracking down on raves, 
etc.

	The reality is that government spending grew by leaps and bounds under 
Bush and the past Republican Congress. But rather than siding with the 
majority of Americans who want smaller government, Kerry saved his 
strongest criticism of Bush's domestic policy for a *popular* policy 
that *reduced* the size of government -- Bush's tax cuts! How stupid 
was that? The reality is that the wealthiest 20% of Americans pay like 
80% of the income taxes, so of course any across-the-board cut in 
income taxes is going to "favor the wealthy." Criticizing income tax 
cuts as "favoring the wealthy" as Kerry did, is either ignorant or 
dishonest. In the case of prominent politicians who do it, I think we 
can probably rule out the "ignorant." They are familiar enough with 
where the tax money comes from to know how hard it is to have a 
substantial cut in income or other "progressive" taxes without 
"favoring the wealthy." That's why they always criticize, but never 
come up with their own alternative plans that would substantially cut 
taxes *without* "favoring the wealthy."

	If they want to help the poor directly, of course, there's plenty of 
other things they could do. Eliminate professional licensing laws that 
require people to pay an annual fee to government just to work. 
Eliminate laws that require people to pay off the government in order 
to start their own business. Cut Social Security taxes. Mandate 
reductions in union dues. Let anyone make money by using his or her 
vehicle as a taxi. Get rid of sales taxes. Make housing and health care 
affordable again by getting rid of the government regulations that have 
made them so expensive. In the case of health care, rein in the lawyers 
whose lawsuits are driving up medical insurance fees that get passed 
along to patients. Stop using parking and traffic tickets as a way to 
raise government revenue.

	These "important regulatory agencies" and their spending are 
destroying the U.S. economy. Some EPA regulations actually *hurt* the 
environment and wildlife protection, while the FDA enforces bullshit 
laws preventing people from self-medicating with marijuana and other 
drugs. Making people go to a doctor to get permission to take 
prescription drugs just makes those drugs that much more expensive and 
contributes to the lack of affordable health care for the poor.

	I can agree with that. But if you want a balanced picture, don't just 
listen to NPR. Listen to Rush Limbaugh as well. If you buy the 
Chronicle during the week, subscribe to the Washington Times national 
weekly edition for weekends. Don't just read Time or Newsweek magazines 
-- read Reason or Liberty. If your own news intake is ideologically 
balanced, you'll have a better perspective on what's going on with the 
rest of the country.

OK, I was exaggerating a bit. But it's clear that the religious right
had a huge impact in this religion, and Christian fundamentalists are,
well, fundamentally incapable of being presuaded that something is more
"moral" if it doesn't say so in the Bible.

While the conservative establishment as a whole may not advocate
enlisting the aid of religious fundamentalists, that's exactly what
they've done. Karl Rove, hardly a religious man by anyone's standards,
clearly reached out to social conservatives for support. The President
himself is a born-again Christian, and few conservatives that I've
spoken with have voiced any distaste for his tendency to wield his faith
as political power so long as it helps him defeat the opposition. To aid
these efforts, the conservative-leaning media establishment regularly
inflates wedge issues to drum up support against social liberals among
the religious base.

I think we've had this discussion before, so I'm going to avoid it.
Needless to say I totally disagree, and I think it's disingenuous to
equate gay rights with gun ownership. One grants people the legal rights
to share property, have children, and take care of one anothers' legal
affairs; the other permits people the right to own and use lethal
weapons. I have to admit though, I've given a lot of thought to buying a
gun recently.

So, if these people are *so* adamant about their right to own a gun
because it says they can in the Constitution, why do they feel the need
to amend the document to accomodate their religious beliefs? I really
don't think guns are as important to the fundamentalists as, so the
saying goes, "god and gays".

Sure. So if these people are so into self-reliance, why do they feel the
need to impose their religious beliefs on people that they never come in
contact with? And if they don't see government or corporations standing
up for them, why the FUCK would they vote for Bush? Again, I think it's
because religion trumps everything for these people. We'll see how happy
they are when an industry unregulated fouls up the environment so much
that even their precious small towns and unmolested countryside become
so poisoned that they can no longer live there.

Agreed. Though I have to say, I trust a police state run by Democrats
only *slightly* more than Republicans. There's something extra creepy
about a Department of Justice run by a man who runs his office according
to the rules of a fundamentalist Christian sect called the "Assembly of
God". Given the choice between a religious fanatic and a power-hungry
lawyer, I'll take the lawyer, thanks. For me, nothing rings truer when
discussing American politics than the phrase "lesser of two evils".

Erm, not very stupid. Think about it: you're elected President at the
onset of a recession. Hundreds of thousands drop below the poverty line
during your first term. Millions lose their healthcare. Salaries of
everyone except the biggest earners fail to keep up with inflation. So
what do you do? Issue a tax cut that breaks down like this:

Salary			Average Tax Cut		Percentage of Tax Cut
< $20,000		$98					1.2%
$20-36,000		$508				6.2
$36-59,000		$791				9.6
$59-97,000		$1081				13.2
$97-205,000		$1225				11.2
$205-518,000	$2780				6.8
> $518,000		$85,002				51.8

(source: <http://www.ctj.org/html/gwb0602.htm>)

So the 2002 tax cut gave less than $100 to the poorest taxpayers over a
8-year period, and $85,000 each to the top %1. The Child Tax Credit
sunsets in 2005, but capital gains taxes don't return to 2000 levels
until 2009. I don't think that's just at all. The fact of the matter is
that the ultra-rich can get by without that money. It is our
responsibility--according to most religions, ironically enough--to help
the poorest among us through these tough times.

Actually, the CBO reports that the wealthiest 20% pay about 64% of
federal taxes. The President's tax cuts have increased the burden of
middle and lower classes when they needed a tax cut the most.

It seems pretty simple to me: make the tax brackets more progressive.
Cut taxes for the lowest wage earners, leave the middle untouched, and
increase taxes on the wealthiest. Eliminate payroll taxes, increase the
earned income tax credit, and place capital gains taxes on equal footing
with the income tax to account for all those people that simply live off
their investments and inheritances. Of course, reigning in spending on
government waste, including nuclear weapons research and "strategic"
missile defense, would help too. And don't forget those billions of
dollars doled out in no-bid contracts to corporations with close ties to
the executive branch...

So where does all that revenue go? How is the government supposed to
maintain social services, fund education and medical research, keep the
military trained, or keep the roads paved? Oh yeah, that's right:
privatize everything. Give corporations control over everything that
people rely on, eliminate stable government jobs, and let the market
dictate what society needs. Great plan!

That's such a load of bullshit. You can demonize lawyers all you want,
but do you know why medical insurance is so much more expensive? Because
the healthcare industry isn't regulated properly, and drug companies and
HMOs have been allowed to run roughshod over people without consequence.
It's fashionable to claim that medical malpractice is solely responsible
for the rising costs of healthcare, but that only accounts for 1% of the
increase. The biggest factors are the cost of prescription drugs (for
which we pay the most in the world) and the unholy alliance of
corporations and HMOs, which limits our choice--and thus, discourages
competition--in the medical insurance market.

Strangely, I haven't heard any Libertarians opposing the Republicans'
horrendous Medicare reform bill that explicity outlaws drug
re-importation from Canada and denies the system the ability to
negotiate with drug companies on a national scale.

But that defeats the purpose of Social Security. It's not supposed to
deliver big returns for individuals; it's supposed to deliver equal
returns for people that are incapable of saving money on their own.

Then change the laws! Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater by
diluting the regulatory agencies and taking away their powers to prevent
industry from taking advantage of both American citizens and our trade
partners. The EPA used to provide defense from corporations that pollute
our air, water and land. The Labor Department used to have the power to
prevent corporations from working their employees to death (quite
literally). But Bush came into office and put former industry lobbyists
at the heads of almost every single regulatory agency, effectively
neutering their ability to regulate. And you wonder why lawsuits are
increasingly prevelant? Lawyers haven't gotten any slimier; people are
desperate for justice, and if the government won't provide it they turn
to attorneys (many of which are, admittedly, greedy--but IMO, this only
provides some balance to the greediness of corporate America).

I think if most Americans realized this, they'd be outraged. This year
the EPA eased mercury regulations while the FDA issued warnings to
concerning the levels of mercury found in fish (as a result, pregnant
women have to watch their tuna intake out of fear of poisoning their
unborn children). Regulations on the meat-packing industry have been
downgraded, increasing the likelihood of nation-wide contamination.
There are countless examples that illustrate the irresponsibility of
de-regulation in this country, the energy crisis nonwithstanding. The
Bush Administration is directly responsible for a great deal of these
mishaps, which boil down to corporate giveaways for his big campaign
donors.

I will do no such thing. NPR is the most objective news source I know
of. Michael Krasny dedicated an hour of Forum last month to national
third-party candidates, including Badnarik. Rush Limbaugh, on the other
hand, doesn't deserve to be on the air. He's a hateful, angry man that
parrots the Republican party's talking points and distorts the facts to
suit his ideological slant. He's just a cog in the right-wing attack
machine, and I wouldn't waste my time listening to a word he says if I
were you.

I don't want ideological balance, I want objectivity. I'd rather know
the truth than try to figure it out by listening to talking heads on
either side try to skew an argument in their favor. That's what I hate
about the national news media: it's more about letting both sides duke
it out than getting to the facts of an issue.

The liberals are stupid for being so secular and let it become a
partisan issue. If liberals just aceept that Christianity is very much
a part of our culture then the fundies will lose there edge.

The fundies convinced the average Christians that liberals are
radicals who set to push gay marriages (well I believe gay marriages
is OK, but really NOW is not the time), take prayers out of school,
and next thing u know Christmas won't even be a national holiday.

Liberals don't have to be atheist to be secular. But that's what the
fundies are branding the liberals and it's working.

Actually they have more in common as I think about it. They both
violate some long-held traditions (whether they're right or wrong is
not the issue). As we're on the downside of a social progression
cycle, it's not a good time to promote radical social changes.

But it's not the fundies who voted for those amendments in 11 states
in a landslide. It shows that the average Christian Americans (and
even non-Christian ones) are not ready for as ridical a social change
as gay marriage. Over 60% of Americans believe gays should have equal
rights protected. They just don't think marriage is a gay right.

It's very convinient (and simply naive) to brand all conservatives as
religious fundies. They're not. This election is NOT even about the
religious right (no-one in the Bush Administration qualifies as a
religious fundie except John Ashcroft). It's about the convservatives
convincing middle America that their traditions are being threatened.
It's about being seen as the most powerful, most arrogant nation in
the world. The midwestern, pro-gun, non-fundie conservatives share
that view.

A police state is a police state. I would only turst a police state if
**I** run it.

In the post-9/11 mindset, the middle America doesn't care about having
a police state. They overwhelmingly support giving up some civil
liberty in exchange for better security. It's obviously a doomed idea,
but you can't just campaign against what they believe and think it'll
change their minds in a few months.

I think Kerry lost because he spent a big focus on the war in Iraq and
war on terror, but failed to deliver a dramatically differrent plan
for Iraq and failed to convince us that he'll do a better job to fight
terroism. He decided not to bring up his previous experiences on the
Counter-Terrorism Taskforce in his campaign (because he thinks his
experience cannot be translated into effective campaign soundbites),
which would have been a great asset for him.

That's right, they can scream about trial laywers raising medical
costs all they want but it has nexty to nothing to do with it. It all
costs down to the Republicans trying to demonize one of the biggest
groups that funds the Democratic Party: trial laywers.

Medical costs in the US is outrageous because they relationship
between insurance companies and healthcare providers and drug
companies preclude all of them from having to follolw to the rules of
free market. Hosptials and doctors can charge whatever they want
because the insurance company will just pay for it. And instead of
pressuring the providers and drug companies to lower the cost,
insurance companies either raise our premiums or cut our benefits or
downright deny to pay for our care.

We have the longest, most monopolizing patent protection for drug
companies. Prescription drugs are orders of magnitude more expensive
here than anywhere else in the world, they remain under patent
protection for the longest, and we have no options to import them from
anywhere else.

That's the scary thing. We all hate lawyers (not that all of them are
greedy, but the simple idea of paying $$ for justice is just sick),
yet we find ourselves having to look to lawyers more and more often to
protect ourselves from the government. Conservatives are supposed to
advocate small governement and minimum regulation in society and free
market. Now the neo-cons are turning their ideology towards
totaliarianism. There are many "true" conservatives who disagree with
the neocon ideology, liberals can win their hearts if they try hard
enough.

Being objective doesn't mean not having an opinion. You can have an
opinon and still be objective. That's my problem with normal news
outlets: they're afraid to have an opinion at all.

Being factual doesn't imply objectivity either. You can easily
manipulate opinions by omitting certain facts.

I want facts, facts that are thorough and complete (which means not
relying solely on US news sources). I want opinions as well. I want
ideological opinions from both sides . But most importantly, I want
the new outlets not be afraid to have an opinion about the talking
points from both sides.

	The similarity comes in the fact that both sides -- mostly =

a final bit of irony, there is even a word for fear of guns --=20

	Let's get something straight: Money belongs to the people who =
earn it,=20
not to the government. When government takes your money and then gives=20=

some of it back to you, or you find out that the cost of regulations=20
you have to obey is going down by 1% this year (instead of up by the=20
usual 5%), that's not a "giveaway," it's a partial return of stolen=20
property.

	When government subsidizes corporations -- which it does =
frequently=20
under both Republicans and Democrats, as evidenced by the fact that=20
corporate welfare recipients give heavily to both parties (see=20
http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/mems.asp ) -- that *is* a=20
giveaway, and it's wrong. But let's not confuse the two concepts.

	Before criticizing things like the EPA's easing of regulations =
on=20
mercury, there are important questions that need to be asked. For=20
instance, how much real danger is there from mercury in tuna fish? How=20=

many unborn babies have actually been poisoned? Is it proven, or is it=20=

a media scare story like crack babies? Should the government force=20
industry to spend $100 million (random hypothetical number) to make=20
tuna 100% mercury-free, if the same expenditure, channeled into worker=20=

salaries, lower prices, and shareholder returns, could have marginally=20=

improved the standard of living of all the tuna industry workers, tuna=20=

buyers, and people whose pension plans include stock in fisheries or=20
tuna-packing companies? Is this regulation worth costing many people=20
that little bit of extra income that might have enabled some of the=20
thousands or millions of people affected to afford to move to safer=20
neighborhoods, to afford better health care, better day care, to=20
upgrade to a newer, safer, less polluting car, to be able to afford to=20=

eat lunch somewhere healthier than McDonalds, etc.?

	The problem with the knee-jerk "let's regulate!" attitude is =
that it=20
rarely takes any kind of real economic cost-benefit analysis into=20
account. Regulators typically look at the immediate, intended effects=20
of their legislation, often based on faulty or incomplete science or=20
data, while failing to look at the more subtle and unintended=20

	I strongly recommend the book "Give Me A Break!" by ABC's John =
Stossel=20

    The Wrap: The Bush era

    Jane Perrone and Mark Oliver
    04 November 2004

    Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up
of the best of the
    day's papers.

    AND NOW FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS

    "We may not like it. In fact, to tell the truth,
we don't like it one
    bit ... Mr Bush has won fair (so far as we can
see) and square. He
    and his country - and the rest of the world - now
have to deal with
    it."

    Such is the sober mood of the Guardian's leader
writers in the wake of
    George Bush's victory in the US elections, matched
by the blacked-out
    front of the paper's G2 features section, which
contains just two
    words: "Oh, God". The Telegraph's leader line is
diametrically
    opposed, saying that Americans have "demonstrated
once and for all
    that no power on Earth can intimidate a free
nation... This is a
    president who can really speak for America", the
piece concludes.

    The British press - acutely aware of how out of
date they looked
    yesterday morning in this age of 24 hour news -
devote most of this
    morning's column inches to predicting what another
four years with Mr
    Bush in the White House will mean to America and
the rest of the
    world.

    Some do pause to wonder at the outcome, though.
The Mirror asks
    disdainfully: "How can 59,054,087 people be so
DUMB?" on its front
    page, promising more coverage of the "US election
disaster" inside.
    Nevertheless, that number was the highest number
of votes for any US
    presidential candidates in history, and the first
time since George
    Bush senior in 1988 that a US president has been
elected by a clear
    popular majority. ("Once it looked like an
aberration. Now it is an
    era," notes the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland).

    The Independent prints pictures of prisoners at
Guantanamo Bay and Abu
    Ghraib alongside a soldier in Iraq, oil piplines
and a smug picture
    of the new president with the words "four more
years".

    The Sun doesn't deem it necessary to cover events
in the US until page
    six, preferring instead to plaster its cover with
the news that "pop
    hunk" Will Young has been burgled. Once it does
get down to business,
    in a double-page spread headed "Double-ya!", it
comes up with a list
    of jobs for John Kerry (ignoring the fact he has a
perfectly good
    position as a US senator), including "Jimmy Hill
chin double" and
    "Scotland footie boss - they are used to losers".

    A page later and Sun commentator Richard
Littlejohn is in triumphal
    mood. "Michael Moore, Osama bin Laden, Saddam
Hussein, Jacques
    Chirac, Gerhard Schroeder, Kofi Annan, Yasser
Arafat, the BBC,
    Guardianistas, Channel 4 News, Robin Cook, Clare
Short, most of the
    parliamentary Labour party, half the Tory party,
Charlie Kennedy,
    your boy took one hell of a beating", he gloats.

    Every pundit, of course, has plenty of advice for
Mr Bush about how he
    should spend the next four years. A Times leader
urges him to use his
    powerful mandate as an "extraordinary opportunity"
to "advance an
    imaginative agenda for himself and his party",
including launching a
    new Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

    The Middle East is uppermost in the British prime
minister's mind, at
    least. Mr Blair defended his relationship with
America last night and
    said that the peace process is the single most
important challenge
    facing the world, "remarks not echoed in George
Bush's own acceptance
    speech", the Guardian notes.

    The Independent's Steve Richards posits that Mr
Blair must be keeping
    his fingers crossed that his Texan friend's
foreign policy ambitions
    do not lie elsewhere - namely, Iran. "If a newly
self-confident
    President Bush were to contemplate an attack on
another rogue state,
    Mr Blair would be placed in an impossible
position." Max Hastings in
    the Mail is worried. "Who is likely to believe any
warning about the
    threat posed by an Iranian bomb if it is signed by
George W Bush and
    his friend Tony?" he asks.

    Other writers consider the fate of the losers.
Former Democratic
    presidential candidate Gary Hart, writing in the
Independent,
    concludes that his party has "yet to convince the
majority of
    Americans that it understands the threats and
dangers, some real,
    some perceived, of the new century", while the
former Clinton adviser
    Sidney Blumenthal says that, in the aftermath of
the result, "the
    Democrats will form their ritual circular firing
squad of
    recriminations".

    Anatole Kaletsky's words in the Times may provide
some comfort for Mr
    Kerry, claiming that his loss in 2004 could set
the Republicans up
    for a disastrous four years in power, allowing
them to reunite around
    a new leader.

    That new leader, according to Gavin Esler in the
Mail, is Hillary
    Clinton. "You might like to make to make a note of
today's date. It
    is Day One of the Hillary 2008 campaign", he
writes in the Mail. It's
    widely agreed among Democrats that Mrs Clinton is
"the leading figure
    to challenge the Republicans in 2008", possibly
with the charismatic
    black senator Barack Obama as her running mate. Mr
Obama - ("the son
    of a white woman from Kansas and a former goat
herd from Kenya")
    provided "one bright spot on a night of
unremitting gloom for the
    Democrats" by securing a landslide victory in
Illinois, notes the
    Telegraph.

    But who could her opponent be? The Mirror thinks
the most likely
    candidate is former New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani.
But the Times
    thinks it will be a family affair in a piece
headlined: "Hillary v
    Jeb: the grudge match for 2008?"

    KARZAI DULY ELECTED

    With most media eyes focused on America, the news
that Hamid Karzai
    has been confirmed as Afghanistan's first elected
leader only appears
    in the papers' peripheral vision. The Guardian
leads its
    international pages with the news, stating that
Karzai's 55% majority
    win will "intensify pressure for a crackdown on
Afghanistan's
    warlord-driven drugs boom".

    "It is still not clear if Mr Karzai's nearest
rival, the Tajik leader
    and former education minister Younus Qanooni, who
won 16% of the
    vote, has accepted the result", notes the
Telegraph.

    Karzai's victory has been overshadowed by the
kidnapping of three UN
    election workers the militant group
Jaish-e-Muslimeen. Militants
    holding Annetta Flanigan, from Northern Ireland,
and two fellow
    election officials - a Filipino and a Kosovan -
extended their
    deadline until 2pm on Friday. The group is
demanding the withdrawal
    of British and American troops from Afghanistan,
and the release of
    all Muslim prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, in Cuba.

    RUUD RUNS RIOT

    Man Utd striker Ruud van Nistelrooy dominates the
sports pages for
    happier reasons today after his four goals gave
his side to a 4-1 win
    over Sparta Prague in the Champions League at Old
Trafford last
    night. The Dutch striker has been attracting the
wrong kind of
    headlines recently for stamping on Arsenal's
Ashley Cole and is
    serving a domestic ban.

    Last night Sir Alex Ferguson hailed him as the
"most clinical
    finisher" in the club's history. It "scarcely"
mattered that he
    benefited from two atrocious backpasses and a
penalty for three of
    his goals, the Guardian says. The Mirror's
headline is "Anything Roo
    can do, Ruud can do better", referring to Wayne
Rooney's hat trick in
    the last European game at Old Trafford. Last
night's result "all but
    guarantees" Man Utd safe passage into the knockout
phase, the
    Guardian says.

    Liverpool also triumphed last night with an
impressive 0-1 win at
    Deportivo La Coruna and are in second place in
their Champions League
    group.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ~*ENCHANTER*~ THIS FRIDAY.November.5th($5/ALL AGES)(XTORT)*BSP*

I know I'm stirring up a bees nest here - but like - why would someone like 
Chris Jackson, who has been spinning forever, who has a foloowing, who owns 
a record label (or 3) need to submit a demo.

That is pretty fucking retarded. Now if say *I* bitched about your lineups 
(which I have, and think they're monochromatic and boring at best) and then 
you asked ME to submit a demo, I would understand, seeing as how I'm a 
relative n00b to the area, etc.

Seriously tho, that's silly.

Here's a taste...

First, let's make a distinction between neocons and true conservatives.

I don't think the neocons, represented by Bush and his administration, are 
traditional conservatives.  Right now, I'd much prefer an old-line 
conservative in office.  Traditional conservatives believed in the Bill of 
Rights and the constitution and are against the Patriot Act.  Traditional 
conservatives believe in small government, not the creation of a global 
imperial presence. Traditional conservatives believe in fiscal 
responsibility, not massive spending while cutting taxes.

The American Conservative views Bush as the new Caesar is about to destroy 
the Republic and create an imperial power.  The old Romans
asked Caesar to rule as a monarch;  so did neocon Republicans.

As Justin Raimondo a contributing editor of The American Conservative wrote 
recently:

"The Republican Party has become the party not just of big government, but 
of global government. If, as seems likely, the President follows the 
neo-conservative agenda and takes his war of "liberation" beyond Iraq -- 
Syria and Iran seem to be the next targets -- the transformation of the 
Republican Party will be complete: it will become the imperial party, 
albeit not without dissent from traditional small government conservatives."

The "moral values" issue is something to be as frightened of as the 
aftermath of the burning of the Reichstag.  The imperialist Republican 
party deliberately leveraged the fear of middle Americans, much as Hitler 
created fear of the Jews, to win the election.  I was raised in middle 
America and I should know better.  Ohio, West Virginia, and Western 
Pennsylvania for example used to be bastions of the Democratic party -- 
when the Democratic party represented labor and the values of the working 
class.

Well, there still is a working class but the current liberal elite has 
ignored them, and the neocons have pretty much eviscerated the labor 
unions.  These people don't pay $5.00 for a Starbucks latte;  they don't 
anguish over whitening their teeth (lucky to have all of 'em);  they drive 
battered old cars if they are lucky to own one, not high performance German 
vehicles or Hummers;  and they don't have expensive educations (most 
haven't graduated high school).  Do they hate gays and want to take away 
womens' choice?  Not really.  But all they have is their church and 
families and the Republicans have skillfully created the fear in these 
folks that they would lose these precious things if the Democrats, the 
horrifying "liberals" who once helped their fathers and grandfathers get a 
five-day, eight hour work day, took office.  Shame on the neocons, and 
shame on the Democrats for abandoning a populist, workers' 
platform.  Perhaps we've all lived on the two coasts for too long:)

These days I'm building alliances with old conservatives, labor oriented 
progressives as well as progressive Christians for whom abortion and gay 
rights are minor issues in a world where greed and violence run 
rampant.  The Democratic party is in shambles because it abandoned its 
ideals.  Time to create something new, and a values system that's not based 
on "selfishness will save the world" economics.

Love,

Apollo

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

SPECTRAL RECORD RELEASE PARTY
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

JEFF SAMUEL [DJ] - SEATTLE, WA

Jeff Samuel's foray into electronic music began in 1995 when he first
witnessed a DJ set by Detroit's Claude Young in Columbus, Ohio. He was
then introduced to that city's ele_mental collective, an inspiring core of
artists which included Ohio artists Titonton Duvante, the Archetype and
Todd Sines among others. Through their concept-oriented events which
showcased the finer points of electronic music, he became enthralled and
began to DJ in 1996. Soon after, he purchased his first synth and drum
machine.

While attending college in 1997, Jeff began exploring the possibilities of
software-based music production where he saw greater possibilities for
creativity and workflow. He encountered much scrutiny for attempting to
make techno using only a computer. Nevertheless, by 1998 he had started to
create his own completed tracks using an early version of Fruityloops (now
FL Studio). Music from his first demo was signed to the German label Lo-fi
Stereo. The "Bidooba" single was released in 1999 and featured a remix
from Kompakt's Michael Mayer. Other tracks from the same demo found their
way to minimal techno pioneer Daniel Bell, who released them on his 7th
City label in 2001.

Jeff pushed into the new millennium continuing his DJ career, releasing
more music and completing his college degree in Audio Production
simultaneously. 2002 proved to be a significant year which saw his
'Digital Self' Tektite EP remixed by Ricardo Villalobos, his abstract
material released by UK label Emoticon, and the beginning of a long
relationship with Cologne-based Trapez Recordings. He also left Ohio for
the western port city of Seattle, where he pursued a career as a Sound
Designer in the videogame industry.

Today, Jeff Samuel is a sought-after remixer with a heavy DJ and
production schedule who still finds the time to make SFX for videogames.
His records are played by a diverse range of the world's most talented
DJ's including: Richie Hawtin, Sven Vath, Ricardo Villalobos, Francois K,
Steve Bug, Akufen, Craig Richards, Mazi, Claude Young, Timo Maas, Josh
Wink, Electric Indigo, Michael Mayer and John Tejada. He is also currently
the only American DJ represented by the elusive Kompakt organization.

BROKER/DEALER [LIVE] - SAN FRANCISCO, CA

Equipped with an array of samplers, sequencers and vintage synthesizers,
San Francisco wunderkinds Broker/Dealer make catchy minimal electronic
music equally suited for the den or the dancefloor. Simultaneously
channeling the aquatic dub of Berlin's Chain Reaction label and the
genre-defining minimal techno of the Kompakt imprint, on their debut
full-length, Initial Public Offering, B/D recalls German electronic
artists like Mike Ink, not to mention Metro Area's innovative
electro-disco.

After cooling off from last years full-length record on Asphodel,
Broker/Dealer comes back with something a bit more for the dance floor on
their new 12" single on Ghostly's Spectral label. The duo will perform a
special live set in honor of the release along with celebrating the
Dealer's 30th birthday!

did i post this already? i can't remember.

flickr is a neat photo sharing website. it's really handy if you have a
digicam and either don't know html or don't have time to create webpages.
it has a tool where you can automatically click pictures you're looking at
on a website to add them.

it's still in beta and they give you additional space if you can convince
other suckas to try it, so if you're willing to be a victim, reply back
privately and i'll send you an invite. ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ~*ENCHANTER*~ THIS FRIDAY.November.5th($5/ALL AGES)(XTORT)*BSP*

It's the age old "Buffer zone" it is just an excuse for a promoter to 
politely say NO to you playing there party. Perfect example I have played 
for every major party promoter in the bay area with the exception of about 3 
or so.. so obviously if im good enough to play at a skillz,F-8,Harmony,quest 
etc.. party then im good enough to play at "Said promoters" lil event. But 
they ask for a demo anyway. I understand at that point the promter is just 
giving you lip service. For all the demo's that I have sent out I have only 
maybe got 1 booking out of it.

Or if you point them to a website that has mutiple sets of yours then they 
come up with an excuse about not having a stable internet connection etc..

Subject: RE: [sfraves] !! new.musik.from.innocentchild !!

I have heard about ryan working on music for sometime now and have been 
waiting for this day.

BT watch out cause I think we have another sonambulist on our hands here!

Sounds good structure wise and the sample isn't bad but I would kill that 
gnarly lead synth for something a bit "lighter" since the track sounds like 
it could be headed towards that spaced out Vocal prog house or trance it's a 
very transitional type sound.

Good first bit don't forget to release the full version when your done.

That's funny...

Man, I can honestly say I haven't even given out any demos to get bookings, 
yet have still managed to get them. Numerous ones even.

I can understand WHY people would want one of you were an unknown tho - but 
an established DJ/producer? Hardly seems neccessary...lip service is about 
right.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr new map of us

Excuse me, but wait one damn minute....

If I choose to have sex with another consenting guy, no one else in the 
world is harmed.

If a piece of hot lead tears through my flesh, rips up muscles and 
organs on the way, possibly comes to rest inside my body, and lets out 
more blood than I'm prepared to lose; I am most definitely harmed.

See the difference?

john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] !! new.musik.from.innocentchild !!

If I cut the filter cutoff level on that synth lead it loses some of the 
grit I'm trying to keep in there. Tends to get too far into the fluffy 
range. It's actually intended to be more of something you're going to hear 
in a mitsubishi commercial or some telco's youth targeted advertising in 
sound. I want a bittersweet sound. Bubblegum pop at the core, but smacked 
around so that it becomes more somber. BT, yeah right. Maybe if I had gone 
to Berklee School of Music like I originally intended to back in the day...

http://www.sninesix.com/music/sninesix%20-%20hellifiknow.mp3 - unfinished 
breaks track
http://www.sninesix.com/music/sninesix%20-%20mdf.mp3 - unfinished slow 
progressive track

See a pattern here? Nothing ever finished...

A lot of Bush haters are United States citizens. Many feel they must now 
leave their country and renounce their citizenship, and feel trapped that 
they can't. Many Bush supporters are taking glee in encouraging them to do 
so, knowing full well many have no options for emigration. The problem is 
both "liberals" and "conservatives" have forgotten the United States is 
about much more than "democracy". It is about a laboratory of the States 
within which migration and eminent domain support the pursuit of happiness 
by providing a mutual defense system for peoples experimenting with their 
own widely varying belief systems.


1d92756.jpg
  In the wake of candidate Kerry's concession of defeat to Bush, many 
United States citizens believe they must migrate out of the United States, 
if not renounce their citizenships. The Senate is now even more dominated 
by Republicans. In 11 States, propositions to ban gay marriage were on the 
ballot, and in all 11 States gay marriage was banned. Many liberals are 
rightly concerned that the central government is going to turn against them 
and impose upon them uniform laws, applicable to all States, that are 
hostile to their pursuit of happiness.

Now is the time for liberals to reflect on the association between liberal 
policies and the centralization of powers that began in the Civil War. Is 
there a limit to the degree to which central government should uniformly 
govern all States? Should the United Nations ultimately take on the role of 
legislating uniform rules for all countries?

Usually, the answer to these questions are disturbingly totalitarian when 
coming from supposedly "liberal" people. Their success in getting central 
governments to support their views has shielded them from the structural 
problems with such centralization. However, now that both plebiscites (in 
the form of ballot propositions) and the highest voter turnout in US 
history has shown "democracy" can turn against liberal policies -- liberals 
can reflect and become enlightened as to the real nature of what has been 
called The American Experiment.

The Civil War, while a victory of self-determination of individual slaves, 
was a disaster for self-determination of groups of like mind -- "religion" 
as intended by the First Amendment. The federal government took on a role 
that was feared by the founders -- the arbitrer of differing beliefs among 
peoples rather than facilitating the pursuit of happiness by peoples of 
differing beliefs.

This failure of the intent of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of 
religion is coming home to roost against the liberal way of life. There is 
increasing danger that uniform Federal statutes will impose fundamentalist 
Christian ideology uniformly across all States. The gambit of using the 
federal government to impose liberal policies has worked for decades but 
the simple mathematics of reproduction is that white liberals have trouble 
reproducing and cannot easily recruit new liberals from white families that 
have reproduced under Federal imposition of liberal policies.

Demography is destiny.

Now it is true that within a few decades it may be the case that the higher 
reproduction rates of other ethnicities, prone to vote Democratic, will 
outstrip the fecundity of fundamentalist Christian whites -- but this too 
could backfire. Hispanics are the fastest growing ethnic group and they are 
largely Catholic. Despite the fact that they continue to vote Democratic, 
not only might they never fully convert to liberal politics -- there is a 
very real chance they may succeed in shifting the Democratic party toward 
the right on issues such as abortion and homosexuality. Liberals have to 
ask themselves whether this deal with the devil of central power is worth 
the dangers to liberal ideology.

There must be a libertarian State, as many wish New Hampshire to become.

There must be a fundamentalist Christian state, as many wish South Carolina 
(the State with the highest per capita African American population) to become.

There must be a <http://www.bartleby.com/61/50/P0045000.html>panmixia 
state, as New York is becoming.

There must be ethnostates, as 
<http://vdare.com/misc/macdonald_041027_immigration.htm>Europe, 
<http://clusty.com/search?query=jewish+ethnicity>Israel and the 
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1555914985>Amerindian reservations 
could still support.

There must be an east-west hybrid state as parts of Hawaii are becoming 
(with some islands reserved for indigenous Hawaiians).

There must be a "politically correct" state as California has become.

There must be a frontier for 
<http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/s_z/smith.htm>misfits, 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Rutan>adventurers and downright 
<http://clusty.com/search?v%3asources=webplus&query=transhumanism&>dangerous 
experiments -- as the <http://www.geocities.com/jim_bowery/ecoag.html>ocean 
deserts and <http://members.aol.com/oscarcombs/spacsetl.htm>space could be 
if interference with claims were prevented.

And even these aren't enough.

The problem is that all of these things represent true diversity which is 
the enemy of those who, in their profoundly destructive hypocrisy, equate 
"diversity" with intimate integration of diverse people within governments 
that cannot limit their interference in people's pursuit of happiness.

The fundamental conflict is between democracy as dispute processing and 
migration as dispute processing. Migration is superior, so long as eminent 
domain compensation applies, for the simple reason that it allows self 
determination for all value systems -- not just value systems that can 
produce the most invasive voters world wide.

The practicalities of eminent domain displacement are always problematic, 
but people do survive and the system does enhance the general welfare. More 
problematic than eminent domain itself is the general issue of natural 
habitat destruction due to humans. Human diversity should be valued but so 
should general biodiversity. How this tradeoff should work is beyond the 
scope of this essay, but suffice to say that human population, with the 
assistance of technology, should increasingly migrate to environments of 
less natural biodiversity. Humans should be subject to the eminence of the 
natural domain, so to speak, as they become more adept at life support 
technology and can increasingly migrate to otherwise lifeless environments.

As for me, even if much greater limits were placed on federal power, I 
expect I would renounce my United States citizenship and either (if Europe 
could support ethnostates by fending off the demographic shift to Islam and 
other migration-induced panmixia) repatriate to one of the North Sea states 
of Europe or invest my remaining years in opening up one of the frontier 
states. This would be my pursuit of happiness.

Can you pursue happiness without, like Christian or Islamic theocrats, 
imposing your value system on others?

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr new map of us

I already said time and again that this is not a evangelical Christian
Reconstructionist/Dominionist takeover. Evagelical Christians are only
30% of the US population.

It's about the neocon's ability to manipulate average Christian voters.

Cathloics (account for 20% of US population) do not believe being gay
is a choice and a God-given condition that can't be changed.

30% of all Catholics and mainline Protestants believe gays should be
able to marry. in line with US populist opinion (about 30% of all
Americans think gays should be able to get married). Most of Catholics
and mainline Protestants do not believe that church and religion
should be a part of politics and legal system, the fear they have
about gay marriage is one about traditions, not religion. Most of
these mainstream, progressive Christians also believe that gay
partners should have equal benefits as married couples

I agree that the Democrats are losing touch with the working class,
and so are the neocons.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: guns

	The comparison wasn't between gay marriage and receiving a bullet 
wound; it was between gay marriage and gun ownership. Now sex may be a 
natural part of marriage, but getting shot is not a natural part of 
owning a gun. In fact, many people own guns in order to *decrease* 
their chances of getting shot or otherwise becoming a victim of violent 
crime.

	Based on the crime rates, their choice appears to be working. The over 
30 states that have passed laws allowing concealed carrying of handguns 
have seen annual reductions in the rates of murder, rape, and robbery 
since passing those laws (see 
http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/493636.html ).

	But for anyone who opposes gun rights and believes that gun ownership 
does not reduce crime, I've seen a suggestion for an easy way to 
personally stand up and advertise your beliefs: Put a sticker or sign 
on the door of your home with a picture of a gun and a slash through 
it, along with the words "GUN-FREE HOUSEHOLD."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: guns

Let's pretend this is Jeopardy for a minute.

Here's the answer:
It's one of the most population-dense areas on the planet; a city with 
a permanent population of twelve million people, a daytime population 
of fifteen million, and the center of a metropolitan area that easily 
tops twenty million.  Yet, in this city, you can pick the roughest of 
the rough neighborhoods, and walk down the street at any time of day or 
night with so little worry about the safety of your person or 
belongings, that the thought will probably never enter your mind.

+++Game show music plays for 30 seconds+++

Here's the question:
What is Tokyo?


Now, have a look at the hoops you have to go through to own a gun in 
Japan, even a rinky-dink little air pistol:

http://yarchive.net/gun/politics/japan_gun.html

It makes the UK's (for example) gun control laws look like a cake-walk 
in comparison, and our own, even in a place like San Francisco, 
positively neolithic.  Yet the violent crime rate in Japan is one of 
the lowest in the world.  Now, not being a statistician, I'm not going 
to try to claim that the ONLY reason Japan is so safe is the lack of 
availability of guns.  But the example, especially that of Tokyo itself 
(Large, densely packed,  cities being generally the areas of highest 
crime (violent, property, white collar, or otherwise) in ANY country), 
certainly disproves those silly notions that gun control increases 
crime or that an armed populace reduces it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: guns

ok, im sorry, but that is bullshit.  

the bottom line: guns are designed to shoot bullets
into things.  

whether or not every gun owner intends to inflict
bodily harm on someone, guns are now, and always have
been designed to shoot things, and largely those things
are living creatures... 

in statistical research, one of the first things you
learn is that statistics can be manipulated very easily
to support the wishes of the researchers... 

and second, you learn about things called confounding
variables... there are so many other things that can
have a result on your findings... the golden rule of
statistical research: correlation does not equal
causation...

or to dumb it down, just because there have been laws
that allow for ownership of a concealed weapon does not
mean it *caused* the decrease in in crime. implying so
is irresponsible and playing to the ignorance and
stupidity of average voter. 

love and hugs and kisses,
tina

*snort spit*

Naw c'mon man - we's need our guns so's we kin pre-tect ourse'ves from them
dern heathen Islamuslims types, and them there non-white folks -
YEEEEEEEEEEHAAWW!

LOL. Sorry - had to!

Guns are fun to shoot at targets, but beyond that - I don't see many
practical applications for them in this country in the hands of the general
populace. I think if one of the things they did when you tried to buy a gun
was give you a required psych test - a whole lot less people would be
allowed to own em ;)

Malvert pee red.

     What, I don't understand is why hasn't anyone tried to assassinate George and the Vice President.  
 Remember the 70' and 80's, when people where more aware of the political changes and when Ecstasy was legal for Marriage counseling.
     Since the 1960's the Republicans have had their nasty little hands in the media machine..........."Let's see how many distraction's we can create, so that people are not interested in politics anymore"
Thanks to Reality television, violent computer games and mainstream fashion.......etc.
What a mess..............(What can I do to help stop this)
Doesn't the constitution say, somewhere that Religion should not play a part in who the American people vote for....................It apparently does play a BIG BIG role.......
(Narrow minded people seem to vote for the very right winged Christians)
DAMN!!!!!!!!!       IT's no wonder there aren't more suicides.......
That's why I love E................Once in a while.   Don't want to fry my brain out to soon.....
I love to fill squishy and silly and hide under my snowman blanket,...........MEOW!!!!!!!!
Thank you for reading this and allowing me to vent.........

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ~*ENCHANTER*~ THIS FRIDAY.November.5th($5/ALL AGES)(XTORT)*BSP*

Macadio, I'm not giving you lip service...I'm telling
I've never heard you. Just because you've played big
crews doesn't justify you getting booked at our
"small" events. I don't book people I haven't
heard...sorry if that sounds like lip service. I've
played Skills, F-8, Coolworld, and "small" events and
honestly I wouldn't expect anyone to book me because
of that...especially if they haven't heard or don't
like my music.

Also Van, most people will book on the merits alone
too...no problem there, but just because we choose to
do it a different way doesn't make it wrong. If we
didn't have people come to our events, we wouldn't be
around...so whether you like the formula or not, it
works. Inexpensive and full of good djs (your opinion
will most likely differ).

Best wishes and good luck on the label stuff Chris

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
the satalite sent down a signal that it had retreived from a spiral galaxy about 4.599870 light years away....the signal once read colored everything red, and suddenly, it was all red in the minds of the living. :)

so you're saying social / cultural factors make a difference?  heavens 
forbid, no!  (libertarians don't get that because they don't
understand psychology).   Canada has lots of guns, more than America (?) 
and their level of violence is lower (but they're nicer;
as we all know, Americans tend to be loud, noisy, self-absorbed, 
excessively self-individualistic, and are immersed in a culture
that glorifies violence, so guns or no guns, I think America would have a 
high level of violent crime relative to the rest of the
civilized world no matter what)

To be fair, I didn't mean the media establishment as a whole was
conservative-leaning--I was referring to the portion of the overall
media establishment that happens to be more conservative.

I still don't see the liberal bias. I don't necessarily want a media
that agrees with me, but I do expect them to report facts and come to
logical conclusions based on them. That's probably too much to expect
because the mainstream media has always failed to do so, but the past 4
years have shown a reckless disregard for objectivity. Fox News is
gaining in popularity, and the other big networks have picked up on
their style. Sinclair Broadcasting is another example of media
partisanship that is completely unrivaled on the left. What's sad is
that the left has had to create their own media outlets JUST to refute
the distortions of the right. There's no over-arching message for them
to convey except that Republicans are more evil than Democrats.

Except their fear is totally unwarranted. They're afraid people will
take away their guns completely, while the reality is that a great deal
of reasonable people think they just shouldn't be able to own assault
weapons.

Funny. What's sad is that these people seem just as unreasonable about
gun control as anyone else:

"Some politicians think that the Second Amendment is obsolete. Some
politicians think that the Second Amendment is for duck hunters and
competitive shooters. But one presidential candidate knows who the
Second Amendment is for: Everyone, especially those who, disarmed, face
victimization."

Yes, there are some people who want to ban handguns altogether. I
respectfully disagree with them. I just don't want anyone to be able to
carry fully automatic weapons with gigantic magazines, and most
lawmakers agree with me.

I assume you're talking about the 2nd Amendment, so I'll let that slide.

Rightly so. Clinton was moderate on many issues, so the right needed an
issue around which to rally their constituency. Hence the animosity
toward the Brady Bill, and the irrational fear that Democrats were going
to storm through people's doors and take away their guns. It turns out
the law did actually prevent the sale of hundreds of thousands of guns
to convicted felons. I see that as the successful application of totally
reasonable gun control legislation.

I totally agree. I was soft on Kerry from the beginning, and I think we
could have had a much more honest election with Dean or Kucinich as the
candidate. I doubt that either of them would have been any more viable
in the midwest or the south though...

Nope, and frankly it doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me. The
government closed the road at the behest of a trout farmer because
development was killing his crops, and he claimed protection under the
Endangered Species Act. Timber companies and residents wanted the road
open for their own reasons, so they went out and dug it up themselves.
Score one against the socialist trout farmers!

I would argue that divorcing the dollar from the gold standard *helps*
government fight inflation by countering market meltdowns. But that's a
completely tangential discussion...

The last page shows exactly what I was talking about. The top 1% of
taxpayers received 25% of the cut, and the lowest 20% received 10%. So
if there were 100 taxpayers, and the tax cut doled out $1000 in total,
the poorest 20 would receive $5 apiece, while the single richest person
would get $250.

We have what the President would call a "fundamental difference of
opinion." We're the richest nation in the world, yet as individuals we
pay the second *least* in taxes as a percentage of GDP. 40% of the
nation's wealth is controlled by 2% of its citizens. With respect to
taxation as it relates to income, we have the most regressive tax policy
on earth; the poor and middle class have the highest tax burden. Both
the payroll and per-unit taxes like those on property affect the middle
and lower classes a great deal more than the upper class. And for what
it's worth, I agree: we should abolish the sales tax. It is a
fundamentally regressive tax that hurts the people who make the least
the most.

I think that people should have to pay to live in a country that affords
them such wealth. In fact, it's in their interest: better roads help
people get to work more quickly. Better healthcare keeps them from
having to take sick days. Labor regulations prevent them from being
injured (or killed) on the job. Nearly everything that their tax dollars
fund increases the likelihood that they'll have a more healthy,
intelligent, and able workforce to do the jobs that need to be done. But
our ridiculously complex tax system has produced so many loopholes that
many very wealthy people pay no taxes whatsoever, leaving people like
you and me to fund many programs that don't affect us at all.

To make matters worse, Bush's irresponsible tax cuts haven't put a
single dollar back in most people's pockets. Less federal tax revenue
starves states and municipalities for funding, so local property, sales,
and parcel taxes increase. The rising cost of healthcare *alone* has
offset any cut that middle and lower class taxpayers hoped to receive.
And don't even get me started on the corporate welfare this
administration has enacted in the form of subsidies, corporate tax
breaks, pork-barrell giveaways, etc.

Let me explain why I did that: there's a fundamental economic concept
called the "utility of the dollar", which refers to the usefulness of a
single dollar as it relates to overall income. For people that make less
than $20,000 per year, $98 is much less useful than $85,000 given to
somebody who makes more than $518,000 per year. Granted, a good deal of
that tax cut at the very top went to people that make MUCH more than
half a million per year. But the fact remains that the people that
needed a tax cut the most received the least of it.

Trickle-down economics doesn't work. Corporate America proved it wrong
by socking away all their money in offshore bank accounts and the stock
market, which remains inaccessible to the lower and middle classes
because it's impossible to invest responsibly without paying lots of
money to brokers and professional investors. To make matters worse,
people that do get duped into investing their earned income in 401(k)s
and other schemes are essentially betting against themselves.

Say I invest $1000 in a fictional company called Foo Corp. The more
people that do the same, the more incentive Foo Corp.'s board has to
provide returns on the investment by increasing revenue. Unfortunately,
the most common methods of increasing revenue are cutting jobs (or
moving them overseas) and benefits. Executives that can make these tough
decisions on behalf of the board (the shareholders' representatives) are
rewarded substantially. (Today executive pay is 400 times more than that
of production workers, up from 42 times in 1982.) So Foo Corp. saves
$500 million by cutting jobs and employing call centers in India, gives
the CEO $100 million, and pays concessionary dividends to the
stockholders.

Meanwhile, I get a $300 tax cut and earn a whopping 10% return on my
investment, or $100. But my taxes increase because my state needs
additional funds for unemployment benefits, homeless relief, and
training workers for the "new economy". Eventually my (fictional)
employer wises up and decides that they don't need meticulate
open-source web developers like me when they can pay a group of Russians
half as much for a slapped-together ASP application. I take my money out
of Foo Corp. to pay the rent, but that doesn't affect them because they
have many other, more wealthy investors. I can whine about losing my job
all I want, but at the end of the day I'm fucked because my skills
aren't usefull in an corporate culture that prefers cheap, quick
solutions to quality and maintainability. To add insult to injury, I
have no redress whatsoever because I have no influence in the market
(e.g., money to invest).

This is, obviously, a hypothetical (if not somewhat hyperbolic) example.
But it's exactly what I see happening on a grand scale in this country,
and it makes me very sad that people defend tax cuts for the wealthy by
simply stating that they should be able to keep their money. It's not
their money: when I buy something on the open market, I expect that
money to be recycled into my local economy and aid society as a whole.
Instead I see every dollar that I spend or pay in taxes going to people
that already have tons and tons of money. There's no justice in that.

Recent numbers indicate that yes, they're creating jobs. But those jobs
pay less:

"But 57 percent of the group who had lost full-time jobs and found new
full-time work reported that they were now earning less than what they
earned in their old jobs. Indeed, about one-third of those with smaller
paychecks were being paid at least 20 percent less."

<http://money.cnn.com/2004/07/30/news/economy/displaced_workers/>

Sure, they're growing business. But on a large scale most people are
making less, while the very wealthy continue to make much more.

I'm all for that, but as I've said before I think that needs to be
balanced with making income taxes more progressive.

Um, no. You make the tax brackets more progressive by cutting taxes for
the lowest wage earners. A progressive tax *cut* is regressive because
it gives the least money to the bottom brackets.

Exactly. I would gladly pay more in taxes if I knew that my money was
being used effectively to lift people out of the lower class. It's in
everyone's best interest to eliminate the lower class altogether,
because that leaves more money for programs (or tax cuts, if you prefer)
that help everyone. Of course, if you're agaist welfare to begin with
I'm probably not making a very strong argument. :)

The Laffer Curve predicts that people will simply *work* less as their
tax rates increase--not that people who make gobs of money will evade
taxation because they're greedy. IMNSHO, this is a cultural issue that
needs to be addressed in this country. People need to decide whether or
not living in a country that allows such a ridiculous accumulation of
wealth is worth paying more in taxes so that the rest of us can get by.

That's because THEY'RE FUNDED. I would dare say that every important
government-assisted program in this country is consistently underfunded,
most obviously education. Of course private schools are more successful:
parents pay a good deal of money to get their kids out of the public
system, and if everyone could just agree to pay more for education we
wouldn't need private schools to pick up the slack. It's criminal how
poorly teachers are paid in this country, and that we're being forced to
cut arts and after-school programs because states and cities are starved
for funding.

Again, this comes down to a fundamental difference of opinion. I think
the private sector is incapable of providing essential services, and
that the only way to help people effectively is to use tax dollars to
fund programs with their interests held in higher regard than the
pursuit of profit. And while I unfortunately don't have any examples of
how this could work domestically, Naomi Klein's recent article in
Harper's about the Iraqi reconstruction serves as a dire warning for
flawed privatization schemes:

<http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6930.htm>

The lesson of this failure is that private corporations cannot be held
accountable without government intervention. Market forces alone aren't
strong enough to make the private sector submit to the public's wishes
when all the wealth is concentrated in the hands of very few people.

I attended 6 public schools and one private during my grade school
education. Some were good (Connecticut, Nebraska), some bad (Georgia,
Florida). The private school in Georgia was clearly the best, and I'd be
hard-pressed to disagree with you that our public school system is in
serious trouble. But I really think that we could make it better if
everyone just agreed to fully fund their childrens' education. The
problem is, not everyone can afford to send their children to private
schools. With privatization you'd merely be forced to choose between two
private schools based entirely on how much they cost. I don't think
that's a choice any parent should have to make.

Bzzt. Drugs are less expensive overseas primarily because they aren't
protected by copyrights and patents, and partially because other
governments are allowed to negotiate prices on a larger scale than HMOs
and insurance companies in the US. Drugs aren't cheaper in Canada
because Candadians can't afford the market price; they're cheaper
because their single-payer system is able to buy drugs in bulk.

A good deal of medical research is actually funded by the government
already, and performed in government-funded educational institutions.
Perhaps if drug companies decided to spend more on R&D than they do on
marketing, they wouldn't need to gouge us. The top seven drug companies
in the US have higher profit margins than any other industry in the
world. There's simply no way you can claim that they're starved for
research dollars or prohibited by regulation from making money. Of
course, there's no incentive for them to change the way they spend their
money if the "market" (inhibited in part by laws that prevent bulk
purchasing) has allowed them to rake in that kind of cash.

If big government is the only way to ensure that people are treated
fairly and humanely, yes. *That's* my priority. I think the weakness of
Libertarianism is the rabid obsession with shrinking government,
regardless of the deleterious effects it has on society as a whole.

Not really. I think it would be easy to balance personal freedom with
sensible governmental control that defends people from corporations, but
vitriol from both sides makes it seemingly impossible to find a middle
ground. A single-payer healthcare system does not produce a "police
state". Laws that prevent individuals and corporations alike from
polluting the environment do not produce a "police state". Regulations
that prevent industry from subjecting people to harsh working conditions
does not produce a "police state". Conversely, I would argue that
dissolving government and leaving people to fend for themselves would
necessitate a police state: anarchistic free market imbalance could
eventually lead to literal class warfare, and if the government takes
the side of corporations in that battle (as they consistently have under
Bush, and would under a Libertarian government), we're screwed.

Sorry, but reality is on my side. Numerous prominent de-regulation
schemes brought about recently have resulted in less choice and more
corporate control. The FCC's loosening of regulations has given
ClearChannel and other dominant media companies a near stranglehold on
both the national radio market *and* music event bookings. 75% of what
we watch on TV is controlled by just 5 media conglomerates. California's
energy de-regulation allowed Enron to manipulate the market by reducing
supply at the time demand was highest. Today we found out that the FDA
may have been negligent in monitoring the safety of Vioxx, an
anti-inflammatory that's been found to increase the risk of heart attack
and stroke. So don't tell me that removing regulations ("making it
easier and less expensive to do business") is going to give me more
choice, or encourage competition.

The free market loves monopolies; after all, it's a sure-fire way to
make gobs and gobs of money. Build up your business, buy out your
competitors, saturate the population with advertising and you're golden.
And with the media owned and operated by the same corporations hawking
goods and services to their audiences, there's no way for small
businesses to compete.

I'll be the first "liberal" to concede that a great deal of regulation
written into law is totally unnecessary, beauracratic, procedural
nonesense. But that doesn't mean that regulation is fundamentally
flawed. It simply means the lawmakers have spent too much time bickering
over minutiae and been unable to focus on producing laws that actually
defend people from industry.

I totally agree (except, of course, with the notion that it's wrong for
the government to aid seniors in the purchase of prescription drugs). If
the government would just allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices by
buying in bulk on a national scale, those drugs would be a LOT cheaper.

You know what, I'm all for Social Security reform; I'm just not sure

For what it's worth, "Just Facts" shows quite a slant toward exposing
hipocrisy on the left. For instance, the section on China foreign policy
fails to detail the CIA's support for opium drug lords in Burma while
they waged covert war on the People's Liberation Army. The section on

racism, rampant at the height of the Civil Rights movement. I can't

Sorry, that came out wrong. I'm opposed to defensive trade regulations.
I was merely pointing out that de-regulation in general allows industry
to take advantage of anyone--be it US citizens or the countries with
which we trade goods and services.

Again, this is a fundamental disagreement. I believe that paying taxes
is something you have to do if you want to take part in American life.
No, it's not written into the Constitution. But it's something that
people have come to except because they understand that their tax
dollars fund everything from the construction of the roads they drive on
to the inspection of the food they eat. Our system isn't perfect. But I
refuse to accept the notion that people should be allowed to hoard their
money and still take advantage of all the services that the rest of the
population's taxes pay for.

Why would the FDA want to scare people? If the danger is unproven, then
you have a point. So prove it false. It just seems strange to me that
the FDA would purposefully release a warning about mercury levels in
fish at the same time that the EPA was easing regulations on mercury
pollution. Hey, maybe if we didn't have either agency we'd be a lot
better off!</sarcasm>

Of course they should--within reason. Even people with ties to the tuna
industry can't escape the (potential) dangers of mercury poisoning.

That's not my decision to make, and that's WHY there's an FDA. We need
these agencies to study the dangers and determine whether or not the
combined cost of putting regulations in place, industry implementing
them, and their enforcement, are greater than the cost of allowing
indusry to harm people. Without these agencies (or with these agencies
headed up by former industry lobbyists) we're left to fend for
ourselves, and I think that's wrong.

WTF? Regulation isn't a "knee-jerk" attitude. It's a rational response
to the negative affects of industry on society.

Then, as I've suggested is the case with the Bush Administration, the
regulators aren't doing their job. That doesn't mean regulation is
inherently wrong.

Sorry, I really don't see it. Forum is completely balanced when the
guests don't flake--in fact, I've found myself screaming at the radio
sometimes because I thought they were giving too much time to
Republicans. Talk of The Nation regularly welcomes partisans from both
sides. Terry Gross is admittedly leftist, but she doesn't allow that to
get in the way of her interviews with people like William Kristol,
chairman of the PNAC and editor of the Weekly Standard.

Aw boo-hoo. What does that have to do with NPR?

I've tried listening to Rush. What I've heard is dishonest and
mean-spirited, and listening to that kind of program is not worth my
time.

I hear plenty of different viewpoints on NPR. I simply choose not to

I disagree. It may appear so because nobody else gets involved in these
discussions, but the big difference is that this is an open forum.
There's nothing like this in the mass media.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: guns

	It is true that Japan has both strict gun control and a low rate of 
violent crime. However this does not mean that there is a causal 
relationship between the two facts:

"More than gun control, more than the lack of criminal procedure 
safeguards, more than the authority of the police, it is the pervasive 
social controls of Japan that best explain the low crime rate. Other 
nations, such as the former Soviet Union, have had severe gun control, 
less criminal justice safeguards, and more unconstrained police forces 
than Japan. But the Soviets' crime rate was high and Japan's minuscule 
because Japan has the socially-accepted and internalised restraints on 
individual behaviour which the Soviets lack. While social controls fell 
and crime rose everywhere in the English-speaking world in the 1960s, 
social controls remained and crime fell in Japan."

(Source: http://www.guncite.com/journals/dkjgc.html )

	There is also the fact that while there are few violent crimes against 
others in Japan, there is a very high suicide rate. In fact there may 
even be a connection between these two circumstances. The essay above 
also includes the following:

"While the Japanese gun suicide rate is one-fiftieth of America's, the 
overall suicide rate is nearly twice as high as America's. Teenage 
suicide is 30 per cent more frequent in Japan than America. Every day 
in Japan, two Japanese under 20 years old kill themselves.

"Japan also suffers from double or multiple suicides, shinju. Parents 
bent on suicide take their children with them, at the rate of one per 
day, in oyako-shinju. In fact, 17 per cent of all Japanese officially 
defined as homicide victims are children killed by suicidal parents. 
One reason that the official Japanese homicide rate is so low is that 
if a Japanese woman slits her children's throats and then kills 
herself, police statistics sometimes record it as a family suicide, 
rather than a sensational murder. Thus, Japan's tight family 
structures, which keep the overall crime rate low, are not unalloyed 
blessings.

"Of the many reasons suggested by researchers for the high Japanese 
suicide rate, one of the most startling is weapons control. Japanese 
scholars Mamon Iga and Kichinosuke Tatai argue that one reason Japan 
has a suicide problem is that people have little sympathy for suicide 
victims. Iga and Tatai suggest that the lack of sympathy (and hence the 
lack of social will to deal with a high suicide rate) is based the 
Japanese' feelings of insecurity and consequent lack of empathy. They 
trace the lack of empathy to a 'dread of power'. That dread is caused 
in part by the awareness that a person cannot count on others for help 
against violence or against authority. In addition, say Iga and Tatai, 
the dread of power stems from the people being forbidden to possess 
swords or firearms for self-defense.

"Stated another way, firearms prohibition is part of a culture that 
subordinates the individual to society. When the individual finds 
himself not fitting into social expectations, self-destruction may 
often seem appropriate, since in a conflict between the individual and 
society, society is, by definition, always right. It is interesting to 
note that the overall violent death rates (counting both murders and 
suicides) in many of the developed countries are approximately the 
same. America has a high murder rate, but a relatively low suicide 
rate. Japan and Switzerland have very low murder rates, but suicide 
rates twice the American level. Seymour Martin Lipset notes the high 
suicide rates in Japan and western European countries and speculates 
that 'psychopaths there turn it on themselves'."

	So maybe in Japan, potential criminals are killing themselves instead 
of others. Isn't that a good thing? Not really. People who commit 
suicide tend to be social misfits and nonconformists. Although in a 
different society they might be more likely to become criminals, they 
might also be more likely to become ravers or members of the 
counterculture.

	My own ex-wife is Japanese. Although she had already been studying in 
the U.S. when I met her, I introduced her to the rave scene, Burning 
Man, drugs, etc. [I know, bad me...  8)  ] Anyway, after getting a full 
taste of American freedom, she came to find Japan so oppressive by 
comparison that she says she never wants to live there again, even 
though the rest of her family still does.

	Getting back to the original topic, the fact that Tokyo is the safest 
big city in the world cannot be attributed to disarming people -- it is 
much more complicated than that. If gun control laws were the 
explanation, then we would see similar laws reducing violent crime in 
the other places that have them, like the United States. But as 
documented in the article linked in my previous message, gun control 
laws have generally had exactly the opposite effect -- they have 
*increased* violent crime.

That one's easy: kill Bush and he becomes a martyr... and Cheney becomes

all this talk about guns ... hmm .... I noticed that Starchild got something 
like 16,000 votes for the Board of Education in SF. I know i'd be excited if 
16,000 people voted for me, for any office. 
However ... was this stance about guns publicized to the voters of SF? I can 
hardly imagine 16,000 people wanting somebody who is so anti-gun control 
having anything to do with the education of their kids. 
Male escort, ok ... Male escort with a gun belt ... hmmm I don't think they 
would go for it.

that the media is overall a conservative influence is the REACH that the
various conservative outlets have vs. the reach that the liberal outlets
have.  i.e. Fox news (aka. Faux News) is now the #1 tv news network.
And ABC, CBS, and NBC don't necessarily have a truly conservative bias
as they do a corporate bias.  And don't even think about viewing radio.

Nope!!  As a matter of count, maybe, but that doesn't mean anything.  An
EXTENSIVE study was done at Stanford recently (finished maybe 3 or 4
months ago) and I believe that what I mentioned above is what they
found.  I haven't seen full empirical data from it yet, but the process
seemed valid (using think-tank citings in weighing the extent of being
liberal or conservative.)  I asked whether they factored the subscriber
base in or not, or whether they counted an outlet that reached 10 people
the same as one that reached 10 million.  I haven't heard back (someone
at the station was part of the research team.)

Just like Jon Stewart pointed out.  It seems that these folks are too
concerned about getting invited to the dinner parties (and not rocking
the boat to get excluded) rather than being actual journalists!  (Bow
tie boy in the Crossfire Jon Stewart interview even mentioned dinner
parties.)

It might be wise to take a look at what's going on elsewhere in the
world regarding reserves.  Russia may be trying to pull a Reagan back on
us.

Evidence Mounts That The Vote Was Hacked
by Thom Hartmann


When I spoke with Jeff Fisher this morning (Saturday, November 06, 2004), 
the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from 
Florida's 16th District said he was waiting for the FBI to show up. Fisher 
has evidence, he says, not only that the Florida election was hacked, but 
of who hacked it and how. And not just this year, he said, but that these 
same people had previously hacked the Democratic primary race in 2002 so 
that Jeb Bush would not have to run against Janet Reno, who presented a 
real threat to Jeb, but instead against Bill McBride, who Jeb beat.

"It was practice for a national effort," Fisher told me.

And some believe evidence is accumulating that the national effort happened 
on November 2, 2004.

The State of Florida, for example, publishes a county-by-county record of 
votes cast and people registered to vote by party affiliation. Net denizen 
Kathy Dopp compiled the official state information into a table, available 
at http://ustogether.org/Florida_Election.htm, and noticed something startling.

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a

itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."

	Yeah, even though I predictably lost the race, the votes (19,345 and 
counting, as the absentee and provisional count trickles in) were 
encouraging! I know that most San Franciscans disagree with me about 
gun rights. The issue never came up during the campaign that I'm aware 
of, probably because there's little chance the board would vote to 
change policy on guns in the schools. But I made no secret of the fact 
that I'm a Libertarian, and our party's support for the Second 
Amendment is pretty common knowledge.

SATURDAY NOVEMBER 6TH 2004 POP at Rx Gallery - Every First Saturday

BROKER/DEALER [LIVE] - SAN FRANCISCO, CA

Equipped with an array of samplers, sequencers and vintage synthesizers,=20
San Francisco wunderkinds Broker/Dealer make catchy minimal electronic=20
music equally suited for the den or the dancefloor. Simultaneously=20
channeling the aquatic dub of Berlin's Chain Reaction label and the=20
genre-defining minimal techno of the Kompakt imprint, on their debut=20
full-length, Initial Public Offering, B/D recalls German electronic=20
artists like Mike Ink, not to mention Metro Area's innovative=20
electro-disco.

After cooling off from last years full-length record on Asphodel,=20
Broker/Dealer comes back with something a bit more for the dance floor on=
=20
their new 12" single on Ghostly's Spectral label. The duo will perform a=20
special live set in honor of the release along with celebrating the=20
Dealer's 30th birthday!


JEFF SAMUEL [DJ] - SEATTLE, WA

Jeff Samuel's foray into electronic music began in 1995 when he first=20
witnessed a DJ set by Detroit's Claude Young in Columbus, Ohio.  He was=20
then introduced to that city's ele_mental collective, an inspiring core of=
=20
artists which included Ohio artists Titonton Duvante, the Archetype and=20
Todd Sines among others.  Through their concept-oriented events which=20
showcased the finer points of electronic music, he became enthralled and=20
began to DJ in 1996.  Soon after, he purchased his first synth and drum=20
machine.

While attending college in 1997, Jeff began exploring the possibilities of=
=20
software-based music production where he saw greater possibilities for=20
creativity and workflow.  He encountered much scrutiny for attempting to=20
make techno using only a computer.  Nevertheless, by 1998 he had started=20
to create his own completed tracks using an early version of Fruityloops=20
(now FL Studio).  Music from his first demo was signed to the German label=
=20
Lo-fi Stereo.  The "Bidooba" single was released in 1999 and featured a=20
remix from Kompakt's Michael Mayer.  Other tracks from the same demo found=
=20
their way to minimal techno pioneer Daniel Bell, who released them on his=
=20
7th City label in 2001.

Jeff pushed into the new millennium continuing his DJ career, releasing=20
more music and completing his college degree in Audio Production=20
simultaneously.  2002 proved to be a significant year which saw his=20
'Digital Self' Tektite EP remixed by Ricardo Villalobos, his abstract=20
material released by UK label Emoticon, and the beginning of a long=20
relationship with Cologne-based Trapez Recordings.  He also left Ohio for=
=20
the western port city of Seattle, where he pursued a career as a Sound=20
Designer in the videogame industry.

Today, Jeff Samuel is a sought-after remixer with a heavy DJ and=20
production schedule who still finds the time to make SFX for videogames.=20
His records are played by a diverse range of the world's most talented=20
DJ's including: Richie Hawtin, Sven Vath, Ricardo Villalobos, Francois K,=
=20
Steve Bug, Akufen, Craig Richards, Mazi, Claude Young, Timo Maas, Josh=20
Wink, Electric Indigo, Michael Mayer and John Tejada.  He is also=20
currently the only American DJ represented by the elusive Kompakt=20
organization.

Friday, November 12, 2004 ** Lee Coombs - Breakfast of Champions **

In the history of SF underground parties, there is one party that has=20
become the after party to start all parties.  In the spirit of keeping=20
things fresh, fun and original, the Breakfast of Champions party was born.=
=20
It traditionally starts at 6AM, the first day of the year, with the intent=
=20
on keeping the party going for those that didn't want to stop.  A bus full=
=20
of Space Cowboys collected those filing out of the parties across San=20
Francisco, and brought them to BOC.  After a few New Years passing, the=20
party is proudly maintained by everyone who walks through the doors.

Of course this party would not be mentionable if it wasn't for the DJs=20
that have graced the decks.  Along with all the Space Cowboys DJs, we have=
=20
hosted several local & international superstars who saved their best for=20
last and played amazing sets at 9AM.  One of these DJs is Lee Coombs, from=
=20
the Fingerlickin' UK family.  His uniquely tuned styles of acid tinged,=20
bass driven breakbeats, have been the soundtrack to many a Space Cowboy=20
party.  He joined us in '02 & '04.  He proudly returns to San Francisco to=
=20
promote the 11/16/04 release of his new album entitled 'Breakfast of=20
Champions.'

We need say no more.  We're tickled pink.  And ready to rock.  Please join=
=20
us for a night with new music, old friends, at one of the undeniably best=
=20
sounding clubs in the city.

Loveworks Resident DJ Bio: MATT VALENZ In a world overtaken by automation=
=20
and technology, soul can be a hard thing to come by.  For someone lucky=20

=20
area, then moved on to start a career in the music business when he=20

Subject: [sfraves] Adam Freeland rejects raving Bush girls

Taken from :: THE DIVISION UNDERGROUND NEWSLETTER
:: GLOBAL NEWS ::

Adam Freeland rejects raving Bush girls

Outspoken British breaks star Adam Freeland found himself performing for
George W's notoriously fun-loving daughters Jenna and Barb at a US rave last
week and was horrified when he realized who they were.
"I was in Chicago playing a We Want Your Vote gig last Thursday night and
the promoter had told me that the Bush daughters might be there and I'd been
like 'yeah, whatever', said Adam.

"Then about an hour into my set I dropped 'We Want Your Soul', the vibe
picked up and a few new heads came onto the floor from the adjacent VIP
room, including one pissed up (drunk-slang Ed) girl who was jumping around,
pulling hard on a fag (cigarette), who was obviously a party girl," he
recalled.


"Then I saw her face and I got this weird deep sickly churning in my
stomach; she looked exactly like George W and I realized 'fuck', it is her;
George W's daughter going nuts to We Want Your Soul, miming the words," said
Adam.

"I felt like I'd seen the antichrist (not that I'm a Christian) but it was
fucking odd and strange and her sister was there with her too, though she
wasn't afflicted with looking like him," he continued. "If Bush dressed up
as a girl, he'd be his daughter. Poor fucking girl."


"I thought maybe I should go find her chat her up or something (it didn't
look like it'd be that tough), try to get her into bed just so I could
infiltrate her mind, infiltrate her family, change the world, or even just
tell my mates I'd shagged a Bush," Adam added.

"But I didn't," he laughed.

http://www.bushwatch.com/hold1.htm ('In St.-Tropez, Jenna partied with Sean
"P. Diddy" Combs. In New York, the twins sent one of their Secret Service
agents over to procure an introduction to rocker Chris Cornell, the front
man for the band Audioslave. The girls were not averse to showing up at
places where controlled substances were enjoyed . . .')

Bush bush...that's scary.  Guess they are not part of the new "moral 
majority."  Or, hell, maybe I've just misinterpreted the whole values thing.

Let's shag.  Party on.  Jesus rocks.  Lock and load.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Adam Freeland rejects raving Bush girls

Outspoken British breaks star Adam Freeland found himself performing for
George W's notoriously fun-loving daughters Jenna and Barb at a US rave last
week and was horrified when he realized who they were.
"I was in Chicago playing a We Want Your Vote gig last Thursday night and
the promoter had told me that the Bush daughters might be there and I'd been
like 'yeah, whatever', said Adam.

"Then about an hour into my set I dropped 'We Want Your Soul', the vibe
picked up and a few new heads came onto the floor from the adjacent VIP
room, including one pissed up (drunk-slang Ed) girl who was jumping around,
pulling hard on a fag (cigarette), who was obviously a party girl," he
recalled.


"Then I saw her face and I got this weird deep sickly churning in my
stomach; she looked exactly like George W and I realized 'fuck', it is her;
George W's daughter going nuts to We Want Your Soul, miming the words," said
Adam.

"I felt like I'd seen the antichrist (not that I'm a Christian) but it was
fucking odd and strange and her sister was there with her too, though she
wasn't afflicted with looking like him," he continued. "If Bush dressed up
as a girl, he'd be his daughter. Poor fucking girl."


"I thought maybe I should go find her chat her up or something (it didn't
look like it'd be that tough), try to get her into bed just so I could
infiltrate her mind, infiltrate her family, change the world, or even just
tell my mates I'd shagged a Bush," Adam added.

"But I didn't," he laughed.

http://www.bushwatch.com/hold1.htm ('In St.-Tropez, Jenna partied with Sean
"P. Diddy" Combs. In New York, the twins sent one of their Secret Service
agents over to procure an introduction to rocker Chris Cornell, the front
man for the band Audioslave. The girls were not averse to showing up at
places where controlled substances were enjoyed . . .')

Adam Freeland rejects raving Bush girls

Outspoken British breaks star Adam Freeland found himself performing for
George W's notoriously fun-loving daughters Jenna and Barb at a US rave last
week and was horrified when he realized who they were.
"I was in Chicago playing a We Want Your Vote gig last Thursday night and
the promoter had told me that the Bush daughters might be there and I'd been
like 'yeah, whatever', said Adam.

"Then about an hour into my set I dropped 'We Want Your Soul', the vibe
picked up and a few new heads came onto the floor from the adjacent VIP
room, including one pissed up (drunk-slang Ed) girl who was jumping around,
pulling hard on a fag (cigarette), who was obviously a party girl," he
recalled.


"Then I saw her face and I got this weird deep sickly churning in my
stomach; she looked exactly like George W and I realized 'fuck', it is her;
George W's daughter going nuts to We Want Your Soul, miming the words," said
Adam.

"I felt like I'd seen the antichrist (not that I'm a Christian) but it was
fucking odd and strange and her sister was there with her too, though she
wasn't afflicted with looking like him," he continued. "If Bush dressed up
as a girl, he'd be his daughter. Poor fucking girl."


"I thought maybe I should go find her chat her up or something (it didn't
look like it'd be that tough), try to get her into bed just so I could
infiltrate her mind, infiltrate her family, change the world, or even just
tell my mates I'd shagged a Bush," Adam added.

"But I didn't," he laughed.

To be fair, Jeff Samuel is first and foremost a kick-ass producer, so I
think it's a bit unfair to judge him by his DJ skills. That said, I was
*really* impressed with his set on Saturday. Rarely do I hear artists
that DJ that well, and it made me that much more a fan of someone whose
records I buy on sight anyway :)

But FWIW, he has one link to a set of his in Osaka a couple of months
ago on his own site:

<http://jeffsamuel.com/>

Broker/Dealer also rocked it. If you missed out, you'll have another
chance to hear Ryan and Ryan play next Tuesday (11/16) at Hugger-Mugger.
BSP forthcoming...

you've heard richie hawtin spin, yes?  sven vath is also pretty
decent (from what i remember) and the last time i saw carl cox
(in 2000) he fucking rocked it.

angie also told me that paul jokenfold is also an exceptional
DJ, but the last time i heard him, i was pretty fucked up and
was too busy screaming insults at him.  i think i called him a
monkey.  ;)  oh, wait, we're talking techno.  jokey is trance. 
er, "progressive house" i mean.  same difference.

hometown-wise, andyW, chris jackson, and praxis are all
exceptional producers and DJs.  ernie deaks is also pretty damn
good, altho i haven't seen him out as often.

Subject: [sfraves] Nrr: room for rent


Need a room?

Know someone looking for a place to live?

Our roommate, Jessica, is moving in with her boyfriend, so we have a room
available for rent on the island - that's Yerba Buena Island, thank you -
starting around October 15th (earlier if needed).

It's a medium sized bedroom in an otherwise ridiculously large place, with
this kind of view and at this price ($610 incl. utilities).  The view is to
die for, and we have a big outside deck to help us enjoy it!  (pictures at
the link below)

The roommates: Danny Picard, Katelyn Brod, and me, Beth Klem!
We're almost as cool as the view... well, at least the other two are :)
Everyone is really chill and easy to get along.  Danny and Katelyn work
nights, I work 9-5, so it's generally fairly quiet around here, though we do
throw big parties from time to time (with adv. notice, always).  Because of
the varied work schedules, we don't hang out as much as we'd like to, but we
get along famously and enjoy hanging out when we get a chance.

We would love to find another roommate who ends up feeling like family,
because that makes the house so much more pleasant to be in.  Note: we just
don't do drama.

I put the full ad online so you can get all the deets, including pictures:

You can reply to me,
Email us at ybi_roomie@yahoo.com
or call Beth(me) or Danny directly
Beth: (415) 350-9057
Danny: (415) 362-9284

EMERGENCY CALL TO ACTION!
VOTERGATE!!!

Are you anguished and enraged by the outcome of the Nov 2 election?  Are 
you following the growing mass of evidence of possible fraud and outright 
theft?  Lost votes, missing ballots, black-box machines with no paper 
trail, a clear pattern of intimidation of voters based on racial profiling, 
do you suspect a scandal bigger than Watergate and far more meaningful than 
Monica is being suppressed?

Was the 2004 election stolen?  Take action to defend democracy and demand 
an investigation into electoral fraud!

We can stay home and grumble and swear at the T.V. as Bush claims a 
mandate.  We can go to work as usual, and pretend nothing is wrong.  Or we 
can come out and take action.  Join us to protest the continuing 
disenfranchisement of African-American, Latino and student voters, to 
demand a suspension of the electoral college vote until there is a full and 
impartial investigation of all the irregularities, and to defend democracy.

Wednesday, November 10,
Noon
San Francisco Federal Building,
450 Golden Gate, plaza side,

Rally and nonviolent civil disobedience.

--We demand a thorough, impartial, and immediate investigation into 
electoral fraud, racially based suppression of voters, and a full count of 
all provisional and absentee ballots and 'spoiled' votes.
--We demand that the December 13 electoral college vote be suspended, if 
necessary, until these questions are resolved.  The legitimacy of our 
government is compromised when the integrity of our electoral system is in 
question,

Free and fair elections are the basis of a democratic government. When the 
integrity of the electoral system is in question, the government loses its 
legitimacy. No recount could be as destabilizing as the widespread 
suspicion that the Republicans have stolen a second election.

Here are just a few of the serious concerns that have arisen:

--Around the world, exit polls are used to verify that elections are free 
from fraud. Here in the US, polls in precincts using computer voting 
machines with no paper trail were consistently at odds with the reported 
outcome, while polls in precincts using paper ballots matched the outcome.
--In Ohio, adequate numbers of voting machines were not provided in African 
American and student neighborhoods, causing voters hours of waiting time at 
the polls.
--1,074 instances of voter intimidation were reported to the Election 
Protection Coalition.
--In Franklin County, Ohio, voting machines gave George Bush 3,893 votes in 
one precinct alone, far more than the number of registered voters. In 
Craven County, North Carolina, a software error gave Bush 11,283 extra 
votes,  In Broward County, Florida, voting machines were discovered to be 
counting backwards.
--In Ohio, the number of provisional ballots may be far higher than 
Secretary of State Blackwell claims.  Absentee and 'spoiled' ballots have 
not been counted­African American and Latino voters are far more likely to 
have their ballots discarded.
--Purging of supposed 'felons' in Florida and Colorado disproportionately 
targets communities of color and may violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
--The Diebold machines and central computer processors were never tested to 
assure that they could not be hacked by outsiders.
--And much, much more!

It's not too late!  The Watergate Scandal brought Nixon down long after he 
took office.  We can counter the false perception of Bush's 'mandate', push 
the mainstream media into covering these serious issues, maybe even put 
some spine into the Democrats, stand in alliance with youth and communities 
of color, and protect the integrity of our vote.  Fighting for fair 
elections is vital­for the present and the future!

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

If I'm going to see a kick ass producer spin records on a given night, I'm 
going to judge him on his DJ skills, because that's what I'm paying for.  
Seen too many producers recently that tank it on the decks, waste of my 
money.  Either practice and get good, stay in the studio, or take it out as 
a live PA.

Oakenfold sucks all that is sweaty balls live. Too much "I am Jesus the DJ" 
posing, and too many crappy "let me just fade one track into another" 
mixing.

He gets the "boo on you for being overrated" Dj of the milennium award.

Good techno DJ/producers I have seen:

Jeff Mills
Hawtin
John Aquaviva (so's he's housier - but godamn he rocks)
John Tejada - techno/tech-house - whatever - he rocks too!
Jon Williams
Sutekh
Carl Cox
The Liberator Brothers
Mistress Barbara - ok, so she's kinda commercial, but she rocked it every 
time I have seen her.

**Shudders**

http://kids.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaceskids/crafts/season3/craft02.html?ct=9799.1328693843

Record Bowls


You must have your parent's permission to do this craft. Never turn on the
oven or stove without your parent's permission. Set the timer so you don't
forget about the records in the oven ... you don't want to clean this up
if you forget and leave the records in for too long.

Materials:

Oven-safe bowl
Old record
Oven mitts
Oven timer
Oven


Step by Step

Step 1

Ask a parent to preheat the oven to about 200-250 degrees.
Choose the bowl you are going to use. Flip the bowl so it is bottom up.
Lay the record on the bowl. When the record heats up, it will begin to
mold to the shape of the bowl.
Step 2

Set your timer for 5 minutes and place the bowls with the records in the
oven.
Step 3

When the timer rings, check on the record. If it looks like it's melted,
turn off the oven. Ask a parent to put on the oven mitts and remove the
bowls. If it's not yet to your liking, set the timer for another 3
minutes. Do not keep the record in the oven for more than 10 minutes.
Remember to turn off the oven when you are done.
Step 4

If you have two of the same-shaped bowls, you can press the bowl down on
top of the other to bring a better shape to the record.
Let your new record bowl cool for about 10 minutes.
Step 5

Use your new record bowls for anything! Just remember they can't hold water.

Subject: [sfraves] jeff responds. was: short review of jeff samuel at pop on 
     friday... [sfraves] 


jeff asked me to forward this message for him.

---------------------------- Original Message ----------------------------
From:    "Jeff Samuel" <me@jeffsamuel.com>

Hi There,

I received a forward of this review so I thought I'd make a short response.

When I approached the decks the master fader on the mixer was all the way
up to 10 with the level completely red, the channel levels equally hot,
and the Mackie monitor to my right blown out.  This left me with the tiny
monitor to my left that was already clipping.  Given the fact that this
was an art gallery with no 'sound guy', I couldn't really have turned the
levels down and turned the house sound up.  So, I had to wing it.  I was
often spending too much time trying to hear myself to do much technical
wizardry of any kind.  But hey, you can't win em all.

I appreciate the response in my defense, but I actually consider myself a
DJ first and producer second as I've got twice the experience in the
former than I do in the latter.  You absolutely should judge me by my DJ
skills BUT under proper conditions.

In any case, I thank you for coming and dancing despite the weak laws in
CA! As previously mentioned, you can check my site for a partial mix
(actually the first 45 mins of a 3-hr set) that may suit you better.

All the best,

Jeff Samuel

Drum and Bass Tuesdays in Downtown Oakland

Yeah, you heard me. D&B in the 510, huge upstairs club with HUGE, HUGE 
sound. You have never heard bass like this. The club has a large wooden 
dance floor, pool table, stage and a patio so you can drink and smoke at 
the same time. Easy parking, 2 blocks from BART (last train to SF leaves 
at 12:48am), and no neighbors to bitch about how fucking loud we are!

Subject: [sfraves] more on jeff samuel review...

yeah, hearing about the technical problems makes me
much more forgiving and want to take back my
criticism.  (i saw his response on 313 late in the day
yesterday, as well.)  now i'm a little irritable that
there's top-notch techno folks (matthew dear,
christian bloch, etc.) playing at a club without a
sound person (or at least no sound person that night.)
 i'm going to be going to Rx gallery a lot, because
they've got folks playing there i want to see, but
that sucks.  i kind of miss techno stuff at club 6 (i
must be desperate), but i do think that Rx has
slightly better sound than club 6, at least when it's
not turned up all the way like telefon tel aviv 
did last week (and over half the dance floor cleared.)
 

anyway, i'm wishing i lived in portland this week -
deadbeat AND crackhaus are playing there on friday. 
if i'd only known earlier, i could'a gotten a cheap
flight.  as it is i'm still considering going, but
maybe that's just nuts.  Deadbeat is incredible
though.  ¿Porque no están pinchando en San Francisco?

Deadbeat would be quite welcome here... You KNOW there are some chill
stoner types that could get into the electronic dub thing if they just
had a chance to hear it!

> ?Porque no est?n pinchando en San Francisco? 

I have to admit, I'm surprised that Superpitcher and Ellen Allien are
going to be here in the next couple of weeks. I wouldn't blame people
for skipping over SF if they were given the choice of playing at Rx or a
big club in some other city. Blasthaus seriously needs to find a new
venue where they can get nice and loud.

Speaking of which, whatever happened to the SFMOMA parties?

Mixer questions, I am finally upgrading to a better mixer and I have been 
drooling over the DENON DNX1500,  has anyone played on one?  Any comments? Or just general comments about the new denon mixer line? 
Maybe I am trying to decide should I buy the dnx1500, tascam,  or the pioneer 500 or 600?  any comments or advice on the mid range price mixers?
Tomm

Now just stick a real engine in them and make them MOVE. 108hp. HAHAHAHA. Oh 
man. All the kids that think putting a stupid muffler on those and an intake 
will give them big gains in power... hahahahaha.

Looks wise I still kinda like them. But shit man. First thing I'd want done 
is more displacement and forced induction. I mean as it stands if you stick 
a supercharger on that thing you're only going to get like 140ish or so hp. 
Now toss in an obscene sound system setup like this and uh, yeah... you need 
more like 200+ hp.

Hey there,
I'm hoping folks remember that UpLift is going on again this Thursday.
Looks to be a meld of progressive stuff as well as some breaks thrown in
to make it properly sweaty (mmmmm, sweaty.)  Come console me about the
election last week, or ask Osteen what he thinks of the whole thing. :)
Or, better yet, congratulate me about the recent successes!!! :)


Lineup for the evening:

DJ/Producer Steve Osteen (www.tussinspace.com) (8p - 9:15p) (bug him to
play some originals!!)

DJ Will Spencer (ProgressionSF) (fresh off a gig with Paul van Dyk!) :)
(10:30p - 11:45p)

with Residents:

fLOORCRAfT (Hosstribe, Aurasf) (9:15p - 10:30p)

and me, J.C. (Epiphany, KZSU, Netamp, Aurasf) (11:45p - close)


Also an Art Show by: UpLift's Resident Artist Chris Fabbri and his
special guests

This month's Art Show will include:

Paper Collages by Chris Fabbri
(http://groups.msn.com/ChrisFabbriArtistPoetHomePage)

Subject: [sfraves] Mixmaster is right!!!

Of course you guys probably all already know this, but it's a nifty
lil interview with a nice lil demo of mixmaster mikes skills.  This
guy is insane!!!  Got to stand right behind him at last years
Cyberfest.  Looking right over his shoulder and seeing him live and in
action, i still couldn't believe what i was seeing.  I dont know how
the hell he keeps that needle in that groove so well with all that
scratching.  If you look in his lil falsh movie demo there on the page
you'll see him do this trick where he picks the record up at a 45
degree angle and is still scratching with it.  what the fuck is up
with that?  how the hell does he do it.  he truely is a vinyl genius
paving the way for the future of turntablism.

DJ Swamp does that shit too - it's sick. Last time I saw Swamp, he stacked 
up a bunch of records on the table, and then proceeded to scratch, break off 
part of a record, scratch with THAT, and repeat - working his way thru a 
melody using the various records in the stack.

Subject: [sfraves] What Kerry should have said...

"My fellow Americans, the people of this nation have spoken, and 
spoken with a clear voice. So I am here to offer my concession.   I
concede that I overestimated the intelligence of the American  people.
 Though the people disagree  with the President on almost every issue,
you saw fit to vote for him.

I never saw that coming.

That's really special. And I mean "special" in the sense that we use
it to describe those kids who ride the short school bus and find ways 
to injure themselves while eating pudding with rubber spoons. That 
kind of special.   I concede that I misjudged the power of hate.
That's pretty powerful  stuff, and I didn't see it.

So let me take a moment to congratulate the President's strategists:

 Putting the gay marriage amendments on the ballot in various swing
states like Ohio... well,  that was just genius. Genius.  > It got
people, a certain kind of people, to the polls. The  unprecedented
number of folks who showed up and cited "moral values" as their
biggest issue, those people changed history. The folks who consider
same sex marriage a more important issue than war, or  terrorism, or
the economy...

Who'd have thought the election would belong to them? Well, Karl Rove
did. Gotta give it up to him for that. Credit where it's due. I
concede that I put too much faith in America's youth With 8 out of 10
of you opposing the President, with your friends and classmates dying
daily in a war you disapprove of, with your future being  mortgaged to
pay for rich old peoples' tax breaks, you somehow managed to sit on
your asses and watch the Cartoon Network while aging homophobic
hillbillies carried the day. You voted with the exact same anemic
percentage that  you did in 2000. You suck.

Seriously, y'do.

There are some who would say that I sound bitter, that now is the time
for healing, to bring the nation together. Let me tell you a little
story.  Last night, I watched the returns come in with  some friends.
As the night progressed, people began to talk half-seriously about
secession, a red state / blue state split. The reasoning was this: We
in blue states produce the vast majority of the wealth in this country
and pay the most taxes, and you in the red states receive the majority
of the money from those taxes while complaining about 'em. We in the
blue states are the only ones who've been attacked by foreign
terrorists, yet you in the red states are gung ho to fight a war in
our name. We in the blue states produce the  entertainment that you
consume so greedily each day, while you in the  red states show open
disdain for us and our values. Blue state civilians are the actual
victims and targets of the war on terror,  while red state civilians
are the ones standing behind us and yelling  "Oh, yeah!? Bring it on!"

More than 40% of you Bush voters still believe that Saddam Hussein had
 something to do with 9/11. I'm impressed by that, truly I am. Your
sons and daughters who might die in this war know it's not true, the
people in the urban centers  where al Qaeda wants to attack know it's
not true, but those of you who are at practically no risk believe this
easy lie because you can.  As part of my concession speech, let me say
that I really envy that  luxury. I concede that.

Healing? We, the people at risk from terrorists, the people who
subsidize you, the people who speak in glowing and respectful terms 
about the heartland of America while that heartland insults and 
excoriates us... we wanted some healing. We spoke loud and clear. And
you refused to give it to us, largely because of your high moral
values. You knew better:  America doesn't need its  allies, doesn't
need to share the burden, doesn't need to unite the  world, doesn't
need to provide for its future. Hell no. Not when it's got a human
shield of pointy-headed, atheistic, unconfrontational breadwinners who
are willing to pay the bills and play nice in the vain hope of winning
a vote that we can never have. Because we're "morally inferior," I
suppose, we are supposed to respect your values while you insult ours.
And the big joke here is that for 20 years, we've done just that. 
It's not a "ha-ha" funny joke, I realize, but it's a joke all the
same.

As well as conceding the election today, I am also announcing my
candidacy for president in 2008.  And I make this pledge to you today:
THIS time, next time, there will  be no pandering. This time I will
run with all the open and joking  contempt for my opponents that our
President demonstrated towards the cradle of liberty, the Ivy League
intellectuals, the "media elite,"   and the "white-wine sippers." This
time I will not pretend that the  simple folk of America know just as
much as the people who devote  their lives to serving and studying the
nation and the world. They don't.

So that's why I'm asking for your vote in 2008, America. I'm talking
to you, you ignorant, slack-jawed yokels, you bible-thumping, inbred 
drones, you redneck, racist, chest-thumping, perennially duped
grade-school grads. Vote for me, because I know better, and I truly 
believe that I can help your smug, sorry asses.

Thank you, and may God, if he does in fact exist, bless each and every
one of you."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Mixmaster is right!!!

Really?  That's crazy, I saw Swamp play once up in Seattle (back in
like 97 or maybe 98), and i was watching him scratch and right at the
end of his set he went to take the record off the platter and it
snapped in half and he just kept on scratchin and scratchin....it was
kinda cool, cept for a couple of times the needle came off the the
record and would land on the scratch mat underneath and make a nasty
ass scratching sound which didnt sound too good.  And when he was done
he took the record off and threw it into the crowd.  One of the
promoters for the party had told me after words during tear down that
he was just trying to pull the record off the platter and it snagged
on the nipple and broke thr record and he got really mad and that's
why he just kept scratching with the broken record.  So i wonder if it
was really accidental and he got mad, and since developed this broken
record technique from that instance, or if he really meant to break
the record and scratch with it.  Either way it was freakin intense,
and i'm glad i got to witness it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TRR: No effin' way!

Case of beer to that one. UniMogs are cool. If I ever end up back here and 
have some disposable income I'm getting one. Maybe that will be my mobile 
home... Hmmm. I want a high caliber machine gun on mine though.

part of the experience for me (WRT partying/clubbing) is the
DJ, the soundsystem, but more importantly, the BASS.

to be able to feel the music pounding you in the chest is a
wonderful thing.  and a well-tuned system is a beautiful thing,
when combined with a highly skilled DJ.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  an ethical dilemma for latinos ( and all people for that 
     matter )

replacing mr. asscroft with mr. gonzalez in effect does nothing.  same
right wing agenda, different color skin.

but i can just hear my mother now:
"A Latino attorney general is a momentus occasion.  You have to work
within the system to affect change.  This is a foot in the door."

i'm all for the advancement of Latinos and for all peoples.  i root for
Latinos when they get to big places.

but what should i do now?  mr. gonzalez is a bastard to be sure, but am i
not supposed to root for anyone under the Arbusto administration?  that's
eight years of not rooting for latinos.  that doesn't feel right either.

carnales, what the fuck do i do ay?

As we the members of SWAT Sound know...sometimes it's not all in the
reflexes, it's all in the tuning (and processing gear).  Even a small
sound system tuned just right can sound awesome.  Too many people
think that riding your system to near and sometimes all the way to
clipping is the way to go...hell's no, it's not about how much your
pushing but how you use what you're pushing.

a clipping system is one of the worst things to hear.  i'd
rather hear a system that's too quiet.

AMEN BROTHA TIP!!!!!

As we the members of SWAT Sound know...sometimes it's not all in the
reflexes, it's all in the tuning (and processing gear).  Even a small
sound system tuned just right can sound awesome.  Too many people
think that riding your system to near and sometimes all the way to
clipping is the way to go...hell's no, it's not about how much your
pushing but how you use what you're pushing.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Red Bull & You!!

I was doing some research on 5-htp and smart drugs when I found this site
that includes taurine as an ingredient in their formula.  I remember a
discussion a few months ago about taurine's popular urban legend as bull
urine and the resulting dialogue that it was not, but thought I would
revisit the topic for those not in attendance.

Looks like a little redbull everyday could be good for you.. minus the
caffeine :0

TAURINE 

This is a nerve and muscle regulating, amino acid that helps regulate
electrical impulses in the brain, and heart. It aids muscle building through
cell volumizing and regulates heartbeat. Taurine protects central nervous
system and brain cells by helping to maintain cell membrane stability. In
the brain taurine is a key agent in preventing neuron over-activity. Taurine
is a component of bile acids, which are necessary for the body to absorb
fat-soluble vitamins. It is found in meat, fish, eggs and dairy products.
Although it is a "non-essential" amino acid, taurine deficiency may occur in
vegans who eat no dairy products.

Taurine helps strengthen the heart and other muscles through cell
volumizing.

Taurine has cell protecting antioxidant and cell membrane stabilization
properties.

Taurine has been used to treat epilepsy, because of its nerve regulating
property and ability to inhibit neural overactivity

5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan)

5-HTP is the immediate precursor to serotonin and it has been compared in
double-blind studies of depression sufferers to many of the popular SSRI's
(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) such as Prozac, Paxil, Luvox and
Zoloft. It has shown comparable results to these drugs with few and milder
side effects. 

Our inclusion of this product in our system is due to the increased
production, and re-uptake of serotonin that we experienced while taking
Piracetam alone and with Acetlycholine precursors. While this effect is not
included in most of the research done on Nootropics like Piracetam it has
been noted by our in house research team members. We included 5-HTP in our
system and as a result, all of the associated problems of low serotonin
levels stopped immediately. Everyone felt better in our test group, and we
find that we have a much better product than competing products that do not
include this important discovery. Increased serotonin levels make one feel
much more in control and calm which helps to take away any edge from the
stimulating ingredients that we include in the system.

ALCAR Acetyl-L-Carnitine

This is an amazing nutrient that works synergistically as an Acetyl group
donor with DMAE to form the important memory neurotransmitter Acetylcholine.
There have been previous clinical trials showing that this nutrient actually
can improve memory and cognitive functioning in patients experiencing
dementia. In a recent study, patients with Alzheimer's disease undergoing
standard drug therapy were also given acetyl-L carnitine (ALCAR) at 2 grams
a day. It was found that those patients treated with the addition of ALCAR
had an improved level of responsiveness. It appears that acetyl-L carnitine
is a key nutrient for energy production at the cellular level. 

By enhancing membrane stability, energy production, and neurotransmission,
ALCAR helps to improve mental function. In addition, it may also have
anti-inflammatory effects that reduce free radical generation. ALCAR has
also demonstrated the ability to bind cortisol and increase nerve growth
factor production within the hippocampal region of the brain, and may
explain its positive effects on neuron function.

1. Necessary information (time, date, location,
artists, crew, etc.) is on the flyer and easy to find.
2. Innovative design that doesn't look like every
other flyer out there.
3. It is legible to people in an altered condition.

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] baby anne/aaron myers & misc.

ya i agree, i dont really care for her, dont think she's really all
that.  besides i hate that lame ass florida (Icey) breaks sound.  It's
totally so lame and boring.  i will admit there is a track or 2 by
Icey that i like, but they're a lil old.  But that whole sound is
lame.  I hate it when record stores classify it as Funky breaks...they
aint funky, not even close.  And every track sounds just like the
track before it, the same bassline, the same "ravey" synth
sound...totally lame.  That sound turned me off of breaks for a long
time, because anytime i'd go to see a breakbeat DJ they'd be playing
that crap.  But that was up in Portland and Seattle and they didnt
really know any better i guess.  I'm much happier here, with the
breaks i hear.  dont really hear the florida sound down here too much,
cept for Madame Mercury, and well i dont like her either so i avoid
her every chance i get.

>>Where is the sweet, shy BABY ANNE we used to know and love? Always wicked
>>on the turntables, our reigning funky breaks Bass Queen used to pose

>>sweater or a baby blue velour hoodie, looking soulful. But on the cover of

>>
>>Baby Anne (real name Marianne Broadaway), born in Panama City, Florida,
>>moved with her family to Orlando when she was four. The oldest of five
>>kids, she was very shy in school, but did well in sports, ballet and tap,
>>and cheerleading. She began raving in 1990 when she was 18. âI really 
>>liked
>>the music. A lot of my guy friends bought records and were learning how to
>>DJ and I would ask them to play certain songs. They saw I was interested 
>>so
>>they included me and I picked it up. I started spinning when I was 19, but
>>there were no other girls so a lot of them didnât want me to, but one or
>>two stuck up for me.â?
>>
>>In 1992, DJ Icey (Americaâs funky breaks King, whom she met before she
>>started DJing) let her play at a couple of his parties. âI donât 
>>really
>>know why other than it was funny or cute or whatever. It was just for fun
>>in the beginning and then it kind of took off. Even when I started getting
>>paid to DJ, I still only saw it as a hobby and self-entertainment and I
>>would only play stuff I would want to hear if I was on the dance floor 
>>with
>>my friends. I was never trying to prove anything or impress anyone.â?
>>
>>Her guy friends used to call her âJig-o-wattâ? because she danced a 
>>lot, but
>>Icey thought that wasnât an appropriate DJ name because you couldnât 
>>tell
>>she was a girl, so âhe started calling me Baby Anne as a nickname for
>>Marianne. I fought it at first but it ended up sticking.â?
>>
>>Thinking she needed to start a real career, Baby Anne quit DJing for
>>awhile. She enrolled in community college and worked as a bartender for a
>>year, but wasnât very happy. One night at work when a guest DJ was 
>>playing,
>>âOut of nowhere I said, What am I doing? Iâm going to start DJing 
>>again,
>>and ever since Iâve been doing it full-time.â?
>>
>>When Icey started producing, he said to her, âCome in and make a 
>>song.â? She
>>said okay  and came out of the studio with her first single 
>>âAbercrombieâ?
>>(1995).

>>For the record, Music Monthly first spoke with Baby Anne in DC on January
>>2003, but the interviewer misplaced the tape, which luckily resurfaced in
>>time for her latest release. Music Monthly reached Baby Anne recently for
>>updates. Following is a composite of both interviews.
>>
>>Music Monthly:  Where did your âMixtressâ? idea come from?
>>
>>Baby Anne:  I was trying to think of a title and came up with 
>>âMixtress.â?
>>The image came later when I was thinking about what to do for the cover.
>>Then I started on the song and it followed suit. Halfway through it I was
>>looking for a vocal sample and when I found the one I used, the 
>>âMixtressâ?
>>theme came back into play.
>>
>>MM:  Where did the sexy vocal sample come from?
>>
>>BA:  Just a sample CD. I donât even remember. Itâs definitely not me,
>>though!
>>
>>MM:  Where did you get those clothes and where was your photo shoot? And
>>who are those masked men?
>>
>>BA:  I donât normally own clothes like the ones on the cover. I [took] a
>>shopping trip to my local exotic dancer store. It was fun. Then I flew to
>>New York to work with a good photographer. He picked the mystery men. I
>>canât give away their identities!
>>
>>MM: Is there a correlation between the âMixtressâ? concept and the 
>>sound of
>>the mix?
>>
>>BA: I donât think the style of this CD is much different from my others.
>>The sound has progressed with the breakbeat scene. Iâve always liked 
>>high
>>energy breaks. This CD might be a little more intense, but I would have to
>>credit the great songs on it that I might not have been able to find in 
>>the
>>past.
>>
>>MM:  Does your new image coincide with a new way of viewing yourself?
>>
>>BA:  No, the whole thing was just for fun. I was trying to think of
>>something different that didnât look like every other mix-CD and I got
>>lucky. Thereâs nothing different about me. Iâm sure I will not repeat 
>>this
>>theme. Iâm sure if I hadnât thought of it, someone else would have
>>eventually.
>>
>>MM:  Are you still into yoga?
>>
>>BA:  I am. I love it. I feel really good afterwards. I try to encourage
>>everyone to try it.
>>
>>MM:  What pets do you have now? You used to have a ferret.
>>
>>BA:  My two dogs, Moopu and Scrappy, and my psycho cat.
>>
>>MM:  Whatâs in your CD player now?
>>
>>BA: [2003] I donât listen to breaks or any kind of dance music when 
>>Iâm not
>>working because I donât want to get burned out on it. I listen to â80s
>>music, â70s rock and roll, and grunge. [Iâm a] big Nirvana fan. âYou 
>>Know
>>Youâre Rightâ? - I love that song - made me miss Kurt Cobain.
>>[2004] âShake your Buddah, Vol. 1â? World Beats. No, Iâm not a 
>>Buddhist.
>>(smile)
>>
>>MM: What are your thoughts on the state of the rave scene and the 
>>anti-rave
>>legislation?
>>
>>BA: I think there are always going to be politicians against the rave
>>scene, using it as a political issue to go against. I donât play many 
>>raves
>>anymore, mostly night clubs. I think itâs for a number of reasons,
>>partially because of that, partially because of our economy, most places
>>are hurting. Another reason is that in some areas there were too many
>>promoters who over-saturated their market, kind of over did it. Kids 
>>didnât
>>want to pay 25 bucks every week to go to a party. Iâm optimistic.
>>Everything has its highs and lows. Weâre at a low right now so thereâs
>>nowhere to go but up. But there are places I go where things are great.
>>
>>MM:  Advice for aspiring DJs?
>>
>>BA:  Iâd probably say the same thing that I would have said to one of my
>>younger brothers or sisters when they each considered DJing. Only do it if
>>it makes you happy, not because you want to be a DJ because it wonât get
>>you very far. But if music is what you love, then you can take it as far 
>>as
>>you want.
>>
>>MM:  Where were you on 9/11?
>>
>>BA:  It was strange. Since I work at night I would normally sleep in until
>>11 or 12. I usually have my ringer off but for some reason I had it on and
>>my brother called at 9 am  and said, Two planes just crashed into the 
>>World
>>Trade Center and I just wanted to make sure you were at home. So I got up
>>and watched the whole thing on TV. I felt so bad for all those people. It
>>still gets to me. I think it reinforced what Iâve always thought, that a
>>lot of people go through life just working and getting by. I try to make
>>myself happy and experience everything I can, within reason.
>>
>>MM:  What are your current personal goals?
>>
>>BA:  Iâve recently gone through some personal changes that have 
>>influenced
>>me to change my point of view on life. My priorities include eliminating
>>negativity from my life. That includes unhealthy relationships, ways of
>>thinking, stress. I want to make the most of my life and help my friends
>>and family as much as I can to do the same.
>>
>>MM:  What are you contributing to society?
>>
>>BA:  (cringes) Nothing? (laughs) I feel like Iâm an entertainer and 
>>thatâs
>>the end of it. People go out and want to have a good time and I hope that
>>they do, but as far as me making a difference, I donât think this is the
>>place. Other things bother me, like animal cruelty and homeless people, 
>>and
>>if I was going to contribute something Iâd advocate for something like
>>that. But I am an entertainer and I donât think itâs that big of a 
>>deal.
>>
>>MM:  Okay, but when you play and you connect, what do you feel?
>>
>>BA:  Fun! I got into this because I love to dance and really love music 
>>and
>>now Iâm on the other end of it. I want people to have fun. I donât 
>>want
>>them getting messed up and sitting on the floor. Maybe itâs because 
>>Iâm the
>>older sister and I have to watch out for my younger siblings, but I want

>>with
>>the crowd. We get excited.

>>AARON MYERS IN FLIGHT
>>
>>When LTJ BUKEM was forced to cancel his October 6 gig at FIVE:DNBSESSIONS,
>>Baltimoreâs AARON MYERS was bumped from opener to headliner, in honor of
>>his imminent relocation to San Diego. It was a fine night at Five, BOBBY
>>JAE (District Soul, DCDNB, Upfront) opening with his trademark 
>>soulfulness,
>>AARON MYERS giving the crowd a mighty rinsing out, and LOCKS closing with
>>mellow energy.
>>
>>Myers went West for many reasons but âmainly because I just needed a 
>>venue
>>change.â? Though heâs DJed in the Baltimore/DC area since 1995, most of

>>bookings were outside the area from London to Los Angeles, so he felt

>>
>>Myers drove cross-country in two days, stopping in Amarillo, Texas for a

>>about 5 minutes from the beach.â?
>>
>>Music Monthly:  Thought you were a downtempo drum ânâ bass DJ, but you
>>played a fairly hard set at FIVE?
>>
>>Aaron Myers:  I think people see me as a âdowntempoâ? dnb DJ because I 
>>run
>>an atmospheric dnb label, TestFlight Recordings. Most people associate
>>atmospheric dnb with LTJ Bukemâs Good Looking label which tends to focus

>>towards calling it âprogressiveâ? - dnb that is actually progressing. 
>>Most
>>of what we hear today is stale, in my opinion, and my main element is
>>playing and releasing tunes that are forward thinking and pushing
>>boundaries.
>>
>>MM:  What were your big tracks of the night?
>>
>>AM:  âHallwaysâ? by MRN was definitely one of the highlights. It 
>>usually is
>>whenever I play it. I ended up rewinding it, which is a rarity for me 
>>since
>>I hate rewinds. They take away from a set, in my opinion. MRN is 
>>definitely
>>one to watch out for. I also premiered Blameâs new tune âAmethystâ? 
>>which
>>will be coming out on TestFlight in the next few months.
>>
>>Got some really good reactions out of some of the ICR tunes, another

>>I am finding myself playing more and more of. Most of my set consisted of
>>tracks from my label, EHLâs Warm Communications and ASCâs Covert 
>>Operations
>>labels, so seeing a good reaction from the crowd made every tune equally
>>big, knowing people were feeling what we have been pushing so hard over 
>>the
>>past few years.
>>
>>MM:  How does your move affect TestFlight?
>>
>>AM:  I think, if anything, it will help. In order to get notice, people
>>have to listen, and thatâs exactly what we get out here.
>>
>>MM:  What does TestFlight have coming up?
>>
>>AM:  October saw the release of our first CD, ACSâs second album and 
>>first
>>for TestFlight, âOpen Spaces,â? which has been getting some great 
>>reviews.
>>It features 12 tracks of drum ânâ bass and downtempo, and features 
>>tracks
>>by Jadis who previously worked with Orion on his releases for TeeBeeâs
>>Subtitles Label (available at retail stores, record shops, iTunes). There

>>copy
>>for myself. The other release was Orion âTestimonyâ?/â?Memento,â? 
>>which we

>>
>>On the CD end I have two projects lined up that I am really excited about.

>>DeFunked. Beyond that I have plans, none that I am ready to announce yet,

>>
>>MM:  Miss anything about Baltimore/DC?
>>
>>AM:  I definitely miss my friends and family. The weirdest thing is the

>>
>>MM:  Last words?

>>AM:  Get out there and check this stuff out. There is more to dnb than

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Q: What are the elements of a good flyer design?

(1) It communicates a positive vibe. This can be through use of fun, 
friendly images, silliness, vibrant colors, heartfelt language, etc.
(2) It tells you when and where the party is, how much it costs, how to 
get tickets if any, and generally what to expect.
(3) It's a work of art -- something cool, innovative, useful, or 
beautiful, that people will want to keep rather than just throwing away.
(4) It makes some kind of social/political statement or contribution, 
such as via parodying a commercial design, presenting a 
thought-provoking image, mocking the "war on drugs," mentioning 
proceeds going to a good cause, etc.

Groove on,

How could you even say that?! You should be ashamed. I love Baby Anne! She is very talented and a very sweet girl as well. She has DJing skills that most men wish they had.

totally so lame and boring. i will admit there is a track or 2 by
Icey that i like, but they're a lil old. But that whole sound is
lame. I hate it when record stores classify it as Funky breaks...they
aint funky, not even close. And every track sounds just like the
track before it, the same bassline, the same "ravey" synth
sound...totally lame. That sound turned me off of breaks for a long
time, because anytime i'd go to see a breakbeat DJ they'd be playing
that crap. But that was up in Portland and Seattle and they didnt
really know any better i guess. I'm much happier here, with the
breaks i hear. dont really hear the florida sound down here too much,
cept for Madame Mercury, and well i dont like her either so i avoid
her every chance i get.

the basics:
  - legible copy (time, date, other info)
  - the crew putting the event on
  - sometimes a lineup helps, but it isn't always necessary
  - correct spelling
  - decent printing (even photocopied flyers can look good if done =
right)
  - artwork at an appropriate resolution for print; don't use choppy web=20=

images!
  - avoid paragraphs of text - put that stuff on your voicemail message!

the finer points:
  - artwork that makes a strong visual impression initially to those=20
under the influence, but also a strong concept that still looks good=20
after you get home and look at it under normal light and with a sober=20
head
  - very little to no hype;  a good crew and a good production doesn't=20=

need it
  - don't use the standard fonts that come with your PC
  - good color balance
  - avoid clich=E9s and current flyer trends - do something different

the absolute best flyers:
  - original art
  - exceptional printing technique - something besides standard CMYK=20
process
  - high-quality paper stock
  - something that makes it stand out from all the garbage people call=20=

'flyers'
  - satire, political messages, and puns - a sense of humor!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Q: What are the elements of a good flyer design?

My major gripe with flyers tends to lie in shitty lettering. Often times the 
design itself is good - but either the font is too smal, illegible, or just 
higgledy-piggledy. Nothing is worse than seeing a cool flyer, but not being 
able to decipher what the hell it says.

What I LIKE about flyers tends to be a crisp layout, innovative graphics, 
uniform design elements - and of course ZING! By Zing, I mean somethign that 
catches the eye. Not the common flyer theme.

Anyway...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] baby anne/aaron myers & misc.

It's all about tech-funk, nuskool, & the style I've been jockin' lately 
which I have dubbed "Nu-Jack" (cuz it's like breaks made for you to jack to)

Florida breaks are so overdone it's pathetic. Their heydey was back in '95 - 
this is almost 10 years later...

Her arse is nice - but that hardly makes her worth going to see. A good 95% 
of the femalesd out here in the Bay Area are knockouts - so she ain't got 
nothin' impressive.

BAM IS A CLOSET FLORIDA BREAKS DJ!!!!

Along with music throughout the world, Florida's music scene is progressing and changing as is demanded by the masses for whom it is entertaining and inspiring. Perhaps what you hear from that region does not sound like breaks you hear in other places because that is what the demand is for there, that is what moves them. Cliimate to climate beats change. It would be a pretty monotonous world if there were no musical variety. If you could feel the passion and oneness within the underground scene in Florida, I believe you would understand.

Florida breaks are so overdone it's pathetic. Their heydey was back in '95 - 
this is almost 10 years later...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] baby anne/aaron myers & misc.

I can say that cuz I have seen her at least 3 times, and she has been MOST 
unimpressive each and every time. Predeictable track selection (can we say 
"best of Icey"), average skills at BEST, and the DC/Bmore locals (Dj Rize & 
DJ Wish) fucking RIPPED it in comparison.

She is OVERRATED.

Madame Mercury - while I do not dig her tracks that much, has some skills - 
and she's cuter (if appearance is even a factor)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] baby anne/aaron myers & misc.

Not directed at you Heidi  - cuz you know I loves ya....

But what is about people getting so mad about other people not liking music 
or musicians they like? It's not a personal affront, and last I checked 
there is no requirement out there that we all have to like everything that 
everyone else does.

I got in an argument earlier with my friend about the same thing. She was 
mad that I don't find Christina Aguilera to be impressive. I was labled 
"misinformed and judgemental".

I don't cram my musical taste down anyone else's throat and expect them to 
like it all. After all, I dig everyone from Richie Hawtin, to Frank Zappa, 
to Gwar, to Patsy Cline, to Fugazi...etc. etc.

I'm willing to bet that if someone peeped my CD or MP3 collection, they'd 
find a few bands and DJ's/producers that they absloutely thought were ass. 
Do I care? Hardly - it's called "FREEDOM OF CHOICE".

If you like something - jam it, dance to it, enjoy it, savor it - but just 
like food, do NOT expect everyone else to enjoy the same thing the same way. 
That's just ludicrous.

1. Enables one to attend.
2. Doesn't use ridiculous resources (i.e. 25"x30" Cool World double-fold-out glossy flyers)
3. Isn't stuck under windshield wipers.
4. Is a little bit of a tease, making one want to find out more.
5. Is 100% accurate with any facts. (i.e. doesn't list unconfirmed DJs)

An ideologue is an ideologue. Don't judge Gonzalez by the color of his
skin; judge him by the fact that he recommended ways the Bush
Administration could skirt the Geneva Conventions and continue to
torture detainees in Guantanamo and Iraq.

If anything you should be pissed that they're using his ethnicity as a
shield. It's insidious, and Latinos shouldn't stand for it.

IMNSHO, of course ;)

I am a firm believer that what you put out will come back to you. So why spread negativity to the masses? 
 
I'm out of this topic...

But what is about people getting so mad about other people not liking music 
or musicians they like? It's not a personal affront, and last I checked 
there is no requirement out there that we all have to like everything that 
everyone else does.

I got in an argument earlier with my friend about the same thing. She was 
mad that I don't find Christina Aguilera to be impressive. I was labled 
"misinformed and judgemental".

I don't cram my musical taste down anyone else's throat and expect them to 
like it all. After all, I dig everyone from Richie Hawtin, to Frank Zappa, 
to Gwar, to Patsy Cline, to Fugazi...etc. etc.

I'm willing to bet that if someone peeped my CD or MP3 collection, they'd 
find a few bands and DJ's/producers that they absloutely thought were ass. 
Do I care? Hardly - it's called "FREEDOM OF CHOICE".

If you like something - jam it, dance to it, enjoy it, savor it - but just 
like food, do NOT expect everyone else to enjoy the same thing the same way. 
That's just ludicrous.

Maybe the scene is poppin' - but the sound is not. I know what I like, and 
what I don't  - and there has been next to nothing innovative coming out of 
Florida in the last ten years. Notable exceptions are all in the nuskool 
arena. But "funky" breaks consist of the same over-used hip-hop samples "Go 
Dj Go Dj!" "UNGH, c'mon - yea!" etc. etc., and the same lame trance remixes 
over and over again. And while some of the kitschy rock&roll song remixes 
are amusing, they get real old real damn fast.

As soon as Florida gets with the program, and moves itself out of the 
mid-nineties - maybe I'll start paying attention again.

http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/You-gotta-fight-for-your-right-to-sample/2004/11/10/1100021883656.html

A US appeals court has handed a victory to pioneering punk-rap group
the Beastie Boys in a dispute over the growing musical practice of
sampling, in which recording artists incorporate snippets of other
songs into their own work.

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined today to reconsider its
decision last year allowing the group to use a six-second segment of
music from jazz flautist James Newton's 1978 composition Choir.

A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided
by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of
Newton's recording and therefore did not have to pay an additional fee
to license the underlying composition.

That finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of
the Beastie Boys, and the 9th Circuit today refused to reconsider its
ruling before a larger 11-judge panel.

"We hold that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition,
consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C
note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newton's
copyright," Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion.

The Beastie Boys used the sample in their song Pass the Mic on their
1992 album Check Your Head.

Representatives for Newton and the Beastie Boys were not immediately
available for comment.

The Beastie Boys helped spark the modern sampling trend in popular
music with the 1989 album Paul's Boutique, which incorporated bits of
music from sources as diverse as Johnny Cash, Bob Marley and the
Beatles to create new music. Sampling has since become a staple of many
artists, especially in the rap and hip-hop genres.

The Beastie Boys have also emerged as leading advocates of a new
approach to licensing known as the Creative Commons, in which artists
record songs that listeners are invited to "rip, sample, mash and
share" over file-sharing online networks like Kazaa or borrow to create
their own compositions.

shhhhhh!!!!!!  don't tell anyone!!!

in response to this thread:

i agree with marco on the music and food analogy.  don't get mad or offended 
if someone's tastes don't match yours and they voice their opinion.  
different strokes for different folks.

madame mercury:  as far as i'm concerned, she's got quality mixing skills 
and is very tuned into keeping the energy of her live sets locked in and 
bangin the dancefloors.  baby anne tends to let the energy of her sets loose 
too much steam inbetween most tracks and her transitions aren't that smooth. 
  and i'm not saying this because sherry is a friend of mine, i'm saying it 
cause i've heard her play at dozens and dozens of parties.  ps:  she is now 
living in NYC.

>>>>MM:  What are your current personal goals?

Hey, if DJ Icey decided to promote me, I'm sure I'd be famous too. Let's not

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  an ethical dilemma for latinos ( and all people for that matter )

	An idealogue? Having just looked at his background, Alberto Gonzalez 
looks like more of a social climber to me. Someone willing to be useful 
to those in power (in his case, Bush). Anyway there's nothing wrong 
with being an idealogue -- as long as the ideas you believe in are 
good. Michael Moore is an idealogue (not that the ideas he believes in 
are necessarily good, LOL!) As Barry Goldwater said, "extremism in 
defense of liberty is no vice, and moderation in pursuit of justice is 
no virtue."

	However I agree that Gonzalez's past actions don't make me enthused 
about the possibility of him becoming attorney general. His legal 
recommendations on Guantanamo and Iraq should be a red flag.

	Perhaps this nomination will serve as a note of caution to people 
playing the race card in the future -- it's always a two-edged sword. 
If some folks hadn't been so eager to lionize minorities and demonize 
white people in the past, there would be less danger of Gonzalez 
getting a pass just because he's a Latino now.

Groove on,
				<<< Starchild >>>

P.S. - I'm still intending to reply to your last message on the earlier 
political thread Shawn, but damn it's a long mother, and I just haven't 
got around to it yet.   8)

	In the meantime, let's all take a celebratory bong hit to mark 
Attorney Dictator Ashcroft's long-overdue departure! I hope the door 
smacks him in the ass on the way out.

Video of Tanks at anti-war protest in LA
Tanks on the streets of LA

http://la.indymedia.org/

LOS ANGELES, November 9, 2004 - At 7:50 PM two armored tanks showed up at 
an anti-war protest in front of the federal building in Westwood. The tanks 
circled the block twice, the second time parking themselves in the street 
and directly in front of the area where most of the protesters were 
gathered. Enraged, some of the people attempted to block the tanks, but 
police quickly cleared the street. The people continued to protest the 
presence of the tanks, but about ten minutes the tanks drove off. It is 
unclear as to why the tanks were deployed to this location. Uploaded here

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

OK, so I think we can both agree that either a) the ideas this guy
believes in are bad, or b) he has no ideology per se, but just issues
decisions and recommendations to further his own career. I'm not sure
which is worse, but either possibility would disqualify him for the AG
seat if I had any say in the matter.

Great quote. Did he say anything about extremism in defense of justice?

I couldn't agree more.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Q: What are the elements of a good flyer design?

what everyone else has said so far along with:

visually- it should represent the mood/theme/flavor of
the party. ie- don't put fuzzy yellow bunnies dancing
in a purple sea of pink daisies under a pastel rainbow
proclaiming "lovie dovie jingle sprouts" for a minimal
techno party yer throwin in a sewer. ghetto-tek maybe.
leave that design fer the candies. ultimately, you
should be able to look at the flyer, close yer eyes
and imagine what the party's gonna be like (while
fryin balls, of course).

Subject: [sfraves] Spirit of Raving Q: What are the elements of a good flyer design?

the best parties i've ever been to have been word of
mouth (no flier) or minimal black ink hand bills. when
the fliers started getting more involved the parties
went down the tubes. at the end of the day no one
cares what the flier looked like. if a party is wicked
thats all that matters.

A fuckwad who would associate himself with bush and the department of 
"justice" is a fuckwad who would associate himself with bush and the 
department of "justice", no matter the color of his skin.

I sure don't cut bush any slack because his sorry ass is about as pasty 
white as mine.  Or, if you want to get all ethnic, the fact that rudy 
giuliani is italian (As is most of my dad's half of the family.) 
doesn't make him any less a republican in my eyes.

In addition to the others:

1)  Not littered all over the sidewalks in SOMA .  Very little says 
"Don't go to this party." more than seeing the flyer on the ground when 
I'm walking to work in the morning.

and

2)  Not pasted to the side of my car by the morning dew.  Not only is 
this one just as disrespectful as the above, it's also totally 
pointless.  Even when I *DO* want your flyer, I don't want one that's 
been reduced to a mass of pulpy goo by the moisture.  Note that using 
ultra-gloss-lacquered-100 
proof-super-mega-nonrecyclable-nonbiodegradable-plastic coated 
cardstock is not an acceptable solution to this problem.

word! 

the rule of thumb for me and a lot of my peeps has
always been the more
expensive/colourful/glossy/big/obnoxious the flier the
more above ground main stream hence worse the party is
going to be bo matter who is spinning. unless you want
to hang with a bunch a high school e-tards... no
offence to anyone i hope ;) if so, sorry. i'm just a
weathered before there was a school-er always fighting
for the true underground baby ;)

Ditto on 1) and 2):

It wasn't funny at the time...well I guess it was...

At Serenity, a SF Concourse party I was at in ~'99, I parked in front of
the space, and afterwards I had..no kidding...*500+* Cyberfest flyers on my car.

Completely covered the windshield, in every door jam, nook and cranny,
covering my license plates.. I was like an armored cyberfest
advertisement. I wanted to take a picture, but moreso wanted to get outta
there, so I didn't. (I think innocentchild got to see the destruction)

Funny thing was 5 months later on a trip to an Oregon campout, I pull over
and pop the hood to find 50+ *more* Cyberfest flyers that were
lodged into my engine compartment. Man they must've worked hard to do
that!

I was raped by rave-flyers, only now can I come forward to talk about it
;-)

Subject: [sfraves] Flux 101: The massive FLUXuation on 6th street (Sat-Night)









So yeah, we just got 1 extra hour to sleep this fall. I know you need it,
but you can't have it this weekend. This month's installment of FLUX brings
you one EXTRA hour to turn it out!!!! Quite possibly the best lineup you've
seen for sometime.

For all of you that just don't know, here's the breakdown of the game plan.



The Stats~

Calamity Jane: Hands down one of the best breaks dj in SF opens the party up
in true progressive form, setting the pace for more to come.



Koroma: The highly book progressive dj, will bring life to the night tribal
dancer deep down inside of us and keep you bangin' to the beat of the drum!



Farmboy: Wipes that smile of your face! His progressive style, spotted with
break beats will have you stuck on the dance floor with one drink raised in
the air!!!



Gianni:  No stranger to the late night scene Gianni's will take control of
your body leaving you breathless, but wait. last night a Dj saved your
life!!



Massive FLUXuation!!! Free All Night @ Anu.

San Francisco's finest will give you an early dancing start & massive Dj
lineup.



Anu
43 6th @ Market

8pm-2am

Calamity Jane ~ Koroma ~ FarmBoy ~ Gianni

Subject: [sfraves] The SFR Sex Map

i was doing a little search on the internet today and i came across  
this bizarre "sex map" with all the SFR celebrities on it :

http://speed.speedera.com/cgi-bin/scosol/show_page.cgi? 
page=SFRsexmap.htm

... and i have a couple of questions:

who made this map?

does this signify the people i've already had sex with or am i supposed  
to have sex with them?  ;]

any help on this matter would be appreciated.

haha... well a couple years ago someone "released" a
sfr sex-chart, more related to the now defunct (as far
as i know) sfraves channel on IRC than to this list...

however there was quite an uprising and outrage when
this came out, probably because there were a lot of
accurate connections that people thought were secret...
there were also a lot of inaccurate accusations which
caused people to be angry as well...

according to the sex-chart tradition, a connection was
defined by any exchange of bodily fluids (ie kissing
was included) which imo made it highly inaccurate,
because jesus, if i had to chart every person i've
*kissed* it would have been a nightmare, doing so for
all those people, well, i dont know that it could be
completed ;)

anyways, the one you found was scott's response to the
drama, and is actually some kind of code that randomly
generates the location of peoples names in the chart... 

good times for sure :)

love and hugs and kisses,
tina

Subject: [sfraves] Whatchu Listenin To Willis???

Alright people I'm bored today, no ones here at work today so it's up
to you people to keep me entertained.

What are you listening to right now (in your cd player, car, iPod,
etc.)?  Who/What origianlly influenced you into that artist/song?

I'll start:

Nine Inch Nails - Down In It (actually i'm watching the video, but same diff)
It all started on a Boy Scout camping trip back in 1991-1992-ish, my
friend Bob Long had brought along a walkman and 1 tape, that tape was
NIN's Pretty Hate Machine, We listened to that tape on loop for 3
days, non-stop, cept for when we had to change the batteries.  The
song that really caught my attention was Sin, i had to hear that song
more, so when we got back home after that weekend I immediatly went to
the music store and bought the Pretty Hate Machine CD, and it's been
downhill ever since....hehehe, that started the plunge into the
industrial darkness.  Thank god for that weekend.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Whatchu Listenin To Willis???

I've been jocking an El Juan cd that he gave me at the OtherWorld Halloween
party. I haven't enjoyed a D&B cd in AGES, so this is a nice change of pace
for me. Even prompted me to go buy some new D&B choonz....

Of course, El Juan is ten ZILLION times better live - but the cd does nicely
in a pinch.

What got me into him? The 1st underground party I went to out here, where I
believe I met Michael (le Breadstick fellow), Dina, Miki & a few other folks
for the 1st time. It was at some sort of art school/gallery type joint in
the city. He was spinning, and was quite good...had to wait until this year
to see him again. By the way - that just sucks, cuz he is a SICK dj and
deserves frequent bookings...

Yadda...

well, every time i go to my coffee shop and listen to itunes streaming 
(i usually listen to static beats) i copy down the songs i like and 
every once in a while try to download or purchase some of those songs.  
here's what i've had and i've got some of them playing on my FogBook 
right now.  it's mostly downtempo stuff.   if you have any of these, 
let me know!  maybe we can make a little trade.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The SFR Sex Map

I don't know what you're talking about Tina- that map was 100% accurate
when it was made.
And it wasn't just kissing- mine means actual real sex, you know, the old
in-out.

Hmmmm now looking at it though, I see that there are some new names to be
added-
And some new connections for sure!

What made me start listening to them?

A friend sent me this song and I fall in love with the music and her
voice.  She has an amazing voice.  So I downloaded a bunch of other
songs.  Now they are one of my top favorites.  Love singing to it. :D

i think i found what i was looking for although not as
good of a deal as a few months back. 

i started ordering from satellite when they first went
online. they used to be really bad but for giggles i
decided to order from them over the summer and the
have finally gotten their shit together. 

i talked to one of their guys. they set up their
online system so they integrate with suppliers. they
take your order, get the records from suppliers, then
ship. i have ordered probably 200 records from them
this summer and only had 2-3 that didn't ship. WAY
better than they used to be. i even rang then a couple
times to tell them that a record didn't show on my
invoice that i paid for and the included it with my
next order and waved shipping. i would give them a
thumbs up these days. at least since this summer till
today.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] buy records online - i need them thar links again

Thye sent me two orders in a row w/ either missing or incorrect records.
Said I was to get free shipping on orders due to fuck-ups, charged me
anyway. Said they'd re-fill the orders at no charge - never did.

Long story short, I got 3 record orders for free after I charged em back to
my CC.

Subject: [sfraves] RIP John Peel

No matter your genre....heads that know will miss John
Peel for the many years of dedicated enthusiasm as a
true pioneer of progressive music....

"He became one of the first DJs to give exposure to
punk, reggae and hip-hop, before they crossed over
into the mainstream. "

Legendary radio DJ John Peel dies


Veteran BBC broadcaster John Peel has died at the age
of 65, while on holiday in Peru.

Peel, whose radio career spanned 40 years, was on a
working holiday in the city of Cuzco with his wife
Sheila when he suffered a heart attack.

He was BBC Radio 1's longest-serving DJ and in recent
years had also presented Home Truths on Radio 4.

Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt said Peel's
contribution to modern music and culture was
"immeasurable".

'Hugely missed'

He added: "John Peel was a broadcasting legend. I am
deeply saddened by his death as are all who work at
Radio 1. "John's influence has towered over the
development of popular music for nearly four decades.


HAVE YOUR SAY

John Peel stayed true to what mattered most in music
Pete, Nottingham, UK


"Hopeful bands all over the world sent their demo
tapes to John knowing that he really cared.

"His commitment and passion for new music only grew
stronger over the years. In fact, when I last saw him
he was engaged in a lively debate with his fellow DJs
over the state of new music today

"He will be hugely missed."

Mr Parfitt told Radio 1's Newsbeat that Peel had been
on a holiday of a lifetime when he died.

'Irreplaceable'

He added: "He had gone on holiday with Sheila to a
place where he had always wanted to go."


BBC director general Mark Thompson said: "We are all
very shocked and saddened by the news of John's death.


"He was one of the giants of radio and will be missed,
not just by everyone at the BBC, but by millions of
listeners of all ages."

Tony Blair's spokesman said the Prime Minister was
"genuinely saddened by the news".

He added: "His view is that he was a unique voice in
British broadcasting and used that voice to unearth
new talent and different subjects and make them
accessible to a much wider audience."

Radio 1 DJ Jo Whiley, who presented coverage of the
Glastonbury Festival with Peel, paid tribute to her
colleague and close friend.

She said: "John was simply one of my favourite men in
the whole world - as a music fan and presenter he was
simply an inspiration."

Mainstream music

Peel was born in Heswall, near Liverpool, and after
completing his military service in Britain in 1962,
went to the US where he began working for a radio
station in Dallas.

It was because of him I got to hear some of the most
obscure but influential music I ever heard
James Dean Bradfield, Manic Street Preachers

He joined Radio 1 at the launch in 1967, and
established himself with the late night programme Top
Gear.

He became one of the first DJs to give exposure to
punk, reggae and hip-hop, before they crossed over
into the mainstream.

Peel's programme built up a reputation around the
world, and in addition to his Radio 1 programme, he
could also be heard on the BBC's World Service.

James Dean Bradfield, lead singer of the Manic Street
Preachers, paid tribute to Peel.

He told BBC News Online: "It was because of him I got
to hear some of the most obscure but influential music
I ever heard.

"He was a lifeline to hearing music I would never have
heard otherwise. The service he provided was getting
to hear music that you couldn't buy in Cardiff. He was
a portal to a whole new world."

He always had his finger on the pulse of the music
industry
Michael Bradley, Undertones

Blur lead singer Damon Albarn said John Peel's
patronage was "one of the most significant things that
happened to us in our careers".

"The world is going to be a poorer place with his
sudden departure. I will miss him deeply," he added.

"I want to send my heartfelt sympathy to his lovely
family. John's memory will never be forgotten because
he had the spirit of music in him."

Favourite record

After announcing Peel's death on Radio 1, the station
played his favourite song, Teenage Kicks, by the
Undertones.

Michael Bradley, bass player for the Undertones, spoke
of his shock on learning of Peel's death.

He said: "He was a very funny, very warm man and we
will always be grateful for what he did for The
Undertones.

"Personally, I find it incredible what he did for the
band and we always got huge pride out of the fact that
he said Teenage Kicks was his favourite single.

"He always had his finger on the pulse of the music
industry and the fact that Radio 1 played the
Undertones, the White Stripes and the Strokes today
showed just how relevant he remained throughout his
career."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Whatchu Listenin To Willis???

Right now I have in the CD player:

Mobb Deep   - Hell on Earth


I like mobb deep cause they have a gritty true east coast sound. Real rappin 
and real hip-hop a lil "darker" then stuff by like J5 or Dialted peoples 
etc.. But still very good.

Jedi Mind Tricks - Visons of Gandhi

Now Jedi mind is hard gritty east coast stuff with lots of references to 
Allah, Jesus christ and all types of crazy ass samples very unique album and 
from listening to it you would think that these dudes were black. But in 
fact Vinnie paz is white or I-talian and so is Stoop there producer and 
couple other members of the crew. Very orginal works if you ask me all there 
albums I have are good. Violent by design and there newest one something of 
Blood is really good too.

Peace,

Macadio

Subject: [sfraves] nrr... Investigate the Election Results

{sorry if this was posted already.. but Hello 2Day.. we
gotta do something =)}

Questions are swirling around whether the election was
conducted honestly or 
not.  We need to know -- was it or wasn't it?

If people were wrongly prevented from voting, or if
legitimate votes were 
mis-counted or not counted at all, we need to know so
the wrongdoers can be 
held accountable, and so we can prevent this from
happening again.

Members of Congress are demanding an investigation to
answer this question.  
The decision on whether or not there will be an
investigation could come as 
soon as Monday.  Join us in supporting the call for one
now, at:

 http://www.moveon.org/investigatethevote/

Then please invite your friends and colleagues to sign,
as well.  We need to 
show Congress that hundreds of thousands of Americans
are serious about 
protecting the integrity of the vote.

We're all hearing the stories and wondering what's true
and what isn't.  But 
at least two cases of serious problems are accepted
beyond doubt:

* In Broward County, Florida, electronic voting
machines counted
 backwards: as more people voted, the official vote
count went down. [1]

* In one Columbus, Ohio suburb, election officials have
acknowledged
 that electronic voting machines credited Bush with
winning 4,258
 votes, even though only 638 people voted there. [2]

These are just cases where we know something went
wrong.  There were also 
lots of reports of people being denied ballots on
Election Day.  So far, 
these reports remain anecdotal, but they must be
compiled and examined.  And 
the Internet is abuzz with theories about why the
official counts were so 
different from the exit polls.

Do you have a story?  Were you prevented from voting? 
Tell us, at:

 http://www.moveon.org/investigatethevote/

Six prominent members of Congress have called for an
investigation.  
Representatives Conyers (D-MI), Holt (D-NJ), Nadler
(D-NY), Scott (D-VA), 
Watt (D-NC) and Wexler (D-FL), have demanded that the
U.S. General 
Accounting Office:

 immediately undertake an investigation of the efficacy
of voting
 machines and new technologies used in the 2004
election, how
 election officials responded to difficulties they
encountered,
 and what we can do in the future to improve our
election systems
 and administration. [3]

We've got to support their call by asking our own
Representatives and 
Senators to join them.

If you have a personal story of disenfranchisement,
tell us.  These members 
of Congress have agreed to include our stories and
comments in their call 
for an investigation.  Please sign now -- we'll deliver
our compiled 
statements to them on Friday.

Even if you don't have a personal story, your signature
on our petition will 
still help build support for an investigation.

To keep our faith in democracy, we need to know the
facts.  Your signing 
this petition, and sharing your story if you have one,
will help.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

--Carrie, Joan, Lee, Marika, Noah, Peter, Rosalyn, and

Subject: Re: [sfraves] baby anne/aaron myers & misc.

Can't vouch for her dj skills, don't like the Icey style breaks (gag), but I 
will say that it appears she got lucky. Right time to start. Right place, 
with the right friends. It's all about networking and who you know. DJ 
skills, I've seen people with horrible skills getting booked big because 
they know people. What I read in this article is that she knew Icey and he 
totally pushed her up and without that it's hard to say if she'd be where 
she is now. Lucky girl...

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become

On my iPod: various DJ mixes by John Tejada, Brian Ffar, Maetrik, Richie
Hawtin, Trent Roche, and live sets by Lucien N. Luciano and Claro
Intelecto.

On the stereo: Crunch Time by Misc., and stuff from this year's Beta
Lounge record club: DJ Zeph, Bigga Bush, and Branden Harper. If I'm in a
chill mood, nothing does me better than Talkie Walkie by Air. And
Bjork's Medulla is still growing on me, slowly but surely.

On the decks (I'm lucky enough to work at home, so I can listen to
records all day long): the new Ricardo Villalobs 3x12" on Perlon
(MASSIVE!) and Dominick Eulberg's Flora & Fauna LP on Traum
Schallplatten.

In the car, an oldie but extremely goodie: Dead Cities by Future Sound
of London. For me, it's the best of both worlds as far as FSOL are
concerned: the electronic aesthetic of Accelerator and the lush, organic
textures of Lifeforms, with each track tied together by an intangible
sonic thread. "Antique Toy" is my favorite on this album, primarily
because it makes such interesting use of classic Roland drum machines. I
love the image that it conjures, of somebody wandering through the
basement of an abandoned building thousands of years in the future and
coming across this battered old plastic box. Somehow he gets it working
again, but the patterns stutter and pause, and the emptiness of the
place allows its sounds to reverberate endlessly. The track works on so
many levels: it's a thematic device for the album; it's a prediction of
how the technology of today will be perceived by future generations (if
not the artists' perception of 10-year-old drum machines); it's probably
even a subtle stab at vintage gear fetishists.

How did I get into FSOL? Well, I was first exposed to "Papau New
Guineau" by the soundtrack to that horrible '92 animated film Cool
World (also featuring Ministry, Thrill Kill Kult and Moby). But I didn't
really pursue that lead, and I eventually stumbled upon Accelerator when
it was re-pressed with the fancy graphics a few years later. "Papau New
Guineau" is still probably my favorite song of all time.

Toodles,

Hell Yeah, that track is the shizznit.  I love it so much, i heard it
on an old old old skool doc martin mix way back in the early 90's and
i fell in love with it then.  I like to bust it out every once in a
while when i play a breaks set, it's a good chill opening track and
blends well with bassbin twins.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Whatchu Listenin To Willis???

What's really cool is it's on the Cool World soundtrack from the time when 
it came out. That was a major motion picture release and it had early rave 
music on it! Actually that whole soundtrack is a pretty cool retrospective 
and I still have my copy from back when I saw the movie. Hybrid's remix of 
Papua New Guinea is really cool and probably my favorite. I see it as 
minimally touched and as a cleaned up version using modern gear.

Subject: [sfraves] what is did on my lunch break today

http://mattandlizzy.com/lunch%2011-11-04/index.htm

I got a bit snap happy with the camera and didn't edit
anything. The beach Sierra and me are on is the south
beach on Donner Lake. Note how bloddy low the lake is.
Beautiful time of year to hike around there. No
campers. We saw 3-4 people out there. 

Enjoy 

Matt

An elder Cherokee Native American was teaching his grandchildren about 
life.  He
said to them, "A fight is going on inside me...It is a terrible fight, and 
it is
between two wolves.  One wolf represents fear, anger, envy, sorrow, regret,
greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, pride and
superiority.  The other wolf stands for joy, peace, love, hope, sharing,
serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, friendship, empathy, generosity,
truth, compassion, and faith.  This same fight is going on inside of you and
every other person too."

They thought about it for a minute and then one child asked his grandfather,
"Which wolf will win?"  The old Cherokee simply replied..."The one I feed."

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] baby anne/aaron myers & misc.






isn't it great how diverse we are?  :)

i think it's interesting how prominent djs elicit such a wide range of
responses to their work.

and of course in this scene that means the whole spectrum from love to
hate, lol.  ;)

or maybe that's true in any scene.

my husband, who is a huge fan of the late great jazz drummer buddy rich,
says rich's career was plagued by people who tore him down, while in the
opinions of lots of fans rich was one of the greatest drummers who ever
lived, so maybe our scene is not so different.

if baby anne was lucky, i don't begrudge her that.  a lot of being
successful in the entertainment business *is* luck.  that's just the way it
is.  but it's not all luck.  if she can't draw a crowd or rock a house,
luck won't keep getting her bookings.  i've met some pretty hardcore baby
anne fans.  if she makes them happy, good for her.  :)

i am not a huge breaks fan myself, florida or otherwise, but i like
"mixtress."  it's fun.

please do like whatever you do like.  :)

respectfully,
mary :)



< I really like what Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music has to say about
Icey's "Florida Breaks:" style.  I agree there 100%....  Can't stand
the shit.

As a matter of fact, I think that's what turned me off so hard to raves
back when I got dragged to a few in Florida.  Breaks, breaks, and more
fucking breaks; and big clusters of people standing around nearly-empty
sections of the dance floor while one tweaker moron fakes a seizure.
Thanks, but I'll take the largest sea of San Francisco F8-worshipping
e-tards you can find over that scene, any day of the week.

wow, that smells like oldschool.  I had a slab of

Homebase, back when we all had too much money and Vlad

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Free hosting for mixes?

It depends what you want to do.  Do you want streaming
or just downloading?  Beware of hidden limits either
way.  And I don't know anyone that's supporting
streaming that is totally free.

There are a number of web hosting companies that now
throw in streaming for free.  So if you need a website
or can switch providers you can get streaming for
free.

My former company Live365.com charges now charges
$9.95 per month for streaming audio broadcasting. :(

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [bsp/nrr] Free hosting for mixes?

http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&q=%22free+mp3+hosting%22

came up with something.   I don't know of any totally free sites that work well though.  all i hear is complaints most of them, but 
what do you get for free right ?

If you don't find what you're looking for and decide you want to get your own domain/site/piece-o-teh-Interweb and be the master of 
your own destiny, as a small local consulting/hosting company (http://5angle.com), I provide hosting for a few local dj's and other 
sfr folks.  hit me up off list if you're interested.  i can't compete with CheaperThanGODCanProvideWebHosting.   but if you're 
looking for quite competitively priced local service where there *is* a person at the other end of the phone call (*some* people 
think that's worth something :) hit me up off list.


drunk dialing your hosting provider's cell phone at 3am is grate !

-=dave

ps- i added the BSP/NRR tagline since i don't appreciate people promoting non-music stuff to the list either.  but he asked so i 
couldn't resist :)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: New track (UlvCM) & Live Mix @ Defcon XII

Well,

For those folks who like a little techno in their lives I have posted a new 
track to the virtual catalog of EGR Records:
http://egr.egregious.net/egrv-01/
It came about last week while I was at ICMC as a short live performance.

I also got around to getting most of my live mix from Defcon XII posted as 
well.. It was a short set with some tech difficulties such as the rig being 
ghetto and a needle going out, but hey... I kind of like live sets that 
aren't pulled off in a perfect environment...   as I have plenty that 
are... live and studio.. :)

For more DJ comps.. I have 9 mostly techno oriented ones here:
http://www.egregious.net/comps/

and some tracks and media stuff here:
http://www.egregious.net/media/

Cheers,
--Mike

O.K. now that I have your attention. Jeff Fisher from
Florida finally called back this morning at 5:45 a.m. 

He said what we need to do is email, fax, phone, all
te polititians on his site, sign the petition, etc. to
demand a nationwide recount. We only have two more
days to get this done. 

http://www.jefffisherforcongress.com/

All the info is on his site. 

If you agree with a recount pass this on to EVERYONE
you know.

Not to be the voice of pessimism but what's the point?  Kerry conceded.  A 
recount would do nothing.

Maybe you're right...but then, why did I vote for President this year eventhough
I knew that California's electoral votes would go to Kerry?

I remember when this new internet auction site was selling 10,000 talkabouts for
$10.  Those went in less than a day.

Hohnestly, signing this petition will probably mean more than your 2004
Presidential vote, recount or not.

This argument can be used on my vote as well.  90% of DC voted for Kerry 
and only 9% voted for Bush.  When you concede you pretty much throw in the 
hat.

precinct (see letter from Ohio Libertarian Party executive director =20

Badnarik Challenges Election Results
Blackwell Announces Conference

=A0=A0=A0=A0 We have just received wonderful news, and I want to share =
it
with you as soon as possible.

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Multiple citizen activist groups have joined together to
protest the management of this year's election.=A0 Just yesterday,
Michael Badnarik and David Cobb issued a challenge to the Ohio
Secretary of State Ken Blackwell.=A0 This challenge was headline news
on Ohio public radio and the Columbus Dispatch.=A0
See this link:=A0

http://www.dispatch.com/news-story.php?story=3Ddispatch/2004/11/12/=20
20041112-B1-00.html&rfr=3Dnwsl

=A0=A0=A0=A0 No one thinks this will change the outcome of the election, =
but
we are, instead, focusing on the inherent unfairness of our current
election laws in Ohio. We have received scattered reports of
intimidation, fraud, and official counting errors.=A0 In one precinct,
Michael Badnarik's name was actually blacked out by election
workers.=A0 Many voters stood in lines for hours.

=A0=A0=A0=A0 We are demanding change.=A0 We want votes to be counted =
promptly
and fairly in a transparent and easily accountable system.=A0 We want
to end the restriction of only allowing Democrats and Republicans to
work the polls (independents cannot be poll workers in Ohio).=A0 We
demand that the Libertarian Party be recognized for what it truly
is, a political party.=A0 We demand equal and fair ballot access
requirements for all political parties and independents.

=A0=A0=A0=A0 If you are an Ohio Voter, we encourage you to attend the =
public
meetings which has been called for this weekend: Saturday November
13, 1-4 PM New Faith Baptist Church, 955 Oak Street, Columbus, Ohio =20
43205 and
Monday November 15, 6-9 PM, Auditorium (Meeting Room A), Courthouse,
373 S. High St. Columbus, OH

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Under this tremendous pressure from citizen activists,
Secretary of State Ken Blackwell has announced a Post-Election
Conference on Election Law to recommend necessary changes to the
legislature.=A0 This conference is scheduled for January.=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0 We urgently need your help to continue the pressure.=A0 His =
phone
number is: 614-466-2585 and his email is: election@sos.state.oh.us

=A0=A0=A0=A0 We are asking that you politely, yet firmly, demand that =
the
Libertarian Party be given a seat at Ken Blackwell's Post-Election
Conference.=A0 If you can help us by making a financial contribution,
the funds will be well spent.=A0 This is our contribution link:=A0
http://www.lpo.org/Contribute/LPOGoals.shtml

=A0=A0=A0=A0 With your help, we will continue to fight for all our =
rights.

In Liberty,
Robert Butler
Executive Director
Libertarian Party of Ohio

Subject: NRR: Re: [sfraves] PLEASE HELP - WE NEED TO ACT TODAY, FRIDAY

Someone was mentioning Kerrys concession speech earlier, in regards to
this thread.  Well, "as Keith Olbermann of MSNBC, who has been about the
only mainstream journalist to actually follow up on the many serious
problems with regard to the integrity of the election, has pointed out,
a concession speech, in effect, means nothing. It is not legally
binding."

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and
causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. . . . corporations
have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow,
and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by
working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated
in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."

Subject: [sfraves] mean nrr

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:

"do you think that they were mean?"
"who?"
"them."
"yes, they were pretty mean about that."
"did you see the other thing that they were mean
about?"
"no, not yet." :)

Kind of.  IMHO, this may mean more than your presidential vote.  1/25,000 vs.
1/100,000,000.  Statewide vs. national.

A recount will (hopefully) give a better set of data to determine whether voter
fraud did occur.  If evidence does arise, someone gets charged with a fellony. 
Perhaps voting reform will become a priority so that everyone's vote, for any
candidate, does indeed count.

Wow! If I am ever wrongly charged with murder, I sure am glad I will have
fair and partial peers judging me.

"I knew he was guilty, becuase he just looked guity!"

The guy is a creep.  But with not a shred of physical evidence, 
how can you be so sure?

Scott will certainly appeal and he'll have a good chance
of overturning.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Verdict is in!

I really think he had some hand in it. But all the same prosecution couldn't 
prove he was tied to the murder and defense couldn't prove he wasn't. To me 
that's a legal stalemate and a waste of time. I think that should have been 
a not-guilty. Not enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he 
did it.

Subject: [sfraves] ACT TODAY FRIDAY UPDATE 

Sorry eveyone I have been in the field all day and
havn't been able to email. I just got home and had
another call from Jeff Fisher. 

Basically he said that the DNC got ahold of him and
didn't know about the voting irregularity numbers. He
spoke with Al Sharpin and a few other high end peeps.
They assigned him a lawyer to help and put him in a
safe place to work this out. 

Jeff said to keep the phone call, faxes, emails, etc.
flooding in. I guess that's all we can do at this
point. If we can flood the politions with requests
then maybe this will actually work. I am expecting an
email or phone call again later this
afternoon/evening. I will forard an email if I get one
or just relay the phone call. 

PLEASE KEEP THE DEMAINDS GOING OUT!!!

Here is is web address with instructions on what to
do.

http://www.jefffisherforcongress.com/

=)

Matt 

I will be back online in an hour or so. =)

I had a business for years and had many news people do
interviews. The amount of changes in what I said vs.
what was printed was daftly different. I don't trust
the media.

Totally I agree.  I've had the same done to me many
times.  

I'm not putting forward a position on this subject,
just sharing the links.  My opinion (not that anyone
cares) is that fraud is unproven, but I also haven't
done the data analysis that I would want to do to
convince myself either way.

And why isn't this posting about music?

OK then...

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr... Investigate the Election Results

Matt,

	I definitely agree about the untrustworthiness of the media, and the 
New York Times is more pro-government than most. Nevertheless, it's 
hard to dispute the conclusions of these two articles. After previously 
distributing allegations of vote fraud I received from Apollo on this 
list and other sources elsewhere, and being inclined to believe that 
Bush or his supporters stole the election, after reviewing further 
information I no longer believe that the evidence warrants such a 
conclusion.

	On the other hand, an investigation couldn't hurt. You can never have 
too much transparency in the voting process, and I know that there were 
lots of problems, even if the national vote wasn't hijacked for Bush. 
If you want to give more than lip service to such efforts, you can 
contribute here to help the Libertarian and Green parties' joint effort 
to force a recount in Ohio: https://badnarik.org/ (include "for Ohio 
recount" in the phone or email address line if you do not wish to make 
a general donation). Press release on recount project follows.

Groove on,
				<<< Starchild >>>


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 11, 2004

POC:
Blair Bobier, Cobb Campaign -- 541.929.5755 or 414.364.1596
Stephen Gordon, Badnarik campaign 256-227-8360 or
communications@badnarik.org


PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO DEMAND OHIO RECOUNT

David Cobb and Michael Badnarik, the 2004 Green and Libertarian
presidential candidates, today announced their joint intent to secure
a recount of presidential ballots cast in Ohio.

"Due to widespread reports of irregularities in Ohio's voting
  process, we are compelled to demand a recount of the Ohio
  presidential vote," the two candidates said in a joint statement.
  "Voting is at the heart of the American political process and its
  integrity must be preserved. When Americans stand in line for hours
to exercise their right to vote, they need to know that their votes
will be counted fairly and accurately. We are acting to protect the
rights of the people of Ohio, and the rights of all Americans. Public
trust in the democratic process is at stake."

The candidates also demanded that Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth
Blackwell, a Republican who chaired the Ohio Bush campaign, recuse
himself from the recount process.

Ohio's election proceedings were marred by numerous press and
independent reports of voter intimidation, mis-marked and discarded
ballots, problems with electronic voting machines and
disenfranchisement -- apparently by design -- of African-American
voters. A number of citizen and voting rights organizations will hold
hearings this Saturday in Columbus, Ohio to give an airing to, and
investigate, these claims.  The hearings will be held from 1-4 p.m.
at the New Faith Baptist Church, 955 Oak Street. Voters, poll
workers, journalists and voting experts are invited to testify. A
second hearing will be held on Monday at a location to be announced,
from 6-9 p.m.

The Badnarik and Cobb campaigns are in the process of raising the
required fee, estimated at $110,000, for securing a complete recount.
The campaigns are accepting contributions through their web sites.
The Badnarik-Campagna website is http://www.badnarik.org. The
Cobb-LaMarche website is http://www.votecobb.org.

Throughout this election cycle, the Cobb and Badnarik campaigns have
worked together in a spirit of cooperation and civility rarely found
in electoral politics. The campaigns jointly participated in and/or
sponsored a series of independent debates, and the two candidates
were arrested together in St. Louis protesting their exclusion from
the restricted, two-party corporate-sponsored "debates." Now, as the
election results remain in question, Michael Badnarik and David Cobb
are proud to once again act together on behalf of the rights and
interests of the American people in reaching the truth.

I had a great time dancing my ass off to the Autobots.  If  you are in 
to breaks at all, I highly suggest checking him/them out tomorrow for 
the encore performance at Quick n Dirty.

Mucho props to the Evil Breaks kru for this one.

Sample the Future

      Rip, mix, burn. Swap till you drop. The music cops
      can't do a thing - it's 100 percent legal, licensed
      by the bands. The Wired CD, copyrighted for the
      21st century.

By Thomas Goetz


By nature, musicians are thieves. Nicking a bit of this
song and a lick from that one, shaping their style on
the riffs of those who came before, musicians are
experts in the art of acquisition. Woody Guthrie knew
this; he pinched melodies from Leadbelly - and let
anybody pinch him in return. The Sex Pistols knew this;
they shamelessly lifted from the New York Dolls and ABBA
(yes, ABBA) and set off a teenage riot. And James Brown
knows this; he accrued a large debt to Little Richard -
only to become the most sampled man in showbiz, with
thousands of his grunts and bridges and beats pilfered
by lesser men.

But what some call theft, others call sharing. Thanks to
sharing, there are genre-bending artists like Beck and
Prince, the mash-up legacy of Jay Z's Black Album, and
the sublime delight of Walter Murphy's "A Fifth of
Beethoven."

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] Flux 101: The massive FLUXuation on 6th street (Sat-Night)







So yeah, we just got 1 extra hour to sleep this fall. I know you need it,
but you can't have it this weekend. This month's installment of FLUX brings
you one EXTRA hour to turn it out!!!! Quite possibly the best lineup you've
seen for sometime.

For all of you that just don't know, here's the breakdown of the game plan.



The Stats~

Calamity Jane: Hands down one of the best breaks dj in SF opens the party up
in true progressive form, setting the pace for more to come.



Koroma: The highly book progressive dj, will bring life to the night tribal
dancer deep down inside of us and keep you bangin' to the beat of the drum!



Farmboy: Wipes that smile of your face! His progressive style, spotted with
break beats will have you stuck on the dance floor with one drink raised in
the air!!!



Gianni:  No stranger to the late night scene Gianni's will take control of
your body leaving you breathless, but wait. last night a Dj saved your
life!!



Massive FLUXuation!!! Free All Night @ Anu.

San Francisco's finest will give you an early dancing start & massive Dj
lineup.



Anu
43 6th @ Market

8pm-2am

Calamity Jane ~ Koroma ~ FarmBoy ~ Gianni

Rapper O.D.B. Collapses, Dies in Studio 





30 minutes ago

 

By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY, AP Music Writer 

NEW YORK - The rap artist O.D.B., whose utterly unique rhymes, wild
lifestyle and incessant legal troubles made him one of the most vivid
characters in hip-hop, collapsed and died inside a recording studio
Saturday. He was 35.

O.D.B. had complained of chest pains before collapsing at the Manhattan
studio, and was dead by the time paramedics arrived, said Gabe Tesoriero, a
spokesman for O.D.B.'s record label, Roc-a-Fella. 

The cause of death was not immediately clear, but O.D.B. had recently
finished a prison sentence for drug possession and escaping a rehab clinic.
He would have turned 36 on Monday. 

O.D.B. - also known as Ol' Dirty Bastard, Dirt McGirt, Big Baby Jesus or his
legal name of Russell Jones - was a founding member of the seminal rap group
the Wu-Tang Clan in the early 1990s. With his unorthodox delivery -
alternately slurred, hyper and nonsensical - O.D.B. stood out even in the
nine-man Clan, which featured such future stars as Method Man, RZA and
Ghostface Killah. 

The Wu-Tang blueprint was for each member to pursue solo projects, and
O.D.B.'s were among the best. He released hit singles such as "Shimmy Shimmy
Ya" and "Got Your Money," and appeared on remixes with artists like Mariah
Carey. 

"There's nobody like him in the game," RZA told The Associated Press in an
April interview, when asked if O.D.B. could resume his career after prison.
"He's got a lot of problems he's got to iron out, of course, but as far as a
one-of-a-kind person, a one-of-a-kind artist, he's one of a generation, one
of a lifetime. He's a very rare commodity." 

But as his fame increased, so did his erratic behavior, and fans came to
expect the unexpected from O.D.B. 

When MTV News followed him around at the height of his popularity, he took
the camera crew and several of his kids (he was said to have more than a
dozen, by numerous mothers) to the welfare office - in a limousine - to get
an allotment of food stamps. 

And he received them. 

In February 1998, he crashed the stage at the Grammy Awards and hijacked a
microphone from singer Shawn Colvin (news
<http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/celeb/*http:/news.search.yahoo.com/search/
news?fr=news-storylinks&p=%22Shawn%20Colvin%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> )
as she accepted an award, apparently upset over losing the best rap album
Grammy to P. Diddy (then known as Puff Daddy (news
<http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http:/news.search.yahoo.com/search
/news?fr=news-storylinks&p=%22Puff%20Daddy%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw>  -
web
<http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http:/search.yahoo.com/search?fr=w
eb-storylinks&p=Puff%20Daddy>  sites)). He complained that he spent a lot of
money for new clothes because he thought he was going to win. The rapper
later apologized. 

Over the years, he was wounded in shootings and arrested on a veritable
laundry list of charges, including menacing security officers, illegally
possessing body armor, driving with a suspended license, shoplifting and
threatening a former girlfriend. 

In 2000, after escaping a court-ordered stint in a California rehabilitation
center, authorities searched for him for a month. He was finally arrested in
Philadelphia - three days after performing in a New York City concert with
his Wu-Tang clique. 

He was sentenced in 2001 to two to four years in prison for drug possession,
plus two concurrent years for escaping from the clinic. He was released in
2003 and immediately signed with Roc-a-Fella. 

He heralded his return with a news conference alongside singer Carey - pop
fans may know him best for his memorable cameo on her hit "Fantasy,"
featuring rhymes like "me and Mariah, go back like babies with pacifiers." 

Tesoriero said O.D.B. had been working on his comeback album for more than a
year and was almost finished. 

"Russell inspired all of us with his spirit, wit, and tremendous heart,"
Roc-A-Fella founder Damon Dash said in a statement. "The world has lost a
great talent, but we mourn the loss of our friend." 

His mother, Cherry Jones, said she received the news of her son's death in a
phone call, which she called "every mother's worst dream." 


 

 

"To the public he was known as Old Dirty Bastard, but to me he was known as
Rusty. The kindest most generous soul on earth," her statement said.
"Russell was more than a rapper, he was a loving father, brother, uncle, and
most of all, son." 

(Corrects Wu-Tang to 9 members, sted 8, in 4th graf. INSERTS 1 graf after
5th pvs, 'The Wu-Tang...,' to RAISE RZA quote from end of story. SUBS 7th
graf pvs, 'When MTV...,' to ADD he arrived at welfare office in a limo.
INSERTS 1 graf after 10th pvs, 'Over the years...,' to ADD that he once
performed a concert while sought by authorities. Note contents of rapper's
name throughout. Should stand.)

"Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE, sponsor) and Senator

Dam it, I wished you would have told me you went pee in my punch before I
drank it! Now I know why it was so freaking salty! 

I hate when I want to blame every horrible thing on Bush Small Nuts and
can't! Well in my tiny world everything I don't like is his fault ;-)

Loveworks Resident DJ Bio: MATT VALENZ In a world overtaken by automation=
=20
and technology, soul can be a hard thing to come by.  For someone lucky=20

area, then moved on to start a career in the music business when he=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WU-Tang founder dies :-( Rapper O.D.B. Collapses, Dies in Studio

Fuck, us Staten Islander's just can't catch a break.

Not only do we have LA County Prosecutor Marcia Clark, she of Susan
Wagner High School Class of '71, best known as the dropper of the OJ
Simpson ball, and Jeb Stuart Magruder, of Watergate fame, from there,
we also have Emilio Estevez and ugh, Christina Aguilera both being
born there, and, now, there's this.

It's a sad day.

These things usually come in threes, and with Arafat gone as well, I
was kind of surprised to hear that our beloved and esteemed Vice
President made it out of the hospital yesterday, guess it's just
another example of how some prayers are answered and some ain't.

Subject: [sfraves] recount voter fraud update

this is the current i received from jeff fishers crew.


=)

matt

Please tell everyone that Jeff Fisher will not give up
until justice has
been served.
I am posting a letter that I sent to Ralph Nader today
on my website. The
letter is only
changed to protect the sender( who is afraid of being
put in harms way) (the
FBI, Ralph Nader, Al Sharpton and Russ Baker of The
Nation know the senders
name.) Its time that John Kerry and the DNC realize
that this election was
stolen and Americans were virtually raped of their
voting rights.  The
website is http://www.JeffFisherforCongress.com

Please help me preserve Democracy by spreading the
word that a revolution in
the United States started on November 2, 2004 and it
will not end until "We
the People" have a national  revote via paper ballot
with a manual recount
only.

So, AM I like really that retarded?  I hear about all these amazing parties 
after they happen...What gives?  Am I really getting that old to where I do 
not pay attention?  Or are my friends just forgetting about me?  (call 
me!!!)  I need to get out more, I need to see the great kids who I have been 
partying with for (just celebrated 8 yr anniversary partying amongst the UG 
SF crowd  :) ever...
I miss the good times, I miss the smiles, and most of all, I miss AndyW 
being a virgo ;)  (I miss the smiles the most)
Just wanted to let you all know that my heart is always with you guys 
whereever the party is, wether or not I see you, my spirit is there dancing 
my ass off, checking to find my future ex boyfriend (never any gay guys in 
the UG scene)  wassup with that!!>!!? lol

Much love to the SF scene, much respect for all of you have shaped my life 
very much so.
Blessings,

<sigh>  yes danny, you are.   sorry, but we were trying to keep it from 
you until you were old enough to understand. ;-)

really, all you gotta do is check your email every, oh, week or so.  
and if you want to do something on a given night, CALL US.  don't wait 
for someone to call you and then wonder why the phone never rings.

Hey Danny, sounds like you should check in with Osby more often, 'cause he 
seems to always know where the good undergrounds are.   :) 

and also, some of that stuff makes it onto Bayraves ... maybe not the real 
super underground ones but you can find some good events.

Subject: [sfraves] midgets threesome rumor totally false

whoever you are, I DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY to spread rumors about me.
it's not funny AT ALL. it's EVIL.

for the record, I HAVE NEVER HAD A THREESOME WITH A PAIR OF MIDGET HOOKERS.

I have never had carnal knowledge of ANY midget.

I'm sure you think this is funny but it's NOT.

I'm gonna FIND YOU.

We are greatly saddened to have to you that at about 5.30 pm Saturday Nov 
13th, John Balance, was killed in an accident at home.

Under the influence of alcohol he fell from the first floor landing, 
hitting his head on the floor some 15ft below.

Peter/Sleazy who was in the front room heard the noise, came out 
investigate and found him unconscious, though still breathing.

Balance was rushed to hospital, where his condition deteriorated, and he 
died soon after, without ever regaining consciousness.

There is no suggestion that this event was in any way deliberate, in fact, 
anything other than a tragic accident.

Unusually, Balance had been cheerful during the day, and was looking 
forward to seeing Ian at the weekend, and working on new recordings this week.

* * *

Our awareness that physical death is not an end, but merely a transition to 
a whole different part of existence, a new adventure, should by now be 
clear to everyone.

Jhonn has simply crossed over the Threshold...

As Thomas Olson wrote this morning: "Listening to some Coil songs now, and 
they are all sounding to me now as if they were written for this moment...."

Nevertheless the parting will be hard for us all. Fortunately there is much 
to be done that will keep us busy in the next few difficult weeks.

When we have more details we will post them.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

OH NO!!!

for those not in the know, john balance was one of the founding
members of throbbing gristle, and later: coil.  coil was one of
my favorite bands...my first downtempo CD was inspired from
their "solar lodge" song.

john, you will be missed.  out of order, comes chaos.

Sorry if it was previously posted. I had taken a long break away from
this list due to political thought persecution and now that the election
is over hopefully there will be less of that here.

Subject: [sfraves] Electronic dub?



Hey there was some mention of 'electronic dub' on this list a minute ago
... and after a conversation with a chum of mine, I'm more intrigued. I've
never heard this kind of music before? Someone mentioned 'Deadbeat'... are
there any other artists in this genre I should know about? Any places I
can purchase (or download) this music to get a feel for it?

Thanks. :)

Dammit I want to have a threesome with a pair of midget hookers! That is

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Electronic dub?

by "electronic dub", are you referring to stuff done by current
EDM artists?

there's quite a number of good compilations out there, notably
the stuff on the guidance label.  jack dangers and ben stokes
have done some real good stuff with their tino corp project:
check out the last two volumes of "tino's breaks" (#4 and 5).

groups like thievery corp, dzihan + kamien, kruder +
dorfmeister, boozoo bajou, etc have done dub remixes.

there was some stuff that bill laswell (of material) did called
"ambient dub" back in the mid 90s.  look up "divination" - i
know of two volumes.

there's also illbient dub:  check out "sub dub" for that...

that's all i can think of of the top of my head - i'm at work
right now.  email me back later, and i'll see what else i have
at home.

Looks like there's lots more too.

Sounds like there might be career possibilities if one chooses.

Subject: RE: RE: [sfraves] midgets threesome rumor totally false

Very interesting! Well I am saddened to admit it, but after careful review
of the below mentioned web sites (And I do mean careful thorough review) I
am really in no way turned on by midgets! I feel so bad I hope I have not
hurt any of those little peoples feelings :-) 

Now that we are on the topic of midgets..... I am trying to think out of all
the years I have gone to parties.... I have never seen a raver midget! Are
they anti-ravers? Does anyone know the answer to this! I think I am going to
loose sleep over this one! Has anyone every seen a midget raver in person?
Maybe if I actually find a raver midget, maybe I could only then possibly be
turned on! Please help me on my quest to find 1 candy raver midget and 1
break dancer midget. This is super important to me! I must know if they
truly exist! 

Please everyone, we all need to pull together as one and help Matt Downer
find these mini-compact ravers! 

Thanks for your help on this important quest!
MattD

I think I saw a small person at the Love Parade but
there were also kids there (including 3 of mine) so I

Music links...

Osby's exploits...

Oh I can go on and on.

Deadbeat is one of the better known artists on Germany's ~scape label.
His latest LP, "Something Borrowed, Something Blue" is very
representative of the "electronic dub" sound. Pretty much everything
else on the label has some sort of dub influence.

Other artists to look out for on ~scape are Burnt Friedman, Jan Jelinek
and Bus (Daniel Meteo and Tom Thiel). Meteo's own label, Meteosound,
recently released a various artists EP (on both 12" and CD) called
"Hitek" that has lots of great stuff on it, including a Monolake remix
of Apparat's "Steinholz" and a track by The Orb's Thomas Fehlmann.

Any discussion involving the words "electronic" and "dub" would be
incomplete without mention of Basic Channel, the German duo that put
Berlin dub on the map. They're at their dubbiest when they record as
Rhythm & Sound with reggae vocalists like Tikiman and Cornell Campbell.
They pressed 10" EPs with both a vocal and an instrumental which are
becoming increasingly rare, but they also recently released 12" and CD
compilations of the vocal and instrumental versions separately.

Other labels (and artists, in parens) to look out for include:

Zer0 G Sounds (Triton, GYS, Localfields)
Mosaic (Steve O'Sullivan, Bluetrain)
Background (Portable)
Contexterrior (Jay Haze, Ricardo Villalobos)
Atavisme (Pepe Bradock)
Force Tracks (Swayzak, Dub Taylor, Crane AK, MRI, Luomo)
Echochord (Mikkel Metal, DJ Daniel)
Mille Plateaux (the Clicks & Cuts compilations are amazing)

I've found a lot of this stuff at Amoeba in SF, but most of it I buy
online. Forced Exposure and Bent Crayon are both in the US, so the
turnaround is nice and quick, but you'll have better luck finding old
stuff at either Hard Wax in Berlin or Kompakt in Cologne. Unfortunately,
NONE of them have samples online. :(

Oh yeah, and I almost forgot to plug some of my own stuff! Here's a
little half-hour long piece I put together with Reaktor and Ableton Live
earlier this year that most certainly qualifies as "electronic dub":

Yeah, you heard me. D&B in the 510, huge upstairs club with HUGE, HUGE

dance floor, pool table, stage and a patio so you can drink and smoke at
the same time. Easy parking, 2 blocks from BART (last train to SF leaves
at 12:48am), and no neighbors to bitch about how fucking loud we are!

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) H.L. Mencken's vision coming to pass?

	Someone just sent this timely quote from H.L. Mencken, one of the 
great journalists of the 20th century:

"As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more 
and more closely, the inner soul of the people.  On some great and 
glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's 
desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright 
moron."

-H.L. Mencken (1880 - 1956)

	Mencken understood that the United States was set up as a republic, 
not a democracy, and clearly understood some of the problems with the 
latter form of government.

Peace, love & liberty,

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Breaks on An Epiphany Of Sound

I know that's got the attention of some of you!!  For the show today
(Tue.) I was able to hook up Azmyth (Equalize, www.sparxx.us) as our
guest.  That means nothing other than tasty breaks in the morning,
breken beat style.

Do tune in, 90.1 FM, and online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu from
9a-noon on Tuesday!

"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and
causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. . . . corporations
have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow,
and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by
working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated
in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
-- U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, Nov. 21, 1864
(letter to Col. William F. Elkins)

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] (BSP) Cannabass

Looking forward to 11/23 - gonna watch the ladies get ill-nasty on the 
decks!

I dunno what it is - but ripping D&B just sounds better to me when it's 
coming from the decks of the fairer sex.

It's almost the only time I like hard styles of jungle. Beyond that I prefer 
liquid funk and the jazzy/funky & reggae/ragga style shit (which might 
explain my recent D&B record shopping spree - I had to buy that sorta stuff 
cuz I never hear it played out).

Ode to an Ol' Dirty Bastard
He left behind a violent legacy and possibly a dozen children. But the 
Wu-Tang Clan rapper also helped forge an irresistible 
pan-Asian-ghetto-gangsta style.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Pete L'Official

SALON.COM (PAID SUB)

Nov. 16, 2004  |  Outrageous. Unpredictable. Deranged, possibly. 
Irresponsible, certainly. But I don't care what anybody says. Ol' Dirty 
Bastard was avant-garde as hell.

"Avant-garde" was originally a military term, referring to an advanced 
group forging an assault on the enemy ahead. And O.D.B., whose given name 
was Russell Tyrone Jones, and his fellow members of the Wu-Tang Clan were 
way ahead of the rest -- a radically unique collection of some of the most 
charismatic and creative rappers ever to rhyme two lines. Their 1993 album, 
"Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers," not only did more for Timberland boots 
and black ski masks than any corporate ad campaign ever could, but put East 
Coast rap firmly back on the map, a full year before Puff Daddy and Bad Boy 
Records wrested the mike away from the West Coast's Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and 
Suge Knight's Death Row Records.

Wu-Tang artists RZA, GZA (Robert Diggs and Gary Grice, cousins to Jones), 
Method Man, Raekwon and Ghostface, among others, went on to have solo album 
success both critically and commercially, and the Wu were among the first 
groups to get involved in the licensed hip-hop fashion bonanza with their 
label, Wu-Wear.

But what made the Wu-Tang Clan -- named in honor of the Wu-Tang school of 
sword fighting featured in the kung fu flicks so idolized by the rap 
group's members -- truly brilliant was their vibrant, irresistible 
aesthetic. Hip-hop always had its thugs, even thugs who wrote rhymes 
employing complex verse structures. But thugs who spliced arcane 
mythologies with intricately constructed, Asian-gothic beats with kung fu 
movie audio samples were a new phenomenon. Their self-mythologizing and pop 
culture referencing (preceded by Run D.M.C.'s shelltoe Adidas/gold rope 
chain aesthetic) came long before Quentin Tarantino exploited his love of 
Asian "grindhouse" cinema in "Kill Bill," Vol. 1 and 2, which were, 
incidentally, scored by the RZA.

Wu-Tang hailed from Staten Island, and the tiny, oft-forgotten part of New 
York was transformed into Shaolin Island in their pan-Asian-ghetto-gangsta 
conception. Their radio-ready aesthetic evoked the nostalgia of Saturday 
afternoons spent embroiled in heady chop-socky dramas like "Five Deadly 
Venoms" or "Shaolin Temple II." And it gave these gifted personalities 
their own individual legends, built out of a hybridized Afro-Asian folklore.

O.D.B., who died of as yet undetermined causes in a recording studio in 
Manhattan on Saturday, was an integral part of that aesthetic. Even in a 
group that featured larger-than-life personas, like the now 
near-ubiquitous(ly high) Method Man, or the GZA's labyrinthine verse 
stylings, saying that O.D.B. managed to distinguish himself is a massive 
understatement. He was called Ol' Dirty Bastard because, as stated in an 
interlude on "36 Chambers," "There ain't no father to his style."

Ol' Dirty's gold-toothed, marble-mouthed, free-associative nonsense raps 
ran in topic from not-so-subtle threats ("Do you wanna get your teeth 
knocked the fuck out?") to wistful remembrances of lost love and its 
painful aftermath ("Burn me/ I get into shit/ I let it out like diarrhea/ 
got burned once/ but that was only gonohrrea"). He wrote rhymes for the 
ladies too. Almost always playful -- which was whenever he wasn't inviting 
muthafuckas to step to him on his "Brooklyn Zoo" turf -- O.D.B. famously 
rapped, "Me and Mariah/ go back like babies with pacifiers," in a duet with 
Mariah Carey from 1995's "Fantasy" (the remixed Tom Tom Club track). O.D.B. 
also saw his biggest hit come as a result of matching his gravelly tones 
with the sweet sounds of Kelis and a showy Neptunes beat on "Got Your 
Money," off of his 1999 album, "Nigga Please."

Raw energy loosed in lyrical form, O.D.B. had no qualms about singing -- 
well, murdering -- melodies in his songs, continuing in the fine tradition 
of notoriously off-key soloist and rap legend Biz Markie. It's a tradition 
that has survived to today with Kanye West, André 3000, Mos Def and 
Pharrell Williams offering pitch-unperfect, but heartfelt, recordings.

As a performer, he was our raging, amphetamined id whose "non-style" of 
sorts reminds me of a classic James Brown lyric: "I don't know karate, but 
I know c-razy." O.D.B. knew crazy. He was the personification of the phrase 
"I just don't give a fuck" long before Eminem had any claim to it, and 
O.D.B.'s trademark growl made it OK for rapper DMX to bark his way through 
his albums, selling millions of records with each successive "Ruff, Ruff."

But such reckless disregard for any accepted conventions, especially those 
having to do with the law, will usually get you into trouble whenever you 
do step over the line. And O.D.B. was a habitual line-stepper.

In 1994, O.D.B. took MTV News cameras into a limousine with him and several 
of his kids (he was said to have more than a dozen, by numerous mothers, 
though his wife of 13 years, Icelene Jones, claims he only has three -- 
with her), and drove to a welfare office to collect food stamps.

Arrested in 1997 for failing to pay nearly a year's worth of child support 
for three children he had with his wife, O.D.B.'s rap sheet would get only 
longer. He pleaded guilty to attempted assault on his wife in 1998, then 
two months later was shot in the back in what he claimed was a robbery of 
his Brooklyn home. Later that year he was arrested for shoplifting $50 
sneakers in Virginia Beach, Va., and was charged with making "terrorist 
threats" at the House of Blues in Los Angeles.

In a wonderful media moment of raw honesty and perhaps a little 
intoxication, O.D.B. attended the 1998 Grammys and, disappointed that 
Wu-Tang lost out to Puffy for best rap album, grabbed the microphone from a 
stunned Shawn Colvin and addressed the crowd. "Please calm down," he said. 
"I went and bought me an outfit today that cost me a lot of money, because 
I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win. I don't know how you all see it, but 
when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children. We teach the 
children. Puffy is good, but Wu-Tang is the best. I want you all to know 
that this is O.D.B., and I love you all, peace." The day before he had 
rescued a 4-year-old girl from a car wreck in Brooklyn.

Always a pioneer, O.D.B. became the first person arrested under a new 
California law that prevented convicted felons from wearing bulletproof 
vests in 1999. His legal troubles, particularly that year and beyond, were 
many -- and certainly not to be glorified or glamorized -- but he did 
manage to carry off some of these with a certain amount of panache. In 
October 2000, O.D.B. chose to escape from custody while being transported 
to court from a Pasadena, Calif., rehab center, but true to his iconoclast 
form, he didn't keep a low profile like any ol' fugitive. He not only 
recorded part of an album with RZA, but also appeared onstage to perform 
with the rest of the Clan at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom in November 
2000. He was finally arrested in the parking lot of a McDonald's in 
Philadelphia two nights later by an officer who recognized him because her 
son was a fan. He was later sentenced to two years behind bars in upstate 
New York.

Upon his release, he immediately signed with Roc-A-Fella Records and began 
work on a new album, which was nearing completion at the time of his passing.

Say what you want to say about O.D.B. He certainly would have said whatever 
the fuck he wanted to say about you. Perhaps his is a case where person and 
persona were too tightly wrapped up within one another; one certainly fed 
off the other, for better or worse. A lot of his behavior was pretty 
indefensible, but the energy and eccentricity he brought to hip-hop will be 
missed -- and nearly impossible to replace -- as a result of his tragically 
young death. He would have been 36 years old Monday.

What more can say about O.D.B., Ol' Dirty, Osirus, Joe Bannanas [sic], Dirt 
Dog, Unique Ason, Dirt McGirt, or however the matchless Mr. Jones chooses 
to refer to himself in the afterlife. My personal favorite was Big Baby 
Jesus, a name that, to questions regarding its provenance, he explained, "I 
always been Jesus. I don't know what the big secret's been all these 
years." In fact, maybe it's better to let him speak for himself one last 
time, from the intro to his first solo album, in all his proudly ignoble glory:

"My name is Mr. Russell Jones. 'Scuse me for that one, I had to let that 
one loose. Tonight, you're gonna see something that you've never seen 
before. Something that nobody in the history of rap ever set they self to 
do. This fucking guy that I speak to you about is something crazy, he's 
something insane. He's the greatest performer ever since. Uh. James Brown. 
He's bad, and he's a cool guy, and you need to really get to know him. 
Ladies and gentlemen, from all houses to all towns. From the Moon, to 
Pluto, back down to Earth. Ladies and gentlemen, one more time, give it up, 
for the Ol' Dirty Doggie. I mean, the Ol'. Dirty. Bastard. I love that guy."

Me too.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Ok here is not your average response to an Xtort BSP post.

How bout you do this for one of your parties.

You get all the DJ's and people on this list that bitch about your parties 
to submit a demo. And create a list of columns for the various styles that 
the DJ's play and based on the submissions you give that list of DJ names 
for the various styles to this list to vote and or choose some of the best 
submissions for those paticular styles. And there ya go you have a 
completely **NEW** lineup for your next event. I think that would stop the 
bitching of those few on this list.


I think bashing Xtort is old now cause they are not going to change there 
ways they have a simple easy party method like skillz etc.. and it works. Im 
personally done with bashing them. But I do challenge them to do a party as 
I have suggested since they have a draw and rep. They can pull it of if they 
truly wanted too.

Wired article:
http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,65704,00.html

WASHINGTON -- Several lobbying camps from different industries and
ideologies are joining forces to fight an overhaul of copyright law,
which they say would radically shift in favor of Hollywood and the
record companies and which Congress might try to push through during a
lame-duck session that begins this week.

The bill lumps together several pending copyright bills including
HR4077, the Piracy Deterrence and Education Act, which would
criminally punish a person who "infringes a copyright by ... offering
for distribution to the public by electronic means, with reckless
disregard of the risk of further infringement." Critics charge the
vague language could apply to a person who uses the popular Apple
iTunes music- sharing application.

The bill would also permit people to use technology to skip
objectionable content -- like a gory or sexually explicit scene -- in
films, a right that consumers already have. However, under the
proposed law, skipping any commercials or promotional announcements
would be prohibited. The proposed law also includes language from the
Pirate Act (S2237), which would permit the Justice Department to file
civil lawsuits against alleged copyright infringers.

All:

The House has passed HR 2391, which is being considered by the Senate =
today (11/16).  Successful passage by the Senate will put this bill on =
the President's desk late this year or early next.

This bill makes it a violation of the Copyright Act to skip commercials =
using a technological means (hardware or software) -- and it makes it a =
violation to make the computer program that allows people to skip =
commercials.  You can get information on the bill here:

http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.r.02391:
http://www.publicknowledge.org/pdf/HR_2391.pdf

and you can read the Wired story on the bill here:

http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,65704,00.html

In section 212 there is an exemption IF:

(A) no fixed copy of the altered version of the motion picture is
created by such computer program or other technology; and

(B) no changes, deletions or additions are made by such computer program
or other technology to commercial advertisements, or to network or
station promotional announcements, that would otherwise be performed or
displayed before, during or after the performance of the motion
picture.';


But this seems quite abiguous and the original intent for this exemption =
is for skipping of motion picture scenes that may be deemed "obscene", =
especially when it comes to such "devices" such as home PVR systems that =
run on a computer.

My suggestion is call your Senators and Representatives and let them =
know that it is ridiculous to make it illegal for you to skip =
commercials (assuming you agree that it is).

You can reach your Senators and Representatives through the Capitol =
switchboard at (202) 224-3121 or (202) 225-3121.  Or you can email them =
by going to their web sites, which you can find through www.senate.gov =
or www.house.gov.

Thanks for the suggestions Van, but our lineup works
out just fine for our fanbase...we highly doubt you're
the kind of person who would go to these, but we
appreciate your input as always :)

Thank you Nick...for once a constructive comment
instead of Van of Macadio's typical "this sucks, book
someone new" comments.

Do you have links to their sites?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] ~*EXPANDER*~ Jan.22nd.2005 (*NEW VENUE*/ALL AGES/$5)(XTORT) *BSP*

Hey Macadio...I think that your suggestion rocks and
makes complete sense, but here's the gist of it. The
people that come to our shows ask for the lineups we
have. Of course it never hurts to throw in new
talented people, but to get rid of the core headliners
that we have would negatively affect our event. The
majority of the DJs that most of us would recommend
are ideal for an older 21+ crowd...that's going to be
problematic for our events. But we're always open so
if people take the intiative to get us the info, we'll
totally look into it.

Thanks

Sascha

raving is bad
raving is not for you
raving is a culture of escape
raving is not a crime
raving is good for the soul
raving is not about drugs
raving is all about the music

techno is dead
techno is the short answer
techno is not just 'mindlessly repetitive dance music' made
automatically by computers
techno is about the space between beats
techno is back
techno is everywhere
techno is not salvation

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP - Random Acts of Art - Wednesday Nov. 17th, 2004 @ Loft 11

	As far as art shows with a cover charge go, there's always Costco. 
They offer quite an amazing selection of art including the Campbell's 
Soup cans which inspired Andy Warhol -- now is your chance to go and 
see the real thing on the shelves for a low price in a large, bust-free 
warehouse space. They'll even loan you a classic American-style 
shopping cart (value over $100) in which to wheel around your artistic 
purchases.

	But my personal preference is Safeway. The art's slightly more on the 
high end, but they don't charge a cover, and they've already installed 
natural thunderstorm sound effects in the ambient produce section. The 
main sound system could use an upgrade and the MCs are weak as fuck, 
but perhaps this will change when they start getting real, in-store 
DJs. And get this -- they have a permit to go 24 hours.

	Perhaps someone will print this email out and take it to the Random 
Acts of Art show so that they can be aware of their competition.   8)

Groove on,

I like Xtort's parties. Sure there's a certain amount of similarity between 
one party and the next, but there are a lot of young party kids in Sac who like 
the DJs that Sascha23 books. The parties are not identical, though. It was 
cool seeing DJ Kuma from Japan not long ago, and at Xpander there will be DJ Jak 
from Portland. 

Apparently there are a lot of DJs who would like to get into the lineup ... 
but this is just one promoter all the way out in Sac ... There are tons of 
other promoters throwing other parties, and aren't there, like, dozens of 21+ 
clubs in SF you could be spinning at?  Why pick on Xtort? Maybe their parties seem 
more noticeable because they're promoted well in advance, they occur pretty 
frequently, and the flyers have a similar look.
I thought Macadio's idea for getting new DJs was a good one. If Sascha goes 
for it, I hope these DJs attract a good crowd. We might find out that the Sac 
kids do indeed like Breaks or some other style they're not hearing now.

hmmm i wonder about that ... I like SF Raves but I think a lot more people 
rely on Bayraves. Certainly sfraves is not the ONLY resource. 

If I was about to leave for a party and wanted to find last minute 
information, I would go to Bayraves first. I wouldn't expect to find it on sfr -- maybe 
in the olden days but not now. 
i <3  sfr though

	Actually I was probably being unfair... if an event is offering free 
hors d'ouvres and wine tasting along with a live DJ, it doesn't seem 
unreasonable to charge $5. I guess my dig was partly also at the 
mindset that says "anything can be art." But maybe that was not 
necessarily implied by the title "Random Acts of Art." The pictures on 
the flier actually look quite cool. Of course if the space has a f----- 
up door policy, that's another matter...

The funny thing about Googlism, is the algorithm they use to search pages 
returns results from Documents on web sites across the WWW:

Googlism is not affiliated with Google, but powered by Google Search 
Results.  In effect, all of these phrases are taken from pages on the web 
that were randomly indexed by Google's robot and spiders.

From: http://www.googlism.com/about.htm

Explanation of technologies:

Who  	The Googlism.com concept was conceived by Paul Cherry and 
creatively programmed by Chris Morton. Googlism.com is in no way 
affiliated, sponsored or in any way the property of, or responsibility of 
Google.com (Google Inc). However, we do use Google.com for creating our 
exciting and funny results. If you have any comments, suggestions or 
otherwise, please contact us at mailto:support@googlism.com Googlism.com 
is owned by an Australian company Domain Active, there we go, we saved you 
the hassle of doing a whois.

What 	Googlism was created as a fun tool to see what Google "thinks" of 
certain topics and people. Of course, the results are not really Google's 
opinion, they're yours, the web site owners of the world. Within the 
Google results are thousands of your thoughts and opinions about thousands 
of different topics, people, names, things and places, we simply search 
Google and let you know what website owners think about the name or topic 
you suggested.

When 	The Googlism idea was formulated in September 2002 and developed 
that month for a world wide release in early October 2002. Welcome to 
Googlism.com, what are your Googlisms? NEWS! Sometime early January 2004, 
Google.com adopted measures to prevent Googlism.com from querying the 
Google servers to find new Googlisms. We are not upset, due to the immense 
popularity of Googlism.com, we were requesting an average of 15,000 unique 
queries a day. We have just over 1.7 million unique Googlisms in total and 
since opening we served around 16 million total searches, or an average of 
35,000 searches per day.

Where 	Googlism.com has received links from thousands of webmasters and 
websites all around the world. We have had online reviews in PCMag.com, 
About.com, ZDNet.com, and many more. Print articles in worldwide magazines 
and newspapers, including one book that we know of. There are a couple of 
pages about Googlism in "Google Hacks - 100 Industrial-Strength Tips and 
Tricks" By Tara Calishain and Rael Dornfest.

<3 Karina

If you search Google for the exact phrase, "sfraves is pretty much the 
only resource for current dance music events in the bay area"

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=sfraves+is+pretty+much+the+only+resource+for+current+dance+music+events&btnG=Google+Search

I didn't find a page with that exact result, so the search they use might 
include other pages from a larger index of web site collections, but 
interestingly enough, first hit / Result has this URL is indexed - The 
Best of Bay, 1999 Awards, which Hyperreal/SFRaves won an award for
"Best Local Online Rave Resource"

http://www.bestofthebay.com/1999/enter.html

Here's the exact URL on the page:

Sorry to hear that, but I think you've made yourself
clear Chris (through at least 3 or 4 emails in the
past)...in fact I have no idea why you keep emailing
us about this. There was nothing in reference to you
in that email (or in regards to booking
you)...appreciate the comments though and good luck
with your record label :)

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

elementary/middle school students...
starchild is a tale spun in sound and light
starchild is the extensive degree of high
starchild is uniformly 40% of normal density
starchild is very likely to prove out to be not entirely human
starchild is a love story set against a backdrop of eternity
starchild is aimed at ages 4 [uh, make that "4 and up"]
starchild is now stronger than ever
starchild is proof of something extraterrestrial
starchild is an excellent science fiction romance
starchild is a very magical performer
starchild is a quarter fairy and therefore can grow rather impressive 
butterfly wings when she likes
starchild is off to battle space pirates [I assume they meant "City 
Hall pirates"]
starchild is a witch cum magician
starchild is coming [Oh yeah, oh, it feels so good! Oh, oh, oh!!!]

	And then the unflattering:

Luv & laughs,

Haha, hi there Chris...it's most likely something from
CJB. It's not from the site itself.

Thanks for checking out the site though :)

We'll have an actual update tomorrow too so check it
out again.

That's right everyone...all the crazy discussions
aside...it's time for everyone to go out and get a
copy of Half-Life 2 (I can't believe it's out). Not
only is the game amazing, it'll be great fun to play
some CS again with the new graphics engine.

The $5 door price is to help recoop the cost of the venue, pay for the
catering company which is offering hors d'ouvres, and also to help pay
the winery which is offering wine tasting.... all of which cost money.

the people throwing this event are not being showcased in the art show
and i was told are not even profiting from the sales that the artists
make.  they are trying to get publicity for some local artists while
at the same time trying to recoop some of the cost to throw the event.

if you think that $5 is too much, then don't go.  



my only involvement with this event is that a friend is throwing it -
i will not even be in attendance.  the only reason i sent this
information to this list is because i thought perhaps someone on here
might be interested in it.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands

-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

If it's a busy night, they suddenly develop a "dress code" that's basically
used to keep out whoever doesn't fit their chic trash image.  It's
completely nebulous and changes based on who they want in or out.  If the
night's dead, the dress code dissapears.  If you question the bouncer about
it, he threatens you for remaining on "their" sidewalk.  I moved to SF to
avoid that game, not support it.  I know a lot of venue owners are all about
the $$$, but Loft 11 is so transparent about it that it sickens me...

Is it better than Halo 2?

Halo 2 is pretty damn cool.  The section where you race down underground
freeways and huge bridges fighting the covenant is really incredible...
jumping onto Ghosts and throwing the aliens off...

Action movies are suddenly lame.  I want to *be* the action, not watch it...

You can try setting up a proxy server, but bear in mind your IT group
will be able to see your activity, which in some cases could get you
layed off

If you have a shell account somewhere outside your firewall, you can set
up a tunnel over ssh (assuming your company allows outbound ssh
connections). "Internet access" isn't very specific, I'm assuming you mean
"web access".

True.  There's some project out there that uses ssl plus a peer to peer 
style network to keep the traffic watchers guessing.  I can't remember 
what it is off the top of my head, I'll see if I can't find it.  There was 
an article on /. about it within the past few months though.

I tried it out, while it was slow it definately worked well.

That's not true is it?  They'll still be able to see
the unusual traffic (even if they can't read it) which
they may or may not decide to investigate further. 
Depends on the company and why/what they are blocking.
 

I'd suggest that if you want to keep your job you
shouldn't attempt to circumvent their blocks.  Doing
so would clearly be legal grounds for termination and
you wouldn't even be eligible for unemployment.

Just my .02 of course.

Let me begin by saying that Jak is the best techno deejay native to the West
Coast I've ever heard. It is a treat having him in Sacramento a couple of
times a year. 

However, just to let you know, Kuma and Jak both come to play in Sacramento
from Portland. Kuma may be Japanese, but he's not coming to Cali from
Japan... Not whatsoever. 

They've both played Xtort at least three times as well.

I like Xtort's parties. Sure there's a certain amount of similarity between 
one party and the next, but there are a lot of young party kids in Sac who
like 
the DJs that Sascha23 books. The parties are not identical, though. It was 
cool seeing DJ Kuma from Japan not long ago, and at Xpander there will be DJ
Jak 
from Portland.

Broadband is coming SOON!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Run out and get Half-Life 2 now :)

Just to clarify...Halo 2 is awesome,but Half-Life 2 is
officially the *BEST* adventure/FPS in the industry.
It's use of scripted storytelling and putting "you" in
the role of Gordon Freeman is untouchable and well
worth the 5 year wait.

You need a PC to play and to get decent performance
and still have lots of fun...this is what you'll need.

System Requirements : Windows 98/ME/2000/XP, AMD 1.5
or Pentium III 1.6 Ghz or better, 256MB RAM, 64MB
DirectX 9.0 video card, 12X CDROM, DirectX 9.0
compatible sound card, Keyboard, Mouse

NOW GO GO GO and game...

Well I haven't played Half-Life 2, but I played Half-Life 1 from
start to finish, and it (perhaps until HL2) was the best computer
game ever written, period. It was that good.

That's the legal filesharing service Weedshare.  

Weedshare is an interesting model for underground
artists especially I think. Check it out...

P.S. the eBay thing hasn't been officially announced
so shush.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Run out and get Half-Life 2 now :)

	I don't know -- the new generation of video games somehow don't do it  
for me. Admittedly I haven't played many video games for a long time,  
but the ones I got the most out of were probably Ms. Pacman, Joust,  
Tetris, etc.

	Imagine a chess game. You see the pieces in front of you and move  
them. The game mechanics are simple and right there in front of you,  
with minimal bells and whistles. Now imagine a 3-D chess game where the  
figures on the board are life-size, and you're moving around among  
them. The board has become a landscape complete with terrain features,  
birds flying around, and so on. Every move, you see the pieces walking  
around, fighting each other in elaborate battles with cool moves and  
sound effects, etc. Now say you want to have a game of chess. Both have  
been around a while, although the second one keeps getting various  
upgrades to make it slightly more exciting or realistic, so most of the  
novelty factor is gone. Which version of the game do you choose to  
play? Not necessarily the second one. Sometimes all those extras are  
beside the point. I'm kind of curious to see Halo 2 from all the hype,  
but I don't know if it's really something I'll have an urge to own and  
play regularly.

	I also think there will always be the equivalent of "movies," no  
matter how far video game or virtual reality technology eventually  
progress. In a movie, the viewer is an omnipresent god. You get the  
best view of all the action, effortlessly. You see and hear everything  
important. You don't get stuck and spend twenty minutes trying to  
figure out how to jump between buildings. Even actors like to watch  
movies and go to the theater.

Groove on,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Why I love Loft 11 by Andrew Phelan

I've got a spoiler-

The celebrity guest is none other then porn magnate Jules Jordan.
As the genius behind such titles as "Weapons Of Ass Destruction", I'm sure
he'll be arriving in full force.

Some of you have probably seen him around parties here and there-
I think he was at the otherworld halloween shindig wearing some black
body-armor sort of thing-

Eats Tapes (SFBayGuardian Review)
If you need music to pump you up for a night on the town, Eats Tapes is
the answer. Bandmates and lovebirds Gregory Zifcak and Marijke
Jorritsma bring the jams to a new level of awesomeness. Their
self-titled, 14-minute CD-R EP starts off with "Supreme Master," in
which the first thing a listener hears is this unbelievably catchy, raw
E.Q. blast. It's a cute riff that's dynamically layered with bass drum,
a weird industrial dripping and banging sound, bass guitar groove, and
an all-out drum-machine dance assault that could get Muqtada Al-Sadr
tapping his toes in jubilation. "Animal Minded" is reminiscent of a
night when someone has, unbeknownst to you, dosed your drink with
hallucinogens, so that you find yourself in an alley booty-shaking with
a homeless man around a fire burning in a 50-gallon barrel. And
"Knightress" brings you full circle: you're back inside the renegade
warehouse dance fest, getting in groove with the pounding bass drum,
the blips and bleeps of the shredded E.Q., and the cheeseball hand
claps, feeling the coda  a crescendo analogous to the grand finale of
a good fireworks show. This EP can take you there. It's self-released,
so e-mail nein_oh_nein@yahoo.com to buy a copy, or better yet, catch
the duo live. (Ben Valis)

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Music and the Brain

"Music surrounds usand we wouldn't have it any other
way. An exhilarating orchestral crescendo can bring
tears to our eyes and send shivers down our spines.
Background swells add emotive punch to movies and TV
shows. Organists at ballgames bring us together,
cheering, to our feet. Parents croon soothingly to
infants.

And our fondness has deep roots: we have been making
music since the dawn of culture. More than 30,000
years ago early humans were already playing bone
flutes, percussive instruments and jaw harps--and all
known societies throughout the world have had music.
Indeed, our appreciation appears to be innate. Infants
as young as two months will turn toward consonant, or
pleasant, sounds and away from dissonant ones. And
when a symphony's denouement gives delicious chills,
the same kinds of pleasure centers of the brain light
up as they do when eating chocolate, having sex or
taking cocaine."

The following appeared in the Columbus Dispatch on 11/16/04 written by Joe
Blundo, a Dispatch columnist.

Canada busy sending back Bush-dodgers.

The flood of American liberals sneaking across the border into Canada has
intensified in the past week, sparking calls for increased patrols to stop
the illegal immigration.

  The re-election of President Bush is prompting the exodus among
left-leaning citizens who fear they'll soon be required to hunt, pray and
agree with Bill O'Reilly.

  Canadian border farmers say it's not uncommon to see dozens of sociology
professors, animal-rights activists and Unitarians crossing their fields at
night.

  "I went out to milk the cows the other day, and there was a Hollywood
producer huddled in the barn," said Manitoba farmer Red Greenfield, whose
acreage borders North Dakota.

  The producer was cold, exhausted and hungry.

  "He asked me if I could spare a latte and some free-range chicken. When I
said I didn't have any, he left. Didn't even get a chance to show him my
screenplay, eh?"

  In an effort to stop the illegal aliens, Greenfield erected higher fences,
but the liberals scaled them. So he tried installing speakers that blare
Rush Limbaugh across the fields.

  "Not real effective," he said. "The liberals still got through, and Rush
annoyed the cows so much they wouldn't give milk."

  Officials are particularly concerned about smugglers who meet liberals near
the Canadian border, pack them into Volvo station wagons, drive them across
the border and leave them to fend for themselves.

  "A lot of these people are not prepared for rugged conditions," an Ontario
border patrolman said. "I found one carload without a drop of drinking
water. They did have a nice little Napa Valley cabernet, though."

  When liberals are caught, they're sent back across the border, often
wailing loudly that they fear retribution from conservatives. Rumors have
been circulating about the Bush administration establishing re-education
camps in which liberals will be forced to drink domestic beer and watch
NASCAR.

  In the days since the election, liberals have turned to sometimes-ingenious
ways of crossing the border.  Some have taken to posing as senior citizens
on bus trips to buy cheap Canadian prescription drugs. After catching a
half-dozen young vegans disguised in powdered wigs, Canadian immigration
authorities began stopping buses and quizzing the supposed senior-citizen
passengers.

  "If they can't identify the accordion player on The Lawrence Welk Show, we
get suspicious about their age," an official said.

  Canadian citizens have complained that the illegal immigrants are creating
and organic-broccoli shortage and renting all the good Susan Sarandon
movies.

  "I feel sorry for American liberals, but the  Canadian economy just can't
support them," an Ottawa resident said. "How many art-history majors does
one country need?"

  In an effort to ease tensions between the United States and Canada, Vice
President Dick Cheney met with the Canadian ambassador and pledged that the
administration would take steps to reassure liberals, a source close to
Cheney said.

  "We're going to have some Peter, Paul & Mary concerts. And we might put
some endangered species on postage stamps. The president is determined to
reach out."

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Yes, the times they are a changin'

Tuesday, November 16, 2004
By Tony Norman
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

Back in the days when this was a free country, it was possible to sing an 
antiwar song like "Masters of War" without having to give the Secret 
Service a second thought.

But 41 years after Bob Dylan recorded his elegiac, acoustically spare 
meditation on the folly of war, the lyrics are still causing trouble with 
those H.L.Mencken referred to as the "booboisie."

Yes - when the Secret Service is reduced to promoting a local high
school band, the times truly are a' changing.   Have to hand it to
those kids - it's not every high school punk band that can swing
thousands of dollars of free air time and a thousand words in a major
metropolitan paper.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr voter fraud update

here is the latest emailed to me from jeff fisher in
florida.----------

To Commissioner Aaronson and everyone I blind copied:
Please read this email and forward this to everyone
you know.
 
Mr. Aaronson is a County Commissioner in Palm Beach,
Florida. He is a Democrat who can be reached at (561)
355-2205 or you can email him at
BAARONSO@co.palm-beach.fl.us.
 
This to inform you all that the press has been
suppressing the news regarding the recount in New
Hampshire, Ohio and the efforts we are making leading
to the possible recount of Florida's certified votes.
Ask Mr. Aaronson to lead the charge in Palm Beach
County as he is famous for fighting for Democracy even
when the odds are stacked up against it or him.   Mr.
Aaronson is well respected and treated as a hero in
the Boca Raton area and he is very good friends with
Congressman Robert Wexler and State Senator Ron Klein.
 
Last night  my  website was hacked into and I can't
access it. The website
http://www.JeffFisherforCongress was altered three
times in the past 18 hours by those hackers. The
homepage is useless. Most of the links don't work. We
also have discovered that the ElectionFraud2004 yahoo
group through its moderator has been posting messages
to the net. However, since November 16, 2004 none of
those messages have reached the Internet after being
posted. ElectionFraud2004 acts like a town center for
people who want to post suspicious incidents and
information regarding this past General Election.
 
Update to this message: 1:30 p.m. November 20, 2004,
the yahoo group, Election Fraud 2004 posted messages
finally came through the Internet. Whomever had the
capability and technology to stop the messages from
going from the yahoo server to the net withheld it for
three plus days. That is how they can stop the news
from reaching the people in a timely fashion.
 
Update to this message: 3:30 p.m. November 20, 2004,
the website is up and running with the help of David
Toppings from Arizona. Thank you. America thanks Mr.
Toppings.
 
 
That is the act of a group of people who are trying to
suppress the truth. I can't prove who they are but let
the assumptions begin. I will find another way to get
the message out. I have just begun to fight for this
nation. If you know anything about the book DUNE, then
you will understand "the sleeper has awakened".
 
Jeff Fisher
561-889-2165
 
P.S. They have hacked into Bev Harris's computer
recently at Black Box Voting and several people that I
have been consulting with in the state of Washington,
North Carolina, New York, California and Minnesota. As
of today I am getting information that blog sites are
getting hacked into also.
 
Remember, the Watergate break-in was done by a few and
it took time for that to unfold. This time we have the
Internet and if "We the People" spread the word they
won't be able to stop all of us.
 

Email message from Wake Forest University:
Is the FBI investigation something that seems like it
will take a number of
months or could they potentially have some "official"
information prior to
the final nationwide certification of the election?
 
My answer to the person from Wake Forest University:
Regarding the FBI: The possibilities [before the
Electoral College meets] are still up in the air. The
reason for any hope lies with information that Russ
Baker from The Nation told us yesterday that he
thought it was important, but he didn't have the time
or resources to investigate. In addition, Eve Conant
of Newsweek has received copies of documents from the
"sender" that confirmed my earlier statements
regarding my meeting with the sender, when I saw some
of the documents regarding the 2000 and 2002 election.
  The information that Eve Conant received backs up
the senders" statement that it was going to happen in
multiple states during the 2004 General Election. The
information Russ Baker revealed to us on November 19,
2004 was that the sender gave him a copy of several
hundred names and corresponding social security
numbers that the sender claimed were used in the
2000 election to cast votes. Today, November 20, 2004
we learned that this appears to have happened in
Precinct 16 in Kansas City, Missouri during the 2004
General Election.

Is 'Fair Use' in Peril?

The far-reaching Intellectual Property Protection Act would
deny consumers many of the freedoms they take for granted.

By Eric Hellweg

November 19, 2004, technologyreview.com

http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/04/11/wo_hellweg111904.asp?trk=nl


Do you like fast-forwarding through commercials on a
television program you've recorded? How much do you like it?
Enough to go to jail if you're caught doing it? If a new
copyright and intellectual property omnibus bill sitting on
Congress's desk passes, that may be the choice you'll face.

How can this be possible? Because language that makes fast-
forwarding through commercials illegal-no doubt inserted at
the behest of lobbyists for the advertising industry-was
inserted into a bill that would allow people to fast forward
past objectionable sections of a recorded movie (and I bet you
already thought that was OK). And that's but one, albeit
scary, scenario that may come to pass if the Intellectual
Property Protection Act is enacted into law. Deliberations on
this legislation will be one of the tasks for the lame-duck
Congress that commenced this week.

In a statement last month, Senator John McCain stated his
opposition to this bill, and specifically cited the anti-
commercial skipping feature: 'Americans have been recording TV
shows and fast-forwarding through commercials for 30 years,'
he said. 'Do we really expect to throw people in jail in 2004
for behavior they've been engaged in for more than a quarter
century?'

Included in the legislation are eight separate bills, five of
which have already passed one branch of Congress, one of which
was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and two of
which have merely been proposed. By lumping all the bills
together and pushing the package through both houses of
Congress, proponents hope to score an enormous victory for
Hollywood and some content industries.

Here's more of what's included: a provision that would make it
a felony to record a movie in a theater for future
distribution on a peer-to-peer network. IPPA would also
criminalize the currently legal act of using the sharing
capacity of iTunes, Apple's popular music software program;
the legislation equates that act with the indiscriminate file
sharing on popular peer-to-peer programs. Currently, with
iTunes, users can opt to share a playlist with others on their
network. IPPA doesn't differentiate this innocuous-and Apple
sanctioned-act from the promiscuous sharing that happens when
someone makes a music collection available to five million
strangers on Kazaa or Grokster.

Not surprisingly, the bill has become a focal point for very
vocal parties. In favor of the legislation are groups such as
the Recording Industry Association of America, the Motion
Picture Association of America, and various songwriter, actor,
and director organizations. 'We certainly support it,' says
Jonathan Lamy, spokesperson for the RIAA. 'It includes a
number of things to strengthen the hand of law enforcement to
combat piracy. Intellectual property theft is a national
security crime. It's appropriate that the fed dedicate
resources to deter and prosecute IP theft.'

Against the bill stand a number of technology lobbying groups
and public-interest organizations. '[IPPA] is a cobbled-
together package to which Congress has given inadequate
attention. It is another step in Hollywood and the recording
industry's campaign to exert more control over content,' says
Gigi Sohn, president of Public Knowledge, a Washington, DC-
based public interest group that aims to alert the public to
fair use and consumer rights infringements, and fight those
perceived infringements in Washington.

Anyone attuned to the machinations of Congress the last two
years likely has become numb to the often overblown rhetoric
on this issue. Both sides use hyperbole-usually in the form of
calling a piece of legislation the death of an industry or the
death of individual rights. The 1982 statement to a
congressional committee by Jack Valenti, then head of the
MPAA, that the VCR is to Hollywood what the Boston Strangler
was to a woman alone still stands as the ne plus ultra of
exaggerated claims. And civil libertarians haven't met an
affront that didn't equal a stake through the heart of
individual rights. But IPPA demands attention not just from
Hill watchers, but from regular individuals. In part because
IPPA is such a broad, encompassing bill that could affect
things as pedestrian as fast-forwarding a commercial, but also
because with Senator Orrin Hatch-a very Hollywood-friendly
pol-on his way out as the chair of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, to be replaced possibly by Arlen Specter, many in
the Hollywood community see this as an important, last chance
to get their demands made into law.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

I would never spend $20 for some no-name out-of-towners and
local-talent.  Specially if that guy Andrew is playing.  I wouldn't
even accept $20 from him to watch him play.

House is so very very very not-grate!!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WEP Cracking

Alternately, you could get an antenna for your wireless network
adapter and try and find an open network; a full-power 100 mW (dude,
that's BUMPIN for unlicensed microwave radio) adapter (might I
recommend the OriNOCO Gold :-p) would also be helpful cracking a WEP
key requires a little more effort than is sometimes believed.  Check
out http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/26023 for more info.
 When they say WEP is insecure, they mean from governments and large
corporations with vast resources at their behest; on a smaller scale,
it's a somewhat reasonable solution.  It just seems a bit silly to
spend more time and effort to do something illegal when you can use an
open AP risk free.

wardriving is grate!

Just my $.02,

jonathan

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WEP Cracking

get a live linux cd like PHLAK. simply pop it into your cdrom drive,
and you boot into linux (it doesn't touch anything on your system...
you simply have a full running copy of linux after a couple minutes of
booting), and you will have all the tools like ethereal and airsnort
ready to go. even if you are not a linux person, you should be able to
figue it out, at least after reading a couple tutorials somewhere.
doing wep cracking through windows is a pain.

Once Again, Incumbents Are the Big Winners
Sunday, November  21, 2004

By Patrick Basham and John Samples

Election Day 2004 showed the power of incumbency in American politics.=20=

For the fourth time in row, incumbents in the House of Representatives=20=

won over 98 percent of their races.

And not only are they winning consistently, but they=92re doing so by=20
increasingly wider margins; incumbency now adds about 11 percent to the=20=

vote share of the average officeholder. The past three elections=20
constituted the least competitive elections (with one exception) since=20=

1946.

Some observers might argue that the overwhelming success of incumbents=20=

should not worry Americans. Voters, they say, are satisfied with their=20=

representatives. Perhaps that=92s true, but we suspect something else is=20=

at work: Incumbents have given themselves too many advantages in the=20
electoral game.

The congressional franking privilege allows incumbents to flood their=20
districts with mail that often is little more than taxpayer-funded=20
campaign literature. Large administrative and political staffs on=20
Capitol Hill and in district offices attend to the needs of voters, all=20=

the while stressing the qualities of their bosses.

Incumbents also receive taxpayer-subsidized travel, easy access to the=20=

media and, most recently, web sites to communicate with the electorate.=20=

And they have the power to deliver pork barrel spending to their=20
districts. The limits on all of those advantages are set by their=20
beneficiaries=97 the Congress members themselves.

Against those advantages, it is difficult for a challenger to oust an=20
incumbent without spending at least as much as, and probably more than,=20=

the incumbent. Only by spending large sums on television advertising,=20
direct mail solicitations and grassroots organization can a challenger=20=

develop the levels of name recognition, issue identification and voter=20=

mobilization to catch up with the years (and frequently decades) of=20
subsidized campaigning and pork barrel spending that so characterize an=20=

incumbent=92s term in office.

And the incumbents=92 advantages are growing.

Thirty years ago, in the wake of Watergate, Congress imposed=20
restrictions on campaign contributions. The more recent McCain-Feingold=20=

legislation has set that limit at $2,000 for a congressional candidate.=20=

Under the rhetorical guise of warding off unspecified corruption, an=20
incumbent is happy to cap contributions at $2,000 per contributor if=20
his challenger must operate under the same limit.

Certainly, an incumbent may detest the phone calls he has to make to=20
potential donors and the fundraising breakfasts, lunches and dinners he=20=

has to attend. But at night he sleeps well in the knowledge that his=20
challenger back home must do the same (more, if the challenger is=20
serious about winning) without, in most cases, a comparable network of=20=

contacts, donors and lobbyists whose longstanding collective investment=20=

in the incumbent=92s career ensures continuing financial commitment.

The difficulties of raising money have made it harder for challengers=20
to beat incumbents. They have also discouraged qualified, successful=20
people from putting themselves forward as candidates in the first=20
place, thereby reducing the quality of the pool of potential=20
challengers. So it should not surprise us that in this era of increased=20=

restrictions on campaign finance, there is also increasing electoral=20
success for incumbents.

Political gerrymandering has also helped incumbents. More and more=20
House districts have become safe for Democrats or Republicans thanks to=20=

redistricting by state legislatures. In nearly a third of this year=92s=20=

House races, the winning candidate (i.e., the incumbent) was either=20
unopposed or faced an opponent without campaign funds.

The public understands the electoral game is fixed. A Rasmussen poll=20
found 72 percent of Americans agreed with the statement that, =93In=20
American elections, members of Congress have unfair advantages over=20
people who want to run against them.=94

American elections do have competition between the political parties.=20
After all, the Democrats could win back the House and Senate in 2006.=20
What we lack is competition between insiders and outsiders. No one can=20=

seriously believe even 10 percent of incumbents will lose in 2006. This=20=

lack of competitive congressional elections is a direct consequence of=20=

public subsidy.

In the Federalist Papers, James Madison wrote that the House of=20
Representatives was a =93numerous and changeable body=94 that would most=20=

directly reflect the shifting popular will. These days, changes in the=20=

House are the rare exception rather than the democratic rule.=20
Representative democracy works best when voters have choices and=20
competition for office. Americans have too little of both now.

John Samples is director of the Center for Representative Democracy at=20=

the Cato Institute. Patrick Basham is a senior fellow in the Center.=20=

Subject: [sfraves] i'm thinking of going to 1015 this weekend - am i crazy?

hey all, so i'm thinking about going to 1015 folsom
this weekend for the show on sat. night w/ Abe Duque
(aka Kirilan) and Barbara Preisinger.  i haven't been
to 1015 in years and years, and i've never really
enjoyed myself there.  however, it's not like these
folks are playing anywhere else in the city anytime
soon, so.... a few questions:

is 1015 still an utter police state?  i assume there's
no in's and out's or anything, right?  is there a
smoking area?  my friend has a medical marijuana rx,
and asked me to ask about smoking, but i'm assuming
that's still a no go.  

also, anyone ever hear abe duque play?  my friend says
he's "tearing it up" and playing a lot of acid right
now, so i'm thinking i should check him out.  hoping
it won't be too trance-y.  i heard barbara preisinger
at movement in detroit, but unfortunately the sound
was so loud and unnuanced that i couldn't really tell
if she were that good or not and had to leave that
area. 

anyway, i think if i go w/ low expectations i might
enjoy myself.  i hope.  

take care,
monikat

1015 isn't so bad.  They would not stay in business if it
was.  Once you are inside, have a drink and enjoy the
music...

The humorous thing is, they look to be planning on shutting their doors
soon.  Well, nobody's misfortune is "humorous", but just in light of
your comment here, I chuckled a little.

I've had a few good times there and a few really nasty times.  It could
be a great spot again with better management and an updated
bookings/door policy outlook.

They need to turn that icepick sound DOWN though..  After being
pleasantly buffetted with Funktion One systems at Mezzanine @ Club 6 I
can't really listen to crap sound at clubs anymore :)

When a teeny club like Anu can have a listenable sound system with a
total investment of maybe $8k, it boggles the mind when a megaclub has
shite sound.

Anyway, I digress.

i'm going, as well.

mostly to hear Nubreed live.  also to see what happens to 1015 when a crew 
of down ass folks take the entire place over.  and also because there will 
be breaks in every room.

ta-dow!

	A couple friends of mine recently told me about a new movie they saw  
called "The Laughing Club of India." It's about a phenomenon that's  
apparently been growing since 1995 -- people getting together in groups  
for the purpose of laughing. Not by watching comedy or playing silly  
drinking games or anything of that sort, but simply by taking up  
laughing itself as an activity, the way other people might do yoga or  
martial arts. Hey don't laugh, this is serious!  8)-  Intrigued, I went  
online to read a bit more about it, and found a few nice articles...
	
	Wouldn't it be cool to have this happen at a rave? Can you imagine  
people trying to laugh to the beat?   8)   I think it would be great to  
have that woman who's going around the world trying to hug everyone  
(see http://www.asianweek.com/2001_07_20/news2_amma_huggingtour.html )  
attend a rave too.

Groove on,

Laughter as its own punch line
by Holly J. Morris; Bellamy Pailthorp | Sep 03 '01
http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/USNewsWorldReport/2001/09/03/ 
220002?extID=10032&oliID=213

Peals of laughter cut through the persistent early-morning drizzle at  
Seattle's Green Lake Park. As passers-by gape--and then grin--four men  
and women titter, giggle, chortle, and guffaw, in what looks like a  
yoga class gone goofy. Led by energetic Stephanie Roche, they alternate  
rhythmic chanting and clapping with penguinlike waddling and pretend  
sneezing--all while howling with laughter. There's no punch line;  
there's not even a joke. This is a laughing club, one of at least 20  
begun in the United States this year. They are held in parks, churches,  
and often in nursing homes, where the gentle cheer is especially  
welcome.

Laughing clubs are an export from India, where they're familiar sights  
in hundreds of neighborhoods....




Some Indians think life is a laughing matter
Laughing is contagious

NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Indians have formed dozens of  laughing clubs  
-- yes, laughing clubs -- where they learn not  only the donkey laugh,  
the monkey laugh and the Santa Claus  laugh, but also to relax and get  
themselves in shape. Or so  they say. CNN's New Delhi Bureau Chief  
Anita Pratap reports.




Tired of Life? Try Laughing it off

"Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand." -- Mark Twain

Most members of the Laughing Club in Chicago's Wheaton Park District  
recreational center don't have much to laugh about.  Not in the best of  
health, many of them have a physical disability and spend hours just  
chasing doctors.

There's Lisa Guidizi, 27, who has cerebral palsy and gets around in a  
wheelchair.

Then there's Eileen Sheezer, 78, who's had five major surgeries in the  
past three years. There's also former Harlem Globetrotter Harold  
Howell, 65, who after years on the basketball court has had a stroke  
and is learning to walk again.

But despite all these calamities, a group of 15 laughers here, ranging  
in age from 18 to 80, get together three times a week for fifteen  
minutes to laugh in the face of adversity.

By all accounts, their sessions leave them feeling positive and  
uplifted...

	Maybe he just wasn't ready to die without a final laughing exercise... 
   8)

"Followers of a Hindu saint rioted in eastern India after he failed to 
die at the anointed time. More than 15,000 people turned up at the 
Sriguru Ashram at Kharagaon in Orissa to see the priest 'ascend to 
heaven' between 6am and noon. He had declared a few days ago that he 
would attain 'ichha mrityu' or death by his own will .... When the 
meditation and prayer session continued beyond the scheduled time and 
the guru was discovered still alive the onlookers began to hurl abuse 
at him and later turned violent.Police officers had to resort to a 
baton charge to disperse the angry followers and bring the situation 
under control."...

Condoms Improperly Used In India

Despite a population explosion and a growing AIDS problem, free condoms 
are being used in unusual ways, writes Rahul Bedi in New Delhi.

Millions of the condoms distributed free in India to combat AIDS and a 
soaring population are being used for other purposes such as 
waterproofing roofs, reinforcing roads and even polishing saris, say 
health workers.

In fact, only a quarter of the 1.5 billion condoms manufactured each 
year in India were being "properly utilised", said a report by doctors 
at King George's Medical University in Lucknow.

According to two university reports, rural villagers have used them as 
disposable water containers to wash, after relieving themselves in the 
fields. India's military have covered gun and tank barrels with condoms 
as protection against dust.

Of the 891 million condoms meant to be handed out free, a considerable 
proportion were acquired by road-building contractors who mixed them 
with concrete and tar and used the mixture to construct roads, 
rendering road surfaces smooth and resistant to cracks...

Never in a million years did  I think I'd be uttering these words,
and it's still hard to believe as I type this, but The Top is
closing it's doors forever this Sunday. Every Wednesday for
the last 7+ years, The Top could always be relied upon for
friendly faces, stiff drinks, and great house music, and the
impact it's had on the local scene and many of our lives has
been immeasurable.  But, as they say, all good things must
come to an end, and sadly, this is the end of the line for our
beloved SF watering-hole.
 
Please join us tonight to celebrate all the good times we've had
together and to commemorate the end of an era.  The Dirty Bird
crew will be dropping their swansongs, tissues will be on hand,
and there will be plenty of beer to cry in if you need to.  
 
As a final thank you for the years of support, everyone's in FREE.
 
 
Thanks for the memories,
 
       Greg, Sammy, Justin, & the Dirty Birds

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [bsp]  Last Wednesday night EVER at The TOP!   <FREE farewell party>

I spent my last Tuesday at the top tonight for Solution/Phuturo.  What a
great night.  Unfortunately, it is the last week of parties at the place
known as the Top.  From what I've been told, the Top itself has been a
staple of the lower haight for the past 15 years.  What can take its
place is up for discussion as what it is now cannot be replaced in my
mind.

Subject: [sfraves] Roll call!  and reminiscence  - RE: [sfraves] [bsp]  Last Wednesday night EVER at The TOP!   <FREE farewell party>

My heart is pretty damned heavy about this too, being that The Top was
my first favorite club and still one of my favorite places to be.  All
anybody has to do to equal it is:

Find a smallish space, and reserve an area for a dance floor.

Outfit the interior edgily, and get Owen to throw up some pieces.  

Make it comfortable but NOT posh in the least.  You want people to feel
free to get loose in there.

Find some great bar staff

Find any old sound system (it still rocked before they updated it)

Convince The Top's current (and past) clientele to come and make the
place lively every night ;)


To hear folks tell it, The Top really found its groove musically and
socially because, by proximity, it was the bar of choice for a lot of
lower-Haight folks at a time when the area was a haven for electronic
music folks.  Much the same way you'll often hear stuff like Kruder &
Dorfmeister at Hanabi Sushi because of who was always dropping by, The
Top was really molded into shape by the people who came, often nightly,
to let loose.

I was always a wanna-be lower Haightian in the dot-com days..  I loved
the people, the vibe, the restaurants, and, of course, The Top.  I used
to drive up from Santa Cruz back in the day, just to get some bomb
indian food and dance @ The Top.

I still remember back when I started going to Sumo there on Mondays,
just looking for another excuse to be in that environment, and found
the most spectacularly varied crowd.  A more diverse dancefloor, I've
never seen.  ..and the music was dope before they started verging more
and more into mainstream hip-hop.  

More often than almost anywhere in the city, a night spent at The Top
would result in a feverish rush home when the lights came on, and a
sleepless night spent making music, fresh with inspiration from what
I'd heard played that night.  The energy just COURSED out of that
place.  At least, for me.  When Justin and Sammy had Andrew and I play
one Wednesday night recently, I just about burst with happiness.

Damn, I'm going to miss it.  Who else is coming out tonight?  I'll be
there, bidding what seems like an era in my life a sweet adeiu.  

F*ck, I'm getting all misty.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] mackies??

Katastrophe: Hip Hop Against the Grain

By Mac Barreto, WireTap

Posted on November 23, 2004, Printed on November 24, 2004


If you haven't heard Katastrophe's name yet, you will. With an LP in
the works and a European tour under his belt, this 25-year-old FTM
(Female to Male) emo-hop (that's hip hop with emotion) artist is on
the verge of making it big. Or, that's the word on the streets.

Katastrophe, also knows as Rocco Kayiatos, sat down to talk to WireTap
after a recent performance at Genderblast, an event sponsored by San
Francisco's Youth Gender Project. Here, the artist discusses his
music, his role in the queer community and the future of transgender
youth in the public sphere.

"The government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands 
of the bosses and their employers, the special interests.  An invisible 
empire has been set up above the forms of democracy."
-Woodrow Wilson

"There are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, 
i.e. the voice of conscience even though such obedience may cost many a 
bitter tear, and even more, separation from friends, from family, from the 
state to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life 
itself. For this obedience is the law of our being."
   Gandhi

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

i have ~800 mixtapes. someday i want to encode them all and host them
online. i'm sure someone's already doing this (url's?)

i think this thing will come in handy for it:

much fun!!!  Startin out the night was Val Sparks!!  WOW!  I LOVED HER SET
SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH... seriously.. I was really Curious 2 C this Girlie get
her Jungle Groovy on behind the decks & Wow.. it was all Hard & Techy!!! 
I LOVED IT!!!  YAY.. Good Job al!!  I swear man.. i dance her whole set!! 
I culdn't help it!

The Sleeeveless crew went on next.. OK.. from what I got.. Dominatrix was
like mainly all strait up hard ass DNB & Tess was like all ummmmmm... OK.
I wanna say Dubby hard.. LoL.. I dunno.. but U could like totally tell who
was who when they did their tag set!!  Ofcour4se.. having Audio Angel on
the MIC was Heavenly!!!  YAY!!!

What was really Dope is that Ziggy was there!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!! 
ZIGGY~!!!!!!  So Dope!!  Strait away, she got on the decks & made it nice
& hard like she is known 2 do!!  NIIIIIIIIIIIIICE!!!

Then I went on a lil' trip 2 the City w/ the Femme's & Vance!!  So Dope!! 
We made it in time 4 the last hour & 1/2 of Phuturo @ the Top.. WOW... how
like ya khow... really Emotional man.. I mean.. seriously.. if u remember
a time when i would poat like every week almost 4 liker 2-3 years strait
how I wnet there alot & Wow.. it's over..I mean... the top anyway..
totally long live Phuturo man!!  But I dunno.. it was a sad moment, but
hey... all I could was dance, ya know!!

It was Dope!  All the residents were up there spinning... JuJu, Genome,
4Real were all taggin'... Raise was up there  7 Mal was 2... Duh was on
the Mic tellin' up all what's up.. doin' some ragga, everything.. Loved
it!!!

OK.. Corny moment.. but like I was dancing mainly llike on the stairs
'cause it was right in from of the DJ booth & there was no space on the
dance floor.. I guess like Genome saw me & stuck his hand out then like I
grabed it & I dunno... it was like hella touching 'cause well.. the whole
time I was there was just emotional man.. seriously... there was like this
mondo sense of disbelief yet every1 partied Heeeeeeeeeella hard 'cause
it's the last fuckin' Jungle night @ The Top!

It was funny.. UFO climbed on the table where the decls were then stage
dove!!  That was Awesome & well.. I was kinda scared 'cause i didn't know
who it was @ 1st...

Finally when the festivites like kinda mellowed down & people were like
laughing w/ tears in their eye (literally) me & Tess (1 of The Femme's)
went back 2 her pad 'cause she let me crash the night!

Anywaze.. Have a Groovy Thanksgiving!  Will see U all Groovin' hopefully

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  WHITE HOUSE THANKSGIVING TURKEY DETAINED WITHOUT COUNSEL

--=====================_19015472==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit


WASHINGTON, DC­Cousin Wattle, the official National Thanksgiving Turkey who 
was to have been pardoned by President Bush in an annual White House 
ceremony that dates back to the Truman administration, is currently being 
held without formal charges or access to legal counsel, White House press 
secretary Scott McClellan confirmed Tuesday.

McClellan said that Wattle, a 41-pound White Holland tom, is in custody 
after having been judged a "potential security risk" to the president Monday.

"Cousin Wattle's conduct prior to the pardoning ceremony prompted Justice 
Department officials to authorize the bird's detention as an enemy 
combatant," McClellan said. "He exhibited hostile, potentially seditious 
behavior that could endanger the safety of the president or other 
government officials."

Officials report that Wattle became agitated shortly after he was led into 
the White House Rose Garden, where he broke loose from his handlers and 
began strutting about the grounds. Witnesses allege that Wattle, without 
warning or provocation, began to flap his flightless wings wildly and rush 
nearby White House staffers, ignoring orders to halt. Wattle also allegedly 
pecked Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Greg Mankiw on the left hand.

The president, who was being debriefed on the ceremony by aides in the East 
Room when the incident began, was whisked by Secret Service agents to the 
safety of an underground bunker a half-mile below the White House.

After several minutes of chasing by various security officers, handlers, 
and gleeful schoolchildren, Wattle was subdued. The shackled and hooded 
bird was then escorted to an unmarked Secret Service vehicle and driven 
from the White House.

Fanny Clune, a spokeswoman from the farm where Wattle was bred, could not 
account for the turkey's violent outburst. She explained that the National 
Turkey Federation is careful to screen national Thanksgiving turkey 
candidates, adding that the 1-year-old gobbler was hand-fed from birth, and 
had never expressed any violent sentiments against the American government.

"I have no idea why Cousin Wattle snapped like that," Clune said. "He's 
accustomed to human contact. We know of no loyalty Wattle may have to any 
turkey nationalist movement. His closest contacts are a 9-year-old member 
of the farm family that raised him and a duck named Flap."

McClellan said Cousin Wattle continues to resist confinement and refuses to 
cooperate with his interrogators.

"We are doing everything we can to ensure that Cousin Wattle is given fair 
treatment," McClellan said. "Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to find 
appropriate translators."

So far, animal-rights attorneys have been denied access to the offshore 
prison farm where Wattle is being held until a formal arraignment can be 
arranged.

"This is an outrage," lawyer Jeffrey Alexander said. "Cousin Wattle has not 
been allowed to see relatives or lawyers, nor has he been formally charged 
with a crime. The pervasive anti-turkey sentiment in this country is the 
only reason this shocking deprivation of basic freedoms is allowed to 
continue. If a Labrador retriever were being treated this way, the outcry 
would be deafening."

Representatives from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals visited Cousin Wattle early Tuesday and roundly criticized the 
conditions of the turkey's confinement.

"Cousin Wattle is being detained alone in a cold, dirt-floor pen with 
nothing to eat but raw corn," ASPCA officer Peter Woljak said. "He was 
leaning against the chain-link wall of the pen, literally sitting in his 
own feces. He appeared despondent, and his face and neck bore evidence that 
he had been bound and gagged."

McClellan dismissed ASPCA complaints, saying that Wattle had been gagged 
and blindfolded only because he had resisted confinement, and that the 
state of his pen was fully compliant with standards set by the National 4-H 
Convention of 1982.

"The real horror Wattle faces isn't inadequate prison conditions anyway," 
Woljak said. "It's the threat of infinite confinement, without trial or 
access to legal representation. The government has all but said it intends 
to hold the turkey until he talks."

Public reaction to the bird's detention has been mixed.

"There's no proof that Cousin Wattle intended to attack the president," an 
Ohio-based caller to The Randi Rhodes Show said. "He's a free-range 
domestic bird, not some wild turkey. Something like this makes you stop and 
wonder what other appalling things are going on. There sure doesn't seem to 
be a whole lot of pigeon activity on the White House lawn, if you follow me."

A caller on The Michael Savage Show was less forgiving.

"I remember a time when the National Thanksgiving Turkey would never even 
think of disrespecting the commander-in-chief," a man identifying himself 
as "Larry from North Carolina" said. "Those mealy-mouthed liberals who 
complain about Cousin Wattle's treatment should be happy he wasn't shot on 
sight. They claim he's all by himself feeling lonely in that pen of his. 
Well, I know my family would be happy to keep Cousin Wattle company this 
Thanksgiving. We'd serve him on a silver platter!"

Refusing to offer an opinion on the confined turkey's innocence or guilt, 
National Turkey Federation spokesperson Gina Webster made a plea for 
Americans to "find common ground during the holiday."

"While we may disagree about the handling of Cousin Wattle's case, most of 
us can at least agree on one thing," Webster said. "Turkey is incredibly 
delicious!"

While Wattle remains in custody awaiting a presidential pardon that may 
never come, the bird's ceremonial duties will be undertaken by his 
designated alternate, Miss Prissy, a turkey hen whose political beliefs are 
unknown at this time.

well, from a legal standpoint,  it's not like there isn't cause.

now, THAT'S a money shot.

If we want to get into the whole restoration of 'honor & dignity' in
the White House, love him or hate him, at least President Bill Clinton
had Monica Lewinsky for something like that.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Happy Tday!

	Yes, happy Thanksgiving! Don't forget to be legitimately thankful
amidst the cynicism. And don't forget "Buy Nothing Day"... Here's my
message about that:

	Regarding Buy Nothing Day -- Thank the gods there's at least a
semblance of a free market in this country, so we have the choice to
buy or not to buy. The coolest thing about Buy Nothing Day is that it's
voluntary -- if it were a government program, they'd force you to buy
nothing on that day, even if you actually *wanted* to go shopping! They
used to have a mandatory Buy Nothing Day every Sunday in Britain -- all
the stores were required by law to close on Sunday. Talk about mixing
church and state. Fortunately they're moving away from that, and more
stores are allowed to stay open now.

	But in most countries we have the opposite problem -- governments
continually force us to buy things whether we want them or not. They do
this in a thousand different ways, from taking money out of our
paychecks to giving us parking tickets (a form of taxation when the
purpose is to raise revenue). They even take our money by printing more
of it (inflation is a form of taxation too -- each dollar printed makes
the dollars in your pocket worth less). Then they engage in massive
spending orgies that we paid for,  blowing ridiculous amounts on
products that aren't needed, services that aren't performed properly,
and programs that don't work. Many politicians and bureaucrats get
six-figure salaries from our money which they're free to spend on all
kinds of silly consumer products that you never would have willingly
bought.

	The higher the taxation and the more government (aka "public") control
of resources, the less choice we have. Buy Nothing Day is a great
opportunity to remind people that government is forcing us to buy every
day. I appreciate your group organizing it and providing this chance to
educate people.

	And speaking of education, here's a little background on the history of
Thanksgiving that I wanted to turn you on to, if you haven't seen it
before.

Yours in liberty,
				<<< Starchild >>>

[P.S. - For a contrary view on what to do Nov. 26, check out the  
promotion
of "Buy Something Day": http://www.bureaucrash.com]


Did you know that the first Thanksgiving was a celebration of the
triumph of private property and individual initiative?

William Bradford was the governor of the original Pilgrim colony,
founded at Plymouth in 1621. The colony was first organized on a
communal basis, as their financiers required. Land was owned in
common. The Pilgrims farmed communally, too, following the "from each
according to his abilities, to each according to his needs" precept.

The results were disastrous. Communism didn't work any better 400
years ago than it does today. By 1623, the colony had suffered
serious losses. Starvation was imminent.

Bradford realized that the communal system encouraged and rewarded
waste and laziness and inefficiency, and destroyed individual
initiative. Desperate, he abolished it. He distributed private plots
of land among the surviving Pilgrims, encouraging them to plant early
and farm as individuals, not collectively.

The results: a bountiful early harvest that saved the colonies. After
the harvest, the Pilgrims celebrated with a day of Thanksgiving -- on
August 9th.

Unfortunately, William Bradford's diaries -- in which he recorded the
failure of the collectivist system and the triumph of private
enterprise -- were lost for many years. When Thanksgiving was later
made a national holiday, the present November date was chosen. And
the lesson the Pilgrims so painfully learned was, alas, not made a
part of the holiday.

Happily, Bradford's diaries were later rediscovered. They're
available today in paperback. They tell the real story of
Thanksgiving -- how private property and individual initiative [not the
Indians, as in popular myth] saved the Pilgrims.

This Thanksgiving season, one of the many things I'm thankful for is
our free market system (imperfectly realized as it is). And I'm also
grateful that there are increasing numbers of Americans who are
learning the importance of free markets, and who are working to
replace government coercion with marketplace cooperation here in
America and around the world.

Paul Schmidt

PS: A special thanks to long-time Advocate volunteer Cris Everett,
who told us about this neglected bit of history several years ago,
and who celebrates Thanksgiving on -- you guessed it -- August 9th.

No way!  Wow, small world.... Ever wonder how your  
great-great-great-etc. grandfather would react if he could see your  
life? I sometimes try to imagine what would happen if someone like  
Thomas Jefferson were able to time-travel to the present, and people  
knew he was Jefferson. Would he lead a libertarian revolution? Would he  
think the whole world had gone to hell? Would he just be unable to  
adapt, and go to the country and take up gardening? Would he radically  
revise our view of history? Would he try LSD? etc...  8)

Subject: [sfraves] Laughing Clubs in India- Thumbs UP

Hey - I attended one of the laughing clubs in Mumbai, India for a month or 
so and it was great, so much so I wanted to start one here. I attended 
because its a good way to be a part of something, other than sitting in a 
car or cubicle at work or civilization isolated from everybody and 
everything. Looking at people in their eyes, laughing with them, touching 
them, doing yoga and feeling fresh actually used to help me get out of bed 
at 6:30am and jog down to the local park to go laugh. I HATE getting up 
early, so obviously there must have been something to it. Basically it 
brings people together, people that you would otherwise just glaze over with 
your eyes, or turn your eyes down to avoid looking at them for fear of being 
too "interested" or prying or nosey, suddenly, these people become real, 
just like you, and they dont mind showing their humanity. The laughing class 
always ends in a good saying or good prayer, explained by the teacher in a 
simple way, good thoughts that go a long way to making this world a better 
place to live in.

The best laugh was the politicians laugh - ask me if you meet me and I will 
show you what its like. There is a laughing club in the bay area as well - I 
think in Sunnyvale, probably cos there are lots of Indians down there! If 
people are interested in starting a laughing club in the Peninsula get in 
touch.

Vidur, fellow breakster, psy-transter.

My Linksys wrt54g router has the 3rd party firmware. Turned the radio up to 
84mW and now I've got lots of range. For the $70 those routers cost that's

Medical marijuana before Supreme Court
Federal power to control drug use vs. states' health
care laws

- Bob Egelko, Chronicle Staff Writer
Sunday, November 28, 2004


Two Northern California women who say medical
marijuana is their only shield from a life of agony
take their case to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday in
a clash between federal power to regulate drug use and
a state's authority to determine medical care for its
residents.

It is a case of unusual alliances, with some prominent
conservative organizations siding with the patients on
the issue of states' rights and limited federal
powers. A ruling is due by the end of June.

This will be the court's first look at medical
marijuana since 2001, when the justices upheld the
federal shutdown of an Oakland pot dispensary and
found no exemption in federal drug laws for claims of
medical necessity. The case appears to represent
advocates' last hope of winning legal protection from
the federal crackdown that began in 1996, when
Californians approved the nation's first law allowing
patients to use marijuana with a doctor's approval.

Similar laws have been passed since then in nine other
states: Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada,
Colorado, Maine, Vermont and Montana. But federal law
since 1970 has classified marijuana as a dangerous
drug with no legitimate use and has prohibited
possession, cultivation and distribution.

The Bush administration has enforced the law
aggressively in California, with a series of raids and
criminal prosecutions. The question before the court
is whether individual patients -- and, possibly, some
of their suppliers -- are immune from federal
enforcement.

The argument goes like this: The Constitution
authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce.
But no interstate commerce is involved when patients,
acting legally under state law, use marijuana that was
grown within the state and supplied without charge.

The counterargument, by the government and its allies,
is that all illicit drug use affects interstate
commerce. Even freely supplied marijuana boosts the
demand for the drug, reduces the overall supply and
may affect the price, the government says; in
addition, pot looks the same whether it's grown
locally or shipped between states.

The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco ruled in favor of the patients last
December, saying their use of marijuana was
noncommercial and was beyond the power of Congress to
prohibit. The court also told federal judges to decide
whether the ruling -- if it survives Supreme Court
review - - would protect a marijuana cooperative in
Oakland, which was closed by a government lawsuit, and
another in Santa Cruz, which was raided by federal
agents.

One of the plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme
Court, Angel Raich of Oakland, obtains marijuana from
two anonymous suppliers and uses it every two hours to
ward off pain and loss of appetite from a brain tumor,
seizure disorder and other debilitating conditions.
Co-plaintiff Diane Monson of Oroville (Butte County)
takes marijuana to combat back pain and muscle spasms
and grew her own plants until federal agents seized
them in 2002. Both have doctors' recommendations and
say they tried all available legal medicines without
success.

Their hopes depend on swaying one or more of the
court's conservative justices, who, under the banner
of federalism, have issued a series of rulings since
1995 limiting the federal government's power over the
states. Two rulings have overturned federal laws --
one that banned gun possession near schools, another
that allowed victims of rape and domestic violence to
sue in federal court -- on the grounds that they did
not affect interstate commerce.

To that end, lawyers for Raich and Monson have
enlisted major conservative and libertarian groups to
woo the justices on states' rights.

In one court filing, the Cato Institute argued that
the power-sharing agreement made by the original 13
states in ratifying the Constitution "is dishonored
when citizens in great physical pain are deprived of
available medical treatment by a remote sovereign on
the far side of the continent.''

"Federalism ... allows for experimentation at the
state level,'' declared the Institute for Justice,
another conservative-leaning libertarian organization,
whose brief called for a return to limits imposed by
courts in the 1930s on federal authority to regulate
in-state activities.

On the other side, the government's supporters include
one group, Community Rights Counsel, usually
associated with liberal causes such as environmental
protection. Its brief urged the court to preserve
federal "legislative flexibility to address national
concerns'' such as drug trafficking.

Another hurdle for Raich and Monson is the fact that
they are asking the court to grant a partial exemption
to the government-declared war on drugs for states
with medical marijuana laws. This would be in open
defiance of Congress, which has repeatedly declared
that marijuana has no medical value.

"The 'medical marijuana' concept is a Trojan horse
tactic toward the goal of legalization,'' said the
Drug Free America Foundation and other anti-drug
organizations in a filing in support of the federal
government's position. They said initiatives like
California's Proposition 215 promote "medicine by
popular vote.''

A brief by seven Republican members of Congress said
exempting medical patients from federal marijuana laws
would make their states "a haven for drug
traffickers'' and return the nation to "the
19th-century age of quack medicine. '' The Justice
Department, in its written arguments, warned that any
exemption for in-state possession and distribution
would create a new class of drug manufacturers and
pharmacies immune from federal regulation.

Medical marijuana advocates and their allies responded
indignantly.

"Just because Congress says it does not make it so,''
said the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, referring to congressional findings on
the dangerousness and uselessness of marijuana. "The
chronically ill in California are the casualties in
this war.''

The patients also draw support from some medical
organizations, including the California Medical
Association, which signed a brief arguing that
seriously ill people should make their own medical
decisions, in consultation with health professionals.

In this case, the brief said, "the alternative to
which the government would relegate them is ... a life
of unremitting, unrelieved physical pain.''

The case is Ashcroft vs. Raich, 03-1454.

and grew her own plants until federal agents seized

them in 2002. Both have doctors' recommendations and

say they tried all available legal medicines without

success.


Their hopes depend on swaying one or more of the

court's conservative justices, who, under the banner

of federalism, have issued a series of rulings since

1995 limiting the federal government's power over the

states. Two rulings have overturned federal laws --

one that banned gun possession near schools, another

that allowed victims of rape and domestic violence to

sue in federal court -- on the grounds that they did

not affect interstate commerce.


To that end, lawyers for Raich and Monson have

enlisted major conservative and libertarian groups to

woo the justices on states' rights.


In one court filing, the Cato Institute argued that

the power-sharing agreement made by the original 13

states in ratifying the Constitution "is dishonored

when citizens in great physical pain are deprived of

available medical treatment by a remote sovereign on

the far side of the continent.''


"Federalism ... allows for experimentation at the

state level,'' declared the Institute for Justice,

another conservative-leaning libertarian organization,

whose brief called for a return to limits imposed by

courts in the 1930s on federal authority to regulate

in-state activities.


On the other side, the government's supporters include

one group, Community Rights Counsel, usually

associated with liberal causes such as environmental

protection. Its brief urged the court to preserve

federal "legislative flexibility to address national

concerns'' such as drug trafficking.


Another hurdle for Raich and Monson is the fact that

they are asking the court to grant a partial exemption

to the government-declared war on drugs for states

with medical marijuana laws. This would be in open

defiance of Congress, which has repeatedly declared

that marijuana has no medical value.


"The 'medical marijuana' concept is a Trojan horse

tactic toward the goal of legalization,'' said the

Drug Free America Foundation and other anti-drug

organizations in a filing in support of the federal

government's position. They said initiatives like

California's Proposition 215 promote "medicine by

popular vote.''


A brief by seven Republican members of Congress said

exempting medical patients from federal marijuana laws

would make their states "a haven for drug

traffickers'' and return the nation to "the

19th-century age of quack medicine. '' The Justice

Department, in its written arguments, warned that any

exemption for in-state possession and distribution

would create a new class of drug manufacturers and

pharmacies immune from federal regulation.


Medical marijuana advocates and their allies responded

indignantly.


"Just because Congress says it does not make it so,''

said the National Organization for the Reform of

Marijuana Laws, referring to congressional findings on

the dangerousness and uselessness of marijuana. "The

chronically ill in California are the casualties in

this war.''


The patients also draw support from some medical

organizations, including the California Medical

Association, which signed a brief arguing that

seriously ill people should make their own medical

decisions, in consultation with health professionals.


In this case, the brief said, "the alternative to

which the government would relegate them is ... a life

of unremitting, unrelieved physical pain.''


The case is Ashcroft vs. Raich, 03-1454.

November 29. 2004 8:00AM


WASHINGTON - The U.S. Supreme Court can ignore the usual 
liberal-vs.-conservative divide in the next two weeks when it takes up 
cases on medical marijuana and the direct shipping of wine to 
consumers. Instead, the justices will be forced to decide between 
competing versions of conservatism.

The social conservatives seek more government enforcement in areas 
including abortion, pornography, drugs, immigration and gay rights. The 
small-government, free-market conservatives seek fewer restrictions on 
private behavior.

It's a clash likely to echo in the years ahead because Republican 
control of all three government branches could sideline Democrats and 
expose philosophical rifts within the GOP. The Supreme Court, where 
seven of nine justices are Republican appointees, faces especially 
stark choices.

In a case to be taken up this week, outgoing Attorney General John 
Ashcroft is challenging the California law that permits seriously ill 
people to obtain marijuana to relieve their pain if they have the 
recommendation of a doctor. Ashcroft argues for strong federal 
enforcement of drug laws and is joined by a group of drug warriors and 
half a dozen socially conservative Republicans in Congress who, in 
briefs to the court, argue for a zero-tolerance policy on marijuana.

But leading conservative academics, including veterans of the Reagan 
administration, have joined the case on the side of the California 
medical marijuana users. They argue for limits on federal power and 
protection for states' rights -including the right to enact the 
marijuana law.

The wine shipping case features a similar dispute between conservatives 
who champion free trade and those who support strict state controls on 
alcohol, including a national group of evangelical Christians.

In both cases, the justices "have to decide whether they want to be Mr. 
Law-and-Order or Mr. Federalism," says Robert Levy, a constitutional 
scholar at the libertarian CATO Institute.

In the past decade, the high court's conservative justices, led by 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, served notice that they wanted to 
restore the limits on federal power. They did so by focusing on the 
Constitution's provision that says Congress "may regulate commerce 
among the several states."

In 1995, Rehnquist spoke for a 5-4 majority that struck down the 
federal Gun Free School Zones Act on the grounds that the mere 
possession of a gun did not involve interstate commerce. Five years 
later, the same 5-4 majority voided part of the Violence Against Women 
Act, which allowed victims of sexual assaults to sue their attackers in 
federal court. A sexual assault is a crime, but it is not interstate 
commerce, Rehnquist said.

Those rulings were applauded by conservatives who said they helped to 
restore the Constitution's limits on federal authority. The four 
liberal justices - John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
and Stephen Breyer - dissented in the gun control and sexual assaults 
cases, saying the court should uphold the broad reach of these federal 
laws.

Now, the medical marijuana case, Ashcroft vs. Raich, raises the same 
constitutional issue but with the ideological leanings reversed.

Conservatives who have been skeptical of gun control laws tend to 
support strict anti-drug laws. At the same time, many liberals see 
Ashcroft's campaign against the medical marijuana laws as a classic 
example of federal overreaching.

The wine dispute takes the court back to the end of national 
Prohibition in 1933. The 21st Amendment gave the states control over 
alcohol that crossed their borders, and they in turn used this 
authority to set up elaborate, and sometimes unique, regulations 
governing the sale of beer, wine and liquor.

Nearly all the states require that alcohol be sold through licensed 
wholesalers and retailers. But California and several other wine 
producing states permit the direct shipments of wine to consumers in 
states that allow it. Michigan and New York, along with more than half 
of the states, strictly forbid out-of-state vineyards to ship wine 
directly to consumers.

These bans were challenged by advocates of free trade, who say the 
system of licensed wholesalers amounts to government-mandated 
protectionism.

The National Association of Evangelicals and the group Concerned Women 
for America have joined in defense of the state laws, saying the strict 
controls are needed to prevent underage drinking.

Can you reccomend any good antennas? I was looking at the D-Link
DWL-G810 802.11g Wireless Bridge. I can put that on ther other side of
the building where I get access and it should boost the signal up
enough so I can hop on in the other part of the building right?

  v. Ashcroft Case Monday Morning

Special to Drug War Chronicle: Supreme Court Hears Raich v. Ashcroft Case 
Monday Morning

Medical marijuana supporters began lining up outside the US Supreme Court 
at 4:00am Monday morning, vying for a chance to be present as the justices 
heard oral arguments in a case that could force the federal government to 
leave medical marijuana patients alone in states where it is legal.

The case, Ashcroft v. Raich, pits two California medical marijuana patients 
against the Justice Department. It also pits the doctrine of states' rights 
against the federal government's use of the Constitution's interstate 
commerce clause to crack down on medical marijuana users despite state laws 
okaying their use.

Angel Raich, who suffers from a variety of life-threatening disorders, and 
Diane Monson, a chronic back pain sufferer, filed suit in federal court in 
California after the Drug Enforcement Administration raided Monson's home 
in 2001 and seized her marijuana plants, which she was growing for medical 
purposes in compliance with California law. The pair filed for injunctive 
relief seeking to permanently bar the federal government from raiding, 
arresting, seizing the property of, or otherwise harassing law-abiding 
medical marijuana patients. They argued that because their cultivation and 
use are non-commercial and take place within a single state, the federal 
government has no constitutional standing to stop them.

Raich and Monson lost in federal district court in October 2002, but that 
decision was overturned by the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco last December. That decision meant that medical marijuana 
patients in the states comprising the 9th Circuit could now use and 
cultivate the plant without fear of the feds.

The Justice Department of Attorney General John Ashcroft appealed the 9th 
Circuit's ruling. Written briefs in the potentially landmark case were 
submitted months ago, and today the Supreme Court heard an hour's worth of 
oral arguments from acting Solicitor General Paul Clement for the Bush 
administration and Boston attorney Randy Barnett for Raich and Monson.

A favorable decision from the high court would extend those protections 
nationwide. A decision to overturn the 9th Circuit would merely mean that 
the DEA could once again conduct raids against medical marijuana patients 
and providers, but would not overturn the state laws approving medical 
marijuana.

As the chill pre-dawn darkness turned to sunlight outside the Supreme 
Court, the line of hopeful spectators grew steadily longer. First in line 
was attorney Eric Sterling, head of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, 
followed by Jeff Jones, whose Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative lost its 
medical necessity case in the same court three years ago. Following them 
were a mixed bag of wildly-speculating activist law students, medical 
marijuana supporters, and Supreme Court groupies, all very grateful for the 
hot coffee provided by Steph Sherer and Stacey Swimme of the medical 
marijuana defense group Americans for Safe Access.

By 9:00am, when the doors to the court were opened, the crowd of hopefuls 
had grown to a couple of hundred -- with only 50 guaranteed access to the 
actual chamber. By then, more movement bigwigs had made appearances, as the 
leaders of the country's two largest marijuana reform groups, outgoing 
NORML head Keith Stroup and Marijuana Policy Project head Rob Kampia, 
showed up to hear the arguments.

Bush administration lawyer Paul Clement led off the session, asserting that 
marijuana had no accepted medical use, that someone growing pot 
non-commercially for his own use in his own state was subject to the 
jurisdiction provided by the Interstate Commerce Clause, that a restrictive 
reading of the Commerce Clause would impeded the federal government's 
ability to set national policy on any number of issues, and, furthermore, 
that a ruling allowing medical use unfettered by federal law would open the 
door to similar arguments regarding recreational use.

But in typical Supreme Court fashion, Clement barely got started before 
being peppered by rapid fire questions from the justices -- all except 
Justice Clarence Thomas, who rarely asks questions and who used the hearing 
today to alternately loll about in his chair or read from a book. Wouldn't 
the non-commercial use of homegrown pot reduce the illicit interstate 
commerce in the herb? asked a mischievous Justice Scalia. Maybe so, Clement 
reluctantly responded, but for him the important point was that "any island 
of non-regulation would frustrate the regime created by Congress."



After a half-hour of back and forth, it was time for Raich attorney Randy 
Barnett. The Interstate Commerce Clause does not apply to Raich and Monson, 
he argued, because "their medical marijuana use and cultivation is 
non-economic and wholly intrastate." But the justices, displaying evident 
concern about the ramifications of restricting the federal government's 
ability to use the Interstate Commerce Clause, shot question after question 
at Barnett about whether growing even pot that never hit the market or left 
the state was an economic activity and thus subject to regulation under the 
clause.

The argument over the Interstate Commerce Clause pits earlier Supreme Court 
decisions against each other. In a 1942 ruling, the court held that a 
farmer who grew wheat for consumption on his own property was subject to 
the clause because the wheat he grew affected the overall market. But in a 
pair of mid-1990s rulings by the current court, the court struck down 
federal laws regarding firearms near public schools and violence against 
women, suggesting that the clause should be interpreted more strictly.

With ramifications extending far beyond the issue of medical marijuana, the 
Raich case drew a high number of friend of the court briefs and illustrated 
the ideological flexibility of all concerned. Conservative Republican 
congressmen led by Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN) submitted a brief calling for 
increased federal power, while the southern states of Alabama, Louisiana, 
and Mississippi submitted one supporting Raich as upholding states' rights.

Justice Breyer suggested that seeking a solution in the courts was 
premature. "I would think they would go to the FDA," to get marijuana 
rescheduled, he suggested. But the FDA has been consistently unresponsive 
to repeated efforts to get the herb rescheduled, as Barnett tartly pointed 
out. "I would suggest you read the brief from Rick Doblin on FDA 
obstructionism," he said.

"What about other states without medical marijuana laws?" asked Justice 
Ginsberg. "Could Congress regulate medical marijuana there?"

"The federal government could not prosecute medical marijuana users 
anywhere," responded Barnett.

"What about growing heroin or cocaine?" asked Justice Breyer. "It all 
depends on the regulatory scheme," Barnett offered.

"What impact would a favorable ruling have on the marijuana market 
overall?" asked Justice Stevens.

"The only impact would be a slight price reduction," Barnett suggested.

While the justices demonstrated concern about the ramifications of a 
positive decision, Angel Raich herself clearly articulated the 
ramifications of a negative one. Appearing at a post-hearing press 
conference on the Supreme Court steps as a lonely handful of anti-medical 
marijuana activists held up signs warning that smoked medicine is not 
medicine and that tens of thousands of kids are in drug treatment for 
marijuana, Raich made clear what this case is all about. "If they decide I 
have the right to live, I will spend the rest of the life with my family," 
she said. "On the other hand, if they decide against me, they will be 
handing me a death sentence."

Supporters adjourned to a press conference at the ACLU's DC home the 
Stewart Mott House, and have now begun the wait.

I have this really nice 2U server case that I bought about a year ago.
I have never used it but I think it was slightly used before I bought
it. I don't think I will ever use it so I wanted to see if anyone
wanted to buy it. I know when I bought it they were selling them for
$175.00 brand new. So if you are interested make an offer. If you want
I can take a few pics with my digi later.

It's that time again...

We're up to our eyeballs in tasks and are hiring a part time help desk
person to pick up some of our workload. It's about 16 hours a week and
pays $20/hr. Applicants must be _extremely_ IT-competent and be able
to manage a metric tonne of difficult, time consuming tasks while
keeping a smile and a sense of humor.

Aside from the workload, we're a great bunch of people to work with.
The office is located in the heart of the Financial District and is
easily accessable by BART or MUNI.

You must be able to pass a background check. No drug test.

If interested, please forward your resume to me. Keep in mind that
this is a part-time position (great for students?) but has long term
potential.

Peace

Subject: [sfraves] Lycos search engine promoting screensaver that fights spam

There's a new program called 'Make Love, Not Spam'. It's a screensaver
you download (both Win & OSX versions available) that sends requests to
known spam sites from everyone running the screensaver, essentially
DDoS'ing the sites to add to the spammer's bandwidth charges.

Definitely the USB used more power. They are designed primarily to be used
with a desktop system. I think the USB draws around 5 amps while the card
probably uses a few milliamps.

Ditch the USB and get a PCIMCIA card that was designed for your laptop.


Good luck!

great, and 2 weeks later your ISP drops you for DDoS, not to mention
that these targeted alleged spammers can sue you. Isn't DDoS a fedeal
felony too?

Well, its homepage is overloaded so I can see the details, but I check
an article on The Register.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/26/lycos_europe_spam_blitz/

Apparently the screensaver will only attempt to do a large # of  HTTP
requests (rather than ICMP or NBT type packets frequently associated
with DDoS attacks), it only aims to disrupt the servers, rather than
bringing them to a halt.

This is very borderline illegal stuff. What if the law changes in your
juridiction? What if good servers get targeted? (This thing use source
data from SpamCop, which is infamous for being overly aggressive and
its blocklist frequently block legitimate emails. See
http://jhoward.fastmail.fm/spamcop.html )  What about the other good
people who buy hosting space from the same webserver?

Worse yet.... What if the program itself gets exploited by someone
else and turns into  spambots or DDoSbots for other people?

What I see of this little app is a piece of feel-good software that
makes you feel like doing something good, but in reality does little
to achieve its goals and may cause a lot of collateral damages along
the way. It's like those "this poor 10-yr cancer patient gets $0.02
for every forward" chain mail.

What I think this is really about? Lycos trying to lurk you to install
their screensaver, so they can ***display their ads*** on your screen
when your computer is not active.

- Jeff



There are real solutions like Yahoo's DomainKeys, or we can all begin
to adopt digital signatures like PGP and S/MIME. The internet email
protocols are very insecure and outdated, that's why it gets
exploited. Spam is only one of its many problems.

I think the aim is simply to eat up bandwidth.  I believe it has some
built in throttling to avoid bringing the server to it's knees.

What about a low-tech way to do even more damage from your pc than if
you were using the program: go to the "victim's" website, prop a little
something with weight on the F5 key and head out to grab a bite to
eat.... :)

Well, I don't believe I've seend ads (yet.)  And if the targeting aspect
is less severe than you make it out to be, I have no problem with it.
