If you can handle the jump up / wobble / ringtone step type shit, you should
hit up Kompression.

Also, beware the button downs.

For (sometimes) proper music but a (really small) crowd of bayraves types,
you should hit up El Rincon.

That's about all I'm aware of, but I'm sure there's more going on as I don't
pay attention to much but dnb.

Holy fucking shit, I'm so glad I live here.

God bless Mary Jane.

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup


featuring from Poland:

3 CHANNELS  :  LIVE set + DJ sets

( Crostown Rebels . Trapez . Trenton . Resopal . Dirtybird )

Deeop and Ketiov started off as DJs intent on exposing Poland to the new
sounds of techno and house, which quickly led them to hosting club events
and a weekly radio show. In the last few years they've blown up as
producers, dropping sought-after releases and remixes on hot labels like
Crosstown Rebels, Trapez, Trenton, and SF's own Dirtybird.  Now they're
taking their in-demand talent to the final frontier, touring North America
and perfoming together LIVE for the first time.


and a world premiere performance by [KONTROL]'s own:

ALLAND BYALLO  :  LIVE!!!

( Leibe*Detail . Floppy Funk )

Between his roles as graphic designer, webmaster, radio host, DJ, and
producer/remixer, Alland Byallo is a man on a techno mission. This month,
riding high on a slew of ace productions, he too takes it up a notch with
the world premiere of his all original LIVE performance.


plus special guest:

NIKITA  ( The Endup . djnikita.com )

Nikita regularly rocks The Endup alongside Nikola Baytala Sunday mornings
after Kontrol is "technically" over.  Those who stay after the bar re-opens
though know the party keeps rocking until noon, making for monthly 14-hour
techno marathons. Tonight we're pleased to give you "night people" a taste
of what you've been missing.


and [KONTROL] residents:

NIKOLA BAYTALA   ( Robsoul . Junior Boys Own . S.W.A.T. )
CRAIG KUNA   ( Concept SF . ESDJCO )
ALLAND BYALLO   ( Leibe*Detail . Floppy Funk )
SAMMY D  ( Classic . Buzzin' Fly . Dirtybird )

3 CHANNELS

3 Channels are Deeop (Grzegorz Demianczuk) and Ketiov (Wojciech Taranczuk).
Their acquaintance began in 2003 when Ketiov started to spin his first
records in clubs like Sonar and Taras Caffe and Deeop was already widely
known for his enormous record collection and participation in every party i=
n
the city of Stettin.  In late 2003 they organized their first mutual party
at Mezzoforte club, which was a huge success. Logically they became residen=
t
DJ's there, which gave them a chance to organize their own parties simply
named "Electronic House". The idea was to promote new dance music completel=
y
different from what was played in most of the Polish clubs at the time. The
"Electronic House" parties had the privilege to welcome such people as Tom
Clark, Dub Taylor, John Tejada, Antonelli Electr, Wighnomy Brothers, Todd
Bodine, Matthias Tanzmann and Duplex 100.

In September 2003 they broadcasted their first radio show called "Session"
at the local ABC Radio alongside with their old mate Vitek. After a year
"Session" evolved into the 3 Channels project. Later the radio show was
broadcast under the name of "Plastelina" and could be heard every Thursday
from 6pm to 7pm. "Plastelina" has no sound limits one simple goal, which is
to promote modern electronic music from downtempo to house, tech-house and
techno.

After half a year of co-operation with Votchik, 3 channels decided to start
producing.  They released their 2 first records on Trenton ("Split EP" and
"Superficial") followed by 1 EP each on Trapez and Crosstown Rebels, which
showed a more minimal side of their work.  All these releases showed that 3
Channels could be versatile artists and collected a lot of good reviews all
over the world in media sources like the BBC and Anja Schneider's popular
radio show "Dance Under The Blue Moon".  They are now starting to do remixe=
s
for people such as Jacek Sienkiewicz, Maetrik, Richard Bartz, Codec'n Flexo=
r
and are releasing new productions on labels like Trenton, Crosstown Rebels,
Trapez and Resopal.  3 Channels have recently started to play live and have
launched their own label called Channels. They have also begun producing
under an alias, "Catz n Dogz" with an upcoming release on SF's own Dirtybir=
d
Records.

________________________________________________


ALLAND BYALLO

A Los Angeles native now residing in San Francisco, Russian-blooded Alland
Byallo has broken into the electronic music scene with his own unique blend
of Minimal Tech funk. Alland's taste, coupled with his research and digging=
,
always instills an undeniable groove and tickles the chin-scratching
trainspotting senses.

Alland's involvement with music didn't just start from splurging and buying
some 1200's. Having been raised with music since the age of 5 playing piano=
,
and adding trumpet at age 11, it only seemed natural for Alland to follow u=
p
his skills and training by sharing his taste in quality music with people a=
s
a DJ, and pursuing production. Lately, Alland has been quite busy in the
studio working hard on his own unique take on electronic dance music,
blending the ethics of minimal techno with the moods and feel of house
music.

Alland has hosted the infamous netradio show Comfort Sessions for four
years, only recenlty switching to an On-Demand format with Proton Radio, th=
e
most respected netradio portal in Underground Electronic music. The show is
inspired by a couple of things: The admiration and respect for some of the
most talented names out there, and the love of enlightening and educating
others about music and the brilliant artists who make it all happen. Alland
has made it his mission to give back to the local and global scene that has
given so much to him; to make the world aware of the missions of those
around him that truly deserve recognition and respect.

Currently, A&R for his own digital label, Nightlight Music and his upcoming
label Kvadrat Produkt, takes up much of Alland's time. Nightlight Music
started as a digital label used as an outlet for Alland's personal music
projects. But since it's inception, the label has grown to accomodate some
of the world's most talented and passionate tech-house artists. Kvadrat
Produkt is a new label that Alland is creating to fill a certain void.
"Minimal Yet Musical" is the motto for this venture. As the name implies
(Kvadrat meaning "square" in many languages), the vehicle is minimalism, ye=
t
filled with mass that supports the structure.

After releasing a slew of successful and well-received tracks over the last
two years on respected European labels such as Leibe*Detail, Floppy Funk,
and Shva Musik, Alland has recently devoted his time to putting together a
live set that will surely be making its way across America and the rest of
the world soon.  [KONTROL] is extremely proud to present the world premiere
of Alland's live performance on his home court at SF's legendary Endup.

NIKITA

It wasn't too long ago that Nikita ventured out from Denver, Colorado to
California to pursue his dreams of working in the music industry.  Nikita's
music career began in San Francisco promoting the long-running 177 Club
Townsend a.k.a. Club Universe and attending SFSU where he studied Audio
Engineering and Music Business. In the past six years Nikita's perseverance
and pure love for quality dance music has placed him among the top DJs of
San Francisco's world-famous club scene.

In 2005 Nikita was chosen to host his own radio show on Northern
California's Energy 92.7 FM =96 The Massive Mix. Recognizing his popularity
with the local crowds and his cutting edge DJ style, executives at
California's only FM dance station knew what most clubbers have already com=
e
to realize: if you want a fresh, cutting edge dance party with the hippest
crowd, look no further than Nikita. It was Nikita's raw talent that landed
him a residency at San Francisco's legendary nightclub, The EndUp, as well
as his recently acquired bi-weekly residency at the internationally
acclaimed Supperclub.

Whether it's 2 or 8 hours, Nikita's sets at The EndUp take you on a ride
seamlessly blending deep melodic grooves, techno, breaks, and twisted
tribal-tech house, yet still keeping it soulful and deep, bending all genre=
s
and creating a unique dance floor experience that continues to draw a
diverse audience. Currently Nikita is working on his own music productions,
so be sure to look out for his releases hitting speakers sometime soon!

For the last several months Nikita has played the post-Kontrol opening
Sunday morning sets at the Endup alongside fellow Endup resident Nikola
Baytala, effectively stretching the event into a monthly 14 hour techno
marathon. No longer content with sharing his talent with only the morning
crowd, we are pleased to present this local hero to the [KONTROL] faithful
with a proper peak hour set.

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] Dinner Party Records 'cast tonight


I'm playing a podcastinterwebthingy as a guest on Dinner Party Records' 
Jay Walker and friends show.  Or something like that.

7-9pm tonight.

Please don't expect techno, cause I'm not playing any.  Actually, I 
wouldn't hold my breath on mixing either (although, get this... I sorta 
*can* mix).  Just a chance to burp warped tunes from my ipod and talk to 
one of my best friends and my band's former bassist - George Cochrane.

Here you can click to suffer many tortures:

Fuckin A. I'll be getting a garage for the fucker. Not foolproof, but
definitely safer than the street parking in my neighborhood.

I still want Tipper's cars, each one does over 150 db, and at some of the 
Fuel label events and renegades they've just parked em as stacks for their 
sound system.  But they're not really made to be driven while playing...

Well, having had my car stereo jacked, I think I'm gonna revel in cheap 
shit in my car, and keep the good stuff at home (your dollar goes a lot 
further on home systems and headphones than car audio).  It's not like 
cars have the best acoustics/background noise specs anyway.

It's starting to become a monthly ritual to come out to my car to see my
glove box compartment open-   and sometimes my trunk will be popped as
well.  I think I need to invest in a BB Gun.

Hello raver friends!

I have a room for rent in my wonderful loft space in Alameda.  Yes, it's in
Alameda, it's really not as distant and isolated at it sounds...  We live in
a little creative haven complete with colorful walls, large bass bins,
awesome neighbors/building-mates, a pinball arcade, and a lovely beach a
short walk away.  See here for more info:

Love Chelsea Faith

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] LoveFest techno fundraiser w/ 3 CHANNELS tonight @ 222!

Howdy folks!

First off, thanks to everyone that made it out to Kontrol on Saturday
night. Alland really appreciated all the support and positive feedback
on his debut live set, and oh man... were 3 Channels ever great!  A
very special thanks to our wonderful guests Gregory and Voitek from
Poland/Berlin for turnin' the place out into the wee hours.

Secondly, we've got some big news, just announced!  Since 3 Channels
will be here in SF for a couple more days, we invited them to come
down to play the new monthly Auralism party called "Lil Brthr" which
happens first Tuesdays at the 222 club. THEY SAID YES!  So, you get a
surprise chance to hear them one more time before they leave (or a
first time if you missed them Saturday.)  Saturday was their second
gig EVER in the US, by the way, and who knows when these guys might be
back!

So, yes it's true... Poland's 3 CHANNELS are DJing tonight at 222 Hyde
in SF, probably from around 12pm - 2am.

This event is also going to be a fundraiser for a Kontrol/Auralism
float at this year's LoveFest! So, if you want to hear some great
techno / minimal / tech-house at this year's festival, please come
down and support with a donation of a Lincoln or a Hamilton (or hell,
a Benjamin if you're so inclined!) :)

The full lineup is here:
http://a915.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/124/l_6f52c04b53fa2dbaf748a22a38cca372.jpg

This is going to be sweet, these guys seriously killed it Saturday
night! Don't miss this rare opportunity to see this amazing duo in
such an intimate location. Hope to see you tonight!

p.s. Oh wait, one more thing!  Our friend James Bass and his
Bassaholics Anonymous crew are throwing an underground party this
Saturday night featuring badass Detroit legend DJ BONE on 3 decks!
[KONTROL] resident Craig Kuna will be warming things up for him from
1-2am (playing a harder techno set this time), and yours truly will be
serving up libations behind the bar!  Come get saucy with us and jack
to some classic bangin' Detroit bizness.  Full info here:

First off, thanks to everyone that made it out to Kontrol on Saturday
night. Alland really appreciated all the support and positive feedback
on his debut live set, and oh man... were 3 Channels ever great!  A
very special thanks to our wonderful guests Gregory and Voitek from
Poland/Berlin for turnin' the place out into the wee hours.

Secondly, we've got some big news, just announced!  Since 3 Channels
will be here in SF for a couple more days, we invited them to come
down to play the new monthly Auralism party called "Lil Brthr" which
happens first Tuesdays at the 222 club. THEY SAID YES!  So, you get a
surprise chance to hear them one more time before they leave (or a
first time if you missed them Saturday.)  Saturday was their second
gig EVER in the US, by the way, and who knows when these guys might be
back!

Here's a little factoid I did not know and pulled it off the Wikipedia
page for George Mason, one of our founding fathers and who George
Mason University is named after.

Paris Hilton is a direct descendant of George Mason. Mason's tenth son
Thomas Mason was Paris Hilton's
great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather.

The article goes on to reference that George Mason is the one who
wrote the predecessor to the Bill of Rights in the Constitution, and
refused to sign the Constitution because it did not have those
provisions.

--

We came equals into this world, and equals shall we go out of it. All
men are by nature born equally free and independent. To protect the
weaker from the injuries and insults of the stronger were societies
first formed; ? Every society, all government, and every kind of civil
compact therefore, is or ought to be, calculated for the general good
and safety of the community. Every power, every authority vested in
particular men is, or ought to be, ultimately directed to this sole
end; and whenever any power or authority whatever extends further, or
is of longer duration than is in its nature necessary for these
purposes, it may be called government, but it is in fact oppression.

- George Mason

Indeed it will not-

And quoting single sentences out of context is the tool of... a tool.

Paul, writing in his independent political newsletter in 1992, reported  
about unspecified surveys of blacks."Opinion polls consistently show that  
only about 5 percent of blacks have sensible political opinions, i.e.  
support the free market, individual liberty and the end of welfare and  
affirmative action,"Paul wrote.Paul continued that politically sensible  
blacks are outnumbered "as decent people." Citing reports that 85 percent  
of all black men in the District of Columbia are arrested, Paul  
wrote:"Given the inefficiencies of what D.C. laughingly calls the  
`criminal justice system,' I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of  
the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal," Paul  
said.Paul also wrote that although "we are constantly told that it is evil  
to be afraid of black men, it is hardly irrational. Black men commit  
murders, rapes, robberies, muggings and burglaries all out of proportion  
to their numbers."

Wait- you mean he actually does what he says he'll do?
He sticks to his stated principles of not supporting more pork-laden

I dunno, Sport, seems to me like the almighty hallowed "context" you 
speak of more or less gets the same racist points Paul's making there 
across.

As does Paul's votes in Congress on Emmit Till and Rosa Parks.

Or am I missing something?

You don't trainwreck much on the decks when you  grace the world with 
your DJ'ing skills, do you?

It's not racist to say, "85% of black men in this city have been arrested,
and they probably missed a few" or "Black men commit the large majority of
all violent crimes despite blacks being a 13% minority in this country."

That's called stating facts, supported by police and court statistics.

It's also not racist to vote against the federal government spending money
in ways it's not authorized, unless you can find me a white person whose
Congressional Gold Medal Ron Paul voted for.  Seems he just doesn't think
the government has the authority to spend money in that way (which it
doesn't, not constitutionally at least).

No, I'd say it's pretty fucking racist to say those things. In fact, you are
a racist for defending them. What would not be racist to say is that people
of color are disproportionately targeted for arrest and harassment by pretty
much every police department in the country, almost as a matter of policy.

You shouldn't be trying to talk about how many black men commit crimes, you
should be asking yourself, and the country at large, why so many black men
feel compelled to commit those crimes.

The answer is not 'because they're criminals.' If you can't see past the
statistics into the truth of the situation you really have no business
trying to spread your bigotry and hatred of a people that did nothing to
you.

How come the best cocaine in town is the powder in Atherton, but when I 
pick up the paper all I ever see is people in East Palo Alto getting 
arrested for buying rock?

If it's not about opportunity, and denied opportunity, pretend you're a 
parent.

Where would you want your kid to go to school?

OJ Simpson's HS in the projects of Potrero Hill, or Barry Bonds's HS in 
San Mateo?

Not voting to give Rosa Parks a Congressional Medal is flat out retarded 
beyond measure.

Having her body  Lie In State at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington 
DC for her funeral probably wasn't "Constitutional" either but it was 
the right thing to do, as was voting for the Emmit Till Unsolved Crimes Act.

Anytime you want to come join the plur of the 21st Century, we'll be 
glad to have you, but please check your hate at the door.

Thanks!!!

Are you *seriously* trying to argue that a fact can be racist?
Here's another racist fact for you then- go have a look at the  
black-on-white and white-on-black rape statistics- and then get back to me  
about who's "disproportionately targeting" who...

I think the answer is a combination of instinct and the fact that we keep  
subsidizing the poor with welfare.

And I quote (for the ignorant/racist contingent):

"You shouldn't be trying to talk about how many black men commit
crimes,  you should be asking yourself, and the country at large, why so 
many
black  men feel compelled to commit those crimes.

The answer is not 'because they're criminals.' If you can't see past the
statistics into the truth of the situation you really have no business
trying to spread your bigotry and hatred of a people that did nothing to
you. "

Because there's something called "discretion"- and if Mr Crack Smoker did  
it in the privacy of his own home instead of while taking a shit on  
someone else's porch you wouldn't see him in the paper either.

Of course it's about opportunity- but uninvolved parents with  
victim-mentalities have children who become just like them-
This is how you end up with 3 fucking generations of people living in the  
same house in the same project-
No amount of "opportunity" you give people like this is going to change  
them- because they don't want to change.
This is why fuckers will be wearing $100 pants and brand new shoes, and be  
asking me for 50 cents.
And people like you who keep telling them they are victims and it's not  
their fault just reinforce the idea more.
The community needs to clean *itself* up- and I really hope it does before  
the checks stop flowing- otherwise you're going to see Superdome-II...

"The rules say we can't do this but we're going to anyway- because we want  
to and it's like the right thing to do" is *exactly* how Bush got us in to  
Iraq.

No thanks- I'll remain in the real world :)

First of all, statistics aren't facts. They're statistics. The statistics in
and of themselves aren't racist, but the way you're using them is incredibly
so.

You're obviously white, so let me ask you, why do you feel so threatened by
black people? What is it that all the supposedly raping, murdering black
people have done to you? Do you really think that the color of someone's
skin can determine whether or not they're going to be a
thief/rapist/murderer/whatthefuckever it is you're scared of this week?

Let's be honest about what you're trying to say here. Don't fucking bullshit
me. You think black people are criminals simply because they're black.
That's what you're trying to say, so own up to it. Now think about that.
Really fucking think about it. Is it rational? Does it make sense? At all?
Or are you just a scurred little white boy who's been trained by the media
to be afraid of his own (black) shadow?

Finally, you're a lot closer to the truth in your final line than you know.
I can fix it for you, here:

"I think the answer is the fact that we keep subsidizing the rich with
corporate welfare."

MUCH better.

Cosmo Kramer, please.

No, no, actually you're right.

Good thing we made that no account, free-loader, that immoral, unwed, 
mother, J. K. Rowling, get off the dole, and quit wasting hard-working 
tax-payer's money by hanging out in a coffee shop with her illegitimate 
baby and scribbling in that notebook of hers.

The world's so much better off now that she's got a job waiting tables.

If that crackhead had a house to live in I'm sure he'd be smoking his rock
there. Most likely he doesn't, so he smokes it on the street. Now, if the
government provided him with one, and maybe some meaningful assistance to
get his life together, maybe he wouldn't have to wander the streets trying
to get high all the time.

There is nothing wrong with people taking care of each other. ALL people
need to take care of ALL other people. You say 'the community has to clean
*itself* up,' so tell me, what are you doing to clean up the community? I
bet you like to think of yourself as separate from the crackheads and the
homeless, and well, basically anyone with skin tone darker than fluorescent
lights, but I've got a news flash for you: You're not. You are part of the
same race as those people. There's a part of you in them and vice versa. If
you really care so much about the 'community' what are you doing to help
clean it up?

After all, you said the community needs to clean itself up, and you are in
fact a part of the community. So what the fuck are you doing to help?

Hmm?

I'm not threatened by black people- I'm threatened by character-lacking  
thugs that will shoot you *after* they've robbed you just so theur friends  
know they're a REAL G.  Doesn't matter what color they are to me at all.

Of course not- dress, movement, body language and facial expression are  
much more telling of someone's intention.
The security procedures used by El Al (the Israeli airline) are about the  
best examples of effective profiling you can find today.

You couldn't be further from the truth- and don't put words in my mouth.
It's interesting you mention the media though... have you really thought  
about this?
The media works the exact opposite of how you seem to see it-
You get something like the Duke rape case- a horrific white on black  
gang-rape- and it's nationwide news.
Black on white gang-rape?  Happens all the time but barely makes the local  
paper.
Hmm what's this?
La Shawn Barber seems to agree with me here- and OMG SHE'S BLACK?!?!

That's a nice sentiment and all, but let's go back to what you, quoting Ron
Paul, said originally:

Paul, writing in his independent political newsletter in 1992, reported
about unspecified surveys of blacks."Opinion polls consistently show that
only about 5 percent of blacks have sensible political opinions, i.e.
support the free market, individual liberty and the end of welfare and
affirmative action,"Paul wrote.Paul continued that politically sensible
blacks are outnumbered "as decent people." Citing reports that 85 percent
of all black men in the District of Columbia are arrested, Paul
wrote:"Given the inefficiencies of what D.C. laughingly calls the
`criminal justice system,' I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of
the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal," Paul
said.Paul also wrote that although "we are constantly told that it is evil
to be afraid of black men, it is hardly irrational. Black men commit
murders, rapes, robberies, muggings and burglaries all out of proportion
to their numbers."

Maybe I'm blind, but I don't see a lot of shit about body language and the
kind of clothes someone's wearing in there. I do see a lot of mention of
something else, though. . .

Can't say I've heard of La Shawn Barber, but if she's disseminating the view
that black men gang raping white women is happening *all* the time she's
probably not too well informed. Rape is an awful crime, no matter who
commits it. It's interesting that you mention the Duke Rape Case, since
those white rapists that you mentioned were acquitted. Ironically, that's
EXACTLY the shit I'm talking about. Had the races been reversed, not only
would we have not heard about it in the news, but every single one of the
accused would be rotting away in prison right now. No questions asked.

Yeah, big props to Pinkko for putting words in my mouth and developing
clairvoyance, because there's no other way to arrive at his
conclusions about me from my actual words.

If you're so keen on asking why things happen, how about asking why the
crackhead doesn't have a house?  I'd guess it's because you don't like the
answer: nobody bought one for him. He's spent his whole life expecting
someone else to provide his lifestyle for him and doing crack, instead of
WORKING for his living (gasp!).  Nathan nailed it, the root of the problem
is the victim-mentality and entitlement culture surrounding all this
seemingly-perpetual poverty.  I've watched people break free from it with
absolutely no advantages over their neighbors and become successful, rich
even, without committing a single crime.  It may be harder for a black child
living in poverty to become successful than a middle class white child, but
it happens more often than many care to admit, and it leaves little excuse
for those who don't.

As for your personal insults to me, it's an easy way for you to avoid
discussing my points.  Conjecturing that someone you don't know is racist
and does nothing to contribute to the community has nothing to do with the
discussion at hand.

What matters to me is someone's behavior.  If someone, regardless of skin
color, creeps up behind me on the street at night, dressed like a thug, I'm
going to be scared.  If someone, regardless of skin color, spends their life
focusing on leeching off of the good will of others instead of taking
advantage of education and getting a job, then I don't think the system that
permits that behavior is a good one and I don't think their attitudes are
commendable.  It's truly sad that a disproportionate number of people from
some races fall into these categories, but they themselves, not their
circumstances, finances, culture, or race, are responsible for their own
choices and behaviors, and I hold them accountable the same way I hold
everyone accountable.

Concerning Rosa Parks and the Congressional Medal: what Rosa Parks did was
undeniably good and worthy of praise, recognition, and honor, and I doubt
that Ron Paul or anyone else here feels any differently.  However, whether
or not the government should spend $30,000 of taxpayer money giving her, OR
ANYONE ELSE, a medal is a completely different question.  Sure, $30k is
peanuts compared to the rest of the budget, but the point is that Ron Paul
votes consistently according to a constitutional view of government and
letting $30k slide because it's a small amount for an emotionally charged
and good-publicity-getting cause unfortunately wouldn't be consistent, now
would it?

I'll end with a quote:

No thanks- I'll remain in the real world :)

My suggestion - if you don't want folks calling u racist, don't say shit 
that pretty much sounds racist from any angle that you look at it.

I would THINK that would be a given, but...there's no accounting for common 
sense (or a lack thereof).

Personal insults? Calling someone that says racist shit a racist isn't a
personal insult, that's just calling a spade a spade.

Your lack of understanding of this world is fueled no doubt by Fox News and
Bill O'Reilly. Try being homeless for a while. Try starving for a while. Try
not being able to find a job or pay rent or do any of the things you take
for granted every single fucking day of your life.

It's easy for an educated white man to say that the disadvantaged just
haven't taken advantage of all the wonderful education and work
opportunities that are given to them. Have you ever even seen what a school
in the ghetto looks like? You know that kids in the poorer schools here
learn history with books that STILL SAY USSR in them? How the FUCK are you
going to look at the way things work now and tell me it's a level playing
field? That the problems we see in the streets are personal, not systemic?

Your entire line of reasoning is: "Poor people are poor, so they should have
to work harder than I do, because I'm not poor and, well fuck them for being
poor in the first place." No. FUCK YOU for helping to create a system that
is so unjust and allows so few to take so much while leaving so many with so
little.

GODDAMN you suck at being a human being.

Pinkko- there are two concepts I'm going to introduce you to-

1) tough love - the whole "give a man a fish/teach a man to fish" thing:
Maybe you've got a younger brother who kinda lived in your shadow, and  
instead of having to buy his own car and get a job and pay rent etc, he  
was just given a brand new car and was allowed to live at home rent-free.
Maybe you're old enough now to see that the reason he's almost 30 and  
still living at home with no job and only about $1000 in assests is  
specifically because of all the help he was given- it bred complacency and  
a reliance on the support system instead of self-sufficiency.
Maybe you actually feel really bad because you helped him out a lot before  
you saw the kind of cycle it created- and wish you hadn't...
The black community doesn't need its hand held, it needs its ass kicked-  
just like my brother-

2) self-identity:

> Maybe I'm blind, but I don't see a lot of shit about body language and  
> the
> kind of clothes someone's wearing in there. I do see a lot of mention of
> something else, though. . .

Right- you see "black!" and "race!" and your eyes fill with fire- know why?
Maybe you have a friend who, whenever he loses something- he thinks it's  
been stolen.
Why does he think that?  It's because he's a theif himself- his mind works  
in a thieving manner, so instead of a balanced response- "huh i dunno what  
happened to it"- he always thinks it's been stolen.

So when I read something like this:

> "Opinion polls consistently show that
> only about 5 percent of blacks have sensible political opinions, i.e.
> support the free market, individual liberty and the end of welfare and
> affirmative action,"

I think: "Hmmm only 5%?  Why is this segment of the community so  
ill-informed about such things?  Someone's dropping the ball somewhere..."

But when you read it- your head goes in to RACIST! mode-
Maybe you've figured out where I'm going with this :)
Err- I guess I'm already there- but the fact that you respond in such a  
manner tells me more about your true inner nature than you probably  
realize...

You're so full of shit that I'm not even going to bother responding to your
points. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about, so all I'm going
to do is ask you a question:

How much time have you spent talking to homeless people? Like, listening to
their stories?

I'm willing to bet it's a bit less than I have. These are human beings we're
talking about, not fucking cattle. You don't help someone out of the gutter
by putting your boot on their neck. Do you even see how the wealth that you
have is taken directly from these people? You should read some Marx,
asshole, you could learn a lot from him.

Finally, I don't see 'black' and immediately think 'RACISM.' I see shit like
this:

Citing reports that 85 percent
of all black men in the District of Columbia are arrested, Paul
wrote:"Given the inefficiencies of what D.C. laughingly calls the
`criminal justice system,' I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of
the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal," Paul
said.

And think 'holy shit, that's fucking racist as fuck.' Why? BECAUSE IT IS.

If you're going to be saying this racist shit, you should at least own up to
the fact that you're being fucking racist.

I've got another good one for ya:

Lawlessness is lawlessness. Anarchy is anarchy is anarchy. Neither race

That's easy for you to say. And it rings hollow as fuck in a nation built on
slavery.

Yeah, Champ, you're right again.

Single mother goes on welfare and uses the time to write a series of 
books that create the largest single personal fortune in the UK, you're 
right, bad example

I'll be sure to check my head that next time I engage my keyboard.

I'd also like to point out that you actually don't know my race or
background, because I haven't told you.  There are plenty of well-educated
blacks who say the same things that I do, so it would be equally valid to
assume that I'm one of them, wouldn't it?

You similarly know absolutely nothing about what I've done to help other
people less fortunate than I.  You have no idea what I've read (FYI I've
read plenty of Marx, more than enough to realize that his ideas are
terrible), or what news sources I use (ps: not Fox).  You had no idea that
both my parents are teachers and that yes, I've seen plenty of the shitty
side of the education system (and if you think it's bad in California you
should see some of the schools in Louisiana).  You might want to stop making
up things about me before you lose all shred of credibility.

Now let's look at a few things you've done in this conversation.  You've
quoted Ron Paul out of context about 4 different times.  You've ignored
other people's points instead of addressing them when you disagreed.  You've
provided no solid reasoning or demonstrative proof for your views, and your
only defense against other people's reasoning is to accuse them of racism
(without any support for your view).  You've resorted to rampant swearing in
a debate.

Is it too much to ask for you to leave the conversation gracefully, before
you insult more people who don't deserve it and lose even more face?  Or if
you'd like to discuss instead of rant, be my guest.

It's not racist to talk about behaviors, attitudes, and criminal
statistics.  That's all we're doing, and if you'd stop being so convinced
that any idea other than yours is racist you might be able to see that.  I
would never deny that we can do better (note: better doesn't necessarily
mean "more") at providing opportunities for the less privileged in this
country, but I hold people accountable for their choices nonetheless.

The extent of my "speaking" to the homeless has generally been me telling  
them what worthless pieces of shit they are while I was kicking them-
Though I guess it was more spit than words coming out :P

Ya you might not want to take that bet- I'm a think-globally, act-locally  
kind of guy-
The list is pretty long so I'll just give you some highlights-
I'm on a first name basis with most of the non-tweaker locals and know why  
they are where they are-
I've let some live in my house, when the shelter was full-
I've let some stay in my vehicles in my yard- a couch in a van is a pretty  
pimp pad when you're homeless and it's raining.
I've given a couple nice new boots and a warm jacket for xmas-
I've paid them to do work in my yard and on my house-
I drove one to court so he wouldn't miss his date and go back to jail-
I counseled another one of them at length about how ridiculous it was for  
him, at age 60, to be working his ass off living in his van with his dog,  
but sending all his money to his apartment-dwelling good-for-nothing  
jobless god-daughter and her also-jobless bf/pimp/dealer.
Oh he also was sending money to a Nigerian scammer for a cell phone so he  
could retrieve his share of Dr. Uembbe Ooblasanj's secret lost oil  
fortune... so I handled that too.

1.  It is racist to assume that the justice system missed out on 10 % 
of criminals, solely because they are black.

2.  It is, in fact, just as likely that 75% of the black men in the 
city are criminals, and the 10% error goes the other way.

3.  Criminals are people that are tried and convicted.  Just because 
someone's been arrested, a criminal he does not make.  If 85% of the 
black men in DC have been arrested, it could be due entirely to 
racial profiling by the police.

I was going to berate each of you 3 for your terrible logic, but it's 
so not worth my time. :)

Nobody said that- I'm sure that the stats for white/asian/mexican/whatever  
crime are also under-represented by the same amount-
It's a given that there's a certain percentage of all crime that goes  
undetected/unreported- there's no color line there.

Doubtful- see above- a significant percentage of crime is *not* caught-  
and I'm fairly certain it far outweighs any contribution caused by corrupt  
police and fabricated crimes and planted evidence etc-

Hmmm I'm not familiar with the actual study referenced- but was it  
"arrested" versus "convicted"?
If so- I entirely concede that profiling could be the cause of that- but I  
also would argue that profiling is in fact a most effective way of  
deterring crime- whether you like to admit it or not.
See my El Al mention a couple posts back-

You can keep all the criminals off an airline by not letting ANYONE 
fly.  That's a 100% sure fire method.  That doesn't make it fair or just.

Why don't you post what El Al profiles based on?  You seem to know 
what / where it is, I sure don't.. and you (again) have the burden of proof. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Beatport DJ?  Program to rename your songs

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Hola,

I wrote a small program to rewrite the filenames of songs you download from beatport.com to include the Track, Artist, and Label.  Thank you Forest Green and Andy Highland for the ideas.

They currently only include the Beatport song ID and Track name, making it very easy to forget who actually wrote the songs.

It's written in Python, and instructions on how to use it and where to get it are here:

http://phillip.freedomring.net

Feel free to modify it at your own will and for your own purposes. :)

-Phillip

Love the idea, but it's too complicated for me. Why doesn't Beatport 
just put it where it should be?

My only idea is that it's easier to control all the artists if no one knows who they are...

It is definitely intentional, as the song names are written based on entries in the database.

This was the first revision, I'll see if I can make it more user friendly with maybe a little GUI later on.

The beatport track naming is annoying.

I had the same frustration, so I created a multi-step process that
includes a proxy (paros), perl scripts (XML::Twig and DBD::SQLite)
that tag and rename after converting wav to flac, and a couple
shell one-liners.

I need to clean it up, but I suppose if someone was interested I'd share
some/all of it. You need to be rather technical to use it in its current
state.

By its own admission, 84 of every 100 children screened by TeenScreen
are falsely identified as having a "mental disorder." That?s 84%
falsely identified, falsely labeled. When identified as having a
mental disorder, students are referred to a mental health
professional. More times than not, students are then placed on
prescription anti-depressants; medications that carry a FDA black-box
warning that they can cause violent behavior and/or suicide. An
increasing number of school-shooters have been on anti-depressants,
including Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold (Columbine; Jefferson County,
Colorado) and Kip Kinkel (Springfield, Oregon).

No one ever heard of creating a simple notepad document and just jotting

tracks a week I am sure...

It's amazing how much work folks will go through to be lazy, lol.

Actually, I'm trying to buy as many cuts a week as I can, sometimes I get
pretty close to 100. I don't let the beatport filenames get me down, though.
They properly fill out all their id3 tags, so (on Vista at least), you can
in the OS get the track name, artist, and sometimes even record label. I use
Serato, which has excellent support for ID3 tags, so I don't really have
that problem. I'd recommend finding something to play with that understands
ID3, it makes your life a lot easier, no shell scripts necessary.

Indeed, if you're super concerned about that, you can have iTunes rename the
tracks based on the ID3 tags.

That would take too long.

Buying thirty tracks once makes automation worth it.

Three desirable attributes of programmers, according to Larry Wall
are: laziness, impatience, and hubris. For more on this browse
to:

http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/larry.html

Here's one track I have, properly named:
(threshold_productions)_never_forever_[rpo_remix].flac

Its original name was something like:
150294_Never_Forever_RPO_Remix.wav

Its tag is as follows:
METADATA block #2
  type: 4 (VORBIS_COMMENT)
  is last: false
  length: 281
  vendor string: reference libFLAC 1.1.2 20050205

    comment[4]: TITLE=Never Forever [RPO Remix]
    comment[5]: GENRE=Progressive House
    comment[6]: DESCRIPTION=Label: Frekency Records
    comment[7]: VERSION=RPO Remix

Its database entry is:
456|150294|Never Forever|RPO Remix|08:00|1|2006-06-13|2006-06-29|$1.49|Frekency Records|Progressive House|Progressive House|Threshold Productions|Never Forever|Buy|General Content|Rick Pier O'Neil|8297164|http://www.beatport.com/user/downloads/download/?downloadId=8297164|wav|Beatport

I have no interest in typing all that in by hand for one song, the
commands to convert it from wav to flac by hand, or the commands to
tag, enter it into the db, etc by hand.

I *do* have to make entries into the db by hand for vinyl and CD, but
after that, the rest of the work is done with the automation I have.

I guess if you are that A.R. about naming & cataloguing your tracks, that 
works.

I just wanna know who did it, who remixed it, and the name of the track - I 
could care less about labels, as I tend to remember what labels shit has 
come out on.

Funny, I have noticed getting tons of promo tracks from labels, that they 
are ALWAYS tagged w/ label info and release #, etc.

As far as I know wav doesn't support id3 tags.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

i live in the ghetto - i'm white - and let me tell u - there's rascism both ways - try buying a sack of herb on market and u'll see what i mean - go down 6th and talk  (literally just talk) to the wrong chick and u'll get punched in the face. And no one cares b/c ur just a stupid white boy that probably diserved it.
 
 i'll cypher with the best of them - but i don't cypher unless i got some back up b/c i've been attacked by wack crews who couldn't handle the fact that this white boy just served them.
 
 big up love for all,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Beatport DJ? Program to rename your songs

I dunno - again, I'm not so anal that I need all that info for my tracks. I 
rename everything by hand and burn it all to disc immediately.

All that excess stuff makes no nevermind to me - I just wanna know the name 
of the track and the remix for when I am rifling through my book and 
selecting tracks to drop. All that extra stuff...is...well...not needed.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

I dunno, I work right by 6th & Market, I'm as white as white can be, and I 
have NEVER had so much as attitude thrown my way by any of the afro-american 
folk there. I see more sneers and shitty 'tudes from white folks actually.

Except on the bus. Now that is the ONLY place in this area I have tended to 
see racist ass people of all nationalities/ethnicities...but, the bus is 
special like that.

it gives me the ability to track what I'm playing for my show and gigs.

I can also rapidly query when looking for something specific.

the bus is special like that.

working is one thing - u have a place to go. 

when ur homeless and trying sell a lil bit of herb to get a place to stay for the night and a crew of high school fat asses from fillmore take ur shit b/c ur white it's fucked up. B/c u know they are going home to mommy and daddys that night and counting their bill wads and laughing. 

But if they want to battle, i'll show them who the hardest emcee is any day of the week - i;ll say bring it - b.c i don;t have shit to lose and even if i did i'll just get double what i lost after a few months.

the old timers know the game - and ignorance is the #1 cause of rascism.

u don't see attitudes - u get fucked over when ur down.

u should have seen my bruises after i got jumped in hunter's point - i know i shouldn't of gone there - but i was new to the city and sleeping on busses got off for a cig and boom. I didn't have a dollar on me - all they got was my back pack which had my journal in it (all my flows) and my passport. Both things that were far more valuable to me then anyone else. Why should a part of the city be sectioned off. This is Frisco, not LA.

Except on the bus. Now that is the ONLY place in this area I have tended to 
see racist ass people of all nationalities/ethnicities...but, the bus is 
special like that.

What?

My guess is that you are pedling the wrong shit on the
wrong corner. Find some nice yuppies to sell $75 sacks
to, or switch to crack if you're going to kick it in
the mission.

Better yet. Do it on the DL... rather than broadcast
your hustle on the internet.

i don't fuck with crack - i have social ethics.
 
 and it's about time someone starts speaking about lack of balance on the streets.
 
 b/c shit is fucked up. 
 
 and all i was talking about was herb - who's broadcasting what husstle?
 
 who mentioned crack. Why is it that everyone who's an emcee has to also be a crack salesman.
 
 i'm sorry if it offends u but this is real - don't give me any blogger drama.



Eric Spire <ericspire@yahoo.com> wrote: What?

My guess is that you are pedling the wrong shit on the
wrong corner. Find some nice yuppies to sell $75 sacks
to, or switch to crack if you're going to kick it in
the mission.

Better yet. Do it on the DL... rather than broadcast
your hustle on the internet.

>Control + F isn't cutting it?

nope. neither does WinKey + F, Option + F, or any of the following:

ls -latR |grep -i foo
find . -type f -name \*foo\*
find . -type f -name \*.flac -print0 |xargs -0i@ metaflac --list --block-type VORBIS_COMMENT @ |grep -i foo

however, 'select * from trackz where artist like "%foo%";' works rather
nicely.

It's clear from our conversation that our requirements for track
finding and selection differ--and that is fine.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

There's a "lack of balance on the streets" cuz folks of the darker variety 
have been shoved into the streets much moreso than little crackers...

But I grew up in the dirty District (DC), aka Chocolate City, and I have 
spent mad time in the seedier parts there, Baltimore, Oakland, Denver, and 
to a lesser extent SF - and as long as you don't carry yourself like a 
victim, 9 times out of ten you won't be one. Not saying there aren't 
exceptions to that rule - but you need to be aware of your surroundings, and 
if you are in the 'hood, you need to watch your ass.

I hate to say it, but I have little sympathy for folks who put themselves in 
harm's way and then wonder why bad shit happens to them. It still sucks if 
it happens, but c'mon - don't go wandering around the 'hood if you don't 
want to get rolled.

i agree with entirely

But I grew up in the dirty District (DC), aka Chocolate City, and I have 
spent mad time in the seedier parts there, Baltimore, Oakland, Denver, and 
to a lesser extent SF - and as long as you don't carry yourself like a 
victim, 9 times out of ten you won't be one. Not saying there aren't 
exceptions to that rule - but you need to be aware of your surroundings, and 
if you are in the 'hood, you need to watch your ass.

I hate to say it, but I have little sympathy for folks who put themselves in 
harm's way and then wonder why bad shit happens to them. It still sucks if 
it happens, but c'mon - don't go wandering around the 'hood if you don't 
want to get rolled.

But I grew up in the dirty District (DC), aka Chocolate City, and I have 
spent mad time in the seedier parts there, Baltimore, Oakland, Denver, and 
to a lesser extent SF - and as long as you don't carry yourself like a 
victim, 9 times out of ten you won't be one. Not saying there aren't 
exceptions to that rule - but you need to be aware of your surroundings, and 
if you are in the 'hood, you need to watch your ass.

I hate to say it, but I have little sympathy for folks who put themselves in 
harm's way and then wonder why bad shit happens to them. It still sucks if 
it happens, but c'mon - don't go wandering around the 'hood if you don't 
want to get rolled.

But I grew up in the dirty District (DC), aka Chocolate City, and I have 
spent mad time in the seedier parts there, Baltimore, Oakland, Denver, and 
to a lesser extent SF - and as long as you don't carry yourself like a 
victim, 9 times out of ten you won't be one. Not saying there aren't 
exceptions to that rule - but you need to be aware of your surroundings, and 
if you are in the 'hood, you need to watch your ass.

I hate to say it, but I have little sympathy for folks who put themselves in 
harm's way and then wonder why bad shit happens to them. It still sucks if 
it happens, but c'mon - don't go wandering around the 'hood if you don't 
want to get rolled.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

I think a lot of us share that wish...but the reality of the situation is,

Subject: [sfraves] Ahhh, burningman.


Burning Man Art.

Its cool and all, it really is.  But man.. is it really worth bankrupting
yourself and devoting untold time to suspend 2 big rigs in the air?  I mean,
yeah, it looks cool and all.  But... man! the scale!  I know you have
to be a little crazy to want to do art, but to budget it, get BM money,
then ask the community for another $20,000... I mean.. there is probalby 
a lot of other cool art this guy could have done for a more modest budget.

I mean, he needs 3 flatbed trucks to get it to the playa?

Okay, I am posting this poking fun at the poor guy, but who knows, maybe
some sfraves are sympathetic to his cause?  Personally, would rather donate
money to a battered woman's shelter then this over-wrought peice of BM art.
But maybe that is just me....

SPECIAL ART EDITION

Two of our most ambitious honorarium projects for 2007 are BigRigJig by
Mike Ross and JIm Mason's  Mechabolic: Cyborg Speculations in Machine
Metabolism.

Although Burning Man funded both projects, each has exhausted their
budget and is in need of financial support. We have never before
approached the community for help like this, but we are  unable to
further fund these projects, so we are calling on our readers for help
in a few ways.

Mike Ross of Big Rig Jig - (see the project at http://www.bigrigjig.com
- it's literally awesome) - reports:

"Things are going well on the project.  We are on schedule, and ramping
things up dramatically for the last few weeks.  Several new core crew
members just arrived from New York with a burst of energy and
enthusiasm.  We are working full time, 7 days a week, from about 2pm to
4am (last two nights till 5am, actually).  Its an amazing group of
people that can sacrifice months of their lives, working that hard to
pull something like this off.  Im lucky to have them around.  And we are
all lucky to have Burning Man provide the opportunity for us.

Unfortunately, despite our best and continued efforts, we are out of
money.  Putting two big rig trucks 40 feet up in the air is enormously
difficult, especially when you come from out of town (we moved our
entire operation from Brooklyn, NY to California in order to build this
sculpture).  We received the majority of our funding from the Burning
Man grant, and immediately began seeking additional sources to make up
for the remainder of our budget.  But between setting up a new shop,
finding our materials in an unfamiliar environment, and actually
building the project, our time is stretched thin.   The long and short
of it is that we have so far failed to find the additional funding we
need.  As of two weeks ago,  the project is being funded by personal
credit cards, which is difficult as I have no source of income right
now, and have already spent my savings on the project.  If you know of
any emergency funding opportunities, or other helpful people or
resources, we would be much obliged. You can help with in kind donations
of materials, too.

If you can help, please contact   mikenon@gmail.com
Donate via PayPal to: donate@bigrigjig.com

Funding Needs:
To meet costs, we need to raise approximately $20,000.  Any donation,
large or small, helps.

Some specific in kind donations would help reduce this. Wish List:

   * I-beams: 72 feet of W14x109 I-beam (or approximate equivalent)
   * Road Plates: 5 road plates (or approximate equivalent) borrowed or
purchased
   * Chrome Truck Accessories, such as: air filter assemblies, exterior
"chicken" lights, bumpers, exhaust "stacks", rims
   * Lighting: exterior par cans or other lights which can project onto
the surface of the sculpture
   * 20 kW generator, or approximate equivalent, for use during 2-week
pre-event installation
   * Transportation Services: 3 full-length flatbeds from Oakland to the
playa before the event, and from playa to Oakland afterwards

Also, we can always use more volunteers in Oakland of various skill
levels, from skilled metal fabricators/welders, to anyone willing to
spend a few hours holding a grinder.

I think you missed a few decompression and precompression fundraisers in there.  They are year round.  It's totally fucking ridiculous.

Lossless compression.  It's called sound quality.

the point was, compression at all when you start out as wav...just, why?
you're burning it to a CD anyway, and HDD storage is beyond cheap these
days.  Staying as wav is called "sound quality"

and FLAC is terrible, maybe it's LESS lossy (it's not truly lossless, just
thought I'd mention) than other formats but it's pretty terrible in most
other ways.

also, you lose a generation of quality regardless, I'm sure I don't need to
explain this to most people but even with FLAC you lose quality by
converting

Indeed.  I'd prefer flac over a 320kbps mp3 however.

FLAC is lossless. After it's decompressed, you end up with a bitwise 
identical copy to the original input (WAV) file.

Yeah, and speaking of asking the community for more money I am raising donations for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Helping find new improved therapies for cancer patients is way cooler than big rigs at Burning Man. I don't even need $20,000 from the community (though, that would be cool). I only need $4800...actually, I made my half way point so I only need $2400. I screwed my knees up marathon training last year so now I am hiking. I love hiking and I am glad they have an event like this.
   
  Anyone want to throw a benefit and donate the procedes? Rave for a cure. That would be super cool!
   
  Anyone that wants to donate can do so here http://www.active.com/donate/hfdsvmb/hfdALeahey

yeah, it looks cool and all. But... man! the scale! I know you have
to be a little crazy to want to do art, but to budget it, get BM money,
then ask the community for another $20,000... I mean.. there is probalby 
a lot of other cool art this guy could have done for a more modest budget.

Not sure what you mean here.  You need to supply data to back up your
assertions. If you encode a wav into flac format, you get the same data
back:

# compressed w/ flac soul of man track from beatport (tagged and renamed too)
$ flac -dc
breaks/\(soul_of_man\)_foxy_moron_\[original_mix\].flac|md5sum

flac 1.1.4, Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007  Josh
Coalson
flac comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  This is free software, and you
are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.  Type `flac' for
details.

(soul_of_man)_foxy_moron_[original_mix].flac: done
2f0c4b07172f9c119d66df46d4642069  -

# original soul of man track from beatport
$ md5sum 93020_Foxy_Moron_Original_Mix.wav
2f0c4b07172f9c119d66df46d4642069  93020_Foxy_Moron_Original_Mix.wav

You should probably go educate yourself a bit about FLAC, WAV, lossless
compression, get some data and back up your assertions with that data.

Note that WAV is just a container format for PCM. It can be losslessly
compressed too.

Since the md5s aren't changing above, there is *no* loss to the data.

For more on the theory behind all this, go read:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wav
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC

You can go get tools that allow you to test this empirically, don't just
believe it because I'm telling that it is so.

Yeah, basically with lossless compression you are trading off less disk 
space and network bandwidth use for slightly more CPU use during playback 
(and substantially more CPU for the initial compression).

As Holt mentions below, CPU is getting cheaper a lot faster than disk and 
bandwidth, so it's a good tradeoff.

Additionally, there are cases when disk space is at a premium, such as on 
my 4GB nano. It can hold 12 albums in Apple Lossless format, vs. 6 in WAV. 
That's a meaningful difference to me.

I love it when douchebag techno-geeks argue about crap that very few people 
give a good god-damn about.

I love the irony of using the term "techno-geeks" as a
slur on a rave listserv

I also love the use of the term douchbag, but really
prefer when folks just haul off and call each other
"douche"

I will point out that Matthew generally has the right idea about
compression, he just had a misunderstanding about FLAC.

My aim isn't/wasn't to 'serve' Matthew and attempt to make
him look ignorant, in fact I initially wasn't going to reply
to his 'flac what the fuck' message since I thought it was silly
to get into it in depth. I saw one or two other messages that
tried to clear shit up and he didn't bite, so I threw out an
email with data.

Matthew still might have a reason (possibly qualitative?) for his point
of view.

Since I think this list is a mix of a lot of people, including
producers, I think this is fair game. If all you're doing is
throwing down tracks on a couple of CDJs and technics, my approach
is probably over the top (I acknowleged as much in a reply to one
of your emails earlier). Pure cocaine at the top of the audio chain,
since you're about to do a bunch of DSP (both in hardware and software
nowadays), is the best shit out there. FLAC is one way to get pure
cocaine. AIFF-C and others work as well.

FWIW, people get far more into this than we have in this thread.

For example, see:
http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t47922.html

>Being right was never cooler I bet!

Being right is so seventh grade.

Again, my aim was to educate.

Can I get a 3 day old rotting douche, anyone? Let's start
having fun. I think I'll go grab my 'hello my name is fuck
you' sticker from last weekend and put it on.

Maybe after we finish with name calling we can devolve into
'ur-mom' jokes?

admission: i was confused about how FLAC works.  what I said is correct for
probably 90% of popular compression formats though, and I thought FLAC works
the same.  comments about storage are true, though that depends on a
person's finances and computing experience.  now that I know more about how
it works, my opinion is better informed, everyone's happy, and I can
continue not preferring FLAC.  sounds better than mp3 and AAC (or whatever
that horrible Sony proprietary format is), now my biggest problem with it is
lack of support for FLAC in many popular media players/programs (which I
admit is probably old information and I'm guessing that newer models are
updating with better compatibility).

I might look into FLAC, if anyone can recommend a good compression program.
storage isn't a giant issue for me because I do plenty of non-music
computing and I can afford $100 for an extra 400GB if I ever run low on
space.  I do keep a good bit of music compressed, mostly albums, live sets,
compilations, and the like, since live sets especially only seem to come as
mp3.  I try to keep my DJ'ing library uncompressed, though sometimes I have
to settle for 320kbps mp3 sources.  Now if beatport would just get rid of
their bullshit "wav handling fee" or whatever....

that's why it doesn't make sense to shorten it..

a douchebag holds all the crap that was making the vagina feel 
bad.  like a bag of shit.  but worse.

After a better than 25 year search, I finally tracked down the legendary 
Clash show at the Palladium on 14th Street in New York City that they 
played on 21 September 1979, about 3 months before "London Calling" was 
released in the United States.

I know everyone that's reading this is familiar with one aspect of it, 
it's the show where this picture http://tinyurl.com/y553zx  was taken.

Now that I've gotten your attention, here it is 
http://isohunt.com/download/19452907/clash+palladium

Great right?

To a point because it's a .flac file, which 448, or so, megs aside, 
presents a raft of technical problems for the average end-user, because 
they're simply not going to jump thru the hoops required to get the damn 
thing to play on their iPhonde.

That's not why they dropped $600+ bucks on it.

For that kind of money, they expect shit to work on demand, and since I 
don't see a $30K wireless electrostatic vacuum tube wireless headphone 
arrangement http://tinyurl.com/36hj9g projecting from anyone's mp3 
player, (for myself I'm happy with my HD 600s, http://tinyurl.com/22gon3 
thank you very much), I just don't see the point in not making a file as 
accessible to as many peeples as possible, so it actually, you know, 
like, be listened to.

I converted the Clash's LC Live At The Palladium  .flac file to .mp3 and 
it's all of 140 megs, and once I figure out how to seed the damn thing 
on bittorrent I'm gonna post it on the internets and I don't think 
anybody that DLs it is going to bitch over the quality of the audio.

Your mileage, as always, may vary.

i'm sure it feels cooler than being an asshole :)

_the asshole_

from his mouth he shat
spittin' words of an asshat
how'd the motha fukka get a head so fat ?
wreakin' and stinkin'
when he shoulda been thinking
pepe le peue couldn't stink like that

mutha fukka is deranged
sensibility estranged
mouth gettin' raped
like a louisanna lane change

but holt shut'm down
his shit now comin' from a frown
matt was merely ignant
but that van's the ass clown

sfr don't play
when you do it like that
got brainiac fukkas
just waitin' on tap
we're shuttin' down, flushin' down
the shit that you shat

git your face some clearisil
take a fucking chill pill
just get rid of that shat
or will bring the vagisil

logic is the king
bring even YOU protection
so fuck your baby rat
and your yeast infection

WTF is Eric playing so late for??  Jesus.  Guess I'm NOT going to be  
able to make...considering I can't sleep all day Sunday.  Would it  
not make more sense to have Bone on earlier in the evening...and I  
don't mean opening slot, but fuck.  Oh well.  Have fun.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Work it to the Bone tomorrow SFRavers

This is my single biggest gripe with the majority of events here in SF. 
Headliners going on late as hell. We aren't all 23 years old and have the 
ability to be able to eat piles of drugs and stay out all night - it'd be 
nice to see a headliner come on no later than 1am and get a couple solid 
hours to do their magic. But a 2am start time? That is kinda on the late 
tip...

As much as I love Bone, I will be going to Tonal instead now.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Work it to the Bone tomorrow SFRavers

take your Geritol old man, if i can do it, you can do it!

it's a Saturday night afterhours party, i think putting the headliner
on b4 two would be weird, no? that's when the biggest influx of people
are just getting there after hitting the bars, etc first.

i mean, if it were a weeknight or something, yeah definitely earlier
would be better, but on a weekend in SF isn't 2-4am considered about
the prime slot?  i would consider it as such.

what's everyone else think?

Headliners going on late as hell. We aren't all 23 years old and have the 
ability to be able to eat piles of drugs and stay out all night - it'd be 
nice to see a headliner come on no later than 1am and get a couple solid 
hours to do their magic. But a 2am start time? That is kinda on the late 
tip...

As much as I love Bone, I will be going to Tonal instead now.

I think you missed a few decompression and precompression fundraisers in 
there.  They are year round.  It's totally fucking ridiculous.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Work it to the Bone tomorrow SFRavers

Don't get me wrong, I think the locals will be dope too - but honestly, I 
HATE waiting that late for a headliner at a club. At a Rave or something, I 
can see that - but at a night club, I wanna be able to suck back cocktails 
during the headliner's set - and that timeslot doesn't really afford me that 
luxury.

Personal preference, that's all...

Manchester music impresario dies


By Andrew Orlowski <mailto:andrew.orlowski@theregister.co.uk>
(andrew.orlowski@theregister.co.uk)

Published Saturday 11th August 2007 05:22 GMT

Rare was the day when Anthony Wilson, the Manchester music impresario =
and
local TV presenter who died yesterday, couldn't walk down the street in =
his
home city without a murmur of "wanker" and "cunt". It was as much as a =
part
of the city as the incessant drizzle.

But Wilson revelled in the role of camp, ironic, antihero and played it =
to
the hilt. In interviews in early June, six months after his cancer had =
been
diagnosed, Wilson fretted that Mancunians were suddenly "being nice to =
me".
This was a shock in such a fiercely unsentimental city.

Music lovers visiting Britain from overseas began skipping London in the
1990s, heading straight for what's now recognised as Britain's great =
music
city - and that owed much of that outrageous charm of Tony Wilson.

In the mid-70s Tony Wilson used his influence at Britain's leading
independent TV station Granada to promote The Sex Pistols and a new
generation of punk bands, then put his weight and capital behind a small
independent club and label in the city. Through fluke, good fortune and =
a
fierce pride in promoting local talent - Wilson had a recording sound =
genius
in producer Martin Hannett, a designer in Peter Saville, and a =
charismatic
genius in Joy Division's Ian Curtis - Factory Records became the first =
real
British independent label since Joe Meek's Triumph Records to gain
international kudos. The commercial success of Joy Division (later New
Order) was invested in a "New York style" nightclub, the Hacienda, which
later became a focal point of Britain's coalescence into a dance =
culture.
This bit of history celebrated in Michael Winterbottom's movie 24 Hour =
Party
People - a generous dramatization of Manchester music mythology.

Manchester's rise to prominence as a world music city coincided with
London's decline - and by 1980 the metropolis that gave the world The =
Who
and The Kinks in the 1960s had added nothing but novelty bands (The
Joboxers, Right Said Fred... and Blur) until the creative melting pot =
spewed
forth drum and bass, garage, two step and a mass of urban dance music.

Wilson himself had a famously terrible judgement for music and also, for =
a
Piscean, he was notoriously Aquarian when it came to money. He rarely =
knew
what was happening musically in Manchester (he was wary of The Fall and
declined to sign The Smiths, and promoted folk music just as acid house =
was
taking off) at any given point in its Factory's history, and he rarely =
knew
who was pocketing the readies from his business endeavours.

He revelled in the role of intellectual fop. In Winterbottom's movie, a
cameo Christopher Eccleston playing a drunk recites Petrarchus' cyclical
view of history under a railway to invigorate a dispirited Wilson. In =
real
life, Wilson contradicted Victor Lewis-Smith's contention that Oxbridge
graduates mention their college at dinner parties within seven minutes -
only by invariably mentioning his Cambridge education within the first =
180
seconds of meeting. Wilson insisted a vast portrait hung over the box =
office
over the Hacienda.

Yet for all the pretensions, Wilson forged a link between the Jewish
cultural entrepreneurs of North Manchester - promoters and managers such =
as
Alan Wise and Elliott Rashman, who were heirs to the tradition of =
Charles
Halle (who the Mancunian novelist Anthony Burgess credited with =
"civilising
England") and the hippy South Manchester scene of CP Lee and Bruce =
Mitchell.

Cities need such characters.

In the punk era, Liverpool had Bill Drummond and Manchester, for better =
or
worse, had Wilson - both were relentless promoters. While Drummond came =
and
went (to later burn =A31m for the heck of it, as an "art project" after =
his
pop success with KLF), Wilson, a Salford Catholic, stayed to the end. =
Wilson
never invested a penny outside the city of Manchester. Thirty miles away
over the Pennines, Sheffield had a thriving scene which gave us The =
Human
League and Pulp, and gave a backbone to electro and acid house - but =
lacked
such a svengali as a Drummond or Wilson.

Because Wilson stuck around, with New Order sustaining the Hacienda, he
later basked in the light shone by "Madchester", when "even the white =
boys
learned how to dance". Even if he didn't immediately recognize a trend, =
once
he saw it, he promoted it ferociously. And in losing him, the North of
England lost a great voice.

In 1992 Wilson set up In The City, a music industry schmoozefest to =
which
this reporter was generously given a keynote [transcript
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/23/orlowski_interactive_keynote/>
(http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/23/orlowski_interactive_keynote/)] =
-
"just to shake things up".

Wilson was fabulously utopian about the potential of music, never more =
so
than in this quote to biographer Bill Sykes, who's writing a life of the
great scene maker and music promoter Roger Eagle:

"I always think that what Richard Boon and Howard Devoto did bringing =
the
Pistols to Manchester on June 4th [1976] was the same thing as the =
Germans
putting Lenin into a cattle cart and sending the railway train into =
Russia,"
he said last year.

"They sent this firebrand, this spark to fuck up the Russians, which of
course it did. It caused a revolution."

We couldn't ever admit as much on earth, but we'll miss you so much, =

Personally I'm with Andrew P on this one, if it's an afterhours underground
event then 2-4 is definitely peak.  I know that at some parties I've been to
3-6am was the prime timeslot.  Like when QBAM played back in January or
February, he had just come on when I got there at maybe 2:30 and he was
still pumping out one sick sexy bassline after the next when we left at 6am,
and there was a decent crowd to the end (that particular party is one of the
best I've ever been to and it changed my perspective on the scene, btw,
thanks a ton Andrew).  So I guess it just depends what you're prepared for.
Myself, I love techno and techno simply does not come to the bay area often
enough to miss an opportunity like this.  Although to be fair, I'm stuck
down in Houston, TX until mid-september, and our scene is horseshit so I
haven't even been to a party/concert/event in weeks.

Hi all,

Sorry for a followup email.  The original aa.zip that was on http://phillip.freedomring.net didn't work.  I didn't realize what beatport calls the 'mix' is in the original filename.  (I don't actually DJ :))  It now works, and I included a convertwav.bat and convertmp3.bat, so all you need to do now is unzip the contents of aa.zip into the directory of your newly downloaded songs, replace the content of receipt.txt with the information in your beatport email receipt, and run convertwav.bat or convertmp3.bat.  (It also ignores any non-song information, so you can copy the entire receipt into receipt.txt and it will rename the songs properly)

Thanks,
Phillip



Phillip Mispagel <phillip@viberation.com> wrote: Hola,

I wrote a small program to rewrite the filenames of songs you download from beatport.com to include the Track, Artist, and Label.  Thank you Forest Green and Andy Highland for the ideas.

They currently only include the Beatport song ID and Track name, making it very easy to forget who actually wrote the songs.

It's written in Python, and instructions on how to use it and where to get it are here:

http://phillip.freedomring.net

Feel free to modify it at your own will and for your own purposes. :)

sorry, I have a bunch of shit to do today.  I'm up at 9:30 AM, after 
a full night's sleep.  I wanted to see Bone, but getting to sleep at 
5 AM wasn't going to cut it.

we got to the door around 3, and they wanted $20/person.  fuck
that.  osby told me that he'd get us in for 1/2 off if we told
them we were coming from jelly's (the party i was DJing at),
but they wouldn't go for that.

lame, because they were promoting for their party within ours.

anyway, headed to prismatic.  holy sweatbox.  good crowd, great
music.  thanks andrew and everyone for throwing a kick-ass
final party.  i've never seen that many cars at the gingerbread
- it was a sight to behold.  :)

off to sunset!  i'm bringing some homebrew, so hit me up for a
glass.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Work it to the Bone tomorrow SFRavers


DJ Bone was fucking amazing.

Class in session shit, changing it up, tribal funky soulful tweaky robot 
fucking noises from a guy who went from cool to badass over his over 4 
hours on deck (got on around 2, ran out of records around 6:15).  All at 
an old school renegade location that's been going strong for over ten 
years now.  Morning had shit eating grins all around, seriously great 
times.

Just plain badass.  No cheerleading, no posturing, just in the zone 313 
delivery from a fucking pimp with a head-down "make it work" ethic.  Only 
gripes I can come up with at all are:

* I didn't play :)
* my feet are screwed today from 250+ minutes of dancing my ass off
* sound could have used some chest defibrolating bass
* Eric was hitting on the girl I met up with there (more funny than 
anything).  Was awesome that she came out at all, she's a self professed 
"not into techno" person and ended up dancing more than she had in 5 years.  
Whoops, convert!
* there were two morons on the dancefloor screaming their heads off, 
whooping it up as new records would come in.  Luckily for me, one of them 
was me so it's easier to forgive them.

He played 100% vinyl, and in talking with him after the show he had a 
great quote about modern production/dj mixing stuff... "these technologies 
that should be making stuff better are just making it easier, we need to 
do what they did back in the day with those limited devices with what's 
available now".

Schooled.

Weird, it was a $10 party.  Might have jacked the price on account of 
being it being sorta packed in there around the time you showed up, but 
that doesn't make a ton of sense.  Maybe it was near full but they hadn't 
made it out of the red yet... bad math in any case.

Tonal parties have been consistently some of the best parties I've ever been
to.  They've been going at approximately the rate of one per month, so don't
worry, there will be plenty more.  I was out of town for this one but I'm
looking forward to the next already.

 I think this Tonal party is one they are going to talk about for years to come. It had an awesome vibe allready just to get pushed over the edge when Dj Rap decided to show for an unscheduled dj set. I think the party could have easily gone another couple of hours. I will love to see the Tonal parties try and or accomplish toping this one.

There's a lot of really good beer that'll be represented.  Iron Springs in
Fairfax (marin county) has some really good stuff-  they just don't bottle
it and sell it in stores (just yet!).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Work it to the Bone tomorrow SFRavers

Hey Mike -

No worries on the door thing.  I was just more like, "whoa -
these guys were promoting within our party (on the same
night)".  I understand the raising the price thing, tho - it's
a good marketing decision to ensure people get to your party
early.  :)  

I wouldn't have minded paying $10/person to see Bone for an
hour, but it worked out anyway, as we were pretty beat and left
Tonal early-ish to get some food.

Did you guys happen to record his set?  I'd love to hear it -
Nico's been talking about Bone for years, and I was really
looking forward to his set...

Thanks!

Ah...

You missed out!  I brought FOUR different kinds of my beer
along:

- IPA
- Dutch Strong Ale
- Porter
- Summer Ale

Everyone agreed that the IPA was too carbonated, but tasted
good.  The Dutch Strong Ale was a favorite, as was the Porter. 
But the real winner was the Summer Ale.  :)

I still have a case of the Summer Ale left - I'll bring some
out next time!

Hi Mike,

Thank you for the adjustment for Forest and I.

In regards to the door, that was a poor decision. We were
almost at capacity and we had an influx of clubbers and underage kids. So we started carding more diligently and asked for more at the door, before we had to start turning people away completely. I tried to make adjustments for everyone we knew. Sorry I wasn't near the
door when Michael & friends arrived.
I've been paying $20 cover for
most of the after hours I have been to in the past few months, so I
didn't think it was totally unreasonable. Inexperience on my part. Bad
idea... I won't make that mistake again.

Weird, it was a $10 party.  Might have jacked the price on account of 
being it being sorta packed in there around the time you showed up, but 
that doesn't make a ton of
 sense.  Maybe it was near full but they hadn't 
made it out of the red yet... bad math in any case.

Hello, my name is Peter, and I've been in the rave scene for about a year
and a half.  I will be going to Burning Man on August 27th and have a free
spot.  The price of the ticket will be 260 dollars, plus i'll give you a
ride and we can split the cost of provisions neccessary for a week of
survival in the nevada desert.  HOWEVER, you MUST be able to get yourself to
sacramento.  You can take a train or a bus, it's really not that expensive
to do so if you do not have a car.  Please let me know if anyone is
interested in this sort of thing, I'd be more than happy to have a fellow
raver accompany me in the insanity of art and culture that is Burning Man.
Hope everyone is having a great day :)

Thanks to everyone who came out and supported Tonal on Saturday, and thanks

Terry for bringing the visual goodness down for us for the first time it
looked great in there!

Our next event is Tonal: Clockwork Orange on Saturday, October 20th.  Lineup
will be announced soon!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] TONAL!!!!!!

Thanks that was super fun.

I mean how the hell do you do visuals for a "black" themed 
party? It certainly was different and a challenge...and dark ;-)

fyi, Ryan was responsible for all the naughty subliminal 
messages on the screen, I ducked out of the venue for a bit 
mid-party. Hope you enjoyed his brand of humor :-)

Hi I'm back -

Internet was down for a while.  We were entering the Great Void that  
you have to cross when you are going from Romulan space to Earth.   
Remember the last Star Trek movie?  Well it's all real.  And I really  
am headed back from the Delta Quadrant.

... Well, at least I certainly feel like it.  Have a nice day!

Hi guys,
   
  I am having a fundraiser in Foster City tonight for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Kobe has agreed to donate 15% of all food and drink sales if you bring in a flyer. If you are in the peninsula and would like a flyer please email me directly and I will send you one.
   
  Thanks,
  Amber

there are any doctors on the list lurking in the shadows that might offer
some advice?

I want to be an ER doc and work the night shift.

I may end up having to move back with my parents for a bit (which sucks,
college is EXPENSIVE), but if it ends up with me being a doctor, it'll be
worth it.

Have you worked a night shift before?  I didn't think I'd mind it until I tried it recently.  It totally fucked with my life and I won't work it again.

Becca from SFR-P is in med school right now, She was at the 
Tonal party since she has a rotation currently in the Bay Area.

I don't think she reads this list anymore though.

Although, I heard she was planning on giving free prostate exams 
at the next campout. Whee!!

Yeah.. i was gonna mention Becca too :)  I'm so proud of her!!!

Al, I totally believe in you man to like do what you want... if you're up
to taking out loans & grants & stuff, i don't see why you can't just stay
here to go to school.. i mean.. you'd probably have to go JC first anyway
to build up your College credits, then transfer to a 4 year, then do Med
school :)

I know when i decided to go back to school & my parents totally had my
back, & although it's takin' longer than expected, i think they still
proud of me.. i think.. we just had a fight tonight about plastic pvc
pieces...

But do it!  I know for a fact that being an ER doctor is hella more
studying & like training than a specialty doctor!  But you can do it!  I
know you can!!  Love Ya Homie!

I have in fact. I've always, even when I was a little kid, been more
creative and focused at night. The ideal schedule for me is starting at lik=
e
11pm or so and going all night. I don't just like it, I love that shit.

Yeah, that's the plan I'm kind of hatching out now. It's tough to decide,
though. Rent is so expensive here, and I could live for free with my parent=
s
in Florida.

But. . . that's in Florida. And I really don't want to leave California. I'=
m
going to do my best to make it work out here.

Subject: [sfraves] Question....

Just a question for those out there in promotions land (or even if you're 
not a promoter).

If you knew someone (a friend) who wanted to book a headliner for a party, 
and they arranged the booking, and then they came to you and asked you to 
help with the booking fees because they couldn't afford them on their own, 
and you agreed to split the costs with the person - then they turned around 
and had someone ELSE pay part of what THEY were going to pay, but left you 
still paying half (as was originally arranged) - would that be fair?

And let's pretend that the person that asked for your help didn't ASK you 
about this, they just went and did it...

What are your opinions on this subject?

Ok that is shady! They obivously left you under the impression that you
 were paying half, and THEY were paying the other half. They coudlve
 just as easily told u that they couldnt pay anything and was getting help
 from another person. why not? I would be bothered myself.

I'd have made it very clear up front that you were loaning him the half, no matter how the party does.

Aside from that, I'd be a little irritated since it now removes him from any personal money loss if he is the flakey type.

I've also found that lots and lots of party promoters are shady, so this doesn't sound out of the ordinary at all.

Aside from that, I'd be a little irritated since it now removes him from any personal money loss if he is the flakey type.

If you knew someone (a friend) who wanted to book a headliner for a party, 
and they arranged the booking, and then they came to you and asked you to 
help with the booking fees because they couldn't afford them on their own, 
and you agreed to split the costs with the person - then they turned around 
and had someone ELSE pay part of what THEY were going to pay, but left you 
still paying half (as was originally arranged) - would that be fair?

And let's pretend that the person that asked for your help didn't ASK you 
about this, they just went and did it...

What are your opinions on this subject?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question....

Well, it's not a loan - as I expect that most parties barely break even. I 
was fine with ponying up what I said I would - I just wanted a little 
communication about it.

The capper, is he says to me " he expected I'd have a problem with it", yet 
never had the common courtesy to say that to ME, and is now making it out to 
be me being a cheapskate.

*sigh*

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question....



As long as he came up with his half, I wouldn't really
care where he got it.  If he pulled it out of a bank,
sold his car, pimped his Aunt Tilly, wn it in a dice
game, borrowed it from a loan shark, etc. wouldn't
matter to me as long as he had his half in-hand when
he needed to.  How he gets his money is his own
business.

Now, if this side-deal of his somehow affected *my*
ability to make my money back (or cut into *my* profit
percentage) *then* I'd be pissed.  But if it's just a
matter of where he's getting his scratch from, I could
care less.

It's gonna be so much fun, I'm gonna completely blow up the

After all those years back in the day going to Tribal Funks and

later I get to go back and blow it up myself.

Kinda of a full circle thing, yanno. :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question....

The answer is simple: If there is no pecking order in
relation to payback and/or profits, it should not
matter a bit. If, on the other hand, there is a
payback agreement which makes one person's money a
higher priority than the others, it could go terribly
wrong. Ultimately, it comes down to getting paid back.
If everything is sorted out correctly in the end, then
it makes no difference at all.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question....

I would probably be less butt-hurt if it weren't for the fact that there was 
no communication with me regarding it whatsoever, and there was no attempt 
made to get help for part of what *I* was ponying up.

Like, rather than me paying $250 and him paying $250 and the other person 
tossing in their $100 to round it out.

Just seems like if you ask someone to help you out, and they are doing so - 
the least you can do is communicate shit with them.

And on top of that, guess who isn't getting any credit for the 
booking....yea, that'd be me too. So I pony up the largest sum of cash, but 
no credit, no communication.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question....

I'm with Eric and Uncle Noah on this one.

It really doesn't affect too much unless this other person goes to "first 
paid back" rule.  We have several small investors in our events some of them 
being people or friends or even some of our parents.  There deffinatly is an 
order as to who gets paid back first and thats important.

Whether his half of the money came from him or not to me doesn't make too 
big of a difference as long as you still get paid back in a timely manner.

Paul

If you're worried about him being no longer on the hook, then it's not

This just came up in my QOD queue and has nothing in particular to do

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

i agree with this idea, too, i think the important thing to remember =20
is not to push people too hard to comply with making the world one =20
without racism.  the ones that are i tend to just let them talk and my =20
general silence tends and a little bit of "yea i'm not like that" =20
tends to change their views a bit.  but if someone's brought up that =20
way it's difficult to change them.

Quoting Morgan McCloud <mogopolis2000@yahoo.com>:

After all those years back in the day going to Tribal Funks and

Subject: [sfraves] Deep house@Blowfish sushi tonight. 

Hey Guys,

just a quick heads up for those that live in the SJ area and may or may not 
be going out tonight. I have the pleasure of playing at blowfish tonight and 
will be playing some deep house which is rare to hear my play these days... 
Well it sounds weird me even saying it, but yea I will be playing some 
groovy early night thumpers for those that want to get there drank and eat 
on before the big club night. Or just want to chill and have a more quiet 
evening listening to some good music. Some of the other jocks on the bill 
are the earwacks boys crew of DJ's with various sounds. But im sure you can 
expect deep to funky house from the others on the bill as well..

So if you have the means get your ass on down to blowfish tonight. I will be 
playing from 10-11


See some of ya tonight!!

Macadio

Subject: [sfraves] funkin' italo shiznitz

you gotta hear this.. it will be stuck in your head for quite some time.

we've been listening to italo disco all summer cause our neighbor is mad 
for it.. that and brazillian 'funk'. 4 days ago on a lark we decided to 
make an italo track of our own. i wrote crappy lyrics and put them into 
babblefish to italian from english and then retranslated them into 
english, then fixed the grammar a hair. chel-c wrote the music and 
cleaned up the vocal score. our roommate recorded and cleaned up the 
track in cubase. our other neighbor sang the lyrics after several sake 
shots. and lo! a crappy stereotypical homo-erotic italo disco track.

http://myspace.com/chelcfaithmusic

aside from the lyrics being so piss poor its not a bad track. but hey 
that's the fun of it. enjoy.\

There's supposed to be something between here and SC. Looks like everyone's
tight lipped, though. I swear I had an email in here somewhere...

Brandon, I do not even want to know the pain you are feeling today.  My

Subject: [sfraves] Anthony Shake Shakir interview

is available at http://infinitestatemachine.com/ , along with an mp3
clip from his upcoming album.  For those who haven't heard of Shake,
think funky hip-hop beats made with a techno template.  A clip from
his forthcoming album is also included.  If you liked DJ Bone's set
last weekend, here's some reading for context of how the music he
plays and champions originated, from someone who's been doing it since
day one.

Enjoy!

oh thats chicane's come tomorrow.

3rd last track though, starting at around 61:04 mark.

i didnt like when he was singing many verses at around
62:45-63:13 mark. sounded too wordy. would be nice to
devocalize that part.

but i like the chorus at 63:41-64:08 mark though.
reminiscence of that classic british male pop sound
like oasis or that greenday voice.

Subject: [sfraves] My INtergalactic Lastweekend Weekend Review :n)

OK.. so my weekend started when i left my house @ around 6PM & rode a bus
to a bus, a bus to the BART, a BART train to a BART train, from BART
walked to Caltrain, & from Caltrain to ummm... Santa Clara!!  On CalTrain,
I met Alfonzo ( i think that's how his names is pronounced), this dude
from Switzerland & was on a Student Visa or something Traveling around the
Country!!  He was a Very fun guy!! :)  When i got to the Sunnyvale
station, some stoner guy from some hick state who travelled to Cali via
Peace Corps then decided to stay here let me use his phone to call Terry
to pick me up (area code 814, where is that?)... then Terry picked me up &
YAAAAAAAY.. Terry.. Thank U & Paula soooooo much for everything again this
past weekend!!!

So Saturday, the BIG HUGE MONDO day!  Like well.. we got to Civic
Auditorium, well, i got there with Big J (1 of the promoters) around
2:30-3ish & helped with what i can to set up... then at 6PM SPACEGIRLS 2
took off... well.. actually.. me & my Homiegirl/ Baby Sis Ethel went to go
eat @ some Mexican Resturaunt for a bit 'cause we needed food, but when we
got back.. it was non stop!!

So like the contest winners & Debut performnces for 4 new Spacegirls
happened the 1st two sets i guess... then oooh yeah... they had Groovy
sets, but tbh, it got more ummm... terbulant when Amber got on the decks
in the main room.. oooooooh fuck yeah.. i was there her whole set and
lol.. I recognizeda lota old Techno she dropped & new Techno choonz...
YUM!!!  CandyFly went on next & well... she fucked it up more.. i mean.. i
remember her spinning more Techno & YUM!!  Actually... instead of being
onthe dance floor this time.. i was kinda like on stage most the whole
time dancing w/ Terri :P  Then Forest Went on after that & played alota
ElectroHouse!!  I mean... it was weird & fun music & ooh my gosh.. I Loved
it!!!  Then like ummm... Shortee was on next & ooh Fuck.. she tore that
fucki'n Spaceship up in to like damn pieces.. JUNGLE!!  I Loved it
sooooooo much!!!  Then her last track, she stopped spinning Jungle, put on
a breaks track, then started scratching & just did that 'til her set was
done!!!

OK.. & Shortee.. she is too damn fun to hang out with.. we spent like the
whole day/night laughing, makin jokes, & just kickin' it!!!  I mean..
during sound check when oooh oh oh oh... so this is kinda fun.. so the set
up for DJs on stage was Dope & weird... like there were 3 DJ set ups.. DJ
Spacegirl (no really, that's her name, not a Spacecgirl DJ) had her live
PA set up in the front, the CDJs & table were in the middle DJ area, & in
the back was Shortee's DJ set up....

There was a side room that was Jungle & Breaks!  From that ro0m, like Miss
Jag from Arizona.. like her & I met like 3-4 years ago when i was over
there... so we had alot to talk about & she like updated a few of us on
the scene out in AZ & how it's doing!!  Did u know that House DJs, like
it's hard for HOuse DJs out in AZ to get gigs 'cause something like
promoters who throw multi room/ genre events refuse to have house in
them.. so that's kinda odd :\ I do feel bad that i didn't get to talk to
Bexxie or really check out alot of her set.. I mean.. i was in the room
when she spun & danced a while!!  But i dunno.. like her & her husband
like were acting weird & didn't really socialize?!

Ofcourse it was fun kickin' it w/ My Ambertime, CandyFly, Buglady, &
Forest! LMAO... yeah... many a good drunk times w/ them... ok.. that's all
i'm gonna say about that.. Hello 2day!!!

Yeah... ofcourse it was a big ass Candy party & oooooooh man.. ok.. so i'm
walkin' like to the front of the auditorium to the entry hall place to
wait for :codetv to show up 'cause we decided that we were gonna do a
show, anywaze.. yeah... I went in the entry hall & right away... i saw
this like 40-50 Candy puddle like right almost from the middles of the
room to the wall.. it was Cute but like kinda scary @ the same time... but
i did meet alota Gropovy kids & it was fun!!  Oh mY goodness man..
aloooooota people i ain't seen in forever either decided to pop up too!! 
That was Dope!!

But yeah... :codetv, we were there.. i mean.. we ain't done that many
shows this year & i just thought it was a good way to get back in the
swing of things!  This show shold be editted w/in like 3-4 weeks!  LoL...
alota crazy moments were actually caught when I did interviews w/ some of
the Space Girls!

Overall, it was a fun party... as for the SG2 afterparty.. long story
short, the owner land owner basically kept changing his prices of what the
promoters were suppose to pay him... after 2 weeks of negotiations & a
list of what the owner dude wanted, everything totaled to $8000 & yeah...
that weas too much to spend on another production for the night... so
that's why the afterparty didn't happen!!!

YAAAY!!!  OK.. So Fun!!  I hope y'alls last weekend was Dope too!!  Ummm..
i dunno where i 'm gonna be this weekend.. but hopefully I'll see some of
y'all!!  Unka, call me & gimme the 411 girl!!

Love U All!!!

Take Care <3
Peace=->Jus' Me =-> O§bY {8O)

 man how did u find this video? I was just out of highschool but, suck that I was not into the rave seen yet. I was still into throwing tagging, house parties, movie/drive in drink parties, and street racing. Need to see if anyone has footage of homebase, which I totally missed out on.

This isn't all that new an idea, or the first time this approach has 
been used http://tinyurl.com/qyh8g

What I find most telling is that the most highly consumed drug, across 
the board, in the USA is caffeine.

Plurhaps if we all didn't have that second cup of SBUX, (Market Cap $20 
billion), in the morning, we'd see a drop in road rage incidents and 
there'd be less of a need for Anger Management Classes.

Or not.

NASA backed research on this subject bears this out:
* Caffeine, one of the most common drugs consumed by Britons in soft 
drinks, tea and coffee, makes spiders incapable of spinning anything 
better than a few threads strung together at random.

Subject: [sfraves] Angry Revellers Besiege Cop Shop

Over a hundred ravers laid siege to Yarmouth police station last
weekend and attempted to smash their way in, after police seized a
sound system and arrested three people transporting it to a free party.

Press reports said frightened cops barricaded themselves inside as
ravers threw beer cans at the station before retreating to throw a
party in a nearby industrial estate. Police reinforcements in riot
gear subsequently broke up the event, going on to impound 44
party-goers' cars 'as evidence'.

"By attacking the police station, the organisers of this event have
shown a total disregard for the rule of law," Norfolk Deputy Chief
Constable Ian Learmouth told local newspaper the Norfolk Evening News.

"We have seen some really sinister elements tonight, following a
police car back to the station and besieging the station. We will not
tolerate that behaviour. If you are planning to organise an unlicensed
musical event in this county, expect us to turn up, take away your kit
and pursue a prosecution," he promised.

The confrontation occurred two days before BBC TV show Crimewatch
featured a rogue's gallery of revellers wanted following a similarly
violent altercation in Essex last summer which resulted in 64 police
officers being injured (as well as a number of ravers and one sniffer
dog).

Essex police said officers were also terrified as partygoers fought
them with scaffolding poles and bottles, the BBC reported.

"It is no exaggeration when I say many of the police men and women who
were deployed that night feared for their lives. They were faced with
unacceptable levels of violence for no other reason than they were
police officers doing their job," Detective Superintendent Simon
Dinsdale told The Cambridge News.

"The people responsible for that violence are dangerous people and
must be found."

lost all function and dexterity in my right hand and wrist due to nerve

Colbert's series on Wrist Awareness speaks to me on a deeply personal level.

Doesn't hurt, but the Doc doesn't know if it's gonna be permanent.

Too bad i'm not local to you, I got a scrip for vicodin for an unrelated

You dumbfuck Vics and percs are the same fucking thing.

OCs or DIE.

Unless I'm mistaken, they're just different brand names. Percs, vics,
whatever all come in the standard 5mg,7.5mg, and 10mg forms. In any case
they suck because they're polluted with dirty ass ibuprofen. That's why I
prefer ocs, same shit, but without the ibuprofen and about 80mg per as
opposed to 10.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: rant for today...what's yours?

My gf and I of 2.5 years broke up because she wants to move to the state of 
Washington, whether I come or not.  If her and I had an epic bond of 
complete acceptance and understanding, with some compassion sprinkled in, 
I'd move for her in a heartbeat.

But she's moving back home for the same reasons I wanna stay.  My friends 
and my family.

Life kinda sucks right now.  But I feel better in sharing.

love always

Not all the same - in fact, many of those aren't in the same drug schedule. 
All opioids though.

yup.

Moore's Law at work.

As an exercise I pretended that Moore's Law never stops and I asked 
myself where computer  CPU power will be in the year 2107 with today's 5 
ghz machines as the starting point, with a doubling every 2.3 years.

http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=39522
5 ghz * (2^(100/2.3))

It's a 10 *trillion* ghz machine.

That kind of CPU power will be able to do all sorts of tracking shit, 
when it comes to shit.

Hell, the tens of millions of networked10 ghz machines that cost $1k 
apiece that are just a few scant years away are coming to a local PD 
near you and they'll definitely be able to stay  on  top of when, and 
where, you pee.

Among other things....

buh buh baybee u ain't seen nuthin' yet.

bye bye.

It's strange, been injured a bunch this year (broken foot back in March,
no sooner did I get out of the cast to get rearended and pushed into another
car for a case of whiplash, and this week my left eye epithelium decided to
loosen from the cornea), and finding pain meds to be utterly useless.  I've
ended up off the drugs within a couple days and for the eye didn't even
bother asking for anything to take home.  All they mostly did was make me
a little drowsy, but then I'd wake up in the middle of the night, agitated,
when they wore off.  Was less trouble to just deal with the pain.  Not being
able to dance since March was harder than enduring any pain.

Starting to think cybernetic replacements would be a nice option, though.  I
guess technically, the screw holding my foot together does qualify me as
part-man,part-machined. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Ding Dong (another) Witch is Dead... 

THe Evil Empire has lost another leader. 

Alberto Gonzalez is going, going... almost gone.

So, one more liar, one more dissemenator of
instability, one more total piece of shit out the
door. He will have plenty of time to hang with his
buddies:
John ASScroft ( Or... I lost to a dead guy for
governor)
Colin "I knew I was lying but said it anyhow" Powell
Former head of the CIA... forgot his name, but
remember his "Slam Dunk"
Donald "I did it for Nixon too" Rumsfeld
Harriet "Lets throw her out there so Alito won't look
so bad" Myers

All we need now is for Cheney's Heart monitor to get
zapped by a microwave, and for someone to get the
balls to impeach Bush, and prosecute him for war
crimes.

What a great way to start the week.

E

Let's get down to brass tacks here gentlemen. . . How much is there to
*really* say about electronic music?

It's got bass, it mixes well with drugs, it's safe to say everyone here
likes it. . . Anything beyond that goes into the land of petty party drama.

In reference to the original post, until the fucks running the country right
now are out of power we don't have any reason to celebrate. Sure, Gonzales
resigned, but they'll just replace him with someone worse. Remember when
everyone thought Ashcroft was as bad as it could get? Only to hear a few
months ago that he actually had to take a stand defending the constitution
against the man that just resigned? The quality of their appointments gets
worse over time, not better. . . If anything you should be scared of who
they're going to pick next.

My god.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Ding Dong (another) Witch is Dead...

Agreed on the be scared who is next... I thought
Asscroft was bad... but even he wouldn't sign off on
the Gonzalez tactics...

and to fuckwad re: electronic music on SFR.... I think
our civil liberties have more to do with raving in
general than discussing which sub-genre of which
sub-genre you are currently sucking on.

E

PS... should have been labeled SRR... as in strictly
rave related, as the MAN has through its power crushed
the rave scene around the globe.

"No wonder kids grow up crazy," the midget says. "A cat's cradle is nothing
but a bunch of X's between somebody's hands, and little kids look and look
and look at all those X's..."

"And?"

"No damn cat, and no damn cradle."

-Kurt Vonnegut


"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Nothing is different this year. The thing is still all consuming and
ridiculous and best avoided, really. At least there's decent techno
this year at 1:11.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Who's NOT @ Burning Man?

Then you need to lay off the tweek. lol

Of course I may have been the SLIGHTEST bit sarcastic when I said 
that...maybe. Just a little. But not that much, cuz I really think that 
since the burners get discounts off events for wearing their retarded "Mad 
Max Beyond Thunderdome" costumes all year, that there oughtta be some 
parties that charge 'em extra for looking like that.  But I've also always 
thought that giving people discounts into events based on their gender was a 
rotten idea too.

Black Rock City firefighters responded to calls from the event at 2:58 a.m. and took about 23 minutes to douse the blaze, according to the Reno Gazette-Journal. The fire damaged but did not destroy the figure, which is set to be burned on the last day of the festival, on Saturday, the newspaper's Web site said.   No one was injured in the fire, and arson investigators remain on the scene, according to the site.   Calls to festival organizers were not immediately returned.

Then you need to lay off the tweek. lol

Of course I may have been the SLIGHTEST bit sarcastic when I said 
that...maybe. Just a little. But not that much, cuz I really think that 
since the burners get discounts off events for wearing their retarded "Mad 
Max Beyond Thunderdome" costumes all year, that there oughtta be some 
parties that charge 'em extra for looking like that.  But I've also always 
thought that giving people discounts into events based on their gender was a 
rotten idea too.

I think Jeffrodesiac beat you to it. Ghetto house 4eva!!!!

Funk You Burning Man with DJ Funk
Sun. Sep 2 (10 PM) at Rickshaw Stop 155 Fell St , San Francisco, CA

Jefrodesiac's annual party that takes place to celebrate that many merry
pranksters are away at Burning Man used to have a much ruder name than
Funk You. . . but this year's special guest is Chicago's DJ Funk.

RSVP At going.com or its $10

Been having a lot of internet difficulties lately, but had a chance to  
work on the book and I'm reading The Deliberate Dumbing Down of  
America, which is hard to follow but when I soak some of the  
information in, I form opinions, which is good.  At least I think so.   
How have you been?  We should talk more often.  When I get back into  
town I'm going to have a night where I sign autographs so we should  
hang out.  Just kidding about the autographs.  Am I?  I'm not sure.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Who's NOT @ Burning Man?

Why is it never DJ Godfather or DJ Assault? Dj Funk SUCKS. Wone of the worst 
DJ's I have ever seen - even though his track selection is typically bomb.

Watching DJ's Gumbee and Tony Faline from Florida almost kick Funk's ass at 
an event in DC a few years back though...priceless.

this was all i could find. an mp3 of one side of an old tape!  this shit's
over 10 years old, folks, not that ghetto (or as they now call it, "juke")
has changed all that much.

uploaded for your pleasure. enjoy.

Subject: [sfraves] New Live Mix CD

I have a new live mix recording from LOVE LIFE in LA
last Saturday. www.alwayslovelife.com

Recorded live, raw, uncut and unedited... (except for
the fade-in/fade-out)

80 minute continuous mix on CDR
Funky Pumpin' Disco and Electro House Fusion
(tracklist available, just ask..)

Will be available via download soon, but I have CD's
now if you'd like an advance copy.

if you'd like to hear what I do in a funky ass live
party setting, this is it.

Hit me up if you want one and I'll send them out...

No, not quite a spontaneous combustion. The suspect has a history of
public BM critique as well as other borderline behavior. Here's a
slice of his thoughts on the whole BMORG schmorg from a couple of
years back, plus the SF Gate reportage:

"And?"

If you ask 100 people what kind of government is America supposed to
be, 99% of them will tell you, a democracy.  America is supposed to be
a democracy.  But that's a lie.  That's an illusion.  The word
democracy is not written into the Constitution one time, it's not in
the Bill of Rights, it's not in the Declaration of Independence.

The Founding Fathers *hated* the idea of a democracy.  They thought it
was the worst form of government there is, and I agree with them.
Because in a democracy, 51% of the people control 49% of the people.
If you're part of the 49%, you're not free.

America was founded as a constitutional republic.  And in that
constitutional republic, 99% of the people can't take away the rights
of 1%.  You have your rights because you're born with them.  You have
god-given human rights that no one can take away.  The government, the
majority, no matter who you are, I can't take away your rights!

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup


featuring from Los Angeles:

JOHN TEJADA  :  LIVE!

( Palette Recordings . Pokerflat . Playhouse
7th City . Plug Research . Immigrant . ~scape )

DJ, producer, and Pallete Recordings label owner John Tejada is
without question one of the most respected and prolific techno
producers to ever come out of the U.S..  With dozens of singles,
remixes, and full length albums to his credit, his abundant output is
made only more impressive by the consistently high quality of his
musical creations.

Tejada's worldwide in-demand status lands him in SF quite often to
drop his trademark DJ sets of refined, musical techno.  But it is a
rare treat indeed to get to witness him perform all his own material
live, with all gear and no laptops, as he will this month.  Prepare
for a very special evening with a true icon of modern dance music.


plus special guest:

ELI BINGHAM  ( Gourmet . Nightlight . Movim )


and [KONTROL] residents:

NIKOLA BAYTALA   ( Robsoul . Junior Boys Own . S.W.A.T. )
SAMMY D  ( Classic . Buzzin' Fly . Dirtybird )
CRAIG KUNA   ( Concept SF . ESDJCO )
ALLAND BYALLO   ( Leibe*Detail . Floppy Funk )

JOHN TEJADA

Normally associated with his peers in Techno from Detroit, Europe and
elsewhere in the US and the world, John Tejada has embraced electronic music
as a personal frontier, expanding on his formidable resume as a Techno
recording artist as producer and remixer, DJ, and label owner. With dozens
of singles, remixes, some film and TV work and contributions to sample CDs
to his credit, this recent expansion has born a slew of tracks deeply
informed by his uncompromised aesthetic honed over years of diligent
production which finds its roots in Detroit Techno but references a far
broader range of music, both in and outside of electronic music. His
musically formative years were steep in Classical music, growing up in
family of performing artists--his mother a soprano singer and his father a
conductor which then widened to include hip hop, DJing and finally,
electronic music.

Known for crafting a brand of subtle, musical techno, his recorded output
ranges across tempo and genre lines, from chilled out affairs with spacious
arrangements to pulsating, densely layered, deeply energetic tracks that
work magnificently in the hands of DJs as well as on the home stereo.
Earlier on, his music found release on labels such as A13, Multiplex and
Generation R&S. Following on to those successes, he established his own
imprint, Palette, in Los Angeles, in 1996, and has enjoyed years of steady
growth and recognition. The label has served as an exclusive outlet for his
own prodigious output but has recently begun to expand its roster. He has
also continued to record for other labels such as Pokerflat, Plug Research,
Seventh City, Playhouse and others, often in collaboration since 1991 with
Arian Leviste, and alongside these numerous singles, has also produced
albums for Playhouse, Palette, Plug Research, deFocus, Moods and Grooves,
Immigrant and A13.

ELI BINGHAM

San Francisco local Eli B made his DJing debut at legendary '90s techno
weekly Static, before taking up a residency at Sabotage under the tutelage
of the One Trak Mind crew and residents such as Sutekh and Kit Clayton.
Eventually promoting a series of his own events called Sex In Zero Gravity,
with guests like John Tejada and Kenny Larkin, Eli turned to production in
2002.  To date, he has had releases on such labels as Gourmet, Movim, Slow
Motion Sequence, MDEX, and Nightlight Music, as well as international gigs
in London and New Zealand.  His DJing style blends classic techno and house
with an eclectic selection of modern electronic dance.

I claim "ICE LUGE MAN" - he can melt after tons of cool, crisp, top-shelf 
vodka has been sluiced through him.

DELICIOUS.

Or "MARINARA MAN" - not sure how I can do that, but I make a mean sauce, so 
it could happen....

Maybe I'm just dirtier than you fuckers, but food is not the first thing I
think of when I hear zucchini.

Almost. . . The first thing I think of is this charming little tale from the
gay scene in Dallas circa 2001. A friend of my boyfriend at the time was at
home alone late one night and had a compelling desire to shove something up
his ass. So he searched his house high and low, and all he could find was a
zucchini (or a cucumber, one of those elongated green vegetables). So he
takes this zucchini, goes to town with his, has himself a gay old time and.
. . when he's done, he leaves it where he found it without so much as
washing off the shit from his ass that was now surely encrusted on this
zucchini.

So, the next day at dinner time someone in his family passes him the salad
and what's on it but that very same zucchini from the night before. He
skipped the salad that night, but his parents, grandmother, and siblings all
had healthy portions. . .

Since I heard that story the elongated green vegetables have been oh so much
less tempting for me.

Hilly Kristal, founder of NY punk mecca CBGB, dies 

2 hours, 59 minutes ago 

Hilly Kristal, the founder of New York punk rock club CBGB, which helped
make the Ramones, Blondie and Talking Heads stars, has died at age 75, his
daughter said on Wednesday.

Kristal died on Tuesday from complications of lung cancer, his daughter,
Lisa Kristal Burgman, said.

He founded the club in 1973 hoping to showcase country music, calling it
CBGB & OMFUG, for "Country, Bluegrass, Blues and Other Music For Uplifting
Gourmandizers."

But the club drew few country acts and instead became a breeding ground for
punk rock, playing host to the likes of Patti Smith, Television, Living
Colour as well as countless local hopefuls that never made it to the big
time.

"He loved country, but he loved music even more, and as a singer-songwriter
himself, he knew rock musicians needed a place to play their own music," his
daughter said.

Marky Ramone of the Ramones said in a statement, "Hilly was an integral part
of the punk scene from 1974 until his death."

"He was always supportive of the genre," he said. "In an era when disco was
the mainstream, Hilly took a chance and gambled. The gamble paid off for
both him and for us. We are all grateful to him and will miss him."

Johnny Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls, who first played CBGB in the late
1980s, said agents from recording companies often came to the club. "So many
bands would have never have made records unless they came to CBGB," he said.

Kristal was born in Manhattan but his father moved the family to Hightstown,
New Jersey, soon after. He became a concert violinist by the age of 9. In
the late 1950s, Kristal sang in the men's chorus at Radio City Music Hall.

He went on to manage Manhattan jazz haunt the Village Vanguard, booking acts
like trumpet player Miles Davis. He opened a bar that served sandwiches,
such as the Hilly burger, that later became CBGB.

Kristal lost a battle last year to stop CBGB from being evicted. Its last
shows in October featured Patti Smith and Blondie's Debbie Harry. The club's
clothing store, CBGB Fashions, remains open a few blocks from the original
club.

"He wanted the club to survive him," his daughter said. "He is survived by
the fans and bands that played there."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the burned man coverage

Here's the note from Paul Addis explaining the stint, as if it needs explaining:


Hi, folks. This is the *alleged* arsonist/douchebag/attention whore
himself, writing you from Fernley, NV, where I have been chilling out
for a couple of days.

Having read your various comments, a few things should be addressed.
First, this operation was extensively planned well in advance, and the
number one thing to Black Rock Intelligence was that NO ONE be hurt.
If you people actually knew us, you'd know that we have an extensive
background in doing things exactly like this. In fact, we were on the
ground for some thirty minutes before ascent, scoping the scene and
clearing people in order to minimize any possiblity of injury to
others. We were aided by several people who were recruited on the
playa the night of this burn (BRI has no idea who they are, so don't
bother asking).

Second, the operation was planned in conjunction with the lunar
eclipse because Black Rock Intelligence knew that another event at the
trash fence would draw the bulk of lunatics to it, rather than to the
Man. In fact, one of our peripheral operatives aided in getting as
many people to the fence event as possible to help BRI achieve its
goal of zero injuries.

Third, word went out across the playa days in advance that Black Rock
Intelligence was pulling this op. This word continued to go out right
up to the moment that our chief operator began the arduous climb up
the guide wire. As you can all see from the results, BRI performed
flawlessly in this regard.

We could give a fuck less what you all think of us for doing this.
Most of you are newbies who have been drawn in by the semi-religious
nature of the event, or maybe just the easy drugs and easier sex. You
have nothing to offer the event other than your fucking money and
obedience. You spend the rest of your lives in mortal fear of
everything that insurance companies tell you to fear, and pretend that
you're free and clear because you spend four days at a desert
bacchanal where spinelessness is not only encouraged but genetically
replicated for implementation in successive generations. In short, you
are the swine of which Thompson spoke. Get over yourselves.

Some of us live quite well without fear. Doing so requires the
ultimate in what Burning Man used to represent: personal
responsibility and individual liberty. That's all been lost in the
last decade of Burning Man's history. Consider this operation a
history lesson that was desperately needed.

One final note: Black Rock Intelligence has been permanently
disbanded. All other operatives have made the ultimate sacrifice by
swallowing their L-pills to avoid being captured alive. I am the sole
surviving member of BRI and ask that you respect my mourning period
for those who gave their lives so that this operation was a complete
success.

Paul D. Addis
Fernley, NV

Hahah, long live Paul Addis. These corporate fucks've had some shit like
this coming to them for a while. I think it's a crackerjack way to make an
even more crackerjack point.

Subject: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists

That message was so DEAD ON. The only thing I would
add is a definition of what the writer does not
address exactly.... 

It's a phrase I made up when the dead heads lost their
parking lot and shows and started ruining the rave
scene. 

HIPPY CAPITALISM

DEFINED AS: Capitalists using hippy idealism for the
purpose of seperating the idealists from their money
via a mock-display of those same ideals. The HC
usually takes on the appearance of the group they are
extorting. The HC knows the lingo, mind-set, and
culture of the sub-group they are targetting, and to
many, appear to be a bullwark of the cause. Many HC's
have narcicistic tendancies, and fancy the idea that
they are leader of the group, a revered contributor,
and in many cases, also think of themselves as
artistic leaders.

Thats it.

I think it has something to do with a hugely wasteful party being thrown in

more obnoxious than just a plain hippie or a plain yuppie.

Also, the STDs.

What outdoor party isn't wasteful by your definition? "Green Man" is the 
theme for this year, but other than "leave no trace", BM has never claimed 
to be especially environmentally friendly.

Have you ever been? If not, your "seems to be populated" statement is 
meaningless. Maybe it's a generational thing, I assume you're in your 
early 20s and a lot of people attend who are older?

STDs, ha ha.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists

Why? You know - at 1st I was curious about Burning Man, and to some degree, 
I still want to go - I know enough folks who are in deep with the organizers 
etc., and can even go work my ticket off if I want. It's not the event 
itself that makes me not like the whole thing, or revel in things like the 
early torching of "the man". What irks the shit out of me is how absolutely 
cliquey and exclusive the vast majority of Burners (I have come into contact 
with) are - and how hypocritical most are. If I don't get a discount into an 
event because I'm not wearing furry pants and mesh gloves on my arms, why 
the fuck do I have to pay more to get into someplace? What if my "playa 
wear" is just like my normal clothing? That cliquey, exclusionary bullshit 
is so HIGH SCHOOL. Why on earth would I want to go spend a week of my life 
with a bunch of people who are like that? The thing that attracted me to 
raving was the LACK of exclusivity. It was a "come one come all" vibe. 
Burning Man always comes across as a "Come if you act/look just like us" 
vibe. WEAK.

The fact that almost every Burner I know parties like mad the whole time 
they are out there, and come back with tales of massive drug intake, as well 
as all sorts of scandalous sex stories etc. - and these same people are the 
people who say "it's an ART/COMMUNITY event maaaaaaaan - it's not all about 
drugs", makes me fucking SICK. Y'know - if you just like to party like a 
rock-star for a week solid in the desert - good for you, but don't try and 
act as if you are doing some great communal, community minded, forward 
thinking crap. You are getting fucked up in the desert for a week solid with 
your fellow party-fiend friends. Own it. Embrace it - but don't fucking lie 
to me about it when I call you out on it.

For every one Burner I have met that does any art/project minded stuff that 
is eco-friendly or whatever, I meet a dozen who are just out there getting 
messed up and scoping out the half naked day-glo, pixie-costumed massive. 
Out of a "city" of 40K people, I'd bet there are less than 10% that are 
there for any sort of real community minded reason. Unless your idea of 
community is just to get wacked off yer tits and try and get you some 
playa-ass.

Take the vast majority of Burners out of Burning Man, and I'd be way more 
into going.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists

Most of the naysayers are those pretty well familiar with the event
enough to know all the issues and decide for themselves if it's all
worth playing along and wasting resources for one week a year.

The collaborative play narrative co-creation and opportunity to hang
out with old friends for a meaningful amount of time is enough to make
it mostly worth it, despite all the ridiculousness.

That said, the last two years I went to the event looked like this:

2004 - Relationship drama. Art project drama. Spent the weekend
following Bassnectar producer Lorin back and forth from one end of the
playa to another for lack of anything better to do or any decent art
to play with. Could not find any techno. Enjoyed my Indian taco on the
way home.

2004 - More relationship drama. Art project succeeds (being a girl in
distress with propane helps)! Campmates are all too stoned to be
interesting so spend most of the time at Spock Mountain Research Labs
with BORG 2 cohorts making fun of hippies and celebrating our failure.
Best memory: a buddy pees on Paul Fukingmould's tourbus. Brooklyn's
inter-node camp has some minimal techno, but for one night only.
Indian taco express lane to Gerlach...

No outdoor isn't wasteful by my definition. That's one of the reasons I
think they're obnoxious and I try to avoid them. "Leave no trace" is
emblematic of the whole attitudes of burners (or at least the burners I've
come into contact with). They love to try to convince themselves that
they're not causing harm, yet will not hesitate to drive a vehicle that gets
3mpg several hundred miles into the desert to sit and get completely wasted
on drugs (and syphilis!) for a week.

I can't say I've ever been, but I have been aware of it since the mid 90's
(back when it was still a worthwhile [though still wasteful] endeavor in my
estimation) and I've met, partied with, discussed politics with many a
burner and I think I have a pretty good idea of what they're about. Which is
to say, creating a playground for the silicon valley tech heads to use for a
week of decompression once a year. It has nothing to do with community, and
at 350 bucks a ticket (or whatever outrageous sum they're charging this
year), you can rest assured that profit is a motive hiding behind many of
the organizers claims of 'community' and 'organizing.'

I think that about sums it up. A lot of my complaints about burning man
would be alleviated if it were a 'anyone who wants to show up and contribute
can' type of thing instead of a 'give us all your money at the door,
motherfucker' type thing.

Seen?

Solekandi FTW.

I wanna pee on Paul Jokenmold...not his bus...on HIM.

The one reason I ever wanted to go to BM for reals thus far tho - to pants 
him. There were threads a year or two ago about that being a mission - to 
pants him during his set...this is a ddream that needs to be realized.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists

Well, if you think that all recreational travel is to be condemned, 
there's not much to argue. It's a noble position but not one I'm willing 
to take. Those "3mpg" trucks haul gear for dozens of people, btw.

My one personal story relating to your "ticket ripoff" scenario: In '99, 
we picked up a kid in Reno who was hitching a ride to the playa. He had 
come up from Dallas by bus with just a big backpack. He bought a ticket at 
the door, wound up volunteering at the center camp cafe, and they refunded 
him the money for the ticket. He ended up camping with our group for the 
week (30 people that year, 20' truck and all - big hassle, we dropped the 
group and the truck for future years). Maybe this doesn't happen anymore 
though, and had it occurred in 2007, he would have given us all STDs....

I didn't say all recreational travel is to be condemned, just that I find it
obnoxious that people who will scream about 'leave no trace' will then get
into their horribly inefficient vehicles to go romp around in the wilderness
and create havoc for god only knows how much wildlife. Not to mention the
global warming concerns.

I mean, if you want to throw a huge ass wasteful party in the desert, feel
free, I'm not going to try and stop it, but don't go around couching
yourself in environmental values when you in reality have no such values. Or
certainly not values strong enough to prevent you from going on a hedonistic
adventure through a desert that would be much better off without your
presence there.

Like I said I tend to avoid outdoor parties to begin with. I think we have
more than enough unused, wasted space in our cities now that could be used
to throw much better parties than burning man that don't require the
movement of tens of thousands of people into usually pristine wilderness at
the cost of millions of gallons of gasoline and untold numbers of other
resources.

This is true, there are a lot of prissy ass obnoxious fucks in the rave
scene.

Good thing I listen to drum and bass, which is completely immune to
scenesterism.*

HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

*before you asshats start flipping out about that, I don't actually believe
dnb is immune to scenesters, quite the opposite actually, so yes, that is
sarcasm you're reading there. :-)

Yeah, KD Lang isn't the most attractive person on the planet.

I'd do some dirty things to Jaime Lee Curtis, though. Even at her current

Ah, so it's not the consumption you're concerned with, it's that you 
disapprove on aesthetic grounds! Again, I can't argue that.

There is no flora or fauna on the playa, it's a seasonally dry alkaline 
lakebed. Think drywall dust. That's the whole point of holding the event 
there. Here's a fine illustration of the location:

http://pic.templetons.com/cgi-bin/imget?d=brad/photo/bm06/plane&fn=img_7927.jpg

The BLM sets very strict usage requirements, they don't even allow fires 
directly on the ground anymore because it bakes the clay and is too 
difficult to restore. Most of the art cars are pretty darn efficient, ours 
was based on an old Volvo station wagon and could transport 20 people. 
Cargo trucks are more efficient than hauling the same amount of weight in 
passenger cars.

If you want to get technical, air travel is much more environmentally 
destructive than driving several hundred miles for a week's vacation. 
People flying to Costa Rica on eco-vacations burn a lot more fuel than 
people driving to Nevada. It's pointless to argue that one is somehow more 
worthwhile than the other if you're not the person making the decision to 
partake.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists

Pinkko,

You supremely nailed it...everything you state below is exactly why a
number of us list care so much about keep the parties urban and
accessible to those with no yearn to burn and everything associated
with that.

BSP in another post - but there's a lot happening in SF this weekend
without a care to what's going out in the desert.

But because BM does, unfortunately still matter and admittedly shapes
a lot of the tastes and recreational year-round activities in the Bay
Area, we are all kind of responsible here.

Here's where I want to point out the Sapphire Portal project at 1:11.
This joint Brooklyn/Boulder project countered the sentiments of most
minimal/techno heads and wound up bringing what could be the most
signficant techno project to the Playa ever.

Understanding the problem of BM, they're merely creating the
environment they want where it's going to have the most influence on
the masses rather than keeping it exclusive.

I was completely blown away when Dustfish - which is pretty heavy on
the breaks - invited us to bring minimal techno to their camp.

This is all a very good thing, indeed, at least for those of us
painfully aware of the barriers to techno that have existed previously
due to the BM factor.

Fair enough, like I said if they want to throw burning man every year I'm
not going to stop them. It is, as you said essentially a matter of taste
(both social and environmental, I don't like hippie types, or yuppie types,
nor do I like the idea of being out in the middle of nowhere for a week). I
do think, however, that a bunch of people getting together to get fucked up
in the middle of nowhere for a week ought to at least be honest about it and
say that's what they're doing. Instead of claiming to be all forward
thinking and community minded. Which of humanities problems has burning man
ever solved? Or even begun to consider how to solve? It's a fucking party,
get over it.

You're not artists, you're asshats with nothing better to do.

This guy's got the ride idea:

If only they'd go Jonestown, the world would be such a better place.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists

Ah - so it's a "week long party" when people expect it to live up to all the 
forward thinking eco/art-bullshit that everyone says it's *really* all 
about, and when people say it's a week long party, then it's an eco/art 
event.

Right.

And why do a lot of us think ill of Burners?

I'll take "'cuz they're hypocrites" for the win Chuck!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists

I love it when people prove my points for me.

For the record...I think it's quite ok if people wanna blow all their loot 
to get fucked up in the desert for a week - I just want them to admit that's 
what it is. Oh yea - and stop getting discounts at clubs for looking like 
they skinned Elmo.

who this "everyone" is that you're talking about, and I can't speak for 
them.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists


Ok - so a dry alkali lakebed is now "spectacular landscape" ?

The local landfill looks pretty fuckin' sweet if you're trippin' balls too I 
guess....so, sure, I'll give ya that one, lol.

And you can even turn the trash INTO art there! FOR FREE! No $300 tickets!

The next Burning Man ought to be at a landfill...just my opinion. REAL 
interactive art installations!

Haha, you've obviously never been on the playa. It's pretty frickin 
spectacular, no kidding. Hard to beat a desert sunset.

You've probably seen the playa on TV, quite a lot of car commercials are 
filmed in the Black Rock Desert. If it's a car racing on a cracked white 
surface kicking up dust, chances are good it was filmed there.

My contribution on another list in a flame fest with a dude that's 
defending the Burner's that had this guy arrested, for the crime of 
taking the 'think out of the box' ethos at face value, after I told him 
that he if he wanted secure, know what to expect, entertainment, he 
should go to Dinnyland, to which he gave me the 'where will the 
anarchism end?' argument and this is my reply to that:

Challenging questions, I'll have to think on 'em and I'll get back to you..

In the meantime this might help with the answers you seek:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists

Going off the Chron's glowing, aren't those Burners all just so very, 
very, very, splendid and special people, splooge in their pants, fall 
all over themselves over the sheer wunderfullness of The Burn, coverage 
of The Burn, http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/bayarea/burningman/main I'd 
have to go with self-indulgent, spoiled, delusional, affluent, white 
people throwing themselves a party.

Your mileage may vary.

I worked the annual Mike Bloomberg Annual Picnic this year where the 
hedge fund Masters of the Universe blow about $20 mil on a one day 
outdoor party, (this was before the subprime real estate thing hit) and 
The Burn looks just as bad.

Worse actually, since there were plenty of black and other colored 
skinned people besides translucent at Bloomberg, while the vast majority 
of the attendees at The Burn look as white as The Playa. Seriously, it 
looks like a counter-culture Country Club from the 1950s.

Tho' I got to admit, looking at The Faces of Burning Man 
http://tinyurl.com/2no2ed I'd definitely roll the STD dice and try to 
hit as much of that ass as I could.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

A bit long, but I think pertinent.  It gives me something to think =20
about.  Have a nice Friday.  - DF

--

In the US Navy, a captain who runs his ship aground is relieved of
command, no matter whose fault it turns out to be.  In many countries,
if the national team does poorly in the World Cup soccer
championships, the sports minister must resign.  In other countries,
if a train wreck occurs, the transportation minister is automatically
required to step down.  This is the principle of ministerial
responsibility, the overall political responsibility of the head of an
executive department.

After 9/11, the Bush administration did not observe this principle.
Instead, figures like Ashcroft argued in effect that the greater the
disasters that occurred on their watch, and the more numerous their
failures, the more emergency powers they deserved.  Their maxim was
"the more I fail, the more dictatorial powers I deserve to have."
Ashcroft seemed to think that he was entitled to bungle his way into a
dictatorship.  Such an arrangement provides a positive stimulus for
buearucrats to be less than zealous in preventing the visitation of
disasters upon the citizens.  The principle of ministerial
responsibility provides the most rudimentary and the most essential
reality principle for government officials:  the sure knowledge that
if catastrophes take place on their watch, they will be sacked.  In an
oligarchical system like ours, this is absolutely necessary to create
a minimum common interest between security officials and citizens.
The alien neocon notion of martial law abolishes this reality
principle by threatening to freeze the failed officials in power as a
reward for their own bungling incompetence -- or for their treasonous
complicity.

- Webster Griffin Tarpley, 9/11: Synthetic Terror Made In USA

Think about this, George Tenet's  Medal of Freedom, the blowing off of 
the PDB in August '01, Chertoff ignoring news reports of the levees 
being topped, Condi buying Ferragamos and taking in Spamalot on 
Broadway.....

Now think about the head of the Chinese toy factory killing himself 
after the Mattel lead toy scandal broke
http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/08/13/ap4012287.html

Or better yet, the head of their FDA being /executed /by the government 
in the aftermath of the tainted pet food scandal.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/09/AR2007070900689_pf.html

Methinks a different wind is going to blow not soon after the 2008 
Beijing Olympics.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] the burned man coverage and Hippy Capitalists

I have driven through...it's interesting, but I have seen desert sunrises 
AND sunsets all over the southwest while my old band toured (NM, AZ, CO, UT, 
SoCal, etc.) - and I can't imagine the playa sunsets are leaps and bounds 
better than anywhere else...

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: John Tejada rocks an all-gear LIVE set Saturday @ [KONTROL]

Here we go again!  It's going to be a very special night of music
as the always stellar John Tejada drops a rare all-gear LIVE
perfomance (no records, no laptops!) of that melodic yet pumping
techno that he does oh so well.

The Bay Bridge will be closed this weekend, but BART runs all
night, so no matter where you're at, this will definitely be worth
the trip!  Also, with half the city gone at Burning Man, we can
all enjoy the beautiful weather with a little extra room to dance.

One other VERY EXCITING THING!  The amazing Swiss duo
that performed at our very first [KONTROL] event back in June
of 2005 is back!  After rocking the playa at Burning Man, the
awesome Galoppierende Zuversicht (Bang Goes + Styro2000)
will be stopping by San Francisco for what is sure to be a night
people will be talking about for years.  This one's going down
a week from Saturday at an intimate underground location
that must be seen (and heard!) to be believed.  More on this
one soon, but for now... peep the flyer and start salivating.

Now... on with the show!

JOHN TEJADA : LIVE!

DJ, producer, and Pallete Recordings label owner John Tejada is
without question one of the most respected and prolific techno
producers to ever come out of the U.S..  With dozens of singles,

made only more impressive by the consistently high quality of his

for a very special evening with a true icon of modern dance music.

JOHN TEJADA

Normally associated with his peers in Techno from Detroit, Europe and
elsewhere in the US and the world, John Tejada has embraced electronic
music as a personal frontier, expanding on his formidable resume as a
Techno recording artist as producer and remixer, DJ, and label owner.
With dozens of singles, remixes, some film and TV work and
contributions to sample CDs to his credit, this recent expansion has
born a slew of tracks deeply informed by his uncompromised aesthetic
honed over years of diligent production which finds its roots in
Detroit Techno but references a far broader range of music, both in
and outside of electronic music. His musically formative years were
steep in Classical music, growing up in family of performing
artists--his mother a soprano singer and his father a conductor which
then widened to include hip hop, DJing and finally, electronic music.

Known for crafting a brand of subtle, musical techno, his recorded
output ranges across tempo and genre lines, from chilled out affairs
with spacious arrangements to pulsating, densely layered, deeply
energetic tracks that work magnificently in the hands of DJs as well
as on the home stereo. Earlier on, his music found release on labels
such as A13, Multiplex and Generation R&S. Following on to those
successes, he established his own imprint, Palette, in Los Angeles, in
1996, and has enjoyed years of steady growth and recognition. The
label has served as an exclusive outlet for his own prodigious output
but has recently begun to expand its roster. He has also continued to
record for other labels such as Pokerflat, Plug Research, Seventh
City, Playhouse and others, often in collaboration since 1991 with
Arian Leviste, and alongside these numerous singles, has also produced
albums for Playhouse, Palette, Plug Research, deFocus, Moods and
Grooves, Immigrant and A13.

ELI BINGHAM

San Francisco local Eli B made his DJing debut at legendary '90s
techno weekly Static, before taking up a residency at Sabotage under
the tutelage of the One Trak Mind crew and residents such as Sutekh
and Kit Clayton.  Eventually promoting a series of his own events
called Sex In Zero Gravity, with guests like John Tejada and Kenny
Larkin, Eli turned to production in 2002.  To date, he has had
releases on such labels as Gourmet, Movim, Slow Motion Sequence, MDEX,
and Nightlight Music, as well as international gigs in London and New
Zealand.  His DJing style blends classic techno and house with an
eclectic selection of modern electronic dance.
