Is anyone planning on going up tonight after about 10pm from the south
peninsula area?  I have orchestra rehearsal till 10 at De Anza College in
Cupertino and I don't want to leave my cello in the car parked in the city.
I'd be willing to give someone a ride if I can leave my cello at your house,
or I'll ride up with you.  You can reach me at 415-329-8400 x5542 till 6:30
tonight.

Thanks.

Looks like I'll be going alone this time... I wouldn't miss this one for
the world.  First I'll be at Inspirals at Slims (yeah, leave me alone
already, so I like them) and then looks like straight off to 1015 Folsom
afterward.  So if any of  you are doing the same, say hi!  I've got
the dark flipped hair, green jeans, and probably my Morticia waist-knotted
black blouse.

Maybe I'll attempt to telnet to vraves first...

I just got back from the after party (which is still going on). So I'll
give you my reviews of Come/Unity before I end up passing out from lack of
sleep. On Tuesdays, my classes are the worst. I was dead tired to begin
with and I don't understand where I ended up getting all my energy for
Come Unity.  I did take a two hour nap before I went though. I was
surprised how many people were on vrave when I logged off around 10ish and
logged back on around 2. Anyway, I picked up Chris (ccat) and we went to
Come Unity. It was packed. The vibes were definately there, unless it was
Chris's vibes felt because he was showering it everywhere. The first thing
I did was to check out the vrave location. I thought I might run into a
lot of the SFRavers there. (Actually my alterior motif was to get in vrave,
my true addiction).  I saw Stevie on the computer talking to Susie.
Unfortuately she was the only one on. Eventually I saw Mykl G, Derek, Joe
(Doom), Leah, Brian, etc. soon after. It was great to see some familiar faces
and actually  meet some of the people that are on the net. By the way it was
great meeting you all... Garth was spinning from 3-7. He was great! The only
thing I have to comment about Garth was that he would through in some
ambient type music towards the end and I was confused whether or not he
was going to end his set. Well anyway, it ended a little after seven.
Several of us: Doom, Mykl G, ccat, Derek Chung, Geoff White, and me went
out to breakfast. Geoff White gave two guys a lift from the rave. They
came in with Geoff. I remember one of the two guys came with from the rave. He
was yelling some weird things when people were leaving. He introduced
himself as Mad Dog and said it was he's 20th birthday. All I can say is
that Mad Dog and his friend was weird. Apparently when they tried to pay
their check (we sat in different tables from them) they couldn't pay their
check. Plus they really made a mess of their table. After giving them a
dollar and some change, we left. I had to go to class at 10, so I couldn't
go to the after party with Geoff, Mykl, and Joe. But I said I'd stop by
after my class. Around 11:30 or so, I ended up at the after party place in
Golden Gate Park. There was no music and people were just sitting around
talking or eating some junk food. I saw Geoff, Mykl, and Joe and they said
that the generator didn't work, so someone had to go get another one. Then
they finally got the old generator to work, but it ran out of gas. Both
the people who went to go get gas and a new generator came back at the sam
time and the party started up again. I really liked the guy who was
spinning, his name was Gavin. And the second guy dante wasn't that bad. 
What the weird thing was that we saw Mad Dog and Brian again. Mad Dog had
more flowers in his hand and he his legs and feet were very muddy, like he
purposely wen through the muddy areas of the grass.  Well after a while of
listening to music and sitting in the sun, I decided to go home...I have
to write a paper as well as clean my room. Overall, it was a great night. 
I don't know how I'm going to survive tonight, but I'll manage.:):):)

Subject: electric boogaloo



from Tower Record's advertisement/magazine Pulse:

RAVE ON: The premiere this summer of the movie "E - Dancing to a
Different Beat" will mark the most conspicious act thus far in the 
continuing commercialization of rave culture.  The film also marks the
directorial debut of Shabba Doo (aka Adolfo Quinones), who, having starred
in "Breakin 2 - Electric Boogaloo" and "Lambada - Set the Night on fire",
has a lot of experience milking waning pop-culture dance crazes.

Subject: Too many people!


        Last night's Come Unity was probably the best production I've ever
seen at 1015 Folsom ever.  Visuals everywhere were top notch, the sound 
system was great (they did a rather intelligent thing - put all the bass bins
low to the ground and the tweeters high, so they could crank it and the 
danger of blasting people's ears is diminished), and I saw tons and tons of
familiar faces - both sfraves and non-sfravers, and even people I've never
met but seen dozens of times at my favorite raves.  When the sun rose and
the grey light came into the dance floor, there was a great vibe going on,
the best of the entire night.  When the music finally stopped around 7am, 
there was still a packed dancefloor.  Amazing for a Tuesday night.  

        The only down points: I spent most of the time in the chill-out 
bassment working on vrave; the overhead projector setup failed to work
well enough to make it worth the trouble, but the screen was big enough
for three or 4 people to sit around and interact.  There were up to 21
people online at one point in the night; unfortunately most people were
on the dance floor, to other come/unity-ites didn't get a chance to sample
it until only 5 or 6 remained.  I was also pretty tired during the whole
night, so for most of the time my luv phasers were in the holster packed
away... the few times I ventured out to the dance floor it was PACKED, which
made it hard to dance in place and get a groove without having people bump
into me.  They opened the second floor, which was really a good thing; if
they hadn't there would have been a SERIOUS crowd-control problem.  There
were more people there than I had ever seen at something at 1015.  And true
to form, the vibe shot up an order of magnitude when the bars closed at 2
and the bustier-and-suit crowd moved on...

        So to sum up, it was a great event (oh yeah, the visuals and music
in the bassment were terrific!  thanks to synergy visuals and spacetime..)
but not the best overall C/U I've been to.  I really am in NO position to
say how each DJ did since I heard maybe only half an hour's worth of each
DJ.  But definitely worth the effort.... hope the afterparty happened without
incident...

        Brian

p.s. - there's a rumor going around that Markie Mark has joined our tribe...
tres cool...

the techno track that got me into the thing was :P quadrophonia.... and i realized how bad it was as much as i liked it, so i went right to tower records and bought something equally commercial i thought was underground.... ohh welll

and i/m surprised brian thinks danny elfin isn/t bubblegum
i mean the man uses two moods: dark and dank. the music is so formulaic.
who do you want to be today? who do you want to be? i wanna be just like someone on mtv.... well he got his wish after writing one very long song

fantastic evening...destroyed my wednesday, which was spent sleeping
until rehearsal, but what a night!

Good to see all of you again, and very nice to be introduced to so many
nice new fresh faces...especailly good to see Mykl, Bri, Stevie, Leah,
Janella (haven't seen you for a loong time!) and all and all...

good time. Ernie was great, but Simon tore it UP...Garth was great in
the beginning of his set, but I am getting tired of Jeno's 
we are family closing...but his set was pretty damn cool, as usual.  
It was my first come/unity, and I am happy that I was able to make...
it...definitely worth the horrible caltrains ride back to school this morning.
Next time we should all go to breakfast or something...my 7:15 in the
morning Patty melt and salad is just going nutso right now in me stomach..

Well, anyway, the vibe was great, the sound was good, it was a great
cool evening.  It was really my first really good rave this year..I meanm
I like the Wickeds okay, but there is something about having out 18-20
year old friends with us..the energy is better or something...not 
as many attitudes last night...of course it was tuesday night...there was
something glorious about having the place PACKED at 4:30 on a wednesday
morning........long live all of us!!

The rave scene isn't dead at all...it's just waiting until we 
make ourselves rediscover it again...

take care!  good night!!

Hi,

We don't get much more virtual do we?  Too, I was thinking  
that it would be interesting to incorporate a list into  
,e.g. a non-profit corporation.  This way no one person  
bears the risk of a venture as a single person.

Anyway something to get the cyber juices flowing for the  
weekend o' fun and dance and community.

                        CALL FOR ARTICLES
          ARACHNET ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF VIRTUAL CULTURE

              SPECIAL ISSUE: VIRTUAL CULTURE AND LAW

       Issue Editor: James Milles  
(millesjg@sluvca.slu.edu)


The Arachnet Electronic Journal of Virtual Culture (EJVC)
announces a call for papers for a special issue on Virtual
Culture and Law, to be published in June 1993.

Virtual culture is computer-mediated human experience,  
behavior,
thought, meaning, action, or interaction, such as  
electronic
mail, conferences, and journals; information distribution  
and
retrieval; the construction and visualization of images,
representations, or models of reality or worlds; and  
global
connectivity.  The Arachnet Electronic Journal on Virtual  
Culture
is a refereed journal whose purpose is to foster,  
encourage,
advance, and communicate scholarly thought, (including  
analysis,
evaluation, and research) in multiple disciplines about  
virtual
culture.

Papers for the special issue may address any aspect of the
intersection of virtual culture and law, from the  
practical (such
as copyright and liability issues) to the theoretical (the  
law
and virtual communities; computer-mediated communication  
and the
future of law.)

EJVC seeks authors who do not have established publication
records, as well as established authors with reputations  
as
scholars and experts.  All manuscripts will be given at  
least
three blind reviews by a jury of referees.  EJVC uses  
multiple
styles, flexible among articles but consistent within any  
given
article.  Any recognized standard of style shall be  
acceptable;
however, for the Special Issue, either _The Bluebook: A  
Uniform
System of Citation_ (15th ed.), or APA style, modified for  
ASCII,
shall be the preferred style, allowing for creative  
styling if
essential to the integrity of the article.

Each contribution shall conform to the following minimal  
form:

    Articles shall start with an abstract/description
      (< 200 lines)
    Number paragraphs and pages
    Provide internal/in-text citation
    Provide electronic references where appropriate
    Superscripts in text/endnotes ^2^
    Use blank line separators between paragraphs, which
      shall have no indentations
    Provide only substantive endnotes

All submissions must be by electronic mail to James  
Milles, Saint
Louis University, Special Issue Editor  
(millesjg@sluvca.slu.edu).
The deadline for the June 1993 special issue is May 1,  
1993.

I was reminded by the fact that we just missed one, that there is a boat party
put on by Eddie from BulletProof on the last Sunday afternoon of every month.
Let's see, that would make the next one March 28th.  From what I've heard
these are lots of fun, although a bit pricey at $20, not too outrageous for an
afternoon/evening of fun ON the bay.

For some reason (lack of flyering?) this event doesn't seem to make the
calendar, but maybe with some luck this next one will  ;^)

Hey there!

Sorry to bother those of you who don't snowboard, but since I know many
of you do, thought this would be worth posting.  I am selling my old
snowboard.  It's a Burton Free 5 (150 cm) with Flex bindings, and it's in
excellent condition.  No nicks on the bottom, edges are great; I've
probably only ridden it around 15 days total.  This is a great all around
board!  They don't make the Free 5 anymore, the equivalent is now the
Air 5, which sells for about $450.  But I am willing to unload mine
for the amazing bargain price of $200, or (most likely) b.o.  So if you're
interested e-mail me at laurak@leland.stanford.edu.  Wish I could join
you on the sfraves snowboard trip and meet some of you in real life, but
unfortunately I'll be on my way to Sun Valley for 8 days of fun in the
snow.  Yeah, I know, life's rough.  Again, apologies to those of you who
could care less about snowboarding.  Hope to hear from someone . . .

peace and powder,
laura

Subject: Re: Come/Unity

MykL's instant analysis of Come/Unity and the afterparty:

Come/Unity:  solid, excellent music and vibe but definitely not
extraordinary.  Claustrophobia factor quite high on the main floor, despite
the entire
upstairs and basement being open.  The basement "ambient" space was
the star of the show this time, with Jonah (SpaceTime) mixing with great
inspiration, the Synergy video folks (from AfterLife, TAZ, the last Come/Unity)
and best of all live VRAVE connectivity spanning the planet!!!

Marx Meadows:  as close to perfection as you could imagine (after a couple
of generator related delays).  A sonic picnic for a family of 120.  INCREDIBLE
weather, great spinning from Gavin and DJ Dick.  No appearances by authority
figures of any stripe.  A sure sign that spring in San Francisco has arrived,
and a hopeful glimpse into the next six months of future...

memories of an earlier, headier and much larger festival... >>

I just said:

I should have added:

only by C/U's normally transcendent standards.  Of *course* it's extraordinary
to have 300+ pack a dance floor at 6 am on a weekday and allow itself to be
twisted around Garth's index finger.

Color me jaded.  I'll stop now.  ;^)

  Tiamat the Chaos etc. wistfully mentioned the "sonic picnic" for the family 
of 120 in Marx Meadow -- which leads me to wonder when and if these GG Park
events will start up again.  Anyone know?
  BTW: I'm looking right now at a history book that says: "...but suddenly the
monster-goddess Tiamat set out to destroy all the other gods, and to make
herself -- Chaos -- supreme.   A mighty revolution ensued in which all order
was destroyed.  Then another god, Marduk, slew Tiamat with her own medicine by
casting a hurricane of wind into her mouth as she opened it to swallow him...."
  Can this be true?....

Wow, this was the best comeunity I've been to.  I got there at around 1am and
didn't detect any 'tudes.  The vibe was raging.  I love raves where people 
cheer at the start of a new song.  I danced most of the night away
and suddenly it was closing at around 7ish or so.  What happened to all that
time?  Well I was sooo tired and so was every cell in my legs so I went home
and turned the alarm clock for 40min later.  Well 4 hours later, I woke up
as I was swearing to myself for missing that alarm.  A buddy and me rushed over
to the park where there was a good mellow gathering going on.  A few people
brought some young kids who they nanny for, like 2 year olds or so.  There were
3 of them and they were dancing in their little circle - those kids know how to
dance to a good beat!  Once again there were the regular rave dogs that I used
to see at many outdoor raves, if I got their identity right:  there were the 
two dogs that like to chase eachother at high speeds through the dance area and
there was this cute little dog that was the same dog I had to deal with at a 
former outdoor rave when it kept grabbing and running off with our paddleball
ball.  I met many new people with a really pure outlook.  It was a great night/
day.  Wow....

else but I'm not sure who. For those who were not out last year these parties 
were some of the nicest events I had the pleasure to attend. The dance floor is 
outside and there are many different sections to sit and chill, a real nice
venue.

Hope to see you there,

Richard

p.s. Mission Rock is in China basin at 17th and Illinois.

666 RAVE ON: The premiere this summer of the movie "E - Dancing to a
666 Different Beat" will mark the most conspicious act thus far in the 
666 continuing commercialization of rave culture.

Ok, yeah, well this film definitley spells the end of raves... definitely. 

Speaking of doomsayers predicting the end, I think we should form a
fringe cult called the "Branch Ravidians" to take over marx meadow at
Golden Gate park and play loud music and dance (and hold each-other
hostage) continuously until they let us broadcast inane blatherings on
KGO during  commute hours for one week... We should be heavily armed
with Love-Phasers to protect us from mounted police, (and sugar cubes
to make their horses more friendly).

PS: does anyone have a recording of david whatsisface's hour-long radio
talk broadcast in Texas as ransom for release of his hostages? The bits
I did hear of it (broadcast on KPFA) were uh... hilarious... and
obviously made for sampling/cutting-up/putting-into an industrial bob
dobbs meets techno-industrial music-form.

Come/Unity only began happening for me around 5AM (even tho i got there
at 1AM) and rose steadily till closing at 7. Park was the whipped cream
on the pie-in-the sky....

Just how late did the park last? I only made it till 3ish... If there was
a next come/unity, I'd have definitely slept or worked till late and arrived
at 4-5AM to sample the closing vibes and the park-nature-flower-child vibes.

Incredible experience. I feel like I just came back from faraway lands
with tales to tell, and lots of mental-pictures to develop...

  Bringing the dancing star of the movie "Breakin'" to the Rave scene may
be a joke -- but it may bring some good dancing.  Breakin' and Breakin' 2 had
some damn good dance sequences.  Maybe Quinones can make our ravers to be
better dancers than we really are.    :<)

we wandered up to comeunity a little past 2 AM.  we drove by and saw
hordes of people in the street and figured it was going to be a pain
getting in.  we resolved that if we didn't find a good parking space
within five minutes that we'd take off.  my housemate jeff is a good
luck charm for parking though - we found a primo space instantly.

so, we were standing outside, looking at the line, debating whether we
really wanted to deal with it when we heard jeno drop the jon williams
remix of The Trip.  that sort of clinched it, although i don't know
why.  i just have that reaction to hearing my own records played, i
guess.  fortunately, we found a friend who let us cut in line.  even
with that, we didn't get past the hand-stamper until the record was
over so i didn't get to see how the crowd reacted to it.  :(

inside, it was a nightmare - wall to wall flesh, jeno doing a
startlingly lackluster set on a deafening sound system (and me without
my earplugs), and many kids with good fake IDs drinking way too much.

we stayed for about 30 minutes and that's only because we found a
friend that we talked to for 15.

i did manage to run into a few people i knew, even in that brief time.
a crazy ill shout out to leah, derek and brian!

Well, these things are ultimately subjective... but I think
it you didn't like Jeno's set last night maybe you need to
get out and do something else for awhile... Garth was cool
by me too, though I don't understand why he kept killing the
beat and letting the ambient/intro run.  I think people kept
cheering because they thought it meant his set was over.
Oh, and I thought Plastech's set was good too, though that
may not have been part of your subjective rave that evening.

I didn't think the crowd was that excessive, mostly because
I just went where they weren't, e.g. up on the over looking
balconies, up on the stage, down in the chill space.  

Music was good down in the "chill" area, but clearly much
too loud ("So vrave is up again", "WHAT?", "I SAID VRAVE
IS..."). 

Vrave was an appreciated addition... Pat Dote logged in
after his show was over, making a surprise reprise into my
existance after I thought that part of the subjective rave
was over with.  

There's something about looking out over the crowd and
suddenly realizing that you can actually see everyone, that
the sun is about to rise...  

Hanging out at the GG park after party was excellent, though
I was most annoyed to find that my car had been towed away
while I was there.  What, me park in front of a drive way?

GG Park raves start "officially" on March 14th but they have already
unofficially started. as there have been at least two events that I know of.

  A flame war over the virtues (or lack of) of Turbo and Shabba Do in sfraves
has great comic potential; but I decline the gauntlet....
  However...
  Break Dancing had a distinctive set of moves all its own, and had juice enough to pull in other steps from other styles.  Some of the dancing (and dance-
 fighting) scenes from the two films have a lot of style and energy.
  Is there a rave dancing style as identifiable as break dancing?  *Breakin'*
1 and 2 did capture a lot of the mood and moves of the break dancing movement.
If raves have a dance style -- and I'm not sure they do -- but if they do, then
why not let an ace dancer have a shot at putting it on film?

Subject: This week's RAVE guide

Before showing the calendar, let me just say...

		HAPPY 1-YEAR BIRTHDAY SFRAVES!

For those who have been on since the start you have participated in the
creation of a real virtual community, a living organism (borg?) with a
unique psychology.  This past year has been the most intensely wonderful
year of my life and I owe it all to this.  The list has not been without
its low points, but it makes the highs so much more enjoyable.  I thank
all of you who continue to pour positive energy into the list and who
don't unsubscribe at the first sign of negativity but instead set their
luv phasers on stun and turn the situation around (damn, the "luv phaser"
metaphor should be copyrighted!).  The SFRaves community continues to grow,
and my hopes are that we can continue to have a positive role in helping 
to shape the scene in San Francisco.  At the moment 493 people are in one
way or another hooked into sfraves, with about 259 people on the full-time
mailing list.  Let's see if we can make the virtual energies we feel here
translate into real energies at the parties and in our everyday lives.

Anyways, that was my sentimental view of it all :)


Okay, on to the list:

	Friday looks to be a choice between the funkengruvenness of 
Wicked at 1015, which is usually great but likely to be crowded and
hot, or Future Forum.  I'd go for Future Forum - Mark has been talking
to the head of the permit department for SF and has been cleared to
have parties of around 300 people, so it _won't_ get busted this time.
The DJ lineup is uncertain at this point, but it sounds as if Thomas
and Spun will be there.  Also there will be the Planet 6 crew and 
Spacetime doing their cybernetic jam session.  Also at 1015 that night 
is Martini's - it's more along the lines of a club atmosphere than party, 
but SFRaver Eric Lacy is spinning there from 11pm - 1am, and he's really 
worth checking out. You could also hit Smiling Thru - it starts at 4 am 
and goeson well into morning.  I went last weekend and it's a lot of fun, 
it just needs more people there to make it truely great.  :)

	Saturday night you have a choice between Cool World and I Magi
Nation - I would recommend I Magi Nation highly.  It's gonna be at the
same place in the north-east bay area where the last Basics was held
(I _think_ it's the Vallejo civic auditorium but I'm not sure).  It'll
be 18+, which is a good thing in these days of the retreat-to-the-clubs
mentality of some promoters :(  Vrave will be there too, this time 
providing a direct link with a "sister rave" happening in Vancouver that
night too.  Richard Sun has an impeccible reputation - the last I Magi
Nation back in September went really really well.

	Have fun!  Oh, and after last night's Inspiral Carpets show, I
am gonna start wearing earplugs to every music-related event I go to.
I haven't gotten my full hearing back yet, and I wouldn't be able to LIVE
without my sense of sound!!!

	Brian

  Well, there was one party missing on friday night.  It sounds pretty cool, 
although I don't know much about it.  Anyway, the dj line up look very attractive.

   Jonah, if anybody hasn't had the pleasure to hear him, is incredible.  He
is one of the members in SpaceTime.  Shobhan I also think has the potential to
make crowds go nuts ;^)     I need not mention Spun.

   It just puts a smile to my face.

Yo Tai, you read my mind.  I've been waiting to post this flyer "late" to
keep it underground.  

Shobhan played a f*cking brilliAnt  acid / trance set at TAZ a couple weeks
ago.  She's highly recommended.   Jonah was dj-ing after Terence McKenna, and
I agree he's well worth hearing too.

I had several mesages yesterday asking questions about Mission Rock and so here
are few further details. Mission Rock will start tonight after 9.30pm and go 
until 2.00am although hopefully the permits will be obtained to allow it to go 
later before the summer comes since it will be going every week from now. The 
organisors think since the Wicked late night is going on that most people will 
go to that anyway since its the same family and all that. 

Have fun,

Peace,

Richard

i think maybe the opposite is true.  i mean, jeno playing *paradise
organisation*?  this just isn't in sync with the jeno i know and
love...

if i hadn't got out in a few months and didn't know that every dj in
the world is playing the fuck out of that record, i probably wouldn't
have had the reaction i did.

Actually, Jeno was the first DJ I ever heard play that...

You're right, though, it is getting a bit dated for him.

KTVU Discovers Raves!  A recent KTVU newscast found reporter
Bob MacKenzie in an ugly sport jacket, taking a camera crew into the
insidious "underground rave scene" to explain the mysterious world
of "sex, drugs, and techno-pop," a topic that was timely, oh, about
two years ago.  MacKenzie got to the bottom of his story by cornering
two poor kids, Kirby and Dave, whose lives were reduced to the
credit, "Rave Attendees."

Both Jeno and Garth have been playing this constantly since before
New Years.  I guess it's a hit or something.  You can't deny it's still a
crowd-pleaser.

Yes, this is definitly true. J/G have been playing in SF for about two years 
now. They definitely are the X brand of rave DJ's. A ?guarenteed? purchase
of an mind blowing expereince -- but only sometimes.

Agreeing w/ doom I  think it is wise, but can be risky to break out of
the J/G paradigm. Check out other DJ's for a while then come back to them. You
will notice that the music and mixes show no change. Changing will not only
give you a breath to groove to other DJ's, but to also understand the variety of 
music that's out there. I'm mean you can't possibly beleive that J/G play ALL
the BEST music.


Don't just stick with what you know, learn, learn, learn.


Eric

Subject: KEYBOARD Techno article (sigh)
To: sfraves@soda.berkeley.edu

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]


The April issue of Keyboard has an article on "Techno".  It is long, somewhat
informative, extremely opinionated, and very disturbing.  I've typed in some
excerpts here for yopur entertainment.  I may be writing a letter to the
editor to respond to some of the more ludicrous points of the article, but
I'm not sure I would even know where to begin, or whether I should even take
this article seriously, considering how amazingly idiotic it is.

	Synth-Rock Apocalypse?
	Disco With Smart Drugs?
	The Next Wave?  The Last Rave?

	TECHNO

	Catch The Buzz.  Eat The Beat.
	Tune In, Turn On, Boot Up.
		by Mark Dery

	Techno.  The name sounds at once monolithic and impersonal, the acronym
of multinational conglomerate, and toylike, as in brightly colored plastic Lego
blocks.  It is retrofuturist, heading in opposite directions at the same 
time: forward, to the seductive dystopia of Blade Runner's Los Angeles, 2019,
and backward, to the psychedelic utopia of the "Summer of Love."  At its best,
itextinguishes the individual ego in the all-consuming beat, a sensation 
somewhere between orgasm, Buddhist nirvana, and the momentary blackout of a 
fighter pilot pulling G's at supersonic speed.  At its worst, it pummels the 
brain to mush with its locomotive rhythms and monorail melodies - melodies as 
enjoyable as a car alarm at four A.M., and not nearly so musical.

{history of house music scene up to the crackdown in England deleted.}

	The Triffid spores have since taken root in California.  In Los Angeles
and San Francisco, acid culture cross-pollinated with the traditions 
represented by Haight-Ashbury and Silicon Valley to create what P-Orridge calls
 "hyperdelic" culture.  Others have dubbed this emergent movement "cyberdelia,"
and its members have been called "zippies", defined by Encyclopedia Psychedelic
a as "a combination of a '60s hippie and a '90s technoperson."

[Anyone who has seen "The Day of the Triffids" knows that the analogy is not 
complimentary.  I personally have never heard the term 'zippy' before, except 
with the comic strip Zippy the Pinhead. -L]

{typical lame description of a rave deleted.}

	Though the underground press has already conducted the last rites for 
rave culture, techno may very well be the Next Big Thing.  In fact, premature 
reports of a genre's death in cloisters of cool are often a sure barometer 
that it is about to be found, alive and well, in the maintstream...

...But Tony Fletcher, writing in Spin, sounds a cautionary note. "For all its 
newfound popularity, techno looks destined to stay underground in the U.S.  
Dozens of 12-inch are released worldwide every week, but few of the producers 
and musicians - there is usually no band - use the same name twicel they form 
short partnerships, release a couple of tracks, and move on.  None seem worried
about fame and fortune; the 'image' of the music is transported from the 
music's creator to its consumer, who, when dancing... becomes a star.  It's a 
revolutionary concept, but a record company's nightmare."
[...]
	Techno is the end of natural law in pop music: the end of harmony, of 
melodic development, of album-oriented marketing, of live performance...of the
 star, of message, of meaning.

[The rest of the article takes on a truly horrible twist. This is easily the 
ugliest distortion of raving I have ever come across. Brace yourselves.  -L]

	A rave, to use black leather theorist Hakim Bey's term. is a 
"temporary autonomous zone," a pirate utopia, a centrifuge in which social 
gravity is artificially suspended, like the student rebellion in Paris in 
1968, a group grope, or Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  Or a lynch mob.  Because 
the suspension of mores and norms that permitted Woodstock also created, in 
the flash of a knife, Altamont; the road to utopia can end in Plato's Republic
or Jonestown.  Raves, which address the utopian yearnings of cynics and true 
believers alike, transcend societal strictures by subsuming the individual 
into the amoebic mass, a technique equally useful in the generation of
communitarian "families" and teenage wolf packs, out for a night of wilding.  
Heads a Love-In; tails, a Two Minutes' Hate, one of the orgies of loathing in 
Orwell's 1984.

[He digs up the following quote from a "young raver"] 

	"We're not wearing fucking daisies in our hair and all walking around 
shouting 'karma fucking peace man.'  Fuck that.  We like the violence, we like
getting off our heads, we like the dancing, the sweat."

[This was the only time the article ever referenced input from anyone 
who actually goes to a raves.  Not what I would call a fail representation.
But wait, it gets better. -L]

  	"Getting off our heads": The obliteration of rationality, and endgame 
played by the anarchic and avant-garde...was, ironically the avowed goal of 
National Socialism.  Tha anti-rationalism of Nazism is evident in the book-
burnings, gobbledygook Teutonic primitivism Then, too, the hypnotic effect of 
drumming has proven useful in deranging the senses, switching off the reasoning
mind, since time immemorial.  It is not without significance that Joseph 
Goebbels, the Nazi minister of propaganda, frequently referred to Hitler as a 
drummer.

[Wow, Hitler with a drum machine, can you just imagine the groovy
beats? -L (desperately trying to keep a sense of humor)]

	This linkage of electronic dance music and Nazism is admittedly 
alarmist.  Even so, the techno aesthetic cannot be viewed in a vacuum. It 
lives on contested ground, bordered on one hand by the skinhead rockers in 
Germany who sing...[inane lyrics deleted. -L] and on the other by cyberdelic 
ravers who have negotiated a detente between ecotopian longings for a 
prelapsarian paradise and cyberpunk's unshakable faith in the liberating powers
of street tech.
	Techno, claims Reynolds [author of Blissed Out: The Raptures of Rock],
signals "the death of the Song, to be replaced by the...unresolved, infinite...
track; the brain-rotting vortex of quick-cutting in video and TV; the
supersession of narrative, characterization, and motivation by sensational
effects.  Blip culture means the death of sequential, linear thought, an 
erosion of people's ability to plan and manage their lives.  There is only a
NOW that is either blissed-out or dreadful."
	Sometimes, it is both.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
So there it is, another fine example of media mutilation.
The rest of the article covers LFO, Orbital, T99, The Orb, Third Eye,
and The Shamen.  Zieg Heil!, er, I mean, Rave On!

  And now, to Marin county, where the Pacific Sun announces on the cover:

  The article itself isn't all that bad, if you overlook the slightly
condescending tone and "we've certainly got *their* number" attitude.  But
there is a side bar to the article, a quotation from the *Willamette
Week*, that reads: "Fifteen dead in the last two years.  The victims?
Devotees of England's Rave counterculture."  The article concludes: "But
given the right mix, rave rhymes with grave."
  I'm still mulling over that phrase, "Given the right mix."

Ok, I imagine that I am not the only one who will be inflamed enough to respond,
but here goes anyway.. Didn't we leave "Techno" in the dust a while ago? I will
assume that house as a whole is being talked about here, I guess...

I wish that these self proclaimed authorities would stop assuming that their
word is gospel, or at least that those publishing stuff like this would
try to get an opposing viewpoint. I believe that house music/mixing takes
the concept of 'song' to a higher level, where tracks stand alone as a
whole, but when mixed become part of an infinitely complex structure - something
that is a good subjective experience (mix tapes?) but an even better
interactive experience. This experience involves not only you, but the
individual controlling the music, and everyone else in the 'house'. Since
when did a fucking rock critic know dance music from a hole in the ground?
Friends, set luv phasers to 'funkify' and fire when ready! If anything, I'd
say being able to get into a groove and stay there all night is a pretty
amazing thing for us 'blip culture' TV zombies, eh? Ok, put away the luv
phasers. I think that it is time for the luv jackhammers.. hee hee...

i don't agree with Mark Dery at all, but i do believe that many people
in the san francisco rave scene are ignorant of the rest of the
world's attitude toward raving.  maybe it's the exceptionally nice
weather all the time turning us into hippy peace freaks, maybe there's
another reason, but san francisco is decidedly *different*...  the
music played at raves in just about every other city in the world is
hard, fast and relentless.  no happy melodies, no calls for "unity".
fortunately, just as breakbeat was becoming endemic, san francisco
turned away and embraced progressive house, giving us gentle anthems
like "passion" and "nush".  but while we were holding hands and
getting lovey-dovey, everyone else was listening to "death is my

Ah good, now we'll get some balance out of Mr Dery (who wrote a really
dumb piece on industrial "cyberpunk" music too.  I don't know why
Keyboard employs this guy.)

he even phrases the positive stuff in terms so obscure as to be mostly

the best of both worlds and he can't bring himself to admit it.

shit, i'm annoyed.  think i'll write a letter to the editor as well.

This made me laugh out loud.  As I'm sure Fred H.  will attest to, WW
is a totally dippy rag, kinda like SF Weekly on stupid pills, but even
more like the pink section of the chronicle.  I used to work for one
of the editors as a writer, and let me assure you, she wouldn't be
able to tell a rave from the club scene in 'Basic Instinct'.

The only decent music scene paper in Portland is PDXS, IMHO.

Feh.  Unfortunately Keyboard is a respectable mag with a good track record
and not usually prone to the equivalent of journalistic 'wilding' (whatever
that is).

To each their own, but this stuff is ridiculous.  Did they run these kinds
of articles in 1980 about how the Clash led inevitably to the rise of the
NF?  No, of course, not, even though the street scene in London led to
both of those phenomena.  Another example of what is rightly called in
the UK 'wanking journalism.'

Willamette Squeak, I call it.  I know their folks well.  As a yuppie ex-
'alternative' rag, it's not bad, although the Guardian and SF Weekly among
others beat it hands down.

PDXS is the favorite toy of a former WW writer and has had a couple of
interesting articles and a few amusing columns but not much to nosh on.
The really great music paper in town is Paperback Jukebox, although it
focuses more on the hardcore/thrash scene than I am interested in.

I know Tim a bit and his column is always fun, although I hardly have
the same musical likes and dislikes.  

The Blue Gallery was the site of two memorable events: the flag burning
performance which drew TV cameras, right wing wackos and motorcycle club
members, and the most recent Poi Dog Pondering performance which ranks
as one of my ten best musical moments of all time.

Well, as far as yuppie ex-alternative rags go, I guess you have a
point. :-)

I (heart) Satan is always good, especially since Tim Brooks, the
former owner of one of Portland's true cool places to go (tm), the
unfortunately defunct Blue Gallery, writes it.  

I went to my first acid house party there a few years ago.  Ahh, the
memories.

well, i would like to add that we should consider the connection between
tekno and fascism. it's not as  far fetched as it seems. when there
is this 'melting' of social norms lotsa of things can come out. i can
see the 'progression' : punk, industrial, tekno. this steeping in
esthetics of doom and distruction make perfect environment for fascist
esthetics which worship destruction and violence - hence our ugly 'cousins',
the nazi skinheads ( 'descendent' from punks). so we are 'playing' with
dangerous forces here when we release the unconscious ( 'my dinner with
andre' touches on this too.) we gots to be careful!    i see the way to
'guide' the trip along this chaotic surface towards constructive attractors
to consist in adding in the 'love'
component, so lacking in punk, industrial , tekno. i think that's our
vaccine against embracing fascist esthetics. commnents ?

When I suggested that I thought that if you were unhappy
with Jeno's set, "maybe you should get out and do something
else", I was kind of hinting that you might be getting jaded
with raving, and you should, like go to the movies, go
hiking, stay home and read or something.  It kind of seems
weird to me that a lot of the hard core here don't seem to
do anything besides go to raves.

What's interesting is that Eric interpreted this as a
suggestion that you should check out some new DJs.  Well,
fair enough, I guess that might help if you're getting tired
of Jeno...

Anyway, I guess Jon was saying that the "problem" is with
me, in that I haven't heard Jeno enough to realize he was
being uninspired.  This is probably true from one point of
view... but who do you think is a bigger part of the
audience?  How many people out there do you think can name
any of the tracks Jeno played?  When the place is packed,
the sweat's coming down the walls and the energy is flowing,
why should Jeno even consider doing something different?

Subject: a few words about...

Well I just had another wonderful night of raving, Wicked was wild
and great as usual.  I saw alot of the Family, Garth played a brilliant
set and the vibe was INTENSE in the morning around 6-7.  Went to the 
end-up after and began to look around me in the morning light...
I didn't like what I saw.

Now some of you won't like what I'm about to say and some will
call me self- rightous or what ever but I'm going to say it anyway.

	THE ABUSE OF CRYSTAL IS DESTROYING THE SCENE

The use of this drug will bring it down quicker than any government
repression or hollywood commercialism.  It will destroy it from
within.  People get mean, they stop caring about others and themselves.

Speed kills the Vibe.


There, I said It.

I'm ready to take the flames.

 I'm not posting to flame - just to add my vague recollection from hippie
history - didn't speed have it's negative effects on the Haight-Asbury 
scene? People were using uppers to give them more energy to do what they
needed to get done, but the speed became an end in itself. Then, to escape
the bad hangover from speed abuse, people began doing heroin. Can any of
the older SFRavers confirm/deny/add to this?

 I've never been a fan of uppers, except coffee and chocolate. I never had
a bad experience with stronger stuff - in fact , I thought I felt too
powerful ( a la Superman ). Therefore, I didn't trust it. 

 Personal theory: Participants in any scene that "requires" the use of an 
external tool ( like drugs or music or computers ) , must eventually work
out a way to be a part of the scene without dependence on the external
tools. There must be an internal change, leading to greater personal
freedom.

 ( I wish I was as wise as a god - then I'd be able to solve everybody's
   problems )

 ( Of course, maybe the cosmic joke is that everybody's problems can be
   solved if they were no longer human ... )

This is exactly what I'm talking about. Speed is like a credit card
It doesn't give you more energy, It just let's you "borrow".
Eventually you have to pay.

I'm not saying to people don't use this substance, there is a time and a
place for everything.  Personally, I'd rather see a raver "Do a bump" if
they have to drive 100 miles to get home after raving all night and they don't
think they can stay awake, than get in a car crash because they fell asleep
at the wheel.  But the consistant and habitual use that is starting to take
place is beyond that us ae a tool (as all substances should be).

I for one don't and will never use the stuff, but "I've been there"
so I feel that I can talk knowledgeably about it.  I've seen some
friend's personality change significantly in the last couple of weeks
due to the use of crystal and it worries me.  These people are not bad
but they are getting "hard" and desperate and they are taxing their immune
systems to no end.  I think larry is right on, once a "tool" becomes a
"crutch" it's all over.

Subject: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier

I thought this might be of interest to a few of us SFRavers, given the
recent threads on privacy, virtual culture and the law, etc.  This is
taking place TOMORROW (Sunday), and I'd say there's an 80% chance I'll
be there -- I'd encourage as much SFR participation as possible.

------------  QUOTED FLYER FOLLOWS ------------

        Jacking In:  A Monthly Series on Cyberspace Literacy presents:

        Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier

        Computer and telecommunications technologies hold great
        promise for individuals and society.  Increased access to
        information can enhance commerce, political participation,
        community development, and public health and education.

        But, between activities of questionable legality and the
        countermeasures taken by private parties and law enforcement
        officials, these technologies are raising fundamental questions
        about privacy, property, and our freedoms of speech and assembly.

        Join us for an evening of provocative presentations by:

        BRUCE STERLING, author, journalist, editor
        MIKE GODWIN, Electronic Frontier Foundation
        JOHN DRAPER, a.k.a. Cap'n Crunch, reformed cracker

Subject: RE: techno faschism jism


Hello boys & girls,

I picked up a copy of an LA rave zine, I forgot what it was called cuz I thru
it away already.  It seemed to be a marriage of the house & hip hop scenes. 
Therefore, it had a lot of angry hip hop attitude in it:  full-page ads of rap 
artists giving that 'I'm really trying to be a mean motherfucker' look.  But
what SHOCKED me is that there is a ravewear/skatewear ad in there which shows
a guy on the ground with a red splotch on his back indicating a gunshot wound
and two guys next to him who are running away, while in the foreground is a guy
in a car holding a shotgun.  It's just a gross ad and I guess it says something
about the advertisers who want to glorify something like that.  I thru the mag
away after seeing that.

On a different note, I'm leaving San Francisco for good around March 15.  I'm
driving across the country to end up in Manhattan's lower East side 
temporarily.  It was fun being part of the SF rave scene and sfraves.  Raving,
and the 'vision' I had during Let Freedom Rave changed my life - no joke.  The
scene here is very nice and I'm gonna miss it but sometimes progress requires
change and who knows, I might find/create something just as nice elsewhere.
There's gonna be big changes on Earth in the upcoming years including this one.

Spread the vibe,

TAXI

i'm definitely into that.  i haven't really *raved* in a long time.
sure, i hang out at clubs where they play techno and i did even drop
in on comeunity but i haven't been in Rave Mode for a while now.

nah, problem's not with you.  problem's with me.  i think anybody in
the dj'ing/techno-music-producing biz gets jaded pretty quickly.  and
i've been going out an awful lot.

i also realize that using paradise organisation as an example was a
bad idea.  the one song that really made me go "who is this?  this
can't be jeno" was the infinite wheel - that song is old by any
definition.

on the other hand, my roommate just came back from the FMR and he said
that jeno was incredible - he didn't know what the fuck was happening
at comeunity - "it's like a different guy completely!"   so saith
jeff.  here endeth the lesson.

Hi fellow ravers!

Mykl asked me to let everyone know when I was going down to SF so's we can 
all get together and grooove!  Well, I and I and part of our tribe (about 
four other members) will be heading down to the Bay Area on March 20 to 
RAVE!!!.  There is no other item on our agenda eXcept to connect with our 
vibe sisters and brothers down there.  

Perhaps someone can suggest a place where we could all meet on Saturday, 
March 20!  If not on that nite, we will be there for a whole week.  A couple 
of the sisters coming with us are under 21.

We are eXcited!  And completely psyched to be going there.  I'm looking 
forward to meeting all the sfravers that can make it out.

Peace, Love, Harmony To You All!!!

	My friends from Germany said that at some of the raves there, they
	do that practice where they select the weirdest looking people
	in line to be let inside.  They told me that people wear vacuum
	cleaners on their backs and gas-masks on their heads!!  I don't know

	My friends from Germany said that at some of the raves there, they
	do that practice where they select the weirdest looking people
	in line to be let inside.  They told me that people wear vacuum

You don't need to leave your room.
Remain sitting at your table and listen.
Don't even listen, simply wait.
Don't even wait.
Be quiet still and solitary.
The world will freely offer itself to you.
To be unmasked, it has no choice.
It will roll in ecstasy at your feet.

        Was something of a drag... it started off well with Future Forum.  
Sorry you couldn't find it, gdpasquinelli, it was pretty good, but small
(which is probably why you couldn't find it).  The crowd was younger than
most I go to (still the average age is well above me), but they seemed a
little more mellow about everything.  The DJing wasn't outstanding but it
was certainly smooth.... what made the event was the sheer amount of STUFF
there, all brought in by various people; Planet 6 and their groovy jamming,
Synergy and their trippy visuals, Bones and moonpup in the basement,...
it definitely had a warm friendly atmosphere.  At least it was until the
nitrous tank showed up (ack :(  )...

	Saturday night I was all set up to go to Ambient Temple of Imagination;
I've talked to Richard Sun before at length, and was expecting an event high
on the vibe and high on the trancedental aspect... and bringing Vrave to it
would have been the icing on the cake.  I was excited to find out it would
be at the Richmond civic aauditorium, since that meant it wouldn't have the
atmosphere a lot of the clubs tend to have and I wouldn't have to scamper
to get my friends in. I was gonna arrive early to set up the computer but
was delayed by an hour to pick up a friend by the airport, so I didn't make it
to the place with said friend until about 11:00 or so... 

	I decided to leave the computer in the car until I was sure about the
space. I started to worry as I approached when I saw youngsta's nothing but
youngsta's, not necessarily ones who'd be attracted to an event whose main
performance of the night was a set by Iaiocore.  Then the music started to
sink in... loud fast hip-hop-break-beat, the kind I haven't been into in ages.
It finally sunk in when I walked to the front, saw fifteen cops, and three
meaty guys with... you guess it... "Cool World" badges :(  I had stumbled
into a Cool World!  Calgon take me away!  :)  They were charging a flat $20
at the door, unlike the $10 Richard said he would be charging.  I felt...
betrayed.  Not that the event can't be cool and people can't have fun at cool
worlds, but it's just not my scene (the smell of fresh $20's was everywhere,
and I don't just mean the greenbacks).  So anyways I left as soon as I came.
The onther things that were possible that night were Groove Kitchen, which
was 21+, and Get Down Get Down, which has a dodgy track record, so my friend
from Boston and I called it quits and drove home.

	On the way we stopped by Berkeley Marina to show him what a great
outdoor rave site it is.  As we pulled into the parking lot, we heard a
voice through a megaphone: "Please do not park, the park is closed".  I
turned around to see a Berkeley Police Department vehicle sitting behind the
bushes.... so I guess no FMR's there for awhile. :)

	Last night I had to skip on the FMR because a Computer Science project
due today had to be done (and still hasn't been completed).,  How was it? Was
it really down at Bonny Doon?

I'd like to third this.  Not only do I know people this has happened to, but
I've experienced it as well.  I think, in general, that all crutches are bad,
but some are easier to "depend" on than others.

friday: nothing
saturday: nothing

according to my roommate, the FMR was indeed at bonny doon and he said
it was GODLIKE.

i contemplated stopping by on my way to work but if it turned out to
be great i probably would never have actually made it in to work and
that would be a bad thing.

The Full Moon Rave was wonderful (the few hours that I could stay). Garth spun
a really good funky, bouncy, happy set and the vibe was alive and well.

This was a welcome remedy from I Magi Nation (alias Cool World, which should be
known as Frigid World) on Sat night.

Anybody stay for the whole thing?

it was a strange weekend. fri. i went to wicked. it started pretty well, but
at some point around 4 or so i found that i could not get/stay with the
grove of the dj. he would put something down, i'd get into it and then he'd
change it too 'quickly' for me. interestingly, taxi felt similarly. so
i left by 5 am or so.
fmr. it was at one of my favourite locations. there were some technical
ptoblems. so the muzick did not start until about 4 am. at first there
was tremendous energy and excitement. gradually things seem to lose
focus and i felt rather disconnected - i had helped my friend move sun.
so i figured i was too tired. but, no, often times i come tired
to a rave and get energy from the place and the people there. so, i
realised that i got very little eye contact. maybe that was it. i don't

>>due to the use of crystal and it worries me.  These people are not bad

I wholehartedly agree!! I've been involved with the "scene" in L.A. for
about 2 years now and I've seen it change in mood and tone and I think
crystal has alot to do with this change. While I can't be considered an
"old-timer", I was involved when the vibe was truly good.  This of course
corresponded, in part, to the fact that the E was exceptional back then. 
When the E started to turn to shit (at least down here) alot of people
turned to crystal.  BAD MOVE!  The vibe turned increasingly hard, paranoid
and hateful.  In fact Doc Martin has taken loads of shit over his stand
agaist this kind of drug use. Some afterhours I've been to might as well
have been biker bars for the amount of crystal being done and alcohol being
consumed.  gross.

I hope SF stays pure, the events i've been to there have been truly
spiritual at times.  it's nice to know that SF hangs in strong with the
good vibe.  Don't allow what happened to L.A. happen to S.F.

so you all know about casey's afterparty called SMILIN' THRU that
happens at the oasis on saturdays from 4 AM to noon.

this saturday, my roommate jeff headed on over there with robbie
hardkiss and a few others before it actually opened to play some
records on the system.

while they were there hanging out, some guy who got thrown out of the
club on friday night returned with some friends and a handgun and blew
four holes in the bouncer's chest.

needless to say, the party didn't happen.  it was moved to the DNA.

just thought i'd mention it.

Date: Mon, 08 Mar 93 17:44:41 -0800
From: "Niels P. Mayer" <mayer@netcom.com>


Whatwith the news of I Magi Nation being Cool World, i decided that it
would be cool&groovy if any of us w/ inside information could add
warnings about potential mis-raves to the calendar. Sort of like a
consensual public kill file against bogus rave promoters (e.g. KKKool
World, etc). Now I'm not saying to delete the entries from the
calendar, rather, have a listing at the beginning of the calendar for
any inside info we might glean: voicemail number being the same as some
other large org; promoter who works w/ some other large org. etc.

Currently, I seem to be applying a distance/hassle kill-file to my
raving -- there would have to be promises of an ever-lasting scintilla
of pure joy to get me to drive all the way to Satan Cruz or Richmond...

PS: Those of you that don't like Sharons need not worry no more -- 
someone told me Halim got busted for something nasty. Don't know
anything more about the subject.

PPS: Weekend report -- no raving whatsoever. Though I kinda wished I
had gone to the FMR, I was not willing to risk a drive to santa cruz
just to find out that it got cancelled or delayed till 4AM. I guess
I'll use the excuse of recharging the old Love-Phaser for the
conjunction funktion at Connection.

Subject: add-to-calendar -- rave-kill-file?
Date: Mon, 08 Mar 93 17:44:41 -0800
From: "Niels P. Mayer" <mayer@netcom.com>


Whatwith the news of I Magi Nation being Cool World, i decided that it
would be cool&groovy if any of us w/ inside information could add
warnings about potential mis-raves to the calendar. Sort of like a
consensual public kill file against bogus rave promoters (e.g. KKKool
World, etc). Now I'm not saying to delete the entries from the
calendar, rather, have a listing at the beginning of the calendar for
any inside info we might glean: voicemail number being the same as some
other large org; promoter who works w/ some other large org. etc.

Currently, I seem to be applying a distance/hassle kill-file to my
raving -- there would have to be promises of an ever-lasting scintilla
of pure joy to get me to drive all the way to Satan Cruz or Richmond...

PS: Those of you that don't like Sharons need not worry no more -- 
someone told me Halim got busted for something nasty. Don't know
anything more about the subject.

PPS: Weekend report -- no raving whatsoever. Though I kinda wished I
had gone to the FMR, I was not willing to risk a drive to santa cruz
just to find out that it got cancelled or delayed till 4AM. I guess
I'll use the excuse of recharging the old Love-Phaser for the
conjunction funktion at Connection.

Subject: FMR


Wow, FMR was so amazing.  This ranks up there with one of the best FMRs I've 
been to.  Finally left at 4pm after the music & all ravers execpt 4 were long
gone.  What a magical night.  The little black dog was there again too.

On a mysterious note, I had a UFO sighting last night - no, no it wasn't one 
that a lot a people suspect was due to AltEred stAtes - I really saw something.
I saw a triangular formation of 3 round red spotlights on a thing that was 
flying a way up in the air for about 30 seconds before it
disappeared.  It was zipping around changing direction really quickly.  Did 
anyone else see it?  It happened at about 2:30am and a friend of mine who does
not know what to make of it also saw something.

Also while investigating Bonny Dune road, I saw the aftermath of a scene where
a car had slid off the embankment down the side of the road and was winched up
and towed away.  It looked like it was done very recently from the way the 
grass and trees were stripped down and the way many parts of the front of a
Buick were down there.

Words won't do justice describing the scene at FMR last night.  I would just 
say it was pretty magical.  The vibe was strong and the view was magnificent
and I talked to a lot of people about higher consciousness stuff.

Spread the vibe,

Maybe fish look at humans walking and think, "how do they swim so well through
that air?"  Even though we aren't suspended like fish we do kinda swim in this
really really thin fluid called air...........

Hm.  I thought I was the last sfraver in attendance when I
split at 2PM or so.  I wonder how I missed Taxi... anyway,
I cheated by arriving "late"... like 7 or 8 AM.  I felt
really tired Sunday night, so I crashed out early and as a
side effect, I woke up around 5AM and felt like going out.
Thought I might get in a few hours of dancing.  Instead it
was more like a five hour session, including some trash
pick-up, and a brief swimming session...

I didn't notice a *lot* of eye-contact avoidance, but then I
showed up with mass quantities of fruit and donuts and such
that I picked up on the way down.  I guess I have noticed
that a lot of the regulars in the San Francisco in-crowd
(people I see all the time at Full Moons and Golden Gate
park raves) don't quite Get It.  There are quite a few women
around who seem afraid that if they acknowledge your
existance in any way they may be stuck with you until you're
forcibly detached somehow.

Anyway, these days, I don't let it bother me much since I'm
pretty well convinced it's more their problem than mine.

So how long was Markie Mark spinning anyway?  More than four hours?
When he put on a raggamuffin version of "We Are All Family"
at noon, nearly all of the remaining ravers got up to dance.

(Personal aside: Sorry I didn't give you a ride Pat, but I
didn't think you'd appreciate a phone call at 6AM.  And
susie says she really wants to meet you sometime, she
promises not to dis you again.  If nothing else, she'll be
at Connection II).

Another reason for lugging an annoying leather jacket around
at raves:  When you're hauling a garbage bag full of broken
glass up the hill on your back, you worry a lot less about
it.  On the other hand, it doesn't help if rancid beer leaks
out and soaks your hair.  But then, that's what skinny
dipping in the ocean is for...

After the rave, I rambled up the coast to the Three Amigos
for lunch, kept going looking for Grey Whale Cove (again)
and blew it (again) and decided to head up to San Francisco
(again) to visit my home away from home, The Brain Wash,
look for records, and like that.

Along the way I came up with a very interesting flyer:

world premiere performance ov
the Asphyx

Psychedelic
exmperimental
trance
music                    SAT
featuring                March

                                  S.F.

Anyway, got that?  That's the first serious (in my opinion)
competition for Connection II.  

You know, last Alternity II, I was suprised at the low
turn-out, even among SFravers.  Apparently a lot of people
prefered to go and spend money at Basics.  Now me, I was on
the guest list for Basics that night, but I blew it off to
spend a little money on Alternity, support some friends of
mine in their efforts, and hang out in a smaller, more
intimate setting... 

Just cranking up my guilt phasers in advance. Just in case,
you understand.

        Wel, this is Inhuman reporting live from Santa Cruz.  I just had 
my first west coast rave experience last night / this morning.  Wow...  I 
went with a friend to Bonnie Doon beach, where the FMR was supposed to be 
held and found a bunch of raverssitting around waiting for the rave to 
start (this was at about 1am).  Several fires were started and we all sat 
around listening to someone's mix tape.  Around two-thirty the sound 
truck finally showed up.  It was really cool, with everyone helping to 
carry the speakers and stuff down into this little cove from up atop 
these sandy cliffs.  After some difficulties, Garth finally got started 
around four.  Everyone was so ready for it to start that the crowd just 
exploded in dance energy.  Garth's set was pretty damn good.  A very 
strong hip-hop influence.  I heard many Public Enemy samples and a lot of 
hip-hop style record scratching.  It really got me moving.  Garth was 
followed by Jeno, who spun a cool set, but nothing terribly incredible.  
The coolest part was the sunrise.  It was cloudy, so there was no 
spactacular sunrise or anything, but just seeing this beautiful cove with 
the waves crashing against the rocks, people up on the cliffs setting up 
tents, and trancey-tribal music resonating everywhere.... WOW.  I ran 
into Susie, fellow dc-raver and she introduced me to a lot of sfravers, s 
o that was fun.  Overall a very cool experience...  So different from the 
east coast.

        See all you sfravers at Connection II!  Sorry for tantalizing all 
you ne-ravers by cross-posting, but I thought you might be interested...

truck finally showed up.  It was really cool, with everyone helping to 
carry the speakers and stuff down into this little cove from up atop 
these sandy cliffs.  After some difficulties, Garth finally got started 
around four.  Everyone was so ready for it to start that the crowd just 
exploded in dance energy.  Garth's set was pretty damn good.  A very 
strong hip-hop influence.  I heard many Public Enemy samples and a lot of 
hip-hop style record scratching.  It really got me moving.  Garth was 
followed by Jeno, who spun a cool set, but nothing terribly incredible.  
The coolest part was the sunrise.  It was cloudy, so there was no 
spactacular sunrise or anything, but just seeing this beautiful cove with 
the waves crashing against the rocks, people up on the cliffs setting up 
tents, and trancey-tribal music resonating everywhere.... WOW.  I ran 
into Susie, fellow dc-raver and she introduced me to a lot of sfravers, s 
o that was fun.  Overall a very cool experience...  So different from the 
east coast.

        See all you sfravers at Connection II!  Sorry for tantalizing all 
you ne-ravers by cross-posting, but I thought you might be interested...

Subject: The FMR


	If I die, I hope raver heaven is like last nights FMR.

	It started late but was well worth the wait.
	I got there about 1:15 thinking I was arriving late
	but as usual the sound system hadn't arrived yet.
	There wer maybe 15 people in the parking lot and about
	100 people on the beach.  More people were arriving and
	actually being smart and parking on Bonny Dune road!
	I guess you can train ravers after all!
	For a few moments I thought the FMR massive might have
	changed their minds but around 2:30 I saw one of the folks
	from the british posse and he assured me that the sound
	truxk was on the way. It arrived around 3 and we quickly got
	the equipment down to the beach which is a lot smaller now
	(I guess due to winter storms and stuff).  We had some technical
	problems and one power amp refused to work.  One of Craig Larson's
	sound engineer friends came to the rescue and repatched the system
	to run on one amp.  Not as loud but definately addequate.
	The music was in full swing with Garth leading off.  It was 
	sorta cold but not freezing.  I met a lot of NE ravers
	including inhuman and suzie.  Saw a lot of regulars but surprisingly
	few SFravers. Jeno came on around 6 when it was starting to get light.
	He palyed a typical godlike mind-blasting jeno set that put
	me immediately into deep trance.  In fact it was one of the deepest
	trance states that I have ever attained.  This was particularly
	surprising to me as I was completely sober.  But I guess I know
	beyond a shadow of the doubt, that it's the Vibe and the music
	that does it for me and that it IS possible to rave hard without
	the drugs.  I must have danced for several hours straight without
	crystal or E or A, wow!  It was strange to be in deep trance in
	daytime though with all of the colors and people's faces and stuff.
	After Jeno came Markie and he continued the dance groove, refusing
	to allow people to stop dancing.  I walked around and actually
	talked to a lot of people,  It was great to breath that clean
	air and my lungs actually felt GOOD and clean in the morning.
	Give me an outdoor rave anyday.  If this FMR is what we have to
	look forward to than I'll be happy!

Wonderful attitude for a raver. I've known some Door folks for at least a
decade including Tommy Vision who works at Bottom of the Hill and DNA, and
a fine person. He was shot in the face by some pycho while working the door
at Club Nine, (pre-Stud locaction).  I find if you treat people politely
and don't expect favors if you don't know them, (like getting in if you're
under 21), they treat you OK. I rarely have problems at the door, and if
you do perhaps you should re-align your own attitude. 

I know door persons at several clubs, and they make mistakes just like the
rest of us, but I REALLY don't like you condoning or relishing the fact
that great harm was used against one of them, just because you had a
problem with them. If some one does you wrong it's on their karma, wishing
what you did just drags your own down.

I thought about this when one of the first rave I attended got busted.
Think it's a fine idea, perhaps even handing out FM radio headsets at the
door, (have to be a small event. Or if a couple hundred subscribed to Sport
Illustrated when they were offering free FM headsets with a subscription
and then cancelled). 
One of the bigger problems with the idea is sub-woofers have come to play a
large part of the experience, and as FM doesn't go down very far, I think
folks would miss the low end, but it might be interesting for a park type
event to have headsets with a cross-over sending lows to a set of subs, and
the rest to a FM headset broadcast system. Makes a great picture for me.

And on a partially unrelated topic, I've been working a show that had one of the
more advance laser video projectors in existance. Instead of using a Barco
or GE light-valve type projector, this uses a special green-blue laser, and
a red-dye laser and some sort of mask for the picture with a spinning
mirror for the scan. It also has a moving lens aimed at a set of motion
controlled mirrors, (like in an intellibeam), so this machine can move a
bright projected video image all around a large curved screen, (about 200
feet by 60 feet high), all the while correcting for focus and alignment as
well as size and can flip or rotate the image. They cost about a million
each, but have tons of possibilities.

a few replies/clarifications:


1)  Are you sure you don't mean the Oasis in San Jose?  The one in SF (just
up the street from Slim's) doesn't seem like that at all
--------

yes, i mean the one in SF, as I said, i've experienced this personally
and have heard similar stories from others, albeit sometime ago (1-2 years?).
i haven't really gone back since then....


2)  MOR = "Modern Rock"?
---------
no, middle of the road, as in conservative, suburban, etc.


3)  "i think that incident has been a long time coming"???   I may not like
some of the bouncers at clubs I've attempted to get into, but I never thought
a shooting would be an appropriate response (or even an expected one).
----------
no, dear one, i'm not *that* viscous #;-), i don't think it's *cool*
that such a  thing happened, but to be truthful, considering that i
am quite *non-violent* compared to most, and considering the violent
way i was treated, am i surprised that somebody shot a bouncer there?
hell no.  this is a crazy world, and many are at the end of their ropes,
so i'm not surprised that someone went off after an "experience" with
oasis bouncers...is the bouncer okay, injured, dead or what?

I'm wondering if anyone can help me out here...

I'm headed for San Francisco on business for two weeks and I don't know a soul 
out there.  Does anyone know of any good raves, clubs, record stores, clothing 
stores, things to do, nice friendly ravers, etc. in San Francisco?  I'd be most

  Maybye we can bring interesting visual healing toys,crystals,
written notes..anything positive..as gifts for Mal during his recovery..
He really needs your energy now..

Another area in which we can help him is in thinking about ways we can
possibly get him online with access to a computer during his recovery..
Richard Balcon is coordinating this aspect of his recovery
(rbalcon@us.oracle.com) Having something like this happen to one of our
dearest friends is a major tragedy,but we must rise to the occasion..
Maybye the programmers among us might be able to coordinate with Richard...
...
It's hard to think now, I just heard about this about an hour ago,but
one thing comes to mind..We have to keep giving him our energy and love..
Malachi comes from a tiny town in Ireland with few amenities for a
handicapped person.. We have to develop an infrastructure that will support
him and enable him to stay here in San Francisco with those who love him.
...
Another thought.. Malachi was coming back from the FMR with other people..
The driver of the car fell asleep at the wheel... Think about this before
you get in a car..If you're tired and havn't slept..or if you've taken drugs
take a nap or let it wear off *before* getting in the car... The driver
of the car walked away from the accident ... but Malachi's life will never
be the same..

Status: ORS


	As some of you know, Malachi, the organizer of ComeUnity was
	injured in a car accident on monday night.  He is in stable
	condition.  He has suffered damage to the C3 and C7 vertebrae
	but his spinal cord is in tact and has not been severed.
	He is currently suffering some temporary shock paralysis but
	is awake and aware.  Currently he can not have visitors and
	will be undergoing surgery tonight to stablize his spine area.
	After the surgery he will be moved to St. Mary's hospital.
	PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO VISIT UNTIL IT IS OK TO DO SO.
	He will be able to have visitors most likely within a week.


	The best thing to do now is to send him lots of love energy
	and DON'T WORRY.  I'm not saying don't be realistic, but
	we need to all pull our positive energies and thoughts
	together at this time.  A lot of the Bay Area promoters
	are putting together some large benefit events as well as
	a trust fund for Malachi's recovery, stay tuned.

	Set your luv-phaser on full and think of him as you trance/dance
	over the next few weeks/months.  Together as a ComeUnity we need
	to pull together to help someone who has given so much to each 
	of us.

	Keep it alive.

Re: Ramsey FM-10 transmitters and raves.

We've talked about this a few times, and there's no real reason you
can't do it. The Ramsey kit is of very good quality sound, stereo, and
not that big a deal to assemble and align for someone who's done this
before. (The modifications commonly described are therefore, optional.
Not really necessary.) You can get the kit at many electronics/surplus
places, and it runs on batteries. It's inexpensive, even if you get
the custom case for it.

One thing I like about the idea is that it virtually eliminates the
possibility of noise complaints. One thing some deejays might not like
is that it makes it easy to tape their sets. 

As for the legality of broadcasting: there is some confusion about how
much power you are allowed to use, however, you do not need much power
to fill a warehouse -- and the structure of the building will tend to
contain the radiation so that it won't carry too much farther. Pumping
up the power is NOT RECOMMENDED, however, since the FCC could
potentially hand you a very large fine.

If I were going to do this, I would probably stick to stock, and use a
small antenna (like the one that comes with stereos). If coverage
wasn't good enough, I'd try a Radio Shack FM "roof mount" antenna. If
reception is still problematic, I'd re-evaluate the site.

Sounds like it's worth a try. Contact me if you like.

 Here's the text of an article I'm working on for Fuzzy Logic.. what do you
folks think of this idea?
-Chris.
Cheaptech blaster/FM TRANSMITTER!

Hey,guys and gals.
Have you ever fantasized about being your own radio dj,playing all your favo-
rite mixes to all your friends .. Well, if you have a minimum skill with a
soldering iron..it's possible to build a small stereo radio transmitter.
This transmitter is so small it can be put inside of a boombox...so you
can take your party on the road!(The ones with mike mixing and built in EQ's
are best!) Imagine the fun when you
and your friends have a picnic in the park..all
listening to the same tune on your blasters.."But where is it coming from..?"
Take the party out to the streets,out to the front of your favorite rave or
club..Anyone
with an FM radio can share in the fun..(For a completely *silent*
party,use headphones,You can all still dance!!!)

The kits that make it all possible are the Ramsey FM-10 microtransmitter
module or the BA 1404 FM stereo module. This and some other systems has been
described in the July 1992 issue of Popular Electronics,along with some
popular mods.The parts are,for the most part,really cheap..so,experiment!

The'mods' may be required to improve certain
characteristics of these transmitters..One good idea would be to replace
the standard capacitors with silver-mica or tantalum capacitors
and possibly (if you are using the FM-10)to replace c7 with a 68 pf capacitor
(to narrow the tuning range..which is quite sharp..)or even better,to
replace c7 and c8 (which are wired in parallel) with a 38 khz quartz crystal
and a 10-20 pf capacitor,wired in series.. This makes it easier to develop
a stable stereo signal!! If you're using an antenna (and not building this
inside a blaster) the ideal antenna length is found by this formula

234/frequency = length in feet 
The frequency should be around 88 or 108 mHz (the ends of the FM band!)
You'll get better reception if you keep the antenna up and away from metal
objects..
If you are building this inside a blaster you'll want to add a "4PDT" tiny
toggle switch to turn on the transmitter,bypass the headphone output of
the blaster into the transmitter,(you may want to add a volume
control for each channel here to adjust the coarse audio level),and
disconnect the antenna from the FM receiver and attatch it to the
transmitter.Label this switch "Transmit"Try to use a good quality switch here,
and keep the leads as short as possible.(You can probably get this
switch at Radio Shack or if you live in NYC,on Canal St.)
An antenna trick might be to add a sheet of flashing copper to the bottom
of the blaster case and
connect it to chassis ground on the blaster.This can provide a 'ground
plane'.Make sure it doesn't make contact with any power wires.This helps the
whip antenna have something to
work 'against'- dramatically increasing your range if you put your
blaster on a car.For more information about radio transmitter construction
techniques check out books on amateur radio at your public library.(If
your town still has one in this era of cutbacks) Remember when doing wiring
to stay far away from any 110 volt wiring in your blaster.This is usually
connected to the power switch and the power plug.(You will want
to have a friend who knows electronics check your work,before you turn it
on,if you have any doubts..)
Good luck!

 Okay,here are the surces for
the kits and information..
The BA1404 transmitter is $2.00 (yes,that wasn't a typo.)from D.C.
Electronics. 1-800 467-7736 or 1-800 423-0700
The manufacturer can be reached at
Rohm Corporation,
3034 Owen Drive
Antioch,TN 37013
(615)641-2020

The FM-10 transmitter can be obtained from Ramsey Electronics at
(716)924-4560 
38 khz crystals are available from Digi-Key
(800)DIGI-KEY (part #SE3314) (be careful when soldering this)

Much higher quality,but much more expensive kits can be bought from
Panaxis Productions,PO Box 130,Paradise,CA 95967
(916)534-0417
There's lots more info I could steer you to,but we have limited space.
For more FM-10 info,there's a mailing list on the Internet that you can join
to get more info..(if you have e-mail access)

It's accessible by sending a quick note to:
fm-10-request@dg-rtp.dg.com
There's also a file available by Internet FTP (file transfer utility)
on related subjects..It's on the 'host' dg-rtp.dg.com in the fm-10 directory.

Also, a small packet on FM-10's can be gotten from Mycal at PO Box 750381
Petaluma,CA 94975. Send him a dollar and a self addressed,stamped envelope
to cover mailing costs. Good luck! Who needs a club to have a rave!!

-Chris.

A few points...

1)  Are you sure you don't mean the Oasis in San Jose?  The one in SF (just
up the street from Slim's) doesn't seem like that at all, while the SJ Oasis
I could believe.

2)  MOR = "Modern Rock"?

3)  "i think that incident has been a long time coming"???   I may not like
some of the bouncers at clubs I've attempted to get into, but I never thought
a shooting would be an appropriate response (or even an expected one).

while they were there hanging out, some guy who got thrown out of the
club on friday night returned with some friends and a handgun and blew
four holes in the bouncer's chest.
------------

those bouncers are fuct, plain and simple.  i've been physically
attacked and thrown out by one of them over a case of mistaken id, 
and of course no refund.  i've heard the same from a fair # of
others.  the place is lame, the bouncers are jerks and the management
seems to have this "let's attack the most MOR crowd we can get" type
of attitude, so i avoid the place...i think that incident has been a
long time coming....

it hasn't been able to process sfraves mail and I haven't been able to 
read my mail since last night (and any of you who know me know how stir

you may have sent is not lost.  However, if there is something you want
sent out soon, you can send mail to sfraves@sfraves.stanford.edu, and it'll
get to everyone just fine.  Sorry about the inconvenience...

That's right, I wanted to say something about that...  The
high tide line seemed a bit higher just now than it was at
the first Connection, and some sand has moved away.  If we
had the DJs set up in the same place this morning (1) the
dance area would've been a lot lower, maybe eight feet below
the DJs (2) the dance area would've been flooded with water
(3) the DJs would've been splashed with surf.

>Speed kills the Vibe.

O.K. I think I 11th or 12th the motion at this point.  I have known one
and only one person out of the whole bunches of people that I have known
that got into this drug that can handle it (including myself, I tweak hard
on stimulants, even coffee).  I realy don't mean to sound cliche but I have
seen a few good friends and many general aquaintances that have become
unexceptably weird from speed.  It's kinda funny at first to talk
about the little humuorous stories of your tweaker friends exploits and
long binges but it gets old when you have it affect your life and your not
even in that scene.

I'm convinced that one friend that I have has neurological damage.  She has
lived on speed for about 8 years or so now.  She wakes up when she sleeps
(not often) and can't open her eyes or move a muscle and she freeks out
'cause she feels trapped in her body.  Theres too much more to even write.

Another friend feels the need to explain everything and make very loose
associtations between completely unrelated occurances, pysical objecte, ect.
and thinks he is "explaining the universe".  "See that potato chip wrapper
blowing by?  That's a south-blowing wind.  The center of the galaxy is to
the south.  That wrapper is on it's way to the center of the galaxy."  Ya
like that but even worse.

Then this other person who is convinced that "they" are after him because
of his heavy political activism.  Not hard to believe except that he's not
politicly active.  He made some copies of political material for someone
once.

I party with that one individual that I mentioned that can handle speed all
the time but that's cause he can handle it.  He has intense staminia.  I've
seen the guy sick maybe 3 or 4 times in the 8 or so years that I've known
him but maybe his nose is too toxic for germs to survive in.  He also knows
when to eat and sleep and doesn't act unexceptably weird. 

I have heard more than a few times that speed caused or heavily contributed
to the demise of the Haight-Ashbury scene.  I would tend to believe it and
this scares me because I totaly agree with Geoff W., if anything can ruin
the scene, out of everything that we've talked about, speed can.

Sorry for the rant but I could write a book of stories and trouble that
I've seen like the stories above.  Actualy I could write a book about
each individuals trips.  I guess I'm kinda biased about this subject but
I don't generaly preach at people.

They must of heard that SF has the best rave vibes and you saw 'em
droppin off E.T.s at the FMR. |-)

I do believe you though, having seen weird things in the sky myself.
Although it was in Kings Canyon N.P., which is next to Edwards Air
Force Base, so it was probably military rather than E.T. in my case,
but lucky you.

i have this theory that guilt is not subject to the laws of

angst.)  probably the wrong venue for this discussion though.

A few thoughts on the benefit idea..
If we do a benefit..we should probably try to somehow.. (I don't know if this
is possible) get some kind of permission to hold the event legally...
(I mean..who couldn't understand what we are trying to do..)
Otherwise..well, just think of how depressing it would be.. (esp after the
already tragic week..) if the party got busted...
...........

This whole thing just breaks my heart...

Subject: Respectfully, a flame
Status: ORS

SFRAVES is a mailing list. This means that it gets delivered to
peoples' mailboxes, one copy to a customer. 

Unlike a bulletin board or a news group, there is no easy way for
people to skip over the material that is not of interest to them. In
addition, that material gets mixed in with their personal email. It
takes up their personal disk space.

This mailing list also generates more traffic than almost everybody's
personal email. I have lots of email pals, and get 100 messages a week
from them. SFRAVES generates more mail messages than that. 

There is no moderator to weed through the chaff. Each person who
subscribes -- over a hundred people last I heard -- has to deal with
this volume of mail. It's their diskspace and their time. 

Now if the volume is mostly junk, people give up and leave. The
mailing list tends to become pure junk, and dies. Junk breeds junk.

Don't send junk.

Don't send stuff that's more appropriate elsewhere. For instance, if
you have an apartment, a car, a turntable, or whatever, or you want
one, check out the numerous and very well stocked usenet newsgroups
for exactly these purposes. Some start with ba.market. More people
read ba.market groups than read this list. More people will help you
sell or buy a car, turntable, or apartment. They are reading those
groups for the specific purposes of doing just that.

Why am I reading this mailing list? To hear about raves. Not
apartments, cars, or turntables. I have tolerated and continue to
tolerate the discussion that strays from my own personal interests.
If I didn't, I would leave. But please realize that when your
submissions to this mailing list are off the topic, you are helping to
kill it off.

If you have any comments about this, feel free to send them to me, at
the address above, if you think they are not germane to the other >99
people who will have to read them and delete them.

	I have a thought for a projection visual.  I don't know if this
has been done or if its stupid but anyway...
is there any way to project the readout on an oscilloscope...
While messin' around in physics lab I came up with some pretty trippy
patterns, etc...

	Just a thought,

Well see ya all at Connection2...

	Ayup, looks like slim pickins this weekend.  Gee, I don't have much
to recommend... There's this small thang going on saturday night, but I dunno
much about it... (hee hee hee).

	The thing on Thursday night sounds cool, if only it weren't at the
Sound Factory, which is semi-notorious for being very "clubby" and alcoholic.
But some good events have happened there, maybe I should give it the benefit
of the doubt...

	Friday night I _may_ check out Mister Roger's Neighborhood, only to
Doc Martin and Jeno... and then afterwards hit Smiling Thru. I would also
highly recommend Mission Rock that night too, as a pre-rave cool place to
hang out.  

	Saturday night, of course, is the SFRaves birthday party.  Things
are falling into place VERY nicely for it.  If you decide to go, PLEASE
dress warmly and carry a flashlight.  And set your luv phasers on kill. :)
If you can't make Connection, Ascend looks like it has a pretty good DJ lineup;

	And I hope to see EVERYONE at the GG Park thang on Sunday afternoon.
It's the beginning of something big...

	And if you do go out, DRIVE SAFELY.  See everyone this weekend!

	Brian

Subject: More speeding stories
Status: ORS


OK, I personally don't touch the stuff cuz I was born on some sort of natural
speed and I haven't slowed down since birth. Of course, I do need my sleep.

But I have known many friends who tweek.  I can't even think of one that
handles it well.  I'll just talk about three of the worst cases:  one started
mixing it with A and after about a month of mixing, he ended up in a mental
institution - I don't know his whereabouts anymore.  Another lost so much
weight, he looks like he's an anorexic.  Another just got very weird - like
he was seriously "wacko" - *intense* emotions for no obvious reasons.  He 
returned to his "normal" personality again when he quit and once again he's 
quite fun to be around.

I recommend caffeine over speed any day.  But I must mention that studying for
a final a while back, I had a near nervous breakdown after drinking about 10
cups of very, very strong coffee.  I don't even drink soft drinks with caffeine
anymore..........cuz I don't need to nor want to :-)

Remember, TAXI's tips on responsible raving: (they're just tips, not laws)
- don't tweek
- catch up on sleep if you stay awake for the whole night
- bring snacks to give yourself some morning calories after a night's worth
  of dancing and staying up (unless you're into losing weight)
- drink lottsa water over the course of the eve.
- if your piss turns clear by the morning, take a multi-vitamin & mineral pill,
  fruits are great.
- don't drive if you're sleepy
- bring along all this stuff with you when you go raving, you decide what.
- quit your job if you can't handle raving & work <-- jus kidding, ha ha ha 
- don't smoke cigarettes (Raving & cigarettes turned my lungs to mush).

I lost 25 lbs (12% of my body weight) in about 3 months when I first started
raving.  That's when I came up with the "responsible raving" idea.  Sure it
sounds like common sense but I had to force myself to make sure I had a water
bottle (now I bring two), vitamin pill, cookies, extra clothing with me as I
left home in a hurry.  I don't think I've lost anymore weight since then.

spread the vibe,
TAXI

XDZebra Review #24

I've got a stack of about twenty discs in the queue right now.  Finals aren't
helping much, but I'll attempt to get things out in a timely manner.  Also,
I've started to buy (horror of horrors) vinyl.  Don't expect many reviews on
that though, I don't think my work would take to me putting a 1200 in my
office.

Review #24 Contents:
The Irresistible Force: Flying High
Frankfurt Trax Vol. 3: The House of Phuture
GTO: Love is Everywhere
Ragga Gabba Posse [Dr. Nunu]
Go Bang! Volume 2
System 7: 7:7 Expansion
In Order To Dance: 4


The Irresistible Force: Flying High
Rising High Records: RSN CD5
1       07:42 Spiritual High
2       12:01 Sky High
3       15:33 Flying High
4       09:39 High Frequency
5       08:48 Symphony in E
6       20:04 Mountain High (Live)

Comments: Done up in typical Irresistible Force ambient style (hold, pitch
bend, echo, mutate), "Flying High" is wonderful listening.  Although this
album does dip into a beat periodically, most notably on "High Frequency" and
"Symphony in E" it certainly isn't a dancefloor demolisher.  There are times
when this music tends to irritate me, but when I'm in the mood it locks
perfectly and manages to drop my heart-beat a few levels.  I'd like to see
Irresistible Force put out some dancier stuff though.  His track "Underground"
is one of my favorites.

Summary: 8/10.  For the mind and spirit.  Good variation in a single artist's
ambience is rare, but Irresistible Force does it.


Frankfurt Trax Vol. 3: The House of Phuture
Dance Pool: DAN 472387 2
1   4   03:56 Ace the Space: 9 is a Classic (Ultimate Rave Remix)
2   4   03:57 KillerLoops: Murder One
3   3   04:10 T-Bone Castro: I Want Cha (Women Here Part 2)
4   3   03:59 R U Ready: Uaeth 2
5   5   04:18 Mescalinum United: The 2nd Coming
6   3   03:46 A Lighter Shade: I Start 2 Fly
7   5   03:49 Nasty Django: Ey Loco!
8   4   03:43 Turbulence: Disaster Area
9   5   03:13 The Mover: Comet's Swarm Rising
10  3   04:10 The Possessed: Black Blood
11  4   03:10 Terrorists: The Outside World
12  2   04:04 Dag Tribe: Legalize It!
13  5   03:54 Headshop: Floorlifter
14  3   04:00 Program 1: World's Famous MF (Fractured Skull Mix)
15  3   02:08 Stalker: Walk on Thunderground
16  3   03:26 303 Nation: DetoNation
17  2   02:40 Alien Christ: Of Suns and Moons (Phaze 4)

Comments:  While this compilation of Planet Core, Dance Extasy 2001, Pretty
Asshole, and Super Special Corp artists contains some highly original and
headsplitting tracks, they are offset by cheap hardcore that is just plain
boring.  On the up side, Mescalinum United, The Mover, A Lighter Shade, Nasty
Django, Ace the Space, Headshop, and Turbulence.  Absolute garbage is turned
in by Dag Tribe, Stalker, 303 Nation, and Alien Christ.  What a way to end
what would have otherwise been a stellar collection of hardcore.

Summary: 5/10.  Hardcore fans will rate this higher, but I have a queezy
stomach when a track is just a ten second repeat.


GTO: Love is Everywhere
NovaMute: NMCD 3004
1   5   06:29 Elevation (Troll Mix)
2   4   06:08 Love is Everywhere (Everybody Party Mix)
3   4   06:15 The Bullfrog (Dataflow Mix)
4   4   06:11 Elevation (Sonic Beat Mix)
5   5   05:52 Love is Everywhere (Love Parade)
6   3   05:45 Love is Everywhere (Live & Love Mix)
7   3   05:39 Pure Energy
8   4   04:42 Listen to the Rhythm Flow (Make Some Noise)

Comments: More of an EP than album, GTO gives us three good mixes of the title
track and fills the remaining space with mixes that don't stack up to the
original singles.  The "Troll Mix" of "Elevation" was included on the
"Elevation" single, and is excellent, but played out.  The included mixes of
"The Bullfrog" and "Listen to the Rhythm Flow" long and uninspired.  Finally,
the "Pure Energy" makes you wonder if Newman & Wells were really behind it.
It lacks everything that its title makes it out to be.

Summary: 6/10.  An excellent single with plenty of bonus tracks.  Too bad it
really is an album.


Ragga Gabba Posse [Dr. Nunu]
Thunderpussy: THP 2005-2
1   4   05:04 Raggatrance 2000 pt.1
2   4   05:04 Raggatrance 2000 pt.2
3   5   05:28 Zap Machine pt.1
4   5   05:27 Zap Machine pt.2

Comments: "Raggatrance" is reminiscent of some Fierce Ruling Diva material,
and indeed usually mixes well into each other.  "Zap Machine" kicks hard with
a grooving guitar loop and a pumping beat.  I don't know what to think about
the pt.1 and pt.2 scheme though.  The second parts are definitely not
different enough to be called mixes, but I don't know why they just didn't
merge them into one track with a bit more variety.  Possibly because it would
have looked like you were getting two tracks on a disc?  Well, despite the
break, that is all that you're getting.

Summary: 6/10.  Good music, but at a $10 import for essentially two tracks,
not worth it.


Go Bang! Volume 2
Go Bang!: BANG CD096
1   1   02:15 Shake Inc.: Deep in Space
2   3   04:57 Quazar: Paradise
3   4   05:15 Shake Inc.: Brain Induction
4   4   05:00 Penetration: Basic Penetration
5   5   06:11 Turtable Hype: Techno Nation (NY Rave Reverb)
6   3   03:44 Supermatic: Power of the Dark Side
7   4   05:14 Quazar: Red Alert
8   4   04:49 D-Shake: Tecn0 Bam (Seismic Wow Edit)
9   4   03:03 Supermatic: To Uncommunicate
10  3   03:19 Turntable Hype: Set You Free (S Ozone Mix)
11  3   04:35 Shake Inc.: Rubb-a-Dubb Freestyle
12  5   06:07 Quazar: Dragonfighters
13  5   05:50 D-Shake: East of Eden
14      00:37 Outtro

Comments: A real mixed bag.  A lot of these tracks tend to be very standard
techno with no real progression.  These are prime examples of what makes an
initiate to the style stand back and state, "This all sounds the same."  Yet
tracks like D-Shake's and Quazars "Dragonfighters" are really quite good.  The
Shake Inc. stuff generally stinks, including yet another take on Luc Van
Acker's "Its in My Brain Now" sample with "Brain Induction".  Supermatic's
stuff is plain and unmoving.  Penetration provides a funky beat, but nothing
new.

Summary: 7/10.  The poor stuff isn't terrible, but the good stuff is really
great.


System 7: 7:7 Expansion
Weird and Unconventional/Big Life: BFLD 2
1   3   03:39 Conspiracy Edit
2   3   10:02 Conspiracy Mix
3   4   06:47 Nutritious Mix
4   1   10:10 Double Edge Sword Mix

Comments: Steve Hillage, Youth, and Tony Thorpe produce a mildly dancey,
strongly boring single for the upcoming System 7 album.  Yes, it is a catchy
guitar line Steve, and the the "huh-huh" sample fits beautifully, but what
else is there?  Tastes great, no filling.  The "Nutrious Mix" almost makes it
with some interesting breaks, but still isn't up to par with past System 7
work.  "Double Edge Sword" takes things on yet another burbling brook,
when-can-I-hear-the-theme-please ambient trip.  There is an interesting turn
about nine minutes into this mix, but it is quickly lost to more of the same.

Summary: 4/10.  I wouldn't be so down on this if it was $4 at a domestic
price, but otherwise forget it.

11  5   06:46 Music of Life Orchestra: The Dream
12  4   03:22 Jaydee: Plastic Dreams
13  5   05:11 Golden Girls: Kinetic

Comments:  Hands down, the best dance compilation I have ever bought.  The most
prime cuts of 1992 are on here.  Even though I already have many of these on
other compilations or singles, this brings the best all together.  If you're
looking for an introduction, buy this.  If you're looking for a best of, buy
this.  The first disc is harder than the second disc, but they both cross
zones with Neuro and Rhythm Invention.  Highlighted is the excellent new mix
of "I Love You" from Electrotete.  They've managed to take what they did for
Give Peace a Dance 2 and turn it into a stunning, moving, melodic masterpiece.
One disappointment is DJ Hell's "My Definition of House Music" which rocked
the charts, but is really only a simple remix of David Byrne's "Ava".  I liked
Jack Danger's version better.  Byrne isn't credited anywhere.  This isn't
sampling, it is stealing.  Also, "Digeridoo" sounds really weak for some
reason.  I think it is recorded at a slower speed.

Summary: 10/10.  $25-$28 is a steal for this kind of quality music.  Makes
other comps look like K-Tel.

My neighbor was feeding me that the moon was at its closest point to earth in
_10,000_ years.  Now, I'd almost believe him, but 10,000 years is a very long
time.  Does anyone know what the facts are?

From sci.astro there was a post that this was the 6'th closest the
moon and earth have been this century.  This was supposed to make the
tides 10-15% higher than normal

On sci.astro there was a post that claimed this was the 6th closest 
the Earth and Moon have been this century.  This was supposed to make
high tide 10-15% higher than normal.  My wife Kristen was happy cuz it
was her b-day.

Only go if you want your mind blown!!!!  He's the best d.j. in L.A. (IMHO).
 If you like Jeno you'll like Doc Martin.  And besides being a top d.j. in
L.A. (which may not be a recommendation to some) he is truly down to earth.
 He's completely down with the spiritual truth of whats going on.  No ego,
good/intense music, spiritual/friendly vibe...

Open your ears and your mind and give it a whirl.

but this is only my evaluation...thank you for your patience.

seek satori!

I was coming home to SF from the south bay on 101 the other day (right
before the full moon) and i noticed the opposite strangeness: very low tide.

You know the part of 101 near the water before candlestick (going south).
In my 10 years of living in the bay area, i've never seen so many rocks exposed
and so much mud/silt exposed. We're talking wicked low tides here. I did
have the thought that the tides would be unusually high for the FMR.

So there.

Doc's also spinning Friday night at Mister Rodger's Neighborhood, which is

you don't have to miss anything else on Saturday night :)

p.s. - rumor has it Doc will be watching the sunrise in the outdoors Sunday
morning, but we can't confirm this at this time...

This makes perfect sense. All of that water that's coming in to form our
record high tides has to come from somewhere. It's coming from the other side
of the world, resulting in record low tides there. When the earth rotates
180 degrees, we get the record low tides and they get the record highs.

Subject: Review of "Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier"
Cc: ligr206@orange.cc.utexas.edu (Stephen Daedalus),
        jacobs@mcc.com (Nigel Jacobs)

This panel discussion took place last Sunday as a sort of "teaser" for
CFP '93 (The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy) that's
running this Tuesday through Friday at the Airport Marriott in
Burlingame.  It was designed in equal parts as a general introduction to
the social and legal issues posed by the information and communication
revolutions that are being addressed by groups such as the EFF, and as a
book-plugging opportunity for cyberpunk whiz Bruce Sterling (who
commanded more speaking time than the other three participants
combined).  At $3-$5, it provided a financially reasonable alternative
to the CFP conference with its rather steep $405 cover charge.

From a social and legal standpoint, the most interesting presentations
were those by Mike Godwin and Mitch Ratcliffe.  Godwin is "employee
serial number 1" of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), founded by
Mitch Kapor of Lotus and others to track issues in this field and to
lobby for legislation necessary to preserve our rights in the face of
incredibly rapid technical change.  In 1988, the year of the Internet
worm scandal and the year a German cracker was caught selling U.S.
defense information to the Eastern Bloc, he decided to enter law school
to further avoid "growing up".  He chose to specialize in criminal law,
reasoning it was the "least boring, if also least well-paid" area of the
profession.

By Godwin's graduation in 1990, "computer crime looked like a real
growth industry" -- this was the year of the AT&T system crash which
induced much paranoia about the possibility of cyber-terrorism, and the
year Steve Jackson, an entirely innocuous BBS sysop in Texas had his
entire system seized by the Secret Service and was effectively put out
of business.  Godwin successfully defended Jackson against all charges,
and was subsequently offered the position as legal council at EFF and
decided to snatch it up.  He spoke passionately for the need to
disseminate cryptography technology as widely and quickly as possible as
our first line of defense against governmental and corporate intrusion
into our electronically networked lives.  He also drew our attention to
the federal government's active attempt to mandate that future digital
telephony equipment be "wiretap-friendly", that is, designed to easily
allow monitoring of communications without those "unsightly and
inconvenient alligator clips."  (This, my friends and SFR comrades,
should give you some inkling about their attitude towards the
Internet...)

Mitch Ratcliffe is an editor at MacWeek magazine who has a deep interest
in privacy issues, and formed a local organization called "This!Group"
as a sort of Bay Area-focused grassroots version of EFF.  The bulk of
his talk consisted of a close analytical reading of a form letter sent
to him from Chase Manhatten Bank, with whom he maintains a credit card.
The letter thoughtfully outlined an opportunity to buy back from them,
for a "modest" annual fee, all kinds of information they've accumulated
about his credit history, Social Security status, DMV data, and perhaps
most insidiously, his medical records.  Needless to say he raised a few
eyebrows and prickly questions about exactly who owns this sensitive
personal information and who should have control over its distribution.

John "Cap'n Crunch" Draper is a legendary techno-pirate whose many
exploits include invention of the "Blue Box" in the early 1970's, and
participation in the Homebrew Computing Club in whose womb Apple
Computers incubated.  He designed a telephony board for the Apple II
that allowed Wozniak to harass Jobs by methodically calling and hanging
up.  He recounted his experiences in prison where his fellow inmates,
having viewed a TV news report of Draper's conviction on phone hacking
charges, pressured him into conducting classes to teach them the in's
and out's of ripping off AT&T, and what happened when he was discovered
giving them intentionally inaccurate information (all he said about that
was that he was made to regret that decision to this day.)  Aside from
that amusing anecdote, his chat was rather long on techno-babble and
short on social insight, and seemed designed to impress rather than
illuminate.

But it was Bruce Sterling who stole the show, not to mention the bulk of
the speaking fees.  He spoke eloquently and engagingly about his
interest in the Steve Jackson case, which he spent 1-1/2 years of his
life researching and writing about in his book "The Hacker Crackdown".
As a result of this experience, he joined the first (and due to a change
in bylaws, also the last) local chapter of EFF in Austin, Texas.  He
observed acerbically how quickly his book has become out-of-date, given
advances in technology and legal developments, commenting that, much
like dog-years, "one year in cyberspace is equivalent to seven years
anywhere else."

Having discovered the Internet as a result of his research, he found
that it was the "apotheosis of the science fiction fanzine scene", an
ideal medium for establishment of his "vanity press."  To his utter
delight, he managed to attend the first CFP conference, which he
described as a "science-fictional event", in which hackers freely
co-mingled with Secret Service and FBI agents and everyone seemed "as if
they were on psilocybin."  He enjoyed the first two CFP's so much he
actually decided to *pay* to attend this year's!

Referring to Hakim Bey, he described the likelihood of future
corporations temporarily forming to develop some new technology and
disbanding before the full implications of the technology and its impact
on society are fully realized.  This phenomenon, which effectively
allows corporations to dodge social accountability is described in the
recent book "The Virtual Corporation."  I wonder if Bey anticipated the
application of his paradigm by the dominator culture as well as by those
operating outside of it.

He reserved his sharpest contempt for the notion that the Secret
Service, much less any arm of the U.S. government, can have any control
over the proliferation of software piracy and other hacking-related
crime now that armies of Eastern European teenagers have unleashed their
talents in societies for which there is "absolutely nothing else for
them to occupy their time."  At the same time, and somewhat
contradictorily, he discounted the danger of American teenagers breaking
into systems such as the Internet since they'll quickly find there's
little money in it.

Although some mention was made of the need to preserve and protect
privacy in electronic networking, the emphasis in this panel discussion
was on BBS's and their role in software and telephone system piracy, and
as such had little direct connection to issues of interest to us
SFRavers.  Still, there was much of historical interest, and it struck
home to me when Mike Godwin waxed about how this era is potentially the
most democratically and technologically revolutionary in history, in
that for the first time the bulk of communication is shifting from the
top-down hierarchical paradigm to one that connects "many people to many
people all at once in every direction."  Sounds kinda like raving to
these ears...

The entire session, including a lively Q&A period, was recorded on
videotape. I asked the woman recording it if audio copies might be
available.  She said they would and I have her e-mail address, so if
there's enough interest out there, we can probably arrange for one or
more tapes to be circulated.  Send me e-mail if you're interested and
I'll try to organize either a bulk reproduction of the tapes or some
other way of distributing them.

included "Feel The Panic".... From what I understand, only 500 copies
were pressed, so if you have it, you're a lucky one! If anyone has a 
copy they would be willing to sell, tell me how much you want for it. 
I'll have to forward this to ear/rational and the other on-line music
people, but if you have a copy (or know where to get one), send me mail!

Thanks!

Subject: Meeting 4 Malachy


did any sfravers go to Weds nite's meeting on how to respond as a community
to Malachy's injury?  could someone post a report?

One DJ who was there said, "can you believe it?  all the movers of the SF
scene in one place for the first time, and it wasn't because of the music!"

btw, this has proved to be a very strange week.  some of you have met Tanya,
a friend/lover/dancer for several years.  she's not yet 24, and one of her
best friends from teen years passed away suddenly yesterday morning.  out 
of the blue.  Laura was going to join us at connection....
now she'll only be there in spirit.  keep the luv phasers on high.

maybe there's something to all that gurdjieff stuff about the the moon
feeding on us and our energy.

peace,

Hi

I went to Bro last week end in NYC and it was a blast albeit not a  
true scene.  Too, I was surprised to hear that NE-Ravers were there  
and I didn't bump into them  :(  .  ORB was supposed to play, but he  
didn't hence the transliteration--BRO.  The cool thing was that in  
the CHILL room they were playing jazzy hip-hop.  I hadn't really  
listened to that genre 'cuz limited airplay, etc. in the Boston area.   
In fact, my first exposure was on a Sunday morning news show  
featuring a rapper mixing with old jazz stars and their music.  I was  
surprised at how friendly the sound/lyrics were given ganster rap.

Anyway I bought Digable Planets, at FACE recommendation.  I'm very  
pleased with the purchase and seems to me this disc is jazzy hip-hop  
and very appropriate for Chill scenes.

Just my 1/2 p  or $.02     : )

Brendan

Subject: Malachy

I just found out that Malachy went into surgery around noontime.
It's expected to last about five hours or so, and chances are
excellent that everything will go well.

Anyone who can should come to Mission Rock tonight, at China Basin
near the intersection of 17th and Illinois.  This has been one of Mal's
projects, and all proceeds will go towards his care.  It runs from 10
'til 2.  Unfortunately, this is a 21+ event  :(

Think deep and positive thoughts!

Subject: Malachi Update


	A place for Mal's family has been found.
	Thaks to everyone who helped.
	The apartment is empty however.
	We have an immediate need for two single
	beds or matresses and any house hold appliances
	that you might be able to spare.

	We also ask that you NOT call the hospital
	to find out about Mal's condition.  You can
	call Sarah @ 252-9312 to get news of Mal or
	if you have stuff to donate.

	Mal's strength is comming back, he still hasn't
	had the operation that he needs but this should
	happen soon. Wednesday night folks at the 
	Housing Project raised $500 by just passing
	a bucket around.  We are still in the process 
	setting up a trust fund for Mal, this should be
	ready by monday.

	We want to thank everyone for your support,
	the Bay Area House Family (and other's not
	in the Bay Area as well) have really shown
	how much of a Family you truely are.

			Love & Keep it Alive.

Hi Brendan,

We don't have a list server YET!  I'm working on setting up a NWRaves group. 
The scene up here is YOUNG.  Young in the sense that it is new to people here. 
There is a new sense of community arising from the raves that are being thrown
but, some people still don't get the idea that raving is viable movement and
not just another type of party.  It's about where the rave scene was in SF two
years ago.  Things are improving with time however.  Personally, my goal is to
help cultivate a good vibe and a strong sense of community.  The local
ordinances have been a pain in the ass.  There's a really harsh teen dance law
that's been killing the promoters as well as (Aaargghh!) the Seattle PD Rave
Task Force!  There's actually a a group of cops dedicated to busting raves that
crop up here.
The promoters here however, have started a dialog with these nazis.  Hopefully
we can turn them around to see that raves are not a threat, but an enhancement
to the city of Seattle. 

There are only several local promoters here.  So we're averaging 1 rave per
week, although small house parties have been proliferating as well.  However
some of the Bay Area promoters are starting to come up as well.  A Rave Called
Sharon will be held here this week (Sat. 3/13).  I'm looking forward to
checking it out.  We've had the good fortune to have had excellent DJ's from
down south come up.  Doc Martin, Garth, Spun, Jeno(!), DJ Pasta, Moonpup have
all been here within the last 3 months. The local DJ's here are very good as
well.  Dominator, Hebegebe, Tripper, Blade, to name a few have really been
polishing their craft and have done really good shows.

That's about it in a nutshell.  I would welcome any feedback from the sfravers
about ways that we can perhaps nurture the vibe and develop a strong cohesive
community up here. That's my primary reason for posting this reply to SFRAVES
as well. 

Peace, Luv & Ecstasy To You!

Tigger

Do you guys have a list-server up there?  What is the scene like up

you guys don't listen [assuming this trail of sillyness is due to my
comment earlier on the shooting of a bouncer].

NO I DON'T THINK IT'S DESERVED, COOL, OR ANYTHING ELSE ALONG THOSE LINES.


what i *said* is "i am NOT surprised it happened, given the rep and conduct
of those bouncers."

is that clear?  please don't ask me again if i think the bouncer "deserved
to die" or any other stupid shit like that, of course i don't, get real.

as for this:
-----------
FLAME ON

Wonderful attitude for a raver.  I've known some Door folks for at least a
decade including Tommy Vision who works at Bottom of the Hill and DNA, and
a fine person. He was shot in the face by some pycho while working the door
at Club Nine, (pre-Stud locaction).  I find if you treat people politely
and don't expect favors if you don't know them, (like getting in if you're
under 21), they treat you OK. I rarely have problems at the door, and if
you do perhaps you should re-align your own attitude.

I know door persons at several clubs, and they make mistakes just like the
rest of us, but I REALLY don't like you condoning or relishing the fact
that great harm was used against one of them, just because you had a
problem with them. If some one does you wrong it's on their karma, wishing
what you did just drags your own down.

Flame off
--------------
1st:my attitude is not what you think it is.  2nd: bouncers who feel the need
to randomly attack people at the clubs at which they work are *much* different
than the ones that do that admittedly difficult job properly.  3rd: i have
had *personal* experience with a bouncer at oasis and therefore *know* beyond
*any* doubt which kind of bouncer i dealt with, but you don't.  it was clear
at the time that the management *supported* the bouncers mistreating the
clientel.  people who physically mistreat others *may* find retaliation
directed at them, (tho NOT by me) which will NOT SURPRISE ME, get it?
and please....some of us believe in karma, etc., BUT...
good.


flame off?  nyaghh, it ain't that hot...

Subject: Malachi's Surgery is complete


	Malachi got out of surgery around 6:30 this evening.
	He has had a c4 - c6 fusion.  The operation was a 100%
	success.  They also picked out all of the bone fragments
	in the spine and in the area.  I think they used some metal
	in the fusion process.  He came out of the anesthesia OK
	and was surprised that it was over so soon :).  He is resting
	comfortably.  He can now be moved to St. Mary's.

	Now that Mal is out of immediate danger, we really need to
	crank up those luv-phasers.  Set them on HIGH and go for it.
	This is the part where we all can show the world what kind of
	people ravers really are.  Mal healing and recover process begins
	now, he says that he feels all of the luv energy that people are
	beaming to him, keep it up!  Over the next few weeks we will
	be co-ordinating various support sub-groups to assist Mal in his
	recovery.  We will need assistance with all kinds of information
	and advice, including medical, nutritional, legal, psychologica;,
	financial, etc.  Please e-mail me if you have special skills
	that you can donate or give at reduced rates.  If you know people
	who are into wholestic medicine, allopathic (regular :) medicine
	massage, etc. who could donate some time or at least give advice
	please let me know.

	To find the latest on Mal dial 415 252-9312

	PLEASE TRY TO REFRAIN FROM CALLING THE HOSPITAL or if you
	MUST please be polite!

If you are thinking about going to Connection but haven't committed to helping
yet or anything, there are still a few things you could help with:

1) Tables!  especially a good sturdy one for the DJ tables to sit on

2) A tarp and frame to put over the DJ when the sun comes up to keep him cool.

If you can get either of these, write me (I'll be checking e-mail until ~7pm
or so) or call me at 510-649-0351.  Thanks!

  The following is taken from the TAM NEWS (Tam High School, Marin County),
from an article on raves in the school paper:
  "Raves are the least of our problems.  We just stop by to make sure it's
safe, the access doors aren't crowded, there is proper security, and the
owners have the proper required permits," says Sargeant Steven Jones of
the San Francisco Police Department Task Force....
  "I find raves to be more of a mental excursion than an illegal one. 
They are definitely not a big problem for us," concludes Jones.

  This sounds encouraging to me -- or am I being naive?
  Thanx to my son Colin (hardcore techno fan) for showing me this article.

This message is to answer all of those cries of where's Pete with the food?

Well, we all know the beginning of the story. The charter oak warehouse was
a bust. I went to Zanzibar's figuring it would be a good place to hang until
those in charge got their stuff together. I thought others might have the same
idea. When I got to Zanzibar's however I found that the music was really bad
pop hip-hop. So I cruised around SOMA for a while and checked the hotline every
once in a while. At 2:15 it hadn't been changed and I was feeling "motivated"
to get out of the car and find a place to spend the night.

The only non-connection choices were Ascend @ the fashion center and Love
American Style/Unification at 16th and Harrison. The fashion center lost..

So I went to 16th and Harrison, payed the obligatory $20, underwent the
obligatory strip search and was in. Inside I found Zak, Mike and a couple of
non-sfraver friends, John and Evelyn. The place was hot, humid and packed.
The crowd was better than expected for the venue (I guess the occaisional
love phaser made it through the search).

I caught the last half of Mark Farina'a set. He seemed to be alternating 
between chicago house, and that deep trance stuff
I love so much. Ernie Munson followed him followed by Jeno, but I didn't hear
much of their sets, cause it was too hot to dance.

Outside there was a chill space set up with its own DJ. Harry Who was on when
I got there, Rick Preston tore it up later on.

Spun was the last DJ on the main dance floor and he tore it up. He finished
the rave hard, no fade, no final song, just one beat left to reverberate 
through the warehouse.


Overall I had a really good time and hope everyone else had just as much fun
wherever they were. When I finally made it home I found a message from Brian
on the answering machine telling me where Connection went to, oh well. At
least I know now.

Subject: Connection II tapes
Reply-To: boccibob%groovy@us.oracle.com


I'm still in the process of checking the DATs, but my best guess right
now is there is 360 minutes (6 hours!) of high quality stuff from
Connection II.  Thanks to all the DJs for performing above and beyond
the call of duty...

I'm also still in the process of sorting out getting cassettes made,
with a variety of companies sending me information.  (CDs require a
minimum pressing of 1000 before they get cost-effective, and I doubt
that 1000 sets could be sold.  Dang.  Besides, it would have to be a 4
CD set, which would be expensive anyway, or I'd have to cut a bunch of
music, which I don't want to do.)

Best guess at this point is that it'll be a 4 90 minute tape set, on
BASF cobalt + tape (type II tape) with Dolby HX pro (better high end).
Best guess on price is $25.  This price includes shipping, but more
importantly, it includes $5 per set to go to Malachy.  I think this is
an important part of this endeavor.  The DJs agreed to let these tapes
be released with the understanding that the sales of each set would
raise $5 for Malachy.  (DJs: I'm planning on tracking you down and
sending you a complimentary set once the tapes are done.)

I will make a real announcement, with more details, soon...  but
thought I should post as I've been getting a few inquiries about
copies...

I could use two bits of help... 1) if anyone has that text typed in
that Ameba gives out about raving, I'm thinking of using it on the J
card... or if anyone else has anything cool that's fairly short and
relevant, feel free to email it my way 2) if anyone out there has
access to gear and knows how to use it to produce composite printer's
film, I'll shortly have specs for the (4 color) J cards, and would
love to have someone work on it -- I've got some ideas for images to
use if you can convert a photo in a book to printers film, but if you
wanted to design something, that would be cool too.

Ground rules on both 1 and 2 is that they not reference anyone living
in any way, they can't reference SFRaves or C2, and I'd prefer that
they don't even reference SF.

Later on,
Bob

I remember people a while back discussing email correspondence to the
White House....I have a new FAQ that was updated pretty recently (lots
of info).  

GETTING INFORMATION TO AND FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Updated March 12, 1993

It is a fairly large document, so email me if you are interested. I
figure if there is enough interest I could do a wide posting.

I know this has nothing to do with raves and such, but this is good info.

Yeah, I talked to these folks, it was pretty funny, and made me feel
like quite a renegade... as I get out of my car in the parking lot...

"Hey, uh, hi, I'm (Bill?) and this is (Sharon? Shirley?)... we've been
hanging out and whatever and there hasn't been anyone around... why
all the cars showing up now?"

"Well, if you head down that way a bit, in about a half hour, you'll
see :-)  I'm Bob, nice to meet you.  Want a Blow Pop?"

"Uh, yeah, sure...  What are you guys going to do?  (I open the trunk
of my car, which is full with stuff.)  What's all the stuff for?  Do
you need a hand?"

"We're setting up a sound system down that way.  You should definitely
come check it out."

"A sound system?  How?"

"A generator and about 100 more people should be showing up any time
now :-)"

and on.  They did seem to have a really good time :-)

Bob

  Since I'm the one who first put in the remark about the late start on
Sunday, I think I owe the organizers an apology.  They're the ones who
schlepped the turntables, speakers, generators, etc. to the Park, lined up
the djs, got the permits -- all so we could go and enjoy ourselves for free.
They deserve our applause, not grumbles. 
   [Clap clap clap...n]
   Thanks much for the effort folks.  Looking forward to the next one. 
Let me know if I can do anything to help out.

I wouldn't bet the 1200's on that -- I've never known *any* event
in the park to start on time...   (Daylight Raving Time, you know  ;^)

 I was wondering if anyone in SFRaves was going to see Bad Manners when
they arrive in the SF Bay area? They were great when I saw them at the
Palo Alto Stone ( now the Edge club ), and the reviews in alt.ska have
been all positive. They'll be playing in San Francisco, but I'm going to
see them at The Edge on Mar. 25th ( unless something comes up ).

 I still have a buzz ... Connection II ( C2 ) will definitely be on my
all-time best rave list! No smart drinks, no video projections, no
fancy chill room - just good music and good people! ( The only special
effect was provided by Lee Fogel in the form of one little strobe light
).

 C2 wandered like a refugee from the original beach site, to the smaller
but dryer Charter Oak warehouse. After only about an hour of it's
starting time, it got closed down by the SFPD for being permit-less.
Recovering from this blow, the resilient organizers of C2 moved it to
the beautiful Berkeley Marina.

 It had been the first time for me at this site - I understand now why
people are so enthused about it. A convenient spot with picnic benches
that's just right for setting up a sound system. A grassy area that's
just the right size for 200 people, with space left over for picnic
blankets and sleeping bags. To chill, there are benches and boulders
along the SF Bay just a stroll away ; and if you're in a climbing mood,
a bushy hillock with some concrete benches and a great view.

 Of course, the view wasn't very good on this particular night, due to
the overcast. From the clouds came a nearly continuous , lazy drizzle -
thankfully, not enough to soak you to the bone or short out the sound
system. We managed to get a plastic tarp over the mixing table, but the
records still got wet ( and, a big "Thank-You !" to all the DJ's that
did C2 , even as their record collections got damper and damper. I hope
you got the vinyl dry as soon as you could - I used to live in Hawaii,
and I know that mildew will grow on records, given enough humidity ).
Actually, it may have helped to cool us off - I don't think anyone was
in danger of heat stroke at all. I was glad to get into dry clothes
afterwards.

 For some reason - call it vibes or second wind or whatever - I wasn't
as tired as I thought I'd be for someone who had been up since 8 AM 
without chemical assistance , not even caffiene. I usually like to zoom 
about the dancefloor at most raves, and the Berkeley site provided 
comparatively unlimited zoom space for me. I was dancing on shoreline 
boulders, and on the hillock trails. If my feet weren't hurting me, it 
would have been perfect. I tried dancing on bare feet , but the cold 
soaked into my feet and discouraged me real quick! That didn't stop some 
folks from barefootin' - I hope they didn't regret it later.

 We had at least two first-time ravers - a twenty-something couple had
been hanging out in the parking lot when we arrived - they got curious
as more and more cars showed up. Some ravers invited them to the party, 
and they accepted. They both looked like they were really enjoying it! 
They must have stayed for about one or two hours.

 The joggers showed up in the morning - for some reason , the site
attracts middle-aged and white-haired health enthusiasts. They didn't
give us a second ( or third ) glance. I offered some of them our left
over oranges , but only one of them took some, leaving me with about
thirty of them.

 One cop car did a spin around the parking lot and left - I guess he was
verifying that we had shut down. That, and the other two visits during
the night, was the sum total of the police presence that night. ( If
"the man" is reading this - thank you ! ).

 And, no little part of the event was meeting people who I had previously 
only knew as email entities. I'll have to get IDs from other folks after
I finally develop the film, as my poor memory for names has screwed me 
again ( although I'll definitely remember which one Dana Watanabe is - 
the folks at our table at the International House Of Pancakes know what 
I'm talking about :-) ). 

 I was glad to have been a part of this event, and I'm especially glad
that we were able to raise some money for Malachy. With better weather
and more luck ( and permits ? ), I hope Connections 3,4,5,6 ... ( some
ludicrous number ) matches the good vibes of this one!

	Still processing the weekend, so i'll have to post my thoughts on
Connection][ later.  But to let people know what's been found @ the warehouse
after that rather hurried exodus --
		
		grey makeup kit
		black light & strobe - these are Randy's i think,
					but i don't have your e-mail address
		nice flashlight - i borrowed this from someone and swore i
					wouldn't lose it (oops, well, i found
					it again eventually), but now i've
					managed to forget your name

Any takers?

Oh, and if you think you might have left something else there, let me know
and i'll look around again next time i'm there (probably sometime this week).

Subject: Re: GG Park Rave

	The reason the park started so late was because the authorities said
that due to the dampness of the grass, that the party must start a little later, 
after the grass dries up.  Actually, that was only part of the reason.  The 
other reason was that the truck we used to transport the generator didn't show up
until about 1 pm at the rental place.  Since nobody would dare flake twice, I
doubt that the park will be starting late on later dates.  
	Regardless, the park was a great success!  I haven't seen so many happy
people together in a while (probably since I missed Connection II ;) 
It was incredible to see that many people show up on a day that was so gloomy.
I can hardly wait for the sun to come out on sundays to come!

SPRING!!!!!!!!!!  almost.  =-)

happiness to all,

  Like a simpleton, I took the "get there at 11:00" notice literally -- or
almost so.  When I drove by at noon, there was nothing but wet grass and a
sullen sky.  So my vanload left for the Richmond for lunch.  When we
returned after 1:00, there was equipment, a small crowd, but no power
generator.  A bit later, though, the generator appeared, fired up, and the
music started.  It was slow going to begin with -- though I did my best to
jumpstart the energy with my diabolo and juggling balls.  Saw Niels,
chatted, and then went off to do some serious juggling at the other end of
the park.  Returned about 5:15 to find the energy level jacked up several
notches, wih lots of dancing and a very good DJ (didn't catch his name). 
Everyone seemed to be hoping Jeno would show, but didn't (at least by the
time I left).  Ran into Derek, who smiled benevolently.
  "They don't dress as brightly as the hippes did," said my wife with a
dismissive sweep over the crowd.
  "Maybe it's just the overcast sky," suggested Derek.
  Highlight: a fellow with a ring in his nose hawking candy and
irridescent roses from a holder slung around his neck like the old
"cigarette girls" devices they used in night clubs in the '40s.
  Poor taste: a dude with a supersoaker squirting the ladies in a pathetic
attempt to get attention.
  But all in all, like, groovy, man (I never left the 60s.....)

Anyone have references for a good ** reliable ** inexpensive mail
drop, preferably somewhere between Mountain View and Redwood City, tho
SF would be OK too?  Do any of the bigger mail box outfits (Mail Boxes
Etc for example) rent boxes without needing ID or a name for the
owner?

Anyone have references for a good reliable inexpensive voice mail
outfit?  Would want to pay cash in advance for three months, low
volume, probably less than 10 calls / month.

Any references / experiences / companies to stay away from would be
greatly appreciated, a good friend asked me for this info, and as a
newcomer to the area myself, I couldn't really help him.

Please email direct to one of the addresses below, no need to flood
the list... (and apologies to all who consider this an inappropriate
posting, I think that an important part of rave culture is the
determination to keep good things available to all, regardless of the
law...)

Damn! I knew I should've posted before taking that nap! ;^)

After 1-1/2 false starts, we proved beyond doubt that nobody outvibes
SFR -- that was a GREAT (if wet) party!!!  The third-eye-mounted
you-know-whats were standard equipment this time. There wasn't an
unfriendly, no eye-contact, bad attitude face in the house -- unless you
count that Berkeley cop who briefly joined us, but even he was won over
in the end by our vibe and once again Geoff's powers of charm, logic and
persuasion ;^)  THANX, GEOFF!!!

Music was great -- Moonpup turned in a strong set against fierce odds
(like a slippery slipmat), as did Lee, Jon D., BLURrrr (wish he could've
played longer.)  Too bad we missed a chance to hear Pat's acid jazz set,
but as breakfast was a no-show (you guys gave up on us for 16th &
Harrison???  How could you?! ;^) and the equipment was fighting a losing
battle against moisture, we were forced to bail at 8 am. Scott Hardkiss's
set at Charter Oak was first-class too, what little of it I heard.

Made lots of cool new friends last night -- the SoCal crew (Tamara,
Joachim, Dana, and Bryan), the East Coast contingent (Inhuman, Taylor,
Dave (?) from Mindvox in NY), the Davis faction (Laine, Matt, Tim, and
Roxanne) and a couple of recent non-netter transplants from New
Hampshire, Lee and Michael who've plugged right into the SF scene. And
some locals, Betsy, Ravi, and ... ? (I'm know I'm forgetting a few :( )

Joachim and Dana's insanely huge undulating bubbles rank among the best
visuals I've ever seen at a rave.

Having 27 of us invade the IHOP afterwards for breakfast was a stroke of
poetic terrorism par excellence! They never knew what hit them (namely
Susie's goopy slime...)  Then the ENDLESS group photo session...

My only criticism was that we probably should have changed the info line
before leaving the city -- unfortunately Gregg didn't know the secret
code to do this. We might not have lost Pete, Mike, Zak, Julie and many
others, although we possibly made the Marina a safer bet by delaying the
announcement (even that's open to debate...) I am *so* glad I finally
had a chance to experience that most excellent site (even if the view of
the bridges and city was fogged-out :( ).

BTW, after expenses we raised on the order of $200 for Malachy's
recovery -- Brian will have the final tally later.  Thanks for pitching
in, everyone! And thanks to the hard-working crew, especially Brian, for
perservering and not cracking under pressure, and most of all...

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SFR!!! <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

You are the most beautiful virtual community on the planet, along with
our cousins across the country!

P.S. I think we should organize a role-playing workshop so Geoff can
transmit some of his skills to us. I tried my best to apply his
technique at Charter Oak, but only seemed to made the situation there
worse :(. Of course, it seems they already had it in for that place...

P.P.S. Laine - make sure you e-mail me your address, net and postal.

	Malachi's operation was a complete success, he is sitting

	He has gained 3 inches more sensation down his body!!

	So everybody keep sending him energy, it really is helping a lot!
	He says that he can feel all of the love that people are sending him.
	His parents have arrived here, unfortunately the apartment that
	we have is up too many flights for them so if someone knows of a
	ground floor apartment in a safe area near SF General please call
	Peace @431-2320.

	Also, if anyone knows about setting up trust funds,

Although I didn't make it to connection, I did
make it to GG Park for a few hours. It was a
well deserved outing for me as I'm now 4.5 months
pregnant (I *don't* get out much these days).

We had a brilliant time!!

to see so many people hanging on, despite the drizzle and the cold,

The GG Park party seemed to pick up right where Connections2.0 left
off.  Where Connections was a intimate and magical family gathering, 
the GG Park party was a spiritual tribal affair.  The Vibe was 
incredible, with all of the best elements of the SF house scene present. 
A strong contingent of sfravers added ammunition to an all out luv
phaser war from which no one was safe.  

It was set up closer to the street in full view of public.  What PR!
Curious bystanders seemed mesmerized.  One very straight-looking couple 
with a young boy put their blanket down next to us and just soaked it up.  
I indroduced myself to the father and asked him what he thought.  Looking
over at the field of dancers, he seemed to be hypnotized, "I like it." he
simply said.  They stayed for 2 hours. An eldery impovershed-looking man 
pushing his cart full of bottles and cans hits a bump sending it crashing 
to the ground.  Immediately he is smothered by ravers who rush to his aid.  

Maybe it's just the beginning of Spring, or maybe it's the beginning of 
the next step in the evolution of the entire Universe.  Whatever it is, I 
am convinced that the special spirit of the SF rave scene is well 
established and is here to stay for a while.  

What a weekend!

well i have a radio station that is going up in power  in about 10 min
so this will be short, 
im sure in some not to distant time i will be typing in a long rambnling
posts on my feelings about c2
but until such a time

all i have to say is that that was the hardest i have EVER tripped in my life
and probably the longest considering i really didnt get to come down
until i collapsed back in irvine

i mean i was almost at the point of completely losing touch with reality
so i wasnt always quite at teh point of dealing with people 

which is funny cuz, with nothing against the event itself,
it was everyone there who i met and just all the sfravers who made
it such a fantastic trip

im still surprised i didnt see any visuals

god, i love you guys





but im still not going to give up the fact that ALL the sfraves i have
been to have been busted :)			(well two, but still...)

Subject: UHF/Portland

Well, the Big Event in Portland last night was a bit of a letdown, but
no surprise in that really.  It was in a converted warehouse in southeast
Portland near the river that used to be the Euphoria live music place
(later went through many reincarnations such as sports bar, under-18 dance
place, etc.).  It's got carpets all over the place and an old disco-type
dance floor with the multi-colored squares.  Kinda hard to imagine raving
in a rec-room for us hardened vets of the SoMa plywood acres ;-)

I was working late so I didn't arrive until about 3:30.  only caught Markie
who spun through til just after 5, so I can't report on Bones or others
(if they were there).  Jeno was smart and stayed in SF, I gather -- better
to save him up for a better event.  Markie was noodling along when I arrived
but flew up to cruise altitude around 4 am, so I got in a good hour plus
in The Zone.  Right at 5 he quit, then did a short ragga-oriented encore,
and that was it.  The afterparty moved over to Park Ave but I wasn't into
waiting for some kind of spark to light there after my last couple of
relatively uninspiring trips there.  

The crowd was about one-half rave vets and about half college-type partyers,
from what I could guess, but everyone was mellow in that typical portland
way.  No booze being served.  

A pretty good time overall but frankly, m'dear, I'd rather be at the Marina.

Ok, who is responsible for the XXX message that was on the Voicemail line this
morning? And the different message that is currently (as of 3:30 pm) on there?

And while I'm asking questions? How did the SFPD manage to find the Orig outdoor
location and the mappoint before we did? Hmmm???? Somehow I'm beginning to think
sfraves is far too public an organization to hold an illegal rave.

Hey!

Does anyone know about a Rave party in Miami, Florida on Saturday 
March 20th?  I have heard some people talk about it, but nobody here
knows the exact location.  I sure would appreciate any details!

Thanks!

        Well, after a stop in Cleveland while Dulles airport tried to 
figure out how to get their runway lights working again, I'm back in 
mundane ol' Washington, DC.  It's hard to believe that about 18 hours ago 
I was looking out over San Francisco bay, dancing with all my new sfraver 
friends.

        I started out the night taking a bus down Haight St to CalaFoods 
with a friend who wanted to see what raves were like.  We got there and 
got our little instruction/direction cards.  A friendly guy offered us a 
ride there (sorry, I can't remember your name now!).  Once we got there, 
there were cop cars outside and the rave was getting shut down.  
Bummer... I quickly spotted Susie, though and got introduced to all you 
sfravers.  From there, Mike gave us a ride to CalaFoods and then to the 
Berkeley Marina where the rave was being moved.

        We got there and everything was already set up!  That was fast!  
I was expecting something along the lines of the FMR, which took hours to 
set up.  After some initial problems with the needle, things got 
moving.... "And away we go!"  That was some cool hip-hop style stuff at 
the beginning.  I liked it.

        After an hour or two, though, I got really tired and went and sat 
down on Susie's blanket.  I didn't know I could fall asleep with my head 
on my knees, but I did for quite some time.  When I woke up with a sore 
butt, it was light out and this song that I had heard at the FMR was 
coming on and I liked it a lot.  I got up and I was really cold and 
started dancing.  I got really warm quickly and immediately fell into the 
vibe.  I wish this had happened earlier, but there was a nice stretch of 
about an hour where I was so blissfully happy...  Joachim was up on this 
hill making giant bubbles.  Seagulls were flying around.  It was so foggy 
and misty.  It was really wonderful...

        And then IHoP afterwards... That was fun.  Who would have thought 
those pancakes could have tasted so good?  What a cozy morning....  You 
SF ravers really have it together.  It's going to be hard to go to 
anouther hardcore east coast rave after that.  I guess the only option is 
to create our own scene... there's some promise of evolution.

        Thanks Mike & Brian for the rides!  Thanks Mike again for the 
vision tapes which I am eagerly looking forward to.  Thanks Chris for the 
Renu-You which will brighten up the sunshine microrave here in DC.  
Thanks everyone for your company and smiles and hugs and stuff!  
Hopefully I'll make it back out there again sometime!

....sorry for the massive cross posting, but I'm too egotistical to only 
send it to one list.  :-)

> Just thought I'd try to be the first to post....

Damn!  I knew I should've posted before taking that nap!  ;^)

After 1-1/2 false starts, we proved beyond doubt that nobody outvibes
SFR -- that was a GREAT (if wet) party!!!  The third-eye-mounted
you-know-whats were standard equipment this time.  There wasn't an
unfriendly, no eye-contact, bad attitude face in the house -- unless you
count that Berkeley cop who briefly joined us, but even he was won over
in the end by our vibe and once again Geoff's powers of charm, logic and
persuasion  ;^)  THANX, GEOFF!!!

Music was great -- Moonpup turned in a strong set against fierce odds
(like a slippery slipmat), as did Lee, Jon D., BLURrrr (wish he could've
played longer.)  Too bad we missed a chance to hear Pat's acid jazz set,
but as breakfast was a no-show (you guys gave up on us for 16th & Harrison???
How could you?!  ;^) and the equipment was fighting a losing battle against
moisture, we were forced to bail at 8 am.  Scott Hardkiss's set at Charter
Oak was first-class too, what little of it I heard.

Made lots of cool new friends last night -- the SoCal crew (Tamara,
Joachim, Dana, and Bryan), the East Coast contingent (Inhuman, Taylor,
Dave (?) from Mindvox in NY), the Davis faction (Laine, Matt, Tim, and
Roxanne and their delicious water-bottle) and a couple of recent non-netter
transplants from New Hampshire, Lee and Michael who've plugged right into
the SF scene.  And some locals, Betsy, Ravi, and ... ?  (I'm know I'm
forgetting a few  :( )

Joachim and Dana's insanely huge undulating bubbles rank among the best
visuals I've ever seen at a rave.

Having 27 of us invade the IHOP afterwards for breakfast was a stroke
of poetic terrorism par excellence!  They never knew what hit them (namely
Susie's goopy slime...)  Then the ENDLESS group photo session...

My only criticism was that we probably should have changed the info line
before leaving the city -- unfortunately Gregg didn't know the secret code
to do this.  We might not have lost Pete, Mike, Zak, Julie and many
others, although we possibly made the Marina a safer bet by delaying the
announcement (even that's open to debate...)  I am *so* glad I finally had
a chance to experience that most excellent site (even if the view of
the bridges and city was fogged-out  :( ).

BTW, after expenses we raised on the order of $250 for Malachy's recovery
-- Brian will have the final tally later.  Thanks for pitching in, everyone!
And thanks to the hard-working crew, especially Brian, for perservering and
not cracking under pressure, and most of all...

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SFR!!! <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

You are the most beautiful virtual community on the planet, along with our
cousins across the country!

P.S.   I think we should organize a role-playing workshop so Geoff can
transmit some of his skills to us.  I tried my best to apply his technique
at Charter Oak, but only seemed to made the situation there worse  :(.
Of course, it seems they already had it in for that place...

P.P.S.  Laine - make sure you e-mail me your address, net and postal.

It sure was a wacked up weekend.  A local clothing shop here threw a garage
party.  Some straight-edgers sprayed pepper gas on the crowd and almost
started a stampede.  A friend had trouble breathing, she had the liquid all
over her face.  Thankfully, we found out who did it and had a chat with their
parents (the two of them were underage).  They're going to be banned from all
future events.  What really bothered me is the fact that they call themselves
"straight-edge" yet did such a violent act for no reason.  Hypocrite bastards.

Then the cops came a few hours later.

Pig: "Party's over folks, get out."
Me: "What is the reason?"
Pig: "THE PARTY IS OVER."
Me: "Is there a reason?"
Pig: "Are you going to get out, or am I going to have to haul you off to
jail?"
Me: "What's the charge?"
Pig: "Disorderly conduct."
Me: "Asking questions is disorderly conduct?"
Pig: *dirty silent look*

Later

Me: "We're any warnings served tonight?"
Pig: "We do not have to give a warning."
Me: "Yes, but that is not what I'm trying to establish.  This officer just
stated that you haven't been here previously tonight, but you just stated this
is your third time here.  When I file the complaint, I would like to know if
any warnings had been served."
Pig: "We do not have to give a warning."
Me: "Yes, I realize that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE A WARNING.  But DID YOU GIVE
ANY WARNINGS TONIGHT?"
Pig: "WE DO NOT FUCKING HAVE TO GIVE A WARNING!"
Pig in car: "Do we need to take someone downtown?"
Pig: "No, we've got some sort of illiteracy problem here."
Me: "What is your name officer?"

The jerk hesitated then gave me his name.  I'm writing a formal complaint
today.  I've never dealt with bastards on that level.  I nearly thought the
guy would billy club me just for asking him questions.

Yeah, so the night got off to a slow start...I got to Charter Oak just in time to see Brian getting his ID taken down by our friends in blue (actually five cars worth...you'd think they were busting a crack house...do i smell bacon??)..anyhow,it was good to get a chance to say hi to everyone hanging outside the warehouse...so myself and the never-say-die possee went to lyons, downed gallons of coffee, and finally dashed off to berkely in fits of excitement...yeah, the marina is great place..too bad we lost a bit of the crowd  by the time things got going, but it was great..we had the tent set up, but it was such a high just watching people grooving in the morning (strobe) light that i opted to get wet over hiding from the rain...john and moonpup, the only ones i can remember spinning, were cool, of course...also the huge bubbles floating around were great--little orbs of shimmering colors floating in and out of our dancing madness...all in all a big hug/pat on the back to Br!
ian for not giving up on the night
 and making things go on....till the end...peace

Hm, glad to see everyone's really pleased about
Connection... I thought it was interesting, but I can't
really say I was super-psyched about the affair... 

I guess that in general I think we can do better... we
should've had back-up locations planned in advance to avoid
the necessity of things like re-grouping at Cala Foods.
If we'd gotten the word out a bit more smoothly about the
changes then we might've gotten more than 100 people and
$200 dollars for Malachi.  

It would've been cool if we could've left some personnel
behind at each abandoned location sending people on to the
latest connection.  I know it's kind of a lousy job, and
Ravi put in quite a bit of time on this, but a friend of
mine showed up later at the beach, and she says she just
wound up hanging around with a bunch of other lost ravers.
I imagine the problem at Charter Oaks may have been worst...
someone else was tellig me they "woke up someone sleeping
inside who was really pissed" trying to find out what was
going on. 

A detail I found confusing: I wanted to give someone the
info number, but it turned out that for some reason the
sfraves number in Derek's latest list is out of date.  I'd
never realized it, because I didn't really need the
info number, myself.

fuck.  I wanted to be at CII so bad, and did alot to try and be there, but
it wasn't to be.... my karma must be real low...

It looked good on Friday when Mark and I had headed over to the site just to 
hang out and chill when we ran across all the sfravers who were gonna check
it out that night.  We hadn't checked mail or anything, just coincidence.  We
said hi and left since we had already been there for about 2 hours hiking and
stuff, but felt the energy of the next evening looming.  We were psyched.
So Saturday rolls around, no word from anyone, and Mike and I head out for the
site at around 10pm.  We park at the bottom of the hill and walk up only to
find out that it has been canceled, head over to the Charter Oak warehouse.  I
told Mike that I knew it'd be busted, but what the hell, let's go.  We called
everyone we knew and told them about the fiasco and headed over.  Got there,
saw all you friendly types, felt psyched and hung out for a little bit.  I
left to go pick up friends, come back, and the place is crawling with cops.
We leave, go to a friends house, call the number, nothing.  It was getting late,
like around 2:15 or so, and we HAD to go somewhere, if you know what I mean.
So we went to Love American Style.  Oops.
Scene was all gangster.  Bare chests, tattoos of dead homies's names, all that
shit.  Not too negative, just intimidating.  Saw Pete, cooled it with him for
awhile, and just got rocked out by the Dj lineup.  Packed like you wouldn't
believe, and HOT.  Had fun anyway, despite the 20 buck throwdown.  Place shut
down at 6:00, and we went to go eat.  I then went home and slept....
woke up at 1:00, went to the Park, saw Niels and Jackie hanging out, no music.
Talked and relaxed.  Didn't actually move a dancing muscle the entire afternoon.
Music started, was good, Carlos is so cool.  Saw Taxi and kicked it with him 
for the rest of the day until 5:00 when it was drizzling and I wasn't really
in the mood for moisture.  What a cool event!  i will go to this always.

Well, I hope it works out better for everyonenext time.  I vote for Bonny Doon
all the way for whatever comes next.

We got to the golf course at 4'ish and found out that Connection got
moved or cancelled.  Next we hit 16th & Harrison which looked to be
populated by bad-ass kids and fading fast, so we decided to chill and
then go to Afterlife at the DNA.  Afterlife was fun, good tunes and
a good crowd.  It started getting crowded around 9 and we split for food
around 11.  Dropped by Marx Meadow but found it wet and empty.
Maybe next time...

Quick summary: (I'm still recovering, so I'll leave the gory details
to someone else...)  Due to rain, the location was shifted to Charter
Oak.  Mark was concerned, but thought that we'd be OK if we kept
things pretty small.  Well, we had set up and Scott Hardkiss had been
spinning for a little less than an hour, the vibe was pretty strong,
and then the cops came.  They were pretty unreasonable.  Two things I
heard were "anyone left inside in 30 seconds will be arrested" and "we
have to decide if we're going to confiscate the equipment or not".
Both without any legal legs to stand on, it seems, too.

In an amazingly organized fashion, the planner type people and the
hardcore went to Cala Foods, the original map point, in the Haight and
discussed options.  The Berkeley Marina was settled on pretty quickly,
mainly due to a desire to get the f*ck out of SF county.  The hotline
message wasn't updated until we were there and set up and knew things
would happen...

and happen they did!  Excellent sets from Moonpup, Lee and Blur, lots
of different styles of music and all, and Jon Drukman deserves a medal
of DJ honor for spinning for about 40 minutes with one turntable (!)
while someone went to get a needle -- Jon also dealt with the worst
part of the rain, it seemed to me.  It seemed that everyone had
exceptional willingess to just deal with the situation and have a good
time.

"Boy, it's starting to sprinkle a bit.  Shouldn't you guys shut down?"

"Ahhh, yeah, we'll probably shut down if something blows up."

I had a great time, and great to see some of you again, and meet
others of you...  (and I really love to think that we now have a **
great ** spot that's unused for the next event!  one nice side effect
of all the activity)

well hello all...i'm haing an absolute blissful time here on the west coast..
i could talk for hours.. obviously.. but, this post is about the rave last
night.. my first west coast rave..


like my usual rave posts..it's hard to sum it up.. and remember it in one
piece...

but...compared to the skating rink, warehouse , etc.. raves out east this one
was....

outside
in the rain (blisssss!!!)
in a clearing
near a hill of flowers


on the coast...

with rocks and waves... and fog.. and fog beeps (sorta like a fog horn.. but
it beeped)..

it was rather beautiful...

the music really wasn't very different than what they play out east..like i
thought i would be...there was no hardcore.. and no breakbeat...

just trance.. (.lots of beautiful trance) and housey trance.. and progressive
house...the music was amazing....all djs i have never heard before...

john drukman, jay (?), dave kelly.. and moonpup....wow on all of those guys..
wow.
wow.
wow.


it was a small, totally underground (and illegal) rave...witha  small
turnout...cozy small.. a couple hundred tops(?)..

i met lots of sf-ravers and experienced much of the same big happy family-
ness that we have out east...everyone was realllllly cool.. and i was very
happy to meet you all..you really made my visit completely worth it...now 
there are more friends, more faces to login names.. and well.. more love all
around...

the rave in the rain was so nice..i've always loved rain...and this was just
so magical....

mm..

well.. i don't wanna take up too much space here.. and it's hard to sum it up.
comparisons to east coast raves would be dumb.. 'cos it's just different..
no better..no worse.. just different..i had a GREAT time...


here's leah to say a few words:

god do I love the marina.... it makes me so happy.... 

I was happy to begin with -  I knew that no matter what, I would have a 
great time.  after all, look at all the wonderful people I got to meet.  
to start out with, taylor is here, which is wonderful in itself.  and I
finally got to meet joachim, inhuman, dana, tamara, bryan, blur, susie,
derek, ovid, (uh oh - I'm having trouble remembering everyone) and I got
to see so many people I hadn't seen in forever (hi and *hugs* to all and
I'm sorry if I forgot lots of names... brain damage =)  meeting and seeing
everyone made the night.  then we went to the marina.

it was so amazing to see everyone working together and setting up and being
a family - I love that.  no one grumbled, everyone smiled... =)  the music
was fantastic.  jon started things out right (what a guy - he can make things
happen with only one turntable! =) and played some soooper dope shit.  then
moonpup came on and totally amazing stuff (taylor thinks he's great).  then
it was lee and oh my god what the hell can I say about that set.  all the music was great, but it was his set that completely blew me away.  the trance just
took my brain out fucked it all up and put it in backwards.  it was the
perfect music for that time period- I had amazing energy (anyone else notice
that?=) and I was sooooo happy.  (I couldn't dance much in the beginning but
that was when I really got going.)  all I can say is wow.  thank you... and
dave spun some wild stuff - it's just too bad he had tsunami action on the
turntables.... I still loved his music.

the rain was funky and the fog was soo cool too.... we couldn't even see the
city.  I found out that I am insane (hee brian =) but in a good way.  I like
that.  when it was over we all piled into the ihop on university.  there were
28 of us... it was so much fun!!!  we really are one big happy family... it
made me feel all warm... then I got hyper and we all know what that means.
(hey, anyone want a rooti tooti shake yer booty? =)  it was sad to say good-bye
to everyone, but I know I'll see you all again.

again - sorry to any one who I met and didn't mention....  and to everyone
who I did see and talk to... *hugs*  *****BIG HUGS!!!***** (heh joachim =)
I love you all!

always, leah



taylor back here:

this is getting WAY long.. but.. i just wanted to end by saying thank you
to everyone, especially brian, for setting htis uop... and introducing me to 
the sf rave scene.  i really loved it.. and i REALLY appreciate your friendli-
ness and love and it was just great..

thanks again...really.

:)

love to everyone..

hugs to everyone..

and east coasters.. come out here and check this out..

:)


peace.

Subject: Lurker No More

A kindly thanks to MykL G for outing me. He's right tho, I did get lost
between Charter Oaks and the Marina, but I met some folks at C 1.99
briefly, too briefly. I'm a recent (and hopefully not temporary)
transplant from Chicago -- where my husband must stay until we save
enough money to move -- so I'm really looking forward to many days of
happy dancing to fill the empty space inside. I promise not to lurk any
longer if you promise to dance with me till dawn.

urg.

After shgowing up at ten and being informed that we were not using the 
legion beach anymore, zak and I scurried (after making a billion calls
to tell poeple to go to Charter Oak) to Charter Oak and enjoyed it
for awhile...I guess it is safe to assume that some cop is on the new, or
at least getting the calendar...I wish they would quickly get a life and 
start busting bull shit parties like the one we ended up at (we ddin't
know that conection was moved....we called the number but at that time 
tehre was no change...we went to Love American Style, more aptly
named Hate w/Attitude Bile...more gangster kinds than ever...what is
the deal?  When I was 14 I couldn't stay out all night...
lame lame lame
sound was good...space was trippy, but I was too bummed by all the nasty
kids glaring at me for some reasn or another...about a million kids
wtih little blinking red lights too...jeez...

anyway..I hope all had a good time whatever they did...
Apparently the AIDS danceathon raised over a million dollars in five hours...
my friend was all up on that...I was thinking what some real ravers coould
raise in one NIGHT...

grumpy and bumpy in a finals week,
mike

this has to be the best rave i have been to since i got back from NYC during
winter break...  the energy was so intense that even non-ravers could not help 
but be mesmirized by it..  (much like that Berkeley police officers that came-
are you are out there> thanks for keeping the vibe alive)

the light rain was great.. it was just so refreshing having that misty rain 
cool you down.. and it was a good thing we got out of SF b/c i heard it was raining much harder out there...

i had a pretty nightmarish time getting to C2 too.. i went to the Beach site
in SF first and i was totally lost..  i must of spent 1.5 hours there just looking for it..  it was lucky i ran into a few fellow ravers who directed us the right way..  if you are reading this- thanks for making the night possible..
so it was back to Berkeley and i did not arrive there until 2:30..  i was
at first drowsy but as i neared the site, my adrenaline started pumping as that
music starting getting into my head..  i was zooming on the vibe and music 
before i even got to the dance area...

what made this rave so special was the people i met.. it was my first chance to meet so many SF Ravers..  I like to extend my greetings and gratitude to Leah,
Brian, Mykl, Derek, Cindy, and Pat..  :)  = and to all those i cannot remember.
just those happy, smiling familiar faces that will be forever etched in my mind.

keep the vibe alive...

We definitely got the last laugh on this matter.  Devin and Greg went and
looked up the ordinances for Salt Lake City regarding the way the police are
supposed to react to a party.  THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SERVE A WRITTEN WARNING
BEFORE RETURNING TO BUST IT UP.  Keep in mind that the cops were telling us
that it was completely optional.  I've written a complaint and the people who
threw the garage party have written one as well.

We've got a copy of the ordinance to keep by the door now.  I wouldn't be
surprised if San Francisco (this is republican Utah we're talking about) has
something similar.  Go to your local library and look up the ordinances!
There's nothing a cop hates worse than someone who knows the law better than
they do.

Pick up a recent copy of Streetsound and look in the back.  There's a big full
page ad for it.  Utah Saints, 808 State, Ian McCullough, Stereo MCs, House of
Pain, Rage Against The Machine, DJ Dmitry, Keoki.  Rumor has it that MTV will
be there too.  WHOOP DE DOO.

   I'm going to be up there in the Bay Area after tomorrow and was 
wondering if anyone can point me towards any deep house/garage undergrounds

beginning of next week?   

If you've ever been in San Diego I'm looking for something ala Club 555 --
the only place for house in San Diego.

Subject: ** C2 tape announcement **
Reply-To: boccibob%groovy@us.oracle.com


** Connection II cassette ordering info **

DJs: Scott Hardkiss, Jon Drukman, Moonpup, Lee, BLURrrr

345 minutes (almost 6 hours!) of music on 4 BASF cobalt + (type II)
tapes, recorded with Dolby HX pro.  Mastered direct from the mixing
board to DAT at 48 khz, then professionally duplicated, boxed with a
full 4 color insert card and shrinkwrapped... suitable for gift
giving...  :-)

There have been some very strong reviews of the music played at this
event...  and the master DATs sound great.

$5 from each set will be donated to Malachy, a SF rave promoter who
was involved (as a passenger) in an automobile accident after the last
Full Moon Rave.  He has extensive hospital bills and no insurance.
The DJs have agreed to the release of this material with the
understanding that $5 per set would go directly to benefit Malachy.

To order, send $25 cash per set, in a security envelope or wrapped in
carbon paper to:

Bob Ramstad
P.O. Box 390931
Mountain View CA  94039-0931

Include a LEGIBLE return shipping address on a separate piece of paper
inside the envelope.  

If you have email access and would like email verification of the
receipt of your funds and email status updates, send mail to
c2%groovy@us.oracle.com like this:

Subject: tape order

1 set
jane@likethis.nyc.ny.us
Jane Raver

The address given ** must ** match the shipping address included with
the payment.

Wholesale inquiries (purchases of more than 20 sets) can also be sent
to the PO box above, or emailed to me at boccibob%groovy@us.oracle.com
(preferred) or rramstad@us.oracle.com.

For everything to work out right, it's ** imperative ** that you place
your order as soon as you can... if sufficient orders are not received
by April 15th, I may be forced to refund everyone's money and withdraw
this offer.  

Professional duplication and printing takes time, and also have
minimum quantity requirements.  The tapes will be shipped out by the
end of May at worst, and hopefully earlier.

I look forward to hearing from each and every one of you!  Peace.

actually the after party will be awesome, for anyone on the list that 
might be in town for this..  the after party is at soundshock from about 
4am-noon..  djs will be kimball collins, dave cannalte and a couple 
others..  soundshock is 804 1st street in miami beach..

kimball will also be spinning at divine playground, so it is probably 
worth the $20 just to hear him..

sven vath, the guy who runs harthouse records, is spinning too, and while 
i am not a fan of much hardtrance stuff (except hardfloor) he could get 
interesting..

actually the after party will be awesome, for anyone on the list that 
might be in town for this..  the after party is at soundshock from about 
4am-noon..  djs will be kimball collins, dave cannalte and a couple 
others..  soundshock is 804 1st street in miami beach..

kimball will also be spinning at divine playground, so it is probably 
worth the $20 just to hear him..

sven vath, the guy who runs harthouse records, is spinning too, and while 
i am not a fan of much hardtrance stuff (except hardfloor) he could get 
interesting..

Pete, sounded like a horrible way to end a good party.  but also sounds as
if you will have the last laugh, and that's because you were strong enough
to stand up for your rights.  way to go.

I understand that this weekend, Ascend was harrassed by the
cops on the 2AM closing rule, while Love American Style was
somehow immune from this.  What was the problem, couldn't
Ascend afford the protection?

Review #25 Contents:
Compilation 1
Psychick Warriors ov Gaia: Obsidian
From Our Minds To Yours Vol. 2
Drome: Anachronism
D-Shake: Nite & Day
Exquisite Corpse: Reassembling Reality
Probe Volume 1
Vicious Vinyl Techno-Rave Compilation


Compilation 1
Project Style: PK 08/01 (FAX +49-69/450464)
1   5   07:45 Deltraxx: Altered States (Unfused & Tuned)
2   4   06:39 Limelight: Limelight (Holy Guitar Mix)
3   4   06:07 Subsequence: Invocation (Dance 4 Trance Mix)
4   5   06:17 Hearts of Space: With a Medium Into Trance (Drop Out Mix)
5   4   06:07 SynSyl: Breakout II
6   5   05:23 4Voice: Music Hypnotizes (Hypnotizing Mix)
7   4   08:27 Escape: Escape to Earth
8   4   06:36 Sextant: Drug Oriented Society
9   2   09:49 Silence: Santur

Comments:  One of the oddest compilations I've purchased.  It looks as if
someone named Pete Namlook in Frankfurt gathered several of his favorite
producers together and thus put out a compilation of his favorite music.  The
whole package is very homebrew, but what is amazing is the fact that it
contains an astounding array of trance.  Probably the best use of etherial
vocals I've heard is presented by Deltraxx.  Limelight and Subsequence aren't
too shabby with the medium either.  All of the tracks manage to stay trancey
with a driving rhythm, except for "Santur" by Silence which is more Arabesque
ambience.

Summary: 9/10.  Namlook states that if they ever has to compromise, he'll shut
down the label.  I'm anxious to see what the future brings.


Psychick Warriors ov Gaia: Obsidian
Kk-Records: KK090mcd
1   4   20:31 Obsidian (Deconstructure)
2   5   06:09 Patience (First Step)
3   4   08:49 Challenge (Kala Mix)

Comments: PWOG starts to worry world record holders The Orb with a twenty
minute remix of "Obsidian" from their album, "Ov Biospheres and Sacred
Grooves".  Nothing really new in style here for the Warriors.  Exemplrary
tribal rhythms with a slow as tar buildup is what the title track is about,
and it sure feels good.  "Patience" ironically jumps into the groove
relatively quick, and as a result comes off as the most pumping track on the
single.  Last "Challenge" is immediate, but a lot deeper toned than
"Patience".

Summary: 9/10.  I'm not sure if Cargo has picked this up domestically, but you
do get a lot of time with this single, even at an import price.


From Our Minds To Yours Vol. 2
Plus 8/Plus 8 Europe: PLUS8022CD
1   4   06:16 Speedy J: Spikkels
2   3   05:46 Psyance: Gates of Heaven
3   3   05:13 V.F.T: Location
4   3   04:24 G-Man: Bio-Fidelic
5   2   07:24 F.U.S.E: Xntrik
6   4   06:38 V-Room: V-Shaped
7   5   05:53 Gary 7: Let The Circle
8   4   05:03 Sysex: Dallas
9   5   04:07 Sysex: Fever
10  3   04:31 Cybersonik: Red Alert

Comments: A slight improvement over Vol. 1.  I especially enjoy the tracks at
the beginning.  "Spikkels" is the best out of the lot, Speedy J has definitely
shown that his trance is better than his hardcore recently.  "Gates of Heaven"
is simplistic, but moderately nice.  "Location" is deep and moody, its rhythm
line is almost out of place though.  Things start to turn with G-Man though.
Random bleeps, pounding beat, and nothing new, sort of a transition between
the beginning trance to the ending hardcore.  The rest of the tracks are
fairly standard Plus 8 hardcore.  Gary 7's "Let The Circle" is very ripping
with a beat that threatens to bust cinderblock.  Closing things off, Sysex
gives a large hunk of sampled _Alien_ in "Dallas" which leaves you wondering
what their motive was.  "Fever" is fierce, but reminds me a lot of Moby's
harder stuff.  Last "Red Alert" by Cybersonik is pathetic, must have been
thrown together in an afternoon.

Summary: 7/10. There are a few better tracks than Vol. 1, but there are two
tracks in particular which are just lame.


Drome: Anachronism
Pulse Soniq: SR9224
1   4   05:27 Optimism
2   4   06:55 Dreams
3   3   06:41 9to1
4   5   06:15 Drugs
5   3   05:39 Target
6       00:52 Tele...
7   2   04:00 Scanners
8   2   06:24 Disposition
9   3   04:03 M.O.B.
10  3   05:45 Anachronism
11  3   04:28 Shy
12  4   05:10 Information
13      00:55 Optimism

Comments: A very dark, pulsing album from another band who looks like
Sprockets.  Much of Drome's sound is rehash, endlessly repeated soundbites
which seem to lend any relevance to a theme.  Where they especially excel is
in their sculpting of noise into perfectly fitting additions to clockwork-like
rhythms.  The first track "Optimism" and "Dreams" are more upbeat than the
rest which mainly stay in a darker ClockDVA realm.  "Drugs" is especially
interesting in moving from a bleepy trance into some serious hardcore.  The
latter half of the album really sags from hypnotic into bland.

Summary: 7/10.  If you like ClockDVA, you'll enjoy this.  There are also
elements similar to Aphex Twin, Biosphere, and PWOG.


D-Shake: Nite & Day
Go Bang/Sonic: SNC-2011-2
1   3   05:39 Club Mix
2   4   06:34 Hardcore Mix
3   4   04:52 Supersonic Mix
4   3   05:45 Knight at Nite Mix
5   3   05:40 Speedub Mix

Comments: The problems with kids these days!  Look at the crud they're
listening to.  Seriously, this is formula techno at its worst.  This stuff
makes me especially nauseas due to the fact that a particular local club DJ
will grab garbage like this and play it for the next six months repeatedly.
The mixes don't help either.  D-Shake isn't as bad as some groups I've heard,
but it is a real wool-over-the-eyes miracle that someone thinks they have
enough talent to press several releases.

Summary: 2/10.  Not terrible, just not good.  D-Shake doesn't have an
innovative bone in their body.


Exquisite Corpse: Reassembling Reality
Kk-Records: KK029CDS
1   4   11:08 What a Life
2   3   07:15 Anxiety
3   3   08:43 Traditional Ties With Dreaming
4   3   08:49 Honeymoon

Comments: A very surprising piece of work.  With the name and the shoddy
cover, I was half expecting gothic grunge to come wafting over my ears.  What
I found instead was highly hypnotic, at times beautiful, with a deep
undercurrent of rhythm.  Exquisite Corpse is very similar to label mates
Psychic Warriors of Gaia, except it is more upbeat, but also at times too
repetitive.  It is a fine line between hypnotic and boring, Exquisite Corpse
falls on both sides.  "What a Life" is the best piece with two minutes of deep
chords as an intro to a uppy, dancey, trancey melody, overlaid with different
variations on the theme.  "Anxiety" and "Traditional" tend to annoy with a
sudden sharpness in instrumentation that seems out of place here, but are
still mostly good.  "Honeymoon" is musically the most bland of the four, but
uses a Native American storyteller to good effect.

Summary: 8/10.  Tantalizing stuff, I'd like to see what else they come up
with.


Probe Volume 1
Probe Records: pro11
1   2   07:06 Circuit Breaker: Open Your Mind
2   3   07:43 Up!: Spiritual High
3   2   05:14 Public Energy: Three o' Three
4   2   05:04 Spawn: The Thinking Man
5   2   05:24 Deko!: Panik
6   3   04:31 Dbx: Annexia
7   4   05:13 0733: Record Bass Story
8   4   04:34 Texas Audio: Assassin
9   4   04:08 Public Energy: Hemi-Sync
10  4   04:30 Spawn: Tension
11  5   05:06 Circuit Breaker: Trac-X

Comments:  Hardcore, you know the bore.  This compilation stands out as a
prime example of dicking around with synths in order to make something
releasable.  Although they could be credited with not using the soundbite
method of music production, they can't be credited for making anything
especially interesting.  Two of these tracks, "Open Your Miind" and "Assassin"
date back many moons to the 1000 Ohm! comp, I'd suspect that everything else
is similarly dated or leftover.  Still, Public Energy's "Hemi-Sync" has some
worth and Circuit Breaker's "Trac-X" is hard enough to overlook its
repetition.

Summary: 4/10.  I can't recommend this at all.  However, it isn't so bad that
I'm going to get rid of it.


Vicious Vinyl Techno-Rave Compilation
Vicious Vinyl/Sonic: SNC-2012-2
1   4   05:57 Vertigo Hypo: Hypo Rhino
2   3   05:57 Ground Level: God Intended
3   4   04:49 Astral Project: Come With Me
4   3   05:25 Aqua Labs: So Good
5   4   05:03 Eternal: Mind Odyssey
6   5   05:57 Tomorrow People: Blood Rush
7   4   04:54 Vertigo Hypo: Sinewave Express
8   3   05:25 Ground Level: Out of Body
9   2   06:14 Cosmic Transmission: Force Feel
10  4   05:06 Eternal: Eternal
11  3   06:33 Tomorrow People: Spain

Comments:  I guess I should have been wary of anything containing the title
"Techno-Rave", but this was on Sonic and all the music was from Australia's
Vicious Vinyl, so I figured the combination of the two would help a little.
Well, it didn't.  Although there are a few gems here, they aren't that great,
and everything else is in the standard clubhouse vein.  Tomorrow People is the
only name that could be worth looking into.  Vertigo Hypo's tracks start
promising, then rapidly die.  Only other track of slight note is Aqua Labs "So
Good" which uses the "You make me feel so good" sample AGAIN, but loses its
charm in a hurry.

Summary: 3/10.  Standard fodder for the "Techno-Rave" buying masses.

Hey All!

First, thank you all for making my weekend tremendous.
C][ was intense...a grounding experience.

<Interesting note:  A cop showed up at the original site
< at 9:30 to warn me that I was illegelly on Federal
< property...so we would've had trouble early on.

Anyways, did anyone go to the Sound Factory on Wednesday?
Well, how was it?  I'm just trying to guage whether it's
even worth checking out on Thursday.

Regardless, let's gruve it up in GGpark on Sunday!!
Until then,


Ravi

<Interesting note:  A cop showed up at the original site
< at 9:30 to warn me that I was illegelly on Federal
< property...so we would've had trouble early on.

I understand the kind of social conditioning which leads
to and leads us to accept such rules, but doesn't it seem
like sort of a bizarre concept that there's this land that
is called a "recreation area" (Golden Gate National Recreation
Area), doesn't belong to anybody except the people of this
country, and where we wouldn't be disturbing anyone or 
destroying the environment -- but a group of fine, upstanding
members of the community can't gather at night, play some
music, socialize and dance?

I understand that they don't want people vandalizing the
property and spoiling it for other people, or actual 
criminal activity going on, but isn't it strange to think
that there's this part of the Earth that is "closed".  I
can easily accept that somebody's home should be private,
but in this supposedly free country, isn't our freedom
severely restricted, when there are all these public lands
where you are NOT ALLOWED to be?  When positively-contributing
members of the society need a permit to gather in an     
isolated warehouse to play music and dance?

I don't want to get into all the other aspects in which
we're in a police state because of the War on Drugs or the
Cold War, etc. but this is an example of where we can't
do something which we would consider really, really basic -
even more basic than most of our Constitutional rights, 
since many of those deal with rights necessary within the
societal framework that already exists, and these issues -
the right to go somewhere, the right to be somewhere, the
right to assemble with people ought to be fundamental,
regardless of the social structures.

The problem with American "justice" is that it goes to the highest
bidder.  If you have sufficient money to hire squadrons of lawyers
you can get almost anything you want to happen.  Either that, or
you are lucky and/or persuasive and get people to help you gratis.

Notice that the Feds got slapped hard for messing with Steve Jackson
Games.  They figured that they could just do what they wanted because
SJG was too small to fight back, and they were -- but then Mitch Kapor
and some other heavyweights (their wallets are heavy, at least) formed
the EFF, and the tables were turned. 

That's the same reason SF cops mess with small, diffuse, cool events
like CII and leave the big promoters alone -- they have money and are
authoritarian enough themselves that they're not a threat to the
status quo.  Sadly, lawyer/revolutionaries like Bob Black who are 
willing to tweak the Establishment for the hell of it are rare.

We are talking about power here.  Right now, _they_ have it.  The ways 
I can think of to get power over the situation include money, prestige,
and mass action.  Anyone have any other ideas?

For Connection II cassette orders, acceptable forms of payment are
cash in a security envelope or carbon paper (greatly preferred), money
orders or cashiers checks.

Also, if you are interested in buying a set, it's really important
that you put your order in the mail as soon as possible -- most
likely, there will not be many "extra" sets made up for later sale.  I
will absolutely fill all orders received at the PO box before April
15th.  If I receive your order after April 15th, I may end up
refunding your money, though I'll try to fill your order.

I'm shooting for a tape shipment date of the 15th of May, so most
people in school should be able to use their school address.

I also think it's high time we found a lawyer to do some research, and
eventually challenge police actions in court.

Along those lines, there was just an annoucement on KALX (a ticket
give-away actually) of an all-night event Friday at 16th and Harrison
called Rhythm Empire, with Ernie, Tony, Josh and Buck.  Supposedly
it's a benefit to raise a legal fund to challenge the law prohibiting
dancing after 2:30 am by people under 21 (although there are obviously
loopholes in that law).  I don't have any way of confirming this.

Keep in mind that one main reason the cops enforce these arcane permit
laws is that the "legitimate" (i.e. alcohol-pushing) club owners paid
big bucks for their licenses, and have been known to pressure the city
into shutting down unlicensed events which they believe are causing them
to lose revenue.  This is the original reason Mayor Agnos formed his anti-
underground club task force in the spring of '91, hoping that the club
owners would reward him by supporting his campaign for re-election.

Komotion on 16th St (a performance venue, not a rave site) was closed for
several months until they went through the whole permit process -- after
over five years of unmolested operation.

Just another data point,

The only possible logical reason I can think of is liability.  
I think that the government has the right to protect themselves from
lawsuits which can happen if they allow "unsafe" (i.e. night 
time) activites to occur on recreational lands.   Of course, 
you would think it would be a simple matter to let us sign waivers 
or something.  Unfortunately, the day will come when the parents of
a young raver who gets hurt at an illegal rave will sue...

Liability again?  I don't know, it's pretty fucked up; questionable
laws are selectively enforced against harmless people simply
for the *sake* of the reinforcement of authority ==> enforcement
for the sake of enforcement.  It kinda legitimizes crime-for-the-
sake-of-crime, which is certainly *not* what most ravers ever 
intend to do.

        I think the key words in Derek's and Susie's posts were "without 
disturbing anyone" and "peaceably assemble".  Peace = Quiet, and we're 
anything but quiet.  Obviously, in most cases we actually AREN'T 
disturbing anyone because we're miles away from civilization, but that's 
the justification the cops use.  It's sort of impossible to argue 
against, because all the cops have to say is "It's disturbing my peace!" 
and that's justification.  Just playing devil's advocate to a certain 
extent.  I would encourage you all to go clear things with the police 
dept before hand, though, and have a backup site ready if they say no.  I 
mean if you explain it as a friendly dance party with no alcohol, etc, 
then they are likely to say yes.

I can confirm this, sorta.  I have recently become the "rave promotions
guy" at KALX and was the one behind this announcement.  I talked to the
promoter, who told me all about this "benefit".  Nothing about this is
mentioned on the flier, however, so I can't say exactly how much of the
proceeds will go towards this cause, but it sounds like a good thing.

If anyone has knows of any raves or related activities that could use some
radio promotion, email me or give me a call at home (510-549-6223).  

I'll be doing a radio show this monday night/tuesday morning from about
12:45am-3:30am.  I'll be taping the first 90 minutes of my show in order
to get approved for other time slots, so I'll have to go easy on the
acid-house (the show reviewers aren't too hip to it).  At about 2:15,
though, I'll be doin the mixin' thang till 3:30.  My only time to practice
is on the air, so go easy on me if I don't sound like Jeno.  The first
part of my show will probably consist of random weirdness (experimental, 
industrial, and occasional jazz or hip-hop).  
Also, if you're interested in winning tickets to Rhythm Empire, a pair
will be given away sometime tonight between 12:30 and 3:30am, and another
tomorrow during Nommi de Plume's show.

Finally, I'd just like to say hello to MykL, who I met at the pre-C2
party. Hello.  There, I said it.  Hope to meet more of you soon!

From: Seth Joshua Horvitz <acid23@uclink.berkeley.edu

I am a DJ at KALX Berkeley (90.7fm) and have just recently become the
"rave promotions guy" for the station.  The first promotion offered to me
is for RHYTHM EMPIRE this friday at 16th/Harrison (DJ's are Ernie Tony
Josh and Buck).  The lineup sounds decent, but not breathtaking.  The
promoter for this has told me that all proceeds from the event will go
towards hiring attorneys to "beat the law so that kids can dance past
2:30."  That includes everyone under 21 (myself included).  Sounds like a
good enough cause if its legitimate.  Does anyone know anything about this
rave?  KALX will be giving away four pairs of tickets tomorrow over the
air, so if you're interested, tune in!  And if anyone knows of any raves
which would like to be promoted on KALX, call me at home (510-549-6223) or
email me (acid23@uclink.berkeley.edu).  

Also, I will be doing a radio show this coming monday night/tuesday
morning from about 12:45am-3:30am.  My air name is Mescalina.  Please
listen and call me with requests! (510-642-KALX).  I will be taping the
first 90 minutes of my show so that I can get approved for other time
slots.  This means that the first 90 will not include that much
house-related stuff (the show reviewers aren't too hip to it).  I'll play
lots of weird experimental and industrial shit. Once the 90 minutes is up,
though, it'll be MIXMIXMIX (or an attempt anyway).

OTHER NOTES: I want to know why no raves ever START at the Marina.  It
seems like many people's best experiences have been there.  Does this not
make sense or what?  A friend of mine is hoping to throw a party there in
a couple weeks.  Also, I'd like to say hello to MykL and Derek, who I met
at the pre-C2 party.  After all those directions, I still couldn't find
the damn warehouse.  Never even found the 101 (pathetic, I know). Oh well, I
wish I had known about the move to the Marina sooner.  Hope to meet more of 
you people soon.  I would've stayed at the pre-party for longer,
but I had someone illegally parked waiting for me.  Oh well, next time...

It's not just beaches and warehouses either. Right before Bush left
office, some pretty nasty laws were being considered which
severely limited the rights to peaceably assemble in national forests.
It's unclear at the moment whether they will be pitched out by Bill, but
if they do go into effect,it'll be a real pain-in-the-ass for groups
such as Rainbow (members of which certainly aren't out to vandalize,
don't do *that* many illegal things and are definitely better for a
national forest than a bunch of weekenders taking the 4x4 out for a
spin). Rainbow has a pretty decent system for alerting the tribes about
these legal hassles and then organizing mass letter-writing campaigns.
If they can do it on a national level with some success, I'm sure we can
do it on a local level.

  Interesting little article in the paper yesterday:

     "  The California Supreme Court has given landowners broad
     protection from lawsuits by hunters, hikers and other people
     injured while using land for recreation.
        In a 4-3 decision that overturns numerous lower-court rulings,
     the high court Monday said landowners are immune from such
     personal-injury suits even if their property contains potential
     hazards and is not suitable for recreation.
        The court based its decision on a 1963 state law that created
     the immunity to encourage landowners to open their property to
     recreation."

  I don't see why this wouldn't apply to the government as well.  This
seems to open up lots of potential sites for use since liability isn't
as much of a problem. 

  Anyway, all the recent discussion of permits, curfew laws and what
not has moved me to go to the library soon and do some research.  We
are definately a political force to be reckoned with, so we might as
well network like one.  :)  
  If everyone were to spend a little time looking up the appropriate
local municipal codes restricting parties and dancing, we would have a
great resource and a better understanding of what we're up against.

more frequently than it should be.... they've been having disk problems,
but everything on the FTP site looks okay, except it appears we're missing
the archives from January.  If anyone had downloaded them somewhere and
has them, I'd really be happy if I could get them.  They will be backed up
on a safer site (floppies, maybe) very soon.  Anyways, I again encourage
everyone to use the sfraves@sfraves.stanford.edu alias instead of anything
else; this is the most reliable address around, and all the usual -request 
stuff goes through that too.

Anyways, my prediction for the weekend:

	Friday night looks kinda, er, dull.  I mean, lots of parties
happening, none that appear to be sure-winners but some possibilities.
"The Vibe" has a good history... and "Rhythm Empire" looks to be big if
that's your style, while "Ernie's Retro" appears to go the other way :)

	Saturday night could be better; there's a Wicked which are always
tres cool (and this I presume will be a benefit for Malachy) and Gemini
looks somewhat promising vibe-wise....

Raves HAVE started at the Marina, the first grop to use the Marina was the
FMR several months ago.   The key is to not piss off the cops.  Mostly
we have been able to convince the cops that we were a bunch of responsible
law abiding "kids" with enough "adult" (read old  folks) supervision to keep
things under control.  The main way we did this was by keeping the access road
clear and NEATLY PARKED and discouraging people from bringing alcohol which
will get you shut down QUICK!  If you follow those guide lines you most likely
won't have any problems.

Well here is the scoop:

First off DONT EVEN THINK that the WICKED posse has ANYTHING to do with
Mal's Recovery or recent attempts to raise money....While at a certain
meeting of all the BIG promoters in the area ALL the club promoters decided
to cancel their events on the 20th to do a benefit for Mal....There was one
samll thing...Wicked did NOT want to cancel AT ALL.  Everyone was kinda
dissed, but oh well.  When asked would any of the proceeds go to Mal, a rep
from the posse said , and I quote "No, the money is going toward a sound
system".  I am NOT going to draw any conclusions I will let you be the
judge.  Anyway there has been GREAT speculation in the community as to WHNE
this sound system will be purchased.  From another conversation I have heard
that their sound system will REQUIRE a $30,000 down payment in full, and
that they are no where near this goal.  I really never knew that you had to
put down so much money to reserve anything other than a HOUSE, but oh well.
More about Wicky and the big picture as things begin to degrade in SF...

On the list it is mentioned that Team Green happens each Sun...this is and
has not been the case for a while.  Team Green is gone, period.  I wish I
could elaborate, but I can't.

I am certainly staying home this weekend, and every weekend until, a good
party comes along...hope to cuwhenimthere.

Peace.

These are all events I have heard of over the net which in someway or
somehow celebrate the 50 years since the first bike ride of Albert
Hoffman.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
There's also going to be a show at 1015
Folsom featuring World Entertainment War, Crash Worship, and Robert Anton
Wilson doing a reading, on April 18th.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
8:00 PM, Saturday April 17, 1993
"Your Life Up To Now: The Debate on Composition"
MFA Thesis concert by Christopher K. Koenigsberg
free admission, reception following
Mills College Concert Hall
5000 MacArthur Blvd.
Oakland CA. -- between High St. & Seminary Ave., just off of I-580.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, without realizing it, I also scheduled my Thesis Concert, for my
M.F.A. in Electronic Music degree, on the night of April 17th, which I
presume is Bicycle Day? at Mills College.

So, if you're in the East Bay, come to a free psychedelic concert of
electronic music, modern dance, & a "Debate on Composition" woven into
the performance. Pieces include "Your Life Up To Now" conceptual work,
"LCM" for 12 piano sampler, "Basement Artifact" 1 & 2 derived from a
16-second noisy pump, "October Surprise" for HyperUPIC sound, a video
soundtrack, slide show study in yellow, & an attempt at techno-rave
dance mix production to close out the show.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I am in the midst of planning my spring weekends, and
remembered hearing here that the following events were
being planned but not yet finalized. Does anyone have
any further information about when and if they will 
occur?  	

1. Friday April 16: program sponsored by MAPS in SF or
Santa Cruz with speakers on psychedelics.
   Saturday, April 17: Related bicycle day celebrations.

2. Conference sponsored by the Albert Hoffman Foundation
in LA on LSD. Was to be some time in May.

Subject: Re:  a finals inspired flare

The long post from ianc is almost illiterate, defies logic, and truly
a bunch of crap.  As if raving sprang from nothing and can call itself
first generation.  

The truth is raving sprang from the bastard loins of  N'Awlins cathouse 
mothers and hermetic poet fathers.  (Matrilinear descent:  New Orleans
whorehouse mixes afro-creole traditions w/ eurogenes > spawns jazz > 
flappers >  hoboes > beatniks > hippies > yada-dada > ravers.
Patrilinear descent:  European hermetic traditions (Knights Templars,
alchemy, rosicrucians, onward) comes to America, mixes with noble native
traditions of absolute individual freedoms > add a dose of several centuries
of utopian experiments >  dose of Walt Whitman > German psychedelic
experimentation > Aldous Huxley > Resurgence of Native American Shamanism 
>  Xerox PARC  > MIT Media Lab > Techno-ravers.

Yo!  Ianc.  You're free to believe whatever you want.  You might want to 
do some homework before putting it out as gospel, however.  next time you
reinvent the wheel, do a patent search first.

Before the Orb went from playing buck's CHURCH to megamedia blitzes, there
was nothing but the rest of us f*cking in the primordial slime.  Thank gopod
raving sprung from cosmic lightning to show us mud suckers the way home.

peace, ianc.  there's a lot of warmth in this heart that's attacking
your flawed thesis.

After fighting off a nasty cold for the last part of the week, I decided
to shake off my cabin fever with Wicked on Sat.  The event left me with
mixed feelings.  On the one hand, Garth and Jeno put down one of the
best sets I have heard from them in a long time.  FUNKY.....  On the
other, tooooo many men with their shirts off looking for a fight or a
girl on X.  I guess I'm a little sensitive to these types since I am a
little taller than most and they seem to want to bump into me a lot
trying to start something.  There have always been a number of SM
(Shirtless Men) at any gathering, but there numbers are growing....
People have complained lately about various things that are killing the
vibe- mine is the growing number of SM.  I hate to generalize or classify
anybody, but the Gangs of SM are becoming to much to bare (no pun).

Well, about the good things at Wicked.  Met a couple from Seattle who
are on the net, hello Glenn.... Hope you had a great time in SF.  The
suprisingly low alcohol consumption....  Clear and loud sound system....
But HEY WHAT HAPPENED TO HATS.....?????  One of the things I love about
raves are the different hats...  Where have they all gone?

Afterwords, went to 1015 Folsom. Definately worth checking out.  Anyway,
hope everybody had a good weekend.

Subject: ** C2 tape announcement **
Reply-To: boccibob%groovy@us.oracle.com


Ah, good question...

Jon Drukman started out the Connection II Berkeley Marina set with a
bustin' tune ("Ampex alignment tape... begin at 700 hz"), after about
5 minutes, he attempted to mix to the other turntable, with a hashed
needle (!)  Really cool skating sounds followed.  Jon then DJed (for
lack of a better term, he only had one turntable) for another 28
minutes until the emergency needle squad arrived on the scene...

Precisely, there were gaps of 15-20 seconds between songs for about a
23 minute period (from the end of the first non-mixed song to the
start of the last non-mixed song, which ends one side of one
cassette).  To evoke the memories of being there, the first song ends
in about 5 seconds of skating noise, followed by 5 seconds of silence,
then the second tune.  Subsequent non-mixed tunes (again, about 28
minutes worth) have less than 1 second blank space between them.  I
decided to do it this way rather than remixing everything together
because I wanted the tape to be a somewhat accurate reproduction of
what happened (I hate "live" albums which are overdubbed, and it would
be weird to have remixing done after the fact) but the long gaps are
really distracting and so I made the listenability tradeoff of short
gaps between songs.

It would have been easy to make the decision to not include the
non-mixed portion of Jon's set -- but the tunes were absolutely
killer, and when 'with much rejoicing' the first tune blared out of
the (relocated) sound system, everyone was way stoked, so these tunes
evoke some of the best memories I have from C2.  Consider these 33
minutes as 'substance over form'.

This is the prospective layout:

1A  Scott Hardkiss 44 minutes
1B  Scott Hardkiss 11 minutes + Jon Drukman 33 minutes no mixing

2A  Jon Drukman 42 minutes + Moonpup 3 minutes
2B  Moonpup 45 minutes

3A  Moonpup 38 minutes
3B  Moonpup 17 minutes + Lee 21 minutes

4A  Lee 45 minutes
4B  BLURrrr 45 minutes

All sides, except for 1B, are unbroken and completely as played at C2.
All sides in order represent ** everything ** that was played at C2
except for about 10 minutes of Lee's set where there was so much water
on a record that it was skipping (!)  The splits onto cassette at this
point are fairly set in stone, I've listened to them extensively, and
this will give the best result aesthetically.  Yeah, I know, it would
be cool to have each DJ restricted to a side or a whole tape or
something, but there's no sane way of doing that -- I've already
looked at it.  Part of the problem is set lengths -- none of the DJs
did a nice 30, 45, 60, or 90 minute set, except for BLURrrr, and he's
all nice on a side by himself.

Also, one more thing: sets are $25, but if I get enough orders, I'll
probably be refunding a few $$ per set.  This cost is based on a
really low minimum number of orders, which I've already gotten :-) and
a small run of tapes costs more per tape than a larger run of tapes
(Professional Duplication 101) It'll be a bit longer before I can
ascertain if there will be enough orders to make it economically
feasible to do 4 color insert cards -- doesn't really make sense
unless I get 100 orders or so -- but as this would be one of the more
fun parts of the project, I'm hoping.

Send me email if you've been living in a bubble and missed the
ordering info, it was posted all over the place last week :-)

What did you think about that blown subwoofer on East side of the dance floor. 
I think someone finally pulled the plug later that night on it.

interesting point about the family tree that lead to "rave"...
but what about the rave-elements that sprang from
	(1) juke joints (from which early extemporaneous rapping occured,
	    including "dissing" and "nasty lyrics" and other rap precursors.)
	(2) Underground black disco/funk in the early 70's.
	(3) Reggae Dancehall Culta / Reggae Dub (e.g. Lee Scratch Perry).
	(4) Gospel and gospel/dance inducing group trance states.
	(5) Jazz/Speakeasy 20's underground culture (afterall, not everybody
	    was a flapper).

so wait, what's this benefit for Mal on the 20th???  And all other raves
that night are cancelled?

According to one of the DJ's scheduled to play at Wicked, the party is 
indeed a benefit for Mal (which would make sense, since the driver of the
van that crashed is also the person behind Wicked, so the two are 
inseperably linked. The "Wicked" sound system was also mauled in the
accident.)

More info... more info....

These are all events I have heard of over the net which in someway or
somehow celebrate the 50 years since the first bike ride of Albert
Hoffman.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
There's also going to be a show at 1015
Folsom featuring World Entertainment War, Crash Worship, and Robert Anton
Wilson doing a reading, on April 18th.

8:00 PM, Saturday April 17, 1993
"Your Life Up To Now: The Debate on Composition"
MFA Thesis concert by Christopher K. Koenigsberg
free admission, reception following
Mills College Concert Hall
5000 MacArthur Blvd.
Oakland CA. -- between High St. & Seminary Ave., just off of I-580.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, without realizing it, I also scheduled my Thesis Concert, for my
M.F.A. in Electronic Music degree, on the night of April 17th, which I
presume is Bicycle Day? at Mills College.

So, if you're in the East Bay, come to a free psychedelic concert of
electronic music, modern dance, & a "Debate on Composition" woven into
the performance. Pieces include "Your Life Up To Now" conceptual work,
"LCM" for 12 piano sampler, "Basement Artifact" 1 & 2 derived from a
16-second noisy pump, "October Surprise" for HyperUPIC sound, a video
soundtrack, slide show study in yellow, & an attempt at techno-rave
dance mix production to close out the show.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I am in the midst of planning my spring weekends, and
remembered hearing here that the following events were
being planned but not yet finalized. Does anyone have
any further information about when and if they will 
occur?  	

1. Friday April 16: program sponsored by MAPS in SF or
Santa Cruz with speakers on psychedelics.
   Saturday, April 17: Related bicycle day celebrations.

2. Conference sponsored by the Albert Hoffman Foundation
in LA on LSD. Was to be some time in May.

Subject: ASS_U_ME The final chapter

 
First, it was not my intent to imply that the reasons behind Wicked of
Sat 3/20 were not pure at heart.  All that was said is that there was
confusion and questions being raised as to exactly what the event of
3/20 was all about.  Whether it was for Mal or the Sound System... the
case is closed on that subject, although MANY are still asking (of those
that attended) the intent.  Well you can't please everyone...
 
As for the purchase and use of the sound system, GREAT.  Finally a
public statement has been made to the intent and NOW it can be
communicated to all concerned how the system is to be used and to what
end.  Really though, this should have been made public a while back, or
at least some attempt made to communicate to the general public who
support Wicked and FM, for these are the people who should know how
things will be done once the goal of the sound system becomes a reality
(I consider myself one of those people BTW).
 
The reason why this whole subject was brought up is due to the  continual
lack of caring that some party-throwers (i.e. promoters/crews/posses)
have when sponsoring an event.  This place is becoming more and more
like LA (due to many unscrupulous  LA promoter types moving in, but
there are others in SF as well), and when people have questions about a
party that on the whole represents the BEST of the SF scene then it
behooves us to think about why we are going out and who, in the long
run, does it serve.   Does it serve to enhance the community or is it
cash lining the pockets of a  promoter?  When these questions arise
about parties that are respected then communication needs to be
increased/enhanced so that confusion can be avoided. In the case of
Wicked this is particularly important since they have created a public
trust, and a public goal of obtaining a sound system to be enjoyed by
all. They were NOT being singled out for the sake of being
mean-spirited (I have defended this scene's clubgoers/DJ's/promoters
publicly in URB a few weeks back so...).
 
I must add (yes, I MUST), that the primary reasons for staying home this
weekend had nothing to do with parties.  It is always better, in my
estimation, to spend time with family than going out, period.  Being
with my wife and child is the ULTIMATE vibe :)
 
I am glad that this dialog has taken place.  I am glad that Wicked
responded and hope that they communicate this info to the rest of the
community if for nothing else than to ease some confusion.  I know I
will do my part.   For confusion when left unchecked creates distrust. 
And in a climate of distrust we become more and more like other scenes
which have since left the planet.
 
MORE later...
 
Peace.

I just called the UP3 info line, and they reported that tomorrow (21MAR)
rave in the park was cancelled at GG Park, and will instead be held at
People's Park in Berkeley.

Any truth to the rumor?

Golden Gate Park is BIIIG... 25th and Fulton is a bit more specific,
but if I go there, will I definitely see / hear everything?

1 pm -> sundown, right?

Later on,

You can just head into the woods at 25th & Fulton and you're sure
to hear it.  Or you can take the 25th into the park, bearing right
until you hit a stop sign at JFK blvd.  Make a right, and about 
1/4 mile on yer right is will be Marx Meadows.  That's where the
party is.  The official start time is 11:00am, but 1pm is a good
time to arrive.  See ya there.

"I mean if you explain it as a friendly dance party with no
alcohol, etc, then they are likely to say yes."

NOT IN SAN FRANCISCO.  If you try that in SF, they well go
"Is this a RAVE?!" and shoot you down.  SF is now a rave
hostile town.  

I find this mildly ironic, since SF depends on tourist
money, raves are now being written up in guide books for SF,
and the city is currently engaged in chasing some of it's
nightlife outside the borders...

I've been wondering if the SF Chamber of Commerce might be a
useful ally.

My friday night went as follows:

First, my girlfriend and I went into the city to see the Festival of Short
Films at the Palace of Fine Arts.  Some rich bastard got the bright idea
to rent out the Exploratorium for a private party, complete with cheesy
all-cover song band (I caught 'Surfin USA' on the way to the car), so the
Film Festival was cancelled.  We hung out for a while, went to eat
dinner, and decided to check out RHYTHM EMPIRE, since we were on the guest
list.  So is this what $20 raves have become?   I hadn't been to one in
several months, and I don't think I'll be going to another any time soon.
The space was OK 16th/Harrison}. There were two separate rooms with
dj's (Buck and someone else I didn't recognize) but not really enough
people to fill either room.  And the people... ahhh, the people.  The
perfect blend of teeny boppers and boys standing against the wall with
their hands in their pockets watching the teeny boppers.  Flyers were
posted everywhere for 'Birth of the Sun' and a moving sign made of little
red lights flashed "RYTHYM EMPIRE" (note the spelling).  The music was
decent, but the vibe was nonexistent, so we danced for 10 minutes or so
and left.  The whole time we were there, I kept thinking 'what if I had
actually PAID for this?'   

Warning: the same people who were responsible for this disgrace are
throwing "The Birth of the Sun" tonight, so unless you REALLY want to see Mark
Farina, I would recommend finding something better to do.

	Dear All, 
		We need to clarify the content of John Lee's letter.

	Firstly, Malachy is a very close friend to all of us at Wicked and the
thought that we're not concerned about his recovery we find extremely abhorent.

	There have to date been two 'Promoters' meetings. At the first, the
idea of holding a large event to raise money was dicussed. A date of April 17th
(Not March 20th or April 20th) was put forward. There was some indecision at thetime because Wicked were the only ones who had a large event planned for that
day to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Albert Hoffmans first bicycle ride.The possibility of a different date that would be amenable to all was raised at
the second meeting. The date of May 1st was suggested (to coincide with the
Whole Earth Expo - a day when the Healing Community gets together) but the 
venue to be used was unavailble for that day. So it was agreed by ALL that 
Saturday 17th April would indeed be the day to hold the benefit.

	In regards to the purchase of a sound system - the total cost is about
$30,000. This includes 4 full-range cabinets, 2 sub-bass cabinets, amplifiers,
cross-overs, graphic equalizer, monitors, cables, and casing. On top of that
we now have to buy two new turntables and a van due to the crash on Monday 8th
March. As anyone in the business will know, the purchase of professional sound
is not cheap.

	The sound system is to be run as a viable business concern to provide
a quality of sound we feel cannot be obtained from other rental companies. This
will enable us to continue to put on free events such as the FMR, as well as nowbeing able to secure a regular income for Malachy long into the future.

	We only needed to throw two more parties to realise this, but we are
now set back two months as the proceeds from Wicked on March 20th will be going
to Malachy and the April Wicked has been cancelled.

	As for Mr. Lee, it is probably better that he stays home this weekend,
but, if he would like to come to next promoters meeting he'll be more able to
accurately report the proceedings.

	Yours with love and peace,

				     Markie and Jeno   :)

Well, I'd also like to know if GGP will be moved to People's Park in
Berkeley -- or at the least, could someone mail directions (to me or
to the list) to People's Park (from I-80), so if I go to GGP and it's
not there, that I can find it?

Thanks much,
Bob

PS Assuming I get directions to People's Park, regardless where it
ends up happening, if you want to order C2 tapes from me in person, I
should be at the event, that would be pretty painless... I'm shooting
for having the tapes ready in late April, but not sure yet, it could
slip to mid May pretty easily, depends on how many orders I get.

Man, this sucks.  That makes 2 weeks in a row I was about to go hop on
a bus only to find out the event had been moved.  Thanks for posting
this, Niels!  

Hey, I might head down to Marx Meadow anyway, maybe with a radio.  Anyone
in the mood to hang out for a while?  I'm sure lots of people (who
didn't call the info line) will be there... maybe even the sound
system will show up! :-)

	Yup, People's Park!  The authorities are giving my friend a hard time
with the permits to hold it in Golden Gate Park.  Last week, after the party
was over, the police tried to tell him that the party was unauthorized.  The
park police said that the permit that he had purchased should not have been
sold to him for such an event.  They basically have changed the type of permit
necessary to hold such an event, and that new type of permit costs $$$$$$$$$
Them greedy !#$&#!!  Anyway, until he is sure what he will do next about this,
Shaun plans on holdin it at People's Park in Berkeley.  The park isn't as
attractive as GGP, but is all we need to start the right energy 8-)
It will be good to show them telegraphians what happiness is all about!

	Dear All,
		We need to clarify the content of John Lee's letter.

	Firstly, Malachy is a very close friend to all of us at Wicked and the
thought that we're not concerned about his recovery we find extremely abhorent.

	There have to date been two 'Promoters' meetings. At the first the idea
of holding a large event to raise money was discussed. A date of April 17th
(Not March 20th or April 20th) was put forward. There was some indecision at the
time because Wicked were the only ones who had a large event planned for that
day to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Albert Hoffmans first bicycle ride.
The possibility of a different date that would be amenable to all was raised at
the second meeting. The date of May 1st was suggested (to coincide with the
Whole Earth Expo - a day when the Healing Community gets together) but the venue
to be used was unavailble for that day. So it was agreed by ALL that Saturday
17th April would indeed be the day to hold the benefit.

	In regards to the purchase of a sound system - the total cost is about
$30,000. This includes 4 full-range cabinets, 2 sub-bass cabinets, amplifiers,
cross-overs, graphic equalizer, monitors, cables, and casing. On top of that we
now have to buy two new turntables and a van due to the crash on Monday 8th
March. As anyone in the business will know, the purchase of professional sound
is not cheap.

	The sound system is to be run as a viable business concern to provide a
quality of sound we feel cannot be rented from other companies. This will
enable us to put on free events such as the FMR as well as now being able to
secure a regular income for Malachy long into the future.

	We only needed to throw two more parties to realise this, but we are now set back two months as the proceeds from Wicked on March 20th will be going to
Malachy and the April Wicked has been cancelled.

	As for Mr. Lee, it is probably better that he stays home this weekend,
but, if he would like to come to the next promoters meeting he'll be able to 
more accurately report the proceedings.

	Yours with love and peace,

				     Markie and Jeno   :)

Look,  I understand if they had a change of heart...In this case I would
hope so.  I hope that every penny they collect goes to Mal, and I mean every
penny.  None of this 10% shit, I mean 100% should go to Mal (sans the sound
rental, space costs...DJ should be FREE!).  I do know what was said at that
meeting of the areas promoters.  And I can only go by that...if they have
changed their mind in some way then things will swing back towards the
positive.
 
As for "..got something to say say it" :{  I said everything I wanted to
say.  This SCENE, when examined close enough can be a GRINDER.  Promoters do
NOT want to cooperate with each other, and in reality it is nothing but
egos, egos, egos.  Maybe I am too close (which is likely) to the shit not to
smell the stink sometimes, but overall I do remain positive about the
possibilities.  I mean CII and other parties thrown by the newer "kids" are
examples of what the scene can be about,,,connection.
 
I will NEVER name names, because I am not a name dropper.  I know enough
people, and respect enough people that I would never use someones name just
to validate what I say.  Just as I would never use anyones on the nets name
to validate what I say.  Let's just call it a qualified confidentiality.
I do NOT have anything against wicked, except that it is increasingly
difficult to see that the people who want to throw parties have a hard time
getting SOME of the DJ's on that lineup because their primary thang is
wicked...fair enough for the DJ's and wicked, but what about for the scene.
Music should be shared universally...there should be no ONE gathering place
to hear the sounds, and the quality should always be top notch, no matter
how many people are on the dance floor, no matter where the fucking party
is, no matter if there are other "star" dj's or just some starter DJ's, it's
about a feeling, not the FAME.
 
If I know something, I will post it.  If you know who I'm talking about,
fine, if not then don't worry a name is just a name, the scene is too
special for any ONE personnae, so get off of the naming names tip.  Just
worry about where the next party is, and if your friends are going, and if
you'll be able to catch a positive vibe with them.  Beware of cheap (ala
many mega-raves) imitations...either it's got the spirit, or it's shit.


Peace...

speaking of which (and time for a little self-promotion)... Silent
Records is releasing a double-CD compilation to coincide with this
event, provisionally entitled "50 Years Of Sunshine."  The reason I
mention it is because there will be an otherwise-unavailable
Ultraviolet Catastrophe track on it.

Dig it, kiddies.

Warning: the same people who were responsible for this disgrace are
throwing "The Birth of the Sun" tonight

I have heard rumors that these same people are the one responsible for getting
the others like Groove Kitchen and Ascend shut down.  Is this just a rumor,
Know the commericial attitude of this space I wouldnt be suprised.

Think about it, lets say they have some pull in getting the others shut down
(payoff to the police, etc..)  Then a few weeks later they hold a rave saying
that proceeds will go to lawyers to allow to prevent this from happening.  I
doubt very seriously that any of this money goes to lawyers.  Do any of you
remeber the First Walley World Flyer?  This was the first time this space was
used and they said there was going to be rides and $10 before 10.  Well if any
of you have been there you know that there is no way they can fit rides in that
building.  Probably less than half of the people who get there before 10 get in
free especially since they dont start letting people in till 9:30-9:45 after a
thoroug search, which is probably to slow the line down even more.  The more I
think about this space the more I get sick to my stomach what these guys are
doing to the scene.

  Not wanting to believe the story about the park rave being moved to

people hoping against hope that the rave would materialize there. Too bad
-- it was a lovely day.
  Anyone go to People's Park?

	The reason the Park hotline began was to make it unnecessary to guess
of the location of the party.  The person who's voice that you hear on the voice
mail is the same person who puts together the party.  So, whatever he sais on
the message IS the place where the party will be.  There is no possibility that
the sound system would just show up at Golden Gate Park when the message said
that it would not happen there.  The reason it didn't happen there was because
the authorities changed the type of permit necessary to hold such an event.  
Trust the message!  (415) 749-7670

  	Hopefully, future parties will be held back at the original location at
Golden Gate Park.

happy equinox, spring is here!!!!

Depends on which ride you mean. The actual first bike ride was one or two
days before the 19th - Hoffmann accidentally dosed himself. The 19th is the
anniversary of the first *intentional* LSD ingestion.

Subject: a finals inspired flare


     I found a good quote in a computer rag today::

     "The first generation learns from experience;
      the second generation receives by inheritance;
      the third generation expects convenience;
      and the fourth protests nuisance."

      Apply this to raving. The emergence from underground. The bad but
   fecund rave acts. The total lack of rugged individualism in raves that
   PREACH a 'Love,Unity,Peace' focus. The missing rebellion from those
   mindsets that miss that raving in a sweeping away of the old as much
   as making a future. We are not here to fight issues. We mock issues
   as being media-made. We scare your parents. We dig a/the generation gap.
   
   There are no roots, no genders, no races, only a technological cressendo
   that by eliminating toil, eliminates issues/differences.

   Stop being so flaccid and politically correct Mr. Rave. You're not
   a "community" (totally loaded word for conflictionist sociology),
   your the son of middle-class nerd boredom that realized western
       ^e  ,that is OUR, culture is the basis from the next revolution.
   The information revolution that bring to the notice of those
                                  ^ we
   too passive or too stodgy or too ignorant will change the nature
   of society (insert favorite logrithmic change quote here) and put
   the altrusim and lack of difference except through differentiation
   behavior of humanity on a high density monitor in 32bit clarity.

   Raves are as much conspiracies as parties. Few understand them.
   The young can feel the pull; they will respest us only if, by
   being first generations, we keep away from culturual ideaolgy
   (namely hippie) and instead imbue them with power.

    A raver should pirate, hack, mock, be liberal ("information wants to be
    free") but not radical ("Unity amongst the Unwarshed"), that is, 
    understand what is the fat-of-the-land and exploit it. 

    Too nerdy to be cliquey. Too white-collar crimed to get burned.

    Realize cos we're at the outset of this revolution, we must stay
    1st generation. Minimal inhertance. No convience. 

   this tends to describe a sfraver actually... except for the hippie bit,
    uh-huh, like it's non-toxic.

ianc flame-off.

    oops. didn't finish one point, it's that "Realize 'cos" paragraph.
  We being first will have children more into raving than we will ever be.
  Aprreciate that.

went to deep faith on thursday.  james from tweekin was kicking it
hard - most enjoyable.  the jon williams came on and continued to kick
hard - also most enjoyable.  then the hardkiss bros came on and...
kicked it hard again!  out of character for them, but (as the man
sez)... most enjoyable.  all in all, a most enjoyable time.

i blew off friday nite, although a formidable contingent of sfraves
scenesters (including Pete Ashdown, on holiday from the confines of
Salt Lake City) dropped by Ultraviolet HQ to check out our setup and
hear some great music.  nice to see y'all.

saturday - wicked, of course.  markie mark was laying down a trancy
vibe when we got there which might not have been too smart considering
the hour, but i didn't mind that much.  i expected the place to really
get packed and uncomfortable after 2, but surprisingly, it didn't.  in
fact, it remained at a crowded-but-not-uncomfortable density for the
entire evening.  it was sweaty on the dance floor, but never really
unbearable.  i was pleasantly surprised.  garth really cut loose with
some severe funky stuff - and he kept the disco to an absolute
minimum, so i was a truly happy camper.  go garth!  jeno was also a
master of the funk, with a very very low jazz factor, which also
brightened my day.  not that i mind acid jazz, but i find that i
prefer to sit down and listen to it, rather than dance.  being
chemically unassisted, i split at 6 AM and didn't get to hear what
thomas is up to these days.  can someone enlighten me?

on sunday, we heard via the grapevine that golden gate park had been
nixed and people's park would be taking its place.  this sounded
rather unappetizing, so we decided to have a mini-picnic in golden
gate park and bring along a boom box and some mix tapes.  we saw a few
ravers, informed a few inquiring ones that the rave was happening over
in berkeley (typical reaction: "oh darn."), and even hooked up with
sfrave mainstays Mykl G and Giamma for a while.  so, a pleasant day in
the sun with some grooving tunes and a classy picnic lunch (baguette,
brie and pate).  not bad, but i would've liked a more booming sound
system.

Subject: Re:  RE ASS_U_ME

Thank you for the clarification.  I think that THIS type of thing needs to
be done every now and then for ALL concerned.  Not accusing the wicked posse
of anything of course, but there have been valid questions raised as to tyhe
proceeds of the party and how things were to be run AFTER the sound system
was purchased.  MAny have thought that FREE parties were going to be thrown,
many thought that the money was to go to another purpose.  This does not
need to be the case.

All promoters concerns are their own, but when stated publicly that
something is to be done some type of clarification as to how things would be
carried out, I think, is in order.  This has been the FIRST time, to my
knowledge, that and actual policy has been stated.  And I am glad.

As for Mal, I am truly sorry for what has happened to him and his
circumstance.  I have done what I can (made a video for him of his friends
saying hello and get well wishes) for him, and supported some of the events
where I have known that the proceeds were going to him.  I wanted to go out
tonite, but this weekend turned out to be a bad time all around.

I was told that the event (wicked) tonite was at first, for the purcahse of
the system, then later it was communicated that the event was a benefit for
mal...a bit confusing to say the least.  What I see happening is that some
promoters will use Mal's name to promote their event, for this type of
exploitation is NOT uncommon.  I think that IF promoters are going to do a
benefit on his behalf then they should explicitly state what portions of the
proceeds go to him...especially since the economy is so underground, and
many of the organizations are NOT business entities.  There are many waiting
for a chance to bust these eveits for any reason.  ANd considering the
status of some of the scenes citizenry this can be hazardous (who need the
IRS or the INS involved).  Therefor to keep things honest and for protection
of ALL involved things need to be as expolicit as possible to avoid
confusion and chaos.

No I did NOT attend the last meeting, but someone was there in my stead.
I kept the conversation limited to Mal and the sound system for these were
the things that MANY on the scene are/were confused about.  And I only
raised questions that many were asking amongst themselves.

As for concern about Malachy's health and well being/recovery there was
nothing in the origianl post that said that the posse was NOT concerned.
Just that there were questions as to what tonite's event was all about, and
who it was for...plain and simple.  Most people know that the "promoters"
are getting together to throw a large benefit for Mal.  It was not my intent
to say or imply that you/group did not care.  If you read the post you would
clearly see that.  But whenever things are not clearly stated, and one thing
is said while another is done, then it can lead to confusion...which by my
estimation you have created order out of such chaos.

Well, I'm done.  Now it's time to go out get a couple of beers, smoke some
J, listen to Garth's new tape, and chill out until next week.


On a side:  I have TRIED on several occasions to contact dy-na-mix.  They
have YET to return my calls.  I will try again...if you are still interested
that is...let me know.

Peace.

Hey Patrick, I got your message and I'm looking forward to going to a rave in
Vancouver.  There's one small problem, though.  I thought I'd saved your 
letter to my folder, but when I went to retrieve it, it wasn't on the scene.

So I don't know how to contact you.  (I called information and found that 
there are FOUR P. Luis in Vancouver.)  Could you please send your phone #
and info abt. places where I can find fliers to srfrrosa@leland.stanford.edu?
This is a friend of mine who will be here over break.  I'm leaving in two hours
so I'll have to call her tomorrow (Saturday) and check to see if she's heard 
from you.

(MyklG, if you see this, could you send Patrick's e-mail address to my friend,
just in case Patrick doesn't see this.  Then she'll try to mail him directly.)

					Sorry about this,

						Scott

Subject: ASS_U_ME response..


I have already mailed Markie and Jeno a response, so I'll be brief.

As for the 'charge' that I insinuated that the wicked posse didn't care
about Mal, no such assertion was made.  The only assertion is that minds
were changed but it was not clear, aat least from my viewpoint and of others
that I know, what tonite's event was about.  They have NOW made it clear.

As for the soundsystem of wicked, to my knowledge this is the first time the
intentions have been made in public clearly to a wide audience.  And in my
assertion, long overdue.  The only point of the whole series of postings was
that there are many grey areas within the scene, some less so than others.
Wicked began putting out flyers with a stated intent.  Sometimes notes were
made on the flyers as to how well there stated goal has been going.  But
more often than not the info was sketchy at best (how much can you put on a
flyer).  But the info about the business entity portion of Wicked (i.e. the
stated intent as to how the system would be used) was NOT so well known.
Maybe now it will be.  All that I am saying, and justifiably so since many
who go to wicked respect what they do, is that IF a promoter has a stated
goal for throwing parties and is relying on the public to fulfill that
promise, then they OWE it to the public to let them know the status of such
a goal, AS WELL AS what will happen after the goal has been reached.  Wicked
so far, are the ONLY people who have had such a goal and  stated it
publicly.  I am not being mean spiritied when I ask that the info be
revealed on some level.  I would hope that GREATER atempts at communicating
with their public can be done in the future. This would avaoid all chaos and
miconceptions.

As for staying home this weekend, I did for the most part because I needed
to chill out after  a long week.  Parties generally don't influence these
decisions, but family does.

I think overall this has been constructive and I hope that others will voice
their concerns about what THEY  see as a problem or a potential problem.  We
all know there are great parties, so-so parties, and downright awful ones.
If communication is kept flowing it an only enhace the scene and make it
better.  This should be especially so with those indiviauls/organizations
who have garenered a certain level of respect within the community.

Peace...and MORE later.

(BTW I will be at the next meeting =)

Am I the only one who actually went to this thing?  I live less than a
block away from People's Park, so it was just a short stroll.  Got there
sometime after 2, and there were probably about 100 or so people there. 
The dj was good, although he seemed really nervous.  There were only a few
people dancing until about 3:30 or so, when things started to pick up.  A
different dj had come on.  Not sure who he was, but he played a wide
variety of things, most of which was heavily based on soul and reggae.  By
4, there were several hundred people, and a big crowd dancing.  I'd never
seen People's Park this crowded!  I was actually having a pretty good
time, although I kept looking at my watch, wondering if Garth would show. 
He finally came on about 4:30, so I was happy, until 5:15 that is, when he
threw on a Bob Marley track to end it.  5:15??? The sun was nowhere near
setting, and I was definitely not done dancing.  Oh well, I guess I
couldn't expect too much from People's Park.  Hopfully it will be back in
Golden Gate soon...

Subject: my weekend in review

Hello all,

Here's my update to this weekend.  I barely have time to read all 
the mail that goes through, let alone write something.  So, here 
goes; my first real posting to this list:

I also want to thank everyone for giving their opinions and 
updates on different events, as they have helped me in making 
decisions as to where to go.  

In the past three months since I have been on this list, I think I 
have attended 80% of the raves around town. (sorry, I got lost at 
C2).  One of the recurring themes is the dislike for club-type 
places.  I now know what those feelings are like, based on my 
experiences as well.  I hate those organized-rip-off-the-people-
with-$20-cover-charges-let-me-search-your-body places as well.  
They're too stressed!  However, for some strange reason I like 
going to Sound Factory once in a while.  I went there Friday night 
and although the crowd was mostly interested in showing themselves 
and finding the right boy/girl to take home, there were areas on 
the floor where people seemed to be truly interested in the 
dance/rave aspect of it.  I mostly hung out in that area and once 
in a while ventured out to get water, etc.  The sound system is 
awesome, the lighting effects are cool, and the DJs can spin.  I 
had a good time with some of the friends I went with and others I 
met there.  I am curious if there are others on this list who like 
going to SF as well?

Anyways, Sound Factory was fun, and we left at 5am and headed for 
Smiling Thru.  Geez, I wish more people would attend.  It was 
pretty dead as we crashed on the couch in the front room waiting 
for more people to show up.  I thought the donation for Malachy was 
a nice gesture.  I don't know who he is, but from everyone's feelings 
towards him, he seems quite a great guy.  I wish him the best and most 
speedy recovery.  Back to ST.  The music was great, but I was too tired 
to move a muscle.  One complaint tho', there was so much of that smoke 
stuff in the main area, I could hardly breathe and had to walk out every 
now and then for air.  I wish they wouldn't smoke everyone out like that, 
'cause it lingers for a long time.  It doesn't seem healthy to me to suck 
in that stuff into our lungs, does it?  Disappointed, we left at 7:30.  
Maybe Saturday mornings are just not right.

Sunday morning got to AfterLife (DNA) around 9am.  The place was 
bustling.  It was a new concept for me to get a good night's rest 
and get up in the morning for more...  I like the idea of the 
breakfast/juice bar outside and finally doing something about the 
turntables inside.  Stayed there 'til 1PM and went home.  I couldn't 
make it to the Rave at People's Park.  Hope it went well.

Well, that was my weekend.  Thanks for tuning in...

-- Steve

Not very ravey but the good one were underground.

Definitely in the lineage, there was a vibe in these places even though
it was mixed with attitude.  The Gay discos kept the disco flame burning
after it was co-opted by the record companies, it eventually metamorphasized
into House.

> 	(3) Reggae Dancehall Culta / Reggae Dub (e.g. Lee Scratch Perry).
I don't know much about this.

> 	(4) Gospel and gospel/dance inducing group trance states.
YES most definitely.  Especially the Black Pentacostal "Holy Roller"
churches.  The service in these churches is very much like a rave
in structure if not in form and content.  The music is intense and
highly "soulful" when it get cookin the beat gets up to around 130 BPM,
people get "happy" which is a trance state where they are "filled
with the holy ghost", this is accepted and often it is the older folks
thattt this happens to.  I don't think I could go to one of these services
now without this happening to me.  Once you learn how to go into this state
you can fall into it REAL easy.  I find myself slipping into trance at
the most unlikely moments during a rave, it feels like I'm sliding down
a ski slope or hill and then I'm gone.  I come back into ego consciousness
sometimes 30 seconds sometimes maybe a minute or so after but since I'm not
sure how much time has passed this may not be accurate.

These clubs had there own for of the Vibe as well.

Subject: Dead Net Up Week

        Well, soda.berkeley.edu appears to have returned for a little while
at least - it's been having trouble with it's boot disk (for all you fellow
geeks out there, everything with /etc, /usr, /tmp, and /).  The have a new
disk so it should be mostly fixed - the FTP site remained largely unscathed
(except of the January archives which I'm getting a copy of from people, and
last May's archives which hopefully someone else has) so I've backed up the
archive off-line as well.  

        I am _still_ going to suggest that people use the 

        sfraves@sfraves.stanford.edu

        alias from now on.  It's faster and more reliable.  I may ask about 
moving the FTP site/archives there too when that machine gets upgraded.



	Okay, and now for my weekend update:  Friday was spent in the Twitch
studios showing SLC Big Wig Pete Ashdown the Twitch studios.  He came away
going, "I can't believe I turned down an offer to live with these people" so
I guess he liked it :):)  There was basically nothing else going on that 
night - Rhythm Empire looked way too commercial, a "breakin" it turns out was
going to try to use Charter Oak (without Mark's consent - we stoppped by
there and put an end to that hope of theirs), and the Vibe was at the stone,
so there was really nothing to get excited about. 

	Saturday night we went over to Wicked - I left early to help set up.
I had never been in 177 Townsend; it was an interesting space, but the bar
is featured a little too prominantly for my tastes.  Other gripes about the
space: the sound system was pretty shoddy to my ears, compared to others
I've heard (even right next door at the King St. Garage), and the DJ was 
tucked away in this small booth.  It didn't seem like the DJ's liked being
there either - all the closeness and attention the DJ gets when he's in 
front of the stage area like at Come/Unity is lost.  Somehow some drums found
their way to the dance floor and about three drummer syncopated to the
rhythms, which was the nicest part about the whole evening in my mind.  
The lighting was quite nice, even with that cheesy spinning-plane-of-
rainbow-light I last saw at the Edge.  But the fog was on overdrive and 
caused me to stop dancing more than once.... 

	The music was, er, interesting.  I liked what Markie played, even if
it seemed to confuse the dancers a bit :)  After his set I went to the upstairs
lounge and chilled for about an hour into Garth's set - I heard him play some
incredibly hard stuff, much harder than I would have expected; his second
half was slightly more mellow but still aggro compared to what he normally
plays.  I was shocked but I think it's a good thing..... Jeno's set was
great als always but he kept messing up at a couple of points (as did the
other DJ's).  I think the setup in the booth was really frustrating for them,
as the turntables are placed _behind_ the mixer rather than next to, causing
the DJ to reach abut 10 inches farther than usual.  Plus they are on a wooden
table about 10 inches from a huge woofer - recipe for trouble.  I didn't stay
for Thomas's set either, so I can't comment on the "morning vibe" which is
usually my favorite part of a rave.

	The GG Park thang was interesting - I got there around 3pm to find 
maybe 200 people there.  I would estimate at least 50, maybe 75 or 100 of those
were people who were just in Berkeley at the time or casual observers who got
sucked into the idea.  I think this is great, as most of these people were
the archtypical Berkeley "60's aren't over maaaan" types.  The DJ spinning when
I got there was Adonis, spinning an incredibly funky set, perfect for a 
Sunday outdoors thang.  This solidifies my conviction that there's so much
good talent out there it's scary.  At about 4:30 Jon Williams, not Garth,
took over (they both have long hair but Garth has a sharper face).  Now my
understanding was that it was moved to People's Park as a last-minute 
"well, we don't have any place to put it, is there a safe place we can put
it where we can say it's a political action and we won't be bothered" locale,
but I saw people wearing Tshirts saying "Sunday May 21st - a day of giving".
I asked one of those wearig the shirts what the story was, and he said this
had been planned for weeks.  Humm.  Whatever.   Also, there was a curious
lack of two things:  one, someone walking around to collect money for the
benefit (besides the usual Telegraph Ave. denizens) and no one was handing
out trashbags or cleaning up.  Now I know People's Park isn't a clean place
to begin with, but imagine what sort of impact cleaning the park would have!
Sadly, I saw no one do it, and _tons_ of trash everywhere.  I sure there would
have been some tweakers who would have had tons of extra energy to clean up
with :):)

Anyways, it was an average weekend...... next weekend I'll be in LA, but
I'm looking forawrd to Vision on the 3rd....

Subject: Recycle


Hi again.

I was wondering what you all think about the Recycle weekly,
Wednesdays at the Stone...or if anyone has actually been there.

I stopped by last Wed., and found a decent crowd for the size (they
have walled off some of the club with plastic sheets - maybe for a
more intimate feel?), sets by Dutch, Carlos, and I can't quite
remember who else.

The crowd was a little younger, probably because it is an 18+ event
and Housing Project is 21+, also on Wed.  The attitude was
surprisingly laid-back; no one seemed to be too stressed about
anything (OK, so it was a Wednesday).

This week, the promoters Melissa, Kyle, and Laurie said they will
be donating the proceeds from any recyclables (requested at the
door for $2 off) to the Malachi fund.

Comments?

One of the sub woofers died thus throwing off the whole system. Normally
177's system is very loud and clean but my ears were ringing from this
system for the first time in the morning.

Um brian, this is March 21... also the event was planned but having DJs was
not.

Yes, typo, I meant March 21st... but the man I had talked to wearing the
shirt was fairly clear in saying that it had been planned like this for awhile;
I don't think the DJ's and sound system were last-minute additions.  My
guess is that had there not been a permit problem with Golden Gate park,
there would have been TWO outdoor Sunday afternoon parties, with different
DJ's and everything, and that because one was shut down they sent everyone
over to the other.  Makes sense at least....

Subject: 1200s and a mixer wanted

Howdy gang, I'm moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico this summer. There's not much
of a scene there, though there is the interest. So in the hopes of helping
it grow, I think the best thing to do is bring the music with me. Towards
that end, I'm in search of two used 1200s and a mixer. Any help, ideas,
suggestions or whatever, would be greatly appreciated. Also, if anyone knows
any ravers in New Mexico, please let me know. Peace. >nrg<

my friend went to 1015 folsom and the vibe on friday and she said the
music at both places was superb although of course 1015 was filled
with alcohol guzzling people desperately attempting to find someone
sloshed enough to take home and fuck.  and apparently the vibe was
filled with teenagers.  not that that's a bad thing, necessarily...

i was *very* disappointed.  i hadn't been to townsend in many many
months and the sound system has been transformed from a brilliant
thumping monster into a total piece of crap.  bummed me out, let me
tell you.


>and the DJ was tucked away in this small booth.

this sucked as well.  last time i was there, the DJ setup was where
the camouflage net that separates the bar area from the dance area
was.

i *like* that cheesy spinning-place-of-rainbow-light!  i don't like
the fog though.  i've *never* liked it, but it seems to be de rigeur
for some weird reason.

I went to Martin's Lift last Thursday at the Sound Factory and it
can be a cool place if the right people show up - good sound, 
well-designed (although perhaps overly designed).  I'm not sure
what Martin's doing wrong though, because not very many people
showed up, even though it was free.  At the peak, around 1 am,
there were maybe 100-150 people but only about 50 dancing, even
though the music was pretty good.  It tapered off quickly and
was down to about 50 people total by 2 and only a few dancing.
(whenever this happens, it seems like SFRavers end up being a 
majority of the people dancing :)   I think there's been enough
flyering for it, and Martin has a good reputation, so I guess it
must be the Sound Factory which has the bad reputation...

I'm certainly sorry to hear about the decline of the mighty Townsend sound
system.  The bigger they come . . .

I'm not sure if I like the Townsend or Troc system better.  Both have their
advantages.  Presumably Townsend's will be fixed up.

Does anyone know any of the audio wizards who set these things up?  They
are using some very interesting concepts . . .

The Townsend sound system was one of the major reasons Gunther and I

The Troc sound system DOES have those cool metal tweeters though...

I agree!  What's the deal on these things?  Unlike what many people
believe, these fog machines do not use dry ice (which would be relatively
harmless and more effective) but some kind of liquid gunk that gets
atomized into particles and goes directly into our lungs.  Do you
really believe this stuff is safe to breathe?  Plus, it's a pretty
cheezy effect anyway -- give me strobes, intellibeams, projections,
lasers, etc. over this anytime.  I can't tell you how many times I've
been totally grooving on the production until the fog comes and spoils
it for me!

I can see using it maybe once or twice in a night, if the room is
ventilated well enough so that it clears out after a minute (not the
case with Townsend or King St.)  Above that it's really a nuisance --
far worse than whistles.

Do other people feel this way too?  You'd think with all the environmental
consciousness in the scene people would be concerned about this.  I've
talked to a few promoter/friends about this, but they believe it adds to
the "atmosphere" (cough, gasp!)  Maybe if a bunch of us get together and
call more attention to it, they'll start phasing it out...  Let's leave this

Re: townsend audio system.... 

When i was at the recent audio eng. society show in SF, i stopped by a 
booth that had an interesting kind of subwoofer. it was operated by an
electric servo motor with a "camshaft" that translated the servo's
rotational motion into pistonic motion, and that was coupled to the
speaker cone to  drive it back-and-forth. They claimed this could
deliver huge amounts  of subsonic energy in a very efficient manner.

As to how the servo control electronics could accelerate and decelerate
the rotational mass quickly enough to generate nonsinusoidal
waveforms... don't know. It's possible  that they just assume that
you'll be generating sinusoids from 10-60Hz with the higher harmonics
being filtered out by the crossover and reproduced by a normal woofer.
(which sounds incredibly tricky... esp. with the phase-lag inherent in
a servo system).

If anybody really gives a shit, i can probably dig up the name of the
manufacturer.

Anyways, I asked them who uses their system and they mentioned that
townsend does...

PS: speaking of soundsystems, whatever they used at the first GG-Park
event wthis year was damn nifty -- someone with good taste in audio
eqiupment put the system togehter, and it was pretty clear that they
didn't have a limited budget.

chemical fog is made out of a PETROLEUM-BASED GUNK that gets heated
until it vaporizes.  i had a chance to get Up Close And Personal with
a rented fog machine when my friend threw a "cyberpunk" party several
years ago.  pretty much convinced me that one should avoid these
machines as much as possible.

well, if you rent the machine, you can't return the excess goo, so the
tendency is to use it all up in one night.

It's always interesting to see what people think about the various parties.
I had heard nothing but good things about the Wicked event, and the things
that went on the next day as well. Hmmm...

Well you can't blame wicked for a shoddy crowd.  First off they held the
event at TOWNSEND, and when you hold events in the front of that place you
tend to get a TOWNSEND crowd.  This account for the SM's (Shirtless Males)
scouting about.

As for the TOWNSEND sound system (I know I am gonna piss someone off now),
it's OK, but it ain't great.  I'd rather have the M&M highs&mids coupled
with the Community 415's bass bins.  This provides (when all is said and
done) a system that meets or exceeds the expectations of the serious
dancer/ravaholic.  Plus the system is clean.

The front of TOWNSEND was REALLY not meant for thelikes of
Garth,Jeno,Markie, & Thomas since their sound system (TOWNSEND'S that is)
cannot handle the levels these guys tend to drive.  Next time they are
closer to the dance floor check out the VU meters.  Markie & Jeno esp.
drive the fuck out of a system.  Unlike most DJ's though they do it evenly.
Some like SPUN, pump up the bass (usually by playing with the onboard eq) so
fucking loud it distorts.  TOWNSEND should have done a proper soundcheck
with the boys to adjust their system to accomodate the levels they are used
to playing at.  Garth tends to be fairly even...Thomas varies, I have heard
him play the MOST tweeter oriented music bound to bring blood to the ears at
times.  The last time I heard him play was when wicked FIRST moved to
Townsend Garage.  That, as well as the otyher played incredible sets.

Last time Wicked was in the TOWNSEND space a similar event happened.  The
sound began to distort.  I just think that the front needs to adjust to the
playing style of the DJ, not the opposite.

As for all the environmental BS with fog machines...fog is the way!  There
is NOTHING more psychedelic than a nice laser, PLENTY of fog, some cool
lights.  This is TRUE underground acid.  The true atmosphere.  I love it.  I
get annoyed by it as well at times, but overall the effect (esp when
altered) is mind-boggling.  You're in your own world, and you must admit
sometimes that is wehre we all want to be.

The lights in the front are a bit corny, that is because the front is REALLY
geared towards a more stylish crowd (as in gay, as in beautiful people, as

The person running the show creates the environ and they have control.

I have a question...what IS everyones favorite spot, or at least the spot
where they have had the most fun/memorable experience?

Peace.

I vote NO on fog machines.  Late last year, I was at a Wicked in King St.
that made extensive (like, two stints of 45 minutes each) use of fog.  The
day after, I couldn't stop coughing...and didn't for a week.  That stuff
fucked me up, and bad.  I run out of joints that use fog machines now, as
fast as I can.  I will NOT get sick because of anybody's "cool".

Some of you all may be less sensitive than I am (and this is the first
"environmental" illness I've ever had), but if I get blasted by this stuff,
you can imagine that others will, too.

ok, i don't like the stuff when it's overused, either.  i have, though, seen  
it put to great effect.  at one time DV8 had (still has?) an obscenely large  
number of Dataflash mounted here and there - two 5x5 matrices on one wall,  
and dozens more overhead - in a room not all that huge.  once in the evening,  
the crew loaded up the room with really dense fog, and strobed all of the  
Dataflash on *full power* simultaneously.  instant whiteout!   intense  
radiation, but with no detail - couldn't see my hand in front of my face.   
way cool - and the effect was used only briefly, while the blast of fog was  
at its densest.

about Fog:  one of the machines you see around a lot is the Lightwave  
Research F-100. the company sells a fog juice called Atmospheres for use with  
this machine.  here are a few paragraphs from their literature:

"Atmospheres lighting enhancement fluid is a water based fluid that was  
formulated in 1986.  The F-100 Performance Smoke Generator was subsequently  
designed to work with the fluid.  It is manufactured with U.S.P. food grade  
components under stringent conditions to insure a high level of purity.  Each  
container used in the manufacturing process is used exclusively for that  
purpose to reduce the risk of introducing any contaminants into the final  
product.  The water used in the formula is processed through mixed bed  
de-ionizers [....] Carbon based additives such as flavored scents and colored  
dyes are specifically not used because the sticky, gummy residues that they  
leave behind will cause blockage in the heat exchanger.

"Atmospheres is not colored, but it is lightly scented because most users  
prefer some scent.  Lightwave Research lab technicians conducted lengthy  
tests and developed a proprietary scent from [a] wide variety of scent  
samples.  It was specifically selected for its low carbon content and its low  
outgassing properties, which result in less residual deposits.  For these  
reasons, the warranty for the F-100 fog machine is only valid if it is being  
used exclusively with Atmospheres smoke fluid.  The Atmospheres formula is  
non-toxic and contains polyfunctional alcohols that are commonly used in the  
food industry as a thickening agent for various products such as cream soda  
and vanilla extract."

of course, this is not to say that all fog we encounter in clubs are made  
with as much apparent care as this stuff....

Get your terms straight, young man. "Bulldada" is not a meaningless

Excessive fog juice can be bad, but nothing is worse than the dust in the 
air at some of the warehouse/outdoor events last year, most notably Let 
Freedom Rave (we were dancing in a corral, for heaven's sake) and Vision
(there was SO MUCH dust in the air it looked like the thickest fog - my

At some time during Wicked, I went upstairs and looked out over the club.
The fog was so thick you couldn't see past the bar. I was pretty revolted.

Somebody must like this stuff, but nobody I've ever talked to. Let's start
a campaign. Every time you see fog in use at a club, find out who's controlling
it and politely ask them to stop. Maybe they'll eventually get the idea if
enough people complain.

I've had the same reaction on 2-3 occasions, though the coughing only
lasted for a few days... I believe two of the occasions were Wicked at
the King St. location. For this reason, I often leave or stop dancing
when the fog machine kicks in. On those occasions, I also happened
to observe that when I blew my nose, there was black/brown/mud-colored
mucus indicating that I'd inhaled alot of dust.

In addition to being spewers of foul chemical pollutants, I believe fog
machines also have the potential of being effective transport for
viruses and bacteria that happened to be growing or extant in the
fog-water. There's a good chance that nasties which might never have
made it when exposed to air get a free ride on an atomized water
droplet; when inhaled, those droplets can transfer nasties right into
your lungs. This is conjecture on my part... comments?

So... unless they fill the fog machines with hash oil, I too think we
should just say no to fog machines.

i recently bought a fog machine and the dealer told me the gunk he sold was
'water' based, but there must be something else in it-wonder what? i clean
it periodically with plain water and nothing comes out but hot air (no fog,
no steam). fog is necessary, without it the 'beams' from lights and lasers
cannot be seen since there the particle level in the air is low. smoking
lots of cigarettes might be an alternative, but second-hand actual 'smoke'
can only be worse. too much fog is a problem however, but some fog is
necessary to maximise lighting effects.

fog machines are not a problem, the people who abuse them are!

But without the fog, you can't even see the lasers or the intellibeams.  I
love watching the solid plane created by a laser projected through fog,
although I do agree that the stuff sucks to breathe.  Maybe if they could
just shoot it up into the air instead of in everyone's face...

I dunno.... maybe this works better somewhere really small, but if
your only lighting is the strobe your standing next to, and they pump
the room so full of smoke that you can't see the people your dancing
with, then your whole field of view is just filled with strobe light.
Pretty cool, though probably not if they do it too often / for too long...

Hmmm... from what I understand, the fog juice is passed across a hot
plate to vaporize it.  I should say, a VERY hot plate.  Like a
careless-dancing-gives-3rd-degree-burns hot plate.  Anyone else ever
burned themselves on one?

Still, there may be some little bad-boy type virus that could live
through it and cause an epidemic...

  I have had similiar reactions to fog machines.  BUT, instead of simply
a cough, I lose my voice entirely for a day.  Not because I was
screaming at the top of my lungs, but I was dancing for hours in King
St. inhaling that crap.  I personally feel that the fog does have its
moments, but the abuses of late are a little rediculous.

Remember something a while back where actors around fog machines
had "a higher incidence of respiratory complaints". Still love

To: sfraves@medisg.Stanford.EDU



I am inbetween on the Fog, I am with those people who think Fog with light add
cool effects but I also think that conservation is the key and also adds to the
affects.

Here are two experiences that I had with lighting and

I was at a Sharon Rave in Tracy on a large ranch where there was a few strobes
and a fog machine by the DJ.  I was standing a distance away (30 meters) and
they started playing the Opera Techno tune (forgot the name) at the same time
the introduced some fog into the crowd and used the strobes.  Watching this
from a distance while hearing this tune for the first time was awsome, I will
always remember it.  When I describe my best raves I always describe this
scene.  By the way the dancers were going crazy.

Another time I was at King Street and they did the Usual smokeout, I'll admit
they did this a little to often.  I was dancing on the dance floor Jumping all
around.  I thought I was bymyself, I couldnt see another soul as the fog
disapated there were people right up close to me.  It was bizzare and cool.

I was at Wicked last weekend and everytime I went out onto the dancefloor, the
humidity, lights, smoke, fog and especially the pumping music sent me through
the roof.

FLAME ON!

I belevie if you Smoke cigarretes you cant complain about the Fog Machines. 
FLAME OFF.

Hiya

I've had pretty good experiences with fog machines, although I did cough
for a bit after the one in Expo 86 ( can't remember the pavilion )...
What I do remember is feeling distinctly greasy after leaving. Has anyone
seen good use of dry ice? Seems safe enough, but it tends to sink to
foot level ( not the greatest for laser effects, I guess :).

BTW, I just moved to vancouver... does anyone know of good rave clubs? I
know that Graceland has events fairly often... are they good, or just
cheesy top 20 techno crap? I also saw posters for Cool World... how was 
it?

Oh, by the way, the "Fog Juice" is no more or less than starch
in water.  It's environmentally harmless, but not great to breathe
for very long (i.e. tech crews are worst off) and is hell on Contact
Lenses, etc.

My opinion?  Use Dry Ice.  8-)

I only dislike the fog if it is shot out at human level and excessively.
The cigarette smoke is what REALLY gets to me. It has made me very
nauseated at times. 
I would LOVE to see a cigarette free club (only in my dreams, I know).

Subject: SF Permit Madness

Maybe we ravers aren't being singled out for this recent wave of permit
extortion, after all.

I saw a story on the local news last night about the growing trend in
SF coffee houses of having open poetry readings.  This trend has been
nipped in the bud by city officials, who cracked down and started demanding
$800 permits for this activity.  One coffee house, the Blue Monkey, was
able to fork over this sum, but many others were forced to stop holding
these readings.

$800 for the privilege of reading poetry out loud?  Where can this insanity
possibly end?

Are any of you college-age ravers thinking of law school?

Here's the prospective text for the back of the Connection II j-card:

all in all, rave is the greatest antidote yet for urban anonymity.
when you open your heart, and trust the whole group you dance with;
when you feel love with everyone, and they return it, a higher
vibration can be reached.  dance is the supreme gesture of abandon,
the embrace of the moment, the abeyance of work and the annihilation
of guilt, neurosis, and the burden of the past.  no one can write a
{\em rave manifesto}\ldots there is no unified voice to rave culture,
and there are no rules.  ranting is the opposite of raving.  remember,
the scene is still growing.  just keep it going, don't give up hope.
you might think to yourself sometimes, man, the scene is fucked, it's
dying, it's changing, it's shit.  just hang in there and change with
the times.  don't get caught up in the good old days.  they were good
but keep the scene happening all around the world.  to rave is to
affirm.

Most of this is from the compilation of sfraves quotes that doom made.
I want everything to be anonymous, i.e. non attributed, so this mail
message is cc'ed to the authors of the various portions, when known
and online:

all in all, rave is the greatest antidote yet for urban anonymity.
  -- AstroBoy rpcaras@srv.pacbell.com
dance is...
  -- Russell A. Potter rapotter@colby.edu
no one can write a rave manifesto... there is no unified voice to rave
  culture, and there are no rules.
  -- Kevin Goldsmith kmg@cilmi.esd.sgi.com (is this email address right?)
ranting is the opposite of raving.
  -- Bill Coderre bc@apple.com

non-net stuff:

  -- HOUSE MUSIC and PLANETARY HEALING
just keep it going...
  -- DJ Abel, UOS #7

I'd really appreciate it if the authors could get back to me as soon
as possible and let me know if they mind me using their quote -- non
attributed -- in the fashion referenced above, i.e. that paragraph
will appear pretty much verbatim on the back of the j card.  If you
have a way of contacting the non-net references above, please contact
me right away too -- I can be reached at work at (415) 506-2784.

Other things on the back of the j-card will include a reference to
this event being thrown by a "cybertribe", that it was held in the
rain, and that the DJs worked under very harsh circumstances, which
was very appreciated by the crowd, but might have affected a mix or
two here and there.

There will also be an explicit reference to the tapes being recorded
with HX pro, and to playback without any noise reduction engaged.

"Salvador Dali: Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a
Pomegranate, a Second before Waking Up, 1944" will also appear in the
j card text, as this is the 4 color image on the front of the j card.

So -- if you are an author, please send email as soon as you can and
let me know if you would prefer that I not use your quote.  If you
know one of the non-net authors, or a net address for one of these
people, please get a hold of me as soon as possible.

Otherwise, if you have any suggestions or additions for improvements
for the j card text, let me know, I'd love some feedback, which is why
I posted this to sfraves... the j card text will be going to the
printer very very soon!

This city is definantly permit-happy.  About 3 weeks ago I was talking
to a street performer up at pier 39 and he told me that in addition to
the city required street entertainer permit, which is free for some
types of act and not for others, the businesses around the Wharf had
some kind of deal with each other and the city hall that requires a
separate permit to operate up there.  And they actually use the
gestapolice to enforce it.

-H-

P.S. did anyone read the Chron today? I found out that Methamphetamine
is now the drug of choice among ravers!  It says so right on the front
page.  d:(  I wasn't down here while the industrial scene was real
big...what did the media have to say about it?   Talk about meth
usage...

Am I allowed to change my last name to Ching?  I think I like it

To clear up any confusion: the lion's share of profits from these
tapes will go to Malachy.  Everything is still pretty up in the air,
especially as I don't know the ultimate number of orders (and probably
never will :-) but I'm guaranteeing that regardless of the overall
situation (i.e. if I lose money due to problems selling all the sets
made) that at least $5 per set will go to Malachy.  I'm not looking to
make a killing, if I do make a profit, it will be a reasonable profit
based on the amount of effort and time that I put into putting the
cassettes together and dealing with all the hassles and orders.

Sorry if this wasn't absolutely clear.  Even the price per set isn't
totally firmed up yet -- it depends a lot on the number of sets sold.
I may risk about $3K to get a bigger batch of tapes made so that the
overall price will decline -- but that will put me at a bigger risk as
well.

Just mulling it over, and thought I'd share.  In any case, I'll post a
full financial disclosure statement to this list sometime in mid May
or so once I've settled everything in stone, so you'll be able to see
exactly how much money was given to Malachy and so forth.

Later on,
Bob

Isn't all of this related to "cabaret" licenses?  Basically, the
city just wants a piece of the action.  This is nothing new...

I just want to add something to Mykl. As some of you already know I was
planning to do a big benefit rave in GG park on April the 10th. I tried
to get a permit following the right procedure.
This is what happen:
They told me to send a letter with all the info about my event.
In the meantime the put down my name to hold the place (The Band Shell).
I sent the letter specifying that was for benefit and I also mention
the charity group and a contact in this group. Of course I didn't say
it was a rave but just a dance benefit party.
After two week I called few times and finally they told me that they
didn't get any letter. So I promptly fax it. They said they were gonna
call me. I called and finally they told me how much would have cost me:

	$300 one day fee (unrefundable)
	$2,000 deposit (refundable)
	17% or $250 out of the money collected (it doesn't matter
			if is for charity)
	$1,000,000 proof of insurance (I asked my agent and he
			said that he could find someone to do it
			but it would be at least $500)
	sound permit (from SFPD)

The woman said, "if you are still interested you should come here and we can
talk about it". She really sounded like she was trying to make it impossible.
In fact I had to give up (at least for now) because, even if I could get
DJ's and sound system for free (or almost), it would have been not worthy
(not much money left for charity). Basically she didn't care that was 
for charity at all.

If I lived in San Francisco, I would do some things:
1) Call the Police Department and find out which laws give them authority
   to bust poetry readings.  The whole thing may turn out to be bogus.
2) When the law is found, organize reading/protest in front of City Hall
   and the police department.  This would be fun!  Just when we thought
   that words had become impotent and flabby, they regain their power to
   cause emotions.
3) Mail lots of poetry to various City Council members with the notation:
   "WHY IS IT ILLEGAL TO SAY THIS IN A COFFEEHOUSE?"  Pick classical stuff
   that conservative people would like.
4) Imagine the press.  "POETS JAILED FOR READING EMILY DICKINSON"

Once the facts are known, the media can be well used to your advantage.
Since poets look awfully innocent next to the current demonized class of
drug users, publicity is probably a Good Thing.

This is absurd, I always wondered why not many parties of anykind happen in
that area of the park.

Folks,
	I think its time that we seriously think of banding together,
	raising money, if necessary and trying the city's hand with
	some of these things.  Someee of these fee border on extortion
	and seem to come very close to interfering with our right to 
	peaceable assembly.  Lawyers are not cheap but maybe we can
	find some young ones who can represent our cause  "at cost".
	We may be moving toward a situation like in Milwaukee (I hope not)
	where the city gets so bold as to arrest the lot of us at an event.
	I hope it doesn't take something like this to galvanize us into
	political action like it took the Malachy tragedy to get us all to
	focus our heart energies and reflect on just why we are all here.

Yeah, well not THIS raver!
I think I'll go on a one man campaign against crystal.  During WICKED the other
day, I could see a lot of people tweekin' on crystal.  I've even given up coffee
these days and prefer Shakti (tm) to all forms of endurance enhancement drugs.
I can see how the usage patern starts, you go out friday night, need to drive
saturday morning so you do a line, this keeps you awake all day so in order
not to crash you do more to stay up for saturday's rave, then you HAVE to
go to DNA an then there's the park... so bam you're up for three days.
How many people going psychotic or worse will it take before people realize
that with Crystal you  have to pay the piper eventually.  And the payback
is a Muthafucka'.

I seem to remember a quote by the local head of the ACLU re: hassling one group
just because of the type of music they listened to, (I think it had to do with
rap), and that the ACLU was willing to get involved. If one group can assemble
and listen to polka music, (don't get me wrong, sometime I really crave a 
good polka,;)), in the park, and not get hassled, and folks who listen to 
a different drummer do, something is wrong, then perhaps we can see if the ACLU
would like to get involved with our problem.

	First, I'd like to say Hello to everyone on the list.  I've been
	getting it since soda came up (prayers to the silicon gods!) and am
	glad that there is a forum like this to promote commUnity here in
	the Bay Area.  (Thanks Brian!)

	Secondly, I've been laying really low (I've actually been on a
	healing binge) since January when I went to the Sound Factory for
	the first time.  It was part of a long farewell weekend to a good
	friend who's moved to Oregon. 

	Anyway, my impressions then were mixed: the before 2:00am crowd 
	was _too_ cool - all dressed up with everywhere to go.  It was also
	hard to find good chill out space.  Post 2:00am people were vibe.  I
	met a few really cool people that night.  I was really impressed
	with the sound: the suspended tweeters and ceiling fills are great
	as well as the immense subs (try sitting inside of one with your
	back up against the speaker!)  I don't know how things have changed
	since then (have been too far removed until recently), but I think
	that was the Love Factory night.  Is it still Life/Sound Factory/Love
	Factory?

	Lastly, I was able to catch Garth on KSCU and found it hella-cool.
	It started the vibe tingle in the base of my neck again and I'm
	looking forward to a really good party to reintroduce myself to.
	Any suggestions in the forthcoming month?

The news report was already sympathetic and a bit sarcastic about why
the police were being used so frivolously.  They pointed out the irony
that this could happen in the city of Kerouac and Ferlingetti.

I plan on writing or calling Supervisor Hallinan (the strongest civil
libertarian on the Board of Supervisors) and asking him to hold a hearing
to expose this sort of rubbish.

Hi everyone...
I have a slight problem that requires some creative energy to resolve.

I am a frequent user of vrave. Unfortunately, the sysadmin from the site at which 
I make the telnet connection sees a log file that says:
     plui... telnet 76.0.... 7282
Upon seeing this,  it is assumed by the sysadmin that I am playing a game.
Yesterday I received an email from him saying that if I log into this game site
again... my account will be disabled.  :(

He said that if I can prove it is not a game site (or a MUD site, what is MUD anyways!!!), 
then he would be so kind as to not disable my account. :|

How can I describe vrave? It really isn't a game. Is it MUD? 

what a dilema!
Any help is much appreciated.

That sounds better than my idea.  I was going to call and find out if
all the really upscale restuarants and hotels have permits for those damn
violin players and pianists, and file a complaint if they don't. :-)

Bogus indeed. Say, it might be wise to check Giamma's figures against
some previous events that happened at the band shell. When they had the
Cyborganic BeIn afterparty at the band shell, how much did it cost?
(Jonathan??)

Likewise, how much does KITS ("Live 105") pay when they have their lunchtime
concerts at the band shell. (Mr. Hart -- time to ask your wife!).

This is madness! madness! I can see it now... I'm walking down the
street w/ my girlfriend, and suddenly burst forth into Iambic
Pentameter. When... out of the bushes spring our trusty men in blue!!

	Pig: Son, do you have a poetry reading permit?
	Me: No sir! Actually, I was't reading, i was improvising...
	Pig: Aha! you need a street-performers permit for that!
	Me: Gee, I didn't know. I was just talking.
	Pig: Ignorance is no excuse. Hands behind your head and lie down on
	the ground... You have the right to remain silent.... anything you

I agree -- why not hassle the Supervisors about hassling ravers?  Say,
does anybody know if the Board of Dupervisors has/have email addrresses?

Just a note before I plow through 800+ pieces of mail...

Thanks to everyone who made my spring break so grand!

Brian, Greg, Cindy, Mike W., Jon, Leah, Taylor, Stevie, Jeff, CJ, Robert,
Geoff, Derrick, Moonpup, and all of San Francisco!

I had a great time at Wicked, a somewhat mediocre time at Together, was blown
away by Bonnie Doon, got a grand tour of the Twitch studios and mansion, had
fun on Haight, spent way too much money on *gasp* vinyl, and found some
vicious new sunglasses.

Apologies to everyone who I didn't get to meet up with.  Next time I'll warn
everyone I'm coming :-).

I would recommend talking to the ACLU before the riots begin ;^)
I dealt with them in college and they were very nice.  Someone should be
able to get a meeting with a representative who will be fairly knowledgeable
and will decide if the ACLU would get involved further.

What evidence is there that this is discrimination based on music?  If 
there is none then I would try the right to peaceably assemble angle.

My hunch is that unless the ACLU does see a civil liberties infringment
then there isn't much that can be done.  Those fees probably got jacked
up in the last few years when money for the city has been tight.

You may even get some good advice just over the phone.
Does the ACLU have email?
The local chapter guy that I spoke with (in LA) was a college prof.

I'm a (card-carrying) member of the ACLU, and I've even gone to a 
couple meetings of the local chapter.  I can't really say I have any
pull or personal contacts there, but I'm somewhat familiar with what
kind of cases they're interested in, and how they're organized.  

I think in order to have them do something, we would have to have
an example of a clear infringement of our civil liberties, and a
test case or some way we could set up a test case.  I have the info
number for the local chapter with me, where someone could leave a
message - it's (415) 979-6699.  That's the SF chapter, which is 
really more of an activist group, while the ACLU Northern California
is the organization which actually handles court cases.  I can
get that number from home, if we come up with something we can
go to them with.

This might be a good idea.  Maybe someone should talk to them on the
phone and see if we fall in a catagory they would support. them we can send
a delegation down which should include at least one promoter, someone
from the list and maybe one other.  We should choose good representatives
that would represent the community well.

Maybe we should set up a sound system in Marx Meadows and spin a few
arias, and see what happens.  If the plug gets pulled then, I'll bet
we could enlist some real political juice to the cause...

You should have seen our country bumpkin faces when that thing started to go.
I was in utter awe of that spinning light.  I felt like a moth that wanted

:) Upon seeing this,  it is assumed by the sysadmin that I am playing a game.
:) Yesterday I received an email from him saying that if I log into this game site
:) He said that if I can prove it is not a game site (or a MUD site, what is MUD anyways!!!), 

Ya, we have the same problem here at SFU... Our sysadmin vanepp classifies
vrave as a game... A MUD is a mulit user dungeon.. an internet site with
multiple players that runs a dungeons and dragons like text simulation. As for
proving that it's not a game, it depends on what your sysadmin defines a game
as ( here it's anything not-academic ).... good luck... #(*& bureaucracy...

 well who has the video from the cII bust?? although i don't think
it would be admissable in court (but i am not lawyer)
why would we need a permit for under 100 people having a birthday party???
partyon...susie (:
I think in order to have them do something, we would have to have
an example of a clear infringement of our civil liberties, and a
test case or some way we could set up a test case.  I have the info
number for the local chapter with me, where someone could leave a
message - it's (415) 979-6699.  That's the SF chapter, which is
really more of an activist group, while the ACLU Northern California
is the organization which actually handles court cases.  I can
get that number from home, if we come up with something we can
go to them with.

I was in D.C. for Interop and went to check out a couple of clubs
(thanks Susie and Rob for the info).

Tracks: very young crowd and the music was way too fast and techno for me.
I'm either getting too old or I just changed my taste so much.

Club Zei: there was the release party for this fashion/music magazine
called "Project X". The club is really nice (sort of like DV8 in SF)
and the people were tipical club-scene people, not bad but not particularly
interesting.

Anyway the interesting thing was that on the issue that they were giving away
(#24) these is an article about the Hardkiss Family.

***************************************************************************

For the Hardkiss Family
=======================

San Francisco's incredible underground dance scene is inspired by and 
simultaneously transcends the concept of "RAVE" and now there is a record
label which reflects this uniqueness.
Currently, San Francisco has been experiencing a regeneration of late
60's HIPPIE CULTURE and its dance scene today is an incredible diverse mix
of IDEALISTIC AND SPIRITUAL REVELERS.
The S.F. scene is radically different from its glossy, exploitative Southern
cousin, Los Angeles - it is a smaller, a more focused, and trully idyllic 
community.
Free parties in the sunny Golden Gate Park every Sunday afternoon and 
illegal monthly tribal gatherings under the full moon are typical of San
Francisco's celebrations.
Likewise, the musical taste of this city is unlike that of any other people
- its grooves are trancey, funky and very very trippy. The local DJs are
treated as techno-shamans, and the events often generate a truly magical
energy which must be experienced to be believed.
At the forefront of this movement are the Hardkiss revolutionaries -
a growing family of musicians, producers, DJs, artists and promoters
who are setting fire to a few million ears and hearts.
Hardkiss has brought together many of the world's finest dance artists
and DJs together in a continuing series of legendary events - all part
of struggle towards mass musical transformation.
Their unique collaborative sound is reflected in the label's debut 
release "THE TRIP", by the ULTRA - VIOLET CATASTROPHE. The UVC is a pseudonym 
for MIKE WERTHEIM, JON DRUKMAN and JEFF TAYLOR, the boys responsible for
the highly successful remix service Twich. This talented trio will be the 
in-house engineering and production team for all future Hardkiss releases.
Lok out for a (very) different Hardkiss Music release every month and 
meanwhile ....
			KISS HARDER.

Subject: This week's RAVE guide

	Hmmm... kinda slim pickins this weekend.  Make a Wish sounds good for
Friday night - Rick Preston annd Moonpup are the two most severely underrated
DJ's in the SF scene.  TTTTT has been flyered to hell, and sounds like it is
being run by the same people as Rhythm Empire (any bets it's at 16th and
Harrison? Hm?  :)  Raw Sugar definitely has the DJ talent factor on high...
but STAY AWAY from X-LAX.  What an AWFUL name for a rave.

	Saturday: if you happen to find yourself in Salt Lake City with
nothing to do there's this shindig going on there :)  Pure and Juice are
both outfits who have thrown large events before with mixed results, so
caveat emptor...

	Of course, we have Sunday to provide our salvation in the form of
the Golden Gate park thang. 

	Enjoy!


	Brian

I called up V-Rave but I haven't been verified yet, so I have to stay
in the "lobby" (Channel 1) while all the cool people get to go to
the chill-out room and the art gallery!  I feel like I'm back in 7th
grade and a social reject.

Well, I've been lurking for about a month now, and figured I'd jump in and join
the fray.  I'd read in several places about "ravers" getting the latest info
through computer networks, but until I met Brian, I'd never run into anyone who
could confirm this.  Anyway, this is a very groovy, very positive community, and
I'm looking forward to matching faces to the characters that I now only know by
name.  =)

I am one half of the visual crew Synergy, so if you see some trippy computer
graphics w/video, find the projector, and trace the wires over to our little
station (pay no attention to the man behind the curtain...  ) and say hello.
We're also both musicians trying to mine the deep ambient vibe, so I'm
particularly interested in talking shop with the others on the list who make
music.

Lee posted a message asking about Mission Rock...
We've been working there every week since it reopened, and it really is quite a
happening party- a nice appetizer for Friday night.  I'm really impressed with
James- I've yet to hear him spin a bad set.  Anyway, the doors open at about 10,
and it really picks up and gets kicking at about 12.  Unfortunately, I don't
think it's going to happen this week, as someone had previously booked the space
(but please don't take this as gospel-- I'll post again tomorrow when I find out
for sure)

Thanks in advance for more lively discussion and I look forward to meeting lots
of you and someday learning the secret handshake  =)

Dance, dance, dance,

Tony

Subject: Recycle, last night


Went and gave Recycle at the Stone another chance Wednesday
night, and ended up having a really great time.  This is
starting to be a really decent alternative for a Wednesday
night, what with all the rumors about Housing Projects recent
decline and all.

Got a chance to meet yet another of our many sfravers (you know who
you are!) who also seemed to be having quite some fun.

There were at least a coupla hundred people there last night
with a huge turnout of recycled goods to be cashed in and
donated to the Malachi fund, stretching almost the whole length
of the lower hallway.  Again a somewhat younger crowd, probably
because of the 21+ Housing Proj, but definitely very little
attitude to be seen.

As for the tunes, Carlos was pulling off (for the most part)
some amazing scratching done with two copies of the same record,
where he'd fade in a table, scratch one heavy beat over the
other copy of the record and let it go in perfect time, fade it
in completely, grab the other copy, find the same beat, scratch
IT and let it go seamlessly, over and over.

Then came Ghost.  He had rumoredly promised to do his new house
set but changed his mind when he stepped up.  Man, he started
spinning the MOST vicious Belgian techno I've never heard
"SCREEEEEEP SCREEEEEEP YA! YA! ICH NEIN DER UBERLAND! SCREEEEEP
SCREEEEEP" you know the score.  Mixes in none other than phrases
from that old A-Ha tune Take On Me, just going craazy.  He's even
got these wide-eyed women with "GHOST" hats on leaning over
the DJ booth sucking it up.  Didn't last long before one of the
promoters gently (whack) reminded him of his promise and of
the feel they were trying to keep with the party, and he mellowed
out.  Good thing to hear every now and then, but it sure does
grate after a while.

Check this one out sometime.

make a wish is the birthday party for my friend renee.  i will be
dj'ing at it at some point, as well.  it's at 1015 folsom, so when you
go there, tell the door guy that you're there for make a wish, in the
basement.  even tho the party is in the basement, you can still go
upstairs and check out the other parts of the club.  but fear not,
those who come only to go to the upstairs party can NOT go down into
the basement.  (they're going to have a bracelet system i guess.)

come check it out.

Just to confirm Tony's message, there is no Mission Rock this week due to
circumstances beyond their control however it should happen again the week after
next (April 9th) at latest but hopefully next week. There is a info line for 
those of you interested although there is nothing on it right now although it
should be updated as I type. The number is 241-8862.

so i asked scott hardkiss about fog machines.  (the hardkisses run
deep faith on thursdays at the DNA, and other parties from time to
time.)  actually, what i said was, "i'm on a crusade to stamp out fog
machines" and he said, "well, you'll have to get by me first."  he
loves them.  he says he fondly remembers the first toon towns where
they'd fill the place up with fog, blast the strobe lights and drop
the bass hard.  i said, "that sort of effect is great but nobody does
that these days.  they just leave the thing on until you're choking in
a big cloud of crud."  he said, "yeah, we probably should ease up on
it a little, but we do loooove our fog!"  he went on to tell me how a
typical club night can use $50 - $100 worth of fog juice and it does
come included in the price of renting the club.  in fact, one week
they were going to do Deep Faith and there wasn't the usual amount.
they went ballistic on the club owner and there's been a full amount
of fog juice every week since.  :)

i understand that you need foggy air to get the full effect from
lights/lasers, but i think most clubs are already so damn smoky from
all the cigarettes that you don't need to lean on the fog machine like
some places do.  just turn it on for a short time every once in a
while.

anyway, my conversation with scott didn't exactly convince him to
throw the machine out but at least i got him thinking about it...

to hp but decided that we could not deal with the club scene/attitude.
(oh, and hi mykl and it was nice to meetch niels! =)  sooo, being the
adventurous type, we hopped a cab to the stone, knowing full well that we
had no way back to the east bay until the 6:00 bart but not really caring.

we were so glad we did!  immediately we knew things were gonna be good -
the doorman was so friendly and I gave him my flower (my favorite kind -
a calla lilly) and went in. the crowd was really young, but everyone was
really friendly.  it cheered me up immensely.  I got to meet another 
sfraver =)))).  I did see some attitude, but it was that "hi I'm in high
school but I'm out at a club so that makes me queen of the universe"
attitude.  kinda funny but it does grate.  that, and the heat, were really
my only complaints.  I also kinda like a younger crowd sometimes...

anyway, the music was really good - and I even liked the beginning of
ghost's set.  actually, I liked it a lot!  it had been forever since I'd
heard music like that - and it really energized me and made me go go go!
made me really really happy too - it was so funky and fun!  I guess I'm
the type who likes techno, etc when it's a novelty, as a break from the
music I normally hear.  after a while, I go a little nuts, but just the
right amount and it's great!  one minor music flaw - I didn't like it when
the techno and the house were mixed together.  I can't get into music w/a
groove + the hard edge of techno.  it really doesn't work, imo.  

but overall, I really had a great time.  and laura did too (she was/still
sorta is a virgin raver).  she really liked it - and she could tell the
difference between hp and recycle.  now she knows why I loooove going out!
she's visiting me from colorado and she'll be with me all weekend, so be
sure to say hi and convince her to move out here! =)  heh heh....


so that's leah's long winded review =)

have a delicious day!

always, leah

Not letting you in the front door?   Hmmm...  make sure you are typing

telnet sfraves.stanford.edu 7282

the 7282 part is quite important.  If this still doesn't work let me know,
but it's likely a problem at your machine and nothing I can help (but 
write me anyways)

Yes I too have had a problem with the extra number "7262"

to more normal convention? (not that it is that strange - but u know!)

please advise us brian - we want to rave.RAVE

Something is seriously wrong with my mail program. Here goes a try at a
repost. What I wanted to say was that I just got this newsletter from
Stone Design, an NM-based software company that creates databases etc.
for the NeXT. Check out this little item:

Expo Rave: The Sequel
Stone Design is planning another rave for Wednesday, May 26th in San
Francisco to coincide with the second annual NeXTWorld Expo. According
to Stone CEO Andrew Stone, attendees should "expect dancing and raving
til dawn." Party starts at 9pm. Host smart bar, no-host dumb bar.

Invitations and directions to the "ultrasecret location" will be
available at the Stone Booth during Expo hours. Stop by our booth - just
look for the castle - to get your invite and check out the new versions
of DataPhile, Create and 2d Reality while you're there!

So, anyone going to this :^P

Mailer: Elm [revision: 70.85]

                I've been on sfraves for a little while now and most
		of the time I just kind of sit back and sift the vibes
                ,kind of taking the pulse of the rave community and
		seeing what kinds of things people have to say. Most
                of the time there isn't anything outrageously intere-
		sting for me to say other than elaborating on everyone 
		elses opinions, which is terribly boring. So just this
		once. :)
		After having lived in sf all my life and spending the 
		last couple years actively participating in the rave scene
		I moved to Santa Barbara in September to finish jumping 
		through the bureaucratic hoops at UCSB(bachelors degree.)
		Occasionally there are local pseudo-raves here and there's
		always the heavily wrought-out guerilla rave scene of LA.
		Here in SB (which by the way is composed mostly of a severely
		wealthy Bev.Hills type aristocracy in remote competition
		with a very naive island of new wave "last grasp at the
		80's material dream" yuppie offspring college students) and
		especially in Los Angeles, there is a distinct flavor of
		escapism. In general the vibes I get are that people are more co                ncerned about the chemical support they desire and its pursuit
                rather than on just merging into the incredibly intense and 
		psycho-erotic media that the rave scene is all by itself, with
		out any chemical interference. Meth is big, and of course that
		in turn gives birth to a mood that is much more volatile
		and corrosive, and, by its very nature, quickly overshadows
		any of the positive vibes being released by nonusers and users 
		of mind-manifesting type compounds(aka. psychedelia).
		At this point, most of you who are already on this groove are
		probably just nodding and saying, yeah.... and? That's LA.
		We're San Francisco. And for the most part I agree with you,
		but not whole-heartedly.
		We're all well aware that it's long past due for the re-emerg-
		ence of the "underground" underground. It need not be reiterated                thatthe
		days of Disneyland type mega productions won't be numbered
		soon enough. And that the masses will either be swept away in 
		those capitalistic vortices forever or just get burnt out on
                their crystal and get tired of the whole scene, leaving the   
		rest of us to groove till we collapse in some stuffy basement.
                Enough said.
                Sfraves is a cool thing. And I commend Brian for making it all
		possible as well as everybody else with their brilliantly  
                colored re-creations of events that ooze with good vibes.
		But at the same time there seems to be another faction emerging
                (or maybe its always been there) that's beginning to be pretty
                negative and abrasive. These are all the whiners and ballistic 
		complainers. Okay so we all know how you feel about fog machines                and cops, and bad speakers, and meth users, and permits,  and
		all the other nuances that make the rave scene so precarious
		and unpredictable. Those things are all inherent in what's
		known as the underground. If everything was set and all promoters               s had a routine to go by every week then; for one it wouldn't
		be underground, and two it wouldn't be nearly as fun.
	        Now like I said before I ordinarily wouldn't even make a peep
		on this already slightly cluttered but potentially enlightening
		interface except when I feel that something worthwhile needs to                 be said. The only apparent reason for all the ranting seems
		to me that some of you guys are just plain burnt on the scene.
                If you attempt to squeeze more from the scene than is there then                the whole scene is phucked! That's escapism. And that's what's
		making LA such a negative place to be. 
		I don't necessarily want to bag on anybody. And I am well aware
	
	
	of the hippocrisy of writing a complaint about all the complainers.
		But I think it would be a good dose of reality if those of
		you who insist on injecting your negative two cents into 
		cyberspace everytime you see fit would just CHILL and sift
		the currents for a while and let those of us with positive
		things to say take the reigns for a while. If your so tired
		of the scene that all you can do to battle all the bumps
		and curves on the road to a good time is point the finger and
		offer no friendly assistance then maybe the rave scene isn't 
		really working for you the way you want it to. There's
		no way we can affect the entire rave nucleus on this little
		group we call sfraves. But the very least we can do is to
		keep it positive amongst ourselves. 
		Thanks to all of you for reading this and I do send everyone 
		up there the most positive vibes. Keep it real. =->.

 Huh? If they're making a distinction between "dancing" and "raving",
what do they mean by each term?????

 "Well, dancing is , like, the Fly Girls on "In Living Color", and raving
is when you kinda stagger about and wobble your hands with a dumb look
on your face. YaKnow??? Oh, by the way, would you like some of our
product brochures?"

 The Domain Survey attempts to discover every host on the Internet by doing a
 complete search of the Domain Name System.  The latest results gathered
 during mid-January 1993 are listed.  For more information see RFC 1296; for
 detailed data see the pub/zone directory on ftp.nisc.sri.com.  This survey
 was done using the census program developed at the University of California
 on Santa Cruz; see technical report UCSC-CRL-92-34 on host ftp.cse.ucsc.edu.
 The statistics below were generated by running the collected host data
 through a number of utility programs.

                Frequently Asked Questions about the Domain Survey

 What'da all those domain names stand for?
    See pub/zone/iso-country-codes on ftp.nisc.sri.com.

 Why does the domain count go up and down?
    I don't know.  Do you want to count them?

 Are all those hosts really on the Internet?
    You would have to ping them to find out.  If they each took 100
    milliseconds to reply to a ping, you could find out in only 37 hours.

 How many users are on the Internet?
    Some people estimate around 10 per host (13 million people).
    If all of them were appropriately registered, the birthday-daemon
    would have to deliver 35,616 email messages each day.

 Where can I get more information?
    See the pub/zone directory on ftp.nisc.sri.com.

Subject: TAZ tonight!


	For those of you looking for an alternative to the big productions
tonight, i just found out there's going to be another TAZ by the folks @
Planet 6.  i'm not sure who's DJing, but last time they had a good mix of
DJs in one room, intermittent reggae/open mike in another, and then
Planet 6 doing the live thing.  Good visuals too.  Small, friendly
gathering.  Highest ratio of sfravers to nonnetters that i've seen @ any
rave other than Connections/Alternitys (we pretty much took over one room
for a while :)
	Anyway, its @ 586 Stevenson.  By the way, is anybody else going to
see Phish @ the Warfield tonight?  The TAZ is only about a block away, so 
i'm just going to head over after the show, maybe gather a few Phisheads
to come along the way...

How exactly DOES one "appropriately" register?

The GG Park info line claims that the rave in Marx Meadows has been
cancelled this week due to rain.  I'm looking out my window and all I see
is sun, sun, sun.  Oh well...

TAZ was wonderful, as always.  The music was hard as fuck.  Blew my brain
right out through my eardrums.  Those guys from Spacetime sure know how to

The GG Park info line claims that the rave in Marx Meadows has been
cancelled this week due to rain.  I'm looking out my window and all I see
is sun, sun, sun.  Oh well...

TAZ was wonderful, as always.  The music was hard as fuck.  Blew my brain
right out through my eardrums.  Those guys from Spacetime sure know how to
spin a mindfuck.  I guess a lot of people don't like to dance to

Subject: Rave on Tuesday


	Here's a good chance for some poetic terrorism.  On Tuesday
KZSU 90.1 (Stanford) is going to do a day-long radio event in connection 
with Vision, with some of the Vision DJs spinning.  Mike Mattel (the guy 
who makes those great flourescent banners) is helping organize a rave (a 
Reactive Peace gathering) in conjunction with the broadcast.  The idea 
is for everyone to bring their Walkmans, boom boxes, car stereos 
together, and have a sort of parallel distributed  sound system -- cool 
concept!  Everybody should meet @ the Stanford Stadium parking lot, and 
then caravans will depart @ 9, 12, and 3 for the event site -- somewhere 
outdoors near Palo Alto.  If anyone has a good car stereo system and 
wants to help out, give Mike a call @ (510)689-5697.

I've been meaning to post this for a long time...thanx for reminding me...

Is there anyone besides me who would luuuuuv to attend a NON-SMOKING
rave??  No offense to cancer-stick lovers out there, but doesn't
swimming in a fishbowl of carcinogens seem somehow anathema to the
idea of raves.  I remember a few months ago Brian derided a rave for
selling fried food, which makes perfect sense for brian to do...but I'd
pick eating an apple fritter over breathing in 500 people's secondhand
smoke anyday.  I'm not saying ALL raves should be nonsmoking, but i don't
recall ever seeing even ONE.  COmments?

btw -- like my new address?  It refers to what my punk band will be called
if i ever actually form it -- EVERLASTING GOBSTOPPER (copyright 1993

		This is a GREAT idea.  With all the fog, the heat, lightis,
dancing, and "stuff", the smoke can REALLY start to get to me.  Maybe
it would be easier to have "smoke out" rooms instead of baning it all
together.  We don't want our smoking friends to get all tweaked out :-)

i'm not exactly sure just what this has to do with raves, but
since we're on the subject, yes, i am interested in this information
but i can't telnet/finger/ping remote hosts as apple cuts off the
chain by having an apple.com with host off of it, and unless you
are on apple.com, you can't reach the outside world by directly
touching it.

do others have this same dilemna?

Well at least there are some sensible people out there!

Maybe you could generate a response that would probe why there is such
popularity for smoking amoung you people. Everytime I see some young guy or
gal taking a drag from a cig, I just shake my head with wonder. And its not
a small group of them, it seems very prevelant. I just don't get it and I
would love to hear from some of them why they find it attractive.

t'was cool.  "make a wish" was the birthday party for my friend renee,
held in the 1015 basement.  they've really updated the basement since
the last alternity - kick ass sound system and nice lighting too.  i
did in fact DJ for a bit although i think everybody missed it cos i
was on so early.  :(

lots of good music and it was fun being able to go upstairs to Martini
to check out the yuppieskum in their suits&ties desperately consuming
Refreshing Alcoholic Beverages and attempting to find a Mating Partner
of the appropriate gender.  after a while the barrage of alcohol fumes
and pheromones began to depress me so i wandered back down and saw
many smiling ravey faces and i felt much better.

a big thumbs up for a friendly party although i wish they had let
Carlos spin for a while...

-----

saturday i was psyched for pure until i heard it was in oakland.  i
was practically unconscious anyway since i hadn't got a lot of sleep
so i decided to blow it off.  how was it?

-----

and of course, sunday i was planning to go to the park but the message
said it was rained out so i wound up doing a whole bunch of nothing.

YES YOU ARE NOT ALONE!  That is one of the reasons I like outdoor
raves in remote areas like bonny dune cuz' in the morning after a
night of HARD dancing, perspiring and hyperventilating, my lungs
feel GREAT not like they are about to shrivel up, which is how they
feel after being in some dusty whearhouse with incessant smokers and
fog machines going.

WHAT?  That's absurd.  We usually get a quart or two of fog juice with a $35
rental and I've only used a quart and a half at the most.  That was at the
first one when I was so thrilled to be using a fog machine that I pumped it
hard.  Smoke was coming out of the doors on the second level and people were
complaining about it.  Recently, I've been using fog only to the point where
you can see the beams, and not the fog itself.  I even shut it off midway
through last Saturday's event.

Still, $50 - $100 worth of fog juice would be about ten gallons.  If they used
all of that in one night, you wouldn't be able to see your hand in front of
your face.  Even if it was a 5K warehouse.

It was at the Omni.  I didn't go but this is what I heard:
$20, no ins-and-outs, no coat check, great multiroom layout,
chill spaces, cool visuals, high energy, great music etc.  
It got busted at around 2:30.  No refunds.

So is everyone going to the Malachy benefit - ORACLE - at 1015 Folsom
this thursday?  It should be great.

In a loose response to "*SAGE* <ulvbiskt@mcl.mcl.ucsb.edu>"...

Yeah, but positivity just for the sake of positivity is pretty shallow goal
in and of itself. You'd have to be a fool not to acknowledge that the world
is a pretty fucked up place, so unmitigated positivity in the face of that
reality shows that one is either severly out of touch, on too many drugs,
or just plain stupid. I guess this hide-yer-head-in-the-sand approach to
problems might be ok for ostriches; however, something a little more
realistic and intelligent is needed if you want to take advantage of your
uniquely human ability to learn/resolve-problems/uplift/improve.

The only way your going to turn something negative around is to acknowledge
its existence, and do something about it. Now that doesn't mean you have to
wallow in negativity to do that (e.g. like the English deathrock trend),
but neither do you have to put on blinders and a plastic smile and live a
happy-go-lucky-life in lala land (like too many young/idealistic ravers
that I've met). Recognize that positivity and negativity need to coexist
and balance each other. Too much of either is a Bad Thing.

I see "positivity" used as a way for people to sidestep the harder issues
involved in identifying conflicts and resolving them. I've seen too many
cases where the cop-out "you're being negative" is used as a way to walk
out of a discussion right around the time that some real insights could be
gained from continuing the argument. Walking out is easy -- learning,
uplifting, resolving is hard and requires becoming intimately aquainted
with pain, suffering, negativity, and the cold-hard-facts-at-hand before
progress can be made. No pain, no gain....

Unfortunately, positivity-as-escapism is precisely what so many people
(esp. ravers) are in to nowadays -- it's become this overarching
politically-correct religion/philosophy/raison-d'etre that you're supposed
to apply to everything from a cop writing you a speeding ticket to world
political crises.  Well, i think that's just a load of hooey. Face it, like
many other religions, "positivity" it is a cop-out. 

> Keep it real.

Well, I have to agree with that... I do find it somewhat amusing that you
spend a few paragraphs relating thoroughly negative things about people/
customs/culture in Santa Barbara/LA, and then blast people about injecting
their two cent's worth of negativity into cyberspace here on SF raves.

I have and will continue to blast negativity into cyberspace whenever it
seems necessary. Just like you, despite your positivity, had plenty of
negative things to say. You can learn just as much from negativity as you
can from positivity. I have no problem with that, after all, it's reality.

hiya people i found the ajoining artical of the rave artical in the Eagle our
American U. newspaper...The Eagle March 29, 1993

     X MARKS THE SPOT
BY CHRISTINA SHAND

     As raving has become popular among college students, so has the drug
Ecstasy.  This hallucinogen/stimulant, which costs about $30 a hit in D.C.,
has gained widespread name recognition through its association with raves.

     Ecstasy is a synthetic methamphetamine that can be taken in the form of
tablets, capsules or as a free base powder.  The drug is technically a
stimulant, although it does have some of the same chemical and experiential
properties of a hallucinogen.

      The drug is illegal.  Introduced in the late 1960s, it was used in the
United States for psychotherapy until the passage of the Controlled Substances
Act in 1985.

     According to the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol & Drug Information,
the drug causes feeling of euphoria, emotional openness, a transcendantal
experience and clarified insight.  It may also cause such negative effects as
feelings of anxiety and paranoia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, blurred
vision and convulsions.  Heart rate and blood pressure increase after taking
the drug, and then drop after about an hour.  Insomnia and depression may
occur for up to two weeks after the drug is taken.

     Jennifer Phillips, an information representative at the Clearinghouse,
said Ecstasy does have addictive qualities.

"People do build up a craving for the drug," Phillips said.  "This
psychological craving to achieve the desired effects causes frequent users to
take increasingly higher doses to obtain greater effect, which in turn
increases the risk for unwanted physical and psychological consequences."

     Phillips said there is some concern over the use of the drug at raves.

     "We do get calls from parents who will say, 'My son/daughter went to a
Rave.' and they want to know what exactly goes on there," Phillips said.

     Cindy Smyth, a raver who has tried the drug twice, said she admits that it
 can enhance the experience.  Smyth tried Ecstasy the first time because she
was curious and had read and heard much about it.  She tried it a second time
in order to totally understand the experience.  Smyth recalls her experiences a
s lasting about three or four hours and being very euphoric.

     "Everything seemed really happy," she said.  "My friends remembered that I
kept saying 'Wow' all night long."

     Smyth also remembers having a heightened sensory experience.

     "Textures and skin felt incredible." she said.  "Colors seemed vibrant and
beautiful.  Everything tasted really sweet.  It was more of a sensual
experience than a sexual one."

     One of the times she used the drug, Smyth experienced lockjaw, one of the
negative possible effects of using Ecstasy.  Sucking on a baby pacifier is one
way to alleviate this effect.

     "I'm not really into drugs," Smyth said, although she admits that she
would consider doing it again.  "I don't think much about it.  I don't think
it's physically addictive.  It can enhance (a rave), but it can enhance
anything."

     There is cause for alarm over casual use of the drug at raves.  As a
stimulant, Ecstasy has serious potential dangers.  According to the AU Student
Health Center, long term use may cause permanent damage to the brain, heart,
lungs and other organs.  Because stimulants interfer4e with vision,
coordination, judgment and reflexes in much the same way that alcohol does,
they can cause accidents and car crashes.  Mixing the drug with other ones is
extremely dangerous as the effects are unpredictable and can be deadly.

     An amphetamine overdose (Ecstasy belongs to the amphetamine family of
stimulants) can cause hallucinations, convulsions, tremors and possible death.
In cases where dependence occurs, withdrawal can include apathy, long periods
of sleep, irritability and depression.  The center also said the hallucinogenic
properties of the drug can cause unpredictatble, violent behavior and
emotional instability.

OK, that was just a test. :-)

Anyway, 7282 is back up, and is the port of choice.  Just remember,
that if for some reason, if vrave isn't running on 7282, check 7281
and 7283...

We now return you to your regularly scheduled program...

In desperation for a location, I placed an ad in the classifieds that read,
"Wanted: 10,000 sq ft warehouse for weekend use."  I'd done this before, but
had mediocre response, and never had anything come of it.  I figured this time
would be my last shot at it.  Surprise, surprise, it worked.

The people who responded had a 6,000 square foot warehouse that they used for
manufacturing a cardboard kitty litter box and cardboard bakery boxes.  When I
was shown the inside, it was about half full with palettes of cardboard.  The
woman who was leasing the place assured me that the majority of this would be
gone by the date I wanted to use it.  It was a little smaller than I would
have preferred, but it was literally the only location that had been offered
in response to the ad.  I offered her $400 if we had to buy insurance (usually
about $300) or $500 if we rode on her insurance (cheaper).  It ended up being
$100 extra to ride on their insurance and I honestly think she pocketed it
rather than buying us a rider.  I really didn't care though.  Insurance has
never been a real concern for us, just the people we rent from.

I decided that we would fly in a DJ for this event.  Moonpup came to mind
immediately.  People had told me that he was very dedicated to the scene and
was always willing to bend easily.  I had remembered he had worked in LA
during the birth of raves there, so I was curious to meet him and talk shop.
Also, in comparison to other DJs, he was rather inexpensive to do.  I called
him up and told him I wanted to bring him to Salt Lake.  Apparently, his
girlfriend's parents lived here, so he was very interested in coming.  He was
amazed that we had been doing it since February '91.  He thought that we were
just starting out, but he said he knew that Salt Lake would always be a good
place for it to happen.  He agreed to drop his price a bit if we paid his
airfare, as for lodging, all he wanted was a comfortable couch.

My friend Grant came up with the idea to use a picture of Winnie the Pooh, our
unofficial mascot, stretching and yawning with the line "The Hibernation is
Over" for the flyer.  We had thrown a small house party on New Years, but in
reality our last large event had taken place in the beginning of October (Sea
Monkey Love Castle).  People wondered if "Taste" was still around.  The flyer
was designed and the back wording was simple.  I've grown really tired of
circus-like hype surrounding raves and I've been shooting more to surprise
people with effects than promise them something I can't deliver.  I've always
found that it was important to put the price on the flyer as well.  $10 has
become a standard, it is also our plateau.  Unless it is drastically
expensive, like the Communion tour was, $10 is the maximum I will charge for
an underground here.  So the end result was a flyer that just stated Moonpup
and myself as DJs, with "Rites of Spring", the date, and a few tag lines.
Brevity is beautiful.  We mailed out the flyers to our list (last count 260)
and left it at that.

I originally wanted to either fly in a DJ or do extensive video.  I decided to
do both.  The people who had done the video for "Sea Monkey" had since gone on
to do a local club.  Frankly, I wasn't very satisfied with what they had done
for us.  They needed five people guest listed and they all got tired around
2:00.  Even what they were doing for the club now was pretty pathetic.  Cheap
video mixer effects over MTV's "Liquid TV" was about as far as they went
creatively.  I had originally wanted another friend to do "Sea Monkey" but he
was under the assumption that he wouldn't get paid for it.  I made it clear to
him this time that I wanted him to do it and he should give me a bid.  He
couldn't figure out what he wanted to charge, so I offered him $200.  He
accepted and went to work rendering scenes and collecting stock footage to mix
with.

Myself, John, and John's girlfriend took a vacation to San Francisco the week
before the 27th.  We met up with Moonpup at a weekly.  He was really excited
to do this job.  I gave him half of his fee there.

I wanted to do really nice audio as well.  I rented a large sound system, and
a smaller one and intended to do surround effects.  When I finally found out
that nobody in town could rent me a sound processor to do these effects
(apparently the Ensoniq DP4 is the only one), I asked a friend if I could
borrow his home processor.  As for displaying the video, I found a local
"Rent-To-Own" could rent us 32 inch tubes for $35 a week.  This was in
contrast to the the audio/video places that wanted $125 for one night.  When I
arrived back in town, I called the place and they told me that they didn't
have any 32 inch available.  They told me they had four 27" though, so I went
down to rent them.  Surprise, surprise, they only had one.  I left and wailed
to John about how stupid they were.  John had been highly impressed with a
projection unit we had seen in San Francisco.  He asked his neighbor, who
worked for an audio/visual how much we could get one for.  She said $200, but
she'd waive the insurance for us.  John went and rented the 27" from the
~Rent-To-Own" then reserved the projection TV.  I managed to get another 27"
from a friend.  Then I had to get a video distribution amplifier to split the
signal cleanly, this was $35.

When the 26th rolled around, I went to the warehouse to find most of the
stock still there.  I realized that we would have to use the existing stock as
partitions and just deal with it.  A forklift had to be rented.  John and I
spent most of Friday night rearranging the warehouse.  We built walls around
the door so people could not see inside, then built a small chill-space off
the side of the dance floor.  The dance floor had one entrance.  The DJ and
video table itself was made up of flattened stacked cardboard.

A nice aspect of the warehouse was the 30" ceiling.  This was the highest we'd
ever had to deal with.  Putting the usual effects lights from the rafters
would really breath new life into effects which were getting tired anyway.
John came up with the idea to hang kites from the ceiling as well, but this
was abandoned when Grant borrowed a large parachute from his brother.  I shot
the laser off the bottom of it.  It really looked great.

My surround sound was not working well.  The processor sounded like crap
coming through amplifiers.  I gave up and ran the audio signal into the video
distribution amp and then ran two signals out to the separate amp packs.
Another problem was the fact that the power setup in the warehouse completely
sucked.  We had to use a generator for "Sea Monkey" and even THAT was better
than what I was dealing with now.  Extension cords had to be run all over the
place.  There were absolutely no outlets near where I had the DJ booth
positioned.  Once everything was setup, breakers were getting thrown on the
lights, the video, and the front sound.  This was baffling since I thought I
had each of those on separate circuits.  I had to eventually run cords into
their office to find other sources.

The video projector was beautiful.  We had a 20 foot image on a back wall that
was as sharp as a tack.  As for the video itself, the end result was awe
inspiring.  He took two VCRs, a Video Toaster, a camera, and tons of stock
footage that he had collected.  Time lapse photography of flowers opening,
milk dropping, cells multiplying, thrown over footage of canyons, clouds, and
of course fractals.  It was literally eye candy to watch.  My favorite effect
was when he took 1950's footage of people in a swimming pool and reversed the
color.  It was really etherial to see.  I wanted to record the whole night on
video tape, and got two SVHS tapes to do 10 hours on EP.  Unfortunately, we
couldn't figure out how to switch the SVHS recorder to that speed, so we got 5
hours on SP.  All the audio and mixing was recorded as well during that time
period.

Moonpup made it in about half an hour before 11:00, the time we opened the
doors and started.  We agreed that he would play his set after me, about 1:30.
I had a local community radio DJ friend who I had worked with in the past do a
set at 11:00.  He was leaving town in a few weeks, so it was a favor to him.
I was to start at 12:00.

The front amp was having problems.  Even the monitor was losing power on some
heavy bass.  I found out after it was all over that it was most likely plugged
into a 15 amp circuit rather than a 20 amp like it needed.  We had three 600W
amps, huge bass bins and people were telling us to turn it up!  The volume
wasn't near enough as loud as it could have been, however this turned out to
be a blessing in disguise since it was just barely carrying outside and there
were a few residential homes near.  If it was any louder, we could have
attracted a lot of complaints.  I've decided that from now on, I'm paying the
audio shop to do delivery, setup, and takedown.  I'm sick of hauling speakers
and then being baffled at various problems as well.

I did my first set, which went over moderately well.  I was playing a lot of
trance, but the crowd was wanting harder stuff.  I picked it up a bit and
played some real funk which got them moving.  What then amazed me is while I
was playing Intermix's "Down and Out", Moonpup came up to me and said, "This
is great!  What is this?"  That was a real shock.  Things got weirder over the
night.

Moonpup came on after me at 1:00.  He started messing with the 1200 I had
recently purchased and the second on I had to rent.  I had originally planned
to get two new 1200's, but the shop had sold my second one by accident.  He
started to curse at the rented table.  It was apparent that it was a piece of
shit.  He then started to curse me, by this time we were into the middle of
his first track.  "NEVER give a DJ a piece of shit like this."  I responded,
"Look pal, this isn't my fault.  It was either this table or nothing.  I had
no idea that the rental shop didn't have a clue."  People on the floor started
to notice that the two DJs weren't in a happy-go-lucky-ravey mood.  Moonpup
calmed down and then asked for a quarter.  We already had two pennies on the
needle already.  He taped that down and shook his head while cuing.  He told
me to get a CD cued up.  We had about 20 seconds before the first track was
going to end.  I started to scramble.  I was taking the CD out of the case,
when the track started to fade.  Blammo, he started the second record on the
crap table.  "Look, its going to skip," he said.  Nothing happened.  It kept
going.  Moonpup was still angry, but continued.  I ran to find my friend who
owned two 1400's at home.  I asked him if I could borrow one.  He agreed and I
drove to his house to get it while Moonpup was playing.  When I brought it
back, we swapped the cartridges and taped it up to the wobbly arm.  It was
working much better, but still not 100%.

Moonpup started to relax.  At about 2:00 things really started to groove.
The sound was just loud enough, the bad 1200 skipped only infrequently but
wasn't terribly noticeable.  I relieved John from watching the parking lot and
he appreciated the break.  I was half expecting the cops to come and shut
everything down, but they would just drive by and keep on going like nothing
was happening.  A neighbor came over and said he couldn't sleep because of the
noise.  He left, changed his clothes, then came back and enjoyed himself.

It felt so good to be back in the saddle again.  Because we had sent flyers
out to only the mailing list, we didn't have to deal with a lot of bad
attitudes.  The smart bar was doing brisk business and sold out of water and
oranges.  I was originally opposed to selling water bottles, but people were
actually amazed were were only charging $1 for them.  The smart drinks were
just as yummy as I remembered them, and made even easier with Nutrient Cafe's
mixes.  We found that by using a little Sprite, it made it more of a "drink"
rather than a "good-for-you drink".  People weren't complaining to wait in
lines for the bathrooms (we had to rent one for the men's), they weren't
complaining to wait in line to go outside, they weren't complaining at the
door price.  They were just happy to be there, happy that we were back.  There
wasn't one bad attitude in the house all night.  I was really proud.

Moonpup's set started to go in the unbelievable realms.  I was on the floor
and people were just ecstatic over it.  "So Pete, how long are you going to
keep him here?"  "I'll move back home and let this guy live in my apartment,
I'll even pay rent for him."  I was really impressed for the first time since
I saw Orb play.  Once he moved into some really funky stuff and stripped off
his shirt, things just exploded.  The whole place was bouncing.

I played a second set at 4:00 AM.  This time I threw on some hard acid
immediately to satisfy the requests for hardcore we were getting all night.
Then I sloped it back into trance.  It worked a lot better.  Moonpup took a
break in the chill area, then came back at about 4:30 when I was doing trance.
Although I was spinning a bit of vinyl for the first time, he was fascinated
by the CDs.  He told me that he had always been an advocate of CDs, but had
been disappointed with the equipment.  Denon had sent him the first model of
their DJ deck and he hated it, but he commented about how much better the 2000
looked.  I showed him a few things and he watched interested, then he left and
started dancing on the floor.  Then he repeatedly asked me what I was playing.
Coil's "The Snow"???  He hadn't heard "The Snow" before?  I hadn't played that
for almost six months and was just doing again because I loved it so much.
Then he asked about other tracks.  I was amazed.  Maybe my collection isn't as
crummy as I thought it was.  He thumbed through my stuff telling me that I had
some really great finds.  I was dumbfounded, but he sure stroked my ego.

Greg in Berkeley managed to find me a pair of technician flashlight glasses
that I had been hunting for.  These suckers were so wonderful to have.  I
could see EVERYTHING.  No more messing with the flashlight.  Plus they look
great.  Moonpup ranted about how cool they were.

At 5:30, there were about fifty people left.  Moonpup put on two records and
told me that he wanted to finish up with them.  Then he decided to do another
set altogether.  He played until 6:15, when there were ten people on the
floor.  It was utterly beautiful.  Trancey, deep, and funky I danced like I
hadn't in a long time.  He threw on a final piece, a white label acid jazz
track that he had just purchased.  He told me that he hadn't even heard it
yet.  God, it was unbelievable.  My favorite, big band music over a funky
beat.  He came out on the floor and boogied with the rest of us.  The video
guy, who had stayed behind the desk all night, continued his magic.  My only
regret was the fact that I wasn't recording it at the time.  The tapes had run
out at 5:00.

When it was all over, John and I took Moonpup to breakfast.  He told us he was
eager to come back to Salt Lake, insisting that what we had heard that night
was not him at his best.  He told us that there were a few surprises for him.
First was the CDs, he was really blown away by it.  Second was the fact that
there were people with beer there.  He said usually he's the only person who
brings beer to a rave.  The crowd was good to him, and after the turntables
had been resolved, he really enjoyed things.

Original-To: MAILSEQ:sfraves@sfraves.stanford.edu


Lucky me, I'll be in Amsterdam next week for a 10 day vacation (not to rub it
in, or anything) and was wondering if anyone out there knows what's up in that
neck of the woods?  Any hints on clubs/raves/places to hang out or pick up
fliers?  

Mykl says the scene in Europe is a lot more heavy duty, with harder, faster
techno, rather than the trancey housey stuff we get here, but I'm willing to
try just about anything.  I'll be there over Easter weekend, which I hear is a
big party time because everyone gets off from work the Friday before and the
Monday after.  Four-day weekends always seem to be conducive to rave planning.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated.  When I get back, I'll post a review and
tell you all about it.

Share and enjoy,

yea...  i was at 1015 flosom and had an amzing time...
this was my first event in that area...  at first i was shocked..  seeing those
yuppie suits and alcoholics with big hair made me question where the hell i was 
and if i was at the right place..  i asked the security person and he led me to the basement..  as i went down, it was beginning to look more like it..  even
though it was kinda empty at around midnight, there was some good groovin 
going down..
the highlight and peak of the evening was when Moonpup spinned..  he was amazing
he is emerging as the top DJ in my list..  His set was even better than the 
that in C2...

p.s.  i like to say hi to Bob, John, Bill, Max, and all others i met there.
	(including the guy i met at around 4AM but the name escapes me)

Subject: Reactive Peace tomorrow (Tuesday) 12 noon - 6pm


Hi.

The organizer for the Reactive Peace thing going on tomorrow
wanted me to let you all know that it has been changed slightly.
Again, this is going to be a gathering in conjunction with a
radio broadcast on KZSU, with everyone bringing their own sound
source to form a unified event.

It will start at noon and go until about 6pm.  It is a free event,
in the South Bay near Stanford U., with the meeting point at the
first parking lot past the stadium.  Listen for tunes for the info
point.  Someone should be there at least until 3 or 4 to direct
people all day, not just at the times listed earlier.  If no one is
around or you can't find it, call the station, KZSU at
(415) 725-4868 for more information.

KZSU will possibly be setting up a sound system at the site after
the broadcast to continue the event.  Also raffle tickets for
Instinct and Vision will be given away during the event.

The organizer wants you to remember to try to bring a radio,
boombox, car stereo, etc. along with you

MEGARAVE '93
Radical
Ascent into
Virtual space and
Euphoric rhythms

by Katherine D. Ramirez

     "And he, repulsed, a short tale to make, fell into a sadness, then into a
fast, thence into a watch, thence into a weakness, thence into a lightness,
and, by this declention, into the madness wherein now he raves."
--from "Hamlet" by William Shakespeare

     There is a new revolution that is gathering momentum with each passing
day.  It is not a foreign revolution with guns, hostile citizens and oppressive
dictators.  It is a cultural revolution taking place within the borders of our
own country that can be summed up in one simple, four-letter word: RAVE.

     Webster defines a rave as the following:
     RAVE(v) 1. to speak wildly, irrationally, or incoherently 2. to roar;rage
3. to speak with wild enthusiasm (n) 1. the state or act of raving 2. informal
an extravagantly enthusiactic opinion or review

     Carlo Cruz is a raver and DJ from Staten Island, N.Y., and co-editor and
half owner of a rave publication titled "Klastrip" with a circulation expanding
into the thousands along the East Coast.  He defines a rave in terms that are
only slightly less formal.

"We (the rave movement) are unlike any other modern musical movement in
the world because we have gone beyond the music and we have stepped into
culture.  We have our own music, our own literature, drugs, speech, clothing, a
rt..." Cruz explained.

     A rave, in the simplest terms, is an all-night dance party that travels
throughout the country to different locations.  These rave parties, sponsored
by different promotion companies, are characterized by various styles of techno
music, loosely fitting clothing to enable people to dance comfortably all
night, lots of laser lights to do funny things to your head, and large groups
of random young people who travel from all over the country to convene upon
that one location.

     There are other characteristics that are commonly accociated with raves
like drugs.  But it is widely disputed how important drugs are the rave scene.
One good argument for drugs being intergral to raves is that much of the music
and the psychedelic clothing were developed to enhance whatever substance that
people were on.

     Many different varieties of rave music are created in order to enhance
someone's "trip" in different ways.  For example, "trance" music is much what
it sounds like it tries to induce, and it is much softer than other forms of
music, whereas "hardcore techno" has a faster, harder-pounding rhythm to really
get your adrenaline going.

     The clothing at raves is very bright and cartoon-like.  Many of the
T-shirts at raves are designer rip-offs of common pop-culture items, like Cheer
detergent and Rice Krispies cereal.  These common designs are altered by
strategically replacing certain words with the word "rave."  These subtle
changes are made to make the viewere look twice at something they would
otherwise just glance over.  This effect has been compared to a drug trip in
that common, everyday things do not appear as they once seemed.

     For these reasons it is fair to say that drugs have at least effected what
 the rave scene is today, but many ravers are attracted only to the music, the
freedom a rave provides, and the opportunity to meet new people.

     Raves have become an incredible phenomenon with young people throughout
the country.  All-weekend raves with thousands of participants are becoming
notorious in not only cultural megacites like New York and Los Angles, but
San Francisco, Boston, and Washington D.C., as well.

     It is not surprising that raves are spreading like wildfire to all parts
of the country.  They provide a forum for youth to meet, dance and be
themselves.  Raves are also somewhat exclusive.  Many are held at locations
that remain undisclosed until the raver purchases the tickets.

     Then at the purchasing location he or she will receive directions.  This
exclusive feeling often associated with raves make them more appealing to
people.Curiosity and the desire for music, or new drugs, as the case may be,
are also appealing draws to raves.

     Like most other cultural revolutions, the increasingly popular rave
movement has political roots as well.

     AU sophomore Todd Ayer frequents rave parties and has many friends
involved in the promotions of raves.  He reasons that the political scene of
the past few years has encouraged the popularity, and perhaps the need, for
raves.

     "With politics the way it has been the past few years, the youth of this
country has felt very stifled," Ayer said.  "they needed a new movement based u
pon fun and haveing a good time."

     When asked how big he believes the rave scene is here on AU's campus, he
replied it is big with certain crowds of people.

     "Raves appeal to all different crowds of people.  Everyone can go and have
 a good time if they can let others go and have a good time as well.  The only
thing that's really not accepted at a rave is prejudice," said Ayer.

     "Raving is all different people coming together...it's African Americans,
and whites, it's gays and non-gays,[i know i used the term homosexuals and hert
erosexuals]it's males and females...that doesn't often happen in society," sai
d Kameny.

     Kameny's deep involvement in the rave movemnt is proof that the rave scene
 is very active here at AU.  She co-founded [with Doug Zimmerman] an electronic
 mailing list for raves called D.C. Raves, which covers raves in the Washington
-Baltimore area.  D.C. Raves began here at AU in December.

     Through D.C. Raves, any AU student can have access to rave information and
 locations by logging onto the university mainframe system.  From any of the
computer labs on campus someone can send electronic-mail to the following
address:
[dcraves-request@american.edu] and recieve free information.

     Accessing rave information through e-mail is also done through other
universities in different parts of the country including Stanford and MIT.  At
AU, D.C. RAves helped to promote a mircorave (a small party) that took place in
the Gianni Lounge on the forth floor of Bulter Pavilion on Friday night from 11
p.m. to 7 a.m.

     Raves may not be a permanent fixture in our society, but it is certainly a
strong force that continues to gain popularity and momentum.  Rave on!

     The next rave in Washington, D.C., is on Friday, April 2, and called
Back to the Future."  Tickets can be purchased at Musicnow record store.

     For more information, call (202) 331-4465.

The Omni has a sign that says "Capacity: 450".  I wonder how many people
the sleazy ol' Pure promoters tried to pack in (at $20 a head).

Subject: Laura Huxley - makoomba
Reply-To: rnj%lila@us.oracle.com

Magical Blend ("Religion, Psychedelics, & Creativity")  magazine issue 38 has  
an abridged excerpt of an interview with Laura Huxley (writer, musician,  
psychological counselor, wife of author Aldous Huxley) that will appear in  
Brown's and McClen's book *Mavericks of the Mind*, Crossing Press, 1993.   


an excerpt from the excerpt:

"...Primitive cultures sometimes use very simple means with effective  
results.

   "I was visiting Brazil with Aldous, and in Rio on a Saturday night we went  
to see a ritual called the "makoomba."  The people would start to dance  
together, sing, and go on and on.  By 3:00 A.M., they would be sewating and  
breathing enormously, the frustration was gone, and they would be laughing  
and dancing.  Aldous spoke enthusiastically about "makoomba," saying how more  
effective and less expensive it was than lying on the psychoanalyst's couch.   
Now we know that while dancing, running, and swimming, the body produces  
chemicals called endorphins which give us a happy, elated feeling.  We have  
our own inner chemical factory.  We have to learn how to use it well."

One could claim that I have a conflict of interest (I certainly do in
some sense) but I had just finished listening to Moonpup's C2 set
roughly 6 times in 2 days right before Friday (cassette mastering) and
I think the C2 set was overall much better than the set at Make a
Wish.  There were peaks during Make a Wish which got up to (and even,
depending on your taste, momentarily beyond) the level of C2, but
there were some very weak times as well, at least for me.  From
listening to the C2 tapes, that set just jelled really well and didn't
really have any weak spots.

Enough, it's all just opinion and conjecture anyway... Moonpup didn't
do for me at Make a Wish what he did for me at C2 (blow my mind!)
though he did spin a really nice set, one of the best of the evening
(well, I left at 5 AM...)

It could have been the head space I was in, but I doubt it, I was in
pretty much the same mental state at both events, if anything, a
better one at Make a Wish.

I definitely agree, though, that Moonpup is an incredible DJ, the best
one I've ever watched up close.

Ramble on,
Bob

Well, it was all for the best ...  after the bust, Pure moved over to the

It seems as though ALL the clubs recently are under the gun.  Groove Kitchen
was shut down by some overzealous Nazis who closed it due to someone NOT
having their ID....COINCIDENTALLY, THE SAME NIGHT, AND THE SAME TWO COPS<
AND THE TWO NON_ID PLANTS got SOund Factory busted....It is obvious that
this fucking city has no crime, no rapes, no murder, no assaults going on
that they can commit cops to the honorable duty of busting parties where
people are having a good time...and why not....hell, there is only 1 cop for
every 576 people and since they seems to have plenty of time, why not bust a
party!

I also think that the cops are getting their asses WAXED.  There is big
payola going down, but nobody is talking.  Has ANYONE ever wondered why, on
Sunday, whilst everyone smokes pot, does massive drugs, get shit faced drunk
that there have been NO COPS in front of DNA?  Man I've sat in peoples cars,
tweeked out of my gourd, smoking massive amounts of Hash and Pot, full on
drin king with open containers in the car, and no cops...EVER.

I did see one a few weeks back....ONE.  Haven't seen any since.

I would suggest that if anyone wants to throw a party then you better have
deep pockets...No, your most expensive item will not be the DJ's (suprise),
or the Space (double Suprise), or the 1 Gigawatt Surround SOund System
(double super secret whammy suprise).  It will be the amount of money you
have to wax a cop so that your party doesn't get pre-maturely JACKED!

Peace.

And power to the deep pockets...this city has a foundation of GRAFT!

Subject: UNiverse

Hello from Seattle,
  I'm a silent observer of sfraves, however, I must brak the silence and share
what I've learned. A friend told me about a planned monster/mega rave to be
held in the UK this September. It is being dubbed at this point, simply
"UNiverse". It will obviously be put on by the UNiverse production team. It
will be outdoors with several big tops set up, plenty of concessions, and
the polical activists will be taking up shop. (ala Lollapallooza). The 
promoters are billing it as the largest rave ever held! (They expect 50,000
people to participate!) if this turns out to be true, consider my "UNiverse
or bust" fund to start now. Anyone else heard anything? I'll post more as I
find out more.
 
                      jack-in, rave-on, peace-out!
                                psiborg


ps the seattle scene is ripping!

pss look out for northwestRave coming soon to a host near you!

brian, blessed cyborg without whose dynamic deveotion to duty this virtual
community wouldn't exist, took a thwack at TTTTT (Tulips) in last week's
guide.  There have been many similar thwacks at promoters over the months,
even by yours truly.  PLEASE, make sure u know your shit before dissin 
someone whose biz depends on word of mouth.

Mark, maybe the main promoter of both TTTTT & Where Wild Things Are is one
of
the most conscientious & in-the-spirit promoters I know for the 18+ crowd.
If he's worth dissin in this scene, there is no scene worth a shit.  

I know he is not cut from the same cloth as Rhythm Umpire(sic), and they
couldn't touch the vibes Mark puts out.  If there was a direct connection
between others involved, i didn't know about it.  TTTTT & Wild Things are
some of the best 18+ events around, and it hurts them to dis Mark unfairly.

*************

The recent comments about the SF bust scene are a strong indication ;that
the scene is growing near critical mass.  The club owners are fighting back
because their alcohol-derived profits are dropping.  The cops go after the
"parties" because they're easy targets.  (It's easier to go after the turn-
the-cheek christians than the lions.)  The city is not worried about rapes
and thefts, unless they happen in Presidio heights.  But the empty mind of
Frank Jordan sees a golden opportunity to make political hay by going after
an easy target, one the public can only believe from the media that is worth
shutting down because of its anti-social, anti-work ethic drug use.

Exactly like 1969.

Wherever you can find political clout, use it now.  Wherever you can find
even-handed media exposure, milk it now.  Don't expect results, expect only
to learn more than you ever thought possible.  Expect your perspectives to
change continually.  Expect extreme frustration at how silly the opposition
to dancing all nite in ecstasy seems.  Try to keep laughing.  (conjure up
visions of yourselves freaking out about your kids weird zero-gravity
electro-stim parties 30 years from now.)  

or better yet, head for the hills.  be like Crazy Horse.  Throw smaller
parties in rural isolation, though you better be prepared for stone age cops
who make the busts in SF seem like chill rooms.  

If you wish to rpomote large events in SF, you got to do the kiss-the-
Romans'-butts scene.

Most important, keep the faith.  You're already making a big difference.

Peace,
alpha-10

The music was good, but not a lot of people at first.  I was running 
up and down a lot that night.  The music in the main floor was also
hopping at times, so I had a good time there too (Of course I had to
deal with elbows and shoulders in my ribs a lot as well :(

That was me :)  I had hoped to meet more of the sfravers that night,
but it was a little difficult, especially that late when they had closed
both dance floors upstairs and let everyone down.  Thanks for wearing 
your identifying tag.  I tend to be shy at first, so I don't always 
walk up to people and start talking.  How do the rest of you manage 
to meet others?

Well, I finally gave up at 5:30 'cause I had to work at 8:00.

 Yeah!  But do you think that they will fix the sound system?  The last
 time I went there it sounded like SH**.  Seriously, my ears were ringing
 for days.....  Maybe Preston had time to iron things out in this

XDZebra Review #26

BPMs!  The "dance factor" grew more useless over time as my collection of
styles broadened, so they've been tossed in favor of BPM readings.

CJ Bolland: The 4th Sign

Meat Beat Manifesto: Mindstream
Play It Again Sam: BIAS 232CD / BIAS 232CDR
Disc 1:
1  130  04:14 Mindstream (Stream of Consciousness Mix)
2  130  06:21 Mindstream (Psychedelically Speaking)
3  141  06:56 Mindstream (The Aphex Twin Remix)
4  123  05:15 Original Control (Electro The Robot) (92 bpm intro)
Disc 2:
1  130  08:26 Mindstream (Mind the Bend the Mind)
2  130  04:45 Mindstream (Fire Escape Version)
3  103  07:20 Paradise Found

Comments: Groovey as funk mixes par usual Meat Beat Manifesto.  The original
"Mindstream" didn't thrill me much.  The vocals are rather weak and don't add
much to the instrumental backing.  Not surprisingly, the best mixes on these
two discs are the ones which don't use the lyrics much.  "Stream" manages a
country mix, "Psych" drops most of the vocals for some swirling sounds and
even a bit of chipmunk samples, "Aphex" is rather standard Aphex, but still
has an incredible beat, "Mind the Bend" is Orbital's entry with over five
minutes of wild Orbitalesque sound before the lyrics kick in.  Finally, "Fire
Escape" pays homage to disco with a funky beat and a 70's bass.  My favorite
mix of all though, is the DHS mix of "Original Control".  Head spinning DHS
manipulation of sound and beat loops, plus samples from my favorite track on
the Satyricon album.

Summary: 9/10.  I paid $18 for this import, which meant two discs, two weeks,
and another copy of "Paradise Found".  In other words, buy the domestic for $5.


Excursions in Ambience - A Collection of Ambient-House Music
Caroline: CAROL 1733-2
1  101  06:10 Tranquility Bass: Mya Yadana
2  125  05:10 The Future Sound of London: Calcium
3  128  06:34 Higher Intelligence Agency: Solid Motion (Black Hole Mix)
4  115  05:12 Ultramarine: Saratoga (Upstate Mix)
5  125  07:35 Psychedelic Research Lab: Tarenah
6  129  08:11 Psychick Warriors of Gaia: Obsidian (Deconstructure Edit)
7  119  06:08 777: Mia (The Fisherman Mix)
8  127  05:05 It's Thinking: Afterglow
9  101  06:51 Banco de Gaia: Desert Wind (El Ahram Mix)
10 115  02:47 Sub Sub: Past

Comments:  With names like this, it is hard to go wrong, and I have a hard
time trying to find anything wrong with this compilation.  Sure, the original
"Deconstructure" of "Obsidian" is great, but it is also 20 minutes long.
"Calcium" by FSOL is nothing new, but I wasn't upset at hearing it again.
Exist Dance has been recognized with the "Mya Yadana" and what a beautiful
piece it is, replete with baby sounds and samples about the Madonna.  Fine
remixes of fine originals are present with Ultramarine and Banco de Gaia.  The
most pleasent surprise for me was the Sub Sub track "Past".  It is silky
smooth with a nice guitar overlay, not extremely shakeable, but it sure feels
good going through your head.

Summary: 10/10.  Nothing wrong with this compilation, and at a domestic price
this is the best domestic ambient-house collection yet.


Ambient Dub Volume 2. Earthjuice. A Compilation Album
Beyond Records: RBADCD3
1   92  07:02 Original Rockers: DeMat DubRim
2  108  06:22 The Higher Intelligence Agency: W.H.Y.
3  119  05:47 The Higher Intelligence Agency: Speed Learn
4  124  05:13 Original Rockers: Underwater World of Jah Custeau (Groove Corp)
5   97  06:45 G.O.L.: Soma Holiday
6   82  05:06 G.O.L.: No Bounds
7   94  06:52 Banco de Gaia: Shanti
8  120  07:33 Banco de Gaia: Lai Lah (Deeply Sirius Mix)
9  112  05:09 A.P.L.: The Calling
10 120  04:46 A.P.L.: Universal Message
11 120  16:31 Insanity Sect.: Subliminal Air

Comments: Although not as widely spread as Volume 1, Volume 2 continues the
tradition with highly original tracks.  I still have a distaste for Original
Rockers, their work is just too much on the reggae side to move me at all.
G.O.L. once again shows us what Phantasia was missing with cosmic poetry that
borders on the edge of silly but still sounds good.  They also manage to push
the BPMs down into the nether regions but still produce something funky enough
to dance to.  A.P.L. and Insanity Sect give us deeply trancey movers.
Finally, Banco de Gaia, my favorite returns with a lacking track "Shanti" and
a way cool trance that moves all over the place with "Lai Lah".

Summary: 8/10.  Almost as good as the original, but still holds up the
standard well.


Trancefusion
Sonic/Instinct: SNC-2021-2
1  126  05:28 Violet Force: Planet E.
2  130  05:29 High Lonesome Sound System: Waiting For The Lights
3  134  05:05 Happy as Hell: Mean Go Getter
4  137  05:12 The Nighttripper: Tone Exploitation
5  128  05:57 The Odd Company: We Are Experienced!
6  124  07:56 The Irresistible Force: Space is the Place
7  120  06:32 Trancesetters: Fantasizing
8  145  04:50 Reality Studio: Utopia
9  127  11:54 Orbital: The Naked And The Dub
10 145  06:01 Niko: Always
11 130  06:12 Westbam: Let Yourself Go
12 128  04:41 Paradise 3000: Normizon 5am

Comments: Sonic and Instinct's first attempt at a trance compilation.  Besides
the Violet Force and High Lonesome Sound System tracks, this is a rather
standard entry.  The other tracks are good, but not fantastic.  One of note is
the ever changing "Space is the Place" which this time has some really great
backing rhythms and various samples of people singing or talking about space.
The main problem with this comp is that several of the tracks have been
available for quite a while.  "Utopia" by "Reality Studio" is cool, but almost
too Euro for my taste.  Niko's "Always" is a slick transition from trance into
hardcore.  Other than that, none of the others really caught my ear.

Summary: 6/10.  Domestic price though.  If you don't already own everything on
here, it might be a good buy.


Elevation: Can You Feel It/Spiral Trance
Novamute: CD NOMU3
1  136  05:36 Can You Feel It (Mutation Mix)
2  136  06:43 Can You Feel It (Extended Mix)
3  126  04:56 Spiral Trance (Into The Light Mix)
4  136  04:43 Can You Feel It (Remix)

Comments:  As much as I now hate the acidic "Dominator" sound, Elevation
manages to put it to good use.  On top of that, the wailing diva isn't bad as
well.  Elevation's forte though is their use of breaks.  Each remix has a
unique blend of breakbeats and hardcore that really moves you.  The piano riff
is cool as well.  "Spiral Trance" uses a short Enya sample, then jumps into
more hardcore, nothing spectacular.

Summary: 7/10.  Good, but rather cliched and pop techno in style.


CJ Bolland: The 4th Sign
R&S: 92024 CD
1  140  06:45 Mantra
2  138  04:58 Nightbreed
3  153  07:21 Thrust
4  150  06:37 Aquadrive
5  143  06:45 Pendulum
6  151  05:09 Spring Yard
7  138  06:30 Camargue
8  144  06:07 Inside-Out
9  154  10:02 Jungle Man

Comments: CJ Bolland stands with the Aphex Twin and very few others as the
only hardcore I can listen to anymore.  No sampled soundbites are used in his
music, for the most part, his instruments and rhythms aren't sampled as well.
Also, like Richard James his sound is largely dependent on analog technology.
With this, his first album, he presents some excellent tracks, but little
variety.  He shows a lot of innovation, but little range.  "Camargue" is a
slightly trancey break from an album that is all hardcore.

Summary: 8/10.  Good solid hardcore, but that is about all.  Why is this
packaged in a half CD case?


The Grid: Crystal Clear
Virgin: VSCDT 1442
1  128  03:42 Crystal Clear (Prankster Prophet Edit)
2  128  07:40 Crystal Clear (Prankster Prophet Mix)
3  128  07:46 Crystal Clear (Prankster Trance Dance)
4  123  04:38 Crystal Clear (Trimar Mix)
5  133  08:28 Crystal Clear (Clear, Like An Unmuddied Lake)
6  133  07:18 Crystal Clear (The Crystal Clear Water Revival)

Comments: This track has one of the most catchy, yet simple melodies I've
heard in a while.  It works well in endless repetition and with the bassline
travels from remix to remix in a good fashion.  The Orb finally shuts off the
faucet to give us some "Blue Room" like rhythm and typical odd samples, it
felt good to have a dancey Orb remix again.  My favorite is the "Trimar Mix",
with a casual Susan Vega like female vocal singing, "Boom shaka boom shaka" it
hooks you in a subtle way.  Too bad this particular mix is so relatively
short.

Summary: 9/10.  Solid original with a good variety in remixing.


Renegade Soundwave: Women Respond to Bass
Mute: CD MUTE 147
1  120  03:58 Women Respond to Bass (Pro-Sounds 7" Edit)
2  120  05:09 Women Respond to Bass (Women Respond to Terror Drums) 
3  120  05:58 Women Respond to Bass (Women Respond in Heaven)
4  122  07:14 RSW Megamix - Lesson 1 (Vocals by Pascale Feuille)

Comments: Although I found the original album version to have an amusing title,
it was one of the of the more lackluster tracks on "In Dub".  With this
single, RSW has revamped "Women Respond" and thrown a sexy female vocal on
top.  Along with plenty of french lyrics, the joke is apparent, but works
well.  Each remix isn't drastically different, but uses the new vocals in
different manners.  The "RSW Megamix" stands as one of the best megamixes I've
ever heard.  Usually these things are crap, but RSW manages to do a large
presentation of their past work in flowing seamless mix.

Summary: 7/10.  The mixes tend to be samey, but are a drastic improvement over
the original.  Worth it for the megamix alone.

Subject: Re: random notes/Universe

        Hmm.  Point well taken, Randy.  I probably should step back and think 
about what I recommend for a weekend before making those recommendations.  My
sole reason for "dissing" on TTTTT was that someone who had gone to Rhythm
Empire said TTTTT was being heavily flyered there, with the implication that
the two were being promoted by the same people or by people on the same 
wavelength.  In reality, it sounds like, TTTTT was sopmething I should have
recommended.  I never claim to be right - if I had to rate my accuracy in my
weekend recommendations I would say I was only right maybe 50% of the time.
And also people should realize I have a particular leaning towards the British
arm of the scene, the whole Wicked/Garth/Jeno/Gathering/Markie/Full Moon sorta
deal, while there's at least three other branches of the scene out there of
equal size.  We rarely hear about those other scenes, and I think that's 
tragic.  When compiling the calendar I rely 90% on what the consensus of 
the people here thought about an event... so if there's something you think
I'm ignoring or unfairly dissing LET ME AND THE LIST KNOW.  

	As for Mark, tell him I'm sorry and didn't mean him harm; I understand
Malachi knows him quite well, and Mark's playing a big role in the Malachy
benefit on the 20th... or something on that level.  

	So please, if I take a thwack at something you feel is unjust, take
a thwack back :):)  (I like the sound of that :)  Some people accuse me of
not being critical enough of raves out there, so I hope I strike a balance...
but whateva.

	As for the rallying call to get political;  I definitely agree.  I
am more disgusted with the police and with the money behind the scene than
I've ever been before.  I am really, REALLY intent on doing something soon
to make a _statement_; to, for example, hold a (permitted and fully legal)
rave on the steps of City Hall; or maybe get a group of 300 people together
and throw a rave in Charter Oak, and get ourselves arrested (everyone remembers
"Grave" in Minneapolis, right?  The cops arrested everyone, and it ended up
being a huge egg on their face).  Most of all, I'd like to work to EXPOSE this
cartel that appears to be forming, this racketeering.   The only problem I
foresee is I can't let sfraves turn political or we'd surely be kicked off
off the net, but we must do _SOMETHING_.  We can't pretend we live outside
of the law, and we're marginal enough not to matter.  I hate feeling like
an outlaw because I want to dance from 2:30am to 5am.  

	The situation is creating a nation of outsiders and criminals.  It's
time to take what's ours back.

	Brian

----------------------------Original message----------------------------
        SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- The city that once was awash in the free verse
of the coffee house and beatnik era has become embroiled in a
controversy over the rights to read poetry in public.
        San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan asked the police commission Monday
night to suspend the enforcement of the 20-year-old law that requires
the licensing of coffee houses where non-professional poetry readings
are held.
        Jordan said he would ask the Board of Supervisors to follow suit.
        ``It is an outrage that the City of San Francisco would in any way
attempt to regulate poetry by permit,'' he said. ``Free speech is as
important to San Franciscans as fog. For those of us who lived through
the Beat Generation we say the Beat must go on.''
        In the city's North Beach neighborhood, which gave birth to the
beatnik era of the 1950s and early 1960s, cafe owners voiced anger
Tuesday when asked about the law.
        ``We don't have any money, we survive on the sale of beer and coffee,
'' said Jessica Starr, owner of the North End Coffee House. ``It seems
unfair to make us pay $600 for the poetry license and then also pay $200
for a small business license.
        ``Besides I can't control my customers. If they stand up and recite a
poem, boom I have to pay $600. Spontaneous poetry reading is a San
Francisco tradition.''
        The law was put on the books in the 1960s as a way to control
assemblages in the city during the Hippie era.
        ``The perception might be that we are enforcing the ordinance more
heavily than in the past,'' said Officer Dave Ambrose, spokesman for the
San Francisco Police Department. ``That's just not the case. What we
have is cafe owners who have paid for the license complaining to us
about cafes that don't have licenses.
        ``When it is pointed out to us, we have to do something. We are in no
way trying to censor people from reading poetry or infringe on their
free speech rights. We are just doing our job -- enforcing the law.''
        At City Lights Bookstore, owned by Beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti
and publisher of the works of among others Allen Ginsberg and writer
Jack Kerouac, the law also drew fire.
        ``There should be no laws against poetry,'' said Joyce Jenkins,
editor and chief of City Lights Publishing. ``It's a silly issue. I
don't know what's behind it.''
        But Eric Smith, a student who frequents the North Beach cafes, said
the poetry license law may just be a sign of the fiscal times.
        ``If you come up with a way to raise money for the city, you should
do it,'' he said.
        Jordan, meanwhile, was not hiding where he stood on the issue. In
support of his demand to retract the law, the mayor offered a poem of
his own.
        ``We don't care one wit, for poetry by permit. Let the verse flow
free, from the beach to the sea.''

	Well what's good enough for poetry lovers should be good
	enough for ravers, that's what I say.  Maybe it's time we get a
	delegation together and go down and have a little talk with Frank.

I thought you told me in Berkeley last week you were not an activist? :)

This has been tried before at the state capital.  They basically told us
to stop at 11 pm and that was that.  It won't be any different at city
hall unless you want to get arrested and this is government property there's
no point.  You want to take a stand in a public place that is open to
everyone like the park.

or maybe get a group of 300 people together

Remember I said to prepare for this day, there are other places the list
could come from if need be.

Maybe the way to go but I think Milwaukee was not planned that way.  It just 
happened.  Charter Oak is not a good place to force the issue because there
are people who live and work around there who the cops could say, complained.
The cops will only take the promoters to jail anyway, unless people do
something like sit down infront of their crusiers or something like that,
to prevent them from taking the "ring leaders" away

BRIAN!, you, a revolutionary?
 
Well I agree it's time to do something but it must be an action that
is firm, with conviction but is NOT VIOLENT.  If we plan it, we need
to have people who are willing to get arrested and people who will
call lawyers and phone the papers and the media and bail people out
and spread the word, etc.


 P.S. Boy, some folks turn twenty and poof! they become bad asses :)

 Happy Birthday Brian! (maybe your testosterone level jumped)

If Frank didn't think that cafe owners and poets had any political
clout, he wouldn't have cared less.  The image of ravers as nonvoting
kids who just want to act crazy and dance, and of rave promoters who
don't pay taxes and don't generate revenue for local businesses, doesn't
exactly put us in any position to expect any kind of positive consideration
from the economical/political machine.  On the other hand, it is never
too soon to get some kind of dialog going.

No way.  I can't picture Jordan saying this.  It really tweeks my
reality to picture Jordan as a beatnik.

JORDAN: "Zowiee, Jack, like, that "On the Road" bit was GONE, daddio, GONE!"

KEROUAC: 'Say cat, can't say we've met.'

JORDAN: "Dig, man...Name's Frank, catch ya later."

Hi all!  Together last night was like a mini-Come/Unity - the DJs
were Simon, Jeno and Garth.  Together is in the basement of Big
Heart City every Tuesday night; last night was pretty crowded and
HOT, like a basement-of-1015 Wicked.   Fortunately they have
two rooms, the other room is more temperate, and features the
Synergy visual people.  What else can I say?  Call the number for
the weekly DJ lineup...

The Analogue Heaven Synth List was created to stimulate discussion between 
those interested in analogue (or analog, if you prefer) synthesizing keyboards,
homebuilt synthesizers, modular systems, as well as convertors within MIDI, 
SYNC (DIN), and Control Voltage (CV)/Gate platforms.

Also in frequent discussion are methods of conversion, swapping of diagrams and
schematics, and various methods of creating convertors, filters, modifications,
and the like.

And, you are welcome to ask questions, post items for sale, etc.. they don't
always HAVE to be analogue, since some of us do need MIDI hardware to sequence,
etc...

i titled yesterday's post /Universe, but forgot to write about it.

Someone on the net posted a Universe party for 35,000 in England in August.
that may be true, but the flyer i've seen, an 8 page color comic, sets the
Universe party @ April 20th.  (or so)  big tents, several dj stations,
35,000 max expected according to the promoter i talked to.  as of now,
Buck is only US dj on the bill.  

Come to think of it, the Universe promoter did mention (or was i dreamin?)
plans for a US universe later this summer.

Not an activist; just frustrated...

I was thinking along the lines of a Saturday afternoon thing. The point
wouldn't be to make a statement by wanting to dance at that spot all night - 
the point would be to make a public statement that raves aren't all about
getting blasted on tons of illicit substances and doing anti-social things.
The idea would be to show the world that dancing and house music and the
whole scene is, overall, a Good Thing.  I'm sure many of you have been to
raves in GG Park and seen the reaction the sound system and the dancers get
from casual park-goers (at least when they are held in the quad near the 
museums).  Some walk away going, "those crazy kids", but others watch in
amazement, many with smiles on their faces, and a few of those even join in
and dance.  If you ask anybody who watches it if this is ana activity which
merits an "anti-rave task force" on the SFPD, I bet the majority would say
no.  Holding it in a more public place like the space in front of City Hall
would hopefully send the same message to the People In Charge.

>It won't be any different at city
>hall unless you want to get arrested and this is government property there's

The park is great but it's not pressing the issue the same way City Hall would.
I wouldn't be doing _this_ to get arrested (unless this turns into something
similar to the Free Speech protests in Berkeley in the late 60's).  

>>or maybe get a group of 300 people together

Um... I don't think I'd want SFRaves to become political anyways.  It's a 
forum which I would like to remain as impartial as impossible.  If we want
to do something political, creating a separate list would be the route I
would suggest...

>something like sit down infront of their crusiers or something like that,
>to prevent them from taking the "ring leaders" away

Yeah, I think this was running through my head when I was confronting the
cops;  I didn't want to put everyone in the position of having to face the
cops, especially knowing that many people there had just dosed.  It's true,
Milwaukee was a case of something "just happening", and it would be hard to
get into a similar situation by trying.  
  
A p.s. to the Charter Oak situation - the afterparty for the busted Pure
was there, and supposedly there were 300 people there (more than were at
C2).  GRRRRRRRRR....

>Well I agree it's time to do something but it must be an action that

>and spread the word, etc.

Agreed.  And people ARMED with information, i.e. flyers, petitions, maybe
even posts to sfraves which could help spread our message.  Ideally the
people who come to the City Hall dance would come knowing that their first
purpose is to spread a vibe, to ed-u-cate the narramines, to act as activists,
and to enjoy themselves by dancing second.

>P.S. Boy, some folks turn twenty and poof! they become bad asses :)

Hee!  

>Happy Birthday Brian! 

Thanks!  I want to thank everyone for all the birthday wishes, both private
and public.  These two weeks since C2 have been quite difficult both at work
and with school, so for the past day and a half I've been flying high because
of your letters.  I haven't been this happy since the Bonny Doon Connection.
Someone even wrote me a poem!!!  ;);)

(Hmmm. My mail program seems to be eating my messages now. Perhaps it has
something to do with the coffee I spilled on my pwrbk a month ago.) If
you've seen this before, please disregard.

and me without my bike:-(
is anyone else going to the 50th anniversary of Albert Hofmann's bike
ride? I just took the plunge and bought tix to both Friday and Saturday!
If anyone is headed that way, I'd be grateful for a ride. I live just
off HWY17 on the way to Santa Cruz for Friday nt.

If anyone needs info on this most blessed event, just give me a buzz.
It's April 16-17-18 in SC and SF, a few noted speakers are:
Robert Anton Wilson, Paul Krassner, Tim Leary, Laura Huxley, Bruce
Eisner, Mountain Girl(!) Ken Goffman, Terence McKenna and others.

They also feature a free event in GG Park on April 18 with T. McKenna
speaking at 5:15pm and a "Multi-Media Dance" later at 1015 Folsom. Also,
there will be a free bike-ride parade in SC Sat. morning. I know someone
has already posted some info on this, but it can't hurt to say it again.

See you there...

Excerpted from Science News, 3/13/93, without permission.

New Hope for People with Hearing Loss

Scientists have long held that people who've lost specialized "hair cells"
in the inner ear cannot make up for their loss and must suffer permanent
hearing impairment or balance disorders.  Neurobiologists may have to
rethink that dogma.  Dramatic new findings suggest that mammals, including
humans, have the ability to repair inner-ear damage.

...Scientists may one day use this information to design drugs that would
spur the inner ear to fix itself after an injury...
The researchers grew animal and human ear tissue in culture dishes and then
doused the cells in each with a drug that selectively kills hair cells...
After the first week, the team found evidence of proliferating cells in both
cultures.  Forge [researcher] believes that the nonhair cells in the tissue
sample began dividing after the drug destroyed nearby hair cells.  
Eventually, these new cells take on the characteristics of hair cells, he 
says...

Researchers must find the signal that tells ear cells to begin dividing in 
order to repair an injury...If researchers find such a signal, they might be 
able to design a drug that spurs ear cells to divide in a controlled 
fashion.  Such a drug might provide people with a cure for hearing loss.

ORB NORTH AMERICAN TOUR ENDS

The big news of course is the end of the super secret Orb Mission '93 tour of
America.  Yes folks, they did tour, but only playing to crowds of ten or less.
I did get to witness this concert at one stop, but I had to drive to Boise,
Idaho then pay off the promoter with $500.  Considering that it would have
cost $5000 on their original tour to bring them to Salt Lake, I figured this
was a bargain.  Another source of disappointment was the fact that none of
"Adventures" nor "UFOrb" was played for the small audience.  Alex, Thrash, and
the road crew played the Stooges "No Fun" at least five times (I lost count)
then had a large chess tourney for the rest of the night.  I rewound my
recorder after the third version of "No Fun", but managed to capture all of
the chess tourney, which unfortunately was mostly silent.  You can however,
hear Steve Hillage cursing under his breath during a tight match with Thrash.


APHEX TWIN NORTH AMERICAN TOUR BEGINS

The Aphex Twin has started a jagged circuit of several cities.  What is unique
about his tour is that he is flying back home to England between each stop.
Richard James, upon being questioned about the unusual and time consuming tour
stated that he's almost got the electronics of the DC-10 charted and had run
out of his own money to do so.


WHITE ROOM MOVIE PREMIER

The long awaited KLF "White Room" film will premier at the Great Neck South
Independent Film Festival.  Jimmy Cauty has given word that he will be there,
but so far nobody has heard from Bill Drummond.  In fact, Bill's answering
machine now answers for a Mr. Hagbard Celine.  Even stranger, the sound of a
porpoise can be heard in the background.  The film's director, Bill Butt has
been unavailable for comment, but a press release regarding the film itself
has been sent out to a select few.  Running at 46:23 minutes in length the
film manages to capture most of the inspiration for the album "The White Room"
as well as all of its remixes.  It also answers the burning question about the
true fate of the KLF.


303 TERRORISTS TAKE USA BY STORM

Yes, your favorite group and mine, the 303 Terrorists, the band that everyone
and their dog is talking about is releasing their much anticipated album in a
record release party in Giants Stadium tonight.  Following their appearance on
last week's Saturday Night Live, their label "Mucho Guano" was stormed by the
general public demanding that an album be placed in their hands.  303
Terrorist spokesman, Jach Mehoff had to call in a SWAP team to keep the
anxious crowd of four to ninety year olds away.  So far, no album title has
been announced for fear of more riots regarding an early release.  In related
news, Sting mentioned on "Later With Bob Costas" that he would gladly give up
his opening spot on the Grateful Dead tour to the 303 Terrorists, stating that,
"My musical ability is nothing to a 303 in the hands of these masters."


JACK DANGERS TO REMIX EVERYTHING

In a short interview following his Divine Playground performance, Jack Dangers
of Meat Beat Manifesto mentioned that he has begin the ultimate task of
remixing everything.  When questioned whether this meant he was dipping into
classical and country realms Jack laughed that he didn't mean music, but
*everything* else.  So far he has remixed a small cafe in the south of London
for a test, as well as his Scottish terrier.  According to description, the
bark of the terrier is now far worse than its bite, but also manages a fairly
funky backing track of 122 bpms.


LINDA RONSTADT RAVES

Linda has tried her hand at just about every other form, but in the past few
years has stayed away from pop culture.  However, today marks the release of
her first 12" dance single with "Need A Little Ravin'".  Produced by Prodigy
front man Liam Howlett and Moby during their California stop, the single
sports several remixes and a killer acid throb.  Will Linda tour the
underground?  The big question is whether she can operate a DAT machine or
not.


MOBY TO PRODUCE GOSPEL ALBUM

In related news, Linda Ronstadt is to produce Moby for his next album which
will be entirely made up of Moby singing gospel favorites.  The sneak preview
demo tape is devoid of synthesizers, samples, and high speed bpms.  Word on
the street is that Moby has thrown out all of his equipment in favor of a
Wurlitzer organ.  Not surprisingly, many young talents are now abandoning
their analog Roland equipment for Wurlitzers.


ULTRAVIOLET CATASTROPHE COLLABORATES WITH TRANCE

Net favorites UVC have announced that they will be doing a continuing
collaboration with net favorite Trance.  In an exciting agreement between
Twitch and Charnel House, the two San Francisco labels will share ideas, remix
each other, and have a general good ol' time.  Charnel House magnate Mason
Jones stated, "I've always wondered how to do a decent 4/4."  Jon Drukman
followed up with, "I really think I'll be able to get that good Foetus feeling
if I can get Mason to teach me how to play guitar."  Twitch label founder Mike
Wertheim indicated that this would finally be the much anticipated fusion
between Japanese noize bands and tribal techno.

this idea is really starting to shape up. Perhaps a benefit of some sort

Ozean (Deutsch:  ocean, sea) is a dreamy, ethereal, ambient band from
the sf-bay area (san jose) that gathers its influences from such bands
as slowdive, cocteau twins, xmal deutschland, my bloody valentine, as
well as such musical styles as trance, and ambient house.

we are mark baldwin:  bass/guitar/drums/programming
       mike prosenko: guitars/effects/ether

i can't continue to play guitar/bass for much longer, as our live show
requires that i play drums.  right now we are compiling a demo tape
simply because we can't play live without more members.  

we are a live guitar band FIRST!  but we NEED dedicated guitar players
who are into the same style of music, preferably with the same influences,
though by no means necessarily.

we also desire a female vocalist.  she should be dreamy and intoxicating,
but capable of intensity.  being able to play bass/guitar is a big plus.

please contact me @ one of the forums listed below.  email @ganymede or
home phone preferred.

thanx for you time.

Subject: UNiverse

 I heard that the more detailed report can be found in the alt.raves group.
From what *I* understand, there will be a whole series of UNiverse raves
held in the UK this spring and summer culminating with the big super rave.
Ticket prices are reported to be in the neighborhood of 18-20 pounds. That's
why I am putting this info on the net, so we can pool our "rumors" and start
promoting this thing, HEAVILY.

			Arnt these Raves the ones that we are suppose to be avoiding,  Bigger is not
always better, especially when RAVES are concerned.  

On the Same note, Vision is starting to sound like a mega Rave.  The last one
was really killer,  New Years OK but big.

Today as my April Fools prank, I created three new newsgroups which
(IMHO) were sorely needed.  Please post to them all profusely when
they are available at your site.

1.  alt.config.control-freaks

This is a group for discussion of why certain individuals wish to
place their own, personal limitations on the alt.* heirarchy.

2.  alt.cabal

This group has been proposed by many people who fall into category (1)
above.  They wanted a moderated group to discuss limiting the alt.*
heirarchy to their own little preferences.  I felt that the best
tactical move in this case was to beat them to the punch by creating
an UN-moderated group. :-) :-)

3.  alt.shut.the.hell.up.geek

This group is dedicated to the immortal Matthew Neill Sharp of
rec.music.industrial.  Or it can be used against group (1) above.

It's not a matter of promoting a rave just because it has a large projected
turnout, rather it's about promoting a multinational, multicultural marathon
of unending fun! Hell, I've always adopted the "the more the merrier
attitude" anyway. Granted, there will undoubtedly be a plethora of
non-ravers, but that is one of the pitfalls of any "large" event.

Hi everyone. I'm one of those lurkers who's just been enjoying the mail.

Subject: SUNSTRUCK FLASH: SUNTANK ANNOUNCES SuperSHARK CARRERA CLASSIC

-+This message has been approved for distribution to this alias+-
	

		SUNTANK ANNOUNCES NEW OFFICE WORKSTATIONS

		SuperSHARK CARRERA CLASSIC UNVEILED TODAY

SunTank, a division of SunStruck, Inc., today announced the availability 
of a high performance portable computing system designed for the small 
office environment -- the SuperSHARK Carrera Classic. The new system, based 
on the Convertible Office Submersible Environment (COSE) specification, 
was unveiled this morning in the Mountain View office of company founder, 
Andreas Fish Bechtolshiem.

"This technology is an enhanced version of our SHARKstation product 
line. It shows our total commitment to 32-bite commuting and powerful 
hardware," said Bechtolshiem. "And it's my favorite color, too."

The heart, or rather guts, of the system lie in its 120-Megabuck
SuperSHARK processor chip. Despite being a much smaller version of the 
7-gill processor in the original SHARKstation 1 machine, the new 
SuperSHARK is ferocious enough to destroy its closest competitors in 
seconds.  Today the SuperSHARK was demonstrated performing at an 
astounding 100-tetrabites per second.

The true beauty of the new SuperSHARK system is in its European-engineered 
Carrera packaging. The sleek, aerodynamic chassis is built for high 
maneuverability and has a convenient user interface. "We are delighted that 
the SuperSHARK chip can deliver so much power to our stylish exterior," 
commented Hans EinFranz, project manager for Pisce, the German 
hardbody manufacturer that co-designed the Carrera Classic with 
Bechtolshiem. With a full 200 gallon tank capacity, front and rear 
wheel stabilizers, and roomy plexiglass interior, the SuperSHARK 
Carrera Classic office workstation is truly a user's dream of high 
functionality at a low price. (Suggested retail: $7995, tax, license, 
and dealer-installed Cabriolet top extra. Non-discountable.)

No hardware system is complete without a robust operating 
environment.  The SuperSHARK-powered Carrera system runs Windows ET 
from SunSlosh, a sister company of SunTank. "The WET environment 
puts a whole new motif on transparent, distributed hydrokinetic computing," 
said Ned Zander, president and chief perch at SunSlosh. "Of course, 
no one really knows what that means, but it sounds good. 
Let's just say - the system goes fast, and it's powerful."

At the bottom of the SuperSHARK system is SunLinks, a set of 
ground-level user tools for increased office productivity. The compact 
SunLinks course adds even more stability and entertainment value 
to the Carrera office system.

Initial market reaction for the SuperSHARK and the related technologies 
has been remarkably favorable. "I saw a beta version, and I had to 
have one in my office immediately," commented Lotty Varey, 
Bechtolshiem's neighbor.

SunStruck executive Sturgeon McReely noted, "It's the ultimate 
driving machine. Oh no, that's the other German guys. Anyway, 
it's what I've been trying to develop all along - a computer
that's as easy to use as driving a car."

"This is the pinnacle of the series that I foresaw years ago," 
commented Wilhelm Glad, former user of an on-pond system.

Depending on further market acceptance, the SunTank team may introduce 
an AstroSHARK server version later this summer.
