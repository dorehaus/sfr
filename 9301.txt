Subject: MUD


	Well I guess all us sfravers are still decompressing from last night's
activities (or are still attending after-after-after parties :) so I'll write
my review of last Night's Gathering up in Vallejo.

	I had driven up from LA yesterday afternoon, about ~370 miles of arrow-
straight highway (the only fun I had was playing mindgames with the CHP twice)
which can do strange things to my psyche for hours afterward.  Anyways, combine
that with having gotten little sleep the night before and more driving after
arriving up here, and you can see I was going to be less than hyper that night.
I had also pretty much decided not to hElp myself along at all either - for 
some reason it became important to me to rave my first rave of 1993 sober...

	Anyways our merry band of troopers arrive there at 10:30 to find 
a) lotsa rain, which created b) lotsa mud in the dirt parking lot, the two of 
which made waiting in c) a huge line miserable.  I hadn't seen a line so big 
since I drove around the outside of Caspar, and had never seen one at a Basics.
At first we got to the end like everyone else - four people ahead of us was 
Gregg, and then four ahead of that Bob Carasik, and I started to actually feel 
really good about being there (despite the drizzle.)

	I decided to scope out the line - their organization clearly did not
anticipate there being such a huge line, because they had no way of keeping 
people from simply walking to the front and standing there as if they belonged
there.  The canned-food collection method made this even more twisted.  It
became obvious to me that so many people were saying fuckit to the line and
walking ahead and cutting, that the rate of people cutting at the front 
exceeded the rate of people who flowed through the gate (which was very slow), 
that by standing still we were actually _falling_behind_.  You can figure what
we did next.

	So anyways, we got inside around 11:30, and the main warehouse was 
PACKED.  I had NEVER seen a Basics to packed, and this is still early in
the night.  I was worried they would try and overpack it (I think they came
just shy of doing that - there was another warehouse, and at one point in
the night they were refusing readmission to the first because it was so 
crowded).  The chill-out space outside was marred by the constant rain - it
wasn't so much the rain but the constant mud everywhere. The second warehouse 
had a huge chill space, which was very well laid out and would have been 
absolutely perfect if the ambient DJ didn't blast his music in an attempt
to compete with the other dance floor in the same warehouse.  

	So anyways, the stroke of midnight comes - from my last two New
Year's events at raves I fully expected the music to stop or at least lower
and Martin to come out over the microphone screaming down the last 10 seconds,
and then everyone cheering and peaking.  Didn't happen - about a minute before
my watch said go the cheering increased, reached a high with people jumping
everywhere, and then subsided.  Martin missed a brilliant chance to send the
energy over the top... 

	Still in my mellow state, I decided the main warehouse was too much
for me (too hot, too loud and too much sexual tension) so I went to the second
warehouse, the "groove room" where they stuck the no-name DJ's.  What the
f***?  The music here was great!  For most of the time it was there it was
this absolutely blissful acid-house, and the crowd there was full on into it.
The only visuals in this huge space was a Sharpvision being projected from one 
wall to another - but the rest of the dancefloor was way too dark.  So I saw
this as a dance-yourself-to-death rave rather than a meet-ten-thousand-people
rave... and once I got into that mindset things started to flow NICELY.  I 
stayed there for awhile, alternating between dancing like a fool and standing
outside in the rain to cool off and find friends.

	As for the "vibe" - there was definitely some of it there (both
on the dance floor and when I talked to strangers outside) but it didn't
seem as concentrated as it could have been... so in ths case it was quantity
over quality (though the later is a very subjective evaluation).  I saw TONS
of sfravers thoughout the night (Hi Rob! Hi Mike/Zak/Mark/Ute! Hello to 
everyone else, all ten gajillion of you :) which made it a very positive 
experience for me, and there were probably a half-dozen to a dozen strangers
who were very friendly with me too.  But nothing "magical" happened that night,
nothing that would set apart that night as being the best rave of the year or
anything... no dancing cups with ice water, etc.

	Oh, and the music?  Markie Mark played a great set right before 
midnight, much more techno than he usually does.  Then right after midnight
Spun came on and started with his heavy hip-hop set,  most of which I'm not
crazy about but it got the crowd going for awhile... I spent from about 1 till
about 3 in the second warehouse - whoever was there was playing a killer
selectin (even if his beat-matching could be improved).  I returned to the
main place to find Jeno kicking out an AWESOME set - probably the best I'd
ever heard him do.  I wanted to stand by the turntables and dance all night
long.  But because of the layout of the room and the sheer volume of the far-
wall speakers, the DJ monitor ended up being about half a beat ahead of the
sound from the far wall, which gave the acoustics near the table that
"basketball-court" effect.  The only places with truely good acoustics was
either RIGHT in front of the speakers (way too loud for me) or right smack
dab in the middle.  So there I danced for a long while, people flowing by
and smiling...  I got a second wind, and Garth came on and proceeded to 
start yet another God-like set, which REALLY got me going (especially when
he started playing a few records I HAD'T HEARD BEFORE (imagine that).  But
by that time most of the other people I came with wanted to leave (I was on
such an energy high, I did NOT want to leave) so I obliged them.  We left
around quarter to six and didn't make any of the afterparties (one at the Stone
right?  How was it?).  The second time in a row leaving during Garth's set - 
aaaaaaarg!

	Overall, it was fun, and better than any other rave with that many 
people should have been, but not necessarily LEGENDARY.  Well worth the $20
(cheapest NYE rave I've ever been to) but could have been organized better.
And the rain definitely dampened spirits (I dunno HOW they could have managed
it in England), but one of the best parts of the night was sloshing my 4WD
around in the super super muddy parking lot while leaving :)

	So anyways, I got me raving quota for the weekend... I think I'll
take a nap, rent a movie, decompress, etc.... bye!

	Brian



p.s. - people, please - if you are going to go to a rave with a group of
people, and everyone plans on dosing, please have at least one person present
who will NOT be dosing (but who has in the past).  Even though it's possible
to drive after an E trip, please realize you're taking everyone else's life
into your hands.  I saw more than a couple instances last night of this...
not to bag on anyone, but it's just not safe.  Whateva.  Doowhatchalike.

Subject: A Gathering of Mud ( Happy New Year)



	I'm still recovering from the Gathering,  I was on the verge of
some lingering illness (raver's disease) the week before, I fought it
for three days  with alpha cf (a homeopathic formula) which
helped by not allowing it to get worse, but I didn't get any better.
December 31 comes and while driving to the Gathering, I bail on the
Homeopathics and down 3 sudafed (something I never do, but hey, I
didn't want to have my nose running all over everybody) given to me by
my straight-ahead hacker friend who is about to experience his first
rave.  We got there at 9:30 followed by a stedy stream of cars, my
first indication that this would be big, (lots of people showing up
early) as we got out, I saw lots of high schoolers, (hmm,well ok) and
many of them were busy trying to down as much booze as they could as
fast as they could (uh oh), At one point in the line there was a small
group of young ravers who were really ragging on the  alcohol
drinkers to there faces!  Saying stuff like "Oh my god! Look at you!
What are you doing! Look at your face! Your all red! That's
disgusting!" and so on, the kids drinking the alcohol looked perplexed,
like they wanted to "get it right" and weren't.  I was worried that a
fight might ensue but it seemed that these young ravers maybe knew the
brew crew bunch or something cuz the drinkers just didn't say anything.
Anyway the line was long, with little crowd control, I started to worry
as I saw the parking lot fill up and a steady flow of people cutting in
line.  I thought about Casper on Halloween but thought that Martin
would be better prepared than Halieem, he wasn't.  After about a half
an hour, I made the call that I wasn't going to get even sicker
standing out in the rain and eventhough I don't approve of line
cutting, I was going to do it.  I told my friend come on (he chose to
stay in line) and I went to the front and got in. (I paid for my
missdeed by not getting a coupon for my food and had to pay $25 instead
of $20.  Once in, I saw Mykl G handing out "maps" of the layout. I did my
standard "once around" of the space to map the topology into my brain
and proceded to the ameba chill out area to drop my stuff and basically
help out.  Martin had placed Mark in the second room and Mark didn't
like not being where the energy was so we moved him into the main room
and set up there.  By this time, I wAs bEcomming very friendly so I
went to dance, I eventually ran into Brian and my friend that I "left"
in line, who was upset about it (understandably) after working it out
with him, I spaced around some more but I can't remember much until
Jeno came on.  He played the best set that I've ever heard from him
(which is saying alot!) I was down front next to the turntables
watching the interaction between Jeno and his "fans".  Jeno with his
tough-london-iceman-b-boy-tude, spinning relentlessly, apparently
oblivious to his surroundings, like he is doing it for his own enjoyment
(except this is the illusion, I've never seen a DJ rave,hip=hop or
otherwise read and stroke a crowd like Jeno), the joung raver boys,
wearing their base ball caps like Jeno, aspiring to his greatness,
complete with their own copycat version of his attitude, hanging on his
every move, observing every tweek of his hand.  One of them came
equipped with a head mount light so that he could read the titles of
the 12" (ahh but grasshopper, Jeno covers his titles, with tape so you
can't read them, try again :). To the right a squad of adolescent girls
are dancing and squeeling and writting their numbers on pices of paper
and trying to get Jeno to take them, Jeno ignores them and continues to
play a stellar set.  I must admit, It was awsome to stand and watch this
story unfold before my eyes.  By this time I started to realize how big
the "smaller" New Years Rave actually was, my guess is 7000 people at
the maximum point, A little scary as the place was too crowded for me
to feel totally safe although the energy was good! No one shoving or
pushing, thank goddess there was no alcohol.  Even though this was a
nice New Year's party, the Vibe wasn't as strong as I had expected it
to be, I think the weather had a lot to do with it, but something tells
me that 1993 will be a year of even larger raves, I like the small
community raves and they will still happen, but raves and raving is much bigger
than all of us and we have to realize that they will get larger and
more intense and we just have to hope for the best and throw our
know-how and support behind the promoters that are the most aware and
conscious. Martin should have known that he was going to have a lot of
people, I think he had more that he anticipated, his crowd control was
woefully inadequate, if there had been an emergency, it would have been
a disaster.  But nothing bad happened, that I know of.  So my hat goes
off to him.  I think I'll spend the rest of the weekend resting and
save up for the FMR and FOUNDATION (which is on my birthday!!).

Subject: More Gathering Blathering

We arrived about 2 as part of a steady stream of cars that were being
told that the party was full and no one was being allowed in.  We cut
through the Holiday Inn parking lot and hiked through the mud up to a
gatehouse were there were about 100 wet but mellow ravers waiting to get
in.  I saw Neils and Brad there.  We were told that there were 8,500 
people inside and they didn't know when anyone else would be let in,
including those who already had bracelets.

After about an hour of rain and an asshole security guard who became 
obsessed with single file lines, we gave up hope of getting in even though
the group had dwindled to about 50 and we had witnessed many more than
that leave the party.  We left and spent the rest of the evening getting
turned away from 3 Dennys, a Zims and a closed 24-hour Safeway.

The DNA thing was fun although it didn't really get going for me
until Simon's set at the end.  I really didn't get too bummed out about
missing the Gathering since I usually don't have that good a time at huge
overcrowded events.  I don't think I'll waste my time trying next year.

Subject: the gathering, from the pov of a non-raver

Having never raved before, I arrived at the fairgrounds in Vallejo
(north of San Francisco) at 9:45 for the Gathering, hoping to avoid the
midnight rush, it being New Years Eve.  The line wasn't long, maybe 100
or 200 yards, though there was a crowd around the apparent entrance.
There was a lengthening line of cars coming into the huge fairgrounds
parking lot, it was fortunate that we got there earlier.  Well, the
line didn't move much at all, which was strange - many more people
seemed to be driving in than seemed to be getting on line.  With the
weather somewhere between drizzle and rain, this was somewhat
disheartening, but being an honest sort, I held my place in line, as
did many, although I regret not most, others.

After two hours on line, I was finally sold a ticket to the rave.  (I
might have left first, but due to plans I had made with a friend, I was
committed to staying.)  The main backup seemed to be that there were
two people frisking the entrants (at an even that drew 7000 people) -
not only was this ridiculously slow, but it was quite ineffective,
since the overworked friskers didn't do an adequate job - they looked
at my bag, I said it was food, they said it felt like food and they
waved me through.  My friend, who is more ominous looking than I am,
said he wasn`t really frisked at all.  After the friskers, there were
four ticket windows.  By my estimation, it should have taken, at most,
15 minutes for me to get in with orderly ticket management, which also
means, I suppose that seven people out of eight cut the lines (which is
otherwise rough for me to estimate, considering the nature of swarms of
people).  After hearing about the spirituality and integrity of raving,
this was somewhat disconcerting, but I hoped to write it off to
oversight on the part of an organizer who was not prepared for such a
crowd.

I entered the first large hall (there were two) and it was well packed
with people dancing to a monotonous repetitive techno beat.  There were
black lights and lasers and people dressed in various ways, with Dr.
Seuss being a prominent fashion theme.  The crowd seemed to be mostly
high school and college students, what I would expect from a rock
concert.  The mixture seemed to reflect San Francisco - gays, asians,
blacks, latinos, and colorless flavorless people as well.  Folks seemed
largely quite tolerant, of the weather, the wait, the conditions, and
of each other.  No alcohol was served - I assume this had a positive
effect - I saw not one fight the whole night.  There was quite a bit of
smoking - tobacco especially, pot and clove cigarettes too.  Apparently
many ravers take drugs to keep them awake or to otherwise enhance their
experience, I saw some evidence of this, but it isn't as easy to spot
as someone with a butt in hand.

To me, a novice observer, it looked like a school dance, well, a
loosely chaperoned school dance.  Many dancers (not most) removed their
shirts, women wore only bras, men danced bare chested.  Many couples
locked in embrace or lied down on the floor and some either screwed or
looked like it.

The music was *very* loud, and many dancers ("speaker tweakers") would
stand right in front of the speakers and dance, some leaning their
bodies right on the grilles or their heads into the driver cones.
Without ear protection I doubt that these people could survive very
many minutes without damaging their hearing.  The music was so loud
that it shook your guts inside you.  I am told that the sound systems
weren`t working too well, which seemed true, but I don't have any
context to compare it with, as I wasn't expecting symphony sound in
these conditions.

The floors became littered with food trash, especially plastic bottles,
and the floors were quickly grimy and moist from people tracking in
rain and mud, and eventually part (the 10% by the entrance) of the main
floor was covered with an inch or two of rain water, and much more was
wet.

There were two dance halls, the main one, which you entered first, and
a second one, which was nearby but not well publicized.  The second
hall was set up ok though somewhat more subdued.  Only the first hall
had lasers - there was definitely a sense of primary and secondary.
Not surprisingly, the first hall was packed, and people who ventured
momentarily into the second hall were not allowed to re-enter the first
hall for at least two hours.  I have no idea what they did about the
people who, no doubt, were still waiting outside in the ticket lines.
There were uniformed guards (off-duty policemen) making sure people
didn't enter the packed main hall, and I saw one cop lose his temper,
yelling at the crowd in an attempt to intimidate them.  It worked, but
generally, the cops were pretty relaxed, as were the ravers.  The cops
certainly weren't out patrolling the ticket lines, where they might
have proven useful.

The chill area was outdoors between the two halls, and being a cold
rainy night, it provided no comfort and as such was fairly useless to
most people who needed a rest (maybe I didn't realize what they meant
by "chill.")  You were stuck trying to grab a piece of wall for
comfort, and the walls were moist, chilly, and crowded, not to mention
the fact that they were in the noisy dance halls.

In this environment, people raved the night away until 8 AM, different
groups with different motives, some just to party, some to transcend
into a spiritual space, some to make out with their mates, to dance, to
cruise, to watch, to blow out their eardrums.

There was a definite sense of community among the many ravers, and of
the thousands, there was a good number who treated me, a stranger,
with friendship - sharing their snacks, making attempts at conversation
(in the unwavering din), sharing smiles and engaging in other such kind
and gentle acts.  This was certainly more than I would expect of a
typical dance crowd.

Having heard about the spiritual aspect of raving, I thought that I was
exploited by the rave organizers who didn't plan the entry lines in a
reasonable way.  Cutting the line was an alternative that doesn't jibe
with my personal integrity (which I don't consider all that gigantic).
I pay twenty bucks to get into an event and I expect the organizers to
provide minimal human comforts, like not having to wait two hours in
the rain.  They can do it at the ballpark, they should be able to do it
at a rave.  Similarly, I was not impressed with the planning for rest
areas, cleanliness and so forth.  I was locked out of the main hall
between about 1 and 3 AM - had they made the two halls equally
attractive, this wouldn't have been a problem.

I won't dwell much about what actually went on, they played loud techno
all night and people danced and milled around.  No surprises there.

Apparently, the spiritual ravers rave to work themselves into a froth,
transcending their physical surroundings, so many of these points might
not be of much consequence, with little need for creature comfort once
they start.  Turn off the lights, turn up the beat, and they're in
business.  But most of the folks who I saw seemed to be there to party,
and as such, the environment sufficed, but it wasn't particularly
well-suited.  People seemed to enjoy it quite a bit, but if I were king
of the forest, I'd choose conditions a bit more humane.  Did I have a
good time?  Shrug.  If just wanted a good time, I would have picked
more familiar surroundings.

Yeah, but the people I was with wanted to go home -- and they were
waiting in the car due to cold/rain/slinky-clothing. The fact that the
line hadn't moved in an hour, combined with the arrival of many police
orificers, my wetness, condescending-asshole tone of voice from
security folk, the fact that I hadn't EnAbled myself in any way
(self-designated driver) made it especially easy for me to give up and
drive home. Got my car completely sideways in the parking lot,
hydroplaned a few times on the freeway, saw the aftermath of a nasty
multicar pileup on 101...  some blood, no dead bodies, niels-bob says
don't check it out.

Well, at least my friend's NYE party was fun... Too bad I left early to
go to the gathering.... 

Oh, "the vibe" in line was pretty fun/friendly, I thought. Met Mark
Winston@lurnix, jealously listened to Phoebe's skiing exploits, etc.

But, in the future, I will remember not to rave on major holiday
events. 

See y'all at the Groove Kitchen tonight?

Subject: Gathering again


Let's see if I can get soda to take this this time: 


This was held in two buildings up in Vallejo, seperated by
several minutes of rain drenched walk.  Many people didn't
understand there was a second building.  Many people were
somewhat bummed to discover that upon leaving the first
building, the security goons would not let you back in.  The
first building was over crowded it seems, which is not
surprising because all of the big name DJs and most of the
lighting effort went into that space... I listened to one
fellow rant about this out in the rain: why didn't they
split the big DJs between the spaces?  When I finally did
make it into the main space again around two I was amused to
discover that it was actually better in the "second rate"
building.  In the main building, there seemed to be ten people
milling around for every two people dancing: it was like
dancing in a hallway.  And there was no chill space, so
people just flopped down in the middle of the floor.  In the
Other Space though, there was more of a traditional split
between dance and chill, and a nice gradient of energies.
It was like a really cool, cheap rave.  Later on, things
got better in the main space, though.

Two Raves for the price of one and a half.  Can't complain
too much.  

Once again, I wound up lugging my leather jacket around with
me through out the night, but for once it didn't seem quite
so stupid.  Walking in the rain was no big deal for me, and
it also came in handy to crash out on inside a tent in the
chill space (tents on concrete without ensolite pads! how
intimate), not to mention it's usual function as
purse/backpack.

At one point it dawned on me that a partial solution to the
overheating problem would be to take off my shirt.  Almost
immediately after I got rid of it, a woman hugged me at
random, and then said "We are all one."  


Here's a minor stupidity I'd like to bitch about: Okay you
can buy some bad coffee for 50 cents in the main building,
that's cool.  But with no lid?!  You can't drink it there,
you've got to get out of the way.  The main building isn't a
great place to drink it, it's jammed with millers and
dancers and not exactly a cool place to chill with some
coffee and chocolate.  So I wanted to get to the chill space
in the second building... I carefully edge my way through
the crowd without a spill, and make it to the exit.
A security twit, god know why, is not letting anyone *leave*
the building, perhaps because he's so intently focused on
preventing people from entering.  As I try and talk to him
about this, the mob at the door surged forward, pushed him
out of the way and I spilled half of my coffee on someone
(about thirty people came in, about twenty people walked
out: problem solved.  Isn't anarchy wonderful?).  I then
trudged through the rain and made it to the chill area with
very little rather cold coffee remaining.  

So that's it in minature, that's the kind of stuff that was
wrong with this rave.  The planning seemed at least mildly
screwed up in more ways than were worth counting.

On the other hand, a lot of the people there were really
cool.  And thousands of people celebrating New Year's
without alcohol... that's an achievement.

P.S.  Arrived at elevenish.  If I were anywhere but at a
rave I would've cut the line.  I hassled a few line-cutters
with my guilt phasers.  We got in after midnight, but who
cares really.  

The non-ravers I was with seemed to have a good time, though
they split too early (around two or so), giving their
bracelets to people who had been waiting in the rain.  Later
I noticed security fanatics testing bracelets by _pulling_
on them.  

Hanging in a bathroom (getting a nice dose of bright white
florescent lights for a change) I eavesdropped on some cops
talking about a bust they had made for something or other. 
One of them was saying if he didn't get his cuffs back he'd
be really pissed.  

Ran into many excellent sfravers of course, though I
apparently missed many others.  During Jeno's set, I
discovered the Geoff had found the perfect place to hang,
right in front of the speakers that the laser was aimed at.
Drove back to SF with Ccat, and checked out the AfterYear
party or whatever at the DNA.  Just did a quick in and out,
but we met up with some folks like Will Penna who had done
the SuperNOva thing.

:K/4K4]te fnest musical events ever: what it is is hip-hop,
dance-hall, and mostly rare groove and acid jazz. but they have a
live band taking solos over everything and sometimes doing sets:
awesome flute and vibe work with the DJ hanging in for some efx. the
crowd was easily the most diverse i/ve ever hung with, including
raves - and although no one was on about peace and love, everyone
was hanging together, they even had a rapper from japan who rapped
in japanese. unreal. unreal. unrrrrrreal. (to make up for the r/s i
missed)

i tried to hunt down smashUs other event: save the robots. but it
was next to impossible, oh well

then i did the new years rave thing in the basement of the
guggenheim soho galleries. and since the flyer said unbustable
location, of course we got busted. most people think it was a scam.
i agree cause the security lookked pretty out of place - old guys in
badly ftting suits. but there were these people trapped in an
elevator that gives the fire marshall thing some legitimacy.
so 2000 space aliens stopped traffc on the bowery while they waited
for some location b - the rumor i heard was they were trying to
bribe the fire marshall, and then send us back to the guggemheim.
frankly it was the most drugged out crowd i/ve seen. and i thought
it would have been safer to let us raave it off, but no one said
anything about schmardtz...

so we just danced around the street corner for a couple of hours.

the really cool part was that i finally got my friends hooked - we
were having trouble relating cause none of us had seen each other in
about a year and therave worked wonders, and we then went home to my
friends and watched a gorgeous sunrise to miles davis/ aura, eating
breakfast on his roof overlooking the {scenic} east river. one of
the nicest evenings i/ve ever spent... so i really don/t care if i
was scammed. if the crowd sucked, it would have been different. not
to say i didnUt have some problems with the crowd, cause y/know i
like to bitch. but i/m saving all my phuny stories for the january
zine.

if you/re interested in the sounds of dj smash, i/ll probably be on
the air sunday the 3rd 9pm-1pm 90.1fm kzsu. i/ll be giving away deep
space tickets to. blah blah blah shameless plug.

i/m very happy to be returning to the wonderful world of the west
and hope to meet more of you soon

I dunno, personally I thought the Gathering was criminally oversold - we got
in by about 12:30 or so and frankly they should have turned us away, not to
mention everyone who came in after.  The chill room would have been great
had there been room to turn around, but it was so jammed it was scary.
They were lucky nothing happened.  And the other building was even worse!
Not to mention the fact that they closed the second buliding at about 4.  It
would have been a great location if it hadn't been overfilled.  That's
irresponsible of the promoters IMHO.  They should know better.

Even so I had fun, saw almost everyone I knew who was supposed to be there
and managed to keep with the people I came with.  better than that is that
we have some cause for optimism this year, we really do.  

looking forward,

I got to Vallejo around 1:45 and was told they weren't letting any more people
in.  So I hopped the fence (ruining a pair of pants on barbed wire)
and made my way to the back entrance of the main building where they weren't
letting people in.  I went to some other doors and pounded on them.  A few
seconds later me and a bunch fellow hooligans ran into the main building.
It looked like the pictures of those UK raves that you see, thousands of
sweaty bodies and mud.  The music when I was there (2-5) was mostly
techno and the accoustics, as Brian said, were pretty bad.  There were
lots of teenagers there and they didn't mind.  The other hall was
cool, not as intense as the main hall and all these tents to chill
out in.  Are the tents BYO?  The music was a lot better here and the
accoustics too, due mostly to a smaller space.

Anyway, I met up with my friends, and they were having a grEat time,
but they did tell me about a 2 hours wait in the freezing rain and
about the general lack of organization, which was a bummer.  My 
roommate said she had never been hit on by so many guys in her life!
They were generous with the water at $1.00 which was nice.  I thought
the vibe was pretty cool despite the abundance of macho-pubescent
posturing.  It says be something about the community spirit to have
5000 or so people dancing together in the freezing muddy rain, in harmony.
Well.. except for the guy that we saw being carried on in a straightjacket
on a stretcher by the Fire Dept..

Hmm... that's interesting, when I was in NYC in November visiting my sister
and her husband, my sister invited Dudley (they're friends) to dinner...
Dudley mentioned that his editor forced him to focus less on raves and more
on something else (psychedelic culture). But it looks like some of the

We got to Gathering ~10:30 PM.  Saw Brian and others in line -- dittoed Brian's
solution to line problem.  First building too crowded, went to back building.
Ah, much better.  Dance, dance, dance, rest.  Ventured into main building
again.  Met Susiez & friends.  Dance, dance, uhoh too intense.  Head for back
building again -- accidentally pass by speaker wall on way out.  Caught.
Velcroed ourseleves to speakers.  Bliss.  Eventually unstick ourselves, on to
back building.  Chilled out.  Friend i came with babysat some freaked
overindulging guy.  Met a leprachaun.  Back to main building to meet friends
at entrance. No show -- they got turned away.  Bumped into two of my students
(oops).  Found small chill-out room behind outdoor stage.  Nice though crowded.
Met other sfravers.  Started worrying about car getting stuck in mud, decided
to leave while we could.  Car-hunt.  Wade, wade, found it.  Car made it to
fairgrounds entrance, died.  Not good.  15 minutes, got it started, sputtering,
away we go.  Car dies on 80 on-ramp.  Very not good.  Much stress ensued.
20 minutes later car starts, get out of that situation.  Okay for a little 
while, more sputtering.  We decide best to choose its resting place this time. 
End up in a parking lot.  Wet.  Finally call cab.  Home.

Great time there, rough ending.

Yeah, it's a big article and raves are just one thing he gets into...
It looked really interesting.  There's two full page sidebars, one on
Moby and the other on the Orb (I think...like I said, I just skimmed
it looking for bay area rave stuff).  The article is so big that no
one will probably want to type it in, either.

Well, after waking up at 6 this evening, stumbling into
the shower, nuking a frozen pizza and stumbling aimlessly about
the house for 45 minutes, I decided to type up a little
Gathering experience report...

first off, thanks to Brian and Stevie for intercepting me at various
points in the evening--if I ever ask any of you "where's zak?" AGAIN,
hit me!

GREAT to Susie, Paul, Taxi, Mykl, and everyone else who I melted by...
familiar faces were a great stabilizing force in what was one of the most
CHAOTIC experiences of my life...

For those of you didn't go, the place was about 30 minutes from the city,
in large auditoriums where two of the Basics were held.  There was a
really really large one and a not so large but still pretty good sized
and more than adequate for a great basics a last month...

So.  we get there around 9:30 'cuz it starts at 9 supposedly and we
want to get in  before the big rush...ERRRRG.  Nope, huge line
ANYWAY...we get in line, move 30 yards in 1 and half hours, dealing
with the rain and mud and (for my bare legs) the creeping cold...
odd..that seems so long ago...:)

We FINALLY get in-$20 with a can of food, $25 without (apparently
that extra $5 goes to the same charity as the cans), which was expected
I guess.  Some guy was selling canned food outside the door, which was
interesting...

Inside the huge room was chaos.  Lasers, black light paintings, and huge
speakers...and a whole hell of a lot of people.  I didn't really mind all the people,
but it got to the point where there was no place to sit down and it just got
(for me) EXTRA hectic.  Thankfully, there was the other building, which
I ran to with Stevie and Brian who were very polite while I rambled how
'93 was a hoax, let's just skip to '94... (how do you do a sheepish grin
squid?) :} ?

so I finally got into the other building and chilled out with everyone for
a while in this cool ambient space they had set up with tents and paintings
and such.  There was a medium sized dance area which played some really
groovy stuff, which was nice.  There were about 500 people in there I guess,
but that is a guess...?

Anyway, for some reason I needed to go into the BIG room and here Jeno
spin.  So Zak and I braved the now torrential downpour (which was
actually an AMAZING experience, really neato, but I think (I know) 
I caught something. koff-koff.
Once in the big room, the oppressive room, the freaked out I am beyond
the earth room, I had my senses just assaulted by Jeno who played (I felt, literally)
some wicked tunes...it was really fantastic.  Hard core....yowch!  The 
music was pretty loud, and it was probably the best part of the evening
becuase I knew where everyone was (I always seem to be looking for people
at these things!).

SOOOO, the night went on like that for awhile, and then I just couldn't take
it any longer, so we chilled outside for a bit (literally chilled) and got
our coats and stuff from our friend in the other building.  It was a good time there
because the smaller room was clearing out (it was about 6:30) and all the people
that I USUALLY see at Basics and Destiny were there, so I was able to 
talk to a bunch...that was relaxing.

Then we went back to the BIG room and danced to Garth techno-disco 
flavour mix.  That was a lot of fun.  They pulled the same lights up
trick that they did in the final basics, which I LOVE, cuz then you get
to see all these people in real light.  Garth played the last part of MLK's 
"I have a dream" speech, which I thought was very very very cool, and 
laid down some good chunky bass and eveyone just grrrooooooved. That
was awesome.  It was nice that most of the people had left (apparently
a lot of Cool World attendees-type people were there, so that
could account for the rather huge numbers) so all the "normal" ravers
just got back into it.  Fantastic!

It was at this time I noticed how thrashed the place was.  The combination
of 3,000+ (maybe?) people and the rain led to flooding in the bathroom,
and puddles in the dance floor, not to mention just boat loads of 
dirt and mud and grime and nasty junk all around the floor...a friend of mine
was cleaning up and he looked MISERABLE...a long job indeed.

Some neat points--watching Martin dance on the speakers, bumping in to
Jeno and saying hello (he's hilarious.  Just stands and watches all of it...),
chilling with the Ameba folks, and bumping into all the sfravers...
community!

We went to the Stone for the after party (I know, should've gone to 
DNA, but we thought it would just be a zoo), which was pathetic.  About
35 people showed up.  We watched Carlos spin, which was great, because
he's so fun to watch.  After spending about 1.5 hours, we heaved a great
sigh, and left for home.

All in all, a wacked out New Year's.  It was a good party, I thought, but
I just got freaked by how many people there were and the confusion
of trying to find everyone.  Once I relaxed about such things, I had a ball.

Happy New Years, folks.  
I start school on Monday, so it will be awhile before I can
go out and dance again...after the 23rd, probably..

take care

mike

Subject: Vallejo police arrest hyperventilating rather than medicating

I had a awesome time at The Gathering.

Incident ...

Person was on the ground having trouble dealing with whatever he was on
(say, crystal, ecstasy, acid or something like that).  He probably needed
water, rest, assurance, air, and a few other basic first aid things
(like being in the correct position, etc.)  His friends were standing around
not knowing what to do, basically going "duhhh".  Someone I know
found this boy and started helping him; she, like me, knows that a raver
paramedic guy was working at that rave that night, and decided to go to
security to explain what was going on, to get the raver paramedic to help
out.  She was on her own various things too, so she was not at tip-top
conditions.  Well, the security people, instead of getting the paramedics
called the Valejo police, who came, snuck up on this person, grabbed them
and carried him via all fours and handcuffed him in the back of a police car.
He was turning blue at this point, hyperventilating, and scared as hell,
before the police even snuck up on him.  My friend was with him for all
the time before the police got there, and he had been totally calm and
starting to deal with his problems.  The police claimed he had been violent.

This is rediculous.  Someone with some mild body condition which needs
basic first aid and is scared and tripping, is instead put into handcuffs
with no attention to his medical needs; instead of simply taking care of him,
there could easily be a headline reading "raver dies in police car"
or something.

This isn't fair to the raver, to the rest of the ravers, or to anyone.

My friend called the Valejo police, and there wasn't yet a police report.
How can five police cars, a fire engine all at the same place arresting
a tripping person with all fours at 4AM on the 1st of the new year (1993)
with many people in the vicinity fail to file a police report?  Yeah right.

Anyway, this is so all you know what's going on.

The track is "The Dream" by Out of the Ordinary and is definitely a
Garth favorite.  It was released in 1988.

I have mixes of this song on two CD compilations.  The better remix of
the two (the more acidy one) is on a pink CD called "This is Only a
Test" (which features other 1988 house tracks from Jean Paul Gaultier,
Simon Harris, Liz Torres, and Baby Ford).  The other compilation is
"New Beat, Edit 1" on ZYX Records (which features tracks from Bigod 20,
Pankow, Robotiko Rejekto and other Belgian/German industrial bands).

Both CDs are hard to find, though I have seen both of them on occasion
in used CD stores.  The New Beat one is usually reasoably priced, but
the "This is Only a Test" CD was a limited pressing of 1000 CDs and
usually sells for $40 or more.

I saw 3 rave citings in the media on Dec. 26th as I read magazines
while flying to the East Coast for some concerts...

1) in the early edition of the sunday, Dec. 27th Denver paper:

   In the entertainment section, a front-page article about
   CO raves which unfortunately talked mostly about rave fashion (!).

2) in the early edition of the sunday, Dec. 27th Denver paper:

   In the music section, the critics' best-of-'92 articles
   mentioned much house music and even talked about raves.

3) In Forbes mag (could have been Inc.), p. 44:

   A 4-page article about Thorn EMI.  Even though
   'house music' was in the title, it isn't mentioned
   until the last page.

Happy raving,

All of the negatives about the Gathering are well-deserved criticisms.
Inept security, poor planning and facilities.  However, I was glad to see
many friends for the New Year, both in Vallejo and at the End Up.  I started
Friday by echoing M's sentiments about optimism for the rest of 1993; by 4
pm I was facing probable divorce for being out so long.  (Aw, jeez, I was
having such a good time, I really DID forget to call!!)  Anyway, after a day
to think about it, divorce is off, so back to optimism about the future.
(One good point about the disagreement: it caused my other half to go to
West Marin for and overnight, and I got to go to Groove Kitchen without
guilt or recriminations - yay!!!).
Happy sleeping, all you ravers and raverettes!

Well gee, I defected to SuperNova (not an enormous green hatchback!) and
it sounds like maybe a good move considering other people's experiences.

The place was very crowded of coarse but you could still find a dry piece of
carpet or even a chair to sit and rest, I-Magi-Nation and the Tibetan prayer
singers were way fun, the usual lasers, slides, intellabeam, 3-d video stuff,
smart and dumb bars, vending, a great cross-section of good natured earthpeople,
easy parking, lines moved quickly to get in, warm and dry!  The carnival rides
got stuck on highway 80 or something on acount of the storms (so much for the
carnival at the end of the universe).  My ticket was $21 in advance.  Was 
reluctant when it came time for my group to move on to another party at 3 am in
search of more high adventure.  No complaints here,....had a blast!

Subject: Groove Kitchen was K00L!


Well, since I missed out on the new years festivities, i had to make up for
it all by going to Groove Kitchen (this was my first GK too). Definitely a
fun rave, I think Spun is godlike, good crowd attitude (though most
strangers' love phasers were set on low), good visuals, and at least 10
other happy sfravers made it seem like a family event. The groove was
strongly tribal; my usual statement about Spun still applies -- "he ain't
no DJ, he's a fuckin' neurosurgeon."

Best of all, it wasn't at all crowded, there was no inhumane/stupid line
out front -- basically a completely hassle free experience (unlike the
gathering).

work-off too many X-mas-season rich-and-tasty food overeating xperiences.

  I had heard that the Shamen at the Spruce Goose in LA (this was back
in 10/91) needed 2500 to break even.  At $20 a head that's a $50K budget!
They got barely 3000 people there.  I had heard that some stuff like
Circa '92 had a $75K budget or something equally outrageous.  And the
three day flop in Mexico last year had a $100K
budget. 

  Luckily the average price for a rave or afterparty now in LA seems
to be approaching $10.

Subject: More hits, more Caffiene, and ... a raver's lunch: Thursday at Noon

Sounds fairly conclusive, I guess.  Though when women do
things like that to me, I don't assume that they're hitting
on me.  One more of life's little inequities.  

I think Pat mentioned something about it, but there's a
small rave going on in the Stanford Coffee House on Friday
the 8th (for those of you who aren't going skiing).  
Starts at 8PM and runs to 5AM: DJs are Sean (of Deep Space),
Harry Who, DJ Unknown and Francesco (of KZSU's Tuesday
afternoon rave show) and of course, Sleepyhead.  

I just heard that they're going to have a chill space with
Japanese Animation running, which sounds like a cool idea.
I've been to some SF conventions in this area where the most
interesting thing to do is hang out and watch Anime
videos... I just hope they're not dubbed or with subtitles,
I prefer not understanding the dialog. 

And finally, it's about time for another sfraves lunch at my
place, no?   Call it Thursday (1/7/93) around noon.  Once
again this is kind of bring your own, but I'll try and have
some stuff around, so don't stress too much about it.   The
place is 679 Stanford Avenue at Williams St, phone number is 
857-0938.  I guess I'll append my usual map here... 

By the way, I'm seriously thinking about going to see WAX:
The Discovery of Television Among the Bees at 8PM on
Thursday night, the last night it's playing up at the Roxie.
Anyone interested in making an expedition of it?  We could
go looking for a Thursday night weekly afterwards.  Maybe
United at 579 Howard?  

Oh and one last by the way, honest: I'm doing my
industrial-techno-whatever blend on KZSU 90.1 FM, Wednesday
from noon-3PM (which means no Come/Unity for me, oh well).
Anyway, this is probably your last chance to hear me before
I'm exiled to the back shift next quarter.

And now, finally, for real, here's the map:

Subject: what? not another NewYeve synopsis?!?!?!


hello everybody,  TAXI here,

here's my New Year's eve night synopsis:

got together with 3 old non-raving friends (we used to call ourselves the
Bohemian Boys Club) and passed midnight at Zanzibar which was great!  A real 
mix of ravers, regular club types, older folks, jus-everyday people.  My 
friends started hooting on their little kazoos about 5 minutes to midnight
and I found that very funny.  They didn't care that they were off by a few
minutes..... and they got the rest of the crowd started.  After about 1.5 hours
of good dancing, I noticed my sober non-raving friends had slipped into trance
dancing without knowing it -- I didn't tell them what dancing to house can do..
By this time, aah ahhhh, Ahhh.  So I lost track of time but somehow was intro-
duced to two women who wanted rides to Gathering by a fellow sfraver -hi! and
on we went.  Saw a total of about 10 broken down cars on the side of the road,
the rain was coming down HARD and also saw the aftermaths of 3 car accidents,
one which involved 4 cars.  Driving was getting to become quite a 
responsibility in these hazardous conditions but we finally made it there to 
find out they weren't letting any more cars in the parking lot and that they
weren't allowing any more humans in either.

Being a veteran of being turned away at the door or at the entrance road to
too many raves, I knew exactly what to do.  So we parked in the adjoining 
Holiday Inn car lot and waded our way through half foot deep puddles and
finally got to the door and they weren't letting anymore in with or without
braclets.  Somehow after about 10 minutes of waiting, we found ourselves inside
as if almost by magic (we didn't pay either).  We just basically just walked 
right in when a window of opportunity arose when all the guards were busy.  It
almost seemed kinda like a dream.  It really was weird.  Once inside, and it
must be about 3:30am now, I never saw so many people under one roof.  It just 
blew my mind.  I thought I saw more people than last New Year's Eve ToonTown
(which got about 7,500) thanks to my height/vantage point.  Met a bunch of
sfravers but didn't stop to chat with any except Brad.  I've noticed that 
lately when I see sfravers I recognize at a rave, we don't chat.  Instead we
kinda just acknowledge eachother's presence and then move on like there's some
driving force moving us onward.  Not chatting really irks me and I can't figure
out why this happens.  Anyway, Hi yous alls!

The crowd was nowhere near as energetic as the potential was, there were a few
pockets of energetic dancing here and there, and I actually seemed to start a
small area of energetic dancing around where I decided to trance dance.  Never
met so many people who were doing "flips in the air" while "sucking on a piece
of candy."  I retreated to the only dry mat in the main dance floor for the 
rest of the night until the lights came on.  I love it when the lights are on
because I can see everyone's faces even if they are showing the strains of a 
night's worth of partying.  Everybody's facial skin tone becomes very varried
and I love looking at that.  It's obvious to tell where the blood is pumpin
and where it ain't in everybody's faces.  I feel my face must look just as 
strained as everyone else's so I don't care and most people don't seem to mind
either.  A few people plopped on sun-glasses indoors.  I didn't find out about
the other dance rooms or chill room :-(  I talked with a friend about the 
higher consciouslness of raving and read Mark's "Ameba Message #2"  I then
spent the next 20 min. helping a minivan unstuck itself from the mud - at one
point there must have been 10 people pushing that van - it was so quool how
people seemed to show up from nowhere to help out!!!  I dropped myself home 
and plopped into bed and haven't partied since.  Probably won't until next 
New Year's Eve -- NO WAY,  JUST KIDDING :-)  Plus life is a party anyway
while I'm awake and it's even a party while I sleep/dream, even if at times,
it's not as pleasant as I wish

See the Light,
Set love phasers to 'stun',
Be careful when releasing negative energy into your environment - it travels 
far and can affect the earth/others in ways you may not suspect.

Between the free party at 1015 Folsom a couple of weeks ago, this
event, and the freeish party (2$ donation) they threw at Atlantis
yesterday, the Groove Kitchen people seem to be doing the most
to "keep the scene alive". 

> So who came on after Spun?

I got there at 4 and stayed for Evil Eddie Richards, who *really* knows
how to work a groove.  Although not as techno as I usually like, he's
become one of my new favorites.  Does anyone know if he's relocated from
England to the bay area for good?  We also got treated to Blow doing
some killer live trumpet during the set.  Not quite as magical as when
he played with Simon over Piano Trance at DNA's NewYear's thingie, but
still great.

Subject:  A NUTTY NEW YEARS EVE

yet another exciting story for new years:

The day started off with my friend, Kim, from souther california arriving right
on time at about 4:00 in the afternoon,  Kim, my girlfriend, Shannon and I just
hung around my house dying with anticipation of the Rave.  We wanted to go
early but we had to wait till my neighbor got off work at 8:30. 

My nieghbor got home from work and another friend Ellen came and joined us at
9:00.  We then went to the City to a friends Party we wanted to go directly to
the rave but we had to pay our respects and pick up some more.  

at about 10:30 my truck was packed with 7 people, and we were off to the Rave.
At this time I was very nervous about what the crowd was going to be like, when
we arrived at 11:30.  The line was very long but it seemed to be moving so we
didnt try to cut(I cut at Caspar and had a very bad time I didnt want the same
, we did however meet up with SFRAVERS Jon and Joe and got with them in line.  

The line was very freindly and we were all having a good time and got into the
rave about 12:20.  We found a spot for the group to hang out and then preceded
to have an awsome time.  

I did not like the music at first from 12:30-1:00 it was much too techno but
from there it got much better.  The rest of the night was a blurr, When I go
with the group I am in it seems that we end up being this single love cell,
Sharing lots of hugs and kisses.  This was Kims first rave and she thought this
was normal and I to explain that are group has a very high limbido and not all
Ravers are as sexual as us.

I met alot of good friends there including many SFRAVERS, especially Paul
Richards which no rave would be complete without (lover your pearls Paul).
I also me up with some really cool friends from Santa Fe, Chey and his freinds.
 Chey and I have very similiar dance styles and we totally go nuts dancing.

Since there was really no place to sit, I found myself dancing from 12:30 to
7:30 in the morning. At one point I was feeling really dizzy and weak and I
rested for 15 minutes and talked to my friend.  This really revived me and it
was a good thing I did it. 

We left the Rave at 7:00 and went out to my truck, After seeing many people
stuck in the mud I began to worry about getting my Truck out but was successful
after getting through one very slick patch. 

I then went to the End up and partied, My friend Kim did not like the HardCore
Techno but Like the Housier EndUp music.  I ended up staying at the EndUp until
5:00 that evening.  It was  alot of fun. 


 Peace and Love

not in the right frame of mind to notice it, I didnt realize she have the right
coat until later that day.  So if anyone knows of somebody who did not get
their correct raincoat from the coat check let me know.  

This is also a little forewarning that just because your coat is checked that
it is safe.  I now have a new coat with no idea of the owner.

Ho ho ho ho.  I can tell you that only one of the spaces I've used was even
close to meeting fire spec, but once it was filled past capacity it no longer

Down down down, the underground?  We threw a house party for New Years.  200
people got in, 100 people got turned away.  The house wouldn't take anymore
people.  There were concert-like crowd movements in the damn kitchen.  Beyond
that point, we cardboarded and black-plasticked all the doors and windows.
From the outside of the house, you couldn't have guessed what was going on

Myself and the two guys who I do this with discussed leasing a coliseum,
advertising our butts off, and raking in the sheep for New Years.  We decided
a house party would be more fun.  So we handed out 90 invitations and asked
for donations at the door.  We lost about $40 on the night, but people were
deliriously happy as they left that steam soaked house.

Happy New Year's everyone.

I got the to the Gathering late too, around 3:30, and they weren't 
letting people in.  But after having driven over an hour in the rain
(the Bay Bridge was jammed at 2:30 (!)), I wasn't going to head
back right away, and I figured I could hang out outside at least...
So I parked on a side street next to the Holiday Inn, and went up
there; I found Gunther outside the main building right away, and 
we went over to the second building, where I was able to get in -
no one was checking wristbands.  Most of the details of the rave 
have already been covered, so I'll skip all that.  I got into the
main building at around 5:30.  I didn't like the largeness of the
rave too much (not enough familiar faces), but it was good in most
other respects (since I didn't have to deal with the line).

I left at about 7, planning to go home, since my knees were sore, 
but I recovered enough during the drive back to go the DNA, which
was pretty crowded, in fact, more crowded than I've seen it at
night any of the past two years.  Saw Jon and Lee there, but I
wasn't inspired enough by the music to stay very long.

Finally, here's an updated phone list for one-stop shopping for

This happened to me all thee time at the Gathering, mainly because it was SO
LOUD in the main room I did NOT feeling like yelling to be heard.  Which is
a shame, because the dance floor is really where I see everyone, and I want
to be able to say hi and more than a few words rather than smile and shake my
booty.  There really was no inside space at the Gathering where I could talk
in a normal voice :(

Subject: Gathering Reviews

It was great seeing you all on New Years (not to mention Groove Kitchen,
which was far more my idea of a good time).  Everyone seems to have
enjoyed the Gathering, despite the chaos, rain, and other adversities.

I'm planning to give a print out of everyone's comments on the Gathering 
to the promoters.  They've often expressed interest in getting direct
feedback from SFRaves, including negative criticism, so here's your chance to 
express your ideas on how to improve their parties in the future.  If anyone
wants to hide their identity, use a pseudonym, etc., let me know.  I'll
even censor your comments if you insist, but you'll get an argument from
me first  ;^)

In particular, the 1.5 hour line problem (not helped by the fact the
doors opened one hour later than scheduled), the shortage of ticket
takers, and the concentration of brand-name DJ's in the main room were
the major drawbacks.  The main room was so huge, that dance energy was
never really focused or concentrated, at least until the last half of
Garth's set.  Also, the security presense was too clumsy and obstrusive,
which I've been noticing more and more at Gatherings and Basics'.

They switched from their usual sound system people (M&M?), and the
results may have been the best they could have been for that enormous a
space, but I'm not convinced.  Although many people thought the sound
wasn't loud enough at Vision, I thought it sounded better then than on
New Years.  Excepts for certain "sweet spots" on the floor (and right in front
of the speakers), all I could hear was earth-shaking bass and the high-end.
That's a big part of the reason so many people were just standing around,
not to mention the lack of places to sit.  Of course, with better weather
and freedom to get back to the main room, more people might have hung
out outside or in the "Space Camp" in the second building.

I thought Malachy's Ambient Temple was very nicely done, if a bit too
small.  The blow-torch style heaters were a great idea!

The maps of the floor plan were a great idea, but they ran out of them far
too early and the information was partially erroneous.  I got a kick out of
helping to hand them out, while they lasted.

Like all Gatherings, the best part was the last hour, when the lights
came on.  Although not everyone was in Love Phaser mode, enough people
were to make the human warmth spread thoughout the mud-soaked hall.

So far, I've collected comments from Brian, Geoff, Lee, Andrew T., Niels,
Doom, The Normals, Eric P., Gregg, Mike R., Paul T., Paul R., TAXI, and Nut.
If anyone else wants to get in on the action, please post or e-mail them to
me by the end of the week.

Oh, and Happy 1993 everyone.  Let's make it (another) one to remember.

i unlike the rest of you ended up at toon town
it was a LOT better then i expected...

things like the line outside and stuff i dont know about cause i was with
the vendors but i heard that it wasent bad..
the crowd was surprisingly decent - a lot of friendly people - and
only a handful of slimy ones on the dance floor..
it was a BIG space the entire floor of the fashion center..
i only wish that i could have walked around and explored it more.
a lot of first time ravers but they seemed to really get into it.
security was present but relatively unobtrusive - and i didnt hear of
any problems..

i talked to a few people who left the gathering and came to toon town
cause they were disgusted with the wait and how crowded it was..

over all it was a good new years!  i may have a slightly skewed
opionion cause i wasent able to spend much time on the floor but i had
lots of fun!  :)

Subject: the gathering

what's to say?  i pulled into the parking line at 11:09, was standing
in line to get in by 11:20, saw several jillion sfravers who all
jumped in line with me, got into the actual event around 12:15 and
proceeded to have a fine time until 5:30 AM at which point i had to
leave to take my out-of-town visitor friends back to their hotel in
the city.

and no, i didn't cut in line at all!

yeah, it was cold.  yeah, the mud sucked.  no, i didn't like standing
in an inch and a half of brackish water while using the toilet, but
that's why the good dr marten invented his patented ass-kicker boots.
(they looked like shit the next day but a little saddle soap and mink
oil took care of that.  try that with your nike's!!)

i wasn't planning on meeting too many new people given the huge size,
but i did anyway (friends of friends, mostly).  i was mainly there
because i knew all my rave pals would go and it's always nice to see
the smiling faces of so many cool people.

i wasn't into the music at all until jeno spun "hear the drummer get
wicked" at which point i turned into a ball of non stop raving fury.
i didn't really want to leave when i did but my friends from back east
were burned out (their first rave - you should've seen their faces
when they walked in and saw the huge space!) so i brought them home
and went to the DNA.  i wasn't into it particularly - the DJs that I
heard (shon and buck) were pretty dreadful, and the crowd didn't seem
particularly ravey, so i bugged outta there around 9.30...

uvc news: three new remixes of the trip are in the can.  my favorite
is the 100 bpm specially-designed-for-stoners slow motion mix, but i'm
biased since i did that one myself.

I'll say!  Shon (Shaun?) inspired me to do something quite out of
character for me, and very non-ravey.  I actually went up to him in the
middle of his set and told him to "Pick it up a little, people want
to party."  He probably thought I was a real asshole, (and I guess I
was) but I just didn't care.  He gave me this bemused look and just
said, "I think I have them where I want them."  I'll never figure out
where that was.  Buck might have been even worse, creating the pretense
of a groove, only to kill it over and over again.  I was fairly numb
at this point, and just spaced out for a while.  I was about to leave
when Simon, like a Messiah, suddenly appeared and lifted the scene into
the heavens (relatively speaking).

> and the crowd didn't seem

It usually isn't at the DNA, but I highly recommend checking out Simon's
set at the AfterLife, Sundays, 10am - 12.  $3, good music, decent sound,
visuals, free water.

In a coma.  Strange too, cos the last time I heard him (which was also
at DNA), he was brilliant.  Occasionally he showed a few flashes of
that, when he veered into funkier grooves, but overall it wasn't
enough.

>Buck might have been even worse, creating the pretense
>of a groove, only to kill it over and over again.

he *definitely* was worse.  between tom tom club's "genius of love" (a
fine track but not one you can just slip in the middle of a set) and
michael jackson's "i want to rock with you" i was feeling physically
unwell.

>I was about to leave when Simon, like a Messiah, suddenly appeared

i've never been impressed with simon but i didn't hear him that day.
did anyone stick around to hear spun?

simon is not always there from 10 - 12.  the lineup varies from week
to week.  as for the crowd, i should've said "it seemed /particularly
un-ravey/".

did anyone make it to the stone?  i ran into rick preston at dna and
asked if he was going to spin and he said he was going to spin at the
stone.  i would've gone there just to hear him but i had promised
several people that i'd meet them at the dna...

incidentally, if you like rem-style folky/rocky music, my cousin's
band _pounding birds_ is playing at the dna on the 8th.  i don't
really like their stuff, but somebody might.  tell the bass player
(max drukman) that you know his cousin jon drukman...

One of them was me and my friends thanks Jon, this was as much cutting as I
did, which I consider Ok , you were saving my place in line.

For sure I have a seven year old pair that keep on going, They have gotten me
through raves in all kinds of places keeping my feet warm and dry.  You can

Subject: DJ mixer wanted


Anyone have a favorite place to buy DJ mixers?  I want a fairly
basic one for around $200.  I checked Uncle Ralph's on Saturday,
and they sell a Gemini for $150, but they were out of stock.  
Another place I stopped at said Numark was temporarily out-of-business,
but they should start shipping again soon.

Any one think that one brand is great and the other sucks?

Thanks,

Derek

Future Forum Report

If your into warehouse artist collective/rave party production/tekno-
industrial type of playhouse then the Future Forum may be for you!

Spearheaded by Mark Metz, this potential scenario has a real facility waiting
to be used.  The warehouse itself is being managed at present by the son of
the owner and seems to be available as long as things are happening and the
rent is paid.  I was lead to think that the circumstances are a little
sweeter than dealing with perhaps a property management service should a
worst case situation occur.  

Mark postulates that this collective would have a membership of 50-100
persons paying about $20 amonth dues and volunteering a few hours amonth for
full privilege access to resources of the collective.  Now don't forget the
owner's son whose name I forgot (oops) is still doing his parties and stuff
there too and will have to supplement this monthly rental of $4000 amonth 
(ding me good if I got that figure wrong).

As things progress here, open house parties would happen perhaps on a monthly
basis and of course would gather momentum as they progressed further easing
the overhead.  These parties would be designed to provide a quality
experience at an affordable price to the attendees.  

So basically the meeting comprised these things plus the meaning of rave
dialog that we all know and love here on the net.  Hopefully we can look
forward to a continuation next week and address some logistical items like:
building security, property insurance for equipment and tools, and how to
"prime the pump" in so many ways.

Once the ball is rolling everyone will want to be on board I'm sure, but who
wants to be the first to pay $20 a month and move their gear into an empty
warehouse?  

There is a cool sounding Sun. nite party there from 12 am till 6 or
something.  That maybe a good place to start.  The site may provide a good
space for SFRAVE events also.  Mark also implied that the Exploratorium and
Survival Research Laboratories may want to help sponsor some of this stuff if
they see a demonstrable scene happening there.

So what can be said of all this?  Let's see if Mykl G. or Michael Wertheim
have a response and if any other SFRAVERS show up next week.

10  2   05:46 Dub Collective: House
11  1   06:46 Irresistable Force: Space is the Place

Comments: Rising High presents a collection of their stronger tracks on this
domestic compilation by Instinct.  Hypnotist has never spun my whistle, and
their tracks on here are nothing unusual.  Earth Leakage Trip's track contains
the most whiney annoying sample I've ever heard, it drives me up a wall, very
disappointing.  Wells & Newman give us another alias with Signs of Chaos and
a really good track as well, more in the GTO style than Church of Extacy.
Finally, the original version of Irresistable Force's "Space is the Place"
makes the "Cosmic Mix" on GPAD2 seem like an afterthought.  "Space" is trance
at its best.

Summary: 7/10.  Domestically priced, but more than a few weak tracks.


Moodfood by Moodswings
Arista/BMG: 07822-18619-2
1   4   06:21 Throw Off the Shackles
2   3   05:52 Moodswings Overture

10  2   05:14 Spiritual High (Part III)
11  1   07:30 Thailand
12  1   08:35 Hairy Piano

Comments: Pink Floyd does Orb?  Not really, but this album brings in names
like Jeff Beck, Chrissie Hynde, Johnny Marr, and Vangelis to attempt a richly
produced ambient album.  It does work, wonderfully well.  Beautiful piano is
present in "Problem Solved" and of course "Hairy Piano".  Even though Vangelis
worked only on the "Spiritual High" trilogy, his style lingers like a ghost
throughout the album.  Hynde does wonderful vocal work on "State of
Independence" as well as Linda Muriel on "Rainsong".  The gospel choir sample
is also effective, but alas there is only one.  Jeff Beck's work on
"Skinthieves" leaves me hungry for the Hillage riffs on System 7, Beck doesn't
quite fit in here.  Last, the drum work is complete yawn.  Nothing unusual and
rather repetitive.

Summary: 8/10.  Beautiful but flawed.  Tracking on the CD is poorly done.


Wishdokta: Bannana Sausage
Slip n' Slide/Kickin: KICK 11 CD
1   4   05:15 Bannana Sausage (Original Mix)
2   3   05:44 Acidic Re-vamp (Hardnut Mix)
3   3   05:30 Live in Hamburg (Passion Fruit Mix)
4   4   04:47 Bannana Sausage (Mysterious Munch Mix)
5   4   05:12 Basepeal (Raggananna Mix)

Comments: Formulaic house of little worth.  "Munch" and "Raggananna" almost
save things, but not quite.  The rest of the remixes are just variations on a
theme.  To make things worse, the "Acidic Re-vamp" contains airhorns and crowd
sounds, but no acid.

Summary: 3/10.  Not good, especially as an import.  Buy some Skin Up instead.


Sequencial: Psychotronic - The Remixes -
Play it Again Sam/Who's That Beat?: WHOS 68 R CD
1       01:18 Horror Mix 1
2   5   05:15 LA Riot Satisfy Your Lust For Destruction Mix
3       01:28 Horror Mix 2
4   4   04:35 Groove Mix
5   4   01:47 Another Sick Joke

Comments:  I believe this came out before Prodigy's "Fire", but it doesn't
matter, despite the use of the same Arthur Brown sample, I like this version
better.  Acid out the yang with sliding whistles, wailing sirens, and plenty of
303 and 808, Sequencial makes good.  Despite the standard acid house ideas,
they manage to maintain a sort of originality.  "Another Sick Joke" is a must
hear and is definitely going to start up or close off a few of my sets in the
future.

Summary: 8/10.  The "Horror Mix"es are a bit puzzling, since they are almost
identical, but other than that, this is a nice single.


Eskimos & Egypt: State of Surrender EP
One Little Indian: EEF 95 CD
1   3   03:48 State of Surrender (Original 7")
2   3   04:41 Dub Mellow
3   4   05:04 SOSO303
4   3   04:06 Pro-Gress Four Vox 7"
5   4   05:55 The Butcher
6   4   05:34 Dub Metal
7   4   04:58 Eurodobulous

Comments:  Something has to be wrong when thrash guitars put me to sleep, but
that is definitely what happened while listening to the remixes of this
single.  To start with "State of Surrender" is not good to begin with, dopey
vocals and syrupy voices.  The main problem is that E&E can't keep it up past
30 seconds.  Within that time, you get the entire gist of the track, then it
just repeats what you've already heard.  "Eurodobulous" is the best thing on
the disc, but its sound definitely stems from older Europop.

Summary: 3/10.  Some good baselines, but nothing that keeps your attention.

Does Vangelis actually appear on the album?  "State Of Independence" is a
cover of the old Jon & Vangelis song, but this is the first I'd heard that
V. actually worked with Moodswings.

My Gathering report:

We arrived around 1:00 and were told by the gate attendant:  "blah blaah
you can't come in blaaah blah blaah sorry blahh blah should of come
earlier blahh blah".

We started to leave and then I spotted the Holiday Inn and it's
geographical signifigance to the rave.  We did the Holiday Inn boogie.

We got in line.  My friend Steve immedietly went to scout out the
perimeter because of obvious line difficulties.  He hopped the fence and
got in but the rest of us didn't know for sure until we hooked up with him
inside around 3:30.  While he enjoyed 2 hours of dancing my other three
friends (all virgin ravers) and I hung out in line.  After an almost an
hour I spotted Phoebe (Hi) and chatted.  She introed me to Niels (Hey,
good to meet you, better circumstances next time hopefully.).  Cops came
by at one point and I heard rumors of a robbery in side.  I wonder if that
was realy about that raver in a bad head space.  Phoebe and Niels both
decided to move on (independent of each other and with respective groups
they were with), Phoebe being kind enough to invite us to her house to try
and save the rest of the night.  Since my friend Steve was either inside or
busted we decided to try to get in.  They slowly started letting people in
at the door about (8-20 people every 20 min.) around 2:30 and then finaly
around 3:00-3:30 Martin was realy cool and gathered the last 50-100 of us
on the outside together and made the anouncement that he would let everyone
in for free but that we had to walk double-file up to the main area and we
couldn't go into the main dance floor until 5:30 when it was more cleared
out.  From that point on I had a good time dancing, walking, chillin' (cool
space with undersea sea lion, etc. film footage on the wall while playing
Merl Saunders - Blues from the Rain Forest, candles, incense, etc.).  Saw
and chatted with Greg, the only sfraver I saw inside.  We left around 6:00,
ironicly because Steve (who didn't stand in line in the rain for two hours)
had to be back to work but I knew that when we came.

I never caught the vibe from within myself because I didn't get the chance
to work it up, coming so late and all.  It was hard to feel it around anyway.
It's hard when you feel a little responsable for the positive experiences
and entertainment of your first time raver friends.  I didn't see any attitude
but it wasn't overflowing with good vibes either.  Things would have been a
lot better for that rave if it hadn't been raining.  All and all a very good
time (I'm easy) but I would have been disapointed had I payed.


Doom sayeth:

>At one point it dawned on me that a partial solution to the
>overheating problem would be to take off my shirt.  Almost
>immediately after I got rid of it, a woman hugged me at

Is this the answer to the hotly contested bare-chested-male debate ;-) ?
What about the as-of-yet-undebated bare-chested-female debate?  Something
that I saw more than a few times at the Gathering.  Somehow I doubt that
will spark as much controversey.

Hi Cybertribe,x 
I am starting a new magazine called Fuzzy Logic. It is a no compromise
full-on DIY(do it xyourself) scene tool kit. It is a non-profit project, any
profits will bex given to cha
rity. Stats of income will be posted in the magazine, how muchx money when
out to writers, h
ow much production cost, and what was donatedx each month. (thanks to
Consolidated for the idea, on 
their 91 tour theyx posted how much it cost to have shirts made and what
their profit was at $10x
 per shirt, i really respected that.)xx

The most issue today in the rave scene is fighting 
greed. We are gettingx raped by promoters, clothing manufacturers and record
companies. You don't need them to be a raver. No more will I buy a $20 shirt,
go to a $20 rave or buy a $20 import. Fuck'em.

If we refuse to be exploited, there is nothing they can do except lower
prices and increase qu
ality.x And if they don't we will just organize tape exchange networks, go to
inexpensive micro-
raves and make our own shirts and sell them for a few dollars above cost to
our friends.xx

Fuzzy logic will be dedicated to keeping the scene defined by ravers rather
than greedy people that see this as a chance to exploit us. Its editorial
slant will be do-it-yourself technology type stuff.  How to set
-up ax non-profit organization, get t-shirts printed, throw your own rave,
avoiding busts, set up a bulletin board or voice-mail system and how to build
your own light effects. It will also have typical magazine stuff; art,
reviews, scene reports and interviews with DJ's and promoters that are a
positive influence on the scene. My goal is a circulation of 10,000 for the
first issue.

I need your help. I need volunteers to submit stuff(art, reviews, scene
reports, clipped articles on the scene from other media sources and
interviews) to me on a regular basis. You will receive full credit and
financial compensation when possible. I need people to go out and get it
distributed at raves and record stores and people to get ads (it must be
done, anyone who brings me an advertiser will get 15% what that advertiser
spends in 
the magazine). My goal is a premier issue by April first. 

Don't feed the greed!xx

If ev
eryone gives more than they take, it could be a wonderful scene. xx

So who's willing to help?xx

Well, I have to admit that it pretty much settles the debate
in my mind, though I never was much confused about it.  
I missed the topless women at the Gathering... this is
pretty funny considering that one of the women I was with
was asking me if I thought it would be okay for her to take
her clothes off.  I didn't know what to tell her...
certainly it was okay with *me*, but much as I like Raves
they strike me as being very tame, moderate events (I mean,
a lot of people here seem to think it's scandalous for men
to go around without shirts!  What do you guys do at the
beach, anyway?).  So I couldn't swear to her that she
wouldn't seem out of place or something.  

Mostly what was going on is that she was feeling like the
clothes she had on were too ordinary.  I told her that I
didn't think it was possible to dress inappropriately at a
rave.

Though maybe that's not quite right.  I've been gently
hassled for wearing a leather jacket ("you look *tough*
man!").  I should try wearing a business suit sometime.  Or
maybe my urban camoflauge pants?

Subject: Bare Chested Raving

Interesting commentary on rave wear, or lack thereof.  In reading over these
posts, I've been struck by a couple of things:  many of us seem to expect
that others will somehow get our subjective intentions in taking off our
shirts, as in "I wasn't coming on to you; I was just hot and sweaty" or "I'm
not preening, I simply enjoy dancing without the restrictions of clothing."
I was also thinking of a comment that Nut made yesterday about the
Gathering.  The group that we were with does tend to be more overtly
libidinous when raving -- lots of hugging, kissing, occasional crotch
grinding, great slither piles, etc. -- but (pardon me for telling this tale)
I also recall that when an amply endowed female in a sheer body stocking
danced by a one point, one of the (straight) males I was dancing with had to
move away because of his discomfort or possible arousal, I don't know which.
In any event, it seems that in most instances, if the person who is in a
state of undress is comfortable with it, those around him or her will be
more likely to be cool about it.  If the bare skin is displayed to
titillate, then folks nearby will become uhncomfortable.  Just my .02.

That was me, and I thought it was great that she was wearing this but in my
state I was in I couldnt help from gawking, and I did not want to be impolite,
even though I would be and have been flattered when people have gawked at me
when I have been skantly dressed.  I was also just kidding a little bit with
Paul, wanting to get back to our group on the other side of the Dance floor.

Now for something completely different.  My girlfriend mentioned to me that the
whole night at the rave in the main room she neer walked throught the center of
the floor where the progection screen was hanging.  She was saying how she kept
thinking that there was a stage there or something.  I realized the same for
myself and always went around and invisible box. 

The more I think about it the more I really enjoyed the Gathering.  Almost
passing out from dancing to much is a good indication of a rave to me.

 Peace and Love

I understand that the Brothers Love Dubs "Mighty Ming" is undergoing a 
reprinting, it's a nifty if not overdone song and I'd sure like to get a 
hold of it.  If anyone notices it popping up at BPM please post, or is the
reprint just a hoax anyway?  After unearthing a copy of the "Tingle" remix
by That Petrol Emotion I do have hopes for such possibilities.  Anyhow hope
to see some folks at Toons this evening with Spun/Rick, peace

i wish i could make it to toons tonite, as i bopped to spun / rick religiously
for months, but after just moving in to a new place, i am broke like no.joke!
o make any raves for about a month and a half!!

but......an upside to getting a new place [after the three months rent is 
paid :( ] is a housewarming party.  my roommate rob, who does ambient rooms,
has a killer cd collection, and we have two bumpin' stereos, and we plan on
having a rippin' house warming party.  the crowd will be diverse as f#%k, and
all sf-ravers are invited to attend.

a downside is that i live in dtsj, which i know is out of the way for most, but
still, if you kan come, come!

Subject: Gathering and Vancouver

Gathering sounds a bit like a Vancouver NYE rave... 
We had snow (again), it was very very very cold (-10c).  Brrrr
The lineup at 11pm was 40 min (100 very cold people, some without
jackets, me in shorts).

The inside crowd was large and happE... Many were inhaling Vicks (not
VapoRub, but the little nose inhalors that send a cooool breeze over
your brain (perhaps they all had colds?))

A quick & sober estimate of the crowd (in three rooms 1-techno, 2-house, 
3-hiphop) put the attendance near 3000. (large for Vancouver)

At $31.00  dollars :-(, this was one of the cheapest NYE parties in
the city. Except for meeting some cool people, I don't think it warranted
the $31.00 buck ticket, but since the dome thing got cancelled,
it was the only rave goin.

Speaking of cool people, I've been on the list a little over a month
and I'm most thoroughly impressed with the utter coolness of all its
contributors. :-)  -So impressed that I'm extending an invite to 
sfravers that make it up here to Ice Station Zebra in the future.

Laters , and mahalos for all the reviews and stuff

Yes, love garage is still going on, there was one last friday on 1015 folsom
If you want deep house, look for the Sound Factory. They're opening this
Saturday at 525 Harrison (512-5767) with some people from the love garage and
guest dj from NYC.

	I'm gonna try to bring a TV to the Future Forum tonight to catch
the 48 Hours show (9-10 PM).  A lot of people didn't show up till past 10
last week, so i'd kinda like to tape it so latecomers can check it out if
they want.  i've got a VCR i can bring, but my tv isn't on speaking terms
with VCRs at the moment.  So, anybody else who's going tonight got a
tv that's VCR-friendly they'd be willing to bring?  If not, i'll see if
i can play back on my other (old B&W) set.  Or maybe there's a tv
already there, anybody know?

Oh yeah, i heard there was an LSD resurgence/ rave report on one of the
local news shows last night.  Tonight there supposed to do a report on
X.  Not sure which station though...

of people still on winter vacation, because it was pretty crowded
all the way till the end, a little after 6.  I stayed till the
end too, even though I'm working today (got in around 11:30).

Subject: KPIX Rave/MDMA report


 After the "48 Hours" report on LSD, local station KPIX had a short report
on MDMA and how raves act to spread the use of MDMA.

Blurb - " Worries about Bay Area parties like this, because of what's 
 showing up at them." Shot of rave.

Some short quotes from the report: (my opinion in () )

 The kids say it makes them feel warm, fuzzy, and friendly.

 ( Hey! That guy in the t-shirt with a white cloth around his head looks
   like Brian ! The t-shirt had a black abstract design on the back - twas
   you, Brian? )


 ( Damn! That guy with the annoying flashlight glasses! )

 Body aches and insomnia can last for weeks.

 Body temperatures can rise to 108 degrees.

 These were dyed green - they were seized around Christmas time, so maybe it
was a marketing ploy.

 Illicit drug production/contamination=liver failure/cutting with speed

 Relatively few deaths.

 SF Bay Area is MDMA production and exporting capital of the world.
 ( 48 Hours said the Bay Area was the LSD manufacturing center of the
   world - sheesh! )

 Legitimate MDMA research on hold - but one researcher has FDA approval.

 Seybrook Institute in SF will have free panel discussion on human 
research with hallucinogens will be held at 5:30PM tomorrow.

Boy, aren't you sorry they didn't come to more

they are so much more balanced and perceptive than 
they were in the 60s! I think the young people
they showed are 100% typical of the folx I've met

from Dan Rather's liberal lips, weren't they? I'm

more.  What was that nice lady's name?  Let's invite
her to be an virtual member of sfraves and connect

Subject: 48 Hours - my opinions


 Well ... not a bad report, since I wasn't expecting them to present LSD
in a way that could get them into trouble ( ie, no hint of 48 Hours
promoting LSD use ).

 Too bad that raves are again presented as the illicit drug supermarket 
for "naive" American/white kids for the 90's. [ strange, raves are usually
the most ethnically mixed events I know, but only white kids were shown ].

 Anybody recognize the acidheads that were interviewed ( outside of Timothy
Leary - he's too easy an ID! ) ?

 Who was the reporter who was thinking of coming to Connection? Erin 
Moriarty, or Edie Magnus?

 I've heard SF described as "Bagdad by the Bay", but "Halloween by the Sea" ? 

 Idiots on Haight Asbury!

 
 ****************************

 My opinion about LSD usage - do research first, ask your friends, take
negative reports under advisement.

 Proponents of LSD usually gloss over or omit the negative/possibly alarming
aspects of dosing when describing it - the intensity, the narrowing of 
focus, weird "buzzy" body sensations, the irreversible comittment of the 
next 8 - 12 hours.

 The ancient/primitive civilizations used drugs sacramentally - my personal
opinion is that this is a good model for LSD usage , in that it should be
infrequent, done at special times, and in special places. I was never 
fond of recreational use, but I'm a serious kinda guy...

 ****************************

 It's late for me, who has to be at work by 7:30AM! I'll be looking
forward to other folk's opinions. Also - anybody go to Future Forum
tonight? I heard that they are going to have a benefit rave this Friday
night, which happens to be my birthday! So, maybe after my b'day party,
I'll drive up to the Future Forum warehouse for some b'day raving!

I heard from a reliable source that there are several legit MDMA
researchers now. They originally petitioned to be allowed to use MDMA on
the mentally ill patients, but unexpectedly the FDA said that they would
rather have them test on normal humans. Very strange behavior for a still
Bush FDA. In any case, I hear some of the researchers are quite hip.

I think the Seybrook Institute thing is a must see for anyone with the time.

Probably the most interesting omission was the inevitable "Users guide

users, passed down from generation to generation.  Nah... that would
give an indication that maybe there are things you can do to increase
your enjoyment and minimize the dangers of LSD...

On the whole, not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be.

I say:
In the Research book Pranks! Timothy Leary talks about dosing a
bunch of convicted hard core criminals back in the late 60's. He
said it was really weird. On one side of the room a bunch of lifers
and on the other side of the room LSD researchers. Both sides were
scared to death of the other, the researchers because they thought
that they were going to get killed, and the lifers because they
thought the researchers were going to do something really weird to
them. Then they all dosed and had a good time!

hi folx!
according to bruce eisner, as he says it in the GNOSIS article, fda will
allow some research on mdma starting pretty soon. i don't  want to retype
 the whole article, but here's a quote of a quote :
' in july 1992, sarah pekkanen of states news service reported :
" faced with evidence that some illicit hallucinogenic drugs may benefit
certain patients, the federal govt. inon the verge of lifting its near ban
on lsd and ecstasy for therapeutic purposes.
the push to re-evaluate the govt.'s policy has come from researchers who
contend that under carefully controlled conditions, hallucinogens have been
shown to benefit terminally ill, alcholics and some psychiatric patients" '.
appearntly, one of the people pushing for change in govt.'s stance
is rick doblin of mulitdisciplinary assoc. for psychedelic studies, (MAPS).
dr. charles groeb of uc irvine would be doing the first human study with
mdma. in oct. 1992 he was still awaiting final approval for a study involving
terminal cancer patients and human volunteers from the medical profession.
anyway, there's more detail on this stuff in eisner's article.

I've heard the statistic that in the lifetime of the FDA they have
saved 15,000 lives, and killed 250,000. That, of course, does not
include the lives that have been lost in the drug war.
 
The bottom line, tag line, of all the anti-LSD  reports regardless of
what you feel personnally, it _is_ illegal. I don't see any reason that
LSD, marijuana, or any number of non-recrational drugs, such as
erythromycin should be illegal. The fact of the matter is that it is a
scam that our parents generation, that believed in 'MiRaCle' drugs has
bought into and ingrained in most of us.
 
You may know that there is a law already passed, but not the
enforcement clause, that would make large dosage vitamins illegal. The
only reason that I could see that this law was passed was that some
congreesman went to a rave and saw that kids today were getting high by
excercising and taking vitamins.
 
I think the absudity level of the FDA is now approaching the point
where the general public, and certainly folks like us who would like to
responsibly choose what to do with their own bodies, will begin to
demand the disemposwerment of the FDA.

Forget LSD, how would you like to have to pay $20 for a tab of B-100
before going to a rave!

Well here's MY $.02 worth.  First you have to understand that I don't
watch ANY TV (no, not even Star Trek:TNG anymore :). Having been influenced
by Abbie Hoffman and the Yippies in my early years, studying a little mass
indoctrination oops, imean mass communication in college, being a video editor
as well as artist, (a previous life, I remember PTV from the days when they were
considered video artist not Techno Musicians) I trained myself to be able
to deconstruct any television program in real-time.  It's amazing what a camera
angle or image texture can do to a viewer's responses.  I used to think that
there was some redeaming side to TV, maybe PBS or A&E or something, then the
Gulf War came along and all the "liberal" educational stations started
goosestepping right along with the networks, that's when I decided that I had
had enough and unplugged the Tube for good.  I do turn it on on "special"
occasions, so far maybe five or six times since then, the flu coup in russia,
LA riots,  I figured this might be an important  thing to watch so I did.
If you think that show was in any way shape or form objective or informative
I'm sorry  but I must say to you. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.

The major purpose of that show was to :

	1) Scare "middle" america (read: white families in the mid-west)
	2) Threaten and scare any young person who has taken or will take
	   LSD.
	3) Attempt to curtail distribution by putting the message  out that
	   the DEA is stepping up enforcement.

	4) Continue to promote the myths about LSD from the 60's.
	   ( no one mentioned on the show that the doses people were taking
	    in the 60's were WAY higher than today (600- 1200  mics as opposed
	    to your general dose of 100-200 mics of today)

	Let me diverge for a second.  What kind of stupid, fuck-up pice of shit
	society do we live in where John DeLorean can get caught buying
	24 kg of cocain (definitely enough lethal doses for hundreds of people)

	washing around here?

The type of editing and the shots that they choose were all designed to give
people a sense of alarm and forboding and fear, like the 60's were going to
rise up out of the grave and snatch their children away!

One good thing about all of this is that if you train yourselves to watch
television critically, you can alway see the true message come thru. In this
case the narrators made two interesting statements:

	1. if the rave scene continues to grow at it's present rate, it will
	    eclipse the "hippie" movement  within a year.

	2. At the end, she made some statement that said to the effect, LSD
	   might not be so bad if we [the establishment] had some control.

	This is the bottom line, they fear LSD because they can't CONTROL
	the reaction or the thoughts of some people who take it.
	I think they also realize the possibility of society comming face
	to faace with their fears and our situation.  Like the man who was
	an alcoholic and after one trip {they probibly gave him about 1200mics}
	decided that he didn't want to fuck his life up anymore.  We as a
	society are addicted to drugs, power, violence and domination
	what would happen if people woke up and decided not to play that game
	anymore?   When people take LSD, they realize that 
	their perceptions of reality are subjective at best. It's not too much
	of a leap of faith from "Gee if I can make that chair melt overthere"
	to "How do I know that all this stuff on TV is real" (I think Acid
	Heads created the MTV medium, I remember turning off the sound on
	the set putting music on the stereo and us all sitting down to watch
	dosed, we were initially surprised at how everything fit, now the
	society takes nonsequetors for granted.)  Americans are people that 
	have their reality molded for them by Television, if it's not shown
	on TV, It didn't happen.  When you start to take LSD, you realize that
	the emperor is buck naked.


So now Folks comes the fun part... What are we gonna DO about this.
Should we :
	1) Make our own 48 hours show and show it at raves, cable, PBS

	2) Write letters.

	3) Whine and complain amongst ourselves? (opps I mean discuss it)

	4) Do nothing (the easiest choice).

I have connections with people who are professional camerapeople I have
some access to high end video equipment and know where to get editing cheap
Anybody out there part of your local cable access, or  know a producer who
is ?

	Unfortunately this is the 90's and the revolution WILL be

I read somewhere (Shulgin, I think, but I'm not sure) that the maximum
federal sentence for illegal posession of a nuclear weapon is 12 years.
Enough lethal doses for quite a few.  

Not that a case like that would ever make it to court...probably a
good thing, too.  Still, we have wierd priorities here.

Give us white folks some credit, Geoff.  I think they did a very good job

which is ceretainly a different message than what most of america hears
about LSD.

They didn't do a very good job there.  They seemed to know and to portray that
LSD is not the same thing as crack, that just one tab will not create an 
instant addict, etc.  That part with the mothers backfired, in my mind - these
were women who took LSD and seemeed _wiser_ because of it (even though they
were shielding their kids from the very same thing, which seems a tad 
hypocritical).  Of course, when they did talk about bad trips, they should
have emphasized set and setting.

I've done editing and video production work too, and it didn't seem too 
obnoxious.  I mean, think about it - how COULD they film a rave that didn't 
make it look like it did there?  I mean, a normal video camera can't pick
up a VIBE...  I dunno.  Maybe I've just trained myself to see through camera
tricks to the point where they're meaningless to me.

I think this is a valid assumption, but it'll only be true if the culture grows
beyond just dancing all night on weekends and taking drugs.

Now this is entirely my humble opinion, but short of full legalization, I
would be in favor of creating a licensing system for drug use, exactly like
the licensing system for driving a car.  Drugs are not games, they are tools
that if used correctly can bring wonderful enlightenments and an incredible
sense of well-being, but if used improperly can really be psychologically 
devastating.  If we could have a system where people take a 6 week class which
describes EXACTLY what drugs are, their precise effects, and how to use them
PROPERLY, and then they get a license, we would greatly elimanate much of the
dangers people associate with drugs and all the hysteria.  And then you would
be free to buy drugs in a corner marketplace, where you could be sure of the
exact dosages and that it's free of contaminants.  the downside is, of course,
that it would be run by the government, but if the right individuals were in
charge (and I can name probably 10 off the top of my head who I think could
run it) I think it would work.

Yes, I definitely do - Mark Metz's Future Forum is having its first event
on Friday night that he didn't get any publicity out for until last night.
Anyways, it's at the Charter Oak warehouse (the same site as Cumulus - he's
putting the main dance floor in a much better place this time).  It's $13,
but with that you get a laminate pass that will let you into future Future 
Forum gigs (first Friday of every month) for $10.  The best part, though,
is the lineup Mark assembled: Spun, Tony, Moonpup, Garth, Bones, and James.
Hoo-weee!  

This party is mainly a fundraiser to help cover the cost of the rent - this
is actually a very cool space, and Mark has some good ideas which fleshed
out a little bit more could bmake that space a real home for the rave culture.
He's not talking about having two raves there every week, he means things
like breakfast/brunch afterparties on Sunday mornings, guest lectures by
people likle Terence McKenna and other mid-week, art projects going on, 
everything.  I highly recommend going; the only reson it wasn't in the calendar
was because Mark didn't print up the flyers until last night :)  If I were in
town I'd go...

while i appreciated 48 hours mentioning the possibility that there
might be some other side to the issue, i think geoff was right on -
the overwhelming majority of viewers will come away with the idea that
there is a New Drug Menace Threatening The Youth Of Today.  the
comments on the good it can do were largely hidden and only noticeable
if you knew what to look for.  obviously we all do.

i think you're looking at it with a liberal's eyes.  the dea dude's
comment about "they don't care about a 10 year sentence, they want the
guy shot" will have all the middle americans nodding their heads
sagely and saying "EEEEEyep.  in my day we didn't tolerate no trashy
santa cruz hippies mailing drugs, we just took 'em out into the snow,
removed their clothes, and left 'em to it."  you have to remember that
we're living in a strange microcosm that bears no resemblance to 99%

i'd like to see JUST ONCE a rave piece that didn't feature "flashy"
MTV-style camera angles and quick-cutting.  i don't run around raves
looking at it from the floor or whatever.  i walk around slowly,
checking out all the various spaces, looking at the people, smiling,

think of all the money being spent on illegal drugs.  this is a black
market economy and all the cash is changing hands without the gov't
taking a cut.  wouldn't you feel good going to the corner store
knowing that each hit of x that you buy is also contributing to the
tax base and going to programs for the homeless, schools, etc...?  i
can't believe the gov't would rather spend the billions on futile
enforcement rather than instantly putting the bad guys out of business
and raking in all the tax revenues.  shit, so-called "sin taxes" are
already incredibly high but we know what kind of lengths an addict
will go to to get his or her next coffin nail (for readers who are

not necessarily so.  don't forget the implicit assumption that for
every person who was motivated enough to get off his or her ass and

About those directions to Future Forum....  (hi, lee)

Ok so these ain't the best directions but unless someone posts better.....

Right off of 101 (about a mile south of hosptal curve on 101), is Bayshore
with a cluster of home improvement centers, etc. and a McD's.  Bayshore
runs parallel to 101 at this stretch.

You'll see a Goodman's Lumber, big and ugly - you can't miss it.  The
directions are from there.  Go to the adjacent intersection.  That will be
Industrial.  Turn left.  Go to the second block and turn right (that's 
Alameny [sp?]).  Go to the second to the last warehouse and there you are.  
It has a sign on it called "Western Dill Press" or something very similiar.  

Btw, I've not used these instructions but go them from Mark Metz.  Good
luck and I'm sure I'll see ya'll there.

CIA? I thought it stood for Cocaine Importing Agency:
think for a moment: is there any billion dollar industry in the world in 
which our government doesn't have its thumb? The thought that our 
government doesn't benefit and profit from illegal drug sales all 
over the world seems rather ludicrous to me. The reasons that drug 
dealing/posession/use is still illegal: it drives the prices up; the 
government keeps a "clean" image; the government has a stash of money 
which they can spend any way they want to, because they don't/can't lay 
claim to that money publicly; would they (ya know, the mysterious THEY)

to the brim with illegal substances that the authorities that be have 
been reposessing from "criminals" for years? If there's music in these 
wherehouses, are they called raves?

ok, ok, so I'm paranoid; but can anyone claim to know what constitutes 
a controlled substance? or an illegal one for that matter? Actually,
I'm not paranoid; I just read too much Thomas Pynchon.

I don't think Dan was being a space-case when he asked this question; 
it really was a legitimate question, because William Casey was the only 
person in the Reagan/Bush administration who could link the Iran/Contra 
affair directly to Reagan and Bush. Strangely, he died of a "brain 
anyeurism(sp?)" 3 days(I think) before he was supposed to testify.

It's a plot, I just know it!

It is also hard for me to compare myself to what is going on elsewhere.  I've
been to five raves outside of Utah and four of them sucked.  The fifth was the
first, Shamen/Moby in the Spruce Goose and people inside the scene there told
me it sucked, but I had a good time.

People here will come up to me with misleading (as opposed to Net-Truth(tm))
information regarding raves they have been to.  "Toontown was GREAT!!! There
was a guy spinning on FIVE turntables!", "I just went to a week long rave in
New York!" (when was that?), or "I've been to raves all over the world!!" and
when pressed with names they have a hard time coming up with any.  I get
afraid that people are getting sick of my slides, my laser spirographs, or any
of the standard ten or so lighting effects that we have available for rent
here (my kingdom for an Intellibeam).  Yet when you have to turn loads of
people away from one event, then they return in spades for the next one, I
guess I'm doing something right.  Yet I can't shake the feeling that much of
our audience would glorify the worst SF or NE rave.

No week-long raves in New York . . . but yes, rave hyperbole is common.
I hate to say this, but I think that it's a lot easier to think a rave
was *likE _so_ AMAZIN'* if you've had a little, ummmm, "help."  And as some 
people here have astutely pointed out, a lot of how one feels about a rave 
depends upon what is going on in your own head.  If you are out of your head 
(giggling and stripping in front of a cop?) then maybe your objective 
judgement about the quality of a given party is also affected.

I doubt they're getting sick of them.  Intellibeams should not be considered
standard rave equipment . . . you might even have fans of a certain effect,
who would be slightly less happy if you ditched something in favor of an
I-beam.  For example, I would be perfectly happy to have a really good
laser cone time and time again.  It doesn't have to be argon, it doesn't
have to be retina-frying, it just has to be there for me to dance in.
(I happen to own just such a cone-producer.  Maybe I should take the tip of
the UMD technopagans and bring my own . . . hurm.)

>Yet I can't shake the feeling that much of

"our audience" == the Utah ravers?  Maybe not.  Maybe they'd get to a bad
SF rave, notice the lack of vibe, and be bitterly disappointed.  Give them

	All of which means... it'll be too wet to have a true outdoor beach
party, but something with some sort of shelter is what's being looked for.
Besides the location that was tried last time, there's really no other place
that he or I or anyone know of.  So if ANYONE out there knows of a place that

a: could provide shelter for maybe 300 heads
b: could still allow bonfires nearby
c: has parking for hundreds of cars
d: is out of earshot of houses or roads
e: isn't sopping muddy

let me know and I'll pass it along.  The only 2 things going against the same
location is that 1) it seems to be more heavily patrolled than is comfortable,
abd 2) there's a bit of satanic grafitti on the walls (which I'll try and

I think it was more along the lines of the big pharmaceutical companies
lobbying to make high-dosage vitamins available only through prescription so
that they can jack the price up and control the players in the market. 
Eitherway, congress fell for it.  At least they told the FDA to study it for
another year before they vote on whether to put the law into effect. 
Fortuunately, the medicine side of the FDA (as opposed to the illegal drug/DEA
side of things) seems to have their heads screwed on right.

I finally get around to saying:
The attitude of "It was OK for me to do it when I was that age, 
but I now know how dangerous/unhealthy/stupid/whatever and I
feel like it should be regulated and kids that age should not
be allowed to do it!" is really an uncool attitude to have. It
is one of the reasons that I don't speak to my older sister very
much. She was of the attitude "It was OK for me to drink when I
was 18, but now that I'm older and wiser (hah I say, at least in
her case) they should not be allowed to drink until they are 21."

This attitude brings up ageism, i.e. its OK for old people to do
something, but not young people. I'm 29 and shudder at some of the
dumb things that I did 10 years ago. I'm also sure that when I
turn 39 I will shudder to think of some of the things that I have
done in the last year (e.g. drive the 1000 miles from Tijuana to 
Cabo San Lucas crazed on meth in a scant 18 hours), but I would
have rebelled at someone telling me that I can't do these things.

This attitude also is very anti-rave, anti-independent thinking 
and anti-independent actions. Look, if a kid is 13 and wants to
try LSD, why shouldn't he or she have the oppurtunity? Maybe kids
should be forced to take LSD by the time they are 13. You think 
about what LSD has done for you, and think about maybe it would have
saved you alot of the shit that you went through to get where you 
are now if you had done it earlier. (Does that make sense?)

No flames intended here. I just want to make sure everyone keeps
as open minded as possible.

damn straight.  much of the pleasure i derive from raving is seeing
the same group of hardened loonies every week.  it's better than some
anonymous club night where you walk in and feel alone in a crowd.
when you can circulate among a dancefloor and bump into familiar faces
every five minutes, it makes the event special.

of course i can have a great time at a rave where the music is top
notch and the visuals are spot on.  sometimes it's fun to be alone,
but that sense of community, of knowing that lots of people are
thinking the way you do and going to the same parties is really magic.

Sure; anything in China, nearly everything in Japan, the whole of Africa,
Russia, France (they're notoriously uncooperative with the US at most
levels), the Middle East (with Israel and Lebanon as partial but not
total exceptions).  The CIA intelligence directorate has less than
1000 agents worldwide; operations has a lot less.  Can you control the
whole wide world (even get fingers in all the pies) with perhaps 1500
people?  I don't think so.

If the US Government wants money that's untraceable, they can get it
easily enough without worrying about being involved with organized
crime or losing money to scams or legal action in the US or other
countries.  It can dissapear money in the tens of billions of dollars
a year for "Black" programs for the Air Force (mostly); I see no reason
to quibble about a billion or so that you'd gain by getting involved
in drug smuggling.  It's just not worth it.

Oh, come on.  He'd been ill (cancer) for over a year when he died.
That he died before he had to testify is poor timing, nothing more.
[What he would have testified to I refuse to speculate on; he could
well have tied a bunch of people in, or they may be innocent.  _I_
don't know, and I don't believe either side's story completely...].

If you want Raves to be accepted, stop categorizing things into
"US" and "THEM" with "THEM" being the evil government secret agencies
and their police agents.  See people who may not agree with you
as people too (I remember the police officer at the Berkeley Marina
FMR commenting that if he could dance, he'd have joined us... 8-)
Paranoia like thinking the CIA is involved in everything is silly
and leads to a mindset that makes it hard for the other side to
accept you.

Would you want the goverment to have record of your drug consumption
(frequency, dose, varieties) even if it was legal?  This information
would be recorded, you know.  You'd probably have a little magnetic
bar on your license like the new drivers licenses and credit cards.

I knew suggesting that the government might have a role in responsible drug
use would be thorny, but I was hoping to dissuade the paranoia by suggesting 
that the person in charge of the program be someone capable of doing a good
job.  And that hopefully in a few years the ideal of civil liberties would

How's that?  You're not 13.  What about 16, 18, or 21?  Doesn't it seem
more moral to have an age limit for drugs than to have either extreme:
total prohibition or total access to all at any age?

try LSD, why shouldn't he or she have the oppurtunity? Maybe kids
should be forced to take LSD by the time they are 13. You think 
about what LSD has done for you, and think about maybe it would have
saved you alot of the shit that you went through to get where you 
are now if you had done it earlier. (Does that make sense?)

No flames intended here. I just want to make sure everyone keeps
as open minded as possible.

Then I get around to responding:
I meant to only agree with Jon on the part about: 

>this part i agree with - it should be mandatory.  mandatory sex and
>drug education for all schoolkids.  the thought of 13 year olds even
CONTEMPLATING dropping acid filled me with horror.

but not this part:
you're just NOT ready for it at that age - i don't care how
precocious you are.  i took my first trip at age 18 and it was
pretty nightmarish.

AND IN MY DEFENSE I MIGHT ADD:

Too many words and attitudes in my mouth to even rebutt,
but I did not say: "It was OK for me to do it when I
was that age, but I now know how dangerous/unhealthy/stupid/
whatever and I feel like it should be regulated and kids that
age should not be allowed to do it!" and I apologise if I came
off that way.  But, I did say that I wouldn't recomend it which
is not to say that I would recomend not doing it.  I wouldn't
give absolute advice about this to someone, just information.
And about the ageism.  Knives are great tools, usualy used
harmlessly for good, legitimate purposes but I don't let my
2 yr. old play with them.  Age = Experience = Capability
You have to draw the line somewhere.  Many 13 yr. olds couldn't
cope with tripping but I did fine and I don't know what the
applicable psychelogical factors are or how to describe them but
if anyone can inform the rest of us please do.

Subject: I'm back

Hi all, and hope your holidays were good ones. Since I'm back in town (which
feels good because I haven't punched deck in three weeks) I'd like to get
back on the list to fill my new year with good vibes and good cheer. While I
was in Tampa, I got to spin records at 911 on Cass ave, billed as DJ Cyber,
special guest DJ from Detroit. The Tampa club scene is cool, but most of the
music they call "techno" has, within every track, a nice place to put
something like "Ladies with an attitude..." On the positive side, Theyre
really into that amphetamine driven rub-a-dub 150 bpm breakbeat stuff like
Sapho and Force X. That dovetailed nicely with the Detroit hardcore
laserblast I gave them during my s
set. (Sorry)
happy Anno Novum.

Subject: conspiracies, a  funny, funny joke

This is long, and there actually is information/questions regarding both
the rave scene and sfraves towards the bottom. You might want to skip 
down to the bottom in order to miss all the conspiracy theory stuff
that's mostly meant for George. Try starting with the paragraph "|Paranoia,
like thinking the CIA..."


george writes:
|Sure; anything in China, nearly everything in Japan, the whole of Africa,
|Russia, France (they're notoriously uncooperative with the US at most
|levels), the Middle East (with Israel and Lebanon as partial but not
|total exceptions).  The CIA intelligence directorate has less than
|1000 agents worldwide; operations has a lot less.  Can you control the
|whole wide world (even get fingers in all the pies) with perhaps 1500
|people?  I don't think so.

I agree, but, on the other hand, I know some people who actually 
aspire, get this, to be bad cops; ya know, the ones who confiscate drugs 
only to sell them back to the "delears" at a profit. I think this kind of 
thing happens at various levels of the government, but I agree that it 
probably doesn't happen in any organized, collective manner.

|If the US Government wants money that's untraceable, they can get it
|easily enough without worrying about being involved with organized
|crime or losing money to scams or legal action in the US or other
|countries.  It can dissapear money in the tens of billions of dollars
|a year for "Black" programs for the Air Force (mostly); I see no reason
|to quibble about a billion or so that you'd gain by getting involved
|in drug smuggling.  It's just not worth it.

I'm not sure that a billion isn't worth it, but I could be wrong.

|Oh, come on.  He'd been ill (cancer) for over a year when he died.
|That he died before he had to testify is poor timing, nothing more.
|[What he would have testified to I refuse to speculate on; he could
|well have tied a bunch of people in, or they may be innocent.  _I_
|don't know, and I don't believe either side's story completely...].

I don't believe either side's story completely either. It's just that
I can't remember anyone mentioning Casey's illness until after he was
dead. It wouldn't be the first time that I was misinformed, either way.

BTW, I guess sarcasm and self-parody don't translate very well over 
the net. "IT's a plot; I just know it" was an obviously failed attempt
at self-mockery; tongue in cheek; the whole bit; oh, well...

"because they don't/can't lay claim to that money publicly; would they 
(ya know, the mysterious THEY)want to?"

here, again, I was attempting to acknowledge the absurdity or, at least,
the limitations of the language that I chose to use. I don't really 
believe in the whole "US" and "THEM" categorical trap, myself.

|See people who may not agree with you as people too...

I rarely agree with myself, and (while I sometimes can manage to see 
myself as a person rather than as an object, as I've been trained) I am 
usually the only target of my own inhumane system of beliefs and/or 
behaviors.

As for conspiracies, I do think that there are conspiracies, but I 
think they are very subtle, and, thus, all the more powerful. I wrote
the following in response to Pete's comment (it's at the top).
___________________________________________________________________________
>Read any alt.conspiracy.jfk recently? :-)

historical metafiction; I just love it! Actually, I don't 
read alt.conspiracy.jfk. As for paranoid delusions, what can you 
expect from an ex-anorexic? Standing at 5'4'' and weighing in at
105 lbs., I have to ask myself: Am I really fat? or is there a 
subliminal conspiracy going on that encourages me to believe 
I'm fat? If I answer "yes" to the first question, I starve. I 
can't change the way I feel (though I'm working at it). Whenever 
I eat, I feel fat; not satisfied, but fat. So, I go back and 
forth from hungry to fat. I also am constantly making a mental
log of what I've already eaten and what I can therefore allow myself
to eat in the future. My question is: how did I come to waste so
much time on this?

Did you know that models are 27% thinner than the average 
woman? And did you know that anorexia and bulemia are the two
mental disorders with _THE_ highest fatality rate in this country?
And, did you know that somewhere between 1/3-1/5 of women on
college campuses suffer from one of these two disorders, if not both?
sounds like a conspiracy to me!

women's liberation movement, my ass!

I don't mean for you to worry about me personally, I
just like to raise awareness about these diseases whenever and 
wherever I can, because so many people are dying and nothing's
being said about it.

Jocelyn

P.s. Did you know that ALL of the research money for breast 
cancer (the #1 killer of women in the US) was granted to, yep,
you guessed it, the military? Yes, the military is in charge of
breast cancer research now. (It's things like this that make me 
feel a little uneasy).
__________________________________________________________________

Well- that was the letter I sent to Pete- who knows maybe the 
military is really interested in saving women's lives, or, if 
not their lives, then their breasts.

As far as believing in conspiracies goes, well... I 
guess I feel that I've inflicted enough self-hatred
on myself; and I need to put some distance between me and the
disease by blaming the "powers that be" before I can 
face what _I_ did to myself. When I think
about it, I get so angry I could just kick myself, yeah, like I 
really need to be doing that.

|Paranoia like thinking the CIA is involved in everything is silly
|and leads to a mindset that makes it hard for the other side to
|accept you.

Unfortunately, George, the other side, whichever side that is,
 _WILL_ accept me, and you wanna know why:  because I'm thin, and 
young, and pretty, and even though I'm vain, I'm still a pretty nice 
person; and people in our society are trained to take people 
at face value. The extent to which the rave scene is an exception 
to this rule, I'm not quite sure... 

I'll agree that it's better than most "scenes" when it comes to 
refraining from objectifying women, and objectifying people in general; 
but then again; when someone posted that Smokin Jo, the female Gautelier 
model turned DJ, would be spinning, there was still a bit of crap about 
drool on the floor; and those things were posted on sfraves. I didn't 
say anything at the time, but I was kind of put-off by that.

BTW, have you ever noticed the ratio of males/females that post in this 
newsgroup? I know I'm the only woman who posted anything today. Why? Ladies?

Well, anyway, I remain-

Jocelyn

more later, when I can/am inspired to, about Gathering Hits and bare chests
and whores, 48 to be exact...

Subject: 48 Whores Revisited

Hi again folx!

I pot on the very first of the responses to
"48 Whores" with that very tag line last night--
and I was somewhat disappointed that apparently noone
recognized the dark sarcasm of my message!  Brian
even seemed to be [Cpleasantly in agreement with what
he thought was my point of view about the program being
more positive than he expected!  That was *not* my
point of view at all!  When I wrote

I think it's really kewl the way they are so much more            
balanced and perceptive than they were in the 60s!  I            
think the young people they showed are 100% typical of
the folx I've met at the raves I've gone to, don't
you?  And the values of "Just Say Know" were veritably 
hanging from Dan Rather's liberal lips, weren't
they? Etc.

I hoped the sarcasm was evident, but I guess I hoped too
much!

I agree with much of what Geoff W says, and I'm sorry
that his incisive comments brought such a rush of
naive defensive responses! And then this:


>this part i agree with - it should be mandatory.  mandatory
sex and
>drug education for all schoolkids.  the thought of 13 year

CONTEMPLATING dropping acid filled me with horror.  you're
just NOT
ready for it at that age - i don't care how precocious you
are.  i
took my first trip at age 18 and it was pretty nightmarish.


As a public school high school teacher for 33 years, seeing the
perfectly dreadful scare and hellfire drug education we've
had a nd still have, how patently deceitful it is to
even the least hip kids, this made me absolutely cringe!
Where have you folx been?  Bosnia rathjer than California?
Let's wake up and try to have some more thoughtful
consideration of what CBS hath wrought!

Well, Will, I picked up on the dark sarcasm and am in total
resonance with it.

In my 1.5 years of raving I've never met anyone as unrepresentative
of ravers as those two kids they spotlighted in the beginning.  They
must have gone far out of their way to find kids that vapid and 
ludicrous.  This was exactly the hatchet job most of us suspected
they were up to.  It wouldn't have mattered how eloquently we
described the positive aspects of the scene if they had interviewed
us; it would have ended up on the cutting room floor.

Although I don't have any illusions about the mass media, still I
was shocked at how blatently manipulative this program was.  Geoff's
comments about editing and camera-angles were right on target.

On the subject of 13 year olds -- I actually don't think kids that
young are ready to handle any type of mind-altering substances (least
of all alcohol) but I think the type of hysterical Nancy Reagan
propaganda that they're getting can only be counter-productive.
Damned if I know what the alternative is, though...

At any rate, it's clear to me that 48 Hours has about as much to
do with serious journalism as Barry Manilow has to do with Miles Davis...

*sigh*.  

okay, so maybe I read Will's post so quickly I missed the sarcasm.  but hey,
one can only read 150 email messages so carefully.  

my basic point, and I won't elaborate any more, was that overall, I thought
they did a MUCH better job than they could have.  Yes, the rave part was 
disgusting - my fault for missing half of that and failing to have it make
my evaluation of the show lower.  But when they mentioned treatment of
alcoholics and the cia experiments, one would have had to scrape my jaw off
the ground, I was so surprised.  But hell, I hated English because I would
always find my own meanings in the classics we were forced to read, and even 
though I could support them with facts I was constantly told I was wrong.  So
maybe my evaluation of 48 hours was overly optimistic because I chose to
ignore certain things they said and got too excited when they mentioned other.jbf77ss7v	Brian

Subject: the REAL reason drugs are illegal


TAXI here,

ok about 4 months ago I posed a question to sfraves about what you thought the
real reason drugs are illegal.  I got plenty of replies from folks.  Following
is a synopsis of people's answers.  Rather than marveling at the fact that LSD
dealers get 10 years with no parole, and plenty of murderers, robbers, and 
theives get less time with parole, maybe it would help if you understood the 
system, the overall picture.  It is my belief that in every situation where 
love is not involved, people in power can stand to lose something.  In the
US, I believe this includes almost every single institution.

the real reasons drugs are illegal:  This is almost taken word for word from
Niel's reply (thanks Niels!) to my question 4 months ago.  A few points
have been added by me and others who I will attribute by putting in [].  Those
who sent me an answer in private will be attributed anonymously.

1)  People would stop buying tobacco and alcohol -- an area where established
    power and the $$$ that goes with that has set and controlled government
    policy [via lobbying or other means.]  [Niels]  The reason pot was made 
    illegal was because the big timber companies
    had new ways of processing trees/wood into paper [in the beginning of this
    century?] and as long as hemp was available (better product, cheaper to 
    produce hemp paper) no one would buy wood paper.  Hemp was also in direct
    competition with cotton (for fabrics) and tabacco -- two other major power
    blocks earlier in this century [b].

2)  the CIA, who happens to be the biggest upper level drug dealer in the US,
    wants the drugs illegal to keep the prices of drugs artificially high to
    maximize their profits to finance covert operations in order to destabilize
    independent or anti-US governments.
        *  Before and during the Vietnam war, it was heroin.
        *  For the Contra in Nicaragua it's been cocaine. 
        *  According to the documentary, "Panama deception" there is more 
           cocaine flowing through Panama now than when Noreiga was in power
           there.  And the US military/CIA is basically running Panama now.
           Isn't that strange that Noriega was removed according to Bush, 
           to stop the flow of drugs through Panama and now there's more 
           cocaine flowing through it? [taxi]

3)  Creating the "problem" ensures employment and funding for the "solution"
    the police, the military, the FBI.  Is it any wonder that Colin Powell
    says that there will be no peace dividend from ending the cold war because
    we have a war on drugs to fight?! [Niels]  So, now that the Soviet threat
    is no-longer a major threat, the people in power had to find a new large
    intangible sorce of fear to justify the money they spend on military and
    domestic oppression.  Their answer was the "war on drugs".  The reason
    they don't let sick people smoke pot is in order for the drug hysteria to
    work, they have to convince people that all illegal drugs are bad.  We 
    spend millions of dollars each year screening our borders with 
    sophisticated air and land based radar systems and last year [91] they
    did not catch one drug smuggler!  NOT ONE!  [a]

4)  Because the "war on drugs" takes peoples' attention away from the criminal
    actions of our own government.  Bush wouldn't want the smoke to clear 
    enough for people to realize that he was overseeing S&L deregulation during
    Reagan's presidency or his role in Ocotber surprise.... or his dealings 
    with Saddam Hussein to leverage a victory in Iran, or his dealings with the
    Iran contra scanal, or his dealings with Noriega while Bush was head of 
    CIA.

5)  The prison system is a thriving business.  I believe I read in the 
    SF Chronicle that it costs California $18,000 per prisoner per year.  The
    California prison employees union has one of the strongest lobbies in
    California.  The more prisoners they have, the more prison employees the
    state must hire which is what the union would like: to increase in size
    so they can have even more political power.  More prisoners means more 
    prisons and the system starts to spiral on its own.   Also, prison
    labor is almost free.  California has the highest return rate for 
    prisoners in the country.  California has set up it's laws so that it is
    extremely easy for an ex-prisoner to return.  Also, the law enforcement
    unions have  extremely powerful lobbies in California.  Ever wonder why
    the governor said he would cut education but would increase spending in
    the area of public safety?  [taxi]

6)  Racism plays a part according to a few replies I got.  It goes something
    like this:  since most low level drug dealers are African American, make
    the laws really harsh for drug dealers so as to incarcerate the highest
    number of young African American males possible.  The prison return rate
    in California for young African American males is 70%, if my memory
    serves me correctly.  Also another startling stat: one out of every 4
    young African American males (I forgot the precise age range) has either
    been arrested, is in prison, has a police record, or is in some stage
    of incarceration.  THis is for California.  Basically, overt racism has 
    subsided since the 1960's but subtle, very subtle, but very effective
    forms of racism has replaced the obviously overt form to a certain extent.

7)  Drugs like Acid and possibly E often promote free thinking.  Citizens of
    this country are harder to control by the powers that be if they were to
    become free thinkers.  It would mean a loss of power to the law enforcement
    institutions, capitalist corporations who would like to "chide" citizens
    to buy their products, the advertising instition, the organized religious
    institutions, the mass media institutions, the governmental instutions.  A
    lot of people in the upper 
    echelons of American society stand to lose a lot if Americans in general 
    became a free thinking people.  And the American public in general believe
    the scare tactics that the media pushes on them about drugs.  The 
    opportunity for citizens to develop a free thinking attitude is too much
    for the powers that be.  Thus every single institution mentioned above is
    against the use of LSD.  (I want to stress here though that taking LSD is
    just one of the many different ways to spark free thinking - it definitely
    can be done in non-drug ways also.)

So there you have it.  I'm not going to back this up in any way.  Flames are
welcome but keep them off the list.  Also, I probably forgot some other real
reasons drugs are illegal but this is the jist of it from the replies I got.

2 bits from where Santa Clause lives:

Hearing talk about the government controlling drugs freaks me out, sounds
like "Brave new World" where the state gave the people "Samorfia" or
something to keep them happy.

I heard that in the UK, when there are riots in the gettos, the government
relaxes the clamp down on drugs, til things calm down.

I think I'd rather have illegal drugs than government controlled.

Hi MykL--

Thanks for your sensible and sensitive responses!
I find your most provocative line the following:

Damned if I know what the alternative is, though.

That's what I've found so fulfilling as a teacher/
learner during my life! I sure as hell know it
isn't hysteria, anxiety, and fear--the fuels that
48 Hours was feeding up in massive doses over
LSD.  I think one of the first, best and most sig-
nificant questions is: why LSD?  Why, still, this
massive shot at what, compared to alcohol and cigarettes,
is minutiae?  I suggest that LSD *isn't* minutiae,
the power/media structure knows it, and they're out
full force, furious, and somewhat frenzied because
it's out of *their* control--as are those who have
been educated by it.  Far out?  Sure--but less far
out than the CIA's acid dreams about political control
of commies via LSD!

> What is an Intellibeam? Does it differ from green lasers? 

An Intellibeam is that four foot long silver box that you'll see at most
concerts and some raves.  It has a spot mirror at the top and the gobos,
filters and lights are contained within.  It is highly programmable, very
quick to change colors/patterns/intensity, and is just about the top of the
line when it comes to special effects lights.  I believe each Intellibeam runs
about $6000 and the controller for them runs $4000.

I was referring here to anecdotal information passed down by word of
mouth, much as various ancient legends, myths, and folk songs continue
to exist today.

It seems, from my very limited research, that within every LSD using
community, such a thing exists.  I've seen written versions at various
locations, but generally it's a word of mouth type of thing, and it
tends to be very short and basic.  Of course the contents vary by
location but generally it's more of a "10 things to do to make sure
you have a good trip" and "fun (but relatively safe) things to try
once complete derangement of the senses doesn't twist yer knobs
anymore" rather than some large exhaustive document.

If anyone would like me to try to get written transcription of this
stuff, just holler.  It might take some effort, I'm not sure how many
of the various members of the various communities are still around and
able to be contacted.

no.  total access to all at any age is the only way to go.  as soon as

only sensible path.

Subject: FMR... jeeeeeeez.....


I hate the rain.  I really really do.  I think it's probably one of the main
reasons so many Brits moved out here....

So anyways, as was probably expected, the cops came and decided to shut it down
around 3:30, about an hour and a half after it was really going.  Spun had 
played a pretty good technofunk set and I was dancing like a fool completely
unAltEred.  They had just set up the Wicked sound system when the cops appeared
at the door (called by reports of "excessive traffic"), and shined their
flashlights inward.  There was some talk about "if you wanna leave, leave now,
otherwise you're in for good" or something like that, which raised the image
of that disastrous Grave rave in Milwaukee (where every ravegoer was arrested
and ticketed - charges were eventually dropped).  And then they opened a huge
garage door and everyone filed out.  I felt REALLY bad at this point because
Bryan and Dana and Joachim had drivin up a day early just to go to one of the
"legendary" Full Moon Raves, and here is was busted.  We hung around to help
load the sound equipment into the van, and word spread around that it would be
taken over to the bowling alley at 4th and Gish.  We headed over there, and
waited with about 100 other intrepid souls.  At about quarter to 5 it became
obvious that the sound van was not going to show up, so we all left, very much
depressed from the night's happenings.

I'm also slightly pissed.  I'm beginning to get the feeling that Allen and the
rest of the FMR organizers are beginning to get a little lazy, and beginning
to rely on our fanatical devotion to the FMR's a little too much.  For one thing,
I would have never decided to have it in the middle of Santa Clara - way too
obvious. :(  Yeah, it was probably the best place he could come up with, but
he sure didn't put TOO much effort into looking.  The bunkers would probably
have worked that night....  I'm still kinda wondering if the cops are in the
phone tree somewhere and find out about them the way we all do, and are pro-
active in trying to shut them down.  The only way to tell would be to try a
map point, but Allen didn't want to do that.  Aarg.

Wow, the sun's actually poking through the clouds on my computer right now.
Cruel joke.

Oh, and on the way home I skidded my car into a freeway guardrail in San Jose.
No one was hurt, not too much damage, but the car had to be towed.  So my 
raving quotient over the next few months will probably be drastically lower...
The skid was due to trying to slow down on an incredibly evil combination of
slick pavement and mud so that I could make an off-ramp.

Ah well, these setbacks can only make anticipation for the next one increase.

	1992 has been a year full of change.  the House Community in the
Bay Area has grown both in numbers and intensity.  At the same time, there 
have been increasing efforts to sensationalize and commercialise house parties,
and to stamp them out of existance.

	For 1993, our strength and hope lies in the fact that through all
the misunderstandings and misinformation, we remain true to our original
ideas, that we can share a time and place where we can come together in the
spirit of love, music and dance; to experience the power that we have, both
individually and collectively, to do, create, build, or to be anything we 
desire;  that we have the ability to look beyond the myriad of reasons that
society gives us to separate and segregate ourselves into different groups,
to see the importance of the common bond of humanity that brings us together.

	It is in this spirit of togetherness that we ask you to join us for
the first FOUNDATION along with DJs ENZO, E.J., DORAN, JOSH,TONY and GARTH.
United, we will lay a foundation of positive energy, focus, and direction 
in 1993.  We hope to see you on January 9 [my birthday!- geoffw] - until

Sorry I have a tendency to post only when I want to argue with something
but a bit of passion, so to speak, gets me going on this one....

In watching sfraves for the many months that I've been on, I've come to
somewhat know and respect the intelligence and sensibilities of the 
individuals who make up this community.  And although I from time to time
disagree with some of the issues, the ideas espoused by this current thread
on the military-industrial complex being involved in a world-wide 
conspiracy to control and oppress the masses through every means of mani-
pulation known to those power-brokers in bunk.  According to the thread, 
the CIA, major industries, various parts of the federal government,
the state government and labor (as represented by unions) have enacted and 
systematically use laws regarding drug policy to profit, imprison, oppress
and impair the free thinking of the ordinary citizens.  Sorry, but I don't
think so. 

Btw, I'm currently being targetted by the US government and most of the 
Fortune 500 for execution.  It first started by training of the masses,
by way of organized religion, to hate "homosexuals".  Next, they enacted
and systematically used laws to discriminate against us in housing, employ-
ment and so forth.  But that wasn't enough, they had to kill us.  So several
government organizations and the federal government started experimenting 
with biological warfare weapons and created what is now known as AIDS to 
destroy the homosexuals.  It didn't stop there.  The government and industry
have now banned together to ensure that a cure is not found and that the 
few thousand dollars they do spend for research is really for other things.
So, in short, everything that is wrong is not due to me or society as a whole 
or even circumstance but the government and those evil corporations plotting 
against us.  As a result, educating society away from ignorance and hate 
and targetting the media as the perpetuators of the social status quo and worse
is a completely futile activity.  It's that intelligent, nimble, evil,
well-coordinated, plotting military-industrial complex that's at fault.

Sorry for the sarcasm, but it's not my fault: I come from a dysfunctional
family.

Actualy, I'd bet we have spys in every one of the above mentioned
countries and as for Africa, looks what's going on now.

The world's a small place (big but small).  With a hierarchy of power, 
lots of power, I could see the CIA (or members of) trying to control
the world with moderate success and more than occasional screw-ups
(Iran-Contra, failed assasanation attempt on Castro, etc.).  It's not
some big everyone in goverment is involved and cooperates together
conspiracy.  I believe it's a secret group bent on world control that
gets off on being who they are and working above the laws, self-justified
because they think that what they are doing is good and necessary and
profitable.  It's a big monopoly game.

The Black budget is a budget though.  They just don't tell us how much
and what specificly for but we know it's for aircraft and weapons
development and we know it exists as an official government program.
When your freelancing world control and your not doing it officialy or
legaly but you have the power and you need more money, you do what you can,
including drug trafficking.  Did we all forget Iran-Contra (or did we just
never know)?  Those were desperate powerful government agents selling
arms and trafficking drugs for money that wouldn't technicly exitst to
give to an army that we wanted to win because congress decided not to 
officialy give them money anymore.

Again, I'm not (neccecarily) talking about a recognized government agencey,

organization.  Figureheads of power that can control CIA operatives and
other crooks for their own motives.

I agree.  It's very dangerous to believe everything is "us" and "them".
It's not that cut and dried.  If "we" ever find out who "they"
are we should kill "them".  "They" are responsible for everything from
not fixing pot-holes in the streets to assasinating world leaders.

Ya, but since nothing is beyond them it's hard to know which things
they are and aren't involved with.  I'm sure we can't even imagine 
it all.  If any one of us could know everything in Geroge Bush's
head (after all, he's a rich oil man with lots of ties, part of secret
societies, ex head of the CIA, and pres) I bet we'd flip.  I bet you'd
think "I've only imagined it was this corrupt and inter-twined but never
realy, realy new that it could possibly be like this."  

I used to think people like me were paranoid too, honestly. 

Does anyone listen to flashpoints on KPFA (94.1)?  It's on at 5:00 p.m. or
5:30 p.m. everyday.  It's realy good interviews with very knowledgable and
reliable sources such as Fed judges, reporters, etc. and it exposes alot of 
government corruption and stuff.  You want to think paranoid?  Just listen
to it.  I'm serious, they have all the good paranoid rants with facts to
back it up.   Maybe it is just coincidence that african swine feaver is
geneticly close to aids and was released by the CIA on the pig herd in Cuba 
which is near Haiti wear AIDS started.  But your being close minded if you
don't at least give it consideration because you can't imagine our government
or people doing something like this to others.

the quote is almost verbatim from the book, and had nothing to do with

The true conspiracy lover should listen to Dave Emory's "One Step Beyond" which
used to be on KFJC SUnday nights, unsure if still is, wonderful, frightning,
informative stuff.  Once listened to 10 hours of tapes on the creation of AIDS
during a trip from San Jose to Portland Oregon

On a more cheerful note, a buddy and I are going to go through the Viacom
workshop on cable access production.  If you have no idea what I'm talking
about, you should check out Viacom Channel 25 in SF, public access and home of
the wierdest TV you will ever see.

We are thinking about doing a half hour, twice a month show, and are looking
for feedback as to what people would like to see on TV, yet never have.  The
only limits, I think, are "no commercial use" (the biggie), no graphic sex acts
(I think) and no live on screen drug use, although can be part of a tape
roll-in (taped action).  No commercial use seems to be the biggie, as I've seen
both drug use and sex acts on channel 25.  Any ideas?

We were definately thinking of rave footage, as well as live bands/mixing

I've always had a problem with this "objectifying" thing.  I don't/
wouldn't feel this way when people talk about my body, I'd be flattered.
Who says that to admire and even crave another persons body for sex
"objectifies"?   Actualy, I know who says it:  everybody.  I've 
never seen anyone contest it so here I am.  I can want to FUCK (I can
even use crude language in reference to a beautiful loving and
reproductive act for shock value) a girl without loosing any respect
or thinking any less of her as a person even if I don't want a 
relationship with her.  In fact quite the contrary, usually, because
if I'm intrigued by her body I'm at least as intrigued by her.  I can
even talk about druling and all sorts of stupid/funny little descriptions,
all the while knowing that this is a person.  Remember the talk about
Dr. Forrenzi's (or whatever her name is) Spheres a while back?  That
could be considered "objectifying" but all the while everybody on this
list knew that she was very smart AND talented and anyone who knows
about her probably respects or even looks up to her.  I think that one
of the biggest problems with sexism and racism is knowing when it is or
isn't occuring. 

What's the actual difference between:

This girl at the Gathering had no bra and a see-through shirt, beautiful
breasts, and it was very erotic.  

OR

This chick at the Gathering had a see-through shirt so that I could see
her rad tits and I was drooling.


I know one sounds worse, but is there realy a difference?
This is a het-male perspective but I don't see why the wording can't
be changed to fit your sex/sex pref.


Am I just weird and I'm the only person who can separate sexualy
descriptive language about another person form degredation?

hi folx!
i know, this is not quite rave-related, but after i responded to jocelyn,
i saw this last messg. on kpfa and their discussions on the undeside of
us politix. i think some folx are unwilling to consider some issues regarding
cia and drug-trafficking, s&l, iran-contra stuff as 'real' because, as
liberal-minded , 'rational' people, we might find it hard to believe that
our leaders would stoop this low to achieve their ends. only 'ignorant',
'uneducated' people believe stuff like that. not us! but maybe, just
MAYBE, reality is not what we think ! huh ? i mean, do people really think
that we live in a representative democratic country ? yet we tell ourselves
that over and over, don't we ? maybe it might be too painful to confront the
reality we do live in, because is too far removed from what we thought we
lived in. these events might be those little things which cracked through
our hard shell of denial from the underside of our political reality.
yet i think the  trick is to get these folx away from their power games
and into the mind-expansion, INCLUSIVE games. change by absorbtion rather

In-Reply-To: winston@lurnix.com -- 01/08/93 14:43

hi mark, folx!
i think that the problem with sexism is that when we ( i.e. men, mostly )
 express our appreciation of women solely of the physical level we limit,
or objectify women. if i would say ' that woman is really sexy and i would
really like to have sex with her AND would like to know her and her thoughts,'
that is probably more what some of us think , but don't say. of course,
sometime we are just attracted to the physical aspect and don't care about
the rest : 'boy, she's a real dish, i'd really like to fuck her.'
it seems to me that we usally say/think the latter and hardly ever the
former. if that is the case, then we are sexists. and it is too bad because
we miss on the opportunity to get to know another human being on several
levels, which i think is more exciting than just on one (physical).

Yes on both counts.
I died in 1986 and again in 1988, self-administered both times.

What you need to do is make some (many) brownies, then smoke
all you can, then eat the brownies, then smoke a couple of pounds
of hi-grade hash.  Wash it all down with bacardi 151, straight.

When you wake up, you should be quite dead.

I think the six-pack was a bad analogy, but I see your point.  Kids
want to get a sixer 'cause they wanna get fucked up.  Smoking, on the
other hand, is purely to look cool.  But there's lots of things that
kids shouldn't do, like driving and sex (for children), signing contracts,
etc, that shouldn't be restricted for the entire population.  As
an adult you're expected to be responsible for your actions, so you should
have the freedom to do as you wish including taking drugs.  But there
is an "age" for each person that before that it is irresponsible to allow
that person to do certain things.

i think that a good in-between point is to say that anything dangerous
(grown-ups get to decide what those thing are) should be only open to
adults (18, or whatever) to do legally.  as long as you're not hurting
anyone else, and you have enough experience under your belt to know
when something is right or wrong, what's the harm. 

there will be cases where kids are ready for some activity earlier than
other kids, and cases when 30 year olds aren't mature enough to drink.
unfortunately, i think this is probably a case where some restrictions
should apply.

[ it would be nice if parents took this responsibility, but in our day,
age, society, parents rarely have the foresight to do this, and where
they do, they are prepared, equipped or well-informed enough to do so. :( ]

begin -mark. (me):

this is something that i've ALWAYS felt, but ya know what?  (and this is not
meant as a sexist flame in any way...it _is_ a generalization, but i would
not use it if i hadn't actually experienced it...) every time i have said
this to a girl, i get responses like, "yeah right," or "don't act stupid."
now, mind you, this is usually talking to my sister (who's actually a
real sweetie) and her friends, and i'm usually the only guy there.  but
i haven't had a positive response with girls.

==balanced, two-sided view==

on the other hand, consider being a girl, an attractive girl (in our society's
terms) and having this happen ALL THE TIME.  it would start to get pretty
annoying after a while.  and since it's such an animalistic response (i'm
not putting down animalisticness...possibly more on that later ;) anyone is
capable of it.  which means everyone will do it, which means that after a
while (maybe not too long) it will get REAL old.  consider this:  yes, i get
stoked when girls look at me and i know that they like what they see.  and
no, this doesn't happen every two-and-a-half minutes.  but let's just say
that EVERY girl (or almost every girl...:) expressed what they were thinking
by feeling out my butt or gawking or staring...after a while, that would 
start to gross me out (even now it does SOMEtimes [not often, it's usually
taken as a compliment, even if i'm not interested...]) and girls that didn't
show any interest and thought up novel and "tasteful" (<-- relative word
usage, sorry) things to do and say to get my attention would be more attractive
than the others. BUT,

==balance coming into play again==

that doesn't mean (IMHO) that there's anything wrong with animal libido taking
over and it's real rad when two people can just go "oh that boy/girl is rad!!"
and the other one's thinking "i want that boy/girl" and they melt and grind
and everything is cool.  some people would have this done away with. 8(
not me.  the thing if you're making someone feel uncomfortable by looking at
them, you probably are doing something wrong

==balance getting really out of control==

then again, maybe THEY are infringing upon YOUR rights by being too prudish
about the way they function in society... (?)  it's a hard call, but for the
most part i agree with Mark.

Nope. Officialy there is no record of anyone ever dying from pot.
Most cops, right-wingers, and other responsible nazi folk still insist that
it can be a lethal drug. There are people who have died while on pot AND alcohol
but, that was the alcohol, a poison to the system.
The only lab animals that I know of to die from pot were lab monkeys that were
put in a sealed compartment (no airholes) and subjected to breathing smoke
from a burning mass of hemp fed in through a pipe at the top of the container.
the smoke had no where to go, and just sat there. The monkeys died twenty-
something hours into the experiment. If they died from anything, it was
suffocation. This experiment was rejected by most science people, most of which
compared it to sucking on your car's tailpipe for fifteen hour straight.
This experiment was Reagan and Bush's (among others) excuse to declare war
on hemp.
I don't remember the specific name of the experiment, but it is quotesd through-
out the former (yeah) administration's papers on the war on pot.
Bullshit basically...hmmm...did I make myself clear?

But the stuff's still shit for your lungs....so use a water bong!

true, i do agree that kids at that age would be capable (maybe more so) of
handling "stuff," whether it be war, or LSD, or beer, etc.  but first of
all, we in america have been brought up a certain way.  not sayin it's da
best, but it's what we got.  now take a 13 year old _american_ kid.  he may
not have any idea what LSD really is, but want to try it anyway, based on
what he _thinks_ it is.  all of a sudden he doesn't know what to do or where
to turn.  that scares me.  now, if s/he'd been properly educated, and there
was someone to help him through, teach him/her the dangers, etc.  i believe
that's a totally different story.


and good point about mothering.  i mean why are girls even _able_ to re-

Your right.  If it were that organized and wide spread we'd all be up shit
creek.  But if you don't believe that there are people in power with these
goals take another look at society.  This stuff happened biblicly, in 
Rome's heydey and thereafter, Nazi germany, etc.  Many people like to control
other people and the problem is that these are the kinds of people that because
of their nature seek government positions.  The less aspiring, but excitement
loving ones become cops (both of those last sentences are gross generalizations
but true enough for this thread).  If you think that that aspect of some
Human's nature changed and this kind of stuff stopped after WWII, think again.
Why would it?

No, orgnaized religion already hated homosexuals.  Bigotry, just another

Your right again.  I don't think it's that organized, that the intent of
AIDS was to target homosexuals, etc. and it's easy and fun to mock this
kind of paranoia but don't let that turn you off to the basic ideas.
There is strong evidence that AIDS was geneticly manufactured, though
probably not for the purpose of killing homosexuals.  Ever hear of Plum

No, and would you care to cite any of this "strong evidence?" Based on
a discussion of this idea in alt.folklore.urban (!) several months ago,
I find it hard to let this statement lie.

On an alt.drug thread a bit ago, the concluding consensus was that there

Apparently the guy overdid a few times over (probably a scene from a Cheech

plum island is an island off the coast of ny where they do bio level

they've been cited a million times in my recognition, but they're
very hush hush, and haven't been shut down

i don't know what they're connection to AIDS is.

any furthermore, they back diagnosed a person who died in 1959 as
having AIDS in england. so while, it might have been engineered, the
story is more complicated than plum island. and they did some sort

Yes, the origional American Flag, "Old Gory, er, Glory" was made of hemp. It was
also sewn by Betsy Ross, a black friend of Benjamin Franklin, a known hemp
farmer and smoker ( He supposedly wrote a paper on the benifits of hemp, which
was probably destroyed by the Reagan/Bush Nazi's from the National Archives in
one of the many information censorship purges ) George Washington also grew hemp
Many copies and drafts of many "important American documents" were printed on
help paper (Which explains the excellent physical condition of these documents
in modern times) as were most bibles from that era. 
	If you ask the folks at any government office, though, they'll tell
er, rather, they have been instructed to tell you that the above are printed
on "linen", a general catchall term for any fabric made from plants.

Have Fun,

Unlikely from Polio research.  HIV is genetically evolved from
(it appears) the SIV or Simian Immunodefeciency Virus, which isn't
as destructive to apes as HIV is to humans.  It's fairly easy to see
SIV crossing over from an ape in africa (or monkey, which are eaten
and kept as pets in various parts of africa) into humans, but SIV
also doesn't infect humans (usually) and HIV won't infect apes, so
nobody quite knows how the transfer took place.  SIV is natural,
as far as anyone can tell.

Also, the mutations to SIV that made it HIV are "wierd", in some
senses, which has attracted some interest, but there are a lot
of totally natural things that are equally as wierd.  What does
this mean?  I dunno.

This quote showed up on the punk list a while ago. I like it.


I stand second to none in condemning sexual harassment of
women, but what is happening is that every sexy joke of
long ago, every flirtation, is being recalled by some women
and revised and re-evaluated as sexual harassment.  Many of
these accusations are, in anybody's book, frivolous.
Frivolous accusations reduce, if not eliminate, not only
communications between men and women, but any kind of
playfulness and banter.  Where has the laughter gone?
     Instead of throwing down the gauntlet at every
opportunity, may I recommend the use of humor and gentle
sarcasm-- the deft touch, the intelligent approach-- rather
than the atom bomb?

I agree with you - it's wrong to blow stuff, even stupid and annoying stuff,
out of proportion.  The problem is that even very clear cut cases are still
blown off as frivolous.  Sometimes even on national TV.  This is really 
disheartening, and probably has something to do with why it can be hard at times
to be a good sport.  Like someone else said it gets OLD.  Awareness is the first
step, and slack all round.  I'm just naieve enough to believe that we all want
to hang together enough to overcome our barriers.  I'm happy to give slack and
try to see things in as positive a light as possible; in return I'd appreciate
an effort on the part of others towards changing ways of speech that hurt or

 Well, I & my girlfriend showed up way too early ( 11:45PM ) at the Future
Forum warehouse, so we hung out in my truck for awhile, watching the cars
arrive. Talked to Jon Drukman & friends when they arrived. Saw the DJ's
carrying their crates o' vinyl inside.

 The setup was very 'bare-bones' inside - the main dance area was actually 
located in the rear of the warehouse, with about as much space as the
basement of 1015 Folsom - like a club rave in a warehouse. Some day-glo
posters w/ blacklight illumination, a few rotating lights, no strobes. 
OK sound system.

 The chill space upstairs was very nice - almost as large as the dance area,
with carpeting and some furniture. Lots of dark side rooms to relax in, 
if you didn't mind the pulsations coming up through the floor ( my 
girlfriend Mary thought it would be a nice sonic massage ).

 The crowd was a nice, a mix of different degrees of dance mania and satorial
eccentricity. There was one monk/sorcerer guy who "purified" the whole 
warehouse with a smoldering bunch of sage (?) , to the respiratory alarm
of some. Another guy, with a "100% Fresh Jive" (?) tshirt definitely had
his psychic phaser set on "LOVE" - spreading the good vibe all over the
dancefloor. Of course, there were the folks at the periphery who were 
either "just looking" or getting their dance mood into gear; but the number
of gawkers at any one time was very small - due to the availability of
other spaces to hang out at, I think.

 As it was Mary's first rave, and also that we had both been up all day
Friday, we ended up leaving way early. Spun had started to do his thing,
the crowd was building up nicely ( around 2:45AM ). 

 SO - How did the rest of the Future Forum go ?

I usually spend at least the first 45 minutes of a rave wandering
around the periphery of the dance floor, getting in to the vibe and
taking a few love phaser shots at the others clustered at the fringe.
I almost always benefit from this...I can usually hang at an event
much longer if I do this.

I spend the last 45 minutes trying get my love phaser to burn thru

It occured to me this morning that I'd missed an opportunity
to post to sfraves directly from a rave.  Oh, well someone
else will have to go down in history for that.  

'Twas a weird evening for sure... It's a weird experience to
try and enter the *Stanford Coffee House* and being stopped
by a security goon.  Then pat came by and got Al and I in...
when you need to know someone to get into the CoHo, now
that's weird. 

Things were jumping all right, though of course there were
only a few people there who really Got It.  It was good too
seem some of my punk freinds out at a rave (it almost has to
be free and local to get them to compromise their
principles).  The Anime chill space... well it could've used
a bigger screen and no subtitles and a more separate space,
but it was okay for the ten minutes I got to hang there. 
And hey, this was definitely the rave with the best mochas
you're ever going to find.  

It got busted kind of early though, around 2:30 or 3AM --
something about underage drinking, though I heard one person
say it was because of the "Sin" flyers that started
circulating with a fairly explicit R rated shot of some
missionary position sex (clueless in many ways, like (1)
what's sinful about this? (2) what kind of fratboy jock
freshman crowd are they trying to attract?).

Anyway, after the bust the afterparty got started up early.  
Having a rave in your living room, now *that's* weird. 
The vibe was certainly much improved over at our house...
Also, I never really realized that Afterparties attract the
hArdcore.  

Definitely an interesting time was had... it's pretty
amazing the resources that pat has at his fingertips.

It is true that we must learn to be more sensitive in our words and our
actions; at the same time, we must also be willing to accommodate the
"slings and arrows of outrageous fortune."   Maybe some examples will help
(I don't hold myself up as a paragon of anything, but they are MY
experiences, and I've got the bandwidth for the nonce, so's you'll just have
to suffer :) ).

Anyway, I have occasionally been the unintended target of either racist or
homophobic comments.  The most laughable have been from people who assume
from my speech patterns and accent on the phone that I am Caucasian, and
then go on to make some disparaging comment about African-
Americans.  In most instances, a gentle reproof like, "that's very
interesting; I'm black and I never noticed that" suffices to correct the
mistaken behavior without a confrontation.  I've used similar tactics to
stop homophobic jokes, at least in my presence, like telling another joke
whose butt is straight people.  Again, point is made without hruling
accusations (that's hurling in the line above).

So, be cool, luv each other, be prepared for mistakes, but don't take no

Tahl,
	Thank you for your post, it does function as a reality check for some
of us.  But I do want you to consider several things for a moment.
If you look at what we are doing here on sfraves, one could say that
we are a group of like minded individuals who are conspiring to participate
enjoy and promote raving and all that it entails.  Our common network in
this case is electronic, not westpoint or harvard or Yale.  It is natural
for people to conspire in groups to gain control over their lives.
Why do you think its so far fetched for the ruling elite who go to
the same set of institutions, marry into the same families, and weild a 
considerable amount of power to "conspire" to hold onto what they love
and enjoy?  It's only natural.  Let's look at South Africa for example,
is every white person in south africa part of a conspiracy to deny 
democracy to the masses? Well I don't think every white person in SA
is a racist or would be against sharing .  But you see there IS a group
of people in SA (who are mostly white but not entirely) who stand to loose a lot
of money and power and most of all apparent CONTROL if one man one vote
comes into play.  Do all of the white people in SA have meetings and 
conspire to keep apartied in place, NO but some do, some blacks in SA do
as well, people such as Buteleazi who personally gets at least $300,000 a year 
from the South African government.  Look at the people in ANY cabinet of
ANY administration that the US has had, look at where they went to school
their ages, who their friends are and then think about your post again.

No THEY don't sit in some conference room up in the colorodo rockies and
plan crack epidemics or AIDS epidemics.  But the president of TRW who was in 
the Naval Acedemy with Senator so and so and the president of General
Dynamics can do golf together and you don't think they talk about the
LA riots and how niggers and faggots are fucking up this beautiful country
of ours? 

You must realize that there are people in the world who would seek to 
exterminate you and me if they could.  They got control of Germany
around 1938.  Were all of the German people Nazis of course not
I'm willing to bet that the Majority of them were NOT Natzis but
the Majority of them 
	1) Were sheep
	2) Didn't care about anybody outside there immediate group
	3) Believed that the "chicken littles" were sounding false alarms.

You must also remember that the first people to fight Hitler were germans!
No I don't think that THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX is out to get us.
But some control freaks in the Military industrial complex are.

Hi TV land folx--

My friend Brice Eisner (Ecstasy: the MDMA Story)
said he'd give the LSD episode a D+, and as a
veteran, experienced grader of high school essays
and similar frou-frah for the past 33 years I told
him I'd have to agree.  Whilst the were some admirably
clear and correct moments (the alcoholic cure, the
chromosonal nonsense, the weight issue) they were
massively overbalanced by the harum-scarum emphasis
of the total concept.  The weight issue, for example
was immediately overshadowed by the sharpjawed DEA
agent man telling us what he felt any decent parent
would want for the punishment of an LSD dealer responsi-
ble for the freak-out death of a son or daughter; the
past psychological therapeutic use by the doctor
who claimed to have seen "hundreds" of patients
suffering from LSD flashbacks, trails, and pointillisms;
the chromosonal nonsense by presenting Tim Lary as a
burnt-out sixties mindless prankster. 

Option magazine issue # 48 did a much better job, in
my grade book, than 48 Hours (curious the synchronicity
of those numbers, ain't it?  Any quabbalah folx out
there?  Option, whose purpose is to present music
alternative, gave us some wonderful quotes from our
own "Em Normal"; CBS-corporate state Amerika, whose
purpose is to keep us disempowered--or at least to
maintain the power structure's sometimes-tenuous hold
on status quo, presented us with the same kind od
despicable

folx, it's backfiring! And they're worried (like they
said on the show: "There's a rave coming your way--and
that's scary!"  Are you-all so brainwashed by the media
that you can't deconstruct what you see to realize that?
No, you're just responding to established patterns that
we all learn--and those patterns aren't broken except
through dialogue, conversation, and discourse.  Thank
goodness for open spaces like sfraves!

Hi Filx--

Oh fugg! Youve got this all fickened up!
Fornication Under Control of the King, indeed!
Sounds too good to be true, don't it!?  Well,
it is.  Too good to be true, that is!

The word goes back to Greek and Latin roots,
futuere, to copulate; German ficken, to strike,
to copulate, French, foutre, copulation, Shakes-
pearean English has it in some of his plays (nine
references, if anybody out there is interested),
etc.  The F.U.C.K. story, like others, probably
originated because of our puritanical culture
that, in its "cleaning up" nasty things that have
been around since time immemorial, excised any
reference to the word even from scholarly works
in the Victorian Age, and has reinstituted the
word as authentic, and re-presented its long
and both noble and ignoble history to us only recently!

I think the most interesting thing about the word in In                 
Indo-European roots is the earliest double-meaning the
word has as "hit" or "strike" as well as "copulate"
or "have sex."  We retain this meaning, don't we,
in "Fuck you!" and "S/He's a good fuck."  And our
synonyms for fuck--"knock up," "bang," etc., are
quite telling about our cultural view, too, aren't they?

Well, that's probably more than you were fuckin' expectin',
eh?

I'm thinking about writing to the staff there and suggesting they start
a new show called "135 BPM".  Any votes for that?  ;-)

Anyway, before I get going on my weekly pilgrimage to That Place Where
They Have Occasionally Interesting Videos, I wanted to pass along a couple
tidbits from last week's show, hosted by Mike Edwards of Jesus Jones.

Now, I've generally considered J2 a pretty ordinary outfit, another
throwaway fad-of-the-season UK crew, but Edwards came across as reasonably
together and not afraid of pushing the format a little bit.  basically,
he was the most enjoyable of the 'guest VJs' since they canned that poor
old punter Dave Kendall.  Edwards had nice things to say about techno
and raves, allowing as to how the Shamen were 'kind of techno' and a big
influence on Jesus Jones.  After playing the Sunscream video, he even said
this kind of techno-assisted pop was the wave of the future for rock music.
Well I don't know if I agree with that but Sunscream's video is enjoyable
and I'll take that over Duran Duran any day ;-)

After Morrissey's 'Shoplifters of the World Unite,' they put up his famous
quote, 'Rave is the refuge of the mentally deficient.'  Hang on a sec,
says Edwards (paraphrasing here), in East Germany rave DJs and musicians
are getting together a group called Skinheads Against Racial Tension --
compare that with Nostalgic English Pop Stars standing onstage waving the
Union Jack and singing about the British neo-Nazi party -- you tell me
who's mentally deficient.

Yoikes!!  Morrissey's quite talented of course, but many have questioned
his motivations and recent on-stage behavior in the British music press
(although word of that sort of thing is late to appear on this side of
the Atlantic, if at all -- I saw nothing about this in numerous previews
and reviews of Morrissey's recent American tour).  Quite cheeky of
Mike Edwards to do this, and perhaps it was premeditated (why else would
they have pull-quoted Morrissey's famous dictum), but it seems that things
are loosening up and getting better at 120M.

Also, not at all related to the above -- does anyone else see the UK jazz/etc.
magazine called Wire?  I saw and bought my first copy when I was in Seattle
on Friday, it has quite an interesting article on 'Ardkore which I will
type in and upload to the archives in the next couple of days.

Thanx again for prodding us and giving us material to

For, in truth, they do!

>>>taylor.prototype.808

Hmmm... hard letter to reply to, since I feel very strongly in both directions.

On the one hand, I totally respect your opinion - I went to raves for two years
in LA without doing _anything_ (no E or LSD, no drinking or smoking, in fact I
was made so paranoid about drugs by the Just Say No Gestapo I refused to take
aspirin or cold medicines) and still had the time of my life.  I didn't feel 
any need to take it then, and also I wasn't exposed to others who had taken it
or knew of a reliable source, and I was usually the driver anyways.  I had the
time of my life, and could always find the energy to dance and the mental 
energy to concentrate on the music and trance out.  Currently, I go to maybe 80
to 90% of my raves completely clean save for maybe sleep deprivation (which is
the most interesting drug in my opinion).  And those chEmicAls could disappear
from the face of the planet and I would still go to raves every week, simply
because I get enough out of most of them to make it worth the effort.

Now I probably shouldn't express the other hand for my own net.safety, but
since the FBI probably has a file on me the size of a good metropolitan phone
book, let me speak up in defense of acid and E at raves.  There are three main
reasons why they and raves go well together, in my mind:  
	1)  They allow you to totally get inside the music in case you have 
never been able to do that before (most people can't - very few people I know
who _aren't_ ravers can actually absorb music below their skin and feel it,
emote with it, respond to it, etc).  Taylor, I think you have this one covered.
	2)  Both give you lots and lots of energy, and you feel like you were
MEANT to dance.  This is an extension of #1.  And strange that, good raves
always go until 8 or 9 in the morning, just as most acid trips are ending...
AGAIN, this is something that many people I know who are not ravers just cannot
understand; they cannot reason why perfectly normal kids would want to dance
for so long every Saturday night, in the middle of the night fer cryin out 
loud.  Taylor, AGAIN, I think you have this one covered.
	3)  Raves are very _safe_ places to dose; they always strip away the
paranoia which many people (myself included) can get if dosing alone or at
home.  Raves surround you with friendly people, lots of water, and sensory
nutrification (ever gotten bored on lsd?  it sucks!).  But I also feel safe at
raves if I don't dose, so this isn't really a benefit of dosing so much as a
benefit of raving.

	I think one of the most important things to know about these drugs is
that it's very easy to approach them the wrong way, to think of them as 
recreation (like pot).  They should not be viewed in the same context as, say,
renting a movie or playing a video game.  They are NOT good methods of escape,
because they will almost always throw you head-first back into your own 
problems.  

	My first trips were, I hate to say, underwhelming.  I was expecting a
completely different world; I was expecting to be thrown into an Alice in
Wonderland voyage that would be completely unlike the present.  Boy was I 
wrong... not to say they weren't fun, but they just weren't something that was
completely different than trancing out to music or to love, just more intense.
I finally came to the conclusion that they weren't as overwhelming as most
other accounts of first-time trips basically because, well, I had less to learn
than most people.  And I think anyone who can get inside a beat or trance out
(I mean, trance out to the point of losing your train of thought) to a 303
bassline or let the music drive them into dancing for 7 hours straight has less
to learn from taking LSD or E than most people.

	If any of you get to the point where you find yourself saying to 
yourself, "well, this rave is only OK, if I don't dose I probably won't be able
to have fun"  then you're taking them for exactly the wrong reason.  And many
times I feel that too many people are saying this to themselves at raves :(
I think many other people use drugs as an excuse to do certain things at raves
that normal American culture doesn't like, such as smile and hug random 
strangers or dance for hours without stopping or wear panda earmuffs and carry
a teddy bear.  Why do I think this?  Because a couple of times I've gone to
raves clean, and started talking with a girl who was X'ing, being friendly, not
being sexual or anything: and when she asked me if I was X'ing I said no, and I
could instantly see that she felt 30 times more uncomfortable around me than if
I had said yes.  That, my friends, sucks.

	I love a reply I heard on alt.drugs a few months ago; someone was 
complaining because they thought that ecstasy was ruining the rave scene.  The
reply stated, "that's funny, I think the rave scene is ruining ecstasy".  

	So am I pro-drugs-at-raves or anti-drugs-at-raves?  Well, overall I'm
pro-legalization; I think drugs, taken in the right amounts and with the right
mind set and physical setting, can provide revolutionary insights.  And raves
are perhaps a very good place to take them.  But far too many people are using
them for the wrong reasons.  I think a good guideline would be, don't dose on 
anything at your first rave, and don't take anything for the first time at a
rave.  You should experience and make sure you enjoy and appreciate them 
individually before combining the two.

	Just my $.03

	Hi all!  Just a friendly message from those of us who went on the SFR
field trip - despite all the setbacks the past weekend was incredible.  The 11
people who went really pulled together - from Bob Ramstad's "well, I got enough
rice and beans here for 60 burritos" to Joachim's ring toy to Bryan's black
light mixed with Dana's flourescent GUCK to Cindy's incredible alarm clock to
Susie's tremendous luck on cross-country skis to Derek's GODLIKE Jeno tape
(make that Yay-Nuh, as is correctly pronounced. "Vill yu teech me to dee-yay?")
to Synthia's dog Woz to Jesse's fire-building skills to Laurel's great after-
rave clothing acquisition method recommendation, a good time was had by all.
Despite not having turntables due to Brian's car being inoperative, the music
was par excellant (mostly ambient when night fell) and inspired many people to
give impromptu dancing lessons.  And on Saturday Dana became DJ Jeno when we
strapped Derek's boombox to his backpack while we cross-country skiied at 
Badger Pass.  And the rangers didn't even bust us!  Though I must admit dancing 
in skis was a wee bit athletic.  

	Best line of the weekend, as said by Bryan: "yeah, sure Mondo 2000 is
a music magazine.  That's like saying High Times is about flying."

	Stay tuned for future SFR field trips......

Now I'm going to sya something in sort of vague reply that is possibly

have a good environment to do X or acid, who would probably be bored
if they were straight, and I think these people are OK.  This is where
i disagree with brian: i think these drugs are FUN to do if you have a
good head on your shoulders, in sort of the same way seeing a movie or
a play is fun.  And certainly a rave is the perfect environment for
them, and these people mean and cause no harm, so let 'em hang out, I

well she never really broke anyone out of stereotypes, but for some

at any event it shows how narrowminded our views on the placing of
sexuality within/ among culture are in the US (if anyone thinks
they/re not a part of that {we}, i think they/re bullshitting).

why is sex o.k. to be talked about when it is violently metaphored,
and why is violence ubiquitous - but sexing as an unmetaphored
expression almost completely eradicted from public areas?

yet eventhough sex as an end to itself is taboo, sex as a ubiquitous
drive and interest is a constant concern?

i think all interactions are erotic, but sex doesn/t have to play
into that - i like raving, because i pheel there is a better
percentage of people not out on the over hormoned singles fuck kick
at a rave than say at some bar or modern schlock club. although, i

Subject: Re:  the REAL reason drugs are illegal

Hello everyone in virtual rave-land.  I've been a lurker on this list for
the past couple of weeks and have enjoyed a lot of the discussions that
I've been following.  BTW, I've been to one (yup, that's only ONE :-()
rave and that was a while ago.  One of my new years' resolutions is to
to overcome my natural inertia and get out to more than a few raves in
'93.  Enough rambling - two messages posted here over the last few days
have especially caught my interest and prompted my delurking (or is that 
unlurking? :-))

<many very valid reasons deleted>

I am personally faced with a dilemma when trying to rationalize drug
legalization.  I'ld like to hear your thoughts on this.  Before I get
flamed to a crisp, let me say that above all I believe that a capable
adult must have complete control over his/her body, and the government
certainly has no business interfering.  (Of course this brings up a
related issue about the reasons why the world's oldest profession is
now illegal.  But let us not be distracted by a tangent here).

However, just as a person's right to swing her fist ends where another
person's nose begins, a person's complete control over her body ideally
should not have repercussions that extend further.  I'm not sure that 
speaking in the abstract is helping - let me try and elucidate by means
of a concrete example.  Since virtually all of the drugs we are talking
about here are "judgement altering" in some way (I refrain from using
the phrase "judgement impairing" since that is a lot more difficult to
justify), I wouldn't be too happy to know that the pilot of my airplane,
or the driver of the car I'm in, is under the influence because this
could have a deleterious effect on my personal well-being.  

Of course, I recognize that "responsible" use would mean that this
situation shouldn't occur in an ideal case, but unfortunately we
have to realize that the vast majority of the humans on this planet
are not capable of behaviour based purely on rational thought
(No, this isn't my theory - Thomas Hobbes beat me to it by over 300
years :-)).  One needs only to look at the number of accidents caused
by drunk drivers to show that legalization does not create "responsibility".
So it is my theory that perhaps one of the reasons that alcohol is
legal and most other drugs are not, is because of the fact that the
presence of alcohol is easily (and very accurately) detected and
tested for, whereas this isn't the case with the other drugs.  The
fact that such detection methods, even in cases where they exist, are
not foolproof would probably mean that many more people will be likely 
to use these drugs in an "irresponsible" manner.

What do all of you think?  [From following sfraves over the past couple
of weeks, I have noticed that people seem to respect the opinions of
others, and when they disagree, they do so in an intelligent manner
without resorting to ad hominem attacks.  I trust any disagreements you
may have with me will be handled in much the same manner.]


And again, it's tAXi <taxi@netcom.com> who writes:

> oh since we're talking about the word, fuck and word origins, check this out:

I'm sorry, but this is an ancient urban legend.  It is remarkably similar
to another mistaken belief that in medieval times people indulging in pre-
and extra-marital sex would be prosecuted "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge".  

Apparently "fuck" is a corruption of the Olde English verb "fokken" that
has roots in either Latin or Greek.

Subject: drugs at raves


Wow, the drug discussion is actually drifting back to rave
related topics...

Anyway, I agree with Will Penna that the "bad" publicity about
raves is backfiring, and actually I think it's bad from nearly
everyone's point of view.  Recently it's seemed like there's a
lot more drug activity going on at raves, and I think it may be
because the media is essentially advertising it as the in thing
to do.

I've got a resounding lack of interest in using drugs myself
(well, okay I use caffiene sometimes) though I think everyone's
got to make their own call, and it's pretty obvious they all
ought to be legalized.  Anyway, it's beginning to annoy me that a
lot of people don't seem to have any understanding of why you
would go to a rave except to dose.  It seems like whenever I meet
someone at a rave, the first thing they want to talk about is
drugs... they want to ask me if I can get some for them (someone
asked me for *coccaine* recently!), they want to know if I'm on
anything, or they want to tell me about what they're on.  I think
I'm fairly tolerant about these things, but it's getting kind of
boring.

I can do without having seventeen year old girls around going
"Look! The floor is moving."

(By the way, have I ever explained that the phrase "just my two
cents" drives me up the wall?  Could you folks please quit it?)

I think the best thing about drugs is that that can open your mind to new
stuff, and you can get into a simular state later without them.

The first two years in Manchester I went to raves with my friends who where
tripping etc, but I wasn't. I had a good time, and they said I didn't need
drugs cause I was mental anyway, and was the only "sober" person they wanted
to be with. I had a really good time, but wasn't really that into the music.
After trying some chEmicals, I got a new insight though, and now I can go to
raves sometimes unaltered, yet I now feel more inside the music etc, and
seem more at the same wavelength as those on E or whatever.

The same sort of thing CAN happen with alchohol. Rather than becoming 
dependant on it to feel secure, it can change you: If I've got really drunk 
and done something I've never dared to do before, I find it easier to do later,
when sober; I've done it once, the shield is broken sort of thing.

2) Speaking of the tribal/shamanness of raving/drugs, I have an interesting
   story:

My friends went to south america and were in this small village way out in the
jungle. They got some wierd brew from the medicine man, to find there "totem"
with. They tripped like nothing describeable, where in a total new world, with
dynasaurs etc, one of them was playing tennis with a moscito inside an orange
at the edge of the universe! Has anybody else heard of such?

I can't help detecting a sort of "We've were into this way before everybody
else and the new people aren't as hip as us" attitude in that saying.

I gather they said the floor was moving 'cause they where tripping, not that
it was bouncing up/down. If some girls haven't been to a rave or tripping first
it's natural for them to be suprised and exited when thet see strange things.
It would be sad if they had to try to look cool and unbothered as if they had
done it lots before.

If raves are suppost to be happy multi-racial/multi-cultural gatherings, I 
think they should be multi-age too.

Happy new year to all.  My first break from lurking dis year iz to 
respond to some of the comments made on HIV, green(vervet monkeys), etc.
I'll preface it with a humble "This is not meant to be flameworthy(and 
why do flammatory and inflammatory mean the same thing?)"
george(gwh@lurnix) says:
>... a lot of totally natural things that are equally wierd...
	Well, i tink...
that Nature is not so much wierd inasmuch as our quest for an understanding
of Nature with imperfect theories leads to quite a few "wierd" inconsistencies.
The SIV --> HIV connection theory has many problems.(This won't be too 
'scientific' and there could be valuable info so pls read on!)  First, it is
a postulate advanced with no solid evidence to support it and none has thus 
far been shown since its suggestion.  Recent articles in Science and Nature 
have presented EVIDENCE to dispute this link.  See, for example, Nature 359,
17 Sept, 1992.  In general these two journals provide good lay-articles 
concerning the weekly advances in AIDS/HIV research.  Second, the viruses; SIV
and HIV belong to a single, yet highly diverse group of lentiviruses "which 
can not be separated into distinct phylogenetic linkages according to species 
of origin" Nature vol 358 6 Aug, 1992.
	Third, the eating or domestication of green monkeys is by no means 
widepsread enough to account for the proliferation of the virus in the 
Continent nor in Melanesia(where the same strains of HIV as in the Pygmy of
Central Africa) have been identified.  The unsubstantiated acceptance of the 
monkey-African connection, I fear, has stronger roots in media-taught preju-
dices and dehumanization of Africans than it does science.

	In response to (i tink?) Mark and Paul:
	There is an informative book: A Survey of Chemical & Biological War-
fare by John Cookson & Judith Nottingham, Monthly Rev. Press, 1969.  This is 
a comprehensive book but written well-enough for those with modest backgrounds
in biology/genetics/virology.(like moi!)  From p 322
	"The question of whether new diseases could be used is of considerable interest.  Vervet monkey disease (African Green Monkey Disease) may well be an example of a whole new class of disease-causing organisms.
...'It has possible potential as an infectious disease of man.  It presumably 
is also of BW (biological warfare) interest... In addition to these are the pos

sibilities of virus and bacteria being genetically manipulated to produce 'new'
organisms."  
p 110 
	"Just recently a great deal of useful work has been done on the Vervet
Monkey Disease (AGMD) which caused seven deaths in Germany.  Reports of progress
were: 'sent to 40 laboratories all over the world; 9 of these have been sup-
plied with infective material and/or antisera..."
Another book is called A Higher Form of Killing (The Secret Story of Chemical
and Biological Warfare) by Robert Harris and Jeremy Paxman, Wang & Hill,1982.
This book also details the early work in 'machining' new forms of viral and bac-
terial agents.  Time and time again, the Green Monkey Disease is brought up.  
But not as some devilish monkey biting someone on the ass (or getting bit on 
the ass!) rather as an engineered device developed in laboratories.  For any 
who do not believe in conspiracy or victimization via biological testing or 
under the GUISE of vaccination, please explain the Tuskegee Syphilis Expmt to
me in logical terms.  There are also definite correlations between the out-
break (epidemic) of AIDS in Africa and polio vaccinations where there do not 
exist between the presence of HIV and AIDS.  This is not to say that the polio 
vaccine and the HIV are similar.  Moreso, I wonder if the polio vaccinations
were a vehicle for 'scientific testing in a controlled environment' under 
socially acceptible make-up.  Before i descend into more acerbic rantings, 
I have other refs. available, if anyone is interested.  Hope this illuminates.

	p.s.	I strongly second Geoff's response inre the Mil. Ind. Comp.

	ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL-Monday Morning January 11, 1993.

Police Raid Youths' Midnight 'Rave' at Closed Club
By Steve Shoup-Journal Staff Writer

	Police broke up an illegal party at a former teen-age dance club in the
Northeast Heights this weekend, in what may have been the city's first
L.A.-Style "rave."  Raves- underground, loud, alternative-music parties with an
admission charge - have been happening at various places around Albuquerque for
more than a year, but for the most part legally in rented buildings, according
to some participants.  The raves in Los Angeles are usually staged from about
midnight to dawn in warehouses or the like, usually after they've been broken
into. 
	Sunday's party resulted in the arrest of one man on suspicion of 
commercial burglary after police raided the former Maxwell's, 4575 San Mateo,
where the rave was held.  The club, which mostly drew 14-21-year-olds for music
and non-alcoholic drinks, closed on Christmans.  About 200 young people were in
the club about 12:15 a.m. Sunday when Albuquerque police burglary and SWAT
officers, acting on a tip received by the owner of the building, raided the 
event, said Albuquerque police spokeswoman Mary Molina Mescall.
	That's what upsed some of the participants.  "They started pushing
people around - that's literally what they did," said Evan Earthman, who was
at the event.  "Can't they be out arresting drunk drivers?  That's a little bit
more dangerous to people anyway."  Earthman said police came in, ordered the
crowd to sit down, which most did.  Some booed, but most cooperated.  He said
police told the crowd they'd been ripped off by the organizers.
	Earthman said he didn't know he was in the building illegally and 
neither did most of the crowd.  People were allowed to leave after about 
45 minutes, but were frisked on the way out, he said.  
"They (police) addmitted they knew people weren't guilty, but still they 
treated people like criminals," Earthman said.  He said he's concerned the 
scrutiny of raves might ruin them.  "I have nothing against police doing their
jobs, I have a problem with another activity for people under 21 going down
the drain," Earthman said.
	Mescall said the building's owner, Trammell Crow Co., got a tip about
the rave.  Burglary officers are investigating the rave, and the SWAT officers
in regular police uniforms were brought in to avoid pulling patrol officers off
the streets.  The state Department of Public Safety Special Investigations 
Division was also brought in to investigate possible alcohol violations.
	Mescall said she had no information on whether there were alcohol
violations.  Mescall said police want to prevent more raves.  "We would like
to prevent it before it gets huge," she said.  "This activity is illegat and
it's conducive to other illegal activities, like minors in possession of 
alcohol."
	Another participant, who identified himself only as Matthew, 22, said
raves feature recorded music - and sometimes live bands - often neither heard
on radio nor available for sale here.  Part of the fun is that raves are held
in different locations every time, and the participants don't know where until
they buy tickets and get a map.  Raves are different from main-stream clubs,
said Matthew, who called the Journal to talk about what had happened at the 
rave.  "It's totally different.  Instead of the same nightclub, you get a 
different atmosphere every week," Matthew said.
	"Most of the events I've done there's been no problems," Matthew said.
"Usually, they're held legally."  Matthew said he was helping with the event
, but didn't help plan it, and didn't know it was illegal.  He said he was
handcuffed by police but not arrested, and many of his record albums were
confiscated.  Bradford Cole, 26, of Cardenas SW, was arrested by police at 
Maxwell's and booked into the Bernalillo County Detention Center early Sunday
on suspicion of commercial burglary and criminal damage over $1,000, according
to jail records.  He remained in custody Sunday night.

Howday, all.  Two related bits/questions/whatever:

1) I've got a DAT deck and a hankering for some good fresh live mixes.
If anyone out there is throwing an event with good DJs and wouldn't
mind me patching in to the mixer, I'd be pretty stoked.  Send email...
in exchange I'd be happy to run DAT or cassette copies of whatever
turns out OK.  Note that since this service is *free* (until I get
overwhelmed by demand or decide it isn't fun) I make no warranty at
all as to how the recordings turn out.

2) If anyone out there has already done this / is still doing this,
and wouldn't mind making some copies of their DATs for me, just
holler.  If you don't have two decks, we could get our decks together
for some copying.

Sorry for the possibly limited interest group... but maybe I'll be
able to turn on the list to some good tapes sometime --- this offer is
definitely good for any SFRaves promoted events.

Take it easy,
Bob

PS Yosemite trip was a good time, kudos to Brian for having the idea
and the energy to follow through with it.

I have heard this precise argument from police officers. The first time
I heard it was from a guy who was an M.P. (military police, not member
of pariliment :)) A single breathlizer test costs something like a dime,
while a test to detect marijuana costs several dollars, is not as accurate,
and (correct me if this is wrong) is not portable enough for every officer
to be able to apply the test while on duty, i.e. they would have to go 
back to the station. 

Now think about how difficult it would be to detect LSD in someones body!
How many micrograms are in the normal dose? 300? I think you would need a
very sophisticated blood analysis to actually measure this. I wonder if 
this is one of the reasons that it is hard to prosecute someone who turns
themselves in when having a bad trip. There is no proof that you actually
took LSD because maybe the hospital doesn't even bother to run such an
expensive test. 

Does anyone know anything about blood tests?

Why yes, I've heard those are good courts but it's a long drive. |-)
No, but seriously, there are a lot of south american botanical hallucinogens.
I've read that many are in the datura family but they are trees and vines
and I don't think they are anything like the datura(s) of the northern
hemisphere.  Some of these contain DMT, some other drugs.  I've heard of
different ways of preparation and ingestion, sometimes a drink and sometimes
a snuff, ususaly made from the bark of the vine or tree .  The snuff is
forceably blown up your nose by someone else through long tubes.  I've also
read about durations that last from 6-24 hours and recovery or sleep periods
of up to 3 days.  Very general info, but that's all I can rememeber - there's
so many of those plants and drugs.

What I've heard (probably urban legend, but I know enough people that
act as though it's the truth) is that LSD use can only be detected
after the fact by testing hair.  Something like at least 1 week after
using LSD and no more than 6 months since using it (after that time
frame, all the hair which was present when the LSD was in the body has
been shed.)

Anyone have more specific info?  I've heard rumors of a blood test
which can only determine if the person has dosed within the last 3-4
hours, but isn't any good after that.

drug and etymology debates as much as anyone, but I really really wanted to

OK, I went to Foundation and thought it sucked.  The music was more
hardcore than the usual Garth/Jeno stuff, and I liked a lot of it too.
The main problem, though, was that it was at The Stone, which means 1)
asshole security that frisks you when you come in, 2) it's so crowded
that you can't possibly dance without 25000 people bumping into you and
another 25000 trying to walk across the dance floor, and 3) an incredibly 
lame sound system.

OK, this review is for Brian.  After getting back from Yosemite, I had
some dinner at home, then went to a cafe to read the sunday paper, where
I ran into Mike W (and Anne F, for those of you who know Anne), whom I
followed to Cha Cha Cha on Haight (to eat another dinner), then I stopped
at Nightbreak for a few minutes to catch the end of the usual free live
bands on Sundays, did a little grocery shopping, then back home for a 
little while, then over to Malachi's thing at the El Rio.

It was a little mellow, I saw a lot of rave regulars there, including 
MykL (who thwarted my comeback attempt in a game of 8-ball).  The DJ was sort of
anonymous, playing some OK but not spectacular toons.  By 12:30, people
started dancing, after that point, there were always 10-20 people dancing.
The crowd seemed more close than most other events - it seemed like
everybody knew everyone else, or at least had a mutual friend.  

There was supposed to be a way-underground after-party in a warehouse
on Charter Oak in that Army-Bayshore area, with Josh, Simon, Carlos, etc.
but I had had a long day and I wanted to get home to sleep and dream.

>>Now think about how difficult it would be to detect LSD in someones body!
How many micrograms are in the normal dose? 300? I think you would need a
very sophisticated blood analysis to actually measure this. I wonder if
this is one of the reasons that it is hard to prosecute someone who turns
themselves in when having a bad trip. There is no proof that you actually
took LSD because maybe the hospital doesn't even bother to run such an
expensive test.

Does anyone know anything about blood tests?

	I did some research regarding the different drug detection techniques.
	First of all, the ones they use on a urine sample do not test for the

wow - good wake up call for me... i realized my comment about the
commedian wasn't an effective way to commuunicate what i was on
about just after i sent it, and while that doesn/t cahnge the fact i
sent it, i'm glad someone pointedly critiqued it... so while my
apologies are meant, they don't help the situation...

so i'll try again, and hope someone is in the mood to listen:

usually, the music at raves is able to cross away from the sort of
gender construction of everything other than most jazz and classical
(musically that is), except for bands like lords of acid and the
constant orgasmic samples of women's vocals... however, i feel this
is not because people in rave are somehow more aware, it/s simply a
matter of not having the trope of lyrics at their formulaic
disposal.

i think the comments of the commedian show the ignorance myself and
what i feel many other people have about the consistent association
of sex with viloence. what i missed, and what i think jocelyn is in
part pointing out is that it's not as simple as just sex and
violence - as lords of acid, the people who do the {i'm goina make
you squeal song} and the people who sample the tim dog tirade
against michelle le show, the violence in the equation is often
directed on women....

and as many postings about raves suggest, the subtle unrealizings of
the politics of who is allowed to take their shirts off, or rather
who can do it without expecting reactions of unwanted sexual
excitement, the subtle unrealizings of what might be constituted of
a hit, or effective eroticization of a moment show, the rave scene
is at best a slowed environment of the culture surrounding it. and
perhaps at best raves, are at least practice for the long process of
buying out of the unfortunate, unjustified, and violent history of
gender relations in the u.s.

i think eroticism is a great monistic unifying force. but it only
works when all sides agree to its parameters and signifiers, and
even more importantly, can act in equal relations to each other
through it.

Subject: Digital Be-In Review

Not exactly a rave review, but Brian put the notice in his weekly listings,
so here it is:
  The MC (yes, there was an MC: a lady bedecked in a ritzy costume that looked
like a mating of Glamour and Mondo 2000) announced that we were the new 
generation, a cyberelectric group of pioneers forging etc. yawn etc.
  I'm afraid that pretty much set the tone for the whole event.  Tim Leary was
there, as were about a dozen or so booths demonstrating or hawking VR-type
computer programs.  One, a game where you saw your virtual image on screen
then proceeded to play several virtual games (like PONG), was pretty cool. But
there was a contrived air to the whole show.  It was certainly a hell of a long
way from the funky roots-type operation of the Be-Ins of the 60s. One room was
even restricted to people who were wearing the proper press card. A number of
us stood in line, then were rudely turned away because we lacked the proper
identifying credentials.
  There was music. An Italian physicist who makes electronic music in
accordance
 with her theory of star radio wave emanation did her thing.  A black hip hop
group played -- with the kind of second-level energy such groups reserve for
nearly all Asian&Caucasian audiences. A total of four people danced while a
smal
l crowd watched dispassionately.
  In all, the Digital Be-In had something of the flavor of a junior Macworld
Expo, which was also taking place a few blocks away.  The Digital Be-In took
place in the Fashion Center on 8th Street.  While the laser lights flashed and
fractal images were projected on big screens over the stage, you could see the
semi-dark showroom windows featuring the latest in expensive fashions.
  I found the symbolism perfect.

this is true.  but i think too much good-hearted, playful, flirtation
gets turned into harrassment/violence against women.  don't get me
wrong, i hate nothing more than to see men treating women as sub-humans
on the street or at a club.  once i had a ringing in my ears for over
a month because some complete strangers on there way to a "disco/mini
truck" club were ogling/shouting at some nearby girls, and i took it
upon myself to remind them of what respect and politeness are.  they then
proceeded to remind me what happens to people who don't mind their own 
business (not meant as a sympathy getter).  

...but, what ever happened to boyz and girlz (sorry, any of the sexes :)
being able to flirt and be sexual with each other without someone getting 
slapped with a law.suit? i mean who's to say that _I_ shouldn't be offended 
that some girl is walking around topless, instead of her being offended that 
i'm looking? sure, that's closing in on the "look how she's dressed...she asked
for it" attitude, but _to a certain extent_ that attitude is correct.

*** oh boy, i'm way off track here ***  

i guess i think that those who would stomp out free eroticism as a healthy,
playful means of interplay are the few.  i will be the last to say that
there is not a problem with sexual.discrimination/harrassment in our world, 
(although in some cultures it's preferred that way...) but i think a lot
of innocent cases get pigeonholed into a category when the situation is really
misunderstood.  i mean, as someone posted on friday, if i come up to a girl and
ask, "hey babeee, you wanna *%$*?"  all that has to be said is "no."  now,
if i keep it up, i'm being a jerk or too persisent or being abusive, dependent
on lots of variables.

i don't know where this is going, i guess i just find it hard to believe
that _any_ of the crowd on sfraves (boy/girl) would be a willing participant
in sexual abuse.  and where an action might offend one person, it might
have an exciting/arousing effect on someone else.

Ok, here's my account of the past weekend.

Thursday night: Deep Space, Markie-Mark spun some cool stuff that I really got
off on. I'd describe it, but I killed those brain cells. Good energetic
crowd for a club.

Friday night: Went to the Charter Oak warehouse with Mike W. It looked kind
of dead from the outside. Ran into Jon D. who said it looked dead on the
inside, too and not to waste our money.

Went to Zanzibar's. Nice acid jazz and other bouncy house. Stayed til closing.

Went to caffiend. Missed the party, but found the afterparty. Sweltering.
Good crowd, music OK (loved that Miles Davis tune, Pat).

Saturday night: Tried to go to Elysium. No sign of activity in the parking
lot/meeting point, Ditto for the supposed rave location (later, I found out
it had been moved. Note to self: always take the hotline phone number with 
you to the rave)

Went to Foundation, usual Stone/One Step Beyond BS on the way in. Packed.
I mean really packed. Good trancey music for a while, but I couldn't trance
out due to the large number of people bumping into me. Later, the music went
down hill and we left.


All in all, the most satisfying part of the weekend was Deep Space on Thursday
night. Anyone actually make it to Elysium? It was at 375 1st St. in SF.

 I'll have to agree with that as well - as someone at the far end of
"thirty-something", I always am pleased to see folks who look as old
or older than me at raves. Of course, some of them might be undercover
narcs, but they still seem to be having fun :-) .


 If there was one thing about my girlfriend's first rave ( Future Forum )
that gave her doubts about going to more raves, is that she felt so
much older than the average for the crowd ( she's a little older than
me ).

 That was one of the many things that appealed to me about the first
"LIGHTHOUSE" event in Santa Cruz - a very mixed crowd, age-wise and
fashion/lifestyle-wise .  ( Hey Paul T. - when's Craig going to do
another one? ). 


PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION => What hope does a movement have, if it only
addresses itself to a small segment of society - in this case, only
to the teen-to-twenty-something segment of the population? Is this one
of the problems with the Sixties? [OH NO, the dreaded RAVES/60's thread
rears it's shaggy head again !!!] ;-]

microfamily of ravers out there.

As far as reviews are concerned, the only event that I attended recently was the
FMR, which was just rocking away until its eventual bust.  I was so amped to
dance there, and Spun was laying down so INTENSE music.  I really like his 
sets alot.  (Actually, Mike and I call him an asshole, in a good way.  That is,
he is relentless in pounding you with really psychedelic, trippy music that
will trance you out in any mental condition.  :) )

Oh yeah, there was one message that asked about extreme hallucinatory experiences, 
and I have one to offer.  On the come down of an acid trip, my friend Olivier
and I each ate a really potent brownie that our friend had whipped up for
us.  I spent the next 2 hours lying on a couch with my eyes closed, seeing 
incredible "visions".  The best one was:  I saw this giant, fiery, liquid sun
in the middle of the universe that huge blue space dolphins were swimming and 
splashing around in.  The splashes that they caused would fly out into the unve
universe as fine, fine mist, and would form all of the solid matter in the
universe such as planets, creatures, people, etc....  Incredible!

I'd care to but I can't.  Are you questioning the existance of the 
evidence itself or my memory of it's whereabouts?  Strong evidence for
me may not be for you.  Like most intelligent humans, probably including
many, if not everybody on this list, I read and listen a lot.  Not having a
computer-like info retrieval system I cannot remember where all of the
peices of info that I ingest are sourced from.  Because of this, I can only
decide at the time of learning, the reliability of the information in order
to form an opinion about it, knowing that I may not be able to remember the
source in the future unless I'm very interested in the particular issue
(which I'm not or I'd have already dug in and found out a lot of information
and I would be able to spontaneously give you sources).  No, this isn't a
fool proof way to handle information but what can we do, were only human,
right?

So, no, I don't have any citeable strong evidence but if your truly interested
(which I doubt, because since your obviously intelligent, computer literate,
etc. you don't need me to point you around or teach you how to research a 
subject, right?) there are a lot of articles out there, if anyone remembers
exact sources, please post them for Chris as she/he apparently has not read
any of them or does not know how to track them down or like most of us cares
but doesn't have the time to go chasing around every interesting topic.

Sounds like Voodo Chile knows some and who was it that had or listened to
10 hrs. of tape on the subject?

One of the sources on Flashpoints was a recent edition of a popular gay news
publication that I don't remember the title of (it might be out of NY), so if
anyone knows that one....

Is there anything from the alt.folklore.urban discusion that we should know?
Frankly, I've seen more laboratory-AIDS theory information than information
that directly disputes these claims so I'd like to see the ball hit into
the other side of the court again.

-Mark

P.S. Other than requested source postings or Chris' potential response to
     the last paragraph (which are probably acceptable because a lot of us
     are probably curious) this thread should probably go private or quiet
     unless nobody is tired of it yet, which I doubt cause I am.

Some of the other products were pretty cool... A wired setup that you
hook around your body that creates MIDI events, so one can play music

World Entertainment War also played... IMHO they were great.  And the
Vortex: Henry Kaiser on guitar, Bob Bravalove on keyboards (he
does MIDI stuff for the Dead), good horn player... The coolest band was the
last one (coolest in terms of the technology they used, not the
music)...  Besides some members using the body MIDI setup described
above, the dancer mentioned above was playing along, by hitting virtual
objects projected on the screen.  If they implemented it the way I

You're mis-reading me a bit.  I might plead guilty to
"ageist" notion that young folks shouldn't be doing powerful
drugs (though if it were left up to me, I would probably
make it legal at 13 or 16 or something, but personally I'd
probably tell my teenage friends to stay away from them).

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with having young
folks at raves.  

The main thing I was saying is that I'm getting annoyed that
raves are turning from cool events with cool people (who
sometimes take drugs) to being places for people who are
into drugs.

Right, raves should be open to everyone... but I'm afraid

well, elysium was thrown by a girl named karen, and don't be too hard
on her too quickly...she tried. :)

it started out it santa clara, but she lost the space, so it moved up
to oakland. i'm not sure where 375 1st St./SF came from, but i don't
think they ever had a city spot.

anyway...once in oakland, they got the space and started to set up.
my roommates went up around 10:30, rob riddle was dj.ing the chill
room, and optica lux was doing visuals...but when they got to the
space, there was no one there.  i saw danny and karen last nite, adn
got the full skoop.

apparently, the copz got wind up the rave from the beginning and had
been following it all the way from santa clara.  they started harrassing
the people setting up before the party had even started!  they eventually
shut it down for permit reasons.

i had decided by 10:00 that i wasn't going to drive to oakland in the rain.
an hour drive...naaah.

well, anyway, that's what happened to elysium.  

the party i advertized last week has moved up a week to THIS friday.

so if anyone will be in the south bay and feels like stopping by a house
party...831 e. st. james [in between 17th and 18th] 408.286.2729.

I'm looking for any tribal songs that have a similar sound to
this:
 
"Aboriginal" by Techno Grooves (Written by R.el Lungo), Label - STR 1991
This song has an aborigine chanting over a funky bassline and the drums
sounds like bones hitting each other. It sounds like their doing a rain

Are there any other songs like this?

 so i went to the caffeind thing at stanford friday night.
we got there around 12 or so and the music was going pretty good. there
were guards at the door and they seemed to keep a close count on people in
the room - if 3 people left, 3 people would be let in. i don't know who
was spinning at that time, but there was some good housey stuff. the crowd
was pretty energetic, but about 1/3 of the people were sitting on the sideline
'observing'. saw some kzsu types - hi pat ! -and i general had a pretty good
time. there WAS this one guy falling on me (drunk?), which was kinda annoying.
too bad it got stopped when it did, i was just getting into the groove.

Hi Carl and sfravers all--

I gotta take sides and agree with Carl's
review.  It wasn't a tired or pretentious
event--and my senses weren't altered one iota,
because I was planning to take in as mush of
MacWorld the next day (which I did). IMHO
Tim Leary was at his most poetic yet. I loved
the Italian Amazon astrophysicist, Dr. Fiorella
Tirenzi, altho her space wasn't as great as at
the Townsend/Mondo event last year.  I also
loved the Leary prequel and sequel samples in
the music--first, in some of her stuff, and then
later in Vortex's.  This was also one of Henry
Kaiser's best gigs--for me.  And I usually hate
World Entertainment War (altho I like Bresny's
poetry in other contexts), but they were ok.
The cyberschtick was fun, Tim's Hyperdelic Video
was fabudelic and his musickal background was thee
tops!  All in all, more mondo than mondo.  I'm 
easy, I guess--I even got giggles over the pretentious
emcee lady in her Rodeo Drive Googwill gladrags!
Lighten up folx--behappy belobotomized!

Hi Larry and the Multi-ravers,

If I were George Bush I might say let's look
into the age thing.

In the marble foyer of our main building at SC

Freedom Cometh Not Free

Of course, it's meant there about the war thing, because
it's surrounded by the names of all our grads from
the War to End All Wars to the Nam who became cannon fodder.

But I'd like to apply that quote to the Vision Thang:
Ageism, Sexism, Heterosexism, Etcism Dieth Not Forever

We gotta talk about these issue, and can never assume
that, well, now we took care of that one.  We all are
here to be with each other, to be ever inclusive, not
exclusive. That's the challenge.

Subject: Digital Be-In

  Not exactly a rave review, but Brian put the notice in his weekly listings,
so here it is:
  The MC (yes, there was an MC: a lady bedecked in a ritzy costume that looked
like a mating of Glamour and Mondo 2000) announced that we were the new 
generation, a cyberelectric group of pioneers forging etc. yawn etc.
  I'm afraid that pretty much set the tone for the whole event.  Tim Leary was
there, as were about a dozen or so booths demonstrating or hawking VR-type
computer programs.  One, a game where you saw your virtual image on screen
then proceeded to play several virtual games (like PONG), was pretty cool. But
there was a contrived air to the whole show.  It was certainly a hell of a long
way from the funky roots-type operation of the Be-Ins of the 60s. One room was
even restricted to people who were wearing the proper press card. A number of
us stood in line, then were rudely turned away because we lacked the proper
identifying credentials.
  There was music. An Italian physicist who makes electronic music in accordance with her theory of star radio wave emanation did her thing.  A black hip hop
group played -- with the kind of second-level energy such groups reserve for
nearly all Asian&Caucasian audiences. A total of four people danced while a small crowd watched dispassionately.
  In all, the Digital Be-In had something of the flavor of a junior Macworld
Expo, which was also taking place a few blocks away.  The Digital Be-In took
place in the Fashion Center on 8th Street.  While the laser lights flashed and
fractal images were projected on big screens over the stage, you could see the
semi-dark showroom windows featuring the latest in expensive fashions.
  I found the symbolism perfect.

Subject: Another NYE party!


Hi everybody,
Here is Marco, and for those of you that i've not met when i was in SF i'm one 
of the lucky people that has been one of you for about 8 mounth and now 
he's back in his country.
After reading all yours reviews about some SF NYE happening, I'd like to tell
you something about another way of living the rave scene.
In contrast with SF , here in italy raving is more hidden and dark 
attitude, and because of people strongly connect rave to the drug problems, 
it is more difficult for me  going around telling everybody that i use to go
to rave.
So the information about an event is trasmitted between friends and friends of
friends, sometimes there are also flyer but this identify a commercial and legal
thing.
Obviously, for the NYE there were a lot of "fuori orario" available in the 
nother side of italy.
The one that i choose was one that happen in a small town near Pisa, that is 
about 500 miles from where i live.
The cost was really high, at the actual change ItalianLire<-> $ about 100$.
That huge price included two free drink.
The place was really big , with 5 dance floor, and 5 different DJ spinning at
the same time, in addiction there was another room where some security-guy
decided if you are right to enter or not.
The best dance floor was one that for all the night i thought was made of 
mirror, but when the sun rise i realize that was a covered veranda made of
black windows.
That rave was a 20 hours one so it goes ahead from 10PM of the 31 to 8PM of the
1 day of the 1993.
Talking with one of the organizer he told me that about 5000 people had buy the
ticket, but i saw at 6 in the morning another couple of bus coming from another 
rave from Rimini, paying about 120$ at the entrance, so for that night the 
amount of money was really impressive. (without counting All thE other cost 
for A rAvE, and in Europe in general those things have an average of prices 
that is 3/4 time higher that in SF).
BTW, we were in a company of 20 people and we really enjoy the party, one thing
that really surprise me was the music, i've found that a lot of music that
I heard in SanFrancisco is Italian made. ( Giamma the one that we were talking
about the mornig after Basics&DNA is made by an Italian Group called FBIproject)
Just another thing to add, because of the reason that the rave is already an
illegal thing, people are really freak-out, and when i say out i do not refer 
only about "rEgulAr toys" for rave but other stuff like  poppers, different 
colours of various powder, and a lot of alcool. Unlikly all this things do not 
allow people to be so friendly like the many that i found in SanFrancisco.
It's all for now, i'm really happy to continue to be in conctact with you 
SFravers and the great scene of SF.


I wish to all you , in particular Giamma & Jonathan, James, MykL G, Brian, 
Niels and the other that i met there but i forgot the name, happy new year 
and a great future, hoping to see ya all again.

Ciao Marco.

PS: A friend of mine told me that in sunday night news program on TV 
he saw a short report from SF, about the rave scene, and i guess that is the
same that all you are talking about under the subject "48 hours".

Subject: weekend update

friday night - future forum thingie at that icky warehouse on charter
oak.  mark is such a cool guy - he was at the door when we got there,
explaining what the future forum is, taking money, talking to the
guests, etc.  later on he could be seen circulating among the ravers,
shaking hands and talking to all participants.  we arrived early and
there wasn't much happening.  some dj named simon (but not the one who
is usually at the DNA) was playing a rather erratic set.  one or two
people were dancing.  most were upstairs in the chill lounge which is
the only heated room in the building.  i know that was a great
attraction for me.  eventually the dance floor began to fill in a
little.  spun showed up and played a pretty good set although by no
means one of his best.  i ran into mike w and pete r outside and told
them to bag it, although about 30 mins after they left the party
picked up considerably.  after spun came bones who did the same thing
he always did.  although he always gives the UVC a spin, even that
mighty groove can't save his sets...  round about 30 mins into his set
we got incredibly bored and left.

saturday night - groove kitchen at king st.  i was dreading this.
actually, every rave looked horrifying.  i hate the stone (where
foundation was) so i was resisted that even though the DJ lineup
looked promising.  someone told us that you had to take a shuttle thru
oakland to get to elysium which was about as appealing as crawling
through broken glass, so we instantly dismissed that possibility.
groove kitchen had very little going for it - 2nd string DJs
(including Buck who played possibly the worst set i've ever heard on
new years day at the DNA) and king st (i'm so BORED of this space).
on the plus side, it would probably be cheap, there are ins and outs
at king st, and there's that donut shop around the corner for when you
need your sugar and caffeine fix to keep dancing.  the in and out
thing was important cos i had a friend from back east visiting and he
was extremely tired so i might have had to drive him back to his hotel
at some point, and i wanted to make sure i could get back to the rave
after that mission of mercy.

so we wound up at king st almost by default (stopped for a snack at a
restaurant close to it).  price was good - $10.  a big sign caught my
eye: NO INS AND OUTS.  i asked the security goon if they would be
allowing them later.  he said, "don't know."  i decided to risk it
anyway.  entered to find alfie doing an OK set - he played one of my
fave future sound of london tracks... the space was not incredibly
crowded, which meant that it was kind of chilly inside.  ran into mykl
G who mentioned that garth was going to substitute for some NY DJ who
had canceled.  that sounded cool to me, and my friend was interested
in hearing garth (since i talked him up so much).

buck was on after alfie, and i was massively paranoid.  fortunately,
he played a very decent set.  the first half was straight techno
grooves, which was ok.  the 2nd half was the real treat - lots of
funky hip hop stuff, mostly rap instrumental tracks (an oxymoron?  i
dunno.)  my friend is a hip hop producer so he was particularly
interested in hearing this.  at this point, the dance floor was at a
very decent density - enough space to dance and enough bodies to keep
it at a nice warm temperature too.

garth came on next and did a very hard and funky set.  really good
stuff, incredibly energy packed and motivating.  unfortunately, he
only kept that going for an hour or so before degenerating into disco.
still, we got two quality hours from buck and garth, and that was way
more than i had hoped for.

not a stellar weekend for raving, but groove kitchen was better than i
expected and both nights were relatively cheap.

Yep; that's what it is; I might be mistaken, but...

I think the term blunt comes from the Jamaican-American 
population. At least, that's where I first heard it; underground 
Jamaican speak-easies (tiny bar-type places usually located in 
people's basements) in Philadelphia. 

Could be wrong, though; it's been known to happen-

Let me elaborate:
I am not requesting treatment of any kind. All I am saying is if I wear
certain clothes, I expect certain treatment from strangers.  If I walk
around the financial district at noon on a weekday in a bozo costume.
I expect to be stared at. I can't control people's reaction, if they
don't touch me, the reactions don't bother me.
The above sentence should have been "Comments like .... don't bother me",
instead of "I don't mind", since it sound more positive than neutral. 
I am secure about my body and my mind, just before someone likes
looking at my body doesn't mean that he/she thinks that I am stupid.
I have friends that are less secure and need the occasional "Men
still like my looks" ego booster.
If I make the effort to look a certain way, I want to be noticed and
reacted to accordingly. I'd be depressed if I spend all week making
a halloween costume and no one look and smile at me.
I play different roles every minute, sometimes I want to flaunt my
brains, sometimes I want to flaunt my guts with my death defying
exploits, sometimes I want to be attractive. They are not mutually
exclusive. In case you think that I am walking around town in
lingerie, I spend most of my time in grungey functional clothes, I don't
even brush my hair most days.
If you think that someone who likes visual attention ocasionally is a sex
object and cannot play other roles, well, stay to your one adjective
per person life, and I will stick to my never the same person twice life.

Hi Fellow Ravers!

After a completely fun but exhausting week in SF doing MacWorld Expo and
Raving,  I'm back in Seattle wishing I was back in SF!

Friday Nite- Got in to the Sound Factory party.  Great place which consisted of
two dance floors.  With one floor playing deep house/techno/tribal combo of
tunes while the other floor played hip-hop. I'm not sure who was spinning on
the rave floor but, seems he did over do the retro disco tunes just a bit.  The
place was fairly packed with a good combination of people. Finally got to bed
about 7am and slept for most of the day!

Saturday Nite- Tried to go to Foundation but found a huge crowd of people
outside.  My cuzin, Brian D, said it wouldn't be worth the hassle of waiting as
the place was pretty small. So we headed to Groove Kitchen which was going
pretty well by the time we got there at about 2am.  The DJ's (not sure who was
playing) did an excellent job playing a good combination of music.  Being
somewhat of a visual freak,  I enjoyed the projections and computer graphics as
well. We then went to DNA around 7am which was really JAMMIN!!!  There was an
incredible amount of energy.  The second DJ up (Sean ??) played an incredible
set of deep house and tribal mixes.  I met a lot of great people there.  When
DNA closed down we then headed for the End Up.  Again, really incredible energy
and great house music.  Unfortunately had to cut the day short as my flight to
Seattle left at 6 :-(  Oh well... was it Shakespeare that said "'Tis better to
have raved once than never to have raved at all" ?  :-)

I'm not sure if I met any one that's on the SF Raves alias but, I did meet a
lot of really great people who added a lot to quite an exceptional experience
there.
I'm definitely going to try to make it up there sometime again soon!

Peace and Ecstasy To All!!!

Subject: 2nd string DJs


As Buck's father, i won't pretend to be unbiased.  But with a lifetime in
music, i trust my good, objective ears.  Even with those inimitable
credentials, i would never call myself "God's Personal DJ" for more than
a week or two, nor would i tag my email with it, even in jest.  ?-)

More important is what my young son is doing in the house scene.  (As one of
the original Toontown DJs, and shepherding the that great underage scene,
Church, approaching 2 years, i can't image him a 2nd string DJ.)  But i know
his musical head, and i know the scene well.  I find the attempt to broaden
the musicality of house both socially and musically desireable.  I smile
dancing to the new blend of hiphop shit he brings to basic house beats.....
and i like seeing more than white people at raves.  (Though i never saw
many Tibetans show up at sharon after he unveiled his dance trak of the
Gyuto Monks, those 3-part harmony in one throat wonders.)

Luckily, this universe allows for lots of different taste.  Some folk can
appreciate diversity without having to dis something they don't like.

(Yeah, coming up next....trance gangsta.)

Peace

Mmmmmm.  How about being viewed with a sexual eye and as a human (ie, not an 
object) *at the same time*.  I hope it doesn't have to be one or the other....

Mark responded:

|to me.

It is indeed a harsh commentary. For the record, I would not say that I 
have never felt this way about a person (yes, man or woman); but nor do I  
always feel this way about men. This poem was meant to serve as a 
tidbit of interesting commentary in regard to Mykl's comments about the
word naaien meaning to fuck and/or to sew. I did not intend it to be a
flame, nor did I intend it as an accusation, nor criticism. However, I
will not, nor can I, speak for the intentions of Adrienne Rich. 
Personally, I very much enjoy conversations about word-play; especially 
when word-play meets sexual innuendo. As someone who has spent the past 
two years studying the space where philosophy meets literary theory meets 
feminist theory meets literature meets psychoanalytic theory meets 
linguistic constructions, well, what can I say; I live for this shit! 

Pat: 
> sent it, i'm glad someone pointedly critiqued it... so while my

> 

Mark:
|IMHO, apologies always help... :)

Then let me offer mine; I'm terribly sorry if I seemed to discourage 
the ongoing conversation; quite the contrary, I assure you; rather, I
celebrate it; after all, wasn't I the one who brought it up in the 
first place? The thought that a dialogue concerning sexism and raving
will be going into the archives of a computer absolutely thrills me,
despite whatever gets said. I'm glad that people aren't too worried
about offending me, not to say that any of you have (although, if you had,
I wouldn't tell you; much less would I flame you publicly; not my style).
Besides, I'm equally as happy to receive an opinion that I disagree with, 
as I am to receive one that accords with my own views. The only thing 
that I feel fairly certain about is that I don't know everything. Even
if I disagree, I still learn.

mark:

| but i think too much good-hearted, playful, flirtation
|gets turned into harrassment/violence against women.

Who is to judge the boundaries between playful flirtation and harassment?
me? you? the senate judiciary committee? hmm, i dunno.... When I think 
about assuming this responsibility, I cringe, because I know that I 
would be called an "uptight bitch" at least once a day for  the rest
of my life. And on some days, whoever said it would be right; yuck!

Mark:
|i hate nothing more than to see men treating women as sub-humans
|on the street or at a club.  once i had a ringing in my ears for over
|a month because some complete strangers on there way to a "disco/mini
|truck" club were ogling/shouting at some nearby girls, and i took it
|upon myself to remind them of what respect and politeness are.  they then
|proceeded to remind me what happens to people who don't mind their own 
|business (not meant as a sympathy getter). 

Sometimes seeing harassment happen is a way of experiencing it; there's
no doubt in my mind that men (all men, in fact, not just the one's who
get the shit beat out of them for speaking up; but also the harassers 
themselves) suffer some adverse effects from both the harssment of
and harassing women (not to mention suffering women's harassment of them).

Mark:
|...but, what ever happened to boyz and girlz (sorry, any of the sexes :)
|being able to flirt and be sexual with each other without someone getting 
|slapped with a law.suit?

ya know, I'm thinking about suing you just for asking that question
(toungue virtually jutting through cheek); but, really, Mark, this 
type of playfulness still exists, really, it does.

Mark:
| i mean who's to say that _I_ shouldn't be offended 
|that some girl is walking around topless, instead of her being offended that 
|i'm looking?

not me; only you have the right to decide what offends you. If a topless
woman offends you, then you will probably choose to do one of the following:
1. remove yourself from the situation.
2. ask her nicely to put her shirt back on, and tell her why you would 
   prefer it if she wasn't topless.

Here, you usually have to make a quick judgement call about the "unknowing
offender" (well, you gotta hope they aren't doing it on purpose). This is 
tricky, because it's usually someone you don't know. When someone is doing 
something that offends me (for the record, topless men, sweaty or not, do 
not offend me), I prefer to instigate the latter of the two choices listed 
above, when possible. For instance, if someone is gawking at me as if I 
were a piece of meat waiting to be put on a hook, I usually strut right 
over to her/him, extend my hand and say, "I saw you watching me; my name 
is Jocelyn." Presto magico! i've presented myself as a person rather than 
an object, and I've let that person know that there's to be no bullshit; 
I've also given him/her the opportunity to respond to me rather than my 
image; what's more, I've seen him/her up close in case I need to identify 
that person later, either to say hello or avoid them, etc... I think that's 
pretty good diplomacy.

Occasionally, if I've had to perform the above too many times in one 
evening, or if I'm just in a really bitchy mood (sometimes I am), I'll 
simply stop whatever it is that i'm doing (usually dancing); turn to 
the gawker; gaze at them; pan my eyes up and down their body (hands on 
hips); and then dis(and I do mean dis)miss them with a shrug. See how you 
like being treated as a disposable object! Right back at ya! A word of 
warning: people really do hate this, and if the gawker holds intimidation 
in his/her gaze rather than admiration, you risk escalating a potentially 
bad situation. Also, if you get called a cunt for doing this, just smile 
and say, "Honey, that's the one thing you got right;" then remove 
yourself immediately. 

As I mentioned before, you usually won't know who you're dealing with;
you might end up offending/hurting a really nice person(which really 
sucks), in which case you should try to make ammends, rather than 
walking away having hurt someone's feelings. Usually, if you just explain 
to him/her that you get harassed alot; and apologize for having mistaken 
their intent ("I didn't mean to be an uptight bitch, honest," works well); 
you can manage a quick patch job. Be sure to get this person's name and 
smile and say "hi" to them for the rest of the evening. He/She deserves 
that much for being the victim of your mistake.

By the way, I'm not talking about people who are just casually 
checking me out; enjoying me as one of the many visuals available 
(that's just fine by me); I'm refering to people who are encroaching 
upon my vibe/space by staring at me over a period of time. there's a 
point at which another persons gaze can feel prohibitive and confining 
(do you know what I mean?). I also don't mind it if people want to hold 
my hands; touch the fabric I'm wearing, maybe play with my hair a bit, 
kiss my cheek, etc...

situations in which you should remove yourself:

whenever you instinctively feel that you should, do.
whenever there is grabbing and/or groping involved; these people/this 
person does not respect you; they have clearly demonstrated that. If 
you so choose to try to nicely inform them that you would appreciate it 
if they wouldn't..., do not be surprised if they add insult to injury. If 
you try to talk to them, saying, "ya know, some women like that, but 
I don't;" seems to be the best line I've found. I guess it's believable, 
and then they aren't made to feel like criminals. 
whenever you just don't want to deal with it; walk away. Granted, turning 
the other cheek isn't going to change anyone's opinion; but sometimes 
enough's enough.
whenever you feel that you may be endangering yourself either 
emotionally or physically; walk.

Always remember: smiles and introductions solve many problems.

And another thing:
if you meet a cute, blunt-lipped, precious thing who hits all the 
right buttons; go for it!

these are some general guidelines that I've developed with respect 
to harassment protocol. I think they would work pretty well for either 
men or women (and I have seen men harass men many times; trying to 
pick a fight, etc...). it takes many years of using your instincts 
to be able to call a situation. I always try to give people a chance, 
a second chance, a third chance, whenever possible. On the other hand, 
it really does get old.

I've never written any of that down before, and now I feel overwhelmingly 
depressed. I know, I'll cheer up and end on an up note with....

The Best and Worse Pick-Up Lines that I've Heard on the Rave Scene Thus Far!

BEST:
"I know you may not like me now, but I'm drinking milk."

review: wholesome, witty, humble, non-assuming, sharp, slick:
where did he go?

WORST:
"I've been looking for a girl like you for a long time; 
you sport the killer style."

review: well, it did make me laugh, and it was a shade off boring...

BTW, anything that starts with
"Hey, baby,..." usually doesn't count as a pick-up line.

Yours in the hermeneutics of love-

Jocelyn

As one who enjoys both raving and biasfree but lively

as the Ms. Manners of the Rave Set.  This is no fame
but a commendation.  I wanted to get this in before Brian
gets nervous or even bitchy (there's an acid test [no

I never get bitchy... nervous maybe, but never bitchy.  I certainly
think Jocelyn's post (and yours) was relavant enough for the list.
I think maybe posts like the origin of the word F.U.C.K. might have
been inappropriate, but who am I to say?  Actually, more than a few
people have suggested to me that it's my role to steer conversation
on sfraves; I don't think I'd go that far, but sometimes it seems
necessary to aim a few slings to the list.

Basically, I think you should say to yourself before posting to
the list, is this something that the majority (or even a sizeable
minority) of the readers want to read, can get any ounce of information
from.  Now of course Jon will come back at me and say guidelines are
meant to be broken :)  Just keep in mind why most people subscribed,
and that there are 200 people on the list who DON'T post.  As the volume
gets higher, even if the signal-to-noise ratio remains the same each 
individual message will have a smaller impact.  So in this case, less
is more.  In other words, each message on a 60-message-a-day mailing
list is going to have a smaller voice than one on a two-or-three-messages-
a-day list, even if the quality is the same...

Subject: Future Forum review continued


A little background:
	i'm _really_ psyched about the whole Future Forum Collective project.
i'm beginning to get into visuals, and this collective is exactly the kind of
thing i've been looking for to share what skills and equipment i have and in
turn learn from others.
  
From Paul T. :
From: ???
Date: ???
Subject: ???

i guess that would be me.  Moved some stuff in Friday, and i'm moving in the
rest as soon as more secure locks are put in (hopefully by next week).



Now the review:
	So i got to the warehouse Friday around 10, right behind the sound
system van.  Mark (of Ameba and the instigator of the Future Forum project)
was there with a number of others cleaning the place up.  Set up some
rotating lights and background lights in the dance area, and some UV tubes
over black light artwork that others were hanging up.
	By midnite i was getting pretty nervous as very few people were there,
and almost no-one was dancing.  i think everyone was up in the chill-space
to keep warm, as the dance floor was unheated.
	Gradually more people showed up, and i started loosening up and 
putting up some more lights.  For some reason i really enjoy setting up 
stuff _during_ a party rather than before -- maybe it's having a bunch of
people around enjoying themselves, or maybe it's the sort of gradual rise
effect as more and more stuff gets going as the party progresses, probably
both.  Anyway, with some friends i started wandering through the building
adding color filters here and there.  Nice blue orb above entry door for
initial ambiance.  Most of the main floor of the warehouse was dark, as the
dance floor was in back, separated by hanging carpets.  So we set a strobe up
along the back wall of the main floor.  Worked _really_ well.  The way the
2nd floor is supported sort of creates a corridor effect down the whole
back length of the main floor, and with the strobe going... well, i guess
you had to be there, but it was my favorite toy of the night!
	Back to the chill-space.  Bout a month ago some friends and i had
made our first foray into trippy slides, just going through some nice
fractal/kalaidoscope/biology calendars and books for material.  So we set up
a slide projector on auto-advance and projected our stuff onto about a
20 x 15 foot chunk of wall in the chill-space.  i'd only seen the slides
before projected much smaller -- i really liked them blown up big.  Now i'm
psyched to get more projectors.  Saw Donovan (visuals guy) there and talked
to him 'bout equipment -- ouch, i guess the nice projector controllers/cross-
faders are kinda expensive.  Anybody out there modified there own projectors
to do this cheaply?  Anyway, it was a great feeling to see people tripping
out to our slides.
	Let's see, what else.  Mirror ball with blue and red spots on the
2nd floor space above the main floor, an old effect but still a good one i
think.  Not many people hanging out there, but was a lot of fun watching
some of them chase the little blue and red dots around the floor in circles
(and joining in).  Finally, got a little low-power laser w/ speaker optics
set up in one of the dark rooms off the chill space (what do you call a chill
room for the chill room? 2nd order chill? chill^2? freeze?).  Was about 4:30 
by then.  Decided to relax and enjoy the rest of the night as a civilian.  
Dance, dance, dance. Occasionally tweak lights on the dance floor.  Then 
settled down with friends in the chill space till the sun came up and beyond. 
Guess we left around 9.
	So i'd guess attendance 'round 200-300.  By about 3 things were
feeling really good, vibe on (i may be a little biased here, but i was
unbiAsEd so i claim at least some objectivity).  Maybe 150 people tops
at peak on dance floor.  But because the dance area was a small section in the
back of the warehouse, this was a nice number.  50 more dancing would of
become crowded.  Fortunately, if there are bigger events there's plenty of
room to expand the dance area. My friends who helped with some of the lights
had a great time too.  Two are definitely coming to the Future Forum Wednesday
meeting.  Another, who's been to two previous raves, said she finally felt
like she'd been to her first real rave (definitely Got It).  And for the
fourth it was his first rave ever and he's really psyched for more (well okay,
they were all a little biasEd).
	Only sfraver i recognized was larry (your girlfriend was right, the
pulsations coming up from the dance floor were a nice sonic massage, 
especially in the darkened 2nd order chill spaces, no distractions just the 
vibrations...)  To others that were there, sorry if i didn't recognize y'all,
but i was running around in overdrive most of the time, all the faces were
a blur.
	But i met _tons_ of new people!  And a lot of them are interested
in the collective.  And i felt i had something both to share and to learn
from many of them.  From the person who is setting up an oxygen-therapy
clinic (i'm skeptical, but i was able to share some references with him),
to the flyer artist who's interested in scanning some of my slides, to the
guy who did some of the black-light art, who's been doing live painting at
raves and is wanting to combine his live painting with projection visuals
(which i think could work out _really_ well).  Lots of people interested in
synergetic interactions with others, the kind of experiences that i see as
the heart of a collective.
	Let's see, what else? Oh, music.  OK, little confession here, i'm
pretty easy musically.  All right, clueless.  So ask somebody else, cause it
almost always sounds good to me.  My friends really liked Simon's stuff.
	Umm, did i mention what a great time i had?
	

	Weekly Future Forum meeting is tonight (Wednesday) again, starting
around 9.  Last couple times it's been a cross between organizational meeting 
and chill space.  Turntables going whole time (um, i forget who was spinning, 
did i mention i'm musically inept?), turned down a bit for the organizational 
part, interesting ideas, interesting people.  i'll try to bring some toys
this time too :).  Hope to see some of ya there.

					gregg

P.S.  Oh yeah, finding terminals is still a high priority for the collective.
	Anybody out there got any ideas on finding free/cheap XTs or anything
	else that'll emulate vt100 across a modem?

about $15. We saw it for $10 at Haight-Ashbury! :)
	And it has 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music on it.

-   after the fact by testing hair.  Something like at least 1 week after
-   using LSD and no more than 6 months since using it (after that time
-   frame, all the hair which was present when the LSD was in the body has
-   been shed.)
-
-   Anyone have more specific info?  I've heard rumors of a blood test

-   hours, but isn't any good after that.

-   Bob
	LSD is a fragile molecule. Most all of it is metabolized within 1/2-1
hours after ingestion. It might be detectable in hair. I've heard that this is
true. Your hair is as old as it is long. Mine is mid-back, and about 4-5 years
old. 
	Not sure about spinal taps. I hear rumors, but I've never seen evidence
to support that they can find LSD. As I say: "They aren't GETTING a spinal tap
from me. Period. No job is worth that. Spinal taps HURT."

Subject: rave & relationships questionnaire

Hi.  I am gathering information for an article I want to write for a
rave-related magazine some friends of mine are starting in the US.  The 
article is going to be on raving and romantic relationships.

If you like, please fill out the following questionnaire and return it to
laura@usl.com .  All information will be kept confidential.  

Also, if your boyfriend/girlfriend is not on the net, could you let them
use your account to answer the questionnaire, too?  Don't worry, I won't
be cross-referencing answers between couples . . . I just want to get as any 
people to give me input as possible!

For those of you new to email/news, recall that there is a difference 
between "reply to sender only" and "reply to list."  In my mailer, for 
example, 'R' goes to sender only, and 'r' goes to everyone.  Similarly, 
my news reader takes "r" for "reply through email" and "f" for "reply 
through the newsgroup."  Please be aware of these conventions when you
reply so as to assure confidentiality -- in other words, if you mess up 
and accidentally post to the list or the news group, then it's your fault 
not mine.

Aside from publishing the article in the magazine, I will also post a
copy of it to this list/newsgroup.

This questionnare was cross-posted to sfraves, uk-rave, ne-raves, socal-raves, 
dcrave, mw-raves, fl-raves, alt.rave, and rec.music.misc .  So, it is possible
that you will see multiple copies of this.  Sorry for the redundancy, but
that's what you get for being subscribed to multiple lists! :-)

Thanks,

I'd like to know as well.  Maybe the person(s) answering could also recommend
a record store or two (unless it's one of the usual places: BPM, etc.)

Also, what exactly is "deep" house??  (I don't think it's in the FAQ.)  
Someone told me that it's what they play in the "deep" of the night, like 
trance, etc.

And while I'm at it....  You know that section of the FAQ that talks about 
music types????  I would recommend something a bit more descriptive and/or
a list a characterizing traits and/or a longer list of examples.  A couple 
of people I know that are rave-ignorant (in terms of what the different
kinds of music are) basically came away saying, "huh?".  (Not that I could do
any better!)

Just my dos pesos.

> (As one of

I think in many people's minds, Garth and Jeno, along with a few select others
(I currently like Jon Williams and Spun a lot) are the top of the line, and
anyone else is considered 2nd string.  Buck does have his moments, but he 
doesn't move the crowd as *consistently* as Garth and Jeno do.  (i.e. Buck's
hit-to-miss ratio is less than Garth's or Jeno's.)

I've heard Buck play a few killer sets.  (At Church once, I heard him mix
the intro of Herbie Hancock's "Rockit" into a fierce techno track and thought 
the mix was both original and well-executed.)  But I've also heard him play
sets that didn't quite thrill me.  If you read all of the comments about Buck
that have been made on sfraves in the past month or two, you will find
some constructive criticism: the hip-hop stuff (what he played at Groove
Kitchen) works the crowd and goes over well; some of the other stuff (what he
played at DNA on New Years Day) doesn't go over too well, so he might consider
re-thinking or even axe-ing that part of his set.

I agree.  This is what a lot of people like about Spun, too.

The Tibetans probably heard that Sharon is run by irresponsible slimeball
promoters and decided not to spend $20 on a rave that has an 80% chance of
getting shut down before 2am.

"god's personal DJ" is a private joke that i have no desire to explain
on the list.  and what kind of "inimitable credentials" do i have to
produce before i am a certified Beautiful Person and thus qualified to
comment on DJing?

what exactly *is* he doing, anyway?

>I smile dancing to the new blend of hiphop shit he brings to basic
>house beats.....

"new blend"?  this stuff was strictly ancient, with samples that had
been around the musical track more than a few times.  not that i
minded at all - it made a refreshing change from the rigid stomping
techno beat that preceded it.  i like that hip hop swing more now than
ever.  but don't delude yourself - people like Spun were doing that
kind of thing in this area years ago.  (and we'll completely avoid
mentioning NYC where this sort of thing has been happening since the
dawn of time, or so it seems.)  just because a few of the leading
lights of the san francisco DJ community have seized upon hip hop as a
way to get us all out of the techno rut doesn't make it innovative.

i suppose you also think that if you don't have something nice to say,
you shouldn't say anything at all.  that just doesn't wash for me.

heard good things about Sasha for a long time and have wanted to check him out)
and maybe for Happy Happy Joy Joy (I haven't heard Carlos in a long while, and
HHJJ have a reputation for being easy on the ol pocketbook).  But if I could

Hi Gang--

I want to thank Brian for focusing me a bit more
again on the overall view of sfraves and its 300
or so folx out there who are potential and real 
posters here.


I never promised you a rose garden.

World's second most effusive blabber,

P.S. The above was returned to me (karma for my dogma?)
from the Mailer-Daemon as Returned Mail with Host
Unknown, so I knew from THAT that I had gone a bit
too far.  I admit that I put in little zingers every
now and then to see how someone responds.  In this case
I liked Brian's response better than my zinger.

An issue of High Times (which I have if anyone is curious) about a year
ago features Cypress Hill and the centerfold is step-by-step instructions
on how to role a blunt.  After this issue I personaly saw this
phenomenon occur on the west coast several times.|-)


Also:

My friend wants to know who does that Armagedon song (if you know the song that should be
description enough) so I told him I'd ask.  Not one of my personal faves.

And:

I heard this cool song of Pygmys in Africa and they were using a "water drum"
which was basicaly cuped hands rythmicly slapping water and it was so cool.
You'd here the deep thunk sound of the hand going under and then the splash of
it and then the splash of it coming back up and it was so tight.  It almost
sounded like somone swimming perfectly or something.

Furthermore:

I saw this stupid TV show yesterday (In my roomates room while I was visiting, I swear I
don't even watch it otherwise, I only get chanel 5 on mine, I swear,|-) and I got this
idea from it.  They did the Limbo.  That'd be cool at a rave.  Especialy with Carlos
spinning.

This is true, even ravers have to have their idols.  Yes, there are DJs
with recognizable talent.  Nevertheless, there have been times when Jeno
has bored me, perhaps it was my mood, perhaps he was having a bad day.
There have also been DJs from other regions who have blown me away,
and sometimes it was only because the music they played was different
and fresh.  IMNSHO, the 1st & 2nd string stuff is silly, and to me, a 
bit out of place in the egoless communal experience the I used to think
raving was about.

> Buck does have his moments, but he 
> doesn't move the crowd as *consistently* as Garth and Jeno do.  (i.e. Buck's

As one who has criticized Buck on the list, I generally agree with this
statement, although I have found Garth to be rather dull that last couple
of times I've experienced him.  And yet, I wonder how many whip themselves
into a frenzy just *because* they hear "the drummer gets wicked" and know
its Jeno.  It's all so subjective.

And yet there were people dancing to it, perhaps even preferring a more
laid back energy level the morning after NYE.  It just wasn't for me.  I'm
not sure this makes him "2nd string".

BTW, am I the only one who thinks that it is really lame for the closing
DJs to go through the encore ritual where the crowd shouts for more and
we wait for one or two more records to be played.  I mean, throw a fuckin'
record on the turntable or get off the stage, I can do without the dramatics.
I would find it more psychologically pleasing if the closing DJ just picked
some appropriate tunes to closed the party, perhaps something ambient to
bring us down.

Subject: Acid House

After hearing the Blow track on the Rabbit City release (w/horns and Africa
Bambattaa samples), I couldn't help from thinking: didn't it sound vaguely
familiar?  Well the "Planet Rock" samples aside, Blow released a handful of
singles in 88/89 with his characteristic horn work and lo and behold I have
one of these.  Now this didn't kick in my obsession but it certainly fueled
it.  Does anyone know where I can get acid-house records from 88/89?  Their
is a simplicity and effectiveness even in the Todd Terry/Frankie Bones
material that seems to have run dry in so many of the tracks I come across
today.  Thanks

REPLY TO 01/13/93 17:31 FROM lxfogel@srv.pacbell.com "Lee Fogel": Re: 2nd
string DJs

i have to agree with the lee on not wanting to go through the
hierarchy of second and first string DJs, largely cause i/m a fourth
string DJ, actually that/s not true - crowds respond to me like {hey
that/s really phat shit you/re playing, we/d be in a frenzy if you
could mix}..... i/m working on it.

i think some DJs can for a certain crowd and moment in time catch on
a groove and work with it, but as far as technique goes i think the
distinction becomes a much harder one to follow. Jeno and Garth/s
big success now is relative to a. their choice in music, b. their
ability to create soundscapes, and perhaps most importantly c.
inertia. because few people know what an impossible mix sounds like
when done well, the going flow is to believe the hype.... i don/t
really think most people on the dance-floor, although knowlegable
about the music, are knowledgeable about the talent it takes to
spin. even when i/m on the dancefloor, i don/t have the multitasking
capabilities to concentrate on anything other than choice...

this is my definition of a 2nd string DJ:

the other day i saw a new pevy mixer with {beat} lights on each
channel, so you could visually match beats.... ughhhhh!!!

well having started raving a few years ago, I've watched the rave seen decline
ill devote a lot of my time listening to new tracks and seing what would be a good rave or nightclub to goto.But when you get your hopes up about a rave which  costs 25 pounds or roughly $40 and says it is in a warehouse you expect it.
And 25.000 people,well we all turned up to find a one and a half mile que rain 

 




tabbings have happened,And most of the DJ's have got the flu or had better sense not to come well that was my worst time at a rave,
well i live in a little town called luton that is about 30miles from london,
lutons night life is'nt saying a oner,but every saturday at i'ver woodside 
estate or craddock rd,these are the meeting points for exodus a totally free
rave laying down the lasted hardcore/jungle.

well i'm sorry if there is any mistakes but i was in a rush the word with more than one meaning.

Subject: sexism in the Ethernet

well since i usually tend to post long rather than a lot
and this happens to be something that facinates me thoroughly
i must go off on this

as a male i have always thought that i was never really that bad
about being sexist or acting disgusting
i always thought that the way i acted was usually fine
and i thought that womens lib and all that shit was ridiculous
and way out of control

first i started paying more attention to myself
i would catch myself talking more to a womans breasts
than to her face... i was rather upset with myself about this
but it seemed to be quite a surprisingly natural reaction
i really dont believe any of the women i did that to put up with it
but i guess its that or have no conversations at all with men

then i started dealing with e-mail
well i was dating a female that i met on a bbs and would go over and
read her mail over her shoulder
she would get 5-10 messages a day with guys asking her out or
asking to have sex with her
some things were annoying becuz i was being jealous but were fine
'gee.. i would really like to talk to you, you sound interesting'
but then there was shit like
'would you like to see how big my dick is'
and 
'hey babe... wanna go for some REAL e-sex?'

and myself and a few other guys who were dating women on this bbs
took it upon ourselves to answer some of the mail for them
it usually turned into a 
'man.. chill.. i was just joking around'
'yeah... nice joke.. really fucking funny that you like to 
describe my girlfriends genitalia like that'

that really opened up my eyes alot so that later on
i was walking with someone who i know is very sexually attractive
adn tends to wear 'slutty' clothes, but she does so in the sense
of why the fuck should i have to wear something i dont feel
comfortable in just because some guy is going to be an asshole about it

i walked her to the store one time and every fucking guy we passed leered
at her (she was wearing a t-shirt and jeans, not really scantily clad or anything) 
i dont know why, but i was getting really fucking pissed off
i just wanted to reach into one of the cars that would slow down
to check her out and just beat the shit out of the guy

funny thing is.. i would probably do the same thing as said guys
if i saw some other girl on the street
but yet i still find it offensive... uyeah i confuse myself

the OTHER thing that helped me realize all this shit
is that i ahppen to have a name that a lot of females have
in the Net, fingering doesnt tell you what sex i am
i get lots of e-mail from guys trying to pick up on me
and quite frankly i get pissed off by most all of it
mostly because they never even say anything interesting enough
that i would want to actually start a conversation with them
on one bbs a lot of people thought i was female because
i was in a major feminist mode when i logged on and 
started batting down sexist comments with the rest of the women
and it was an interesting role playing game to see how long it could last

i think i posted somethign about my pierced genitalia
that kinda blew that idea out of the water, but still

men disgust me
i disgust me, but what scares the hell out of me is that
i know i am one of the good ones and i know how disgusting i am

as far as raves go...
a lot of women tend to go scantily clad
why? cuz its fucking hot dancing in a warehouse with twice
as many people as there should be and no water!!!!
some want to be stared at, others want to be cool (temp. wise)
how do you tell the difference?
dont... it doesnt fucking matter
i dont think its bad to look, although it could probably get annoying
but that IS a natural reaction.. no big deal
like phoebe sed... look, dont touch unless otherwise indicated
i dont go to clubs to pick up on women
but i would probably rather date someone from a 'rave'
than someone at random, we have something to talk about
and probably have similar ideals
of course i have the benefit of being attracted to personalities
and other physical things than just the size of someone's breasts
but they are more physical things that are part of their personality
although im not saying that a society imposed defintion of a gorgeous
woman doesnt attract me, but i do honestly think that the two
biggest physical attractions for me are:
A) the way someone dances
B) body piercings/tattoos
either gender... those are the things that i find attractive physically
then it goes to things like eyes, breasts etc...

i think that is something that i have as an advantage
cuz a lot of people of either gender that i know seem to
have a problem with be only sexually attracted to people
by their physical attractiveness 


personally i think the solution to it all is that women
and men should trade places in some way
and see how the other lives

(and e-mail is one way to do it, at least for men)
(being open and able to talk seriously with people of the opposite gender
helps too... i also tend to get along with enough females closely that 
i get their reactions towards males in a less biased way
because they really dont consider me to be a male, just a friend
i think it has a lot to do with being able to look at a male
and discuss his sexual qualities at their level
ie yeah hes cute.. but i could never stand talking with him for more than
5 minutes.. maybe if he kept his mouth shut i could fool around with him)

the only i cant figure out right now though
is why in all the relationships that i and my friends are in
the women want to just fool around and the guys want commitment
its kinda annoying.. it would be so much better
if people just stuck to being their stereotypical selves

also...

im really unhip on gay/lesbian culture...
and this whole topic seems rather breeder-centered
do gays check each other out in the same way
het guys check out women?
just curious

Bzzzzt!!!
Blunts are very popular on the east coast, and indeed came from the african
american community there (esp. New York City). The reason that they are
called blunts is that the preferred size of philly is the one called
...you guessed it... BLUNT (as opposed to Philly Titans, etc...). I first
heard about them 3 years ago when I started going out with a girl from
Brooklyn, and thought it sounded like the coolest thing. Later, on one of
my pilgrimages to NYC I smoked out a blunt and dum da da dummmmm - on one hand 
it is just one of those pot smoking rituals (smoking a J, doing Bong hits 
while watching Ren and Stimpy or the Simpsons, hash unda a damn glass, smoking 
a hooka with the merchants who close their stands down just for that afternoon
bzzzzzzzz, giving a shotgun hit to your best mates, sharing a bowl at a view
at sunset with coolcat Kuba.. sigh..), on the other hand - oh how I love those
rituals. Your mileage may vary, esp if you avoid tobacco and have no tolerance
for it. Oh yeah, california green wouldn't go well in a blunt, but roll up
the sensei, the stanky buddha, or that dreaded mex for a cool one.
Name check: Phirst Blunt ref in a rap song would probably be
Brand Nubian 'Slow Down' (1990?)
"A forty and a blunt
  thats all she really wants"

In the olden days, (shelly's seafood salad, e is for everybody, etc..) at the
end of the party they would play this record of crickets chirping.. It was
very soothing and it was a really positive way to end a party (as opposed
to just shutting down, or the stormtrooperrs stomping in and busting the 
place up). Some of my other fave rave endings were vision: when the beat
stopped, there was a fairly large drum circle that ended the trip with
groovy bongo beats. At one of the candlestick full moons (3 years ago? sheesh!)
they came on with the rub-a-dub feel good old stylee reggae vibes as the sun
rose. It was lovely.

What I would do: Slam on Roy Ayers "Everyone loves the Sunshine", Followed by
Leo's Sunshipp "Just give me the Sunshine" two of my favorite rare groove
happy sunshine songs. To me, the way the rave ends is just as important as
the rest of it... The party is an entire experience from when you walk in the
door, step out onto the floor, and finally walk out into the sun (or rain!)
with huge glowing eyes and an ear to ear grin. 
Loveyou
P.S. Is there any way to get dj mixes at a reasonable price? I just won't pay
15 bux for the damn things, no matter how godlike the mix is. (well, except 
for bang the drum, which is wicked indeed!). I would pay 15 bux for a mix
on DAT, though.. oh yeah, blank tapes cost 10 bux.. nevermind.. make that 20.
P.S.2. What ever happened to Pete Avila - one of the people who helped get this
whole thing together?

a big affair.  there will be music, probably dub, techno, hip-hop, and 
alternative.  basically, whatever gets popped on at the time.  the crowd will
be mixed, alternative /slash/ ravers  and a few "dirtheads" (for lack of a
better, more descriptive, less offensive word.  though the term was self
imposed by them, in this case).  it will be mostly from 21-27 year olds
and it starts at about 9, probably.

Ah, no.  Although we've all heard jokes and funny and not-so-funny stories about

people about other groups of people.  If I was a woman reading this that was as
clueless about men as you seem to be about women and womens' issues I might think
that what you were saying above was a given, mutualy aknowldeged fact that men's
eyes and womens breasts are magnets of opposite polarity.

Ooops.  What's the benefit?  What's the dif if I like breasts (or just nude
womens bodies in general) and you like piercings and tattoos or dancing (sexualy 
provocative!  Oh No!)?  I just don't get it.  Why does everyone think that to
like (or in my case even be obsessed with a womens' body) that that goes hand

<stuff about a woman sounding like most men deleted>

>Draw yer own conclusions :-)


I conclude  (you did say to share them once drawn, didn't you?  :-)
that:


-there is no difference between women and men other than
 the physiological ones and the behavioral ones that are
 naturally resultant.

-that all people will tend to ignore the above and blame the
 other sex for the facts of life that they don't like

-that the things we like about life (inc. love and sex) are
 the same things we dislike

-that there is no good or bad or right or wrong, there is only "I
 like" and "I don't like".

-that _ALL_ judgement is borne of insecurity.


And I'll throw in a thought which is not yet a conclusion of
mine but rather a suspicion:

-that there is nothing "wrong" with the world or anything in it,
 but rather when one complains that there is, it is that one
 who has a problem, not the world or that part of it which
 is being accused.

I apologize that I was a little upset in public 
in my reply to dkl (SIC ?), but
the "looking sexy = sex object" attitude scares and upsets me.
I have a friend who was raped many years ago by a man in a bar. he gained
entry to her home, destroyed her car + phone to stop her from getting
help, raped her and left. The rape crisis people + others that were supposed
to help her told her she was asking for it, because he got into her house.
She had been drinking, but she wasn't dressed particularly provocatively.
I know other women that were sexually harassed, the men 
always say that because the woman looked a particular way, she was
a sex object and asking for it. Some man some years ago tried to justify
rape because his victim wasn't wearing panties as if it's his business.

Off my soap box, I will keep quiet now.

Dj one might try referring to th interview with Tony Humphries in the Nov. 
or Dec. issue of S.I.N.MIX magazine; he, the Dj's Dj, recommends that a Dj 
not be afraid to clear the dance floor trying new things.  I can't ever 
remember a time when I've seen Buck clear a dance floor.  I don't want to 
take anything away from the skill of Garth or Jeno.  Jeno can play it all, 
but what go to hear him for is the trip.  Presonally I think his best sets 
are at Housing Project on Wednesday nights.  I suggest if you want to hear 
the best in mixing and remixes look for Masters at Work, Todd Terry or David 
Morales.  What I think is that they're never mentioned because they're not of 
the Anglo persuasion.  Funny how House didn't reach mainstream until they 
started listening to it in England.  I hate to flame but I had to speak my 
peace and vent my frustrations with the condescending attitudes that go towards
people who really know what's up.  By the way Halim and the Sharon crew are 
no more shady than the next promoter, it comes with the territory.

Subject: Deep Space Wins.

Normally I am too busy working to go out during hte weeknight but because of my
skiing endeavors I have needed a mid Week Music and Dancing Fix. So this week I
went to both Housing Project and Deep Space.

Housing project was ok I was to found of the music I found it hard to get in
the groove there and the people didnt seem very freindly.  However I really
enjoyed dancing on the outside deck in the rain, I have been wanting to do that
all week.

Last night I went down to Deep Space, It was great, MoonPup was laying down
some really grooving Tunes (I really like his style anyways).  The Back room
was a real cool place to get away from the crowd and do a little cool down
dancing.  Most people seemed really cool and It also seemed like there were
alot of Altered people there (This crowd probably completely different
otherwise)  

It came to my realization that it was still a bar though when I came up to some
guy and asked him his name and said he looked familiar.  He looked at me and
said I dont know you sternly and turned back towards the bar.  Someother people
were very cold when I introduced myself.  

I saw Pat there, Cool Hat but what happened I thought you were going to spin in
the backroom.  I also saw Joe there and he had on a Pale Blue liezure suit.

 Peace and Love

Subject: re:2nd string Djs

Hmm... about 6 months ago I was seriously considering trying to break into
DJ'ing here - I had just got a pair of 1200s, and since I've been really
really into music for so long I had a decent collection of music and I 
thought it wouldn't be too hard to break in... I had been a "DJ" for schools
and stuff for about 4 years (high school dances, parties, weddings even)
and even though I was just learning how to beat-match (haha) I thought that
I really had a chance.  Then after going to more raves, meeting more people,
etc., it dawned on me how much raw talent there is here in the area; it makes
it extremely difficult to break in as a new DJ and whip up a storm.  Even 
though you'd only thin that there were three of four DJ's in the whole bay
area if you listen to sfraves, I would say there are maybe 10-15 DJ's out
here whose mixing I've danced to and thoroughly enjoyed, and maybe another
dozen who are mentioned on flyers every now and then that I know other people
like.  So I sorta decided to toss the idea of rave DJ'ing (though I am 
really starting to think about ambient room DJ'ing).  

I should probably also say I was more impressed with the music in the second
warehouse at the Gathering NYE, with all the "unknown" DJ's, than I was in
the main room with Jeno, Garth, Spun et al.  Even if their beatmatching
slipped a couple of times they played some wonderful stuff and did have a
good sense of "music progression" from one hour to the next.  And people
like Moonpup are great every fucking time, just for some reason there's no
name recognition from the majority of the ravers...

So why are Garth and Jeno so highly lauded?  I think part of it is inertia - 
people hear them do a good set and when it comes time to make a choice of
raves they'll go with the familiar names.  Jeno has a terrific song selection
but he doesn't do anything other than beat-match from one song into the next;
and neither he nor Garth have changed much in their set since Vision in 
September.  In a word, reliability.  Which is a shame, since I think new
talent should be given a chance all the time.  But the rave promoters know
they need to get one or two "big names" on their bill if they're going to
hope to get more than a few hundred people.

I had a GREAT time at GLobal Rhythm Fest, and I had never heard most of
the DJ's there (and rediscovered Doc Martin! Yay!).  And frankly, I'm
getting a little sick of the Garth/Jeno axis... :)

(for anyone who's joined since September or so)

Connection was a rave that the people on this list threw as a collective on
Bonny DOon beach just north of Santa Cruz on August 20th.  It was an 
incredible night for most of us who went, because it was the first time
any of us had done anything like this and it went (almost) perfectly.  The
video itself was shot by a non-sfraver who also goes out to other raves and
films them too; it's about half an hour long, unedited, and a great memory
of the event for me (though if you weren't there it might seem a wee bit
confusing).

Josh - always consistent, but usually fails to excite me.  He gets
into heavy trancy grooves that just don't make me move.  On the other
hand, he kicked some serious butt wednesday night at housing project.
I was *very* impressed.

James - heard him twice.  first time he was a god, spinning fierce
acid tracks.  second time he was incredibly lame, spinning crappy
house records and mixing badly.

Alfie - heard him twice, again.  first time real good.  last time not
so good.

brits in general - obviously it's stupid to generalize.  DJing is an
intensely personal bizness and every DJ has his or her own style.  but
the one DJ who has made my brain blister and melt in the past few
months is Jon Williams, who is very good and very english.  he also
has one of the most unique record collections in existence...

definitely agree.  at housing project, jeno played an incredibly lame
track to end the whole thing - a really silly attempt at techno salsa.
it sounded like something you might hear coming out of a casio home
keyboard.

after that rather putrid track, the lights came on and the host
announced the after party.  end of story.

I have traditionally been more interested in the brains than the body,
I have dated some "geeks" in my time that some of my friends would laugh at,
because they impressed me with their math/physics/creative abilities.
But at the same time, I enjoy looking at beautiful things, and there
are certain parts of a male's physique I like more than others,
I don't make it obvious and they are not criteria for friendships or otherwise.
I don't see why anyone should feel bad about what they are attracted to,
there is always someone else in the world that feels the same way and they
would be a good match, as long as no one gets forced to do anything 
they didn't want and sensitivity/compassion are inherent in the relationship.

>
>personally i think the solution to it all is that women
>and men should trade places in some way
>and see how the other lives

Most of my friends are male because of all the activities I do, because
of that I see a lot of things from the male point of view: Consoling male
friends that break up with their girlfriends and be on their side.
Talking about prospects and weighing different attributes, etc.
When I hang out with men as one of them, I carry my own weigh; occasionally
I get the "Are you OK?", "Is this too hard for you?" from men that didn't
know me, but then I'd show them and they would shut up after that. Some
women would get offended, but these men are just trying to take care of
me because I am the size of a 12 year old, they didn't mean to be
condescending or to hurt me in any way. I tried to look at the motive in
these situations, "Is the person trying to compromise me for their personal
gain or is he/she just inept in expressing good intentions?", I don't think
people should be penalized for good intentions, they should be educated
 but not shunned. 
So far in relationships, I find men easier to understand than women.
Society has made the role of being a woman so complicated that it's hard
to know what to want. I have a friend who is working on her Phd, She likes
being attractive, it makes her feel good, but it also makes her male
colleagues treat her like a bimbo. All sorts of desirable stuff are
mutually exclusive to women, but not to men. There is so much more expectation
from women than from men.

Yes, more so than heteros in clubs anyway, because now there is no fear
 of sexism, everyone is equal. I find homosexuals to be more relaxed
 about their sexuality than heteros: They flirt in the most outrageous
 manner.

I know I'm repeating myself....  I'd like to think that when I dress sexy,
I'm viewed as a sexy person, not a sexy object. I don't like being object-
ified and it happens to me.  On the other hand, being objectified is a 
turn on for some people and I can see where objectifing someone can be a 
turn on.  But it has to be consensual.

Btw, all this talk about SEX is driving me CRAZY!  I guess that means that
I'll have to dance twice as *hard* to relieve the tension!  :-)

With total respect to your point of view, Jai, I can take both sides of
this issue.  Fact is that there is a natural human tendency to see greener
grass on the other side of whatever (the Atlantic in this case), and I
can't deny a certain Anglophilic bias in myself (since childhood) and many
others around me.  But keep in mind that factor operates the other way, too;
a lot (though certainly not all) of English and Europeans glorify any
cultural product of the U.S. regardless of it's quality -- witness how
popular American beer is these days in the U.K. (never could figure that
one out) and the popularity of trashy TV programs like Dallas...

Still, on any given night, you'll hear me singing the praises of Spun,
Josh, Moonpup, or whomever above and beyond Jeno and Garth -- although it
can't be denied those two have had their godlike sets at times.

> I suggest if you want to hear

Those three artists you name all have staked their claim in my heart and
record collection.  Not to mention the Detroit crew.  And some of the best
sets I've ever heard were played by Rassoul and Brennan at the Top.

It is shameful that these sounds would have drowned in obscurity if not
for the Brits "discovering" them (kinda like Columbus in America?).  But
they didn't take the groove and mimic it, but they created something new
and took it to another level -- not necessarily better, but different and
to me, at least, interesting.

These days, I don't traffic in gross generalizations about 'x' is better
than 'y', in terms of styles or countries of origin.  I find quality
music where I find it, and an awful lot of trash as well.

We had a lecture/seminar thing o'er here at UCSC. It was enjoyable and somewhat
informative, although the info was a bit skewed. The speaker Bruce Eisner was
interesting to say the least, a typical sentance was like "...um, and this is, 
um, when I, um, the ideas I, um, formuated when I was, uh...on shrooms..."
And I am _NOT_ exaggerating. This guy was a good example of what can happen when
a person takes a few too many drugs. 
He was starting a group that'll be called ISLAND GROUP (named after Aldus Huxley book, Island) and is trying to form a psychedellic society, or at least model
one. Sound's interesting. 
	Timothy Leary should be lecturing here in March, if anyone's interested...and strangely enough, there was some guy that looked just like him at the
seminar.
	It was interesting, but I still have a question...What does E do to the
spinal fluids. Bruce said it didn't do anything, but this was after he avoided
answering the question about three or four time. He also said that E doesn't
even enter the spinal system (OR LSD either) Which I doubted because I always
thought that was where the drug took its effect. Ahhh...I'm confused, anyone
got an answer???

Hi Brian and Gang--

Somebody--not me--sent out a message about Bruce
Eisner's talk last night at UCSC on Understanding
Ecstasy: from Psychotherapy to the Hip Rave Culture.
It was a sell-out plus audience of 450 or so and a
resposive group indeed.  Bruce was in topnotch form!
Look for the second edition of his Ecstasy: the MDMA
Story in April, thoroughly updated!

The Tim Leary reference was evidently to an upcoming
event, also sponsored by Island Group and its campus
affiliate, Millbrook West, of Dr. Timothy Leary, with
Genesis P-Orridge, and hyperdelic video, on February 26
at UC Santa Cruz.  Look for more info to come.  It'll
be a Saturday night--and perhaps there'll be a good Santa 
Cruz rave to follow.

Local folks here like myself will be happy to host
wandering ravers!

World's second most leary raver,
Will

Subject: Re; Bruce's Umms and Stefan's Spinal Fluid

Hi Stefan--

I read your review of Bruce Eisner's talk and
I must say that you were too hard on him.  First,
the umms were *not* that pronounced, except at
first for someone who was still getting used
to the speaker.  I know a lot of public speakers--
some of them politicians who one would never associate
with drug-taking--who are a lot more umm-ier.  And,
for that matter, what does repeating umms have to do
with drug-taking?  None of the buzzed-out people I have
known have shown a proclivity in that direction!

Second, about the spinal fluid question, I have a sense
that you, perhaps, have taken a few too many drugs!  If
anything, he attended that question too many times.  It
seemed to me that people kept asking that question even
after he had covered it in the first hour, before the
question and answer period, with the anecdotes about how
the confusion had risen because of the researcher who
wanted to check serotonin level in volunteer subjects'
spinal fluid.  Then he answered variations on that concern
at least three times in the q & a period.

I sense either a certain lack of atttention on your part
or a deliberate attempt to disqualify Eisner as the serious
student and writer that he is.  Which is it?

There was one other older guy in the audience, but I was
the
one in a plaid jacket, stripped shirt and abstract blue and
lavendar tie.  Was I your learyesque guy?

Eveb though I have--deservedly--flamed your flabby-minded
message, I'd enjoy corresponding with you.  I live and
teach
here in Santa Cruz and am a regular Island Group attendee;
our next meeting is this coming Thursday, when Ralph
Abraham the "father of the chaos theory" will discuss
his thoughts and experiences with us: 224 Swanton Blvd.,
near Natural Bridges State Beach at 8:00 p.m.

REPLY TO 01/15/93 10:32 FROM jondr@sco.com: re:2nd string Djs

i really can/t believe the subject of nationality over personality
made it on to the list concerning rave DJS - no one invented house,
many people were involved in a history leading to a heavily weighted
matrix we call house, and the we looks like a venn diagram...

ofcourse jeno didn/t kick it in england - crowds have different
histories and herd moments, being a great DJ is not dependent on
every performance.... if anyone out there is a DJ, they know how
hard it is to build a crowd up from scratch, especially if you only
get a set... as opposed to a weekly or radio show, etc...

what really gets me is how bitchy audiences are.... it seems like
most people think they could just immediately figure what a DJ is on
about without giving it a chance - even for a substyle who claims to
be so open minded, i think we have our narrow crowd pleasers and
still operate much along the lines of we like what our friends like
what their friends like, and at the 100th monkey, jeno becomes a
god. personnally if balo or murk or kenny dope or giles or dj smash
or red alert were around i/d jump on the chance to hear them...


also, does anyone know if there are any old disco DJs still around,
I/d love to go hear where it all came from in terms of technique...

Well, in terms of what technique? As far as beatmatching, mixing,
scratching, and all the other dj techniques we're familiar with,
to my knowledge none of that stuff went on in the disco era.

As far as I know, songs were played one after the other, with no
mixing to speak of...I could be wrong, though, as I wasn't around
in the club scene at age six. :)

To my knowledge, even in the early hip hop scene, transitions between
songs were a matter of luck...Grandmaster Flash learned how to cue
up a record using headphones from some anonymous uptown DJ, and
started a revolution in sound...see, he liked the sound he heard when
he was finding the beat on the non-playing record, and decided to
incorporate it into his sets...scratching was born.

Now I don't mean to dis on the brath BUT...

I grew up in Brooklyn and while I was there, there wasn't scratchin but
when I would visit in the late seventies people were doin this stuff called Stop
dancing which was basically proto popin and lockin.  Malcolm Mcclaren was
possibly the first to make a main stream record with scratchin but it was
out on the "streets" a good year or maybe two before buffalo gals hit the
airwaves.  He might be the first radio DJ to scratch however.

Subject: what a dud..... review


Wow, on Friday night I went to Sound Factory, a grand opening of.  What I saw
reminded me of the very stuff I escaped from the "Modern Rock" 
club days back in the late eighties.  Attitude was there in full force. 
Elitism was being fostered by a 'special guest card' where one has one's name
imprinted on a plastic creditcard look-alike.  Women walking around with their
arms around their tough guy.  Little packs of guys walking together (I call 
them insecurity bubbles) with such macho airs that it made me walk around
wide-eyed.  Puke was all over the men's bathroom and in fact one of the times
I made it there, there was a guy puking into the sink.  It seemed like there
were about 20 guys walking around with staff t-shirts and headsets.  Not only 
that but the guards had 'attitude' to the hilt and some were walking around 
with their 2-way radio volume turned all the way up so it kinda sounded like
the static and speech noise you hear from a cop's radio.  The only similarity
I could see between LIFE and any semblance of a rave was the music and 
projections but I found myself asking the question: what happened to the
attitude-free, free-love spirit that I so often associated with house music? 
Well with Sound Factory, I think we've come full circle where the free-love 
vibe is completely absent but house music is playing.  I could only take it for
about 20 min about a third of which I spent in the bathroom drinking water. :-)

Wow, I just reread what I wrote and it does sound totally harsh!  On the other
hand I'm telling you exactly how I felt.  It's basically the club scene of the
eighties with house music.

Subject: E seminar at UCSC

>What does E do to spinal fluids?
It doesn't do anything. The whole controversy about E is about whether or
not it depletes the serotonin levels in the brain and no one knows whether
that's detrimental or not. He did answer the question.
  In defense of Bruce... he's a friend of mine so I know what I'm talking
about, he is very knowlegable. You wouldn't believe the amount of things
he knows about. He does a lot of research. His "um's" are a result of
nervousness brought about by speaking in front of an audience not from
doing too many drugs. That is not a very nice way to judge someone, 
especially publicly as you have done. Unless you know for sure that that
is the case you should not say things like that (hand slap) Nuff said...
IMHO the people in the audience asked some really stupid and ignorant
questions. Doesn't anyone read up and find out about what they are going 
to take before they take something? Or are they just a bunch of sheep
that take whatever is given to them with no knowlege of the potential
side effects (if any) and any contraindications???? This is apparently
the case. This really bothers me. O.K. I'll get off of my soap box now.

This is really quite problematical for me...On the one hand, you're flaming
someone for stating out of ignorance that BE has done too many drugs,
and quite rightly on your part I might add. But then you go on to imply
and assume that *the entire audience* had used E, which is quite ludicrous.
Hell, I haven't even done it. Perhaps those "stupid and ignorant questions"
came from people interested enough in trying the drug that they would come
out to a talk and ask questions, but not interested enough to sift through
medical journals and so forth. FYI Bruce's book is not available at UCSC's
McHenry library.

Anyway, I'll give my two bits about the talk. I was disappointed in it
the same way I was disappointed in the Mondo 2000 User's Guide: I could
have got all the information in it, for free, more accurately, from the
Internet. That said, there were some very entertaining personal anecdotes,
You shouldn't blame the audience for asking basic questions, though -- I
believe Bruce should get the blame for that, having set the tone in the
first half of his speech...it should have been obvious to him that a
significant portion of the audience had experience with E, from their
reactions (BE: "This was when it was as legal as table salt." Audience:
loud groan), but the talk, IMHO, didn't ever go further than a very basic
discussion of the drug.

Incidentally, has anyone else noticed that whenever anybody speaks about
psychedelics, the names Leary, Huxley, and Hoffman are always invoked?

Hi Chris--

I read your comments on Bruce's talk at UCSC with
interest and would like to respond, so here goes:

I assume you read what I wrote to stefan (cats.ucsc.
edu!gangriel) in my post "Bruce's Umms and Stefan's Spinal
Fluid."  As you know from that post, both you and Rox
agree with me about the ignorance of equating his use
of "umms" with drug-taking.  You don't comment on his--
and several other members of the audience from their
repeated questions about the topic--lack of basic listen-
skills or attention surrounding the repeated questions 
concerning spinal fluid.  While perhaps Rox goes a bit too
far in seemingly indicting the audience for asking "some
really stupid and ignorant questions," it's that kind
of thing that sticks in my mind as a clear example of
what she means.  IMHO your faulting Eisner ("I believe
Bruce should get the blame for that, having set the tone
in the first half of his speech") is completely untenable!
What are you referring to as his "tone"?  I--and indeed
most of the audience from their applause and reception
of Eisner at the break and following the end of the
question
and answer period point the lie to that interpretation.
His long knowledge, experience, research, personal 
encounters with people like Albert Hofmann and Timothy
Leary were highlights that obviuosly from the reception
he got were appreciated by most everyone--except perhaps
you and stefan?  Indeed your comment at the end of your
post--

Incidentally, has anyone else noticed that whenever anybody
speaks about psychedelics, the names Leary, Huxley, and
Hoffman (sic) are always invoked?

seems to show a naivety on your part.  No, I haven't
noticed that.  But i wonder if you are trying to suggest
namedropping.  In the case of this talk, I found the
references revealing and appropriate!

There's also a seeming contradiction in your post about
the audience:

First you say--

But then you go on to imply
and assume that *the entire audience* had used E, which is
quite ludicrous.

and then later--

it should have been obvious to him that a
significant portion of the audience had experience with E,
from their
reactions 

All of this is said not as a "flame" but as an honest
attempt to have some clear communication about a topic
that, lord nose, is too often obfuscated by media and
judgementalists.  Let's at least try in what I hope is
a community of interested seekers--if not an island
of psychedelic thinkers--to see and set the record straight!

Unofrtunately, it's also very popular in the UK to hate American
culture.  Probably because we British share a common language with
you, but the USA is so much bigger, so we feel somewhat threatened
that our culture might be swamped.

Also, many Britons find phrases like `have a nice day' immensely
irritating, for instance.  The problem here is that many people fail
to realize that such phrases simply constitute a social protocol, and
as a result they become upset that the Americans are insincere...

Please don't let this list get into a UK vs. USA war, like the ones
over on alt.rave a couple of months back.  Our cultures are different,
our tastes are different, our music is (at least a little bit)
different.  The whole reason I want to visit America is because it's a
_different_ place, with a _different_culture.  Hell, if it was the
same as the UK, what'd be the point?

Don't worry about what is _better_, just accept that things are
_different_.

Peace.

Satnite/Sunday:
Drove by Gravity Trip at the Bridge Club (Troc) at around 1ish,
surveyed the line and decided that the scene wasn't to our liking.
Ran into Geoff there.  We looked at each other and said "Groove
Kitchen".  

Groove Kitchen was quite enjoyable.  Great lazer effects on top of
the usually good psychedelic video projections, and even the mirror
ball was beck in action.  Thoroughly enjoyed Spun's set.  The
energy picked up a bit for Jeno, and then crowd thinned out about
halfway through his set.  As usual Jeno's set was, with minor exceptions,
relentless, maintaining the same high energy level throughout.
I find that this sameness of energy level can actually get boring 
after a while.  Nevertheless, it was a good set.

Sasha came on next and played a stimulating, though erratic set,
a bit more hardcore than the previous DJs.  There were 2 highlights 
for me.  One was hearing Front Line Assembly (The Blade, I think)
mixed in.  The other was when he rubbed the needle with his finger
producing some really nice technoise.

Drove home in the pouring rain on my motorcycle, burrr.  Shower, tea,
and a 1/2 a bagel later I woke Janie and we arrived at the AfterLife to
catch the last half of Garth's set which was excellent.  Stayed for
Simon and although it was fun, we reliezed that we are starting to tire
of his song selections.  Simon's 1st "encore" song was one that he
did himself.  It didn't do much for me.  We might start getting to
and leaving the Afterlife earlier to give him a rest.

Went to Groove Kitchen at King Street with Pete R. Saturday night.
Lots of sfravers there: Jon, Giamma, Jesse, Bob Jesse, Brian, Pat,
Geoff, Rox 'n' Dan, Gunther (not really sure if he's an sfraver,
actually, since he's not on the list), and others.  I had a pretty
good time, considering that I wasn't in the best of moods to begin
with because I have a cold, and I kept on wondering all night what
it was that possessed me to go out when I should have been in bed
sleeping.

It was a good night, music-wise...

Rick Preston started off at 11 and played a terrific set, with lots of
cool funky tribal stuff and acid jazz-ish stuff.  There were about 50
people on the dancefloor for the last 30 or 45 minutes of his set.
I think if he had played exactly the same set an hour or two later, it
would have gone over very well.  I really wish he could spin during
better timeslots.

Spun came on at one and played some reasonably good stuff, but it didn't
really motivate me to dance as much as Rick's set did.  After about an
hour Anne and I sort of gave up on Spun and headed over to Happy Donuts
(the convenient raver 24-hour coffee/donut one-stop).  Spun was still on
when we returned and was playing some smoother, less grating, music that
was much more to our liking.

Jeno came on at 3 and played a pretty good set.  I've heard him do
better, though.  There was a half-hour period of his set, though, that
was a solid block of some amazing acid jazz.  I really wish I had a
tape of it.  This set was the peak of the evening.  The dancefloor ended
up pretty full during Jeno's set, but there was always plenty of room to 
dance (unlike the past few Wickeds, where you could hardly move).

Next up was the special guest DJ, Sasha, who is the biggest DJ in the
UK.  I wasn't incredibly impressed.  I didn't like him as much as I
like a lot of the local SF DJs.  His musical selection was very
different from what is played around here.  There were a few records
that he played that I thought were excellent, but overall it was a bit
too housey for my taste.  Sasha's mixing style was -- umm, interesting.
He can do every trick that Carlos can do, and a few that I've never
seen Carlos do (scratching in individual beats of a record).  But what
bothered me was the stop/start nature of his set.  Every four songs or
so, he would let the beat drop out completely -- for a minute or more
-- leaving most people standing around wondering when the beat was
going to return.  And when it did return, it was nowhere near as funky
as the beats in Rick's or Jeno's set.  I found Sasha's interruptions
annoying and much preferred the way the earlier DJs had kept a constant
energy going.

Ernie Munson went on at 7am, but we took off soon after because we were
pretty exhausted.

Friday: wanted to go to Happy Happy Joy Joy but it was cancelled "due
to lack of space".  Glad I didn't go to LIFE after tAXI's report... or
to Strawberry Sky -- I was itching to go out early, but the number
said that the location would be posted at 9:30, and I wanted to be
dancing as soon as possible, so I bagged.  Rumor heard Saturday is
that it was busted at 1 am.  Ended up not going out.

Saturday: Called Cool World number just for the hell of it, was
apparently held just north of Candlestick Park in what appeared to be
a scenic and interesting neighborhood :-) Thought about Groove
Kitchen, but went to Gravity Trip instead at the Bridge (Troc).  Paid
$15 to get in after they said $12 on the number Friday -- grrr.  Saw
Laurel from the Yosemite trip about 2 minutes after getting inside.
Good dance space, good chill space with DJ upstairs (but no chill
music, too bad).  Much better crowd than Gathering (my only other SF
data point), came by myself and spent most of the night dancing in
informal constantly changing groups of people.  Drawbacks: alcohol
served, club physical atmosphere, waited in line from midnight to 1:15
am before getting in.  Music was good to excellent except for one
major lull (for me) at 3:15 or so with a DJ playing (bad) house-y
music -- took advantage of this to check out the space.

ok- i may be a tad bit backdated with this post ...  <<< disclaimer intended
for the weak.of.heart/easily.annoyed  :)

i got to see the 48 hours lsd report for the first time on fryday nite.
(thanks larry :)  i thought that overall they presented the public with
a pretty accurate picture of what acid is.  i almost want to make a copy
for my parents.  (<< this feeling may go away when my mind clears;  i'm
still in recovery :)  i _really_ liked when the older guy who had case
files on lsd users in the 60s stressed that the danger in lsd use comes
from improper/abusive/unaware usage.  (of course, /I/ don't have a psych-
ologist lying around in my closet just in case i want to fry under pro-
fessional supervision  :) :)  and there was a plethora of killer sound
and video bytes, ripe and ready for the picking!   

i did notice the film editing, as was mentioned by someone during
the original thread of this discussion.  some replies to the interviewing
almost appeared to have originally been connected to a different question!!

overall i really liked it though.  i've watched it about 4 timEz!

(why the 48 Whores subject line?  did i miss something?)

oh, and thanks to john grigsby (hi john :), larry ching (hi again, larry :)
and jocelyn (hey there, jocelyn :) for coming to my frydAy nite party, which
turned out totally different than i had pictured, but was fun, nonetheless.
i think the biggest stoker about the party was getting to meet a few more 
sf-ravers. (make that "I KNOW").  i had an e-nitemare once when a guy stayed
at my house whom my roommate had met on the net.  (mental note:  write a 
cheezy futuristic luv.story someday, and call it _We Met On the Net_. :)     
anyway, although he was a nice guy, he was annoying as frick.  (he asked if
he could use some hot water, and i said "sure".  he ended up locking himself
in the bathroom for over an hour taking a shower/shaving, and left the place
a mess! (use some hot water?  i thought he wanted to make some tea! ;) ))
[list.name with.held to protect net.personality (not sfraves)] 

ANYWAYZ....

the point is no such e-nitemares with sfravers.  and hopefully i will see
you guyz again real soon.

if moby / prodigy come to sj oasis, i hereby open my house for an sfraves
pre/after.party.  (about 10 blox from my house).

well, enough monday morning disjointia for now...

my roommate rob went on tour to europe with this band he does sound for
and they were on tour about four months.  he said that in that time he
saw fliers for and heard by w.o.m. that there were these underground 
parties happening at secret locations from whenever till dawn, with lites
drugs, loud music and dancing all nite.  sound like a rave?  well...
(and i don't know much about this, which is why i'm posting, so if i post
doo.doo, don't bother flaming)  he said that instead of house, they play
industrial/EBM/indu.danse and it's called a rage.  has anyone ever heard
more about these things??

if they do exist, why are they so underground?  or perhaps a better question
would be how do they manage to remain so underground?  

the reason i thought about these is that a friend of my just told me last
nite that one was happening in sacto (next sat i /think/) after i asked her
if she'd ever heard about them.  if this is for real, i am definitely going
to go and i will post a review.  

anyone else interested in trying one out?

wow

now i know why i rave... i used to think it was more phun than the
other options, but groove kitchen convinced me of a more wholitic
integrity of just raving - i don/t think i have ever peaked so hard
without anything stronger than tea in my body..... in fact i almost
phlashbacked..... wow ...... also, this was the first time i heard
jeno.... maybe that had something to do with. he certainly floored
me - but i/ve heard equally as strong sets by garth .... so i think
it was other things as well.... well - i have time to figure it out.

i had the silly idea i/d check the gravity thing out, but when i saw
Geof W. show, we snd my friend jim decided groove kitchen was the
way to go... why bother squeezing a billion 40 ounce drinkers into
the trocadero... the line bummed me out and the people even more.

so i checked groove kitchen - and i/ve seen Geoff at raves before i
knew he was Geoff, and i have always felt good when i see him cause
i know i/m probably at the right spot :)

i heard from Michael W., Rick Preston did a real powerful set, which
Jim and i just couldn/t accept, but oh welll - good for rick and the
people who heard him

i couldn/t figure out what Spun was up to. it was a real
rollercoaster ride with no discernable personality. i felt the mix
was not up to what i/m used to hearing from him and the song
selction was dumb :( oh welll. in spun/s favor, the weakest mix of
his set was actually at a point when he had only one record on the
tables and it seemed like who ever mixed the tape loops didn/t sink
the beats too well.

but when jeno kicked in the crowd went nutz.... he had 2 weak mixes
his entire set til i left at about 5:30 after hanging with Harry
Who? for a few minutes, it was cool cause i thought he dicked around
with me, but it was just a misunderstanding which i/m happy about
cause i like him a lot....

i passed out a bunch of little cards with my radio show on it cause
i/m shallow, but i tried not to bother any sfrers with them. so if
you got one without asking i/m sorry....

i/m still having the biggest trouble meeting people i don/t have a
reason to meet ... like they/ll be some interesting people and i/ll
want to break into dancing with them, i can never put myself in a
frame of mind where i don/t pheel like i/m an unwanted instrusion...

but i had a huge blast meeting all the sfravers there.... it/s
always wonderful to place faces. but for some reason i usually
forget our postal interactions as soon as i know who some one
physically is, weird. :+?

then i took jim to happy donuts where we discussed the physics
behind why some people look so good inside a club, and then you put
them in the sun light and they just lose it ..... personally i think
i always rate 4 to 6, well within tolerance - we were talking people
who go from 9 to 3 or so.... confusing

then off to the end-up to watch the sunrise... but it was raining,
and the dj just could not keep a mood, or for that matter match a
beat... but we had some rolling rocks and watched the very exciting
bar tender make all sorts of various dumb drinks....

then we closed it off at the dna where i met garth and he said he do
something for my next zine, but he doesn/t like interviews. :)
i never phelt bean bags at a better time.

we went back to shallow alto, slept, back in the car cause jim
wanted to flyer the haight for a band he manages who have their
first club gig this week (boo-hoo i/ll miss deep space) and then we
checked frank miller at the comics place - i/ll never get the whole
comix thing... then we looked for happi house and zanzibar but both
places seemed closed, so we went to chevvy/s and watched moping
49ers phans drink away the evening....

next week: L.A.

Oh yeah! Well, I would find it psychologically pleasing if a closing DJ lit
his/her last record on fire while it was playing, then threw the flamin'
1200's on the ground and stomped on them for a while while the PA's amplify
the din.... Yeah that would do it.

Obviously, the practice would best fit Garth/Jeno -- and they could afford it.

	Groove Kitchen was seriously fun - better than my last venture into
the King Street Garage with "Vortex".  I got there at 11, and was getting
kinda worried when at 12:30 there were only 50 people there, including the
visuals people.. but by 2 or 3 the place was rocking.  The crowd size was
perfect - at its peek there was still enough room to move around a lot yet
still enough people to make it come alive (maybe... 500 people?).

	Visuals:  they had a 2 watt green laser projected against a screen,
drawing moving images, geometric designs, and every now and then "Groove" and
"Kitchen".  Opposite that screen they had another screen with video 
projections on it, everything from fractals to Ren and Stimpy.  On top of
that they had 3 intellibeams projecting on the floor and on a disco ball,
giving a terrific rainbow effect.  A few strobes here and there were thrown
in, and to top it off the had two spots come down from behind the DJ onto
the turntables, and effect I really like.  Also behind and above the DJ was
a plastic mirror tilted at 45 degrees, so you could see behind the booth and
down onto the records and DJ.  Whoever thought of that was a genius.  Finally,
the main gripe I had with 174 king street, that there was no chill room, was
tempered by easy in's and out's, and the entryway was plastered with huge
flourescent murals.  In all, a very good atmosphere (especially considering
they were selling alcohol).

	Music:  I hadn't heard Rick Preston in a long time (in fact, I can't
remember if I'd ever heard him) and was very pleasantly surprised.  He's like
a housier version of Jeno - like Mike said, if he had played to more people he
would have been a smash.  Spun played the best set I have heard him play in
the past 3 or 4 times; it was definitely more mellow than his more hip-hop
stuff he's getting into.  I enjoyed it, it was back to his more mindphuk 
tweaky period about 6 months ago... Jeno came on and I was pleasantly 
surprised, he pulled out quite a few I hadn't heard him play before.  But I
wasn't astounded.  Sasha came on after him and was great, I was really
impressed.  You UK folk have a DJ.god after all :)  I especially liked the
way he looked out over the crowd all the time, even while mixing, and even
at times would sing along with some of the background vocals. :)  He played
this great song that sampled a foghorn (which no longer exist in SF - awww)
which according to the label was Dr. Atomic... gotta get that.  When sasha
was through at 7am there were still maybe 100-200 people, so Ernie came on
and played a great straight-ahead techno set until 9 or so... definitely the
best 10 hours of music I've heard in a long long time.

	Afterwards Geoff and I went to this ambient afterhours thing that
Jason (author of the Imaginal Rave) throws every sunday morning.  It was,
well, "pleasant", but not much different than going to someone's flat and
listening to records.  I took BART home (my pooor car...).  On the way home
I saw this woman wearing oversized corduroy pants and turtle shells and a
wool cap, so I asked her, (since I was wearing somewhat phunky clothes),
"Are you a RAVER too?" (and with a smile on my face - I mean, how else do
you ask a complete stranger that question?).  She said, "No, I just dress
like this because it's trendy".  I sorta ignored the implications of that
question and told her about how fun they were, etc.  "But isn't everyone
on Ecstasy?"  No, I replied, many are but it's definitely not necessary.
"Well, I'm not one for dancing that much really."  I said it didn't matter,
the music moves you, and most people don't care how you dance or anything.
"Well I GUESS I could dance all night if I were on X."  *sigh*... we have
a long way to go... (even though I think I debugged SOME of her 
misconceptions)

Pete Reiter had the same reaction.  When we were on the way to Groove Kitchen,
I mentioned that hearing Rick would be cool, and Pete said that he was never
impressed by Rick because his musical selection is so old (e.g. "Bombscare").
But Pete had only seen Rick spin at FX and the Oasis, and I've never seen
Rick spin at either of those clubs.  I think the difference is that Rick has
to play the older techno hits for the clubby not-so-hip FX and Oasis crowds.
But when he spins at better events, he plays mostly current stuff.

Subject: Age vs Danceable?

Mike brought up an interesting point which I've been pondering recently.  I
personally think a lot of DJs around here suck not because of any sort of lack
of technique, but they play such crusty garbage.  Go to a certain club on a
certain night and you're bound to hear Vicious Pink, Ebn-Ozn, Oingo Boingo and
other crud.  Makes me clutch my stomach for the fear of emptying my bowels in
a public place.

Then go to said local "techno" club and you're bound to hear crusty techno.
Night in Motion, James Brown is Dead, Playing With Knives.

Now here is what I wonder about.  I could be anywhere at any time and flip out
when Meat Beat's "Helter Skelter" is played.  It seems timeless.  I still love
to hear and play "Little Fluffy Clouds" too.  So where do you draw the line
between crusty and classic?  Is it OK for a DJ to throw in "Bomb Scare", if
99% of his set is something you haven't heard?  Or is it more important that
the groove is being worked in a proper manner?

There is no line.  Classic == Crusty.  When someone really likes
something crusty, they just call it Classic.  Not that it's such
a terrible thing to through something crusty into the mix once in
a while, but for me, raving is a very Now type of experience, 
maybe even forward looking (i.e. on the progressive edge of human
culture).  DJs get paid to find music that makes Now special and
not just a repeat of some past event. 

At the Afterlife yeterday, there was a guy with a drumset banging
away to the music.  All I could think of (apologies for nonravey
intolerant attitude) was "Give it a rest, we have drum machines
now, we can transcend your human limitations, LET GO OF IT!  
There are others who would argue for the total unity of past, present
and future, but I suffer from nostalgiaphopia.

The groove worked in a proper manner reinforces the motion of
Now into the future.  Sometimes old overly familiar stuff can 
effectively support this, usually though, I find it to be a 
contradiction.

All good dance is timeless...I can still freak to Bomb the Bass, Todd
Terry, some Donna Summer, early D-Mob (Acieed and Trance Dance)....

For example, ealry D-Mob is about 5 years old now...*5*, maybe even
6-7 if you were hip to the clubz back then.....But, last night I
finished up putting all my old old vinyl on tape (no flames please, I
don't want to, but I'm rumming out of room!)....I have this tape with
the early acid's, and there is some stuff back then that blows away
most of the stuff out today....

Just because dance has evolved, doesn't make the evolution worth it,
unless it can be applied with a degree of skill and a synergy of sound
that surpasses the old stuff...Some techno surpasses old house, some
doesn;t.... 

In another example, I remember when I got 777 and posted how I was
disappointed... Someone replied back, well, remember it's already 2
years old...And I thought, what does that have to do with anything?
People confuse new-new-new with quality, a lot of the time.....

I'm perfectly content with hearing disco, and even disco around the
time hip-hop evolved out of disco (Mclaren, Bambaata [sp?], et al.),
at a rave or some similar event....If it still sounds good, play it...
Play the best you've got to offer...Don't play white labelz cuz their
white labelz.....

i think that queers check each other out the same
way, but in a mixed situation like a rave, they
(or at least i) will be much more cautious about
acting on their attraction to a member of the same sex,
at least compared with heterosexual men 
who can usually assume
that they are compatible.

This reminds me that Saturday night at Gravity Trip, the best moment
for me was when one of the upstairs DJ's played a remix of the original
"What Time Is Love?" replete with Kraftwerk mixed in...that and downstairs
when somebody spun "Planet Rock" mixed up with some Miami bass track...

I was kind of disappointed in the music there, incidentally, too much
disco (and disco-flavored house) for my taste...so I was upstairs a
lot, where some of the DJ's spun some great Detroity bleepy trancey
stuff.

Had a terrific time in general though, though I didn't see any sfravers
I knew...I was the guy with the spiral shaved into my hair if anyone saw
me.

These things aren't really all that anonymous, in a legal sense...

Anyone I was seriously worried about reading my posts would be able to
determine where it was sent from, mostly by calling the sysadmin at
the anonymous posting site.  Since the only people I can imagine
having to worry about are large govt. organizations, they'd have no
trouble getting the info they wanted from the site.  Also, the site
you used is in Finland, so it's costing someone a lot of money to send
overseas transmissions. Also, it's a quite popular anonymous posting
site, used by a lot of people on the alt.sex.* and other newsgroups,
so it's sure to be well known to the authorities.

The only 'safe' email answer for a list like this is to never post
anything that can compromise your privacy/legal safety/etc.
Well, *almost* the only safe way, anyway.  d;)

WOw, I really disagree...I can hear the latest white labelz on a local
techno show or something.....

The best DJ's, IMHO, don't give a flying flibbildyfloo about just
playing the latest FSoL just because it's the latest FSoL....

IMHO, great DJs, or at least the local ones I admire, are completely
in tune with their crowd....The give and receive feedback from/to the
club via what they play and how they play it....They adjust to the
mood and play stuff relative to the mood - that could be JUngle Bros.
"I'll House You" if necessary.....It could be Digable Planets if
people are on the acid jazz gr0000ve m00d....It could be Aphex Twin,
it could be 808 State, it could be anythin....

That doesn't mean you forgo the now for the past....But you can't push
the past aside like it's useless biggildy....You can't just mix the
present, meld the past with the future in the here and now....

Just cuz you sufer from nostalgiaphobia doesn't mean that's tha best

Ok, check this out....Right now, I turned off Prodigy Death of the P.
Dancers and put on Jungle Bros. I'll House You to get into this
post... Now, JB is slower than Prodigy, ob-v, but does that make it
played out?  If you hear old in the context of newer stuff, you can clearly
see the roots of the now, you can clearly see the evolution of music,
*and* you can always gain a different perspective on the old when it's
scrunched in the midst of newer stuff - you'll hear it in a way you
never heard before... 

I think this is fundanental to the creation of *good* music, which is
why people whine about there being such junk out there - as dance
grows in popularity, there's a new generation of people who don't
realize that dance has a valid and important history - they just hear
Altern8 and think that's all there is, since Altern8 are on top, and
make some junk that's just a poopy Altern8 wanna-b....

Perfect case in point of this is the infinite number of Anasthasia
knockoffs that were out there a couple years ago....

The problem with house music is that the styles change so quickly that even
if you've never heard a song before, you can often date it within a few months.
Songs that are 6 or more months old just won't fit well into a set of more 
current music.

Of course there are exceptions. You listed a couple of good ones, but whenever
I hear "Bomb Scare" I always want to head for the door.

Some old technique they used was playing crowd noises in between two
songs. So when one song finished they play a record with a crowd noise, then
play the next song. Ain't that easy.

The only reason the likes of Todd Terry, David Morales et. all have some
modicum of respect is due to the virtual stranglehold these individuals
have had on the producing end of music.  Furthermore, although both
Strickly Rhythm, Nervous, and Murk have brought us some damn good house
releases, the suggestion that house music via the Masters at Work has
progressed seems to be quite a leap of faith.  That these individuals
shamelessly play they're own records (Todd Terry at Evolution over the
summer) is no suprise.  Yet DJ lime from SL2 does the same so I hardly
see how Anglo is an issue you here.  Perhaps creativity is.  And from
Jeno mixing Nat King Cole into an acid break or Spun using an obscure
Information Society track, there's some confort to know those at the
top of this profession also happen to be creative.  Todd Terry for all
his slick production work still hasn't brought New York out of 88/89 acid
house, which was damn good, but with one release after another, I think
it says a lot that our djs have gotten where they are now without the
benefit of the Sugarcubes salvating for them to do their remixes.

Ah yes, this is one of the stages in my "Net evolution of a Usenet

Telnetting to port 25, as someone mentioned, is a good method to do
humorous stuff, but don't seriously fuck with someone using it unless
you are careful of the port you connect to.  (Some will add the
original site to the header, and most sysadmins can dig up where
incoming/outgoing mail was routed from/to, etc...).  Nicer not to fuck
with anyone anyway.  (OK Brian, no saying 'you're the one to talk!'
:) 

This is kinda fun stuff, real interesting to get the rfc's and a book
on tcp/ip and play around.

Anyway, on security...  The way you will get caught (IMNSEG...in my
not so educated guess) is by sending questionable stuff to a site,
tantalizing a law officer who happens to be monitoring, who will
intercept your next message, header and all, and get your addr.  Now
this isn't nearly enough for an arrest...I mean, there's the old  
"I left my terminal logged on" or "Someone forged it" etc, but it
could constitute 'probable cause'.  

Why give yourself the hassle?  Don't e-mail compromising stuff.

 Can drum machines do reggae yet?

 One of my favorite memories from the last Gathering was this guy drumming
on the bottom of a big plastic bucket. Damn, he was good! The variation
in time between hits that a human drummer can provide good brain/body
tickling that a non-dithering drum machine doesn't ( unless it's programed
in - is this an option in today's drum machines? Also, what about volume
variation? ).

 Another question , for those who were at Afterlife - was he a GOOD 
drummer?

That sounds like the Biomuse system from Biocontrol systems of Palo Alto.
At $50,000 a pop, and limited distribution to technology partners, it's not
exactly going to become a mainstream product.  Then again, Biocontrol seems
to be more into the licencing business.

I want details! I was thinking of developing something like that this year
now that corporate bozos can't tell me what not to work on -- oriented more
as virtual groupware and less as a game. It'll probably be a freeware
application for networked unix workstations running on WINTERP 2.0 using my
new animation/graphics extensions...

This is either the Vivid groups' Mandala system, or Myron Krueger's system
(forgot the name). Did it use a silhouette image of the dancer, or the
actual image itself. If it used the actual image, it was the Mandala
system, otherwise it was Krueger's.

	I've just started taking a course on drumming. Done 2 classes so far at
UC Santa Cruz. VERY cool stuff. Drumming can be very VERY trancey. A lot like
deep into a rave when they just start hitting you with intense rhythm and very
little melody. Gathering on New Year's Eve was my first Bay Area rave. (Just
moved here from Buffalo, NY, a month ago! :)  ) I was SERIOUSLY grooving to the
deep trance stuff. Now that I'm starting to study a bit of the drumming, I'm
grokking WHY people do it. They're helping MAKE the beat. It's a give & take.
You synch up with the rhythm, allow it to permeate your nervous system, and
cycle it back. Fun stuff! :)
	I saw a guy at Gathering who had two drums set up. Over to the left of
the smartbar. I think they were congas, not sure, though... Seemed to be having
fun! :)

The group, The Fugs, were around from about 1963-65 or even 66. They did
all these bawdy songs like "My bed is getting crowded (they're rolling on
the floor...), "Saran Wrap" and the Shitter song (If I had a nickel, if I
had a dime, I'd put in the toilet and shit all the time. uh-huh, baby,

Well, "New" and "Old" are relative terms.  If I'm not familiar with
something, then it's new to me.  That's why I enjoy lot's of 
ethnic/tribal music, and I still get off on the sound of a digideroo: 
this kind of stuff hadn't been pummelled into my psyche via the cultural
brainwashing we are all victims of.  And of course there is "new" stuff
that is completely derivative and therefore "old".  

A couple weeks ago, Carlos decided to play the Light My Fire in the
middle of a set.  I was once into the Doors, but it was quite nauseating. 
Even if I had never heard the song before, the instrumentation would 
sounded tired and played out to me.

Great DJs will also take the crowd to new places, new highs.  Great
DJs will resist the temptation to continuously coddle the crowd with
comfortable favorites.  Instead, they draw us in with a comfortable
groove and use it as a launching pad for takeoff into a sonic adventure.

Although I can only speak for myself, my opinion for what's best for the

comfortable stagnation.  But that's only my opinion.

Well, I won't get into a discussion of why time is an illusion other
than to say that I wouldn't put restrictions on how we can it.  I have 
found my sense of time to be quite  malleable, and absorbtion into 
a musical experience is one way it gets played with.

Agreed; old stuff can be given new life when put into a new context.
I'll probably never tire of hearing Kraftwerk samples, but that is 
because I find Kraftwerk samples to be relevant to my sense of now.

have any use other than for purely academic interests.

There's nothing that you can't program a drum machine (or percussion sounds
driven by a sequencer) to do.  But why bother?  What a waste of technology

Except drag some beats, or swing some beats, or accent some beats or off-

off another player's (like the synth/keyboard player's riff) or follow
a spontaneous run by the bass.  

you have your right to like or dislike whatever u want, and you can have an

I reply...
As a drummer (among other things, but I've been drumming longest), I agree to an
extent.  For dance music, I think that a drum machine is essential for the basic
beat, but human added fills (a-la Front 242 among others) add a lot to a song.
 I don't think that humans should be completely dropped from the loop.  I also
agree that if you are going to use a drum machine, there is no reason to try and
emulate a human drummer feel.  If you are going to use technology, really take
it to it's farthest extent.  I would counter that the reason this doesn't happen
already is that people programming the drum machines aren't afraid to change,
but just that they don't know enough about percussion in general.  If you listen
to some really good jazz, you can get a better understanding of just how much a
basic rhythm can be permuted into more than just a time keeper (as in a lot of
rock, and definitely more so in most dance music), but into an actual living,
breathing musical entity.

yeah.  modern drumboxes have "smear" (also known as "humanize" or
"swing") parameters that can vary the timing of hits so they miss the
beat by a few ticks in either direction.  ditto for volume.

Last time Crash Worship was here, I watched their main drummer in awe.  The

A good 25% of Jeno's and Garth's sets are 1988 - 1989 acid house.
Jeno's played "House Music All Night Long" by 2 Guys on Acid (released
in 1989) every time I've heard him spin since September.  He's also
been playing the "brrr stick 'em" song ("Listen to the Drummer" by
Nation 12, released in 1990) and an old 1988 12" by MDAM.

The trick is that these songs don't sound dated, and they mix well with
more current music.  And none of them were incredibly overplayed when
they were originally released; none of them have that "classic" status.
As far as most people are concerned, these songs could've been released
in 1992.

it's obvious - music that is _original_ works regardless of age.  music
that is produced to fit into a specific genre will seem dated in six
months or a year.  try listening to anasthasia today.  seems really
sad, doesn't it?  all those songs with the opera sample just don't cut
it any more.  that fad is dead.  on the other hand, "helter skelter" is
completely outside any categorization.  what can you call it?  it's
sorta industrial, sorta reggae, sorta house... but it's really none of
those, and thus it will fit in practically any set.

when sasha was playing on saturday i kept thinking, "this is sad.  now
we're hearing formulaic, cookie-cutter prog house."  all these songs
had the same structure and the same gimmick.  there was very little
innovation and it was obvious by the way that none of the songs stuck
in my head at all.  it didn't sound that objectionable because those
structures and gimmicks are popular at the moment, but in six months,
sasha's set will sound as dated and pointless as a set full of opera
sample techno sounds today.

Plus some really good ones (Roland R-8, for example) can tweak the

rick preston kicked off with a set that was rather housier than i
liked it, and he had trouble finding a groove.  he admitted as much
to me after his set, and complained about how difficult it is to play
to an empty house.  "well, someone's gotta open."

spun came on next and blew my mind.  fitting neatly into the "age vs
danceability" thread, he played a set consisting mainly of records
from 1987.  heavy heavy miami bass grooves, old bomb the bass, lots
of frankie bones DJ breakbeat records...  he had this one record with
a guy saying "BOOM."  he'd spin it in at various intervals, slowing it
down with his finger so the pitch of the voice dropped towards the end.
great trick.  and yes, he did mix in "listen to the drummer" by Nation XII
at one point although he never let it go for more than few measures.
basically, he was brilliant, and it moved me to give him a high five
during his set and exclaim "you are completely awesome!"

after that, jeno seemed anticlimactic.  he was doing the same "welcome
to 1987" shtick that spun did only his style is a lot less frantic than
spun's and it doesn't work as well with the frenetic cut-up pace of
most of those old records.  he dropped "planet rock" and it seemed kind
of cheap to me.  later, he moved into his acid jazz/housier mode and that
thrilled me even less.  i think he suffered from following spun.  when i
heard jeno on wednesday at housing project he seemed to have much more of
a spark to him.

sasha - well, i was not impressed one bit.  the full on disco diva stuff
was atrocious and the cookie-cutter prog house (see previous message) was
even less enchanting.  he has done a record called "appolonia" under the
name "b.m.ex" and it was a lot better than most of the stuff he played,
so you figure it out.  i dunno, i just Didn't Get It.

ernie munson - competent but unmemorable.  i left after 20 mins.

so we bopped on over to the DNA, hoping to catch Jon Williams for a dose
of serious early morning energy.  unfortunately, he was feeling poorly
and had been and gone by the time we got there.  garth was doing the
usual garth thing, which didn't seem too appealing at the moment, so i
downed a bowl of the infamous DNA fruit salad and then went home to crash.

i had a great time at groove kitchen - combine the killer light show with
a killer set like spun's and i'm a happy camper.

	'Juice' Nothing To Rave About
	Journal Staff Report
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	Police found three cans of a toxic aerosol spray at a rave party last
weekend, and are warning people not to use what's known as "rave juice."
	"This stuff they're inhailing is fatal, it's toxic," said Albuquerque
Police Detective Will Duran.  He said police found the cans containing
Chlorodifloromethane at the rave party police raided at the now closed Maxwell's
4575 San Mateo NE, early Sunday morning.  The cans were covered over with lables
that read, "rave juice."
	Duran said some of those questioned at the rave reported seeing six
cans of the spray being sold.  The spray is used to clean dust off computer
parts.  Raves are normally impromptu, underground parties with music and dancing
although in Albuquerque promoters have openly sold tickets in advance.  Party
goers sometimes have to buy a map that will lead them to the rave, instead of
tickets.
	Duran said he contacted law enforcement agencies around Los Angeles,
where raves are popular.  Officers there told him that such rave juice causes
euphoria when inhaled, but can also turn into hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric
acid that can damage the user's lungs and liver.
	"Eventually, it's going to kill you," Duran said.
	Duran, part of a team that raided  the party of about 200 people, said
he believed most of the people there weren't using drugs or the rave juice, but
want to warn the public of its dangers.
	Several arrests resulted from the raid and more may follow, Duran said.

yeah... Health Ed, 10th grade

you take stuff like the stuff that chills margarita glasses or anytype 
of aerosol coolant and spray it down your throat

you either get real sick, die or have one hell of a good high

a friend of mine was inhaling a balloon once and soon realized
it wasnt nitrous he was inhaling

still got high, but not the same thing

personally the idea of inhaling an aerosol can isnt appealing
but i dont know how bad it really is

I'd like to see a mechanism for this that doesn't involve fairly
intense ultraviolet light.  It's possible, but hardly sounds
spontaneous.

This is probably true, though, as many light halocarbons like that are fairly
potent carcinogens.

Wow!  That's unexpected.  Cool.


It makes sense for cops to support parties where people don't drink
(and later drive).  Maybe some are getting clued in.

Amen, hallelujah.  I say the same thing to people all the time, esp. the
people who think that legitimate popular music equals a guitar, bass, drumset 
and a lead singer.  (Watch MTV lately?)  Anything else is "alternative" (read:
weird non-music sound).  (If you turn off the sound, it does look like 1993
though.)

Music, and all art for that matter, should evolve.  We exist in a technical 
world.  Our art must synergize that reality with human expression.  There is
room for both technical resultant and human expression -- apart and 
together.  Transcendence will come from the expressive manifestation of 
neither Man or Machine  -- but both.

actually bruce also mentioned that the 'rave movement', as he called it , has
been rather instrumental in rejuvenating the psychedelic movement and i think
in a sense this 'rave movement' can become part of the psychedelic movement.
this psychedelic salon, the island group also has in its list of interests
connections between 'new physics ' ,i.e. quantum physics, and consciousness
a conection which i find very interesting , which we talked about several
weeks ago. to me, raving seems to be about expanding consciousness, so this
 group might be of interest to others here.

well, on Saturday night, went over to Brian's place (cool spot, B) and after
hanging out and watching "Cops" for awhile and checking out Brian's mixer
we headed out for SF.  We were going to go to Funky San Francisco, but the
line was long, so we headed for King street.

Groove Kitchen was good.  I had only been to King street once before (la(last
Wicked) and hated it.  This time waqs much better, mainly because the place
wasn't that crowded.  The music was also not nearly as loud as the Wicked
sound system is (which is ridiculous.)   I liked Spun and Jeno's sets
pretty well, and enjoyed Sasha alot.  I like trancy stuff and don't mind when
the beat leaves for a little while.  I t just makes me refocus my energy
from my feet to my head for awhile.

Unfortunately I was quite sick that night with a cold, so i didn't dance much.
It was fun to hang out, though, except that I was kinda bumming Brian's trip
since I was kinda out of it (sorry Brian. :( )  But when you'd come over
and hang for a little while, Brian, I'd pick up on your intensity and feel
up to it all over again.  This is one of the great things about raving; that
you can siphon someone else's energy and get going yourself.  I don't think
that I will go out raving while sick again, however.

Two words;  CRASH WORSHIP

Anyone interested in drumming and groove-to-the-core-dissolve-your-body 
trancing should check out this group/event the next time they happen.  
They did the Offramp ('way up here in Seattle) a coupla times to a 
really diverse audience (rockers, neorastas, hardcores/skinheads, 
grunge puppies, ravers).  And, with a liberal splattering of 
blood/water/wine/chocolate mixed with the rhythm of worlds colliding, 
they melted all of our social borders and bodies down into one single 
inosculated-and-throbbing amoeboid organism, simulorgasming a hundred 
strong.  They are a drumming ensemble that generates pulsating 
out-of-body-ness delivered straight from the throat of primal 
darkness...just be sure to wear something that you don't mind having

	I've just started taking a course on drumming. Done 2 classes so far at
UC Santa Cruz. VERY cool stuff. Drumming can be very VERY trancey. A lot like
deep into a rave when they just start hitting you with intense rhythm and very
little melody. Gathering on New Year's Eve was my first Bay Area rave. (Just
moved here from Buffalo, NY, a month ago! :)  ) I was SERIOUSLY grooving to the
deep trance stuff. Now that I'm starting to study a bit of the drumming, I'm
grokking WHY people do it. They're helping MAKE the beat. It's a give & take.
You synch up with the rhythm, allow it to permeate your nervous system, and
cycle it back. Fun stuff! :)
	I saw a guy at Gathering who had two drums set up. Over to the left of
the smartbar. I think they were congas, not sure, though... Seemed to be having
fun! :)

I *really* hated that Bomb the Bass record.  It didn't fit in at all

Yeah, he completely ruined a brilliant song.  The stuff he was mixing on

Agreed.

I thought the acid jazz stuff was godlike and blew away just about every
record Spun played.  Jeno did play some weak housier stuff towards the end
of his set.  Basically, Sasha arrived during the last half hour of Jeno's
set, and that's when Jeno switched from kickass funky/jazzy mode into
sort-of limp house mode.

As I understand it, a good time can be had from the aerosol of canned whip
cream.  It's NO2 or something benign like it.  It takes about two cans for a 
real good time.  I've been in a 7-11 twice now in the wee hours of the night
and have seen a *group* of people come up to the counter with several 
cans *each*!  Last time, I made some remark to the clerk after they left 
('cause I was :)~ ) to the effect, "I guess somebody's going to get whip cream 
all over something!"  He remarked that they often find *full* cans of whipped
cream tossed by the side of the store at the back.  Rumor has it that with
a slight of hand, you push the nozzle just enough to let the aerosol out
and keep the whip cream in.  Of course, I don't promote such activities and 
can't confirm the rumor.  :-)

I haven't kept up with the latest algorithmic music software products,
but there's been stuff out for a while (Jam Factory, M?) that responded
to keyboard players, producing harmonies and matching tempos
interactively.  So, the technology certainly exists for interactive
rhythm generators.  It's just a matter of time before it gets more
sophisticated, and then you won't be able to tell the difference between
a human drummer and a computer, except that the computer will be able
to do much more (if so programmed).

A couple of years ago "Dust Off" was popular with friends of mine.  Its effect
is similar to nitrous but faster, more intense, and it is easier to black out.
Blacking out was random and more severe than nitrous - ex. coming out of it
in another room, standing on a couch or drooling alot.  Of 30 or so people
who were doing it at the time EVERYONE stopped within a few months.  One 
person (i am very skeptical of this) claims to have a permanent buzzing in his
earsbecause of doing this stuff. He contacted somebody at Stanford who then
called me.  They asked alot of dumb questions but what I found interesting
was the fact that the stuff used to be sold in adult book stores in the 60's
and has resurfaced only recently. I think it is fairly safe.  I doubt the 
reaction in your stomach business in the police report.  I dont recommend
buying the stuff in bulk (price club?) but I wouldnt be too scared if someone
passes you a can.

this is not quite true.  there are interactive programs, but response is

yeah, me too.  but that doesn't mean the drum machines tracks recorded were
responding to feel.

other posts talked about various programs that "mess" the beat.  this is
true, & takes away the preciseness of drum tracks...
BUT IT IS RANDOM & HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT A DRUMMER DOES.

& the machines still can not synthecize the rhythm of a number or varying
tempos of numbers of instruments...which has nothing to do with preserving
traditional quitar, bass, blah blah blah.

there's nothing wrong with not liking old music, or liking only techno-
produced, or whatever.  just don't ascribe to technology something that
IS NOT THERE.

ostentatious, but not really caring on the other hand) to aver that current 
technology is indeed wunnerful, wunnerful.  Beats, syncopations, and rhythms 
can be reproduced mechanically.  However, the spiritual link between the drummer
and the drum can not be tekkno-objectified.  Neither can the spiritual link be-

Saw a great comedy special on HBO Sunday night with George Carlin.
Last bit went sort of like this:

"Save the Planet?  Who the fuck are we kidding?  The planet will be
fine... it's survived cosmic rays, meteorites, impacts with comets,
the reversal of the magnetic poles, changing solar temperatures,
earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tetonics...  Don't you think it's a bit
pretentious that we think we could hurt the Earth?  Ask the folks
buried at Pompeii if they think that the poor Earth can't fend for
itself.  And hell, all this whining about damage to the planet...
when we finally screw up, the earth will shake us off like fleas.
Stuff like plastic might be left behind, but so what?  If the earth
can't figure out how to get rid of it, it'll absorb it.  After a
period of cleansing, it'll be the earth plus plastic, a whole new
thing which probably won't be that different from the old earth.
Hell, maybe the earth wants to be the earth plus plastic... that would
explain a lot, now wouldn't it?  Man was put here to create plastic,
and now he's no longer necessary..."

In all seriousness, folks, to amplify only part of what NUT was
saying, technology and religion are destructive to US -- in the grand
time frame of our planet, we are only the blink of an eye.  Millions
of years after humans are gone from this planet, everything will be
cool again, with plenty of oil and ozone for the next occupants if
that's what they need to live.

Well, that's the last $.02 from me on this topic to this list, I don't
think it's rave related, and there are too many strongly held
viewpoints on the subject of "technology killing world" vs.
"technology saving world" vs. "world fine no matter what" to have this

Just a quick comment on this discussion: what I appreciate most about
the best drummers (Bill Bruford comes immediately to mind) is the
ability to make music "breathe", for lack of a better term.  The
drummer is the one player in a band who can make GLOBAL changes in the
way a tune feels -- and the proper minor adjustments can increase the
impact 100fold, especially in heavily syncopated music or music with
strange time signatures.

I've never heard this with electronic sequenced drums, but that
doesn't mean that it can't be done.  Rather, I think it's "use the
appropriate tool for the job" type of an attitude that's appropriate.
If you want preciseness without a hell of a lot of work, use a drum
machine.  If you want "feeling" and a sense of "liveness" without a
hell of a lot of work, use a person.

Sure.  The Waves is in Old town in LG.  Old town is an old
elementary school - turned arts/crafts/shopping place.
Less and less arts and crafts; bummer.  The waves is on the
left as you enter from the front - go up to the middle
of the main bldg, walk left along the deck, right between
the flower place and the womens clothes place, up the stairs,
and you're there.  They have live tunz fairly often; third thurs
of every month is my friend's band (I think it's still third thurs)
- Kirk, spock and bonz (they play zep van halen etc).  I dunno
bout the other nights, cept for the mention in the weekly
rave guide.

To get to Old town take 17 south - exit Los Gatos/Monte Sereno
ramp, take left at first light (university), go down a couple
of blocks -- you'll see it on the left.  Shouldn't have a prob
parking.  

Parallel to university ave is N. Santa Cruz, where there are
some other joints  <puff> <puff> , within EZ walking:

Mountain Charly's  - Rock n Roll, live tunes often, some big names
Carry Nations -  older, sedate crowd.. warm and cozy though
                 Number One Broadway - Jazz/CW
Black Watch - More of my high school crowd - crowded, noisy,
            and smoky - but a fun place to mingle!  Drink the house 
            special,
            kamikazes - but be careful with them!  they come in a
            "pitcher" (a tall glass) with about 4 shots each - my
            buddy and I used to drink 6-7 pitchers of these.. but
            it's not advised.

C.B.Hannigans - "Beautiful people": all the prom queens and kings
                hang here and act phony.  I avoid it.

Pedro's  -  Kinda yuppi crowd, but you can scarf chips and salsa
            and drink slow!

Last Call -  Pool, darts - kinda divey but lotso young locals on
             weekends


Have fun if you go, and WATCH OUT FOR THE LG PIGS.  I walk home or

I would also like to see something that claims nitrous is dangerous.  It has
always been my understanding that it was one of the "safest drugs known to
man" - as an article in Wall Street Journal claimed a few years back.  It
CERTAINLY kills brain cells as does alcohol, mopping your floor, and holding
your breathe.  Is this the short term brain damage you refer to?  If it is
then I agree.  I thinkthat the only deaths attributed to nitrous hae been by
suffocation or passing out and falling over (down stairs) but I welcome any

Subject: unfunky drummer // human vs computer // DJ karaoke? // Re: rave juice

unfunky drummer:

Seems to me that some of the better/funkier rhythm tracks in
techno/hip-hop/dance/house music are sampled from real, live drummers.
Granted alot of stuff is programmed, but the stuff that really gets the
booty swayin' and the backstroke swangin' are taken from real drummers.

Even if it's a drum loop off of a breakbeat album, chances are that loop
was created by a real drummer (as opposed to being programmed in step-time
or sequenced/programmed/quantized).

Not that totally sequenced, quantized drumming doesn't have it's place.
However, more times than not, I've found that the stuff that gets me going
is the stuff that doesn't sound like a metronome... 

LONG LIVE REAL DRUMMERS AND REAL PLAYERS OF INSTRUMENTS! THe only reason
people sample so much is because it's so hard to find a real rhythm section
like the JB's (James Brown's band) or the Meters, or the Blackbyrds, or
Mandrill, or ... and there's nothing more artistically satisfying, and more
ecologically sound than recycling a good old funky instrumental track into
todays dance music.

They've been using this "we have the technology, it's just a small matter
of programming" argument for the last 20 years in artificial intelligence,
and they haven't gotten anywhere at all. There just ain't no replacing good
ol' fashioned humans until we solve the general machine intelligence
problem, and that ain't gonna happen in our lifetimes boyo!

Furthermore, why replace what a human can do? Let humans do what they do
well, let computers do what they do well. Build technology to augment
humans, to take care of repetitive, cut&dry algorithmic tasks (e.g.
sequencing, quantization for appropriate kinds of rhythms). Use the
technology as mind enhancement so that we can fully apply our ability to
reason nonlinearly, analogically, inventively, spontaneously -- with leaps
and bounds of faith and imagination.

Most importantly of all, remember that a human performing an artistic task
is situated in a vast interlocking web of intertwingling cultures, morals,
histories, stories, analogies, and hallucinations -- this "situatedness" is
precisely what a computer lacks when being thrown into the task of
performing music. From a human cultural perspective, a computer can't
"understand" or "create" music any better than a chicken trained to
peck-out a tune on a toy piano.

And no machine is going to be able to understand/reproduce that human
characteristic of "being in the world" (ala Heidegger) unless the machine
itself has spent time on this earth as a human, experiencing the world as a
human. Probably even goes beyond that given the possible deep-rooted
linguistic&social connotations of music passed on genetically from man's
primal past.

Not really true. There are a number of researchy computer music projects
involving automated instrumental accompanyment (e.g. MIT media lab).
There's even "Jam Factory" or "Band in a box" being sold commercially. Most
of that work is towards accompanying more "classical" musics, which perhaps
are more easily classifiable and reifiable into rule-bases. There's also
Manfred Clynes work in having computers put "feel" as they play back a
classical score from the notation (with additional information on the
rhythmic pulse associated with a particular composer).

Unfortunately, I don't know of work in computers accompanying funk or
african rhythms -- probably because the sponsors of this kind of work tend
to be old men that consider all non-classical music to be "lowest common
denominator" and not "great art". These also tend to be the sorts of
military-industrial assholes that bought the hype of "AI"
hook-line-and-sinker and are now just seeking an appropriately trivial
"closed world" for them to continue wasting our precious tax dollars on
their quixotic quest for creating cute-but-ultimately-useless technology.

The only nasty thing I've heard about Nitrous Oxide is that dentists who have

weird cancer.  I've never heard that it has any short term damaging effects.

Could you possibly referring to Amyl Nitrate?  (Or whatever the chemical name

affect similar to nitrous, ethyl ether, and other inhalants.  From what I've
heard Amyl Nitrate is dangerous and does cause brain damage in people who use
it frequently.  I wish I could quote sources, but, alas, I have none other
than word of mouth.

On a similar note, like Rave Juice (TM), Ethyl Ether is popular (and legal,
along with poppers and nitrous oxide) in New Orleans.  This version of rave
juice also comes in cans and is squirted onto cloth, which you then suck on
until you fall over.  Mardi Gras, here I come!

Share and enjoy.

My understanding too.  Nitrous Oxide is benign.  Unless there is a world-wide
conspiracy of dentists.  (NO I'm joking!!!  Pullez, no more conspiracy 
theories!)

On the other hand, Amyl Nitrate (sp?) is evil.  And it kills brain cells 
faster than TV.   Personally, I don't do fumes.  
Unless of course there is an old Mercedes driving in front of me 
and I can't change lanes.  But that's a different story.

TIm Leary is a serious Mondoid, and I'm sure the more

Just about everyone on the report has an internet address, I

the report.. 

Ayt any report, I'm supposed to know all this stuff, but I have yet to
see a copy first-hand....

The original poster that posted the press.release said they focused on
raves...Is that true!?!!?!  My preperceptions are altered, if that's
the case...I'd like to know what they said about raves and how it
relates to techno-culture....

Errr, I guess I could just wait a week until the thing hits every

While it is true that Tim Leary is a serious MONDOID, I do think
his quote is right on metaphorically if not literally. For the
following reasons:

	If you look at the actual makeup of the magazine , it looks cool
	on the surface but if you read the large print the actual message
	has a counter spin for example they have an article on Richard
	Stallman and the Free Software Foundation which would lead you to
	believe that they will close down any day now.  They mention how
	they are hurting for cash.  But don't mention the overwhelming
	success of Gcc and how it forced companies like Sun to adjust their
	price structure on compilers.

	They have "enlightening" articles about how great electronic
	"virtual warfare" is by none other than that hawk in dove's clothing
	Stewart Brand.

	They have a regular column by the Media Whore Nick Negroponte
	who you can hire to disprove and derail your favorite international
	standard for a mere large "donation" to his (media) lab.

	People like the opertunist Tod Marcover who may be a good musician and
	had something to do with IRRCOM but does not qualify him to report
	on cellular phone phreaks.

	I like the set up and would indeed buy a copy or two on the news stand
	(I read Aviation Week and Space Technology also) but I would beware
	of its ultimate message which is to co-opt the "emerging" techno
	counter-culture for its own purposes.

If enough people feel as strongly as you, they'll write letters in,
and the editors will definitely feel that agitated presence....

Ummm, I'm pretty much into "the 'emerging techno counter-culture", to
put it mildly, and I've always felt that it currently exists in such
an un-establishmentized state in which the majority of the available
forums realize that there's only a core foundation of people available
to squeeze profit out of (if that's their motive) ona a regular basis,
thus they'll fail if they don't pay atention to that foundation....

For example, IMHO, Mondo has become more info-centred, as people got
sick of certain aspects of the zine, and these attitudes were repeated
over and over....Witness the recent low-profiles of Queen Mu and RU
Sirius (though RU seems to've been busy with other projects [Mondo
Vanilli, Mondo's Guide to New Edge] and he will probably be
re-establishing a stronger presence soon).....

Anyway, I'd just like to encourage people to buy a copy, or at least
read it, and then send in a letter about what you don't like....SOme
obvious beginnings of your letter might be "Before I send in my
subscription money, I'd like to offer a few suggestions which myself
and others I've talked to about your magazine feel would be a benefit
to its overall continued successful propagation....criticism 1,
criticism 2, etc...I look forwarfd to seeing the next couple issues,

Subject: Re: Human Drummers (From the musician's standpoint)


	Well, just have to put my $0.02 worth into this discussion.
Live drums are a good thing. Samples can't replace them, whether as
drum loops or as the studio-sampled drums used in drum machines. 
They just sound different. As far as 'Feel' goes, that's the most important
part of the comparison. For techno, sure, I program my drums using my 
sequencer. For other projects, I play 'em myself. Techno is one thing;
I'm not the most incredible drummer in the world, but I don't know any 
drummer that can hold a 4/4 beat at ca.130-160bpm (yes, I get that fast on
occasion) for ANY length of time. Hence the use of a drum machine/sampler/
sequencer. A machine can keep that bass drum locked right on top of that
bassline for hours, and I don't have to worry about re-takes. 
	The machine is limited, though. If you want bizzarre time signatures,
it can do that, but the whole point of using real drums with a real drummer
is FEEL. You CAN sequence drums that sound like they are being played live...
however, you don't program it, you hook a MIDI'd set of electronic drums 
into the sequencer and play 'em in. No quantization, no digital tricks.
You better hope your sequencer has a high enough resolution to pull
it off, though.
	Anyway, like I said, just my $0.02. Enough of my babbling. :)

Now for something completely different:

( Skip to the end to read the event flier )

I know of a lot of us go to raves in search of various forms of
altered conciousness and new ways of relating to people.  A good crowd
can be lifted into a state of shared consciousness by a "god-like"
set; many of us have been lucky enough to feel that sometimes.  Some
folks have expressed interest in shamanistic religious practices in
other cultures, where drumming, dancing, and botanicals are used to
create a profoundly different reality.  Interesting claims are also
made for S&M.

So, check this out.  Last Saturday night, my SO and I attended a
participatory performance by the "X-Plicit Players", who among other
things, design clothing and repeatedly get arrested for public nudity
in Berkeley.  This was not your basic night out watching yet another
"experimental" theater piece, it was more like a new raft for riding
the psychic whitewater.  The crew used a variety of interesting
techniques to detach us from our everyday personalities and thought
patterns so that as a group we could all join in the spell that was
woven.  Vocal repetition, body paint, pheremones, ambient heat, and
(quite subtly) prolonged silence on the part of the participants were
all brought to bear, along with a few low-tech audio toys. Oh, and it
lasted six hours.  Brainwashing, by hand, with organic soap.

To begin, we were led into the theater one at a time by a woman
wearing only body paint and a wristwatch, and placed at various points
around a well-heated room, with a least a hand on some other person.
As this was going on, Debbie Moore was hypnotically half-chanting in
counterpoint with her own recorded voice, about letting go of fear,
being able to play like babies, overcoming society's programming, and
stuff like that.  Once the "human sculpture" was complete, the players
commenced a series of body "readings".  This entailed two or more
people hugging one of us "audience" and Debbie, head mike, body paint,
and all, improvising on what was going through one's mind.  While what
she said was sort of generic ( of course I was feeling anxiety and
desire to love, or why would I be there ? ), the effect was to
heighten suggestibility.  Thinking back on it, I don't remember
particular phrases so much as a carefully-constructed ambience.  To
those of you who feel that song lyrics disrupt your trances, consider
that *some* lyrics may well induce a collective trance state pretty
well, though "dance while the record spins" doesn't quite do it.

The next phase of the evening was for the audience to sit in a circle
around most of the cast, who enacted what in rave terms could be
called a fantasy slither pile ( apologies to mw ).  One of the guys
was sometimes absent from the embrace so he could fiddle with the
digital delay and the cassette player.  After another 1/2 hour or so
the narration got a little more directive, that we should be ready to
play, that touching need not be sex, that we should feel with our
whole bodies, that like babies we should be open to sensation, that we
were to stay safe (i.e. orifices off-limits).

So by the end of the second hour, we all got our clothes off, and got
blindfolds on.  We were then led over to lie / sit with our various
anonymous neighbors and were moved through some directed carresses,
led by cast members.  Thrill #1: the gender was indeterminate at
first.  Being naked and anonymous and programmed gave us the license
to do most anything that was wasn't orgasm-oriented.  It was pretty
great being able to lose my self in waves of being touched.  Then came
Thrill #2: changing partners.  Now I had to "make advances" as the
other guy seemed, well, shy, or something (though not for long:), and
I figured taht testing my limits was better than getting bored.  Oh,
and Thrill #3: the blindfold came loose.  Honest, I didn't mean it!
So now I got a peek of what my spouse was up to.  Anyway, back to
playing.  This phase lasted about 90 minutes.  The constant stream of
suggestions and instructions helped us get to a place a little bit
outside of time, though I admit that 90 minutes turned out to be long
enough.  So there followed a chill-out period with the 'cast'
returning to their original pile and reading lengthy raps about
themselves.  "Audience" members exchanged glances; funny how somebody
didnt' meet my eye :-) (men are *all* alike !-).  Gradually we got to
the point of a few shy questions, and then the gathering broke up with
everyone invited to participate in future events, such as the flier I
attach to this message.

So there you have it.  A subtly controlled, overwhelming sensory
environment which led some people to do some things they might not
otherwise do.  The hypnotic repetitious claim that "this is not sex"
was, er, disingenuous, but what the hey, it was a way of granting
permission, and of looking at sensual pleasure outside of one's normal
ideas about who is attractive or of the appropriate gender.  I
certainly got to some emotional places I hadn't visited in years. ("So
you claim you're 'heterosexual but not straight', eh?  Try this on!").
There were some boundaries getting temporarily dissolved, ov course in
a manner that allows for easy denial afterwards.  All in all a
worthwhile experience, tho not what I'd do every weekend.  How does
that saying go, "Exploring sensuality without conquering fear is like
eating an egg without salt"?  Something like that.  But enough of
this, confession is only for Catholics anyway :-).

Subject: Love Parade in SF?


Hi, this is my first time posting after being an sfraves voyeur for the
past couple of months. I got into raves about a year ago while in college
back east at Harvard and this past summer I attended the main rave event
in Germany called the "Love Parade"

The Love Parade is best described as the Rose Parade on E. The country's
top DJs and PAs call from all over blasting their music up and down
the Ku'Damm, Berlin's main street. After the parade, I went to Love Party
where DJs from Europe and the US played in two abandoned East German
tank depots. There was a carnival-like atmosphere as approx. 3000 people 
(could've been more) crammed into the place.  

Anyway, my question to all you out there: Could that happen here?
Would you want it happen here? Or does it seem too "above"ground?

I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

On a ragga tip,

O.

doesn't automatically mean that it doesn't kill brain cells - plus dentists & 
doctors mix it with some oxygen instead
of administering pure nitrous.  Also, once I did a hit with an African American
friend of mine and what I saw made me slightly scared:  he did a hit of 
nitrous until he almost passed out (he let go of the half-full balloon) and the

Not bad although remember your messing with a little micro-economy here.
Some of those vendors rely on these fairs to make their living and won't 
like being "cut out" Like wise for the beer and sausage stands.  I say
let them stay if people want to buy the stuff fine, if not fine.  Add smart
bar, vendors like ameba and housewares.  If you really want this to happen you
have to go and get the paperwork and permits NOW.

	IMHO, Mondo has become more mis-info-centered.  Mondo is a good
publication for people interested in "what if..."  And gaga-eyed views of what
already exists.  It is a good magazine for humor value, but it would be the last
thing anyone would ever want to reference in a research paper.

                      Inaugural Poem Text
 
  AP 01/20 13:33 EST V0522
  Copyright 1992. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
  
     WASHINGTON (AP) -- Text of the inaugural poem written by Maya Angelou and
  delivered by the poet Wednesday safternoon at Bill Clinton's swearing-in. 

     A Rock, A River, A Tree 
     Hosts to species long since departed, 
     Marked the mastodon. 
     The dinosaur, who left dry tokens 
     Of their sojourn here 
     On our planet floor, 
     Any broad alarm of their hastening doom 
     Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages. 
     But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully, 
     Come, you may stand upon my 
     Back and face your distant destiny, 
     But seek no haven in my shadow. 
     I will give you no more hiding place down here. 
     You, created only a little lower than 
     The angels, have crouched too long in 
     The bruising darkness, 
     Have lain too long 
     Face down in ignorance. 
     Your mouths spilling words 
     Armed for slaughter. 
     The Rock cries out today, you may stand on me, 
     But do not hide your face. 
     Across the wall of the world, 
     A River sings a beautiful song, 
     Come rest here by my side. 
     Each of you a bordered country, 
     Delicate and strangely made proud, 
     Yet thrusting perpetually under siege. 
     Your armed struggles for profit 
     Have left collars of waste upon 
     My shore, currents of debris upon my breast. 
     Yet, today I call you to my riverside, 
     If you will study war no more. Come, 
     Clad in peace and I will sing the songs 
     The Creator gave to me when I and the 
     Tree and the stone were one. 
     Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your 
     Brow and when you yet knew you still 
     Knew nothing. 
     The River sings and sings on.
     There is a true yearning to respond to 
     The singing River and the wise Rock. 
     So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew 
     The African and Native American, the Sioux, 
     The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek 
     The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheikh, 
     The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher, 
     The privileged, the homeless, the Teacher. 
     They hear. They all hear 
     The speaking of the Tree. 
     Today, the first and last of every Tree 
     Speaks to humankind. Come to me, here beside the River. 
     Plant yourself beside me, here beside the River. 
     Each of you, descendant of some passed 
     On traveller, has been paid for. 
     You, who gave me my first name, you 
     Pawnee, Apache and Seneca, you 
     Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then 
     Forced on bloody feet, left me to the employment of 
     Other seekers -- desperate for gain, 
     Starving for gold. 
     You, the Turk, the Swede, the German, the Scot ... 
     You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought 
     Sold, stolen, arriving on a nightmare 
     Praying for a dream. 
     Here, root yourselves beside me. 
     I am the Tree planted by the River, 
     Which will not be moved. 
     I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree 
     I am yours -- your Passages have been paid. 
     Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need 
     For this bright morning dawning for you. 
     History, despite its wrenching pain, 
     Cannot be unlived, and if faced 
     With courage, need not be lived again. 
     Lift up your eyes upon 
     The day breaking for you. 
     Give birth again 
     To the dream. 
     Women, children, men, 
     Take it into the palms of your hands. 
     Mold it into the shape of your most 
     Private need. Sculpt it into 
     The image of your most public self. 
     Lift up your hearts 
     Each new hour holds new chances 
     For new beginnings. 
     Do not be wedded forever 
     To fear, yoked eternally 
     To brutishness. 
     The horizon leans forward, 
     Offering you space to place new steps of change. 
     Here, on the pulse of this fine day 
     You may have the courage 
     To look up and out upon me, the 
     Rock, the River, the Tree, your country. 
     No less to Midas than the mendicant. 
     No less to you now than the mastodon then. 
     Here on the pulse of this new day 
     You may have the grace to look up and out 
     And into your sister's eyes, into 
     Your brother's face, your country 
     And say simply 
     Very simply 
     With hope 
     Good morning.

Subject: Re: Love Parade, not some insipid street fair(e)!


Sounds like a good idea. However, rather than having it be a fully rave
event, howzabout just having one stage be the rave-stage (with SF's DJs
showing us their trix), while other stages have live music. Let the vendors
sell beer, nitrate/protein-dogs, cotton candy and whatever.

Perhaps this could even be tagged onto an existing event, such as the SF
carnaval, or that other hoo-ha that they have during the summer in the
mission.  Might also make it easier to get permits if this is seen as a
"diversity" thing rather than a "special interest" thing.

W/r/t the German love parade thing, i've heard they have similar "sound
system in the park" days in the southern UK, with various ragga-folk
setting up sound systems and having a
my-sound-system-is-more-massive-than-yours acoustic battle. Sounds like it
could get noisy, but noise is good for you.

Subject: Nitrous


Without being pro or anti drug, I've seen ** EXCESSIVE ** nitrous use
before --- 6 ft across balloons, continuous use (in well-ventilated
rooms with sofas) for 2 or 3 hours, etc --- with otherwise normal
people who ** apparently ** suffer no ill effects, long or short term,
from such usage.

On the other hand, I've seen 1) people who just react badly to
nitrous, getting headaches or passing out for long periods of time 2)
really radically questionable and dangerous behavior by users of
nitrous (i.e. bad judgement) and 3) bizarre interactions with other
drugs.

I'm not saying everyone should drive around with a 20 lb canister in
their trunk and a gas mask ala 'Blue Velvet', but it's not heroin.

I'm still very very interested in strong references which give
evidence of bodily damage from using nitrous (other than passing out
and hitting the floor, an old friend has stitches from this, actually,
probably the most common danger from nitrous use that I've seen).
Some people that I love are still definite nitrous fans, and if they
are hurting themselves, I'd like to know about it.

just as an interesting side note, one of the things that freaked me
out most about the Chicago rave scene (if you could call it a scene)
was that the rave promoters allow people to come in and openly sell
nitrous, $5 for a huge balloon (15-20 hits).  OK, I bought one, but it

I was at a rave called Sharon last year in SF and there was nitrous
being sold for $5 a balloon.  Funky.

My God.  You are about to encounter the biggest time-wastin,
addictive, and slackful thing since Robotron: 2084....USENET.

You read news through (appropriately enough) newsreaders.  Try typing
'man rn' or 'man nn' at the unix command line.  One of these is bound
to be there.  They will set themselves up in your $HOME directory.

I recommend rn for beginners, then trn or nn later on.

Have fun!

Well, I haven't been on the net for a long old time, so I apologize
to all of thepee people who posted the 424 messages I had...nothing
personal..
my big question, I guess is --is the WICKED really going to be somewhere
else other than the lame street garage?  Also, did anything come of 
Mykl's messages to the Gathering folks?

Oh, a quick note...the reason for my not being on is this weekend..
My senior acting recital is gonna happen this saturday night, and
if any of you need to do some free theatre type stuff before you 
go dancing, you are more than welcome to drop by....

It's down in Santa Clara at Santa Clara University in the Fess Parker
Studio Theatre, which is in the Louis B. Mayer theatre on the corners of
Lafayette and Franklin (it's really easy to find) and it starts  at 8
o'clock.  It's a one show deal, so if you can make and are in the area,
it'd be great to have you there. Zak and Brian (right Brian?) and Leah (
if Brian has asked her) are coming, so...I will be having a small reception
at my house and then hopefully will be going off to wicked, if my rave
partners aren't too burned out after Get Down get Down...



so hope things are good, and I will be on the net more often after this 
weekend.

mike
(the recital: 8pm in the Fess...free admission.  Come EARLY (like 7:30)
cuz a lot of people (I hope!)  will be coming.

take carez

Subject: Wickedless Weekend

Sorry to be the one to bear disappointing news, but the word according
to Garth is that the Wicked planned for this Saturday is off.

As Robert J. mentioned, Garth will be at Groove Kitchen, which has been
mega-kicking the past few weeks.

You can also meet your weekly Jeno/Garth quota by going to Get Down,
Get Down Friday night.  The word here is "cool but legal underground
space with two sound systems" (uh-huh...)

Wait, there's more... a flyer was JUST HANDED TO ME in the form of an
Ace of Clubs (cute).  On the back it reads:

        Let the funk begin!
        Friday, January 22   10:00 PM
        375 1st @ Harrison
        DJs Gavin Manny Dani Jan Coolie

So that's where the housy deep stuff will be found.  I'm told Paul Floppy
is behind this venture.  (Warning: Jon D. and Jonathan S.!)

Can anyone tell I just returned from Housing Project?

There is a GIF of me, Todd Sines, Damian "dieselBoy" Higgins,
and our friends right now on cs.uwp.edu in pub/incoming/pictures/alt.rave,
under the name ohio1.gif.  but grab it fast; soon it will be replaced with
a JPEG (smaller file, different format, same quality).

ohio2.gif is a GIF of dieselBoy spinning at the Smart Bar in Cleveland,
where they have a mixer with *knobs*.

ohio3.gif is 3 color pictures from House of Euphoria rave in Cincinnati
back in November.  One is of people dancing, one is of Richie Hawtin, one
is of Kevy Kev.

All of these will be replaced with JPEGs soon, so if you don't have JPEG

	Oh man it's late... well that goes to show ya what happens when you buy
a new toy (in my case a 303) and you finally learn how to USE it, and you just
go bonkers over it... anyways, I'd recommend Get Down Get Down for Friday 
night, though to be honest I haven't heard Tony or Markem X in awhile and
would thus be interested in TipToe, and Jon Williams comes highly regarded
too.  For Saturday, I would highly recommend Groove Kitchen because I had
such a great time there last week; one of the promoters, Kenny, is truely
an example of someone who works hard at creating a vibe without trying to
steamroller you with gizmos or cheesy offers.  But since it's 21+ and the
door guys tend to be strict, I would suggest Wally World, mainly because
the lineup (particularly Robbie Hardkiss, Carlos, and possibly Michael Cook)
sounds interesting.... 

	Whatever you do, enjoy!

>a /slightly/ ;) good time _can_ be had from inhaling whipped cream cans.
>they're called whipits.

Or a raging good time, depending on who ya ask.  And, whipit is a brandname
for this particular brand of nitrous canisters that fit this seltzer
bottle-looking whip cream maker (or other discharging devices) and you
can use it to inhale from by not adding cream, which would make whip cream.
It's the best way if you can't score a tank.

AND

Since were on nitrous stories, I've got an interesting little anecdote.
when I was in 10th grade I worked at a veterinarian clinic in the east
bay (that shall remain unamed!) and my job was to come in at 5:30 in the
morning, feed the animals, take stats, clean cages, clean facility, etc.
Well, being alone for the full 3 hours or so in the morning, nitrous
being one of my faves (especialy in 10th grade), and since there was
a big tank sitting there, one thing led to another.  Well alright, so
there wasn't really a big long chain of events leading to it but I hit
that tank every morning once I discovered how to operate it.  It was
the inspiration to get me out of bed at 5:00 a.m. back in those days.
Usualy I had it timed just right so that as I was standing or sitting
there in front of the tank and dispenser machine and I started to come
on, I would start to turn the valve shut and just get it closed in time
before entering la la land.  This one time, however, I decided to wait
and see what would happen if I just kept inhailing.  I remember standing
there with my eyes open and then realizing they were closed, openeing
them and noticing that I was now on my knees.  I didn't have much time
to trip on that though, because the next thing I remember is feeling
the sensation of falling forward, feeling intense pain (or knowing it
was supposed to be) on the bridge of my nose as I struck the charcoal
filter on the dispenser machine in front of me by falling into it.  The
next thing I remember is waking up on the ground with a very cold ear
as the tube that I was holding in my mouth was now next to me on the
ground still dispensing cold gas - into my ear.  I had been out for
probably under 30 seconds and maybe a lot less.  I now felt realy natious,
had a black eye and swollen upper nose for a week and may have actualy
broke it, theres a small lump that has never gone away.  I still love
the stuff, though.  I was just being a stupid-ass, the kind that get
hurt by being stupid and then make a bad name for that activity or drug.

About reactions and effects, one friend of mine goes into really weird
convulsions and arm gestures when he does/did gas.  And as far as I go,
my girlfriend hates it when I do it because I turn real wight and my
lips turn real blue (and I must look like a druling idiot when I'm under).

Now, I know I must sound like I do it alot but honestly I don't.  It's
kinda like psychedelics, I love it but it's not the kind of thing I have
the urge to do a lot.  In fact something has to trigger the memory of it
for me to even think about it, like seeing people walk by with baloons or
something.  And as far as health goes, I thing it's fine to do recreationaly
infrequently but I wouldn't do it a exesively.

Well, I can ID with that. I did three whip-it's in a row last Sat and fell

Once you've had a tank, you'll never go back.  Tank parties are the best, few
things put people in a festive mood faster than a room full of people with
balloons in their mouths....

We call that convulsing thing, "fried bacon", as in "Brad's doing the fried
bacon".  Really helps to maintain that jaded reputation as someone goes into
convulsions next to someone that has never done/seen nitrous before, and you
start laughing.

Balloons are the only way to go, people die when they pass out with a mask on
their face, seeing that balloon doing circles in the air is a decent indication
that someone needs some O2.  As long as you get some oxygen with your gas, I
think it's pretty benign

Funniest thing on the tank is "Caution: Contents may cause Euphoria"  OH NO!
NOT EUPHORIA!!!!

Anyone thinking of getting a tank?

Oh, dude, I practically wigged reading your description..I had the
same thing happen when I was a little kid, at a dentists' office back
when pediatric dentists were a RareThing.  They didn't believe that
there was something wrong, and just kept piling those lead-apron
things on top of me....I don't know what happened then, but I don't
want to talk about it - lots of Freudian angst.....

So, I have a extra-extra fear of the dentist now, and I will *never*
have anything put over my face like that again....

On a side note, every time I go to the dentist now, I hallucin8 and
see tons and tons little Keith-Haring-esque Gingerbread people on the
ceiling - oh, the innocent fun games of the hallucination generation.
Psychedelic Circus.

Just keep doin' acid, ya bastards...Why, these kids today with their
nitrous and their weird hair and.....I can remember when we had to pay
$8 for a hit of acid, boy, those were the daze, my friends, those were
the daze....=)

>Anyone else had a bad nitrous trip? :-/

Ya, this one time I had sort of a reverse nitrous experience.  We were all
sitting around doing whipits and I blacked out to where I could here and
understand what was going on around me, even more conciously than usual for
a nitrous trip but I couldn't open my eyes or move.  It was like being awake
and trapped in this body without being able to do anything but listen.  My
friends were all laughing at how I looked and I wanted to get it on laughting
at myself but I couldn't move or do anything.  Good thing I didn't panick as
a lot of people might have in this situation, it was kinda scary, but
fortuneatly I was also amused and just went with it.  I knew that I thought
it was just temporary and I wasn't dying or anything.  Afterwords my friends
didn't believe that I heard the whole thing until I repeated parts of the
conversations and experience.

Funny you should ask.  I found out about ketamine, it's effects, and that they
use it at vets while I worked at the vet clinic.  Needless to say, I was looking
for it the very next day.  Found it eventualy.  It was one of those rubber-top 
bottles that you use a syringe to draw the liquid from so I did that.  Put the
liquid in these little vacum sealed canisters they had there and took it home.
I read that it could be injected i.m. or smoked.  Since I wasn't about to try 
injecting myself (I thought that was pretty hard-core for a tenth-grader) I
knew that some how I needed to smoke this liquid.  I figured that the drug was
probably suspended in a liquid solution and that I might try evaporating it so
I put it on glass under a hot light.  The liquid evaporated and I was left with
this powder which I put in a big old hooter.  According to the dosage I was
supposed to take this was a lot of powder to have to try to smoke.  The
thing is that after all this trouble and smoking bad tasting powder, nothing
happened.  Any chemists out there know what might have gone wrong?  I have
been wondering all these years.

If you'd Todd Terry's December playlist you wouldn't be saying that he

is Billboard reporter who gets a lot of limited edition records.  Another 
thing is that I don't know what you been listening to but most of the 
stuff that Todd Terry has been doing for last five years has been more 
Hip-hop and/or garagy than anything.  Check De La Rock for a taste.  U.S.

	 I had one of the weirdest mental trips of my life while using nitrous.
         Some friends of mine had aquired a large tank of the stuff and we
         were smoking out and doing big balloons.  I was in this freaky head
         space where I decided to have a contest with my brain.  I thought of
         an original premise, then I built on it, then i kept repeating the
         sequence of thoughts in my mind, while adding a new thought each time
         through.  While I was doing this I was continuing to breath morenitrous.  (oxygen too of course!!!)  I got up to about 15 loosely

I dunno.... don't you like it when the dentist says
"Nowowowowow OuOuppeEeeeeen WiiiIIIIdDdDdDdDeeeeee..."
and then the sound degenerates into helicopter noises from 'Apocalypse Now'

W'hell, I did.

Hey, pull out a few more teeth maaaaan. I love it. Ooooh that sounds just
great... "chrrrchchriiiiip" (the sound of sinew and veins stretching,
ripping and bursting apart effervescently... sounds like sticking an
amplified contact mic into a shrimp as you crunch through...) yeah rip out
anotheranother...  go go go!

Oh cool. The drill. I love the way it resonates thru my head -- feels like
motorized nails on a chalkboard. Oooo. And that luscious smell of burning
bone -- reminds me of camp... God i love it! Give me more.

So anyway, that's why ravers like N20. When that bonecrusher soundsystem
grinds your brain into a meaty moist mulch. YOU DON'T CARE. When the
soundsystem is so loud it vibrates your fillings and painfully tingles your
nerve endings... YOU DON'T CARE. When you've been dancing so long it feels

ob-rave: UK vs 2nd String DJ's (rare groove)

Hey, I'm not old enough to know what the club/disco/funk scene was like in
the 70's, but it seems to me that alot of the "rare groove" that we all go
ape shit over nowadays is mostly Amerikkkan stuff that was primarily
ignored by the Amerikkkan mainstream, even though most of it is from
Amerikkka.

Somehow, the British DJs latched on to that seminal funk sound, labelled it
"rare groove", started playing that most excellent music in the UK, and
thoroughly popularized it. Meanwhile, Amerikkka was too busy sucking up
trashy disco, poppy dance trash, prog-rock and glam-rock and completely
ignored truly innovative dance music.

Then came the british rare groove spinoffs, bands that modernized some of
the rare groove sound (and sampled alot too) e.g. Soul II Soul, Massive
Attack, Young Disciples, etc.

This phenomenon also includes bands that originated the funk, like the
Meters. For a long time, the only way to get any songs at all off of their
excellent out of print album "Cabbage Alley" was to get UK rereleases by
companies like Charly and ??? (can't remember the name). Or just listen to
the samples off of rap albums, (or wait for the red-hot-chili peppers to do
a cover thereby enabling white US kids to claim the music as their own..._)

Why is it that I have to buy a 5-CD UK release "Top 100 dance hits of the
70's" or the excellent Mastercuts "Classic Funk vol 1 & 2" to get any
disco/funk era stuff that approximates rare groove...  otherwise, you just
find USA releases giving you the same old KTEL top-40 pap.

So I'd say that the brits have their collective thumbs on the pulse of
Amerikkan music originators, and are savvy at rereleasing and marketing the
stuff. Meanwhile, Amerikkka is all-thumbs on the pulse of innovative music
in general -- Amerikkkans won't accept a form of music until it's gone
across the atlantic and come back again, in slick new repackaging. And
preferably after the innovative group has broken up, died, commited
suicide, became alchoholic/junkies or some other act of despair caused by
lack of local recognition.

Maybe it's that stupid Amerikkkan attitude that "European == good/hip/cool".
And that's stupid cuz there's just as many dumb fuck rednecks in Europe as
there are in the states, it's just that the Europeans wear funny hats and
stupid-looking leather pants and are therefore obviously more quaint and cool.
Big shit, so we have strip-malls and burger kings; they have catherdals and
museums. It's all the same. Really.

When I had my wisdom teeth pulled, the dentist gave me gas, and I had

"orthodontist" and "brontosaurus". I had a very vivid hallucination of
dinosaurs pulling my wisdom teeth!!! This great big brontosaurus had his
hands in my mouth, while little pterodactyls (the flying leather dinosaurs)
swooped back and forth giving advice!

The dentist turned the gas down at this point, probably because of the look
of euphoria that I had on my face!

Maybe you evaporated the ketamine, and the powder was some impure stuff

TAXI here,

here's something to get you folks paranoid about SF cops:

On Thurs, Jan 21st SF Chronicle there's an article on pg. A17 called,

"Less Spying Now, SF Cop Says"  But ACLU lawyer asks whether new guidelines
   are enforced  by Ken Hoover, Chronicle Staff Writer

I'll quote little pieces from this article:

"An uproar over allegations that a former SF police inspector may have sold
intelligence files to foreign government agents led a top police official to
say yesterday that procedures for gathering data on political groups have been
greatly resticted in the past two years.
.....
"Gerard, 50, is believed to be in the Philippines, possibly outside the reach
of police and FBI investigations into allegations, as disclosed first in the 
Chronicle last week, that he sold police files to outside groups.
......
"Under new rules, undercover officers no longer attend meetings of groups
planning demonstrations, he said.  [sure, yeah, I believe them, uh huh .....]
.....
"Two years earlier [to Nov. 1990], the ACLU had publicized police files
obtained through several lawsuits.  The files showed that during the 1984
Democratic National Convention in SF, police had gathered intelligence on
nearly 100 groups, including the ACLU itself.
 As a result of the current guidelines, the police Intelligence Division was
abolished.  High-ranking authority is needed for monitoring political groups,
and officers cannot gather intelligence on individuals solely because of their
political activities.  [ yeah, now they need the 'drug' excuse I bet....]
......
"'These guidelines are only worth the paper they are written on unless somebody
is willing to enforce them,' Crew [of the ACLU] said.  'So far, they (the 
police) only do something when it's in the headlines.'
......
"He [Crew] said the commission failed to conduct its annual audit last year,
as the guidelines require.  He demanded an audit in a letter January 8, less
than a week before news of the Gerard investigation broke.
......
"last year [after the new guidelines were passed], former Chief Richard 
Hongisto approved an investigation in 
conjunction with the riots and demonstrations after the Rodney King verdict. 
Willett declined to reveal specifics, but said Hongisto approved his request,
which led to arrests and the seizure of Molotov cocktails."  [huh, I wonder
why I didn't hear of these arrests along with the Molotov cocktails - it
should have been big news, I think...!!?!]
-----------------
Well that's the jist of the article.  I'm not sure why Americans can
call their country a 'free' country with this shit going on.  Sounds like some
of the tactics I've heard the Soviet police were up to during the cold war....
I wonder if Russia is a freer country than Amerikkka is now?

information is power, 
we are all little patches of the same fabric......

Hi Gang--

I've been enjoying this whole discussion,
partly because even though I was around in the
70s and before I was into music other than
the club/disco stuff--Roxy, Bowie, Eno, glam
rock, etc., were my metier then. However, Niels
has put his finger on an important musicultural
phenomenon: how the Brits have so frequently had
an ear for things American that the Americans 
haven't had themselves.  The "answer," if there is     
one, is assuredly complex, having to do with Ameri-
can racism, not being able to see the trees for the
forest (thus, those more distant have a better sense
of what's there), a tradition of British export-
import of American music (remember the so-called
"British Invasion" of the mid-sixties), and differences
in how music industry decisions are made in each country.
Besides these four, however, there's one that Niels doesn't
see.  After ripping us down and raising the Brits up for
the availability of rare groove he sez:

Maybe it's that stupid Amerikkkan attitude that "European ==
good/hip/cool".
And that's stupid cuz there's just as many dumb fuck
rednecks in Europe as
there are in the states,

Bullshit, Niels. An acquaintence with chaos theory alone
would verify for you that there are at least twice as
many dumbfucks here--and THAT'S the MAIN reason wht this
good stuff is always coming back to us and why we generally
don't value it as much in the first place.  It's no con-
spiracy; the subspecies Homo sapiens boobus americanus was
recognized by American writer-satirist and linguist H.L.
Mencken many years ago--and if anything the tribe has
grown.  WE invented rednecks!  Whilst it is true that there
are in fact dumbfucks in Europe (look at Nazis, ethnic
cleansers, and royalty), it is not so much our attitude
that "European==good/hip/cool" (and I agree that attitude DOES 
and HAS existed here for many a generation) as that we
are blind  (or in this case, deaf) to our own great indiginous
music, especially when it involves race.  Europeans are
big on racism, too; don't get me wrong--I'm not pleading
their case, but we're talking about how THEY and WE hear
American music.  Get my point?  Whaddaya think?

What kind of music does he listen to?


In Ohio, and most of the East coast listen to hardcore and breakbeat. But he
does like groups such as Moby and the Aphex Twins. He works at a record store
here in Columbus so he is exposed to different music.

4. Do bag like a joint:
   a. Breath in a hit from bag.

since there is all this talk about nitrous, i guess i'll throw in

found out that the air conditioning unit for my old apartment was on
top of the roof where i used to live.  we went up there and started
doing freon hits.  yes FREON!!  this gives you a similar feeling, but
a bit more metallic is the only way i can describe it.

well, my friend ritz was sitting on the edge of the freon unit after
taking a hit (it kinda creeps up on ya, comes in waves that get stronger)
and all of a sudden looks at me and goes "who are YOU?" and falls off
the unit.

not extremely funny.  also very dangerous.  i don't know that much about
freon OR nitrous (except from doing them) but from what i've heard freon
is extremely dangerous, and i'm not recommending it.

Sorry, Will, that's ridiculous.  What has chaos theory got to do with 
the dumbfuck count in North America vs. Europe?  As Americans, I 
think you and me both are just more sensitive to / aware of
the failings of Americans.  There's certainly some ugly racism
in the U.S., but we haven't had an Auschwitz or a Bosnia. Ever.
Of course, the US has exported a lot of misery, like in the Vietnam
war.  But look back a few years; that's what Europe, esp. the Dutch
and the British, did with the slave trade.  I'm willing to call
it even, just so I don't have to hear about who is and isn't
"cultured".  At least Americans know how to avoid dehydration :-).

I agree with this part.  And I think it was much of Niels' point, too.

I just can't handle Euro-centric
anti-Americanism, especially when lily-white Euro-liberals who have never
lived in a multi-ethnic society prattle piously about American racism.
They're started to get multi-ethnic in Western Europe these last
few years, and they`re acting every bit as awful as people do in
the U.S.  I don't like the KKK, the crack wars, or the mandatory
minimum laws any better than y'all do,  but by and large we only
burn down our low-income housing to collect insurance money, not
to kill the occupants, like in *some* counties I won't mention.

I know I'm risking getting flamed to a crisp, but Europeans IMHE (E=experience
not the other!) are a bit more sophisticated about music.  For one thing,
popular music is more cross-generational.  You see older folks listening to
Heavy Metal (I'm sorry for cursing :o) and younger folks listening to Bartok.
As well, if I took a random sampling of radio stations, I'd hear things
wild enough to only make college radio here.  (Particularly in England
and some of the more "enlightened" countries on the Continent.)  Heck, I
remember watching Channel 4 Saturday mornings in England in the early Eighties
and seeing Nina Hagen music videos between cartoons!  I remember remarking
to one of my associates there about this (he was about 20 years older than
me) and he said, "that's the pop stuff.  Won't ya come over and hear this
new group called Test Dept."  Playing the music for my
friends back in the States, they thought I had joined a satanic cult 
and/or a metal-workers union and wouldn't stay in the same room when I 
played some of it.  

But I'm sure I'm getting off the subject.............

So what?  My friends thought I was nuts to go see punk and alternative
concerts in the '80s, until they caught on.  It is fairly hard to throw
something brand new onto someone who isn't used to it.  I hated the Pixies
when I first heard them, now I've got every release.  I thought System 7 was
too disco diva when I first heard it, now I love it.  I thought Nightmares on
Wax was utter trash, now it is a gem.

You're still talking about the general public aren't we Tahl?  I think the
European general public is just as clueless as the American.  But as for the
underground, look at how England is starting to adopt Seattle grunge as it's
"own".

Well, maybe there's a larger subculture of "sophisticated
Europeans", but the current top 8 British albums, according
to Gallup for Music, Ltd. and the BBC, are these:

1  Cher - Cher's Greatest Hits
2  Erasure - Pop!: The First 20 Hits
3  Genesis - Live
4  Michael Bolton - Timeless
5  Gloria Estefan - Greatest Hits
6  Simple Minds - Glittering Prize 81/92
7  Abba - Gold: Greatest Hits
8  Freddie Mercury - The Freddie Mercury Album

I don't know if this is directly comparable to the Billboard
list (that is, a reflection of record sales), but I think it's
funny that their top eight are all 'greatest hits' things.

Also, the #4 single: WWF Superstars, "Slam Jam". :)

I've bought DMAE in health food stores... rainbow should have it, for

PABA/ethanol dissolved stuff tastes terrible.

It might well be.  Someone was telling me, they were in the permit office of
the SF police department looking to get a permit to throw a rave, and the cops
had in front of them every flyer of every major rave for the following weekend.
They simply call the numbers, and if it's not in a legal place and within their
jurisdiction they go check it out.  This is why I don't post directions to the
FMR's until late at night (and I'm considering stopping posting them at all).

It would not be hard for the cops to monitor this; I do no type of screening on
new users (and I never will).  BUT, I would tend to think that the sheer volume
of posts on sfraves would tend to make their use of this rather futile.  Maybe
they're just on the calendar list....

Gang, am I the only person in distress over the rapidly plummeting
level of discussion in this group?

I once thought (obviously naively) that the whole point of rave culture
was to break down the barriers between race, gender, nationality and
other artificial distinctions between humanity.  What is this bullshit
about whether the Brits are inferior to us because all they do is
recycle parts of our culture we neglect or vice versa?  My head is
spinning (and not from doing too many whippits)!

Isn't it obvious that there are amazingly talented people on both sides
of the Atlantic?  Isn't it obvious that the evolution of art involves
interlocking webs of mutual influence?  Isn't it obvious that not everybody
likes all kinds of music, but that we can respect and admire the astonishing
degree of diversity that the world has to offer us?

And about this nitrous/ketamine/freon thread... anyone looking at this
from the outside world (and you can be *certain* we're being watched)
is going to be hard-pressed to avoid the conclusion that raves are first
and foremost about drugs.  And to be honest, after the last few days, I'm
starting to wonder myself...

In Brian's intro message, he said that what attracted him to the SF Scene
was that drugs were not the whole point of the exercise up here.  I'm not
here to tell people what they can or cannot do, or post about, but there
are other forums that are dedicated to this subject.

Sorry to lash out, but I'm really about this close ==> <== to unsubscribing.

	No u r not the only one, I'm with u too.

I also like to add something: we should try to keep these discussions about 
specific topics (like Nitrous or America versus Europe) readable.
What I mean is that if we all keep posting very long e-mail with two or three
level of cross-references, we basically create a useless network traffic
that most of the people on the list won't be able to read (for time reasons
mostly). 

So let's try to be always open-minded and not ready to flame someone else
right away and let's also try to post e-mails that fit in one page unless
is really necessary to make them longer.
Last but not least let's try to post only when we are adding significant
informations to the discussion that is going on and not post only because
is cool to post or replay.

the traffic like Mykl.

Yes indeed you make good points, Derek and Pete.  I admit I am a bit
Eurocentric (but only after having seen both sets of cultures).  

I do think, however, that television and radio *do* represent the public taste 
& based on that there seems to be a higher level of "sophistication" (whatever
you attribute to that word) among the average Eurojoe.  It's all relative and
very subjective I suppose.  The chart cited is perhaps not representative of
this as it would not describe the breadth of the average listener's taste
but the lowest common denominator.  I would speculate that the LCD of most
Western societies is about the same:  ick!

Before I get flamed some more, let me turn over for an even bake!  ;-)

>ObRave:  What's up on the Alternity/Connection front?

Well, going to school and having a full time job has meant I haven't had
much time to seriously think about it, and the rain has generally dampened
my mood to have another outdoor one.  I've been shying away from indoor
spaces mainly because going indoors brings a whole new set of liabilities
and such... when it gets sunnier and the rain seems less threatening I am
definitely up for having another Connection outdoors somewhere, and if
someone can come up with and find a good indoor space for not too much money
(say, $3/per person it can hold) then I'll be re-interested.....  I mean,
I know the enthusiasm is there, but the means currently aren't.  If you have
a good idea about a location, put some research into it, ask around, rather
than saying "did anyone think of...", etc, and if you can find something I'm
all ears :)

Yeah, that's what made alt.rave totally worthless now.  Even dragged
Brian and I into it.  (Not that I don't enjoy good ol' internet flame
fests, just don't want to see them start here.)

There's plenty of places on USENET to discuss these types of
things.  One of the nicest things about this list is the friendly
atmosphere of the discussions and the fact that we are all here with a
common interest...I (IMNSHO) would prefer it if the list could stay a

A lot of what we discuss here is duplicated on alt.drugs.  Also, on
alt.drugs, there is another chemist named Howard who is eminently more

I totally agree.  I think a lot of stuff gets posted here because people
feel more comfortable talking about certain things in front of the people
on the list than in front of thousands of strangers on USENET; but they
should also know there are legal ways of making anonymous posts to newsgroups
too if they feel uncomfortable there.  Also, is there any real difference
between the thousands of people who read USENET and the 250 who read this?
Maybe you shouldn't feel so comfortable talking about drug use here. 

Let's TRY and refocus on why we're all here - I definitely want people to
bring all sorts of discussion topics in, but try and put a measure of thought
into what you're saying.  40-60 messages a day is a LOT to go through.
Also, when you reply to a post, please consider whether it's something everyone
really wants to see, or something that's more appropriate to send to simply
the original writer.  And whether I mention it or not, bandwidth really is
an issue too - 250 people * 50 messages a day is a LOT of mail folx, even for
a Sparcstation 10.

>Then again, who the fuck am I to dictate topics on the list?  Does
>anyone else feel this way?  (Besides MykL)

I've recently been getting a lot of complaints too, so I think there's a
silent majority of people out there who want the drug discussions phased
out too.  A few old-timers have even unsubscribed recently :(

Agreed.  If you don't have news access, I believe a news<=>mail gateway is
being set up for alt.drugs.,  I'll post more info when I get it.

Also, please realize that there are people from all over the world on the
list - 7 from the UK, a few from Canada, one in Mexico, one in France, one
in Slovenia, and one in Japan.  What we talk about here and what we say
are really a reflection of the scene.  And even though I'm definitely not
anti-drug, if drugs become the focal point of raves (and it's very close to
becoming so) then the rave scene will wither and die within 6 months.

Let's not let this happen.

OK, how about this for a constructive suggestion:

A lot of people want to talk openly about drug use, and no doubt they would
prefer the self-selected community of local area ravers to the wild-and-wooly
arena of alt.drugs (although as Howard pointed out, you can get some real
experts over there that aren't present on sfraves).

A lot of us don't want to be involved in these discussions, and would rather
they not even flow into our mailboxes.

Solution:  it's time to spawn a sublist, sfraves-drugs.  Why not?  We did
that with the short-lived sfraves-planners list.  If Brian sees fit, soda
can host this list.  Otherwise, maybe someone else who's interested can
set it up and administer it.  Whoever does it will be doing a lot of people
a major service!

Then, maybe we can start sfraves-cultural-superiority...  ;^)

Don't let squigg's post attacking Brian piss you off...I've been in

it takes news 3-4 days to get there so basically what happened is
this:

1.  He posted a lot of stupid stuff.
2.  I flamed him and killfiled him.
3.  He flamed me back (but I didn't see it since I'd killfiled him).
4.  Brian heroically jumps to my defense.
5.  I email Quigg and we talk and everything is hunky-dory.
6.  Brian's flame finally makes it to the U.K.
7.  A pissed off quigg mails me back and demands why Brian and I are
    assholes for being friendly and then flaming him again.
8.  I mail him back and it's all ok again.

Now, granted his post is clueless (like criticizing Brian for not
posting useful stuff to the net... the definition of 'without a clue')
it's probably best to let things lie.

the times i've been raving in orlando have been pretty good experiences.. 
if the edge was the best thing then you might've not been at the right 
places because it is pretty bad (comparatively)..

how bout barbarella where kimball collins djs sometimes?  he is a rather 
excellent dj..  check out his playlist in dj magazine this month..  (jan. 
1-14 issue)

the last time i was up there the drug use was very heavy..  at infonet 2 
(at which young american primitive appeared live, btw), i would estimate
(honestly) that about 90% were doing some type of chemicals..  i thought 
there were vending machines with e somewhere..  there are a lot of cops, 
though..  that's partially cuz it is such a tourist town..

so it's not as bad as you might think..  yes, raves are becoming 
overground many places, but there is _definately_ an underground too..

packed but no real excitement at all, despite the best efforts of
Carlos, who was perched on a ledge above the entrance doing the
entrance soca/salsa/techno thing.  The main floor was crowded but
not much dancing, and the groove seemed more like a rut.  Not  an
auspicious start for the evening.  I checked upstairs briefly,
in a series of rooms there were mural paintings, hats and other
gear for sale, a couple of semi-trance DJ setups, and packed in
the narrow hall with people coming and then going.

Next stop, Prophecy at, where else, the Troc.  This was in full
swing when I arrived, just in time for my set of the evening. 
I don't know who it was (Rick Preston? is he the one who covers up
all his record labels with tape?), but it was a good variety.
Somewhere along in the middle he started spinning something that
sounded like the React 2 Rythm CD I just got and have become quite
fond of.  The place just went wild, the fast-trancey stuff hits
everyone right *there* but I haven't heard a set yet where that
feeling is sustained for very long.  

Finally, Groove Kitchen which started in the King St. Garage.
Seemed fairly crowded and smoky, but not bad.  Some fairly nice
visuals including what must have been all of 'Pixar's Greatest
Hits' ;-)  But around 6 they started developing technical problems
(loose connection or what, I don't know), and shortly thereafter
everyone was shooed over into 177 Townsend.  This proved to be a
big plus, the change of venue got everyone jazzed and the extra
room was very nice.  Better sound too.  And I counted at least
*16* Intellibeams, they've really added a lot since the last
time I was there.  But the DJ was doing kind of mainstream house,
which I'm not particularly fond of.  All the same, better conditions
for groovin' in the kitchen (or, in Townsend's case, more like the
dining room!).

This was a spendy evening, but it was a chance to try out three
of these gigs back-to-back, a novel experience but one I'm not
likely to repeat.  I'm beginning to think that the Troc scene is
not bad at all, having been there twice now.

I'd have gone on through the end and perhaps to an after-event,
but duty calls, them ole Grateful Geezers are playing three nights
and Garth and Jeno add their spice outside the show on Tuesday, if
the ole SF Raves Guide is to be believed ;-)

Garth has been doing that forever, and Jeno seems to have just started 
(I don't think Rick Preston does it - btw Rick and Jeno sound a lot alike)
My guess is that DJ's do it for a couple of reasons: one, to clearly mark
those records as theirs, to deter thieves; two, to preserve the mystique
of their music (if everyone knew what their songs were, they would lose the
advantage of having a record when no one else does.) or 3) to keep those
DJ groupies (myself often included) from getting their faces 3 inches from
the spinning vinyl to try and read the words on the platter rotating 45
times a second.....

I don't think any of us want to deny that drugs are a part of raves;
but when 80% of the already huge amount of traffic is about drugs, what
can people deduce?  That raves are 80% about drugs?  That yeah, well, 
the music's okay, and it's really cool to stay out all night and watch the
sun rise, but mostly we go because we can't get enough of our favorite
substANcEs?

I hope not.

I am fervently pro-legalization, as you are, and at times recently I have
been motivated to go out and DO something to try and help turn the tide 
towards legalization.  That's partly my motivation for wanting to reprint
the info-E pamphlets that were being passed around last year, and come up
with info-A, and maybe info-N or info-2CB (which I have been hearing more
and more of, and NOBODY knows ANYTHING about it).  

BUT

I also stand by my position that if the rave scene becomes solely about drugs,
the scene doesn't have very long to live, and certainly whatever "point",
or "message", the scene has, won't carry very far in real society.

Drug discussions are _not_ verboten here.  Just use some judgement as to
posting, that's all.

Sounds like a good place to throw a party, though I'd be bummed if  all
the Deadheads that didn't get tickets decided to come and shout
"Jeeeeeerrrrrreeeee" and have loud three-hour long conversations about
what songs were played at that show in '79 where the space alients
captured them...

Groove Kitchen: uhhh... i guess it was ok, but i really wasn't into
Garth's music selection. I like funk, but that housy/diva stuff got
pretty annoying after a while. (What term would you apply to that kind
of music??). Maybe it was just my energy, but I found that there were
times when the groove was inspiring, and alot of times when it wasn't.

It did get alot better later in the evening, and when the party moved
to Townsend, it got even better, IMHO. It got a little more tribal, and
the rhythm got more interesting -- i guess that was Markie Mark, right?

Subject: prophecy


who was at PROHECY last night????
i thought the production was put up fairly well.  the only negative to what
was a great nite, was the hour and a 15 minute wait getting in.  i was freezing
in the cold and my stomach was growling from 11 hours of starvation.

i originaly went to Wally world first, but as i stood on line, Something did not
feel right..  I noticed that the crowd was not made up too many ravers, but was
more like "clubers".  the other thing that did not rest well for me were the security guards.  All that made me think the atmosphere was too "clubby" and i 
left there to goto Prophecy.    I got there at 1:10 and waited until 2:30.

when i went inside i got a little worried when i saw a pool table in the lobby
and saw people actualy shooting pool.  I was wondering if i was at the right 
place.  But the minute i stepped into the dance room, the place was definitely
happening.  the place was raging hard.  the first thing that came to mind was
a dinoysian festival, everyone jumping and partyng hard.

i was immediately attracted to the hard core.  i went up one stage and got really into it.  after dancing, i went to the chill out room.  It was one of the best
i have gone to in a long time.  the floor was lined with the fuffly cottony stuff.  And the trance was just incredible. It took me to another world.
the closeness in the toom was amazing.  everyone was sharing and co-existing
beautifully.  i had one of those portable, battery operated, messagers and it
worked great.  I was giving everyone messages.  
if anyone was there, i was wearing a white t-shirt with a picture of a acid rain
drop on it and i had a flannal shirt tied around my waist. and i had that 
massager and a bottle of water strapped to my back for part of the night.

Well I love wailing Diva music but I wasn't into the stuff that Garth or any
of them were playing.  They have a right to break out of musical ruts like
we have a right to put what ever we want on our turntables.  They are mixing
for us tis true but as we all know, its not like going to see a band.

I guess if you want house "done right" go to Love Garage.

REPLY TO 01/22/93 12:47 FROM dkl@frame.com: american ethnic cleansing

amerikkka hasn/t ever had a bosnia or an auschwitz...... true.

primarily because amerikkka is much more subtle about extermination.

we have had hundreds of thousdands of forced sterilizations of
latino and african american women in ny during i believe eisenhower
on into the 60/s

also, in the process of conquering the americas, 98% of the native
population was killed due to disease.... and that wasn/t completely
because our forebearers didn/t know we were carrying diseases - in
fact the first (i believe) documented biological warfare was the
spanish trading with polio tainted (exposed) merchandise....

when i say we, i mean the inheritors of a system whihc relies on
violence adn extermination as a behind the scenes way of maintaining
forcefull superiority over its own populations and other nations

we have had the proxy auschwitz/s of hiroshima and nagasaki and all
the cold war battles we fought through the lives of others in other
countries in africa, latin america, and south east asia

i/m not quite sure where i/m going with all this, except to suggest
the u.s. is a historically diabolical creature as are most if not
all other countries - the question shouldn/t be about degree or who
had what forms of mass anihilation - the issues should be about
getting everyone to know hitler can happen almost anywhere and in
some ways already has, or is happening, and that focusing on hitler
ignores the infinite number of other genocides possible and
historical

in a sense all cultures and nations are or have been perpetrators of
genocide, just not everyone has been a victim/casualty/survivor adn
i believe our top historical/ culture project is preventing by any
means necessary the continuation of the cycle of exterminations and
victims......

there is an interesting article in last weeks voice about how, in
some real sense, the ussr/s and the us/ policies in africa created
the horror of somalia we are now trying to solve to our liking...

i went down with my buddy jim and his new special friend mimi to
stay at his aunt/s house in beverly hills (actually harrison ford/s
old house which she bought when she sold her old house to jack
nicholson/s daughter when her ex husband stole all this money to do
the cocaine he started doing by not paying his taxes and then
nicholson/s daughter had a house warming party AND THE GUY who
catered the alcohol had a heart-attack on the front door step, split
his head opened and died - i love LA).... we drove a 86 buick
skylark that had this weird feedback in the stereo system
particullarly well suited for acid house.... which i furnished...

Friday night: learned that the FBI probably shot MLK from bushes
near the hotel and that sheep farmers in new zealand attach rubber
banded spike circles to the testicles of male sheep which pinch so
tight that in three weeks the testicles drop off. i love la. we went
to Blak & Blu/s Unity Groove. sucked. i want LA to get over the 70/s
/ prince/ hip-hop mix..... the other room was hardcore techno.... it
and the crowd/s medium age was 16 with attitude... i think the DJ
put chime on 45 to mix it in for a few moments and then thought
better about it - but then again my copy of chime is 45 so i
dunno.... i hope it wasn/t the record... then we went to more and
they wouldn/t let us in til 3am so my friends lammed and we went to
bed

hey what/s the difference between progressive house and gerh-raj
(gerage - but i/ve only heard british people use the term)?

Saturday: record shopped on Melrose (yeah.....) disapointed at the
R&S compilation and shut-up and dances new single (not shine-eye),
tried to convince someone not to buy the new sandals single and
instead buy the kenny dope cut gunshot that uses the same loop. but
they weren/t having any of that....

Saturday night: went to Candelabra in a very underground space with
tony largo and some guy from detroit who i was psyched to hear. phat
music, but we here in the bay area are spoiled about how good are
Djs are cause the only la dj i]ve heard who/s mixing is strong is
Doc Martin.... the crowd was more clubby than ravey, but we had phun
til someone put gum in jim/s hair, and then we went home and watched
star wars til daybreak....

Sunday: Jim/s senile grandmother scolded me for being evil
incarnate cause we were 20 minutes late to brunch at 11am. in fact,
if it wasn/t for me, we would never have made it, but oh well, once
she gets an idea in heard.....

new labels i like - kaledioscope and ESP/ Go Bang

new name for the house music i like:
runway house (as in gianni versace/s runway)

1. live in la, have an attitude, that/s the law

Yeah, but what is the sub-genre? It was like "white people's house"
as opposed to real house. It wasn't quite "house" music you see....

Or like this prank-phone-caller that keeps on leaving messages on my
answering machine said... 
	"that ain't house music, that's box music, you chump"
(this, in response to my phone message that said "NOT IN THE HOUSE" with

phone trees are a very good idea;  h

Let's do something like this.  If you want to be on the phone tree, send me
your phone number (even if you're my bestest closest friend in the whole wide
world, send me mail with the subject "re: FMR phone tree" so I don't forget
anyone).  Now in order to get on the tree you _must_ be willing to be a branch,
not just a leaf; I'll collect the phone numbers together, and break it down
into a tree.  I'll make sure anyone who's the branches wouldn't have to call
more than 6 people, and I'll try and keep it within your area code.  After I
organize the tree I'll send each person a list of who they have to call from
now on with direction info...  sound good?

The reason for this extra security is this:  I talked to one of the guys (you
know who you are :) who frequent the afterparty Deep Space always throws down
in San Jose every Thursday night after 2am, at the same place where the FMR
got busted two weeks ago.  I asked if the FMR got busted simply because there 
were a lot of people, and the guy said no, the deep space afterparties were
always pretty crowded too.  So this leads me to believe.... that the party was
busted because the cops are intent on busting the FMR's no matter where they
are, not simply because it was "creating a traffic problem" as the SJ cop 
stated.  

I'm going to talk to Allen tomorrow about this, and maybe about setting up
map points and stuff for the next one (if there IS a map point for the next
one, then I WILL post directions to the map point to the list, no problem)

I never did make it to the chill area at Prophecy.  I tried to get
there via the far staircase, but the lights setup there blocked the
normal route through.  And getting to the other staircase required
going across the dancefloor, which meant -- ohmigod, another surge
of energy from the crowd, another elevation to some other zone of
sound & motion, and well I never quite made it to the other staircase.

Same impression of Wally World, although inside actually the security
scene was quite loose.  Just no vibe, although as I mentioned Carlos
was trying mightily in difficult circumstances.

The pool table scene at the Troc is pretty cool.  Who knows what
it's like *every* night (I'm from a place where clubs don't change

Maybe it was the euro-house mix or whatever, when they shoo us into 177
they started playing some pretty good house music but by that time my
fuel gauge was on E and I wasn't so I split.

most of the records that garth has taped up are ancient and completely
impossible to find nowadays anyway.  for instance, two records that he
spins almost all the time are "bring forth the guillotine" by silver
bullet and "do it to the crowd" by twin hype.  those are both
pre-1990.  however, when he played "prayer tower" by paradise
organisation and "tonto's drum" by eagle's prey the other night i
noticed that both of those were NOT taped.  (and they are both current
hits that you can easily get at BPM.)

Subject: rave kitch: where'd that style come from?

In the past, I've learned where the baggy style comes from (thanx voodoo)...
now, in the hopes of wasting more megabytes on meaningless blather, I ask:

There's a certain sense of "rave kitch" -- a retro style that seems to
be made up of certain symbology taken from the youth of
twenty-somehting folk. You know, detergent box logos, texaco logos,
that rave-font used in printing logos, striped hang-10-style shirts,
etc. I say "retro" because that kind of  design came from the late
sixties and early seventies.

There's also the ravette look -- which seems to be less feminized
dressed-down, neo-androgynous version of 20's "flapper style" both in
hair, hat, and angular lines accenting lean, almost-gaunt physiques.

As Spock would say "This is illogical." So, please explain! 

-- Niels.

PS: well, maybe the detergent box logos came from the fact that detergent
boxes look real cool under black light...

that I found at those parties.  Since I was very high on mushrooms, I
couldn't help but feel like I went back in time, back to a Floppy's party.
The music was incredible.  BRAD played, who I actually haven't heard since
I was at the Flop House when PTV played a while back.  Also, Jonah from
SpaceTime played, along with Shobaun, who were both very incredible.
Although the energy was sort of strange (maybe because of the fungi I

was sort of strange, but I was at the same time glad to leave.  ;)

Subject: Yet another weekend update

Well, I started out with get down, get down. It looked promising from the
flyer. Little did I know I was headed for mega-rave hell.

It was in a warehouse at 16th & Harrison (where Wally World was on Sat night).
The space has a lot of potential. There are two dance floors, lots of spaces to
chill, plenty of ventilation and enough staircases and hallways to almost get
lost in.

Spun was on the main dance floor spinning the worst set I've ever heard him do.
He looked more zonked than usual. Usually Spun is my favorite DJ. He has
several styles and I like them all, but this night I don't know what he was
playing.

The back room DJ was spinning hip-hop, not hip-hopish house, but actual hip-hop.
Unfortunately, he had no idea how to segue two songs in a cohesive manner.

I figured I'd wait for the next DJs in the chill spaces. Unfortunately, the
chill spaces were full of high-school types getting stoned and doing N2O.

I bagged on the whole thing after about an hour (it was $20, too).

Then I went to Let the Funk Begin at 1st and Harrison (at a club called 
Atlantis). This was another weird space. Dani was spinning on the main
dance floor playing housey stuff. I danced for a while, but the place was
mostly full of Alky type who cleared out when the bar closed. The party
didn't have enough momentum (or people) to last much longer, so I bagged on
that one too.

Saturday night consisted of going to several raves (prophecy, groove kitchen,
vertigo) standing outside and deciding not to go in.

Sigh, where's Basics when we need it?

which i was glad of, because i had stayed up/was kept up all night Thursday 
as well. john's a really nice person, but the rest (and the best) of the 
San Jose groupie/cool club kids/"we rave, and, yeah, girl, we DO have an 
attitude" people/clique around me were fairly disenheartening. so, i wandered 
and danced and said some hellos and left. all in all, i felt there, but not 
there, but not in a vibe oriented kinda way; more in an "I'm here, but for

I always thought of this as anything but innocent. Rather, I see it as a 
parody of commercialism/consummerism; for instance, Label Whore, or even

 I don't care, because I usually don't bring confiscatible items to any
event. And none of the security folks have ever done any "lingering
hands" stuff to me either. Frisking is only a temporary invasion of my
personal space, and it implies that the space I'm entering is fractionally
safer than a space where frisking isn't performed.

Well, had a cool cool time this weekend.  Was down in Santa Clara for Mike's
big theatre thing; picked up Brian and Leah, who are cool, from the BART 
station and headed over to the theatre only to find it....locked!  Full!  No
room!

Fortunately, I know some people down there, and headed back stage.  Needed
a willpower boost from Brian to try to get in.  Got a friend (who was in the
performance) to sneak us in.  Sat on the floor, caught most of the show, had
a good time.  Felt alot like an underground event since we had to be sneaky....
Awesome show.

We all headed over to Mike's afterwards, and finally headed for SF to do some
good dancing.  Dropped Brian and Leah off at a smaller party, which looked
really neato, and headed over to Groove Kitchen with Mike to rendezvous
with our friends.

I like Garth as well.  His set was good, and he had to cover for the lame
Jan Cooley when she left with the disco playing.  Garth played a few songs
that I had heard before when he came on, and I like those songs alot.  I 
dunno, I just felt like goovin' out, and Garth was up to the task for me.
Markie is a weirdo, and his music is real interesting.  It isn't as high-
powered as the trancy techno of Jeno and others, but his set has a weird 
energy that keeps you going.  He likes songs with a heavy 4/4 bass line and
not much else on top.  Keeps ya moving.

Anyway, dancing is always cool, so I had a good time.  There were, 
unfortunately, alot of attitudes at King street that night.  I guess Groove
Kitchen is getting to be well known.  The week before was less attitude packed,
which of course was the way to go.  Oh well.  Kenny has a good thing there; I
hope it stays cool.

I hope that you all had good times this weekend.  One question:  where are
the big, commercial raves that tend to suck away the people who aren't as 
into raving?  Their existence is good for the smaller venues.  It sounds like
the club-scene raves this weekend could've benefitted from a Sharon or
something......

Take care, all.

------------ BEGIN QUOTED EXCERPT ------------

Stargazers and Astrology freaks take note:  On Tuesday Feb. 2 the planets
Uranus and Neptune will be exactly conjunct in the sky.  This hasn't
happened for 171 years, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  They
join up at 19 degrees 34' Capricorn.  This joining of Uranus and
Neptune is the first of 3 conjunctions which will take place in 1993.
The conjunction represents the merging of revolutionary forces _Uranus_
with a mass urge to transcend 'ordinary' reality _Neptune_.  You may have
noticed some familiar structures and institutions crumbling lately.  Well,
the merging of these two utterly transformative energies occurs in
Capricorn, the sign of old structures and instititutions.  Capricorn
rules such things as banks, churches, corporations, monarchies, countries,
and the authority figures who run these institutions.  Recent images of
Windsor Castle burning to the ground over night, the break up of the
royal family, the bank failures here in the USA, and the dissolution of
Communism in Europe, as well as the merging of Europe into one economic
community are all events reflecting the buildup to this incredible meeting
of plantes:  Uranus (brilliant light flashes, instant inspiration,
electricity, and high technology and science) with Neptune (the dissolution
of all structure, Universal Love and mass yearnings, religion, confusion,
drugs, alcohol, water).

In other words, the time is now, and only now, there's no use trying to
control the uncontrollable anymore, because these forces are completely
beyond your control.  But there's an art to surfing through this wave.
Just learn how to ride with it.  See you on the other side.

Subject: tax Evasions

Bless it, the problems I'm having with my system this evening.
Anyhow, I found an old article in the New York Times on the demise
of Studio 54 that got me thinking.
I was informed that the Caspar/Sharon Halloween thing made somewhere
in the neighboorhood of $75,000, cash no less.  Now are any these
promoters obligated to file a tax return to report these earnings?
And better yet can't a Jeno or a Spun actually file for unemployment?
Virtually all their earnings, certainly the rave end of it, are all
under the table cash.  Here's excerpts from the Times article, which
remarkably sounds too much like the business of current rave promotion:
New York Times, June 29, 1979 by Arnold H. Lubasch
"Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, two owners of Studio 54, were indicted 
in Manhattan yesterday on Federal income charges involving more than
$2.5 million allegedly skimmed from the receipts of their discoteque...
According to the indictment, the defendants "systematically skimmed" as
much as 60 percent of the gross cash receipts from Studio 54 "on a 
virtual daily basis" from the time it opened tow years ago. The 12-count
indictment also named richard DeCourcey, a manager and bookeeper for
Studio 54, as a defendant charged with participating in the alleged
conspiracy and with tax evasion...If convicted, the defendants could
face up to five years on each of several charges in the indictment.
According to the indictment, Studio 54 was almost entirely a cash
business, with patrons paying $7 to $12 to enter and then paying for
liquor, cigarettes and coat checks.  It said receipts averaged
$12,000 a day and sometimes reached $70,000...One charge said that the
defendants filed a corporate tax return that reported only $47,807
in taxable income with a tax of $8,366 for the last fiscal yearr, when
the taxable income should have been $791,000 with a tax of $366,267."
The focus of my post here is on the Toon Town Sharon promoters.  Toon
Town for all intents and purposes, purports itself to be a business, with
a sf office, mail list and so forth.  Now are any of these promoters
obligated to file?  And if they are, are they filing?  With all the
cash, lighting, djs, sound, all paid in cash, I can see how easily it
could be avoided.
and further:  are the owners/managers of say the concourse exhibition
center also liable if the Toon promoters fail to file?
And the humor of it all is that I really think Jeno could file for
bankruptsy,

file income tax returns, individual or corporate, as the case may be.  If
folx are pulling down serious change, they had better be careful how it gets
spent, cause banks report transactions larger than $10k.

Hello All!

 Well, it's been over two weeks since I last exercised my dancing muscles, 
so I'm really looking forward to Atomic Rooster tonight. Of course, the
big added attraction to me is to see how the Deadhead/Raver conjunction
works out ( Uranus & Neptune meet the Age of Aquarius ??? Lollypops with
veggie burritos ??? ). 

 I'll be catching BART from Fremont - it'll probably be one of the easiest
to get to raves I've ever gone to, barring the local South Bay events. 
Anyway, I think I'll be wearing my Disney Goofy t-shirt, and I'll 
definitely be wearing my Deadhead skull & roses bolo tie!

 To make it a really musical week, I'm going to see D'Cuckoo at the Great
American Music Hall this thursday. Hopefully, I'll finally get to see the
notorious MIDI ball in action, and even get in a few wacks! And, if I &
my girlfriend are feeling really energetic, I'll stop by the Future
Forum warehouse with my little dumbek drum.

I've heard a rumor that a couple of the core Toon Town promoters skipped town
with all the money (the New Year's profits, one would assume), leaving their
other partners dry.  So not only are they tax cheats, they're theives, too.

If you recall, the Toon Town people had virtual control of the lease at 177
Townsend/174 King St.  Apparently a couple months ago, they lost control.  I
guess the controlling people now are the people who put on Pleasure Dome on
Sundays (older, alcohol-centric gay male crowd).  They started up a club called
Euphoria on Saturdays at 177 Townsend that's *free*.  They figure they'll make
all the money they need from bar sales.  They're also the ones who put all the
money into the new lights that someone was mentioning, although Toon Town had a
butt load of Intellibeams when it was going strong.  

Speaking of Intellibeams, you should see the lighting setup at the Sound
Factory!  Clearly the product of someone with way too much capital to pour into
a club.  Their mirror balls come close to matching the gaudiness of the
Trocadero's.  Yikes!

Has anyone else heard similar rumors/reports about Toon Town, etc.?

It was.  One of the computers (we think) this gang of crackers hit
was the UC Berkeley OCF machines, which I help run.  We've known about
people trading cracking secrets on IRC and ICB (internet chat programs)
for a long time.  We've even used that to catch a few people.

Lee asks if anyone has been to Euphoria.  Well, I have, and before I give a
review I want to post the disclaimer that I'm a gay disco-queen/raver/whatever,
so don't take the followig to be homophobic.

In one word?  Ick.  The music was a cross between techno-ish house and what
they used to call High NRG.  I'm sure they'll also play house remixes of our
favorite top-40 Pet Shop Boys, Madonna, and Erasure.  The music wasn't as bad
as some places (i.e., Oldies night at the Stud), but certainly not as good as
you'll get at any rave.

The people we're older, mostly 30+ Castro Clones (muscles, mustaches, white
T-shirts with the sleeves rolled up to show off their biceps, leather) with a
sprinkling of younger attitude-ridden men.  No women.  Mostly white, with a
sprinkling of asian men and even fewer black men.

Everyone was drinking alcohol.  It probably gets pretty dead after 2:00 when
the bar closes.  Very little X-vibe.  Very cruisy.  Very much not my scene.

Of course, this was all taken in by me in a quick 10-minute run-through.  It's
almost exactly the same as Pleasure Dome, if you've ever been there.  All in
all, not very ravish.

Cher and enjoy,

i'm looking forward to this one too.  Has there ever before been an event

i can't think of any...  Could mix really well.  i've certainly seen
dead.head types @ raves (and more and more spinners [type-of-dancer] too, 
which are ever-present @ Dead shows).  And it'll damn well revive that human

Hold that thought.  The Future Forum schedule has changed a little.  There's
going to be a Future Forum afterparty for Atomic Rooster (once the parking
lot is closed), at the Charter Oak warehouse.  So we're encouraging a lot of
drummers to come over from the Dead show, and see what happens.  If that
sets a precedence, then Tuesdays will become drumming night.

Sub:    SuperBowl and Violence
 
-------------------------
For political activists, or media watchdogs, or just concerned
individuals, here's a quick something you can do to help prevent
and stop domestic violence.
 
Super Bowl Sunday - which this year is January 31, here in southern
California at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena - is the single worst day
for domestic violence in the USA.  There is an increase of as much as
40% in the volume handled by domestic violence shelters on this
day.
 
To try to stem this tide of violence, the Women's Action Coalition (WAC)
of Los Angeles is supporting the campaign by Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting (FAIR) to convince NBC (the network carrying the game) to carry
two Public Service Announcements on domestic violence during the
Super Bowl this year.  Anna Quindlen of the New York Times wrote a
fine editorial in the 1/17/93 edition of the Times supporting this
effort as well.
 
What I am asking of you - and all your friends (please PLEASE cross-post
this to _any_ lists you can think of) - is to help us with a FAX/LETTER
blitz on NBC, asking for these PSA's.  Here is a sample letter:
 
Dick Ebersol
President, NBC Sports
NBC
30 Rockefeller Plaza
New York, NY  10112
 
Dear Mr. Ebersol:
 
We (I) support FAIR's request that you air two Public Service Announcements
on domestic violence during the Super Bowl game.  The Super Bowl is one of the
most widely viewed television events of the year; it is also the day,
according
to women's shelters, when calls for help increase by as much as 40%.
 
Your broadcast of the Super Bowl will reach a huge audience.  By your airing
PSAs, NBC will be bringing to a national audience the critical and important
issue of domestic violence.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
   You can rephrase or rewrite this letter to your liking, but please FAX or
write them immediately.
 
To reach NBC by FAX:  212-664-5835.
 
   Thanks for helping - you may save someone's life, or skeletal structure, or
eyesight.

I went to a big party in an abandoned train station last year to spin and
play the drum machine for a while. While I was setting up my gear behind the
turntables on the stage, I noticed, leaning in the corner, a CAR-15. Now the
CAR 15 is a smaller version of the M-16 assault rifle (CAR stands for
Carbine Assault Rifle) and, upon further inspection proved to be clean,
loaded and ready. I was, to say the least, a bit upset. 
	"Why," I asked the promoter, "Is there a loaded assault rifle on the
stage?
The promoter was a friend of mine, he'd been putting on underground parties
in Detroit for a couple of years and we'd gotten to know each other fairly
well.
	"In case some shit goes down," he replied coldly. 
	"What shit?" I asked him. "This is a rave, nobody that shows up at
these things wants to do anything but have a good time. And besides, don't
your guys frisk everybody?
	"No," he said. "That turns people off."
	"And a firefight just moves to the groove, huh?"
	"Don't worry" he said. "It's just backup in case we get crashed by
the Counts or something."
	"This sucks, and I want you to hear me say that it sucks, and I want
you to believe that it sucks, so maybe you'll put that thing back in your
car or wherever you got it from and just let everything go OK. Are you high
right now?"
	"No," he said, his eyes darting back and forth. Oh shit.
	"Fine," I said, "just leave it there where nobody can fuck with it
and cover it up with something."
	"OK, that's cool," he said. "Just don't tell the other DJ's about
it."
Yeah, right. the promoter brings a machine gun to insure peace and love.
They'd flip. He went to the other side of the building and disappeared, then
I took the clip out (I'm an army brat I learned this shit when I was very
young) and removed all the shells, then put the clip back in. Peace and good
vibes for all.

Not one word of this is true, but it could really happen, and to a lesser
degree, it has happened. I think frisking is an ok idea. Especially in a
big  underground situation.

Subject: The Atomic Rooster From Planet 6 !


Well, I got to the north Oakland Colesium parking lot by 6:50 PM - went 
looking for the Atomic Rooster ; keeping my ears open for techno/house.

 Found the sound coming from a table behind a van - a drum machine and 
effects and a little keyboard, and I think a turntable. A corregated
cardboard sign said "Planet 6". The sound quality was bad - too little 
watts for the speakers and the parking lot = distortion. 

 Met Lee Fogel and his friend ( whose name I'll remember some day !!! ).
We weren't convinced that Planet 6 = Atomic Rooster, so we went in search
of Atomic Rooster elsewhere in the lot, without success. After eating
some seaweed burritos , we headed back to Planet 6. In the time we were 
gone, the sound had improved, and the crowd had increased to about 75
people. One of the SFRavers ( Mike or Pete ) confirmed that indeed, the
Atomic Rooster was going to be there!

 Eventually, the equipment arrived, and the stuff got set up while the
Planet 6 folks played records without mixing - dead air between tracks.
( If anybody knows these guys, tell'em to turn down the treble, and 
clean their records. ). Even with the lack of Dj'ing, there were enough
folks committed to getting the vibe going! By the time I left, the
crowd size had increased to about 150 - 200 people.


 Unfortunetely, I have to be at work Wed. morning by 7:30AM, so I couldn't
stay long enough to hear very much of the "real" DJs. Of the SFRavers
I saw , there was Lee Fogel & his friends, Jocelyn, The Normals (tm), 
Brian B., Geoff, Pete, Mike, and a bunch of others. So, there should
be more than enough folks to report on how the rest of the night
went, especially the Charter Oak drumming!

PS- On my way out of the parking lot , I passed by a drum circle that had 
a bunch of ravers hanging out and bopping away! One of the deadheads was
trying on the gigantic foam cowboy hat that one of the ravers had brought.
Cool!

Way cool!  Wish I'd been able to check it out.  The Dead show didn't
end until well after midnight, and I didn't connect with my ride into
the City, so I took the last BART and just arrived.  If it weren't
for the fact Charter Oak is so far away, I'd probably be there now
checking it out.  But I hope those who did are having a great time.

Subject: Song ID Heeeeeellllppppp..

I am trying to find out what these two damn songs are on my La Paix II mix..
One starts off with: (imagine voice of if Sammy David, JR.was a house preacher)
(real syncopated uptempo beat)
Ya put tha beat beat beat in your bo-bo-bones 
Ya put tha beat beat beat in your bones    (these 2 lines for about 16 meas.)
Its getting kinda groovy in here              with (huh.. c'mon in back)
Its that time again (8x)
This groove not only moves, but it can remove
Spititual house music moving your mind
as well as your body
(insert wailing diva)
Now here come the drums
(insert drums, wailing diva)
Drum music with an attitude
heritage and hope
a past a present 
and a futuuuure!
Music for your father
Music for the mutha
a little something for your sista
a little breakbeat for your brutha

The second one starts off with these choppy piano house chords (you know the
ones), and an obscured male wailing vocal so that you can't really tell what he
is saying (if he is actually saying anything) anyway, it sounds like:
dance to the rhythm of e to make you craazy (wails off into next word)
hold me now to make you lately (wails off into distance)
gratuitous breakbeats, acid synths, and piano anthem chords are all over
this cut.. 

can YOU help me?
make you move.

Subject: DiY in SF

Tomorrow night (Thursday, Jan 28th) DJ's Digs and Woosh from Nottingham's
DiY Sound System are appearing at DNA, along with Scott and Robbie Hardkiss,
Jon Williams, and a live performance by SF's own TastiBox.

DiY was recently written up in DJ magazine -- they've made a name for
themselves throwing free parties throughout England and are known for
excellent lighting and music.

I notice that this event wasn't listed in last week's RAVE guide -- it hasn't
been very heavily flyerred, so it's bound to be a "with-the-program" crowd.
If you have a chance come out for this.

All this for only $6!

a thumbs up to the Thursday night event - if I _had_ to go out (hee

interesting, and I've never seen Idiot Flesh :)  But whateva.

Subject: re:frisky

The story isn't true, but it's based on a true event. Guns have no place at
raves. The story was to make a point. If they frisk you, they obviously care
enough to insure your safety. And as far as endangering someone's life (you
from stanford) goes, (by removing the ammo) I'd rather trust the door people
than a cracked-out promoter with an assault rifle. I don't know. You tell
me. Detroit is funny that way. It goes with the territory. if they frisk
you, they want you to have a good time without getting swiss-cheesed.
	Moral: Dont get offended if they frisk you. sometimes it's obvious
if they're expecting trouble, but more often than not, it's just a
precaution. Liability sucks. I'd feel like shit if someone got shot up at my
party, so I'd make sure nobody was carrying.

Subject: Farewell for the nonce

Some of you, probably including assorted lowlifes at the FBI, CIA and  other
such nefarious organizations, know that I am temporarily unsubscribing to
sfraves and dcraves due to my imminent move to Washington.  I have accepted
a position at the Executive Mansion (if you want to know more, just ask, and
I will tell you, but I don't want to bore the entire mail list with the
details.)
N.B., I am not unsubscribing because of paranoia, but because I won't have
an address for a couple of weeks.  Once I get the puter up and running
again, I'll sign on, and leave my usual set of inane messages.
It sounds like it will be a slow weekend coming up, so probably I won't get
a chance to say goodbye in person (unless someone can come up with a good
party to attend!!!  Please!!!)  But I want all of you to know how much you
have meant and mean to me.  This fortysomething geezer has learned that the
ability to grow and change is not limited by chronology, but only by the
narrowness of your mind. For those of you who despair about falling into the
traps of your elders, know that your possibilities are only limited by the
ever-expanding horizons of the universe.  Even if they frisk you, and take
away your love phasers (or try to), we WILL eventually succeed.  Once we
have experienced the vibe, there's no going back.

I won't be here to party with you in person, but I'll send those good luv
vibes to all from DC.  As susie always ends her messages...partyon, rave on.

Jeez, I think this is getting garbled from line noise or my friends checking
me out.  Anyway, love each other, and care for each other, cuz we are all we
have.  I love you all.  Peace and joy to everyone.

well, jocelyn.  i feel very sorry for the vibes that got thrown in 
your direction by san hose-ay ravers.  i probably could have told
the list that gd^2 probably /would/ be that way.  unfortunately, a
couple of the promoters have turned from being my friends into 
"hey mark, yeah i haven't seen you in 2 months...here, have a flier.
come to my party...."   yea right.  what happened to good to see you
buddy?

i have never been to a come/unity or alternity, but i really really
long for one!  the way everybody talks about the good vibes very much
turns me on.  but, believe me.  there are /some/ nice people in s.j.
don't give up on all of us just yet!  :)


pete gracious:  you have a show on kscu, and i didn't know about it
until yesterday, when you  didn't show up and someone else had to 
take your place.  (do us listeners a favor next time, and show up. 
this guy was awful :)  


went to toons last nite, and heard harry who? spin for the first time
that i actually knew it was him.  i liked it VERY much.  nice hippy,
kinda trancy, very dancy set.  hung out with spun for a while, who
apologized for not coming to my house party.  (i know, how long am i
going to milk that one?? :)  left early, and missed his set, though
he is my fave rave dj.  :(

i'll be at deeeep space tonite, if any else is going.


so, brian,  when is the next alternity / come/unity.  i, too, would 
like to spread / take in some good vibes.

-mark, in a strangely somber mood.

Some more flyers from last night's housing project.  I saw a new
flyer for the Prodigy/Moby show - it's 'only' $15 in advance, and
it'll be at the Fashion Center.  The flyer didn't fit in my back
pocket, so it didn't make its way home with me.  I also saw a flyer
for "Love Factory" w/Aaron and Jan Cooley, at the Sound Factory;
looks like Love Garage may be moving...

Subject: hey all

I called the Basics line (415-905-9629) and Martin is on there saying that if
you have any suggestions for stuff, you can mail them your ideas.  I think
that this is really really cool.  So, what you all should do is call the 
number and get the address and send them your ideas, etc...  Martin is a 
good guy, and his raves are good, and he likes feedback on his events.  It
is really cool when the promoter wants contact with his partygoers.  It is 
contact like this that will keep the scene really strong and unified, with
a guarantee of parties that everyone wants.

Subject: Re:  This week's RAVE guide

It may be too late to save anyone the bother, but I must try.  Now I'm all
for giving different music a chance, but don't bother with idiot flesh unless
you are:
		a) on too much acid and want to feel like you NEED to crawl
		out of your own skin, or
		b) enjoy the sensation of being repeatedly hit uponst the
		noggin with (alternatingly) a salami, a brick, a 2x4 with
		a bunch of 10 penny nails sticking out of it.

Not a pretty picture.  Musically talentless, creatively flaccid and uninspiring,
and just plain not worth the bother,  Go do something ELSE, for your own good.

Disagree?  Tell me.

Yeah, I guess so.  I was editing down the guide for printing and in the
process got myself all confused and excited.  The info I misread must 
of been for 150 Folsom, which I understand isn't happening either.

Subject: I CAN BREATHE! (Thanks for mail handling replies)

Thanks for the responses to mail sorting you all, I thought I'd never
again see my personal mail inside the murky black soup of sfraves
traffic.

Several suggestions centered on elm and mh-rmail, neither of which
I could get access to / knowledge of.

The one that finally worked is a c utility which reads mail off the
unix spool, and places it into local mailboxes, split by the occurence
of a search string (you guessed it, the infamous string "sfraves").
I then use rmail under emacs, which allows one to specify a separate
local mailbox for each mail folder; going to some folder causes new
mail to be retrieved from the specified box.  Easy?  Yeeeeah.

If  anyone wants a copy, I'll check with the sender and copy it along.

I arrived just as the band was finishing up (following a fine D'Cuckoo
performance at the Great American Music Hall).  Had to leave around
3 because work beckons with ball and chain Friday morning.  The tunes
were real good all evening, but the crowd was fairly sparse.
That must have been Robbie Hardkiss from around 2 to 3, but I'm not
good at remembering who's who.  Can't beat the price, though, despite
the 11th Street Klub Seen situation I definitely got more than my $5
worth . . .

Considering Tiptoe tomorrow night (I know, I know, but Buck's dad
is my friend Randy Tinkerman, so I need to check this out!)

A friend of mine said there was a really big explosion at the
Atomic Rooster stealth rave in the Oakland Col lot the other night,
like a power supply or something blew up.  Anyone know anything
about this?  Must have been somewhere between 12:30 and 1 am.

Saturday, February 6 -- Good Times
    A Future Funk Dance Party brought to you by the DEA (Dance
    Enforcement Agency), 10 pm til noon (aha! fh), 
    Dani, Neon Leon, Shon, Thomas, Markie, Spun
    plus upstairs DJ free-for-all -- come early to sign up
    if you want to spin (!! fh)
    520 4th St @ Bryant 
     The flyer is kinda simple-- just black print on a kind of pink paper, not too
    fancy -- based on my experiences at  the Troc this could be good

Saturday, February 13 -- Anjuna Dawn, Funky Techno Tribe
    415.266.8215  Josh, La Paix, Australia's Phil Smart, Spun, DJ Dan
    This is a very nice flyer, a small fold-out card really, with
    what looks to be a scene from the outback.  Not overdone, but
    high quality.

And a new weekly (?) . . .

Saturdays -- Smiling Thru  -- 278 11th @ Folsom
    A New Sound for a New Year -- Scott Hardkiss, Jon Williams,
    Robbie Hardkiss, Saturday mornings beginning February 13, 4 am
    special guest Chicago's deepest Mark Farina, 415-979-LUV-0

    dedicated to those who know and those who are willing to learn.

Hmm... I left around that time and there were a few firecrackers 
going off, maybe that was it... 

Larry said most of the important things about it so I won't rehash 
TOO much, but needless to say it was fun, despite there being a lot
more nitrous than I had ever seen at a rave before (I was told that
deadheads were actually into it first... hmmm) and much more beer.
But I think the goal of introducing the two camps to each other was
at least partially successful; the majority of the dancing crowd was
ravers but I saw many deadheads walk up, look at us like we were all
crazy, then 5-10 minutes later he/she would start bobbing their head,
shuffling their feet and eventually bounce up and down with the rest
of us.  Conversely, I saw ravers walking down "Shakedown Street"
(a section of the parking lot where there were vendors selling everything
from psychedelic T-shirts to pipes to egg rolls).  I was a little jaded
on that aspect because I see that everyday on Telegraph here in Berkeley,
but it was a new experience for a few of the ravers.  

	There were no "incidents" of anyone getting annoyed at us 
(despite the one time the police car pushed everyone aside as it drove 
though the lot - first time I've ever seen a police car drive across
a dance floor and the party continue :) and when the concert let out,
the party grew in size from maybe 150-200 to maybe 300 or so.  It was
then that I had to leave to make a quick trip home before going to set
up at the future forum afterparty, but supposedly it went until 2am.

	The future forum party was going when we got there with maybe 50
people; we set up some lights and around 2:30 or 3 Malachy arrived with 
the sound system and downstairs Bones started spinning.  There were
maybe 120 people there total, and most were still there when I left around 
5:30.  Unfortunately the tribal drummers never showed...

WOOOO!  9 track tapes huh!  They hold almost a whopping 75 megs of data!

This whole article sounds like a lot of paranoia.  The amount of modem
transmissions that happen over the US _daily_ is in the high gigabytes.
They'd have to assembly a ridiculously huge team not only to sort through all
the garbage, but change them banks o' 9 tracks as well.  The bit about modem
use affecting your credit rating sent my bologna meter through the roof.  What
about Mr. Professor modeming in to work?  What about Jack Stockmarket checking
the Dow Jones.  These are people who it wouldn't be wise to drop their credit
rating due to "modem use".

Hey bub!  Wanna buy a modem?  It will send your baud rate through the roof!

I should have left when you did...I have a terrible cold (anyone who
was there last night and doesn't know me, I was the one bundled up
like an eskimo w/ a wool stocking cap and a long overcoat) and right
now my body is saying to my brain "this is a helluva way to run a
railroad", or some other mixed metaphor.  I left at about two and
hadn't heard UVC by then...Robbie and Jon W. played a cool tag-team DJ
set for a while, though.  

All in all, a fun thursday and so far a pretty damn weak Friday.  Nice
seeing everyone at DNA, esp. Giamma and Pat, I don't see you south bay
types much.

True, Yup.... 

   The Feds watch and monitor a very large amount of traffic over phone
lines, usually it is just a quick ASCII scan of codewords and the like
but never-the-less, the information is sometimes captured...

   And if you don't like that, encrypt your stuff, not that it is
going to stop them from reading it (if there is a will and a huge
amount of $$$$ (your tax dollars) then there is a way).  At least
up the ante and make it hard for 'em.  

  BTW, it is illegal to make an encryption that can't be broken by
the government.  This is the current trend of computing in the 21st
century.

dna - went with jim..... shouts out to michael, howard, and gunther,
and anyone i missed..... i missed your glow in the neon ear-plugs
gunther.

so i had wanted to goe deep space to hear garth cause i ran into the
spliff skaninkin part of rankin and skanin, (or maybe i ran into
rankin - i never know) and he told me he heard harry who at toons
the other night and harry was the shit..... thanks, i've been into
harry almost as long as he/s been on the scene - that/s why i keep
booking him. ohhh welll

but we left the keys to our stanford car in la so we were at the
mercy of our friends. they took us up to sf toot suite and lit up in
the car and coughed and coughed and coughed and jim and i couldn/t
stop laughing cause we thought we were in either a cheech and chong
film of a jim hughes breakfast buddies film - they were playing the
vision tapes - very phat, and we are very grateful that we had
something do :)

i thought the sound at DNA was better than deep space, but
ultimately i like the crowd at deep space a little better (could
someone explain the new hell's angels trend of wearing drumsticks in
their pockets?)

but i came to a startling realization about my life as a DJ after
carefully observing DJs for a long time i realize i am missing two
vital characteristics to make me god like. so here/s my checklist:
two 1200's (i have those) all the other equipment to get noise out
of the 1200's (i have that) a strong vinyl collection and limited
expendible capital to get new vinyl (have that) time to practice
(have that) baseball hat or long hair (have the hat, used to have
the long hair) now here's wher i fall apart - very attractiove
current love interest (that's a no show) the ability and desire to
smoke 3 or 4 lighters worth of death sticks in the course of a 2
hour set (another out of league gesture) - am i missing anything
else?

i thought jon williams had this like 20 minute cycle, where he'd
play really well for 20 minuites and then weak mix a whiplash groove
and we/d have to start building the vibe from scratchg again - and
while i liked the trasding twos going on, i thought it didn/t work
well enough to build the corwd up to a point where we could get into
the change of tone, style, that quickly....

but - just for the taste of - i have had a great time. cause i
manage stuff i have an unfortunate ability to over criticize, but
that doesn/t mean i didn/t dance what/s left of my ass of and
generally have a bigh old time......

Well, in San Jose, Deep Space continues to be happenin' thing on Thursday nights
(actually, far as I can tell, it's the ONLY happenin' thing going on in San 
Jose). 

In the main room Julius Papp started off. He finished his set up with some
heavy funk beats that I really got off on. Spun was on after that and 
completely underwhelmed me. He used to be my favorite DJ, but the last two
times I've head him he just wasn't there.

In the back room Rick Preston played a pretty good set that started with some
amazing Acid Jazz. Unfortunately it didn't last long, but the rest of his set
was not bad either.

The February Dj lineups for Deep Space look good, esp. Mark Farina on the 11th.
Check it out.

show where people send in basicly what ever they want and it gets aired.  She's an old

spent last night at deep space (@ Oasis in S.J.) 11:30-2... it was fun.
not too crowded. cool crowd. probably not a rave to write home about, but
definitely a nice way to dance away some weeknight hours w/ good music. It
was good enuf that I was able to dance & ignore an upset stomach caused by
eating a very bad chinese dinner in palo alto.

spun and garth in the front room keeping the crowd happy with the funky
hard-beats.  dj bose in the back -- i was pleasantly surprised by the

Subject: OK, here's the mail handling solution that worked.

So it's not the best, or the cleanest.  Allz I can say is it seems to
work, so far.  (See, I think it's perfectly adequate, and hasn't failed
me yet, just don't hang me if your mail gets lost.)
(Note that this guy's program causes an info message which calls sfraves
mail "junk" mail.  Hmmm.  Maybe he's a lurker....

Thanks a billion to mw@sybase.com who was kind enough to pass along
the split program.  It splits your incoming mail into two mailbox
files, one for "junk" mail which has any string in the header matching
a string in the me2rc file, and one for all other mail.

Here are the caveats; check to see if your system works in a similar
way, and change pathnames and filenames for your system.
a) it's being used on a unix system, with 'rmail' under emacs.
b) The mail script gets my new mail at '/usr/spool/mail/USERNAME'.
c) The split program throws out the Received:, Message-Id:, and
   Errors-To: lines of all messages.
d) You may want to modify the mail split program to return error
   conditions, and test for these in the csh script.
e) Another change which would allow splitting into any number of
   different mailboxes (if you're on many mailing lists, etc.) would
   be to use a single string read from the command line instead of the
   file ~/.me2rc , then iterating the split with different strings.

Here's the emacs process:
1) Create new folder (I use SFRAVES) with 'M-x rmail-output'
2) Move to that folder: 'M-x rmail-input'
3) Set the mailbox filename that this folder will check for new mail
   from now on: 'M-x set-rmail-inbox-list' (I use mbox_sfraves).
   This is now reflected in the header for that folder:

%head SFRAVES
BABYL OPTIONS:
Version: 5
Labels:
Note:   This is the header of an rmail file.
Note:   If you are seeing it in rmail,
Note:    it means the file has no messages in it.
Mail: mbox_sfraves                                 <-----HERE

4) rmail's default (on this system) is to always check both
   /usr/spool/mail/username and ~/mbox for new mail, so ~/mbox can
   conveniently be used for the personal mail argument in the
   split prog.  To read personal mail, nothing unusual needs be done.
5) to read sfraves mail, move to the sfraves folder with
   'M-x rmail-input' 'SFRAVES', and new mail is picked up for reading.

Here's the csh script that splits and starts the mail reading.  Use this
instead of emacs, every time.  Change 'USERNAME' to your username,
e.g. 'jones'.
#!/bin/csh
#
#spmail: split mail into personal and sfraves mail
#

if (-e /usr/spool/mail/USERNAME) then
#  there is new mail; use mail split program
   if (-e mbox_temp) rm mbox_temp
#  move spool mail file to local; copying/deleting may cause
#           loss of data if new mail arrives before deletion
   mv /usr/spool/mail/USERNAME ~/mbox_temp
#  split mail from local file into personal and sfraves mailboxes
   ~/bin/mbox_extract ~/mbox_temp ~/mbox ~/mbox_sfraves
   emacs -f rmail

else
#  no new mail present, don't attempt a filter
   emacs -f rmail

endif

Here's the mail split program.
My ~/.me2rc file, which contains the strings to search for in
the mail headers, contains one line:
sfraves
Then, compile and enjoy!

/*
mbox_extract

By S. Alan Ezust   depeche@cs.mcgill.ca

This program is public domain, and may be distributed freely. No guarantees
come with this program, and if any data is lost as a result of its use, I can
not be held responsible. However, I have been using it for about 8 months and
have never lost any data as a result of its use, and to my knowledge, there
are NO bugs in this program.

If you make changes to this program, please write in the sourcecode comments
explaining what they are, and if you distribute a modified version, I'd
appreciate you sending it along to me as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the program works:

mbox_extract {infile outfile1 outfile2}

This program takes as input three filenames. The first is read in as a
unix-format mbox file, and opens the two other files for output. If these
files already exist, they will be opened for APPENDING.

When the program is finished, infile will remain UNCHANGED.

mbox_extract also uses an auxiliary file, ~/.me2rc. This file must be a
standard text file in which each line contains a 'search string'.

The program works as follows: It searches the headers of each piece of mail
for occurrences of one of the search strings. If a mailbox piece header
contains one of these search strings, that entire piece of mail is appended
to <filename2>. If no line in the header contains one of these strings,
the piece of mail is appended to <filename1>.

How to use it:

I have the following lines in my .login file:
---------------
set mail=/usr/spool/mail/$user
set real=~/stuff/realmail
set junk=~/stuff/junkmail

if (-e $mail) then
    me2 $mail $real $junk
    set mt=`file $real`
    if ($mt[2] == empty) then
        rm $real $mail
    else
        mv $real $mail
        from
    endif
else
    echo You have no new mail.
endif
---------------

My system mailbox is /usr/spool/mail/depeche, and I wish to take
all bulk-mailed pieces of mail and place them into mbox_l. My
~/.me2rc file looks like this:

---------------
| cure@euclid.enet.dec.com
| nm-list-sender
| other-voices@
---------------

This way, any piece of mail with the above three strings in the header
gets appended to mbox_l, and any other piece of mail gets written to
/usr/spool/mail/depeche, which is my system mailbox. .temp will have the
old contents of my spool file, which I can look at in case I am wondering
how the original file looked before the extraction was done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Caution:

In general, the "system mailbox" can be changed by the system at any instant
in time. Pieces of mail get placed into them at unpredictable times. I was
told by some unix-gurus that to move and create new system mailbox files
CAN be dangerous if, by a coincidence, a new piece of mail arrives while
this program is running. If this happens, two processes are appending to it
at the same time, and data can be corrupted.

The running time of this program on a spool file is never much more than a
second on this sun/4. I am willing to take the risk of such an event
happening on MY spool file, but it has NEVER happened in the 8 months I
have used it. I just wanted you to realize that there is that miniscule
chance each time you run it in the way I have suggested, so that if
something weird happens to your spool file, this is probably the reason.

If you know how to insure that any other process requesting access to this
file gets suspended until mbox_extract completes its execution, I would
love to hear from you!!! This could make it a "safe" program.

well, i ended up staying at deep space until about 12:30 || 1:00.  i got 
there a little after ten, and it was pretty sparce.  maybe 50 people, with
spun spinning in the big area, and bones (sp?) spinning in the back by the
pool.  i didn't recognize spun's set as him, so i went to the back area to
hang out.  (i had a [(*"date"*)] :/ )  i really like bones' set.  i don't
know exactly how to describe it, but it kept a good ~126 bpm going with a
kinda groovin' just slightly trancy feel.  maybe someone else (john or
jocelyn) can elaborate.  hung out there and when my date went to the rest.
room i saw john grigsby.  had a cigarette with him, then my date (enough 
of that, her name's lisa) came back and we hung out some more.  garth came
on quickly and seamlessly after spun.  

talked to spun for a while, and apparently he's leaving for the weekend 
tomorrow for a rave(s) in seattle.  (make that today!:)   danced a little
bit, but lisa wanted to hang out.  she said she'd really like to go to a
cool rave where people are nice and try the whole rAvE experience.  i told
her about sfraves and alternity/etc. and she said she'd love to do that 
whole thang.  so who's in charge of making alternities happen?  bb...nudge
nudge:).  

then saw jocelyn on my way out.  (hi jocelyn :)  the crowd was then beginning

For anyone out there looking for TAZ by Hakim Bey, I just found a
copy at the Booksmith, 1644 Haight St.  They still have three or four
more in stock.

Some reviews from the back cover:

"Like sending away for Kix boxtops and getting back real bazookas."
        (N.Y. Native)

"A Blake angel on bad acid."
        (Robert Anton Wilson)

"Scares the shit out of us."
        (Church of the SubGenius)

That should give you some points of reference.

Does anyone know the details of his upcoming Bay Area appearance?

Subject: Sin?  yeah right.

damn, is it just me or has traffic been really low since the nitrous
thread blew over...only 2 messages in the last 20 hours...

anyway, I went to Sin last night after not having been to a major
production since Gathering.  AAaaaaah.  Look, I just went because some
friends of mine here at Loth Central who don't rave much were going
and I wanted to see how they raved, maybe show 'em the ropes.  But the
pickings were not ripe Saturday to say the least.  Pull my finger
coulda been cool but i couldn't talk them into hauling down to santa
clara, and i sure as HELL wasn't going to Ultra Purex, so by process
of elimination...

we got there to find two wonderful things to start out the night: $20.
No bottles.  (Water was $4 a bottle inside.  Orange Juice was $3 and a
single orange was $1.)  As we waited in line "ravers" yelled out the
upstairs windows "Hey!  nice tits!"  Once inside we found two main
rooms, which didn't seem to have themes per se, just different DJ's.
It was kinda cool how these two rooms right next to each other were
totally soundproofed from each other, but at the much more annoying
price of there not really being a good pathway between them.  It was
extremely crowded, one strike against it.  There was also a DJ playing
the entry way where they were selling T-shirts and smart drinks, which
could be kind of a cool idea except the DJ actuallty sounded pretty
good and there wasn't anyplace within earshot of him to dance or even
stand around and listen with out being in the way.  There was a small
chill place playing reggae-ish stuff which for some reason NO ONE was
in despite it being so crowded everywhere else.  In the main dance
space there were two cages with dancers (oh yay) (well at least they
weren't both women which is a nice theory but inpractice no one was
paying attention to the man and everyone was ogling and wolfwhistling
at the woman) and all this really self-promotional bullshit that
really turned me off: both black light paintings said SIN in big
letters with accompanying "sinful" graphics that didn't do much for
me, sorry, and the intellibeam kept spelling out SIN, and even more
stupidly, spelling out the phone # for a rave the next weekend, like I
wanted to me marketed toward while I was dancing.  All in all, I
wasn't having a particularly good time, i was too tired, and i ended
up leaving after a coupla hours.  I swear I will never just go to some
randome event jus cuz "gee I feel like raving tonite".  bleeeh.

BUT, FINALLY i will get to go to a Come/Unity on tuesday!  yay!  let's
get to some real raving, shall we?

Subject: Box Music


Traffic low?  Hm, must be the Super-bowl. (Traffic is always
low on weekends.  People are out doing stuff.)

Thursday night, some freinds of mine invited me out to The
Box, a hip-hop party over at the Kennel Club.  $4 with the
$1 off coupons I picked up at the Brain Wash.  

If you show up at 9PM, you get the benefit of an hour long
lesson in hip-hop dancing, much like an aerobics class.
Fairly amusing, and mildly instructive, since I've always had 
a mental block on dancing to hip-hop (it's beginning to sink
in though: the reason the beat is so slow is to give you
time to make big, elaborate moves between beats).  I didn't
appreciate the extensive "voguing" routine at the end of the
lesson though.  

So, the place is packed by 10:30 or 11, and it's not such a
bad crowd.  The hip-hop that "Mixtress page hodel" was
spinning sounded like hip-hop lite to me.  No black urban
angst, no stupid sexual jokes, no advice for the clueless
("Don't Drink and Drive"), just lines like "Dance to the
music!".  Something in between disco and techno.  

Around 11:30 they started playing some techno, though it was
often very poppy stuff, or hip-hop cross-over stuff like
Bizarre Inc  ("Strictly for the hardcore! Only for the
Headstrong!").  

Visuals were pretty impressive (John Abrahms of Headlights)
... I particularly liked the real-time video of the dancers
that they mixed with backgrounds that interacted with the
motion of the dancers.

thought you guys might want to hear what a dcraver had to say about jeno
and his trip to boston...(and what i missed out on...)oh well back to
paper hell...wheee...partyon...susie (: (only 5 more weeks until spring
break)
----------------------------Original message----------------------------
okay, here's a story about the Wonderland rave,

     On Saturday morning took the bus up from Washington D.C. up to
Hartford, CT to meet up with my brother, and to get to Wonderland.
Drove up from Hartford, CT to Woburn with a couple of friends, one
who is throwing the MASSIVE DOSE rave in the Htfd area Feb. 20.
  DAMN!! you have to check out the flyers they are going to distribute
for it, dope is an UNDERstatement!
anyways...
   Got to Wonderland around midnight. Before that stopped at Purity
grocery store to buy some treats.

The place was very nice. Police outside to check out the guests.
go through a door and into a wonderland.
   The first thing that struck me was how clean and clear and crisp the
sound was, nothing like the sound at the last rave id been to.
Another thing that suprised me was to see so many people dancing when I
came in. The last few raves in dc been to the people were standing around
alot until twoish.
  Debo was on the t'tables, and was spinning i guess some freshly
performed trance. It got me grooving near the tables right from the start.

So I was feeling good and everything, when all the sudden JENO comes on.
There is only one way to describe the man: he is god. Jeno played some
set that i had never heard before. It was incredible. At one point,
i don't remeber exactly when, he was spinning and i was grooving along
blow pop in mouth, i felt this intense rush that caused me to crack the
stupidest and biggest grin and for a few minutes the music and i were one.
It is difficult to describe really, but it was great.

  Soon after Digital Druid bumped into me. It was great to see him.
He showed me where all the other ne-ravers were, met Donato, Shalako,
Cimac, Mike, and the drive-up DC crew of Inhuman, Ben Jaffee and Jed.
Also met good old friend Polida to chat with a good time. Damn Shalako
and Donato were getting off dancing on the floor!

  Jason Jinx and Dante played some nice sets but i began to wear down and after
 trying to keep the energy level upwith pixxie sticks and smart drinks
finally colapsed for around a 5:30 to be woken up arond a half-hourlater
by some guy tripping over me. But I was feeling refreshed and just starting
to get into a groove with Onionz when the music was abruptly stopped and
the lights turned on right at 7:00 am. And there were still at least 2-300
people still dancing. Oh well...

  Got outside and it was snowing like crazee. The ride back to CT was fun.

  Wonderland was definately worth the trip. The Mass people were really into
it and there was a phunky-good vibe the whole night. It was great.

Well I wish could go to raves all over the country like this trip but
now i am broke, soo... guess not. But gonna be back up in chilly New England
for a Massive Dose.

keep the vibe alive,

stevie moans:
> I swear I will never just go to some
>randome event jus cuz "gee I feel like raving tonite".  bleeeh.

Same lesson relearned (once again).  I decided on Purex  over Sin
because at least it wasn't promoting that adolescent sexual fantasy
vibe.  Anyway, I had never been to Ceasar's Salsa house and I was 
curious about the space.  

Got there at 3:00, no line.  Fat security guy gives me the frisk of
of my life.  Maybe it was my leather jacket, or my slightly advanced
age, or because he saw me get off a motorcycle and decided I was tool
cool for my own good, I don't know.  So after 10 minutes of patting me
and touching me all over, he squeezes the front pockets of my jeans and 
asks me to empty one of them, like he suspected a miniature bomb or
something.  I show him the little matchbox and explain to him that 
they are matches.  I could sense that his tiny brain was debating
whether he should make me open it or not.  Finally, he just grunts
like a pig and lets me through.  Now feeling like a criminal, I allow
myself to be robbed of $20.  At this point I'm in it from an 
anthropological field trip perspective.

The space is kind of interesting.  Basically a big room with lots of
chill spaces and vendors around the perimeter and above.  The vibe wasn't 
too bad, but not very focused or together.  The sound setup was strange; 
just a big wall of speakers off to one side.  No stereo, no real sound
space or sweet spots and the overall quality was mediocre at best.  I don't
know who was spinning, but it was Ultra-uninspiring.  

30 minutes later I was at Groove Kitchen where I saw friends and felt
good, although the music was too Wailing Diva (tm) for me.  Don't 
remember much detail of the next few hours except that the AfterLife
totally sucked. I'm afraid that that little scene, as marginal as 
it was, is dying.  Some lame DJ tossing stale disco on the tables while
guzzling beers.  There were some very solemn raver regulars there who
will probably never come back.

>BUT, FINALLY i will get to go to a Come/Unity on tuesday!  yay!  let's
>get to some real raving, shall we?

Look for me there.  I'll be the one dancing and smiling. ;-D

Subject: mail handling stuff


Well, if you were using RMAIL and incorporated that message from
nineball into your mail RMAIL file, you've probably got problems.

My RMAIL got hopelessly confused because of a header contained within
that message.

To fix:

1) get into your RMAIL
2) do Ctl-U 1 Ctl-J to go to the first mail message
3) hit o (output to other rmail file) then return (default to XMAIL)
then n (next message)
4) repeat 3 for every message you want to save NOT INCLUDING the
message from nineball or any messages after this one.  Before you
output the message right before the one from nineball, check it out --
sometimes part of nineball's message gets grafted onto the end, if so,
edit it -- hit w (to edit) ctl-space at the start then ctl-w at the
end of the message to cut it out, then ctl-c ctl-c to exit edit mode
-- or just delete the message entirely, even better, or just not move
it to the XMAIL file (the best).
5) do a i XMAIL to switch over to the new XMAIL file.  Make sure
everything is cool by looking at the contents here.  Basically you've
just made a new file with the same contents as your old RMAIL, but
without the offending messages.
6) now ctl-x ctl-f and get ~/.newmail  edit it, removing the message
from nineball.  Stash the message from nineball into a file so you can
refer to it later.  This is a buffer file for RMAIL -- when it got
confused, it just stashed the new mail here so you wouldn't lose
anything no matter what happened.  If you don't fix this file, when
you try to run RMAIL, it'll load this first, putting the nineball
message back in and confusing everything again.  Save the contents of
.newmail by doing a ctl-x ctl-w.
7) do meta-x shell to get a shell running, and rm your ~/RMAIL and
~/RMAIL~ files.  Switch to your RMAIL buffer and kill it (do not save
it!)  This is all cool because your XMAIL file has everything
important in it, right?
8) switch to your XMAIL buffer, go to the start, hit o and type RMAIL
then return.  It'll tell you that your RMAIL file doesn't exist, and
say yes, you want to create it.  Do n, o return for every message in
the XMAIL file.  This procedure will create a new RMAIL file and move
all the old messages into it.
9) when finished with this, do meta-x rmail.  You should end up in
your rmail folder with all your old and new messages less the message
from nineball.
10) ctl-x ctl-c to exit and save everything.  You'll probably want to
go back and remove the XMAIL file later, as we just used this as a
temporary place to stash mail until we finished rebuilding.

Well, that's it.  No guarantees, but it worked for me.  Of course,
probably anyone who uses RMAIL and got that message is trashed, so
they won't see this message... It took me about 2 hours this AM to
figure out exactly what was going on.

I keep hearing (reading) people mention these future events (vapor-raves) and wondering when
were gonna do 'em and who's in charge.  Reminds me of the time the news lady asked the 
Anarchists rioting on Telegraph ave. about 5 years ago "Who's in charge here?", but I digress.
Brian has made it very clear that he's too busy to play as critical a role as he has in the
past to get these events off the ground so I say let's try to make the next event less
hierarchal and more anarchal, while retaining the same or having more organization and
coopreration.  I think the first thing holding either of these projects up is a good space
so keep an eye out and report possibilities.  For Connection II, we also need good weather.
Being a long time Bay Arean, I know that we get short windows of VERY nice weather as we
have been experiencing, particularly in February.  March-April will usualy be very WET.  So I
say it's a taste of things to come (Summer) in February or we'll probably have to wait 'till
late April/May for a Connection II.  As for Alternity, what's up with the 1015 Folsum space?

I don't doubt it's the right address, I was just picturing the white
house/Secret Service/etc recieving hundreds of posts/wk. about
doing nitrous, getting the Rave Guide, etc...

IOW, I was picturing brian eventually having to censor the list, which
I feel would be unfortunate.

HOWEVER, the white-house e-mail address (if true) is an excellent way
to let them know how you feel about things, spiritually or otherwise.
And if Al Gore is nearly the net.zealot he claims, at least some of
the messages will get read.

Subject: upset with san fran

ok here is the deal.i am a student at santa cruz who has been dying to go
to a san fran rave.i have no car so getting to them is quite a prob.
this saturday i spent in berkeley and i was hoping to go to a nice place
that plays techno.a rave would have been favorable but not neccesarry.
i just wanted to dance and after hearing all you folks rave about groove 
kitchen it was the natural place to go.i WALKED from the montgomery bart 
station to king st.it was fucking far.it would have been worth it had we 
gotten in but it turned out to be a 21+ place which you guys forgot to mention
to my dissapointment we had to walk to the fulsom place which was cool
and i enjoyed dancing but i just want to vent my frustration at not being 
able to go to a rave.the fulsom club had great music,lighting and people
although my friend and i were some of the few hets in the place.i had fun
and didn't stop till 6am.
i hope next time i come there will be a real rave going on.

Subject: so _that_ was my weekend?


Was up in SF anyway, scene didn't look encouraging but WTF, alternative was
to sit around my friends apartment and listen to Hafler Trio on a small
boombox, which doesn't work, so we hit Sin.  General agreement w/others:
neat space (I liked the windowless offices upstairs), annoying security,
annoying crowd (with some noteworthy exceptions), music kicked my butt up
and down the stairs.  Man!  Forgive the "what was this?" post but someone
in the back room cranked some insane minimal breakbeat that didn't get matched
the rest of the night -- several insanely tight and punchy kit licks with
occasional crunchy samples of something (couldn't tell what) and scratching.
No bassline, at least not much.  Lit me up despite the crowd of Bored Yet
Possessive Couples (tm) and Hostile-Looking Youth.  Why do these people even
go to raves?  I don't get it.  At least I only got asked three times if I
was selling doses, which is a little under average.  Do people think 
that _everyone_ with long hair who looks over 13 has LSD on them?  Hmm.

So I decided "to hell with everyone, I'm going to trance out with my eyes
closed" and did, to some excellent beats.

OK, I'm ignorant.  Why is Come/Unity so special?  Email me if you want.

PostWhatever:  I thought the ethnic/age/style mix of people was cool, now
some attitude adjustment needs to happen.  Most of the cool people I saw 
there didn't look like the typical rAvE d00dz, so I'm encouraged.

Subject: Filth


I've got mixed feelings posting this, but I thought you
folks would be interested.  Just don't bother getting
steamed up at this twit and arguing with him here, we all
know he's fairly clueless already... 

This is from a street level free rag, Weekly Weird News and
Filth No.6, A column called "Big Words, Little Said" by
Daniel B.R. Wylie:

The column sneers at several topics, A. Modern Primitives,
C. Grrrl Rock, and D. Twenty Nothing Soaps, but our topic
today is B. Raves... 

      Here again we find a case of people trying to draw a
   connection between entertainment/fashion and world
   affecting/function.  I think the proponents of this
   activity need to look where 'raving' came from past and
   present.  The most obvious roots would be the youth
   explosion of the 1960's.  This was indeed very different
   than anything that had come before it but was still in
   the continuous cycle of music, dancing and ideas that
   separates every generation.  But unlike some previous
   'uprisings' the 60's had in the beginning a vast agenda
   of chance and some groovy new tools (drugs) to help
   do it with.  This combined with some radical reactionary
   politics hoped to topple the existing structures of the
   U.S.  But what anyone who has studied the time can attest
   to is the mass disintegration of the 'movement' before
   the collective eyes.  Demonstrating that even with the
   great momentum the 60's had, no amount of bad music,
   bad dancing and bad drugs is capable of bringing about
   any real change.  Worse than this is that the present
   'rave' scene seems to have grown out of some of the same
   holes that swallowed the last one.  Up to its neck in
   drug swilling zombies marching from one gathering to the
   next to the beat(s) of some profit minded Bill Graham
   type (of do they claim to be Techno-Billy Grahams).  The
   kids seem to overlook the fact that a certain bunch of
   lads from a certain country where 'raving' was dying a
   timely death desperately needed a new market of fresh
   minds and full pockets.  "Sure kids you can change the
   world all night long but that'll be $20.00 and the coat
   check is on the left."  
      It's evident how threatened the establishment is by
   all these happy loving (under the influence!) ravers by
   the rise of 'raving' in major theme parks and all the
   delayed releases of the new techno records 'cause of
   their questionable content.  Yeah, when was the last
   time you heard a rave song say anything let alone
   something dangerous or questioning.  The mindless void of
   Disco gave much energy to the rise of Punk, let's hope
   Hip-Hop deals a swift blow to 'raving' before it's too
   late.  And you thought Dead-Heads were bad.

thats what you get when you mail that box

and you cant finger compuserve as far as i know of
so...
but it wouldnt surprise me if it were a real account

and one idea on mix tapes...
well...
if anyone get make a good tape, it IS a way that a lot of DJ's
make a lot of money...
it might be a good way to make some front cash for Connection II
if you could raise a little money ahead of time
it would make it a better event with less being put on the line by people

Subject: RE: Terence McKenna

Okay, broad brushstrokes...

He's the centerpiece of a book called Archaic Revival (Harper & Row, 
SF), which speaks directly to the issues of altered states and 
resulting higher (pardon the pun) consciousness.  He talks extensively 
of DMT and psilocybin, for example, and I find him to be colorfully 
articulate.  He's quite the synthetic thinker, able to take very 
disparate ideas and concepts (aliens, the synesthesiac language gnomes 
of the world-ether, and issues of humanity) and weld them together into 
an up-to-the-moment cosmology, as well as navigational principles for 
getting around in it.   Can't do the book justice; just get it.

Sumi: it should be a very interesting interview; expect nothing, you'll 
get everything.

And yes, I've been told I have a gift for understatement.

Subject: TUDE-A-WAY



many have recently posted that they are extremely bummed out about how lame
the scene has become. too many people sporting much too much ATTITUDE.
well, a grad-student friend of mine in the chemical engineering department
here at stanford, has synthesized a new formula for eliminating bad vibes.
she calls it " 'TUDE-A-WAY!" and here's how it works: when you are at your next
event and someone is sporting major bad vibes in the form of ATTITUDE, just
simply spray them  with a little 'TUDE-A-WAY and magically their attitude 
disappears. i know COME/UNITY shouldn't have any 'tuders in the house but if 
anyone who is going up tonight should want to take some, just post me and we
can arrange a drop off
i know this type of promotion is generally frowned upon, but because i'm giving
the stuff away for free i thought it was o.k. sort of like those people who 
roam the crowds at events with blow pops for everyone or the Los Angeles
version: free popsicles.
There is also a version of 'TUDE-A-WAY that can be used if the whole room
becomes infused with the bad vibes: the 'TUDEBOMB, just light it and leave, and
it 30 minutes the crowd returns to normal.
can't make COME/UNITY because of pat's radio show; be sure to tune in:
12am-3am 90.1 fm

13  2   06:04 Sal
14  3   03:00 E.A.S.E.
15  2   03:13 How Ya Doin'

Comments:  Nightmares on Wax are the English answer to De La Soul.  When I
first bought this disc, I really hated it, to the point of almost trading it
in.  I'm glad I didn't because since my post industrial days, it has grown on
me like kudzu.  NoW substitutes funk for funny in comparison to De La.
Frankly, I like it better.  They also dip into ambience with such tracks as
"Nights Interlude" and "Playtime".

Summary: 8/10.  Mega good stuff, the mega good stuff.


Intermix: Intermix
Third Mind: TMD 9230
1   5   06:09 Anguish
2   5   06:03 S+M=Y
3   5   05:58 Targeted
4   4   03:07 Requiem Dub

6   5   05:27 Dead Ladder
7   3   05:17 Soviet Low
8   4   04:59 Voices

Comments: It is almost embarrassing how much I play this album.  No road-trip
over the last year has been complete without Intermix shooting me through the
night.  Front Line Assembly's Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber certainly made a dent
in dance music with this album.  Although tracks like "Cum & Get It!" wander
back into FLA territory, tracks like "Anguish" and "Voices" show how trance
should be done.  Slow, earth-crushing beats with melodies that take you to a
higher level.  "Targeted" is probably the best track, and has certainly
become an anthem at raves around here.  Any industrialist straying into house
territory should pick up Intermix for the transition.

Summary: 10/10.  At under 45 minutes, this leaves you gasping for more.


Underground Resistance: Revolution For Change
UR/Go Bang!: BANG CD094
1   5   04:55 Riot
2   3   05:38 Punisher
3   3   04:44 Elimination
4   5   04:50 Adrenalin
5   2   06:18 Predator
6   4   06:57 Quadrasonic

11  3   03:12 Beauty of Decay
12  4   05:22 Killer Whale
13  4   04:02 Code of Honor

Comments:  Surprisingly enough, Underground Resistance's best work is not
aggressive fight-for-the-right music as their artwork and attitude would have
you believe.  They actually have some very good trance on here such as
"Quadrasonic", "The Theory", and "Killer Whale".  Granted, a few of the hard
tracks work, such as "Riot", "Adrenalin", and "Code of Honor", but stinkers
such as "Punisher" and "Beauty of Decay" have a 'gotta make something up' air
about them.

Summary: 6/10.  The best stuff I've heard out of Detroit, but certainly not on
a global scale in either trance, acid, or hardcore.


Paroxysm Vol. 1
Black Market/Mute: 9 61226-2
1   4   05:35 DJ Massive: Massive Overload
2   4   04:07 Desiya featuring Melissa Yiannakou: 2 Hearts
3   5   04:47 Underground Resistance: Adrenalin

7   5   03:37 DJ Massive: Point of Intensity
8   4   03:32 Alpha 3-7: Too Positive
9   2   04:35 A.Z.T.: Choice of a New Generation
10  5   04:09 Desiya: Try Again
11  4   04:29 Alpha 3-7: Baboo
12  5   05:22 DJ Massive: Bumpy
13  5   05:04 DJ Massive: Massive Overload (Remix)

Comments:  A deliciously funkadelic mix of diva and highly danceable techno.
My favorite tracks are the ones by Desiya, Melissa Yiannakou manages to stay
funky yet never wails.  Even without her on "Try Again", Desiya makes me want
to shake.  Alpha 3-7 is almost as good.  DJ Massive rips out extremely well
done compositions with spot on samples.  "Acid Bitch" is on the annoying side,
but is really the only boredom on this comp.  Also, if you hate the
"funky-drummer", watch out as most tracks use it in some form or another.

Summary: 9/10.  Gotta find some albums from these people.


Fierce Ruling Diva: Fierce Ruling Diva
Stemra/Boudisque: LES CD1
1   5   04:17 Whipped Kream (Aural Exitement Mix)
2   5   05:21 My Name is House
3   3   03:17 Yeah!
4   4   04:06 Atomic Slide (Rise Up & Work NYC)
5   5   05:01 Rubb It In
6   5   03:49 TFP: The Force of Power (FRD's Quick & Raw Instrumental)
7   4   04:45 Keep Moving in Time (One Track Mind Mix)
8   4   03:15 Drug Me
9   3   05:11 Here Today, Here Tomorrow
10  2   03:27 Bettien Feat. FRD: Allemaal Allemaal!! (Radio Mix)
11  3   04:29 Do This
12  4   05:26 Atomix (909 Rises)
13  4   04:36 On The Move (FRD Drive Mix)

Comments:  The date on this album is 1990, but for some reason tracks keep
resurfacing in the present day.  The reason is the fact that FRD was way ahead
of their time when this was released.  A sharp blend of techno and house with
enough funk thrown in to severely shake your booty.  "Atomic Slide" is another
name for "You Gotta Believe".  Other favorites are "Whipped Kream", "Rubb It
In" and "Keep Moving in Time".  The sole loser track is the one from Bettien
which only features FRD in a backing role.  It reminds me of bad Vicious Pink
(which isn't great in the first place).

Summary: 9/10.  Probably out of print.  I found it used.


Baby Ford: BFORD 9
Sire/Warner Bros: 9 26967-2
1   3   04:25 RU486
2   4   05:40 Fetish
3   4   06:29 Move - On
4   3   05:42 In Your Blood
5   2   04:18 Blow Back
6   3   05:10 Sashay Around The Fuzzbox
7       00:50 Intro (20, Park Drive)
8   2   07:45 20, Park Drive
9   3   06:06 Disconoddy
10  2   05:51 Change (Konrad Cadet Mix 1)
11  3   05:20 Move - On (Alt)
12  3   05:27 Fetish (9AX)
13  2   06:54 Noddy
14  1   07:40 Park Drive (Inst)

Comments:  I realize that Peter Ford is somewhat legendary in this genre, but
most of this disc fails to excite or move me.  The vocal distortion is rather
tired after being pressed through the industrial machine.  The music itself
tends to remind me more of 80's synthpop with sweeps and minimal percussion.
"Fetish" reminds me a lot of Moby's "Electricity", but Moby can make me dance
where Baby Ford just makes me go "hmmmm".  I do enjoy both of the "Move - On"
tracks, probably because his style lends more to trance than hardcore.

Summary: 5/10.  Capable work, just not up my alley.


The Orb: Assassin
Wau Mr. Modo/Big Life: BLRDA 81 863 875-2/BLRDB 81 863 877-2
1   2   15:17 Assassin (The Oasis of Rhythms Mix)
2   4   07:46 U.F.Orb (Bandulu Remix)
Assassin3:
1   3   04:06 Radio 7.
2   3   13:31 Another Live Version
3   1   13:34 Chocolate Hills of Bohol Mix

Comments: A definitely unusual release for Orb.  Assassin itself explores
ambience in different manners.  Due to the credit order, Thrash was leading in
composition of these tracks, yet ambience usually isn't his forte.  Save for
the "Chocolate Hills of Bohol Mix", Assassin doesn't really work.  It meanders
between a dance beat and beatless ambience never deciding in which direction
it really wants to go.  "Chocolate" works only because it stays in the
ambience.  The "Bandulu Remix" of U.F.Orb is swell new version of one of the
best tracks off the album.

Summary: 6/10.  Not everyone will enjoy this.  Orb fans should collect as
usual, but in no way does this compare to previous singles.  You do, however,
get a funky Orb window sticker.


777
Caroline: CAROL 1727-2
1   5   07:14 Sunburst (Seahorse Mix)
2   5   06:32 Miracle (Orb Remix)
3   4   07:35 Depth Disco
4   4   05:58 Altitude
5   3   06:11 Habibi

10  5   02:26 Thunderdog
11  5   06:26 Listen
12  1   02:10 Fractal Liason
13  2   03:25 Over and Out
14  2   06:08 Mia (The Fisherman Mix)

Comments:  System 7 packaged for America, but packaged very well.  I
originally rated the System 7 album at a 6 (Review #3), but I've grown to like
it more and more as time goes on.  The only thing missing from the original
release are the original mixes of "Sunburst" and "Miracle" which isn't too
tragic, since I like the remixes better.  I still don't like "Freedom
Fighters" a lot, but "Dog" and "Habibi" have definitely come into my favor.
I'm glad this disc got a second chance.  Plus, the two bonus tracks, "Depth
Disco" and "Mia" are really spiff.

Summary: 8/10.  Very progressive, yet ambient and sometimes trancy.  777 is
System 7 in a nicer musical package, Ten's booklet was better.


Keeping the Faith - A Creation Dance Compilation
Creation: CRECD 081
1   3   07:14 Fluke: Philly (Jamorphous Mix)
2   4   05:21 Hypnotone: Dream Beam (Danny Rampling Mix)
3   5   09:03 Love Corporation: Palatial (Danny Rampling Mix)
4   5   05:19 Primal Scream: Come Together (HypnotoneBrainMachine Mix)
5   3   06:08 J.B.C.: We Love You (The Great Awakening)
6   4   07:36 My Bloody Valentine: Soon (Andy Weatherall Mix)
7   2   05:59 Sheer Taft: Cascades (Hypnotone Mix)
8   3   07:25 World Unite: World Unite
9   4   06:00 Primal Scream: Loaded (Terry Farley Mix)
10  4   05:09 Hypnotone: Hypnotonic
11  3   06:49 Crazy Eddie & Q.Q. Freestyle: Nena De Ibiza
12  2   06:03 The Sound of Shoom Featuring Eusebe: I Hate Hate (Southwark St.)

Comments: Very funky at times with good dosage of Hypnotone in various forms.
Andy Weatherall's mix of "Soon" is just brilliant, it amazes me that anyone
could turn MBV into something so highly danceable.  "Palatial" is fantastic,
anyone who is into trance should definitely hear it to see how simple, yet
beautiful it can be.  Primal Scream is great, as usual, but when you combine
it with Hypnotone you get something rather stunning.  "Come Together" rips up
floorboards when played.  Everything on this album is great, except for the
drippy soul tracks at the end.  "Nena" is slightly amuzing, but "I Hate Hate"
is overboard.

Summary: 7/10.  Funky, synthey, trancey.  Available on import only.
Hardliners probably won't like this much.

Subject: identifying marks


if i can stay awake past bedtime, i'll be wearing age wrinkles, pot belly,
dilated pupils, (or at least dilated larvae), & a t-shirt w/ the esoteric
pyramid from the dollar bill sewn in silk.  oh yeah, yellow day-glo ear
plugs.  i'll be with the young girl with long blond hair, a white uniform
with a big red cross on the breastplate, and sensible white shoes, following
me around with the oxygen tank and IV tubes.  

p.s.  the ceremony for death of hipi took place long before hipi had spread
far outside san francisco.  one of the prime instigators for the funeral was
the attention of Time mag to the Haight.  get ready ravers, time to mutate.

peace.

Subject: wonderland, dissapointment at other's DJ reviews...

hiya all just thought you would like to hear what an neraver says about
jeno...i agree with him..some of the dcravers didn't get in to him
...i admire their honesty but i feel that they don't have a good background
in house to appreciate him fully...also we are missing a vibe in our
scene...any ideas on how to improve it...??? (help me i'm melting)...
partyon...susie (:   email me with ideas...
----------------------------Original message----------------------------

i walked in the room. shawn (overload) was spinning. i walked up to the dj
booth, set down my bag. i waved. shawn winked, beaming with that wonderful
grin of his... got hugs from mark (MGee) and Dante, and the sound and light
crew from rise...
i love this scene...
after getting my initial energy release out, and my feet and hands warmed up,
i wander around a bit, hugs from david and jason of Bigfunhouse, hugs from the
guy running the smart bar, another friend from rise...
i love this scene...
the rest of the ne-ravers come in.hugs and smiles...
i love, you know...
donato and i recognize...the intro. THE intro. age of love. we run to our
alters. my emotions and heart burst from my body in violent conniptions, arms
extended skyward, mouth agape, tears streaming down my face...the song ends.
i collapse onto the floor...
i love...
debo was wonderful...i really liked his material...funky, happy, pleasant.

BUT!!!!
this is where i begin to distress. after reading more than a few posts from
my fellow morally flexable, eternally-open minded raverz, about their lack of
appreciation for the artwork that Jeno created last saturday, i begin to
feel sad...Jeno lived up to and beyond his reputation...first, if nothing else,
you must admire him for his technical ability- he was spinning on three
turntables. his mixing was fluid and impecable. BUT these are expected of a
DJ... what made love to my mind that night was not his use of the cross-fader
or pitch control, but the gorgious choice of music that he spun (literally, as
in a web) together into a musical form i have never, i repete never heard
before. his music was slower, funky breakbeats, astral and ethereal sounds,
with a mind boggling acid jazz dessert topping... maybe it's that the sound
foreign and new that caused mixed emotions to it...but when i listened to
that music, i felt as if i was witnessing a totally new artform. maybe a few
of you have never got into jazz, or african hi-life, or reggae, but these
sounds were very apparent in his set. i loved it. the breakbeat was slower,
and raw as all fucking hell...we're talking treble redline...and to have over
that, freeform acid jazz, not techno stuff at all, it was...
PHRESH. and PHAT.

of course, after jeno, everyone was doing their best spinning, just to keep up.
JASON JINX. was definitely the other star of the night. incredable.
Dante:what more can you say. i worship him. i love the man to heart.
ONIONZ: by the time onionz came on, i was feeling so good, and so loved, there
was no stopping me. he played exactly what i needed to hear. the ending sucked,
but it wasn't his fault that they shut him down...

the moral of the story: ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALWAYS PSYCHED TO HEAR STUFF WE
RECOGNIZE (SHIT, I DO. WHY DO U THINK I ALWAYS BEG OVERLOAD TO SPIN AGE OF LOVE
AND KINETIC FOR ME...), OPEN YOUR MIND. THE DJ IS THEIR NOT ONLY TO CREATE
THE VIBE, BUT ALSO TO TAKE YOU PLACES. TO TAKE YOU WHERE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
BEFORE. SOMETIMES, YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT WHATEVER A DJ PLAYS, IS GOING TO
BE GOOD, EVEN IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD ANY OF IT BEFORE.

EXAMPLE: WHEN YOU GO TO THE RESTAURANT OF A WORLD-RENOUNED FRENCH-CHEF, YOU
DON'T ORDER A CHEESEBURGER, YOU EAT WHATEVER THE HELL HE FEELS LIKE MAKING!!
BECAUSE, WHATEVER HE MAKES, IS GOING TO BE THE BEST. AND YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE
IT. :)

this is what i think of jeno. if you didn't like the music that he played,
i have a feeling it was because it was very strange and new. the best policy
when observing something new is to not think immediately whether you like it
or not, but to just absorb it. give it a chance. don't put any expectations on
it. just let it flow through you...

sorry, just my art appreciation 101 lecture for the day.

	 I bummed that I wasn't able to go to Come/Unity.  :^(
	 But I think I may have visited it briefly in my sleep.  I dreamt
	 that I was watching a DJ with a mirror behind him and he was doing
	 some incredible scratching in sync with the other spinning record!!
	 Did anyone happen to see me there?  :^)
	 Peace!

I'm certainly glad I made it to a Come/Unity at last.  I got there late
after another long work day and had to leave at 4 but it was definitely
an 'everybody in the place' experience for a change, way crowded and
a bit smoky, but jumpin'!  The toonz didn't have quite the variety
I like but the scene made up for that.  And the chillarea was cool,
met BrianB, geoffw and doom there.  And who was that with the SFR
cap and the earplugs out on the floor?!

Subject: Rave-related virtual actors

I have a video based virtual reality system, and I'm developing
some virtual worlds for ravers to play in while taking a break
from raving.  

I want to develop virtual characters based on the various styles
of techno (breakbeat, harcore, trance, tribal, groove,
progressive house).

I'm looking for any ideas about character development.  Could you
give me any description to how you feel when you're raving to
your favorite style.  Can you describe what your favorite techno
songs look like, or how they would behave if they were raving. 

I know this sounds a bit abstract, but could you give it a try? 
When you reply, please include your name and where you are from
so I can include it in the credits for the demo video that I hope
to do.

thanks,
Rob Campanell
