Reason 4. It has a pretty steep learning curve but can produce some
phenomenal results. It essentially recreates a hardware setup and gives you
the ability to create unlimited synthesizers, samplers and drum machines, it
has a pretty large library of effect devises too. The only reason I wouldn't
recommend it for beginners is that it doesn't have a particularly strong
pre-made sounds library and it doesn't use VSTs, but the trade-off is
spectacular power in making your own synths/samples/effects.

I'd also try and pick up a copy of ReWire (it's sooo handy for using
multiple DAWs), ReCycle (really good sampling software), Renoise (if you're
into sequencers) and Protools (with Massey plug-ins) for mastering. That's a
lot to use when you're starting out though, I'd just recommend messing
around on reason for a while before you start using multiple DAWs.

As far as hardware goes, get a keyboard. If you can, get a M-Audio Axiom.
It's a very nice keyboard with (I think) 32, 49, and 64 keys respectively.
The Axiom 49 is what I use and it has some nice MP-type pads, a bunch of
programmable nobs, buttons and levers. It's made life so much easier for me.

So there you go, first things first: get reason 4 (legally of course, ;) )
and a keyboard. That should provide enough power to make music for years
(hell, that's still what I mostly use). If you have any questions about
Reason or music in general, I know a bit. Don't hesitate to email me.

Peace,
-Lazlo

PS. Hope that helped.

I've never used reason 4, but I find fruity loops really easy and fun

Logic and ProTools are the best. I go to a music school and study electronic music, in all of our studios we have Logic and Protools. I love Logic, but it is only made for a mac and I have a pc. I almost want to switch from pc to mac just for Logic. It can do some awesome stuff. There are tutorials and videos online if you need help using it. It has a ton of sounds and samples to get started. Digital Perfomer is a good program too. Reason and Fruity Loops are limited, not anything special, just toys... I have both, and I like them because they are fun to mess around with, but not that good for making some nice music. You also run into a lot of copywrite issues with Reason and Fruity Loops, so you cant even use their sample libraries. Dont get Reason if you are trying to make serious music. Get Logic! or protools

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey

to me the eigenharp looks alot like the toy guitars in the 90s you could 
plug preprogramed stuff into and as long as you hit the keys and strings 
in time to the beat you could rearrange dire straits' money for nothing 
or something.

the future of music seems to me more like a theramin style holographic 
gui where you can manipulate software in a 3d space with instruments you 
create on your own in reaktor or max msp. 
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PguNPIXfnOs) use of holography in this 
context would entertain an audience better than a guy hunched over his 
laptop or someone projecting what's on screen while he uses a midi 
controller. similar to monolake's demonstration in 5.1 surround at the 
old asphodel compound.

how's that for your mind phuck? visual artists/musicians manipulating 3d 
time and space to make sounds like you've never heard/seen before.

as to answer the young boy's question sans snark.. the top programs out 
there are reason, ableton, reaktor, and logic. and although people swear 
by them on their own, i think that its the combination of live gear 
(keyboards drum machines + real compressor/gates) as well as software 
that makes electronic music sound awesome. i've found there's always 
been this subtle tension between digital and analog and the struggle 
between the two that makes music and contemporary art really fascinating.

respect,
sean.

Nothing beats having a good combination of gear. BUT if you are creative
enough you can use anything. Don't become a gear nut and waste all your tim=
e
searching and buying gear. Just get a basic DAW that you can sequence and
record on and you can get started. My vote for Mac is vision, but that tell=
s
you how long it's been since I produced on a mac. Yeah, go Logic.

Also, depending on the type of music you plan on producing, get involved
with user forums and stuff like that. When I was big into producing I was o=
n
a couple specific forums for progressive/trance producers and got a lot of
suggestions and help from others. Some friends I made on there became prett=
y
big time producers. You could be too.

Oh, one other thing, if you are short on money, but want to get into
production, sign up for an electronic music class at your local community
college. Some have pretty decent studios and you can get plenty of access
only having to pay for the class.

Hey crew! Recorded this mix as an audition back in September when these
tracks were hot off the press, using Torq.  There's something for everyone!
Enjoy.

Much love

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey

I will second the recommendation of Renoise:
http://www.renoise.com/
Alsp you probably have Garageband as well- which is useful as well  
(more for live recording and arranging)

I looked at Renoise long ago when it was just still a basic tracker  
and was unimpressed but was pointed back to it by someone who I trust,  
and with version2 now it seems vary useful.
It is a midi-capable sample-based tracker with hooks to VST/AU  
instruments and FX.

I've gone down the path of Gear Acquisition Syndrome and it's not a  
good one.
Monstrous software acquisition is just as bad.
It's much better to use only a few things, but know them inside and out.
Others' comments here about some packages being toys, and others being  
"pro" because they're used in school etc are meaningless and uninformed.
They all work in different ways because peoples' heads work in  
different ways.
Try them all, see what they do, and see which ones fit with how you  
think

My personal recommendation:
The reality is that these days, almost everything you need is free and  
anyone telling you you NEED this or that is full of shit-
(Renoise is recommended by me)
Samples of any instrument you could want are available free.
(everywhere)
There are free functional analogs of almost any software package you  
can imagine.
(learn how to use simple wave editors like Audacity etc for final  
mastering)
You already have a computer, just buy a controller as it's always nice  
to have some actual keys and knobs etc:
The expensive way would be one of these:
http://www.m-audio.com/index.php?do=products.family&ID=USBkeyboardcontrollers

The inexpensive (and more fun) way would be to get any old used $100  
synth that spits out midi:
http://www.vintagesynth.com/yamaha/an1x.php
And then just get a simple MIDI interface for your computer.
http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/MIDISPORT2x2.html
AND you can use the synth for just standalone wanking around too- the  
older virtual analogs are really cheap right now and good because  
they'll teach you synthesis basics.

Learning about song structure and sonic space/layering are FAR more  
important than which individual piece of gear you use to create  
whatever individual sound.

Also, buy a cheap conga or djembe to develop a sense of rhythm if you  
don't already have it-
Or even a cheap ($200!) electronic drumset:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey

I would recommend logic express, to get you started. It really is best  
of breed for learning how to sequence, etc, an most importantly,  
actually includes some great soft synths, effects and a great sampler  
in the box. If you need to expand later, you can do so, as well as  
explore other stuff like live.

Reason is great, and will teach you how it was done old school  
(actually having to do your own routing, etc), but I don't think you  
can beat logic express, features for price.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey

It's the best program I've found for turning ideas into music in short order.  What it lacks in DAW sophistication, it makes up for in lightning-quick creative workflows.  It's also pretty much the best non-custom-made tool for remixing and performing original electronic music in a live context. 

I dislike using it for straight "DJ" sets because it lacks the ability to effectively turn off its helpful beatmatching autopilot, and I tend to prefer turntablesque controls for that kind of performance (so I use Torq).

Live maps to MIDI controllers very well and the UI is clear, uncluttered, and informative, so in general it's a joy to use.  The main caveat: When creating your own music with Live, you might want to consider mixing through a hardware summing buss, or exporting your final tracks and mixing in a program like Pro Tools, Cubase, or Logic, because I've found Live's internal mixer to lack the fidelity of a good hardware mixer or the more "serious" DAW software.

It sounds fine if you're making really distorted uber-compressed Justice-y stuff or flatlined electro-tweezy shit (and actually the mix buss sounds kind of cool when overloaded, within limits) but it gets tiring to listen to when you just want a bunch of headroom and clear imaging.

Good luck,

Cheers,
-George

I thought the latest Ableton live had a 32 bit mixing bus?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey

I love it, but for the question the guy asked, I think Logic exp is a  
better all round learning tool. You still have to pay extra for  
synths, etc in live. I tend to use it as a scratch pad for ideas. For  
djing, and for sample creation, audio manipulation and general audio  
subversivness. I would never use it over logic for mixing though, and  
I will often bounce into logic from live via rewire.

If someone is just getting started, my advice would be to get 1  
sequencer, a nice midi keyboard, a nice little synth, maybe a nice  
cheap hardware compressor and just learn those until you are masterful  
with them. Then worry about collecting gear.

Actually, live has a 64b internal summing engine, but it just sounds  
janky compared to logic, which in turn sounds janky compared to the  
mix buss on my metric halo, which is only 40b, but logic has the best  
tools in terms of bussing, etc. Idk, it just always feels like I have  
to hack lives routing to get it to do what I want.

It may well (and as a native audio app, probably always has), but it just doesn't sound as good as Logic, and is nowhere near PT (of any flavor) at the moment.

Mixer algorithms are a black art, and what seems like simple math is generally anything but if things are going to sound really good.

Specs almost always have to kowtow to empirical data, at least in audio.

I have my theory about why this is with live, and I think its basically
because there is no true mono file object in live. It will take a mono input
source and go dual mono with it. Those of us who understand the importance
of a mono kick/bass get why this is sub optimal. I think Logic and PT both
have far superior pan law stuff. The best DAW mixing engine, imo is Cubase,
but I'm just so used to logic now that I'm not going to shift from it. Live
for creativity, Logic for the actual nuts and bolts of assembling a mix.
Peak for audio file stuff.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey

George-

I trust your opinion but have you really done blind A/B stuff here?
There's no such thing as "mixer algorithms"- there's simple overlay  
amplitude projecting each channel across the entire bit/freq range  
which creates distortion, or you get to divide your master bitrange by  
the number of channels and fit it all in to whatever your final output  
hardware can do
Anything beyond that is "massaging" of the signal and should be called  
out as such.
I would wager that if you are hearing "nastiness" in an application's  
final mixing output (which is probably about the simplest part of the  
audio path) then it's only because whatever you're comparing it to is  
artificially adding "warmth" or compression or cutting digital clips  
and blending with the surrounds etc etc etc-
But as always, the point is moot- because what sounds better, sounds  
better :)

Subject: [sfraves] Room(s) available in the mission

Available for sublet or for permanent occupancy.  I'm hoping someone
in the community could be looking.

Depending on the timing, you may have a choice of one of two rooms.
Both rooms are part of a large communal house (the Lilypad, for those
that are
familiar with it.).  One faces west, the other faces East (but doesn't
get so much sunlight.)

Shared kitchen and living room.  Two levels, with a spiral staircase
between levels.  Washer and Dryer in house.  Balcony with a view and
lots of plants.  (Would LOVE someone who loves plants!)

The people living here are friendly, creative types, which include
artists, designers, dancers, musicians, DJs, etc. Bicyclist friendly.
No TV watchers in the house. (We do watch movies though.)  We also have
2 very friendly cats.

Rent is $625, which includes utilities.  (Can sublet for $200/wk also.)

Hope to hear from some interesting folks!

Hi there,
Back to feeling better, so I'm doing the show again today.  And I'm
bringing you a double CD mix that Juan Segovia passed along to me last
week.  Nice tech house mix that you really should have a listen to!

Tune in online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu or listen over the air
at 90.1 FM on the dial.

Peace!

i have a friend in berlin who runs a shop with all used stuff. basically 
its the only used electronic record store in berlin so it keeps coming 
up with treasure. www.audio-in.net. though he sells to people 
internationally mostly on discogs.com last i heard.

http://www.discogs.com/sell/list?seller=audio-in

i've gotten stuff i've never found online there. for stuff you can't 
find there, i'd recommend hitting up either gemm.com, htfr.co.uk, or 
discogs.com marketplace. you'll be very broke, and very happy in a very 
short amount of time.

teh-know!
sean.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Looking to buy acid vinyl

I'm slowly going thru and blowing out my collection of 70+ crates of vinyl.

acid house, tech house, techno, acid techno, trance-no, progressive, gay disco house, dubby house, electroclash, some d+b, downtempo.

am selling individual pieces for top dollar if you want to come by my house and preview, BUT am willing to blow out entire lots of 100+ records at super cheap prices.

serious inquiries only.

i've got a couple crates of randomness sitting around that used to belong to
James Bass.

mostly oldish techno and house.

he just gave it all to me.  not sure what in there is worthwhile, but if
anyone wants to come by and poke around, hit me up.

i'm sure i'd sell 'em pretty damn cheap.  but its also fun to keep around
and just pull out random cuts sometimes too. :)

g.bird presents

"From the Beginning...
...To the End"

An evening with

DANIEL BELL

(Accellerate . 7th City . Perlon)

* 5 hour DJ set
* exclusive SF appearance
* super clear Turbosound sound system
* intimate 100 person event :)

Located at our beloved "rave cave",
222 Hyde Street, SF
9pm - 2am / 21+ / $20

____________________________________________________________


That's right folks...he's back! One year ago this dance music legend
performed a feat of DJing that blew minds and rocked worlds when he played
an epic NINE HOUR continuous set for us without so much as stopping to take
a pee. This was Dan's longest set he'd ever played, and he never missed a
beat.

To many people there, myself included, this event will be filed amongst
their favorite dancefloor memories EVER. If you were there, you know exactly
what I mean. If not, you missed something truly special that will be talked
about for years.

Now, one year later, Mr. DBX himself returns with another extended voyage
into the button down mind of an icon. Although he is currently touring the
US, at every other stop he'll be playing a standard 2 hour set. But since
Dan has such a special relationship to this city, we've talked him into
going FIVE, from the first notes of the evening at 9pm, to the final song
when the lights come up at 2am.

SO.... You're probably asking, HOW DO I GET IN ON THIS???

Pretty simple. Either pay me the $20 admission charge in person sometime
this week, (some of you already have), or send in the money via PayPal and
include the first and last names of the people who will be attending.

This event will be "will call" only. Meaning, once you've secured your spot,
your name will be on a list at the front door upon arrival, and you simply
show your ID to get in.

Also, THIS EVENT WILL SELL OUT. You know this. In fact, it's quite possible
it will sell out within a day or so, so please don't lollygag if you'd like
to join us. The 100 spots available are first come, first served, and OVER
HALF ARE ALREADY GONE. You snooze...you lose! There will be NO cash accepted
at the door from people not already on the will call list.

I do apologize about the steep price, but to see someone of this caliber in
such an intimate location (on a Saturday night no less) this is what needs
to be charged. Artist and booking fees, roundtrip airfare from NYC, hotel,
transportation, and the extra $150 I've paid for him to bring a second crate
of vinyl from Europe...well, it all adds up. So please understand that due
to these factors and the fact that this event will be filled with friends
and colleagues, having a guest list is simply not possible. Everybody's
gotta pony up!

____________________________________________________________


To secure your spot for Saturday, either:


*** Pay me in person between now and Saturday afternoon.

(This will save you a buck and some internet BS.)

OR

*** Send $21 per attendee via PayPal to danielbell222@gmail.com

(Extra dollar covers PayPal fees.)

Before completing the payment, be sure to include your FIRST AND LAST NAME
in the comments field. If you are paying for more than one person, include
the full names of each guest. Feel free to let your friends know, but please
DO NOT re-post this info publicy. We're trying to make sure all the right
peeps get a chance to attend before we sell out!

If you don't have a PayPal account, it's easy and free to sign up for one
at http://www.paypal.com. If that's not an option for you, ask a friend who
does have a Pay Pal account to pay for you and give them cash. Again, there
will be NO cash transactions at the door.

IF YOUR PAYMENT ARRIVES AFTER WE HAVE REACHED CAPACITY, your money will be
refunded via PayPal and you will receive notification. Get 'em now so this
doesn't happen to you!

____________________________________________________________


If you have any further questions, please hit me up via Facebook, by email
at this address, or by phone at 415-305-8754. Do not send personal
correspondence to the (payment only) PayPal address above, as it will not be
read or responded to.

Thanks for reading, sorry for the long post, and I hope to see you Saturday!

Best in my opinion is Shure M44-7(G) But they're not cheap. Best bass  
response, tracking, etc.

Everyone needs a little bling!

I'm not the guy to ask but I can't believe much has changed in this  
arena in the past 10 years-

Shure Whitelabel and Ortofon Nightclub were/are(?) standards :)

been a long while since I hung up my headphones but whitelabels seem to have
better track wear, with good skip resistance and slightly better sound
purity, though the M44-7-G is more rugged, will have fuller bass, and can
handle back cueing better.

Neither's cheap but the M44-7s are easier to find good prices on.  If you
luck out you'll see whitelabels on ebay for half price though, and they come
in that nice box (and no fiddly screws assembling em) that makes you look
cooler when you pull em up for a set. ;)

-R.

 Like I've said before better tracking usually means more wear on vinyl.=
 M44-7G, if tone arm geometry set right then, it will have minimal wear bu=

 to adjust the tone arm geometry and counter balance. The Ortofon Nightclu=

Due to a nasty case of the flu, Dan Bell was forced to cancel his trip to SF
and will not be performing tonight. :(

Don't worry, everyone who paid will receive a full refund.

We will still be rocking it tonight @ 222 and the party is now FREE.

Come get your swerve on with all the money you just saved. ;)

NEW LINEUP:

09:00-10:30 MossMoss

10:30-12:30 Moniker (Eo + Kenneth Scott)

12:30-02:00 Sammy D


Sorry folks, hope to see some of you out anyways.

These are some of my favorite local DJs!

Subject: [sfraves] Mainstreaming Psychadelics: From FDA to Harvard to Burning Man

--000e0cd20ff40353990478ab9dbf
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Check out this techtalk given at Google about psychadelics:
http://www.youtube.com/user/googletechtalks?blend=1&ob=4#p/u/0/NwAGkGpv6Ss

Abstract:

Presented by Rick Doblin, Ph.D., Executive Director MAPS.

We're now in the midst of a worldwide renaissance in psychedelic research,
after decades of political suppression. Even media reports, which usually
mention in passing the widespread use of psychedelics by the counterculture
in the 1960s, are more hopeful than alarming. In this talk, we'll review the
factors which led to the backlash and the lessons to be learned, discuss how
the FDA opened the door to research around the world, how the ghost of
Timothy Leary was buried at Harvard, and how Burning Man struggles to
respond to people who have difficult psychedelic experiences. We'll conclude
by explaining how non-profit drug development, initially of MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy for postraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can transform
psychedelics into FDA-approved prescription medicines and can lay the
groundwork for the successful, long-term integration of psychedelics into
the mainstream of medicine, religion, art, creativity, and celebration.

Rick founded MAPS in 1986. His dissertation [
http://www.maps.org/dissertation/]
<http://www.maps.org/dissertation/%5D> (Public
Policy, Harvards Kennedy School of Government) was on "The Regulation of the
Medical Use of Psychedelics and Marijuana," and his masters thesis [
http://www.maps.org/docs/doblin-mt.html]<http://www.maps.org/docs/doblin-mt.html%5D>
(Harvard)
focused on the attitudes and experiences of oncologists concerning the
medical use of marijuana. His undergraduate thesis [
http://www.maps.org/research/cluster/psilo-lsd/goodfriday.p df] (New College
of Florida) was a twenty-five year follow-up to the classic Good Friday
Experiment [http://www.maps.org/books/pahnke/index.html]<http://www.maps.org/books/pahnke/index.html%5D>,
which evaluated the potential of psychedelic drugs to catalyze religious
experiences. He has also conducted a thirty-four year follow-up study to Tim
Learys Concord Prison experiment [
http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v09n4/09410con.html].<http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v09n4/09410con.html%5D.>

Rick studied with Stan Grof, M.D., and was in the first group to become
certified as holotropic breathwork practitioners. His professional goal is
to help develop legal contexts for the beneficial uses of psychedelics and
marijuana, primarily as prescription medicines but also for personal growth
for otherwise "healthy" people, and to also become a legally licensed
psychedelic therapist. He resides in Boston with his wife and three
children.

Hey Guys,

My girlfriend and I are planning on visiting San Francisco for our
anniversary.  Anyone know of anything good going on the weekend of the
12th?  We'll be ariving on Friday and leaving on Sunday.  I thought
Trippendicular was going to happen that weekend but now they've gone and
changed it... plus there isn't even a flyer out.  Any fun activities besides
normal San Francisco happenings?

Thanks,

Orion

Lot of competition from several ends on that night.  Birthday party for a 
close friend in Daly City.  Jeff Mills will be in town.

Can't we all just get together and do this on different nights?  ;)

Anywhere specific on Facebook or just through your network of friends?

I am most interested in what is happening either Fri., Dec. 4th or Sat., 5t=
h for my birthday weekend.=20

I actually live in Mammoth but make it over to SF about 4x a year (grew up =
there).   Not much music to dance to here in the mountains (besides the sho=
rt trek to BRC once a year)!!! =20

Thanks!  Christina

Why don't we use a Google calendar that has write-access for a few people we
trust, and embed it read-only in a webpage somewhere for people to view?

I often cruise the pages of my favorite local DJs and just see what's on
their gig calendars.  If someone I really like lists an opening/supporting
gig, it's likely a headliner that's worth checking out.  I noticed Jerome
Hill and LuSINda had been brought in from London because Forest was spinning
with them, awesome freaking party on a Thursday night.

For first saturday gigs, there's always kontrol, which generally means there
won't be any other club techno parties to speak of, though there's often a
decent underground in oakland.  and there's other genres of course.  DnB
seems kind of random, dubstep parties (usually they're actually glitch hop)
even more so.

Honestly, for Friday nights I tend to just head over to killswitch for happy
hour and ask everyone there what's going on. :)

I also largely just use facebook, since everything just gets 
pushed to me, but that doesn't help people that don't already 
have a network established.

It would also be pretty fast to put up a joomla-based calendar, 
and give multiple people admin access. Cool thing about this is 
anyone can submit events, admins just have to approve for 
display.

I just might make this a holiday project.

This utility makes it so that you can get data from a hard drive with windows

It's so useful for me that I bought it a while back. Thought I'd let everybody
know about it in since it's free for today.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Looking for someone to make a candy bracelet

i attempted to make a bracelet recently at a party i was doing sound 
for. it's a hard project especially especially if you have big hands. 
15-18 year old girls seem to have a special knack for it. those girls 
seem to practice making excellent symmetry under extremely intoxicated 
conditions and construct latticed versions that confound my oldschool 
mindset. 'more than 2 strings for one bracelet? what's that?'

my timid attempt had varying shades of fluoro orange offset by varying 
shades of phosphorescent green star beads.. it was all going so well 
until i tried to tie it, then whoosh! all on the floor. a girl came up 
to me and hugged me for my valiant effort, as she had been looking on 
the whole time. i was like, "damn, someone woulda liked that." i looked 
on as the other girls at the table gave my feeble attempt a significant 
pwnage.

so just to rush to the defense of dear nico. that shit ain't easy. lolz.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Looking for feedback on 1200 refurbishing/repair service

--001636c5be98c650900479382c1a
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hello SFR,

I've been working on starting-up a 1200 refurbishing/repair business to make
a little extra cash on the side. Wondering if some of the headz on here
would be willing to offer me some feedback on what you think would be a fair
price to charge for services such as:

1) Ground wire mod (removal)
2) RCA cable replacement
3) Tone arm replacement
4) Pitch range adjustment
5) Pitch zero click removal on older models
6) LED mods

and also on selected mixers:
7) Crossfader refurbishing / rebuilding
8) Crossfader replacement

I was thinking a flat hourly rate (+ cost of parts) with 1 hour minimum, but
don't want to overcharge for what I generally perceive as "easy" work. Does
$50.00/hr for the services above, presuming most work could be accomplished
in less than two (2) hours? Would a one year warranty on workmanship
influence your decision to use my services? Also, what if I'd be willing to
teach you how the services above are performed, so you wouldn't have to come
back a second time? Appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks!

Chuck.G

I would expect most DJs would prefer paying per-mod than the always
amorphous T&M charge.  They don't really care how long it takes you, just
how long it takes to get it back, and how much it'll cost in total.  :)

It should also make sense for you.  It's one model of turntable, while there
will be a little variation, for the most part they should all be the same
for you.  If some changes are the exceptions, it'd be fine to list them as
examples of things that fall under your "shop rate" but treating them all
that way tends to make people take it a bit strangely.  You could, if you
liked, list the above chart TELLING them that most work will be completed in
under 2 hours; but by then, you've setup an expectation, so why not be more
explicit?  You can say most work can be done in under 100 bucks just as
easily and people can feel comfy deciding if it's worth paying you that
much.

Yes, providing a warranty is always good.  Being able to show them how any
problems aren't your fault is critical to that though.  (Can't just take it
back in and say "see, this was worn out and it would have failed either way
unless they can really see how it was a part you never touched)

Teaching people how to do the work themselves should be a separate thing,
mixing it will just make your work take longer. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Dance Democracy house party raid?

Anyone else heard about his event?  

Seems like the police entered a private residence where a private and invitation only party was being held and the proceeded to search the place without a warrant.  But I have no additional facts...

This is why you do not hold raves in your own house people.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Considering it was widely promoted with a simple "hit me up for an
invitation" it would hardly count as a true invitation-only event.  That 1
person happened to be residing there doesn't make the entire place a private
residence, particularly if it's a warehouse space that was never technically
rezoned.  IF there was a separate lock to his room he could probably have
kept them away from that, but from the promotion I saw around the event, it
was effectively made public.

OTOH, it's not like that's stopping the SFPD from performing illegal raids
and seizures as we've already read.  I'd hope Fan has a lawyer, though
honestly, if they haven't charged him yet it's likely going to blow over
unless he got some hard evidence and chooses to pursue them.

all the police would have to do or say to enter a private residence and 
search the place without a warrant would be to say they smelled 
something closely akin to an illegal substance and 'see' drug 
paraphernalia. but also know that what most people do at these events 
is, well, illegal. don't get caught.

that said, here's a fun refresher on how to avoid being in a police 
state http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqMjMPlXzdA

The smell of an illegal substance does not allow the police to enter a residence. Your home provides the greatest expectation of privacy. Even if the police believe that there is a crime being committed they must first acquire a search warrant from a judge. The only time that they can enter without permission is if they her cries for help or believe someone to be in danger.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Dance Democracy house party raid?

A search is reasonable, and a search warrant is not required, if all of the circumstances known to the officer at the time, would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry or search was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officer or other persons/the destruction or concealment of evidence/the escape of a suspect, and if there was insufficient time to get a search warrant. 

United States v. McConney, 728 F.2d 1195, 1199 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 824 (1984)

IANAL, but I still think they need a warrant to enter your property unless they can reasonably show one of the above conditions.

Hi Lukas-

You're entirely wrong and misinformed. "I smelled marijuana" is a  
common justification used to enter a residence, and its standing as  
probable cause has been firmly confirmed by the courts :)

And again, if it's an industrial use warehouse and not a
commerical/residential apartment, they don't have to assume it's anyone's
residence. :P

Admittedly, doesn't mean they won't enter someone's apartment, either.  This
has been, and continues to be, less about law enforcement than intimidation.
 They're trying to scare people into not having parties.   Keeping a DJ's
laptop for a week, telling some kid he's going to jail, all obvious tactics
designed to get people afraid they'll lose their livelihood and maybe their
home. Standard bullying tactics.

Seems like party planners need to think a little about perimeter defenses.  It's not like the police are ninjas dropping in on your party from black helicopters and crashing through the skylights...come on, you can get a bit creative about this...

Happy thanksgiving!

Peter

And again, if it's an industrial use warehouse and not a commerical/residential apartment, they don't have to assume it's anyone's residence. :P

Admittedly, doesn't mean they won't enter someone's apartment, either.  This has been, and continues to be, less about law enforcement than intimidation.  They're trying to scare people into not having parties.   Keeping a DJ's laptop for a week, telling some kid he's going to jail, all obvious tactics designed to get people afraid they'll lose their livelihood and maybe their home. Standard bullying tactics.

Some of us have very much thought about this.  We're just on hold from
throwing parties for other (i.e. time and money) reasons. :)

The building is zoned for residential/ light industrial use.

The venue space is actually the residence of a person named Fan Joseph.
Fan, and his dog Dopey, live in the in the room adjacent to the bathrooms
and both where present during the party.  Plain clothes police officers
attempted to enter the residence at roughly 3am.  When the doorman asked the
plainclothes officers for their membership pass or invitation at the front
gate (before entering the building) the plain clothes officers responded
with "How much is it to get in?" the door person responded with "This is a
private event. You don't have a invitation?"  The plain clothed officers
then pulled out their badge, identified themselves as police officers, and
said to the door person "We don't need one."  The police  FORCED their way
through the front gate without Fans consent even after being asked numerous
times for a warrant and that they did not have consent to enter. When Fan
told the police officers "THIS IS MY HOUSE! YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO
COME IN HERE!", they told him to "Shut up, put your hands on your head, and
sit on the floor unless you want to go to jail." Fan complied and sat on the
floor with his hands on his head but told the police officers again that
they cannot enter into his home without a warrant and was violating his
constitutional rights, he was stood up, handcuffed, and was told he was
"going to jail." The police officers then restricted any persons from
leaving or entering his home and made their way into his dwelling space.
One officer approached the person standing by the sound system and demanded
him to turn off the music while the other officers detained everyone in the
kitchen area. After majority of people (members and invited guests) vacated
Fans home after being threatened to be arrested, the police began to search
Fans entire house. The bathrooms, kitchen, his bedroom, every closet, guest
rooms, and storage rooms. They searched in drawers, cabinaets, mattresses,
dressers, sofa cushions, backpacks and purses that where unattended, pockets
of unattended clothing, basically everywhere and everything. WITHOUT A
WARRANT, PROBABLE CAUSE, OR EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES! The police basically
executed a felony home invasion.

The police seized banners, t-shirts, cash, a laptop, and a hard drive.
Property receipts were only issued for the laptop and hard drive.

When issuing the citation to Fan they asked for his ID and he told them it
was in his room. When they allowed him to get his ID from his bedroom his
dog emerged from his room and began to walk around the area where the police
where. An officer saw the by his legs and said "Where the hell did this dog
come from?" Fan replied "That is my dog, he was in my bedroom the whole
time. That's what i've been telling you, this is my house! I live here" The
police still in disbelief all gathered to his bedroom door to find a queen
size bed, televsion set, clothing, dressers, and mail addressed to Fan and
with the address of the space they where all in. They officer in charge
proceeded to issue the citation to Fan while others searched his bedroom.

You can debate exigent circumstances but if there were any present, the
police would have simple said to the doorman, "We are coming in' instead of
trying to slither in with a crowd.

Even if people where yelling that there was an afterparty at this home does
not make it open to the public. People were denied entry for not having an
invite or pass. This might have been a publicly advertised event, but it was
still a private party.

The police have been doing sweeps for late night parties in SOMA in the past
few months:

http://www.sfweekly.com/2009-11-18/music/s-f-cops-may-have-gone-too-far-in-seizing-dj-gear-at-underground-parties

http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=9462


The way the police where going about it was very wrong and they were bound
to slip up. This case at Fan's *home *is hopefully where their constitution
shredding havok will end. But you know our system, it's not what you know,
it's what you can prove.

That's why we have been send out emails to invitees, membership holders, and
attendees, to ask them if they would write a letter stating their experience
at our party. Building our case and gathering as many witnesses is the best
thing we can do for this lawsuit that will be filed soon. Fan is very very
upset and feels violated and disgusted at what has happened to him and
others like him.

Also a big question that keeps arising was "did they find any drugs?" The
answer to that question is no they did not find any illegal narcotics. But
the bigger issue here is that they entered this mans home without consent, a
warrant, or exigent circumstances. Even if they did find anything illegal,
they obtained this evidence illegally therefore all evidence found should be
suppressed under the "fruit of the poisoned tree" doctrine.

But like i said earlier, it's not what you know, it what you can prove. We
have one witness who was in the stairwell and heard Fan telling the police
to leave his home. He has wrote a letter and is willing to testify in court.
We also have a few other letters from attendees and invitees.

If anyone would like to send a letter with your experience at one of our
events then you can send it to DanceDemocracy@gmail.com

MMmmm, got any sauce for the copypasta?  I think most of us have seen the
spin spam after the first line; no need to attach it again.

There's also no such thing as zoning on a building incidentally.  They get
listed for certain types of use within the zoning district.

Are you saying you live in an SLR district (the only zoning districts SF
uses that mix Residential, Light Industrial, and  also Service, and is
mostly concentrated in SoMA and Potero Hill, for anyone surveying), one
dwelling per 200 feet of space, minimum 25% rear open space with no less
than 36 square feet of open space per resident?  There are a host of
requirements for a mixed use space beyond that; and there's no simple LR
building designation.

Been too long since I dealt with business real estate and IANAL, but in
short, any given part of the building will have been either Residence (Fan's
home) or Light Industrial use, not both.  The private resident portion would
be protected but would not be allowed to be used as Light Industrial.  The
Light Industrial portion would not be accorded the protection of Residential
and would also be a Code violation if people were living there.  The
dual-use spaces (i.e. Live/Work spaces) have yet other definitions and
requirements.

Hope you have a good lawyer, Fan.  You'll probably avoid prosecution but if
you want to keep throwing parties you'll need better than what's in the
letter.  Best of Luck, I'm sure we're all hoping you do have better attorney
mojo than the city and can get them to think twice before they try to bully
anyone else, but I'd be surprised if anything meaningful happens anytime
soon.

Calling this a "felony home invasion" isn't quite right is it?  That sort of language won't win you any points in court IMO/IME, but IANAL so take it or leave it.

Simple answer is don't let this happen again.  If you had maintained a proper perimeter, the police very likely would not have entered the home and you wouldn't now be facing an expensive and irritating experience in court.

I wouldn't suggest that you throw other parties at this or any other location anytime in the near future, but if you do throw some other events down the road do make sure to maintain a perimeter for the safety and comfort of your guests.

Also invite some lawyers to your events.  The police will behave a bit differently in the presence of your legal counsel especially if they have a camera.

PS...

 The fact that you had people there with "membership passes" doesn't sound at all like a private house party, it sounds like a for profit commercial event.  People get invitations to real  house parties, they do not present membership passes.  

This is going to bite you I think.

Calling this a "felony home invasion" isn't quite right is it?  That sort of language won't win you any points in court IMO/IME, but IANAL so take it or leave it.

Simple answer is don't let this happen again.  If you had maintained a proper perimeter, the police very likely would not have entered the home and you wouldn't now be facing an expensive and irritating experience in court.

I wouldn't suggest that you throw other parties at this or any other location anytime in the near future, but if you do throw some other events down the road do make sure to maintain a perimeter for the safety and comfort of your guests.

Also invite some lawyers to your events.  The police will behave a bit differently in the presence of your legal counsel especially if they have a camera.

MMmmm, got any sauce for the copypasta?  I think most of us have seen the
spin spam after the first line; no need to attach it again.

There's also no such thing as zoning on a building incidentally.  They get
listed for certain types of use within the zoning district.

Are you saying you live in an SLR district (the only zoning districts SF
uses that mix Residential, Light Industrial, and  also Service, and is
mostly concentrated in SoMA and Potero Hill, for anyone surveying), one
dwelling per 200 feet of space, minimum 25% rear open space with no less
than 36 square feet of open space per resident?  There are a host of
requirements for a mixed use space beyond that; and there's no simple LR
building designation.

Been too long since I dealt with business real estate and IANAL, but in
short, any given part of the building will have been either Residence (Fan's
home) or Light Industrial use, not both.  The private resident portion would
be protected but would not be allowed to be used as Light Industrial.  The
Light Industrial portion would not be accorded the protection of Residential
and would also be a Code violation if people were living there.  The
dual-use spaces (i.e. Live/Work spaces) have yet other definitions and
requirements.

Hope you have a good lawyer, Fan.  You'll probably avoid prosecution but if
you want to keep throwing parties you'll need better than what's in the
letter.  Best of Luck, I'm sure we're all hoping you do have better attorney
mojo than the city and can get them to think twice before they try to bully
anyone else, but I'd be surprised if anything meaningful happens anytime
soon.

>From some of the case law I recently read, the circumstances for searching=
 a private residence are much different than say searching one's vehicle.=
 And yes, the police may enter if someone may be in harm's danger, or if ev=
idence is at risk or to apprehend a suspect. =C2=A0However, if an officer=
 were to smell an illicit substance coming from the residence, the circumst=
ances are different for searching a residence than say a vehicle- simply pu=
t this does not fall under the same set of legalities.

Here's a little bit of info taken from a California law firm that handles=
 criminal degense cases:

In some situations, a search may be found reasonable despite the lack of a=
 warrant. However, to establish the presence of emergency or "exigent" circ=
umstances, there must be a showing of necessity. People v. Sutton (1976) 65=
 Cal.App.3d 341, 351. Specifically, at the time the warrantless entry is ma=
de, there must be an =E2=80=9Cimminent and substantial threat to life, heal=
th, or property.=E2=80=9D Id. at 350.
Whether the requisite exigency is present to justify a warrantless entry in=
to a home will depend on the surrounding circumstances. Courts tend to focu=
s on apparent threats to safety and property, and the immanency of those th=
reats. If you feel that your legal rights may have been violated you should=
 immediately consult with a California criminal defense law firm that can=
 help you win your case.

Hope that helps a little =C2=A0;)

IANAL, but I still think they need a warrant to enter your property unless=

The smell of an illegal substance does not allow the police to enter a resi=

Considering I've seen original SL1200s (with no Mk designation) still in
use, we also have another couple decades before they're all dead.

(assuming the rates of turntable failures and of DJs moving away from
turntables both track roughly the same log scale as they seem to have ---
declining sales is both a function of vinyl being less popular and of the
existing tables being fairly durable if not always reliable)

-R.

I call BS on that article, I could see them streamlining the variety of
1200s they produce, but no way they're just killing the whole line
worldwide.  Even with depressed sales, it still has to be the best selling
turntable around the world.

 1200 refurbishing/repair  service

Well, there are these:

http://123dj.com/cd/pioneer/vdj1000.html

...and they've come down in price, if they come down more I 
might bite.

But yeah, What Jas said, a fast mac, midi controller and Modul8 
will yield far more mileage imho.

Subject: [sfraves] VDJs

 if anything dvd decks dj decks could give visual artists more work. 
there is an apparent lacking in the video department of electronic music 
as a whole. i know this because i collect electronic music videos and i 
get really excited when i see a new one by my favorite artists. its 
mostly because there is no budget for a video for an independent label 
to produce a track and when an artist puts a video behind something they 
believe in, it's usually very good content. so i think a whole set of 
vdjs would rock. i'm just waiting for the traktor upgrade to include 
video or .flv.

theoretically you could spend less time vjing live and making more 
videos for more money and being less cranky being the only vj for hours 
and hours and hours with your equipment slowly breaking down.. there 
seems to be more possibilities open when you combine audio and video. i 
mostly imagine colors when i hear sounds anyway.. if there were a way to 
control the entire audio visual spectrum as a 'media jockey' i would do 
it.. especially if its affordable. if i could get all the VJs together 
in a consortium to make awesome videos for techno all the time, i would.

it still seems like the whole world of vjing is under developed since 
the 90s when we were promised 4-5 VJs per night and the environment 
would change and evolve with the dj sets. at least with video artists 
like heroic robot there's a real sense of development and originality 
within the content. i've only seen this with MP and speedy j's vj in 
recent years but i suspect this is evolving at a faster rate. i just 
wish that there were better representation in the community. i think 
that VDJs could do this and help spread the influence of a vj's recorded 
content further afield.

love livin in the future,
sean.

You know, making visuals that aren't full frame 720x480 on a rectangular
screen.   Crazy, I know, but sometimes more interesting to look at.  The
VCDJs allow you to manipulate one dimension: time.  Modul8 lets you
manipulate size, rotation, distortion, etc in four dimensions: x,y,z and
time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] VDJs

Through ReWire/MIDI loopback drivers, it's pretty trivial to link Live to video programs like Arkaos or Modul8.  I played with a guy in England who did just that, firing off clips of MIDI data to control Arkaos VJ as well as doing his normal live remixing/dj stuff.  It really made for a cool show.  The main gating factor would be if your comp can take the onslaught of what you want to do in Live *and* running the video program.  You could always have two laptops, I suppose.

With Ableton Live now supporting Max, performing artists can link visuals to samples and bits so they get triggered in sync with the music, making creation of on-the-fly visuals relatively seamless -- however it's a level of detail work that I know I'm not really interested in, but I can see the possibilities for those willing to put in the time and effort.

Also, you can output modul8 at higher resolution then DVD video.  I think we
run at 1024x768, which is much clearer then NTSC (720x480 interlaced)
