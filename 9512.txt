It seems that we are getting into the dreaded raver sickness time. Yes, we
love sharing..... each other's germs! Combine a hot sweaty club with drinking
out of each other's water bottles, and look what happens! Bleah! Keep your
spit to yourselves now, take lotz of vitamins, and I hope to see everyone
soon!

This should cheer up your day :)

This kid Brian Wang did this cool little comic that he was giving out at
Friends and Family. It's really great. I thought it would be nice for the
rest of the world to see, since I think the distribution was kinda small
!!!

Enjoy,

I was very sick this time last year and I got just barely well enough to 
attend the Gathering 3 Year.  Needless to say, I *way* overdid it, and I 
was gravely ill til after New Years.  However, I would do it all over 
again, I had such a good time!!  Knock on wood, I'm still feeling well. 

love,
Amy

I want to preface this by saying that I have had some *GREAT* times at the 
FMR's Wicked put on a couple of years ago. 

Some things Wicked has going for them:

1) A KILLER sound system.
2) Competent DJ's

The other side of the coin:

1) Too many fashion mavens and gangstas at the parties.
2) The Rock'n'Roll Superstar Syndrome of the DJ's.

Cover for most of the parties hover around $15 which is a bit much for 
King Street nowadays IMO.

I had mentioned to Shawna about having a meeting place at the Gathering 
for all sfravers who would be meeting each other.  I'm still amazed at 
all the sfravers I've introduced who haven't met one another yet.  It brings 
be great joy to bring others together.  I'll post more about suggested 
meeting areas at the Gathering when the date gets closer.

love to all,
Amy

I don't know him, but I heard him at SPAZ a month or two ago.  He is from
Kentucky, and he spins techno/hard stuff - Gabber.  He rocked the crowd,
but was not to good at mixing.  I enjoyed his set nonetheless.  I don't
know where you can find him, but you could start by contacting the SPAZ
people.

turkey to make him due the Jiving/Raving funk dance (especially good 
with a sound card).

Very simple. Go to Burning Man? See the Ultra-Elite Bus away from 
everyone else that was invitation-only? Go to Tribal Future? See the 
private Wicked encampent away from EVERYONE, and I mean EVERYONE, 
including every single other DJ that weren't Wicked crew? I didn't come 
to this conclusion alone, or for no reason.

Well I just got off the phone with the Trocadero.  It seems that Bass was
told the wrong price for the tickets, so everyone that paid $18 for thier
tickets will get a $10 refund at the door.  :)  They said that only like 20
people got charged that price, so hopefully they will notice and say
something at the door.  Bass still sucks for charging thier lame extea fees,
but at least the confusion is fixed.

The "ultra-elite" bus - is this that silver bus that somebody named JB 
drives around?  Indeed, this bus is elite.

Once I got on that bus and there were some pretty cool people there. 
I had heard from those the bus had snubbed that this was a scary bus and 
that only really cool people were allowed to get on it.  But my friends 
and I sneaked aboard.

It was cosy inside and there were some people handing around a 
a bottle of wine.  We settled in for a while and started 
chatting with the bus-people.  They did not seem stuck up and showed no 
sign of getting ready to kick us off the bus.  We started to relax.  

Then this incredibly freaky and annoying man started to go off about an acid 
trip he had at Burning Man.  This guy just went on and on and on.  He
was manic- he was out of control.  He resisted all attempts at changing 
the subject.  Pretty soon, the bus was empty and that was the end of my 
encounter with the bus and its passengers.

At Burning Man I hear that THE camp to be at was the WBLights RV circle, 
covered by a now legendary parachute.

	He stopped mixing about 1/3 of the way through his set though I 
would not call what he was spinning gabber (not the first bit at least). 
And you should look for us people of United Systems instead of SPAZ

They had a cool set-up (gotta say the trampoline was a nice touch), but
really that only furthers the elitist mentality.

Being at Burning Man was legendary.  No matter where your camp was, whether
it was at WBL, Wicked, F-8, ravers camp, main camp, Rhea and T-Fred's car,
our rental van, the Syntonic Circle, at the mud baths, the outrageous car
park, alone on the playa, or somewhere under that amazing double rainbow,
it was an incredible experience.

I never stated there was a "private" encampment. Just that the wicked 
crew set up camp away from everyone else. This in and of itself is not 
something a group should be dissed for. It's certainly a free country and 
everyone should camp where they want. 

However, this was combined with previous negative experiences surrounding 
Wicked including seeing a member of another production company(a very 
nice and caring person) in tears at Burning Man because they attempted to
bring the various sound systems together and were rejected by the Wicked crew 
for reasons of petty ego. There are other reasons and incidents including 
the whole FMR thing, but it is not my wish to air other peoples' dirty laundry
here. They can speak for themselves if they wish.

I do not make baseless assertations.  

Since you are asking me to do something reasonable, I ask you to do the 
same. In the future, consider the possibility that although your 
perception of a person/event/thing differs from that of another, that 
that person is not wrong because their perception or experience differs 
from yours.

Dear All;

        It was like trying to pull teeth, but I managed to get them to
release the price of tonights party, considering at 8:30pm, the final
message on the tape still did not include the price of tonights admission,
sad. Approximately $15 - $20, see ya there. 

        Does anyone know if the party 1434 Howard is 21+, or 18+, or all ages?

Hey all: 
Yes I did, sometime this afternoon.. it felt like the old warehouse 
building that I was in (SoMa), was feeling a bit of its age.  I remember 
hearing a creak on one end of the office, but not really that much of 
movement. The person next to me said, "Did you feel *that*!?", his eyes 
really big and scary.  To me, someone was just re-adjusting the ceiling or 
something. Intereseting, but not as exciting as it could have been!

cheers,
mrfrog

Whats this I hear about a quake. I'm up in British Columbia and can't feel
the shake up this far. I also can't decipher the chart Brian mailed. How
many of you felt it, hands please. Does anyone know the exact magnitude??
One more question, what production crew throws Burning Man and was it the
first, this last summer I mean. I won't miss it this summer, sounds like an
experiance worth experiancing. Take care all and dont let Mother Nature
scare you too much, she just needs to remind us that she runs this show.

Umm, Hmmm, well I was at Tribal Future, (and I guess I could be considered
part of the Wicked Crew) but as far as that party was concerned, Wicked 
as a group or posse or Crew did not attend, the Wicked sound system was used
and the Engineering crew that goes out with it was definitely there, 
Garth was there (not as "Wicked" but as Garth) and I guess some people who
regularly attend Wicked parties were there as well, I forgot my sleeping
bag and didn't even set up camp, I know garth set his camp up on the "hill"
but maybe he wanted a little privacy :)  I think you are mistaking people
who have been partying together for several years as some sort of elitism,
there are people who I see at parties that I have been seeing for over
4 years, I don't even know there names some of them but to me they are like
family because they have been there when I had some truly wonderful
experiences,  there is a level of trust and a bond that you develop
with people that you have strong experiences with.  You kinda know they
will look out for you and you for them, it's almost an unspoken thing, but
you et them use your tent or hang out in your van because you know they will
watch out for your stuff when your not there (as if it was their own)
I guess the word is Family (some of you remember when we used to refer to
the entire Scene as The Family)  In any event maybe the vibe you are feeling
has something to do with the fact that you are not a familiar face and 
people don't know you, I'm aware of the rockstar energy that you are talking
about and I must say that for them most part, it is energy that people
PROJECT on the Wicked DJs.  Iv've known them all for a few years and some
of them I've become good very good friends with and I must sy that of all
of the DJs around they seem to be primarily concerned with playing their
music and throwing their parties.  They are human, they are not angels 
(nor are they devils as some would have you believe) they are just people 
with the same quirks, and failings and amazing qualities as you and me.
THe major difference is that they take what they are doing seriously,
they are professional DJs, that is what they do, and how they make their 
livelyhood, they are also having a great-time doing it.  (It seems that
in our culture if someone is following their dream and they are happy and
are making ends meet financialy, someone will have a problem with it)

Umm I'm just going to be blunt here, frankly you don't know what the fuck 
your talking about.  The person who had that idea may have been coming 
from a good place but they definitely were not a sound engineer and 
frankly they haven't been throwing parties long enough to see the full
ramifications of their "good ideas".  Not all at burningman was sweetness and
"Light" but there wasn't any greater or lesser battle of egos then there is
at any event, with 400 square miles of space, a solution existed and was
found that seemed to make all of the owners of the respective sound systems
happy.  Maybe that person's agenda was not satisfied but then they have a 
whole year to plan for it this time, instead of trying to instantiate
a dream at the last moment with no logistics or planning.

The bottom line at Burning Man is that the Wicked Crew was there to deliver
The Music,  it is a passion for them,  they may choose to work with or
without other groups based on their perception of whether those groups
have the same passion and logistical tenacity, (in full moons past,
we have done everything from playing in full on rain showers to facing
a hoard of riot police with dogs and clubs and guns).  One of my
most amazing memories at Burning Man was to see this desert rains storm
come up on Saturday night while Garth was playing and THE PARTY CONTINUED,
some attendants (and it wasn't someone that I think you would consider
part of the elite possee:) materialized some tarps and shielded Garth
and turntables from the wind and rain so that he could keep playing 
(which he did!) With thunder and lightning all around.  Maybe it is that
bond that is between Wicked party-goers and the producers that seems to
either enthral or piss-off certain people.  In March wicked will have 
been throwing parties in San Francisco for 5 years, there aren't many 
promoters around who have been here that long, the only ones that I can
think of is Choice (Gathering, Vision), Funky Techno Tribe and of course
Preston, when you've been doing it that long, you know what works and most
of all what doesn't work (because you have been down that path before)
It is very important to us that the party go off and that they are 
consistant,  in the current climate in SF it is VERY difficult to
have a consistant good quality outside of the Club VEnue, this sucks 
frankly but ask yourself or others when was the last time that a Wicked 
didn't happen or when people didn't get a full night of music and dancing 
for their money.

WE take our Music seriously.

Consider Black Adder that I have known many of the people about which you 
speak for several years, consider also that I have seen many people come
around Wicked hang out and leave, either disgruntled or just fade away,
in 90% of the cases, they projected some for of demigod status on one of 
the members and were disappointed when the person didn't live up to the 
image that they had decided to set for them.  Fortunately the Wicked DJs
are not rockstars and don't desire to be, maybe other people that hang 
around them might want to turn them into that because they want the 
presteige of being with "the boys in the band" but that is thier problem,
I have seen for myself that these guys (as much as is possible for any
object of hero worship) have shunned this type of attention, usually the 
person giving it either steps it up or goes away mad, The Boys simply 
continue to play records, THAT is what they are about.

What's wrong with a little diversity at a party?  It really bugs me when
people who supposedly spout PLUR and all that shit complain because
of how a person is dressed (or maybe how dark their skin might happen to be,
face it is seems that the gangster shit is mostly projected on people of 
color).  As long as the person is civil and is there to be under
one House what does it matter?  I've seen the Vibe at Wicked's break down
the most seriously frontin homeboy.

Dude, what the fuck are you talking about?
A couple people rented RVs (I almost did with jsl @ niels until I punked 
out right john :) For the most part, an RV is your home away from home,
you put your food and your valuables in there, I didn't see any invitations
or anything like that although if people didn't recognize you they might
watch you a little, I think you have a serious inferiority complex
when it come to "Wicked" and you really shouldn't why many of the wicked
posse can't even spell :)

The person who owns the bus  more or less lives on the bus with his ol' 
lady.  How would you feel if someone just walked into your living room?
Now obviously if you choose to transport you abode into the middle of a 
rave you need to make some adjustments but bear in mind that there is 
nothing going on here any more than someone looking out for their own 
space, I'm sure if you are open with a warm heart you will be accepted
(a little ganja never hurts either :)

Ah ha, you just had an encounter with Mad Mark, indeed he did have
an amazing trip at burning man (as I was there to witness his transformation
and subsequent beguilement of Garth)  He is relatively harmless but
QUITE a charecter.


You guys have to realize that some of this bunch have been partying with
eachother for years, maybe that is what you feel.  To them, the Scene
(for good or ill) is not just an adventure but a way of life :)

Geoff, I am not here to get in a pissing match with you. You are sticking 
up for your friends, cool. However, I can just as easily say that you 
don't know what the fuck you are talking about. Does that get us anywhere?

To reiterate: It is not my place to air other peoples' problems with 
members of wicked. I have neither the time, the desire, nor do I really 
care. My original post included both good experiences and bad that I had 
at wicked. Two of the best parties I have ever been to were FMR's.Of course 
someone chose to focus on the negative statements I made and this whole 
thing gets blown out of proportion.

If you wish to continue lecturing me on what I do and do not know, please 
do so privately so I can direct your posts to their appropriate place.

That's the one thing that scares the shit out of me about San Francisco - 
the Earthquakes!  I'm counting the days that I can move out of Sacramento 
and into the City, yet every single time I'm driving over the Bay Bridge 
I say to myself, "god, please don't let there be one NOW!"   I also got a 
bit nervous while in that warehouse that Family and F&F was held in.  
There was a warning on the door before you went inside that said 
soemthing to the effect of, "this building is earthquake condemned, 
enter at your own risk."   I'm scared about it, but what can you do?  
Absolutely nothing.  I've decided to just live it up until *that day* 
arrives.  

love,
Amy

Yea, I knew James had a release on Visible called "Gifts ov Alien 
Technology", as well as various remixes. I just wanted to see what he's 
been up to. I've only talked to him once on the phone since he's moved 
there, and since I don't believe that he's "wired" I can contact him via 
the net which is my main form of communication with out-of-state friends. 
One of the reasons I was asking is because I wanted to do an interview 
with him for an online zine that a friend and I maintain called "digital 
karma". Pass it on!

Oh....geeez, James is a friend of mine. (We're both from Oklhaoma) And I 
honestly cannot judge his DJing skills, because I havn't heard one of his 
sets in long time. However, His production skills are fucking RIGHT ON. 
Not to mention that he works tirelessly to make things happen on a 
regular basis. Before he split to SF from OK he was responsable for one of 
the most incredible parties for the boming victims. He pulled Underground 
Resistance, some very hyped DJ's from the Hard Sync crew in Dallas not to 
mention the numerious sponsors who funded the whole thing. Also, from 
what I understand, "Jack" had something to do with Joey Beltram putting 
out an Ambiet CD on Visible Records. JOEY BELTRAM......doing ambient! 
James has all of my respect.

hello all-

i went to xntrk last night, and found it to be a rather cool experience.  i
got to meet wayne, ricki, and tim (sfravers) there, and, once again, felt
rather connected to the scene that i had left for a semester.  hope to see
you all at gathering!
at first, xntrk had more of a club feel, with the normal groups of men in
circles watching one person dance and try to impress women, and with huge
numbers of people that i'm sure must have slipped the guards something to
let them in, despite the 18+ rule.  that was during carlos's set.
when tony came on, WOW! the atmosphere changed.  with the change from heavy
house to somewhat trance-like stuff, the dance floor was transformed into
what i had remembered from past raves: a bunch of people dancing without
trying to impress each other.  i was much happier.
lights were cool, but nothing too phat.  visuals were boring, with the
now-expected clips from the 1950's sub-conscious that have become so "retro
and alternative!"  it shut down at 3:45, for some reason, and they were
quite unkind about it.  i wish it could have gone on for longer, but hey, i
had a blast.
i would recomend parties by these people more, except for the steep price
tag and the unavability of water (except for $2 a bottle!!}  they need more
visuals, and to get a larger chill space, it was rather crouded.
THE FRUIT WAS A GREAT IDEA!  free fruit was given out around 2:30, a perfect
suplement to my alrEady vitamin dEfEciEnt body.

that is the review of XNTRK.  IF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN PSYCHOLOGY NOR THE
PERSONAL JOURNEY OF RAVERS, READ NO FURTHER.  MATT


if you do have interest in my story at XNTRK, read on, for it is a HAPPY one.

for the past 3 months, i have been suffering from an incredible depression
from a number of factors: bad living arrangements, bad relationship with
some friends, removal from a choir that i loved, you know, all factors that,
alone, might not phase you, but together, can drive you crazy, as i have
been.  thus, i have not been to a rave for 3 months, because i haven't been
able to make it to one, and because i didn't feel i had the energy to do so.
life was not a bowl of cherries.

so, last night, my girlfriend tells me "Matt, you must go to a rave.  you
hate living without raves, so GO!! NOW!"  so, i did.  i got there, (insert
review from above).  I was sober for the first while, feeling afraid to do
anything for fear of what my emotional state would do.  but then, i decided,
this rave is going to be a turning point in my life, in some way: tonite,
either i'm going to go crazy and lose it totally, or i'm going to begin to
enjoy life and LIVE again!  i thought about it, and decided that i trusted
where i was enough to give it a try.  so i did givE it a try.  I thought,
I'm going to trust myself to have the right reaction, and i'm gonna trust
the people around here to help me take care of myself.

just as i was starting to peak and getting to that "I need to be with
someone NOW" phase (i don't know if other people go through that, but i
definitely do) i went to sit in the chill room.  now, normally, i don't just
walk up and talk to people, but there was a group of people that just looked
inviting.  so i went up to them, offered some of my aroma-therapy (from the
body shop) and started hanging.  they were the coolest ravers i have met in
eons!  i told them i was alone and wanted to hang, and they told me to stay
with them, and we'd keep each other company.  that was the biggest gift i
had been given by anyone in a long time.  needless to say, at that point, my
whole mindset shifted from "life sucks" to "people can be cool if you let
them"  to "WOW!"  

so we hung, gave back rubs, and exchanged phone numbers and all that stuff.
if was a very healing experience.  they would not let me go anywhere without
making sure that i came back to be with them more.  it was just what i needed.

so, to clare, a 17-year old brit, thanks for making my night.  and to josh,
a typical 20-something, thanks too.

thanks for listening to my story.  now i remember why i rave.  because i
love people, i love life, and i love myself.


peace, love, and utter happiness-

matt

  If you are 21, I think that Wicked will be pretty awesome tonight...
  They are going to be having two guests, Roger S. and our very own
  Andrew (Astral Matrix).  Andrew will be doing a live performance of 
  his music..  If you missed him at the last Friends and Family this would 
  be and excellent opportunity to check him out...
  
  Maybe we'll see you there........

  Peace!  THE AMEBAS

O.K. I knew this would happen, that's why I was frettin' putting out that
post.  To make it short, there was some talk of changing the SPAZ name
to United Systems, but some of us felt that ALOT of hard work was put
into making SPAZ as a name and concept, so why should it change?
Let me state that I believe in the United Systems concept and for it to
happen their has to be MORE then one sound system involved (united is
a grouping of something isn't it?)  Basically we felt you can't call
something United Systems and keep having Aaron bring his soundsystem
ALL the time - that guy does so much for the scene and he seems to get
no respect, except from his mates of course. 
 O.K. I really don't want to stir anymore dirt up ALLEN :)
so, I'll put in a blurp for my web page - Shakti Science, which will
cover my label (1st release - Space Farm - Egyptology VOL. 1), SPAZ
Shakti Science and Planet 6 studio, sound files, etc.  I'm even thinking
of uploading the diary I wrote when me, Aarron, Jen, Jake (Subtropic),
Danya, and Lisa (Aarron's sister) traveled from New York to San Francisco
in fall of 1992.  I do remember some pages mentioning the Charter Oak
parties, 1st TAZ party, general collective mayem!  You want to see dirt...  :)


peace out

I've read both Black Adder and Geoff White's sides of the story and both 
have valid points.  
I agree with Geoff in that it is the people that project the "rock star" 
image onto the dj's - however I think that some of these dj's project an 
attitude that perpetuates that image.  Let me explain myself:
Right off the top of my head I can think of 2 big name dj's that do not 
have that unappoachableness about them:  Carlos and Tony.  Know why?  
Because they come out and join us ravers in dancing before or after their 
set. They "become one of us" so to speak.  Carlos is always so 
enthusiastic about the music and he cheers and really gets into it.  He 
smiles at people and is very open and friendly to anyone who comes up to 
talk to him.  Tony is just plain sweet - he's out there dancing with the 
rest of us and you go up and talk to him and he greets you with a hug or 
a hand shake.  

Now I have *YET* to see Garth or Spun out there dancing with the rest of 
us.  I always see them on the side having some serious conversation or 
looking solomn.  Just their aura about them is rather intimidating.  This 
is purely *my* perception, for I'm sure that it is not that way with 
other people.  I feel much more at ease with *anybody* - dj or no dj - 
that is smiling and looking like they are having a good time.  This may 
just be Garth or Spun's personalities - and there is nothing wrong with 
that - but I can see how their aloofness along with their high demand at 
different venues could cause many people to think they are on a rock star 
trip.  And of course it is not *their* problem that people think that way 
about them - I don't *dislike* them for being that way, I could just 
never go up and talk to them.  I just listen to the music they spin, 
dance, have a great time, and socialize with the many other people there 
who have more inviting personalities!  Long live diversity.....

love,
Amy

That's funny, because off the top of my head I can come up with at least 
4 times in the last year , the Flowerchild before last, the free 
Gathering at City Hall, the Chemical Bros. show at the Troc., & the 
last Sunset at Richmond, where there were Garth sightings of the man 
doing anything from standing around with a stack of Wicked flyers, to 
talking to somebody, to swaying from side to side, to rocking out in the 
company of mixed people. From what I've seen it looks like familar and 
unfamilar people have aproached him at times, and there always seems to 
be at least one pack of goonies present who'll shout out a "Norm" -isk 
battle cry / greating from afar.  

Yeah, I know it's rude to stare, and No, I'm not stalking the guy. It's 
just that each time I witness one of these incidents it reminds me of 
long distance letters & conversations I had with friends ((the majority of 
whom are presentlly in the dry cycle in terms raving)) who mentioned 
similar moments, that of breakdancing or something next to Garth, as one 
of the better moments of their night. You can file that memory under 
Naive Hero-Worship or Working Class Unity or whatever, but at the time it 
served as a huge ego-boost for a lot of people. I'd venture to say that 
effect still happens today.

I know of a few people that have developed some kind of personal bond 
with Garth in particular. They measure their lives in terms of how far 
they've developed between each of their experiences and the earliest of 
their benchmarks starts at a time when Garth was sporting that poffy afro 
to the nappy dreads that he has today. It's kind of like the same 
emotional attachment you get from watching Gary Collman grow up in front 
of you and every now and then you just get the urge to go up Garth and 
give the guy a donut or something.

I've seen Garth do his walking dance.  I've seen Jeno smile before.  They 
are cool in my book.  Plus, Jeno's sets seem to rip my brain open lately. 
I also really want to check out Roger Sanchez.   I am going to Wicked.  
Hope to meet some of you there!!!

Cheers****
Cami

Well, I'm glad to know that I was wrong about him! :)
Like I said, this was all from my perspective only, and I want to 
reiderate that I didn't think of my post as "Truth"....just what I've 
observed in the past. :)

Amy, I have to say you are dead wrong about these guys. Jason (Spun) is 
the most down to earth DJ I've met & three years ago Garth used to be the 
hardest dancing guy at most parties. I'm sure most people would have a 
hard time dancing at parties if there were all these freaks staring at 
and whispering about you. I mean if poor Jeno started going off, half the 
people on the dancefloor would stop to look. What a bunch of freaks :)

Hi!

I am going to Banco De Gaia tonite and then onward (around Midnight?) to
Wicked to dance the night away!

I'm 6'6" tall, have long hair in a pony tail and will be wearing my SF
Raves laminate around my neck! I may even be wearing a goofy shirt (alien
related?) but not yet sure. Come say hi!

WAIT!!!! I don't know any of the "systems" involved, but I know that 
friction between production crews results in nothing but bad energy. I 
think that before anyone starts saying anything that we should remember 
one thing: Everyone who's involved in electronic music culture is a part 
of the biggest evolution that music has ever seen. Personal prefrences 
and interpersonal conflicts aside, all of us are a part of something much 
BIGGER than we are. We're world wide, fast-forward, technologically 
inhanced humans moving toward the end of the millennium. And most of us 
really understand what's going on.

yes you could except I sawe the entire drama unfold before me including
having a conversation with the person who later wound up in tears,
the events had been sorted out weeks before at the burning man planning
meeting (which this person for whatever reason didn't attend, even though
I'm sure she knew about it. It was simply an issue of poor planning on her
part, if she had been there from the beginning she could have saved herself
a lot of pain.

hey guys (and i am not pointing any fingers - i am just responding after 
i can't take it anymore) - the point of this thing should not be to dis 
this party or that party.  it should be to share information and network 
about parties and sounds.  when too many people say too many nasty 
things, this just takes away the whole point of a "rave" group.  whether 
or not we agree on sounds or styles, we should at least know (i hope) that 
we all want the same results - to dance and to spread happiness.  who 
cares about the politics...

Kevin,

What a great post.  I'm really sick of all the bashing.  I love BOTH Wicked 
and SPAZ and I had the best time ever at Burning Man.  I'll be coming to 
The Gathering on the 16th and was hoping to meet some of you......but, 
the energy I'm getting from some on this group is so negative.  Not sure 
if I want to meet anyone! I'll keep reading for now, but let's cool it folks. 
I'm all for freedom of opinion, but maybe some of the heavier debates 
could go through personal mail. Isn't this supposed to  be a fun and 
informative newsgroup?

Marty

Friends,

Tell me all about it!  I'm sitting here in Fresno just WISHING I was at the 
Wicked party tonight.  It's torture not being there, but I'm saving my 
next trip for The Gathering.  Hope it will be worth it.

If you have any details to share, I'd love to read them.

Thinking of You, 
Marty

ps: What does this SF Laminate look like so I might be able to find 
someone at my next event?  Is there a web site that shows it?

Actually, I know both Garth and Spun a bit and neither of them is 
at all stuck-up or unfriendly as Amy may have thought.  If anything,
both of them are more approachable than other people I know around
the circuit.  Tony's always been friendly, I think in part he has
had to work against the fact that when he first moved here he was
unknown and didn't have a support network to fall back on, but 
he also just seems to like being in the thick of things.  As for
Carlos, well, the man's a force of nature :)

Now Garth more or less started as a dancefloor punter like all of us,
and I've seen him kick up the dust many times when the time is right.
And Spun is a very perceptive and talkative guy too.  

Being a bit of a DJ myself, I can put myself in the shoes of those
we've known and admired.  I think with some exceptions DJs generally
are not rockstar types at all.  Certainly Djs like attention and respect,
and no DJ I know objects if someone just comes up to chat, the only
things that seem to miss the mark are people who either want to do a
little DJ adulation or else are picking an argument, and I've seen DJs
clam up immediately when people approached them that way.  

As Geoff said, for the most part you'll discover that DJs are basically
just the same as the rest of us, with all the ups and downs that offers.
Neither saints nor demons . . .

Hello cyberfolk,

I couldn't decide on either the Troc nor Focus so I gave Wicked a whirl.

I figured out a few things through the experiance...

First: NEVER dance on a hard wood floor w/china flats on. my shoes just a
kept flying off leavin' me to dance away in my tosties...

Second: Wicked, IMOP (in my own perception), still seems a tad bit clubish
for my tastes.  Although I Love House (after all, house is where the heart
is), I saw the typical clubish 'tude being sported from a good portion of the
crowd.  I also got a few weird looks cuz of me dancin' in my tosties....

Finally: Although the tunes were decent the feedback was, well, in a word:
 Yecch.

Overall I really had a good time.  Saw a few of ya'll out there.  The $15
wasn't a big pinch from the pocketbook considering it's in support of the
scene an all. 
For all of you who might of seem me I was the guy in the black jeans, white T
shirt, Brasil cap, and Purple Long sleeve tied around my neck (don't forget
the tosties...)


=) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =)Smile'O'meter=) =) =) =) =) =) =) =)=)
=) =) =) =) 

Music:  8.5 Smiles (it got me groovin)

Vibe:    8 Smiles (lotsa vibey peoples that i watched fer a bit)

Dancing media:  9 Smiles (woulda been great if I had my white soez on)

Smiles and Hugz: 7.5 Smiles (A lil' clubby)

Overall: A strong 8.25 Fun fun fun....


In closing.  I actually enjoied reading the "Tribal Funk war" posties...  It
really goes to show how everything is really just how we each percieve things
soo differently (almost as differently as I spell things, ha ha).  Even Amy
with her Wicked posts. No one is immune to this....affliction? Blessing? 
This lil review is just sensless drivel to some("Blech, Adam never gives an
overall review that's under seven"),  To others it's an indicator ("oh, WOW,
we gotta check thiz out next time...").
but, if you take it for what it's worth...it's just words. An opinion. Im not
Siskel or Ebert.  Im not getting PAID to write these... Im just a guy that
goes to raves (picking up stray ravers here and there), dances his ass off
till he hobles his way home in the morning.  And writes what he thought about
it...  I don't go into much detail cos, well, there others that will do that
for ya...

Have a GR-R-R-R-R-R-EAT week (if it's anything like mine remember: We are
just a means to an end, which dosen't end but merges to something much bigger
than this exsistence we all call life.  What does that mean... I dunno (well
I do really.  But I wouldn't want to spoil it so you go fig.),


Spins,

Adam

Just wanted to let people know that EBN was definitely great (what a
trip!), and Banco was even better. They were both at the troc last nite...
the dude who is Banco de Gaia had rhythm coming out his pores, seemed to
infect everything; mind and soul uber alles! Awesome show.. Nothing like 
hand-woven, hand-crafted VIBE, straight from the tips of the fingers...

I would just like to take this moment to apologize for the recent flame 
war which hopefully most of you ignored. 

I still feel the way I feel. A hint to all: Telling someone "they don't 
know what the fuck they are talking about", does not generally endear 
them to your point of view.

It always facinates me how people can focus on one negative aspect of an 
otherwise neutral/positive post, get bent out of shape, and the fur just 
starts flying. 

I am sure most of you don't care. DON'T! It is all a bunch of bullshit 
anyways, and will suck the energy right out of you if you let it(I'm 
learning) :)

Have a *GREAT* Day

                                            Black Adder

dear black adder ( and all )-
i successfully ignored most of the recent personal slamming that has
occureded on sfraves.  could it have occured by private e-mail?  some
arguements that i have gotten in over sfraves i have continued, quite
vivaciously, over my private e-mail.  just a suggestion, that could benefit
us all.

yes, arguing is a needed part of life, for we would explode if all we did
was sig around the fire and sing happy songs.  but disgression is needed at
times to protect the innocent.

peace, love, and arguments-

matt

Hey, thanks for posting this. I was reading the whole Wicked debate last
night and rolling my eyes. That comment about them being superstars may have
been "innocent", but what kind of a thing is that to post on a public list?
It's a bunch of gossip and hearsay. Wicked always throws a good party-that's
all I care about. 

Let me share a story with you all. When I first subscribed to  sfraves, a
friend of mine (who once subscribed, then cancelled) said to me, "You don't
want to get involved with those people. They're a bunch of whiners." When I
pressed him further for details, he said "Oh, they whine about the music,
they whine about the parties, they whine about the dj's, they're never happy
with anything." I didn't see it at first, but I am starting to. 

I have my sfraves laminate, but I haven't been wearing it. That in itself
should tell you what my mixed feelings are about our little group. I would
like to suggest that before we start posting gossipy crap, we should sit down
and think "Who is going to read this?" and "What kind of impression is this
going to make?" I am all too aware that there are plenty of legitimate gripes
about the scene. I feel It's OK to post a few critical comments about a party
you didn't like. A rave review, which encompasses the positive and negative
comments about a party is fine w/ me (like the one Adma just wrote). But
let's try to keep the bitchy comments to ourselves, shall we? 
Happy to just be alive,
MsPhink

ive gotta disagree with you on that one...i don't want to belong to a list
where everyone censors their comments according to what impression they are
going to make...its not a bad thing to have a discussion and disagree, in
fact, it gets people thinking about what the hell is going on...so...i
don't think people have to resort to mean comments, but at the same
time..im certainly not going to tailor my comments for this list..i will
endure the flames thanks...
btw..i CAN see both sides of this..i have seen the wicked crew seeming like
they are rockstars, etc...but as a dj, i think people like to project this
image on to you and most dj's i know aren't necessarily that into going out
or dancing even though they like the music..usually, they are a bit quieter
than you're average raver-but most don't have an attitude if approached...
gotta put in my two cents i guess..but i hope it ends here

YAH! Best $8.00 ever spent.  Woulda gladly payed another $8.00 to hear
him spin for another hour. (That kinda musick shouldn't have to conform
to the usual "rock show" formats and timings.)

EBN was ok, IMHO, but to me their schtick is getting old hat. Cool boyz
with toyz nonetheless, but you migth get just as much out of one of
their videos as you would from their live performances. This is just my
feelings/taste so there's no point in flaming me for an opinion. (ha!).

Amazing crowd transformation from standing around observing a
"industrial" show versus people gettin' down and trance-grooving to B
de G.

Wickyhead woulda probably been better if all my raving needs hadn't
previously been fulfilled by Banco de Gaia. Wish they'd get out of 174
King Street and into some other location, and wish the security guards
weren't so keen on confiscating my hollow wooden implements of
blunting.... :-(

All in all, a good time was had but I didn't feel like sticking around
for the house to be built at wicked, because i've already seen the sky
after you blow the roof off.

When is the full moon rave? Surely Wicky_head are joking when they said
the last full moon rave for the year was last month's -- it's so nice
and warm out!!

Hi Josh, 
I'm actually glad to know that I am dead wrong - that is why I emphasized 
that it was purely *MY* perspective that I was making my claim.  I did 
not say that these wonderful dj's *were* that way, that is just how I 
felt. I feel intimidated by Garth, Spun, Jeno, and many others and I 
cannot go up and talk to them.  That is just ***ME*** and I can't help 
the way I feel.  I'm sure they are wonderful people, but for someone who 
is -believe it or not- sometimes quite shy, I can't just go up and start 
talking. Especially when they have umpteen million people clapping them 
on the back saying, "Wow, that was a great set!"  Maybe they get tired of 
hearing that out of everyone's mouth. I don't want to sound that way.  
I want to make it clear that I am *NOT* bashing these great dj's.  Spun's 
set at New Year's Eve '92/'93 was the first time in my life I **REALLY** 
danced hard core.  I love and respect all dj's, but just like the other 
people in the world, there are some that I feel intimidated by.  That's 
all I meant. :)     Will you be at the Gathering, Joshie?

love,
Amy

I'll be damned if this group is going to be painted as a bunch of whiners.

#1.  We've been there, paid our dues, done the do, etc.  We not only
     have a right to say what we think (and to disagree with each other
     and plenty), but we have a damn *good* right.

#2.  We do pretty well managing our disputes.  Over the years, I can
     only think of a couple of times when things got out of hand.
     That's a very good track record.

#3.  Certain people within the scene are very good at pointing out the
     supposed faults of others, in part to deflect attention from 
     themselves.  I've seen it, you may have too.  Enough said.

#4.  This is certainly no exclusive club.  Anyone with access to any
     old computer and email can participate.  If we are "whiners,"
     at least we do it out in the open which is more than I can say
     for some others.

Only my own $0.02.  Spend it well :)

I have been going to Wicked for a number of years (I'm embarassed to admit
how long), and know the people who are involved with the posse/party.

First I want to say that I have found them not to be stuck up.  If
anything, shy would be an appropriate description of how they act in
public.

Wicked has never tried to rip anyone off.  Wicked was the last party to
raise the cover to their party to $15.  This took them YEARS to do.  Wicked
gives back to the community in the form of FREE FMM's (Full Moon Massives).

Once you get to know them, the people involved with Wicked are genuinely
nice.  When I first got involved w/ the scene here in SF, there was a
Wicked clique, but the boys (i.e. the DJ's) really never got caught up in
that shit.  It was something that formed around them.  It happens to all
parties/crews if they last and gain a rep.  But Wicked itself is about
music, period.  Other people have other motives, but theirs remains true.

I don't understand the bs surrounding them.  It's actually funny.  I've
heard more DJ's and promoters talk shit about them, people who are
disgruntled over whatever talk about them, old-timers bust their balls etc.
Basically I've heard much more about them from others than the Wicked crew
themselves.  I have yet to hear ANY of the Wicked DJ's dis anyone publicly.
I doubt they really give a shit about anything other than their music.
Kinda takin' the high road on that one.  Admirable.  Especially considering
the shit-talkin' do nothings who foist thier exepctations upon them, and
when they don't live up to that external ideal, they are immediately
faulted.

Fact is, the celebrity is created by YOU, those who have nothing better to
do than talk about them.  Those who have nothing better to do than pass
judgements on people you know jack shit about (how many of you have sat
down with Markie, Jeno, Garth, Thomas, Neil, GeoffW, Stephanie, Monya, etc.
about what Wicked is all about?  I doubt many have.).  Sad.  What's even
more sad is the total lack of historical perspective, but this is a problem
exists in the national conscious as well, too big to go into here, suffice
it to say, some history would do well for many  on this list.

Muthafuckas put on a free party every month, and yet they STILL aren't
doing the right thing because they didn't dance next to you.  Muthfuckas
have kept thier prices reasonable for years, and yet you will hear cries of
$15 is too much.  Muthafuckas throw a consistently good party, and all you
hear are the moans and groans of physically challenged griping about them
using a smokey venue (one of the three they can use at ALL).  Muthfuckas
give you all a Wednesday party, and people gripe that it's on the same day
as another club.  Muthfukas buy a brand new trubosound system, and people
complain it's too loud, too soft, to trebbly, too whatever.  Complain,
complain, complain.  Just goes to prove, there will always be something.
With that in mind is it any wonder they have a give-a-shit attitude at
times (essential for underground parties, which BTW they've done their
share of here in the city), THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE COMPLAINING ABOUT
SOMETHING SO WHY BOTHER EXPLAINING YOURSELF?

Gripe, bitch, moan, groan, throw onto them all your expectations, continue
to judge w/o ever talking to any of them, bag, slag, bust balls
whatever...there will always be something not to like.

This PLUR shit spouted on this list is another artifact. Peace, Love,
Unity, Respect...maybe we need to add tolerance (severaly lacking here at
times), to that near-religious acronym.  Otherwise it ain't for shit.

Funny BS on the street:
Funny how some DJ's use to worship, even idolize the Wicked posse.  When
these folx found out how human the Wicked crew was, you heard all kinds of
verbal nastiness about them...from the same people who worshipped them a
few years ago.  It must be terrible to build up these mythic expectations
of a group of people, only to be let down by their humanity.  Oh, not to
worry, just blame them for failing to live up to your expectations.  What a
wack ass sorry punk bitch way to be.

Party:
Unlike others who merely wish to bring in new talent, Wicked did it again
by bringing in Roger S.  Good show, although the mix wasn't as tight as
Little Louie a few weeks back.  Jeno had his typical good set.  Roger S.
was fine, Astral Matrix was great, Garth did a nice intro for Roger S.
went home and talked about the lack of women at this particular Wicked with
some of my crew.  This Wicked seemd to be boys night out (witness the
thrall of men surrounding the decks this time), shirts were optional.

Near gripe:
Dear stinky people who really think it's ok not to take a bath for a few
days, take off your shirt, and start to sweat and dance at parties: please,
take a bath.  Next time I smell one of you, I will point it out in a most
direct manner.  I have enough olfactory assualt with the constant smoking
while dancing, weed, general humidity, and that stinky Wicked net, without
having to smell some dude/dudette who has the notion that bathing is a sin
against nature.  With that said, I KNOW nothing will come of this.  But I
had to say it anyway, for all the stinky people in the house.


To all the Wicked crew an posse, nice one.  To all do nothing,
back-stabbing, griping, bitching, moaning, groaning, detractors...bugger
off.

Out,
John

Hi everyone-
I was feeling a bit guilty about the last message I posted. I hope I didn't
hurt anyone's feelings. I guess I was in kind of a pissy mood.

I have a question: 
What is your favorite thing to do *after* a rave? Or what has been your most
memorable post-raving experience? I usually come home and listen to music
until I fall asleep. I also like reading comic books and other literature
that doesn't make me think too hard. Going to The End Up is also a fun
post-raving activity!! Anyone else???

 Usually , I'm hungry! I go eating at Sparky's if I'm in SF before other
restaurants are open. In the east bay , I eat at Mamma's Royal Cafe
for breakfast - I usually sleep in my truck until they open at 8AM.
On the coast , I eat at Zachary's after a FMR or some other beach/Santa
Cruz event.

 If I'm going to drive home straight afterwards, I have lots of coffee!
If not , I don't have caffiene with the meal - after the meal , I find
someplace to park and snooze for an hour or two. I like Ocean Beach as
a safe place to park and sleep in the morning.

Here's an interesting one.  You can drown from E!  Haven't heard that 
one before.  

-S


Forward:
Re: ECSTASY: ANOTHER UK DEATH!
A previous UK death was reported due to drinking 26 pints of water. To
die of drinking too much water is almost certainly due to compulsive
behaviour due to being scared about not drinking enough, and probably 
the
E numbing the warning discomfort that you would normally feel. You 
should
not worry about drinking too much water if you are aware of what you 
are
doing, or if any friends are looking after you. Its much more likely 
that
you will dehydrate by not drinking enough.

Hey

I did end up checking out VRave, actually, but I like the idea of doing 
channel #sfraves better.  VRave appears to have people from all over 
the world (from what was mentioned in the FAQ), and it was very 
difficult to get a word in edgewise, and to even get someone to respond 
to something I'd say.  Kind of a lack of the community feel I think 
everybody here's used to, since it's so big, so hence my like of the 
#sfraves channel idea.  Somebody should start it up!  What do you all 
think?

The channel wouldn't have to constantly be kept going.  It doesn't 
sound like a channel that would be "taken over" by somebody else, 
'cause only sfravers would be interested in it.  Maybe after 
particularly cool parties, people could come on the following day and 
yack about it, or people would just pop in to check it out upon 
occasion?  I don't know, I just think it would be cool to be able to 
talk "real time" to the sfravers sometimes, in addition to fast & 
furious flying emails!

Went with two friends who wanted to see EBN and didn't care about BdG
(thought it would be too ambient), and left the show talking only about how
great BdG was. I think _that_ is a great compliment.

And hats off to the dude running the lights. The lights became part of the
music and vibe - he was playing them like an instrument.

The whole show was great with the exception of the stupid video crew taping
EBN with a LIGHT ON THEIR CAMERA! Not only did they ruin the projections
and blind many of us, but they annoyed EBN as well.

EBN was really cool overall, and I'm glad I saw them.  I wasn't into thier
music at all, and would probably never listen to thier cd, but thier whole
show was multimedia, and totally sinc'd up.  It made for a really cool
effect, I just wish they played music I was into.  Wouldn't pay to see them
again though, but am glad to have seen them once.

Now Banco de Gaia......whoaaaa.....let me tell ya......definately one of the
top three shows of my life.  It was neat to see the room transform from this
hard core industrial, dark, harsh, sreaming pit, to a totally spacious,
colorful, beautiful space.  It honestly felt like the room got bigger when
he came on.  Great light show.  I achieved probably one of the highest
*sober* states of consciousness that I have ever been to, and felt high as a
kite.  It was definately better than any drug experience I've had.  *Much*
respect goes out to him.

I'm psyched someone asked this, and the timing couldn't be more appropo.
Personally, after 8 hours or more of dancing and very loud music, I tend
not to focus on what music to listen to, but rather how to gently land my
heart, mind and soul back down to earth from it's ethereal orbit.  What I
have found is this concoction of a soft landing pad:

Soft music (jazz, ambient) on the car ride home.
Get home, don't wake up roommates. (They may hold is against you and do all
the dishes in the house when they get up.)
Check messages.
Put down a handful of vitamins with some juice.
Put on soft music in bathroom.
Run bath, add lots of aromatherapy relaxing bath oil (Body Shop, or not)
Soak in bath with lover (if one is available) for at least 20 minutes.
Get out of bath and wrap yourself (and your lover), in terry cloth.
Go into room, close shades tight.
Lay down, and give eachother (or yourself, if that's the way it goes) a
foot massage for at least 10 minutes on each foot.
Snuggle (or not) and crash until an hour before Simpsons, make dinner and
eat it watching Simpsons, then back to bed.

There you have it!

Other options?  Go to your friend Gerrard's place and soak in his hot tub
with Brian McGonigle and a couple of beers, listening to the fresh BIOJeff
tape from the night before.

Either way, hot water is crucial.

Peace ya'll!

Tony

P.S.  Burning Man option:  Drive 80 MPH across the playa on any misc.
vector heading South (?) toward the hot springs, park, strip, and walk
headlong into the soft, hot mud.  Cover yourself in the grey slightly
sulfer smelling ooze and lay on the ground while the sun dries your caked
skin, making wierd patterns in varoious shades of grey on your skin.  Sip
margarittas if you brought them.  Back in the water for a soak, then back
to the camp for a nice steaming cup of mushroom tea and a happy hardcore
brownie.  ;^)  Take a nap, get up, walk over to each camp and tip your hat
to everyone you see, thank the promoters, visit the WBL camp, bounce on the
trampoline for a bit, and let them paint your naked body.  Marvel at the
beauty of everything and everyone and then go dance until it starts to rain
and dance some more building huge platforms of mud on the botom of your
shoes.

     Hyperreal runs a chat system that was ostensibly set up for 
     net-ravers.  People from all over the world log into it, but 
     suprisingly few from the San Francisco area (although this number is 
     growing).
     
     Granted, it's not always so wonderful there -- jerks abound, just like 
     on IRC, but maybe an influx of people who really are into raving and 
     the net would help.  To get to it, type
     
        telnet hyperreal.com 7283
     
     The 7283 is incredibly important, it won't work without it.  To 
     remember this number, notice that "7283" spells "rave" on a telephone 
     keypad.
     
     If you've never been there before, type 
     
        new
     
     at the login prompt, and answer the questions.  If you have any 
     problems, email vrave@hyperreal.com and Bella and/or Andrew, the 
     administrators, should get you straightened out.

I definately consider tolerance to be a form of respect.  Sort of like when 
someone says "I don't agree with you, but I respect your opinion" -- 
they're *tolerating* that person's opinion, too.

Actually, now that I've thought a bit more, tolerance is a combination of 
peace and respect:  respect for someone else's ideas, and a peaceful 
attitude toward something that one may not like or agree with.  
Furthermore, people can be tolerant of each other in the spirit of unity, 
and/or because they want to spread love rather than argue/make someone feel 
bad about something.

So, to me, tolerance is one of the things that you find/achieve/express as 
a result of acting with peace, love, unity, and respect.

Vrave supports named channels.  Move to another channel via the /c command,
and then use the /N command to name the channel "sfraves hangout and party
planning" or whatever it is you want.

And as for community, there is a VERY strong community attached to vrave.  
It's more global in feel, that's true, but there are people that travel all 
over the US and even the world to visit and meet each other, and groups of 
people that have started and maintained both virtual and off-line 
friendships that have gone on for years.  In some ways it seems a bit 
fanatical :-)

Channel 01 on vrave is a zoo, that's for sure:  for some reason people hang 
on that channel and never get off, and it's difficult to get into the 
chaotic conversation.  That's why that channel is called "The Madhouse." 
But 98 other channels are available, and there's nothing stopping people 
from colonizing other areas.


One thing I vastly dislike about IRC is that every time I've tried to get 
into the #rave channel, the channel op locks it.  I don't understand what 
this person has against me, because I've never actually been able to get 
into #rave long enough to talk to anyone except for once, and that one time 
I couldn't tell if anyone could see what I was typing, even though there 
were only 4 other people on.  It was extremely frustrating.  Every time I 
tried after that I'd get a message saying the channel was locked and I 
needed an invitation to get in.  Talk about elitism.

Well I'll steer well clear of the bulk of this rant, however, I must take
exception here.

After nearly a two year break I finally returned to Wicked on saturday
night  and the shit was:

                          WAY TOO FUCKING LOUD.

Even with ear plugs my ears are still ringing and HURTING two days later.

Personally, I'm a little freaked about it... my hearing is getting fucked
and it pisses me off that people don't take this shit seriously; there is
NO REASON to subject people to that kind of damage. I did everything I
could to escape it... I moved back as far as I could, off to the side as
far as I could, upstairs etc., and finally, in pain I left.

This is a real concern (or should be) to everyone in this scene John, and
you calling people concerned about their damaged hearing "complainers"
doesn't do anyone any good, in fact, I suggest it does just the opposite.

This (sfr) has been and *should be* a forum for people to communicate their
concerns about the environments they encounter at parties to the people
throwing the parties, it's called feedback.

In all relations feedback is essential process and, IMO, your efforts at
intimidating and namecalling people into silence diminish the value of this
forum, so bugger off yourself.

Not to mention the fact that I know what compressed distortion sounds like:
DOGSHIT, and I heard plenty of it the other night.

So, to all the Wicked crew an posse: turn it down, *please*, you'll sound
better and we'll hear longer.

take it easy

     (Old raving fart mode on)
     
     I remember going to little warehouse parties in Providence, Rhode 
     Island, back in 1992...EBN would do lights/visuals.  Their basic style 
     was the same as they are doing today:  lots of sampling from the 
     media, especially the news.  Except back then they were really into 
     George Bush (well, he was president, so of course).
     
     (Old raving fart mode off)
     
     So anyway, the visual part of the EBN show was great -- they've 
     evolved their basic quick-cut and paste method to use better graphics, 
     and better technical technique.  I guess that's because they've got 
     more money for better production equipment.  However, it didn't seem 
     all that different from what I remember in Providence...media 
     overload, violence, quotes from political figures, bits of sex.  I 
     enjoyed the show, don't get me wrong.  The thing that was different 
     from their old material is that they are now a full-production show, 
     and not just visuals at someone's rave.  Therefore, they had their 
     music, patter, and lighting to add to the mix.  That's what made it 
     interesting to me:  the added dimensions.  The spoken bits and EBN 
     "bumpers" really demonstrated their sense of humor, too.
     
     I wasn't too thrilled by EBN's music, but if the show is taken as a 
     whole (and it should be) it was cool.
     
     Banco de Gaia made me very happy.  Techno/ambient acts live usually 
     leave me with a "well, I could have heard this at home" feeling, but 
     the lights really made the show work.  
     
     As Niels said, it was the best $8 I'd spent in a long time.

Ear damage should be a real concern for all those involved in this scene.  I
started wondering about mine last year, and made an appointment with my
doctor for a hearing test just to see.  The test noted that I have sustained
some damage to both ears.  My hearing hasn't dropped below normal levels,
but in the frequency range that includes the kinds of sounds heard at a
rave, one of my ears is nearing the boarderline.  ***My doctor noted that
the kind of damage we sustain from loud music is irreversible!!!!!!*****  So
the doctor took molds of my ears and had custom ear plugs made for me.
Since I dj, my insurance paid for them because the damage is considered an
occupational hazard.  They are called "Rock Star Sound Suppressors" and they
work really well.  They suppress the sounds from loud music that will damage
your ear, but let the other sounds through.  I've dj'd with them on and they
really help suppress the sound from the monitor which can become painfull
after a while, and I can hear well enough to beat match.

Many of our lives are built around music.  What would YOU do if You lost
your hearing.  Think about it.

Hey, guys!  The red LEDs don't mean "this party is k00l, d00d", they 
mean "your sound is fucked up"!  Red is *bad*.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

Heavily distorted sound is much more damaging to the ears than clean
sound at the same volume level.  If it hurts even with earplugs I'm glad
I wasn't there.  Tinnitus *sucks*, ladies and gentlemen.

And I feel it necessary to point out that _any_ sound system at _any_
massive is loud enough to cause hearing damage.  Props to F&F for always
providing excellent clean sound at reasonable levels.

E*A*R brand foam earplugs are your friend -- $0.25 per pair at most
drugstores (they come in the little blue cardboard packs).  I always
leave a few pairs in my jacket.  Remember that if you don't insert 
them correctly (fully blocking the ear canal), they aren't actually
helping.

If you forget, take two squares of TP from the restroom (four if it's the
really thin institutional stuff).  Take one (or two) and start folding it
over until you get a square about 1/3" on a side.  Saturate with water
(hold under sink), squeeze some out, and press across ear canal to seal.
Note: Do *NOT* roll it up and wedge it way in there, as you may not be
able to retrieve it, and it will leave little bits of TP in there even
if you do, and you'll have to get your ears irrigated (blech).

Saturday night, towards the end of a dinner party and a bottle of merlot,
with Banco de Gaia's Maya playing in the background, I decide that I would
let spontaneity take me by that hand, and found myself magical in the
middle of the dance floor at Banco de Gaia live at the Tracadero.  A quick
motorcycle ride, no line, no Trac hassles, and a warm fuzzy feeling inside
guided me smoothly there.

What I heard was great.  I didn't catch any of the other show EBN, and thus
only saw happy, dancing, friendly people (not that the other show didn't
have that).  I moved close to a speak, because I was really enjoying the
music, and said to myself, "Tone, when you post to SFR on Monday about how
cool this show is, make sure you tell them that the music was so good, you
felt like you could just climb right into the speak and suck-up as much of
the noise as possible, like a thristy horse at a watering hole.  Just
sucking in the music in in enormous vacuum-like sluprs."

Well, that's what it was like.  All so good...

Wicked was fun too.  There was a wall of speakers in the back that weren't
on, and I though that if they were on it would definitely be to loud, even
without them, I have to agree that the music was loud.  And that's with
wads of toilet paper jammed in my ears.

I personnally feel all the afformentioned DJ's have 1 common concern. This
concern is spinning the most awesome set that they can come up with on a
givin night.My main concern is dancing my ass off to the most awesome set a
DJ can come up with. If your main concern is being a social butterfly, all
the power to you. There are mainy other people at parties for you to chat
with.
I would much rather see Jeno shred my aural orfaces than to watch him dance
himself into a bowl of tranced jello. I'm with Josh on the fact that I would
stop dancing and my jaw would probably drop off o' my face if Jeno did do
this? I'm with Phred also on the fact that Carlos is a virsitile freak of
nature, he can handle himself on the dance floor, in the social circles and
behind the decks. Instead of putting people down for there social
inabilities, why not applaud them for there possitive abilities that they
bring to a party. Also, try to think of your own possitive abilities and
bring them and let them flow at the next party and in your everyday life!

Well, did you ask Neil what was up?  Did you mention that the sound was too
loud for your tastes?  Maybe next time you might want to talk with him
about how he might do it properly.  But it is all a matter of opinion
anyway.  What is too loud for you is fine for others.

As in all things, your mileage may vary.

Boy, did you miss the point.  The point was that there will ALWAYS be
something.  It doesn't matter what.  Your thing is the sound.  Other
peoples thing is the DJ's dancing next to them.  It doesn't matter much to
me.  Fact is you can't make everyone happy.  There will always be
something, or someone to cause contrary feelings.  And as it pertains to
the Wicked crew, in this town, they will never be able to do anything right
by many peoples standards.  And that was the crux of my argument, foisting
your or anyones standards on someone else and expecting them to live up to
it.

Example in point: F& F pre-sale tix.  I don't beleive in them.  I think
they're stupid, and borders elitism. What have I said about it?  Nothing.
Why?  IT AIN'T MY PARTY!(And from all accounts, people generally like the
idea!)  I have nothing to do with the running of it, I have nothing to do
with the promotions, I have nothing to do with any aspect, other than
knowing who started it, whos a part of it, and who generally attends.  How
people run thier shows is their own business.  I do not expect you & your
posse/group to live up to ANY of my standards, whatever they may be.  You
can do what you want and how you want.  As long as you're not ripping
people off, I could care less about the internal dealings/rules/regulations
about events not sponsored by myself.  I don't need to comment on every
little thing I don't like, especially where it concerns MY expectations.

Ethan, you're funny.  I'm not trying to intimidate anyone, if you had these
feelings of intimidation with my post then that is your problem, certainly
not mine.  I was not namecalling anyone, there are some whiners,
complainers, and do-nothings everywhere.  What is annoying is the
namecalling perpetrated by others, who do not know the people they
namecall.  As for diminishing the value of the forum, whatever.  You have
your judgements and motivations and I have mine.  I don't spend my time
quibbling over bs in this scene.  Much like yourself, I *do* something
about it.

What diminishes the value of this list is the griping, moaning and
groaning.  I would generally have little to say about this, if these things
were in some way warranted.  But get real for a second, these things are
not based upon any real expereinces, they are based upon peoples
expectations not being fulfilled, and them blaming others for the let-down
they received.  After a while, the shit gets old, and the list gets into
the funk of "nobody does anything right" mode.
C'mon man "They're superstar DJ's cuz they don't dance in the crowd like
{name any DJ here] does!" (I know the person who posted this originally
later confessed and said it was probably a misunderstanding of the DJ's
motives in this case, but it does illustrate my point), what a load of
crap.  That would be like me going "Hey man, I finally got some time to go
to F&F.  Unfortunately the promoters are a bunch of elitist pigs.  Much
like BASS, they sell tix before the event.  Now I normally wouldn't obejct,
but I work in Santa Clara valley, I have no time to go to Solid Grooves to
get tix.  Why don't they sell them at my 7-Eleven across the street so
everyday humanity can get tix if they want!"

I illustrate F&F not filling my expectations, and them me passing judgement
on them due to my OWN pre-conceived notion of what is right.  I'm
sorry,passing judgement this way is punk ass, plain and simple.

{NOTE:  I do NOT feel that way about F&F at ALL.  I am just making a point
so disengage those flame-throwers.)

Nope, I will not tell you to bugger off.  No point to it.  I will continue
however to defend people I know if they've been wrongly accused, and you
can continue to defend the people you know.  Funny how you didn't say shit
about the initial post about Wicked, but when I jumped down the collective
complainers groups throat you saw it fit to get into my shit. I guess it's
called choosing your battles. We both have our allegiances/posses/friends.

>Not to mention the fact that I know what compressed distortion sounds like:
>DOGSHIT, and I heard plenty of it the other night.

Talk to Neil, I'm sure he would love to hear your suggestions.  E-mail
Wicked and let them know what you think.  You have done that, haven't you?

some new ones. AS well as bring my records up there to get some pointers,
since I'm just getting into spinning, 3 weeks into it. I went up there to
show him my turntables, got to play on his for a little bit, Then he broke
out and just went off for a couple of hours. He truly is worth checking out

Going to Wayne's place and he puts on some great ambient music.  I melt 
into the couch and we all casually talk among ourselves.  Then when I 
feel like going to fall asleep, I go upstairs and take a steaming hot 
shower then cuddle up in my sleeping bag as the ambient gives me some 
very *colorful* dreams.  Mmmmmmmm...:)

> Or what has been your most memorable post-raving experience? 

I've got 2:

1. Going to the End-Up after a wicked in August of 94.  That night I had 
met who were going to be 2 of my best girlfriends.  It was the perfect 
end to a perfect night.

2.  Burning Man!  Going back to camp after dancing to Wicked all night long. 
The sun is up and I go back and lay on a lounge chair as I watch the 
campfire. I can still hear the sound system thumping a quarter mile 
away.  I sip a beer (and I *never* drink beer!) and I fall asleep as 
the sun warms my body and friends' conversations tinkle in my ears .....I'm 
always ****so**** relaxed after dancing all 
night - I melt into anything I'm sitting/laying on.  This was heavenly!

love to all,
Amy

Speaking of normal people thinking you're wierd, and normal things seeming
weird.....

My husband & I were coming back from Tribal Future in Mendocino. (great party
too!) It was 6 pm and we were getting punchy after not having slept at all.
We went through the city and we saw the most amazing sight. It was a bus
painted just like a Toblerone chocolate bar! Has anyone else seen this bus? I
mean, we were tweakin', but this thing was hilarious. Esp. when you stop to
think how great it would be if the bus *was* made out of chocolate!!!
Yippeee!!!

                 I totlally agree, having spun parties myself. I find myself
in a somewhat different mind set , than if i came to dance. When spinning at
parties, sometimes D.J.'s look to other D.J.'s and close friends, for
support.  Sometimes when I spin at parties I'm thinking of what kind of "set"
I"ll spin, or I'm wonderin how i'm gonna start my set. or how I'm gonna my
mix my records with the D.J. 's records that's spinning before me. Other
D.J's know what that feeling is I suppose.
               So, don't take it personal if some D.J.'s seem a little
introverted at parties. they are probably just thinking to themselves.
               Feel free to talk and introduce your self, after the D.J's
after their set. I'm sure they appreciate the feed back. And I'm sure they be
happy to meet you. 
               I remember the last party I spun, after finishing my set, I
walked around and danced for a while, still hyped from the set I spun, but it
seemed that people just stared at me. i started to wonder if they heard me
"train wreck".    Or hated my set. Or the record that I played. We'll  I
guess i'm just shy, or feel more comfortable behind the turn tables. I
definatly could have used some feed back then.

Needle nose pliers and a steady hand, dude... or an awl and a hammer

Oh, and yes that's what I like to do after a long night of raving....

I think that it's fun to have a lot of friends over before and after a long
night of raving. My place has become a kind of a post-rave/slumber party
zone as of late.

I like to come down smoothly. Eat light foods and/or drink juices, listen
to some good mellow ambient CD's, talking and cuddling are good.

Oh yeah, be sure to turn off all the telephone ringers and close all the
blinds for uninterrupted recharging.

Wake up, and, as if my magic, your Sunday's gone but you feel great again!

And Tony's suggestion about watching the simpsons are most appropriate.

later on: Spundae/Teknotika? Haven't tried that yet.

Unfortunately this is mostlikely true, and in fact that might have been the
last Wicked Full Moon for a while.  It seems that someone has taken this
whole "who owns the FMR" thing way too seriously, to the extent that
they have made several death threats to Garth by phone (he has had to
change his phone number). Now before anyone goes off the deep end, I don't
believe that the organizers of the Goodness Full Moon or the New Full 
Moon or whatever they want to be called have had anything to do with this,
but I do believe tat the competitive and righteous vibe that has been coming
from that quarter has set some crazy person off. The lesson to be learned
here is you have to be responsible for your emminations, even if your in 
the right.   This is the first time in the 5 years of the full moon that 
any of the DJs or others involved have received death threats.  As far as 
Garth is concerned, this was the last straw for him, he no longer wants 
to do it and he feels really unappreciated.
I don't know what the rest say, but as of right now, Wicked won't be throwing
an FMR this month. As Garth was doing much of the organizing work around 
it and his friends were lugging most of the equipment his participation
and energy are really important for us to be able to throw a successful
party.

I would like to thank everyone who came out to the FMRs over the years,
keep the memories of all the good times close to your hearts, they will
be with you even when your old and grey.  Also remember and send blessings
to those who attended FMRs in the past and are not here with us now
for various reasons, especially to Mal, Trish and Al.

I would like to wish the New Full Moon people all the
best of luck, in your new endeavor, may you have all the luck that we
have enjoyed in these past 5 years and may you avoid all of the tragedies
that we also encountered.

This is true, and I'm sure jeno and markie have read this.
I think for the most part many of us who have done this for a while have
sustained some damage, what was the name of that doctor that you went to?

It was one of the ENT doctors at UC Davis Medical Center.  I was referred by
my primary care physician.  Check with your regular doctor and ask for a
hearing test.  Tell him/her that you are regularly exposed to extreemly loud
music and you would like to take some preventive action.  Your doctor should
refer you to an ENT (Ear Nose & Throat) doctor who will give you the test.
If your insurance wont cover it, the R.S. Sound Suppressors will run about
$50....the cost of a few records.  Totally worth it.

     Some DJs don't like to be talked to, or even approached, while they 
     are spinning.  This also includes just before and even just after 
     their set, as there's a sort of mental preparation/psyche up/wind down 
     that some go through.  You have to watch him or her and judge how open 
     he or she is to it.
     
     For example, it's really hard for me to deal with people coming up to 
     me and saying anything more than "Hi!!!" or giving me a wave or a 
     thumbs up.  Why?  Well, I've been listening to one record through a 
     headphone in one ear and another record through the other, and my mind 
     just can't make the switch to dealing with human speech.  If I 
     readjust myself to pay attention to what a person says, I lose my 
     concentration.  Sometimes it's not a big deal, but sometimes when I've 
     mixed myself into a corner (and it happens to everyone at times), I 
     really need to get the records figured out and quick before something 
     sonically unpleasant happens.
     
     I'm sure it could be interpreted as being rude -- especially when I 
     poke Brian and say "find out what this person wants and get rid of 
     them please" -- but if you've ever tried spinning on a big sound 
     system at a good-sized party, you'll understand that it's rather weird 
     when compared to doing it in your living room for 15 of your friends.
     
     I like to go out and dance like crazy to my final record so I can get 
     myself out of DJ mode and into party mode.  After that, I feel like I 
     can pay real attention to what people say to me, and can carry on 
     decent conversation.

I'm glad to know that others care about their hearing.  I've always worn 
ear plugs to both raves and music shows, and my friends always think I'm 
silly and fanatical.  Now, could anyone reccomend some good (cheap) 
earplugs.  I've used the kind in the box, but they muffle everything and 
leave all the base, which still bothers my hearing.  I've heard somehting 
about "musicians" earplugs which lower the vibrations, but don't muffle 
the music.  I imagine this was what Rick was talking about, but I don't 
think I can afford to go to the Doctor and have special ones made up.

Input appreciated for the overly careful,
kc

My roommate and I are looking for a turntable (not too fancy), not

ok.  Looking to spend around $100-$150, or so.

Anyone have any leads?  Ideas on where to go (besides Leo's & Mission pawn
shops)?

Much Gracias!

My doctor made no effort to verify if I was telling the truth about being a
musician/dj, and being a musician/dj is why I got them paid for by my
insurance. You could try that yourself.  If you had to pay it would be
around $50.

Well I'm no superstar DJ by a longshot, I've been spinning records
for my own enjoyment for about 15 months, the only public
place that I've played is at ameba and I can tell you that I can
tolerate people talking to me AT ALL! I'm such a novice that any
type of conversation pulls me out of the type of listening that is needed for
beat matching and something horrible will happen if I'm distracted
for too long!

As part of my efforts to keep SFRaves on the cutting edge :), I've
added a "shocked" version of the SFRaves home page.  To view it properly,
you need the Shockwave plug-in from Macromedia (find it at 
http://www.macromedia.com/) and the latest Netscape release (2.0b3),
(from http://www.netscape.com).  It features a semi-interactive turntable
and a simple animation.  A two-deck shockwave file is at
http://www.crl.com/~tactile/mix.html.

Unfortunately, only the Windows versions
of the Navigator and plug-in really work right now, so Mac users will
be stuck with my downloadable Director projector (from the demos page
under the SFRaves home page).  (the director file has many more features
and better samples anyway).

Hey

Well, part of my first experience with Vrave was that I didnt realize 
there was more than that first channel it puts you into, which of 
course is extremely filled & chattery.  I know irc is large, but I 
thought it wouldn't really matter if it was a channel only sfravers 
were interested in.  Either way!  (Ravebot?)  That'd be cool!

After reading GeoffW's message, it's funny how many people said that there
were too many "gangster looking" people at a party.  When in fact, the real
gankers and assholes who issue death threats would probably look the
farthest thing from a gangster.  A lesson in what happens when religion
takes over.  PLUR my ass.

I was not a big FMM fan, but I've gone to one or two, but am saddened that
our scene has become so sorry that petty bs as when a party is would become
an issue. Goes to show what radical fanaticism, religion, and
self-righteousness can fertilize.

I do hope this person is somehow exposed.  And if in fact Garth got some
death threats, then there are legal devices available to him to track this
screwhead down.

This really sucks, but it was bound to come to some ending.  Too bad it had
to be on this note.

wack.  fukin' wack.

This town needs an enema,

John, I think you've made some valid points in this thread, but I can't
agree with you on this one.  If the system is too loud for someone such as
Ethan who is exposed to loud music on a regular basis, chances are, it's too
loud.  Granted, maybe he should have talked to Neil, but he didn't.  He's
airing his concerns now, however, and I don't think it's to whine or
complain.  It was just a suggestion, and one which I, as someone who cares
about their hearing, is glad he brought up.

Actually, I think you missed Ethan's point.  He wasn't making some broad,
sweeping generalization about problems.  He's addressing a specific one, and
one that _should_ be addressed.  What if there hadn't been any water at the
venue?  By your reasoning, that's just another thing to complain about.
However, I sure as hell wouldn't attend a party without water, nor would
most people.  

I think you need to make a distinction between aesthetic complaints and
health issues.  Contrary to some people's opinions, the music volume is very
much a health issue.  Maybe it isn't as immediate as the need for water, but
it is still an issue that needs to be addressed.  If the dj's are elitist,
fine.  If the atmosphere is too clubby, fine.  Whatever.  But those things
are a tad bit less important than preserving your hearing.  20 years from
now, I know which problem I'll remember more.

John, what goes on here is none of the above.  If you want to see some
serious whining, join another listserve for a few days.  I'm a pretty
tolerant person, but some, nay, almost all of the discussion on the 4AD
listserve is petty haranguing of others.  I'll give you the address if you
want.  Check out a few other listserves and you'll find the same.  I think
it's okay that people voice their opinions, as long as they're polite.  If
you didn't like the presale tix idea, I think you should have said
something.  One job of SFR is to provide a forum for discussion on
improvement of the scene, not just for spreading warm fuzzy energy around.
Personally, I'm glad when people bring up issues, and hopefully the
promoters hear them.  If they choose not to act on them, that's okay.  But
at least then they know people's concern.  It's awfully difficult to improve
a party if you don't know what needs improving.

I will agree here.  It's easy for people to end up in this mode, a la the
discussion on how "the scene just ain't what it used to be back in good ol'
91."  Personally I don't have the time or expertise to start up a DIY, but I
can at least try to give feedback in a POSITIVE manner (and I think that's
an important distinction).  But again, I don't think Ethan's complaint came
from being let down.  It was definitely based on real experience, as you say.

The person in question replied, as you said, that they misunderstood the
djs' actions.  I don't think it was a "load of crap".  I think it was a
genuine misunderstanding.  Thanks to all those who helped clear up that
particular issue.  But your comment above is neither helpful, illustrative
of the problem, or accurate.  It's just bashing.

Again, this isn't passing judgement.  I think you should have expressed your
opinions about it.  It's in how you say it, not what you say.  Here's what I
mean.

_John approaching Ethan about F&F presale tix_

Approach #1: "Ethan, I wanted to talk to you about the presale F&F tickets.
I think it's unfair because some people who would love to go just won't have
access to them." Etc.

Approach #2: "Ethan, what the fuck is up with F&F tickets?  This is
bullshit, man.  You elitist assholes are screwing up big time." Etc.

See the difference?

Did it occur to you that maybe he hadn't checked his mail before that, or
didn't feel like getting into the issue until you said something he felt was
wrong?  You've made an _awfully_ big generalization here.  I didn't get into
the discussion before, and I don't have strong ties on either side of the
fence that I need to defend.  I just felt after reading this particular
message that I had something to add.  Don't jump to baseless conclusions.

Since there are Wicked people who read the list on a regular basis, I think
he's made his point already.

Jake

P.S.  I'm not trying to defend Ethan persay, it's just that he seemed to be
the object of John's mild eruption (i.e. I don't believe in this "defending
your posse" ideology.  I defend whoever I feel is right, regardless of my
afilliation with them).

I've never gotten a sense that the New Full Moon organizers have held the
opinion that their interpretation is any better than Wicked's nor that they
want to compete with Wicked. There are some personal differences between
members of both groups, but that shouldn't reflect on the groups
themselves. It seems a bit disingenuous to blame the NFM group for indirect
responsibility for the crank calls to Garth.

You know, I think this is something important.  It's one thing to spout PLUR
all the time, and it's another to live it.  I agree with John here that a
lot of people aren't very good at walking the talk.  As far as the
plur/religion thing goes, I'm reminded of the book Dune (not the sorry
imitation movie version).  It addresses the same issue, when speaking your
mind becomes heresy.  I'd say people need to remember to THINK about their
actions, something which, sadly, people sometimes forget to do.

The moral of the story is that it's easy to get caught up in buzz words.
It's one thing to say plur is what the scene's about and another to think
about what it means and apply it to your life.

I was pretty pissed off when I read about this incident.  Whoever the fuck

life in general) is all about.  Can you imagine what it would be like if
different crews started going at each other's throats and shit like that for
status?

The day that happens is the day I stop raving.

Sometimes when we have eunf energy, a walk in the woods or to the top of a
mountain(Diablo, Tam, any hill on the penninsula) is one of my favorite
Sunday activities.(especially if my pupils are still a little dialated and
I'm extra sensitive visually).  There's something about being in harmony with
hundreds of people, then with nature.  Of course, there's the best of both
worlds after a FMM or any outdoor party in the summer when the sun's up so
early.  I also like to be alone and get all introspective about what just
happened, the beat music, hearts, and waves on the beach.

The crank caller specifically mentioned the fact that Garth had somehow
had a hand in the fact that a person was swept off the rocks at the last 
full moon (even though Jeno was playing at the time :) And yelled at him
about some altercation that he had between himself and the promoters of
the "alternative" full moon.

As I said, I don't believe that Claire or anyone else involved with the 
New Full Moon had anything to do with the person that made the crank calls
but they are responsible for the energy that they let out as are we all.

This is a bone that I pick with all promoters, we are responsible for the
safty of our participants as Ethan rightly notes when it comes to sound 
volume (though I think on the promoter front, Ethan and F&F are the ONLY ones
that are concerned with our hearing.

Basically the feeling is that it's not worth all of the accusations and
coulda woulda shouldas involved and definitely not worth people getting
so worked up that they would make death threats, believe me in the scene
the way it is now with all the meth abuse going on and people staying up
for 5 days straight, I would take those types of wacko threats very 
seriously.  It was only two years ago that a friend killed another friend
with a gun over something as trivial as this, meth was involved as well.

People have to realize and remember, it is afterall just a party.

I really never adressed Ethan's concern in my last post (dismissing it I
beleive).  Well I DO think that there's plenty of validity in this
statement.  I generally stay back a bit, depending on the sound.  This Sat.
was loud, no doubt.  I have always wondered about people standing or even
putting their heads in the speaker.  Little Louie was a resonable level
from my view, a some even suggested it was too low during Little Louies
set.  I don't go out that often, and when I practice it's usually at a
reasonable level.  I am starting to think about ear plugz when going out.
Gotta be able to talk to my kid without asking too many "Eh, what's that?"

I also think that the sound system they have is really geared towards
outdoor usage.


bcnu,

        Well, as to what i usually do, i usually end up crashing out at my
place and meditating, or reading (last weekend i tried reading Roger
Penrose's "Shadows of the Mind" about the connection b/n consciousness and
quantum physics and i actually got some of it!). I think that the post-rave
state of consisciousness is even better than the one that you have at a
rave (well, maybe not better but different, i prefer the post though).
Maybe i'll have a beer or *ahem* something smokable and just think for a
while. I find that the post-rave condition is pretty uhh hormonal so i
usually try to focus that energy into something useful as i don't have
someone to 'be an outlet with' :)
        As for my most memorable post-rave experience, i have a couple, but
one of the ones that is most interesting is going to an afterparty in NYC
last spring, finding some friends and having them offer me a joint.
Eventually we figured out that it was about 90% dust and so there i was,
alone on a Sunday morning in Brooklyn, in the subway trying to get back to
my friend's place. AND THEN there was this family going off to church at
the subway and the son (about 5 years old) kept biting the mother's hand
and yelling "gimme nibbows! gimme nibbows!" (gimme nibbles...i guess?!) I
was doing my best not to laugh, but couldn't help it when the father bends
down and earnestly says "now son, what have i told you about repeating?"
and the son looks down, pauses, then looks up and says "ummm...gimme
nibbows?"
        definitely memorable!

(my two cents on accusations that sfraves is a whine-a-thon.)

one reason to try to keep comments about performers/dj's from getting
nasty or petty is that i'd like to see them eager to post to this list too.
one of the most exciting things i see in house/ambient music is that it's a
pretty radical departure from most current music - it's less about melody
or harmony and much more about what direct sensory input (sound,
light, chest-thumping bass) is going to make your body react positively.  
starting to think about music as a direct feed to your physiology without
filtering through your cognitive centers first is the idea here that i
think is so fascinating, and what really sets "rave" music apart from all
the other exciting new music coming out.

i'd like to know whether the dj's, musicians, video artists, etc. in the
sf scene think like that, or if not what is going on behind the watch
face.  we're discovering a whole new musical/sensory aesthetic, and i for one
want to try to understand why i touches me so much.  and it ain't just the
drugs, you know.  but the more we bitch about details the less likely
people are to just toss out their speculations and random flashes of
insight - and that's too bad.

for instance, a couple of rave organizers (or promoters, or whatever)
from the uk came to campus last year just to shoot the shit and talk 
about the philosophy of what they're trying to do, and how they think it
came together synergistically with the '60s back to nature and
'trance'-endental meditation thangs - it was pretty informative, but even
more thought provoking.  why can't that be going on all the time here on
our corner of the net?  after all, i thought that's what it was for ...

Sound levels and distortion are a serious matter, and I don't think that
John would doubt, after a moment of reflection, that this is more than
a matter of "expectations not being met."  We can't let the music we
love hurt us and our friends . . . It's a matter of preparation and
keeping on top of the sound situation.  It's a responsibility I personally
take very seriously, in part because I've got a bit of tinnitus.  It's
permanent, it can't be reversed, but you can protect yourself and still
have a good time.  While overall volume is an issue, distortion is what
really does the damage.  But even the cleanest sound can damage your
ears if you're not careful and stay too close for too long.  I think
of that every time I see serious speaker-tweaker action.  Anytime I'm
within the range of the high volumes, I pop in the plugs and often,
as for example almost always on the King St. dancefloor, I keep 'em
in regardless.  

There is an organization in San Francisco called HEAR which has information
on music and hearing protection.  I don't have the phone or address but
anyone interested can contact my friend Dr. Flash Gordon (yes, that's his
real name!) at flash@well.sf.ca.us and he'll fill you in.

This is the real deal.  Preserve your hearing, it's worth it.

peace out.

Dear All;

	Like WOW!!!, what's up with our scene, robberies, death threats,
fights, no/shitty venues, tagging, bad drugs, bad music, promoters 
overcharging & lieing about admission fees, food, ..etc, arrogant DJ's, &
vibeless parties? It's really starting to get me disillusioned, and makes
me want to become an isolationist raver. It seems the butthead quotient
has gone through the month so far this month & last month. I've talked
with a lot of people who are really unhappy with our scene right now. In 
fact my New Years resolution is to become very selective about the 
parties I go to.

	For instance, I went to DV8 Thurdays night for Lift, and the soft 
house they were playin really left me totally uninspired, in fact I 
couldn't even dance. Then Friday I went to XNTRK, thinking this would be 
a desent party considering the fact Dutch & Carlos were spinning, and it 
turned out the Dutch opened the night up, and Carlos came second, who's 
bright idea was that lineup? If it wasn't for Joe Rice Saturday night at 
966 Mission it would have been a total wash weekend.

	I'm just reaaly disgusted with the expensive parties that 
don'tdeliever what they promise. I'll be at Chrysilsis on the 9th because 
I know that will be a great party. We reaaly need a party that can get 
the good vibe going again, I hope someone will throw one soon, I would, 
but I don't think any of you would come, sorry but that's just the way I 
feel.

I dunno, Brian, but I tell myself I'm going to have a good time and I 
always do. Many people I know are griping about how shitty the scene is 
and get that faraway look when remembering the "good ole days".  I just 
don't see it!  Every year gets **BETTER** for me.  I am pretty selective 
about the parties I attend, and living here in Sacramento doesn't afford 
me the opportunity to party every weekend.  So burnout is also less 
probable in my situation.   It is, indeed very unfortunate about any 
threats, robberies, and other atrocities, but if each person tries a 
little to make the best of each situation that is under their control, 
it can't help but get better.  
Gawd, I am such an optomist - I always have been, and I'm also very happy 
with the scene.  It is all what you make of it - it is your choice, pure 
and simple.

hugs and smiles,
Amy

The fact of the matter is that the rave scene goes through its ups & downs.
As long as I have been raving (about 3 yrs., not as long as some), I have
seen my share of scary things. Because many ravers do drugs, there will
always be that element of unsavory happenings which surround the scene. I
think the sf scene has a lot more energy in the summer, people are happy when
they're outside. Things are worse elsewhere right now, Trust me. Things are
not so bad. If you're upset, laying low for a while is not a bad idea. You'll
come back when you're ready. 

We need to love and support each other. That means ravers, promoters, dj's
and everyone. We have a symbiotic relationship. We need each other. We need
to express this love and appreciation to each other. This is the way the
scene will grow and thrive. I know we can't be all warm & fuzzy all the
time.... but I like warm & fuzzy myself. 

>We reaaly need a party that can get the good vibe going again, >I hope
someone will throw one soon, I would, but I don't think >any of you would
come, sorry but that's just the way I feel.

The parties will have good vibes if we make them good vibes. Each individual
decides to have a good time, smile at everyone else, this forms a chain
reaction... next thing you know, a room full of happy people! :-) We can do
it ourselves. We don't need to wait for someone else to do it. We are the
scene.

     we're getting kinda touchy these days...Remember folks, reading and 
     writing on this list is much like life:  Your interpretation depends 
     on your perception at the moment, in this case, it's whether you're

     flippant or comical can be insulting, depending on how you look at it. 
     How many times have you heard, "Gee, you look good today" and then 
     hear "You mean I didn't look good yesterday?".  Yep, it's about 
     perception.  Okay, off my soapbox now and onto my "vibe" review of 
     Wicked and social observations. 
     
     Wicked didn't seem to necessarily have "gangstahs" in the house but 
     rather a more clubbier, voyeristic crowd this time.  And yes, there 
     were more people of color at this party which might contribute to 
     stereotypes.  Sometimes it's hard to describe what you feel or see and 
     it may come out the wrong way.  I think we're also sensitive on how to 
     say things for fear of sounding prejudiced.  I know this because I had 
     this vibe discussion after Wicked with a few friends.  
     
     I love Wickeds when I'm able to make them perhaps because it was the 
     first rave I went off/tranced at ;) or because of all the hype I heard 
     about them prior to finally making it to one.   In any case, the 
     beauty of their parties have been not only music and dance but the 
     diverse mix of freaks who just want to get down and get funky.  
     Attitude has always been part of the mix and that suits me fine 'cause 
     by the end of the party when you look around, it's usually blown away. 
     After all, we are here to listen to good music and dance.
     
     So what did I see that I didn't necessarily like about this party?  
     VOYERS - Now I'm as guilty as the next person for sitting down and  
     checking things out or staring into space but there seemed to be alot 
     of "beautiful people" who wore cool clothes and hung out.  And yes, 
     some of these people were not your "typical" ravers.  
     
     What did I _not_ do to help turn _my_ problem around?  I didn't smile 
     or make small talk with them...nor did I get the feeling that they 
     were open to it _but_ I didn't try it either.  But think about it, 
     when you're new to any scene it takes a while to open up and let your 
     guard down.  Perhaps the "gangstah" stereotype is really just a more 
     guarded person who hasn't felt enough trust in the scene to let his or 
     her guard down.  This can be cultural, social or whatever, I've 
     observed this behavior especially with minorities (me included) at 
     other gatherings and have even been considered aloof, distant, or 
     stuck up all because I wasn't sure how to interact in a situation.  
     
     What saved me so far in the sf scene?  Reading lots of posts about 
     smiling :) %) 8) So when I finally did go out, I decided to let my 
     light shine by smiling lots.  I haven't seen posts about this in quite 
     a while.  In fact, I know when I first started going out, I was very 
     social and wanted to meet lots of people.  Now, I'm kinda burnt and 
     guarded so I'm not as social _and_ I'm happiest when I see my friends 
     at the same parties I go to.  Perhaps I need to take inventory on 
     myself!
     
     I think there was also a more "machismo/male/almost aggro" vibe this 
     time at Wicked.  It's not isolated to this party either.  I've seen 
     and felt it growing several places in the past 6+ months and it got 
     bad enough Saturday night to where a guy grabbed me while I was 
     walking by.  How did I deal with this?  I patted him on the back, told 
     him he had a nice smile (he did as he grabbed me) and told him I was 
     with someone when he asked me.  That way we both felt okay about it.  
     I know not everyone can do this but there was no sense in making it 
     worse.  At another large East Bay party (many moons ago), I recall 
     complimenting a shirtless guy about his tattoo and his response to me 
     was "and you're ugly".  :o  Unfortunately I was speechless.  Perhaps I 
     should have just smiled and remembered it was his perception.
     
     In my dance collective and even at some parties, I've heard people ask 
     how we can make parties & dances more diverse.  Well, to start, we 
     need to continue keeping an open mind to educating and welcoming 
     people into the scene.  The fact that Cool World was widely attended 
     shows that people want to see what raves are about.  I know lots of us 
     who want to share this wonderful love we feel and if we want it to 
     grow, we have to deal with the growing pains.  And if we're really 
     caring and practicing plur(t), I really think it's necessary to 
     educate newcomers especially after hearing people talk about bad trips 
     (someone I met had tried crystal for their first time and didn't eat 
     or rest enough and crashed after four days, another had taken too much 
     GHB and was temporarily blinded and stumbling).  I have problems with 
     people who go off without educating theirselves about what they're 
     doing or considering the ramifications and I know that it's my 
     problem.  I'm just glad they're able to live to tell of their story.  
     But not everyone knows where to access this info and there's alot of 
     new and young people out there who are either just going off, or 
     searching for a community that can share some values and attention 
     that they're presently not getting.  Another friend and I commented 
     that we both had a difficult time w/young kids going off at large 
     parties but we also sadly said that we didn't do anything about 
     welcoming them to the scene.  And so I ask myself why don't I and 
     would they be receptive to me.  (Light bulb flashing over my head, I 
     think I just stumbled over an answer for myself!)
     
     In any case, apologies for my ramblings but I wanted to address some 
     things that I observed and give you my input.  Sorry for sounding so 
     preachy.  Hope you all made it through this long memo and for those 
     who did, here's an equally long, virtual hug (and smile!) from the 
     universe.
     
     Hope to see some of you at MAD tonight!
     
     Love in white light,
     Diane
     
     BTW, Jeno really did it for me this time.  Even when my calves hurt, I 
     still had to get up and dance.  Thanks Wicked crew and all of you out 
     there for bringing your love to the scene.
     
     Diane

maybe if we all make a REAL concerted effort to give each other a bit of
credit for intelligence and kindness instead of just typing PLUR over and

yes, yes, yes, yes!  those who have been through the doors of perception,
one way or the other, have a responsibility to help 'virgins' learn how
to enjoy the ride without losing their anchor - even a near slip is one
of the most terrifying experiences you can have, and all this nancy reagan
bullshit over the years is satanic miracle-gro for THE FEAR.  ('just a simple
trip that wrecked minds' is a two-edged sword.)  i mean, obviously i'm not
suggesting  droning on endlessly about this trip or that and how to
'do it right' and generally being jackasses.  but, as long as the rave
scene has this glam relationship with recreational drugs, we need to be
responsible about taking care of our own, inside and outside of parties.

god, i need to quit blithering myself and finish my term paper.  wish me luck,

[ To sfraves mailist ]

 Since some DJs are deliberatly going into the red to get that rock'n'roll
fuzz distortion flavor to the sound , why not do what the rock guitarists
do and put a distortion unit between the mixer and the power amps? 
 The distortion that is created with these devices is of much higher quality
, and the control of the harmonics created is knob-twisting easy. Each DJ
can put in as much fuzz as they want. Also , most distortion units filter
out the tweeter-killing ultra high frequencies ( I think ).
 The only problem would be that the unit would have to be in stereo.

 You DJs out there - would you be interested in a stereo distortion unit
as I describe above? In my early days , I've built some distortion circuits
that could be duplicated and the controls ganged together ... I wouldn't
mind experimenting if anyone's interested.

 My present favorite ear protection nowadays is those fish shaped foam
earplugs that sporting goods stores sell . Doesn't cut high frequencies
as badly as other foam plugs , and doesn't cut the volume as much as
those fancy tan rubberish ones with the circular ribs. I use the rubberish
ones for really severe dangerous high volume rave/rock concert situations.
 
 Wet folded/rolled bar napkins or toilet paper is also good. I prefer to
live dangerously and roll mine in a cigarette filter shape , such that I
can control how much I let into my ear canal ( the extra outside length
acts as a handle ).

Now what would  be nice is a touch sensitive solo button for the RANE.  No
way currently to easily get that nice "transformer" effect.

Good day to U all-

First of all I would like to say when I go out to a party I go out with
smiles and come back wit smiles.  i am a very optimistic person and always
look for the good in things and people.
make the best of what you got and when you got the best make it a memory.  :)

Saturday was my 20th birthday and because I am 20 now I still can't leagally
go o wicked.  Focus was at Marina Skate - I don' t really like this loation
but I knew Adrian and JJ and a few others throwing the party and I decided to
go out and show my support.  I was happy to see they did something new to the
venue by tarping off a chill area, a play area complete with a mini-house,
and the dancefloor.  I was very happy with the visuals spinning
kaladascope(sp?) and there were great lasers.
I got several happy gifts from friends -yeah!- and I was off on a dancing
frenzy as Dutch started off with some sick alien trance. I think Tony came
next but i was off in my little world for awhile and found an alien mask I
put on cuz it looked kewl.  True there weren't alot of people dancing but
this didn't sop these feet.  and true there were a lot a hoods but it's the
ghetto what do you expect? I met a lot of nice people, many newbies and told
the good little munchkins about the Gathering on the 16th.  Simon went on
after Tony and next was Dreamer.  I love Simons sets but I don't think he
should be on at the peak of the party.  I love to wind down to his music
(especilly at PreBirth).  Ghost was next - man I remember him back in the day
just goin' off with some old skool vocal house and stuff I still like him
-but to bad my ride wanted to leave in the middle.  
  The vibe wasn't there but I had a lot of phun. GK pro and Adonis have a lot
of potential I think they just need a better venue and some support and
input.  I will try to continue to support them  ReserXtion is coming up on
the 30th.

By the way does anyone know a Ryan, Clois(??big white guy w/ sm. tails), or
Laura - They go to Saint Marys Co. Really nice people and I lost this phone
#'s can anyone help please.

Sunday morning the sunrise was just full o' beauty Dark red(gothic)->bright
red/orange->golden yellow     ahhhhh!
Did any one else ove it.

I heard this the other day and think it is really pertant to the list right
now---
 ***************************************

Peace and love to you all                    Keep the vibe alive
  
 ps.  Has anyone tried Earmuffs- I wear these some times 
        They muffel the sound a little and make you feel like you are in your
own little rave with lotts of smiling faces around you.   :)  @@  (:

As was previously posted, everything has its ups and downs.  And as
it would seem that we are now going through a downswing, it becomes
more important than ever for each one of us who feels that gloomy
tinge of disillusionment to take the time to give credit to and 
remember what exactly it is that we feel we are missing.  It's also
very important to remember that things will inevitably swing back the
other direction, and if we want to be there when it happens, we mustn't
lose faith.  In fact, it is through this process that things will be
even better and stronger the next time around, as we will have learned
to see through all those issues that threw us off the last time.  I might
even go so far as to say that we can look at periods like this as a positive
sign that we are growing and becomming more aware, we mustn't fear them.

Where has the vibe gone?  It is still right here. It has just become invisible
until we grow strong enough to see it again.  We must resolve our fears
and tensions with all those things we consider negative and that we think
might have "killed the scene."  And then, sooner than we think, we'll
be dancing away and suddenly be filled with a forgotten passion and
remember why we were doing this in the first place.  and it won't have
so much to do with the right party, or the right new good music, or the 
right people... it will only have to do with ourself and the time when we
finally give up searching so hard for the vibe that we didn't let ourselves
see it...  that moment when you, let yourself go.

Don't expect to find it and let yourself become dissapointed... just
remember that all those things you love are out there, and that they
will find you when you are ready for them again.  You can't force it.
Like with the Full Moon situation... there are people who are trying to
force something out of the full moon ceremony, making it so important
that the simple meaning of it has become convoluted.  It doesn't matter
who... It is part of a cycle where the meaning must change in order
for meaning to get discovered.  And it may be that after a while, Wicked
will find themselves eager to reestablish their full moon, or it may be
that other people will take over and celebrate their full moon, but the
point is that when we need to celebrate the full moon, when we become ready
again, the full moon will be there and will find us with the right people
to help us celebrate it.  Did that make sense?  All these things are
happening for a reason, and the tensions need to ease for things to
become simple again... and they will, so just let them.

everything begins and ends with you.

Let yourself go.

-john.

Another thing to keep in mind about high sound levels (which I love) is
that the damage to your ears is caused by a cumulative continuious
exposure. What may be find to listen to for 30mins-1hr could cause
tremendous damage in 5 hours.

Even if you like the loud sounds, give your ears a break - especially when
you're at parties indoors.

And take it from someone who has Tinnitus on a small scale. It can be real
nasty at times, and I have a weak case of it. If you want to put some fear
in your hearts, read alt.support.tinnitus and see the horror stories.

One final note (I sound like an old man preachin' to the kids). Hearing
loss occurs 1-2 octaves higher than the frequency of the damaging sound.
This means too much bass can cause you to lose hearing in that all
important speach hearing range. While most of the music we listen to at
parties has extremely deep bass almost on a sub-sonic level, it shouldn't
impact us quite as badly. But think about it sometime. Isolate the bass
sounds, and imagine the sound two octaves up (double the pitch twice).

Final note on earplugs- There is a brand called "Docs Pro Plugs", they are
custom molded earplugs with exceptionally good audio response designed for
musicians. They have almost flat frequency response. Music stores like
Guitar Center should be able to get them for you.

Geoff,    
      Thanks for the Epitaph(!) but it wasn't necessary to get so
urr...carried away. 
      
     Actually it's like this:-

At last month's party we discussed the much anticipated wet 'n
wintery weather and buzy workloads that are typical at this time
of year and decided to take a "wait 'n see" attitude to the
December FMR. When we know wassup we'll let you know and of
course stick some info on the voicemail. If it's meant to be it
will happen.

I know you've been privy to some of the hostility directed at us 
lately, but believe me it's nothing new. Yer, it can make you 
wonder, but we love a good laugh :) Inevitably it just inspires,
and added to all the +ve feedback we get ...........well, what
more can I say?

Thanks for your support, we luv ya  :)
                               
             Those loud and obnoxious Wicked rockstars

P.s I'm gonna post this to the SFRavers.

Yeah, I guess this is what can happen when one (me) gets all
religeous about the Scene, my apologies to anyone that I might have flamed
in the backwash, I'll think BEFORE I speak the next time. :)

Go to the beach with a couple of rave-pals and bring some organic juice 
and fruit to share.  The ocean is a great way to top off the post rave 
climax.

help!

i've got someone on america online who's having trouble loading
  a web page i made for them, and was wondering if any kind soul
    out there could volunteer a minute or two (or ten, depending
      on bandwidth) to lookat the page and tell me if it's ok or whut.

we've been looking at the page from other services, but aren't sure
  that AOL supports all the things we've done...

the page is:

http://www.ultima.org/~monoi/index.html

it's got one large image, about 86K, and another about 40K

thanks for any help!

Dear Brian and all,

    What IS happening to our scene!? You are your own answer. This is 
definately OUR scene, but sometimes you must treat it as YOUR scene, 
independantly! You are single handedly responsible for creating the 
vibe which makes YOU happy. Personally, I am sick of people complaining 
about the parties that now have no vibe. There are enough of us that 
attend each single party every week to create the vibe we so desire. If 
each of us put forth the same amount of energy to create the vibe, as 
we use to complain about it, we could have the best vibe ever!!! I 
think it is time for you to start taking responsibility for the vibe at 
every party. 

    I keep hearing people talking about certain promoters and how their 
parties are now vibeless (T.F.). It is not ALL their fault. If you went 
to T.F. you obviously went there to have a good time. So instaed of 
trying to find every single thing wrong with the party, why not try to 
make things right! I admitt, so parties are naturally better than 
others, but each party deserves the energy that we are capable of 
giving. 

    So, what is happening to our scene? I feel, yes there have been 
some promoters who exploited the scene, but we need to get past that 
and strive to rebiuld what some people say is lost, (the vibe). Quit, 
blamming promoters, and start dancing!!! Why doesn't anyone dress up 
anymore at parties? Is that the promoters' fault too? NNNNOOOOOO! At 
the Gathering coming up in Dec. Some of the Harmony crew (including 
myself), are going to be in our crayon suits again. I would like to 
urge as many people as possible to dress up once again for this four 
year anniversary. It always make me happy to see people dress up. I can 
only assume it makes others happy to....

    And to you Brian, if you want someone to throw a kickass party, 
then why don't you try it yourself!! That is what we (Harmony) wanted, 
and tried to do. IMO, we achieved that (going by the responce from 
everyone who has been to our parties). Anyways, I gotta go do my 
finals. 

Peace, love, and vibes,

Greg :)

>I look for: 

-Lots and Lots of smiling people.
-A good Vibe as soon as you walk in the door
-A soundsystem that will blow you out of your skivvies ( bring those
earplugs, I like to rip off -little peices of my makeup sponge , you can rip
a pice off that is just the right fit and one face sponge will last awhile)
- The space (preferabaly outdoors) should b well ventilated and not to dark.
I like to See those  I am partying w/.
-The turntables and the DJ should be in sight of the dance space  and the
dancers , not so close as to disturb the DJ or skip his records , but close
enough so the freakers and their DJ can exchange energy ( a must so a DJ can
feel the energy flow from the crowd and let it shape his/ her set).I hate
when a DJ cannot be seen , it adds to the feeling that the DJ is not a part
of the crowd hence that Rock star vibe that Iv'e heard some complaints about
recently.
- The visuals should be creative and artistic. Flashing lighs give me a
headache. 
- Friendly staff ( security, barkeeps, ticket-takers, doorpeople), that are
enjoying the party they are luky enough to be getting paid to be at.
 I'm sure I havent covered everything, but dinner awaits.

                                                                            
                                                            Keep the vibe

        LEt's all try to to cheer up huh?!I blame alll the recent bad vibe
and irritability some of us it seems has been goin thru lately on finals.
as for the rest,I read or heard somewhere that X-mas is the most depressing
time of the year. We are VERY lucky to have the kind of scene and the
amount of parties that we do.You need to take the scene into your own
hands.The amount of of good vibes and and goodtimes depends on you and
really no one else.I had a great time @ Tribal Funk.I must admit at first I
felt a little vibeless, Later on I felt great!(Okay yeah I did some
E...(that did not last very long by the way)but even after I came down I
still had a graet time(hey,...I stayed till the end...)SoBer or not I still
end up havin a great time cause that's why I go to Raves to have a good
time. I leave my problems outside after all if you are spendin $20 just to
get in should not you get your money's worth?!
        I really hope all o yous cheer up.if there is anything I can do to
help my e-mail is right after the "from" I will sees all o yea @ Planet
Rock (which looks mighty taAsty)and of course the Gathering...(who could
miss?)I promise.....

Hey

Was just wondering, since this is a Bay Area Phenomenon (sfraves, that 
is), if there's anybody on this list that went to Albany High School 
during the 80's sometime?  I went there myself for the duration and am 
curious to see if there are ANY of you out there!  Let me know!

Thank you very much for this info. It didn't occur to me that there
was a cumulative effect. That is why sometimes I don't think the
volume is too high, but I can really hear the damage afterwards.

Thanks for the other good info too. Last weekend I was dragged kicking
and screaming into the Sound Factory. It actually wasn't that bad
after 3am, and there was one DJ in a small room named Bruno who I
liked. Anyway, the ear damage was worse than I ever remember having
before. This is from someone who has played in a few high volume bands
along with clubbing, etc. There was something particularily damaging
about the main floor sound system there. Bring those ear plugs! I know
Bottom-of-the-Hill sells them at the bar. Maybe if everyone started
asking to buy earplugs along with their water, then dance parties and
clubs would start to have them available as a default.

I agree with being open and educating newcomers.  I consider myself "new" 
and sometimes feel very out of place.  Burning Man aside, Cool World was 
my first party.  My "experienced" friends were bored after an hour and 
wanted to leave.  I told them to go even though I didn't know anyone in 
SF or Oakland. I decided I could sleep in my car before driving back to 
Fresno.  Oh joy!

Anyway, I love wandering around by myself, and the had the greatest time, 
but....nobody spoke to me unless I spoke to them first.  I smile, and I'm 
very friendly.  It seems to me that groups form and look unwelcoming.  Of 
course, to protect myself from all the flaming, this is only "my perception".

I've attended Funky Techno since then and feel a little more at ease, but 
not much.  I love it that people hand out candy (don't ever eat a 
Pepermint Patti on E...it took forever to chew).  I want to make new 
friends, but I don't see it happening without me making all the effort.

That's why I joined this group so I could possibly meet some people 
before The Gathering.  Maybe I need to go to smaller parties.  I hear 
these are better for meeting people.  You think??

hey there,
just picked up an album by william orbit - strangecargohinterland.  some
of best chill tracks i've heard in a long while.  makes me wonder what
would've happened if chopin had dropped and followed the dead for a while!
check it out if you can.

so, who/what is william orbit?  met a guy who tells me it's a one-man-show,
like b de g (giovanni, if you're reading this list drop me a line!)  is that
true?  if so, do his friends call him billy o?  with a straight face?

Hmmm maybe this is the answer you want;

I am only being sarcastic!
Actually one cool thing some friends and I had at a Rave we threw was a 
Gyro-tron. Im sure you've all seen em. Big thing you stand in and it 
spins around inside another ring, inside another ring. Anyway, I liked it. 
And so did the couple hundred people who rode it :)
The coolest thing are allllllll the people totally going off when Im 
playing music. Absolutely nothing beats dj-ing infront of a couple hun 
people and having them scream at the top of their lungs and jump
up and down after a nice rise.

hey everybody,

just thought i'd once again say something nice about MAD, such as:  it
was a lot of fun yet again.  i wasn't there long..just mostly for alex'
set.  

i have to admit that after the FnF halloween party and three weeks of MAD,
plus hearing ethan at the New Full Moon on the beach two months ago...that
now i think techno is beautiful.  whereas before i thought it was too intense
and in-your-face.  is it my imagination, or is techno..with a driving
beat..getting more complex and interesting?  i wish i had a more sophisticated
knowledge of music so that i could express what i mean.  oh well.

and for those who like salsa music- and you know who you are! - bahia cabana
does a salsa band thing saturday night.

hi!

i hear the new full moon, or goodness full moon, or whatever it is we are
going to call this thing, is going to happen in san francisco wednesday night.
(sorry if i shouldn't have spilled the beans, but...) eenyway, i was just
wondering if i could bring anything to it- such as fruit, candles, whatever-

i probably will no matter what, but there are possibly other people who 
would like to help out along these lines...it is partly for them that i'm
asking.

looking forward to the full-on lunar experience...

-Ann

ps the full moon last month out in the industrial wasteland was great...
it was the first time i've ever seen that place..basically an asphalt strip..
look beautiful.  

as my friend michelle is fond of saying:  throwing raves in places the rest
of society regards as wasteland symbolizes the moral imperative expressed
in that highly charged Dubtribe song that demands:  I want my planet back!

Hi,

I need to get in touch with the Planet Rock promoter(s) ASAP (i.e. a few
days before Friday, and it's going to be Wednesday in a couple minutes). Do
any of you have any other number for them besides the voice mail number?
Help!

Thanks,

Wayne

hi!
at the risk of doing this flame-analysis thing to death, one last set of
observations.  i know, this particular horse shouldn't be beaten much more, 
so feel free to delete this now.  :(

i was thinking that the sfraves list is basically an on-line magazine of
artistic reviews.  there's also a lot of other communication going on, but
that's at least a big part of it.  thinking about it that way, maybe we
can get some mileage out of journalistic practices.  so what does that
mean?

(1) party reviews:
no self-respecting print mag would try to function without an editor, but
we do.  that means every one of us has to step it up and try to act as an
objective editor for what we write as reviews of parties.  and, just
because you're a smart and open minded person, doesn't mean everything you
want to write about a party is objective.  i just read an interview with
stanley crouch, who is a jazz drummer and onetime critic for the village
voice.  (check out his recordings - he goes off!)  he said sometimes he'd
hand in copy for a review, and his editor would come back and say,
stanley, this is crap.  don't embarrass me and you by trying to get me to
print this shit.  (an example of something they did print - crouch started
a review with something like, "to begin with the n----r just can't write."
imagine what they didn't print!)  that didn't mean stanley didn't have
something to say that was worth reading - he just hadn't gotten it right.

i'm not saying you shouldn't voice personal opinions - i want to hear those
too!  but, we maybe we should just try to clearly separate the objective
opinions we can fairly voice from our personal beefs.

(2) responding to reviews:
in print mags, i guess this is a letter to the editor, and only the most
coherent or interesting replies get printed.  if what i have to say about
a review isn't of general interest, or is blatantly inflammatory, maybe i
should send it directly to the author.

so, if that made sense to you, cool.  if not, i'm accepting letters to my
editor right now - hit that reply button and flame on!
matt.

Anybody who uses the Accronym PLUR and means it is not going to be your 
person.  You really don't have much sense of the spiritual ravers do 
you?  If you knew what that part of raving was about you would know 
that someone who felt that way wouldn't threaten anybody.  It's 
obviouse that who ever did this is either crazy or just an immature 
practical joker.

As for fanaticism and religion where do you see this?  The spirituality 
of most ravers I've met is anything BUT religion.  In fact it's the 
absence of religion.  The belief that each human is a complete 
individual totaly seperate yet completely united with everything and on 
his or her OWN Path.  There is no religion or organization or 
fanatisism in this.  

At least no more fanatisims than your constant habit of taken  
agressive stances on issues and spreading negative vibe.

That's the day you should go underground.  The people who only put on 
free or very cheap parties are the people who won't go after other 
crews for status.  Underground crews (Gateway, F&F,and many others) are 
doing it for one reason only.  It has nothing to do with money or 
status or being cool or what have you. One reason only.  consiousness 
revolution.

Whew!

Just spent 2 hours wading through the 300 posts that accumulated while I
was away in LA for the past few days. I must say my mind is numb from all
the arguments and counter-arguments and meta-arguments.

What I did not find as I waded through the thousands of words written by
our members over the past few days is much new info about *MUSIC*. I'm
wondering if anyone has gotten their hands on any particularly vicious new
choons lately and would care to share their discoveries with the rest of
us. Any takers?

Also, I'd like to suggest a fresh start. Maybe we could all take a deep
breath, come back to the present, and let go of whatever particular
storyline we happen to be currently preoccupied with.

I'd also like to suggest that we consider doing a *FREE* SFR-sponsored
party in the near future. This would be an excellent opportunity to come
together, reconnect with each other in a direct, personal way, blow off
some steam, and celebrate our mutual passion. I would be more than happy to
lend some organizational energy to this endeavor. If there are any others
interested in this idea, please contact me and lets see if we can make
something happen.

Maybe we could call this party "FRESH START". Just an idea...  =o)

Peace & love,
ek

Chris, it seems that there has always been a small group of people
in the rave scene who have some kind of fear of the spiritual side of 
raving.  They periodically attempt to project an image of intolerance 
and oppression upon those who would try to perpetuate the concepts of
PLUR, as though they are thugs who will hold a knife to your throat
and force you to accept a hug from them or something.  Maybe it's just
because PLUR sounds too much like a slogan, and slogans are too easy
to repeat in a shallow and insincere context.

It also seems that that rave spirituality can come in different
flavors.  For example, I think that the Wicked DJs (especially at the
FMRs) promote a vibe more condusive to an individually intense trip
that is more transcendental, more beyond ourselves, where the journey
you take is more important than the friends you make along the way.  
Unity takes place on another plane of existence with a little 
less of the warm fuzziness perhaps; earthbound smiles don't hurt, but
but may not be quite as important.  Just my perception, this kind of 
thing is very subjective.    

There will always be hypocrisy from people who speak idealistically.
I see it in myself all the time.  I like the PLUR message, yet always 
loving and being at peace with everyone isn't just boring, it also
denies the diversity and balance that makes things *real* for me.
So to some extent, I lack the desire to fully live the ideals I favor.     

I think most people who speak PLUR are really just saying, "let's try 
to focus more on the positive things that bring us together."  Perhaps
there are PLUR fanatics around, but I've never encountered any.  Yes, 
I find it annoying when someone thrusts their grinning face 5 inches
from mine and say "c'mon smile" while I'm dancing.  But somehow, I've
managed to survive such unprovoked attacks.                                   

Overall, I think our scene is blessed with positive energy.  Despite
the occasional sniping and a few scenesters with personal agendas, 
there is still an amazing lack of competition between the parties 
here.  Anyone who thinks that they are going to get anywhere with an 
"us vs them" attitude is sorely mistaken because there does seem to be a 
Karma thing at work - those clued into (at least part of) the community 
vibe instead of just their own seem to have an easier time making good
things happen.

Of course, actions mean more than words.  Like this list: SFRavers get
accused of whining or being negative, yet the true achievement of this 
list has been to bring people together.  Which doesn't mean we all have 
to agree, or even like each other.  It's easy to feel Unity on the dance 
floor with people you never have to talk to.  Here, I have a sense of 
connectedness with people that i don't even *want* to be connected with!  
Now that's significant; and it also happens to be an example of PLUR, 
in *action*, freely chosen by all who care to participate.

Hey

Been noticing everybody seeming kinda down & snippy lately.  A lot of 
people seem unhappy about a lot of stuff, and a lot of people seem 
unhappy about that fact!  Bad vibes, & complaints about bad vibes. I 
was thinking about it last night, and instead of retaliating with more 
complaints about complaints about complaining, I figured I'd start out 
a whole new post on an entirely new subject.  Everything seems awfully 
negative to me at times, not just sfraves, but work, friends, and life 
situations in general.  Sometimes I forget about the stuff that makes 
all that junk worthwhile.  For some reason a List popped into my head 
last night, and that list made me remember why I really love life.  
It's a list of all those things I think are beautiful.  Not just "oh 
that's pretty" beautiful, but the kind of things that give me the 
occasional inkling of understanding as to why I'm really here.  This is 
my list, thought I'd share it if you all don't mind.  

1) The look on someone's face when you give them a small gift for no 
reason (anybody who's ever gotten a cup of water, walked up to some 
unknown raver on the dance floor who just look like they could use 
water, and offered it to them probably knows this feeling!)

2)  The ocean in some parts of the world where the water is so 
incredibly cobalt blue that you just can't believe it's occurred 
naturally.

3)  That place where the ocean meets the sky in the middle of a 
spectacular sunset.

4)  Instantly clicking with someone you just met five minutes ago.

5)  An incredibly good book that goes on for 400 pages.

6)  Scoring that A in a class you really worked your ass off for.

7)  Really understanding that you've only got a limited amount of time 
on this earth with the people you really love (friends, family, 
anybody) and making the most of your time with these people (first part 
can be negative, but the second part is what makes it beautiful to me).

8)  Trees, especially those certain trees that have that ancient 
positive energy older than generations of Man that you can just feel 
when you touch them (those of you who understand this one, you know 
about these trees!)

9)  On extremely rare occasion, finding a person who really lives by 
what they believe in.  A lot of people complain about those who spout 
PLUR and don't live it as well, but honestly, with ravers and the rest 
of humanity, there are very few people who actually live by what they 
believe in.  Don't begrudge, but forgive, those of us who don't do it 
as well, it's not an easy burden to bear for those few who can. 
(preachy but true)

10)  And not least, lying on your bed at 1:00 am some night, listening 
to music, and really understanding what all these things mean to you 
and how they make your life worth living.

Just wanted to share, I apologize for it not being rave-related, but I 
somehow felt that it was needed (for me at least) after what appears to 
be a slump for the list.  We all need to be reminded of those beautiful 
things which make us happy to be here after all is said and done.

Love
Shawna

I went to the sfr party this summer at Bonny Doon that was in honor of Brian
& Laura's wedding. This was before I subscribed to the list, someone else
invited me. When I arrived with my 3 friends, we set up our blanket to the
right of the main crowd. I immediately felt self-conscious, as I felt
everyone was staring at us to try and determine who we were. In spite of this
fact, no one came up to us to say hi or anything. I also felt that everyone
else was being really cliquish in their sub-divided little groups. I don't
know what I expected from an sfr party- I guess I was half hoping to see
everyone holding hands in a big circle and dancing around. I know I should
have taken it upon myself to introduce us; but I was feeling really
intimidated by everyone. I didn't go away from that party with a very good
feeling, but I thought maybe once I am "in the know", it will be easier. 

It is pretty obvious to me that we're kind of stuck with each other here
online. But does that mean when we go to a party, someone says "Oh, there's
so-and-so, the jerk I don't agree with" or is there really a sense of PLUR
among each other? Do we forget all of the disagreements once we're out and
about? This is what I am hoping.... 

I'm sorry I said the sfravers are a bunch of whiners. Obviously this didn't
jibe well with everyone. I thought as long as we're picking apart the scene,
we might as well start with taking a look at ourselves. This seemed to be a
bit too difficult for some people, so I won't be making any more criticisms
of this group. I don't want to wind up in the "most hated" catagory or
something. 

I hope to be at Come/Unity tonight. Look for a very tall man with blonde
hair, and I will be somewhere around there. I am 5'10" with short blondish
hair. I will try to wear my bright ass-yellow Jujyfruits t-shirt. Yes,
wearing my sfr laminate as well with pride. Come by to say hello, or at least
come by say you want to kill me! :-)

Hi,

I need to get in touch with the Planet Rock promoter(s) ASAP (i.e. a few
days before Friday, and it's going to be Wednesday in a couple minutes). Do
any of you have any other number for them besides the voice mail number?
Help!

Thanks,

Wayne

I was there and I'd say that no more than 1/2 the attendees were sfravers.
I introduced myself to at least 5 people I didn't know.  Then I got tired
of the social stuff and spent the rest of the day dancing.

This happens at every party, unfortunately, to varying degrees.  Mainly
it's because people just don't seem to be compelled to leave their
social comfort zones.  But nearly everyone I approached was receptive to
me; except for one person who totally dissed me.  This was a surprise
since I had always thought highly of his net-personality.  I guess the
feeling wasn't mutual.

Uh, er, well, I can feel that way sometimes, though it usually takes more
than a disagreement for me to think someone's a jerk.  But then, some of 
my best friends are jerks.

I think so.  

> Do we forget all of the disagreements once we're out and
> about? This is what I am hoping.... 

No.  Isn't one of the points of PLUR to accept each other even when
we disagree?  One thing I've discovered is that when I'm raving with
people, whatever garbage we may have posted recently seems to mean very 
little compared to what we are sharing at the moment.

Blanket stereotypical statements rarely do.  BTW, if you check the 
archives and did some statistical analysis I'd bet you'd find that by far 
most posts about parties and DJs are positive, sometimes nauseatingly so.    

>  I don't want to wind up in the "most hated" catagory or
> something. 

You'll have to work harder to achieve that.  And even then, no matter
how long-winded, self-aggrandizing, attitude-laden and rave-irrelevant
your posts may be, there will always be someone out there who will like
them.  There's no accounting for taste.

Tied for album of the year: Dave Angel "Tales of the Unexpected" (jazzy,
deep techno that grooves hard) and the Advent LP on Internal (harder yet
also groovy techno and electro that slams over all 4(!) records)

greetings all sfr's!

i'm new on this list, but not to the rave community. it saddens me to read
such a general sense of unsatisfaction of our scene. one common theme being
people feeling isolated even at a party. that sounds hard to believe, but
i've felt this way too. however, i still get the feeling that there's a lot
of positivity and optimism from the people writing these letters. here's an
idea: what about a preparty get-together somewhere in the city (e.g. cafe'
bastille, or somewhere similar to kickit) . This would be a good way for
those of us feeling isolated to get familiar with one another before we rave.
 Just an idea i thought i'd send out there. let me know what you all think
and i hope to meet you sfr's sometime soon.

two fingers and a thumb (peace, I'm out)

Then there are some of us who are just plain kinda shy - like me!  You 
all learned about *that* during that imfamous dj elitist thread I posted. 
(sheesh, I learned my lesson!)  I think that the laminates are a godsend 
in a way, for people like myself who have a hard time just going up to 
people and introducing myself.  With a person I haven't met with laminate 
on or something else similar to me (like a cool tongue piercing!! :P) it 
gives me better grounds to come up and talk to them.  There is already a 
sort of bond.  I am probably the most un-stuck   up person I know, EGO is 
a nasty word in my vocabulary.  It goes both ways, too.  If a person just 
comes up and starts talking to me, I'll talk right back, with happiness.  
Voila my 2 cents.

love love love,
Amy

This was rave related in every sense of the word.....and thank you Shawna 
for that moment of beauty.  I could relate on a personal level, each of 
the points you mentioned.  It brought me back to a moment of peace as I 
try and write 2 term papers today...:O

New hot tracks?  Thought ya'd never ask :)

I agree with Joe, Dave Angel's new album is excellent.  I know
Soundworks has it because I got mine there.  Now that he's dropped
the mad-techno thing and starting making the music he clearly wants
to, it's a new step up.  Excellent, jazzy, deep.

Jacob's Optical Stairway, "Solar Feelings" remixes on R&S.  Nice package,
two *excellent* junglist style remixes from Claude Young. 

Storm the Funk, a three-track EP on Ferox.  Excellent minimalist stuff
without being too cold.

Astral Matrix, "Torture Vibes" and "Pieces."  I know that lots of you
have heard these.  Andrew calls this style "acid lounge" ;-)

Just about anything recently on Direct Beat from Detroit: Aux 88 and
Yanu in particular.  

Freeform Dub, by Simon Pyke, on Skam95.  Check the cool Braille
lettering on the sleeve :)  Excellent EP, this track is the best.
*Real* dub instead of the clanking stuff people are passing off
as "electronic dub" these days.

"Military Jazz," Plug 2, on Rising High.  This is Wagon Christ/Luke Vibert
under a different name.  An excellent mix of well constructed jungle drum
riffs with cool/weird bop jazz breaks.  He was quoted in one of the
magazines saying he was having "too much fun" making jungle tracks and
was forcing himself to go back to work on Wagon Christ projects!

"Pushin' Right Along," Trip ta Funk, on Organico.  I don't know how new
this is but I just got it recently and it's excellent trippy-dub.
I like Sunshine's Thanks and Praise mix especially.  

"Floribunda," Mother
s Pride, on Skinnymalinky (what the hell's a "skinnymalinky"?!).  This
might be one of my two or three favorite records of 1995, along with
LTJ Bukem's "Horizons."  In the jazzy-housey-tribaley groove with an
awesome key shift.  I'm finding a lot more of this loose/jazzy stuff,
the new Atlantic Jaxxx label is good for that too.

"Flight 727," Jay Ray, on Championsound.  Greeeeeen vinyl :)  Excellent
acid-trance, but at the slower Hardfloor pace.

"Techno City 95," Model 500, on Metroplex.  Juan Atkins updates the
classic and gives it a truly amazing atmospheric treatment.  I've mixed
this everywhere from -6 to +4 and it sounds great every time.

I'm not finding a lot I currently like in the standard house/progressive
house vein, but a few here and there.  Kult Records from New York is a
real good label for that right now.  Doran and Paul Grogan's label
Rampant from LA continues to put out high quality releases.  The West
Coast as a whole is jumping right now, I must say!

I'm getting ready to put together another "best of" annual summary.
It's kind of a cliche to do those but it's fun.  '95 has been a weak
year overall for me for new releases, but as always there is a lot of
good stuff when you dig deep enough.

(Note: I have forwarded this to the list, since it's a good question.)

"Clean" musical reproduction at a given power level has a certain
distribution of frequencies (low sounds vs. mids vs. highs).

Distorted reproduction, in the case of overdriven amplifiers, means
clipping: the amp cannot reproduce the peak of the input signal, and
chops off the top and bottom.  This introduces high frequencies into
the sound that were not there before -- if you clip a sine wave (no 
frequencies higher than the fundamental tone) you get a square wave, 
which contains every 2nd harmonic over than the fundamental, i.e. a lot
more highs.

Our ears do not hear high and low sounds equally: they are most sensitive
to the area between 1 KHz and 5 KHz, an area above most musical notes but
smack in the middle of the range of frequencies introduced by clipping.

(This, incidentally, is why it is much easier to hear a whisper than a 
mumble over long distances, and why a distorted rock guitar _sounds_
much louder than an acoustic guitar even though you haven't turned your
stereo up at all.)

Therefore, clipping is taking sound frequencies that were distributed 
in a certain way from low to high, and concentrating much more of them in
the ear's most sensitive range, which can cause an otherwise safe sound
level to become dangerous, or a dangerous sound level to become more painful.

I hope this makes sense,

well amy, you didn't seem all that shy went you came up to me and
introduced yourself (it was at the outdoor thing by sly park, can't 
remember the name).  :-)

to the world: if you don't feel like walking up to someone and introducing
yourself, don't expect someone else to walk up to you and say hi.  But it
sure does feel great when someone does.

here is the challenge:  say hi to at least one stranger a day.  and do
it with a big smile.  you'll be suprised by the reaction.

just wanted to share two of things which reminds me of how wonderfull
the world is:

1)  climbing to the top of the highest thing around (works best if it is
	a mountain) and looking out over everything and knowing that this
	is YOUR world to experience, enjoy, care for, and to love.

2)  waking up cuddled up with the person you love knowing that whatever
	happens today, no matter how bad life gets; you will always have
	that someone there to make it all better and to bring a ray
	of joy into your life.

hugs

Hey Ms. Phink,

I can't believe I've seen something that another sfraver hasn't...in 
Fresno no less.  I saw Dubtribe last summer at SoHo.  It was when I was 
REALLY new to the scene.  

They set up on a low floor level platform.  We all danced around them 
and watched the mixing.  It was incredible!

Hi...   I was thinking of treking to Come/Unity tonight,  but cringe at the
thought of getting dumped out on the street at 4:30 in the morning.

Are there any SFRavers heading out there who live in Marin where I can
hitch a ride back.   There are no busses until 7 am,  and I don't like
the idea of being on the streets until then.   Does anyone know if the
FMR is planned tonight and if so,   I could use a ride from 1015 Folsom
after come/Unity is over...

I think that's a really cool idea.  Since I am not working right now I

I've had the same experience, and I've been to a fair number parties around
here and elsewhere.  In general, I've found rave culture only marginally
more welcoming than various other scenes.  But I'm on the shy side.

This has been out a few months, but I just heard it for the first time
recently: Chemical Brothers, "Exit Planet Dust."  Ripping.  Unfortunately,
I'm not well-versed enough in the arcane minutiae of techno genre
terminology to actually tell you what it is, so you'll just have to listen
to it yourself.

laminates, it would have been more difficult for me just to come up to ya 
and start talking.  When I see an sfraves laminate, it is like an 
automatic ice breaker for me, so for those whom I have met via an sfraves 
laminate, I don't seem shy, but ask me to go up to someone else, who I 
don't know the first thing about, and introduce myself - I get all 
intimidated and I clam up.  Don't know why, I just do. :)  Any others out 
there like that?

Hi all,

        I got a pair of musician's earplugs 6 years ago for use in band
rehearsal's & gigs. They have special attenuators with a very flat response
(they lower the volume without changing the overall balance of sound). I
don't go anywhere without them and would highly recommend them to everyone
on this list. I got mine at UCSF medical center audiology dept. Tony Wills
is the contact there at 415-476-5101. You may think of the $120 they cost
as being too expensive but if you look at it in relation to the very high
possibility of permanent hearing loss I think they are relatively cheap.
Look at it this way, if you pay $10-$15 for each rave, you could cut back a
bit over a few months and easily make up for the $120. That to me is a
small sacrifice for saving one of our most important senses. I think the
organization H.E.A.R. also has special earplugs available which might be
less expensive. Do whatever you must but protect those little ears so you
can continue to enjoy all the incredible music out there.

Love Lydia

hmmm...just have to comment...not to say "you shouldn't have done it that 
way" or anything, cuz you were there and i wasn't and it's really up to 
every individual how they want to deal w/ unwanted sexual advances, but 
my  2Cents is that preserving this boy's "manhood" by complimenting him, 
etc. is not exactly going to teach him not to touch women w/o asking 
first/at least inititating conversation w/ them.  sometimes it does make 
sense to make a situation "worse" if it's going to teaching someone 
something.

all i know is i feel like it's sort of my conditioned response in social 
situations to make everyone, including someone who's put his arm around 
me when i didn't invite it, at ease, instead of being like "yo, excuse 
me!" and i usually feel shitty later if i didn't say something more 
direct.  

i know we're all s'posed ot be all "lovey huggy" at raves, but a lot of 
times i think it's just an excuse for men to get a feel.  i know that as 
i've partied more, i've grown more and more discerning about who's going 
to get a hug.  (and it ain't gonna be someone who whines when i don't hug 
him!)

Do not put words into my mouth.  That is not what I said.

I do, but please, inform me anyway....

Really?  You mean if you buy into the concept of PLUR totally, there is no
chance of you getting religious or fanatical about a concept, no matter how
noble?  Is PLUR really all that infallible that even it cannot be misused?


>It's obviouse that who ever did this is either crazy or just an immature
>practical joker.

I am in no position to asses ones sanity, nor do I know how mature this
person is/was.  For all I know it coulda been Bob Dole who made the call.
Maturity has little to do with a death threat.  Death itself is another
matter.  I think a person made a threat.  You can treat this as heavily or
as lightly as you want.  I would just be sure that the threat is not real
before letting my guard down completely.

>As for fanaticism and religion where do you see this?

The question is, how can you not?

Where there is an idea, there is the possibility of fanaticism.  I would
never be so bold as to second guess human nature.  All people need is a
flag, the color, or slogan after that is just a motivational device.  PLUR
is no exception. No human idea/concept or thought is immune from this IMO.
It's just where we are as a species today.

Or so you perceive.  In any case, I was not the one who made a death
threat, I was not the one who had petty rivalries with promoters, dj's or
whatnot, I was not the one to cry about someone doing a party the same day
as me, I was not the one who disses people behind their backs only to
remain silent when I meet them, I am not the one to talk about doing
something and not do it, I do not level criticism w/o offering a solution
of some sorts.  I dunno, I see more negativity in your indictment than in
mine.



"PLUR my ass!", I said.  What does it mean?:

Maybe I meant that there are fanatics who buy into this concept so much
that maybe they only apply it to their circle of friends.  And if they feel
an external force is acting to the contrary, they see fit to pay
retribution in some form, to defend and pepetuate the ideal as they see it.


Maybe I meant that this scene talks much about ideas and not living up to
them.  PLUR being no exception (I mean c'mon; another flyer reads "Printed
On Recycled Paper" w/ the recylce logo, and another , and another, and
another, all over the floor...oh look, there's another).

Maybe I meant that there are those who have yet to understand and live the
ideal.

Maybe I meant that there are clueless people in our scene, and nobody
attempted to educate them. Or maybe an attempt to educate someone failed.

Maybe I meant PLUR is near impossible in a scene where money is involved
(in this society, money is a constant; no such thing as free, another nice
ideal).

Maybe I was mad.

There are many possibilities.

I don't talk about PLUR, I don't even use that acronym other than here on
the list.  I do however *LIVE*, as close to the ideal as possible, instead
of spouting it as some meaningless group of letters (which mean NOTHING,
NOTHING unless it is lived, not talked about, LIVED!).  I don't use it to
beat people over the heads with as some ideal we should all strive for.
Nope, I have always thought, the best way to aspouse an ideal is to live
it.  Nothing is more genuine than that.  You gotta walk the walk, or make a
good attempt to.

In any case, thanks for the reply, and the feedback.

Peace out,
John


A real indictment, if you wanna call it that:
What I find funny, the level of criticism raised against some who question
others complete misinformation, yet allow people to use the word "gangstah"
with near impunity.  Also amusing is the way people allow such
disinformation to be debated as though it were truth, and when some people
ciriticize the dis/misinformation, they are the ones labelling others
"negative" or "vibe killers" (is labelling PLUR?). Another rib-tickler is
how people find the tiniest thing to crticize here in our scene, and yet
remain so myopic as to not see the variety that surrounds them (remember
the "there's no techno in SF", stuff a short while ago?).  One for the
funny bone is how any negative comment, even if it is, god forbid,
constructive, is once again labelled "negative" for no other reason than it
said something contrary to others beliefs.

I dunno...I just wanna take a shower, I'm going out to dinner.

Ciao!

Subject: Solution to a plague that will divide us all
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

My brothers and sisters,

After some self-examination, and introspection, along with some of my own
brand of self-criticism, I have come to a conclusion;I am a hypocrite.

I have for years preached the credo, I have even lived the credo of which I
spoke, but I have come to realize, that even after all of this, my deep
faith in my own lived convictions was but an edifice; it must be dealt
with.

Yes, I have talked, and even acted on my own behalf in this matter, but I
have NOT, I repeat, NOT taken any ACTION to make my deeds a reality, a
tangible reality.  So I confess to you, my brothers and sisters, so that I
may find some compassion within you, that I might find the will and
strength to take that final step.  Yes, that final step from living my
words, to acting on my words.  Making my words *LIVING ACTION*. I like to
call my step, LA for short, but bear with me, please.  I have been remiss,
and I will correct my mistake with great vigor.

For years I have lived and breathed the credo, now I offer my soltution for
one and all.  A solution to a plague that will, eventually, destroy the
house we have all built.  Yes, my brothers and sisters,  I am taking my
credo and making it real.  BBYR, or better said "Bathe Before You Rave",
will now be a reality at every event I attend!

For years, now I have taken showers or baths in preperation for my long
nights of crackerjacking and raving.  My preperation has guaranteed a
certain comfort level, to those around me for 8 hours straight (or 8 hours
gay as it may be) while dancing, and most certainly for the 4 hour brain
cooldown at various dens on iniquity (like the onld DNA).  From here on in,
all of you, especially my most odiferous, funk laden,
sosmellynotevensageorganjacansupressthaFUNK, bothers and sisters can rest
assured, that I will act.

LABBYR - Live Action Bathe Before You Rave

I will:

-Notify my brtheren of thier funk, lest they sin against thy neighbor.
-At holiest of holies events I will carry perfumes, soaps, and other sundry
items to releive my bretheren of thier plague, so that their days might be
long, and odor free.
-At holiest of holies, bring in at least 2 portable showers, and baths for
those who offend, to continue to attend.  So sayeth me.
-Provide for thy bretheren that which they may not possess; give them water
and soap.
-Provide copius incense for those unknowing of the offense they offer their
bretheren.
-Be kind in the notice, but quick in the delivery of the cleansing.  Do
unto them, as you do unto yourself everyday.
-Be sure to bring a high powered water hose; for some funk of thy neighbor
may require drastic measure, so sayeth me.
-And lastly, a sprinkle a day helps keep odor away.

Oh yes my brothers and sisters, I do have a calling, and cleanliness before
raving is thy name!

Yours in the wash,
The Reverend Chief Boot Nocka

I seal my covenant with thee, now pass the Irish Spring!


A quick note:
You know, I have wondered what in the hell happened to my booty and bra
girls of late.  Man, I remember many an e filled night watching hte bodies
of so many fine sisters and sistahs shaking, moving, and grooving, in
nothing but underwear (usually cheap, unless they are a dancer or something
;).  Of late this hardly happens, even if it's friggin' 150 F in the place.
And it was through examining this that I figured out the reason, and came
up with the pact of cleanliness I share with you all.  The reason is sweaty
unshowered shirtless brothers and brothas, plain and simple.  Hell, if *I*
was a B5 kickin' betty, I damn wouldn't want some smelly dude trying to;
freak me, talk to me, bump into me with his sweaty chest.  And why do guys
see it so fit to take of their shirts in the first place?  I guess it's one
of the unsolved mysteries of our time!  I guess the booty and bra bettys
will come back when dudes decide to clean up their act; literally!


Many smiles to you all! :):):)

And yes, I'm a bit anal about the whole thing, but damn, my shit rarely
stinks! ;)

Peace out,
John

This is a great idea.  It is also kind of what a lot of us envision for 
the New Full Moon party that is now in its third month.

What we want to do with the Communal Full Moon is bring together lots of 
different groups with different sounds, such as gateway, sfraves, friends
and family- which has always been a very sfraves-oriented party but 
includes lots of people, hence the name...), new moon, frequency 8, j & k 
sound, to name a few of the tribes that are involved.

Central again to the fledgeling full moon is the idea that we give lots
of dj's, lots of styles, a chance to be heard.  Techno and electronic
music is evolving SO FAST right now.  I don't want to miss a thing.

Love,

Ann

is very important to me, in fact it's sacred. So when I see people being 
kinda laksadasical with regard to the event, I find it very 
disrespectful. So that's why?, I have a 103.5 fever right know and I'm 
still going, by the way can anyone pick me up from Emeryville, very 
close, call me I woun't be logging back on tonight, telephones in sig below.

IMHO Spirituality is the Direct Experience of the Divine, once you
start to put it into words and point of view it becomes Religon.

A couple of years ago, when I was in my speaker tweeker phase
(as some of you remember :). I remember one night when I had my head in a 
bass bin:) and there was this guy next to me and we were both totally
grooving to this fairly hard Techno song (It was a Toon Town :) and
we both looked each other in the eyes and each of us Knew, and each of
us knew that the other Knew, and it was the most Beautiful Thing;
that, for me, is the spirituality behind the experience of raving, now
when I talk about it, even the assertion that I just made about it,
well, then it becomes something religeous (or at least philosophical).

I still see that guy every now and then at parties and we both remember
each other and that experience, we generally give each other a big hug,
(and if you saw this guy, you wouldn't think we were friends, he doesn't 
look like a "raver", he looks more like someone on 90210 and hugging a big
black guys would seem to definitely be out of charecter for him :)
but for me, he demonstrates more Peace Love Unity and Respect by his 
actions then I have seen by folks' actions around here of late, (myself 
included). When we see each other, we both still know that the other Knows.
We don't talk about it or give it a name or acronym or anything but the
experience bonds us and it always will, till we're both 90 years old.

So true, witness what just happened a few days ago with the FMR, I, 
feeling in the right come up against some other folks who also feel
in the right, (this is how wars start folks).  Now both sides are "good"
people, (and I really mean this, as far as the whole FMR thing, I know
Claire et. al. and she truly is a wonderful person)  I also know that
I am not an evil person and I know many of the wicked crew and they are not
evil people, but guess what? When we all decide that we are right in our 
stance, then we do really stupid things, we seperate ourselves from the
"evil ones" (first mistake, evil is a disease, it can infect anyone and 
any society, do you believe that even the majority of the population
of Nazi Germany were evil people? I bet not, but look what happened to 
them because they went along with a bunch of people who thought (with some
convoluted logic) that they were doing the right thing), make them wrong
and ourselves right and seek to destroy the external evil instead of 
eradicating it from our own hearts.

John is a warrior, he has strong opinions and voices them. I have never
heard him say anything negative about anyone that he would not say to their
face, IMO this is a good trait that many could follow, we don't always agree
but then I know at most times EXACTLY where john is comming from, most
peple are covert in their aggression, John is out with it and then it's over.
If john is going to make a death threat, he will make it to your face,
not call you up on the phone anonnymously :)

Some folks have to realize that there are some people around who have been
going out for a very long time, jsl, even though he doesn't go out too
often anymore did his fair share of "jackin" and has been a party promoter
both here and in L.A. (I'm not sure about the L.A. part :) He used to do 
parties with the late Will Hicks who some of you dearly remember, most of 
these events happened before many of you subscribed, during a time when
PLUR was experienced as opposed to being talked about, (in fact, this list
is the only place that I have ever heard it used :).  He like I, know
many of the people who are the "ring leaders" of the SF Scene, there are
events, situations, alliances, love affairs, break-ups, feuds, politics
(all the elements of human nature) that cause many of the events that
shape what some refer to as Our Scene, 99% of the people on this list
know less than 1% of all of these actions, which are the primary shaping
forces behind what everyone else perceives. I, who know many of the players
only know maybe an order of magnitude more (which brings my knowledge
to about 10% :), when I was going out three times a week (a necessity,
if you want to REALLY be in the know), maybe I knew about 30% of all of the
stuff, but believe me there are somethings that I wish that I could have 
stayed naieve about (and I'm sure JSL can support that). Most of these 
things can't be talked about on the list for various reason, some things
are very personal and would ruins people's lives, some things might land 
people in prison or worse, sometimes some of it leaks through, (like the
death threats which I should not have posted about, sorry Garth :) and
it always gets distorted and twisted and turned into a religeous argument :)

I'd like some response to the track 'entangled' by P.A. on Deviate recordings. It's a 
massive undergroundhit over here and it's going to be remixed by Carl Craig. Do any of you
know the track??

But since the "Divine" exists in everything, wouldn't any direct
experience/connection with music, people, nature, etc. be spiritual?
Surely you're not suggesting "You either see God or you don't".

> when I talk about it, even the assertion that I just made about it,
> well, then it becomes something religeous (or at least philosophical).

Yeah, PLUR is really a philosophy.  And (while I'm harping on 
definitions) religion is the institutionalization of spiritual philosophy.
I don't think PLUR has been institutionalized in the scene - there's
no structure of enforcement, or written doctrine, or any established
protocols of implementation beyond "let's try to be nicer to each other."
How frightening.  Am I missing something?

Very true.  I guess I no longer build my opinions around worst case
scenerios.  3 days ago I received a phone call from someone trying to
convert me to Christianity.  She took my name from the phonebook because
"it looked Jewish".  This incident reaffirmed my distrust for *anyone* 
who touts the name "Jesus" because in my experience such people seem to
be more prone to fanaticism.  Yes, *any* idea can be used abusively.  So 
should we distrust of all people who express ideas?

> [good 'ol days drivel deleted]
> PLUR was experienced as opposed to being talked about,

Why do you see these "opposing" one another.  Is it wrong to try to
talk about our experiences?  Or must these these amazing feelings
remain only in the unspoken realm of "knowing looks".  I agree that
words limit and reduce the meaning of such abstract concepts.
Nevetheless, the path to understanding and enlightenment can't 
always be pristine.  I also don't believe that our everyday verbal
plain of existence is something distinct and separate from the
spiritual.

>(in fact, this list
> is the only place that I have ever heard it used :).

It gets debated on other rave lists as well as alt.rave.  Maybe
PLUR is just a net thing, which (surprise) is limited to mostly words.
It has always been a criticism of computer & net users that we
use this technology *instead* of actually experiencing life.  Well
here we all are... these lowly words must be doing something for us.  

> > "PLUR my ass!", I said.  What does it mean?:

Agreed :)

> "Action!, not words"

Let's remember that Communication is an action, too. :)

ummm... cos it's hot? or could it be cos we're hot?  or 
maybe it's got sumptin to do with how hot it is? or mebbe
'cos we're dancing and it's hot... :)

added to that is the hope that other ravers are forgiving

Consider getting a professional outboard compressor and/or "tube
distortion" box. These typically fit into a single rack space.

Depending on how fancy you get, you can find units that give you the
kind of compression/distortion you get from recording a really hot
signal onto an analogue tape (a weird electromagnetic hysteresis effect
that is kinda hard to reproduce electronically), soft limiting, or
guitar fuzz (aka tube distortion). sometimes these functions are
combined into multi-effects boxes, but IMHO, a real tube or FET driven
into distortion sounds far more euphonic than the 90's digital
equivalent from a multi-efx box. However, if you do use a vacuum tube
(it's actually a very simple circuit if you're an electronics buff)
remember that it may sound pretty strange in live situations because
vacuum tubes can act like microphones when they get vibrated by bass
(gives you feedback).

oh, as with all pro audio equipment, this shit ain't cheap.

poke around in http://www.sweetwater.com and you may find what you
need. sign up for their catalog so you can drool over all the latest
audio stuff that you can't afford...

I don't usually dress up because i go to raves so I can dance. And when
I dance hard for hours on end, I sweat like a pig. So simple clothing
(e.g. t-shirt, light pants) are in order lest i want to come out
looking like a drowned rat in the morning.

Show me a well ventilated party where they keep the windows open all
night, let you walk in and out, and I'll be far more inclined to wear
some weird clothes. All my raving experiences have shown me that this
is probably the hardest thing to predetermine, so I just wear stupid
lamo clothes that I feel comfortable in while sweating.

And yeah, maximum respect goes out to those that can wear weird clothing,
dance like maniacs, and come out looking fresh in the morning. I can't.

I don't know about you or other sfraves, but an overabundance of
perfumes and incense can give me a major splitting headache, get me
sneezing and my eyes watering, etc. I guess this is just another in a
long list of allergies. At least foul smelling BO doesn't do that to
me. 

So in addition to John's list, please, if you can't take a shower,
please don't bathe yourself in cologne. It can really do a number on
some of us.

Better yet, how about having raves in venues where there's adequate
ventilation and some reduction of crowding. I thought last weekend's
wicked @ 174 King street was nasty for those reasons. ANd when
everybody feels like a caged rat breathing someone elses anal vapours,
it gets hard to let the vibe flow.

With  all this talk of shirtless stinky men, I have to admit to 
some Iron Johnesk sexual exitement.  Just kidding.  But I do pre
fer the stink of three day old hippie to the men who bathe themselves
in shitty ass colone( Brute, Old Spice, Or some other shit).
Maybe the real reason that John is not finding the BRa/booty
factor is that women do not what to deal with the sexual 
advances from immature Horn dogs.
Parties with showers are a great thing though, as long as
everyone respects each other.
Another note about odors- Burritos are not an acceptable 
pre-party dinner.

Dropped the mad-techno thing? He's always done jazzy, deep tracks, except
for maybe the 1st Voyage w/CJ Bolland on R&S. The New Orchestrations EP on
FNAC, The Family EP on Apollo, and the Royal Techno EP on Rotation are all
beautiful records.

I just got a new shipment from Detroit, and the Electronic Warfare double
on Underground Resistance is an excellent collection of electro and techno
grooves.

For mellower techno vibes grab the Titonton EP on Metamorphic (Dan Curtin's
label) There's one absolutely stunning slightly acidic track on there that
really swept me away upon first listen.

For straight up dancefloor eruption check out the two releases on Dirty
House records (Australia via Detroit).

In a local vein, Darren and La Paix have done an excellent three-tracker to
be released by SFRaver and F&Fer Jamie Spence on his own Belief Systems
label. A new definition of the San Francisco sound - if you blindfolded me
I would have sworn this was a Pure Plastic or Plink Plonk record. It should
be out in a month or so - bug your local store to get some copies.

Cool...

In one day I've received 16 offers of assistance for doing a FRESH START
party to help bring our community together. After discussing it with my
girlfirend Veronika tonight, I will post details for an initial meeting at
my place for interested folks. I live downtown at 2nd & Mission, so it is a
fairly central location for a meeting. If we do it in the evening parking
is very easy.

Look for my post with details later.

peace,

I love this list.

First mudslinging, then fingerpointing, then reconciliation, and
finally...concensus? 

Perhaps, at least until the next "thing" urks someone.

I was talking to someone I bumped into the other day on Hippy Hill in GG
park. The subject came up of "the underground". The quote was made:

"San Francisco... just a bunch of alternative idealists..."

Hmmm....  ;)
 

So I get this email. EDF has it worked out that all you need to do to
complain to the Feds about things is send an email to their new service. It
then gets turned into a fax and sent to the appropriate person. Now I have
no excuse not to bitch to someone. 

Gotta love modern technology.

The other day, on a whim I picked up "S.U. Corporation Presents Dub
Plate Selection" STHCCD15. (S.U. Corporation are the people that put
out strictly hardcore and strictly undeground compilations). I picked
it up at Reckless for $28.50 and I was thinking to myself, you are a
complete ninny for paying this much for a single UK import CD.

But then I got it home, and now I can't get it off my CD player.

It's got a nice mix of really fast beats, fast sequencer trix (gating/
echoes/reverses etc) combined with dubby effects, people with jamaican
accents saying things like "come selectah", occasional house diva
vocals, and slow melodic/bass riffs. I guess you could call it jungle
or drum&bass, except that most jungle bores the shit out of me -- this
doesn't, because the dub factor makes it musically interesting.
Bass-ically, it makes me want to dance around the house, turn it up to
deafening volumes, and when I'm in my car, I tend to find myself
driving over 90MPH when I listen to it.

Track List (*'s denote my favorites):

1. (*) Selecter -- Gangster Sound (Dub Plate)
2.  How Many Ways -- Just Intelligence (Dub Plate)
3. (*) We Come Back -- Drum & Bass (exclusive dub plate remix)
4. (*) Big Request -- Gangster Sound (Exclusive Dub plate remix)
5. Illusions -- A Sides (exclusive dub plate remix)
6. (*) Sax -- Jazz Vibes (exclusive dub plate remix)
7. Exclusive -- Xclusive (exclusive dub plate remix)
8. Volcano Style -- Urban Jungle (dub plate)
9. Fire -- BDP (dub plate)
10. (*) Feel Good -- The Dominion (dub plate)
11. (*) No War Business -- Xclusive (dub plate)
12. Searchin Hard -- Uncle 22 (dub plate)

I actually like the tracks produced by Drum and Bass and Gangster Sound
the best. #4 has some really outlandish mixing going on, stuff that I
would never think would work together (really fast beats combined with
a slow disco bop) slid together with niceness. #6 is acid jazzy with a
twitchy beat; kinda strange/interesting... #11 is a harsh & noize laden
onslaught of dub that rocks hard and then goes into this smooth piano
riff that floats you away while the vocals have some guy in a jamaican
accent talking gibberish about rude boys, wickedness, and "no war"... 

Where should I look for more trax by these artists?? Which DJs are
likely to play this style of music in the bay area??

Other things I'd like to find on this label:
	* Illegal Pirate Radio volume 3 (STHC CD 9)
	* Intelligent Drum and Bass volume 2 (STHC CD 12, 13)
	* Ravelation live at Wembley "easter bank holiday '95" (STHC CD 11)

Anybody seen these in the Bay Area? Where?

Yeah, yeah!

I'm so timid when I'm in big groups of people... So I retreat into myself
and close my eyes and just dance... but still trying to overcome shyness,
so maybe that's why I like going out-- Just trying to get over some
shortcomings and have fun.

we had a piped-in broadcast from JPL here at work; about a half-hour
  ago, the Galileo probe entered the Jovian atmosphere (3:15 PST)

there are _NO_ pictures coming back, unfortunately; the probe was too
  small to fit a camera in it; however the mother craft in orbit has a
   set of cameras, so maybe we'll se something from it.

the probe is already gone; indeed, it had melted only just after the
  first telemetry reached earth, due to the propagation of light from
    jupiter on the other side of the sun (over 600 million miles away)
going down thru jupiter's atmosphere is like going through 3 or 4 separate
  earth-ian atmospheres, although composed of hydrogen, methane, and
    even water vapor...
after that, the vapors get so dense they are more like water; that's 
  when the probe started to heat up, supposedly; after that, the
    temperature in the inner atmosphere(s)/ocean(s) gets so high, that
      the parachute on the probe starts to melt; and then the aluminum
        parts on the probe melt, too.

telemetry from the spacecraft still in orbit will be relayed back all
  during december and into january; there's the problem of jupiter going
    behind the sun, which will blank out telemetry possibly for a time,
      so it's redundantly being sent back to earth again in january

lemme tellya folks, that's one remote location!  can you imagine a
  rave on a hovering platform somewhere in the upper atmosphere, with
    rainbow-colored clouds above and below as far as the eye can see.....

Not to mention lightning bolts hundreds of miles long, arcing from storms
thousands of miles tall!

When people ask me if I have any really far-out plans for my life, my usual
answer is, "Go hang-gliding in the storms of Jupiter."  It's a big universe
out there, and who knows where we'll all be in 50 or 100 years?

One thing, though--wherever humans are, music and parties will also be
there....

I've seen this asked before, but never read an answer:

What does it look like...or where can one obtain one (sfr laminate)?

Subject: Protest!

If you haven't heard already, we are organizing a protest against the
Communcations Decency Act and the impending removal of our First Amendment
rights on the Web.  Although we are still in the planning stages, the basic
idea is to have a demonstration at noon in South Park on Monday, December
11.  We want speakers, we want media attention, we want a huge turnout of
angry Americans making themselves visible *outside* of cyberspace.

We need help doing this:  We need people to volunteer their time this
weekend to help us make signs and fliers.
We also need to spread the word so that we can have a protest large enough
to receive national media attention. We have the most powerful
communication tool in the world at our fingertips - lets use it to spread
the word and stop Netizens from being apathetic about their rights.

We need everyone to take a few minutes of their time to back us. The
freedom of the medium that we work in is on the line.  So are our rights as
American citizens.  If you can help with anything, please contact Todd
Lappin (our point man at telstar@hotwired.com) and let him know exactly
what you can help us with.

Thanks.

I've been chained to a computer at work, so I haven't been able to listen to
as much of my cool vinyl as I would like, but when I do, stuff that's been
sneaking onto the tables with regularity is:

Alec Empire -- Generation Star Wars (Mille Plateaux)

Ace props to Minor for recommending this one to me. This is very high in my
list of best albums of 1995. Fucked-up acid, fast swing-beat hardcore,
bizarre breakbeats, and occasional moments of wickedly beautiful melody.
Nothing like anything you'll hear at parties in SF, but one of the best
mutant techno albums I've ever heard.

Spooky -- Stereo (Generic)

Once upon a time, Spooky were part of the near-legendary Guerilla
progressive-house stable (along with React 2 Rhythm, DOP, and Superreal),
and cranked out many tracks (including the near-legendary "Little Bullet" in
all its incarnations) that were at various points West Coast staples.
Therefore, I was very (pleasantly) surprised to discover that they've
completely changed directions. The lead, eponymous track on this EP is an
amazing piece of breakbeatish melodic trance. It always gets me dancing
around the apartment (a neat trick, that, considering how cramped my
apartment is).

Accelerator -- Accelerator II (Reload)

I know for a fact that much of the msuci that I spin irritates SF crowds.
Well, this is some of the stuff that irritates people the most and I LOVE
it. Cold, dark sterile techno with fucked-up beats and ominous sounds. This
music is the exact antithesis of everything warm and cuddly, and it does
something weird to my head. I totally dig this shit, and someday you will
too. :) I don't give up easily.

Mike Dearborn -- Razor Sharp / Moments (Djax Up-Beats)

Tons of traxxy uptempo Chicago acid. If any of you know and love Armani,
these doublepacks will both get to you. They were surprisingly cheap at
Rasputin's, and they're full of solidly-constructed, designed to mix
songs. That said, they gain most of their value in the mix, and aren't
exactly great for home listening.

V/A -- Supermarkt (Disko B)

A great compilation of stylish, minimalistic German hardcore and techno.
Among the numerous DJ Hell collaborations (I really don't think that guy
makes any of his own music -- the styles on his tracks are too disparate,
and every track lists different writers) are some totally bizarre tracks by
people like Patrick Pulsinger (a master of lo-fi, dirty acid) and Robert
Gorl (formerly of that wacky group DAF -- anybody here remember
them?). Again, this stuff is hard, stripped-down, and fast.

Felix da Housecat -- Thee Metropolis Present Day (Radikal Fear)

Felix Stallings is an amazingly prolific guy, and I like almost everything
he does. His music spans the house spectrum -- from deep through fruity
through acid through hard. "Thee Metropolis" is an excellent and
representative cross-section of his sound. There are some cool diva tracks,
some interesting experiments with sound, and some patented Felix
weirdness. Great for home listening late at night.

Hard Hop Heathen -- Bastik Beats (Concrete)

Man, I remember when Omar Santana was busy trying to convince the East Coast
that he was the Dark Lord of Hardcore. It's funny to hear his recent stuff
in that light -- Bastik Beats is funked-out hard hop indeed, but it floats
along at an amiable 115 BPM and really isn't that different from what the
Chemical Brothers and Depth Charge have been up to recently. It's a montage
of old hip-hop samples put together with skill and precision, and is very
much tilted towards the dancefloor.

For you CD / cybertrance fans, I have one sterling recommendation:

V/A -- Trancesylvania 4 (23 Frankfurt)

If the Frequency 8 folks (hello!) don't have this one in stock, pester them
to get it. I was lucky, and got my copy for $8.99 at the Tower outlet down
the block. The compilation is 3 CDs full of Goa-style music. After looking
at the weird little squiggles on the CDs, I've decided that the three discs
are broken down along house, trance, and acidtrance lines, but they're very
loosely grouped. The types of music represented are breathtaking -- from the
stripped-down house of Future Sound of Lisbon through the outta hand
speedtrance of Ravers' Nature. I don't normally get into the whole Goan
sound, but I really like this compilation. The people putting it together
obviously care about what went onto the compilation, and it made the
all-nighters I've pulled in the last week that much easier to deal
with. Artists on the compilation include the Prodigy, Joey Beltram, Felix da
Housecat, Emmanuel Top, and a whole slew of German trance artists. It's
worth getting for the Ravers' Nature track, which would ordinarily be the
sort of track that makes me reach for my gun, but for some reason this one
works for me -- 180 BPM and insanely cheerful.

yrz,
ozy

Hello all,
       I know I don't contribute much to the sfrave community but right now I
would deeply appreciate some love or friendship or support sent my way.  I
was just in a car accident, not my fault, but I feel scared, guilty, and
depressed.  Although I don't have any injuries other than a sore neck and
chest(when I sneeze) my 87' Camary station wagon does not look so good.  I
know from being on the list for several months most(if not all) of you are
compassionate people so I feel more comfortable talking to you than my
friends(?).
OK, enough whining, I just needed to say something.

Thank you,

        Well, i sort of used to be like this. Sometimes i still am
(depending on my surroundings) but here's a little mini-revelation (or is
that ravelation? haha) that has allowed me to become more extroverted.
        One time i was at a party and ended up talking to one of the djs (a
pretty big name from the detroit area) and i was nervous and it was just
worse when he seemed to be really snobby. Every time i talked i thought "oh
shit, that sounded dumb" or "that sounded weird" or something but
eventually i realized that he wasn't a snob, he was even more shy than i
was! Eventually we started really talking, had a beer and found out that we
both went to the same grade school in Guelph, Ontario :) I almost lost it!
ha ha He says "oh and you rememebr Miss Collins? i got the strap from her!"
and i said "me too!"
        Ok, enough tangents, the thing that i realized though is that being
confident about yourself is partially knowing yourself, and your good
qualities and partially realizing that often the way in which you envision
someone else affects your behaviour and words. Like when i was talking to
this guy i was thinking "shit, this is the same guy who did ____" or
whatever and i really built him up, but when you see everyone on an equal
footing as you, just different, everyone has something valid to say, and
everyone's experiences and thoughts are valued (at least by me :) or i sure
do try!)
        Most of all here's a crucial, but simple revelation: if you go up
to soemone and start talking to them just in the name of friendliness
(lecherous come-ons might be an exception to this) and they dis you or
brush you off there's a number of things that may be going on:
        1)they are shy
        2)they're a dork (but no-one is a dork forever :) )
        3)they're lost in their own thoughts (and/or are on something that
isn't conducive to talking.)

        I know from personal experience what all three are like, for #2 i
can only feel bad for them not feel hurt because THEY are the ones that are
missing out on the most amazing thing about life: other people. :)
        For #1 what i try my best to do is make people feel at ease and not
seem intimidating, that's the worst when you're shy :( When someone just
_listens_ to what you have to say it means a lot, right? is anyone
listening? hahaha
        well, i hope this helped some people, i know that i spent too many
years of my life avoiding eye contact, walking with my face down, blushing,
etc etc and relying on things to pump me up enough to be able to talk to
people.
        And when i meet some of you, don't worry, i won't bite (unless i'm
payed well that is ;)
        peace,
                brad

        That's me too, though i do my best to go out and actually start up
conversations with people (knowing that if i dont' do it i shouldn't expect
others to) but about Ego, it's weird, i've been realizing that it's pretty
useless in the big picture and a lot of it is what cuts us off from each
other. Ego is the simple statement of "this is where i am and you are not"
you know? When you are egoless (which is, for me, synonymous with ecstatic
and not necessarily pharmaseutically based too :) you are at one with
everything, you don't worry about going up and talking to someone because
they're just a part of you! :) Egos and the conscious/rational part of your
mind structures a lot of your life so you can get shit done but i try my
best not to cling to these arbitrary things too much :)

  OK, not exactly....
  But if you want to see some VERY cool animations of the probe entering 
Jupiter, download the big mpegs fro:

         http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/countdown/index.html#anim

  I know this post isn't really rave related. But I'm one of the folks who 
believes that such explorations are major advances for the human race; 
and the images returned from these voyages are important icons in the 
human quest for transcendence -- like those first shots of the entire 
earth from outer space.
  I wonder if anyone has thought of doing a rave light show utilizing 
these images, with music to matych?

there is a lot of jungle that falls into the above category...in fact, im
surprised that you haven't heard more of it by now.....to everyone...here
my list of all the dj's i know of who play almost all jungle in the Bay
Area:
*starEyes (myself)-mostly hardstep and some intelligent and ragga,as well
as old breaks
*Alex- up and coming intelligent selector...maximum respect
*Thad- darkside master...rollin deep
*Flux- the mash up sounds of the hardstep
*Siobhan
*U.F.O.
*Jonah Sharp- ambient jungle?
*Ocean
*Gamall
*Barry (Primal)-harder stuff, i think
*Malcolm (Primal)-all different styles
there are a couple more i'm sure but i don't know them
anyone who wants to hear some different styles check out me and Thad at
'Nuff Respect...Saturdays...Your Mama's Cafe...Oakland...5-9...also over
Christmas break Alex and Thad will be taking over for us there....

>stuff on thi s label...i hesitate to recommend the comps i like cuz i am
>still not sure what style you like...i guess mixtapes would be better....
If you are looking for things with a lot of ragga toasting...like if you
are into the dancehall turned jungle vibe than the top cat vs. general levy
album is pretty decent..it gets a little tiring listening to all that
toasting...shy fx's album is supposed to be good...also D'Cruze's and T
Power's new one....anyone who has more questions on certain jungle CD's or
DJ's..feel free to e-mail me and i will probably be able to sort you out
with some info....:) good luck...and happy bopping all :)

**starEyes**
Biggin' up da jungle vibe '95
maximum respect la massive, chicago, london massive SEEN!

The friendly SF-Raves laminate guys Vince(vince@vmar.com) and 
Wayne(wayne@club.net) Or look for them at parties sporting phallic

   Well, I failed my duty this week. I missed Come/Unity and didn't get
   too many new flyers for this week. (the line was too long) 
	
   I'll try to pick some flyers up Friday morning and send out an addendum. 
   There seems to be quite a bit of stuff on the list anyway; maybe Chrysalis
   will be the pick of the litter. Some of the other parties may be good,
   but like like $20 affairs.

'Sup everybody,

I'd like to hold an initial meeting at my place this coming Monday at 8pm.
A number of people offered to DJ and or help with carrying out various
tasks as necessary. For the sake of efficiency I'd like to suggest that we
try to keep this meeting to people that have experience and or resources
for putting a party together (i.e. people with knowledge of
locations/logistics and people with access to equipment like sound, lights
and visuals).

I would appreciate if people interested in attending would respond to me
via email so I have some idea of how many folks to expect. If there are
people who really want to come but can't make it at that time, let me know
ASAP. If there are many folks in that situation I'll try to reschedule, but
I'd like to know by tmrw night.

My address is:
604 Mission (@ 2nd)
Suite 111
It says LUMIN/SHARP on the buzzer.


anyway, gotta go eat now I'm out for now...

peace,
ek

I was wondering just exactly that myself a couple of raves ago!  Really 
regretted not being male at that second for that particular reason, was 
extremely hot in the shirt I was wearing.

Hey, here's the get down fer me....

I like to dance, and dance hard. Just ask the many of yous that have seen or
met me. I enjoy groovin to a state of satori, which is attainable with or
without drugs.  But, the body is just like any other mechanism that once gets
running for extended periods of time...gets hot.

I get hot, 
               filthy, 
                         sweaty, 
                                      gooey hot.  
I look like a wet chicken...

So what is one to do.  Hmmmm....  I take off my shirt.  at least my
persperation evaporates at a quicker pace that way...  Sorry to the ones I
offend who think im trying to "strut my stuff".  I'm just trying to cool
down.  I mean I also dance with my shoes of at times... It's not to show of
my cool guy toes, nor is it to send stinky fumes into the crowd....  I feel
more comfortable being one with mother earth that way and I also am able to
keep my dexterity in check as well...

So, for what it's worth,  Im not one of the beautiful people... I get dirty.
 Get dusty. 
I kick up sand and make a mess of myself...  But the most important aspect
is... I have a good time...

Peace and peanutbutter,


Adam

Hello everybody,

Last night, starting about 11, the Communal Full Moon project got 
underway at an East Bay location.

The party was a renegade, and there was some worry about whether the 
officers of the law might chase us away from our choice spot under some 
trees by the water.  There were some patrol cars spotted nearby, but the 
music was low enough and there were no cars parked close by, and so their 
suspicions were not aroused.  The voicemail instructed us to park a ways 
from the party, and there were people on hand to tell those that came to 
close where to park.

At the party's peak, there were maybe 150-200 people there.  A good 
number, with many newer ravers in attendance.  I talked with some who 
told me about  their perspective on the rave idea and what party's should 
be about.  Such as music and dancing and enjoying life!

The biggest treat of the evening for me was getting to hear Mars, of 
Frequency8, play.  I'd never heard him before, and he lived up to what my 
friend M. had told me- that he rocked her world the other night at 
Tecknotica.  (sorry if i spelled it wrong!)  He played for a solid two 
hours and maybe more.

After Mars, another dj played.  Unfortunately, I didn't get her name, but 
I liked her set, as well.  Housey, but fast with a little trippy jazzy 
stuff thrown in, as well.  Then Robbie Hardkiss- I think it was him!- 
went on.  Again, a good set from an ace dj.  I liked the way he 
controlled the energy of the music.  Slow, even, mellow for a time, then 
a slow build to faster, higher energy stuff.  It was perfect for the time 
of day- about 4 in the morning or so.  It was music that was kind to my 
tired, happy body.

By then most everyone was laying about on completely soaked blankets, 
talking and enjoying each other and the music.  There were a few people 
dancing- including Robbie!- who was having a blast.

Just before dawn, the organizers called everybody to the spot in front of 
the dj for a vision circle.  One person was the moderator- he had 
experience with this kind of role and he led us through a short 
meditation and said a few words about the chi, and the energy each person 
has to work magic in his or her own life.  Without going on and on, he 
let us in on a secret to living well, which I much appreciated.

The party organizers also explained a bit about what raving is about to 
them.  My friend Todd talked about wanting to see more recycling at 
raves, mostly the water bottles that always turn up by the tens or 
hundreds when the party's over.  One person talked of having been part 
of the rave community for many years- and having gone through a period of 
not liking it, because it didn't seem to be heading in a positive 
direction.  He said that friendship restored him.
  
One person talked about what the vibe- everybody who has been 
to a rave has some idea of what this is and what it feels like- and how 
the vibe is what makes a party good or not-so-good.  Once you've been to 
or have helped out with a lot of parties, I guess your idea of what this 
is- and of how to create it- gets more and more right on.  I liked being 
let in on what motivates people to throw parties...it makes you realize 
how different personalities and relationships combine to make it happen.

Some of us from the New Moon brought an altar, in addition to the one 
Clair and Gateway  set up in front of the dj.  On the New Moon 
altar, there was a size eleven, red, high-heeled shoe, rye grains in a 
bowl, candles, satin and silk flowers scented with perfume, among other 
things.  And it was round, in honor of the moon.

The most magical moment of the night for me came at around 2 am, when it 
was clear that we could stay where we were as long as we wanted.  The 
whole thing kind of came together at the last minute, but it worked, 
thanks to the combined efforts of many people.

Sorry this is so long-winded.  It was a big night for me!

And thank you so much for a wonderful time,

Ann

Got a problem with the stinks? Save water, take less showers, stop 
eatin that meat and you will save alot of ravers noses from the 
putrifying stench of stinky ass meat-eaters expelling their toxins at 
lightning speed. Thats right you too can stop trying to mask your smell,  
taking three showers a day and bathing in cologne, by going the healthy & 
cheap way :)

Whats up Rick,  I am at UCSC and would love to help throw a free 
outdoor.  I can supply some DJ's and a whole lotta love.  DJ's would 
include my Brother, Brad of Berkeley's extinct Mother Earth Sound System. 
They threw outdoors, too.  I am from LA so I can get in contact with 
various LA promoters (Jhymn of Clublife, Mikey of Groove Kitchen, Robert 
of Cybertribes, and random others).  Let me know if I can help in any way.
Peace,

I completely agree.  Did you ever go to YOUR SISTERS HOUSE in SF?  That 
was my first rave a few years ago.  My brother, DJ BRAD aka E-MOTION, and 
his crew from Berkeley, Mother Earth Sound System, threw free outdoors.  
They are now on separate paths, yet hold the same vision.  We know what 
that vision looks like.  We see it every time we have an Eargasm or a hug 
or a ravelation.  I would love to get us all together to talk about whats 
going on, and possibly plan a free outdoor party.  

It's all about LOVE, baby!!

hey everyone,

  just wanted to drop a note to say wicked kicked it!
my first wicked party.  andy was amazing with the live PA
and roger s played house LIKE it should be played.  I danced
my booty off to him.  Bravo Roger!

going to wicked, 21+ was defiantely and experience.  especially
feeling young again ;)  the vibe was generally good and it was
fun seeing basically there into the music.  it was a little bit
clubby feeling and the pick-up vibe was in full effect.  but 
that an't always bad, is it? ;)

peace

There is nothing wose than the minor explosion of methane produced 
adjacent to the genitals by one 
who consumes to many beans!  Ever heard of the fruit farts, or the green 
apple quickstep?  Aroma-assualt can come from a certain hidden orafice, 
which is exercised profusely by vegetarians.  :)

You know the ones, where in the morning after everyone else looks...
well like drowned rats, or worse, they always manage to surface into
the morning light with every hair in place and perfect lipstick and
eye shadow.  How do they do it?  I don't know!

Maybe they take ant-Acid :)  heheheehe

For those going to Planet Rock tonight -

 I just took a look at a Bay Area map - Pittsburg is halfway to
Sacramento! Gulp! ( I'll be driving from Sunnyvale , near San
Jose ). On the other hand - it is Darcy and Shoban and Galen...

 If I'm there , I'll be wearing my SFRaves laminate and other
badges , also my red sports goggles that I use for rave dancing.
I may also have bright yellow or orange earplugs ! If you
see me , feel free to introduce/re-introduce yourself to me!

 Maybe I'll get to meet more Sacramento area SFRavers!

That's cause he drove around for hours and couldn't find it. There's something to be said for giving clear directions to your DJ's....

If you remember to skim beans as you soak them you won't have a
problem.  (If you don't know what I mean and you cook beans you definitely
have a problem.)  If you remember to eat a nutritionally complete meal
(ex. beans AND rice), which takes a bit of planning for vegetarians,
then you won't have a problem.  If you don't eat one thing for
two days constantly, you won't have a problem.  If you do all this
but still use Beano, you won't have a problem.

The worst aromas I've ever experienced came from a meat-eater.  It's
a nutrition thing, not a veggie vs. meat thing.  Either can undergo,
shall we say, incomplete combustion.  >%^)

Yea, and with the gravity so strong,  you'll easily be able to dance to
250+ BPM's because the gravity will certainly pull you down between

Works for me. We had plenty of Jungle at the last one =)

Subject: NETIZENS!! SF RALLY AGAINST CENSORSHIP


Spread the word!


                *** NETIZENS!! RALLY AGAINST CENSORSHIP ***


Amendment I: "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble."


     **PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST ** PROTEST **

It's like illiterates telling you what to read. On December 6 members of
the House Conference Committee on Telecommunications Reform approved a
proposal to censor free speech in cyberspace. If the measures are adopted,
the Net and online media will become the most heavily regulated media in
the United States. They *will not* enjoy the First Amendment freedoms now
afforded to print media. Instead, online publishers and users will be held
to a vague and patently un-Constitutional "indecency" standard. "Violators"
will be subject to fines of up to $100,000 and prison terms of up to five
years.

In response, ALL members of the Bay Area media, online, Internet, new
media, and telecommunications communities are invited to participate in a
protest rally to express our outrage that the politicians in Congress
(which is not even connected to the Internet!) are attempting to destroy
our First Amendment rights in cyberspace, and directly attack our
livelihoods.

Help stop the demagogs in Washington! There is nothing "decent" about
denying free speech to us, our children, and our children's children.
Preserve our Constitutional rights! Join us!

WHEN: Monday, December 11, 1995  12:00 - 1:00 PM

WHERE: South Park (between 2nd and 3rd, Bryant and Brannon) San Francisco.

SPEAKERS: To be announced

BRING: Attention-grabbing posters, signs, and banners that demonstrate your
committment to free speech and expression, and your feelings about
Congress.

FOR UPDATED INFORMATION: http://www.hotwired.com/staff/digaman

(Although this event is being organized in the offices of Wired magazine
and HotWired, we are *actively* seeking participation and support from all
members of the local community. Please forward this message to anyone you
think should attend, and to all relevant news groups.)

Just added a Current Events page to the FnF web site. On it are lineups for
MAD Mondays as well as listings for parties/events featuring FnF talent...

It will of course also have info about future Friends & Family parties
which is good thing as they may be going further underground in the
future...

You'll also be able to mail order FnF DJ/Artist mixtapes, CDs, and maybe
even party tickets from the web site very soon now...

I hardly post or respond to anything other then SFRaves related things, but
this censorship is gone alittle to far. Take for instance, by what they want
to censor, "The 7 Dirty Words" Half of which or said on daytime T.V....What
about some of the some of these classic books that have been made available
online (can't remember titles now) but there probally the ones they wanted to
band several years ago. And for those of you who have kids, they need to do a
book report and you don't have a Encyclopedia at home, You decide to jump
online because you know they have an online Encyclopedia. By your surprise
by looking at it online you might be breaking a law. They have nude sculpture
pictures in there, carved by a famous sculptor from 1700 or so. They also
might have nude painting from famous Artist. These are just two examples of
what they would be censoring. If they said those are part of history we can
get rid of those. then, a few thousand people whould say HEY, if those can be
kept there then what's the difference between that and a nude picture of say
Pamela Anderson for instance. The censorship board( or whoever) will say, but
that is ART, US History, the Past, and your picture is pornography. BUT wait,
is it really. a picture of some nude female or male standing just like they
would for a painting or what not would be they same thing, but from the
present time and painted or sculpted by Joe Smoe, who decide to put it on a
Web Page to show that he/she has talent. They would have to take off alot of
thing on the net that have to do with The woulds history. What about online
dictionary even. They have most of those "7 Dirty Words" in them also. Anyone
can walk into any library or bookstore and pick up or look at something that
would be on an Online Censorship Hitlist. Does this mean they would have to
Censor library and bookstores too. 
 
They can not pass this and have it stick. Too many people and too many
different Companys, Schools and whoever need the Online service too much.
 
 
I hope I made some sence, I think faster then I type. But point is, they
would have to censor to much of This world's History because it would fall in
the censorship catagory because of it content, and not the Meaning of what it
really meant in History, CONTENT is the key word why this will not happen.
TOO many people can and will have the right to complain.
 
Tim (knucklehead) Sorry for posting this Here. I'm not in a very happy mood
today, not because of this censorship (I know it won't happen) but it about
alittle of everything.

be warned - this really isn't rave-related at all, except that i think
most of you sfravers are pretty thoughtful and intelligent people with
eclectic interests (smooch!).

EMMANUEL KANT PHILOSOPHY LECTURES - WED/THU 13th/14th - THOMAS NAGEL
====================================================================
sorry if i'm chafing people by posting something so tangential, but i
think a few of you might be interested.  i first got interested in the
rave scene when i saw another visiting speaker last year - fraser (clark i
think?) - so i guess you really never know what you're gonna learn when
you go to a philosophy thang.

ANYWAY - tom nagel is coming to campus (stanford) next wednesday and
thursday.  he hasn't released an abstract yet (i've been bugging the
dept. secretary every morning) but his field is the philosophy of mind and
consciousness.  i've read three of his papers this term, and i'm prepared
to call him brilliant.  some of what he writes about is inspired by
philosophical science fiction concepts, which i think is cool too.

if you're interested, mail me and i'll send you the details.  or if you go
dancing wednesday and thursday instead, try to think a deep thought or two
for me!
matt.

On the same subject, have you heard about AOL's indecency filter?  
Aparently, AOL supports some kind of text filter which does not allow 
certain documents/messages/files to be transmitted if they contain any of 
the 'naughty words' which the AOL bigwigs have deemed inappropriate.
The word 'breast' happens to be on that list.
This resulted in shutting out hundreds of women looking for info or 
discussion groups related to breast cancer issues.

What's going on here?

 Well - after making small noises here on SFRaves about going to
Planet Rock - now that the phone message definitly says it's
at Pittsburg ... I'm going to wimp out and not go! Just a feeling
that I shouldn't go - especially since I wanted to do some 
visiting with friends tomorrow( Saturday ) and do some shopping
and wandering around in SF. 

 Also - no indication on the phone message as to what the 
admission would be for Planet Rock .  

 But! - I've decided to make up for it by going to Chrysalis
Saturday night. The last one was so much fun ( especially since
I didn't get mugged or accosted by weirded-out speed freaks )
that I'd like to repeat the experience. 

 In order to get the dose of jungle that I missed out on by not 
going to Planet Rock , I'm going to try the 'Nuff Respect jungle
music at Your Mama's Cafe at 5239 College Ave / Broadway in Oakland
, and then Cyberzen at the Top at 424 Haight St. in SF. Those 
should be a nice appetizer to Chrysalis!

Have no fear, my shy ones, there is much positivity still out there.  
Unfortunatly I will not be here for the gathering anniversary this year.  
Last years was my first E-xperience and after a year of weekly injestion 
of the majick love potion, I am going sober for awhile.  While I was in 
my home town of LA I went to a Fresh Produce Party, sober and had a 
fuckin blast.  It is so reasurring to be able to still have much love 
without substance.  I waited a long time to do drugs, when the music and 
love was my drug.  We should all keep drugs to a moderate intake, to 
preserve our sanity and keep it real.  However, candyflipping is on my 
X-mas agenda... Anywho, although drugs happen to be alot of the 
motivation for smiles in our scene,  keep in mind that some of those 
smiles are straight from the heart.  I love your all.

Peace,

Well, as much as I try to follow my newest motto, DON'T HESITATE, there 
are still times when I just cannot make the eye contact.  Wouldn't it be 
nice if we could just lose all our inhibitions?   I for one have a  
difficult time distinguishing the vibe I am recieving from certain 
people.  I am very close with my friends, kisses and hugs galore, but if 
a stranger comes up and gets fresh, I simply assume he is interestd in 
more than friends.  I have ended up getting into some pretty lame 
relationships this way, and since then have tried to not think anything 
of these, shall I say hedonists(?).  Anyways,  drugs play a large part in 
how I infer different peoples first impressions.  I am on a sober trip 
right now, and find it easier to deal.  Enough rambling...if anyone has 
had similar experiences hooking up with people at raves I would love to 
hear your story.  Mine are too complicated, but if you share these 
feelings let me know.  

Peace, Jamie

Back east after a party it usually seemed like several friends would meet up
at an IHOP or Denny's for breakfast and to come down from a night of 
dancing and fun.  It doesn't seem that way much out here.

Speaking of "Fresh Start," that was the name of the very first party 
that some of the now promoters of Harmony were involved with. It was a 
little party on the beach. (In fact, it was the only beach party that 
any of us have ever done that did not get busted!!!) (That is why we 
don't do BEACH parties anymore... we ALWAYS get busted!)

I think this idea is great! I would personally love to participate in 
any way!

Peace, love and a fresh start!,

Greg :)

Planet Rock
==========

With all my WEB WEAVING WORK,  I hardly had time to put up a review.
I went to "Planet Rock" this Fri. night,  thanx to the door person who put me
on the guest list.   Their $20 price to get in was a bit steep,  especially
if we
all had to drive way out to Pittsburgh.

Lyon's were doing security,   and their presence was always felt,   but they
were fairly laid back.   The venue was a roller rink,  I remember being in
this venue before a few summers ago.

In the main room,  really good trancey house.    Tony was seen behind the
turntables (All 4 of them).

In the Hard core room (Yes,  amazingly enough,  a hard core room),  was
RAW, spinning some sick jungle.

For the most part,  crowd was young,   vibe was "so so",   nothing
spectacular,
just really good music in a place big enough to hold about 1500 to 2000
people..

Venue:  7  - good on ventilation,   kept things cool
Visuals: 8 - Excellent computer animated graphics, lasers, projections, etc.
Music:  9  - Excellent variety... Jungle, Happy Hard, Rotterdam Hard,  Hard

Trance,  dub and House.

Sound: 7 - Excellent clean thumping sound.   The adjacent Jungle room
system was slightly distorted as they competed for sound space.   Both
systems essentially in the same room,  separated by plastic curtains,  not the
best damper of sound.

Promoters:  I met Mike,  I think I got his name right.   Seemed to be
interested in wanting to know what I thought of his party.    I was a bit put
off by not knowing the true cost to get in.   Promoter guested me right on the
spot.   Thanx..

Demigod literally WENT OFF...   He started off at a blazing 160 BPM,  playing
some totally new kind of "Happy Hard core".    Lots of chipmunk type voices,
pounding "Doof Doof".   I went totally insane...  Nate,  the friend who took me
there, was hopping around with a "shit eaten" grin on his face.   I was
literally bouncing off the walls....  He covered just about every type of Hard
Core I've ever been exposed to...  I'm just going to have to go down to LA and
go to nothing but the Hard Core raves.   We just don't get enough of it...  :-)

Later on,  Demigod went into this rather silly song that lost my interest,  as
the beats stopped,  and he transited into more Jungle.   By that time the live
band was playing in the main room.   xPando and ReBirth was rocking the
place down,  playing some insane trancey house.   I was constantly going
back and forth,  sampling the Jungle and the live band as much as I could.

Later on,  DJ Dan started up,  so I decided to go and chill for a while and get
more liquids in my system.   That was the time,  I met the promoter.   He
says that he intended on having a closer venue,  but at the last moment,
pulling out.    So they got the Pittsburgh Roller rink instead.   At first,
they
weren't going to do the 2nd room,   but then decided to do it at the last
moment.    It got off to a late start,   but they were letting people in,
slightly
after midnight.

It continued until about 6:30 or 7:00 am,   then they unplugged the turn
tables and the sound sent screeching to a halt.    I like the way they turned
on the light just before it ended.    Overall,  a little pricy...   try to
have price  on flyer or info line...  We want to know the cost before
traveling so far...

It looks like I'll be playing ambient at Chrysalis tonight, which will be
in SF. Presale tix at the Frequency 8 store on Haight.

I can also verify that Monty won't get lost this time. =)

my review of the "hardcore" room at Planet Rock (where i was camped out for
most of the evening):
-R.A.W.
On first and rocked the place like he usually does...played a set of
"classics"...basically old school breaks and some even housier breaks
thrown in...interesting ...and of course...all his cut up mixes and tricks
made it that much better...i felt pretty lucky to see this as R.A.W. would
never play this kind of set in L.A.. a major departure from his usual
hardstep jungle and one of the best times ive seen him play in about 3
years

-U.F.O.
A shame he only got to spin for about 15 minutes but the out of town dj's
were given precedence due to the late start...played some good hardstep
although the system kept cutting out...nice one

-DemiGod
Not a big fan of gabber but this would have been one of his better
sets..played a lot of the big gabber tunes that keep l.a. hardcore kids
screaming for more including the current favorite that crunchman found
cheesy which would be "wonderful things" by charly lownoise/mental
theo...this was about the only song i could get into...

-Dieselboy
Tearin' set of the new hip-hop influenced jungle and jump up hardstep
sounds...very clean mixing and played all my current favorites....:) check
him out (good tape as well...) it was a shame he had to play after demigod
and while dan was spinning as i think a lot of people missed it...oh well

-Thee-O
Thee-O is well known in L.A. for always having a new tape to pass out and
for his seamless mixing of trance..well, im not into trance really but if
you were i think this set was typical of his usual seamless style...

that's all i heard...i agree that the price was way too steep and a lot of
the people there seemed like they thought they were the shit...but overall,
worth it to hear dieselboy and r.a.w.....

Dear Doug,

	I'm glad you brought this up... one of my favorite things is to 
meet a bunch of groovy new people at a party, and then go out together 
for breakfast, or better yet back to someone's house for breakfast or 
just to chill out.  
	This is when some of the best conversations and connections 
happen in my experience, because everyone has the beauty and excitement 
of the rave fresh in their memories, but have calmed down enough to 
engage in real deep communication with others, minus all the distractions 
of a party.
	I wouldn't say it doesn't happen here, but I think you have to 
seek it out.  It probably goes back to the shyness thing -- I really 
appreciated Brad's comments on this, BTW.  I would guess that if people 
were not as shy and inhibited on the whole, there would be more 
post-party group activities.  I frequently try to initiate stuff like 
this myself, but not having a vehicle, I'm frequently tied to the 
schedule of whoever is driving.
	For me, the "goal" of the rave scene, beyond the immediate 
purpose of having fun, is to spread the vibe, and by that I mean more 
people, more of the time, behaving like one does on an excellent E trip, 
and not just at raves, but everywhere, all the time, sober or not.
	Two things I see as critical in accomplishing this goal:

	(1) Ending the producer-consumer relationship (thanks to Bryce 
Ryan for this invaluable idea; it's one of the real bits of wisdom I've 
picked up on this list that's stuck in my head).

	(2) Making our scene self-sufficient.  In other words, expanding 
our scope so that it is possible to live, work, and play, all within the 
boundaries of "rave." This is the idea of a commune; people can leave, of 
course, but if you don't want to, you're not forced to, because 
everything you need to live, thrive & survive you can find without going 
away all your I.D., and essentially "go underground" while maintaining a 
viable and mea the expense of other ties, would real change occur.  By 
having breakfast with each other, we can encourage this process...

I think the whole "not being able to make eye contact" thing is what bugs me
the most... I don't want to be extra shy person, but I just can't help it
sometimes. Tho' I did overcome a lot of that, at least partially, at Planet
Rock last night... went in with a really good attitude all smiles and I
think alot of people reacted well to that... but a few hours later I got
tired and stoned and as the night wore on everybody got a lot less social.
Ah well, it was a damn good party tho'.

mikey.

howdy!

did anyone try to make it to the Planet rock afterparty in Berkeley? I
walked over there at about 3pm and it was e-m-p-t-y.

I guess whoever did the answering machine message screwed up pretty bad;
they gave the wrong directions!

It really made me sad in an empathetic sort of way... I hate seeing
potentially good parties ruined by technicalities like that one. Unless the
big crowd showed up after I left... I think they changed the message after I
told them about the *problem.*

Did anyone go? how did it turn out?

P.S. - We could start our own schools, where the emphasis would be on 
teaching participants how to live their lives to the fullest, rather than 
teaching the mastery of a particular career field in order to make more 
money; we could buy our own land and establish communal raver living 
areas where everyone is able to plow the fruits of their labor into 
throwing terrific parties instead of paying it to the government in 
parking tickets and sales taxes, to be spent on Stealth bombers and 
offices full of bureaucrats...
	...(sigh) One can always dream.  Anyway, my point being that what 
happens after the party may be what has the most potential for connecting 
us...

        WEll hmm..i've had experiences in which i've ended up for lack of a
better word "making out" with random people at parties and for the most
part these have been positive experiences. My only word of caution is to
realize that we all have different perceptions about these things and place
different kinds of meaning on what goes on. For me it's the simple fact
that you're with someone right now and are happy to be alive and you
physically share your joy with another person. But not everyone thinks like
this so i try to keep a grip on things :) I think that if one has that four
letter acronym running through their veins one can also make decisions of
this sort...or rather, not make any decisions and just do it (well, not
"it" but just act without thinking, a very zen-like experience in which
thought and action become the same thing). Personally, i have no problem
with a whole room full of people making out just as long as everyone is
happy and it's consensual, but then again that word is rather slippery
anyways. Tough call, but yes, being sober does improve your abilitiy to
focus on future repercussions and the real nature of your feelings for
someone. Personally, if something happens with someone it IS a genuine act
of love and caring: drugs do not bring something completely foreign out of
you, they just bring buried parts of yourself to the surface so for that
time, when you're both looking into each other's eyes, the feelings you
feel are very real. The next day is a different context and therefore a
different story. :)
        play safe remember!

Dear All,
                I am considering writing a column for XLR8R magazine
regarding the Trocadero club at 4th and Bryant. Many people I know have had
problems with the attitude and actions of the staff and management of this
venue. Their attitude is, of course, their prerogative and ravers I know
who don't like it are voting with their feet. What I am concerned about is
the continued use of the Troc' as a venue for dance and underground acts
when it would appear that the club does not want the business of ravers and
clubkids. I want to bring this to the attention of record labels and
management companies who continue to book dance acts like the Dust
Brothers, Banco de Gaia, Prodigy, etc. so that the people who enjoy this
particular music get to see the bands and have an enjoyable, hassle-free
time.

        I have heard several stories, seen several posts on sfraves, and
had experiences myself. I am looking for others who have had bad
experiences (or good experiences if you think that this is not the case) at
the club. Just first hand accounts please, no hearsay!

        This is what seems to have taken place.....

        Water and Air Conditioning, made freely available at the clubs punk
and bondage events, are conspicuously absent at underground events.

        People who are dressed as ravers / clubbers are singled out and
hassled by security, while people in leather gear are welcomed. (I have
witnessed this myself)

        Girls have apparently been harrassed by the female security.

        The venue has been shut down for supposed 'noise complaints' by
police who had been at the venue for over an hour, but who didn't act until
moments after the management had recieved the balance of rent due. This has
happened on more than one occasion.

        And on a personal note...  I was booked by TVT Records to DJ
between the bands at the EBN/ Banco show last week. My name was on the
flyer, and my contact at TVT had spoken directly to George, the manager,
regarding the booking. When I arrived at the club, I was refused entry by
George himself. He said he knew nothing about the booking and was using his
own DJ. I didn't even have 8 dollars to get in and sort out the situation.
Now TVT are saying "no play, no pay".

        When I have all your responses, I will send the information to the
manager of the venue to get his comments and the venues side of the story.

        Take it easy....

        Jon Williams

GAAAAK!

	Did anyone else notice that there was *no* map point info for 
Chrysalis last night?  Or was I just calling the wrong Gateway Systems 
which happened to be throwing another party called Chrysalis 
that was an advance-ticket only ordeal?  
	I sat at my friend's apt. for 
four hours calling the Gateway number, and by 4am there was no map point 
info.  And I REALLY wanted to go to this party.  Feh.
	Anyone else have a crappy weekend and wanna commiserate with me?
	I also spent an entire afternoon walking around Berkeley looking 
for the new Autechre and NO ONE had it.  Feh.
	Plus, now I have finals to worry about.  
	Bleh.

	What's going on here?

	feh.

	Sorry for all the whining.

	Have a good week, everyone.

		luv,

			BK-jon

to set the record straight, united systems was my idea in the fact that 
when we set out to do the oct.15t party on the beach it was just 
arron,jen of spaz and stef,rebeka, jereamy and myself of pirate audio 
assault unit. we thought that since the two crews were doing a party 
together we should call it united systems , after the u.k. crew. we 
talked with the united crew overseas and they fully supported our idea. 
at first arron and jen dug they idea and the flyers were printed up. we 
all thought this was a good way to not blow up any egoes. the party went 
off great with a good d.j. lineup and solid music, and kicking atmosphere.
the problems arose when we tried to do another party with the spaz crew. 
at a sound system meeting a bunch of spaz people showed up who were not 
involved with the parties and flipped out on the name united systems. 
excuses were plentiful but the main one was how could we be united 
systems if there was only one sound system..implying pirate audio was not 
a true system because we owned no p.a. whats interesting though is that 
spiral tribe sound system didnt own a system in the beginng either, they 
borrowed bedlam's sound system. another odd thing is that at the oct.15 
th party there only 4 d.j.s and only one was a spaz d.j. but in the end i 
decided that i really enjoyed my friendship and love for arron and jen 
more than mydesire to throw partys so i saw it best to split from working 
with them. i dig them massively but i dont care much for many of the 
other spaz people, not all of them but a few really ticked me off. so 
there is your dirt on the spaz / united soundsystem b.s. it really isnt 
much. we split off so we could salvage our friendships...much more 
important than partys. ...oh and by the way s.f....jack acid is here and 
is about to drop the massive hardcore vibe on this town, watch for gabba 
dave and jack...you've been warned.

I'd say do it, Jon.  You might remember a recent article in the Bay
Guardian that highlighted the new manager of the Troc and the revitalizing
of the local punk scene that is his mission.  I mean, sounded pretty good
and all that, but I've observed the same problems you have, as have
many others.

The Troc has a long and very interesting history.  Back in the 1970s and
early 1980s it was the center of the gay disco scene in SF.  There's a
book called "Tribal Vibes" (if I remember the name right, my copy is
floating around somewhere at Ameba) which goes into that in great detail
and has some good photos from that period.  

Since the mid-1980s it's been more of a mixture, with the longstanding
Bondage a Go Go, punk shows, bands and a fair number of rave-type events.
I remember one specifically I went to a couple of years back called
Turtle Wax.  For a while it was a pretty good venue for that, and the
sound system around the beginning of 1993 was the most awesome I've
ever heard, no exceptions.  One day most of it walked out the back
door.  That is just one of many stories in the sketchy history of
the Troc.  

The antipathy of the staff toward "ravers" is well know.  The last time
I was there was during the Billboard convention last January, when
Deconstruction were holding their showcase night.  I arrived at around
2 am and shortly thereafter the police shut it down, hours early, right
during the middle of Justin Robertson's set, as a result of an obviously
bogus "sound complaint."  I had barely heard the sound when I was outside,
as they were using the then-new Wicked system in the main room and it
wasn't cranked all the way.

So your story about shutdowns right after the final money changes hands
makes me wonder yet again about what happened that night, and maybe
you should get in touch with Deconstruction US and see what they know, Jon.

I think it's about time someone really dug into this story.  I know there
is no shortage of horror tales about attending and putting on events
at the Troc.

 The Chrysalis folks updated the phone message by 10:10PM ( that's when
I heard it ). The "map point" WAS the Frequency 8 store! The message may
still be on their machine - if you call it and listen to the wording,
it just says to buy the tickets at Frequency 8. No mention of a seperate
map point - they just didn't explicitly state that Frequency 8 was the
map point.

 There were tons of folks at Chrysalis , so it must have been figured
out by a lot of people. It may that it the new message's statement about
Frequency 8 was confused with the previous message's statement about
advanced ticket sales at Frequncy 8 ( I am refering to phone messages,
not any postings to sfraves ).

This has to rate as one of the most intense and beautiful (and frustrating,
but I'll get to that in a bit) weekends in my raving life (there have been a
lot of them in the past year!). I lost my mind, found it again, lost it
again, and hopefully won't find it again for a good two or three weeks
(hopefully until well after the Gathering, which I'm looking forward to with
all of my heart). I danced until I was reduced to sitting on the floor and
nodding rhythmically, I made a happy ass out of myself on several locations,
and I generally could just not contain myself.

All I can really say about Planet Rock:

Donald & DJ Dan KICKED ASS.

Anybody who saw me after about 15 minutes into their set can attest to the
fact that I was well gone early on (I was the tall guy with the pony tail,
double nose rings, beat-up sandals, jeans, and the Deadfall Snowboards
shirt, grinning like a maniac and making lots of noise). They fucking
_rocked_ me: for two (or more) hours it was non-stop funked-up tough electro
beats, funky house, techno, and mad scratching. Did I say "mad scratching"?
That doesn't even come close to the sick shit that Donald and Dan were
pulling out of their turntables! They were evil on the transformers, rocked
the faders, and had their loops down cold. Serious technique, outta-hand
music, and tons of vibe to share with the (admittedly somewhat lame)
crowd. Superlatives fail me. It was transcendental; it was fabulous; it was
tons of fun.

The venue (as others have said) was a roller rink that the promoters had
subdivided with polypropylene into various areas: The main room, a chill
room, and the hardcore room. The visuals were pretty cool (nothing on the
F'n'F crews, though) and the laser was one of the cooler ones I've
seen. Sound was good in the main room (although they could have killed the
highs a little more), but what they did to the hardcore room was near
criminal. Half the sound system turned up twice as loud does not equal a
whole sound system, and it's time that promoters and sound people figure
that out. It's a shame, because most of the stuff I heard in there (even
with the lamentable fact that I missed Dieselboy's set) was pretty cool. The
jungle crew in SF can only go up, and I have a feeling they're going to go
very high indeed; they have too much talent not to. I didn't hear anybody
play "Six Million Ways to Die," though. ;)

I do have to bitch about the crowd. While there was a small crowd (~50) of
hardcore groovers up near the speakers going crazy, most of the people in
main room were either sitting in little clumps or wandering around
aimlessly. I don't understand how they could sit through a set like Donald &
Dan's, but they did. I kept trying to get people more interested, but I
think my antics annoyed more than they entertained. It was quite
frustrating.

Something else really frustrated me. I've watched the whole thread on
shyness with some interest because of my own problems in dealing with
strangers. Anybody who has known me for anything longer than 15 minutes will
tell you that I am incredibly obnoxious, if not annoying, and that I would
seem like the furthest thing from shy. However, I am an extremely reserved
person when I'm around people I don't know. It sucks, but that's the way I
am. I saw Wayne wandering around and I wanted to say hi (hi Wayne!), but I
could never think of anything non-lame to say. Also, there was an
excrutiatingly attractive young woman who was giving me the eye all night
and I really wanted to talk to her. I ended up _totally_ wimping out. If
anybody knows who the tall brunette in the red tank top and Adidas sweat
pants and shoes was, please let me know. I'd be forever grateful.

Anyway, when the lights came up at 6:30, it was far too early for the party
to end. DRC had just gotten warmed up and was throwing down some totally
cool hard techno, and then boom! the house lights were on and the music was
gone. Bummer, especially because the nerve I'd been storing up to talk to
the aforementioned young lady evaporated with the darkness.

Although the crowd could have been _much_ more into it, Planet Rock was a
good time. The security didn't particularly bug me and it was sorta cool
going to a party with that big rave feel to it (is that feel generated
mostly by the fact that you have to shell out $20 to get in?).

There could not have been more of a difference between Planet Rock and
Chrysalis. I didn't make it to Chrysalis until about 2:30 (my friend Derek
and I were slow to get moving that night because we were both still somewhat
spun from the night before), but the instant I stepped inside I knew it was
a party. The gallery space where the party was located was full of sweaty,
enthusiastic groovers going off bigtime to John Carel. That place was _hot_
-- I was sweating heavily even when I was just standing still. The sweaty
atmosphere worked _for_ the party for me, because it made it seem even that
much more intimate. Where Planet Rock was all coolness and suburban ravers,
Chrysalis was down-home and much more of the vibe-oriented freak scene that
makes San Francisco special for me. When Monty started bringing in the hard
funky beats, I was forced to dance despite my considerable fatigue.

All in all, it was a pretty ace weekend.

yrz,
ozy

[ to sfraves mailist ]

 I have an e.p. vinyl that I enjoy a lot - it's by "Wallstar" , entitled
"Shadow Overture E.P." . The credits state "All Titles Written & Produced
by Bates/Twichett". The label was Immortal Records , copyright 1994 .
A stupendous mix of techno , tribal and acid tweaky stuff.
 Can anyone tell me if these folks (Bates/Twitchett) have put out anything
else under "Wallstar" or any other name? 

 Thanks!

I FEEL STUPID

MUD ALL OVER MY FACE

What's wrong with me?

It didn't occur to me that anyone would be at F8 after their normal store 
hours.  I wish the message had included the word "map point".
Gawd, I feel dumb.


	Thanks all.

It seems there are a great many shy people in the rave scene, just as
there are outside.  Perhaps everyone exhibits characteristics of
shyness from time to time.  As someone who has had these feelings as
well, and have in many ways overcome them, I may be able to offer some
advice.

It helps to have a strategy.  Many people resolve to meet a number of
new friends at each party.  Determine what tools you have to help you
meet people.  There are certain topics which work successfully to open
a conversation at parties.  Learn about the music, this is the common
denominator that brings everyone together.

  When you don't know the other person, it is difficult to find a
connection.  Bringing an object such as a toy helps provide a focus
for conversation.  It can be something as attention grabbing as my
moon shoes (a cross between platform shoes and a moonbounce) or just a
fuzzy stuffed animal.  Bring things to share, such as small toys or
candy.  At hot, stuffy parties, spraying people with a plant mister
has been a way to make friends fast.  

An SF raves laminate is a very good way to meet people...even non
SFRavers.  People are curious as to what that thing around your neck
is.  Wearing unusual clothing can help produce introductions.  Be
creative.  

If there's a better place to meet people than a rave, I don't know
what it would be.  Peoples defenses are down and are open-minded(at
least at a good party).  I believe  barriers between people are one of
the great problems of civilization. I would like to hear any further
comments.

David

Hot, sweaty bodies entwined in mind expanding excursions...

Hello everyone,

I'd like to take a few moments to share my views of Gateway System's
Chrysalis...

I dropped by @ about 1ish with an olde friend of my 92' raving days... Afta
getting in from the cold outdoors I was comforted by warmth of fellow
ravers....

The music was quite varied... From the tribal thumpings to funky trance tunes
and even a breakbeat (cira 91-3'ish) set here and there...  I think I would
of appreciated the music more if-it-if-it-if-
it-weren't-for-the-for-the-for-the-for-the-
record-record-skipping-skipping-skipping-skipping.....
       But hey, dem wood floors did look worn...
I realy enjoyed seeing all of you netravers (ie. my extened family) in the
crowds and took a few minuets off the dance floor (yikes! rarity..) and
chatted a bit.  I also fancied the notion of another sound system in the
crowd (& you know who you are) trancing out to the Gateeway DJ's sets.  It's
not crews vs. crews, but rather people enjoying people....
I also got a kick outta the funky green laser.

BTW to thoses whom I didn't happen the chance to meet I was the guy in the
green cap, black jeans and grey PUMA shirt... Not your standard raver attire
but I think we covered that in a posting before....

Anyhoot, I had a blast (even though I had to leave comparatively early than
my usual outings) and give a kwel thumbs up to a splendid tyme...

Smile'o'meter

Size:  7.5Smiles (a few people jams here and there but ample wander space)

Dancing media:  9Smiles (ahh, wood.  one of the best meduims for serious
firewalking)

Friendship factor:  9.5Smiles (Almost a mythic 10.  Serious grin sessions
agoing on...)

Vibe:  8Smiles ( Some sets were tight and one or two were a bit loose.  Also,
just when you're grooving..."pop" the record skips)

Overall:   8.5 Smiles  Strong beats, great friends, nice vibe.   Well worth
$10.

In closing....
     Quite recently there have been words said about the scene, SFRavers, and
the general 'tude of the bay area vibe....  Well, @ Chrysalis I saw a lot us
comminicating on a very kind level...  I don't remember seeing anyone really
whining or complaining. But communing and relating & experimenting ("rub that
Vicks where?") in a positive manner.  I reached out to thoses who I though
need solace weither or not they were SFRavers, Cos in the end   we   are
  people...   And to make our scene grow we need each other to understand,
relate, and dance till the wood floorboards catch aflame...

I really look foward to seeing you, my SFR family, at Mission Vortex, or
Interstate 420, or The Gathering or wherever a funky beat is playing... I
might be there.

Hiya everyone!  I just wanted to say hello to those who are part of this
mailing list and ofcourse those who reads all the mails!  Anyhow I just
joined to the mailing list and so far it is really interesting.

I live in San Francisco and attending Academy of Art College majoring in
Computer Art.  Some might have seen me around at parties and also playing
records.  It's not hard to miss me<gg>  I am a really short (I mean short)
Korean guy name Nam  =). 

Although I have been using AOL and Compuserve for 5 months I didn't know
there was such a mailing list.  On Saturday evening, I helped Dj Moonpup log
onto the internet for his first time ever!!  It was sooo interesting.  He was
overwhelmed at everything from the signing on process to logging on, and etc.
 He was soo into it it was great!!  

We hung out and my brother Jin, Moonpup and I went one record each and mixed
while his 2400 baud modem (it belongs in the museum) download AOL ver 2.6 for
the mac.  Do you realize it took us 3 hours and ten minutes to download that?
 Geez!!   Anyhow we had a great time and listened to some great mixes.  I
learned a lot from listening and watching to Moonpup.  It was amazing what he
can do.  Takes a simple track and makes it into this work of art!  

Well, anyhow I'm glad I found you guys.  I am hoping to meet some wonderful
people and learn and share knowledge.  Hope you all have a Merry Christmas
and a Happy "Safe" New Year.!!!     

-dj Nam,  Jst smilin@aol.com

Funny how many shy people are coming out of the woodwork!  And I don't 
think it's just coincidence either.  I can be one of the most painfully 
shy people I've ever met.  Paralyzing shyness and self-consciousness 
hit me pretty hard at Wicked, which pretty much ruined it for me.  I 
would find myself just sitting there wishing I could get up the courage 
and talk to someone or go dance by myself or something, and I couldn't 
do any of it!  Really pissed me off.  So then I was painfully shy AND 
really pissed off!  Great combo-platter to set the mood for party!  
Anyway, my original point was that I didn't think it was just a 
coincidence that there seem to be so many shy people in the scene.  I 
think people like that are drawn to loving community scenes like this 
one.  One of the things that has attracted me to it is the total 
community feel it has (whether people know you or not), which can be 
very healing and inviting to people such as myself.  There's nothing 
that makes me feel more at home than being surrounded by people having 
an immensely good time, sharing their water & candy & stuff with me 
even though they've never seen me before in their lives, freely giving 
hugs, and people who just come up to you and start conversations about 
really cool stuff!  It helps me get over my shyness problem so much 
more easily than going somewhere where everybody looks at the ground 
and murmurs quietly only to people they know and act like they aren't 
willing to give you the time of day (like being on a bart train at 
commute hour!).  Much easier for me to come out of "my shell" with 
people from the first scenario than with people from the second!  So I 
guess we shouldn't be surprised to see so many shy people coming out of 
theirs here on the list!

To all my fellow listies,

It's late.

I'm tired.

My head is full of differential equations.

I've been listening to His Name Is Alive all night, and I think it's
infected my brain.

Und So Weiter.

Just wanted to say good luck to everyone else who's going through finals
hell at the moment, and all you working-types, who I'm sure many of have big
end-of-the-year projects as well.

And a virtual hug to everyone for making the last 8 months much more
bearable at times.

Sure, we've been arguing a bit recently.  

But how many families do you know that don't every once in a while?

Love to all my listie friends/family,

Mr. Jake,
who's tired but content with life.

Dear All;

	I'm very happy, happy, happy to say that my party sump ended 
Wedesday night with the FMR, and went over the top with Chrysalis 
Saturday night. Riding a karmatic tidal wave outta bad(for me) partydom, 
yeah, & fuckin aye!!!!

	FMR's alter was beautiful, party environment by father nature
(sorry but if we can have grandmother cluases in contracts, we can have
father nature), and the circle at the end was really cool to, and not to
mention the music was of course great. 

	Though at Chrysalis, I was having a difficult time with boundry
issues relating to someone I care about, I still had a great time, though
it could have been better, just goes to show you what a little well
thought out communication can do, but i assure you it won't happen again. 
That p-hell isn't worth it for any human being, I've been there, and it 
sucks.

	The setup @ Howard Street was the best it's ever been for and 
party as far as I'm concerned. The music was great, along with the 
people who attended for the most part.

	Long live Claire & Gateway Systems, and may their parties continue to 
rock SF though the year 2000. 

	Claire, though I didn't get a change to tell you, you where 
dressed to kill Saturday night, awesome!!!!!!!

You know it is really sad. I have heard a lot of bad things about the 
Troc also. And I agree, a few years ago it wasn't that bad. I was 
involved in Tilt-a-Whirl for a while, I don't know if anyone 
remembers it or not. I spun a few times and went even more. It was a 
decent space, the sound was cool, and the manager seemed pretty cool 
about the whole thing. The only bad experience I had there was with 
Goa Gil, but that is a whole 'nother story...
I saw Orbital, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Ultramarine there also a few 
years ago, and aside from some moron from MTV being there it was a 
really good show. Of course that is all it was, not really any raver 
vibe there at all, but still a great night of quality music!
Now it seems that all I hear about is problems. Does it extend to the 
Gothic/Industrial events they have there also, or just House? It just 
doesn't make sense to me. In our scene, problems that occur generally 
have not a single thing to do with the people who come. We just want 
to have a good time and enjoy the good feelings and music. I mean we 
aren't troublemakers, we don't go starting fights or rioting or 
trashing venues or anything like that. That is a pretty rare thing in 
the music/concert industry. It really makes me mad! I know Goths and 
Punks who love to go to shows just see how much trouble they can 
start, and to see if they can find a way in for free. They never have 
any money at all. Which is another thing, I'm knocking anyone or 
their scene but for the most part it seems as though IMHO that 
'ravers' in comparision to Punks or Goths, etc. seem to have a much 
higher percentage of paying clientele. So when you think about 
wouldn't it make sense not to harass house events? I don't know, 
maybe I'm getting off track, but I know that there have been several 
events at the Troc. which I would have really enjoyed going to, but 
until I hear that things have changed I will stay away!
Just my 2 cents worth...

Just a reminder to folks interested in attending the FRESH START planning
meeting at my place tonight.

I'm still planning to hold the meeting, even though its raining and there
are a number of people who can't make it. I won't have another free evening
for a while, and I'm sure no matter what night I pick, it won't work for
some.

So...

8pm

I'll be checking email regularly today if anyone needs to contact me.

hope to see you later!  =o)

I had a friend who worked the Troc who verified what I had suspected for =
a long time:=20

At the party "United" the Troc staff and security were tired from a =
party (not rave) the night before, So they called the police on =
themselves. At first my friend did not believe me but he looked into it =
and discovered what you have been describing- total antipathy toward the =
rave. Ravers drink less at the bar is the biggest complaint but I think =
the prejudice goes further. They get a kick out of being mean to ravers.

My friend is in England otherwise I would turn him over to you and I'm =
sure he would name names.... I'm saddened by the Troc which was the =
ultimate disco club... and operated without liquor during its early =
days, has been turned into this Wax Trax unoriginal testosterone =
festival and in my opinion is the very thing which ruined the good name =
of Industrial music.

About the Troc (Trocadero Transfer),

I went to Banco de Ghaia/EBM, and the last time I was there was Meat
Beat Manafesto/Orbital/Ultramarine a long time ago.

While waiting for the show to start, It was obvious that the staff
there is used to dealing with industrial/post-punk types. Their
attitude is totally geared toward drunk, looking for trouble people. I
think they probably get confused when a crowd like the one at BdG/EBM
shows up. The poor empty bottle hunting staff tried to take my beer
bottle five times. I simple wasn't drinking fast enough for them. I'll
bet they don't sell nearly enough alchohol on raver/dance party
shows. That probably pisses them off more than anything. They hate to
see people dancing and enjoying the show, because that means they're
not drinking!

Too bad you didn't get to DJ, Jon. That would have been very nice.

Great Event!!!
Many  thanks to Gateway for an excellent event and to everyone who helped
(especially John, the guy washing out plastic cups for people to drink out
of!  this guy deserves several brownie points!)
I only stayed until the end of John Carel's set but was blown away by the
lineup of Ethan, Minor Minor abd then John.  Amazing sets by all of them
(even thru some technical difficulty!)

Check out the next one if you missed this one, you won't be disappointed!

Nope. Bondage-a-go-go has always been pretty cool(temperature wise), and 
with free water. Security can be a little prickish and attitude laden but not terribly 
so.

Subject: Re: Shyness

Dear All;

        This may sound pretty sexist, but  womyn can generally find a man
that will approach them and starting talking with them. But if your just a
werid little male raver it can be very lonely. This is just MY!!!!
experience, and it wasn't until I started offering my
services/participateing/cleaning up ...etc that people got to know me, now
of course everyone does. It kinda flipped around for me, cause now if I want
to go to a party and be antisocial, I can't.

        Ya know since I starting having a female friend around at parties
alot, I kinda miss going out just MYSELF, and being FREE to do whatever I
want, and not having to worry about the needs, & desires of another human
being. Don't get me wrong, I like my girlfriend, more so that you can image,
for many different reasons. But I came to SF, by myself, explored the scene,
and met people all by myself, and I miss that excitement and sense of
adventure that I use to experience. Going out without a plan & just letting
my night evolve, and end up with whomever like, or necessity dictated.

        So my advice to those who are shy, be careful for what you ask for
you may just get it, with a vengence. People like Gateway, & F&F, are always
looking for people who will help cleanup, give out filers, whatever, all you
have to do is hang around at the end, and help clean up, trust me you will
meet people.

        So you say you just too hopeless huh, for even that. Well, I'll tell
ya a little story about a guy I know. This guy was so hopeless it was sick,
people would say that trying to get to know him was like trying to catch
smoke, ever try,  it's kinda hard.
See,  he thought he had nothing to say, nothing to offer, he thought he was
stupid, and ulgy. That's all he could see when he looked into the mirror, in
fact that's all he knew, was all the bad people had filled him with all his
life. So he went on in life alone & very unhappy, but very slowly he ended
up surrounding himself with kind, beautiful people who had a much greater
vision that he did for himself. Little by little , and with their help, and
a wish and a desire on his part, he was slowly able to see & realize that he
had something to stay, something important, something that people(not all,
just some) were interested it, that he had something to offer, something
wonderful, loving and totally pure & unselfish.

        The more he tried, the more he started to lose the feelings of being
stupid, ugly, and undesireable. Until one day he saw that those feeling, &
thoughts that ruled his life & exsistance, weren't his at all. They belonged
with those bad people, not him. People who felt so bad about themselves,
they needed to put down everything & everyone around them so that they could
hopefully& vainly feel better about themselves.

        The more he saw that light that burned within him, the better he
felt about himself, the more he trusted himself, the more he believed in
himself, and the brighter the light burned. Until one day, and unexpectedly
so, the light burned so bright that when he looked around, he saw it in
everyone else as well, and could no longer hold the bad feelings he had for
the people who oppressed him in his life. He saw just how special, & unique
each & everyone of us is. The more he saw, the more he felt the same way
about himself, the more he felt the same way about the people around him...etc

        This wonderful process of becomeing aware took years, some very
special facillators and both internal & geographical jourenys all  over our
universe, until one day he arrived in a very special place, called
California. Where through is deeds, and his love for himself, & humanity he
became, for the first time in his life, popular.

        A lot of people know who this person is, a lot of people have been
touched by this person, you now know who this person is.

        He continues to live life on it's terms taking the good with the
bad, occasionly approaching divinity, and also sometimes falling into
darkness......this replaces happily ever after, because thats only for
fairly tales.

        Follow that internal voice that you know is your own, leaving all
the others in it's dust. Live in the present, for you have no another time
but it. Follow your dreams, because our window in the material world is
short. Love yourself now, as you would an orginal Picasso, for you are no
different that it, and others will love you. Particpate, & assert yourself
at our parties, small ones I find are better to do this at. Above all be let
positivity rule your life & be kind to yourself when you fail, or faulter,
for to err is human, to beat oneselve up is inhuman. Be willing to let
things happen, & go with the flow.

I've been to a lot of events, mostly live shows, at the Trocadero that have
been great, but they've all been of the punk/metal/industrial variety (e.g.
recently Gwar, Lunachicks).  I've never been to a ravelike event there, but
just from observing the staff I can well imagine that it might be an
uncomfortable fit.  It's probably safe to say that rave culture is wholly
alien to most of them.

On the general subject of clubs being nasty, did anyone else go to Beyond
Race on Saturday?  At the Transmission Theater.  It started out nicely
enough with a couple of hours of spinning, then a short set in an acid
jazz vein by a group I didn't know, then a bit more spinning while BR set
up.  But after they started, they got in maybe half an hour before the
management told them to knock off.  They were just starting to rip it up,
too.  No one was too happy about that, and they managed to keep on a bit
longer, but they got shut off soon.  However, the club said, the party
continues!  Just head on to the back room or next door to the Paradise
Lounge...well, in the back room someone was still spinning, so people
started congregating there, and it looked like it would be fun, but after
fifteen or twenty minutes of that, *he* had to shut down.  Not yet to be
daunted, people broke out their drums and started a jam.  Well, you can
probably guess what happened next.  Yes...everyone got kicked out and
sent next door to the Paradise.  There was still a DJ there, but by that
time, vibe was totally dead.  A real drag, on the whole.  I probably
should have headed off to Chrysalis, but I, too, was a little confused on
the map point issue.  Anyway, the Trocadero has no monopoly on screwing
up great events.

Someone posted something about resistance-d not too long ago and it got 
me thinking.  (and the problem is I knew the answer to this one a while 
back but I just can't remember).  What does F.E.O.S. stand for?  I 
remember seeing another guy (not Pascal) use this on another album as 
well... is it a collective like the KLF or what?  
Just curious...

I've seen a lot of mail recently about pending legislation which will
infringe upon the first amendment rights of internet users.  A very
useful message was sent which included a lot of key phone number of
Senetors who sit on the conference committee for the legislation.

I called all their offices today (as well as my senators and representitive)
and told them that I was opposed to the legislation, and that it was
politically foolish to support the legislation.  I think it is foolish
because of the speed with which internet users can be reached with 
information *even by otherwise politically disenfranchised individuals*.

I received one interesting comment in return from one of the people who
listened to my feedback.  They said that they were getting a lot of calls
today about this issue, but they were all coming from California.

Hmmm...  Sfravers in action?  Or maybe, more political activism in CA?

I dunno.  If you are motivated to oppose the legislation, then I encourage
you to phone your Senators and your representitive.

Peace and love,

Well, it would be nice to vote with our feet re: the Troc, but due to
the joyous cabaret and etc. laws in SF they are one of the few (5?) all-
ages venues that can go all night.  So, maybe some activism is in order
here (did you vote Hallinan, at least?), because the reason we don't have
alternatives isn't because there aren't people willing to put them on
or places to have them, it's the city gov't needing a bogeyman to bust
(easier than taking down real violence) and under-the-table cash to
spend (hard to grease enough palms w/out selling liquor).

Props to all the crews who make it happen despite this shit.  You know
who you are.  Maybe someday we won't have to skulk around the abandoned
decaying fringes of civilization in order to dance...naaah.  American
Konsumer Kulture (tm) is based on suppressing your urges (sex, dance,
free expression) and channeling them into revenue-producing activities
(expensive clothes, fast cars, beer, CDs).  Check out Wilhelm Reich's
_The Mass Psychology of Fascism_ for a great analysis of this, and the
military thing.  He's the only author ever deemed so dangerous that the
US gov't actually burned his books en masse.  Though he got way into 
fringe science which you may or may not believe, TMPOF is one hell of
a book, especially considering the time it was written (a lot closer to
WWII than to now).

Rant off.

Oops, my mistake, the mail sent to sfraves didn't have the phone numbers.
What went to sfraves was titled something like NETIZENS alert... 

I received the message with the phone numbers from another mailing list.  

Below is the message I received...

My appologies for any confusion.

The one thing I've heard consistently about the Troc staff is that they
can't stand ravers because they don't buy drinks very much.

Duh.

If they provided what we want at a reasonable price, there would be
no problem.  But that's what happens when the alcohol mindset is 
completely soaked in.

Planet Rock was thrown last friday night.  I just subscribed to this list so
probably missed all the reviews and/or comments concerning the party.  If
anyone has any copies of posts that mentioned Planet Rock or any comments
about it, i'd really appreciated it if they could send them to me.

Thanks

Get the pink section from the Chronicle. Look under museums. There are 
quite a few good ones in S.F. Do something I don't get the chance to do 
often enough ;)

I've uploaded 25 pictures from Chrysalis this weekend.  So if you missed 
it or had a really good time you can view them at your pleasure =)

They are fairly good quality although some are slightly dark.  They are 
all under 60k as well so they shouldnt take that long to get to.

Via the web you can access them at http://hyperreal.com/raves/gateway/
there is no html set up but you should get a directory listing of all the 
files named chrysalis01 thru chrysalis25.jpg

love drenalin

A good friend of mine will be undergoing surgery today at 12:00 Noon.  They
will be removing the upper lobe of his left lung because it is bleeding and
has not stopped.  In the last 48 hours he has coughed up half the blood in
his body.  His name is Alex, he makes music by way of drumming in a band
called "PAO".  He is a beautiful person and soul.  If you remember, and have
some energy to spare, please send him some in hopes that his operation will
be successful.  Thank you for your time.

INTERNET DAY OF PROTEST:  TUESDAY DECEMBER 12, 1995

Outrageous proposals to censor the Internet demand that the Internet
Community take swift and immediate action. We must stand up and let
Congress know that we will not tolerate their attempts to destroy this
medium! Please join hundreds of thousands of your fellow citizens in a
National Day of Protest on Tuesday December 12, 1995.

As you know, on Wednesday December 6, 1995, the House Conference
Committee on Telecommunications Reform voted to impose far reaching and
unconstitutional "indecency" restrictions on the Internet and other
interactive media, including large commercial online services (such as
America Online, Compuserve, and Prodigy) and smaller Internet Service
Providers such as Panix, the Well, Echo, and Mindvox.

These restrictions threaten the very existence of the Internet and
interactive media as a viable medium for free expression, education,
commerce.  If enacted, the Internet as we know it will never be the
same.

Libraries will not be able to put any books online that might
offend a child somewhere.  No "Catcher in the Rye" or "Ulysses" on the net.
Internet Service Providers could face criminal penalties for allowing
children to subscribe to their Internet Services, forcing many  small
companies to simply refuse to sell their services to anyone under 18. Worst
of all, everything you say and publish on the net will have to be "dumbed
down" to that which is acceptable to a child.

As Internet users, we simply must not allow this assault against the
Internet and our most basic freedoms to go unchallenged.

On Tuesday December 12, the organizations below are urging you to
join us in a NATIONAL DAY OF PROTEST. The goal is to flood key members of
the House and Senate with phone calls, faxes and email with the message
that the Internet community WILL NOT TOLERATE Congressional attempts to
destroy the Internet, limit our freedoms and trample on our rights.

Below are the phone, fax, and email address of several key members of
Congress on this issue and instructions on what you can do to join the
National Day of Protest to save the Net.

______________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU MUST DO ON TUESDAY DECEMBER 12, 1995

1. Throughout the day Tuesday December 12, please contact as many
   members of Congress on the list below as you can. If you are only
   able to make one call, contact House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Finally,
   if the Senator or Representative from your state is on the list
   below, be sure to contact him or her also.

2. Urge each Member of Congress to "stop the madness".  Tell them that
   they are about to pass legislation that will destroy the Internet as
   an educational and commercial medium.  If you are at a loss for
   words, try the following sample communique:

   Sample phone call:

        Both the House and Senate bills designed to protect children
        from objectionable material on the Internet will actually
        destroy the Internet as an medium for education, commerce, and
        political discourse. There are other, less restrictive ways to
        address this issue.

        I urge you to oppose both measures being proposed in the
        conference committee.  This is an important election issue to
        me.

   Sample letter (fax or email):

        The Senate conferees are considering ways to protect children
        from inappropriate material on the Internet.  A vote for either
        the House or Senate proposals will result in the destruction of
        the Internet as a viable medium for free expression, education,
        commerce.  Libraries will not be able to put their entire book
        collections online.  Everyday people like me will risk massive
        fines and prison sentences for public discussions someone s
        somewhere might consider "indecent".

        There are other, less restrictive ways to protect children from
        objectionable material online. This is an important election
        issue to me.

3. If you're in San Francisco, or near enough to get there, go to
   the Rally Against Censorship from Ground Zero of the Digital Revolution:

   WHEN: Monday, December 11, 1995  12:00 - 1:00 PM
   WHERE: South Park (between 2nd and 3rd, Bryant and Brannon) San Francisco.
   SPEAKERS: To be announced
   BRING: Attention-grabbing posters, signs, and banners that demonstrate
        your committment to free speech and expression, and your feelings
        about Congress.

### THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ###

4. Mail a note to protest@vtw.org to let us know you did your part.
   Although you will not receive a reply due to the number of
   anticipated responses, we'll be counting up the number of people that
   participated in the day of protest.

My thoughts and prayers are with your friend Alex.  My name, 'David,' comes
from the ancient Hebrew DVD - dallett vav dallett - and means roughly 'he
who heals with the energy of love.'  I'm doing all I can to live up to that
right now with Alex.  Much love and soul sent across cyberspace and the
astral plane to both you and Alex.  May his surgery be swift and successful
and his recovery quick and complete.  Be strong.

love,
David

First of all I don't understand how you can say that because your crowd brings 
in more money that the owner of this place should treat you differently.  Why 
couldn't he treat you the way he wants?  If you don't like it go somewhere 
else.  I actually never been there, but I don't what all this complaining is 
getting accomplished.  If you don't like it, don't go there.  For example, 
since I don't like the crowd, atmosphere, and prices of the punk shows at 
Berkeley Square, I doubt I'll go back.  Instead of paying $10 to go to B. 
Square I'll just go to 924 Gilman.  Also, I would imagine that the rave scene 
has many more events than the punks in the first place.  Try to throw a punk 
show in most places and they'll think you're nutz.

Anways...  Just because you know a few bad seeds in a punk crowd doesn't mean 
you can generalize about everybody.  I could say that I know a few ravers that 
like to experiment with hard drugs and go to a rave.  Does this mean that all 
ravers are this way?  No?

Well, I awoke (2 hours late) without power and with a little flooding in my
kitchen, and with an army of ants surrcounding my mattress.  But in spite
of those minor disturbances the day is going quite well.  (thanks Czefir!).
It's good to be part of this community, and to see the care that people
here express for each other...knowing that can get me through much harder
times than this!

thanks Waynee & all,
David

No, no! I'm not saying that they are bad seeds, that's just the way 
they are. They are my friends and I'm not putting them down. I'm just 
trying to make a comparision, not a stereotype. Sorry for the 
confusion. I never try to put people down because of what they like 
or do, I just state how things are, with no opinions attatched. I 
know _several_ people who experiment with hard drugs, and not all 
ravers are like that, that was not what I was trying to get across. 
My point was that venue owners and managers shouldn't treat their 
clientele different depending on who they are or how much money they 
make off them. I myself will NOT go back to the Troc until things get 
better. I go out to enjoy myself, not to get harrassed and have 
shitty time because the staff sucks! 
Sorry for the misconceptions my friend!

Rick,

please pass on my most sincere well-wishings for you friend alex.  i hope
things turn out well.  i will be beaming as much energy as i can direct
to him (and some to you too, you sound like you could use some).

i went through some surgery myself a few weeks back.  very minor out-patient
stuff.  still, it was hell.  i can't imagine what it is like for your friend.

once again, my best wishes to alex and yourself.

hugs
mike

ps, i am not sure if you remeber my but we met at elevation a few months ago.

good to hear that you surrived relative unscathed.

as for me, we had some leaks in the house.  nothing a few pots didn't fix
and some water in the basement (but no damage, it is just a garage  :-) )

when i woke up, the power was out.  this actually turned out to be not to
bad.  i showered and got dressed by candlelight.  as it turns out, it was
pretty kewl.  normally, i am totally rushed in the morning trying to get
out of the house.  but getting ready by candlelight, i could hardly see
anything.  it forced me to relax and chill which feels like the right way
to start the morning.  anyway, right after i get dressed, the power comes
on.  just in time to make coffee.  :-)

i hope everyone else is doing ok.

hugs
mike

Here in Sacramento it rained really hard as well.  I got a little water that
ran down the front door and dripped under it on to the tile.  No biggy.  I
walked to work this morning and it was crazy.  Supper high winds and crazy
rain.  I just strapped on my big rain coat, put a plastic bag on my head
(the kind you get in the produce section of the grocery store - It was tight
so I looled like some kinda bank robber) and got thrashed by the Earth
Mother.  It was pretty fun actually til my rain coat soaked through and I
could feel the water soaking through my pants on to my leg.  Took until
lunch for it to dry.  The sun's out now...go figure.

I too am also a very shy person, but when the music is really good and I'm
having a great time I find all my inhibitions go away and I start to actually
look directly at people. Usually I try to avoid eye contact as much as
possible but I find dancing very social and hormonal and just want to be with
other people.  Anyway, just my feelings on the subject.

I had a great time at this party.  The vibe was great and the price was

so many memories of that place,  they're always good.  To those at
Chrysalis and those responsible:  PLEASE DO IT AGIAN SOON.  After going to
Chrysalis I had no fear that our scene is not in jepordy!

Czefir,
I spent alot of time this last year thinking about shyness and
outgoingness.  I think they're related to love and fear, which I think are
two sides of the same coin.  In any new social interaction, there is a
choice between love and fear, love being expressed in the reaching out to
connect and fear (of rejection, of not-belongong) being expressed
withdrawing.  And it often seems the longer the period before reaching out
the more awkward and difficult it becomes.  For me taking that initial leap
of faith is much easier at those times where I feel confident and like I
have something to contribute.  The funny thing is, the more I do this the
happier I get and the more I feel I can contribute so I do it more and so
on and so on and so on.  Pretty cool stuff, the psychology of love and
community!!!

I'm pretty shy also, though I've been gradually getting more outgoing.  And
now, having said that, it's time to walk my talk...I'm curious about your
name...I like the spelling and the way I imagine it's pronounced.  Do you
know what it means?  Where does it come from?  It sounds like the name of
an exotic shiek or a punjabi warrior or something, or the name of a distant
star.  Hmmm...
hugs,
David

Rained pretty hard here too, a lot of places lost electricity and 
phones all day, but no such bad luck here (yet, knock on formica).  A 
tree almost fell on my friend's car, that woulda been lame.  Not much 
else though.  Other people have had a lot worse luck with it than me!

Allright, enough references to THE SMITHS for one day.  But it's TRUE; It 
can STOP you from doing/saying all the things in life that you'd like to...

Chalk me up as yet another shy person with fits of self-consciousness.  
But it is a good idea to keep it under control.  I too, so far, have 
found the scene to be a place where you can be free and people are coming 
together at one place to share experiences.  I AGREE with Shawna here, 
that a FUZZY stuffed animal (i.e., a Koala bear) is a good icebreaker- 
you can even seek those people out and people seem to be apt to open up...

As for CHRYSALIS, it was another success on their part; BOTH chill rooms 
were BIG and PACKED.  However, ONE word comes to mind to describe last 
Saturday:  

	Can you say, "SWEATBOX?"

However, the music once again was incredible!  I also liked how the 
volume wasn't so OVERPOWERING (even through EAR PLUGS).  Now, this time, 
I took a friend to her first rave.  IF she weren't so tired from the 
commute and a Sharks game AND a Christmas party, she probably would have 
let me be there longer!  As for me, I again had a positive experience and 
had run into a few people I actually knew!  

One minor gripe is that she did not really expect to get SOMETHING in 
RETURN from sharing a water bottle...But overall it was well executed.  I 
like how there seemed to be a lot of effort in finding GOOD chill music 
as well.  KEEP the lazers!  Even though this time there was an absence of 
video projections (space constraints), the smaller place actually added 
some charm to it.  This type of situation works for me at small places 
seeing bands I like.  That's WHY I went to RANCID at The Edge, which 
reminded me of when THE OFFSPRING played there... Good job everybody...I 
can't wait for the next one...

that's my .02...

[ to SFRaves ]

 I went to Chrysalis , but I'll let others report on that excellent event!

 I do want to say my 2x$.02 about 'Nuff Respect and the jungle event
Cyberzen at The Top. Both good changes to listen to good jungle , but with
different character:

'Nuff Respect 
  A little pool hall/lounge/healthy snack bar establishment is Your Mama's
Cafe , at the corner of College and Broadway in Oakland. A nice site for
a meal and a chat as some tasty jungle music gets spun by DJ Star*Eyes  
and DJ Thad . I munched on a cashew and veggie and cheese sandwich ( quite
crunchy and good , a nice compliment to the music ).  
 No obvious place to dance , unless the pool tables get moved over. Still,
a nice lounge preliminary to the more kinetic action at The Top.

The Top/Cyberzen
  When I called The Top to ask when Cyberzen usually starts , the guy who
answered didn't know what I was talking about. When I said "the jungle music",
he recognized that - he told me it starts at about 9PM. Actually , the music
doesn't switch over from acid jazz to jungle until about 9:45PM or 10PM.
It takes awhile for a dancing crowd to get on the little dancefloor , but
the dance area gets filled up by midnight. And an enthusiastic crowd it is
too - more dance enthusiasm than vocalisation/yelling . That's probably cause
one has to concentrate to dance to jungle , more than techno ( although that
may be me ). 
  For the fog phobic/philic, there was one floor-sitting fog machine , used
sparingly . Also one strobe light , used almost continually. 
 I had a ticket for Chrysalis , so I left The Top around 12:30AM , but I
will definitely plan a Saturday night for jungle groovin' in the future!

 Does anyone out there in SFRaves know of any upcoming events that will have
jungle music in an outdoor setting? For some reason , every jungle event 
I've been to has been indoors , and most had some serious fog machine and/or
cigarette smoke in the atmosphere.

You are most luckey...   We have NO power up here in Marin...  Latest
rumours from PG&E seems to indicate that we get our power back sometime
LATE NEX WEEK...  Argghhh!!  and I just bought a weeks worth of frozen
food and vegitables.    Right now,  I'm hanging with a friends place
what has power so I can charge up my laptop batteries and get on-line.

All roads up to my place are blocked by fallen trees,  and even the
pathway through the woods is blocked by a huge tree.   Even walking up
to my place from town can be an ordeal of climbing over tons of fallen
branches and trees.    Winds up here were 80 MPH gusts...


The WELL was down all day,  and San Rafael pop is still down....Arggh!!
WELL just went back up...

All I can say is that the Orb's album "U.F.Orb"  is a MUST have.  Excallent
with headphones!  I think most of the CDs come with an extra CD of remixes of
"Blue Room" and "Assassan."  Im pretty sure most of them have 2 CDs inside
even if it does not say so on the cover.  This IMHO is the deal of the
century because the 40 min. mix of the "Blue Room" is great

See ya,
Rob

hmmm... i have been reading some posts on this list about shyness for a
while and here is my .o2...  i am really shy. i think this is a self
esteem/confidence issue with me.  i know parties especially under the
right circumstancEs are great for shyness, but generally i hardly ever
talk to anyone especially strangers.  i guess i figure that if we really
do not have anything mutually important to communicate, then, don't...
this is ok. i really like to dance and bliss out and listen to music and
feel the music and atmosphere instead. sometimes when i am on e i really
come out of my shell and it probably seems that i am a changed person.
something about the drug helps me tap strenghts i really have and to
temporarily put the dysfunctional tape loops on pause for a while. but i
really have the ability to do this without the drug... and this gets me
thinking that perhaps i think i use my shyness as an excuse to not take
chances and do anything which will pull me out of my ordinary way of
interacting with the world. perhaps this occurs with others?  i realize
that by being shy, there is a sort of protection(???) from self discovery
- we learn alot about ourselves from others - and when we are shy, we can
hide from this self discovery and the responsibilities it presents... so
shyness then becomes our defense from parts of ourselves we find it hard
to see or accept. make sense? maybe...

here at u.c. santa cruz we did not have finals today because the power 
was out all over campus and in most of town (except down town)..the power 
went out at about 1am tue morn and then on and off intermitantly until 
about 5am..
at about 5 or 6 in the morning i saw the flash from ....BOOMMMMMMM and 
there it was.... it must have been at least six miles away because the 
sound came about six seconds after the flash (i think that is how you 
measure the distance lightening is away from you?) that was the only 
thunder i heard all night (there might have been more) but it was preety 
spectacular!
power was restored at about 6pm to our delight
we are supposed to have finals tomorrow if we have power...i just started 
raining again (3am) so we will see!

  Yeap- I love to dance and I see this as the main reason why I go to 
parties. But at different times different things have helped get my feet 
out on the dance floor and keep my energy going.

                Kevin- it does make perfect sense;). I tend to see 
shyness as more of a protection from other people that I can sense would 
make me feel uncomfortable if I were to approach them. I also see this 
part of my personality as protection against unwanted experiences.
                As for self-discovery; for me; I hide  from it at 
times because of a fear of change-but hey change IS good;)
                                           Hugs-

Oh Yes!

Willie Brown is our new mayor.
Terrence Hallinan is our new DA.

Does this mean a return to all night parties, easier permits, warehouse 
venues, repeal of stupid cabaret laws (found unconstitional anyway), or 
in short will REAL nightlife return to SF?

I dunno.  Who dares make the first step?

Out,
John

        TOTAL sense. I have realized (or, that is, am still realizing) a
lot of things about self-awareness and perception/perspectives and
self-reflection. One of the difficulties of being really introverted and/or
shy (because sometimes ppl CHOOSE not to talk to other people though
they're not shy) is that you become really entangled in your own thoughts.
THis can be good, you can learn a lot about yourself and about other
people. In fact you can dig so deep subjectively that you end up realizing
a lot of things about all of us which is universally applicable. THe thing
that i've found though, is that recently i've become really introverted and
it's not a good thing. When you get into this whole "thinking about the way
that you're thinking thing" (say that 3 x fast!) you end up kind of phasing
out people around you. You're lost in your own little world and that's not
good.  Because to understand yourself 'objectively' you need more than one
view. Your normal state of consciousness is one view of yourself (if you
choose to look inward, and there are those who don't i think), the view you
have of yourself in altered states are other views (dreams or ...whatever
:)) but also, when you REALLY communicate with someone, when you really
EMPATHIZE you begin to understand who they are and how they see the world,
you can see the world through their eyes to an extent, and when you're in
that situation you can use THAT perspective to look at yourself and all of
your flaws and all of your beauties :) So, by losing yourself in another
person you are sort of able to find yourself...woo woo how zen! :)

Wow! All these shy people! Not just shy..... painfully shy and self-conscious..
Both men and women, all with wonderful, thoughtful insights about their
condition.

I'm not alone. I'm not alone. I'm not alone.

Because other people's shared experiences has brought some comfort to me, I
would like to share my own...

I remember when I was young.... I felt that my parents had little or no
interest in me.... They made me feel like I was... a burden... As a child,
I really didn't feel like I was welcomed into this world. It was from there
that I turned inward to find out who I was.

Not even feeling worthy of the food that I ate or the bed that I slept in,
and fear that my parents would one day turn me away, I became extremely
aware of their every move and every thought. Even more, I became extremely
aware of my own.... every move I made, I had to measure the ramafications
by which my actions would impact my very own existence. If I screwed up, I
would be turned away... and I would die. Feeling like I didn't belong, I
would do anything to belong. Feeling, unloved, I would do anything to be
loved, even if that meant turning away from who I really was and doing what
was necessary for my own survival.

And so, Kevin and David, I think you're both right. I attribute my shyness
to confidence, esteem, and fear. I think it is the constant weighing of the
consequences of one's personal actions. It is behavior (programmed by fear)
for the fulfillment of one's desires - the desire to be loved and accepted.
It is the product of being SELF seeking, and very often a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

Even though many of us are aware of this, why do we continue to hold on to
our defenses? I believe it is because we are comfortable hanging on to
them. And observing many people with the so-called confident behavior can
often leave much to be desired. It is often used, or rather abused, to help
someone fulfill their own narcissistic needs, and often wreaks havoc on the
lives of other people. Many of you are aware that with gained
self-confidence comes responsibility. I would like to say that confidence
is not 'bad', just like anger is not 'bad.' It's what one does with it that
makes it so. I found that in my own self, that as my confidence began to
grow, that it wasn't life that I feared after all.... it was my own self.

With shyness also comes the appearance of being humble, which is an
admirable quality... The desire to learn, and to reach out. When a person
has based his/her life on self-discovery the prospect of losing that drive
can be EXTREMELY scary.

And then why would we want to NOT be shy? Well, because shyness doesn't
feel too good now does it? I think we all have this picture in our heads
about our 'ideal' self, and not being 'comfortable within onself' certainly
does not fit the profile. Quite frankly, I think this reason is
self-seeking and not realistic. In fact, these motives will actually foster
the exact opposite of what this person really wants for himself.

One may argue that what I'm saying is just a matter of semantics. But what
I'm getting at is that a person strives to be his 'True' self. If one seeks
confidence/esteem for the gratification of his ego (ideal), then that's
what he'll get in return. A 'true' self does not worry about ego
projection, nor the consequences of his actions. He trusts in himself.
Values himself. He is spontaneous, joyful, alert and sensitive, and
extremely aware. He lives for the now, in the moment. All the most powerful
and most feared qualities lie under all of the fear-based, ego projecting,
self-seeking programming.....

Take away all of the programming... and what do you find?




Something WONDERFUL.




You.

Well, for all us shy people out there, who don't talk to anybody 
because there doesn't seem to be anything to talk about, now we have a 
subject to discuss:  shyness!  It sure has elicited a lot of discussion 
on the list, good to know I'm not alone; in fact I'd bet there's very 
few people out there who aren't shy to some degree, so I guess we're 
all in the same big boat!  We should call this list SFRAVES/SHYNESS :) 
so many people have both those in common.  And isn't it ironic that, 
while shyness results from fear of communications & situations that can 
cause isolation & aloneness, shyness is actually a bigger cause of 
isolation & aloneness!  Well I certainly don't feel isolated or alone 
(right now anyway), and I am quite grateful for that.


Peace

Shawna

                               PLANTS- MARIJUANA

SYNONYMS:  MARIHUANA; MARIJUANA;  THC

0.0 OVERVIEW (OVER)
 0.1 LIFE SUPPORT (OV-LIFE)
This overview assumes that basic life support measures have been instituted.
 0.2 CLINICAL EFFECTS (OV-CLEF)
  0.2.3 HEENT
    A.   Marijuana  may cause reddening of the conjunctiva.  An increase in
heart rate and cardiac output may follow  marijuana  exposure.  Large doses of
THC have also caused postural hypotension.
    B.  Prolonged administration of high dose THC may result in a decreased
heart rate and signs of congestive heart failure.
  0.2.5 RESPIRATORY
    A.  Large doses of smoked  marijuana  may cause irritation and coughing.
A dose-related bronchodilator effect follows both ingestion and inhalation.
Long term smoking of  marijuana  has been associated with chronic
respiratory syndromes.
  0.2.6 NEUROLOGIC
    A.  A low level intoxication usually presents with drowsiness, euphoria,
heightened sensory awareness, feeling of well being, and alteration of time
perception.
    B.  Moderate intoxication presents with memory impairment,
depersonalization, and mood alterations.
    C.  High levels are associated with decreased motor coordination,
lethargy,
and slurred speech. Apprehensive patients may experience panic reactions.
Seizures may occur in patients with existing seizure disorders.
  0.2.7 GASTROINTESTINAL
    A.  Dry mouth, reduced bowel motility, and increased appetite have been
reported.
  0.2.9 GENITOURINARY
    A.  Urinary retention has occurred following THC use.
 0.3 LABORATORY (OV-LAB)
  A.  THC is difficult to detect in body fluids because of the low levels
found
in the plasma and the numerous metabolites formed.
   1.  An ingestion of 20 mg/THC has produced a peak plasma level of 10
nanograms/mL.
  B.  A semiquantitative EMIT homogenous enzyme immunoassay is
available for measurement of cannabinoids in urine.
  C.  An RIA method is available for high volume work with the same
specificity  as the EMIT.  GC/Mass Spec is the most specific and is used as the
reference method.
 0.4 TREATMENT OVERVIEW (OV-TRMT)
  0.4.2 ORAL/PARENTERAL EXPOSURE
    A.  EMESIS: May be indicated in recent substantial ingestion unless the
patient is or could rapidly become obtunded, comatose or convulsing.  Is most
effective if initiated within 30 minutes.  (Dose of Ipecac Syrup: ADULT: 30
mL;  CHILD 1 to 12 years: 15 mL).
    B.  ACTIVATED CHARCOAL/CATHARTIC: Administer charcoal slurry,
aqueous or mixed with saline cathartic or sorbitol.  The FDA suggests 240 mL
of diluent/30  g of charcoal.  Usual charcoal dose is 30 to 100 grams in adults
and 15 to 30 grams in children (1 to 2 g/kg in infants).
     1.  Administer one dose of a cathartic, mixed with charcoal or given
separately.  See "Treatment: Prevention of Absorption" in the main
document.
    C.  Depressive, hallucinatory or psychotic reactions should be treated by
placing the patient in a quiet area and providing them with reassurance that
no  permanent effects will occur.
     1.  Benzodiazepines are preferred drugs for treatment of extreme
agitation
(5 to 10 mg diazepam PO is usually sufficient).
  D.  HYPOTENSION: Administer IV fluids and place in Trendelenburg
position. If unresponsive to these measures, administer dopamine (2 to 5
mcg/kg/min) (first choice) or norepinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mcg/kg/min) and
titrate as needed to desired response.
 0.5 RANGE OF TOXICITY (OV-TOX)
  A.  The estimated lethal dose of cannabis in humans is 30 mg/kg of absorbed
cannabis.
  B.  15 mg/m(2) orally of THC produced significant CNS symptoms in
patients receiving THC as an antiemetic.  5 mg/m(2) was tolerated by these
patients with  a low degree of CNS effects.
  C.  The acute oral toxicity of cannabis derivatives used as intoxicants
is low.

1.0 SUBSTANCES INCLUDED (SUBS)
 1.1 THERAPEUTIC/TOXIC CLASS (CLASS)
  A.   Marijuana  is the common name of Cannabis sativa.  There are over 200
to  300 million users worldwide.  It is used for its perception altering
characteristics.  Therapeutic uses include treatment of glaucoma and
chemotherapy induced nausea (Johnson, 1990).
  B.  Pure delta 9 THC is available by prescription under the generic name
dronabinol.  A synthetic cannabinoid, nabilone, is also available.
 1.2 SPECIFIC SUBSTANCES (SPEC)
  A.  SYNONYMS: There are hundreds of  marijuana  synonyms.  A few of
these include:
          Bhang
          Charas
          Dagga
          Ganja
          Grass
          Hashish
          Kif
          Majun
          Mary Jane
          Pot
          Weed

2.0 CLINICAL EFFECTS (CLEF)
 2.1 SUMMARY (CLEF-SUM)
  A.  A LOW LEVEL of intoxication usually presents with somnolence, mild
euphoria, heightened sensory awareness, a generally relaxed feeling of well-
being, and some alteration of time perception.
  B.  MODERATE INTOXICATION may present with short term memory
impairment, inability to accomplish tasks requiring multiple mental steps,
depersonalization, lapses of attention, and decreased social inhibition.
    1.  Mood alterations, including giddiness manifested by laughing episodes,
depression, and withdrawn behavior may also occur.
  C.  HIGH LEVELS OF INTOXICATION are associated with decreased motor
coordination, muscle strength and hand steadiness. Lethargy, sedation, poor
concentration ability, slurred speech, ataxia and an increase in reaction time
may also occur.
   1.  Apprehensive patients may experience panic reactions. Large doses may
produce skeletal muscle jerking (Nahas, 1971; Weil, 1970).
  D.  ABRUPT DISCONTINUATION of chronic  marijuana/ THC use has
resulted in a mild abstinence syndrome, consisting of agitation, apprehension
and aggressiveness, as well as tremulousness, insomnia and diaphoresis
(Mendelson et al, 1984; Nahas, 1984), and the development of common
migraine headaches
(El-Mallakh, 1987).
  E.  INGESTION: Typical manifestations following accidental ingestion of
marijuana  or hashish in children include rapid onset of drowsiness,
mydriasis, marked hypotonia, significant eyelid lag, and the finding of
granules, leaves, or resin in the mouth.
   1.  Rarely, more serious problems, such as coma and/or respiratory
obstruction may occur (Macnab et al, 1989). Stupor and respiratory depression
have been reported after ingestion of 1 to 1.5 grams of hashish or several
marijuana  butts (Bro et al, 1975; Macnab et al, 1989).
 2.3 HEENT (HENT)
   2.3.2 EYES
    A.  CONJUNTIVITIS:  Marijuana  use characteristically causes reddening of
the conjunctiva and reduces intraocular pressure (Green & McDonald, 1987).
It is noted at levels greater than 5 ng/mL (Digregorio & Sterling, 1987).
    B.  CHEMOSIS: Topical application of THC over 9 days to cats produced
chemosis and corneal opacification (Colasanti et al, 1984).
    C.  MYDRIASIS: Has been reported in children after accidental ingestion of
marijuana  or hashish (Macnab et al, 1989).
    D.  NYSTAGMUS: And photophobia have rarely been reported (Gilman et
al, 1985; Ashton, 1987).  Both vertical and horizontal nystagmus have been
reported  in pediatric poisoning (Weinberg et al, 1983).
  2.3.5 THROAT
    A.  UVULA: An edematous, often elongated uvula has been associated
with marijuana  use (Haddad, 1990).
 2.4 CARDIOVASCULAR (CARD)
  A.  HEART RATE CHANGES
   1.  TACHYCARDIA: An increase in heart rate and cardiac output may
follow marijuana  exposure--the response is dose-related (Digregorio &
Sterling, 1987).  The heart rate may increase as much as 20 to 50 beats per
minute.
   2.  BRADYCARDIA: Non-specific ST wave changes have been reported.
Prolonged  administration of high doses of THC may result in a decrease of
heart rate and signs of congestive heart failure.
   B.  BLOOD PRESSURE
   1.  HYPERTENSION: A slight elevation in blood pressure occurs commonly
and significant hypertension has been reported (Beaconsfield et al, 1972).
   2.  HYPOTENSION: Large doses of THC have also caused postural
hypotension (Ishbell et al, 1967; Thacore & Shukla, 1976; Ashton, 1987), and
severe dizziness (Mathew et al, 1992).
  C.  ANGINA: May be precipitated.  A case report suggests an association
between cannabis smoking and a fatal coronary artery thrombosis in a 32-year
old, but other drugs were not ruled out (Macinnes & Miller, 1984).
  D.  STROKE: Cerebral infarction due to heavy  marijuana  use was proposed
in two cases seen by Zachariah (1991) and one by Barnes et al (1992).  This is
not  a commonly reported effect.
  E.  CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW
   1.  Mathew et al (1992) found that smoking high (THC 3.55%) and low (THC
1.75%) dose  marijuana  causes a significant increase in cerebral blood
flow to
both hemispheres, which peaked in 30 minutes and lasted 60 minutes.
Greater increases were noted in the frontal region and the right hemisphere.
The increase in cerebral blood flow correlated with the degree of intoxication,
THC  plasma levels, pulse rate, and blood pressure.
 2.5 RESPIRATORY (RESP)
  A.  BRONCHITIS
   1.  Large doses of smoked  marijuana  may cause irritation and coughing.
     a.  Long-term smoking of  marijuana  has been associated with chronic
respiratory symptoms such as sore throat, rhinitis, bronchitis, and
deterioration of pulmonary function suggesting airway narrowing (Tashkin
et al,  1980; Tilles et al, 1986; Wu et al, 1988; Bloom et al, 1987).
   2.  A dose-related short term bronchodilator effect follows both ingestion
and inhalation (Tashkin et al, 1976; Murray, 1985).  This effect is seen in
both
normal individuals and asthmatics (Gong et al, 1984).
   3.  TAR
    a.   Marijuana  smoke also has a high tar content and it has been
estimated
that 2 to 3  marijuana  cigarettes may carry the same risk of lung damage as a
pack of tobacco cigarettes.
    b.  In prospective studies of chronic  marijuana  smokers compared to
tobacco smokers, inhalation of  marijuana  was associated with a 4 to 5-fold
increase in blood carboxyhemoglobin level, a 3-fold increase in amount of tar
inhaled, and increased respiratory tract retention of tar (Wu et al, 1988;
Tashkin et al, 1988).
  B.  BRADYPNEA: Has been noted in children following ingestion of
cannabis resin (Pettinger et al, 1988; Bro et al, 1975).
  C.  RESPIRATORY OBSTRUCTION: Was reported in a 3-year-old boy after
ingestion  of tea made from  marijuana  (Macnab et al, 1989).
 2.6 NEUROLOGIC (NEUR)
  A.  SEIZURES:  Marijuana  use may potentiate seizures in patients with
existing seizure disorders.
  B.  SLEEP CHANGES:  Marijuana  usually facilitates sleep induction and
may slightly prolong the duration of sleep. Large doses of THC reportedly
decrease the activity and duration of rapid eye movement (REM) during
sleep.
   1.  REM rebound has occurred following withdrawal of large, but not small,
doses.
  C.  COMA: Drowsiness and stupor occurs rapidly after accidental ingestion of
marijuana  by children.
   1.  It has also been seen after deliberate intoxication of 5-month to
10-year
olds who were under the care of a babysitter.  (Schwartz et al, 1986).
   2.  Coma has been reported in children after ingestion of hashish or
marijuana  (Macnab et al, 1989; Lacroix et al, 1989).  Recovery generally
occurs
within 6 to 12 hours (Macnab et al, 1989; Pettinger et al, 1988).
  D.  EUPHORIA: A dreamy fantasy, depersonalization, increasing audio and
visual perception, and time-space distortion may be noted (Digregorio &
Sterling, 1987).
  E.  LAUGHTER: Spontaneous and inappropriate laughter often is seen
(Digregorio & Sterling, 1987).
  F.  INCOORDINATION: Muscle incoordination may be noted (Schwartz,
1985).
  G.  MEMORY LOSS: Recent (short-term) memory loss has been shown to
occur after THC exposure.  Studies have been split as to whether the
impairment continues after an exposure (Schwartz, 1991; Schwartz et al, 1989).
    1.  These amnesic or "blackout" spells occur most often with chronic
excessive smoking (Chopra & Smith, 1974).
  H.  DIZZINESS: May be seen.  In one study severe dizziness was associated
with hypotension and reduced cerebral blood velocity while moderate
dizziness was seen with reduced blood velocity but not hypotension, and
mild dizziness was not associated with either (Mathew et al, 1992).
  I.  COGNITION
   1.  SUMMARY
    a.  Whether or not  marijuana  use affects human cognition remains
controversial.  Some studies have reported some degree of cognitive
impairment from chronic  marijuana  use (Block & Ghoneim, 1993; Schwartz
et al, 1989; Page  et al, 1988; Soueif, 1976; Soueif, 1975; Entin &
Goldzung, 1973),
while others have found that impairments were absent or negligible (Block &
Ghoneim, 1993; Carlin & Trupin, 1977; Weckowicz & Janssen, 1973; Bowman
& Pihl, 1973).
    b.  Cognitive impairments may depend on the frequency of chronic use
(Block  & Ghoneim, 1993).
 2.7 GASTROINTESTINAL (GAST)
  A.  DRY MOUTH: And throat have been noted (Digregorio & Sterling, 1987).
  B.  APPETITE: Increased appetite, especially for sweets, has been reported
(Abel, 1982).
  C.  CONSTIPATION: Reduced bowel motility has been reported (Ishell et al,
1967).
  2.9 GENITOURINARY (GENT)
  A.  URINARY RETENTION: Has occurred following THC use (Burton,
1979).
  B.  FERTILITY: Chronic use may decrease sperm count and fertility (Margolis
&  Popkin, 1980).
  C.  TESTOSTERONE LEVELS: Decrease with chronic use (Digregorio &
Sterling, 1987).
  D.  MENSTRUATION: Abnormal menstruation and decreased ovulation
may be seen with chronic use (Digregorio & Sterling, 1987).
  E.  GYNECOMASTIA: Has been reported (Johnson, 1990).
 2.13 TEMPERATURE REGULATION (TEMP)
  A.  HYPOTHERMIA: Was noted in children who accidentally ingested
cannabis resin (Pettinger et al, 1988; Bro et al, 1975).
  B.  HYPERTHERMIA: Was seen in a 24-year-old chronic user who smoked
one cigarette and immediately jogged in 84 degrees F weather.  He presented
with an  agitated delirium, rectal temperature of 41.7 degrees C.  Cooling
therapy reduced his rectal temperature to 38.5 degrees C within 80 minutes
(Walter & Benowitz, 1990).
 2.17 ENDOCRINE (ENDO)
  A.  HORMONE CHANGES: The use of  marijuana  cigarettes and oral THC
has reportedly lowered testosterone (Kolodny et al, 1974), luteinizing
hormone, growth hormone and follicle stimulating hormones in humans,
however, these levels remain within the normal range (MayKut, 1985).
   B.  T-CELLS: A reduced T-cell function has been reported (Aaronson &
Dunn, 1974).
 2.18 PSYCHIATRIC (PSYCH)
  A.  SCHIZOPHRENIA
   1.   Marijuana  use has exacerbated existing schizophrenia. It is unknown
whether  marijuana  use can cause mental illness in otherwise normal,
healthy people without predisposition to schizophrenia.  Flashback
phenomena have been reported, but occur rarely (Ghodse, 1986).
   2.  Andreasson et al (1987) reported the relative risk for schizophrenia
among high consumers of cannabis (>50 occasions) was 6 compared to non-
users in  a 15-year follow-up study in a cohort of 45,570.
  B.  AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME: Has been reported, especially in teens.
Behavior  changes include mood changes, abuse behavior, withdrawal from
family and friends, apathy, and underachievement (Schwartz, 1985; Toohey et
al, 1982; Hendin et al, 1981; Creason & Goldman, 1981).
   1.  Subsequent studies using a broader user base as the study group have
not
been able to duplicate the amotivational syndrome (Beaubrun & Knight, 1975;
Murray, 1985; Relman, 1982).
  C.  PSYCHOSIS
   1.  Various types of psychoses have been suggested to result from acute and
chronic  marijuana  use (Solomons et al, 1990; Binitie, 1975; Kunkel,
1985); it
is unclear whether cannabis psychosis actually exists.
    2.  Cannabis may produce acute organic reactions or psychotic reactions in
clear consciousness (Thornicroft, 1990; Rottanburg et al, 1982).
 2.19 PREGNANCY/BREAST MILK (PREG)
  2.19.1 TERATOGENICITY
    A.  SPERMATOGENESIS:  Marijuana  decreases spermatogenesis, sperm
motility,  and increases abnormal forms of sperm (Nahas, 1984).
    B.  CONGENITAL ANOMALIES: There is a potential for cogenital
anomalies in offspring of women who smoke throughout pregnancy (Oazi et
al, 1985; O'Connell & Fried, 1984).
    C.  ANIMAL STUDIES: Suggest that cannabinoids can be embryocidal, affect
gestational length and labor, induce maturational delays, and affect long term
neuroendocrine function and adult sexual behaviors (Dalterio, 1986).
  2.19.2 EFFECTS IN PREGNANCY
    A.  In a prospective study of 3,857 pregnancies in which 4.1% of the
mothers
used  marijuana  occasionally and 5.4% frequently, among white (but not
non-white) mothers, it was found that:
     1.  There was a higher incidence of delivery of low birth weight and
small
for gestational age infants (Pinkert, 1985).
     2.  A high incidence of preterm delivery occurred among mothers with
frequent  marijuana  use (Hatch & Bracken, 1986; Linn et al, 1983).
    B.  In a controlled prospective study of 202 pregnant women with positive
urine assays for  marijuana,  decreased birth weight and length were
observed, compared to non-users.  No associattion with increased congenital
anomaties was  found (Zuckerman et al, 1989).
     1.  Witter & Niebyl (1990) found no association between  marijuana  and
either prematurity or congenital anomalies.
    C.  POSTNATAL NEUROBEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT: 48 months after
prenatal exposure to  marijuana,  children scored lower in verbal skills and
memory (after controlling for confounding variables) (Fried & Watkinson,
1990).
    D.  In a rabbit study,  marijuana  was found to be embryotoxic but not a
teratogen (Rosenkrantz et al, 1986).
 2.20 CARCINOGENICITY (CARC)
  A.  BRONCHOGENIC CARCINOMA: The polyaromatic hydrocarbons may
produce increased risk of lung and bronchial cancer (Anon, 1980; Relman,
1982; Ferguson  et al, 1989).
  B.  MOUTH CANCER:  Marijuana  smoking has been implicated as a
possible cause  of mouth cancer (Caplan, 1991).
 2.21 IMMUNOLOGIC (IMMU)
  A.  LYMPHOCYTES: Abnormal T-lymphocyte function has been associated
with the chronic use of  marijuana  although increased susceptibility to
infection has not been shown.

3.0 LABORATORY (LAB)
 3.1 METHODS (METH)
   A.   DETECTION  DIFFICULTIES: THC is difficult to detect in body fluids
because of the low levels found in plasma and the numerous metabolites
formed.  The small amount excreted in the urine makes it difficult to detect.
  B.   DETECTION  METHODS
   1.  MASS SPECTROMETRY with high-pressure gas or liquid
chromatography may be  available in special laboratories for the  detection
and quanitation of cannabinol.
   2.  An IMMUNOREACTIVE METHOD and homogenous enzyme
immunoassay may also be available but are less specific since they identify
both THC and other cannabinoids simultaneously (Nahas, 1979).
   3.  A SEMIQUANTITATIVE EMIT(R) homogeneous enzyme immunoassay
is available for measurement of cannabinoids in urine.
    a.  The assay detects major urinary metabolites of delta(9)-
tetrahydrocannabinol, with a  detection  limit (sensitivity) of 50 ng/mL for 11-
nor-delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid.
    b.  Also available is a qualitative EMIT urine assay, which has a
detection
limit of 200 ng/mL for 11-nor-delta(9)-carboxylic acid.
    c.  Two systems are available, an EMIT-st (single test) and EMIT (d.a.u)
drugs of abuse in urine.  The first has a sensitivity of 100 nanograms/mL, the
second 20 ng/mL (Digregorio & Sterling, 1987).
  C.  LABORATORY-SYMPTOM CORRELATION: These urine tests do not
correlate with symptoms or degree of exposure.  A positive result indicates
only the likelihood of prior use or the possibility of exposure to sidestream
smoke.
   1.  Following a single cigarette, THC metabolites are detectable for
several
days.  In casual users cannabinoids may be excreted for up to 2 weeks, and
greater than 4 weeks in heavy users (MMWR, 1983).
  D.  ADULTERANT-LABORATORY INTERFERENCE
   1.  Urinary levels fluctuate from day to day.  Adulterants may cause false-
negatives (acidic or alkaline adulteration or extreme dilution of the urine),
therefore urine pH and specific gravity should also be assessed (Schwartz &
Hawks, 1985).
   2.  Ingestion of 3000 mg of ascorbic acid, 1560 mg of golden seal root,
and 750
mL of cranberry juice did not interfere with EMIT testing of urine for
cannabinoids. Levels were reduced but still detectable (Schwartz & Bogema,
1988).
   3.  The addition of Visine (R) eye drops in concentrations of 20 to 100
mL per
liter of urine resulted in false negative urine assays for cannabinoids using
the EMIT and TDx assays.  This effect was more evident when glass specimen
containers were used.
    a.  Studies with various components of Visine (R) showed the
benzalkonium chloride to be primarily responsible, although the borate
buffer had some effect (Pearson et al, 1989).
   4.  False negative results were seen in cannabinoid EMIT assays with the
adulterants sodium hypochlorite, Joy (R) liquid dish detergent, and sodium
chloride.  The amount of sodium chloride needed to produce this effect
(greater  than 50 g/L) would preclude its practical use.
    a.  When the same adulterants were tested with an RIA assay or the Abbott
TDx assay, no false negatives were seen, but false positives occurred with the
Joy (R) detergent (Warner, 1989).
 3.2 MONITORING PARAMETERS/LEVELS (MONIT)
  3.2.1 SERUM/PLASMA/BLOOD
    A.  Five mg of smoked THC has produced a maximum plasma level of 100
nanograms per mL.  Ingestion of 20 mg of THC has produced a peak plasma
level of 10 nanograms per mL (Nahas, 1979).
    B.  It was determined that plasma levels of greater than 10 nanograms per
mL THC were necessary to prevent nausea and vomiting in patients
receiving THC plus chemotherapy agents (Chang et al, 1979).
  3.2.2 URINE
    A.  DURATION OF  DETECTION
     1.  Depending upon the assay, chronic cannabis users who have stopped
using  marijuana  can continue to have positive urine results for:
      a.  An average of 16 days (up to 46 days) before the first negative
and up to
77 days (average 27 days) before it was less than the cut off of 20 ng/mL
for 10
consecutive days (Ellis et al, 1985).
     2.  A study of 13 chronic  marijuana  users demonstrated positive EMIT
urine assays for 3 to 25 days after cessation of smoking.  The excretion
half-life
for the delta-THC-7-oic acid metabolite ranged from 0.8 to 9.8 days (Johansson
& Halldin, 1989).
    B.  LEVELS AFTER PASSIVE INHALATION
     1.  A study by Law et al (1984) demonstrated that passive inhalation of
marijuana  smoke may result in urinary (not blood) levels of THC
metabolites, but should rarely exceed 50 ng/mL.
     2.  Other studies have shown similar results (Cone & Johnson, 1986; Mason
et al, 1983; Perez-Reyes et al, 1983).
     3.  Passive inhalation of smoke may produce detectable levels of the
metabolites in the urine, but generally only under conditions in which the
marijuana  smoke is so concentrated in the atmosphere as to be irritating and
noxious (Cone et al, 1987).
     4.  Sidestream smoke from 4 to 16  marijuana  cigarettes for 1
hour/day for
6 days produced positive urine assays in 5 volunteers (Cone et al, 1986).
  3.2.3 OTHER
    A.  SALIVARY LEVELS
     1.  Positive salivary levels of THC suggest  marijuana  smoking within
a 12
hour period (Verebey et al, 1986).
     2.  One study indicated that salivary THC levels, as determined by
GC-mass
spectrometry, correlated well with a subjective index of intoxication and with
heart rate (Menkes et al, 1991).

 4.0 CASE REPORTS (REPS)
 A.  INGESTION
  1.  Following the ingestion of cookies which were found to contain
marijuana,  three children presented with ataxic gait, generalized pallor,
bilateral conjunctival hyperemia, fine motor tremor, and stupor.
   a.  All three children recovered uneventfully within a six hour period
(Weinberg et al, 1983).
  2.  Inappropriate smiling and crying, tachycardia, and nystagmus has also
been noted in children following the ingestion of  marijuana  (Weinberg et al,
1983).   3.  A 2.5-year-old girl ingested some cannabis resin. Drowsiness
occurred within one hour and she remained stuporous for 12 hours.  The
respiratory rate decreased gradually to 15/minute and hypothermia (34.5
degrees C) was noted.  At 18 hours she was alert and oriented (Pettinger et al,
1988).
  4.  A 4-year-old girl ingested 1.5 grams of cannabis resin. She was found in
stupor, with alternating excitation and laughter.  She was hypothermic (32.4
degrees C), with a respiratory rate of 12/minute.  She recovered during the
following day (Bro et al, 1975).
  5.  A 17-month old child ingested hashish cookies and developed drowsiness
and upset stomach, progressing to coma within 5 hours.  He was hypotonic
and responded only to deep pain, with no focal neurologic signs.
   a.  HEENT findings included conjunctivitis, eyelid lag, and mydriasis.  He
recovered over 8 hours (Macnab et al, 1989).
   6.  A 2.5-year-old child ingested several  marijuana  butts and was found
comatose, hypotonic, and had dilated pupils. He aroused over 7 hours
(Macnab et al, 1989).

5.0 TREATMENT (TRMT)
 5.1 LIFE SUPPORT (LIFE)
Support respiratory and cardiovascular function.
 5.3 ORAL/PARENTERAL EXPOSURE (ORAL-EXP)
  5.3.1 PREVENTION OF ABSORPTION
    A.  EMESIS
     1.  INDICATIONS/CAUTIONS
      a.  Measures to decrease absorption may be useful.  The decision to
induce
or not to induce emesis in ingestion is often controversial, is not automatic,
and must be carefully considered.
      b.  Emesis may be indicated in substantial recent ingestions.
Contraindications to emesis induction include: signs of oral, pharyngeal, or
esophageal irritation; a depressed gag reflex; or central nervous system
excitation or depression.  If these are present or likely, EMESIS SHOULD NOT
BE  INDUCED.
      c.  Emesis is most effective if initiated within 30 minutes of
ingestion.
2.  DOSE OF IPECAC SYRUP
      a.  ADULT OR CHILD OVER 90 TO 100 POUNDS (40 to 45 kilograms): 30
milliliters
      b.  CHILD 1 TO 12 YEARS: 15 milliliters
      c.  CHILD 6 TO 12 MONTHS (consider administration in a health care
facility): 5 to 10 milliliters.
      d.  FLUIDS: After the dose is given, encourage clear fluids, 6 to 8
ounces in
adults and 4 to 6 ounces in a child.
      e.  REPEAT DOSES: The dose may be repeated once if emesis does not
occur within 30 minutes.
     3.  EMESIS FAILURE
      a.  If emesis is unsuccessful following 2 doses of ipecac, the
decision to
lavage or otherwise attempt to decontaminate the gut should be made on an
individual basis.  Two doses of ipecac pose little inherent toxicity.
     4.  Refer to the IPECAC/TREATMENT management in POISINDEX or
MEDITEXT portion of TOMES or TOMES PLUS for further information on
administration and adverse reactions.
    B.  ACTIVATED CHARCOAL/CATHARTIC
     1.  CHARCOAL ADMINISTRATION
      a.  Administer charcoal as slurry; charcoal slurry may be aqueous, or
mixture of charcoal with saline cathartic or sorbitol.
     2.  CHARCOAL DOSE
      a.  The FDA suggests a minimum of 240 milliliters of diluent per 30
grams
charcoal.  Optimum dose of charcoal is not established; usual dose is 30 to 100
grams in adults and 15 to 30 grams in children; some suggest using 1 to 2
grams per kilogram as a rough guideline, particularly in infants (FDA, 1985).
     3.  CHARCOAL ADMINISTRATION/ADVERSE EFFECTS
      a.  Refer to the ACTIVATED CHARCOAL/TREATMENT management for
further information on administration and adverse reactions.
     4.  CATHARTIC CONTRAINDICATIONS
      a.  Cathartics should not be used in patients who have an ileus.  Saline
cathartics should not be used in patients with impaired renal function
(Gilman et al, 1990).
     5.  CATHARTIC ADMINISTRATION/CAUTIONS
      a.  Administer in a health care facility, especially in children.
      b.  Monitoring of fluids and electrolytes may be necessary in children.
      c.  The safety of more than one dose of a cathartic has not been
established.
Hypermagnesemia has been reported after repeated administration of
magnesium containing cathartics in overdose patients with normal renal
function  (Smilkstein et al, 1988).
      d.  Repeated cathartic dosing should be done with extreme caution, if
at all.
      e.  Administration of cathartics should be stopped when a charcoal stool
appears.
     6.  CATHARTIC ADMINISTRATION
      a.  Administer ONE DOSE of a saline cathartic or sorbitol, mixed with
charcoal or administered separately.
      b.  SALINE CATHARTIC/ADULT DOSE: 20 to 30 grams per dose of
magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate, OR magnesium citrate 4 milliliters per
kilogram per dose up to 300 milliliters per dose, administered orally
(Minocha et al, 1985).
      c.  SALINE CATHARTIC/PEDIATRIC DOSE: 250 milligrams per kilogram
per dose  of magnesium or sodium sulfate OR magnesium citrate 4 milliliters
per kilogram per dose up to 300 milliliters per dose, administered orally
(Minocha et al, 1985).
      d.  SALINE CATHARTIC ADMINISTRATION/ADVERSE EFFECTS: Refer
to the LAXATIVE-SALINE or MAGNESIUM management for further
information on administration and adverse effects.
      e.  SORBITOL/ADULT DOSE: 1 to 2 grams per kilogram per dose to a
maximum of 150 grams per dose, administered orally (Minocha et al, 1985).
      f.  SORBITOL/PEDIATRIC DOSE: 1 to 1.5 grams per kilogram per dose as a
35  percent solution to a maximum of 50 grams per dose, administered orally
to children over 1 year of age (Minocha et al, 1985).
      g.  SORBITOL ADMINISTRATION/ADVERSE EFFECTS: Refer to the
SORBITOL management for further information on administration and
adverse effects.
  5.3.2 TREATMENT
    A.  SUPPORTIVE CARE
     1.  Treatment of the rare acute overdose should be supportive as in a
sedative-hypnotic type overdose with support of respiration, blood pressure
and other functions as necessary.
    B.  PSYCHIATRIC CARE
     1.  Treatment of the depressive, hallucinatory or psychotic reactions
is as
listed below.
     2.  The patient should be taken to a quiet area and reassured in a
quiet but
positive way that the drug will have no permanent effects and will wear off
after several hours.
     3.  Benzodiazepines are the preferred drugs for treatment of extreme
agitation, panic or disorientation.  5 to 10 milligrams diazepam orally is
usually sufficient.
     4.  The patient should always be handled in a non-threatening manner.
Hospitalization or psychiatric referral are seldom necessary.
    C.  HYPOTENSION
     1.  Patients suffering from postural hypotension should be placed in the
Trendelenberg position until the blood pressure stabilizes.  Administration of
intravenous fluids is rarely necessary in this situation.

6.0 RANGE OF TOXICITY (TOX)
 6.1 THERAPEUTIC DOSE (THER)
  6.1.1 ADULT
    A.  ANTIEMETIC IN CHEMOTHERAPY
     1.  Dronabinol: 5 milligrams/square meter 1 to 3 hours prior to
chemotherapy, to a maximum of 4 to 6 doses/day.  The dose may be increased
by 2.5 milligrams/square meter/dose to a maximum of 15 milligrams/square
meter/dose (Prod Info, 1989).
     2.  Nabilone: 1 to 2 milligrams 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy, to a
maximum of 6 milligrams/day (Prod Info, 1989a).
 6.2 MINIMUM LETHAL EXPOSURE (MIN)
  A.  The lethal dose of cannabis in humans is uncertain.  One ESTIMATE by
Nahas (1971) is 30 milligrams/kilogram of absorbed cannabis, but the lethal
dose in humans is really unknown (Hollister, 1988).
  B.  The acute lethal intravenous dose of THC is estimated to be 1000 to 2000
milligrams (Prod Info, 1985).
 6.3 MAXIMUM TOLERATED EXPOSURE (MAX)
  A.  Fifteen milligrams/square meter orally of THC produced significant CNS
symptoms in patients receiving THC as an antiemetic.
  B.  5 milligrams/square meter was tolerated by these patients with a low
degree of CNS effects (Lucas & Laszlo, 1980).
  C.  Doses of over 1 gram/kilogram orally have been survived by monkeys.
6.4 TOXIC SERUM/PLASMA/BLOOD CONCENTRATIONS (CONC)
  A.  PASSIVE INHALATION
   1.  Some have argued that significant levels of THC could be passively
inhaled.  A recent controlled exposure study using the EMIT analysis method
failed to demonstrate any urine levels above 50 nanograms/milliliter and
only 2 of 80 had levels above 20 nanograms/milliliter (Perez-Reyes et al,
1983).
    a.  The onset of effects occurs within 6 to 12 minutes and continues
for 172
to 240 minutes (Nahas 1979, Ohlsson et al, 1980, Lemberger et al, 1972).
  B.  There is a non-linear relationship between plasma THC levels and degree
of intoxication (Agurell et al, 1986).
  C.  Roughly, absorption of less than 50 micrograms/kilogram of THC by
smoking  will result in a "low dose" effect, and absorption of greater than 250
micrograms/kilogram will produce "high dose" effects.  Between these values
the  dose-effect is variable (Ishbell et al, 1967).
  D.  Conjunctival reddenning was associated with plasma THC levels greater
than 5 nanograms/milliliter (Hollister et al, 1981).
  E.  Heart rate is maximal at plasma levels of about 45 nanograms/milliliter
(Hollister et al, 1981).

7.0 AVAILABLE FORMS/SOURCES (FORM)
 A.  DEFINITIONS
  1.  The term sinsemilla  marijuana  usually refers to the seedless flowering
tops from the female plant Cannabis sativa (Selden et al, 1990).
  2.  But  marijuana  is also frequently used to refer to other Cannabis
products
such as Hashish, Bhang, and Hashish oil, which are more concentrated forms
of the active alkaloids of this plant.  Hash oil contains 30 to 50% THC (Nahas,
1984).
   3.  Cannabis indica and C.  ruderalis are usually considered synonymous
with C.  sativa.
 B.  CONCENTRATION OF ACTIVE INGREDIENTS
  1.  US Products: The concentration of US-grown  marijuana  is 1 to 8%
(Kunkel, 1985).
  2.  US Sinsemilla (seedless): 5% THC (Kunkel, 1985)
  3.  Colombian  Marijuana:  3.7% THC (Kunkel, 1985)
  4.  Nigerian or Ghanain  Marijuana:  2 to 4% THC (Pitts et al, 1990)
  5.  Thailand: 6.7 to 8% THC (Pitts et al, 1990)
  6.  South Africa: 2.2 to 4.6% THC (Pitts et al, 1990)
 C.  CONSUMPTION FORMS
  1.  The usual form in which this drug is consumed is as cigarettes
referred to
as reefers, joints, or numbers.  Marijuana  contains 1 to 3% THC (Nahas,
1984).     a.  A  marijuana  cigarette contains 2% or 20 milligrams of active
ingredient.  Concentration of THC varies greatly, depending on the plant
material (Digregorio & Sterling, 1987).
  2.  Hashish, which is usually 5 to 10 times more potent than the flowering
tops, is a light brown to dark black resinous material which is usually smoked
in a pipe. Hashish contains 3 to 6% THC (Nahas, 1984).
   a.  It is obtained by reported extraction of  marijuana  with a non-polar
solvent (Selden et al, 1990).
  3.  Although the most common method of abuse is via inhalation, both the
flowering tops and the various forms of Hashish have been included in a
number of oral forms from brownies to candy.
  4.  Although much less common, IV use of the oil has also been noted with
a high associated mortality.
  5.   Marijuana  purported to be "super grass" or products sold as the active
ingredient of  marijuana  THC frequently turn out to contain the drug
phencyclidine, a very potent and dangerous drug.
 D.  SYNTHETICS
  1.  Synthetic delta-9 THC (dronabinol) is available from Roxane under the
trade name Marinol(R) for use as an antiemetic (Anderson & McGuire, 1981;
Poster et al, 1981) during cancer chemotherapy (Lemberger, 1980).
  2.  It comes in round, amber, soft gelatin capsules filled with sesame
oil in
which either 2.5, 5, or 10 mg of THC is dissolved.
  3.  The synthetic cannabinoid, nabilone, is available from Lilly under the
trade name Cesamet(R) in 1 mg capsules (Digregorio & Sterling, 1987).
 E.  BIOSYNTHESIS: There is still work being done on the biosynthesis of the
cannabinoids found in C.  sativa.  The maximum levels of cannabinoid in the
primary leaves of seedings occurred at 120 to 122 hours.
  1.  The primary cannabinoid was cannabichromenes whereas the primary
one in older plants was delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  THC became
dominant in the seedling at 144 to 146 hours (Vogelmann et al, 1988).
 F.  USES
   1.   Marijuana  cigarettes are being supplied by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse.  They are blended to produce a final THC content between 1 and
1.5%  and weigh about 900 mg each.
  2.  One case study has implied that smoking  marijuana  may have a
protective  effect against ulcerative colitis (Baron et al, 1990).
 G.  SOURCES
  1.  The plant may be grown in most tropical and temperate regions of the
world.  It is resistant to fire and chemicals.
  2.  Children may be exposed via milk from dairy animals who heavily feed
on cannabis (Ahmad & Ahmad, 1990).

8.0 KINETICS (KINET)
 8.1 ABSORPTION (ABSR)
  A.  INHALATION/SMOKING
   1.  ABSORPTION: After smoking, 18 to 50% of the available THC is absorbed
(Digregorio & Sterling, 1987).  Heavy or habitual users had a systemic
availability of 23% compared with 10% in light users (Lindgren et al, 1981).
   2.  ONSET/DURATION
    a.  ONSET of effects occurs within 6 to 12 minutes and continues for
172 to
240 minutes (Nahas, 1979; Ohlsson et al, 1980; Lemberger et al, 1972).
    b.  DURATION: 2 to 3 hours (Lemberger et al, 1972)
   3.  PEAK PLASMA LEVELS: 5 to 12 minutes (Digregorio & Sterling, 1987),
but peak clinical effects may be 20 to 30 minutes later, after distribution
into
brain and other tissues (Selden et al, 1990).
   4.  PEAK PLASMA CONCENTRATION: 20 to 50 nanograms per milliliter
(Digregorio  & Sterling, 1987)
  B.  INGESTION
   1.  ABSORPTION: Following ingestion, only 5 to 20% of THC is bioavailable
(Agurell et al, 1986).  Absorption is increased by fatty foods or a lipid
vehicle
(Hollister, 1976).
   2.  ONSET: The onset of effects begins within 30 to 60 minutes and persists
for 4 to 6 hours (Digregorio & Sterling, 1987; Hollister et al, 1984;
Ohlsson et al,
1980; Perez-Reyes et al, 1973).
   3.  PEAK PLASMA LEVELS: 2 to 3 hours after THC (Johnson, 1990)
 8.2 DISTRIBUTION (DIST)
  8.2.1 DISTRIBUTION SITES
    A.  PROTEIN BINDING: THC is 97 to 99% protein bound in man (Hunt and
Jones,  1980).
    B.  THC is lipid soluble and is assumed to partition into the body fat,
heart,
salivary glands, liver, brain, and kidney of humans (King & Forney, 1967).
Lung has the highest concentration while brain has the lowest (Agurell et al,
1970; Klausner & Dingell, 1971).
  8.2.2 DISTRIBUTION KINETICS
    A.  VOLUME OF DISTRIBUTION
      1.  The volume of distribution upon initial exposure to THC is 2.55
liters
per 70 kg but increases substantially with chronic use.
     2.  The steady state volume of distribution of THC is over 100 times
larger
than its initial volume of distribution (Hunt and Jones, 1980).
     3.  The volume of distribution was estimated to be about 10 liters/kg
(Agurell et al, 1986).  Because of the high lipid solubility, delta-9-THC
has an
apparent volume of distribution of 500 liters (Busto et al, 1989).
 8.3 METABOLISM (METAB)
  8.3.1 METABOLISM SITES AND KINETICS
    A.  Following oral administration, THC undergoes substantial first-pass
metabolism, with 10 to 20% absorbed (Digregorio & Sterling, 1987).  Liver
metabolism is by microsomal hydroxylation and non-microsomal oxidation
(Wall & Perez-Reyes, 1981).
  8.3.2 METABOLITES
    A.  THC is metabolized primarily to 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC. This
metabolite  is present in higher concentrations following ingestion.  Chronic
use increases  the ability to form this metabolite.  THC metabolism appears to
be decreased in  patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
    B.  11-hydroxy THC is present in amounts of about 10% that of the parent
drug THC after smoking.  After oral administration this metabolite is present
in equal amounts as THC (Agurell et al, 1986).  This is the most abundant
metabolite.
    C.  11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC is pharmacologically active, but is further
metabolized to 11-nor-delta-9-THC carboxylic acid, which is not active (Jaffe,
1985).
    D.  Other metabolites include (Agurell et al, 1986):
        1.  6B-hydroxy THC
        2.  6 alpha-hydroxy THC
        3.  2"-hydroxy THC
        4.  THC-6-one
        5.  6 a,7-dihydroxy THC
        6.  6 b,7-dihydroxy THC
        7.  2",7-dihydroxy THC
 8.4 EXCRETION (EXCR)
  8.4.1 KIDNEY
    A.  A negligible amount of unchanged THC and 11-hydroxy-THC are
excreted in  the urine.
    B.  Within the first 72 hours following ingestion of THC approximately 10
to 15% of a dose is excreted in the urine as acidic metabolites and conjugates
(Busto et al, 1989).
    C.  Johansson et al (1990) found that 8 to 14% of an oral dose of
radiolabeled
marijuana  was found in the urine of both naive and chronic users. About 5%
of the dose was found in the urine after inhalation by naive users, about 2%
in chronic users.
  8.4.2 FECES
    A.  Within the first 72 hours following ingestion of THC, approximately
35%  of the dose is excreted in the feces as unconjugated metabolite (Agurell
et al,  1986).
  8.4.3 BILE
    A.  Biliary excretion via the feces is a major route of metabolism.
 8.5 ELIMINATION HALF-LIFE (ELIM)
  8.5.1 PARENT COMPOUND
    A.  The high lipid solubility results in an initial short plasma
half-life,  but
this adipose storage produces a biologic half-life of 25 to 30 hours
(Digregorio
& Sterling, 1987).
    B.  CHRONIC USERS: The plasma half-life in chronic users was 4 days in a
volunteer study (Johansson et al, 1988; Johansson et al, 1989).  THC was
detectable in plasma for up to 15 days.
     1.  Previous studies demonstrating shorter half-lives (25 to 36 hours)
measured levels for up to 72 hours and may not have accurately reflected the
terminal elimination phase (Wall et al, 1983).
    C.  ELIMINATION: About 50% of an initial dose is thought to be eliminated
in the first 72 hours (Ahmad & Ahmad, 1990) and 80 to 90 percent in 5 days
(Hawks,  1982; Hunt & Jones, 1980).
     1.  The average urinary excretion half-life in one study using
radiolabeled
marijuana  was 18.2 hours (Johansson et al, 1990).
    D.  Nabilone: 2 hours; 35 hours for total metabolites (Prod Info, 1989a)
  8.5.2 METABOLITE
    A.  A study of 13 chronic  marijuana  users demonstrated positive EMIT
urine assays for 3 to 25 days after cessation of smoking.  The excretion
half-life
for the delta-THC-7-oic acid metabolite ranged from 0.8 to 9.8 days (Johansson
& Halldin, 1989).

9.0 PHARMACOLOGY/TOXICOLOGY (PHAR)
 9.1 PHARMACOLOGIC MECHANISM (PHAR-MECH)
  A.   Marijuana  contains other cannabinoids, such as cannabinol (CBN) and
cannabidiol (CBD).  These compounds do not have psychotommetic effects,
but may  explain some of the therapeutic effects of this plant.  CBD has
anticonvulsant-activity (Agurell et al, 1986; Evans, 1991).
  B.  Cannabis sativa is known to contain the dihydrostilbene canniprene
which is an anti inflammatory with activity as lipoxygenase and
cyclooxygenase inhibitors (El Sohly et al, 1990).
  C.  Smoking  marijuana  (0.9 to 1.5% THC) reduced intraocular pressure after
30 to 40 minutes up to 45% (Hepler & Frank, 1971).
  D.   Marijuana  contains at least 61 cannabinoid compounds (d-9-THC being
the  primary one) and over 300 other substances (Selden et al, 1990).
  E.  d-9-THC is known to act at a number of sites. Dopaminergic, cholinergic,
noradrenergic, serotonergic, and GABA sites are affected, as are a number of
neuropeptides (Domino, 1981; Hollister, 1976; Jones, 1987; Leader et al, 1981;
Nahas, 1986).
 9.2 TOXICOLOGIC MECHANISM (TOX-MECH)
  A.  The resin from the cannabis plant contains a number of
pharmacologically active alkaloids but delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC)
is thought to be the most active isomer.

10.0 ANIMAL POISONING (ANIMAL)
 10.1 CLINICAL EFFECTS (AN-CLEF)
  10.1.2 CAT
    A.  Some animals have been exposed via pet owners who blow smoke into
the dog or cat's nostrils.  The animals are reported to get "glassy eyed,"
ataxic,
or uncoordinated (Swartz, 1985; Swartz, 1989).
  10.1.4 DOG
    A.  Canine Atopy: Evans (1989) reported a case of allergic inhalant
dermatitis in a black labrador retriever to  marijuana.   Symptoms included
pedal and facial pruritus, and bilateral ocular discharge.
    B.  Other effects include tachycardia, hypotension, ataxia, stupor,
behavioral
change, muscle weakness, hypothermia, vomiting, and conjunctival
infection (Dumonceaux & Beasley, 1990).
  10.1.13 OTHER SMALL ANIMALS
    A.  Ferret: Ataxia proceeding to coma was seen after a ferret ingested
marijuana.   The animal was sacrificed before the truth was known (Smith,
1988).
 10.2 TREATMENT (AN-TRMT)
  10.2.3 TREATMENT
    A.  Canine Atopy: Although corticosteroids and antihistamines
(systemically  and topically) were useful in this case, long term relief
was only
obtained by hyposensitization therapy (Evans, 1989).
    B.  For ingestions, emesis (if less than 1 hour), activated charcoal, and
supportive care (Dumonceaux & Beasley, 1990)

I think I have now reached that point in my life...I know pretty much who 
I am and the kind of person I am, and I am still introverted on 
occasion.  However, I still look at my best friend, who has an 
extroverted nature about her, and has newly joined the rave scene.  I 
look at her with good natured envy as her wonderful demeanor draws people 
to her.  I wish I could be that dynamic!  But I think again and realize 
that I wouldn't be Amy if I did, and I still have plenty of friends.  And 
I smile. :)

love,
Amy

Amy, as for your reply, I think you're wonderful.

I'd like to tell you where I am coming from when I speak of 'true' self.
The search for, or rather the attainment of 'true' self is a lifelong
process. Being of Asian descent (Japanese), and having studied and
practiced Eastern philosphy for all of my life, I have come to appreciate
some of the teachings that have been handed down to me.

Of the 7.5 billion people that inhabit the earth, there are supposedly but
6 people who have achieved, and live within the 'enlightenment' of true
self. They live in a state of 'higher' consciousness... pure awareness. In
the teachings of Buddha, all of man's turmoil is a product of his
attachments, whether its his earthy possessions, his image, his spouse, his
children, etc.

'Extraversion' is a characteristic, or personality tendency. I can surely
appreciate that your friend's extraversion draws people to her. We do live
in a society that rewards extraversion. True self, however, does not define
a person by introversion or extraversion. It only lovingly ACCEPTS what IS.
Not by ideals, or even by preferences, but accepts reality. These 6 people
that I speak of live in a realm of unconditional acceptance of REALITY. As
humorous as this may sound.... Popeye the sailor was a great role model of
this unconditional acceptance of himself.... "I am what I am."

With that, I'd like to share a little anectdote that relates to the martial
arts.

When you first start practicing an art, your belt is white. White signifies
innocence. Innocence, just as a newborn. A child... happy, joyful... pure
awareness, no prejedice or preferences... lovingly accepts the world around
it.

And then you strive, work, discipline yourself... success, achievement. The
belt is black... status is attained.... and innocence is lost.

As time passes the blackness begins to fade. The fight continues on... the
rest of your life is a process to make that black belt fade into white....
fighting to regain your innocence.


Brad> excellent insights...!

My roommate told me probably the best story about a storm that I've ever
heard last night.  Apparently, some of her friends in Denmark were caught in
a big storm and their server went down.  Now, it's one thing if the power
went down and they couldn't use it, but I think it's a sign from God when it
got struck by lightning.

TTFN,
Jake

The barometric pressure is wreaking havoc on my ears right now :(

I find shyness very endearing, and while I'd like to be a little more
self-confident and that sort of thing, I think I can do that without losing
my shyness-- because it _is_ part of my personality and if I lost it, I'd
be a very different person and I don't think I'd like that at all.

Don't lose it.

Halloo there all you raverfolk,

	I'm heading back to my hometown, Green Bay, WI tomorrow.  Finals 
are over!  Whoop.  There I shall frolic in 12" of snow, play with my cat 
Harley, and spend time with old friends.
	To those I am leaving behind in SF: Have a wonderful holiday season, be 
safe, eat well, and spread good cheer.  And, of course, keep partying.  I'm 
sad to miss the Gathering on the 16th and a chance to meet many new 
sfravers, but I'm sure the party will go off in a huge way and I hope everyone
has a great time!
	See you next year...
	Until then, happy Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa, etc!  
	God rest ye merry gentlemen. 

	Take care,

		jon The Burger King :]

Yeah, I mentioned something about that last week.  I looked at the 
Gathering web page and there is going to be 2 rooms going on.  Dedication 
- which will be hard house and techno, and Inspiration - house and 
dance (I think that's what it said for Inspiration anyway)...
So, according to my musical preferences, I will most likely be in the 
Dedication room, but I cannot miss Tony's set, either.  Anyways, any 
sfraver who hasn't met me yet, I'll try and be around the right speaker 
in the Dedication room.

I'm 5'6" tall with long brown hair.  I'll be wearing knee high black 
boots and a "cosmic" dress, and I will also be sporting my sfraves & 
nw-raves laminates.  

I will most likely be hanging out with Wayne Correia - you can't miss 
him, he's very tall and has long blonde hair in  a ponytail.  He's the 
guy (or Vince, too) to get your laminte from in you haven't got one yet.  
Be sure to bring a string to put it on so you can wear it.  

Yeah, my best friend and I are heading down to SF tomarrow night, and we 
are staying with Wayne all weekend.  He posted something to the list 
about lotsa people meeting at his place before we go.  I hope to meet 
some new folks! :)  This weekend is going to be ***INSANE***!!!

hugz and snogz,        ps:Thank you everyone for such warm b-day
Amy                            wishes.  It was a gr-8 day! :)

Fie dollah!?!?!  I've been hearing it is going to be like $25.   If you 
(or somebody) can confirm this soon, that would be great. I would much 
rather bring a toy and pay only 5 bucks.  

love,
Amy

Correction: it will be $5 *OFF* the regular price, not $5 total; big difference.

(I am not the promoter BTW =)

	hey mike! we meet again.
	at first, when i came into the scene, i was really shy and didnt 
know what to do with myself, being caushious and all that. then slowly i 
began to realize how open ya can be among all these people who seem to be 
looking for something similar, if not the same, we just all call it 
different names.  more often than not, i get a totally friendly response 
when i go up to meet a total stranger :)
	BTW, is that guy i met at vision, and we had a long talk about 
spirituality, out there on this list. we met via the sfr laminate and fnf 
laminate. (boy, the latter sure does teh trick as well)
	evolve :) tom

toilet. Well dat's SF where House Rules, and I thought House was something
you lived in. Dammmmmmmm

        Well, anyway, I couldn't get into DV8 for Simply Done because they
had shut the door. So I hopped in a cool cab & asked him what was open, he
told me 1015 Folsum was happening, and too my astonishment, I asked him 1015
Folsum, is it the first Wedesday of December, he said no, that there doing a
new thang on Wedesday night now, so there I went. I walked into a very
interesting 1015 Folsum, it seemed like a totally different club, and what's
that their spinning upstairs is that Jungle I hear!!!, Dammmmmmmm, I will
let the clued in continue with the rest of this story.

Thanks Kevin & Amitiy for letting me hang out with ya's, pretty cool, &

If anyone happens to plan a meeting,  I recommend that we meet near the
Berkeley Bart station.   I can recommend  few good restaurants nearby,
I think...

Does anyone know of any good restaurants near the Ashby Bart station?
If so,  lets meet there around 9 pm or so...   What say??

Greetings!

Aplogies in advance for the horribly commercial nature of this post, all I
can say in my defense is: you could have deleted this. =)

In any event, after a long drought brought on by a total lack of money to
put into the project, I now finally have quantities of both my tapes
(Acid Test and Technosis) available. You can mail order them directly from
the FnF web site:

  http://www.bass-station.com/FnF/Tapes.html

Or, if you prefer retail, you can purchase them at Ameba, Housewares, or
Primal as of this coming Saturday at noon.

Thanks for your patience!

take it easy
ethan

David,
First off, I'm really sorry about your ant problem and no lights.  I hope
everything turned out alright.  Although I didn't have a problem with power,
my house was also bombarded with ants, esp. in the trash compactor that
hasn't been emptied in months.  It looked like the ants had made a nest in
there and decided today would be a good day to come out...AAARRRHHH!!! 

Next, I totally agree with your whole thing about shyness and outgoingness
being related to fear and love.  The fear of rejection faces me and I'm sure
a lot of people every day.  As much as I like to be different from everyone
else there is still a little part of me that wants to conform, to fit in.  So
sometimes that fear of not fitting in causes me to seperate myself from all
who might reject me.  

In a message dated 95-12-12 19:45:03 EST, you write:

>I'm curious about your name...I like the spelling and the way I imagine it's
pronounced. > Do youknow what it means?  Where does it come from?  It sounds
like the name of
>an exotic shiek or a punjabi warrior or something, or the name of a distant
>star.  Hmmm...

As for my name, my real name is Megan.  Not quite exotic enough for my
liking, though.  On AOL, in case you don't know, you have to have a screen
name NO ONE else has.  My favorite name for a while has been Zephyr, it means
something about wind...?...so on AOL instead of using boring old MEGAN I
wanted to use the name ZEPHYR but evidently quite a few other people had used
it also, so instead of having Zephyr with some random number in back of it I
decided to try alternate spellings of the same name.  Even that took a while
to find a spelling no one had used.  I finally ended up with CZEFIR which I
have grown to like even more than ZEPHYR.  I consider it to be pronounced
exactly the same as Zephyr :  ze-f-ir,  but if you have some other cool way
of pronouncing it I would like to know.  So that's the scoop on my name.

    Love,
       Czefir aka Megan

There is a single page article on Eat Static in the January 1996 issue
of Keboard magazine. It doesn't say much, it's kind of strange that
it's just one page over a two page picture of them on stage, and it
seems a bit out of character for Keyboard magazine. Since there was
some discussion of them a month or so ago, I thought I'd mention it.

I've seen the FnF laminates... those are basically "tickets" right? Or do
you get them someplace else for other reasons? Also, I got a couple
addresses of the "sfr laminate guys" from the list, but one of the
addresses had some kind of "Host Unknown" mail delivery problem and the
other one just hasn't responded yet... where did you get yours?

Yeah I really like the open atmosphere of this scene... Although I have
noticed a lot of animosity/arrogance toward other scenes: i.e. goths and
punks and that sort of thing. Well, as a former gothboy myself lemme be the
first to say that the vibe among my goth friends and I was just as good as
any rave's. Yes, they (we?) do tend to express themselves in dark and scary
kind of ways, but my friends and I were really into it for fun and got a
lot of really positive things out of it...

I guess the main reason I distanced myself frum that group wasn't because I
dislike them or disapprove of them (Anyone going to Death Guild in the city
this saturday make sure to say hi to me :) but because there really is an
added element of openness at raves that really appeals to me. It's tough
meeting new people when you're a shy death rocker.

Oh yeah, plus I like the music ;)

I'll probably see you at the gathering, Tom.

-mikey.

well, for a while I thought it was polish... the c-z combination is very
common in Polish (but not in any other language, I think). It's pronounced
sort of like an english "ch" but it sounds a bit harder: try saying "ch"
except curl your toungue backwards so it touches the roof of your mouth
right behind your teeth. Also, roll the "r." So, czefir would be pronounced
something like "chefir."

I think 20 bucks with 5 off if you bring a toy. not clear what they mean by
a toy... something prepackaged and donateable, right?

I imagined it being pronounced much like zephyr, but with a 's' sound in
front of the 'z' sound and the accent on the 'ir' - pronounced 'eer.'  So
it would be proncounced 'sz-feer.'  I don't know how to make this actually
phonetic...hopefully it comes across.  If not, then I'll be happy to
pronounce my imagined pronunciation for you at the next F&F or FMR or
whatever party I end up at next (maybe this week-end if I'm real good!!!).


Love,

David

Well, I didn't go out to get flyers again this week (got a few over the
weekend though), but it seems like everyone's planning to go to the
Gathering anyway.  If you want to save $$ for holiday gifts, try out
Club Freaky or the Mission Vortex on Saturday.  On Friday, A Single Red
Light got good reviews last time, and the Top seems to have returned
as a scene spot, for both Friday and Saturday.

Next week the calendar will be out early again, so please send updates
by Tuesday.

Yes,  there is a Brown Victory celebration put on by Sucessionist Party,
and I think that Mars, Jonas,  and a few others from Freq-8 will be spinning
there tonight.   Cost (I think) is $7.    If I find any more info,  I'll post
it.

A person "Magpie" from LA is putting it on.   I was with him last night
and part of today,  running around preparing for it.

So,  if anyone is planning to go out tonight,  check it out...   Good trance
music.

Sure,  do any of you "East Bay" folks know of a good restaurant we can meet
at?   Plus of course,  I might need a ride from the restaurant to the rave.

Well kiddies,

It looks like I might crawl out from under this rock I've been hiding under
this weekend, and come out to the Gathering with all of you !! If there is
anything left of my Santa Suit from the Cacophony event earlier in the
evening, I will be wearing that. If it is trashed I will be wearing by
super hat with all the blinking lights !!

See ya there,
hugs'n'kisses,
Vince

PS: I've missed you guys ;(

[This purports to be a letter from Don Wildmon, head of the American
 Family Association.  It's not yet validated, but if it is a joke,
 the jokers sure got the patter right.]

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Dear Friends:

Once again, it is time for us to stand up and tell the liberal
entertainment industry that America will not tolerate the continual
erosion of the minds of our young people with obscene pornography
disguised as "family entertainment".

The Walt Disney Company, one of America's leading distributors of lucrative,
mind-rotting garbage aimed at children--THE LION KING, ALADDIN--is at it
again.  TOY STORY, the company's big Christmas release, is positively the
most disgusting example of Hollywood's use of pornography to line its
coffers since ABC-TV's NYPD BLUE.

Some of the following descriptions may be offensive, so please keep this
out of the hands of your children:

In TOY STORY, rated G by the ultraliberal MPAA, the main characters,
"Woody"--note sexual reference--and "Buzz"--note drug reference--are
owned by a child in a single-parent household in which the father is
noticeably absent.  "Woody" and "Buzz" have equally disturbing toy
friends, including a sex-obsessed talking potato, a sex-obsessed Bo Peep
doll who cannot keep her hands (or lips) off "Woody," and an Etch-a-Sketch
whose "knobs" must be "adjusted" to produce results.

(For a complete report on TOY STORY, see the December issue of the AFA
Journal, available from the American Family Association, P.O. Drawer
2440, Tupelo, MS  38803.)

This is obviously material not acceptable for children, yet Disney has aimed
this wallow in the gutter squarely at the hearts and minds of our youth.  We
MUST tell them that we will NOT allow them to continue this mind pollution.
I URGE you to make copies of this letter and DISTRIBUTE it to your friends
and neighbors and boycott TOY STORY and all of its tie-in products
IMMEDIATELY.

And PLEASE write or call the creators and distributors of this filth and
let them know that you are FED UP with their reckless and immoral
actions.  AFA efforts like this are keeping pornography off store shelves,
off television sets, and out of the theaters and video stores of America,
but we MUST NOT LET UP.  As long as Hollywood does not get the message
and WAKE UP, we must continue to tell them how America feels.

Write to:    Chrm. Michael Eisner
             The Walt Disney Co.
             500 S. Buena Vista Street
             Burbank, CA  91521

Or phone:    818-560-1000

Hollywood IS listening.  We ARE winning battle after battle.  And with
your help, we will win the war.  Boycott TOY STORY.  Tell your friends
and neighbors.  The children of America thank you, and I thank you.

God bless,

Don

 Does anyone have any opinions of the healing ritual Vortex? How was the 
last one? I see it's on the calendar again for this Saturday , and
I may be able to get to it , instead of the Gathering .

 I am going to meet some friends for dinner Saturday night , and I was
thinking of talking them into going to something later that evening.
They are in their early 30s . I was thinking of Vortex - the Gathering
may be too big and expensive an event for their first time.

 Any other recommendations?

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

 PS - I'm going to be 41 on Jan. 8th , so I don't think they're too old
   to rave!

What kind of food are you interested in?  Here are some of my favorites 
that are on the cheap side (all near Berkeley Bart):
Burritos/taqueria:  Cancun
Vegeterian/Chinese: Long Life Veggie House

fellow ravers, 

i write you today to tell you about the healing and celebratory event that
mission vortex will be putting on this saturday, starting at around 7:30. if
you've been assiduously reading all the sfraves messages over the past few
months and you have an especially keen memory, you might remember that
mission vortex threw a healing rave a month or two ago, and that i wrote you
all about the wonderful time i had there. now it's happening again. 

mission vortex is an experience designed to bring people together for a
common purpose: healing, regeneration, renewal, celebration - whatever you
choose to call it. to this end, we have brought many different kinds of
healers into our project - body workers, vibrational healers, local shamans,
musicians, visual artists, and other people who are working to bring fullness
into their lives, and share it with others. 

essentially, we can't know what the event is going to be like until it
actually starts to happen. all we can do, as the volunteers who are helping
make it work, is put our energy into the preparations before the event and
then bring all peace, love, untiy and respect we have within us to the actual
event.

we are hoping for an alcohol-free, smoke-free environment, but i'm not sure
whether or how we're going to enforce this. i should tell you now that i am
not the organizer or promoter of this event. this is a grass-roots
collective, and we operate in a democratic, non-hierarchical fashion. i'm
just the person in the group who is the most closely linked to sfraves, which
is why i have the responsibility of writing this letter to you. 

there will be a $15 cover, the proceeds of which will go towards a fund
established for the creation of a healing center in hawaii.  if you have
questions about this, you can call dino at 510.428.1961. 

if you're interested in helping future mission vortex events succeed, i would
suggest calling dino, leaving you name and number with him, or on his
machine, and telling him how you'd like to help. 

if you would like to come join us on saturday, the voicemail number to call
is: (415) 435 7981. the healing ritual will begin at 7:30, after which, the
dancing will begin, at around 10:00. 

music-lovers, this will not be a night of hard techno, jungle, or house. the
 dj in the main dance area is Cheb i Sabbah, who many of you may already
know. he spins ethnotrance & etc. we'll also have an unknown [not "Unknown"]
cdj spinning ambient in the chill-out room. his name is david and he's quite
good. 

i hope to see some of you there. i don't know what i'll be wearing and i
don't have a sfraves laminate (woe is me), so i don't know how i'd find you,
but my name is shalom and if we do happen to meet - lovely. 

come join us, whether you're shy, gregarious, or somewhere in between. 

shalom
or 
dissssssssssssolve, 
whichever i happen to be at the moment.

Ya'll,


Was thinking about going to "a single red light" tonight just in case
I can't make it to gathering tomorrow ( three! christmas parties). The
flyer looks like it might be a bit more clubby, housy then I'd
prefer. Does anyone know the DJs: Chris Lum, Ruben Mancias, Miquel,
and Dave Peterson? I know you do! Any of these guys play more hard
techno, trancy stuff? Any opinions of the site 1434 howard@10th? The
flyer even says "jass vibe" on it. I can dance to Eric Dolphy with the
correct alignment of the planets, but we all like to know what the
seen will be like.

Almost anything is fine with me.   I tend to avoid spicy food,  but
anything you mentioned is fine.

Does anyone know anything about "Club Freaky"? My friend 
Jason and I would like to go. And is it 18 and over or 21 and 
over? 

Actually, if anyone can recommend another club in the city on 
Saturday night, let me know. We feel like doing a night on 
the town kinda thing. 18 and over too! 

peace,
amy :)       Smile guys!

Go to single red light tonight! The location's cool and so is the music. But
it probably won't satify you techo-acid heads out there. It's more on the
house side if anything, which i agree can get a little boring, so I'll tell
chris lum to bring some acid/trance. He works at BPM , call him if you want
to know more about it.

hope to see you there

Hey y'all! Does anybody know how best to get in touch with the man like
Dutch Starbuck? There's a friendly young woman in Fargo, North Dakota
(rweir@reed.edu) that would like to talk to him about booking him for a
party, but she and I discovered that his account at slip.net has vanished.
Obviously, he has realized that slip.net's service is patchy and overpriced,
but his wise decision to leave that place of horror leaves us with no easy
way to get in touch with him. Help me, O sfraves community, you're my only
hope!

BTW, is everybody properly psyched for this weekend? Two cool house parties
(one involving 70s ski outfits and fondue) and the Gathering! Woo hoo! Time
to kick into hardcore party mode!

yrz, 
ozy

What does "Electro" sound like.  I've probably heard it and just didn't know
the name.

A couple of people have asked:

>>What classifies electro?  

It's radness. Rhythm and sound. It's where techno and hip-hop come from.
It's being rediscovered as a influential-but-previously-ignored style. Pure
dancing music. It's humorous sometimes. They play it at MaD Mondays
sometimes. Come Tuesday to the Bahia and hear for yourself.

Hey...it was me!  I'm going tonight to the city so I can't chcek my mail 
anymore after this.  Amy says she'll be by the right speaker in the 
Dedication room.  That's where I'll try to be.  Terrible at descriptions 
and I don't even know what to wear yet.  I've got strawberry blond hair, 
a little past my shoulders, very wavy.  Planning on wearing a skirt or 
jeans.  I know that's not much help...just Yell "Marty"  and I'll find ya!!

Later...

House, House, House... Did someone say "... let there be house?"

Yes, a single red light is straight up house. But it's gooooood, mmmm,
yummy house.  I went to the last one and it was great, good (and new, at
least for me) space, and excellent vibe. I'd recommend it.

Hi folx,

I heard a rumor that Eat Static will be doing a FREE party in the Nevada desert
on New Year's Eve.  Has anyone heard about this?  The person I heard it
from has always been a reliable source of information but, it just seems
too good to be true.  Can anyone verify this?

Peace

Hey everybody!

Hope to see you all at the Gathering, this here's an invitation to 
please come say hi if you notice me!  Here's my description:

    Will probably have an SFR laminate that Vince's going to bring me; 
will be wearing black Converse high-tops, hot-pink tye-dye leggings, a 
black t-shirt with glow-in-the-dark star-systems on the front and back. 
I have shoulder-length wavy-ish brown hair, am 5'8", and will probably 
be with Wayne, Amy Starkey, et al.  Come say Hi!!

I live in San Jose and I heard this boom...I awoke to my apartment 
shaking...at first I thought it to be an earthquake!  This was by far the 
loudest thunder I have ever heard!  I couldn't go back to sleep for a 
while after that cause my heart was a beatin.  All the car alarms started 
going off too.

Very trippy!

Hi everyone, I've been following this list from my work account for a few
weeks now and I think it's time for me to come out of the woodwork.  My
name is Rob and I've been out of the rave scene for a couple years but I
kinda want to see what its like now.  I used to be into raving in So Cal.
while I was in college but I didn't like the way that everyone was too into
Xing or whatever.  So I'm back home now and I miss going out and dancing
and having a little fun(a cool thing about being in school-9to5's suck).
So by luck I find you all.

Anyways, I've never been to anything up here and I figure that this
Gathering is as good a place as any to get back into it.  But first can I
ask some questions?(Let me know if these ???'s are things that shouldn't be
asked)

1. Where is the Gathering?

2. Whats a laminate and how do I get one?

3. Did anyone decide on a place to meet inside the Gathering?  It'd be cool
to meet people from the list and connect faces to email addresses.

Thanks everyone,

peace
rob

There's been so much talk about meeting before & during the Gathering; I
just want to make sure the talk doesn't die off before the actual event...

...so, who's going to be at (pick a restaurant) near the Berkeley Bart
station before the party (at 10pm or so?) and where will people be meeting
at the Gathering itself? I've only been on this list for a few weeks, and
I'm curious to finally meet all y'all.

Does anyone have any *inside* tips on the location of the gathering? It'd
make it a lot easier to work out transportation and a meeting spot.

-mikey.

Between dec. 20 and jan. 15 I will be UNREACHABLE
at "lachim@uclink4.berkeley.edu." Instead, you can
reach me through my dad's account: tomaszmig@aol.com.
Put "Mail for Mike" in the subject header or something.

Call the info line tomorrow. The location ("20 minutes east of SF") will be
up on the line sometime in the late afternoon I think...

I don't think this got out since my usual mail headers went down with my
old hard drive. But if it did I've augmented the thoughts anyway.

One possible thing to do pre-Gathering is to stop at the *Rockridge* BART,
which is actually in North Oakland. Within a short walking distance you
have Zachary's pizza to the North, a burger shop, a coule of nice Japanese
restaurants, and Dryers Ice cream. To the south along College you get
Cactus Taqueria, College Ave Burrito, Olivetto, Edible Complex, Diesel
Books, Gaucho's Rotisserie, Saturn Records (real records), and Pegasus
Books. If you've never been to Zachary's pizza it's the best deep dish
Chicago pizza, bar none, in the Bay Area

Finally, you can top it all off with a 10 to 15 minute hike down to Your
Momma's House cafe, where honest to gosh sfravers actually spin music on
Saturday nights. I don't know if stareyes is in town to do her set, but
I'll be on doing my disco acid house thang from 11-1 at the very least
before I boogie on over to the Gathering.

Latez.

It seems that maybe some folks might need a little
education on the roots of the music that they dance
to these days, a young brother out of uiuc has made
a House Nation site http://www.cen.uiuc.edu/~x-rave/HouseNation.html

of particular interest might be

It looks like the Aussies have discovered the Boom Box party concept...
Interesting discussions going on about the shutting down of Happy Valley
(A large music concert/rave).

        Here's a list of some upcoming events I've heard about...

        Friday March 6th through Sunday March 8th - The WOOPY BALL - 
                yes, a weekend-long rave, taking place in Oakland.

        Friday March 6th - Primal Scream at the Warfield.
                okay, I know this isn't exactly "underground", but it's
                being billed as a rave, and rumors exist that the Orb is
                gonna be there, too.....

        Saturday, March 7th - The Gathering
                This sounds great. Jeno, Garth, and Josh. 415-267-4800

        I'd elaborate on each of them but I have to go to class in about
ten minutes.....:)

        Wow! 35 subscribers in 24 hours! This may get gigantic......

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's coming up on 4 years that sfraves has been in operation,
four years since the whoopy ball (where I first "felt the vibe")
four years from my first FMR (when I truly became a raver)

I've seen the Scene go through it's gyrations it's ups and it's downs.
It's ins and it's outs, as far as old timer's go. I'm not really an
"old timer" though, many of the true old timer's are not on this list, though
some of them are (and you know who you are :)

I guess for me, the "Rave" scene has been something that has brought 
incredible happiness to me (it has also brought some incredible sadness
to some).  When I look back in my life, I realize that I was always
a raver, really!, when I was 16 years old in Baltimore, we would take
Acid and listen to Curved Air, Pink Floyd, Gong, Yes (still remember
classics like Close to the Edge) and dance and dance and dance.
(For some of you folks who don't know me, I'm going to be 39 in 24 days)
In the 80s when I was a video artist, I used to fantisize about all night
dance parties with computer controlled video and lights, that would
be synchronized to the music, which would be DANCE MUSIC.  I always
found dancing hard and long to be the best way to beat back the blues,
rally spirit, and bring about direct change in one's life.  Being a
member of an "underground" video art collective called Subterranean
Video (operating out of Boston), we were dedicated to "breaking new 
ground in Television", looking at the screen as a canvas, trying to
break the spell of a decade that was dominated by an Actor acting as 
a President. Much of our early work of deconstruction of the TV image and 
the "psychedelic" splash of the Sandin IP (Image Processor), I see echoed
in just about every major Visual production that exist at parties today.
When I went to my first Toon Town, I realized that other folks had
those fantasies as well, and that I was not alone.  When I went to
the Whoopy Ball and the FMR it was like a homecoming,  I immediately
recognized the Energy.  People were taking back their freedom of expression
and their freedom of consciousness, what was totally styfiled in the
80s was welling up again.  When I went to my first FMR at Grey Whale Cove,
I was amazed that people were assembling at this remote location in the
middle of the night, forsaking late night TV and even sleep or sex to
be at this spot, dodging, even calmly ignoring the Highway Patrol who
was up on US 1 trying to trick people into going home with threats of towing
(which never happened :), and down on the Beach, a sound system, playing
joyous, loud, happy and defiant music, (and the police powerless to stop it:)
I was hooked immediately; what an apt form of non-violent protest for the
coming police state.  Here were a group of people all races, ages, 
nationalities, who were loosing sleep, even though many had to go to work 
or school in the morning, to be together, to do this "thing", to participate
in a group gesture of love, joy and power, to take back the wild and public
places, to revel at the Full Moon as so many of our ancestors did.

Things change and ebb and flow, the Bush babies are gone and we are replaced
by a more "hip" president (who doesn't know how to smoke pot correctly:)
It seems like the coming police state has abated, (but those of us who work
in cyberspace know full well it is just as present as ever, though it's
face has succeeded in being "Kinder and Gentler" to the public).

And what has happened to raving? That wonderful flower of youthful defiance?
Do the people who go to FMRs create it as their own? Are they participating
in a celebration, or is it just about how many Es/Balloons/beers/hits/lines
you can take while littering the beach with cigarette butts.

I'm not so sure I could face the Santa Cruz sherriff like I did that
warm summer night so long ago and tell him that all we want to do is dance
and enjoy this beautiful beach and this beautiful summer night and that
we'll leave the beach cleaner then we found it.  All things ebb and flow
and maybe it's just human nature, nay maybe just Nature it'self for
creatures, Energy, movements to blossom, bloom, mature, wither, die
and be reborn again.  It seems like our Scene has past it's prime.
Now I'm sure some of you out there will say, stop whining about how it
used to be, I wasn't there and things are great for me right now!
This may be true but try to think about it this way...

Suppose you grew up next to a beautiful brook that bubbled out of the
ground at the bottom of a mountain, when you were little, you could drink 
from it's source, about a mile down there was a pond, with all kinds of
frogs, and little fish, you used to go play with the turtles, and polywogs,
and duck the dragon-flies.  As you got older and were in high school, they
began to drill out the mountain to put some type of factory there,
the brook remains, but the pond starts to get over grown and to smell funny,
the water is slimy and you wouldn't think of drinking from the brook or
swimming in the pond (your too old for that anyway). Now your 27 and come 
home to visit your folks (who still live the next town over) you go back
to the old neighborhood and look in on where you spent your early years,
the brook is now a "waterway" cement walls on both sides, with a chain-link
fence to keep out the kids, the water level is high due to the rain
that the area has been having so the current is swift, but the water is grey.
There is not doubt in your mind that to drink even a sip could put you
in the hospital. The pond with the turtles and the dragon-flies is nowher
to be found but there is a new Mc Donald's approximately where you think 
it used to be.   Are you being silly to lament the polluting of your
brook?  Are we being silly to speak out about the pollution of the Scene?
Are we being silly to speak out against the pollution of our World?
Maybe if we speak out and say hey! Wait a minute, stop that! or Find 
another Way!  We might be able to save our Brook, Our Scene, Our Planet

I hope so.

For me, it becomes increasingly hard to go out these days.  A Scene that
used to include every race, every sexual preference, every type of
House music (Because there IS only one House Music which is Our House Music)
has once again become factionalized into Straight, Gay(Garage), 
Gangsta(black/hispanic), White(techno/trance), Wicked, Goodness, etc.

I remember meeting a guy at a ToonTown years ago, he was a real buff
"white guy" and we shared a speaker together one night, deep into the
vibe of a raging Techno track, which was ALL that mattered at the time,
later that evening we talked briefly, I detected an accent from my past,
when I asked him, sure enough, he was from Brooklyn (I live there as well
grades 1 - 9), I said wow! so am I, he asked me what part, I said "Bedford
Stuyasant, how bout you?" He said "Bensenhurst", for a moment we both looked
at each other with a sort of strange glint in our eyes, we both knew
the ramifications of our respective turf, (mortal enemies). then he smiled
and said "Aren't you glad we don't have to put up with that shit anymore?"
I said "Yes my brutha, I am" We gave each other a "manly hug" and continued
to party.  Where are the parties that reach out and break down those kind 
of barriers?  What has happened to our Scene is that we have become way too
self-righteous, too selective, too exclusive and way too willing to blame
the Other.  On the eve of the Gathering I want to ask everyone out there
who is going out to really look into your heart, FEEL THE MUSIC!! Whether
HARDCORE or HOUSE, the power is there IN THE MUSIC, NOT THE DRUGS, THE
MUSIC!!, in the music is the power to save the Scene. Also extend your Family
DON'T JUST MEET PEOPLE WITH SFR Laminants, meet people without LAMINANTS,
meet people who are scary to you, spread the vibe, you won't be disappointed.


I will be at the Gathering, Luv Phasers armed to Kill (with kindness :)
I WON'T be wearing my SFR LAMINANT (but I will carry it:) You will just have
to find me without it (I bet a lot of big black guys will be getting
hugs from strangers, this is good, the bruthas could sure use em')


I'll see you all first bass bin on the left :)

        Nope, Don Wildmon (a more ironic name i could never think of! ha

art or culture from his extremely right wing views belie a really fucked up
vision of humanity and sexuality.  I mean, his mind is in the gutter 24/7!
Check out the movie "Banned in the USA" which is about him, 2 Live Crew,
Andreas Serrano, Robert Mapplethorpe and other "pornographic" artists.

ok, ok.

no one seems to be following up on the "meeting somewhere near the Berkeley
Bart station before the Gathering thing."

But I know there were people who seemed interested, so, how about this:
right in front of the main entrance to the station on Shattuck ave (the
round glass building where the escalators are) at 9pm sharp. I'll be there
if anyone responds to this message by 8:30 or so.

I'm not trying to bum a ride or anything, I'm just looking for someone to
meet and share a Bart trip to the event. supposedly it's really close to the
Richmond station.

As you go in, there's a room where the main water/juice bar is.  I'd
recommend there.

It's a killer space, btw. Large, warehouse feel and I don't think it's been
used before.

	i had a brief experience with Mission Vortex that i'd like to 
share with you all, i'm not sure if the subject line should read "not 
rave related" or not???
	Jana and i arrived at around 9:00, and were greeted with sage and 
face painting.  We looked around...  everyone lying on the ground 
massaging each other...  sorta.  We were sort of amazed that people 
actually were doing this on their own free will, and marveled at how 
great it was...  but then this uncomfortable feeling came over us, as we 
examined the situation further...  there were clusters of people maybe 5 
or 6 of them, each cluster focusing on one person.  And there was this 
other person walking around giving instructions.?.?.?  telling them to 
switch people, slow down, breathe, etc...
	We started to feel like we were doing something wrong by NOT 
participating, we were still sitting off in the corner.  This just added 
to the uncomfortableness of the situation.  There was only someone 
playing bells at this point so i couldn't just trance out.  We were 
watching, and for that we were being watched...i'm finding it hard to 
describe my feelings about this portion of the event, so i'll just go on...
	Eventually ~10 min.  someone came up to us and did a great job 
making us feel like we should join one of the groups...  So, we did, 
reluctantly...  we got led over to these people kneeling around this 
other person, seemingly massaging them, i personally did not witness any 
massaging at all, i guess it was more like cellular holding, or maybe 
pressure therapy???...  Suddenly the guy walking around the outside 
says...  "with this many people in the group, it's easy to lift them off 
the ground."  nobody in our group really responded, but i heard one of 
them ask "are we supposed to lift her off the ground now?"  and then the 
leader guy says louder, "it's EASY to lift them off the ground"  and they 
all responded, lifting her off the ground.  it was all really schoolish.
	then the music started.  quietly.  trance/acid at about 135 bpm!  
people start clapping, and suddenly the whole dance floor erupts, and 
everyone (except the 5 ravers sitting on the floor staring in amazement) 
starts dancing around cheering and clapping...  it really reminded me of 
a high school dance.  The DJ "DJ cheb i sabbah" had a strange mixing 
style that i had never seen before.  He inserted periods of silence in 
between the songs,  it seemed to kill the dance floor every time 
though...  =(
	He spun for ~15 minutes, and then one of the Leader type people 
got everyone into a circle.  said a little bit of cool stuff about energy 
and love, nothing special, then started the group doing things again...  
"run in to the middle"  "do it again"  "now do it backwards"  "feel the 
energy"  "touch some one's ankle, but don't let anyone touch yours"
	i looked at Jana and said "My bag is right next to me, we could 
escape right now!"  The next moment we were outside (with the rest of the 
ravers)...  and someone said on our way out "they're running out the door".

	i felt bad, again because i felt like i was doing something wrong 
by not participating.  One of the reasons i LOVE the rave scene so much 
is because of the quality of the ritual, and the personal-ness, each 
person has thier OWN ritual to bring into the bigger ritual...  I guess 
Mission Vortex just wasn't my taste...

	...but we did leave early ~11:00  so it may have changed.?.?.?

Oh Kewl i get to give the first review! Ok, if you saw me, you were either
pissed cause i wouldn't let you in on the guest list, or because I was behind
the counter eating and not serving water! The music was slamming, the VIBE
WAS AWSOME!!! It was a really good party. I was the dude at the end who stood
up on the table and took pictures behind Doc, I had a toon town shirt on, and
blue jeans, I had brown hair(Still do) in a pony tail. I forgot my laminate,
anyway, I took like 30 pix, and I'll see if they will put them up on the web
site. I heard there was bunk E going around that was giving people rash's and
stuff, (Whoever was dealing bunk E....What goes around comes around)! That's
not cool. So If you saw me tell me, because I would like to put a face to the
name's here! The Party was killer!!!!!!!!!!!

I wanted to say I had an excellent time at the Gathering.
The set-up was great, the music was incredible...There's a 
lot more I could say, but i'm still really exhausted...It 
was nice to have a chance to go dancing, especially since 
i finished my finals on friday  =)  

on a more depressing note....i lost my elmo doll  =(  i feel like
the worst parent in the world.  i'm hoping that someone has taken
him to their home and that we will be reunited at another party.
if you happen to know someone who found an elmo doll, please let me
know.  he has a rave hat with 'happy' and 'smile' stickers along
the edge of his hat...anyways, thanks for the help...

still recovering....

Hello.

There are thoese who could say....Pricey...
There sre thoese who could say....Commerical....

There are thousands of reasions not to of liked The Gathering.

But I'd have to say I had one of the most wonderful experiances this year @
an event... Just the sight of seeing you, my virtual familiy kept me smiling
all night.  The vibe was high and it was you, the people, that helped keep it
alive. And who was taking pictures??? I was dancing and *FLASH* I was stunned
for about a few seconds....

Allthough not everything was peaches and cream...
-The continual shortage of H2O
-A guest list (?) for a rave...
-The unfortunate confiscations of certian substances and medias to use thoses
substances.  

I hesitate to include price into that factor, due to the fact that that
warehouse was waaaaay messy in the morning.  As well as the fact (hopefully)
a certian proceeds go to helping out thoses more unfortunate than ourselves.
 

And in the end, isn't that what it's all about?  Helping each other?

A big Hello to:
Vince, Wayne, Amy, Austin, Rikki (and company)... Umm, Eric, Wendy, Rick,
Mike (although I didn't see you) and the plethora of others I danced with,
Hugged, shared vibes with ect. 

BTW: I was guy dancing about with the black cap, funny redlight / bluelight
glasses, black shirt, white teeshirt, black jeans and white, dirty, shoez.

And allthough The Gathering was nice I still think the smaller venues are
what makes it for me.

C-ya neXt weekend,

Spins

Adam

I'd have to agree: Gathering rocked my fucking world!
Saw a few folk with some sort of laminate on, but wasn't sure if they 
were sfravers or not. Ah well, respect to any of the beautiful people 
that I *did* meet last night.  I was the boy in the techno room with the 
long brown hair, green jeans, black shirt, and PHAT grin who never 
stopped dancing all night long. :)

Yeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!

Sums it up fairly well.  I am not even gonna go into da D-tails cuz it was
ALL good Last night.
I had a faboulus time last night...  Finally met some sfravers ..What's up
Amy,Adam,Wayne,Vince(Thant's for the Laminate Finaly got one. :),  uuummm I
think there were a few more but I met sooo many people last night -all the
names a jumbled together.  I danced my ass off in both rooms and loved every
minute of it.
    I met some people fron S.Diego and Oreagon (sorry sp) and they all
mentioned how lucky we are in the Bay area to have such a loving and
community oriented scene.  I agree, thanks to you people out there.      Keep
the Vibe alive.

Love

Ok, I'm not trying to start something here, but check it out....It ends
happily. I want to know why some people would have the nerve to bring a piece
of shit toy, that obody would enjoy. Now I understand you saved 5 dollars
but....It's not about the money, its about the kids in need, and helping
others out, No love for the fools who brought, matchbox cars that were
missing windows and wheels, and g.I. Joe dolls with no arms, some people make
me sick!:( But there is some glimmer of hope, one girl brought in a huge Lion
and that was cool, but she said to me, "I better get a big discount for
shlepping it here," that bummed me out she said that.... To sum this up, The
scene is about love, and breaking the boundaries, and being yourself. To many
people are full of shit , and it makes me sad that people are that way. If
this doesn't make any sense, read A Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger.
There are way to many phonies in this world. On a positive note, I didn't get
one bad look, or bad vibe from anyone, I made many new friends and hopefully
you did too! I am not looking to be flamed here!
Just my 5 bucks worth.

I have just two questions. 

1) Just how much money did The Gathering make (net)?
2) How much of that profit is going to charity?

What a monster space.  PLenty of room for everyone. Yes the water 
shortage was kinda bad but liquids were available in some form or another 
I suppose.

in search of the pocket of vibe.  That was all I could think of was "Find 
the vibe...find the vibe"  I got a high number of occurances in the 
techno room and less in the house room but maybe because the house room 
was so packed with standers and sitters or maybe because I just don't 
know what I'm doing and I couldn't get where I wanted to go.

It sure does get confusing.

the trash factor was almost funny.  Trying to walk without kicking stuff 
into peoples faces (especially the ones who like to lay down right smack 
in the middle of the dancefloor) or trip on an empty water bottle.  WHat 
a mess.  WHen I see that I just wonder why I come to these events.  
There's always a trash factor, and I do love the vibe.. so where does 
that leave me I just don't know.  

meanwhile, we must dance.

Started my day off at Great Expecations Bookstore to get Timithy Leary to 
sign my copy of Grand Royal #2. Leary looked a bit more baffled than 
usual as he scanned that Mark Riebling article which exposed his long 
standing affliation with the CIA, it looked as though it was the first 
time anyone had brought that article to his attention. He asked who 
were the people resposible for the publication and I answered that it was 
the Beastie Boy's fanzie...but I don't think regestered much either. 
Regardless though, I got the man's signature which was as good an omen 
as any to kick off the weekend.

Sun, Ryann, and I didn't get to Oakland till about midnight. Spent a 
while freezing in line, let a stranger next to me borrow my sweat jacket, 
and watched as packs of bubble-gum ravers bum rushed their way past us. 
Tried to bare no hard grudges. 

During this time had one of those moments where, even though you don't 
want to go off making snap judgements or blankent generalizations, but... 
to be quite honest, you feel a lot of bad karma being tossed around, much 
like when someone decides to share their racism with you. It makes you 
think, "Are these the people that I really want to party with ?" Because 
if this is one of the situations where You Are Who You Fuck, then you've 
just become that 30 year old dude from Dazed and Confused and I don't know 
if I really want to be that guy...

What impressed me then, and throughout the night, was that the Gathering 
had all the basic elements to be a really sketchy scene, but wasn't. ((at 
least from where I was standing. I don't know how many acts of violance 
there were so I could be wrong)) I attribute a lot of that on Faith, 
Faith and Integrity. Integrity that you can see in the form of photo 
flyers, 5 min voice messages, and people saying Thank You.

In terms of raving and San Francisco, it's taken me quite a while to find 
my dance. e is an invaluable learning tool in that process, but something 
I didn't want to become dependant on ((in general and last night in 
particular)). Triping & Trancing are great to have your visions, but, at 
least for me, it's also really easy to fall into a single track mentality 
: introverted : obsession with 1 : person : DJ : thing. Shrooms kind of 
help me break that paradigm by not only opening the universe up around 
you, but also by puting a twist on things and giving you the oppurtunity 
to see the people behind you who your dance might be influeincing and the 
other distant personalities from which to draw strength from.

We're all shaped by experiences. I think sometimes all psychodelics do is 
increase the significance of those infante moments that normally you 
wouldn't concesiouslly register. In more of an abstract level I though a 
lot about recharging karma batteries, learnig how to project & pogo at 
the same time, and a few other concepts that I really couldn't interpert 
to you in a sentance. 

Specifically though, I resolved last night to ((try)) and bow more 
often in the future to show respect to my elders : peers. Buddist Boy 
Scout Merit Badge.

Hope you and yours got something out of the evening as well. 

Enjoy the corporate holidays.

later.

Bolger


end note : On the trek home, Sun sported our morning breakfast at a 
local coffee dive. He paid for the meal with a ten dollar bill and 
recieved exactlly 3:03 back in change...the signifacance of which 
wasn't lost to either of us.

[ To SFRaves mailist ]

 I'm getting somewhat overwhelmed with work and the joy of meeting lost-
seperated friends and the self-imposed responsibilities of the holiday
season ... not much mental time to devote to replying to some of the 
great and interesting topics that have been here on SFRaves lately -
especially the "shyness posts" and Geoff White's recent post of the past
and present of his personal rave history. 

 I'd just like to say that I'm glad to seem something in SFRaves in addition 
to just "where's the good raves?/that raves was great!/that raves sucked!".

 I didn't go to anything this weekend , so I appreciate any posts about
this weekend's raves - I have nothing against rave reviews on SFRaves!

 May God and/or the Gods or "Powers" or Angels or whatever benevolent you
beleive in take special care of every one of you in this season. ( Of 
course , if you get drunker than a fish in a vat of vodka and then go
driving in the fog , you're asking your guardian angels for more than
what's in their job description! ).

 Happy and Joyous and Safe and Lucky Holy Days To You!

I don't know the exact answer to this question but I'm sure
the answer lies some where in the low end of 5 figures, my guess.

Why is this important at all? how much of your income do you donate to
charity?  Martin is a party promoter, he also has a clothing company.
He lives by doing these two things.  He, like me, is dedicated to
trying to spread a message to a large number of people, this takes
money. For me, I took a bunch of money that I made (actually MOST of
the money I still make) and drop it into the black Hole of PacBell to
pay for my T1 connection, so that certain "points of view" can, and
always will have a home on the net.  Martin threw an Excellent party! I
saw straight up vato's totally blown away by the Vibe,  There is no
doubt in my mind that some lives were saved last night, maybe not at
that moment but down the line.  The  desired effect that we all wish
massives of that size could attain was achieved.  Now all of those
"newbie" ravers who haven't realized that $25 is a high price to pay
for a party will have a reference point the next time they pay it at
Cool World.

I hope Martin make a fucking mint at the party because I know from his actions
that the money will go to good use.

When I asked Martin a week ago was this party going to be worth it.
He said "I Gurantee ya man, you will leave your head in the place".
He totally made good on his promise.
This was a critical point for me because I really didn't think that you could
have large parties with that kind of Vibe and the resultant aftershocks in SF
any more.  Silly me :)  I was totally blown away by the energy in both the
Dedication Room and the Inspiration Room. There were a lot of Bruthas and
Cholos in the place which made me feel good because they were totally grooving.
Jeno came on, locked the door and immediately set about the business of
smashing heads (ego).  When it started happening I saw several people heading 
out of the room with the chareteristic frantic look on their face.  I recognized
the distant yet familiar feeling as my brain wave activity changed and I slid
into Trance State, deep and hard, it indeed had been a long time and frankly I
didn't believe that Jeno was going to rise to the occasion but he did, with
a vengance.  After Jeno "beat down" all the Ego in the room Markie came in with
some totally sick British Acid House that truly brought the freak out in just
about everyone.  Jeno beats your mind to a pulp, Markie injects the appropriate
recombinate DNA sequence to perform the appropriate genetic mutations, then
all that was left was for Doc to rebuild your psyche in the image of House :)

But seriously I had some amazing experiences.  A lot of really trippy stuff.

I'm still integrating it so I can't really talk about it. but hopefully
over the next few days I will be able to.

There's always a guest list for almost any party, and they can never find
your name. =)

I thought the Gathering was spectacular. A little large for my taste, but
given the conditions, a great event, and certainly a great vibe for the
number of people there. It absolutely seemed like LA c.1992 in there while
Tony was spinning - albeit with better music.

Ethan did a tremendous job of filling up the techno room, which had much
more energy and vibe than the house room for the first few hours. I didn't
catch all the DJ's, but Tony and Jeno were in top form, Spun brought back
the acid house, and Terry Mullen amazed everyone with his manual dexterity.
(Imagine DJ Dan growing up in the midwest, listening to Chicago acid tracks
and Detroit techno)

All in all a great party, and worth it if only to see Martin gyrating madly
in a Santa costume behind Jeno...

Joe

It is VERY important when the name of charity is being used as a 
marketing tool, to make people feel like they are doing something great 
by handing over their cash.

How much I donate to charity is not an issue, because I am not using 
charity as a tool to make my money.

As far as the message is concerned, what is that message? Unity? Tell 
that to the guy whose ass is on the curb cause he can't afford the cost 
of admission to your idea of unity. Understand that I have no problem 
with people making a profit. But it was totally unecessary to charge $25 
for this event. There comes a point when making a profit turns into 
taking advantage of. 

I am sure that a lot of people had a good time, which we will all be 
hearing about soon. Good for them. I am happy that people enjoyed 
themselves. Maybe someday they will learn that it is unecessary to make 
someone rich in order to have a good time. Maybe someday they will learn that 
unity is not something reserved for those who can afford the price of 
admission. I have seen this happen in small doses. And it is such a 
beautiful thing. Large, high profit-driven parties *PALE* in comparison.

> I hope Martin make a fucking mint at the party because I know from his actions
> that the money will go to good use.  

Geoff somehow I am less than amazed by this. Got to make a buck somehow, eh?

If Martin is doing great things for the community other than taking their 
money, please, please let me know what. I have a very negative opinion of 
the motives behind the gathering, and would very much like to find out 
that I have been wrong. I don't particularly enjoy thinking bad things about 
people, belive it or not. Anyone?

Well I couldn't ask for a better way to spend my birthday.  Though 
whatever significance my birthday has, was mostly lost or found depending 
on how I look at it as I danced away and merged with the enormous energy 
and love that filled the party.

All in all, angela and I (her first massive) had a wonderful time.  We 
did have our moments of feeling overwhelmed, but were able to ride 
through those to feeling extactic joy, and spiritual sensations of 
connectedness that I don't think I can put into words.

We spent the beginning of our time in the big room listening to tony.  
Decided to check out the techno room, after markie started playing some 
diva sounding stuff.  I was reluctant to go to the techno room, because 
that music tires me out, as it usually makes me dance fast and hard.
Upon entering the room, we felt like we were hit with this fresh bright 
energy, and realized Lee was right in saying the vibe was better in there.

We had the most fun dancing in there as we danced our asses off (had to 
take a couple of rests).  We liked the brighter lighting which I felt 
brought people together more, where in the other room the dark enviroment 
separated people a little more.

I usually prefer housyer stuff, but that fast techno stuff really got 
me.  I felt like it locked me in to this groove, that I was able to go 
crazy in.  When I say crazy its a good kind of crazy that feels great, 
outta my mind, feeling and giving the energy that is in me and beyond "me".

Well I almost didn't make this party, as I was feeling tired from having 
moved earlier in the day, and didn't know if I had enough energy to have 
a great time.  I found out I didn't need that much energy as I got plenty 
of energy from the great music coming from wonderful sound systems, and 
the combined energy radiating from everyone.  Thank you all some much for 
sharing that energy.

:)

some people see the cup half full, some half empty, some might see both.

Personally I think all the wonderful things about the party, by far out 
weighed any suffering it might have caused the world.
Hopefully those that couldn't afford the party, didn't shrivel up on a 
curb somewhere and were able to still find something worth while to do.

Subject: Why $25 and not $20
To: sfraves@hyperreal.com

Hey all,

At last years gathering it was $20.  That was at the civic center.  I 
don't know the cost of the space and the crew and everything else 
involved but as far as I can tell it couldn't have been any different 
from last years.  So why $25?  If you bring a toy you pay normal price 
but if you don't than you pay extra.  Shouldn't it have been $15 with a 
toy and $20 without?  OR ever $15 with a toy and $25 without?

I feel like a great idea was thunked up (toys for children) but who is 
going to bear the costs?  Obvioulsly just asking people to bring toys 
won't work.  Reducing the cost is a good solution.  I know it worked 
with me and all my friends.  But what of the ramifications.  IF Martin 
made the cost $15 with a toy would he risk losing his shirt (And why 
should he).  If the whole toy idea was not thought up than would the 
party have still been $25 or would it have been $20?  Truly $25 seems 
steep for a one-night party to me.   But it was legal.  That alone must 
cost money and effort.  I just can't help feeling like those people who 
paid $25 were doing it so the rest of us would bring a toy.  

Regardless of all that the party was GREAT!  I knew it would be and 
thats why I paid my $20.  Once a year I will do this.  Also, I don't 
want to sound like I'm moaning and groaning about this because  truly 
regardless of the price issue I think the toy idea is beautiful and 
should be contiuned with canned food and other dealies.

love chris

Does anyone know where to get orange (the brighter the better)

I've tried a surplus store on market between 7th and 8th (no luck).
"Surplus" in Berkeley (no luck).

A few things about this event;
 Several thousand people of several backgrounds and not one fight did I
see.  I cant say that about any club I've been to on a packed/crazy night
(Spundae last labor day!!, saw several swollen eyes,at 1015 I almost got
jacked for falling asleep on a couch! )

I've been to several big parties put on by Martin and Co. (Basics, Vision)
and even though they are large like this one, somehow there's not the
cheezee commercial feel that are at most massives (and this one was
MASSIVE)  It was nice to see a broad spectrum of people which seems to be
gettin rare and what Geoff White said about techno/ house and divisions has
been on my mind for a while and scares the fuck out of me.  Are we all just
going to divide ourselves (our scene)  into musical/racial tribes?(some say
it's too late) I guess it's just natural evolution that electronic/dance
music will branch off into so many forms lets just not forget where it came
from and what it's all about.  Maybee it takes huge parties like the
Gathering to bring all "types" together even if it's only once a year.
Overall the vibe was strong, Doc Martin made me remember the meaning of
House  I got there ealy enough to hear Stevie put down some exteeeemly hard
jungle.  The music was swimming thru my brain till late sun
night,increadible space too.  Hope we all make it to the 5 year Gathering.

SEEYA,
Mark

i was suprised how scattered teh energy was in the beginning.
as teh night wore on, the energy just pulled together, especially in the 
smaller room, about when doran was spinning. from just some dancers going 
at it to a mass of people grooving as one. it was beautiful.
i met some sfravers, but scott stood out in my mind, with that big 
smile, as they played teh last song in the morning. thanks.

warm fuzzy energy to all
and BTW, is anyone as sore as me from dancing so hard?
keep movin, keep it positive:) tom

Of course, I'm only kibitzing (because I flaked out and didn't go to
the Gathering as a result of lack of stamina, I could just tell at
11 pm I wouldn't last the night after a very tough work week), but
all I can say about the $20-vs-$25 thing is that in comparison to
other events in the same price range, Martin has always delivered 
a much better value.  I mean, just look at the latest monstrosity
being promoted by Cool World for the Kaiser on New Year's Eve.
(Since that night and that place were the locale of some of my
most cosmic Grateful Dead shows, this one particularly sticks in
my throat.)  

I'm not going to go into the ins and outs of event pricing, since it
is far more complicated than anyone has hinted so far, but let me
boil it down to this: the same people who take home the profits for
these big events also put serious hard out-of-pocket money on the line,
and it is very possible to lose it, quick and large.  I say this with
some regret as a reformed concert promoter :)

We can quibble about the details, but frankly, looking at the very
happy reports coming in from y'all about the Gathering, even from
the many who don't particularly care for the mega-event scene, I'd
have to say that from SF on up north to at least Seattle, Martin's
events are some of the very few that sustain any of the *real* rave vibe
(I've heard very good things about Futur and Area 51 in that regard, as
well).  

I wouldn't do things the way he is doing them, but then I'm not putting
months of effort and big sums of my money on the line either.  

In general, I think the customer has the right to judge the quality of
the event, each on our own terms, according to the price, ambience,
music, lighting, security and general space.  But I think it's important
as well to be fair and consider the perspective of party organizers as
well.

We are still a very long way from the mega-commercial arena events in
Europe, where they are turning DJs into demigods and using all the
tricks of arena rock shows to bludgeon the masses into submission.

As Andrew Rawnsley so clearly notes in the new XLR8R, based on his
view of things just back from the UK, I think the moment has arrived
where our scene, once a rebellion against the stale, money-mad, 
artistry-deadening cattle calls of the rock arena music world, has now
gotten so stale and business oriented that we will have to rebel once
again, from within this time.  I suspect in that context events like
the Gathering will help remind us how it doesn't have to be limos,
fireworks and contrived mayhem to keep the masses entertained.  House
*and techno* are based on a more personal sense of communication that
does not scale up well without losing its soul.  

My kibitzing $0.02 for the first day of Hanukkah, a week before Christmas
and, most notably, three days before the ending of the solar year and
the start of another . . .

You might want to try Industrial Safety Supply in Emeryville, or Hawkins
Traffic Safety Supply in Berkeley.  They're both in the Yellow Pages, under
'Safety' and 'Traffic Safety' respectively.  I don't know if either has
orange _jumpsuits_, but when our lab needed snazzy reflective coverings for
some HazMat barrels (I know I know, boo! hiss!!) I remember almost
everything in those places was some shade of Day-Glo Orange=81 8)  Good luck=
!

I don't know if he promised that any of the proceeds were going to charity,
merely the toys.

Why don't you call Martin and ask him - Communion 415 284-0180 - if you
care that much about it. Martin has done more than any other major promoter
to try and keep big parties true to the spirit of raving. Yeah, they're on
the more massive tip, but that's a known factor. If you don't want to go,
don't go. He's done more than anyone else I can think of to get city
governments to understand exactly what raving is about and has been
successful in having legal events which even earn kudos from most local
agencies involved without much hassle evident to the partygoers. He's
playing the game, sure, but he's playing it _well_. And if you talk to him
for awhile about where he's been and where he's going you'll see he's not
out to make a fast buck.

There are many others better deserving of this sort of criticism.

They could not have thrown this party if they didn't pay the Oakland police
over $5,000!!! then they needed many permits. Money was't going to charity,
it was toys going to charity. The use of the Native americans is not a
marketing ploy. And all the money goes right back into the next party. If you
think Martin and Comp. threw this party cause they wanted to make a buck. You
better think again, because all they wanted to do was  make some people happy
and have a good time.

The Gathering
============

Martin,  you did it this time....  You pulled off one of the most amazing rave
events I've ever had the honor of attending.    Everything about it was
RIGHT ON...    A BIG venue,  plenty of room,  pumpin sound,  cool
(temperature wise).   Don't know how many attended,   but it was thousands.

I was able to talk Nate into stopping my "Your Mama's" cafe in Berkeley
(Actually Oakland).   I arrive kind of early,  ordered some food,  and hung
out,  listening to some Jungle.   Very nice place.   For those looking for
me,  I
WAS there,  but Nate had "Ants in his pants",  got bored and insisted that we
leave the cafe NOW and head out to the site.    Sorry I missed those that
wanted to meet me.

We  arrive around 9 pm.   Already,  the security was in place,  so we hung
around and chilled out in front.    The venue was behind this huge Home
improvement center called "Home Base".   A HUGE warehouse.

When we were eventually let in,   after the usual security searches,  one sees
a split...   One way leads to "Inspiration",  the main room (Mostly house),
the
other way leads to "Dedication",   the (Other than house) room.    In
dedication, they were spinning Jungle,  and in "Inspiration" was pumpin
house with an incredible sound system.

They were also just setting up,  with the lights on,   so I cased the joint,
greeting the many friends that were there.    The spaces were amazing,   the
chill room wasn't that good,   few pillows or comfortable places to flop on,
but the space was perfect.   Visuals were mostly projections,  and some
video,  but (sigh!) NO LASERS!!    That's what I'm missing in raves here in
SF.
Good visual effects.   In Australia,  the lasers are amazing.

Ethan went on in "Dedication" room,  and I was right there (as well as all the
SFRavers).   As usual,  his trance sets were totally brilliant,   a little
faster
than he normally plays,   but really good acid trance.   As usual,  I WENT
OFF!  and in no time,  went ballistic,  bouncing off the walls,  floor,  other
people,  whatever.

I had absolutely no idea how long Ethan was playing,   at that point,  I didn't
care,  because the next DJ mixed in so subtly,  that I didn't notice the
change.
For a very long time,  I was lost out in that maze of happy people.
My face is still hurting from all that smiling....

I spent MOST of my time in Dedication room,   then later on,  Tony started
slowing things down,   but all night was excellent trance and house.

They closed down Dedication room around 6:30,   but by that time,  I was in
the main room,  getting it on...   Then,  the lights started coming on,   music
stopped.   Then the last song was played.    After that,   things went
silent for
a few minutes,   then the music started once again for just one more song.

At the end,  Martin thanked everyone,  and we left...

Crunchman

Thanks for the number, I just might do that. 

As far as the "spirit of raving" I am sure we all have different opinions 
on what that is. Personally I don't think that a $25 admission holds to 
the "spirit of raving" unless of course hard costs necessitated that kind 
of charge, which I find highly doubtful. I was under the impression that 
part of the "spirit of raving" included Unity. Unity of whom? Those that 
can afford $25 for a party? Is that Unity? Again, I do not expect people 
to martyr themselves to the cause, going broke for the enjoyment of 
others. Do the math. That ain't happenin here, by a LONG, LONG shot.

HI kids,

I'm not going to add to the Gathering price flame wars !!
I thought it was a good event. And YES it did not have the feel of a "Cool
World", it was a *rave*, just a big one :)

The reason for this post is, I think it would be a good idea to have Martin
subscribe to SFRaves (if he isn't already), he will probably like to hear
what we have to say, and I know we would really like to hear from him. I
don't mean fighting off flame attacks, but info about his events, ideas to
make them better, etc.. I know several promoters and DJ's are here, and
make very good use of this medium.

Just my .03 (.02 if you email a toy :) )

Vince

PS: I'll check the Communion Web page for an e-mail address, and sugest it
to him. If someone here knows Martin, maybe you could mention it to him.

Umm the only charity I ever heard mention was the donation of Toys
to needy children, I don't recall Martin mentioning anything about
donating money. Or money that he was collecting going to anything except
to pay for the production of the party plus profit.  Where did you
read about him donating money to charity.

Nor is Martin, he makes  money from throwing parties and running a clothing
company, he may give some of his profits to charity but that is a personal
decision as it is for you. He asked you to donate Toys to needy children
not money.

Oh really have you gone over the books? Do you know how much Martin paid to
rent that space?  Do you know how munch he had to bri er I mean pay off duty
police to provide security? How many 5,000 person parties have you thrown
Black Adder?

Dude, once again you are WAY off base, do you even know Martin? If you 
did you would know how he's livin and it AIN'T LARGE.  Please at least
know the people before you put out some whack bullshit.

Obviously you were not there and no $25 cannot buy you Unity.  No-one 
said it could.  Some people could not make it to this party because they 
couldn't afford it, this is true.  Somepeople can't affort the plane
fare to San Francisco or the train fare to a Friends and Family.
Martin was trying to put on a special event, not a free event.
He makes his living throwing parties, I make my living writing software
which I don't give away.  Sometimes I give away my time and energy but
not always, why do people think that every party should be free?

     Like others, I too was reluctant to go to a massive and hemmed and 
     hawed until the evening of the party.  I knew lots of "retired" ravers 
     were coming out to this event as well as other friends of mine so I 
     got psyched into going.  Sometimes you can feel the vibe building and 
     for this one, several hours before the event--even by myself at home 
     with no electricity or music :( --I could feel the pull.
     
     Yes, $25 is a lot of money but when you look at the dj line-up and are 
     familiar with the parties Martin gives, what he promotes, and his 
     _intentions_, you either pay up or pass on it.  For me, Martin is 
     always able to deliver 1) good music/dj line-up, 2) a diverse mix of 
     people, 3) a positive vibe (and introduction/experience to any 
     newbie), and 4) a concern for people in the community he's hosting the 
     party in as well as for those who have no transportation.  Aside from 
     the Food not Bombs donations at some parties, what raves have you gone 
     to that gives a discount if you provide something (in this case a toy 
     to a charity)?  And what rave promoters make arrangements for buses to 
     take people to and from a rave or for that matter, picks a location 
     near public transportation?  To me a good promoter considers his 
     audience and delivers what they want.
     
     Sure there are kinks w/Martin (from what I hear) but who doesn't have 
     some quirk about them...after all, we are human.  And what's wrong 
     with profit?  Again, if one's intention is good and not motivated by 
     the wrong reasons, then what's wrong with earning their keep?
     
     Other reasons mentioned in previous posts bring up good points about 
     working w/police, city governments and the permit process help bring 
     raving into a positive light.  Something I'd personally like to see 
     more of if we want to gain legitimacy and have less hassles w/r/t 
     venues and law enforcement.
     
     Well, onto my review of the Gathering:  It kicked!  This time for me, 
     it wasn't the music that made me go off but the vibe/psychic energy 
     and the people.  I arrived around 11:30 pm and though the line was 
     long, we were quickly searched and entered with no problem.  I'd say 
     we got in in less than 30 minutes.  Lots of positive vibe, cheery 
     faces, and wonderful builds of music w/the dj's.  I also had an 
     incredible psychic connection w/a friend that can't be described by 
     words.  I know our crown chakras were beaming lots of light by the 
     energy we felt around us and the reactions people gave us...and this 
     wasn't because we were sucking face or anything like that.  It was 
     pure love and it felt wonderful! 
     
     Also, for a woman, having long lines and no toilet paper in the johns 
     by the morning is a real pain.  Having neglected to bring a pack of 
     tissues, I wondered if I'd have the same dilemma.  Not so :)  There 
     were plenty of porta potties strategically placed around the building 
     and all the ones I visited had plenty of paper.  Sorry if this offends 
     anyone, it's just a personal peeve I have w/most venues.   
     
     I felt alot of planning went into this party to make it successful and 
     the love promoted by Martin and his crew extended beyond the core and 
     illuminated/inflamed all who were willing to receive.  I'm glad I went 
     and sorry I didn't get a chance to meet any new sfravers, but I'm sure 
     there'll be another time.
     
     Lotsa luv,
     Diane

Yeah, but Martin was to the left of him in a Santa hat and a red shirt,

Ok, in the $25 category - Cool World/FTT - straight up cashflow, from the
looks of the flyer.

Whoever threw the BASS ticket selling Bonny Doon fiasco earlier in the year
and whoever scammed Dubtribe in Santa Cruz a few months back. They've all
been discussed at length on the list.

What I said was if the promoter was truly concerned about charity they

Yes as a matter of fact I do know how much the space rental and the 
police pay off was. 

I have been part of three 5000 plus parties.

You convieniently deleted my statement regarding me *NOT* having a 
problem with people making a living. But $25? Please that isn't breaking 
even, it is making a small fortune. Why does this bother me? It directly 
conflicts with my own personal beliefs regarding "the spirit of raving." I 
will never apologize for, nor censure myself from voicing my beliefs for 
you, or anyone else.

Hey folks,

Not exactly rave-related, but I wanted to let y'all know that the site I
designed for the upcoming Digital Be-In is up at:

http://www.be-in.com

We will be doing a real-time netcast of the actual live event at this URL
on January 11th (more info at the site), but the "Mind Meld" section is up
now.

The site looks *MUCH* cooler in Netscape 2.0, so download it if you already
haven't.

peace,
ek  =o)

OK what is the Math? $25 x what? do you know how many people showed up?
Were you there to count or guestimate?
How much for the venue?
How much for Lyons?
How much for "Off Duty Officers"
How much for permits?
How much for set-up crews?
How much for lights? (some of these folks do this for a living)
How much for DJs (some DJs have families to support)
How much for portapotties?
How much for clean up and trash removal?
How much for flyer production?
How much for promotion?
How much for the electrician?
How much to bring the building to "code"?
How much for the SF gathering bus rental both too and from?
How much for a 5 million dollar insurance policy?


Remember Martin throws legal straight up parties, he doesn't cut corners
on safety.  He stands openly before the Man and will get nailed if something
happens.

No it is not breaking even, nor should it be, Martin is a business man,
if he breaksd even, he may not be able to throw another party in a while.
If he make a good profit then he can throw a better party the next time.
I make a reasonable amount of money doing what I do, I don't
write software that kills people and i feel that my work is going toward part
of the solution as opposed to being part of the problem.

It is fine for you to have your beliefs but make sure when you speak
"facts" that you get them straight.  As far as the spirit of raving is 
concerned, that can occure at a $50 party or at a free party, it's what
the participants bring with them not what they pay that creates this spirit.

I don't understand why someone will pay $20 for a hit of E, $10 for a 2 
hour movie, $25 for a lift ticket, but can't pay $25 to a person
who is trying to do the right thing.

	Let's actually see some math. The only numbers I've seen in this flamewar
are:
$25/head
5000 heads
$5k for the cops.

	Let's see:
how much for the space
how much time martin put into it
how much for the permits
how much for the sound system, equipment
how much for the djs
how much for other random employees

	Let me throw out some WAGs as to the numbers above:
space: $10k
time: 200 hours: $20k
permits: $10k
soundsystem: $6k 
djs: $10k
other random employees: $10k

Total cost: $71k
Total income $125k

	Therefore a total profit, according to my WAG (which is way
off, I am sure) of $56k. About 50% return. Significant,
yes. Monstrous, no. Does anyone have better numbers that they can
throw at the problem?

Space:  You really couldn't ask for anything better.  Plenty
of room, fresh air, nice decorations, easy to get to, safe
neighborhood.  The two dance rooms were sonically isolated from each
other and the traffic between them was smooth.  A small chill-out
tent thing with a pyramid provided a nice meditative focal stop where
I took the opportunity to sit down in a puddle of water.  I liked the
way the porto-potties where scattered around, as well as the speaker
stacks in the Inspiration (house) room.  Not only did i get to dance
while waiting to pee, but one booth I entered during Markie's set 
acted as resonance chamber and, well, it shook my world.  Apologies to
the person who entered the stall after me.

Vibe: Overall, very good.  I felt there were times that the energy 
in the house room dipped with a percentage of people sitting on
the floor or not dancing.  But the Dedication (techno) room seemed to
always be going off.  I split my time pretty evenly between the two and
can't think of a moment where I wasn't having a shitload of fun.
Everyone everywhere was friendly, I got tons of smiles, some
handshakes, and happy talk from many "strangers".  There seemed to be
plenty of diversity, and lot's of respect.  And Geoff, you were like a
vibe bomb. You sent me one luv phaser blast from across the dance floor
that almost knocked me off my feet!

Music: I didn't get there until 1:30, so i missed the early sets.
The one set that really stood out from the pack for me was Josh's, 
who finished up the techno room; wow, b4 this I had only heard him 
spin house. Jeno and Markie didn't quite hold me in their grip
like they usually do, but I think part of that was my preferance
for the punchier Wicked sound system (and better vibe) in the
techno room.  So everytime one of my favorite DJ's would play a song I 
didn't care for (like that lame-o Eurythmics "Sweet Dreams" of Jeno's)
I'd find myself wondering what was going on next door.  But every DJ
I heard that night moved me, and by the end I was exhasted.  Sorry to 
have missed Terry Mullen though  Jungle bass on the Wicked system must 
have been awesome.

Money: I saw this as a $20 party where you were penalized $5 if you
couldn't find a toy to give.  It was a top quality party in every
respect, really two parties for the price of one.  If our scene is
going to survive and remain a positive communal force, we need big
parties that can bring some of the underground vibe to a larger
'house'.  I *hope* Martin made money.  This issue came up a while back
on this list over one of his Freedom parties.  Martin came onto SFRaves
and gave us a complete financial breakdown.  The bottom line is that
he ain't getting rich doing this.  Not that I would really care all
that much.  Not many people could do what he has done.  Thanks Martin,
and to everyone who was there to make it happen!

	I'd rather include it, because the definition of "profit" is
money made after you account for expensies, and time *is* an
expense. If we're looking things from a "is martin a money-grubbing
ass" point of view, this should be accounted for.

Doubtful I bet the total profit was between 10 and 40 
(but this is TOTAL speculation).

Not bad, I'm sure he can use this to fuel the clothing company
just like some people use their rediculous consulting fees:) to fuel
their ISP companies that are loosing money because they give

This is such a great point.  I never really thought of it that way.  The
lift ticket thing really got me.  Thanks for the insight.

If talking to a person that saw the portfolio is "the grapevine" then I 
guess it was the grapevine. It wasn't passed through fifteen different 
people.

You know Geoff, this is diverting from the original issue. Although I

And yes I have been in the business of throwing parties/events  to make a 
living. But what does this have to do with anything?

Last year the party was $20, now it's $25. Guess no money was made last 
year, or the year before, or the year before that, to necessitate the  
additional cost.

Actually I believe we were talking about perceptions, at least I was. The 
"facts" used to base these perceptions were the ones I have available to 
me. Bring some facts to the table Geoff, tell me why I am wrong. As I 
have said before I don't automatically wish to believe that someone is an 
ass. So if I am wrong give me some FACTS rather than attempting to make 
me justify myself as a person to you. 

You are right on about the participants making the party. It is just a 
shame that a promoter choose to price an event so the participants are 
not a truly representitive of all the beautiful people out there, but 
just those with plenty-o-cash.

All good questions. Show me someone who is trying to do the "right thing" 
for the "right reasons." If Martin is that person, tell me why.

Firstly and foremostly- respect to the Santa Cruz and Sacramento
possies for taking the time to understand my accent.
 ;=)

This was my first time this side of the pond, and for sure not the
last. Sounds were great, but couldn't quite get in to the house room.

People were excellent,well sound. Approachable friendly and having a
whooping great time, I was starting to think this area had NO NIGHTLIFE
(I live on the peninsula), Gathering people- you restored my faith in
this place.

 As someone pointed out earlier Euro all nighters are expensive
($45-$60+) depending on the names and having anything up to 10,000+
people (Do that math then !).

The point of this is if you think $25 is too much, then don't go! but
dont end up wondering next year why there is no more all nighters like
Sat. A good scene costs, but it needn't be outrageously priced.

I appreciate that some people (normally students) dont have money so
bring in discounted prices for students- it is pretty normal every
where else.

Keep on Smiling ;=)

     Sent a message to a mutual friend of Martin and myself to see if 
     Martin could read the posts re:  the Gathering (before Geoff mentioned 
     that he's working on it).  Thought you might be interested in what he 
     had to say.  I removed his name since I haven't gotten permission yet 
     to post this and I don't want him flamed.
     
     One other comment I think we should keep in mind is that no one really 
     needs to justify their actions.  We should really just _*accept*_ 
     people for who they are, after all, we don't really know where they're 
     coming from.  So unfortunately, calling people names and asking for 
     proof of anything is just plain flame-baiting to me.
     
     Hope you all have a wonderful evening.
     
     Love,

     Diane,
     ...(personal stuff deleted)
     re: Martin, I'll pass this info on to him. [ed.] I helped out a little 
     preparing for the party on Saturday. Let me pass on some thoughts:
     
     1) Very few people would've had the sheer chutzpah to put on a party 
     of this size at this location. It could've been a financial disaster, 
     particularly with the weather we've seen recently. In April 1994 
     Martin had an outdoor party in Livermore which had a very high-level 
     of investment and organizing, but it pulled a very meagre crowd. How 
     many SFRavers were sympathetic to his situation then ?
     
     2) He was trying to get that space for the last 2 months. Countless 
     meetings with the property owners, City Manager, Police Department, 
     Fire Department, and much handholding was required before it worked 
     out. Business license, insurance etc. also had to be purchased, and 
     all of this had to be paid for up-front, before the event.
     
     3) The high police presence was mandated by the Oakland Police 
     department, and it was _very_ expensive. That's why there were lots of 
     cops there. But they were involved with this party from the beginning 
     and felt it was being run professionally. I would wager that Martin 
     will be able to throw another party in Oakland, because he has the 
     respect of the City Manager, Fire Department and Police Department. 
     Now, I wonder if the same could be said of the people behind Cool World 
     ?
     
     4) While I was helping out at the space on Saturday, the catch-phrase 
     for the production crew was "Safety First". Nothing was left to 
     chance. _No-one_ was allowed to take a risk that would compromise 
     crowd safety or could allow a vigilant fire marshall to shut the party 
     down. Any rules mandated by the Fire Department and Police Department 
     were followed to the letter. For instance, the sound could've been 
     better in the techno room if the speaker stacks had been positioned 
     differently. But the Fire Department guidelines were that the stacks 
     were to be placed such and such apart, with little room for partygoers 
     to get behind the stacks. Those conditions were met. Security guards 
     were posted at those locations to make sure no-one got in there. 
     Another example, the vertical poles which crossed the floor in the 
     House room had to be marked out or illuminated in some way to a height 
     of 10 feet. They were, without exception. Another example: Smoking was 
     not allowed inside the location, and was allowed only outside in 
     certain areas. Lyons security enforced this patiently and courteously. 
     Another example: The Police Department said : No Alcohol. So everyone 
     was searched, and no-one, including DJ's (from one of whom it was 
     confiscated) was allowed to bring alcohol into the space.
     
     5) I picked up the lights from the rental agency in SF and while 
     there, I asked what other business this lighting company did. The guy 
     who was working there and helping me said "We do mostly corporate 
     events. We used to do a lot more raves, but not any more. Very few 
     parties still put the level of production into their events that 
     Martin does".
     
     6) Anyone I spoke to on Saturday night, including the Police 
     department, were very pleased with the party. $25 is a lot of money, 
     but a) the party was very well-organized to a high professional 
     standard. b) it did not get busted because nothing was left to chance. 
     Would SFRavers rather go to a party that cost $15 but the organizers 
     are so foolish or knavish or disorganized that they don't even pay for 
     the right permits ? Or allow the Fire department to shut them down 
     because they block fire exits and don't have assured firelanes through 
     the parking lot ?
     
     7) Martin is currently setting up a web-site, through v-site.net. As 
     of last week, his e-mail address is martin@choice.communion.com. I'm 
     sure he would welcome constructive comments, because he believes that 
     only by being professional and guaranteeing people a good, bust-free 
     time will this scene prosper. And if anyone has suggestions as to how 
     to make the experience more fun or safer, I'm sure he'd be glad to 
     hear.
     
     Lastly, I left the party at 5am (v. tired). I heard before I left (but 
     haven't confirmed) that bottled water had run out. I believe that 
     there was still a water source from mains taps, but we should all be 
     aware of how a constant drain on a mains water source can cause a 
     steep water pressure drop, which can be followed by the mains water 
     supply failing.
     
     So if this did in fact occur.. It is something that just should not happen, 
     period. No excuses are good enough. We all know the risks of 
     heat-exhaustion in the scene. This has happened at his parties in the past 
     when bigger crowds than expected turnout, and I've brought it up more than 
     once with Martin myself. He feels the same as I on this, that organizers 
     have a high-level of responsibility for partygoers in this area. I shall 
     personally endeavor to make sure it will not recur.

HI kids,
     
I'm not going to add to the Gathering price flame wars !!
I thought it was a good event. And YES it did not have the feel of a "Cool 
World", it was a *rave*, just a big one :)
     
The reason for this post is, I think it would be a good idea to have Martin 
subscribe to SFRaves (if he isn't already), he will probably like to hear 
what we have to say, and I know we would really like to hear from him. I 
don't mean fighting off flame attacks, but info about his events, ideas to 
make them better, etc.. I know several promoters and DJ's are here, and 
make very good use of this medium.
     
Just my .03 (.02 if you email a toy :) )
     
Vince
     
     PS: I'll check the Communion Web page for an e-mail address, and 
     sugest it to him. If someone here knows Martin, maybe you could 
     mention it to him.

Hello all of you out there in e-mail land! Boy, I just finished 
finals...unfortunatly I couldnt make the gathereing...but I am really 
glad to hear that so many people had a great time. I have been reading 
all of the posts regarding the $25 dollar price on the party, i just 
wanted to throw out my 2 cents here, and a few neat ideas to play with 
and maybe we can build a stronger family foundation. Because the more we 
take care of eachother...the stronger our foundation and solidarity 
becomes, then when the  media/money/superstar dj  ->evil trys to 
break into what we have going here we will be able to get through.
	enough with my philosophical drive...
	
	Yes, i think that $25 is alot of money to pay for a one night 
party...but then it sounds like it was a great party, and a quality 
party. This is what I think is most important. I dont know firsthand, but 
it sounds like Martin has a reputation for well thought out and quality 
parties. This skill and level of caring is something that can not be 
bought. A sweet ambience and vibe is priceless and must be cultured 
through careful planning and caring. 
	Also, I have  some experience with throwing parties, smaller 
ones, but I have had to deal with insurance policies, city councils, nazi 
neighborhood organizations. It is not fun and it is very frustrating at 
times. Obviously Martins time should be included in the breakdown for the 
party. 

	Not to go over old ground continuously, I would like to throw out 
some suggestions, What bothers me the most is the fact that some people 
may not be able to go because the price is too much. Someone that may be 
the butterfly to cause a vibe storm in the crowd! I would like to 
brainstorm on ways to get around this... The promoter MUST be able to 
make money to live on as well as to invest in the future of the 
scene...but how can this be reconciled with the idea that there are some 
people that may not have enough money to get in...but are just as 
essential to the vibe and community...

	-how about promises to help clean up in return for a discount...
	-how3 about discounts for KICK-ASS costumes!!
	-how about setup crews...if you REALLY want to come to this party 
and cant afford it show up early and help set the party up...even if you 
think thsat they might get in the way givve a wall to paint with glow in 
the dark paints...anything!

	Peace and love in your hearts...and MERRY uhh whoops...
		!!! HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        This was ****MY***** experience at the Gathering, just the facts;

        Got into a SHORT line:
        (12:50AM)

        Entered a building with over 7000 people in it, according to
Martin's security.
        (1:00AM)

        Paid $50.00 for my friend & I.
        (1:01AM)

        Run into 3 separtate groups of friends with in minutes.
        (1:05AM)

        Became totally overwhelmed by the Rock Concert Like Number of People.
        (1:15AM)

        Went outside:
        (1:25AM)

        Decided to leave, after mutally deciding that we did not want to
risk getting              separtated due to the large numbers.
        (1:35AM)

        On the way out I was accidentally elbowed in the groin by two
children running 
        through the crowd. *~ <
        (1:45AM)

        I got up off the ground after making violent retching noises *~  |.
        (1:55AM)

        Was throughly taken care of by my girlfreind on the way back to Kevin's.
        (2:05AM) = >

        So when's Friend's Family, Chryilsis, Frequency 8, FMR, Cyberlab, or
New Moon going to have another party?

Yeah, I agree!  It made me think of it in a new way, also.  Esp. since 
lift-tickets are closer to about $40 on average, $25 is a bargain 
lift-ticket!

It has everything to do with the issue, if you are throwing a party to
make a living and to make a difference, you can't do either if
you don't make some profit. Martin is not driving around in expensive
cars or living in expensive lavish houses.

I'm not privy to all of this knowledge, I know some maybe not more than you

Well there are expenses to cover did you ever think that a new busines
(like a clothing company that promotes organic cotton and hemp fiber
clothes might LOOSE money the first couple of years? If you have a short
fall and you don't make it up from a bank loan you go out of business.

I am not attacking you as a person or forcing you to justify yourself.
I think you should mail to martin and get the facts from him, what I know
he may not want me to tell.

I think you should ask these things of martin, if you feel that
he is charging too much why don't you confront him with it?
I know I would.

I don't know about this party but I do know that people who have contacted
Martin and have offered work trade in the past have not been refused.
I also know that a significant number of people got in for free.

Hey!

Well in spite of the price, I had a GREAT time!!  Everything was 
killer, great space, not so hot & stuff that I couldn't breath, good 
bathroom access, some killer DJs, and the vibe was great!  Everybody 
was in great spirits, very friendly.  More than once I would run into 
somebody I'd never met before, and within seconds my hand would be 
grabbed and I'd be dragged off to the chill-room to hang out with them! 
(hi, you're shawna? I'm so & so!  come hang out with us!) I love 
massive amounts of friendly people (meaning the percentage of friendly 
people compared to the total number of people), it makes all the 
difference in the world to me.  I got to meet lots of sfravers finally 
(& I finally got my laminte!) which was very cool, one of them even 
recognized me from my description (Hi Marty!), I didn't see a single 
fight or "potentially negative" situation.  Ethan was much fun to watch 
dj, he really got me going!  Anybody hear Spun's intro with Cheech & 
Chong?  Fuckin wacky!  That really tripped everybody out who saw what 
it was that was playing! Stayed till 7:30, only missed that very last 
song that was played after the silent moment.  Never really spent too 
much time in one spot for any real length of time, it was a very 
migratory evening all in all.  Liked the chill-room (with the exception 
of the spilled water, & could've used more pillows!) and the exploded 
feather pillow was a cool toy, lots of nifty people to hang out with in 
there.  I've got to remember to bring more stuff to give next time, so 
many people offered me water, candy, fruit, groovy little nifties, etc, 
and I had nothing to give them!  I left my bag of apples & jolly 
ranchers in the car by accident :(   Oh well, I'll make up for it next 
time! 

I'm so glad that an event this huge was pulled off so successfully, 
thank you to all the people who worked so hard & for so long to make 
the incredible show happen, and thank you to all the wonderful people 
who showed up & made the incredible vibe happen!

Love 
shawna

Dear Black Adder,

	I like Martin, and I've enjoyed the Gatherings I've been to, 
although unfortunately I wasn't at this one. 
	Sometimes I think you're too cynical.  But not this time.  I 
think you're right to ask for an accounting of where the money went.  
Power corrupts, and it's people like you who will hopefully keep the 
promoters in our scene true to the spirit of the rave community. 
	I don't think it's too much to ask how much of the money from a 
party is going to charity, if a party is billed as benefiting charity.  I 
don't even think it's too much to ask for a complete breakdown of 
expenses, specific enough to be verifiable for anyone inclined to check.
	After all, if these are "our" parties collectively, and not just 
the promoters', shouldn't we take all take an interest in the "bottom 
line"?  I think such a move would go some ways toward ending the 
"producer-consumer relationship" that prevents us coming together more 
closely as a community, and so I join with Black Adder and others in 
asking all promoters who care about the scene to show that you trust and 
respect us, and open your books.

A couple of thoughts about the Gathering:  GOOD and bad.  

The GOOD:  The music that entered my ears that night was VERY GOOD to 
EXCELLENT.  The highlight for me was a 45-minute stretch of Doran's set 
that really lifted people off their feet (i had spent the previous time 
pleasantly rocking out to Spun's funky breaks).  Please, let's get him 
out here more often.  I spent most of my time in the harder room, which 
I found to have a somewhat older crowd and a somewhat tighter vibe (there 
is a correlation here, but not one of direct causality).  Well, soon after 
Doran's set, I got _elevated and then lost my objectivity, which was fine 
with me ;).  Surpisingly good vibe at this party.  

The Bad:  Ok, you can kinda come to expect a lot of random acts at a 
party that brings together so many random people.  If things go right, 
these random acts will be ones of kindness and good will.  Unfortunately,
there are other types of random acts.  Although I don't believe in kharma,
I hope that all those people who were cutting in line will have to go to 
the DMV sometime soon and have to wait really long, and then get bumped to
the end of the line for some random reason ;).  I do what I can to hold
these selfish people accountable by looking at them in the eyes -- 
unfortunately, I don't have 100 eyes.  Actually, I could have used an extra
pair of eyes to keep my eyes on my backpack as well as that of a friend.  
They were stolen midway into the night, but we are both strong enough (and, 
perhaps, jaded enough) to just forget about it, and go on having a good 
time.  Yeah, I took my chances by not checking it in, but as many of you 
know, there are things in backbacks that we ocassionally need to call upon, 
toke upon, eat, drink, and keep you warm outside.

So in closing, if there were any trippers out there who were so high that 
they accidentily walked off with a black Trager and a black Jansport 
backpack thinking that they were magical turtle shells capable of turning 
one into a ninja turtle... yeah, right ;).

Stay positive - Rok.

        That was probably Niacin, which is also white and can come in a
pill, it causes your capillaries to rise to the surface of your skin
(blushing sort of look) and you get really hot and somewhat itchy. Believe
it or not, some ppl like to take it WITH e. (!) To each their own i guess
:)
        and yeah, i totally think that what comes around goes around ;)

	try tincture of valeiran root.
	pleasant, wholesome effects.
	legal (and safe) at your local natural foods store.
	take the dosage reccomended and you will feel similar
	effects to valerian.  "valium" is a word dervied from
	valerian, it is the synthetic form of the active
	ingredients of valerian.

	valerian is to valium
		   as
	shrooms are to acid

	or soemthing like that.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        First, a excerpt & reprint from the holiday issue of XLR8R on MDMA-3:

       " MDMA-3(4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine)

                Commonly known as "Ecstasy", the ***psychedelic**, known for
the way it dissolves the boundaries between people, needs no introduction in
the rave world. Legal since 1985, MDMA was tried by millions either on the
advice of psychologists or by enthusiastic partiers in Texas(God Bless Their
Little Souls) & elsewhere who discovered it to be a safe & legal alternative
to alcohol & cocaine."

        ?, I feel kinda uninformed I never knew MDMA was in the drug class
of the psychedelics, nor that it was legal until 1985, dat sucks. ?, or is
this a misprint.
Clarity from other factual verifiable sources would be appreciated, thanks.

        Ok, & next, hypothetically speaking, lets talk about the price of
MDMA, which I hear through the grape vine is going at the rate of $20/each
for those little 100mg powdered caps. Also, I hear that the powder in those
caps costs anywhere from $1600/oz to $3000/oz depending on who ya know, and
how good it is. But most average ravers need at least two for a average
night of fun(C+, B-, lets say to rate or scale them), that's at least
$40/night.  

        So the average dealer nets outta of an .oz about ((28.4 grams in a
.oz / 100mg/cap) * $20.00) = $5680.00. Of course, this person takes a lot of
risk, and in business, the size or amount of your profit should be directly
proportional to the level of risk you take on your initial investment,
right; haven't  lost anyone yet have I. Also, & note we haven' taken into
account those nice dealers that like to walk on their powder with Kitty
Tranquillizers, Speed, or something healthly like Vitumin B if they have a
conscious. Or the ones that sell caps filled with less than 100mg, or more
for than matter.

        Know suppose, & hypothetically speaking, you had a person that had a
superior MDMA product, a product so good the average raver could get off
initially on half a hit, or $10 worth of this MDMA. Were talking
Florida/East Coast MDMA for those of you I'm told are in the know. But this
product at $20/hit didn't have much of a profit magin in quanity, actually
much less than the powder. How would you feel if this person decided to sell
them at $25/hit. Also, & considering the info supplied through the grape
vine, that I hear in New York, good MDMA goes for $40/hit, Philadelphia $30
- $40/hit, Gainesville, FL. $30/hit.

        You would proablly thing that this person was a total scum bag, even
though the MDMA was better than anything you've ever had. So the ? I'm tring
to get answered is how much profit is appropreiate for a given amount of risk?

        Ok, and a slight change in topic. First, I would like to say I know
Martin of Communion personally, like him a lot, have worked for him as a
massage therapist, think & know what a HARD WORKING person he is. Would
proabily do anything for him that he asked me to, within reason. Because I
see an honest representation of who and what he is about. I prasied Vision,
a kick ass party at the Sound Factory for $11.00 if you got there early, and
was worth $20, I think even if you got there after 11PM. Some nameless
people, if you remember, complained about the price of admission to Vision,
which as a party, gave you more by far, than the Gathering, yet these same
nameless people praised the Gathering, please explain this sudden change of
heart.

        So you have a party for $25.00, it's very if not too expensive, this
I agree on,  this is why I'm asking this ?, and comparing to different forms
of bussiness, and comparing the actual response of people who attended a $25
party, to the projected responses to a hypothetical local increase in the
price of MDMA, a long with an increase in overall total quality of the MDMA.

        So I would be interested in hearing your links and responses to this
hypothetical situation, please do tell.

I bought four capsules of that stuff for my friend and I, and when it
started to kick in I felt like my head was right under a heat lamp. First
in my head, then it spread down to my arms, then my legs. My skin flet
splotchy or prickly like goosebumps but I was *burning up*! Then I felt
like I was going to pass out, so I sat down for a few minutes. It scared
the hell out of me! I splashed water on my face to try to cool myself down
and it all went away. Elapsed time was 15 minutes to 30 minutes in all.

I have E quite a few times, but nothing has ever made me feel like that did
and nothing ever came on in a way that I thought I would pass out. Ever.

So I went back to the guy selling it and told him it was shit. He denied
anyone else had complained, but I got him to buy back the other two hits we
didn't take. I should have told him to give us back the rest of the $$$
too, but I was still kinda shaken and didn't think of it at the time.

The only reason that I even bought from him at all was that I had seen him
selling at Wicked party at King Street earlier this month. While I was
standing next to him by the stairs on the right side of the room, he
actually got shaken down by the security but he 'palmed' the drugs from his
front pocket and put it in his back pocket after they searched there and
when they looked in his front pockets all they found were gobs and gobs of
$20 bills. They were really mad that they couldn't find any of his drugs
and We talked a little about it and we were both quite amused by the whole
thing.

Next time I see him I am going to tell him to give me back the rest of the
$$$ we spent on his crap.

I thought that the Gathering was an amazing party.  The security was 
cool, the cops were even decent.  The space was *huge*.  The people were 
nice, had a lot of people come up and talk to me without me talking to 
them first.  The music was slamming, those walls of speakers were 
ridiculous.  The energy and the vibe was so right on, even with a very 
large, very diverse group of people.  I just kept thinking that this 
could never happen (on this scale) in L.A.(where I moved here from:().  
At one point my boyfriend and I were trying to figure out(from the price 
and the amount of people there) how much the party was raking in.  We 
came to a pretty large sum and said GOOD, they deserve it.  The Gathering 
was worth saving up for. This is all IMHO.

*Cheers*  Looking forward to the next happening that even comes close to 
the Gathering,

Cami

I have a problem with this. This was a for-profit venture. The only talk of
charity was the toys donation, nothing was ever mentioned of money being
donated. What we did know was that it would be a massive, it had an
all-star lineup, and as far as massives go, The Gathering is different in
that it is all above-board and there was a way higher chance of this party
having a much, much better vibe that most of us find as massives. And it
was true, this party was unlike any large party I have ever gone to. There
was a vibe there that I have never found at a party that size. That
definitely differentiates it from any other $20/$25 party of any size that
I have gone to in recent memory.

If I put the tens of thousands of dollars on the line for this party, I
would hope and expect to make a good profit off of it. I am an
entreprenuer, so I understand the concept of risks and rewards relating to
business ventures. This was a business venture. Martin (and his company)
deserve to be potentially (and actually) rewarded for risking their $$$ to
put this party on. Martin was not the only person to profit from the party.
Other people working this party were paid for their time (lights, lasers,
sound, DJs, etc.) yet I don't hear their name being taken in vain. It seems
the only 'evil' that ever gets talked about in our scene (and yes, I have
done it before too, but lately I have been trying to walk a mile in the
shoes of those I used to critisize, and it's changing my attitude
immensely) are the promoters, but when it comes to a party, large or small,
money losing or incredibly profitable, everybody has their hand out for
$$$, and the promoter is the one paying everybody for everything.

I will not critisize a party in the future re: $$$ as long as the party is
delivered as expected and that the paying party-goers got a good value for
their $$$. Of course, this is a lot different than a story where people
drop their $20 and don't get anything for it (i.e. a 100% party-stopper
like the Kundalini bust last month that forced everybody out in the street
at 1:30am).

The Gathering cost $20 + toy or $25, but everybody that I talked to that
dropped their cash + toy or cash felt like they got what they paid for.

This leads me to believe that Martin and company deserve whatever $$$ they
took home after the bills were paid. Yes it was capitalistic, but damn, he
also delivered the goods!

YEAH!!!!!! :) :) :)
I'm sitting here in Nevada kicking at the computer table, just wishin' 
that I could have been there, only to read these gripey why-so-much reviews.
I would gladly have paid *way* more than that, and would have if you 
include gas, lodging, etc. 

SF has the best vibe (aside from Burning Man ;) and you guys don't even 
appreciate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In the words of Richard Bach... "Anyone you want to keep in your life, 
*never* take them for granted."

We did that in Reno, and now we have a party about every two or three months.

If you take our scene for granted, it *will* DISAPPEAR.

This was my first rave in about 3 years and boy, what an event to get back
in to it!!  I really felt the "pull" to get me to the place and even a
newbie like me could feel the good vibes comin outta that place.  I think
part of it was cuz I went up with my friend Shin, who seemed to know a lot
of people out there and introduced me to them.  I guess he was deep into
raving for a while.  Also, people were just so friendly-not something I
remember about LA Raves. (what's up to the girl with the tube of lotion!!)
(?!?!?)

Actually, to me $25 isn't too outta line cuz the raves I'd been to in SoCal
often charged $15-20 for a crappy venue and little to no security.  I mean
there were lots of fights and too many people goin nuts on some drug that
it got to be a kinda scary thing and the that cool vibe died, at least for
me.  If other SF raves were like this one, I'd pay this much again if it
meant having this much fun and meeting this many cool new friends.  I do
wish I would've found some SFRavers though!!

Again, I gotta give it up to this Martin.  Hope we meet at one of your
future events! And see you all at the next one.

Terry here.
I have to agree re: Mullen.  I've never heard him spin before, but I 
spent my few non-dancing moments of the evening watching him work.
A-maz-ing!  Then again, almost every set I heard in the techno room blew 
my fucking mind. :)

BRIAN:

Actually I believe MDMA is classified under the methampetamine category...

As for the illegalization of it.  I thought it was common knowlage that MDMA
was legal till 1985...

And as for hits associated with costs... Well it all depends on how much one
wants to cut his supply with shit to make a profit....

I know this issue is getting stretched out, but two things:

Could everyone PLEASE refrain from re-quoting entire posts when you reply?
There is *no need for it*.  Yes, it is easy to do with some mail programs.
I am going to say this straight out: it is impolite and annoying and
causes me not to value the response as highly as I might.  'Nuff said.

Second, this to Black Adder.  If you're so sure Martin and his team made
off with buckets of gold from the Gathering, why don't you propose a
quick budget to show how that is the case?  Space, security, permits,
advertising, DJs, sound, lights, porta-potties, etc.  Add it up and
tell me what you think.

Then let's see if it's close to reality.  Martin has previously posted
some info about his budgets, if I recall correctly, which to me is just
amazing.  This is like your local corner market or music store or
restaurant putting their financials in the window.  There are good 
reasons not to do so.

Nevertheless, the broad outlines of the cost structure for a party of
this size can be guessed.  I think many people would be surprised a
t the cost of three items in particular: space, security and advertising.
Each one can easily amount to $5,000 or more just for a one-off event.
At even $25 a head, that represents 200 people in the door paying full
rate just to pay each of those costs (I don't know the specifics of
this particular Gathering, but I bet I'm not far off).  There are lots
more costs, and you have crew and yourself to repay as well.  Assuming
100 to 200 hours of work to pull off a party (including the schmooze
time you have to put in to spread the word), even if you pay yourself
diddly that starts to add up.  In the meantime your rent has to be
paid, gas for the car or bus fare, the phone (yow!) and advance payments
or deposits for much of the party's needs, all before much if any money
comes in.

Lonnie has talked some about the general costs of putting on his larger
parties in Baltimore on dc-raves and ne-raves.  $30 to $40K is not an
absurd amount at all for a 2000 person event.  It's only because nearly
everything except the space is donated that we can do F&F for $5.
With these kinds of numbers, the margin between making some and losing
a lot -- let's say 1800 vs. 2500 admissions -- is not all that great,
and any number of factors can head you down the tubes financially,
including weather, other events, the phase of the moon, etc.  Of coursem,
when you pack the joint you can make some serious dough, as the Cool
World approach shows.  I'll have more to say about that in my next missive.

Anyway, take it from a (retired) Concert Executive: it's just as much a
gamble as the derivatives market :-)

Ok,  This is silly....


Why on earth do you think we call these big-type parties Massives???

Cos they're huge, big, large....
Yeah, so money was made.  Ok, but did you have a good time?  I did. Allthough
I'll only do Massives once or twice a year (mainly to keep from going poor,
and the loss of intimacy from the smaller venues)...

There are Underground ravers, Reneagade ravers, Klub kids, Bubblegum ravers
(love that term Larry),  Massive Ravers.  So who cares, I pay money to see
movies, buy records, CD's ect.. I support my community.  Hell, I even pay
money to events that I can get in for free.  Why, because firstly, I always
believed (and still do) that the best high is to help out your scene, your
community.  I help out who I can and have as much fun as I can as well...
I even bought a $10 toy just for the Gathering.  So am I a fool? Some will
say Yes. Some will say hell yea...  But in my heart I did a service and it is
that feeling that makes me sleep well at night.

Oh well, make of this what you will... Calculate your costs and revinues to
the prices associated with throwing this paticular rave... Just remind me to
sign off for a week after Cool World on New Years....

I assume none of the people complaining about the cost of the Gathering 
and where the money went to would ever pay $15-$20 to some E dealer. What 
have dealers done for the scene other than rip massive amounts of people off 
selling harmfull chemicals? I don't see anyone flaming dealers. I don't 
think I've ever been to an event that had that much money put into it. I 
had a great time & would gladly give Martin $25 for another like it (if 
he got Doc to use his masterfull skills mixing GOOD records :)

Um, in case it hasn't been obvious, I'd like to point out that the
reviews here have been at least 10 to one in praise of the Gathering.
This tendancy to label SFRavers as a bunch of whiners is way off the
mark.  Over the years, the people on this list have been some of the
biggest supporters and contributers to the SF scene.  There will always
be some who look for the negative, and this isn't always bad either.

Anyway, since it is public record, and Martin isn't here to defend
himself, I thought this 1.5 year old post from him might be of some
interest.  Please bear in mind that things may have changed since then
and that there were a lot of logistical differences between last
weekend's Gathering, and the 1994 July 4th Freedom Party.

Hi all,

Thank you Ethan for pulling the needed response from me and for
your kind and inspiring words.  It is nice to communicate with 900? people
@ 0nce and hear your comments, criticisims etc.  Most of you seemed to
enjoy Freedom as did most of the people not on the net. That makes me happy
to say the least.  Still i have heard that it was to far to travel from
some people.  One thing i believe is we have to learn to travel great
distances. Not only in the way of miles to a party or festival as the House
Movement ( your comments taken into consideration ethan ) expands within
america, but also in the distance we have to travel into the depths of
depths of our inner selves.  This is nessacary to in order to love and
accept ourselves first, the world will follow in due course.  This is
something i struggle with on a daily basis, somedays a lot, some a little. 

I have put parties on for three years now, i have done them for
lots of different reasons over the years.....  For the love and happiness
that is created at them; for the boost to my ego; to satisfy my drive to be
the best at whatever i do; to create an enviornment where people are more
suseptable to achieve a higher state of consciousness; to bring people
together; for the money that can sometimes be made:  These are just some of
the reasons, but for the most part as i sit here now, reflecting, the main
reasons.  I think you would agree there are both good and bad reasons in
there.  You see, i am just a human being, i am no better or worse than any
of you.  I am just doing the best i can to make sense of whats going on
around me.  I see right, i see wrong, i see change.

The Gathering was worth the money....I walked around and saw all the work 
that had gone into decorating, and there was a really good vibe, and best 
of all the music was incredible.  The Dedication room took me hostige and 
I couldn't come out all night - I even missed Tony's set, which is a 
first for me.  Ethan, Doran, and Jon Williams' sets stand out in my mind.
I had heard about water running out, but I guess I was lucky.  Every time 
I needed a refill, it was available.

All these flame wars don't mean much to me - I had fun and got my money's 
worth.  End. Finis. Martin needs a large sum of money to even get 
something of that magnitude off the ground, so it's not like the profits 
are being "wasted".  Most of it probably goes into the next party.  Kudos 
to Martin and the rest who put it on.  :)

love,
Amy

I didn't go, and the whole time have been merely voicing my opinion that 
$25 is too much for a party without some justification(flying in Euro's, 
etc...) There are so many others out there putting on reasonably priced 
parties, that I can and have done without parties like Sat.

Hope to see some of you there.

Peace,
John

To reiterate, why is it important for me to have been in the biz in order 
to make an observation? Anyone capable of third grade math could reach an 
opinion on the amount of cash made. Unfortunately we don't have exact 
figures on all the costs. But 7000+ at $20-$25 seems like an awful lot.

Geoff, this is the first really constructive statement I have seen from you.
Thanks, really.... I will do just that. And I will be happy to pass on 
the response to the world at large.

You're right, I am too cynical some times. We all have our crosses to bear.
Thank you for defining my point of view and desire, in a much less 
confrontational manner.

Hi out there-

	Indeed, the gathering rocked.   Many thanks to Martin, his whole 
crew and everyone who was there who was smiling.

	Nothing could spoil a night that was so beautiful, although the 
loss (theft?) of my backpack and my jacket AS WELL AS my friend's 
backpack and jacket put a momentary frown or two on my face.  Please, 
please if anyone knows the whereabouts of a black trager pack, a blue 
northface pack, a beige carhart jacket, or a black flight jacket, contact me.

	Good will is always returned....

thanks

dave

MAD.... A tasty little groove last night.

The venue is a bar/catina which was a nice size for the number of people 
that showed up (50-75.) Free water. Nice crowd. The sound system was a 
little overdriven. But oh what it was driving.... NICE NICE change of 
pace. Music was great. Electro and some Detroit? stuff from Jon Santos, 
and some nice techno courtesy of Joe Rice(forgive if I am not up on my 
styles.) Not at all what I was expecting... Good stuff guys.... Well 
worth the $1 cover over and over.

        Yep, that's niacin! No mistaking that :( Last new years this girl
came up to me and offered a 'vitamin' randomly to me. Now, you can take
things one of two ways: paranoia or pronoia. So, thinking that raves were a
place where one COULD take candy from strangers i took half of it and had
the same reaction. Later i went up to her and politely told her what it was
and that it potentially could ruin someone's night, so make sure to keep
that in mind! THere are a lot of strange people out there who have their
own ideas about 'contributing to the vibe' some of which i just don't get.
Now, if someone is SELLING this stuff, especially as something that it's
not, then i have a problem with that.
        I think that this type of thing is perpetuted by people who 'just
don't get it' about raves. THey bring their ideas of capitalist exchange
and all that in from 'the real world' thinking that it's applicable. Now,
we do live within a capitalist society but, hopefully, profit motivation
and the value of money in general is going to be seen as a really
unimportant compared to a larger understanding about happiness and power
and how we all relate. I still don't  understand it when i hear about E
dealers fighting for territory, or selling shit for profit. I mean, have
they DONE the stuff (not to imply that i HAVE ;).
        well for those who 'get it' be happy, and realize that it's your
obligation to politely inform others about your realizations in the most
empathetic and pursuasive way.
        To jump topics for a bit, a friend of mine just mailed me a copy of
the "Feel" zine that, coincidentally, Martin O'Brien is partially
responsible for and, well, i dunno how you could go all out and dis someone
who is involved with something as cool and positive as this. I mean, like
Dianne said, we're all human but this zine is definitely not the product of
greed in my eyes :)
        peace,
                brad

(800) 388 3300 - to order

long sleeve heavy duty twill coveralls are item #316 and cost $37.99
(i dunno if this is expensive, but i was getting it as a gift, and this 
was the only place i found that had them)
short sleeve coveralls are item #1305, and i don't know how much they cost

for an extra $3.95 the can put yer name on it in either script or block

My apologies for this; alex is in London for a bit leaving us short a crew
member which kept me at the door most of the night instead of in the sweet
spot tweeking sound which, believe me, is definitely where I'd rather be =)


Also, please note:

  THERE WILL BE NO MAD NEXT MONDAY THE 25TH !!!!

We return on Janaury 1, 1996 with:

  Joe Rice, Ethan, and Dutch

Should be good for a little trance eh?

Thanks again for supporting MAD, we really appreciate it!

I don't see you can say "... Vision, which as a party, gave you more by
far, than the Gathering..." That is just rediculous. There was no
comparison at all.  Vision was a decent party, but raves like the
Gathering just don't come around that often, period.  $25 IS alot of
money, and normally I would never pay that, but as most everyone I've seen
post seems to agree, it was money *very* well spent.

Life, and all that it has to offer can sometimes be overwhelming.  The
deluge of information, events, experiences, desires and needs can sometimes
lead one to withdraw, to be reactionary instead of responsive.  In an
overwhelmed state, we find it easier to lash out than to reach out.
Sometimes seeming to define one's world through the filters of criticism
and cynicism (for one's self as well as others) instead encouragement and
praise (again, for one's self as well as others).   And through this flood,
it is sometimes forgotten that we, within ourselves have the power and
means to transcend the deluge, to shape our own world, to be able to
channel that unrelenting force into constructive avenues that can nurture
the world around us instead of destroy it.  Little do we realize that at
times, the first to bear the brunt of the destructive energy that we
sometimes harness, are our own souls.

It is through dance that I have found transcendance.  Music has taught me
how to fly using wings I never knew I had. Lifting me above the seemingly
relentless tides of time and change.  It is through music and dance that my
soul is free to soar amongst the heavens and inner dimensions, allowing a
clearer view into the nature of the world that I am creating around me
(allowing a clearer view of us). It is there that I am able to discern the
path to consciousness, that seemingly elusive inner light which is often
dimmed by the trials we face on a daily basis.  For now, the light is there
for me, the path illuminated.  I shall follow it again.

We stand at the threshold of a new era.  A new range of dimensions and
possibilities.  I invite you all to take my hand and join me as we move
forward to dance brothers and sisters, dance.

Peace, Love and Happy Holidays to you all!

Love

Tigger

        It would have been nice if someone had actually answered the
question. So let me put it out to our bussiness people on the list.

        Are there any ethical business guildlines that suggest what an
appropreiate profit margin would be for a given level of risk?

        If so, what are they?

Thank you all once again for the wonderful messages of love and support you
sent for my friend Alex.  Some of you asked to be informed of how he is
doing, so here goes.  He pulled through the surgery ok, but while in it, his
lung collapsed.  He has recovered from the surgery and the collaps fairly
well.  I went and visited him yesterday, and although he is weak, he may be
allowed to return home on Wednesday :) :)  I brought some bongo drums, my
didjerido, and a Tibetan bowl to the hospital and we struck up a little jam
session.  (he's a drummer)  It was incredibly beautiful to see him playing
the drums again.  He played very simply and lighly for about ten minutes,
and almost everyone in the room joined in by tapping thier feet or knocking
out a rhythm on the arms of the chairs.  He looked more at peace during that
session than he's been since he entered the hospial.  It was a very
spiritual experience.  I also gave him copies of all of your posts so he can
read them himself.  He is really grateful to all of you, and so am I.  Thank
you once again for your time and energy.

Love,

Rick

After reading the posts about the Gathering, and pondering some of the
questionable behavior i.e. in ecto's post:

And about backpacks and jackets getting stolen. I think that I'd have to
agree. These people just don't get it. I think the difficult thing is that
ravers want to keep an open venue.... accept and love each other regardless
of race, creed, or religion. So what CAN we do about it? Keeping out the
'undesireables' is out of the ravers' creed of unconditional acceptance, is
it not?

I'd like to, if I may, take a different approach to these dealings. Having
a place where you can go and not have to worry about your possessions, your
body, your emotions, or being judged, or cheated is extremely idealistic. I
believe that a good rave with the right people and the proper vibe comes as
close to this type of an atmosphere as one can hope to find. I do however,
believe that humanity has quite a long way to go before this type of
atomsphere could be unequivocally achieved.

Wonderfully idealistic?      Yes...

Something to strive for?     Definitely...

Realistic?     Sadly...      No...

I would like to share a little something that I learned from an excellent
book written by Dan Millman.

The book is entitled "Way of the Peaceful Warrior," and it is about how a
very wise man, Socrates, opens Dan Millman's eyes to his very 'foolish'
ways of living. The term itself - Peaceful Warrior is paradoxical. Here we
have one side who wants, harmony, love, joy, happiess, acceptance.... and
another side with the will to battle, to defend, and to conquer. Put these
two opposites together, and you have a living paradox.... a warrior who
fights for peace.

It is not enough that a person has the right intentions... it is not enough
that he is loving, wants to make a difference and do the right thing. He
must also carry the warrior instinct to voice and to enforce his ideals. Do
you want an atmosphere of safety? Fight for it!

Fight the bogus 'e' dealers ;(. If you like to e, find a trusted,
guaranteed source. Pre-buy your e and take it to the rave with you.

Fight theft ;(. You SHOULDN'T have to do this, I agree. But it is a reality
that you NEED to do this... from now on at least 1 person keep an eye on
everyone's belongings. Alternate dancing if you need to. You can even stay
close to the person watching the stuff. Think of creative ways to keep it
in tact. You'd have to do this anywhere else. It's not real cool that you
have to do this at a rave, but I wouldn't want to lose $200.00 worth of my
stuff because of the way I WANTED something to be, in respect to the way
things really were.

That is all for now.

Take care.

Love,

Sean

P.S. Had a blast at the Gathering. Hope I get to meet some of you at the
next                                                 party ! :)

With all of the great, cheap weeklies we have going on in this town, we
almost don't need raves anymore! While I always enjoy MaD (when I can make
it :( ), last night's was particularly great. I got there just in time to
hear Jeff Taylor kicking off his set (unfortunately meaning that I missed
Jon's no doubt excellent set) and might as well have been nailed to the
dancefloor for the next hour or so. _Excellent_ tune selection on his part,
and the kind of tunes I almost never hear in San Francisco (I particularly
dug the Spiral Tribe tune he put down). After Jeff finished, Joe got up and
put down some more than decent tracks (including one of two songs by Speedy
J that I actually like!) and generally put on an inspired performance. Well
wicked.

I also appreciated the opportunity to hang out with various folks and
chat. MaD is always such a friendly, social affair, and it was cool to talk
to Wayne, Vince, Jon Drukman, Jon Santos (and his bewildering panoply of
multimedia geek friends), Fixer, and Jeff Taylor (and to loan Brian D my pen
:). All in all, it was a wonderful way to kick off the week, and I look
forward to MaD's return in the new year!

	I think the basic idea is that over time, between wins and losses, you 
end up with a reward commensurate with your talent and labor.  There are 
economic systems that say otherwise but this is my opinion.  The fact is that 
the promoter has to be motivated or he/she won't take the risk.

	Isn't this a bit obvious?  Hasn't Martin lost money in the past?  Only 
one person mentioned that (something outdoors, bad weather?), and it didn't seem 
to have much effect on the flamefest...  I know that when many promoters start 
out, before they know the ropes well, they lose lots... sort of an initiation 
fee...  Now what I consider unscrupulous is when somebody cons someone else into 
taking the risk, and keeps the reward themselves...

Uh huh.  What you really mean is, "This one sample of something
someone told me was White Light was supposedly analyzed by someone
with something resembling what was once an actual laboratory, and
it had roughly these sorts of things in it."  Ignoring the fact that
it's hard to extract amounts of multiple organic compounds like that,
let alone get percentage quantities. Also ignoring the fact that
if someone else comes along and says "Hey, this is White Light!" you
have no way to know if it's what you claim yours was.

Why did you post this info, anyhow, Brian?

And as to your other question, about profit margins:  previous threads
have made it pretty clear that you have a far higher comfort level with
discussing drug dealing on this list than most other people here.
Don't hold your breath waiting for a substantiative thread on this
topic.

        Rob you have no idea what you are talking about, you are not me, you

        So what do you know about chemical analysis, please do tell!!!

        If you read the infomation posted about White Light through the
grape vine, you should know it's different that anything else out there,
both physically in it's appearence, as well as it's make up, & cost's the
same.  By sources are good Rob, this I assure you, no mistakes. But then
again maybe you should go buy some Nician, maybe you prefer that, to the
real thang.

> Why did you post this info, anyhow, Brian?

        I'm tried of my freinds on this list getting ripped off, like Wayne
for example, fuckin Nicin, he could have died, you dumb ass.  I'm tried of
getting ripped off, and I'm not just complaining, I'm doing something about
it hon. Why, what do you do for our scene, huh!!!!

>discussing drug dealing on this list than most other people here.

        I have no idea what your talking about Rob, you accusations are
groudless, and unfactual, and wouldn't hold their weight in a court of law,
something I know quite a bit about. Considering I'm 2 & 0 against lawyers in
front of a California Circuit Judge. How do you know this is Brian Darkness,
who is Brian Darkness, is this him, or just someone using his account, is
this real information, or just lies. You don't your just guessing, don't you
ever accuse me of anything, when your not sure of who, or what. All this
infomation is just FYI, that's all, if you have a problem with it I suggest
you read the UNIX manual and discover what the filter command does. Please
keep you venom to yourself, I have no time for it, and neither does anyone
else on this list.

>Don't hold your breath waiting for a substantiative thread on this

        I won't, because you have nothing to offer but groudless,
meaningless speculation. This is what I get for trying to educate people, &
help them, fuck you Rob!!!

        I was brought up to believe that if you have a problem with another
human being, you talked with them about it face to face; not over the
telephone, not through e-mail. Anything less, is not human communication. I
tired of the uninformed, clueless, and ignorant taking pot shots at me from
afar, you have something negative to say to me, you say it to my face, I'm
very accessable. If you can't, please keep it to yourself, that's it. 

        Excuse me for being human, but I'm more than just a post on your
terminal, please remember that, next time your about to flame me. 

        This is why my numbers are on every sig, call me I would love to
meet you and talk with you, like adults do, when they have problems with one
another.

        If you publiclly flame me, be prepared for me to do the same to you.
An eye for an eye, is unfortuately the only way a lot of us learn what is
exceptable behaviour. If you send be a private post; over a public network;
which is negative, be prepared for me to post it publically. You are now
aware of how I deal with my e-mail, so don't be surprised.

I was wondering where the dj is housed during a radio rave.  Can he/she see
the croud to be able to interact with the vibe.  It would be nice to have
the dj right there with all the people, but he/she would need a monitor, and
if it was kept low enough I guess it wouldn't pose a problem.  The boom
boxes couldn't be used as monitors because of the time lag to send the
signal through the transmitter and what not would screw up the mixes.  Any
thoughts?  

I love the concept of using walkmans for a totally silent party.  Everyone
with nice quality headphones and walkmans groovin in silence.  Couldn't ya
just see a couple a hundred people dancing *legally* in a public park in the
middle of the night, the cops would be pissed. ::::)))))

Let me know if you know how the dj logistics would work.

OK, I can handle that, and respect it.  I'm not against drug information.
I support the hyperreal archives and all like that.  But it gives me
the creeps to be reading about something that's X parts E, Y parts
"synthetic mesc", and Z parts filler.  It sounds, to me, like a
witches' brew, and that provoked my cynical reaction that was at least
partially unwarranted.

>How do you know this is Brian Darkness,
>who is Brian Darkness, is this him, or just someone using his account, is
>this real information, or just lies.

As you rightly point out, I have no idea.  And that's all my post was
saying:  your information, posted openly to this list, is not useful.
I don't know that it's actually you posting it, I don't know anything
about what "white light" looks like or smells like or whether what
you're describing matches what someone else might try to sell me.  
In order for me to believe what your post said about what's in
white light, I have to believe that it really is you, trustworthy Brian
Darkness, who posted that info.  And as you yourself just pointed out, I
DON'T KNOW THAT!

I know you are doing good stuff for our scene, Brian.  But I question
whether  you couldn't have done just as well by saying "I have some hard
data on White Light.  If you want to know more, get in touch with me."
Doing this education over the net is not trustworthy enough, I don't
think.

No insults, just opinions....

just wanted to drop my 2c about the gathering..

- plenty of parking.  though it's close to BART, walking in that
  neighborhood is mighty sketchy (remember whoopi ball?)
- line to enter flowed very quickly.
- great space, killer space!!  incredible space!!!
- the music was outstanding, especially the techno room
- plenty of water... even when they ran out temporarily i found a hose
  outside.
- plenty of bathrooms.  if there was a line you could always
  walk a bit and find an empty one.  also, plenty of privacy
  inside the bathrooms.
- security was OK, saw lots of confiscations, but see above.
- big outdoor area to chill & cool down
- met some sfravers (geoff, amy, crunch) yay!  said yo to ozy.
- even though the testosterone level was mighty high, the vibe overruled.
  didn't see one fight at all.  that is amazing.  lots and lots of
  smiling happy ravers with luv phasers on kill.  i think one of
  the reasons that most of the kids were in the house room is they
  may have felt out of place with so many ravers going off in the other room.
- too many people sitting down in the middle of the floor, though
  not as bad as i've seen at other raves (esp. at all ages events)
- too many piles of personal crap in the middle of the floor.  if you
  don't want your shit ripped off or stepped on, don't leave it on the ground.
  (that's what coat checks are for).
- if they opened up that fence part by the water/juice bar, the traffic
  would have flowed better.

all in all, i had a great time.  i only like to do massives occasionally,
but this was a massive done right.

ps. i was the guy with shoulder length brown hair, black sweatshirt,
black pants, and pupils the size of dimes.  yeah, that guy..

pps. $25 is cheap for 10+ hours of entertainment.

cya next year,

There will be a strike against AOL on the 2nd of January to protest the
pricing structure, and their arrogance. Please do not use AOL on the 2nd of
January, and help make this protest a success. 

AOL is raising the price to access AOL NET to $6.00 an hour not including the
$2.95 an hour you already pay above the five free hours each month.

Dear Rob & All;

        Thanks, I mean that = >. I don't have much patience for Flames or
negative posts. You wouldn't believe the amount of foul, nasty, trash I get
in my mailbox, from people on our list. People wonder why I'm negative &
harse sometimes. I understand I'm a very controversial character, as most
people in history where who tried to make change happen, or bring about
awareness. This position, that I chose to take, often places me in the line
of fire. I'm 33, and still wear my Kevlar Vest, but on the postive side,
it's taught me how to defend myself, and how to get at the truth, & the
factual reality, if I chose to accept them.

        Like I said in other posts, there are days when I approach divinity,
and others when I can't see my hand in front of my face because I'm blinded
by my own darkness(pride, ignorance, arrogance ...etc darkness......)

        I would sincerely like to apologize for my use of profanity, but
your message was like the 4th or 5th one I've had to deal with so far this
week, and it's the holidays ta boot. But nonetheless, sorry = >.

        I think, this includes myself, that we all need to take a deep
breath, maybe two, and give each other a little more tolerance  & acceptance
for our wonderfully unique differences, & beliefs, which by the simple fact
of our exsistance, define our world as one of incredible DIVERSITY.

	This is what differs between commerical parties and parties thrown
by collectives/single sound system. Although one may have to give up the
nice lights (hmmm, some systems have nice lights as well as nice lasers),
the reward is a cheaper party put on because they want to see the party
happen. There are plenty of DJs out there that do not charge for the time
they spend dropping needles on records. So you have a choice right?  Do
you want to party within the bounds of what is allowed and all the pretty
lights and lasers and sound that blasts your ears out and makes you go
deaf - all which requires money for everything you wouldn't even think
could be charged (ok, that's an exaggeration) - maybe you don't care if
it's permitted or safe from a bust but still want lights and a bit of
comfort (this can actually work if you get enough people together) or do
you want to writh on the edges of "civilization" like the animals we
physically are? What in the party is important to you?
	Martin's parties are very necessary, and he does a hell of a good 
job at pulling off what he pulls off. How many people on this list I 
wonder started off going to his parties? Or were pulled into the scence 
by people who went to his parties? I respect Martin for doing something 
that I do not think I would have the patience to do - expose people to 
enough of the energy that they get involved (and once they get involved 
just enough, then they find their way to what are smaller parties at this 
time with the intense vibe on the main area and the friendly open vibe 
everywhere else you go). Many of the people who simply do what they do to 
make a party to go off for no more reason than to make a party go off 
started at a Gathering or Basics. Martin's parties are commerical but 
they serve their purpose - and I think little suburbia ma and pa who are 
already scared of people partying and living a lifestyle which gives up a 
certain amount of the "rewards" of living in "civilized" times like 
disposable diapers and plastic take away containers and double plastic 
bagging will do much better looking at Martin's parties before watching 
10,000 dance with so much energy coming off of the crowd in such a small 
space that there is no way in hell you cannnot feel it even if you have 
no idea of what is going on or what it is about (and that energy can be 
damn scary if you never expereinced anything primal)...
So what is the point of my spout I wonder? Martin's parties are not 
amazing parties some of  us are looking for, but that's cuz his parties 
are not what we are looking - I doubt Martin intends them to be - and 
while we have a point when saying massives in SF lack something, it is 
only because we are looking for something else, but without those 
massives, I know very few people who might have thought to look for 
something else - you can hear all kinds of stories about intenssity and 
things tribal but until you experience them, you have no idea what it is 
- right?.

  The most common is just charge what the market will bear.
  Maybe this will yield a slim margin or a huge one, just depends.

  With respect to the "product" you may have used earlier as an example,
  Brian, charge whatever you think people will be willing to pay for it.
  The market (your customers) will eventually determine the price for you
  (you'll have no customers or a ton, e.g.), and the appropriate price will
  be achieved after a fashion.  This may take some time given that the
  seller is not a known factor in the marketplace or the product is "new".

  Perhaps an example may be The Gathering.  Yes, it was priced
  rather high in absolute dollar terms but many people did seem willing
  to pay for it and were pleased with their choice. (I personally had
  a grand time, and that's saying a lot considering it is EXTREMELY RARE
  for me to pay that amount of money for an event.)  Of course, the promoter,
  Martin, has a track record of delivering the goods so he is able to
  satisfy despite the price.  Basically the "market" (in this case those
  who rave) have, for the most part, validated his price.  Regardless of
  the various positive and negative opinions expressed, it doesn't change
  the fact that there were quite a number of people there and they apparently
  didn't regret their "purchase".

  That's a very basic opinion, hope it was of some value, educational,
  entertainment, or otherwise.

  And, yes, just to comment *I* liked the mixing in of "Sweet Dreams"
  in the "house" room.

  Ciao!

Hello all,

I had the best time and didn't even want to return to Fresno.  Glad I got 
to meet at least one person (Shawna...how could I miss those leggings).  
I think I saw Wayne but wasn't sure and too embarassed to go up and be 
wrong.  Couldn't find you either Amy.  Next time.

I stayed till the very end (never done that before) and was still 
dancing.  Couldn't sleep at my hotel because..."I swear there was a party 
going on in my head!"

Martin was as good as I heard he would be.  I was very impressed to say 
the least.  I'm thinking of Planet New Year on NY eve, but I know many of 
you hesitate to attend Cool World events.  I had a great time at their 
Cyberfest2 at H Kaiser, but then, I'm not a very critical person.  

Oh, and can we please stop these flame wars about the price.  Bottom 
Line:  If you think it's too much...don't go:)

Marty

A sinple FM Transmitter, Mixer and tables draws about 180 watts.   A single
car battery and a 12 volt inverter is adequate to power the mixer, tables,
and FM Transmitter,  so these could be right near the crowd.   The DJ would
have to work from Earphones and a close speaker (perhaps from a boom box).
It is
most unfortunate that some mixers won't allow pipeing the right TT into the
right headphone,  and left TT into the left earphone plus mix them both.
I can do that with my TIAC Model 3 mixer.   It just don't have cross faders.
The output of the mixer (usually low level audio) drives the FM transmitter,
so there is NO AMPLIFIED audio in the system,  other than the headphones the
DJ is using.   Its important to keep the modulation as close to 100 % as
possible without going over (And possibly causing interference).

The cops would still ask everyone to leave,  but the advantages are that
the cops wouldn't know about it in the first place (unless illegally
parked cars, or other indicaters are present to attract them).   They
certainly wouldn't get any noise complaints.   :-)

Hey

Bleh!  Feh! How annoying!  Now I've gone and gotten sick, and I'm sure 
I caught it at the Gathering!  EEEWWWW!  Raver cooties!!  ;)  Oh well, 
at least if I'm going to get cooties, at least they're PLUR-infused 
cooties!  No finer kind!  Just gotta get better before any more good 
parties come along.  See you all soon!

Hello. I feel as if I should clear this up. I do not feel that sfravers 
are a "bunch of whiners". Sfravers are some of the most enlightened and
informative people I have ever had the chance to communicate with.

Say you lived in a beautiful house, pun intended. ;)  When you first 
moved in, you noticed the splendor everyday. But, as time wore on, you
began to focus more on the cracks in the ceiling and the misaligned
cabinets and stopped even noticing the house. Then, one day, someone
visiting from a different neighborhood pointed out the beauty you had
become immune to, thus bringing it back to your attention. Only then could
you change your focus and appreciate the house, and perhaps even renovate
it before it fell to pieces from neglect.  Get it? ;)

I can see how people feel justified expressing their ideas about the cost
of this event. However, I was simply trying to point out that people
*take our scene for granted*. When I said we have a rave here about every
two or three months, I wasn't kidding. People in this area complained
without trying to help fix things and whined constantly about things the
promoters had *no* control over. Eventually the promoters just got sick of
it. There are tons of available *legal* spaces, and at least a couple
hundred people that are just waiting to go. But no one is willing to put
up with that kind of stress and pressure for negative-level appreciation.
Events in Reno rarely make *any* money. 

I was trying to point out that SF is *incredible* and the scene 
*fantastic*. Taking it for granted is what this is all about.

Get my point? It's *OUR* scene, and if we don't do the renovating, 
nothing is ever going to change! 
				     lv, Alex

hello everyone!
	Tony and Nini here, we are brainstorming ideas to throw a little 
party/fashion show... the idea is to have different lines of clothing 
from various amateur to established designers like anna sui to persons 
like you who are interested in designing your own vision fashion wear. 
We would like the party to be non-profit, and a fun experience for 
everyone to get involved in. Ideas for how the party should happen are 
welcome, we are thinking of something with dj's spinning killer tunes, 
people dancing and having fun and sometime in the night a coordinated 
fashion show in tune with the music and not too distracting to the people 
who just want to dance...all completely interactive with the crowd ...

the resources we have to offer are alot of our time to organize, plan, 
bring people together...happy attitudes...fun...
	
we would love to hear from any positive attitudes, great ideas, models, 
amateur models, never tried modeling but Ill try it models,designers, 
never tried it  but it sounds fun designers, anyone interested in fashion, 
music, raving, and throwing a really cool fun party!

Love Nini and Tony
(aka -hierophant)

Well, I got a call from one of our DJ friends tonite, Dani, and she told me
to come down and check out her and Charlotte's weekly called Butterfly at
Casanova (Valencia @ 16th).

Casanova's a nice little neighborhood bar in the Mission, but for some
reason I had always walked by and neve stopped in before. What a mistake.
There were a bunch of great people hanging around! I got there around 10pm
when they were just ready to start spinning.

I quickly met a bunch of supporters/DJs/promoters/friends from our scene
there including: SF Raves contributor John Lee who was also spinning, Dani,
Charlotte, Scott Hardkiss, Loren and a few others that I probably forgot. I
also saw our friends Tom and Stacy there that put on the Nomad / XNTRK
parties. We all hung out and talked for a good long while and had a few
beers while listening to some great music.

It had that nice small neighborhood vibe to it with the twist that the
place was full of our various friends from the house/rave scene.

I would definitely recommend you all check it out if you have the chance.

cost: $2.00

Me Me!! My first official rave was the Gathering New Year's Eve 92/93 in 
Vallejo.  You thought last weekend's venue was huge....
This was the rave that got me hook, line and sinker.  I don't know how I 
would have taken the rave scene in had Cool World been a first for me.  I 
will never forget that rave at the Vallejo fairgrounds....:)

Amy

No flames, no harsh words. 

This is what saddens me the most. Raving is a business. ...whatever the 
market will bear.

Out of curiosity, why is there such a large amount of Cool World 
bashing? Have many of you that staunchly support one massive and so 
gleefully bash another actually gone to a Cool World? I haven't. I have 
heard "through the grapevine" that they are not very good parties, and 
wouldn't go anyways due to the price. Comments from those that have 
actually gone appreciated.

What nice lights?????????

Someone was talking about euro massives that are very commercial, but if you
pay $100 to go to Mayday in germany (including transportation from
Copenhagen, Denmark) you get high quality: 10 live acts at least 10 top DJs,
and state of the art sound and VISUALS that really makes you go into the
other dimension.

I never do drugs, I always use the vibe, the music and the lights to get
into the trance state.
The lights at the Gathering (which by the way was my second rave in this
part of the world) was very disappointing to me, since I am used to pay
$10-15 in DK and get good sound, lights and location.

So what I am getting at is that Martin should pay some attention ($$$) to
the visuals, everything else was good.

Just my 10 oere,
Rune

Before you accuse people of whining learn the what you are talking 
about. I am a member of a collective that *IS* doing something about it.

i moved to the bay area from orange county in 91.  the first gathering
was my first SF rave.  let's just say it changed my whole outlook on life.
i also went to the anniversary gathering in vallejo, and yeah, that
was a huge hall!  of course the accoustics were kindof wacked
and the ground was mud, but who cared?  another classic massive.

	I would have to venture a guess that you forget the law is kind 
of put on the back burner when it comes to agencies like the DEA. While 
you might not get physically abused, these agencies have a hell of a lot 
of leniency when it comes to intimidation and generally making your life 
completely shit. Who they choose to intimidate has little to do with who 
they can actually prosecute.
	Can I suggest if you want to make information available, put it 
on a website or an ftp-site and then publish the location.

Greetings!

Those of you that have been here a while are sure to appreciate the irony
of this post, those that haven't look at the archives in the week
preceeding Martin's post that Lee just dug out of the archives for a good
laugh. Black Adder, take heart; someone's gotta do it =)

Before proceeding let me state this unequivocally: In my opinion Martin's
heart is *totally* in the right place, he gives a maximum shit about the
safety and comfort of his patrons and I have a deep respect for what he's
done over the last four years and how he's done it. It's not the path I
would have or have chosen, but in what he's done, Martin's done a far
better job than anyone else attempting similar things. So I offer these
comments in the spirit of friendship and support, knowing full well that he
truly values constructive feedback.

Last March 18th at the 1-year Friends & Family, myself and quite a number
of other people learned a very important lesson: You can have the purest
heart, the finest of intentions, plan till the cows come home, DO YOUR BEST
and still not do enough. This doesn't mean that you or the party failed, or
wasn't great, it just gives you a list of things to do different next time.

So, Martin, I had a wonderful time at The Gathering, thank you; I know you
put your whole self into it, (and we all know you did the hokey pokey) but
in some ways it wasn't quite enough; here are *my suggestions* for what to
do different next time:

  o Make the people that work for you SHOW UP ON TIME. I was at the party to
    help from 6pm til 9:00 am; monitors for Dedication didn't arrive till
    9:30pm. The person doing visuals for Dedication didn't show up till
    9:00 pm. These are only two examples, there were more.

  o Hire (or get to volunteer) *way* more staff. Lights were still on and
    visuals were still being hung in Inspiration at 10:15pm!, well into the
    *second* DJ's set. You also need Dedicated Water Crews; we formed them
    on an impromptu basis but even so there was no water for thousands of
    people for nearly 2 hours. This also happened at Freedom. Also, alert
    security that people are coming and going to get water; a good friend
    (who payed to get in!) was harshly searched by security while returning
    with  his van full of water at 6am; this should definitely be avoided.

  o Be ready to Start The Party On Time! See above two items. Both of the
    opening DJs played to the set up crew with all the lights on. Stevie got
    to play for 15 minutes...

  o Furnishings. I know it's hard to make 4000 people (or whatever)
    comfortable but the space badly needed some soft areas to lounge in. Too
    many hard cement walls and floors. Get some rugs, carpets, tapestries,
    beanbags etc. See Chrysalis for a good example.

  o Charge less. $20 is plenty; $25 is overkill. (You can pay me less if you
    need to!)

I'll be happy to help with all of the above.

I would like to commend Martin for the Toy drive. I helped carry all those
bags full of Toys in the morning (there were like 30 huge bags!) and I
think they'll put a lot of smiles on a lot of faces. Nice one Martin.

I'd like to close this on the following note: After nearly three years of
throwing parties I've come to view a successfull rave as nothing short of
Magic, and I do mean MAGIC in the traditional sense. Few people can
actually make this magic happen, can acutally open up a safe space for us
to have transcendant experiences, for us to come together. This is true for
small parties and especially true when your talking 4000 people. Besides
Martin I don't know ANYONE ELSE in the bay area that can *reliably* make
this magic happen on this scale.

So congratulations on four years of good magic Martin, keep it up.

take it easy

Hello, everyone! I'm very pleased to have found this list. Kudos to Lee
Fogel for guiding my way...

First, a short bio: I'm 31, and moved here last January from New York
City. Before that, I went to school in Pittsburgh (CMU), and lived in
Providence, RI, Martha's Vineyard, MA, and suburban Cleveland before
that. I currently live in SF, and develop applications software for
$$$.

For a very long time, I have searched for a particular niche that I
really could relate to on a fundamental level. I disliked the beer
blasts with all the jocks in high school, and avoided them. Hanging out
with the local burn-outs bored me, and seemed way too unproductive.
Besides, they considered me to smart and nerdy, anyway. In college, I
started hanging out with fellow geeks, but didn't feel really great
about myself there, either. There are only so many times you can hack
all night in the computer lab, listen endlessly to spacey music, and
play RPG's.

I joined the ranks of my college's alternative music radio station. It
was the few places at school where fine arts, humanities, science, and
engineering students related. After a couple of years of great
inter-relatedness, and forging an alternative music scene in the Steel
City, academic burn-out set in, and the magic faded. I focused on
graduating, and establishing my career in New York City.

Anyway, back to the subject at hand...

I finally stumbled across the rave scene at the Gathering last
Saturday. I was back in touch with that magic once again, and at a much
higher level than I have previously experienced.  Needless to say, I
was hooked! Never have I felt so loved and respected by so many people
at one time. Looking back on the evening, I noticed how I was treading
lightly at the scene -- the openness was *very* new and different for
me. [Most of the New York clubs, by comparison, are incredibly cold and
crowded experiences.] There's more for me to give up and surrender to
next time.

The music was fabulous (I was in the Inspiration room most of the
evening), and the visuals, while somewhat primative technologically,
worked for me. Actually, I thought the liquid kaleidoscope projections
were kind of nostalgic, sort of a throwback to the 60's.

The biggest thing missing for me was furniture. Lots of soft, comfy
places to regenerate after bouncing off the floor for hours at a time
would be really nice. The group of folks I hung out with improvised,
with bags and jackets, although I'm really not to thrilled to have to
send my leather jacket out to the cleaners afterwards.

All in all, it was an incredible experience, and I'm looking forward to
the next encounter...

Peace and love to you all, 
George

> What's a good place to get (color) flyers made?

You want color paper or printing?

For a cheap way, just go to Kinkos.  Yeah, you can get copies cheaper at 
Safeway or somewhere...  But there machines are good and turn out copies that 
look like they were printed.  They have all kinds of color paper and you can 
even use color toner cartridges.  If you're creative, you can use three 
different toner cartidges and just run different parts of your flyer through 
for different colors.  It looks good.  What's cool is they will also do all the 
work for you for like a buck.  I did the flyer for my show on my computer and 
printed it out there on their laser printers.  Then I had them blow it up to 
fit the page better.  I also wanted handouts so I had them rescale it to fit 
two on a page.  And then had them split apart.  Each cut you make is like a 
buck.

I actually had a good experience there.

He didn't actually mix in the original, it's a cheesy white label bootleg
house mix. It's ok over other tunes, but on it's own it's a bit flat. For
the definitive killer version of Sweet Dreams, find the 1991 Nightmare mix
by Dave Angel.

Hey

Was just wondering if anybody had any information about this, I mean 
aside from what I found on a couple of websites.  One, how much is it 
(how do they deal with that) and two, what kind of music is it?  They 
made no mention of either of these things on the websites.  Any other 
info people might have would be useful too.  Thanks!

>I ended up at Planet New Year last year and was very disappointed  that I
wasted my New Year going to this massive. I was with a few friends of mine
that were under age, and with Wicked out of the question and with free
passes to the Cool world event we decided we would go there instead of
drving aimlessly around. I think driving around would have been a better idea. 

As we got to the entrance we were suprised at the enormous line up that
snaked its way back from the building. In line were at least 700-900 people,
mostly under the age of 20, and all pushing on the rails that cordended them
off like cattle. There was a gate that opened up to let about 100 folks in
at a time , to another cordened off area right at the entrance and every
time the gate was opened the pushing from behind from impatient people
caused a few to fall to be trampled by the uncaring crowd.It looked to me
that it was a very dangerous situation, too many people and no security to
control the mayhem. Just as my friends and I were going in the gest entrance
we saw the gate crash down and a river of humanity swarm twords the
building,pushing down any barriers ( and any people that were in its wake).
About 500 of them got into the building before security made it outside to
stop them. This was the only thing at this party that made a smile come to
my face, for once the promoters who cared nothing for the people and only
about how much $ they were raking in, got thiers. A whole bunch of ravers
with no tickets ( I think they were bieng scalped there for about $25) were
able to get in when the ggates were crashed. But many were injured bieng
pushed into the barriers or trampled and it was very dissapionting to see
people caring less for eachother and more about getting into the party.

As we got inside and saw the hordes of KIDS and I do mean kids, it was
almost midnight and a rapper was on the main stage screaming out some tune
about Ex and how everybody should get high , high, high. The party was full
of gangster types, a lot of bubblegum ravers, and alot of really high
people. I overheard someone saying that they had heard about the party on
LIVE 105
and I knew I had entered the Palaidum on a much larger scale. Needless to
say I found the party to be full of people who cared nothing for eachother
or for the quality of music bieng played ( the rappers had obviously taken a
whole bunch of the E they were singing about and were off beat and tune).

The Techno and House room was an 1/8 th of the size of the 'live' room and I
found the vibe in there vagley inviting. But you couldnt breathe and you
were covered in sweat ( not all your own ) as soon as you entered. The music
was semi kickin but nobody seemed to know or care who was spinning.The
corners of this room were filled with vomit and people adding to the
quagmire with thier own. After watching this melee,. I couldnt bring myself
to join in, I went to search for the people I had come in with because the
countdown was minutes away. I located my brother and our friends and went
back to the big room to count down to the new year.When the countdown got to
Zero the mayhem lasted only a minute and then the only good energy I had
felt all evening was gone again.I saw no huggs and kisses, and the music
started right back up, the same terrible rappers. At this piont I decided to
find my friend who was involved in putting on this event , and politely tell
him I was leaving. When I did find him, he was hiding with the rest of the
crew ' backstage, totally avoiding the party and the people. I asked him why
he wasant out expieriancing his own party, and his response was " I'd rather
not go out there,. too many wierdos out there." I was disgusted by his greed
and how little he cared for the scene and for the people , both which he saw
as suckers to be taken advantage of.I left vowing I would never attend
another Cool World event, deeply dissapointed in  my friend and the souless
event I had just wasted my New Years Eve at

The icing on the cake came as I was walking back to the car. Two rather
large, obviously inihebriated guys dressed in posse wear were arguing just
outside the doors and one took two steps back, pulled his arm back and
landed the loudest and most violent punch I had ever seen to the guy he was
arguing with. The guy who got hit , slammed the ground equally as hard as he
was hit, and didnt move. For all I know that guy never got up. Nobody around
payed any attention, especially the security detail that was standing near
enough to stop the guy that had hit  and was now kicking the guy on the
ground. I was with my little brother and two other friends and thought it
would be safer to walk away, and did so feeling sick at the things I had
seen and the abomination of an event like COOL WORLD, more like CRUEL WORLD,
bieng related to our scene or even calling it a rave.

So this ends my COOL WORLD saga. In short dont go. Only if to send a message
to the folks who put on such partys undr the guise of it bieng a rave, wich
in my eyes is an event for the people not for taking advantage of them. It
is partys like this one that give
' massives' the stigma they now carry. 

To all those I miss and will see again this spring when I return to SF ( I
am currently hibernating in Canada), Happy Hollidays. Be safe 
in your revelry, and by all means be thorough. May the New year bring
expierances unequaled and happiness unbridled. Peace my sisters and
brothers......peace and love to u all.

So,  where can we all go to get good reception where a lot of people can

What about the hills behind Stanford...   (Remember,  we won't be making

Ooops :) 
90.1 KZSU Stanford

You can get it in most of San Jose, very rarely in the heart of SF and in 
some parts of Oakland. You can definately get it around Palo Alto, 
Redwood City & Mountain View.

Some reviews:

Kape ill miester 'top/bottom' [a13]
Collaboration between Mark Broom and Steve Pickton. Bottom is very basic with a very deep 
808-kick and a hypnotic kinda sound. At 2/3 of the record some eery strings start floating in. 
Cool. Top is dark techno with a strange swing to it (the open hat).

Kosmic Messenger (Stacy Pullen) 'flash/death march' [plink plonk]
New one from Derrick May's student. Flash (nothing to do with that Green Velvet-stomper) is okee, 
but the other side I like better. Death march has a superdeep bass that sounds very well with the 
organkindlike sound. grrrreat!

Silent Breed 'Amazing pudding' [A.F.U.]
This is the first one from this label that I like. On this pink record SB combine an acidline 
with a distorted piano(?)sound filtered in a strange way. Keeps the party going...

Qorg 2 'astral' [out on a limb]
Although the out on a limb-sleeves suggest that there's some very clubby and happy stuff in it,  
the records are actually pretty okee. So is this one. The AA-side you can use at any time, 
because of the 'close your eyes and drift away-feel. The A-side combines some heavy percussion 
with an outerspace-sound. Rocks....

Beverly Hills 808303 vs. Auto Kinetic [electric music/analog USA]
>From the Auto Kinetic-side I like the second track best. It has that hypnotic acid-mood we all 
liked so much (at least I did) but now with some distorted sounds inbetween the 303's. The other 
side by the uncrowned kings of overloaded 808303-hence that name-acid. These guys are super 
underground so I don't know if their other records are available in the US. I can't get enough of 
it.  . 

Also cool:
Surgeon 'electronically tested' [downwards]
Wink & dj ESP 'stairway to headphones' [head in the clouds]
Air Liquide 'red and black ep'
Trance Induction 'sirocco ep' [prime]
Psyche 'airborne 303' [pure music]

Thanks for the VERY thorough response. 

Geoff White made a very valid point regarding people bringing the vibe to a 
party. In your opinion, what drew such an apparently vibeless crowd?

     Hi everyone,
     
     It's probably a little bit late for a review, especially given that 
     this week's calendar is already out. However I am only now beginning 
     to come back down to earth after Saturday, so here are my thoughts.
     
     I had an absolute blast! I loved every minute of it, and didn't want 
     it to end. The music, the people, the vibe, everything was simply 
     superb.
     
     This was my first "massive". Although I was expecting the party to be 
     big, I didn't expect it to be this big. Given the size I thought the 
     party was incredibly well managed. All of the problems that I have 
     seen at much smaller parties were not there. The long line at the 
     start moved very quickly. The staff certainly didn't get in my face. 
     The space was huge and well ventilated. The toilet lines were short. 
     And probably best of all I didn't encounter any negative energy from 
     anyone. By the way, do we have an official answer on the number of 
     people yet? 
     
     I was there with five very close friends. My partner in crime J-C, the 
     man who can never stand still. My old mates Rob and Leighton who 
     haven't been out dancing for a couple of months now. And finally we 
     had a couple of first timers Ann and Sophie. They are already asking 
     me when the next party is.
     
     I met quite a few sfravers which was fantastic. I bumped into Amy, 
     Wayne, Vince, Crunchman and Ethan (thanks for the tape!) again. I also 
     got to meet Shawna, Dimitriou (sp?), Tom and his friend (sorry!) for 
     the first time. I know there were others, so please excuse me for 
     leaving you out.
     
     Tom I loved your message. The last few songs of the night when the 
     lights have been turned on is always my favorite time. It's so 
     incredible to look around and see the smiles on everyone's faces. It 
     feels like the dawn of a new beginning. And yes I am saw also. I've 
     strained muscles in both my legs and in my neck, not to mention 
     blisters all over my feet. I guess that's what happens when you 
     dance for seven and a half hours with shoes and no socks!
     
     Finally some random thoughts and suggestions. 
     
     Running out of water was a bit of a pain. Unfortunately I didn't 
     find the tap like some others. Did anyone else taste that cranberry 
     juice? Yuck!
    
     I also echo the thougths regarding the need for more cushions, 
     pillows etc. Without a decent sized chill-out area it doesn't quite 
     feel like a true rave.
 
     Did anyone else think it was a little too dark, especially in the 
     bigger room. I need to see more smiles! I also agree with the 
     comments about the visuals. Give us some more lasers. 
     
     I found that the two room setup broke up the vibe for me a little 
     bit. Each time I was really in a zone dancing, and about to be 
     transported to another level, a little voice in the back of my head 
     would say something like "Your missing Jeno in the other room". I 
     guess that if that's my only real gripe, then I should just shutup 
     and dance!
     
     Thanks to Martin, the crew and everyone who was there for a 
     fantastic party. Well worth the $25. Until next time...
     
     Keep on smiling!
     
     Scott.
     
     P.S. If you are wondering who the hell I am, I was the Australian 
     bastard with long hair and half a beard, wearing the multi-coloured 
     striped overalls.

        Sorry for the massive SPAM but i just had this text typed out and
wanted to get it to all the people i care about before i take off on
vacation and my net.access is limited :)

        ok, here's some more words ov wizdom c/o 'feel' zine from san fran
that a friend of mine sent to me:
        ==============================
        signs and symptoms of inner peace:

        watch for signs of peace, the hearts of a great many have already
been exposed to it and it seems likely that we could find out society
experiencing it in epidemic proportions, which then of course, could pose a
serious threat to what has up to now seemed a fairly stable condition of
conflict in the world

        1.Tendency to think and act spontaneously rather than from fears
based on past experiences
        2.an unmistakable ability to enjoy each moment
        3.loss of interest in judging other people
        4.loss of interest in judging self
        5.loss of interest in interpreting actios of others
        6.loss of interest in conflict
        7.loss of interest loss of ability to worry *this is a very serious
symptom*
        8.frequent, overwhelming episodes of appreciation.
        9.contented feeling of connectedness with others and nature
        10.frequent attacks of smiling through the eyes, from the heart
        11.increasing tendancy to let things happen rather than make them happen
        12.increase in susceptibility to love extended by others as well as
the uncontrollable urge to extend it.

        WARNING!
        If you have all or even most of the above symptoms, please be
advised that your condition of PEACE may be so far advanced as being
incurable!
        If you are exposed to anyone exhibiting several of these symptoms,
remain exposed only at your own risk. this condition of PEACE is probably
at it's most infectious stage.
        -saskia davis-

=================================

        hope ya liked it! happy holidays ;) i'm taking off for a vacation
in San Fran tomorrow so i hope that everyone has an AWESOME x-mess and a
wicked new year, i'm totally stoked to be partying in frisco but i'll be

in arizona, probably because of the heat, it's illegal for any public
establishment to deny a request for a drink of water if they are able to
provide it. perhaps we could enact legislation calling water a basic human 
right, thus making it illegal to selectively distribute (charge for) it.
perhaps a mandatory drinking fountain, with, of course, a minimum flow rate
so one can rehydrate at a reasonable rate. mr. hallinan?

        I know that in Manchester, UK similar legislation has been brought
forth by concerned clubbers/ravers to city council and there are a lot of
bylaws that enforce water availability. Totally necessary imho!
        peace,

12/18/95 For immediate release:  New York City's Christmas Present to Artists

At 1:30 P.M. Sunday 12/17/95 eight plainclothes police handcuffed and
arrested three artists on Prince Street between Mercer and Greene Streets in
SoHo. The three artists, Robert Lederman 45, Lei Chang 36 and Joe Costin 68
are members of A.R.T.I.S.T. (Artists' Response To Illegal State Tactics).
Tourists and local residents doing  their Christmas shopping watched in shock
as police stuffed original oil paintings into garbage bags and sped off to
avoid an angry crowd that formed. The police also confiscated protest signs,
photos of previous artist arrests and literature detailing the bitter three
year struggle between street artists and New York City.

The arrested artists were charged with not having a vending license, despite
the fact that the Department of Consumer Affairs routinely tells artists
applying for a license that they don't need one based on the First Amendment,
or that the waiting list for a license is totally closed to the general
public and will not be open for at least the next six years. According to
Department of Consumer Affairs spokespersons there are over 5,000 people on
the waiting list. In some years not one license is issued. Confiscated art,
regardless of the cases' outcome, is rarely returned to the artists. Most of
the art is sold at the monthly N.Y.P.D. auction. The $14 million dollars
raised by selling confiscated possessions each year helps fund the N.Y.P.D..

The Commanding Officer of the Peddler Task Force, Lt. Johnson, told SoHo
artists on 12/3/95 that he had been ordered by Mayor Giuliani to arrest more
artists based on a recent ruling by Federal Judge Miriam Cedarbaum. In that
controversial ruling the judge claimed, in direct contradiction to 50 years
of Supreme Court, Appelate and State Court rulings, that visual art is not
protected by the First Amendment. The street artists, who are plaintiffs in a
Federal lawsuit [Lederman et. al. v. City of New York 94 Civ. 7216 (MGC)] are
represented by the law firm of Dewey Ballantine and Volunteer Lawyers for the
Arts and are appealing the ruling. 
 The eight arresting officers later claimed to be transit police with nothing
to do, who had been issued special orders to arrest artists in SoHo after
both Peddler Squad and First Precinct officers failed to make enough artist
arrests. Police Department sources in the First Precinct claim that City
Council Member for SoHo Kathryn Freed continuously pressures them to make
artist arrests and has arranged the reassignment of at least two police
captains in the past year because they didn't crack down hard enough on the
artists. Despite over 200 artists being arrested on N.Y.C. streets since
1993', not one case has resulted in a Criminal Court conviction. The District
Attorney's office acting in  cooperation with the N.Y.C. Corporation Counsel
has dismissed all charges in each case, thereby avoiding the possibility of
an appeal which might result in overturning  New York City's Vending
Ordinance.

Robert Lederman, the president of A.R.T.I.S.T. has been arrested 11 times for
selling his art. "We all intend to be right back on Prince Street tomorrow",
said Lederman. "We will not be bullied by these unconstitutional tactics and
false arrests". More arrests, and an ongoing protest, are expected on Prince
Street this week. Photos of the arrests are available. Also available are
transcripts of taped conversations between the Department of Consumer Affairs
and artists applying for a license; affidavits from city officials, etc. For
more info contact: A.R.T.I.S.T. (718) 369-2111 Permission to freely

specifically, that little party in the aquatic park!
	memories flooded my mind as i woke up to the house marathon, i 
left it on all nite and got some bizzare dreams as a result.
	just wanted to share.
	much love and appreciation for everyone, virtual hugs.
	and contaminated with that PEACE thing:)

Hi everybody,

I've been following this list for a few month and I really apreciate this great 
community of "ravers on-line". I'm sorry I don't participate a lot, but I'm kind 
of shy (true !) ... and French. So please read this message with a very strong 
French accent !

Anyway, I will spend the next week and new year's eve in Boston and I would 
appreciate if one of yours could give some good ideas of cool spots to go out or 
visit. I've tried the Hyperreal Web site, "North East", but according to 
Hyperreal there's nothing going on next week up there.

Thanx a lot for any ideas.

J-C
 
PS : after this great Gathering event, hi to Amy, Dimitri, "HMV-Ron" (spelling 
?), Vince and any single smiling face I've met last saturday.

Bleah!!  I tried to find 90.1 on my radio, and just barely through the 
massive amounts of static could I hear just the bass drum back beat, 
just enough to let me know I'd found the right station but no more than 
that!  My radio's a real tease...

Yeah, Clublife magazine is sponsering a free NYE party in the SoCal or NV
desert, but personally I wouldn't support any of Art Parent's (publisher of
Clublife and evil rave promoter (tm)) events. See the SoCal Rave list
archives on hyperreal for more discussion.

Strong rumours of Begin Again happening - it would be pre-sale only,
though. (Hmm, wonder where they got that idee... =) )

Actually, I don't think your standard "alkaline" battery uses mercury. 
Mercury is more typically found in watch/hearing-aid style batteries.

Also, standard rechargeable batteries are made from Nickel-Cadmium, and
cadmium happens to be far more dangerous than mercury or the contents
of an "alkaline battery". Due to the eco-toxicity of cadmium, I believe
it is against the law to dispose of a standard ni-cad battery in the
trash (take a look at the warning label on the batteries).

Ob-rave/kzsu. Did anybody happen to be nice enough to record this gig?
It would be great to have copies of the sounds, preferably before it
gets out onto the waves, preferably before the sound gets munged by
KZSU's crappy and oft-overmodulated transmitter (I used to DJ there
back in the day, so I know what goes on down there!). I'd pay $$$ to
get these tapes or DATs. 

If anybody has DATs, I'd be happy to dupe 'em since I got two DAT
players (well, one of them happens to be my tape back up on my computer
but it still lets me do digital-digital copies audio DAT deck).

I went to the Adventures at the Musicdome thing Cool World did.  It is, so
far the one and only rave I have been to.  I had a good time even though my
ears have never been the same....AAAAHHHH.....STOP THE RINGING...and I got
seperated from friends for two hours.  My boyfriend, who I met for the first
time there, said it was boring and the people had too much of a gang
mentality.  But I find he says that about a lot of things.  Well, regardless
of what anyone else says, I would go to another one and probably will for New
Years.  As long as the music is danceable I have a good time.

Hello All,

I know this is a stupid question, but....What the heck is a "bubblegum 
raver?"  I keep seing the term and I'm not quite sure I have the full 
picture.

The picture I come up with is the kids that put a bunch of paint on their 
faces, put their hair in pigtails, and suck on pacifiers (ridiculous IMHO).  
Is this right?

Please enlighten me:)

Marty

Gee, I thought a bubblegum raver is any raver that has the audacity to
sit down at a massive rave. As wise man say, he who sit down at
massive, stand up with bubblegum on keester.

     I set aside my boom box and tapes this morning to bring to the 
     office...TOMORROW :{ Thinking that I'd tape and listen to some great 
     music while working.  Only to drive into work this a.m. and find da 
     house stuff going on _now_ 'cause I got my days mixed up w/the KZSU 
     House Marathon.  Silly me!
     
     Nonetheless, I am so infused w/my 15 minutes of love and light that 
     came through the radio waves that I just had to beam this out to all 
     of you wishing you a wonderful morning, and rays of warm, embracing 
     hope.  
     
     Have a great day, y'all.  I know I am especially when I jet outta here 
     at 12:30 pm today!
     
     Lotsa luv,
     Diane

     I think we ought to just put on our walkmans and invade White Plaza on 
     Stanford Campus.  School's out and they're putting it on right there.  
     Wouldn't it be mad if a bunch of us did that this afternoon :)  I'm 
     supposed to do Xmas errands after a 1pm meeting but... ;)

Ok,  so now it's time to whip out those walkmans,  and everyone put new 
batteries in your walkman,   go out somewhere where you can recieve KZSU 
(And pick me up on the way!!  - hint hint),  and lets all TUNE IN,  and 
dance our arses off...    :-)

So,  where can we all go to get good reception where a lot of people can 
congregate (All wearing walkmans of course)...   Anyone got any ideas? 
What about the hills behind Stanford...   (Remember,  we won't be making 
any noise).

I don't have any doubt that it'll happen, and that there will be tons of
people there, (he _invited_ Fox news to his last one for publicity) but
he's done some really sketchy things in the past and holds the dubious
distiction of getting a big "No Respect To:" from Altern8 in the liner
notes on one of their records.

Since I'm going to be stuck out here away from my family for Xmas, and
I figure others will be too, I'd like to offer the idea (suggested
previously by Brian D.) of having a Xmas Eve gathering for the rootless.

My house is a good place to have such.  We have plenty of room, and a nice
secluded location for such music as we want to play.

I'd like to do a potluck dinner, followed by some talking and music.  If
any DJs want to contribute (yeah, right), I can have ready enough 
amplification for the space I have.

Plus I have lots of really old arcade games (Tempest, Joust, etc.) for
you nostalgia freaks.

I don't anticipate huge response, just a little family gathering...please
do tell ASAP if you're interested.

(I'm just off 280, near 85: about 40 easy miles from SF, 15 from SJ).

Black Adder:
I believe it was because the party was mostly attended by those who heard
about it on Live 105.. I dont want to generalize about
who listens to this station or that all the people who do are potentially
troublemakers, but I do think that it attracted many undesireables ( ie:
people who seek out fights, are  Gangster wannabe's, were there to get out
of control on drugs.. ect.. ect..).

I also think alcohol was a contributing factor to the agro vibe and a major
factor in all the fights and shoving matches that I witnessed.I believe many
of the kids came to the party to blow off steam and did so in the form of
violence and excessive drug dosing. Many folk were there from the East Bay (
again I dont want to generalize , there are many wonderful people from the EB)
and alot were dressed Gangland style. I believe that alot of them had never
been to any smaller raves and cared nothing for eachother let alone creating
a good vibe. This compounded with the uncaring crew who put on this
function, and the security who let the fights get outta controll made this
party not only vibeless, but downright SCARY. I also think that many of the
kids attending 
were angry, violent prone  and lacked compassion. No compassion for your
fellow man = no chance for a good vibe.

                                                                            
                                                                            
             Peace Y'all,

I hope everyone is having happy holidays.  My favorite thing about
winter solstice is that the days will now be getting longer, and
springtime will return soon, with green grass, flowers, and outdoor
parties :).  Check out this URL:

Have no fear ;) I wasn't planning on going. Pacific gets my $ which I will 
gladly give, and thank them for taking it.

It was more a question of perceptions being based on reality. I have 
always heard that Cool World in particular was a "bad" party. I have seen 
it mentioned constantly on SF-Raves. In fact, I am sure at one point or 
another I have made fun of it based on what I had heard. But I had never 
seen any *SOLID* reasons why Cool World made for such a bad scene, until 
now of course. Amys' post deriding it got me to thinking about my own 
perceptions of events I had never been to, and the acceptance here of 
slamming this production company by people, many of whom have also never 
attended one of these events. So I was thinking "shame on me." These 
tales of horror however make me even more sure that I don't want to attend 
one of these parties. Thanks much for the edification....

Helo everyone-

I just wanted to relay a story and ask a question.

I was in Tower Records shoping for the holidays when I came across Abduction
by Eat Static for *9 Bucks*.  Well not having one of their disks and knowing
their rep I snatched it up and I love it!   Is anyone planning on going to
see them live on Jan 4th.?  I hear DRC, Alex, Ethan, Jon Carel and Craig
Ellenwood are also going to be there (at Sound Factory????not sure).  Sounds
like a phat show.  

Well happy Holidays to all and to all a great night!   :)
Peace,                      Austin

Hello-

Just a few thoughts-

It has been my experiance -dealling with sellers, users, buyers and selling
once myself-  that dealing with E is not a very risky business.  Sure you are
distributing an illeagal substance that could cost you a minimum of 5 years
in jail(I think) but your customers are very respectable people.  There
ravers- you probable won't be held up at gun point at a rave and a raver is
less likely to jump U for your cash flow.  When you buy powder (I used to)
you could get it for 9 bucks a cap.-When you don't cut it and you actually
get an ounce.  
   I personally would not trust the caps going around right now because it is
too easy to cut them or fill um with bunk shit unless you know the people
selling it.
     Now I have notices alot of wafers/sausers(flat discs kinda
yellowish/brown) going around that are good but I hear they have heroin in
them.  Can anyone confirm this????  I won't take em if they do.  Tylenols can
still be bunk but you have less of a chance of that than capsuls.  I've heard
these go for 10$ up to 15$ a hit.  Still a 5 dollar profit is not bad
considering what kinda profit you make off other drugs.  
     The main risks I see with selling E are getting caught with it on your
persons( being searched or pulled over and being searched),  selling to a
narc - believe me they are out there at raves, or a security spots you
selling - many security don't really care, actually (talking to some) and I
have even met some who sell (they might confiscate your stash and turn around
and sell it to the next guy - I've seen this).
      The penelty for selling drugs can be harsh and this is the main reason
I don't do it any more.  I also don't believe in selling bad drugs to anyone
- many people trust the dealer to sell them a good time and when they get
ripped off that breaks down the trust and disapoints the buyer.  I won't ever
sell drugs again even though the money is really good($500-1000 a night or
more).
    I remember back in Septembr or October there was a billion doller Ecstacy
bust in Sonoma.  These guys were major supliers of the west coast.  Following
the bust there was a lot of bunk E going around.  Now It is starting to pick
up but who knows for how long.  
     I hope this answered your question some what.  If there is anything else
I might be able to answer let me know.

	I know it is late, but if anyone is driving to Walnut Creek 
tonight for Kundalini from San Francisco, I would be grateful for a 
ride.  I've been working on a paper for school that is stressing me out, 
and just feeling generally sort of in the pits... I've come to suspect 
that the Winter Solistice is a natural psychic low for me - last year I 
felt so rotten on that day that it stuck in my mind, and I'd rather not 
repeat the experience this year.  Has anyone else noticed this effect?  
I don't think it's just the proximity to Christmas, although that may 
have something to do with it.
	Anyway, being together with a group of happy ravers tonight would be a 
blessing... if you are going and have room, please give me a page or 
leave a voicemail message at (415) 270-7887.

Thank you,

And that's why I think it is appropriate to make a judgement based on

The only problem is when reputation depends on who you talk to. I would 
hate to think that Cool World was getting bashed because none of their 
friends were on SF-Raves backing them up. I am in no way sticking up for 
Cool World, just making an observation that "reputation" can be a 
slippery lil' devil.

So: I actually got several responses to my post yesterday, so it looks like
we're going to have a small gathering @ Casa Miraloma (my house).

Note: Unless fifty or so people show up unannounced, this will be a relatively
small gathering -- don't expect another Blue Cube.  Do expect a gathering 
of friends in a neat house in the hills.

I'd like to start with a potluck dinner.  Let's say dinner is 6ish, and
showing up before is fine if you need to cook or reheat something.  I'll
be whipping up a big batch of marinara sauce, most likely (which turned 
out really excellent last time).  We'll eat, talk, and play crusty old
arcade games until people get an urge to dance, at which point we'll fire
up the sound.  If you have your favorite CDs/mix tapes/records, you are
highly encouraged to bring them.  If you are a DJ, you are guaranteed
deck time so long as you bring your coffin (I have no 1200s).  Feel free to
bring lights, toys, warm fuzzies, luv phasers, etc.  The gathering will
be over when everyone gets tired.  If you need to crash I have ample space.

Please email me or call 415-948-6369 if you are coming so I have some idea of
who to expect.  Spur of the moment is OK if your phone died, tho.

Here are the directions:

>From San Francisco:  Take 280 South about 40 miles out of the city, past
84 and Page Mill Road.  The next exit is El Monte Road.  Take El Monte
North (the sign on the exit ramp should say "Los Altos").  If you hit 85,
you've gone too far.

>From San Jose:  Take 280 North to El Monte Road (a few exits after 85).
Take El Monte North (the first off-ramp at the exit).  Page Mill is too far.

>From El Monte Road:  Go right @ the second light (Summerhill).  Go up the
hill, go down the hill.  At the bottom of the hill, turn right on Miraloma
(note: it's a small street, looks like a driveway).  If you hit a stop-sign,
you've gone too far.  Go up Miraloma until it turns a 90 degree right.
The driveway there to the left is mine (12580).  Park on the street (or I
can't get my car out) and walk up.  The house is red, and one story.

See you there!

Happy solstice, 

On the KZSU house marathon, at about 11:55 last night, the DJ said
there would be a "party" tonight. He said the map site was Ameba on
Haight. Does anyone know what party he was referring to?

That KZSU thang was so frustrating cause I couldn't hear any of it
even though I tried all day. Some religious channel tromps out KZSU
where I work, and I had to work to 11:45pm. aaaarrrrrgghhh!.

I also tried to get KZSU on the speaker of my sparcstation (that's
possible ya know), but we have a third reich firewall system
(aaaaarrrggghh over and over again!).

Nevertheless, it was very cool of KZSU to do it. I got the impression
it was pretty good. Many thank yous to them and the DJs.

Ravers Rights Association - It seems the Aussies have a really good idea
that we should also try up here.    This,  in relation to a lot of "bad
press" on ravers from the local Sydney media.   A lot of people "including
me",  flooded the Daily Telegraph Mirror (A Sydney paper),  and it worked,
because they are publishing the protest letters that were flooding in.

Details outlined and proposed below...  They referece Anna Wood,  a young
girl that died as a result of taking "E",  whereas the media was having a
field day,  bashing raves BIG TIME.

Yea,  well there was little or NO notice of this event in the last 3 - 4 days
leading up to it.   We ALL could have used a little more notice.

Next time KZSU has a HOUSE MARATHON,  lets try and get the details out a little
earlier so we can plan to make it a "Silent rave".

I think I mentioned that we're doing the Xmas Eve (Sunday) time for the
party, but if I didn't, that's the date/time.  Once again, dinner Sunday
@ 6ish, arrive a bit early if you need to cook/reheat/etc.

Plus, I've had more than one person tell me they'd like to go but
need a ride.  If anyone is coming down from SF and has space in their car,
please post ASAP with info so that others may get here.

Or, the Mountain View CalTrain is reasonably close.  I wouldn't want to walk 
it (a few miles) but I could pick people up if they know what time
they'll be arriving.  Keep me posted...

...by telephone, please, after today, as I don't want to have to go back in
to work this weekend to read email.

This could be a lot of fun!  Come on by.

It was something ( seeing a person slammed like that) that I had never seen
before at any event I had ever gone to. I started going to raves BECAUSE the
scene frowned on violence and perpetuated the peaceful ethic. It really
shook me up to see that guy go down and nobody do anything about it, the
security was 50 yards away , saw the whole thing happen and turned thier
backs. The guy who layed the punches was 6ft tall and at least 200 lbs. I
was about to say something , or go make the security do something
but my brother said, " leave be, you migh get hurt if u get involved, lets
get outta here." To this day I still remember how hard that guy got hit, and
how helpless and angry I felt at myself for not doing anything. I still
wonder if that guy ever got up  . I will always regret not helping him  or
insisting that the security do something. :( Yes lets keep this scene
underground and attended by people who wont stand for violence . please
always promote the peace.

Shawna, this is definitely not an event to miss.  It was the most 
incredible experience I've ever had...partywise.

It's held every Labor Day in the Black Rock Nevada desert.  I think it 
cost $40 to get in but I really can't remember (it was way worth the 
money though).

Basically it's a major camping event.  You camp, you party, you dance 
all night long, you meet many new people and you'll never forget it.  
Some people go th the hot springs out there and chill out naked, or they 
simply walk around camp that way.  There are two camps, the main camp, 
and the rave camp. They are about 1 mile apart from each other because 
music plays at night long at the rave camp.

I just can't get in to details because it's overwhelming.  It is so 
excellent when the huge wooden man burns.  Everyone surrounds him in 
a gigantic circle, and the people all around are just..."trippy".  I 
loved it!  After that a big phallic looking thing gets burned, everyone 
bonds, and many drum circles are formed.  If we ever meet I can bring 
photos.  Oh, as far as the toileting situation goes, outhouses are provided
and they are very kept up.  I was sort of worried but they are kept very 
clean by someone (who knows).

I highly recommend this event to everyone. It's a must for me in 96 and 
I'd love to make plans with lots of people.  My friend I went with moved 
to Amsterdam and my normal Fresno gang probably couldn't handle it:)

The one I had at the gathering was a lot bigger tablet than I'd seen.  
Not sure if it's what your talking about, but I trust my friend and only 
buy from him.  He told me it was some kind of E that's "triple-coated."  
Anyone heard of this?  I definietly had three "peaks."

Normally I'm on the ground by about 5:30, but this time I was still 
dancing on the last song.  Wow!

It was excellent!, why can't it happen more often? I mean there seems
to be the interest in it, the only other times we get good music on
KZSU is during unknowns sets during the day- no fun for those who work.

Good afternoon all-

Well I did go after much contenplation.....
I did work earlier in the day so my energy level was way low and that
seriously effected my dancing time.  After going by the Soundfactory and the
X, me and a friend showed up at 2.30am...
It was at the Acme werehouse on Howard which seemed to be a fairly nice space
except for the extreme heat in the main room...  I didn't spend much time in
there except during Carlos's  set and Tracy at the end- hadn't heard her in a
while and I still like her hypnotic style.  Rob had a good house set that I
tried to dance to most of it.  Many rooms in this place - 4 or 5.   Very
friendly people - vibe was good and steady throughout the night.  I heard
some crisp hard beats during Tom's set but I spent most of my time in the
basement at the time of his set.  Too bad I had to dance sitting down after 5
or so- I had no more energy left.  Met Brian D. <what's up bro>  All in all a
very fun night for me.  Going back to sleep, good night ya'll.

Peace,
Austin

BioJeff if anyone is interested pls E-mail me and I'll give you the details.
There is some Progressive House and some Trance on them. There certainly
worth having in you mix tape collection.
 
I made a limited number of copies, but if you interested I'll certainly make

Dear John,

	Sounds like an idea worth discussing.  My one immediate 
reaction:  Any lawyers representing us should be forced to dress 
appropriately (i.e. whistles, baggy pants, PLUR shirts, floppy hats, 
etc.). There are definite limits to how far I think we should go in our 
quest for mainstream credibility.  :)

Much Love,

First off I wanna give a big thanks to all the DJ's (that showed:), 
friends that helped out and the listeners who have continued to support the 
show. I'm sure I'll be back at KZSU on a weekly basis some time, I just don't 
know if it will be in 3 months or 3 years.

We will do it again..... NEXT Winter Solstice :) (hopefully)
I feel bad enough asking KZSU to give a slacker like me a 24 hour chunk 
once a year, unless I started doing alot more work for the station I 
don't think it would be right to ask for more. It is also a real pain in the 
ass to get 12 (out of the 25 who said they'd play) good slacking car-less 
dj's to show up on time. But I do love doing it.

to whoever was looking for alien stuff:
    on Haight street....Wasteland has some alien long sleeved T-shirts, a
black one and a maroon one, both different designs, near the very middle of
the store.
    in Urban Outfitter...I was there a few weeks ago and they had some cool
short sleeved alien shirts by Stoopid.  in the guys section, I don't know if
they're still there but don't get the gray one because that's the one I got,
I hate seeing my clothes walking down the street on someone else.  
    Anyway, I'm not sure if this is exactly the alien stuff you were looking
for, but it's stuff I have seen

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Hey, Merry, Merry & all dat stuff. I just got back from
Philadelphia, & on the flight back I got bored and did some, #(you know).
My, my what a wonderful experience that was, I was comfortable for the
entire 6 - 7 hour, & turbulence fun, fun, definately something to try. I was
lucky, cause I got to pass up USAir's, baracued beef & beef pasta dinners(oh
boy, yum, yum).

        I felt like I needed good old Arlo Gutrie at my side, but instead of
singing about tripping on the escalators, we would have had to modify the
lyrics a little bit to, #(you know).

        Anyway, Happy Holidays, Merry X-Mas(pun intended), & Happy New Year,
I think I'm going to be doing Cyberlab dis year again, to begin again, oh my
goddess(just to be fair), am I starting a tradition; 2 years in a row, holy
Holidays Batman!!!!

I just have to ask.... how did the passengers next to you react and the
steward/esses? Or did they even notice? Did you have a window seat? Any
high altitude dehydration issues?

What an interesting concept. Next long flite I take I'll have to try.

        Try listening to the Orb's Trance remix of Pink Floyd's "Wish You
Were Here" album next time ;)  They allow walkman use in-flight, but not
during take-offs or landings.  The Fuffy White Clouds mix takes on deep new
meaning...  Peace, outtie

Subject: Parting stuff for '95 - long
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Usually at this time of year, bka year end, I try to sum up what has
happened, and make predicitions as to what will happen in the coming year.
This year has been fine, I guess, in terms of parties, and fine, I guess,
in terms of new talent developing or talent becoming better refined.

I hardly go out anymore, so my experiences are limited to what I've
actually witnessed, as well as some second hand reports here and there.  I
can say this much, '96 should prove to be a very interesting year for those
with the guts to buck the system, or any system. More on this later.

With that in mind, it is my hope that this scene become more diverse, more
gay, more bi, and more brown.  I heard that Martin's Gathering accomplished
the brown part, most certainly. I hope that the plethora of promoters here
in the bay area (most of which are white), realize that they have some part
to play in keeping this, "thing" alive, but that it cannot survive without
a people transfusion on some scale.

When I first started going out back in the day, the crowd was mixed, now
all one sees are shirtless males (mostly white) on the prowl, along with
disco dollies doing everything to avoid the passing glance.  Why the cat &
mouse boys & girls?  Where, or where, have my gay/lesbian brothers and
sisters gone that have turned our house into multiple single family
dwellings? And where is the brown?

In an area noted for it's diverse talent, it comes as a major suprise that
there are NO, African American Dj's avaialble for bookings.  That there are
no lesbian sisters who are spinning, and there are no gay brothers spinning
at these mega events.  Makes the conspiracy theories of Farrakhan seem
plausible at some level.  This is especially shoking since house music, and
all that IS house, comes from the black gay community.  A segment of our
society not only invisible to most, but completely absent at any of these
mainstream events (and we KNOW what "mainstream" means).  This will be
corrected if there is to be a house still standing in SF in '96.

There is some hope.  With the election of our great political maven, Willie
Brown, and Terry Hallinan, we have made a sharp turn left.  There is hope
that permits will be easier to obtain (both Brown & Hallinan are rabid
night owls), and the pit-bull bka the police, stop the harassment of club
owners and underground parties. The other bright light is African
American's like myself, and brotha Geoff White getting together to do our
part in making this scene more representative of it's roots.  Just call it
Flava.

Nope, it's not about exclusion, it's about including blacks, latinos,
asians, women, gay, bi, straight, and others, back into the fold that is
house.  These people have been ignored or pushed aside as I see it, and an
effort needs to be made to make this house from ALL the colors, hues, and
lifestyles the bay area has to offer.  Including everyone, excluding no
one.

You promoters need to buy a clue as well.  There are plenty people of color
who spin.  Try booking one of us!  There are plenty of gay & bi DJ's in the
area as well, try adding some of that flavor to a party!  There are also
the largest gorwing segment of the DJ population that has gone almost
unheard of for '95.  And that is the women.  You male promoters need to get
past that old sorry ass formula and book some of the ladies for your
events.  I'm sure you'd be pleasantly suprised!


JSL's 95 last shouts:
=====================

"...you don't like how I'm livin', well fuck you!" (NWA - Gangsta Gangsta):
My dear Mr. Martin O'Brian.  You have been doing this for years now and
have one of the best parties in the bay area no doubt.  I hope you continue
with your many projects, and each becomes better than the last.  I also
hope you get off yer butt and book some brown, as well as some ladies, in
the coming year.  As for your admission price, whatever.  I am not one who
thinks everyone should be able to go out on your $.  I think that you
should charge what YOU think is fair, and if people can't pay it, then
there are other parties, of less cost, that they would be able to afford.
Staying home as always been an option for me, others might learn from that
excersize as well.  I hope you never succumb to those voices who say "Open
your books!", since none of them would open their personal finances to you.
Basically, keep up the good work, pay little heed to your detractors (who
ain't known you for even a Mississippi minute), and keep up the quality
productions.  Oh yeah, did I ask you to book some brown and some ladies in
the coming year?  Much peace and success my brotha!

"...I sit alone in a four cornered room starin' at candles, thinking of the
people I've dismantled!" (Geto Boys - Mind of A Lunatic):
Wicked!  All I can say is, wow!  You guys have put on some great shows this
year.  With the absence of some of your members at various times, you guys
stepped right up to the plate and booked out of town talent.  And how brown
it was!  Between Pierre, Lil' Louie, and Roger S.  You guys had all the
bases covered this year.  I hope you guys continue booking people we would
normally not get to hear.  I look forward to '96 and seeing what envelope
you guys will push next.    Nice touch on the fans this year too!  Been
thinking about your crowd huh?  One little thing, can you please post a
sign out front that says "be courteous to others, refrain from using body
paint, or grease paint while dancing!"  Yuch!  Too many crackerjacks trying
to get cro-magnon during the sets.  Ruins many a t-shirt.  Oh yeah, one
other thing, try booking some local brown in '96.  Some lady DJ's would be
a nice touch as well.  You know where we are.

"...fuckin' around in a crap game, people think I'm soft..." (Ice Cube -
What They Hittin' Foe?):
Stompy Stomp.  Need I say more.  With the addition of Mark Farina to the
perm lineup we got to see Derrick Carter, some of the time at least.
Preston still throws a good party.  This year was kinda shaky for my man,
as his parties go.  But everyone can't have a 100% season.  The good
things?  Good music, good vibe, not too many shirtless males, and plenty of
betties, bras & all!  But you, my man, I know if Mark wasn't there you'd
still be booking same-ol, same-ol.  C'mon my brotha, I expect much more
brown from you in '96.  I know it will be tough, but book a sistah (as in
female), every now and then.  If you can have 2 trainwreckers from England
spin, then the ladies & brown def. deserve a shot!

I'm done.

I hope all of you have a wonderful new year, and that all your dreams for
96 come true.  Mine already have.

OOPS I almost fortgot:
Now with the change in the political climate here in SF, there has been no
better time than now to push the dance culture agenda.  The gridlock of
having parties in the parks or on beaches must cease.  We should be able to
gather peaceably in any location as long as it's safe and there are permits
issued.  The toughest thing is that every park official will tell you to
"Apply for a permit!" full well and knowing it will be revoked as soon as
it reaches some slobs desk.  THIS MUST CEASE, and with the change in the
helm, we have a chance to change these catch-22 procedures.  I will be
spending some time in '96 using a connection or two to see what, if
anything can be done.  Others need to get involved as well.


Much Peace,
John

I too welcome more brown, (though I didn't feel deprived of it), also 
more female dj's are welcome as well.  Personally I think there was a 
slight increase in female djs this year.  In the end for me the ethnicity 
or gender of the dj doesn't matter.  The music being played is what 
matters the most to me.  I would have some issues if I felt that certain 
genders or cultures were purposely being excluded.  I don't know if there 
was an increase or decrease in the gay population of our scene this past 
year. 
I too hope our parties will have less difficulty going off, and can be 
more free of bust worry.
I must say I am very thankfull for the increase in outdoor parties this 
past year.  It was nice to have choices of which outdoor party to go to 
during the summer.  Nice to see an increase in party promoters, and imo 
an increase in the diversity of music  this year.
I've had some amazing times this past year, and with all you music lovers 
out there 96 looks to be another year with more amazing times.
Thanks everyone for being a part, that makes it all what it is.

Peter;). it shouldn't depend on what color,gender, or sexual orientation 
she or he may be; it is what they spin *that* counts, what they give to 
the party as far as a trusting, strong vibe. If they can bring people 
together from *all* different backgrouds and colors through the music 
they create than they have given the party a positive and beautiful gift;).

> to whoever was looking for alien stuff:
( I lost the original post also )

When Christmas shopping in lovely Cupertino ( my home town ) at Vallco
Village, I found there is a new store called "Rave". It is a store
simular to Contempo or Wet Seal (love waiting in the dressing area of
that one), a total junior high school clothes store. Many, many aliens
on little tight cotton half shirts, lots of bright satin stuff, all
very low quality and price. It reminded me much of Hello Kitty,
although the darling mouthless one has much more tacht in her full
court marketing assault, the audience is simular. Let's hope rave
culture effects fashion whithout effecting pop-music as much as punk
culture did in the 80s.

 Does anyone here use TIA instead of SLIP or PPP ? I'm curious about trying
it out - I have a shell account with NETCOM - they don't offer SLIP or PPP
anymore , and have a proprietory Web browser that only works on IBM PC
compatibles. I have a Mac.

Well, kids I was going to throw a rave on March 16th. My so called 
partner who had a line up of investors backed out yesterday. This is 
really a sucky deal. I think he is going to have a club in SF. We were 
supposed to use the spot for the rave but I guess he just decided to 
#@$$#@ the money on something else. 
    Now, I'm not a negative and am sorry if I have sent some -vibes but 
I'm think + now. Well, the rave if I can get investors will be totally 
Alienized. I don't want to give too much of it away but it should be 
cool if it works. I think he is going to throw his own rave. I just 
hope he doesn't use any of my ideas.
    Anyway if any of you know of a building, investors, equip., 
anything please let me know. I heard that the Gatherings last spot was 
pretty cool. My friend, Sausee, said it is a good spot. Keep the Peace, 
stay +.

Peace

It's not a matter of trying to impose a quota or something.  But if there
are black DJ's in the area, why are they not getting any air time?  Fact
is, even in our scene, things can be a bit backward.  And it does matter,
if that is truly the case.

It matters if there is an all anything party in the most diverse of cities.
It matters if female DJ's don't get to play because of people myopia
concerning the role of women in our scene.  It matters if there are DJ's of
color who are conspicuously absent from all but a very, very, few events.
And in the end, it is reflected in the crowd.  Gay DJ's, Black DJ's,
Lesbian Dj's, Women DJ's, not only bring a different flavor to a party,
they bring thier friends!  So YES, it definitely makes a difference, IMO,
who spins and where.  Yes, my brothers and sisters, it is about the music
and that is one of the more important elemnts, but without the people there
would be nothing.  Music or not!

One would be hard pressed to deny that the majority of parties thrown these
days are primarily het. events.   One would also have a tough time denying
the fact that events have gotten a bit more homogenous over the years.
With some spikes here and there for sure.  Why?  Could it be, as someone
said to me, "Natural Segregation"?  I doubt it.  The energy has changed
from a pan-sexual one to a het. one.  From an all kinds vibe to a, some
would argue, "souless" one.  Now, I do not blame the DJ's, they do what
they do for people who like what they do.  But I guarantee that if you were
to put a Foxy Brown in the house to spin some, that my gay brothers would
come out of the woodwork to dance.  To put a Nikki Rivera up would get the
lesbian sisters out to groove as well.  So I have a difficult time buying
into anything that erases our differences for communal dancing.  Hell, we
should never erase our differences, we should revel in them...TOGETHER.
Promoters have alot to do with this transformation, and they can do alot by
booking gay/lesbian/female/people of color at their events.  We've already
seen what the absence of such DJ's has yeilded.

Like I said, this was not always true, it was a bit more diverse back in
the day than it is now.  I hope to bring some of that back, WIHTOUT putting
ANYONE on the backburner.

96 to me means Bringing The House Together.


Diversity Is House, and our house music.

Much peace and thanks for the comments,
John

P.S.  Yes, I am doing something about it.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Some friendly advice, a general biz-ness rule, start small, raves
must be promoted at least 30 days in advance; for the entire 30 days, build
a following, & let word of mouth do your selling for you. I know lots of
investors, but I would never risk my name, on an unknown, trying to throw a
large party, until they have demostrated at least an average track record.

        Nature of the biz, lots o scams, lots o rip offs, lots o people take
the money & run, everyone has seen this on our scene. Also try doing a party
with one of the more well established promoters & make sure your name is on
the lit. This will give you some credability.

        I've seen totally fat raves the could have been large money makers
for all involved, fall flat, bankrupt & in serious debt. This one comes to
mind, they had everything in this roller rink in Florida, rides, good name
regonized DJ's, a great sound system, dual projectors, a fantasic totally
professional computer controled lighting system. 30 people showed up, I had
fun, but then again I was working the event.

        What went wrong, they didn't promote the event until a week before
it went off, and it was done by people who really did know what they were
doing. So you can have everything perfect & still have it fall flat, be
careful, and start small.

asking gay/lesbian/black/girl/boy/etc. to play simply because of these 
attributes is sounding like affirmitive action...their energy and 
openness, their attitude and their values are more important in the long run.

They just updated the message at Pacific, sometime between 5 and 7pm
today (Wed.) saying tickets are $20 at Ameba. Some people are not
communcating with each other!

I was for sure into this Begin Again thing, but now I'm wondering if
that trance party that illumin8 mentioned would be better. I love
trance! Does anyone know a info number, or should I just call F-8?

Hmmm, I spoke to Mark @ Ameba this afternoon and he said they had tickets
and were selling them...

$20 each, though. Ouch.

Personally, I think $20 is too much for a party, even if it is by Pacific.

Last year, I am pretty sure Begin Again was $15 or maybe less...and 
because of the participation of many folks, including Cyberlab and the 
New Moon, it was a beautiful party.

A lot of work and planning went into the one last year and it was sooo 
wonderful!  I'm afraid to go because nothing could surpass that magical 
night.  

Mooning over the past,

Ann

Well, as for it being $20, it IS new years.  Good luck finding anything for
less.
If you do let me know.

I called ameba today and asked if they had any tickets for sale.  They said
they did.

Hello out there.

Well I had a rootin' tootin' time @ a new "spot" that popped up on the Haight
called Mos Isley Spaceport.

Cool sounds and not the clubby feel I get from the other Techno weeklies.
Some serious trance from the resident dj's Solar,MARS,Jon Howard,Myster-E.  
Im not one to praise clubs but there was a nice lil' vibe.

So, if yer bored on a Tuesday, and gots nuthin 2 du, check out the most
villianous Spaceport: Mos Isley...

C-ya there,

Even as the unintentional instigator of the "$25 is too much for The 
Gathering" flame-fest, I really must take issue with your statement Ann. 
Pacific of all crews, has been out there week after week during the past 
couple of summers, providing totally free/donation parties. If any one 
group has been showing their love and commitment to the scene it is 
Pacific. If any one group is deserving of support, it is Pacific. Now if 
we can only track down those elusive tickets....

sound system, the full light show, water, alter, chill room, ect.  

Don't you think it's better to pay $25 + to get a memorable evening vs. a 
cheap one that was only margional.  Especially for NYE.  I would pay $100 
for the ultimate rave, with lasers out of Babalon5, just unbelevibly 
bright purple, perhaps huge plasma globes, ear plugs included at the 
door, a sound system that could be felt, strobes, smoke machines, 
bubbles, lighting bolts, whatever it takes.  It would be a machine 
capable of punishing your senses and causing disoriantion.  You want a 
enviroment that takes you half way to the trance.  Money talks.

I want to chime in with pretty much full agreement with jslee's assessment
of the current SF scene.  But it's not enough simply to bring in more
non-white-male DJs into the big events -- that's a project that always
has value because there's always been a need.  Remember, even in the thick
of things in 1992 enough women got pissed off at the way things were
working that they put together Your Sisters House, which stands to me as
the example of how to do things differently and meet different objectives
than simply packing as many people into a warehouse or club as you can
and still have most everyone have a good time.  

I think in retrospect that the 1991-93 period in SF was unusual in the
temporary interaction of the club and underground scenes, which have
gradually gone their separate ways since then.  The reasons for that
unique crossover were musical, social, economic and even political in
nature, I think.  In reflecting on John's observations of who's doing
what and the general attitude out there, I think what we
have seen is a relapse into a bit of cultural conservatism (of our
own type, and I don't disinclude net.ravers from that analysis).  

The fact of the matter, if you check the gay/lesbian and African-American
oriented publications in town (and they are readily available), is that
there are quite a few non-white-male-type-people out there playing records
and CDs for the public.  In fact, quite a few of them play house and some
techno, although tastes vary, obviously, by DJ and by crowd.  The same
as we wouldn't want our scene known only because well known "flyer names"
like the Wicked crew spin what they do -- as much as I like their approach
we have lots more to choose from -- the other "sub-scenes" would also like
to be known as having more than just the few major known names we might
have heard of in passing.  I mean, just who do you think buys all those
records at BPM, Soundworks, Tweakin and even Star Alley?  It's not just
the traditional "underground rave" DJs, that
's for sure, and it's not just "collectors."  

I think we need something like a neo-speakeasy movement, where DJs of
all kinds get together "after peak hours" to spin stuff for each other's
enjoyment and that of a reasonable number of people, and outside the
usual set of venues.  That would be ideal in my world.  Other than the
venue sense, the last time I've had that kind of feeling (other than
F&F, which is in its own category entirely) is the last couple months
of Boogie Buffet, and that's two years ago now.  

Sorry about the nostalgia, folks.  Given where things could have gone
starting a couple years ago -- hell, given how they *have* gone in
many places -- the SF scene is really still good.  It's just that you
have to hop across the little cultural divides that have started to
grow up among the music subscenes like weeds, to get it.

No big schemes or global fix-its here from me, anyway, just some
semi-meanderings . . .

Yeah, I'll rarely part with $20 nowadays for a party, but as far as NYE 
celebrations go (including all the non-rave events), $20 is definitely at 
the low end of what you could spend in the City. I have a couple friends 
trying to find a hotel ballroom party that won't cost them half their 
January rent. Some of the prices they found (one hotel was $150 per 
couple) would make me want to stay home and watch Dick Clark. A few of 
them included dinner, but most offered little more than a complimentary 
glass of champagne.

Well, I can see you don't understand affirmative action to well, or it's
purpose.  What you're talking about is a quota system, and I am against
that.  AA, of course, I am completely for!  So maybe that's where we
differ.  Hell, if people aren't comfortable hiring gay Dj's, then I'll hire
them.  If people are so worried about mixing it up with people from other
spheres, then I invite those from those shperes to party with me.  Yes, it
is affirmative action.  There are plenty of promoters, like in life, who
hire those people they are most comfortable with.  And the seperation of
the houses in SF is proof of this.  The old boys club that is rampant in
this city is proof as well of AA for male DJ's only.  So why be afraid if a
black male stands up and says that the forms of AA that are present in our
scene now really suck and are quite exclusionary.  Why use the term AA to
try to score political points in an attempt to undermine what I see as a
real tragedy with our scene; the division of people into their own cliques.
Is this really where you want to be?  If so fine, continue to support the
parties you like, I will continue to support those people who are about a
bigger picture, and not about a niche or genre or a spoecific group of
people.

No, I will not allow your misunderstanding of AA to cloud my true intent,
and that is to mix it up.

I agree with the second part of the statement however, and that is one
crucial element.  But to say that the vibe here hasn't changed since things
have segregated is to ignore what went on in 91-92, when the lines were not
so clearly drawn housewise.

BTW - When someone hires someone because they are comfortable with them,
that's AA.  When someone tells you about a DJ and you hire them, thats AA
too.  It's much more than a slogan or acronym, it's how America has done
business for well over 400 years.  Just ask the Getty's, DuPont's,
Vanderbilts, Ford's, etc. All of whom had wonderful AA programs to ensure
thier place in America's history.  So be care ful when you go around
insinuating that there is something wrong with AA.  When used to create a
representation of society as a whole, it is a beautiful thing.  When it is
used to further seperation, tribal rubiish, and social cliques, it becomes
nothing more than veiled apartheit.

Late.

Is there any reason why the Wicked crew couldn't just set up their
soundsystem out in the desert during labor day weekend?? Do we really
need the rest of the burning man organization?? Instead, why not ride
on their coattails and have a "burning rave" out in the desert without
all the B.M. brouhaha??

I personally can create my own virtual burning man in my head after
having my mind blown by wicked. No need for fire when you're swimming
in liquid sound!

Before we get into how much it's going to cost , and people "citing" how
much it's going to cost, let's be very clear:  NYE is nothing more than a
reason for everyone to ask for very large sums of cashish!  Ain't America
grand!

>From the rental of sound to the steel whell drivers (DJ's), everyone gets
paid during new years eve parties.  Entrance fees have ranged from $20
(very, very, very low by  my estimates), to upwards of $100+ (suit and ties
recommended).  In our scene the highest prices I've seen was New Years '92
Toon Town with a fee of $35 to get in!  Yikes!

Oh, but try to rent sound from any place that does sound, and you will find
the fees run 2-3 times greater than normal.  DJ's usually charge a premium
(those who can command it), as well as everyone else down the food chain.
There's no way around it, new years eve is all about gankin', jackin', &
steady mobbin' for duckets.  It's money time in the big city!

Guest passes will be hard to find for those not very well connected.  DJ's
will be offered rides from all kinds of people in the hopes of avoiding the
stiff entrance fee, ego's will be out of control, people will be crying
over how expensive exotic substances will be for this one night of bliss,
women will have plenty of escorts so the booty & bra factor should be high,
there will be more suits than you've ever seen at a party (no matter how
"underground" your stuff might be), and people should be going ballistic,
seeing aliens, religious visions, positive vibes and all.  Yes, it will be
like old sodom with a twist.

But let's not forget why there will be new years parties at all: $, $$, and
more $$$$'s, cuz' in SF, that's what new years is all about!

So when you're takin' out that last 60.00 from that ATM, remember, at least
you're not alone in the suffering.  You got friends around you to re-define
the moment.  Take solace in that thought, and have a good time.  Oh yeah,
be careful, there should be plenty of cops out this year busting one and
all who either ask or answer the question:"You want some E?".

be safe.

don't know if this is helpful clarification or not, but i just heard
from the planet dog publicist that the new moon was cancelled at the

what this also means is that the january 4th appearance of eat static

Well, it seems that the best way for some excluded group to get noticed,
and then included, is for them to go out and make it happen.  Look what 
happened with the trance enthusiasts.  Folks like Ethan and Frequency8 
started throwing their own parties, established followings and a vibe that
couldn't be ignored, and now some of these DJs are getting invited to
the bigger parties, bringing along the people who are attracted to that
flavor of energy.  So go for it John!  Hopefully there will be enough
people who want the flavor you're promoting to make it thrive and
prove itself viable enough to be tapped by more mainstream promoters.

Speaking of parties with diversity: Preston (Boogie Buffet, Stompy,
Groove Kitchen) is throwing a New Year's Day party at 1015 Folsom
that just might offer the best vibe of any this weekend.  Anyone
remember the NY DAY Boogie Buffet party he threw at the same location 
2 years ago?  It was totally sick!

Anyway, NYEve events can sometimes be disappointing - too many people
out partying just because they're supposed to; an obligation imposed by 
a calender that is very out of sync with nature.  Nevertheless, I
look forward to dancing with you all, wherever you are.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Much Praise & Salutations to the very teeny tiny one cell creatures
that do business on the Haight for a vunderful party last night, that packed
two floors at 1015 Folsum, hats off to DJ Tracy, Mark, Allen ...etc

        Everyone had a great time, including myself; though the music could
have been a little faster, and a little more psychoactive for my particular
dancing tastes, but then, what can you say about "something you live in";
someone say House.  Oh, with the exception of these two womyn who purchased,
guess what, Niacin while looking for #(you know), be careful out there folks.
                                
        Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like House, there's just
so much of it out there, here, everywhere & any thang below 140 bpm, HURTS
MY BODY TO MOVE SOOOOO SLOW. More Techno & Gabber/Goa/Cyber..etc Trance in
1996, lets make 96 be the year for Trance in SF, here here!!!!

        As far as the upstairs went, I really can't comment except with the
following exceptions. It was packed, but I don't think you can call what
they were spinning up there Jungle. In fact it seemed kinda slower than the
downstairs House, diverse, & fragmented, but regardless, the people were
definately having a good time dancing to whatever it was.

        It was fun, as it is always, seeing SF finest DJ's; like Carlos,
just out having fun, and listening to their friends spin.

        I got to meet some new Web Browser Ravers/lurkers out there like
Heather, & Zoe Hiya = >!!!! Some old friends I hadn't seen in a while, which
is always cool, like Geoff White. Our always welcome indigenous British
Nationals were out in force lastnight, adding a slight accent to a night of
bloody good fun, like Neil & Rebecca. Just when you thought it was safe to
post again, guess what, Tristan's back. I actually didn't see him at Black
Diamond but at C^3'ed party, but all the same it's good to havem back, at
least I think so. I'm actually suprised he hasn't posted yet, hope he not
getting shy on us : >.

        I got to meet Polywog & her sister; Hiya!!!, she traded me a tape
for #(you know), dat was cool. I haven't listened to it yet, the only place
I have a cassette deck is in my friends car, so it will have to wait until then.

        Oh, while I was at C^3 party last week, I met this cartoon artist
womyn, who I traded  a #(you know), for some of her work. The work was
entitled "Ideas How To Save The World Today." I wish you could see the work,
it's really cool stuff, but it's her ideas that really peaked my interest.
Some of them are; A new consumer system where you got things you needed for
free; like food & stuff, but you had to pay for everything that you threw
away. On the ever increasing population problem she proposed that more
people should become homosexual, making more room for wildlife, & it would
also help solve the issue of parentless children in adoption facilities. 

        Hiya Betsy, from C^3, didn't think I would remember you, huh!!!!!

        I really start feeling like a World Citizen when I get to meet sooo
many people from different cultures, places of origin, & back grounds at a
rave, all there to do the same thang, celabrating life together.

        Well anyway my ? is, did anyone go to Simply Done, if so, how wuz
it. Wedesdays are cool, and it looks like Tuesday's are looking up these
days with dat new weekly, well at least from a Trance perspective.

     I had a brief conversation with someone about this just yesterday.  
     And while I still feel that we should create parties in the wilderness 
     DIY style, there has to be an element of responsibility.  
     Responsibility to our environment, and within the boundaries of laws 
     (natural and government) to take care of ourselves.
     
     Now I know this is going to gank some "old-timers" who were into the 
     scene when renegades were the thing.  And I have to admit that I 
     wasn't part of the scene then, nor do I feel that renegades should go 
     away.  But if we want to grow in vibe and in numbers, gain respect, 
     and avoid hassles for what we believe in, then there has to be a part 
     of the scene that takes care of business and shows responsibility.  
     And I define responsibility as accountability, reliability, and 
     trustworthiness.
     
     Why reinvent the wheel when it's already in place?  Sure we can just 
     go out into the desert and make things happen, but any _responsible_ 
     promoter would ensure measures for care and safety of not only his 
     crew but for those in attendance.  This includes first aid, transport 
     to medical facilities, coordination and pay to the Bureau of Land 
     Management and local law enforcement agencies, adequate water supply, 
     chemical pit toilets, trash disposal, liability insurance, etc.  The 
     BM crew has thought this all out and has well established ties w/the 
     proper sources.  They've worked hard to make things run as smooth as 
     possible _and_ they've opened their arms to allow the rave camp to 
     co-exist and benefit from all their hard work.
     
     Now I've participated in enough parties and helped break down/clean-up 
     some to know we're not the cleanest, neatest bunch all the time.  And 
     some people are just out there to go off and don't know what they're 
     getting into until they're freaking out or getting their stomach 
     pumped.  When you open a party up, you need to look at your purpose, 
     audience, and scope and hopefully cover all the bases _if_ you want to 
     have a good rep. and a repeat performance.
     
     Perhaps I'm too idealistic and have my own vision of growth for the 
     scene and that's because my background has been to throw legit 
     smoke-free, alcohol-free dance parties.  But I do hope that some of 
     what I say above is taken into consideration when planning, promoting, 
     and best of all, enjoying the fruits of your labor.
     
     Just a mom at heart,
     Diane :)

Is there any reason why the Wicked crew couldn't just set up their 
soundsystem out in the desert during labor day weekend?? Do we really 
need the rest of the burning man organization?? Instead, why not ride 
on their coattails and have a "burning rave" out in the desert without 
all the B.M. brouhaha??
     
I personally can create my own virtual burning man in my head after 
having my mind blown by wicked. No need for fire when you're swimming 
in liquid sound!

showed up at DV8, Jullian Lennon, oh my god, & then he ended up at, you'll

from DV8. Is this trash or what, but it's a fact cause I saw it with me own
eyes, and then asked the cute bar person if it was really him, and it was.
See what you miss when you stay home during the week & who said clubs were

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!! Brian, you're the winner!  I always forget about that 
term until one of my friends brings it up, that is Amatuer Night (bka 
NYE)!  You are spot on my man with that assertion!  Amatuer Night it 
certainly will be!

I dunno about them posting anything or a requirement to do so.  They are 
susually quite random and the press is never privvy to them, other than 
saying "There will be checkpoints tonite."

I would be much more concerned with what's goin on in the clubs.  New 
Years is bust night for plenty of cops and undercover types tho.  But it 
is also good to keep your eyes peeled if you HAVE to drive while under 
the love pill or other substances.

Peace,
John

Wrong, wrong, and er, wrong,.  You should look it up, better yet read 
what AA actually is and then we can have a discussion.  Affirmative 
Action and it ghoals are quite clear.  Integration of the workplace.  It 
is NOT a quota system.  Please read executive order 11246, and we can 
have a discussion.  You might also want to read the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, and we can have a discussion.

Affirmative Action goals are a concious and deliberate effort to bring 
qualified people of color and women into jobs and educational 
opproitunities from which they had been traditionally excluded.  So with 
that your argument that AA does not consider qualifications is false (too 
much Newt?).

I will not respond to the rest of your argument since it is based upon 
the false premise that AA does not consider qualifications, when in fact, 
it's charter is to put qualified women and people of color into positions 
that they had been excluded from  historically.

As for AA for 400 years: , dig this:

White men are 33% of the population , yet
85% of tenured professors
85% of partners of major law firms
80% of the US house of representatives
90% of the US sentate
95% of the fortune 500 ceo's
97% of school superintendents
99.9% of professional athletic team owners
100% of US presidents

But, by your logic, these people must have all been qualified for the 
jobs & positions they hold?  Gimme a break.

Nope, AA is needed alright as long as the numbers above are true.


Sorry.  Please read the publications I stated previously for a start, and 
we can have an intelligent discussion.  I don't engage in soundbite 
battles of either the left or right.

Peace,
John

I do not pretend to lecture, maybe you should stop pretending to 
understand a topic you have done little reading on.  The fact that women 
in this country are paid 71 cents on the dollar of white men means that 
AA is still needed.  The fact that the slaries of blacks in 1971 were 57% 
that of whites, and in 1991 it shifted to 56% is further proof.

I would suggest that before you even attempt debate in this area you read 
and UNDERSTAND The 1990 census, maybe browse the Glass Ceiling Report of 
1995,  the report issued by the US General Accounting Office of this 
year, as well as reports by the US Commission on Civil Rights, papers by 
the Peter Y. Harris research Group, the Congressional research Service, 
and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.

No, I'm afraid that I'm well armed with facts in this area, obviously 
moreso than you.  When you get done with that light reading, and do some 
absorbtion, we can talk.  Until then sir....later.

Out, John :)

        Yes, in another life, when I used to be a waiter(I've done worst),
that's how most resturant people refered to New Years Eve, as Amatuer Night.

I love debunking people's shit:

1776 - The right to vote is reserved for WHITE males only.
1820 - Proprty rights are set aside for white men exclusively.
1862 - We drive the Indians (Native (REAL) Americans), off their lands 
giving homesteads away to white settlers.
1900 - Faculty at most all Universities are white males.
1960 - Construction and other work once thought the domain of men, is 
challenged via the womens movement.
1995 - Affirmative Action for women and minorities?  That's UNAmerican!

Give me a break.  I think you need a clear sense of history.  And if you 
think that just one generation is enough to undo over 15 generations of 
dmamge, you had better go back to school and get a basic understanding of 
physics (conservation of energy).

History; Learn from it, or die re-living it!

Peace,
John

Help me, I'm green (enviro, and new to the rave scene). what's
begin again all about? I know the music will be good, but
what about venue, size, vibe, etc.? I'm thinking what to do
for new years and figure if this is it, I'll have to get tickets
now. What about Illumin8?

Exactly, and the above reasons are why I was more than happy to fork over 
$40 to BM for a ticket at the gate.  Hell, I would have thrown at lest 
that much in if it was donation only.

The BM crew does an incredible job of taking care of a few thousand 
people in a hostile environment, and this is due, I suspect, to quite a 
bit of experience.  If Wicked, or anyone else for that matter, tried to 
throw a rave in Black Rock simmilar to what happened this year without 
the support structure built by BM, I would fear the worst.  I must admit 
I wasn't one of the people who spent the next week after the event 
picking up trash, but I seriously doubt that enough people in this scene 
would be dedicated enough to do such a good job of cleaning up after 
themselves.  Cleaning up your own mess is one thing, but scouring the 
desert for the refuse from thousands of people is an amazing venture.

Also, BM goes out of it's way to inform people of the hazards and dangers 
involved in this venture, and has a very effective network for spreading 
this information to participants.  Would a Black Rock Rave '96 do this?  
Most "ravers" I know spent a sum total of an hour, maybe, planning for an 
event before they go, and I think having the rave part of burning man as 
a secondary focus cut down on those people who whould be horribly 
underprepared for this event.

But isn't it also true that during the course of human history
ecstatic trance-inducing tribal dancing has been more prevelant
amongst non-western cultures?  If so, then perhaps raving can
be viewed as a form of cultural Affirmitave Action for vibe-deprived 
white males.  ;)

When they opened for Praxis, Mixmaster Mike played with them too. This is
not to be missed if you are at all interested in the ways of the mixer and
turntables; they are a "band" of DJs (8 turntables) who play different parts
of "songs" together: one may play hi hat and bass drum, one snare, one
dropins, and one vocals. It's amazing shit.

Hey y'all,

Rumors are true. Eat Static has been cancelled, primarily due to some
promoter from LA. Seems like the same guy screwed them over once before. He
was supposed to fly them out for the New Years desert thing, but pulled out
for unknown reasons. 

They might be out here in the spring as part of their tour. When we know
what's what's up, we'll pass it along.

later...

Subject: Begin again @ Trance In/Out's
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Does anyone know what the in/out policy is going to be at both Begin Again
and the Trance pary new years eve?

Last year I had Begin again tickets but was also suppose to meet up with
friends at the 938 Harrison bash. I was horror stricken :( when they informed
me there would be NO ins and outs at Begin Again!! I had planned on kind of
bouncing back and forth between the two parties as they were not too many
blocks apart. Instead I had to leave Begin again between 1 and 2 to make it
over to 938 harrison to meet friends. 

I understand the motivation behind no ins and outs in underground spaces but
I sure would like to know _ahead of time_. I would like to attend both events
new years eve and it sounds like they both will be happening in downtown SF.

I'm hoping at least one of the parties will not have this restriction.
Anybody know the in/out policies of these parties?

peace,
martin

Tribal Funk got busted early last night at about 11:00 and the police looked like they were training some new cops for New Years

Can't hold tickets for Begin Again, the sheer #s of requests for that service have been exceedingly large.

Allen and Andrew will be at Begin Again and Tracy and Mark will be at the Santa Cruz freebee   but I tell you this....

                       I'd rather be in Goa........ not.

To everyone in the void,

>From our last post it seems that everyone got the impresion that the NYE
party is being thrown by F-8. It is actually a collective effort, and we
only posted it. 

We want to be very low key, so the party being limited to a couple hundred
adventurers. With the Po Po's being out in force on New Years, perhaps you
can understand.

A friend says the moon's in Aires now, and will move into Taurus on sunday
night, which indicates good times for all. 

Regardless of which party you go to, keep in mind that Johnny Law is still
being uptight about our gatherings. Low key's the place to be. 

Peace - Love & Trance

This isn't really rave-related, but this is going to be a really good
party on NYE, and the "tapes until dawn" part is actually going to be
me and Bryce.  We'll feed 'em some house'n'techno if we can possibly
manage it :-)

So if you have any affinity for the Dead scene, this promises to be
a memorable time.  

It's being put together by my friend Michael Fasman (mlf@well.sf.ca.us),
actually starting well before the official announcement that the Dead
are retiring, so it's a bit of a last hurrah for those of us who've
been doing that for all this time.  I'm certainly looking forward to it!

If you have any additional questions about the party, please email me.
I haven't seen the location yet but I gather it's a really nice theatre
at the Jewish community center in San Rafael.

I'm also hoping to see lots of y'all at 1015 Folsom on New Year's day too!

peace
phred

>From my (admittedly brief) dealings with Larry Harvey and the rest of
the core crew (I was there for a week before the event this year):

They were about to stop because they had lost money for too long.  I heard
something like "The credit cards are all maxed out.  If we lose money this
year there might not be another."

Of course, they might just be exhausted from riding the death pony for too
long.  Damn, but that's a lot of work, and I didn't see those folks really
enjoying themselves -- mostly a lot of wandering around with CB headsets
on trying to keep people from injuring themselves or others.  I wonder at
what point people might ask themselves "So why _am_ I doing this?... Fuck it."

Will Wicked provide their own porta-potties, or will they just sponge off
of the BM project's?  Or will people just crap on the playa?  Will Wicked
deal with the BLM and Nevada police?  Will they do liaison and fundraisers
for the town of Gerlach to keep the goodwill of the locals, or will they
just sponge off the hard work done by others?  Will they spend the time
necessary to leave the playa as they found it afterward?  (Took the BM
people nearly a week.)

Much more goes into creating the BM community on the playa than any
renegade I've seen.  I think having a separate rave out there sometime
could be really cool (anyone remember Pete Ashdown's Salt Lake events?)
but leeching off BM is not the right way to do it.  Either be part of BM,
and take that responsibility, or do it separately in time and space and
take that responsibility.

It's too bad that you feel that way, Neils; it brings it home to me that
the ritual of the Man isn't what it once was.  Damn.

Yea,  well I'm not surprised.  It's been assumed for a very long time that
the pigs are probably monitoring the list.   Which is why it's important to
keep announcements of underground partys off the list,  and only via Email.

Who knows,  it might even come to the possibility of us using PGP.   But I
assume people use that for privacy anyway.

In fact,  I remember thats how I got involved in the SFRaves list in the
first place,  as I was really pumped about the ideas of using encryption,
but unknown to me,  PGP had already been discussed at length long before
joined the list.    I met Geoff White at the Cypherpunk meeting and thanks
to Geoff,  I discovered the SFRaves list.   Just a tad bit of history...

You know, you've been using the term "the pigs" for quite some time on SF
Raves to describe law enforcement, and I resent it.

My father is a retired (25 year duty) police officer, and even though I am
a raver and I imbibe in 'illegal' substances and attend 'illegal' parties,
that does not placate my simple respect for people that put their lives on
the line daily. This also does not mean that I 'side' with the police on
any occasion, either.

We, the underground music community, may often have differing opinions
about parties, etc. from the law enforcement community, but that is no
excuse to not give them simple respect that they deserve, no necessarily as
police officers, but as humans -- this mutual respect is often what we
expect (and deserve) from them in return.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Ok, people, there's a time to pick daisies, a time to love & a time
to FIGHT. The  Soviet KGB for years sucessfully used a tactic called
Disinformation in an attemt to combat the CIA's attemts to spy on them, &
vice a verse a.

        Disinformation is basically carefully & well thought out constucted
lies, or false information the vaguely resembles the truth or true
intentions. This is information is basically a trap, that would lead the
spying party away or indicate a direction that has no true meaning, it is a
favorite & sucessfull tactic I've adopted over the years. Hmmm, maybe
working for mil. all those years is going to pay off after all.

        Digital Disinformation is basically the same thing only in a digital
format. So I'm proposing the people start thinging about either how we can
incorporate this methologogy/tactic on our list, while minimizing incidentes
that the ocasional raver will also fall for the trap. That can simply  be
combated by useing more & more map points, as well as fun false word of
mouth nights where a few of us take the cops for a ride. Because even with
map points all it takes  is a cop in an unmarked car to follow one of us to
the eventual location of the party and then bust it.

        We all know how cops hate waisting their time, being setup, and
following false leads. Keep in mind they use this tactic as well to confuse,
and create mistrust among the ranks of the lawless; in the eyes of our gov.

--------------------

I broke down and rented a continental...|8-0!) so I guess I'm in a
position to offer a ride... where is this thing going to be,
anyway?  I called and they said it was "10 minutes from the city",
but the last I heard it was no more specific than that... I'm in
the eastern half of SF, drop a note if you're needing a ride, I'm
not positive I can accommodate, but if we're going around the same
time, etc., I'm sure something can work out... I'm going to take a
nap for a while, but call or write if you want to hook up, I'll check
email and voice messages before I leave...

My father is also in law enforcement. I don't consider him a "pig." But 
then again I know him as an individual. 

What's my point?

Behind the guns and badges, there is a *HUMAN BEING* Yes, too many of 
them are on small-dick power trips(uuhhh I rhymed), but there are some 
out there that are real people. How would you feel having to deal with 
murders, rapists, child-molesters and slews of other agitated, unhappy, 
apathetic people every day? From what I have heard it really can make a 
person jaded, and make it difficult to see the good in people when all 
you are dealing with is the shit.

yes, they are human being, and you're probably right that there are
some that are real people.  Unfortunately, 1 bad cop on a "small-dick
power trip" makes a heavier impression than the 20 decent cops who work
along side the bad one.  The fact is, most people don't have what it
takes to be a good cop, and from all appearances, most of those cops
on small-dick power trips probably need to get employed elsewhere,
because policing is too important, requires too much responsibility
for it too be taken lightly.  Cops need to walk a *finer* line than
the rest of us because of the responsibility invested in them; if that's
too much for you don't become a cop, because the only kind of cops we
need are the ones who can truly handle the job, not pigs on power
trips.  I've met some really cool cops, don't get me wrong.  A cool
cop is a real cool thing indeed.  But I've met too many pigs on 
power trips for my satisfaction and it needs to be changed.  We may
have the opportunity to see that in SF with Hallinan as DA, as he's
been in favor of greater police accountability before, we shall see.

I totally agree. Power corrupts, absolute power...

For antecdotal purposes: My friends brother, a stocky third degree BB in 
Kempo, with BB's in two other styles and just a very level, personable guy, 
had his application turned down for Fairfield PD because they did not feel 
that he would be "aggresive" enough. This suggests to me that it is not 
only the police themselves that need to be evaluated, but the hiring 
procedures, the people doing the hiring, and what traits are viewed as 
"desirable."    

I also agree with Wayne's statement. Calling all cops pigs is 
tantamount to calling all[insert racial/religious/sexual group] [insert 
expletive here.] If someone were to do that here, people would be 
(rightfully) all over your ass. 

I hope we all see some positve results of the recent elections. I guess 
one has occured already.... Bye bye Ribera.... ;)

I'm sorry you feel that way...  perhaps my opinion might change over time
if they would get their little pig snouts out of my face.   I'm Still getting
searched and harrassed even when walking around.   While walking into town,
one gung ho officer threw me against his car,  removed my "bum bag" and
emptied it on the parking lot,  right in front of my clients store.  It's
taken me over 2 months,  but I FINALLY won over this client (Actually
did that this afternoon - Yay!) and re-established my credibility.

Being that I don't celebrate christmas anymore so than any other day, I 
usually work and get that time and a half money.  On christmas day I was 
working on the intensive locked unit of the psychiatric hospitol that I 
work at.  Being short staffed that day, my girlfriend angela (who also 
loves to rave) was asked to work overtime onto my shift.  This was the 
first time we were working the same shift together on the same unit. :)

One of the younger patients told me she was bored, and said to me "your 
my staff person entertain me."  I told her I wasn't there to really 
entertain her but maybe we could entertain each other with some dance 
music. From there I got out the boombox put it in the middle of the unit 
and popped in a garth tape.

It wasn't long before angela and I had about 90% of the unit dancing.  We 
even got a  patient from the unit next door to come over and dance.  It 
was great to see the over weight 55 year old charge nurse come over and 
dance, saying she hadn't danced in years, and that she should do this 
more often.  It was GREAT!  At one point we all naturally formed a circle 
and dance and the vibe was just about as thick as any rave I've been to.  I 
had a huge smile on my face as I thought to myself I'm raving at work.

Unfortunately I wouldn't feel comfortable having this rave thing at work 
on any day in front of some of the staff I work with, as i think they 
might frown apon it.  But this day was great, it was nice to see the 
patients transcend their problems for a while and enjoy life for a 
while.  The dancing in the beginning of the shift  created enough 
positive energy to carry throughout the evening and helped make christmas 
more enjoyable for all.

happy new year

:)

So, you've read the posts, and have decided to go to one of tha various
parties to ring in the new year.  Are you really, and I mean really ready?

Check my little prep. list to see whther this will be an amatuer night for
you, or whther you're a party professional:

-Got your wallet?  Good.  Have $40 for the entrance fee (prices all of a
sudden go up when you buy tix at the door.  SF Party Code 104).  Along with
your money, don't wimp out this year.  If they can ask for 20 or more
dollars, you are within your rights to ask for guest list.  It's easy once
you know how.  Insist that you're one of the people who handed out flyers
for the organization and demand that they pay you back by alowwing you, and
you 15 friends in for free.  Hell, you can never go to far, besides, don't
start '96 out like a newbie, approach the guest list with confidence, and
get yours!

-Have you made all the right connections before the show?  The worse thing
you can do tonite is ask one person after another, if they have been
connected.  Who knows who or what you might bump into.  Johnny Law will be
in full effect, and I'm sure he would be very interested in helping make
some new connections.  Right in city jail.

-Sobriety check points?  Get a clue, they put these things on the streets,
not the highways.

-My brain hurts, where can I get a head cool down?  Why, either at Boogie
Stompy Super Deluxe Prime-Time Crackerjack New Years Mroning Cafe, or the
End-Up if you ain't done tweekin'.  Better get there really early, cuz that
place will fill up with the deniznes of the night real quick.  If all goes
according to plan, there should be plenty of banality for all.  I should be
fairly out of it by 8:00 A.M.  Aftr that nice warm shower in the morning
I'll need some beer and Jaeger to coll down properly.

-ATM card ready?  After you've bought the first 10 rounds, it'll be time
for you to buy some more, c'mon, you got a job, unlike some of your
friends.  Spread the joy!  Oh yeah, are you connected?  Cool, lemme have
one and I'll gladly pay you tuesday....

-Please wear SUNGLASSES.  There is nothing more scary than looking at a
huge pupil at 8 in the morning.  It's like looking into the abyss or
something.  Wear shades, they're better for your eyes, and you'll look so
fucking' cool for the fashion show that is 1015.

-Er, I hate to say this, but this is a respectable venue.  Please bathe,
don't let last years funk creep over into the new year.  Besides, when
you're runway, you've got to be 150% gorgeous.  And beleive me, 1015 is
runway honey, make no mistake!

-Drop by and say hello, even if you don't smell like roses.  I'll be near
Geoff or Ron or some girls or something.  I love new years morning, even at
Preston's. I will be rather incoherent, but I'll pull it together long
enough to say hi, and engage in conversation.  If I drift off, it's due to
a bra or booty attracting my attention, sorry , a man has his priorities
;).

-Don't get all crazy and loud and pick fights or get into arguments with
people, or other lame ass shit.  It's new years, lighten up, smoke a bowl,
drink some drink, and do what comes naturally (fall down, get dizzy, puke
in the sordid men's room, come out looking like death warmed over, and
start it all over again).

-Yo?  Any ladies playin' at this event?  Didn't think so...hey, I got 5 on
it. Yo, make that a double...hey, what are such fine undergarments doing in
a place like this. Yo man, wassup, hey look, I got 3 friends with me, and
they got 12 friends each, lookie here, you know me man, I gots to get mine,
so why don't you take care of it and my friends too!  Cool G!  Yo, yo,
wassup my man, long time no see...no I didn't go out, can't you smell?


I hope you all have a good new year and that I see some of you out tomorrow
morning.  I have a day of banality planned so...

Out,
John

Damn John,

Don't you get it?  Man's asking for some respect and you miss the point.
One can only wonder why it is YOU who ALWAYS has problems with the cops to
the point where you think there after you.  Could it be your sordid past.
I doubt it, it's not like most cops have a picture of you  as if an APB has
been put out.

No, Mr. Draper, methinks you draw trouble to yourself.  And you're probably
so friggin paranoid about cops that they sense, when they get close to you,
that something is terribly wrong.  C'mon man give it up.  You've put
yourself in some terrible postions in the past as well as the present with
your recent woes.  And you concetrate on these, er, mistakes, shit starts
to cycle in your head, and then you do or say really stupid stuff, in a
stupid tone of voice, to one who could kill you and leave your ass on the
side of the road for the vultures to pick at.  I would just caution you
sir, to relax, and watch how you talk to law enforcement.  If you're shit
was half proper you wouldn't have as much problems as you do with five-oh
(short of some brothers I know, the cops seem to always be a
hop-skip-and-a-jump away from you so...)!

With that said I have always been offended when you call people goons,
gangsters, pigs, whatever, since I find little use in labelling a whole
group of people based on any singular experience.

So my man, get a clue, you offended some people by calling cops pigs, just
stop doing it.  What's to be accomplished anyway with all this name calling
of law enforcement?

I am not a cops, I think there is a cop in my family in Mississippi or
something, I dunno, I don't care. PEOPLE should not be calling others
derrrogatory names.  Besides, 'pigs' went out in the 60's man, like really.
Why don't you update your vocab daddy-o.  Try one of these on for size:

Johnny Law, Five-Oh, Boys in Blue, Cop, Po-Lice, The Man.

Or you might even try the officers real name.

Now stay out of trouble, and if you do get pulled over, don't act stupid or
strange.  And be cordial to the five-oh.  Beleive me, from the reports I've
read, they're as afraid of you as you are of them.

Peace & have a safe new years,
John

Now let's stop all this evil namecalling shall we.

DRUNK DRIVING:Ten basic questions and answers you need to 
know:

Certain features of the laws relating to drunk driving differ from state to
state. 
Some of the main differences are: the amount of alcohol in a person's 
bloodstream that constitutes being under the influence, the exact length of
jail 
sentences and the amount of fines that may be imposed. This article is based
on 
California law which is similar to the laws of many other states.
1. Q: Do you have to be "drunk" to be guilty of drunk driving?
A: No. Years ago, a drunk driving charge meant someone was "drunk" in the way
all of us 
commonly understand the word - intoxicated. But today, intoxication as we
know it is not 
required for one to be guilty of drunk driving. During the last ten years
public outcry against the 
toll of injury and death which drinking drivers inflict has changed the laws
against drunk 
driving radically and made them much more severe. So the criminal laws
against drinking and 
driving now mean operating a vehicle with considerably less alcohol in your
system than what 
we customarily recognize as being enough to make a person drunk. 
You may not think you are drunk. Those around you may not think you are
drunk. Indeed, for 
the purpose of every other situation except driving, you may not even be
considered drunk. But 
your condition may be enough for you to be found guilty of a drunk driving
offense under the 
current definition of the law. And if you are convicted, you will suffer some
very harsh penalties. 
2. Q: Legally, just what is "drunk driving?"
A: A drunk driving offense, sometimes called driving while intoxicated (DWI)
or driving under 
the influence (DUI), really has three general meanings: 
(1) Driving with any amount of alcohol in your system which causes your
physical abilities to be 
impaired in any way. 
(2) Driving with a level of alcohol in your system which amounts to a
measurement of.08 of 
blood alcohol content. To be guilty of this offense, absolutely no impairment
of any of your 
physical abilities is necessary. You may well be the world's most talented,
careful and safest 
driver, but if your blood alcohol content registers .08 or above you are
guilty of a criminal offense. 
(3) Driving with drugs in your system or with a combination of drugs and
alcohol, no matter 
what the amounts of those substances may be, where your physical abilities
have become 
impaired in any way. It does not matter if the drugs are legal , over the
counter medications like 
antihistamines, nor does it matter if you have a prescription to take the
drugs. If you are impaired 
as a result of taking them, then you are guilty of a criminal offense. 
3. Q: What amount of alcohol do I need to drink to have a blood alcohol
content of 
.08 or higher?
A: Each person's blood alcohol content from drinking certain amounts of
alcohol will vary, 
depending upon a number of factors. The main factor is your weight. To
calculate your blood 
alcohol content based upon having normal drinks such as a 12 oz. beer, a  4
ounce glass of wine, 
or a single mixed drink containing a one ounce shot of 100 proof liquor, the
following rule of 
thumb is an illustration: 
120 lbs: one drink in one hour -- .032 
two drinks in one hour -- .064 
three drinks in one hour -- .096 
180 lbs: one drink in one hour -- .021 
two drinks in one hour -- .042 
three drinks in one hour -- .063 
four drinks in one hour -- .084 
4. Q: What kind of reason does a police officer or highway patrolman need to
have 
in order to stop me to investigate whether or not I am driving under the
influence?
A: The officer must have what is legally termed a "reasonable suspicion,"
based on something 
unusual that is actually observed about the way a person is driving. This is
a very low standard 
and it can be satisfied by virtually anything which appears out of the
ordinary and that might be a 
sign of a driver being under the influence. In addition, during holiday
seasons, police officers 
typically set up field sobriety checkpoints where they routinely stop every
driver who passes 
through the checkpoint. These checkpoints do not require the officer to
observe anything 
suspicious about a person before stopping and investigating someone. 
5. Q: What happens to me if I am pulled over by the police or the highway
patrol 
for investigation of drunk driving?
A: If you are stopped, always be courteous and cooperative with the officer
even if you are 100% 
clean of any type of alcohol or drugs, and even if you are certain that your
driving did not show 
anything unusual. Never argue with the officer. Law enforcement is a tough,
often nerve 
wracking job and the "attitude" you show to the officer can often make all
the difference as to 
whether or not the encounter will be an unpleasant one for you. 
6. Q: What will happen if the officer who pulls me over suspects that I have
been 
driving under the influence?
A: The officer will ask you to get out of the car and will instruct you to
perform a series of "field 
sobriety tests." These are standard physical ability measures and they
include: 
(1) Reciting the alphabet from A to Z; 
(2) Closing your eyes and bringing both index fingers together; 
(3) Walking along a straight line; 
(4) Standing on one foot for a few seconds; 
(5) Picking up a coin dropped on the ground; In addition to these tests, some
officers typically 
have certain field sobriety testing devices which they use. One such device
is a breath meter 
which you blow into. another is a light to shine in your eyes in order to
test your pupil reaction. It 
is very important that if you suffer from any chronic physical problems, such
as difficulty with 
your balance, problems walking or with your legs or feet, that you inform the
officer of these 
things before you go through the field sobriety tests. 
7. Q: What happens if the officer believes that I have not performed the
field 
sobriety tests satisfactorily?
A: At that point you will be told that you are under arrest for driving under
the influence. You 
will be hand cuffed, searched for weapons, placed in the back of the
officer's car and taken to a jail 
for further tests. At the jail you will also be booked and held there until
you post bail or until a 
judge releases you on your own recognizance without bail. Once again, as
upsetting and as 
stressful as being arrested is, it is essential that you continue to act
courteously and cooperatively 
with the officer. Do not argue, threaten or become belligerent in any way.
This type of behavior 
will only make the experience even more unpleasant for you. 
8. Q: What is a blood alcohol test?
A: This is a physical procedure to determine how much alcohol you actually
have in your system. 
There are three ways of doing this test: 
(1) Drawing a sample of blood from your arm; 
(2) Obtaining a urine sample; 
(3) Obtaining a breath sample by having you blow into a machine called a
breathalyzer; (This is 
different from the field sobriety breath device described above. The
breathalyzer is much more 
sophisticated and exact. 
You have the choice of which one of these three tests you will take. The only
time your ability to 
choose which test you take can legally be restricted is if you are in a
locality that simply does not 
have a breathalyzer. The officer is required to tell you that the option as
to which test you take is 
up to you. But quite often officers will try to pressure or browbeat a person
into taking the blood 
test because this is the most effective procedure for the prosecution to use
against a person in 
court. You do not have the right to refuse to take any test. Legally, the
officer could hold you 
down and forcibly draw a blood sample from your veins. In practice this
rarely happens except 
where an accident is involved which caused death or serious bodily injury.
Instead, if you refuse 
to take a test, your driver's license is automatically suspended for one
year. Also, in your trial, the 
jury will be told that you refused to take the test and the judge will
instruct the jury that they can 
consider your refusal as evidence of your guilt. 
9. Q: What should I know in order to make an intelligent choice about which
blood 
alcohol test I should take?
A: As mentioned above, from the standpoint of the police and prosecution they
will always 
prefer to have the more accurate sample of your actual blood to use against
you as evidence in 
court. The least accurate and least reliable test is of a urine sample.
However, if it has been some 
period of time from when you had your last drink to when you give the urine
sample, the 
sample may test out to your disadvantage with an inaccurately high reading
against you. This is 
because in such a situation, the alcohol content in your excreted urine is
actually greater than the 
amount of alcohol you have remaining in your system. 
On the other hand, a breath test may show an inaccurately high reading
against you if you take 
the breath test shortly after your last drink. This is because of the high
alcohol content lingering 
in the mouth, esophagus, and the upper digestive system. If you have used any
kind of breath 
spray, mouthwash or even should you burp shortly before the breath test, then
the reading could 
be inaccurately high against you. Both the blood and the urine samples will
also show the 
presence of drugs as well as alcohol. However a breath test can only
determine alcohol content 
and nothing about drugs. Whichever test you take must be given to you within
3 hours of when 
you were driving. 
10. Q: What are the penalties for driving while under the influence?
A: Drunk driving penalties have become very severe in the past few years. For
a first offense, the 
maximum possible penalties the court could impose are: 
(1) 6 months in the county jail: 
(2) $1,000 fine plus up to an additional $1,950 in penalty assessments; 
(3) 6 months driver's license suspension; 
(4) Your car impounded for 30 days. 
Second, third and fourth offenses within 7 years are punished by increasingly
more harsh 
penalties. For third and fourth convictions, your license must be revoked for
3 and 4 years 
respectively. A fourth offense can even be prosecuted against you as a felony
carrying a 
maximum term of 3 years in state prison along with your car being ordered
sold and the proceeds 
going to the state. In addition to all of the above penalties, the price of
auto insurance increases 
drastically after any conviction for a driving under the influence offense. 
The bottom line legal and practical advice to draw from all of all of the
above is very clear: 
IT IS NEVER WORTH IT TO DRINK AND DRIVE.

I went to the Gathering.  I knew it was going to be a big party,
and I really hate big parties.  I felt obligated though, as my
friend from Chicago was spinning (Terry Mullan).

I got there, I danced, I talked to some people, I danced some more,
I talked some more, then went home.  Looking back, I realize I had
a good time there.  A couple of immediate reasons jump out - there
was not overly-done production in the space (no paper-mache statues,
no 30 ft altars, no concert lighting, etc), good sound systems,
and good dj's.  I was a bit lost among so many people, and the
music wasn't always to my tastes, but overall, things were okay.

Now, I don't know how I would feel if I had paid $25 for this party.
Don't get me wrong, I am a capitalist and certainly commend Martin
for the business undertaking he successfully pulled off.  I don't
even care if he made a year of my salary on that party.  That
doesn't effect my enjoyment one way or the other.

You can always question if that same party could have been thrown
for $5 less, or $10 less.  There are no guarantees of attendance,
so every business venture has to estimate low.  The only concern
should be my personal level of cost vs enjoyment.  What may be
"worth it" to me might be "highway robbery" to someone else.

The only problem I see is that we as consumers don't make Martin
or any other promoter out to be a superstar just for running a
business...

Item Subject: cc:Mail Text
     Hi everyone,
     
     It's probably a little bit late for a review, especially given that 
     this week's calendar is already out. However I am only now beginning 
     to come back down to earth after Saturday, so here are my thoughts.
     
     I had an absolute blast! I loved every minute of it, and didn't want 
     it to end. The music, the people, the vibe, everything was simply 
     superb.
     
     This was my first "massive". Although I was expecting the party to be 
     big, I didn't expect it to be this big. Given the size I thought the 
     party was incredibly well managed. All of the problems that I have 
     seen at much smaller parties were not there. The long line at the 
     start moved very quickly. The staff certainly didn't get in my face. 
     The space was huge and well ventilated. The toilet lines were short. 
     And probably best of all I didn't encounter any negative energy from 
     anyone. By the way, do we have an official answer on the number of 
     people yet? 
     
     I was there with five very close friends. My partner in crime J-C, the 
     man who can never stand still. My old mates Rob and Leighton who 
     haven't been out dancing for a couple of months now. And finally we 
     had a couple of first timers Ann and Sophie. They are already asking 
     me when the next party is.
     
     I met quite a few sfravers which was fantastic. I bumped into Amy, 
     Wayne, Vince, Crunchman and Ethan (thanks for the tape!) again. I also 
     got to meet Shawna, Dimitriou (sp?), Tom and his friend (sorry!) for 
     the first time. I know there were others, so please excuse me for 
     leaving you out.
     
     Tom I loved your message. The last few songs of the night when the 
     lights have been turned on is always my favorite time. It's so 
     incredible to look around and see the smiles on everyone's faces. It 
     feels like the dawn of a new beginning. And yes I am saw also. I've 
     strained muscles in both my legs and in my neck, not to mention 
     blisters all over my feet. I guess that's what happens when you 
     dance for seven and a half hours with shoes and no socks!
     
     Finally some random thoughts and suggestions. 
     
     Running out of water was a bit of a pain. Unfortunately I didn't 
     find the tap like some others. Did anyone else taste that cranberry 
     juice? Yuck!
     
     Did anyone else think it was a little too dark, especially in the 
     bigger room. I need to see more smiles! I also agree with the 
     comments about the visuals. Give us some more lasers. 
     
     I found that the two room setup broke up the vibe for me a little 
     bit. Each time I was really in a zone dancing, and about to be 
     transported to another level, a little voice in the back of my head 
     would say something like "Your missing Jeno in the other room". I 
     guess that if that's my only real gripe, then I should just shutup 
     and dance!
     
     Thanks to Martin, the crew and everyone who was there for a 
     fantastic party. Well worth the $25. Until next time...
     
     Keep on smiling!
     
     Scott.
     
     P.S. If you are wondering who the hell I am, I was the Australian 
     bastard with long hair and half a beard, wearing the multi-coloured 
     striped overalls.

don't know if this is helpful clarification or not, but i just heard
from the planet dog publicist that the new moon was cancelled at the
behest of art parent, not the band.

what this also means is that the january 4th appearance of eat static
at the sound factory in san francisco is also a no go.

Amen, John.  Law enforcement is a real dangerous job at times, and it takes 
someone who really believes in what they're doing to work towards a position 
as a policeman/sheriff.  I have a friend up in Washington that I grew up 
with who just recently became a deputy sheriff.  His name is George Dvorack. 
 This guy is my hero.  I have an immense amount of respect and admiration 
for him.  Law enforcement isn't a job, it's a calling.  The pay is crap, you 
wind up doing crap work on occasion like handing out traffic tickets, when 
you put on the uniform everyone suddenly hates you or is wary of you, and 
every time you go out, you just hope you'll make it back in one piece.  But 
they are there to protect you and the structure of the society you live in, 
whether you choose to keep that in mind or not.  It takes a special kind of 
person to keep an even keel while doing that job.  I agree totally with 
John: act suspicious, and they will be suspicious.  Give them a hard time, 
and they can give you one right back.  

They deserve your respect.  Respect them and they'll respect you.

we cannot reserve them because we have been flooded with that request.
If you haven't got them you better get on it...

Good day-

I didn't go to Reserextion like I said.. I heard from friends that there were
a lot a vibeless people in line so they didn't go in..
However I lent my name to a friend and he went around 3.30 to Oakland..  He
said they were hassaled at 3.30 to pay full price (20$) and after some heavy
negotiating they got in for free.
Acording to Jerome(me amigo) the floor was gressy and he sliped while dancing
a lot... the chill rooms were unventalated and there was about 100 ppl there
mostly sitting around the warehouse.
Glad I didn't go -- I hooked with a nice female at a party and am gonna meet
her tonight somewhere..

Happy New year

I doubt that there are cops that monitor the daily list 
although I'm sure it would be a perfect job for a rookie DEA agent
just out of school, who looks to "clean" to be put in the field yet :)

anyways it is really easy for a cop who is computer literate to subscribe
to the sfr calender and get it in his/her AOL mailbox alog with the
the current leather sports calender :)

It there are police chiefs who smoke dope, why do you kind it hard to believe
that a cop has a hard time using e-mail.  I mmean remember they have 
their own private version of v-rave that they can use as they cruise around
in their cruisers.

No need for paranoia but you should act as if everything you say on this
list could be used against you someday if you are busted.

I went, it was ok, saw carlos spinning, danced for a while.
I wouldn't say vibeless, but less vibey than the SF folks, on a good
night, but it was ok.  Very young, compared to the avg 1015 crowd,
for example, though.  I thought they were nice enough.  The sound
system was kinda harsh, too much mid/treble, with distortion,
and not enough bass (hate that).  I'll give it a so, so.  Would have
been better if I was part of the operant social set, but they're
*much* younger than I, which isn't bad, just that I'm not likely to
hang out long enough to get to know many of them, and etc., etc.
The 5-6 or so I spoke with were pretty nice, friendly.

Ah, would it were always true.  Since I generally don't do illegal things
I don't see the results of whatever "protection" is afforded me from law
enforcement -- I only see the cops that fuck with me for no reason, like
detaining me outside the 7-11 one block from my house and questioning me
about my destination, friends, what tattoos I might have (!), etc., while
a police copter hovered overhead with the searchlight pinning me down.

My crime?  "You left the store without buying anything -- that's suspicious."
"They were out of Sunday papers, so I was going to try the liquor store
across the street."  Evidently this wasn't a good enough reason, so I got 
questioned.  Being pulled over for no reason and having my car searched,
on the street where I lived...the examples are many.  I can't
imagine what it would be like if I were Black or Hispanic; probably would
have had my money confiscated under suspicion of dealing drugs (they can
do that, right on the street) and taken down to the station.

The trouble with a job being underpaid
is that people are doing it for other reasons.  For some, they may
be noble.  For many cops I've experienced, the perk is being able to 
abuse people verbally and physically, and then hide behind a badge.

Unfortunately, the "wrong" reasons (self-gratification through abuse of
the powerless) are more powerful than the "right" reasons (protection
of one's community), as the first is reinforced every time you fuck with
someone, whereas the second is only reinforced when you actually stop 
something bad from happening and someone thanks you for it --  a rare 
event.

A friend of mine has an ex-cop brother, who from all indications was
doing it for the right reasons.  He felt very outnumbered by those that,
in his view, abused their power.  I suspect his experience is typical.

I mean, what if _you_ could safely and legally beat the shit out of anyone
who gave you lip?  What if you could fuck with people you hate, and leave
them powerless to retaliate in kind?  What if you could ruin the day, week,
or life of anyone, and have almost zero chance of being caught?

Would _you_ be able to keep your head when someone who's been fucked with
by too many bad cops starts calling you a fucking pig shithead so get your
fucking pig hands offa me, asshole!  Wouldn't it be nice to just slam them
over the hood of your car and cuff 'em?  Wouldn't you start provoking 
people, just a little, so you can feel that rush of power more often?  
Wouldn't it go to your head?  Pretty soon you've got that slow swagger 
down, the insolent voice that tells people "Come on, shitheel, try me",
the mirrorshades that nail down your 'tude, all calculated to make people
*itch* to fuck with you so you can legally beat them to the ground with
your D-cell flashlight/riot baton.  And if they run, maybe you get to
blow them away...damn.  Don't you sometimes wonder what it would be like
to drop a human instead of those stupid carboard silhouettes?  Wouldn't
it give you a sort of black joy to be able to squeeze off on the poor
bastard who thought he could run from the steel-cap boot of Justice?  
Ha!  Take that, motherfucker!

"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."

Power - Responsibility = Corruption

therefore

  lim Corruption = 0
power->0

...

thus mathematically proving the superiority of anarchy.

Ha!

Got back home from the family Christmas just in time to catch this news
about a free party in SC, but too late to get ahold of anyone at Ameba!
Anyone know what's up?  Please...you'll make my year.
