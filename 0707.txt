Subject: Re: [sfraves] SPINAL INVASION

damn welcome back apollo, wasn't sure if you were going to make it  
back but i'm glad you did and thanks for sharing the reason you were  
in the hospital with the whole list.  i think that's definitely a  
healthier way of dealing with an illness than others i've known in  
the past, not that it's a bad thing to have privacy, i just think at  
some point talking about it helps the healing process.  so for those  
of you that watched the secret DVD you'll know what i'm talking  
about, i'll go down and write 'HEALTHY APOLLO' on my dream board next  
to 'WAR WITH IRAN POSTPONED INDEFINITELY'.  that stuff works, btw,  
other things on it have come true for me, and i encourage others to  
do the same!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] beer favorites?

i agree that i don't like hung over or too drunk beer, so i guess i'd  
have to say i'm willing to pay more.  in my travels in europe this  
summer, so far my favorite was the polish local beer called Tao.  and  
with our exchange rate still favorable in poland, you'll pay about  
$1.50 a pint, maybe $2.  carlsberg on tap is real good too.  plus  
there's a bar on practically every street corner, poland seems to be  
a pretty big drinking town, and the clubs are open late too ... i  
really would like to go back.

it depends on the mixer and the songs, specifically what parts of the  
songs.  basically i like to use crossfader for quick segues and the  
volume control knobs for longer mixes.

Here's a dnb mix I threw together on a lark. I hadn't played most of these
before, so it's a little rough in spots.

http://pestilence.short-b.us/mp3/01%20Suicide%20Bomb%20in%20Lebanon%20-%20%5b07-02-2007%5d.mp3

Also, strangely, I stopped playing drum and bass long enough to record this
little trance/house ditty:

http://pestilence.short-b.us/mp3/01%20No%20Shit%20Sherlock%20%5b07-02-2007%5d.mp3

Thoughts?

Who wants to book me?

It's tonight people.  Get out and dance!


Dyn-O-Might RETURNS!!!!!!!
Tuesday, July 3rd, 2007
@ Mighty (119 Utah)
10pm-4am
Presales: Limited $7 (SOLDOUT), then $10 - groovetickets.com until 4pm on 7/3
Door tickets: $10 b4 11:30 & $15 afterwards

Evil Breaks, Sister SF, In Deep, along with the new addition, the
Ambient Mafia, will be teaming up to bring you a 4th of July party
celebration you're not going to forget. And since everyone has the
following day off, why not come and spend your Tuesday night in
debaucherous style with us at one of the best venues in the city??

Many of us know and love the music of our headliner, Carbon Community,
but noone has seen him do his Live show in SF since we brought him out
waaaay back in December of 2005. Dave will also be bringing out his
drummer Pete who will be playing on his full drum kit, along with Dave
bangin away on his synths & hanging drums. Carbon Community Live has
been constantly compared to Uberzone's Live show, and with the
addition of the hanging, light-up drums, it just might be taking it
one step further. If you missed seeing Carbon Community Live the last
time they were out here you really need to come see how amazing a Full
Live PA can be.

Ever wonder ....

1) Creepy peeps like Cheney know that they are
constantly pressing against the line of social and
political unrest. They move the line little by little
and thus people never get outraged enough at one time
to step up and say THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!

2) Remember when Bush said whoever was responsible for
leaking Vallerie Plame would be dealt with?

3) Did you know Hitler used nationalism and propoganda
campaigns to ease into the holocaust? He killed the
retards first. Then started putting down dissenting
politicians (ie: the attorney general scandal), then
gypsies, then Jews...

4) Did you know that we rounded up all Japanese people
and put them in camps 50 yrs ago? Does that seem
anything like Gitmo to you? You think that maybe Gitmo
is in Cuba because it would seem a little too much
like the Angel Island internment camp if it wasn't?

5) Do you think more people would be outraged if the
papers and 24 hour news agencies were alllowed to take
phgotogs of the 4000 soldiers killed in Iraq? Think
the feds don't know that? What aboput the 25,000 +
vets missing arms and legs? Think they'll be
successful and happy about their service in 10 yrs
when this mess is trying to be forgotten?

6) Imagine being an Arab today. Can you imagine how
scary it would be to try and speak up? What list does
that get you on?

Happy 4th of July. I am quite sure what we have today
is not what anyone from the developing years of this
nation had in mind.

E

PS.... The "Moran" photo helps to explain a lot. The
people least likely to be affected by terrorists are
the ones most affected by it. WHY? ... because not
only are they most open to nationalistic propoganda,
they are also the most likely to join the military,
and thus die.

Ever wonder ....

1) Creepy peeps like Cheney know that they are
constantly pressing against the line of social and
political unrest. They move the line little by little
and thus people never get outraged enough at one time
to step up and say THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!

2) Remember when Bush said whoever was responsible for
leaking Vallerie Plame would be dealt with?

3) Did you know Hitler used nationalism and propoganda
campaigns to ease into the holocaust? He killed the
retards first. Then started putting down dissenting
politicians (ie: the attorney general scandal), then
gypsies, then Jews...

4) Did you know that we rounded up all Japanese people
and put them in camps 50 yrs ago? Does that seem
anything like Gitmo to you? You think that maybe Gitmo
is in Cuba because it would seem a little too much
like the Angel Island internment camp if it wasn't?

5) Do you think more people would be outraged if the
papers and 24 hour news agencies were alllowed to take
phgotogs of the 4000 soldiers killed in Iraq? Think
the feds don't know that? What aboput the 25,000 +
vets missing arms and legs? Think they'll be
successful and happy about their service in 10 yrs
when this mess is trying to be forgotten?

6) Imagine being an Arab today. Can you imagine how
scary it would be to try and speak up? What list does
that get you on?

Happy 4th of July. I am quite sure what we have today
is not what anyone from the developing years of this
nation had in mind.

E

PS.... The "Moran" photo helps to explain a lot. The
people least likely to be affected by terrorists are
the ones most affected by it. WHY? ... because not
only are they most open to nationalistic propoganda,
they are also the most likely to join the military,
and thus die.

Yeah, he's got to pay $250K in fines.  But even that, I'd say is a safe 
bet, isn't likely to come out of his own pockets.  For what he did was 
to obstruct justice in a case that implicated folks all the way up as 
high as Cheney and possibly GW himself.  It's likely a full pardon is in 
the works for Bush's end of term.

Now if that isn't distress for a democracy, I don't know what is.

Pinkko indeed-

Listen friend- I'm as dissatisfied with this country's performance of late  
as any man-
But burn a flag in my presence outside of an honorable disposal and you'll  
meet with the wrong end of anything you can think of.
This country once stood for something, and I've got far too many dead  
relatives to accept such a disgrace.
Want to dance?

I've actually got a 6-pack (well, a 5-pack now) in my
fridge at the moment!  

It's pretty good -- I'd say better than RC, but not as
good as sugar-based Coke in the glass bottles.

I resisted buying the Krusty-Os because I already had
a box of cereal at the house.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so. . .

Especially since conveniently there is no chance of this "beating" ever occurring.
 
Look, if burning a flag is a stupid, pointless, and thoughtless act, then what does that make the act of beating someone because they burned a flag?  Even more stupid and pointless in my book.

Anyhow...

Speaking of the American flag, I made a stop a few years back here: http://www.flaghouse.org/about/index.html

It was pretty boring actually, but at least it was air conditioned and just a few blocks from here: http://www.obryckis.com/

Peace,

Peter

No, I just know that drawing lines in the sand over something as retarded as 
burning a flag is for knee-JERK reactionaries, and "arm-chair general" 
types.

You're so gung-ho and pro-America, shut the fuck up and go defend our flag 
in Iraq.

I've really reached the point where just punching someone is pretty much 
only instigated by violence on someone else's part first.  It's a pretty 
stupid way to resolve things, I have occasional visual/balance problems 
cause of a bat I took across the head when I was in high school, and a 
scar on my leg from a cheap piece of shit that pulled a knife in a fight 
(where he started it!) and didn't like the fact that I dropped him.

Burning a flag bugs me, but I'm pretty sure we have the right to do it.  
On the other hand, beating someone down over a philosphical difference is 
just downright bullydom.  Scott, you're smart enough to realize the people 
you mentioned didn't sacrifice, fight and possibly die for that flag but 
rather what it represents and the people they care for.  If someone tried 
to burn the people I care for, that's a totally different story... it 
becomes a matter of a violent address to violence because of immediate 
threat.  People sell out America every day, but they tend to be pretty 
damn sneaky about it.  A flag burning politico trying to get heard about 
some point is usually not the enemy here.

-&e->You're so gung-ho and pro-America, shut the fuck up and go defend our flag
-&e->in Iraq.

Eh, that's just stirring shit... and while I empathize and support our 
soldiers and non-miltary contractors doing what they do out there, the 
administration who called the shots in Iraq has done a horrible disservice 
to not just our future but global geopolitics for the life of oil as a 
commodity and islamic extremism.  If you were to play degrees of 
seperation, GW Bush is a lot closer to Bin Laden by various metrics..., 
contacts, history and even philosophy than I am to either of them.  When 
you think about things that way, unquestionable American nationalism 
doesn't make quite the sense it does in a vaccuum.  Both use what power 
they have to advance religious agendas, both are controversial leaders in 
their communities because of questionable methods and justifications, etc.  
I'm just a schmuck who likes to write long emails...

I love this place, but a big part of that love is tolerance (tolerance, if 
you think about it is the other half of freedom... you take freedoms, you 
take liberties, but only by other people granting you the tolerance and 
understanding to do so even when they don't agree).  I think if I saw 
somweone burning a flag, I'd play into what they're wanting... namely 
asking them why they're doing it.  And then, I'd remind them that they're 
fucking morons cause there aren't many viable reasons for doing so.  But 
if I was like, a UPS guy who drove off a road and was stranded, and I went 
in the back and I had a big shipment of American flags in the back, you'd 
best believe they'd be my blanket, toilet paper and firewood.

andyw

p.s. Also, sore subject for me today, 5 douchebags tried to mug me and a 
friend last night right outside the Powell street BART last night.  
Really difficult to make ok with the whole might makes right thing when 
you're on the wrong end of a really unfair situation.

It just sickens me that people NEVER bitch about the fact that the flag is 
used on stuff like:

Panties/Underwear

Headbands/Bandanas

Hats

...and all other manner of stuff that gets it dirty, messy, and otherwise 
soiled.

If you think flag burners are bad, why don't you start a fight with every 
person you see sporting an "Ol' Glory" pair o' drawers? Soiling the flag is 
such a damn sin - go bomb the places that publish pics of people sporting 
flag bikinis and shit too while you're at it.

Sounds fuckin' retarded now, don't it? Of course it does - cuz it IS 
retarded. As retarded as trying to cause ruckus cuz someone wants to 
excercise THEIR RIGHT to burn a fucking flag.

Sorry- was not threatening a beating in any sense-

By "anything you can think of" I was referring to the escalation that  
happens when the uncivilized meet the civilized-
I defer to Larry Flynt- go do whatever you want- but think about exactly  
why you're doing it :)

BTW- you're talking to the man who was responsible for this:

Or how about the SUPER PATRIOTS that put their flag up
for the 4th of July, never take it down, and you see
it hanging in threads, destroyed by the weather, in
October.

That's worse than burning it to me. At leasat burning
the flag shows you care about something. Letting it
rot, using it as a crotch snuggler, etc... shows you
wanted to be in the "Flag Waivers" crowd for that
moment.

Personally, I'd rather burn effigies (sp?) or poke
voodoo dolls... but if you wanna burn the flag, be my
guest.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so. . .

Now, this may be the situation out there in liberal left-coast San
Francisco, but in the rest of America, the America that respects
traditional values, this sort of talk is just treason.  You know, a
lot of the folks out there, I think they're saying, Andy, we respect
your right to your opinions and your wacko-loony lifestyles, but when
you mess with the American flag, you've gone too far, sir.  You can
have all your tolerance and homosexual agendas with Nancy Pelosi and
the far left liberal ring of the Democratic Party - all financed by
George Soros - but when you come here, to the No Spin Zone, and talk
about burning the flag, that's just too much.  I think many factor
viewers out there will join me in saying, Andy W, you've gone too far.

And that's tonight's Talking Points memo...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so. . .

I think people do actually bitch about this, just maybe not in your circle of friends.

When I was growing up there was a lot of fuss over flag burning those crazy kids wearing flags on their clothes.  Taht was about 40 years ago.  There were actually a lot of people that were upset about all of those sorts of items.  You certainly couldn't go into Disneyland wearing anything with a flag on it or even a flag fragment back in the sixties or seventies for example.

It just sickens me that people NEVER bitch about the fact that the flag is 
used on stuff like:

Panties/Underwear

Headbands/Bandanas

Hats

...and all other manner of stuff that gets it dirty, messy, and otherwise 
soiled.

If you think flag burners are bad, why don't you start a fight with every 
person you see sporting an "Ol' Glory" pair o' drawers? Soiling the flag is 
such a damn sin - go bomb the places that publish pics of people sporting 
flag bikinis and shit too while you're at it.

Sounds fuckin' retarded now, don't it? Of course it does - cuz it IS 
retarded. As retarded as trying to cause ruckus cuz someone wants to 
excercise THEIR RIGHT to burn a fucking flag.

You're entirely correct, and I apologize for being too brief-
But to me I see a difference between burning the flag and say, burning an  
effigy of Bush.
One is a statement about the current state of things, the other is a much  
larger statement...
Like hanging my flag upside down as a signal of dire national distress (as  
it is hung now)-
Versus burning the flag and all that it has represented through history  
and disgracing everything that we as a nation have accomplished-

I'll defend your right to do either, but one will be met with capital-P  
Protest.

I think the ACLU knows that the current court doesn't view Tinker v. Des=20

I'm newly carless - getting down there isn't the issue;  is it hard to get a
cab back?  I've had bad luck with cab services not answering their phones.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] another reason you should go to Mighty tonight

Yea, the cab companies in this area have a bad habit of not answering calls 
during rush hours, or just plain telling you to "wave down a cab" when u are 
calling to get one.

Um - HELLO - I am calling to book a cab because I CAN'T WAVE ONE DOWN. Dur.

But the cab #'s that tend to work (eventually) are:

Yellow Cab: (415) 333-3333

Luxor Cab: (415) 282-4141

And this one I forget the name of: (415) 222-2222

as well as this random:

DeSoto: 415-970-1300

Subject: Re: [sfraves] bsp: 07.07.07 [KONTROL] w/ Bruno Pronsato, Drumcell, and JamesPatrick!

Highly recommended show!

Bruno Pronsato, as he's known, is bad bad bad ass. He's dared to take
electronic music into dark, swampy soul cranking waters that
consistantly blow me away. What else can I say but don't miss a chance
to see him while he's on his U.S. tour.

Also, look forward to James Patrick aka JP. This man has created many
techno miracles in Minneapolis and is hugely respected by all. Ask him
about 'the pocket' parties they're throwing in a parking garage! (an
idea worth imitating, I think).

We had JP perform his style of "detail oriented dance music" at the
Dark Room back in September and he had a pretty wide range of the
minimal side of techno, including a lot of older material from the
first expressions of this genre.

_bad_ass_

but first, a few questions...

Can a multidimensional penis get busy with a wormhole and would it change 
my claimed sexual orientation?  Can a pan dimensional schlong be expressed 
using an n-by-n matrix?  Do traditional scalar metrics still hold?  Do 
women who are sensitive to these additional dimensions still claim certain 
linear measurements are of little merit?  How does the "motion of the 
ocean" plot against non-newtonian spacetime?  If I whip it around, can 
this still be mathematically modeled using a sum of vectors approach?  
>From a string theory point of view, would this increase the heretofore 
considered constant Planck length of my jizz missle?  Could they just turn 
my pocket rocket into a Lorentz gun instead... (cause shooting plasma 
channels rather than baby batter would be pretty damn cool)?

Brilliant job on their part throwing off the buzzword searches though.

With the weather we've been having, I think it's a fire hazard.   
Didn't oakland cancel its fireworks for the year because it's so dry  
they're scares an accident would burn down half the town?

While I agree that burning a flag is pretty much a stupid waste;  
whatever it is you think this country stands for, it doesn't  
anymore.  George bush has pretty much flushed all of that down the  
toilet.

That toilet was flushed long before Bush was in power. In fact, if you look
at the history of the US, you might even go so far as to say that toilet
started out flushed.

Subject: [sfraves] videos of dancing?

hey sfraves list,

i'm working on an art project (4kb production for a demo party) and
want to do some vectorized silhouette's dancing (if you're familiar w/
"the scene" you'll remember these styles from some amiga demos)

don't have a video camera of my own, but i'd like to use all original
material. so if you have any videos of yourself or friends dancing, or
similar videos from parties you've been too ... and wouldn't mind the
things being vectorized for this project ... please get in touch!

thanks much
j.ordan aka k9d/nd

That toilet was flushed long before Bush was in power. In fact, if you look
at the history of the US, you might even go so far as to say that toilet
started out flushed.

our troops are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect our 
rights.  One such right is our right to free speech.  I can burn a 
flag if I want to.  I can burn a flag in front of SS's house, and 
suffer no ill - it's my right.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Wed)

Happy 4th of July.  I propose you take a moment to reflect on what the =20
Founding Fathers fought and died for.  If they were here today, what =20
would they think of us?  May we last another 230 years.

Today's quote was inspired by a thread on the DCRaves list asking your =20
version of the American Dream.  I looked up the term on Wikipedia, =20
curious of how far back that term goes, and it suggests this term was =20
first used when this book was written.  I find it ironic it was =20
written in the middle of the Great Depression.  So no matter how hard =20
the bankers try to destroy our country, they can never destroy the =20
dream.  We may be kind of down and out right now but I believe we'll =20
bounce back and that will spread around the world.

I don't want to ramble on too much more.  Go enjoy your tofu barbeque.


--

If, as I have said, the things already listed were all we had to =20
contribute, America would have made no distinctive and unique gift to =20
mankind. But there has been also the American dream, that dream of a =20
land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for every =20
man, with opportunity for each according to his ability or achievement.

- James Truslow Adams, "The Epic of America" (1931)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so. . .

Err, well that was supposed to be a humorous response to the flushing the toilet comment from pinkko.  But ok.

I agree and I support your right to say and do what you want even if I don't like it.  But realistically if you burn a flag in front of someone's house you are not only exercising free speech you are doing something purposely inflamatory (heh) with the intention of offending them. I don't care if you call it free speech or not, the intention is to offend.  

The question I have is whether flag burning can ever be constructive in any conceivable way.  

Scott has already said what he'll do to anyone that burns a flag near him, and while I certainly don't support his threatening people here or actually beating them because they burned a flag, now that he's announced his feelings about flag burning we know where he stands.  Burning a flag in front of his house should be expected to produce a bad result.   I wouldn't do it.

Does burning a flag in front of him make the world a better place?  I say no, it just really pisses him off.  And the world needs less anger in it not more.

Regards,

Peter

our troops are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect our 
rights.  One such right is our right to free speech.  I can burn a 
flag if I want to.  I can burn a flag in front of SS's house, and 
suffer no ill - it's my right.

I didn't say I would do it - I don't have anything to protest that 
warrants such an action.  That's the reason, IMO, to do it.  Not to 
piss anyone off.  I think Scott just needs to be reminded that other 
people have rights, and he's not sanctified to trample them.  I could 
stand in front of his house burning a flag with a couple buddies with 
shotguns, if you're worried about my safety.  I'm not.

I agree we need less anger, so stop saying stupid shit, and I won't 
get pissed. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so. . .

LOL   I spit out my cereal when I read this.

You're talking about heading over to Scott's house with shotguns to burn a flag and I'm saying stupid shit?  This is allstar shitalker's hall 
of fame material here.  Seriously.  Congradulations on your amazing work. <applauds>

Anyhow...

Its the fourth of July and looks like a rare clear one here in SF so I'm going to head down to the pier for the fireworks madness.  Some that are 21+ might enjoy the Pacific Sound/Stompy party which promises to have a good view of the fireworks as well.  

And I may burn something today, but it sure won't be a flag.

Have a safe and sane fourth sfraves!

Peter

Dude put down the crack pipe.  You are talking about "rights" by using the example of going to someone's house with shotguns to burn a flag.  

And FWIIW I don't agree you have the right to burn something in front of anyone's house while standing outside threatening them with weapons.  I certainly hope not.

Also try changing "flag" into "cross" and see if you still like your argument.

SARCASM ALERT!!!

Whats wrong with burning a cross? As a Jew, it is part
of our secret Friday Night Sabath Rituals. When the
Gollum is let out of the basement of the synagogue, we
all remove our yarmulkas exposing our horns, and burn
a cross while running around the synagogue speaking in
toungues. You probably think that "tounges" is hebrew,
but boy are you wrong. And yarmulkas are not worn out
of respect for god, but rather to cover our horns,
which we grind down each week after they magicallly
reapppear during the cross-burning ritual.

SARCASM OFF!!

Simmer down folks. Whats great about SFR is we can all
believe in totally different shit, have different
ideals, philosophies, etc... But at the end of the
day, we all have one thing in common... We know what
it is like to have a collective experience associated
with dance music. Don't forget that all this politics,
religion, philosophy shit gets left at the door when
you go out for a night of dance and music.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: 'BACK ON TRACK' - SATURDAY 7.7.7

BACK ON TRACK

SATURDAY JULY 7th
FAT CITY
314 11th Street
San Francisco


So, whether you know it or not, I have not played a
gig in SF since 2001. I am really excited to be coming
back this weekend to play with and for people that
have been part of the SF scene since the 90's. The
line-up is top notch, I have heard incrediblle things
about the decor, and with Terry doing visuals you know
it is going to be an incredible display.

On top of this, I am bringing my Fiance Tiffany, who
has only heard the stories, the tales, the rumblings
of the great times we used to have. I truly want her
to have a complete experience... So please come out
and show her what a party can be like. All she knows
is pimped out clubs with table service and bad music.
I WANT TO CHANGE ALL THAT.

I know chuck is going to post the line-up soon, but
regardless, we are coming down to see old faces and
new, smile, dance and enjoy ourselves, so we'll be
there most of the night. Come find us and say hi.

Regardless, I know the music is going to ROCK. Lots of
your favorite locals, a couple of great
out-of-towners, and a Holiday weekend your SUPPOSED to
party on.

So lets do it old skool, bring back THAT vibe, and get
BACK ON TRACK.

Eric

PS... If you come talk to me and tell me you are from
SFR, I'll make sure you get a funny Silver Pearl T-Shirt

thanks to everyone that made it out!  great mixed crowd and we rocked
it on a tuesday night!

for those that don't know, Dyn-O-Might was Evil Breaks' last big party
for a few months.  we're taking a break, though you might hear about a
day party or a small underground (if you're on our mailing list).

we'll be back later in the year!

WTF are CaliGrown Events?

Were a spin-off of a former Central Valley UG rave crew called Elysium from the
late 90s - early 00s. Elysium produced several events in the Central Valley, and
some in the Bay Area including a residence at the now infamous Hotel Ibiza in
2001. We produce events out of love for the music and the vibe its followers carry.

BRUNO PRONSATO
 
Seattle via Berlin producer Bruno Pronsato (aka Steven
Ford) took several giant steps in 2005 toward the peak
of the experimental techno mountain. Both on vinyl and
onstage, Pronsato kept up a hectic pace of production
and performance, catalyzing listeners and crowds in
Germany, Switzerland, Turkey, Mexico, throughout the
United States, and a triumphant set at Montreal's
MUTEK festival. Twelve-inches on esteemed labels like
Orac, Musique Risqu&#65533;e, Milnor Modern, Philpot,
and Telegraph further elevated his stature and built
his international fan base
 
A sound scientist whose work is equally playful and
rigorous, Pronsato deploys a canny use of space and
idiosyncratically fashioned rhythms to disorient and
build suspense&#65533;like some 21st-century Miles
Davis or Eric Dolphy of the laptop. Despite being a
minimal-techno artist, Pronsato offers a palette
that's as full of unexpected patterns and meticulously
rendered textures as a Wassily Kandinsky painting.
 
Pronsato's compositions unsettle in original ways, yet
they also slyly tickle funnybones. Often both humorous
and erotic, his cuts are the wild cards that
adventurous DJs pull out when they want to take the
dance floor to strange new levels of motion.
Therefore, Pronsato's releases have become elite
selectors' secret weapons of beguilingly baffling
quirkiness that still move asses.
 
Unsurprisingly, 2006 is promising to be as eventful as
last year. As demand for his music has waxed, Pronsato
has accordingly increased his productivity while
maintaining his usual exacting quality control
standards. March will bring Pronsato's debut 12 for
Hello? Repeat while summer 2006 will see EPs issued by
Orac and Telegraph (watch for the last two editions of
the four-part Limeworks series), plus another
collaboration with Argentinean Franco Cinelli for
Milnor Modern (Picaro, their first joint effort from
late '05, contains some of Pronsato's most flavorful
club bangers). A temporary residence in Holland will
enable Pronsato to spend even more time in 2006
devastating European audiences with his uniquely
psychedelic and funky techno live sets.

DRUMCELL
 
Founder of Droid Recordings and co-founder of Droid
Behavior, Drumcell (aka Mohamed "Moe" Espinosa) has
been one of techno's greatest allies in Southern
California in recent times. A graduate of the
Musician's Institute and a long-time performer at
parties in Southern California, Drumcell has been
influenced by music from his earliest years. After
being exposed to raves in the early 90s, He grew
addicted to the sounds of acid house, techno, in its
many forms, and industrial.
 
It was not long before he was copping turntables to
satisfy his vinyl fetish. By the early age of 14 he
was playing in various local bands, and through out
the rest of his teenage years, cut his teeth-producing
hip hop records, dub and various forms of electronic
music on Los Angeles based underground labels. By
combining his production, DJing and networking skills
and focusing in on his more mature musical tastes he
soon established himself as one of the major players
in LA's growing techno scene.
 
Associating with the members of Acid Circus to form
Droid Behavior as an event production group and record
label was the next logical step to raise awareness for
techno in the city and to help expose local Artists,
established djs, and performers from around the
country.
 
Over the last 5 years Drumcell has rocked parties from
big to small on a weekly basis in LA as well as gigs
all over the U.S alongside such names as Kenny Larkin,
John Tejada, Tim Xavier, Daniel Bell, Ben Sims, Adam
Beyer, Jeff Mills, Speedy J, Ritchie Hawtin, Mathew
Dear, etc. and has also released quite a few heavy
tracks on labels Omniscient, Remains, Heavy
Industries, and his own DROID Recordings imprint.
 
Drumcell has been known to keep on the edge of
technology and be continuously pushing the limits to
what the future has to offer.  He is always in the
process of developing homebrew software as well as
cutting edge hardware solution to bring a fresh
innovative taste to his production and performances.
When performing, Drumcell can be seen blurring the
lines between a live and a DJ set by utilizing tools
such as FX processors, samplers, drum machines and
other devices  to weave a thick blend of acidic techno
and aggressive but funky minimalist groove to ensure a
frenzy amongst his listeners.
 
With the state of electronic music in North America
leaning towards stripped down funk rather then
progressive fluff these days, Droid has become the
center for LA techno and Drumcell remains steadfast in
his mission of putting this city on the global map.

yeah - sorry about that.  unforseen sound issues on the bus
forced us to shut things off earlier than expected - two of our
DJs weren't able to play.  :(

but we had an awesome time nonetheless!  thanks everyone for
coming out!  i think i'm still hung over, it was that fun.

Subject: [sfraves] Happy 5th of July/ My 4th Review

So I hope y'all had a Groovy 4th & sooooooooo sooo sooo sorry I couldn't
make it Mighty... i mean... school is back in session for me & I kinda
gotta cut back on some off the yummy.. but not all :)  Biggups to EB &
everyone who went!!  Sounded fuckin' Dope :)  YAAAY

So on the 4th,i was kinda confuzed on what to do 'cause it was either
Happy Hardcore @ Blakes or like see my Homies Warner Drive perform @
Rockit Room in the Richmond... I was 80% set on goin' to the City, but
last minute decided on Blakes... so my Lil Homie Rauol came along & we
kicked it...

OK.. so sets went like this... Gozingzzingzzibah played a strait scarry
ass mondo wicked hardcore set that oooh YUM!! Ummmm... Joshua & DJ OMB
strait spun this yummy Jungle set which was Groovy & all & I dmao during
this set, but i dunno, their track selection kinda blew 'cause they played
alota tunes w/ these hella long ass instrmental break downs & i dunno...
after the like 7th time that happen, it was like wtf... i mean... & that
OMD DJ girlie.. she was hella bad ass & stuff, but kinda kept wrecking &
yada yada yada...

after taht, No Left turn spun this yummy HHC set w/ alota his own OG
tracks & WOW!!!  Reese got on next & switched it up w/ the Jungle & the
HHC, so that was like WOW!!  Again... i danced harder to this set 'cause
of the Jungle!  CrackerJack was up last & strait played thius Anthem
Cheese filled HHC set... I swear... i never heard sooo many 80s SLow Jams
& Power  Ballads done HHC style!!  LoL.. it was fun!!  The whole night i
pretty danced & danced more..

So like there was a good 50-60 people that showed up & grooved!!  Saw
alota old Homies & made friends w/ the newbies i met.. LOL.. OK.. like i
have not seen that many Candy kids @ Blakes since Ascension was a monthly
& it went to 6 in the morning in the Basement :P  But it was Cute!!!  I
mean... like everyone there brought this Awesome vibe w/ them & the music
& dancing just made it yummy... there were oooh... i need to explain
somehting....

So i kinda came up w/ this like term for like well.. so I call these
certain bread of like Candy kid Girlies.. i call them the Brenda Raver
Girls 'cause like they're like the ummm... glammed out, retro candy kids 
ya konw, like kinda costume lookin' tryin to hard to be over dressed 
candy kids chicas dealie...

so there were like groups of Brenda Raver Girl Candy Kids there last
night... then this huge group of hippy raver stoner boy candy kids were
there too... it was fun.. Rauol had a good time & said it was the most fun

HIGH CALIBER: DJ BRYAN JONES & MIKE GILLENWATER (Control Recordings, Chicago)
Wrapping up his international Step Back 2007 Tour, DJ Bryan Jones joins Mike Gillenwater as High Caliber, originally formed in late 2002. Both artists hail from Chicago where theyve independently established themselves as icons in the Funky House scene. Five years and nearly 20 chart-busting EPs later, High Caliber is releasing their biggest project to date: Old School Sessions, a four-part all-digital mix series that was too long to condense into one album. Catch tracks from this new groundbreaking series along with other HC classics for a floor-rocking experience San Francisco will surely not forget!

As one of the Wicked DJs, Jeno helped define an eclectic and soulful musical style that was the original sound of San Francisco.

WTF are CaliGrown Events?

Were a spin-off of a former Central Valley UG rave crew called Elysium from the
late 90s - early 00s. Elysium produced several events in the Central Valley, and
some in the Bay Area including a residence at the now infamous Hotel Ibiza in
2001. We produce events out of love for the music and the vibe its followers carry.

Well, I thought they were there making sure us 'mericans were all safe from 
those nasty Terrorists, rooting out those nasty WMD's - but since even Bush 
admitted THAT was bullshit, I was just trying to makes a guess as to why 
they might be abroad, dying and being wounded left and right.

And now begin the kissing of my pasty white ass.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

I downloaded the Alex Jones podcast for July 3 and I guess he's on  
vacation or something and it was the Jeff Rense show and he had  
Webster Griffin Tarpley on they were talking about this pardon and how  
it's the most blatant abuse of power yet and they made a side comment  
about how Bush is the current tenant in the White House, he's really  
only filling a vacancy, I guess the latter is my personal comment.

Have a nice weekend.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: 'Reasons Unknown', by Tim Daly 

Reasons Unknown

When Tony met Georgie
He saw blood in his eye
And knew in that instant
That Iraq had to die
So the challenge was made!
The gauntlet was thrown!
The fighting was started
For reasons unknown

They went through the motions
Like dung beetles of war
They were deaf to the people
And blind to the law
What harvest was reaped?
What seeds had been sown?
What faith was abandoned?
For reasons unknown

So they played with their soldiers
As boys often will
Turned lovers to fighters
And forced them to kill
What arrogance this!
Egos overblown!
To have placed themselves high
For reasons unknown.

I would like to extend my greatest appreciation to those that turned out last night; hope you like what we're about and will return to our
next event.

I also have to throw some serious props down to Eyezmind, Jazette, Terry & the  the Viberation Crew, along with KNOW:AUDIO, David @ Radiant Atmosphere, just Osby, Josh, Aubrey, GOGO pro, and  the rest of the DJ's & staff that went above & beyond the call of duty in name of the party. 

An extra token of gratitude as well to Olivier Abbeloos for accepting our invitation to visit San Francisco, not to mention flying half-way across world to play AND producing a special track just for the party! Extra thanks as well to High Caliber for showing up and reppin' some jacked-up, old skool Chicago Funky House, and Eric Spire for the "surprise offer" when he heard about the party.

EVERY set rocked, and thank you again to those of you that showed up.

Sincerely,

chuck_G

Subject: RE: [sfraves] a special thanks from CaliGrown Events

I was absolutely blown away at the level of professionalism you guys showed 
for a 1st event. I wish the numbers would have been greater for you, but 
everyone I know who went had a good time, and I think that counts more in 
the end.

>From a DJ's perspective, you guys had your shit together. Great sound, 
awesome decor/set design, bangin' visuals...plus all the perks that only 
serve to sweeten the deal. We were impressed for sure.

I think any of the people that played last night would be more than happy to 
offer their services for CaliGrown again.

Thanks so much for all the hospitality and for a bumpin' night of good 
music!!!

Subject: [sfraves]  WR: My BBQ, Funky Groovy, Donut Chocolate Milk Sat/Sun

So like Saturday started out goin' to a house warming BBQ shindig.. Groovy
house, oooh... food so good, drink here & there, & what's funny is that i
used to work like 2 block away from where they live... it was good seein'
alota Familia chillin'!  Good seein' people i ain't seen in a while...
Congrats again BTE :)  Oooooooh.. the funny thing about the new pad is
that it's next door to a preschool & I just wanted to hop over the fence &
play in their lil black top park :)

OK... there was alota yummy events in SOMA alone on Sat night... but i
kinda forgot about all them when i got to Fat City!  I serioulsy kept
reminding myself to say hi to the Jungle & Techno & Anu & End up... but i
just totally forgot man... soorry Techno & Jungle :(  But yeah... it was a
fun night @ Fat City!!  Seeing alota Familia there & old skool faces who
ain't been out in forever was So Yummy!!!

Aaaaaall the DJs totally tore it up!  I mean... I danced alot!!  Ummm... I
remember when Congo Mongo started spinning, his like 2nd, 3rd song was
this tune that had samples of this Disco song from the 70s/ early 80s
called "Dancing In My Sleep" like it had alota the music all chopped up &
made house & melodic... it was Dope! :)  I remember Eric Spire's set was
this Yummy kinda Disco-ie-ish, sometimes kinda dark & triballie House & it
was Ill!!  I remember like dancing to exuastion to his set 'cause i was
sooo tired already kinda but his beats were sooo damn yummy!!  Jeno spun
like this Dope Deep house set then like got all crazy from the middle to
end & I swore, he even dropped this electro ch00nz in his set, & I tried
to call him out on it, but he said he didn't & it w3as all house!  Grrr..
Hello 2day!  OK... all the music in the main room was good, & all the DJs
tore it up... but those are the specifics I can recall atm :)

In the side room... like ok ... from what i remember... Mario Brothers
tore it up!! I danced for a while in that room when they wre on 'cause it
was just woooo!!  Ooooh yeah... Aaron Jae started out the night in that
room & fucki'n brought it so hard w/ his yummy!!!  OK.. Finger Monsters
fuck shit up w/ their techno, electro, breaks, mashie, yummy live set!!! 
The Ambient Hip Hop after from the Mafia really was Dope too!!!  I mean...
i usual don't remember to sit when well... like lately anyway when i 'm @
a party, i forget to sit & I'm always like dancing or standing & talking..
but it was nice to sit for the Mafia playing just nice Chill tunes!

OK... I have to say... Hello 2day... it was soooooo fuckin' Awesome

like kickin' it w/ ERic & talkin' about eeeeeeeeeeeeeverything!! 
Seriously man... I got Bigt Love for you Homie!!!  It was sooo fuckin'
Dope like fuck.. Hello 2Day.. just strait kickin' it!!  His fiance Tiffany

Oh yeah.. so i finally got to officially like officially meet fuckin'
Chuck G!!  OK... he's not a Chinese person like i thought he was when i
met him @ Tonal... which kinda led to the fact that i went up to all the
Asain guys @ Tonal & why none of them were him... 'cause he's not Asain! 
Hello 2Day! But it was just Dope meeting him, hangin' out, & just
YAAAAAAAAY!!! LOLOLMAO.. ok.. hyper.. kinda late right now to post, but
I'm hella stuck on weekend hours right now...

It was fun hangin' w/ everyone who was there all night long!  Ranger :P 
But yeah.. morning came, helped out, then waited in Chuck's car for
another car to come which was fine 'cause I hella needed to kill time b4
BART opened.. LOL.. it was hella fun man 'cause the sleep dep & mondo
hella tired from dancing caught up to me @ that moment that morning & I
just started getting silly fuckin' hyper & laughing sooo much!!

So they all left, we left the club, i walked down Harrison to like just
take the long way & decided that a donut & chocolate milk @ All Star would
totally hit the spot & it sooooo Did!!!  YUM!!!  I hella had to go pee & @
Allstar, you need a key to use the bathroom outside & the bathroom lock
was sooo busted & couldn't get in.. oh well!  But i made it home by 10AM
like i usually do after my gypsy raver adventures.. but there was really
no adventure that Sunday Morn...

Ooooooooooooh... i forgot to mention... so like there was a VIP Lounge in
the loft thingie @ the club & YUM!!  There were food platers & I pigged
out on Swiss Cheese like the whole night.. infact...i stole all the Swiss
Cheese for myself :)  Well.. & Roni wanted some too :)  But yeah... lol...

What are some good places to go in Vegas?  I'm going to try and head down
there for my bday in a couple of weeks with the fiance, and we want to go
out and have fun.  I know it's all over priced as shit, but i think i'll be
able to afford some fun.  I want at least one night of clubbing, the other
night will be a fancy dinner and vegas show type of thing.

So what clubs are going to be the most fun with the least wallet drain and
best drinks?

Subject: [sfraves] Almost there....

And now for something completely different....

Not a Star Wars post, sorry.

I'm glad I didn't take the bet that Barry Bonds was gonna break Aaron's
home run record before the All-Star break, but man, oh, man, did he come
close.

751, with only 4 more to go.

So what if he's not a nice person, neither was John Lennon.

Let's show him the love that he's earned.

It's a damn shame, and bullshit, that he's being rail-roaded for using
performance enhancing drugs, as if half the country isn't loaded up on
prescriptions of one kind or another to enhance their performance or
otherwise improve their lives.

I would give Lance Armstrong's left testicle to end this nonsense and
completely ban all drug testing in every major league sport.

It's be cool to see someone run a 100 meter dash in 5 seconds, jump 50+
feet and run a 3 minute mile.

I'm sure a lot of people would pay mucho dinero to see that, too.

I think there should be two leagues.... With juice and
without... Would be like WWE for baseball, football,
etc... You'd see 800 ft home runs, 120 mph fast balls,
people tearing arms off of the running backs to stop
them, and yes, the 3 minute mile....

If you wanna see the "real" thing... then you could at
least choose.

The question is, who would play in the "real" league.   I really doubt that
users of performance enhancing substances are in the minority in MLB.  I
wouldn't be surprised if 90% of the yankees are on something.

The Yankees are hardly better than their farm system this year.  So  
much for the largest payroll in the game!  What does it get you??  A  
game under .500 and 10 out of first.  Awesome.

Yah, we're only half way thru the regular season.  I don't know what it is,
but come august and september, something lights a fire under their arses-
and they always seem to make it into the playoffs one year or another.  What
happened to the Yankees of the 80's???  I liked them a lot more!

I don't think there are many fun clubs with little wallet drain 
in Vegas, except when there are big conventions like G2E and you 
can get in when they have open bars :-)

Olympic Gardens, hehe, yeah that place is great in the early 
afternoon, no cover.

Paula and I will be there 1st week of August, you may find us 
at:

Pure (Caesars)
Baby's (Hard Rock)
Scores & Sapphire (Boobies :-)
Ghostbar (Palms)
I also hear Palms has a really cool nighttime pool party.

Drai's was cool but it's afterhours only, not sure what it's 
like since Barbary Coast became Bill's.

We'll probably be having dinner at the Wynn, only been to their 
buffet so far. The rest of time we'll be eating on the super 
cheap.

Vegas...wheeeee!!!

Thanks Chuck and the Caligrown crew for throwing such a lavish 
event. Everything about the parrty was leveled-up, from the 
upgraded sound, production, vip area, to those gosh-darn go-go 
girls (like woah!). Certainly could have used some more heads, 
but hopefully now people know you guys mean business with this 
party throwing stuff.

Nice seeing Eric Spire again after so many years :-)

Here a quick video of the stage setup:

that's true this is not a democracy.  it's a constitutional  
republic.  and this scooter libby pardon doesn't make me want to burn  
the american flag.  that's just baby talk in my opinion, the flag  
represents all the founding fathers struggled and died for.  but they  
also warned not to trust government so we can expect more tyranny  
until enough people rise up and say no to it.

hey i was listening to jeff rense the other night and he interviewed  
webster griffin tarpley talking about the constitutional convention  
in philadelphia just across the street from where the original  
constitution was signed.  also some of their spots had cindy sheehan  
and michael moore in them and coined the phrase "the second american  
revolution".  i don't know i think it has a good ring to it.

By Ben Hirschler

LONDON (Reuters) - The sun's changing energy levels are not to blame for
recent global warming and, if anything, solar variations over the past 20
years should have had a cooling effect, scientists said on Wednesday.

Their findings add to a growing body of evidence that human activity, not
natural causes, lies behind rising average world temperatures, which are
expected to reach their second highest level this year since records began
in the 1860s.

There is little doubt that solar variability has influenced the Earth's
climate in the past and may well have been a factor in the first half of the
last century, but British and Swiss researchers said it could not explain
recent warming.

"Over the past 20 years, all the trends in the sun that could have had an
influence on Earth's climate have been in the opposite direction to that
required to explain the observed rise in global mean temperatures," they
wrote in the Proceedings of the Royal Society....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] a special thanks from CaliGrown Events

You guys did a great job with all the logistics. Setup
was dope, sound was nice, and everyone I met that had
anything to do with BACK ON TRACK was totally fuckin
cool. I hope it is a nice building block for you guys.

It was rad meeting all kinds of old SFRAVERS... Dug
the LIVE sets in the back room. I was wondering how
they were going to be set up, and it was cool to see a
bunch of different technologies being sync''d and
lynk'd the way they were. Said hi to everyone there
while they were playing, but I doubt they had the time
to realize I was introducing myself.... and Marco
never bought me a beer ( or two for that matter....)
Terry's setup has "evolved" since I lasty saw it, so
that was great to see too... and of course meeting the
infamous Osby was perfect. Mr. Stickman ;) .... and
actually quite a few more...

My friends from Vegas had a great time kickin it with
everyone upstairs. I was stoked to have some people
drive from Tahoe and Monterey to say hello and support
the show...

We just basically had a good time and felt very
welcome.

Thanks Chuck.

Subject: [sfraves] this saturday - it's the end of the world... (BSP)

THIS Saturday!!
WHAT: Apocalypse!
WHAT: Fandango's End-of-the-World Party
WHERE: The Pr0n Palace, 415 Jessie St., San Francisco
WHEN: Saturday, July 14, 2007, 9pm-?
WHO: The Friends, and Friends-of-Friends, of Fandango.
COST: $10 to $20, sliding scale.
WHY: Fundraiser for Fandango Village infrastructure at Burning
Man (Bars, Trucks, Booze, Trash, Furnishings, Booze, Lumber,
Trash)

How is the World going to End? Will it be the
seemingly-inevitable Zombie apocalypse? Will we all fight each
other to the death over a few precious drops of gasoline? Will
the world snuff it in a Biblical plague of locusts and
Hellfire? Will the toxic sludge of our corporate paymasters
give rise to a new brand of avenger? Or will we all have to
sprout gills after the ice caps melt, leaving us with nothing
but a horrible, watery-world?

We don't know, but we hope you'll help us figure it out at
Apocalypse!, Fandango's 2007 Fundraiser. Two different dance
floors will feature Fandango's Apocalypse DJs. You have limited
time, so make good use of it on the dancefloor.

Osby, Eric, Marco, other listees, etc,  et al, etc.

You all have pretty much said it.  Fun party, great music, and100% super nice people.  Great to meet Eric and Tiffany from Vegas!

I attended with my friend Mark who immediately proceeded to start ordering extremely strong drinks for me. But I avoided the Frenet.

We heard some great music...I especially enjoyed High Caliber and the Mario bros.  I also liked the Fingermonsters!   Although I understand they were missing one finger or something.  Interesting to watch them work it live!  It was more entertaining than I expected having seen other "laptop" bands previosuly.

At some point the bar closed and Mark and I were too inebriated to remain at the party so it was time to go.  I got extremely drunk on cheap vodka and I was feeeling *NASTY* for a couple of days afterrward.  Hoo boy.  The mind is willing but the liver ain't...

Osby --  :P

That is all.

You guys did a great job with all the logistics. Setup
was dope, sound was nice, and everyone I met that had
anything to do with BACK ON TRACK was totally fuckin
cool. I hope it is a nice building block for you guys.

It was rad meeting all kinds of old SFRAVERS... Dug
the LIVE sets in the back room. I was wondering how
they were going to be set up, and it was cool to see a
bunch of different technologies being sync''d and
lynk'd the way they were. Said hi to everyone there
while they were playing, but I doubt they had the time
to realize I was introducing myself.... and Marco
never bought me a beer ( or two for that matter....)
Terry's setup has "evolved" since I lasty saw it, so
that was great to see too... and of course meeting the
infamous Osby was perfect. Mr. Stickman ;) .... and
actually quite a few more...

My friends from Vegas had a great time kickin it with
everyone upstairs. I was stoked to have some people
drive from Tahoe and Monterey to say hello and support
the show...

We just basically had a good time and felt very
welcome.

Thanks Chuck.

Subject: [sfraves] Wicked analog studio gear for sale

Sorry I wouldn't normally repost but this looks kinda big. I 
recognize some of the components but that's about it. That 
Powermac 7100 is worth nothing, I still have 1 in my garage 
collecting dust.

Anyways....

Garth's Analogue Studio Gear For Sale
Body: 	Want to own a piece of San Francisco DJ history?

After much soul-searching I've decided to let go of my analogue 
studio setup.

This is the same gear I produced all of the Wicked and Grayhound 
singles on.

I'm looking for a serious buyer/collector. Ideally I'd like to 
sell it in one go as a working studio.

Here's a list of the gear for sale...

ROLAND CHORUS ECHO RE 501 (ANALOGUE TAPE DELAY/ECHO/REVERB)
ROLAND 303 (ANALOGUE ACID BASS SYNTH MODULE)
ROLAND R8 (ANALOGUE RHYTHM COMPOSER W/SOUND CARDS)
2 X ENSONIQ DP2S (PARALLEL EFFECTS PROCESSOR)
2 X BEHRINGER COMPOSERS (DYNAMICS PROCESSOR)
EMU E64 (DIGITAL SAMPLER W/FULLY EXPANDED MEMORY)
NOVATION DRUM STATION (ANALOGUE 909 & 808 SYNTH RACK)
EMU CLASSIC KEYS (ANALOGUE SYNTH RACK)
SOUNDCRAFT GHOST (24 CHANNEL/8 BUS ANALOGUE MIXING CONSOLE)
DESIGNER MIXER & KEYBOAD STAND (CUSTOM BUILT IN STEEL)
POWERMAC 7100 (DESKTOP COMPUTER W/SOUNDCARD)
* ALL MANUALS/WIRES & LEADS INCLUDED

Everything is in good working condition. The studio has always 
been smoke-free and all the gear looks like new except for the 
Roland bits which are vintage. They work wonderfully but look 
like they've seen some action in the 30 years they've been in 
service (and they ain't lying).

$15,000 OBO is the asking price for everything. Sold as-is. No 
time wasters please.

Want this? Go find him on MySpace here:

Yeah, good luck in selling this all together.  The only real interesting
"analogue" synth is the 303.  The rest of the gear is mostly generic and
outdated.

I mean, I at least expected a moog or something.

OMG, thanks for this post.  I have been dealing with ringing in my left ear
for a while now.  I am going to try some of these remedies that are posted
and see if it works.

a friend claims that beta carotene helps tinnitus as well,
though i haven't been diligent enough to take it regularly and
try it out for myself.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Wicked analog studio gear for sale

Hehe...  I love Garth, but this sale, it is to laugh.

Here's a breakdown of the most this gear is worth:

ROLAND CHORUS ECHO RE 501       $4-500
ROLAND 303                                               $1000
ROLAND R8                                                 $50-100
2 X ENSONIQ DP2S                                 $50-100 x 2
2 X BEHRINGER COMPOSERS            $40 x 2
EMU E64                                                         $300 (but tough to find a buyer these days)
NOVATION DRUM STATION                     $150-200
EMU CLASSIC KEYS                                    $50-100
SOUNDCRAFT GHOST                                 $1000
DESIGNER MIXER & KEYBOAD STAND $200?
POWERMAC 7100                                            $50
Cables 'n' junk                                                        $50

Which, at its most blown-out and crazy, comes to $3780, which is still far more than he'll ever fetch for this.

Poor guy, he's better off keeping the best bits, selling off all the junk and getting a new laptop and audio interface to work with.  He's gonna miss that space echo and 303.

I thought the same thing but came up with $2K.  At least I now know  
why all his stuff sounded wispy and "default" sounding...  Crap gear.

I always wanted one of those Roland Space Echo boxes after watching  
Alexi Delano fiddle with his at his NY studio.  Fucking awesome.   
Worth $15K.  Uh...no.

I'm somewhat hard of hearing now.  I talked loud naturally but now I'm 
really loud and most of the time completely unaware of it.

I don't hear ringing.  I don't hear much of anything.  :( :(

Subject: Re: [sfraves] what ringing?

So... I've wondered this for some time....

I have used "Ear Candles" on occasion to clean my
ears. I can never tell if there is a difference in
hearing afterward. Sometimes there is yellowy wax at
the candle base when I have finished burning the
candle.

So here's the question... Is the wax a bi-product of
the candle, or is it really drawn-out ear wax?

I honestly think it is wax from the candle itself...
But am not convinced enough that I haven't ruled out
there use. I thought of turning it over to
Myth-Busters.

Anyone know?

Think about it for just a sec-

The claim is that the candle creates a vacuum, but unless you've got a  
punctured eardrum your ear is sealed.
So without any air movement nothing can be drawn out, which is what would  
happen if you make a tight seal- the candle burning only in the air it can  
pull around the top.
If you *don't make a tight seal, then air will get sucked in from around  
the base of it.
In other words, they're entirely full of shit.
But take a pic next time you use one!

Stephen Colbert, and more 2 the point, Mr. Wizard might have a thing 2 
say about that:

http://www.ifilm.com/video/2867766/show/17677

On another note, though still health related, George C. Scott's "The 
Hospital" is on TCM @ 8pm tmw night.

Set yr DVR.

http://www.tcmdb.com/title/title.jsp?stid=17589

When the director and writer of "The Hospital" got together they asked 
themselves:

'what is the most improbable thing we can put in this pic, that no one 
would *ever* believe?!?'

and their answer was,

'nobody will ever believe that someone was allowed to die in an American 
hospital because they couldn't pay for their treatment.'

So they put it in, and in the course of a generation, it's become a 
daily reality, in all 50 States.

How cool is that?

God Bless America.

All others, see the cashier on your way out.

Thank you.

On a personal note, I first saw this movie in my Grandparents kitchen in 
Slovenia, (the country, that, like Cuba today, is right about on par 
with where the USA USA USA is on the the global healthcare rankings, the 
high 30s, how pathetic is that?), on a crappy 13" b&W TV.

For some reason the very last scene of dude on a gurney while the world 
passed him by has left an indelible, lifetime, impression.

Not bad for a "B" from the early 1970s.

Who knew?

This little girl (age 2-3) was given ecstasy a.k.a (x, adam, "e", etc.) as the passengers in the car yell it out. You have to hear closely.This video was first spotted on the popular site youtube.com. Then it was reported several times & is now under investigation.

POLICE ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE PASSENGERS
This is so Disgusting & is abuse!! Last night it was on Nancy Grace's CNN show & people are starting to get involved with this crucial case. It just makes you want to do something. A sad story indeed.

Last I read on the http://www.chron.com. Everyone was found 
including the young girl and they are all being drug-tested.

I saw the video and it's really disturbing to me. If this is 
real I hope the next story I read is the mom & her friends are behind bars.

As a parent and general proponent of freedom of consciousness I also found that video very distrurbing.  

Except that maybe it was all a very bad joke: http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007Jul11/0,4670,ToddlerVideo,00.html

I know I know Fox news...

Peace,

Peter

Last I read on the http://www.chron.com. Everyone was found 
including the young girl and they are all being drug-tested.

I saw the video and it's really disturbing to me. If this is 
real I hope the next story I read is the mom & her friends are behind bars.

FYI...

Actually you don't need to watermark the video to trace it back to the camera of origin in many cases.

See http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Research/EI5685-29_Forensic.pdf

Google Jessica Fridrich, she's the leading expert on this stuff.

Peace,

Peter

If a variant of this digital watermark tracking tech in laser printers

cameras, then it's easy to find the obviously retarded people that post 
stuff like this, and bring them to justice.

Well good, then we've got a way to track Al Qaeda then everytime they 
drop off a damned tape at Al-Jazeera.

If this is the case, then getting Osama should be a snap.

Thank god my government's on the case.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cow Hollow Muggings on the Rise

>From a friend:

Hello All-

For those that don't know Matt and I were mugged at gun point Monday night 
at 10:30 in front of our house.  We are OK and Jake was inside with the baby 
sitter, thank goodness, but we wanted to share our story so our friends and 
neighbors could also be aware that this could happen at any time to any of 
us and to be alert, especially at night.

Here are the details of what happened to us:

As we rounded the corner of Octavia from Greenwich and approached the front 
of our house, two men wearing skeleton masks, black hooded sweatshirts, and 
carrying what looked like a semi-automatic weapon (we don't know guns well 
but it had a clip), approached us and told us to give them our valuables.  
We were caught a little off-guard, not expecting something like this to 
happen, and sort of hesitated.  They started yelling that they would shoot 
us in the face and I handed over my purse.  Matt reached for his wallet and 
they knocked his hand away and went through his pockets and took his wallet. 
  They finally took off down Greenwich St, at which point we called the 
police.  It all happened so fast and we honestly never saw it coming until 
the gun was in our faces.  Thank God that we were not hurt and Jake was not 
with us but this could have been any one of us and it could have been worse. 
  The next day there was a report of a 65 yr old man that was shot in the 
900 block of Filbert (a few blocks away) in a botched burglary about 30 
minutes after we were held up.  He is still in the hospital.

We want to inform our friends and neighbors of this incident and let them 
know that we should all be careful.  We believe they were watching from a 
hidden spot and picked us out as targets.  We weren't paying particular 
attention as we were walking and had our guard down.  We also believe they 
most likely had a get away car around the corner because they disappeared 
quickly.  We were told that gangs 'work' this area as it's considered 
affluent and it's assumed that most people are carrying some money with 
them. Since we've started sharing our story with others we've heard back 
other accounts of recent muggings, hold ups, and even an attempted 
kidnapping of a woman that happened in broad daylight on Union and Lyon 
Streets.  Attached is even another account of a recent hold up sent to us by 
a friend.

Please be careful out there and remember that even though we all live in 
relatively safe neighborhoods, we are not immune to the perils of living in 
a big city!!

Subject: [sfraves] Hyphy jungle?

Where have the twain met in the bay area?

I mean, you hear hyphy everywhere. You can go to a bar in a suburban
neighborhood and hear the thizzle dance. And I've been seeing the
hyphy kids at plurtard parties for years. I remember a skinny white
kid at the dungeon showing me the 'cupertino thizz' handshake and
thoroughly filthifying my hands in the process... and the young hoods
selling shitty ecstasy have been patrolling the same subscene for as
long as I can remember.

But how about musically? I've heard of a couple club nights, and heard
some hyphy stuff being dropped with ragga and jungle at a spot called
The Hatch... but is there any serious hyphy-jungle hybrid being
germinated in some dark corner of Oakland? Maybe some crossover MCs?

Sounds like CPS is involved now so who knows what will happen at this point.  There is the issue of driving with a kid not in a safety seat, but of course when I grew up there weren't any safety seats at all.

This story says no charges will be filed unless drugs were actually involved:

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] Sat 7.14:: 5 Hr DJ Set by Kontakt :: Fri 7.27 Adjunct-Audio Night w/ Apendics.Shuffle at Anu

Both Anu and the Retox Lounge are quickly becoming fast favorites for
intimate, affordable techno get togethers. Check out these events
Saturday at the Retox Lounge and Friday, July 27 at Anu:


SAT 7/14 :: Kontakt 5 Hour MNML Techno DJ Set:: No Cover
Saturday, July 14, 2007
9:00 PM to 2:00 AM
Retox Lounge
620 20th St X 3rd Street in S.F.
More Info: www.freqbox.net

BABD/Filter resident Kontakt will take us on a five hour psychotropic
minimal techno tour this Saturday at the Retox Lounge's monthly Low
End party.

About Kontakt:

Kontakt is BABD's co-founder and resident DJ, dedicated to bringing a
deeper, more abstrakt sound to the Bay Area's rediscovered techno
scene. In the past year alone, he has launched seven one-off events,
two weeklies (Fukwerk Friday + Low End Saturdays) and one monthly
(FilterSF at Fat City).

He has played alongside internationally acclaimed techno innovators
Pheek, Miskate, Someone Else, Mikael Stavostrand, Butane, Fumiya
Tanaka and Joel Mull.

Enjoy ample parking, no cover and cheap drinks plus live bands
downstairs in the basement.


Then, on FRIDAY, July 27, head to Anu for LA's [a]pendics.shuffle +
guests where laptops are sure to go wild in a digital orgy of freaky
beat madness:

[a]pendics.shuffle (live PA) + Konstantin Gabbro [Adjunct-Audio/LA]
Friday, July 27, 2007
9:00 PM - 2:00 AM
Cover: $5

Anu
43 Sixth St
San Francisco, California 94102

West Coast minimal techno label Adjunct-Audio label features founders
[a]pendics.shuffle and Konstantin Gabbro (Los Angeles)

Plus opening DJ sets by Kontakt + Solekandi (BABD, Filter.SF)

One of the early West Coast evangelists of minimal techno, Konstantin
Gabbro is the founder of Seattle's homegrown Orac Records, a label
that launched Bruno Pronsato and Kenneth James Gibson's
[a]pendics.shuffle moniker into the realm of the international
techorati.

In 2003 Konstantin moved down the Pacific Coast to Los Angeles where
he and Gibson (KJG) launched another label =96 Adjunct - a forward
thinking techno outlet that releases critically acclaimed collectibles
from names such as John Tejada, Pheek and newcomer Altiply.

A combination of Gabbro's well-schooled knowledge of deconstructed,
experimental techno with Gibson's mojo-laden epic Live PA sets goes
well beyond their description of "funky computer music" into the
sublime.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cow Hollow Muggings on the Rise

Wow, this is totally messed up. Some of my fondest and happiest memories 
of when I first moved to SF and was a live aboard a 27 foot sail boat on 
Marina Green, (unlimited, abundant, FREE parking!!!), and Cow Shallow 
and The Bermuda Triangle @ Fillmore & Greenwich was my stomping ground. 
I never once felt unsafe.

In counterpoint, I offer this recent true story of a robbery that went 
in an unexpected direction: http://tinyurl.com/23yl6p

Subject: [sfraves] [recommended] Andy Slate :: Wed :: Anu

During the 90's, German producer, remixer and DJ Andy Slate was
responsible for bringing the biggest names in techno such as Josh Wink
and Jeff Mills to new audiences in Hungary.

With a heavy collection of releases and remixes under his belt, Slate
works with Tim Taylor (Missle Records London) on studio projects in
both New York and Budapest, producing club-wise stompers worthy of
notice.

Slate takes a well-seasoned approach to dance-floor friendly techno
and minimal that will keep your feet moving. His intuitive track
progression allows for both ruff techno riffs, emotive moments and
deeper moods of house.

Ok, well - downtown I'd suggest:

Rye on 688 Geary Street

or it's sister bar

Swig on 561 Geary St.

Or House of Shields on 39 New Montgomery St.

Beyond that I am more familiar w/ the Richmond Disctrict and it's haunts, 
which there quite a few of in the vein you are lookin' for. Lemme know if 
you want my suggestions there...

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Hi all,
 
 I thought I'd be able to use the KP3 for music production, but I'm finding that using automation within Live is much more useful, and the KP3 is more useful for effects while performing.  I'm selling my Korg Kaoss Pad KP3.  It's brand new and has only been used a couple times, and never taken to an event.  Have all paperwork, box, etc.
 
 Selling for $370

No Vinyl?!? Not a DJ product to me, just a fancy CD mixing station.

All you digital music mixers (CDs, Mp3s, etc) can all go jump off a cliff.
Bring back the true analog artists of vinyl and instruments I say!

I understand your undying affinity for vinyl, but why do you constantly
write off any other form of dj'ing/live remixing???

When house/techno came about through the use of samplers, drum machines, and
sequencers, several people including many prominent musicians tried to tell
us the creation was somehow not worthy of being titled as "music."   The
people who were responsible for creating and innovating these sounds
embraced the new technology of the era.  With dance music's foundation for
the producer and dj alike in high technology, I find it at peculiar so many
old school jocks automatically shun so much new technology.   I guess I just
hear similar hypocrisy now days when I compare it to our critics 20 years
ago.

when the piano was invented, some said it wasn't a real instrument  
because the players hands didn't touch the strings.

some peeps just like to hate on new stuff. it's called being  
"conservative".

My only gripe with digital formats was that it lost the natural feel of
playing with vinyl. I have Serato now, though, so that problem was solved
and with it my only real objection to digital formats.

I can't speak for anyone else, but that's why I don't like cdjs and other
not natural feeling formats.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Ultimate DJ setup /w pix please!!!

You obviously have never had to lug huge bags of records around the country 
for gigs...

I was a vinyl purist all the way up until this year - until I kept getting 
sent exclusive promo tracks in MP3 format, and until I had access to a CDJ.

>From a working DJ's perspective - or at least THIS working DJ's perspective, 
the pros for CD FAR outweigh the cons.

I can get an entire SET in an afternoon of downloading.
I can carry several "crates" worth of tracks in a single CD book.
I don't have to wait for vinyl releases - and in fact, I can get material 
that will NEVER be released on vinyl.
I don't have to suck up all the available storage in my house with the black 
crack.
A 320KBPS MP3 or a WAV sounds every bit as good over a system as vinyl. I 
have tried this on more than one sized sound system, and I just can't tell 
any significant difference. (although lower bitrate files CAN sound like 
low-pressed records)
I can digitize my entire vinyl collection and have it in an archive until 
digital goes the way of the dinosaur - vinyl is slowly being phased out in 
dance music (the notable exception being hip-hop).

So, I may jump off a cliff for fun - but not because someone who is clinging 
to the musical equivalent of BetaMax says so ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question for the vinyl-only nazis

I find working on CDJ's to be almost comparable in every way to using vinyl 
- the notable exception being it's not a visual mixing experience, so much 
as just knowing how tracks are made and when to properly mix (w/o seeing the 
drops on the record). You "count" instead of "watch" - which is actually 
much more akin to using an actual musical instrument.

Other than in competition (DMC, ITF, ect), working hip hop deejays are 
almost 100% digital. Serato has taken over.

Carl designed that mixer. He plays on it. I've been five feet from him 
and saw it. The man uses three CDJ1000s and no other input sources. Why 
would he need a fourth channel? This is the mixer in his contract. 
Although I've seen him play on a DJM800 recently as well (still only 
three CDJs).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question for the vinyl-only nazis

Oh shite, I opened the can of worms....
Screw this silly question... art is art is art... get
off your conservative high horses.
If it sounds good don't f@#$%$ with it.
Vinyl rocks to all you vinyl gurus
Digital rocks to all you CD gurus
Gear rocks to all you live gurus

I say good music is good music no matter how it's
played!! Who cares you like it ? you dance it right!?
Sorry really not intended to get into this question
for the zillionth time... just want to share a cool
pic.
Peace

Actually, its 8 inputs, 3 active mix channels, although you can route other inputs directly to main or secondary outputs too. 4 Phono and 4 Line. Each of these can be assigned to one of the three faders in any way you like. You can even do neat stuff like play the same track through all three faders at once, with different EQ and filter settings. Hours of endless entertainment tweaking :)

I have been working on booking Splitloop for over a year. Trust me - if it's

Cory Doctorow: The Progressive Apocalypse and Other Futurismic Delights
from Locus Magazine, July 2007

Of course, science fiction is a literature of the present. Many's the =20=

science fiction writer who uses the future as a warped mirror for =20
reflecting back the present day, angled to illustrate the hidden =20
strangeness buried by our invisible assumptions: Orwell turned 1948 =20
into Nineteen Eighty-Four. But even when the fictional future isn't a =20=

parable about the present day, it is necessarily a creation of the =20
present day, since it reflects the present day biases that infuse the =20=

author. Hence Asimov's Foundation, a New Deal-esque project to think =20
humanity out of its tribulations though social interventionism.

Bold SF writers eschew the future altogether, embracing a futuristic =20
account of the present day. William Gibson's forthcoming Spook =20
Country is an act of "speculative presentism," a book so futuristic =20
it could only have been set in 2006, a book that exploits =20
retrospective historical distance to let us glimpse just how alien =20
and futuristic our present day is.

Science fiction writers aren't the only people in the business of =20
predicting the future. Futurists =97 consultants, technology =20
columnists, analysts, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurial =20
pitchmen =97 spill a lot of ink, phosphors, and caffeinated hot air in =20=

describing a vision for a future where we'll get more and more of =20
whatever it is they want to sell us or warn us away from. Tomorrow =20
will feature faster, cheaper processors, more Internet users, =20
ubiquitous RFID tags, radically democratic political processes =20
dominated by bloggers, massively multiplayer games whose virtual =20
economies dwarf the physical economy.

There's a lovely neologism to describe these visions: "futurismic." =20
Futurismic media is that which depicts futurism, not the future. It =20
is often self-serving =97 think of the antigrav Nikes in Back to the =20
Future III =97 and it generally doesn't hold up well to scrutiny.

SF films and TV are great fonts of futurismic imagery: R2D2 is a =20
fully conscious AI, can hack the firewall of the Death Star, and is =20
equipped with a range of holographic projectors and antipersonnel =20
devices =97 but no one has installed a $15 sound card and some text-to-=20=

speech software on him, so he has to whistle like Harpo Marx. Or take =20=

the Starship Enterprise, with a transporter capable of constituting =20
matter from digitally stored plans, and radios that can breach the =20
speed of light.

The non-futurismic version of NCC-1701 would be the size of a =20
softball (or whatever the minimum size for a warp drive, transporter, =20=

and subspace radio would be). It would zip around the galaxy at FTL =20
speeds under remote control. When it reached an interesting planet, =20
it would beam a stored copy of a landing party onto the surface, and =20
when their mission was over, it would beam them back into storage, =20
annihilating their physical selves until they reached the next =20
stopping point. If a member of the landing party were eaten by a =20
green-skinned interspatial hippie or giant toga-wearing galactic =20
tyrant, that member would be recovered from backup by the transporter =20=

beam. Hell, the entire landing party could consist of multiple copies =20=

of the most effective crewmember onboard: no redshirts, just a half-=20
dozen instances of Kirk operating in clonal harmony.

Futurism has a psychological explanation, as recounted in Harvard =20
clinical psych prof Daniel Gilbert's 2006 book, Stumbling on =20
Happiness. Our memories and our projections of the future are =20
necessarily imperfect. Our memories consist of those observations our =20=

brains have bothered to keep records of, woven together with =20
inference and whatever else is lying around handy when we try to =20
remember something. Ask someone who's eating a great lunch how =20
breakfast was, and odds are she'll tell you it was delicious. Ask the =20=

same question of someone eating rubbery airplane food, and he'll tell =20=

you his breakfast was awful. We weave the past out of our imperfect =20
memories and our observable present.

We make the future in much the same way: we use reasoning and =20
evidence to predict what we can, and whenever we bump up against =20
uncertainty, we fill the void with the present day. Hence the =20
injunction on women soldiers in the future of Starship Troopers, or =20
the bizarre, glassed-over "Progressland" city diorama at the end of =20
the 1964 World's Fair exhibit The Carousel of Progress, which Disney =20
built for GE.

Lapsarianism =97 the idea of a paradise lost, a fall from grace that =20
makes each year worse than the last =97 is the predominant future =20
feeling for many people. It's easy to see why: an imperfectly =20
remembered golden childhood gives way to the worries of adulthood and =20=

physical senescence. Surely the world is getting worse: nothing =20
tastes as good as it did when we were six, everything hurts all the =20
time, and our matured gonads drive us into frenzies of bizarre, self-=20
destructive behavior.

Lapsarianism dominates the Abrahamic faiths. I have an Orthodox =20
Jewish friend whose tradition holds that each generation of rabbis is =20=

necessarily less perfect than the rabbis that came before, since each =20=

generation is more removed from the perfection of the Garden. =20
Therefore, no rabbi is allowed to overturn any of his forebears' =20
wisdom, since they are all, by definition, smarter than him.

The natural endpoint of Lapsarianism is apocalypse. If things get =20
worse, and worse, and worse, eventually they'll just run out of =20
worseness. Eventually, they'll bottom out, a kind of rotten death of =20
the universe when Lapsarian entropy hits the nadir and takes us all =20
with it.

Running counter to Lapsarianism is progressivism: the Enlightenment =20
ideal of a world of great people standing on the shoulders of giants. =20=

Each of us contributes to improving the world's storehouse of =20
knowledge (and thus its capacity for bringing joy to all of us), and =20
our descendants and proteges take our work and improve on it. The =20
very idea of "progress" runs counter to the idea of Lapsarianism and =20
the fall: it is the idea that we, as a species, are falling in =20
reverse, combing back the wild tangle of entropy into a neat, tidy =20
braid.

Of course, progress must also have a boundary condition =97 if only =20
because we eventually run out of imaginary ways that the human =20
condition can improve. And science fiction has a name for the upper =20
bound of progress, a name for the progressive apocalypse:

We call it the Singularity.

Vernor Vinge's Singularity takes place when our technology reaches a =20
stage that allows us to "upload" our minds into software, run them at =20=

faster, hotter speeds than our neurological wetware substrate allows =20
for, and create multiple, parallel instances of ourselves. After the =20
Singularity, nothing is predictable because everything is possible. =20
We will cease to be human and become (as the title of Rudy Rucker's =20
next novel would have it) Postsingular.

The Singularity is what happens when we have so much progress that we =20=

run out of progress. It's the apocalypse that ends the human race in =20
rapture and joy. Indeed, Ken MacLeod calls the Singularity "the =20
rapture of the nerds," an apt description for the mirror-world =20
progressive version of the Lapsarian apocalypse.

At the end of the day, both progress and the fall from grace are =20
illusions. The central thesis of Stumbling on Happiness is that human =20=

beings are remarkably bad at predicting what will make us happy. Our =20
predictions are skewed by our imperfect memories and our capacity for =20=

filling the future with the present day.

The future is gnarlier than futurism. NCC-1701 probably wouldn't send =20=

out transporter-equipped drones =97 instead, it would likely find =20
itself on missions whose ethos, mores, and rationale are largely =20
incomprehensible to us, and so obvious to its crew that they couldn't =20=

hope to explain them.

Science fiction is the literature of the present, and the present is =20
the only era that we can hope to understand, because it's the only =20
era that lets us check our observations and predictions against reality.

Cory Doctorow's website is Craphound.com, and he is co-editor of =20
Boing Boing: A Directory of Wonderful Things. Cory Doctorow is one of =20=

a dozen Locus columnists and reviewers. Every issue, we review over =20
50 books and magazines, most before they appear in print. A =20
subscription will get you all those as well as the rest of the =20

and a list of all books and magazines published that month.

 Delights, by Cory Doctorow

I believe Ray Kurzweil is right, it's change that we're going to have to 
deal with most.

Today's fastest computers run at about 5 ghz.

If Moore's Law holds at an 18 month doubling window, then by the year 
2020 the average machine will run at 1,000 ghz, and cost the same in 
real dollars.

There's no way that that won't have a profound effect on people in ways 
that we can't even begin to imagine right now.

Look at how much things have changed since Mosaic went live 12 years ago 
and gave birth to the commercial web. What do you think the next 12 
years are going to be like?

Yeah, I've read my McLuhan too, that's a major premise of his in 'The 
Medium Is The Massage.'

Short version, countries like those in Africa will be able to leap-frog 
past the West at a certain point because they won't have an installed 
technological infrastructure to scrap.

That's what the not-so-evil Negroponte is trying to do with his OLPC 
initiative.

Right now a Ghz of CPU power costs about $200 dollars, but in a few 
iterations of Moore's Law the price is going to drop dramatically, 
making that project a practical reality.

hope in meeting decent people on the omnipresent craiggers.

Craigslist, much like Kane's girlfriend/wife in Citizen Kane, is an 
accurate cross-section of the American Public, and a living indictment 
of the failure of our public school system.

I don't care how libertarian the Craigster styles himself to be, I'd 
like to see him pull the plug on the Rants& Raves section as a failed 
social experiment.

How much more evidence does one need that we've got a lot of fucked in 
the head people running around in this country?

Basta.

Enough, I say.

I seem to recall you playing Heaven Scent, or something similar at a party. :)

I don't really know what I listen to... Techno?  Techno is good.  I like Trance too.  I saw Tiesto in Vegas for NYE a few years ago.  

I like drum n bass also.  Strange Encounter by Nu:Tone is a wicked song.  As is Shadow Play by Dkay and Rawfull.

I'm currently working on a breaks song.  I think it's pretty dope.

DKay is the shit, I dig some of Nu:Tone's shit as well.

And as for you seeing me play heaven scent at a party, the only party I
remember playing trance at (in this city anyway) was Osby's warehouse
jimmy-jam, and I was only playing trance because Osby told me to. That set
is not indicative of future results. Heh.

Also, it was Lost Tribe - Gamemaster that you heard most likely. Quite
possibly the gayest trance record in the world.

I have a really decent breaks remix of Heaven Scent...uber rare style crap. 
I never have reason to break it out, but it's in the collection...

Did I say that out loud???

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Wicked analog studio gear for sale

Maybe he meant $1,500 and added and extra 0 and forgot to put the comma in 
the correct spot?

I don't know what half the gear is. But im sure with a G5 and digi002 or 4 
or whatever it is up to know and some logic and plug-ins you can produce the 
same if not way better sound for a far less price then 15k.


Maybe 15k for half of JJ and Chris Lum's studio now your talking ;-)

I figured out people were fucked up long before the internet.. So I'm 
a little lost on why I shouldn't use craigslist for anything I 
can?  It's a great resource, found me jobs, houses, food, activities...

Anyone like Larry Tee?  I just heard a great electro mix from him on the XM show Redux...

Track ID request: Larry's mix included an electro remix or rework of the Fred Everything/20 for 7 song "Friday" This electro version also had a Euthythmics sample in it if that helps.

Anyone know who did the remix?

Thnx,

Peter

Trentemoeller remix...I have it on wax.

It's on the Om Electrolush comp. too...

The guys at Tweekin' will order it for you if you ask. That's how I got my 
copy - although, as played out as it is (did I say that?) I'd prolly be 
willing to sell my copy...

have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.

It is absurd to say that our country can issue $30 million in bonds
and not $30 million in currency.  Both are promises to pay, but one
promise fattens the userers and the other helps the people.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) S 1082 FDA Legislation

I am wondering if anyone on the list is following current  
legislation, the House a few days ago passed a bill without debate,  
HR 2900 that gives the FDA the power to remove supplements from the  
market based on their opinion.  The Senate's version of this bill is  
S 1082.  I just emailed Boxer and Feinstein about this, I don't know  
much about it but I thought the FDA was basically bought and paid for  
by the drug companies so why give them the power to mess with  
supplements.

I don't take issue with the commercial end of the site, never have, my 
comments were inspired by the social end. Somehow, even with working for 
a spell at alt  I got to miss the whole online dating thing, but I've 
heard very few happy stories about hook-ups from there.

No, the thing I'm talking about is the Rants & Raves section. Doesn't 
matter which city it's in, it's uniformly awful from coast to coast and 
sea to shining sea, and while I see where Craig says he's coming from, I 
don't share his belief that the flagging system is all that great.

Dave Chapelle quit doing his show, and walked away from a nice contract 
on the grounds that his comedy was having the exact opposite effect that 
he was going for. I see what goes on on that end of the site as feeding 
the same monster that so alarmed Mr. Chapelle.

It's gratuitous.

Thanks, I'd actually be interested in it.  One nice thing about being an "amateur" is that I don't need to worry if something is played out, since I rarely play for anyone but myself.  In fact I specialize in doing mixes including multiple played out tracks.  ;)

Trentemoeller remix...I have it on wax.

It's on the Om Electrolush comp. too...

The guys at Tweekin' will order it for you if you ask. That's how I got my 
copy - although, as played out as it is (did I say that?) I'd prolly be 
willing to sell my copy...

=)

Played out or not, it's a banger of a track. I have gotten much good mileage 
out of it, and you dern tootin' I'll get a copy on MP3 to keep around.

The nice thing about house as opposed to breaks and other genres, is played 
out tracks tend to keep their value much longer, if not indefinitely.

I'm sure they won't touch your Enzyte shipments Deepfog.

And honestly, not sure who should do this but... there's a RASH of "this 
is not evaluated" by the FDA shit out there that could feasibly be a 
problem.  Remember all the shit we got with ephedra being put in all kinds 
of stuff?  There *should* be controls on what people can put in stuff and 
label as whatever.

Organic *should* mean organic.  Free trade should mean free trade.  And 
that should be enforced, most likely at the federal level.  It should be 
illegal to say something is something or does something when it doesn't.  
It was a major problem back in the days of patent medicines, and we're 
almost at that point again.

Doctah, get me some laudnum, I'm havin a weak spell...

Yeah, God forbid you go through the effort of doing the research required to
make sure those claims are true; it's much easier to throw a few hundred
million at the FDA to make your decisions for you. Wait til it costs 50
bucks to get the antioxidants you need to go out and party safely...

Yo, alls I'm sayin is that the medical system in this country is SO fucked
up that the price of some supplements is pretty minor, all things
considered.

There are people that desperately need medical care dying in the streets and
you're getting upset about what the FDA has to say ABOUT SOME FUCKING
SUPPLEMENTS?

Tha fuck?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] bsp [WARNING] DJ Bone to Attack SF on August 11th


that's one for the calendars... soul of house + twitch of techno.  Eric is 
fucking BADASS.  For all of you who worry about folks who are producers 
first, who have great releases out, but suck as DJs... DJ Bone made it as 
a DJ first, and then started cranking out silly good tech-soul after his 
time in the trenches.  He 'gets' Detroit but he's not stuck in it like 
some form of robotic nostalgia, top shelf shit.  If you have any doubts, 
check http://www.7mzdt.com/subjectdetroit/

Highly Recommended.

Didja call yet?

Why not?

Do you Hate Our Freedom, or something? ;->

You know, one of the reasons the Lunatic Religious Right has made such
headway in politics over the past thirty years, is their authoritarian
structure. When the Pastor or the Phone Tree Lady calls a rabid
Evangelical and asks him/her to jump, the proper answer is "How High, O
Representative of The Living Lord? Thy requests are the *LORD's*
requests!! Thy every brainfart and assburr is the Word of the Holy
Spirit!!" (I'm really not exaggerating much.)

If these folks don't do what the pastor suggests, it eats at them and
"convicts them in the spirit", until they either do it, or burst into
tears of holy repentance at the next church service (which is always
sometime within the next 48 hours, BTW.)

But, of course, real lovers of freedom don't roll like that.

Which is why I'm reduced to abject begging.

Manipulation doesn't work with Libertarians and Progressives, so I'm
just going to *ask* you guys, outright, and remind you how important
this is. Even if you don't partake, yourself, think of the nation's
precious children, the *future* children, who may someday want to
self-medicate with one of the oldest, safest, most effective medicinal
herbs known to man, without having their doors busted down, their
property seized, their bank accounts emptied (if not outright -- which
happens, BTW -- then by interminable expensive legal fees while they
fight for their freedom) and their faces on the evening news, described
as "terrorists" or "predators on the community".

Please. This is your future as well as mine.

It's two to five minutes out of your life.
Thank you.

Why not?

Do you Hate Our Freedom, or something? ;->

You know, one of the reasons the Lunatic Religious Right has made such
headway in politics over the past thirty years, is their authoritarian
structure. When the Pastor or the Phone Tree Lady calls a rabid
Evangelical and asks him/her to jump, the proper answer is "How High, O
Representative of The Living Lord? Thy requests are the *LORD's*
requests!! Thy every brainfart and assburr is the Word of the Holy
Spirit!!" (I'm really not exaggerating much.)

If these folks don't do what the pastor suggests, it eats at them and
"convicts them in the spirit", until they either do it, or burst into
tears of holy repentance at the next church service (which is always
sometime within the next 48 hours, BTW.)

But, of course, real lovers of freedom don't roll like that.

Which is why I'm reduced to abject begging.

Manipulation doesn't work with Libertarians and Progressives, so I'm
just going to *ask* you guys, outright, and remind you how important
this is. Even if you don't partake, yourself, think of the nation's
precious children, the *future* children, who may someday want to
self-medicate with one of the oldest, safest, most effective medicinal
herbs known to man, without having their doors busted down, their
property seized, their bank accounts emptied (if not outright -- which
happens, BTW -- then by interminable expensive legal fees while they
fight for their freedom) and their faces on the evening news, described
as "terrorists" or "predators on the community".

Please. This is your future as well as mine.

It's two to five minutes out of your life.
Thank you.

SIMON BASSLINE SMITH


Simon was given the name Bassline after destroying the majority of the
speakers at the parties at which he played.

In the early 1990s Simon Bassline Smith was at the forefront, playing
for some of the biggest dance organizations in the country such as: -
Perception, Methology, Rain Dance, Dance 91 and World Dance.

As the underground rave scene progressed in the early 1990s Simon
Bassline Smith was at the forefront, playing for some of the biggest
dance organizations in the country along side such house hold names like
Grooverider, Fabio, Mickey Finn and Jumping Jack Frost.
Simon was spearheading the new musical form (Jungle) now known as Drum &
Bass.

Simon quickly set up his own label, called Absolute 2, which at the time,
was one of the only Drum & Bass labels in the world. He signed Doc Scott,
Nookie and Ray Keith and released their debut productions. With the
success of Absolute 2, under his belt Simon began his career as a
producer. He was an instant success with anthems such as:- Music and Life,
Jungle, Mine, Distinction,Palomino and Midnight which can still be heard
in sets across the globe today.

His musical style was, to say the least, ahead of its time.

Over the years Bassline Smith along with his partner Drumsound have
released tunes on their own labels Technique Recordings / Worldwide Audio
Recordings, the mighty Grooveriders Prototype with the 2004 number one
club smash  Odyssey, Renegade Hardware, V Recordings, Formation, Urban
Takeover, Grid, Flex, CIA. Future projects include Bukems Good Looking
Records and Fabios Creative Source showcasing a formidable mix and blend
of all styles of cutting edge Drum and Bass.

Simon has gone from strength to strength utilizing his knowledge to build
an imprint of global proportions. His success has spread the Technique
sound over every continent the world. Technique recordings as the label
has moved from respected underground drum and bass label to one of the
leading labels in the industry.

Bassline Smiths heavyweight DJ style is a full on assault of cutting edge
Drum & Bass set to smash up the dancefloors.

With local support from the Crunkpression crew!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Did You Call?


This language is totally disgusting.  Found it difficult to get to the 
bottom, being an insult to my intelligence, totally pointless, lacking any 
reference material, utterly polarizing, etc.  It sounds like it was 
written by Bill and Ted behind the Circle K.  That type of grandstanding 
shit is why partisan politics are so fucking bad.  Don't fuel the fire by 
making it *us and them*.  Plenty of supporters of compassionate use are 
christian, republican, conservative democrat, etc... and anybody who cares 
about people at some of the most diffiuclt periods in life can be 
convinced.  Make it a one issue issue without namecalling and all that 
crap.  All it takes for someone to support medicinal marijuana laws is 
realizing that for some people it is the absolutely best medicine for 
symptoms/apetite/etc, that Marinol is *not* the same as having access to 
actual pot (especially for anti-nausea), that it's adverse health effects 
have been grossly distorted, and these dispensaries require a prescription 
so the "kids" are protected.

http://www.google.com/search?q=Hinchey+Amendment+2007

>From that link you should be able to find background, past voting history 
on the amendment, etc.

Basically, this strategy is *not* the best means by which to do this, as 
it merely bars fed funds from being used to act against medicinal 
dispensaries.  As such, it is a "rider" on the budget, can easily be 
reversed year to year, does not serve as precedent, can be easily 
circumvented through weird non-fiscal appropriation of resources, and is 
somewhat annoying because I don't think shit like this belongs there.

But it's the best we have on the table for now so I'll be placing my 
little phone call.

Subject: [sfraves] Memory Lane

So, in trying to rebuilt a broke system, oof missing fonts, I was doing 
a bit of hardware manipulation.

FYI- You can hook an internal ZIP drive to an External IDE drive 
interface and it will work perfectly.  In fact, VERY fast. 

So, in going through some old zip looking for some obscure font, and 
found disks with my 90's MP3s.  Specifically, the Thunderdome series.

Memories...  omg.

So, in digging around to post teh track listing, I found this:

Enjoy Gerriravers.  We may have traded out O2 for N2O we we still like 
the old classics.  ;)

Thanks for the DJ Bone link. I downloaded his "Attack" mix and just started
listening to it now.

I'm always looking for new [Techno] mixes to listen to -- so if you have
anymore cool links please hit me up. :D I especially liked your [Andy W's]
NeuLight mix -- particularly the 2nd song.

Anyway, greatly appreciated,
Chris

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

Just a few comments about this quote, I found it on a video that I =20
downloaded that talks about the strength of the AIPAC lobby in =20
Washington.  I found the video interesting, and it said part 2 was =20
coming, but then it also had the cover of one of David Duke's books in =20
there, too, so I'm puzzled who made it, and I can't say I'm =20
particularly fond of David Duke.  Anyway, Tony Judt man is Jewish, he =20
says so in the video.  I think it's food for thought, that's all.

--

It wasn't always like this.  It started back in the 70's.  With the
rise of identity politics in this country, where it became
fashionable, and eventually politically and economically normal for
people to think of themselves as Black Americans, Italian Americans,
Irish Americans ... no one says 'I'm a Jewish American'.

Someone says  'I'm a Jewish American', it has a slightly uncomfortable =20
air to it. But they have to have an identity, the sense of the need to =20
have the same kind of cultural identity as Italian Americans or Black =20
Americans, or Hispanic Americans have, has created in the American =20
Jewish Community two external identification tags:  one is Israel, the =20
other is Auschwitz.

So to speak one in space and one in time, to be Jewish is to be moved =20
by the Holocaust, and to identify with Israel, even if you have no =20
personal connection to the Holocaust and you've never been to Israel, =20
which is true for most of them.  The result is that they are =20
extrodinarily sensitive both politically and personally - it's not an =20
invented thing, people feel this - to any suggestion
that there is criticism of Israel, or forgetting of the Holocaust, =20
because it touches the core identity of American Jews.

- Tony Judt, Historian

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) S 1082 FDA Legislation

Oh, they've got everyone so conditioned to believe that it's so =20
expensive to produce these drugs.  So this is why Bush is going to =20
veto a ban on mercury in vaccines?  And perhaps this justifies the =20
Bayer Corporation sending vaccines overseas with live AIDS virus in =20
the vaccines and infecting thousands.

But you want to make things affordable again?  Well we could start by =20
not letting the Fed turn us into the next Weimar Republic.

Somehow I feel lucky that I've been able to get through most of my =20
life without having been one of big pharma's customers, except for a =20
couple of times in my life.  I'm not saying it's all bad, but most of =20
the time if it's just a cold I'd much rather just live with the stuffy =20
nose for a few days.  You know what I mean?

Getting back to Andy's point, it is debatable how much regulation =20
should be on supplements.  But my question is do we want this corrupt =20
government to have the power to remove them from the shelves based on =20
their opinion.  Or do they already have this power?  Didn't they =20
remove 5-HTP in spray format.  Maybe I (or someone) should read the =20

Subject: [sfraves] Re:  iConsumer

Apple Computer announced today that it has
developed a computer chip that can store and play high
fidelity music in women's breast implants. The iTit
will cost $499 or $599 depending on speaker size.
This is considered to be a major breakthrough because
women have always complained about men staring at
their breasts and not listening to them.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Ride to EAST BAY 2nite?

Howdy all...myself and 2 other heads are in need of wheeled transportation 
to the East Bay (Oakland) tonight. Does anyone have room in their vehicle 
for 3? We compact well, and have money for petrol. If you're up for it, we 
are spinning before Heather Heart - you could come to the event and we'll 
get you in free and whatnot.

Anyone? Bueller?

Help a fellow raver and feel good about yourself! lol

(we just don't wanna blow money on a cab or have to lug equipment and stuff 
on BART)

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] FRI :: Adjunct-Audio's Apendics.Shuffle + Konstantin Gabbro [$5 show]

This Friday, Filter resident Apendics.Shuffle plus Konstantin Gabbro
of LA's premier experimental techno label Adjunct-Audio showcase their
unique brand of hed-funked beats.

Friday, July 27, 2007
9:00 PM - 2:00 AM

Anu
43 Sixth St - S.F.
Cover: $5

Opening DJ sets from Filter femmes Saya + Solekandi

About this show:

One of the early West Coast evangelists of minimal techno, Konstantin
Gabbro is the founder of Seattle's homegrown Orac Records, a label
that launched Bruno Pronsato and Kenneth James Gibson's
[a]pendics.shuffle moniker into the realm of the international
techorati.

In 2003 Konstantin moved down the Pacific Coast to Los Angeles where
he and Gibson (KJG) launched another label =96 Adjunct - a forward
thinking techno outlet that releases critically acclaimed collectibles
from names such as John Tejada, Pheek and newcomer Altiply.

A combination of Gabbro's well-schooled knowledge of deconstructed,
experimental techno with Gibson's mojo-laden epic Live PA sets goes
well beyond their description of "funky computer music".

If you are looking for something free, check out phpBB @ www.phpbb.com. The
problem with phpBB, however, is that security holes often are found, and the
boards can be tampered with... just make sure to keep them updated
frequently if you choose to use phpbb.  Two other message board systems that
I really like are Invision power boards(http://www.invisionpower.com) and
vBulletin (www.vbulletin.com).  There is also a free version of invision
power board (IPB) available at
www.invisionfree.com<http://invisionfree.com/>.
The free version has virtually the same features as the paid version, with
some limitations. You will have to take a look @ the features on each
individual website to choose which one would best fit the purpose of your
message board.  Hope this helps!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Business 2.0: Burning Man Grows Up

I'll just post this with no comment as I am sure others will comment fully.=
 =0A=0APeace,=0A=0APeter=0A=0ABurning Man grows up=0AAmerica's biggest coun=
terculture jamboree is also a $10 million business. Now, Business 2.0 repor=
ts, it's trying to leverage its brand -- and save the planet -- by (gasp!) =
inviting corporate participants.=0A=0ABy Chris Taylor, Business 2.0 Magazin=
e senior editor=0AJuly 1 2007: 2:51 PM EDT=0A=0A(Business 2.0 Magazine) -- =
Marian Goodell, 44, is a no-nonsense blond with a voice that sounds like it=
's barking orders out of a walkie-talkie. She's a veteran of seven industri=
es, including law, advertising, software development, and Department of Def=
ense contract work. =0AToday she's seated at a large, polished conference t=
able with an antique gavel, taking inventory of her current endeavor. "We r=
ent buildings, trucks, light towers, cranes, boom lifts, Bobcats, forklifts=
," she says. "We've got four properties in Nevada, totaling more than 200 a=
cres. And three full-time people in accounting managing a budget of $10 mil=
lion." =0A=0AIt sounds like a modestly successful construction company in L=
as Vegas or Reno. But then you look out the door and see a psychedelic cate=
rpillar perched atop a giant mushroom. Where Good-ell works is, in fact, th=
e global headquarters of Burning Man. Yes, that Burning Man, America's prem=
ier counterculture festival, the one that makes headlines every Labor Day. =
=0A=0ABut while most of us were looking at the pictures of people in body p=
aint, Burning Man did something it wasn't supposed to do. It grew up. It be=
came a sustainable business. How it did that says a lot about both the Sili=
con Valley culture that helped spawn it and where that culture is heading. =
=0ABurning Man started as a half-baked idea in the fevered mind of Goodell'=
s boss, Larry Harvey. A reclusive man who favors long pauses between his gu=
rulike pronouncements, he's a legend among burners, as Burning Man devotees=
 call themselves. =0A=0AIn 1986, Harvey and his friend Jerry James built a =
giant wood man on San Francisco's Baker Beach, and then set it on fire. The=
 gathering drew such interesting people that Harvey has repeated it every y=
ear since. When the event outgrew Baker Beach, he moved the whole thing to =
Nevada's Black Rock Desert, the largest stretch of flatland in the United S=
tates, for a weeklong jamboree. =0A=0AHarvey, however, is almost never in t=
he office. "Larry's no Steve Jobs," Goodell says. "He's not running the bus=
iness. He didn't even have a checking account until a couple of years ago."=
 In his absence, Goodell manages the money, the business side, the construc=
tion, the communications. Marian Goodell - known to burners as Maid Marian =
- is Burning Man's resident adult. Think of her as its CEO. =0A=0AThis is t=
he year Burning Man comes of age. It's 21 years old as a festival and 11 ye=
ars old as a limited liability company now called Black Rock City LLC. In t=
hat time it has learned more lessons than many companies three times its ag=
e. It has beaten threats of shutdown from government officials, both local =
and national, coped with two fatal accidents, and suffered weeklong "whiteo=
ut" dust storms. It has staved off bankruptcy three times. And it has found=
 the magic formula for creating a temporary city of 40,000 souls from scrat=
ch and running the whole thing - from security to sanitation - almost entir=
ely with volunteer labor. =0A=0ABut no challenge has been greater than deal=
ing with the complaints from veteran burners - the hypernetworked old-timer=
s at the core of the community - that Burning Man has grown too big and has=
 lost touch with its anticommercial roots. That it is too much like, well, =
a business. =0A=0AThe event is supposed to run on what participants call a =
"gift economy." They have no truck with U.S. currency once inside the event=
's trash fence. Even bartering is frowned upon. The fact that the organizat=
ion sells coffee and ice is controversial enough. Imagine the reaction, the=
n, when Burning Man makes the riskiest business move in its history: It's g=
oing to allow companies to exhibit products at the 2007 event. =0A=0AEach B=
urning Man has a different theme, chosen by Harvey. This year's theme is "T=
he Green Man." Burning Man, an extravaganza characterized by the consumptio=
n of huge quantities of fossil fuel, has discovered environmentalism. It is=
 attempting to offset the 28,000 tons of carbon it estimates the event gene=
rates (counting all those flights and long drives for its far-flung attende=
es), and the organization is belatedly switching to biodiesel generators to=
 provide most of the event's electricity. =0AMost controversially, the orga=
nization wants to bring as many green-energy companies as possible into wha=
t Harvey calls a world's fair of clean tech. Google (Charts, Fortune 500) i=
s going to help produce an online 3-D search service called Burning Man Ear=
th. =0A=0AA venture capitalist is bringing a vast solar-power array. Four w=
ind-power companies will be placing turbines around the Man. PR maven Melod=
y Haller of the Antenna Group will be bringing a campful of her clean-tech =
CEOs. "We're inviting the Greeks into the heart of Troy," says Tom Price, B=
urning Man's new environmental director. "Burning Man may have to destroy i=
tself to save the planet." =0A=0ADestroy itself? Well, possibly. Those 40,0=
00 attendees are Burning Man's only tangible asset. Without their entry fee=
s - $250 in January, $400 at the gate in August - there's no $10 million bu=
dget. "It's a good business," says one venture capitalist who has examined =
the company's financial record, "but it's even more seasonal than a ski res=
ort." Other than those tickets, the organization has no real source of reve=
nue. The coffee just about pays for itself - it's more an excuse for newcom=
ers to mingle than a vending enterprise - while the proceeds from the sales=
 of ice are donated to charity. =0A=0AIn other words, as Harvey says, Disne=
yland this ain't: "Theirs is a spectacle entirely for consumption; ours is =
based on interaction and communal effort. It's Disneyland turned inside out=
." =0A=0ANevertheless, the Burning Man community is an unusually smart, wel=
l-knit, and well-heeled social network. Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Googl=
e are regular attendees; they chose Eric Schmidt as their CEO because he wa=
s the only candidate for the job who had been a burner. =0A=0ASo many VCs s=
how up that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs like to joke that you can't get an=
y funding during the week of Burning Man. Celebrities like Robin Williams, =
Sting, and Joan Baez often arrive incognito. Thousands of lesser-known arti=
sts spend up to 10 times the ticket price, mostly drawn from their own pock=
ets, to create the spectacles at the center of the experience: the Burning =
Man art, in all its neon-lit, fire-spewing glory. =0A=0AYou really have to =
want to be there to truck yourself and your gallons of drinking water in an=
d out of the desert, an environment so extreme that dehydration and other s=
erious bodily harm are real possibilities. As it says in large letters on t=
heir tickets, attendees voluntarily assume the risk of death. (Indeed, sinc=
e 1996, two have died in art-car accidents.) =0A=0ABut not only do people s=
till come, they create content and provide their own services with an enthu=
siasm that puts even Wikipedia to shame. According to Black Rock City's ann=
ual census, 80 percent of attendees volunteer at some point during the even=
t. Burning Man, it seems, was Web 2.0 before that label existed. =0ABurner =
volunteers solve their own disputes (through the Black Rock Rangers) and li=
ght their own gas lamps (through the Lamplighters). A few hundred even stay=
 to clean up the desert for at least a month after the event. "Our budget i=
s in the millions," Harvey says, "but if you include everything people give=
 to the city, it's three times what we invest." =0A=0AIt's just as well tha=
t there's all this goodwill and free labor. Black Rock City has already suf=
fered three times from cost overruns that threatened to bury it in debt, an=
d not just to pay for all those rented portable toilets. The federal Bureau=
 of Land Management charges $4 per person per day for use of the desert. Ne=
vada's Washoe County makes the organization cover the cost of all the extra=
 police it insists on bringing to the event. =0A=0AThose charges alone add =
up to roughly $800,000. This year the Denver office of the BLM is threateni=
ng to add on a 19 percent fee, or $120,000, for administrative costs. Burni=
ng Man is currently protesting this new surcharge in Washington. (Since it =
is the largest single customer on federal land, the organization usually ge=
ts a sympathetic hearing in the halls of power - especially with San Franci=
sco's Nancy Pelosi and Nevada's Harry Reid.) =0A=0AYou can think of the eco=
nomics of Burning Man as a delicate ecosystem in itself. Goodell won't reve=
al exactly how much profit the event clears, only that most of the money is=
 spent on donations to artists, and the remainder has been "comfortably abo=
ve $50,000" since 2005. If the corporate experiment triggers a drop in atte=
ndance, Burning Man could find itself in debt for a fourth, and perhaps fin=
al, time. =0A=0AThis community is a dream for anyone looking at demographic=
s," Goodell says. "We have kids who work in coffee shops and we have billio=
naires. To ignore the value of our brand, the buying power it has, is silly=
. But it's a ritual for these people, which is why it's going to be hard fo=
r them seeing businesses out there." Burning Man's customers keep coming ba=
ck to Black Rock precisely because it's so far outside the scope of the cor=
porate culture - and its incessant marketing - that most of them live with =
the other 51 weeks of the year. =0A=0ASo the organization decided that the =
companies that come this summer will have to play by Burning Man's rules. T=
he first letter inviting corporate participants was pulled off the website =
after only a few days; Harvey says it made the event sound too much like a =
trade fair. The revision stated explicitly that no marketing whatsoever wou=
ld be allowed at the event. =0A=0AClean-tech companies can exhibit their te=
chnologies, but their products can't display a logo. No marketing material =
will be allowed. Company reps can't even demonstrate their wares in the pav=
ilion; they have to turn them over to Burning Man, which will demonstrate t=
he technologies in whatever artistic form it chooses. =0AGiven these restri=
ctions, why would a company want to come? For one thing, there's evidence t=
hat simply bringing your product to Burning Man and letting it speak for it=
self can pay rich rewards. Goodell cites the example of Current TV, the San=
 Francisco video content company that came to the event in 2006 and did a s=
how every day but didn't display its brand. The response, both at Burning M=
an and from viewers afterward, was overwhelmingly positive. =0A=0A"Branding=
's important, "Goodell says," but there's a middle ground between having it=
 all over the place and just knowing that it's Current TV and feeling good =
about the way they're treating you. That's a very interesting potential for=
 companies that see a value in Burning Man culture." =0A=0APlenty of compan=
ies do, it seems, and at the front of the line this year is Google. Its eng=
ineers are building software for unbranded kiosks at the pavilion where par=
ticipants can zoom in to a virtual version of Burning Man. Just click on a =
given technology or art project and Google will take you directly to its we=
bsite.=0A"A lot of Google people come to the event, and the reason is that =
their corporate culture has similarities to ours," Harvey says. "They do wh=
at they're interested in. They have fun and worry about monetizing it later=
." =0A=0AAfter the invitations went out in May, Burning Man started getting=
 inquiries from about three corporations a day. Some executives were slow t=
o understand exactly what kind of event they were dealing with. At an early=
 meeting, one CEO was surprised to learn that there's no cell-phone service=
 in the desert. (The organization, however, does supply Wi-Fi.) But most ar=
e optimistic. "I'm curious to see what happens at the intersection of art a=
nd technology," says B.J. Stanbery, CEO of Austin-based Heliovolt, a maker =
of thin-film photovoltaic solar cells. =0A=0AThen there's Matt Cheney, CEO =
of MMA Renewable Ventures, which funds clean technologies around the globe =
and offered to provide Black Rock City with enough solar cells - 270 kilowa=
tts' worth - to light the Man and power the pavilion. After the event, thos=
e solar panels will be installed at no cost - remember that free Burning Ma=
n labor? - in the nearby town of Gerlach. =0A=0ACheney will be getting very=
 generous rebates from the state of Nevada. Not enough to cover the $1.5 mi=
llion tab, he says, but the good publicity will more than make up the diffe=
rence. "There's a tremendous alignment here," Cheney says. Enough, he adds,=
 to do it again in future years. =0A=0AStill, some attendees fear that the =
arrival of corporations - even without business cards - is the death knell =
for Burning Man. "I'm sure the corporations are thinking, OK, this year tho=
se are the terms," says one prominent Burning Man artist involved in buildi=
ng the Man itself. "But now the door's open. In the end, the money wins." =
=0AOther erstwhile naysayers, however, have embraced the green theme. Jim M=
ason and Chicken John are two artists who led a rebellion against what they=
 saw as Burning Man's arrogant arts patronage at the event two years ago. N=
ow both are building art cars that use gasification technology - meaning th=
ey can turn trash into hydrogen gas, which they run on. Chicken John's car =
was a showcase exhibit at Cleantech 2007, an industry conference held in Sa=
n Jose in May. =0A=0AAnd what of Burning Man itself? Harvey sees the event =
continuing for another decade or so, at which point spinoffs - the so-calle=
d regional burns - can take over. By then, he says, there'll no longer be a=
 need for a single, central Burning Man organization. But Goodell demurs. "=
The business model can totally function without Larry Harvey," she says. "A=
s long as the LLC exists, the event exists." As if to underscore her point,=
 the enigmatic sign above the door to her conference room reads, "Larry Har=
vey does not exist." =0A=0AChris Taylor is a senior editor at Business 2.0 =
and a seven-time burner. He blogs at business2.com/futureboy=0A=0Ahttp://mo=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Business 2.0: Burning Man Grows Up



You know, I am just amazed that they are able to pull off this party each
and ever year and provide a good time for all.  People take this stuff
waaaayyy too seriously.  If you don't like burning man, just don't go.  There
are plenty of other cool counter-culture outdoor parties out there. Its
a waste of energy to get your panties in a bundle over anything BM does.

I mean, it is not like they are selling out to the Republican Party or
Exxon Mobile... they are promoting alternative energy, for goodness sake.

> Today she's seated at a large, polished conference table with an antique gavel, taking inventory of her current endeavor. "We rent buildings, trucks, light towers, cranes, boom lifts, Bobcats, forklifts," she says. "We've got four properties in Nevada, totaling more than 200 acres. And three full-time people in accounting managing a budget of $10 million." 
> 
> It sounds like a modestly successful construction company in Las Vegas or Reno. But then you look out the door and see a psychedelic caterpillar perched atop a giant mushroom. Where Good-ell works is, in fact, the global headquarters of Burning Man. Yes, that Burning Man, America's premier counterculture festival, the one that makes headlines every Labor Day. 
> 
> But while most of us were looking at the pictures of people in body paint, Burning Man did something it wasn't supposed to do. It grew up. It became a sustainable business. How it did that says a lot about both the Silicon Valley culture that helped spawn it and where that culture is heading. 
> Burning Man started as a half-baked idea in the fevered mind of Goodell's boss, Larry Harvey. A reclusive man who favors long pauses between his gurulike pronouncements, he's a legend among burners, as Burning Man devotees call themselves. 
> 
> In 1986, Harvey and his friend Jerry James built a giant wood man on San Francisco's Baker Beach, and then set it on fire. The gathering drew such interesting people that Harvey has repeated it every year since. When the event outgrew Baker Beach, he moved the whole thing to Nevada's Black Rock Desert, the largest stretch of flatland in the United States, for a weeklong jamboree. 
> 
> Harvey, however, is almost never in the office. "Larry's no Steve Jobs," Goodell says. "He's not running the business. He didn't even have a checking account until a couple of years ago." In his absence, Goodell manages the money, the business side, the construction, the communications. Marian Goodell - known to burners as Maid Marian - is Burning Man's resident adult. Think of her as its CEO. 
> 
> This is the year Burning Man comes of age. It's 21 years old as a festival and 11 years old as a limited liability company now called Black Rock City LLC. In that time it has learned more lessons than many companies three times its age. It has beaten threats of shutdown from government officials, both local and national, coped with two fatal accidents, and suffered weeklong "whiteout" dust storms. It has staved off bankruptcy three times. And it has found the magic formula for creating a temporary city of 40,000 souls from scratch and running the whole thing - from security to sanitation - almost entirely with volunteer labor. 
> 
> But no challenge has been greater than dealing with the complaints from veteran burners - the hypernetworked old-timers at the core of the community - that Burning Man has grown too big and has lost touch with its anticommercial roots. That it is too much like, well, a business. 
> 
> The event is supposed to run on what participants call a "gift economy." They have no truck with U.S. currency once inside the event's trash fence. Even bartering is frowned upon. The fact that the organization sells coffee and ice is controversial enough. Imagine the reaction, then, when Burning Man makes the riskiest business move in its history: It's going to allow companies to exhibit products at the 2007 event. 
> 
> Each Burning Man has a different theme, chosen by Harvey. This year's theme is "The Green Man." Burning Man, an extravaganza characterized by the consumption of huge quantities of fossil fuel, has discovered environmentalism. It is attempting to offset the 28,000 tons of carbon it estimates the event generates (counting all those flights and long drives for its far-flung attendees), and the organization is belatedly switching to biodiesel generators to provide most of the event's electricity. 
> Most controversially, the organization wants to bring as many green-energy companies as possible into what Harvey calls a world's fair of clean tech. Google (Charts, Fortune 500) is going to help produce an online 3-D search service called Burning Man Earth. 
> 
> A venture capitalist is bringing a vast solar-power array. Four wind-power companies will be placing turbines around the Man. PR maven Melody Haller of the Antenna Group will be bringing a campful of her clean-tech CEOs. "We're inviting the Greeks into the heart of Troy," says Tom Price, Burning Man's new environmental director. "Burning Man may have to destroy itself to save the planet." 
> 
> Destroy itself? Well, possibly. Those 40,000 attendees are Burning Man's only tangible asset. Without their entry fees - $250 in January, $400 at the gate in August - there's no $10 million budget. "It's a good business," says one venture capitalist who has examined the company's financial record, "but it's even more seasonal than a ski resort." Other than those tickets, the organization has no real source of revenue. The coffee just about pays for itself - it's more an excuse for newcomers to mingle than a vending enterprise - while the proceeds from the sales of ice are donated to charity. 
> 
> In other words, as Harvey says, Disneyland this ain't: "Theirs is a spectacle entirely for consumption; ours is based on interaction and communal effort. It's Disneyland turned inside out." 
> 
> Nevertheless, the Burning Man community is an unusually smart, well-knit, and well-heeled social network. Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google are regular attendees; they chose Eric Schmidt as their CEO because he was the only candidate for the job who had been a burner. 
> 
> So many VCs show up that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs like to joke that you can't get any funding during the week of Burning Man. Celebrities like Robin Williams, Sting, and Joan Baez often arrive incognito. Thousands of lesser-known artists spend up to 10 times the ticket price, mostly drawn from their own pockets, to create the spectacles at the center of the experience: the Burning Man art, in all its neon-lit, fire-spewing glory. 
> 
> You really have to want to be there to truck yourself and your gallons of drinking water in and out of the desert, an environment so extreme that dehydration and other serious bodily harm are real possibilities. As it says in large letters on their tickets, attendees voluntarily assume the risk of death. (Indeed, since 1996, two have died in art-car accidents.) 
> 
> But not only do people still come, they create content and provide their own services with an enthusiasm that puts even Wikipedia to shame. According to Black Rock City's annual census, 80 percent of attendees volunteer at some point during the event. Burning Man, it seems, was Web 2.0 before that label existed. 
> Burner volunteers solve their own disputes (through the Black Rock Rangers) and light their own gas lamps (through the Lamplighters). A few hundred even stay to clean up the desert for at least a month after the event. "Our budget is in the millions," Harvey says, "but if you include everything people give to the city, it's three times what we invest." 
> 
> It's just as well that there's all this goodwill and free labor. Black Rock City has already suffered three times from cost overruns that threatened to bury it in debt, and not just to pay for all those rented portable toilets. The federal Bureau of Land Management charges $4 per person per day for use of the desert. Nevada's Washoe County makes the organization cover the cost of all the extra police it insists on bringing to the event. 
> 
> Those charges alone add up to roughly $800,000. This year the Denver office of the BLM is threatening to add on a 19 percent fee, or $120,000, for administrative costs. Burning Man is currently protesting this new surcharge in Washington. (Since it is the largest single customer on federal land, the organization usually gets a sympathetic hearing in the halls of power - especially with San Francisco's Nancy Pelosi and Nevada's Harry Reid.) 
> 
> You can think of the economics of Burning Man as a delicate ecosystem in itself. Goodell won't reveal exactly how much profit the event clears, only that most of the money is spent on donations to artists, and the remainder has been "comfortably above $50,000" since 2005. If the corporate experiment triggers a drop in attendance, Burning Man could find itself in debt for a fourth, and perhaps final, time. 
> 
> This community is a dream for anyone looking at demographics," Goodell says. "We have kids who work in coffee shops and we have billionaires. To ignore the value of our brand, the buying power it has, is silly. But it's a ritual for these people, which is why it's going to be hard for them seeing businesses out there." Burning Man's customers keep coming back to Black Rock precisely because it's so far outside the scope of the corporate culture - and its incessant marketing - that most of them live with the other 51 weeks of the year. 
> 
> So the organization decided that the companies that come this summer will have to play by Burning Man's rules. The first letter inviting corporate participants was pulled off the website after only a few days; Harvey says it made the event sound too much like a trade fair. The revision stated explicitly that no marketing whatsoever would be allowed at the event. 
> 
> Clean-tech companies can exhibit their technologies, but their products can't display a logo. No marketing material will be allowed. Company reps can't even demonstrate their wares in the pavilion; they have to turn them over to Burning Man, which will demonstrate the technologies in whatever artistic form it chooses. 
> Given these restrictions, why would a company want to come? For one thing, there's evidence that simply bringing your product to Burning Man and letting it speak for itself can pay rich rewards. Goodell cites the example of Current TV, the San Francisco video content company that came to the event in 2006 and did a show every day but didn't display its brand. The response, both at Burning Man and from viewers afterward, was overwhelmingly positive. 
> 
> "Branding's important, "Goodell says," but there's a middle ground between having it all over the place and just knowing that it's Current TV and feeling good about the way they're treating you. That's a very interesting potential for companies that see a value in Burning Man culture." 
> 
> Plenty of companies do, it seems, and at the front of the line this year is Google. Its engineers are building software for unbranded kiosks at the pavilion where participants can zoom in to a virtual version of Burning Man. Just click on a given technology or art project and Google will take you directly to its website.
> "A lot of Google people come to the event, and the reason is that their corporate culture has similarities to ours," Harvey says. "They do what they're interested in. They have fun and worry about monetizing it later." 
> 
> After the invitations went out in May, Burning Man started getting inquiries from about three corporations a day. Some executives were slow to understand exactly what kind of event they were dealing with. At an early meeting, one CEO was surprised to learn that there's no cell-phone service in the desert. (The organization, however, does supply Wi-Fi.) But most are optimistic. "I'm curious to see what happens at the intersection of art and technology," says B.J. Stanbery, CEO of Austin-based Heliovolt, a maker of thin-film photovoltaic solar cells. 
> 
> Then there's Matt Cheney, CEO of MMA Renewable Ventures, which funds clean technologies around the globe and offered to provide Black Rock City with enough solar cells - 270 kilowatts' worth - to light the Man and power the pavilion. After the event, those solar panels will be installed at no cost - remember that free Burning Man labor? - in the nearby town of Gerlach. 
> 
> Cheney will be getting very generous rebates from the state of Nevada. Not enough to cover the $1.5 million tab, he says, but the good publicity will more than make up the difference. "There's a tremendous alignment here," Cheney says. Enough, he adds, to do it again in future years. 
> 
> Still, some attendees fear that the arrival of corporations - even without business cards - is the death knell for Burning Man. "I'm sure the corporations are thinking, OK, this year those are the terms," says one prominent Burning Man artist involved in building the Man itself. "But now the door's open. In the end, the money wins." 
> Other erstwhile naysayers, however, have embraced the green theme. Jim Mason and Chicken John are two artists who led a rebellion against what they saw as Burning Man's arrogant arts patronage at the event two years ago. Now both are building art cars that use gasification technology - meaning they can turn trash into hydrogen gas, which they run on. Chicken John's car was a showcase exhibit at Cleantech 2007, an industry conference held in San Jose in May. 
> 
> And what of Burning Man itself? Harvey sees the event continuing for another decade or so, at which point spinoffs - the so-called regional burns - can take over. By then, he says, there'll no longer be a need for a single, central Burning Man organization. But Goodell demurs. "The business model can totally function without Larry Harvey," she says. "As long as the LLC exists, the event exists." As if to underscore her point, the enigmatic sign above the door to her conference room reads, "Larry Harvey does not exist."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] bsp: Tiesto

That would be an interesting experiment.

But I already did that, remember Toshi ;-)

In any case, the exchange students were ga-ga about Tiesto 
before they came here. So when I stopped by my parents with the 
Tiesto flyer they literally shat their pants. They shat 
uncontrollably, and they were happy about it. Then they shat 
some more.

Looking forward to some real techno.

Heh-

The man is 37yo and has been at the forefront of his field for how long?
Granted it's a field I don't give two shits about, but I've got to give  
him credit just for his staying power.
Similar to the way I respect Thomas Fehlman-
And you see that orange rackmount beastie in the beginning?
That's a Microwave XT.
The sounds of God on acid come out of that box-
And anyone who owns one earns at least a bit of instant cred in my book-

I don't think SE/30 went through any grinding-teesh trance phase-
And nor did I-
But the others who have commented are borne as false witnesses with  
photographic evidence-
Let thee who has never worn any candy cast the first stone-

There is always a connection between collective past suffering and
present individual actions.  To turn that into public policy, though,
is disastrous.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Minimal sucks, glad Bone is coming to SF

Well, you're in good company. One stat tossed out by a promoter
recently claimed there are 800 fans of techno in the Bay Area whereas
there are only about 300 for minimal.

But one person's minimal is another person's microtrance is another's
electro and so it goes, with various meanings and associations
prescribed to each. This is obviously the problem with attempting to
utilize one terminology "minimal" to describe anything 4x4 with an
experimental flare.

Blame beatport...really. They tend to lump alot of the new,
experimental dance music into minimal when it's really sounds mostly
like ambiant, IDM, trance or electro...

A fun test of Beatport's shortcomings is to pick tracks from both
"techno" and "minimal" categories and ask a techno DJ which genre they
think it really is.

It's all personal perspective though. I think there are far too many 
sub-genres to accurately say which genre is which anymore. Everything has a 
little bit of something else in it to dilute it.

A recent survey claimed that nation-wide there are
37.5 fans of breaks left.  The half fan was a chick in
Michigan who says she listens to the "Boombox" channel
on Sirius Satellite Radio exclusively in her car, but
only because her receiver is broken and permanetly
stuck on channel 34.

For reals. I heard that from a few folks as well. Guess there 
not used to well-produced stage productions? Christmas, look at

I saw them in LA a while back, staying home this weekend.

Subject: [sfraves] WR last weekend: Treasure, TELIC, & Robot Rave

OK.. sorry a lil late.. but i've been mad busy tryin' to catch up w. my
homework & well.. since i'm in a mondo writing block slump like right now
now... hopefully writing about my weekend will help my creative, noctunral
brain focus :)

By the way... 2 weeks Shelter @ The Top, I mean.. Underground SF.. the new
Jungle weeklie that took over Phuturo... so Dope!!  Like I mean.. I talk
to the owner & he said that it's bee a steady night... there been alota
people comiing & like yeah.. it was pretty ill... good time3s!!!  It was
like a 3rd packed, good music all night long.. yummy jungle... it was Dope
being' w/ my Jungle Familia again :)

So last Thursday i went to Pier 23 instead of Beer Cellar & ya know.. it
was really fun!!!  It was nice dancing on like this deck thingie over the
water & oooh.. the YUmmy Beats all night long!!!  Jonesy (sp) spun this
bad ass like she went from 2 Step, to breaks, to prog house, minimal
techno (sorry Nico), back to breaks... it was a really fun set!  Pam The
Funkstress was so Fuckin' Ill!!!  She played this old 90's hip hop set 7
oooh.. she juggled so sweet & she fucki'n scratched records w/ her
boobs!!!  Hello 2day!!  Kiro, My Hero, played this bad ass fuckin' Dope
Junlge set... like his 1st trafck was this Rock infused Jungle song...
like what's his name from the Phuturo crew plays alots rock/ jungle
ch00ns, but when Kiro dropped this.. So teh_yummeh!!!  It was A good small
crowd... alota Familia passed by & OOooh.. Yaaay... Kiro brought me home!!
 So Dope!!!  therre were several points during the night when I danced to
like hella tired!!!!

OK.. Saturday was Soooo FUN!!!  Woke up way mondo Hella fuckin' early from
barely even sleeping 'cause i didn't wanna walk to the bus stop & catch a
ride from the rents...  So i ended up havin a mini breakfast @ Jack in the
Box where I ran into my classmate from 2nd grade.. LoL.. so that was kinda
Dope!!! :)

B4 I went to Lake Elizabeth for the day party, i stopped over Unka's to
check on her :)   Love U Girl!!  Well.. it was 9AM & I dunno... by 1PM.. i
made it out to the TELIC day party & oooooooooh.. it was sooo Dope!!!  My
Gosh man... it was good to see that part of my Familia & spend the day
with them & eat all this yummy bbq food!!!  Like there was alota ummm..
Breaks, Jungle, Trance, deep house, & yes... Happy Hardcore there!!!  I'm
tellin' ya man.. Lake Elizabeth is getting fucki'n HUGE now!!!  I would
love to go there again this summer for something again!!!  Love it!  Oh
yeah.. i spent 2 hours workin' on my robot costume there & it turned out
pretty Groovy!!!

Come night time... like ok... so a few things kinda got fucked up &
weird... in the early Morn when i was @ Unka's, I realized I forgot
well;... my HOmie JBL was out from NYC & like wanted to kick it.. so i
took a chance & PMed him a message on IRC hoping he got it telling him to
meet me @ the park... but that mever happned.. so since i had no access to
a compie @ the park, I ended up taking bart back to Unka's in Berk &
see... there was no VM for the Robot Rave... it was all online.. info,
etc... anywaze... so like got the info & it was different from the
location the promoter gave me the night before... so i copied & pasted the
location & yahoo mapped it.. Unka was Dope enough to drive me instead of
me taking BART again, & when we got to the address & she dropped me off,
it was a fuckin' Yogart shop...

For like an hour & 1/2 almost i was confuszed & thought maybe that was a
map point & I kinda waited around for people who went to the Yogart shop
to see if there was a like password or something.... but nothing :(  So
after walking around for hella long... & watching Charlie & The Chocolate
Factory on the side of this Church (awesome btw)... I walked back to the
yogart shop  it was closed by now.. so i asked 1 of the works who was
standing outside if they knew were a pay phone was so i can make a call..
then this stranger, Danny, asked me if it was a local call & he called
Unka for me on his phone.. Hello 2Day!  So Unka checked the address on the
website again for me & it was sooooo different from where i was!  I was in
48## Piedmont & it was @ 34## Piedmont!!!!  So i ened up talking to Danny
& his wife Mila (who's Filipina) & showed them my robot costume & it was
Dope!!!  They were soo Nice!!!

So Dubfarm 4, the Robot Rave, was Dope!!!  Like this is the kinda
Underground I Love... roughly 200 people, intamite, & ooooh.. the music..
so Dope!!!  Breaks, 80s & 90s, DubStep, & Jungle!!! YUM!!!  The venue was
this room in this old furniture warehouse from the 70s... oooh.. So Dope!!
 LoL.. that night... I reeeeeeally gotta talk to Wish & Odeed more than
like before... Love them!!!  Oh yeah.. they played this bad ass breaks set
of well... I knew from talkin' to Odeed on AIM that most the stuff they
played were ch00ns they made... but yeah.. it was a Dope crowd... alota
the Jungle & Dubstep Familia were there & alota random long time no see
folks :)  But yeah.. just what i needed!!

Just FYI: Osby is now accepting applications for someone to be his MASTER,
he mentioned something to me about wanting to live in a sex dungeon a few
days ago. . . Not sure if anyone here is interested in that sort of thing,
but I figured he'd be too shy to ask himself.

I'm sure he was referring to the archaic and ludicrous 10% of your salary 
tithing people are typically expected to pay to be a good little 
church-goer.

Either way, this thread sucks ass.

Less religion and politics - more rave.

Most minimal, at least in the last couple years fails as creative sound 
design, fails as a statement, fails at being dance music, etc.  I just 
don't get it (and take this as someone who *worships* old dbx/danbell, 
stewart walker, timeblind/chris sattinger, had one of their favorite 
nights of dancing ever to Juan Atkins playing the most stripped down shit, 
has released some stuff that would be filed under 'minimal techno', knows 
how to get kooky noises out of Reaktor & MaxMSP, etc).  Plus a lot of the 
seriously cheesy shit by bored techno guys branching out into 
pop/experimental is just *bad* (like the last Matthew Dear full length... 
it's like child molester theme music... if I heard it blasting out of a 
van that was pulling up behind me I'd take off running before the door 
opened).

As for the 800 fans number... I miss playing donkey raping techno at peak 
hour for 2k+ revelers.  I miss Static when it was at Liquid, the place was 
assholes and elbows full and the bass would shake beers off the counter.  
I miss stores carrying the shit.  It seems like labels are just groups of 
people now that will put out anything made within that group of people 
(even old standbys like m-nus have released some seriously shitty 
pointless crap lately... but then even mister dexfx+909 himself bores the 
crap out of me now despite all the awesome work he did in the 90s).  I 
liked being told that people who claimed to hate techno liked what I 
played.

Yeah, ok, I'm that old fuck reminiscing about my days on the high school 
team.

Argh!  Should have called a screen play!  *throws beer can at tv*

Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers own
the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create
money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits
to buy it back again. However, take it away from them, and all the
great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear,
for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you
wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own
slavery, let them continue to create money.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Minimal sucks, glad Bone is coming to SF

Andy, you asked me at the last FnF campout why I stopped regarding you as a 
hero, a techno god ...

The reason is is because you stopped playing the techno I love.  You kept 
verbally slamming into my head that there aren't any decent 'techno' records 
being put out, on several occassions.  I think that's bullshit, I think you 
and several other techno DJs in the area stopped looking.

I have to say you're all wrong. Chris, you, everyone in the bay area after 
about 2005.  I have no idea why this all came about but I had to leave SFBA 
to find good techno beats to dance to.  Trust me, those days in Cactus Club 
when we had that place to ourselves ... it was amazing.  But you didn't keep 
it going.  None of us did sadly.

Droid kids down south are persevering.  Los Angeles of all places FUCK!

What the fuck happened to dance-floor techno?  Yeah you can say that the 
drumcode 90s tainted it, but you all saw Bone chop it up in youtube clip.

It's not dead.  But for some reason the bay area wants to bury it.  BRING 
THE BEATS!!!!

love always

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Minimal sucks, glad Bone is coming to SF

Sadly, I think us breaks heads got ahold of your precious techno, and 
started warping it to our own sick needs - hence the tech-funk explosion.

I hear more dance-floor techno coming from breaks heads than I do coming 
from the techno crowd. Seems the techno heads wanna keep it either minimal 
or play stuff that is just plain not that friendly to the ears - for the 
most part anyway - I am obviously generalizing a bit. I'd say folks like the 
KONTROL crew are offering up some different beats, and are some of the only 
folks really pushing it in this area big time.

But you can trust and believe that there'll still be some good ol' fashioned 
bangin' warehouse techno coming from the OW posse if not from anyone else. 
Keep your ears to the ground for more on that...

I've heard a few tracks that my buddy plays on Yahoo when he does his online sets. Best description I could give is that it has absolutely NOTHING to do with Trance. Think it's even pronounced differently. 

Yeah, if anybody has some tracks they could throw up, that would be ill. I've really been digging on this style lately.

Yes chuck, but what style is "Schranz" is what folks wanna know.

I am assuming it's some German influenced house music, but of course that 
seems obvious...so...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] I like Schranz

Schranz is ultra hard techno. Chris Liebing coined the name a long time 
ago to describe some of his stuff. I don't like much of what they're 
calling schranz these days because it's way too fast (increasing an 
already fast-paced music's tempo has never made something harder in my 
mind) and sounds more like hardcore with the cheesy vocal snipets and 
synths.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] I also think I may have gone overboard

Nico, I sure wish I had the time to put into making and releasing  
music now-a-days.  I just have too much other stuff going on in my  
life right now to make time for production.  I wish I did.  I hope to  
once again find myself tediously sequencing tracks...programing  
percussion laced bangers!  I miss it.  With that said, I finally put  
Resource Records up on Myspace.  Lame??  Maybe, but it's the first  
step in my master plan to bring my label back to life.  There are  
unreleased tracks up there now.  Please take a listen.

http://www.myspace.com/resourcerecords

I feel as if I'm done with djing for good.  But that doesn't mean I  
can't put some new shit out!  Andy??  Do you have any new material  
worthy of RESO-OL3??  Hit me up son!

=)

Subject: [sfraves] Best Cafe! (with cool music)

The SF Bay Guardian just awarded Cafe Flore as having
received the most votes from their readers as "Best
Cafe".

I just started bartending there this past week and
work 3:30 -11pm sun-thurs. This place rocks! It
totally has an old S.F. vibe to it, real laidback and
comfy. Everyone here is very friendly and open. The
outdoor patio with tons of trees, plants, and big red
umbrellas is great, especially since we're on the
sunny side of market street (corner of market and
noe). 

At night we play some very good music that i think
most people on this list would enjoy alot. quite often
thru the night customers come up to me and ask what
music we're playing, so mix cd's will be on the menu
soon as well. (music includes mnml, detroit, house,
acid, neo-trance,indie, etc...)

Please come and say hi to me (theron k.) and i'll make
ya someting special to drink (we serve alcohol, mix
drinks, and wine until midnight) I just moved back
into town after living in mexico playing for the
puerto vallarta chamber orchestra and i'm hoping to
meet new people that enjoy the same kind of music and
people that i do. 

cheers!,
-theron k.

Cafe Flore (corner of market and noe in S.F.)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Minimal sucks, glad Bone is coming to SF

I love tech house, tech-funk.  You'd have to be an idiot or a purist not to 
see the value in that fusion.

Breaky techno, great.  Techy breaks, fine.  I just like tracks that make 
your ear work and make you wonder what the fuck is really going on while you 
can't stop stomping your feet.

And you're totally right.  Every OW event I've been to, last one was the 420 
Heather Heart pump, has been reminding me of why I moved up to the bay area 
in the first place.

Kontrol events ... after four vodka waters I was still ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

Marco, e-mail me please when techno events happen.  I can't keep my ear to 
the ground all the time.  :)

love always

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Minimal sucks, glad Bone is coming to SF

Over the last several years we've created a sweet little techno scene in 
Reno and Sacramento.

We've had Frankie Bones, Ian Lehman, Dustin Zahn, Chris Liberator, Aaron 
Liberator, Julian Liberator (twice), Ant, DDR (twice), Patrick DSP, DAVE the 
Drummer, Sarah FAB, Rachel Racket, Brad, Brian, Praxis and tons of other 
locals.

All since '02.

I love the floor stomping techno and we've got a pretty good crowd diggin it 
to.  For Frankie Bones we had just about 1000 people, one room.

Its still out there its just a different generation.

There's been so much interest in techno that I have started a new company to 
showcase techno on the west coast.  Over the last few years I've met a lot 
of cool people who are still pushing the sound. Anybody is welcome to have a 
link on there. I made stickers and am working on the main site which will 
have artist profiles, downloadable mixes, and event calendars for the artist 
and shows in general.

www.leftcoasttechno.com

:)

I'm already out of the stickers they went like hot cakes and were just the 
the image you seen on the site now.

We're trying to collect the main promoters around techno spectrum
together in one place, as is DEF. A short and growing list of Western
US outfits are on www.freqbox.net

58 Tehama/Microfon
Auralism Records
Bassaholics Anonymous
Blasthaus
Communikey Festival of Electronic Arts
Compression LA
Decibel Festival
Deeper Moods
Dope Recordings
Droid Behavior
Filter SF (BABD)
Kontrol
Omniscient Records
Staple
Technosol

So ya, we're just one of many dedicated souls who are evolving the
sound. Thanks everybody for all that you do to keep techno kicking
around here (supporting it, DJing it, promoting it or eating it after
midnight) and if we've left anybody off this list, let us know.

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] Tonight!! Filter Freqs out at Anu with [a]pendics.shuffle [LIVE Tech__?]

If you haven't heard L.A.'s [a]pendics.shuffle yet, here's your chance
tonight. Only $5 at the cool as bleep Anu, downtown SF. Bio and music
DL below.

I have a few GL spots available for entry before 10:30 for all you
good time hard up techoo seekers.

PM if interested.

SK

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

West Coast minimal techno label Adjunct-Audio label features founders
[a]pendics.shuffle and Konstantin Gabbro (Los Angeles) hit Anu, Friday
July 27 with a special $5 show.

Plus opening DJ sets by Filter femmes Saya+ Solekandi

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Kenneth James Gibson aka [a]pendics.shuffle (Adjunct, Los Angeles)

Since the late 1990's Kenneth James Gibson has produced countless
releases under multiple monikers, including Eight Frozen Modules,
[a]pendics.shuffle, KJ Gibbs and dubLoner. Since December alone,
Mr.Gibson has produced nine new releases for Adjunct, Orac, Mo's Ferry
and Lessizmore that firmly establish this LA producer as one of most
prolific forces in experimental, "computer funk" dance music
production.

Apendics.Shuffle Liveset DL here:
http://www.adjunct-audio.com/KJG/apendics.shuffle_LA_djset_2007.mp3

One of the early West Coast evangelists of minimal techno, Konstantin
Gabbro is the founder of Seattle's homegrown Orac Records, a label
that launched Bruno Pronsato and Kenneth James Gibson's
[a]pendics.shuffle moniker into the realm of the international
techorati.

In 2003 Konstantin moved down the Pacific Coast to Los Angeles where
he and Gibson (KJG) launched another label =96 Adjunct - a forward
thinking techno outlet that releases critically acclaimed collectibles
from names such as John Tejada, Pheek and newcomer mystery man
Altiply.

A combination of Gabbro's well-schooled knowledge of deconstructed,
experimental techno with Gibson's mojo-laden epic Live PA sets goes
well beyond their description of "funky computer music".

Subject: RE: [sfraves] I have a confession to make.

I gave up confessing when I stopped being a practicing Catholic.

Suffice it to say, I swipe the $.05 candy from the grocery store if they 
have "Bull's Eyes" in the mix. Caramel and that nappy sugar/creme filling is 
the jammy.

You can take that a step farther and say that if you suggest they read
they'll call you a tool.

I started working on this mix in December of 2002, when I first got decks
and started learning how to play. I've done a lot of different versions of
this and played with many different playlists, but I think this one is good
enough that I can put it to rest and now think about it any more. It's quite
a bit harder than the liquid funk I usually play. To those who say I play
gay dnb, this is my fuck you. Comments are appreciated. Hope you like it.

Nice TL!

And Liquid/Neuro is NOT "GHEY" d&B - it's fucking AWESOME. Period. Pretty 
much all I spin actually.

At my ex's folks house up on Sterling (near Grizzly Peak) you can actually 
hear the Greek Concerts fairly well...no view, but who needs a view when 
it's free and you can drink/toke/fuck/whatever to the music w/ no hassle.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] btw, DAFT PUNK!!!!

I'm a big fan of the Indian Rock area over by Sterling, and any scenic 
pull-off on Grizzly Peak, as well as the one kiddy kinda exploratorium type 
spot near Lawrence Berkeley Labs. Good shit, GREAT views. On a clear day 
from that spot, u can see almost allthe way down to the Dumbarton Bridge, 
and all the way up to the Richmond Bridge....

And when there's fog in SF, it looks like its floating in the clouds.

Here's to good times!!!

dangrsmind@yahoo.com wrote: Yup.  And there aren't many where I haven't done at least one of the following: smoked, drinked, puked, or had sex. 

Specifically at the park across form the Rose Garden, Codornices, I recall drinking & smoking while an ex girlfriend showed off her new pet racoon.  She got upset when some people tried to get the racoon high.

There was also this really hot girl there I liked at the time but who turned out to be gay. Damn it.

Ah memories...

Or even a nice toke/drink at the Rose Garden or the park across the street 
from it. So many nice spots in Berkeley to chill!

Megan's feeling a little under the weather, so consequently I have an extra ticket. 

I want someone to roll with me from San Jose, at 6, so that's one of the conditions. NO "MEETING YOU THERE" crap. 

Also, $20 for gas would be cool. Other than that, the ticket is yours (I paid a little over $100 for it) FREE, and you have a ride to SJ and back.

Goes to the first 420-friendly head that replies. Sorry, only have room for one, and you HAVE to roll (ride, not drop) with me. If I have to drive alone, I'm just going to scalp the sucker.

Heh heh. If you hadn't specified 'ride' this would look like a craigslist post.

Subject: [sfraves] 2 FNF campout Tickets for sale & ride needed to willits

Hi, my ride flaked at the last minute and stranded in SF with two
extra tickets to the Friends and Family campout at camp n' sons in
Willits. My boy john and I need a ride from fell and divisadero in sf
and we have both been there 8+ times so we are excellent navigators
and can help with gas, driving, supplies etc.

If you cannot offer a ride but want the tickets and directions we
would still like to recoup the $63 ticket price. Music every night and
poolside on 400 acre private ranch till sunday and meals provided, the
place has three hot tubs shower/bath facilities.

its a sweet party and hoping to not miss dragn'fly's set tonight late,
lots of great music all weekend.

Please email or call 14157044733. we can leave anytime as we were
packed and ready and took cab to sf to meet ride.

... with the 1015 and ruby sky people involved?

My roommate is trying to convince me to go to the Tiesto thing  
tonight.  I actually wouldn't mind seeing Tiesto, though I'm not  
about to buy into the hype and mess myself over him.  And, truth be  
told, if it were a pure Skills party I might even have been lined up  
to get a presale the first day they came out.

But now, with the presales long gone, and Skills having invited the  
1015 and ruby sky people along to run the party with them (And  
therefore have the clubber element there, instead of ravers...); I'm  
having a hard time convincing myself that it's worth the $75.

So is it really?  At this point, I'm tending towards no and thinking  
of looking for something smaller and cheaper and not clubby.  But  
I've only ever gone to the real Skills parties, not the ones where  
they let 1015/spundae or ruby sky tag along; so, despite the bad  
things I've heard about the mix, I've no real basis for forming an  
opinion.

Is it worth $0.75 to see Tiesto? Probably not.

FYI. this show in not just about tiesto, it is about having quality promoters 
putting together a quality party. there will be visuals and lighting that 
will blow your mind!!!! the talent is phenomenal. the house room has derrick 
carter, mark farina, doc martin, the opel hosted room has uberzone, hyper, lee 
combs, baby Anne, and syd gris. the main room has of course tiesto and deep 
voices. If that is not enough then go towards Santa Cruz somewhere and start a 
barbecue so, u can attend the acid totem party when announced.

I once passed Dr. Demento on the 101 near Sacramento about 12 years ago.

He had vanity license plates on his car and a little bit of semaphoric 
hand-signalling on my part as I drove alongside him confirmed his identity.

Here are the lyrics you're looking for as well as a mash-up, GIYF:

An under-educated populace, incapable of critical thinking, feeds 
churches well, which is what we're seeing now with the growth of the 
Evangelical Movement, as a direct result of the past 25 years we spent 
on a concerted, across the board effort to dismantle our public school 
system.

This used to be one of my old .sig lines:

Try reading The Bible, Koran, or any of these ancient mystical texts, 
sometime. They're mostly gibberish. This is one of the better 
descriptions of what I'm talking about http://tinyurl.com/fg9ep that 
I've ever read.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

Point taken about less religion and politics and more rave.  I've been  
reading a lot of books no one really wants to read but anyway I see a  
lot of good quotes in them and articles I read on the internet I find  
good ones too, well "good" meaning I like them.  I think when I get  
back I'll run the original quote series from 1996 just for kicks, back  
in the day before I ever heard of the term conspiracy theorist and  
before I ever gave much thought to OKC being an inside job.  ANYWAY,  
have fun this week you guys and hope you enjoyed the Daft Punk show.   
I'm really sorry I missed that one.  - DF

There's a old family heirloom, that I've been promised, that's been in 
my family since about the time of the American Civil War, or some time 
before that, that's a unique military award, that was given to one of my 
ancestors by a Prussian King.

This relative of mine was supposed to *not* engage the enemy in a 
certain battle, but he went ahead and disobeyed that particular order 
and won the battle, which as it it turns out, was a decisive one, so 
instead of being relieved of duty and being sent to the brig, to be made 
an example of, he got the award instead.

As far as what Joint Chief of Staff USMC General Pace says in the QOD 
below goes, it sounds real good, and everybody from a 2nd Looie, on up, 
will utter some variant of it to those below them, but the practical 
reality for the ground pounding grunt, the one that's stuck having to 
follow the order, is that even after the smoke clears, and the dust 
settles, good luck getting anyone to see your side of it.

For every Jessica Lynch that testifies before Congress about military 
malfeasance, there are thousands of stories that will never see the 
light of day.

I went to the tiesto party, it was was not worth the $$$$$. I had fun, but yea.  The whereouse party we went to afterwards was better.

combs, baby Anne, and syd gris. the main room has of course tiesto and deep 
voices. If that is not enough then go towards Santa Cruz somewhere and start a 
barbecue so, u can attend the acid totem party when announced.

Was that the party with Jeno?  Just wondering, how was the
decor/lighting/visuals there-  I was wondering if all this lived up to the
braggaccio built around these elements?

First stopped by Peter's for the crab feed w. Marco (Peter & Marco both played some badass house sets, btw). 

Next, went to the El Circco (sp?) party on Saturday off ILL. We were going to stop by Rooz's party too, but didn't have time. EC was totally badass! The party was pretty-much packed all night, vibe was in full effect, and the DJ's were tight. Not my genre, but sometimes I guess it's good to step out of the box a little. 

peace

yea the visuals were cool, especially in the smaller rooms with lots of
 black light stuff goin on & lights. i expected more in the main room
 but it wasnt as dark in there either. I think cuz it was the civic
 center it just doesnt have the same feel, but the bathrooms were clean!
  having the large main room was nice, i could go up and watch from the
 balcony or chill on the floor. stupid idiots walking around smoking
 ciggerettes tho.
  overall it was cool, but naaa not worth the money! (i paid $55).
 coudlnt believe how many ppl were standing in line to buy their tickets at
 the door for $75

Schools were deliberately dismantled from the moment Reagan took office, 
Busch is now finishing the job.

A populace incapable of critical thought works well for both the 
Churches and Fox News Corp.

Neat thing is is that they got a major assist by duping the Evangelicals 
to push their Creationist agenda.

I'm about due for a freshie. Will try to get something recorded this weekend if time allows. 

Thanks for the props, but you know I don't hold a candle to the Corey's. (ehm, I'll let Marco clarify on that one.)

HAHA! The premier episodes of the 2 Corey's aired on A&E last night. Suffice 
it to say the Mario Bros. were in attendance for that little gem.

Folks,

Please circulate this to your communities.  Every donation makes a =20
difference.

Peace,  Anthony

Folks,

Here's some more information about the Blood Drive and Funkification =20
happening Sunday at 7th Heaven in Berkeley.  Though you CAN just drop =20=

in to give blood, it's better for the Red Cross folks if you make an =20
appointment online (see below), so they know roughly how many folks =20
to expect.

I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you have a good-sized meal before =20
coming in to donate.  It will keep your stomach settled.
Northern California blood banks are chronically short of blood, more =20
so than in the rest of the country.  Your donation can make a big =20
difference.  I have given blood every six weeks for the last few =20
years, and I feel it's a great way to contribute to the community.

As has been noted, homosexual males aren't eligible to give blood.  =20
This is determined by the FDA, NOT the Red Cross, so please don't let =20=

this affect your support of the organization.  Also, the Red Cross =20
does not test for the presence of alcohol or other stimulants/=20
depressants when you give blood. Check out the Bay Area Red Cross =20
website at http://www.bayarea-redcross.org/ for more information =20
about donating, as well is information about volunteering and CPR/=20
First Aid training.

Please join us, even if you can't (or can't bear to) give blood.  You =20=

can still help out by making a donation (by cash or check) to the Red =20=

Cross, and you can still...

---

...get your groove on before or after donating.  There will be two =20
waves or cycles to the dance:

1:00-3:00 PM
A student of Shiva Rae, TaraKali presents a Yoga Trance Dance - an =20
exploration of the eternal flow of natural movement through yoga.  =20
Beginning with Sahaja prana yoga or the experience of prana =20
initiating yogasanas, yoga trance dance flows into liberating breath =20
guided free-form movement to activate ones creative life force and =20
cultivate embodied freedom.

3:00-4:30 PM
DJ Betty Ray continues the journey with a freeform dance, busting out =20=

some new tracks and funky foot-stompin=E2=80=99 Sunday summertime =20
celebration goodness.

---

PLEASE FORWARD THIS WIDELY.  Every donation makes a difference.

Peace,  Anthony

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Underworld, Chemical Brothers

tickets for Underworld go on sale Sunday, i believe.

and though the Warfield ticket link doesn't have both shows,
listed...the underworldlive and underworld myspace page have two shows
listed for SF.  one on the 7th and one of the 8th.

FYI, oakenfold is playing the same show on the 7th. not sure about the 8th.

you know - i listen to the underworld/dust brothers/chemical brothers 
catalogues
on vinyl and cd and for whatever reason my most enthusiastic reaction
is "ho-hum" - but LIVE they are something else altogether - AMAZING -
even without Darren Emerson - shows at the Galleria, Civic, Filmore, HJ Kaiser,
and a few others I'm spacing on - yeah, they ARE that good live

All I know is I've been crazy about both artists.  Underworld comes to the 
bay once or twice a year and they have all the old school ravers in 
attendance.  Buy your tickets while you can.

Chem Brothers, omg.  They are one of the best live shows.  They don't hold 
back.

I will get my ass to both, believe you me.

love always

I can't remember where I got this quote, it might have been one of Rob  
Brezny's astrology columns or something like that.  Anyway, I hope you  
all are working on your dream boards and have a Tangerine Tuesday,  
just because I made that up just now and it sounds fruity.

Bam wrote: tickets for Underworld go on sale Sunday, i believe.

and though the Warfield ticket link doesn't have both shows,
listed...the underworldlive and underworld myspace page have two shows
listed for SF. one on the 7th and one of the 8th.

FYI, oakenfold is playing the same show on the 7th. not sure about the 8th.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Wed)

An update on this, Mike Ruppert claims he may have been poisoned, you  
can find on his website the whole story.  I generally feel the same  
way as him, though, I am not really that important.  6 billion other  
people.

May we all survive until 2012 when the earth's axis tilts and everyone  
except those that are buying my products will meet their fate.

--

The question I am asked most frequently at lectures is why I haven't
been killed yet.  I have two answers.  First, it is not
cost-effective, and the response would cause more problems than it
would solve.  I am not important enough to kill.

Secondly, I will not die one minute before God has decided.

- Michael Ruppert, "Crossing the Rubicon"
