Subject: Oracle was a smash....


        I was in the city giving something to Cindy to take back east with
her on her trip this weekend, so I decided to stop by 1015 Folsom on the
off off chance I could hope of getting in for Oracle.  

	It was just after 2, so I guess the after-2 policy that used to apply 
to C/U applied here to, and after a breif pause at the asking price ($10 is a 
bit much for a weeknight thang, even if it does all go to Mal)  was on my 
way in.  
	
	It felt JUST like a Come/Unity with about half to a third as many 
people.  I saw lots of familiar faces, net and non-net (jeez, don't you 
people have LIVES??? :):) and Markie Mark was playing a very nice bassy 
head trippy set so I was hooked.  

	The DJ setup was right in front of the stage, where it should be; 
the entire upstairs was open, including this backroom area with lots of
windows which was the chill-out zone, and Jonah was spinning some cool ambient.
Beanbags, beanbags, nothing but beanbags!!  it was great.  The light setup was 
on full and looked VERY nice.  The crowd size was enough to keep the dancers 
warm on the dance floor, and yet gave them enough room to move around quite 
nicely (my main complaints about Come/Unitys is always the overcrowding, so 
this was a pleasant change).  

	Spun came on around 3 and played a truely god-like set; he's come back 
a little more to his "tweaker" music days of about 9 months ago when I really 
really liked him, instead of the more hip-hop he was at about 5 months.  But 
I can definitely see the impact his spinning hiphoppish grooves has had on 
the SF scene; lots of DJ's are now getting funky and "rediscovering" a lot of 
old 1987-ish tracks;  and when I was in LA at Joachim's radio show, the two 
large-name LA DJ's played an incredibly funky set - at least half of their 
song set was songs from tape 1 of the Vision tapes  (Spun's ultra phunky 
contribution to the set).  And overall, I think it's been a Good Thing - I
think Spun introduced a lot of creative energy into the music scene here.

	Also, there IS a future forum gig going on tonight Friday night, but
it probably won't get started until after 2am or so.  Seems that any party
starting after then is ignored.  Is it just coincidence that the bars close
then????  Hmmmm!

	Brian

Subject: Re: Aren't raves physical poetry set to music?

Apropos all this stuff about permits and staging a demonstration outside
City Hall...

I think there are more constructive ideas we can pursue first.  For example,

-  calling that lawyer Mike W. referred us to.  (action item, me)

-  contacting Supervisor Hallinan, our patron saint on the Bd. of Supes if
        ever we had one.  (action item, me)

-  doing very small scale outdoor guerilla-raves (just boombox, no visuals),
        in interesting places (downtown plazas like Levi-Strauss, etc.,
        Fort Point underneath the GG Bridge, the original C2 site, etc.) just
        to see how long we get away with it.  If they clamp down on us,
        we'll just regroup somewhere else!  Thirty or forty people would
        be about the right size...  Just the kind of thing Jason described in
        The Imaginal Rave.  I'm psyched to try something like this.  I've
        scouted out some good locations, too...

        (emphasis on NO GENERATOR, NO BIG SOUND-SYSTEM.  Mobility is the key.)

If we *have* to do a City Hall demonstration, I'd recommend Friday evening as
all the city workers are leaving work for the weekend.  If we do it on
Saturday far fewer people will really notice, and it'll have less impact.

And on a related topic:

Is it a good time to start talking about this desert/rave outing?  I say early
May would be good to shoot for...  I'm really up for doing this and will
help organize...

I'd like to encourage anyone listening to consider not going to Vision
tomorrow and going to Groove Kitchen instead.  AstroBoy, Leg of Eel, myself
and others are planning to do just that.  They have a shiny new location
(Big Heart City), and will probably give great production...  The crowd won't
be *that* bad (after 2, anyway  ;^)

You just know Vision is going to be a zoo...  Plus it's way out in the
boondocks again.  They're going to use the same site for the big Malachy
benefit on the 17th, and if forced to choose between the two, I lean towards
waiting.  Plus, Eddie Richards was *incredible* the last GK he played in
January, and I keep hearing good things about Rick Preston...

I know this doesn't sound too appealing to the 21-- crew, but for the rest
of us it's nice to know there are options...

Have fun, whatever!

Well, I don't smoke now, but used to when I was younger.

I first started in high school (8th grade) - young impressionable - thought it
was cool.  I remember my first drag - choking and dizzy, it about killed me!

I quit by the time I graduated, because by then I knew it was bad for me.  Plus,
I had left trying to 'be cool' behind and become more individualistic (hell
if everybody else is going to smoke, I'll quit!).

I started again sometime during my freshman year - I was stressed out over
basic first year pressures of changing a major, dealing with the
bureaucratic hassles, working shit jobs, et al.  It doesn't really make sense
that these should be reasones to start, but they sure are reasons to avoid
quitting - withdrawal being just one more pressure.  

I finally quit when I got up to 2 packs a day (menthol no less) and started
to cough up nasty little - well never mind.  I quit cold turkey one day and
carried a half a pack around for a week telling myself that if I wanted to
die a miserable death to go ahead and light up.  Worked for over 5 years.

But... I guess once a smoker always a smoker - just like the alcoholic.
Started again (ironically) at a rave.  Looking back on this, I was under
alot of stress from all sides (work, home, relationship, etc.)  

This time it didn't last long.  I already knew that my smoking was a cop
out and that it was really stupid.  I hated the stale breath, I hated the smoke
in my eyes and on my clothes, people hated me for smoking around them, and
it made me feel like total shit.

I decided to take a nice long vacation and quit the day I left.  Haven't
smoked since and don't think I will again.  

Maybe this gives some insight into 'why a smoker', maybe not.  I'm not one
for coming up with psychological profiles, but maybe I fit into one that 
would explain my behavior.  Hopefully, in this day when it is becoming more
socially UNacceptable to smoke, more people will find it easier to kick and
stay off.

Subject: Confrontation, Publicity, and TAZ's

I just listened to a tape of the Hakim Bey / R.A. Wilson / Nick Herbert
talks that happened a couple of months ago.  Bey had some interesting
remarks worth noting in our debate about demonstrations and the media.
He was describing various forms in which attempts at TAZ's have manifesting
themselves and offering constructive criticism about their shortcomings:

        The problems lie in two areas:  philosophical & organizational.
        Some groups fail to realize the full implications of their
        reaction against The Spectacle, which remains instinctual
        & hence philosophically unsound.  For example, the 1960's
        delusion that we can use the media for our own ends still
        persists so that many groups are ruined by the very publicity
        they thought they needed in order to attain their goals...

        Publicity is a bad tactic, while tact and virtual clandestinity
        are good tactics.

He noted that most would-be TAZ's fall into two camps:  ones that are
politically astute but haven't mastered the Pleasure Principle, and those
based on lifestyle that are politically naive.

The tape on the whole is fabulous and well worth hearing.  Plus, it's all
new and unpublished material (you mean you still haven't read the book?  =)
Way more interesting than Terrence McKenna's recent rap IMHO.

If people are interested I'll make a few copies and start circulating them
around.  Send me e-mail and I'll compile a circulation list.  Please indicate
whether you are located in:

        San Francisco / Marin
        East Bay / Davis / Sacramento
        Peninsula / South Bay / Santa Cruz

	Brothers and Sisters,

	I just completed a workshop on _Strategic Questioning_.

	"_Strategic Questioning_ is the skill of asking the questions that

	and a special type of listening.  Anyone can use strategic questions
	in their lives to liberate friends, coworkers, political allies and

				-- Fran Peavey

	What I realized from the workshop is that this is EXACTLY the thing
	that I do with the Police when I "talk" to them at events.  What
	I got out of the workshop was the tools to teach other people
	how to do it (I think! :).

	If anyone is interested in learning about this stuff let me know
	and if there is enough interest, I'll do a mini-workshop one
	afternoon, maybe at charter oak or something. There is a booklet
	that goes with the information which I can xerox, If I do, I should
	ask for a donation of maybe $2 - $5.  Since the people who diseminate
	this info are not wealthy and have been gracious enough to allow us
	to copy it, under those guidelines.  We could get nice bound
	editions for $6.  If I get a LOT of interest (over 5) then, I'll ask
	everyone to contribute $5 - $10 and we`ll have some food or something.

	I'm sure you'll get your $10 worth.


	I'd like more people on the Scene to be able to do this, I can't
	come to every event and negotiate with the cops and the more people
	trained the better.

Well , it worked!

 Leah's planning and MykL's plotting combined perfectly Saturday night - the
birthday party for Brian at Charter Oak was a real surprise for 
Mr. Vitamin B ! 

 Things were frantic at 8:00PM , as MykL was desperately trying to find some 
cables to complete the sound system. We even considered calling Brian to
ask him for a cable loan "for Mark at Charter Oak" ! Luckily , we found 
some cables left on the floor downstairs. 

 The IHOP menu birthday card was really cute - almost everyone got to sign it
before Brian received it. The cakes were very clever - Chocolate turntables
with beige frosting slip covers and chocolate pastry tonearms!

 Good music provided by three DJ's - ( please Jon , ID the other DJ's for
me/us ). I hope their feelings weren't hurt by the ebb and flow of the
small crowd - all the people who were dancing seemed to get tired and leave
the dance floor at the same time.

 Thanks also to:

 1. The (non-existant) police.
 2. Mark from Ameba for letting Leah hold the party at Charter Oak.
 3. Geoff White for the ambient sonic serinade for the chill space upstairs.
 4. Everybody else involved in the carrying-out of this party!

My First Groove Kitchen/MEGA-VISION

 After the Brian B'Day party at Charter Oak ,  people split up to various
raves, or home. I decided to try Groove Kitchen for the first time , and 
maybe VISION if I had the time/energy. 

 Well , at $10 , Groove Kitchen was OK. I saw Chris Beumont , Derek Chung ,
Lee Fogel , and others there - Craig Larson was doing the video mixing.

 For some reason , the mood for me wasn't there for Groove Kitchen. It
may be that I was a bit tired from dancing at Charter Oak , or maybe it
was the inability to really excape the sound system if that's what was
required. That didn't stop other folks from having an obviously good
time , so it must have just been a sum of intangibles.

 So, at 3:10Am (post-spring forward time) , I left Groove Kitchen and drove
to the Richmond auditorium/gymnasium , next to City Hall , for VISION.

 Showed ID , got frisked . Spent about 10 minutes looking through the 
glass doors at the barely 18-or-older crowd , deciding whether I should shell
out the $20 . I edged toward the last ticket booth. A little drama there - 
two gals , only one has a ticket ,the other is digging through her purse and
hit her friend up for a total of $10 - ticket girl says sorry , no deal.
"These are the last three tickets" the ticket gal says , holding them
up for the two girls to see. Miss $10 begs her to hold one ticket until she 
can run back to the car to burrow around for more money. The ticket gal
says OK - this leaves two. I make my decision , and buy the second-to-last
ticket. As I leave , I hear the guy behind me ask for two tickets ...

 Well - it was MEGA! Lotsa people - it looked like a rock concert without 
a stage-crush or mosh pit ( Well, there was a bit more congestion near the
DJs , but that's expected ). Warm enough for the male bare chest crowd 
and a few topless ( but not braless ) gals. [ a sociological aside - is this
the a foreshadowing of the effect on our culture of using real women in 
undergarment ads ? ]. Body/attitude types ranging from skinny/trancy to
buff/jock . Lotsa guys doing fancy dance moves. 

 Sound quality - Ok , could have been better distributed and cleaner, but
I've heard worst. ( I'll let Brian , Marlo , Derek Yu , and others post
their opinions on the quality of the music & mixing ). 

 If it was warm on the main floor , it was rainforest hot and humid in the
aptly named Bermuda Room , where some funky house was being played. Steamed
my glasses up! I wish I had found the room earlier - I like the music a lot
more than the main floor.

 There was another side room for psychic readings - $$ to go to Malachy.
Another room was the "chill room" - the open doors to the hallway kind of
spoiled the sound isolation from the main floor , and sometimes the DJ
would slam a hard techno track into the ambient mix - I guess he was 
bored.

 One of the most obvious benefits of this location is that there's no lack
of a place to sit down - surprisingly to me , the security wasn't even asking
people not to sit on the staircases leading from the lobby to the balconey.
From the way security acts at Shoreline and the Oakland Colesium , it's as if

Subject: excessive flyering! (a rant)

Has anyone else noticed the recent dramatic increase in the
volume of rave flyers that get shoved in our unwitting, our-own-
business-minding faces at raves?  It used to be that I would go
out and get just a couple things, usually for afterparties the
following morning (a pretty logical thing to get flyers for).
But now it seems I can't escape a rave without pockets and hands
full of flyers.  The worst was at Pure -- it seemed that every
other person was trying to give me some huge flyer or another.  Not
only is this a waste of paper, but it's illogical since most people
don't go to parties with shopping baskets or any other way to 
transport such big flyers.  The result of this over-flyering is
probably that most of them get dumped on the floor and the place
gets trashed!  And it's not even like flyering at raves is a 
way to get a given scene to continue at another event, it's just
degenerated into a huge publicity machine!  Has the rave information
network become sheer advertising?

I'm happy to get a small, pocket-sized flyer offered to me on occasion,
or to have a flyer table set up by the entrance or elsewhere.
But I don't want to have to feel like I'm turning down door-to-door
salespeople just 'cos I don't want 8 industrial-size flyers for Power, 
X-Lax, Curious George, Visionquest, or Wally World!!!!! 

Sorry to rant and rave....  Love, Jessica

Subject: Re:  First Groove / MEGA-VISION


I had lotsa doubts went i went to Vision..
first was that the last time i went to The Richmod Civic Center, it was the
	Imag. Nation turned Cool World (UGH....)
second was the shocking $20 price tag...  we had thoughts of ditching the place 
and heading out to the Groove Kitchen..  but we bit our lip and pushed foward.

lucky we did, b.c. it was a pretty cool event..  Despite a minority of guys with
big hair, big biceps, and big heads, the majority was a strong friendly high
energy crowd..  it was actuallt unusual for me to go to such a large rave and
still encounter such a positive vibe..  that was good...

as far as the music goes, Larry..  i guess the word to describe it was sketchy.
the quality of the system was good, but throughtout the night, that were 
stretches of great tunes (lasting maybe 30 minutes), but then the DJ's got
lazy or something and started spinning some boring overdone stuff for about 15-20 mintues..   to rememdy this problem, i was a frequent commuter between the chill out room and the main room..

the Dj in the chill room was the same way...  there would be strecthes of mind
blowing ambient stuff..  then he will kill the mood w. some hardcore..  
the music was kinda inconsistant in both rooms..

and right on LArry.. the music was pretty hot in the Bermuda Room..  i liked it
a lot..  but it was jsut too hot,, i danced there for about 20 minutes and came 
out drenched out with sweat..  the horrid thought of actually taking my shirt
off b.c. i felt so uncomfortable came to me..  But NO!!!  i will not stoop
so low.. i found a cool fan in the main room and danced and cooled off at the 
same time...

another strange thing i notice at Vision were the cops.. there were a lot.
not security cops, but full pledged Richmond Police Officers carrying automatic
pistols..  scared me at first but i later forgot about them..  i wonder if they 
were there for crowd control or to stop the sale of drugs..  and if they actually
harrased or arrested anyone....


that is all..  i hope everyone had a good time either at the Groove Kitchen,
at Brian's Surprise Party, at Vision, or just chiiling elsewhere..
Peace....

Subject: Surprise b-day party and Vision were *wonderful*

        I still can't believe over 200 people knew about it (maybe 300)
and I didn't... well I had HINTS every now and then, but when Tuesday passed
and I went out to dinner with a few people, I figured oh well, it probably
never came together, and I wasn't sad at all because of the wishes on the
list and stuff... so when Mykl and Howard invited me to dinner Sat. night in
the city I was clueless, as usual :):)  Even when he called me in a frantic,
wondering if I had any speaker cables :):)  I did start to suspect something
when we drove to charter oak, and howard asked to stop to get a bottled drink
from a grocery store... I thought, wait, we're on our way to dinner, why...?
And then we pulled up to charter oak, and I saw a car that looked JUST LIKE
Mike Wertheim's, and as we pile out of the car we see a blue volvo pull up,
and I can hear music coming from inside.  Uhoh, someone's having another 
party here.  Sheesh, the cops'll prolly come and bust this too!  The hunch
that something was up started to grow, and when we walked up to the upper
lounge area and it was dark and I could see people sitting in there I was
pretty much certain by that point :):)  I was wearing a red sweater, and 
supposedly I got even redder than the sweater when everyone yelled "surprise!".

Thanks to Andrea for the awesome SL1200 cakes, to Jon and Lee and his friend
Thomas for spinning, to everyone who I met for the first time there, and most
opf all to Leah who I understand is the mastermind behind all this :):) 
And thanks to everyone for the awesome present; I have an Alpine detachable
face-plate stereo all picked out and ready to be installed tomorrow afternoon.
Thank you thank you thank you!


Anyways, Marlo and I headed off to Vision afterwards... $20 is the most I'd
ever pay for an event and it almost guarantees I'm going to be hypercritical
about it, and I was... I've been to two raves held here before, and I don't
think I've ever seen HALF as many people there as were at Vision.  Whoever said
it looked like a concert was right; before entering we went to the balcony and
looked down, and it was wall-to-wall people; they looked like they had just
enough room to dance, and not much more.  

	Suspended from the 40" ceiling was a huge parachute, which formed a 
tent over the crowd... right on front of the tent was stretched a big white 
sheet with Donovan's inimitable projections being thrown on top.  All around
the place were flourescent lights and flourescent banners, typical of a 
Martin-produced event.... I could have gone for a little more light on
the main dance area, but twice during the night they turned on the house
lights to the cheers of everyone there (Anyone at a rave where this was done
knows how cool this is; a good example was Let Freedom Rave last year, the 
crowd went ballistic.)  

	The crowd was very good - contrary to the last event of this scale I 
went to (Gathering New Year's Eve) I was able to find everyone there I was
looking for, there were NO lines for anything anywhere, and even though it
was packed it never felt CROWDED or stuffy (except for the Bermuda room, heh).
The "X" factor was very high; but at the same time so was the Shirtless Guys
Factor (tm) and the Jeans and Black Brassiere Women Factor (tm).  C'mon 
people!  This is not Vogue meets Kraftwerk!  :)  

	The music was definitely on par; I arrived during Tony's set, and
it definitely sounded a lot more harsh and fast than his other sets, but it
still worked for me... Jeno came on next (as best I can tell ;), and played
his usual godlike set; both Tony and Jeno played this one terrific song that
was entirely appropriate for April 4th - "The Dream" by Out of the Ordinary.
It has a really terrific pounding beat and a wonderful acid melody line on
top, with samples from Martin Luther King liberally spread through it.  This
is Yet Another song from a couple of years ago that the DJ's have decided to
resurrect, with a good deal of success.  I've had "The Dream" for about _5_ 
years....   Anyways, I was getting pooped so I left soon after Garth had
taken on the wheels of steel, and he was tearing up the crowd, sucking them
for every ounce of energy they had left at 6AM (with DST 7AM)... and when I
left there were still maybe 90% of the peak # of people still on the dance
floor, and incredible statistic in my book.

	The whole time I kept thinking, this is as good as something of this
size in this place can get.  Now if only this were at Bonny Doon... if only
at Bonny Doon... I tried clicking my heels three times but it didn't work, 
I left my Ruby slippers at home... Seriously, though, if that whole rave
could have been transplanted on the sands of BD I would be in heaven, and
would probably have a coronary coz I'd want to die a happy man.

	Anyways, thanks to Larry for driving Marlo back to Santa Cruz in the
morning (you ARE insane), and thanks again for the wonderful b-day everyone!!

Well, to make a long story short, I just quit cigs three days ago
and am now on my fourth.  Pneumonia (sp?) had a lot to do with my
decision to quit, as I got terribly ill (spewing green crap from
my lungs).  I knew I was sick a couple of weeks ago, yet stayed 
out late partying (raving) and to me when I'm out late, cigs were
the best tasting things.  I actually craved them desperately, 
especially when tired, I guess the nicotine perked me up.

Anyways, I couldn't breath and my lungs were filling with stuff, 
so I went to the doc. (I'm hard-headded, it takes a lot for me
to go see one ).  He was empathetic and gave me some lecture that
still rattles in my head.  Thanks to him, my wife and some friends
I am strongly supported with my decision and many praises follow.

Why did I smoke?  The habit of sticking something in my mouth, for
one.  Secondly, I enjoyed the warm smoke entering my lungs and the
slight rush to my head that followed afterwards.  Thirdly, late
hours and my desire to get a rush from the nicotine.  Never did 
I smoke for the "cool"ness of holding a cig like James Dean or any-
one else.  Nor did I smoke because I wanted to be part of a clan.
I was one who truly enjoyed them, even around non-smokers. (I certainly
would step outside, as I did even at home, as to not offend anyone)

Let's hope I can make it through the toughest two weeks of my quitting
period.

Don't know why, but I was at home Sat night, and I did catch a bit of

As I understood, it was actually a series of performances held
in conjunction with NAMM, a music industry trade show. There was
a variety of performances: Garth Brooks, Miami Sound Masheen,
Billy Joel...

> community.

  I know this was in a magazine...which makes it even worse...but this
concept of making LA the Garbage Dump of the scene is making me sick.
I've seen it in posts, in letters, in online comments and have
refrained from commenting before.  But I guess I'll go ahead and
unload.  I'll try to make it short. :)

  man...now where do I start...

I guess somewhere along the line people got the idea that since LA had
a bunch of bad vibe...it must be all their fault...and the only place
that promotors exploit, and that raves were taken to the "Super Above
ground" level, etc.  I suppose it makes people feel better about their
own scenes.

Well it isn't the only place.  

SF is at times just as bad and so is New York, San Diego, Florida, DC,
Detroit...the list is endless.  LA just does everything out of
proportion it seems and got it's lion's share of promotor trash.

I think we were also just about the first place in the US that the
scene got so huge that it collapsed on it's own weight and had to move
on from there.  It happend last Spring and Early Summer.

But all this doesn't mean that the LA area doesn't have a good
community in the scene.  It's just a little harder to find amongst the
10+ millions.  The Flammable's, the Carbonated holy water's, Little
lofts downtown, The Narnia's, The Sunday in the park's, and more that
I can't think of right now.
It's even in the more popular places.  
The community is there and building on itself.

But it certainly doesn't do us any good when people and DJs and
promotors around here go, "LA must suck since that's what everybody
else says."  

If I could take you to some horrible huge exploitative events in SF
then take you to some great small cozy events in LA you might think
that LA is the place to be.  It's all a matter of perspective.

Every scene has it's own problems.  And they also have their gems.

No one has a right to cut down another scene unless they've spent some
time learning the good and the bad.  Even then, what good does it do
to cut something down, if you aren't willing to help build it up
again?

Subject: VISION, a Great time

Well Heres my Vision Story:


I went to the one on Labor day and it is still the Best Rave Ive been too.  I
like raves that are far away because Only the truly devoted to go, Richmond is
not very for many people.  

I went to Vision this time with alot of reservations because I went to cool
world which sucked big time at the same location.  

I thought the Gathering Rave was awesome and the best you can expect for the
turnout that Martin Generate.  I thought I.D.ing everyone was a great idea, it
reduces liability and teeny boppers.  I did not get searched it seemed like
they were only searching backpacks.

 Normally I would go to a rave this size but alot of my friends from the
original one were gonna be there. At first there was a long line that was
moving quickly with few people cutting.  Then they stopped letting people in it
was 1:00 pre DST.  We decided if we werent going to get in by 1:30 Pre DSt that
we would go to Groove Kitchen.  Well the line started again and decided to
shell out $20.00 and go for it.  

I thought it was going to be packed and hot on the main dance floor.  It was
packed but there was plenty of room and it was relatively cool.  I thought the
energy in the Room was incredible, personally I thought the Music and Sound
System was great.  Everybody was really nice, even the shirtless guys.  I
happened to like the Bra and Jean women (hey if you got it, Flaunt it). My
girlfriend, Shannon, had a great time too she said even most of the women there
were nice to her( I can never understand this but she is always saying and I
have noticed this myself that alot of times the other women are mean or unkind
to her. Consider how kind and sweet Shannon is I find this really wierd).

The night was great and I brought a friend Che (future SFRaver) who I danced
HARD from when we got there until we left at 7:30(unaltered) He really
impressed me and Shannon.  At 7:30 we went back to the City dorpped Che off at
home and went to DNA.  It was just getting going.  It was GREAT the place was
hopping big time We were there and finally forced ourselves to leave at 1:45
during Simons Encore set.  Simon play his usual awsome DNA set for over 3 hours
(I think he is another underrated DJ).

After 12 hours of dancing I went home and crashed.  Saturday and Sunday was a
&#%^ blast it was one of the best raving experiences I've had.

Subject: Another Vision Review

Howdy gang...

I too was surprised by the $20 price tag, but nevertheless had avery good
time. One thing that makes me more forgiving of the mugging at the door is
the fact that once inside things were very reasonably priced: bottled
water,aned a variety of fresh juices were _$1_ and free free fruit brought
to you on the dance floor started at about 4:30, there wasn't a whole lot,
but as the saying goes, its the thought that counts.

I for one like the Richmond civic. The cops are a factor, moe early on htan
later, but hey, at least the parties happening. Now if only the S.F. cops
could learn by example... Numerous spaces for chill rooms is also a benefit
of this space; and while the groove room was definitely in need of some
major ventilation, I spent more time than usual in the other chill rooms one
of which started of with ambient sound from one of the guys from spacetime
(sorry I don]t know his name: tall, short hair, always wears a spacetime T).
Key to use of this location is use of the main floor. Imagination turned
Cool World (ugh!! here too) blew it entirely by setting up huge American
Bandstand platforms right in the middle of the dance floor, plus projections
radiating out from the center. Fragmented the space badly creating basically
two long hallways and one small area near the djs. Martin on the other hand
seems to a minimalist in his treatment of the space. Like the last Basics
(raging party I thought) he had a couple of simple but great blacklight
paintings by the same artist. Coincidentally there were two of these (the
ones from basics) at charter oaks last night. Too, the huge parachute was a
nice effect; very housy :) In general the vibe on the floor, and elsewhere
for that matter was GREAT; very positive, lots of smiling faces. I too was
amazed at how many people were just rocking hard at 7 am.

The music was pretty damn good too. It started off a little slow, sending me
to the chill rooms, but Tony, Jeno and Garth, shredded. Tony really stole
the show IMOH. Funny how both he and Jeno spun "the Dream," virtuall an
hour, maybe two apart. Too bad about the rubber on the floor though!! YUCK
really hard to dance on. I much prefer the smooth cardboardy stuff that they
lay down in the fashion center basement.

In conclusion, I too though that sans the price tag, this was about as good
as a huge rave gets...

Also: Tilt-a-whirl, Sundays at 6 at the Trocadero, has real potential. The
guy putting it on, Mark Norby, has got a lotta heart. He did a real nice job
and unfortunately lost money due to a low turnout. The music was really
good, and the visuals nice. Fresh fruit and juice for very reasonable
prices, good energy. Carlos will be a regular at Tilt. He and Dutch both
spun great, trancy sets. La Paix was alright, alittle fast for my tastes in
the morning.. . I left while Dutch was spinning to go to the park. I
actually had a really good time at the park despite the lack of a sound
system.. Luckily, M (xoc) brought a box and we had a good time groovin to
Garth on tape and a few others.

All and all a good weekend!
Peace, and Let the Good Times Rave!

Wow, looks like I'm the first to say something nice about Groove
Kitchen.  I'm not quite ready to declare that Mark Farina is 
Moonpup's personal dj, but his set, followed and nearly surpassed
by Evil Eddie Richards
was about the longest continuous stretch of consistently enjoyable
music I've heard at a rave.  I didn't experience the patented
precussion fatigue that Jeno on occasion induces in the unintoxicated.
Irrepresible bass line, bits of vocals, the odd horn riff, melodies, 
and chants; music can be a wonderful thing.  I got lots of friendly
eye contact, much more than average, and there was, well, lots to look
at in return :).   The black guy in the baggy clothes doning the 
interpretive dancing in the video toaster projection up in the chill
room was just about worth the price of admission.  Not to mention
the bra-and-jeans set downstairs.

I'll definitely go to Groove Kitchen again, the
new location is a big improvement over King St., and they brought
the Synergy visual stuff with them.  Unfortunately, my own energy level 
didn't quite match that around me; I think that had something to do with 
having a truly swell time at Oracle on Thurs/Fri.

	Thak You Joachim,

	I think you are essentially right.  Maybe some of US up here in
	SF should go down to LA one weekend, Luv-Phasers fully locked
	and loaded, with the expresses purpose of being open, spreading
	the vibe, and getting to know our L.A. Sisters and Brothers. I 
	know I've been guilty of LA bashing and I'm willing to give it up.
	{But I'd never wanna live there, tee hee :)

	Maybe we should have a stopover in L.A. during OPERATION
	DESERT DAWN :) the rave in the desert that Mykl wants to do.

Subject: POSTING TO EVERY MAILING LIST (was re: black d o g productions)


About once every day or two there's a post made to EVERY rave mailing list.
(Or most).  I don't mean to sound like a "fussbudget" but are these mega-
crossposts really necessary?  I would think alt.rave would be a much more
logical place to post stuff you think a wide cross-section of people would
be interested in.  I know lots of people on the mailing lists don't have
access to USENET, so maybe an alt-rave-for-non-USENET-people mailing list
could be started.  (Alt.rave needs interesting posts these days anyways.)
I may sound like a turd for saying this but more than one person wrote me
about it....

Subject: Incredible weekend...whew!

Hi All,


Mondays really feel like Mondays after a GOOD weekend.

Gosh, I don't even know where to start.  For the past few weeks, 
I *had* been feeling a bit of burnout, wondering if all of the 
time and energy I put into raving was leading to something real... 
what is "real" anyways?  Something that fits on a resume..?  hmmmm.

Anyhow, Thursday, I went to Oracle and really enjoyed myself.
It was my second time at 1015 (the first being the last Come/UnitY), 
and I thought the size/make-up of the crowd was near perfect.  
Chatted with Mykl, LegOfEel, & AstroBoy for a bit...Lee *almost* 
convinced me to go to Groove Kitchen on Saturday.  :)   Hi, Lee!

Friday, still feeling a bit unenthusiastic, I met up with some friends 
from Palo Alto and met others from Davis at Discotheque.  Not sure how 
others felt about this place, but I know that this experience nearly 
blew my mind.  I got there at the end of Ernie's set (fortunately, missing 
the serious Disco-stuff) of pounding house muziq and almost immediately 
starting feeling a REAL need to dance.  This feeling escalated to the 
point where I felt my consciousness would shatter...unless I danced.
The music stopped around 5:30, which was a bit too early, although the 
crowd was small by then.  I think this weekly has the potential to be 
part of a good Friday night--especially after Smiling Thru comes back.

Saturday, I was drained and ready to bail, but the momentum was
there, and I ended up tagging along to Vision--my first BIG event EVER.
I had very low expectations for this, but the night just took off.
INCREDIBLE   hmmm, easily more than words can express.  If you saw
me, maybe you know what I am talking about.  :)   Again, I hung out 
with folks from Davis & Palo Alto.  These are two groups of people,
that I really just LOVE!!, and I especially realize that now.  Thanks,
people, you know who you are.

Waking up on Sunday, that burnout sensation/emotion was gone...
displaced by a bit of post-euphoria blues, but mostly satisfaction
and anticipation.  I think this weekend provided just enough stimuli
(weellll, maybe I went a little overboard) to re-boot my system.

Hope everyone out there is doing well.  See you all soon.  

Real Soon,
Ravi

Subject: shortened weekend



Thursday:
Realizing that I was going to lose an hour this weekend, I compensated by
starting it on thursday and taking friday off from work:
Oracle is ancient history now and was already covered by Brian & MykL a few
days ago.

Friday:
I spend most of the day doing a pretty good imitation of a vegetable.  But
even vegetables need light, so I did the only thing that could motivate me
when in such a sorry state: CD shopping.   I walked over to BPM and scored
3 for only $80: 2 trance compilations and Polygon Window.  This pretty much 
gaurauntees that they hey will soon be available as cheap domestic releases.
  
Found out that on the 3rd floor above BPMs, every Saturday from 6pm - 9pm, top
DJ's will be spinning for free.  I forget what the're calling it.  Sat. they 
were going to have Neon Lean and Josh.  

Saturday:
My aversion to big-scale raves steered me toward Groove Kitchen, which was a bit
dissapointing.  The space at Big Heart City was an improvement over the King St.
garage, but it never really came together for me.  The sound system and visuals 
were pretty good, but the lighting was dismal and they way overused the fog 
machines. I don't mind breathing some gunk to enjoy a good visual effect, but 
this was just fog for the sake of fog.  Eddie Richards'set got me excited, but
then this really awful saxaphone player decided to play accompianment for the 
rest of the evening, continuously, and in the wrong key.  This and the equally
clueless live percussionists was enough to send me out the door.  Still, despite
my complaining, I could see myself going back there again.

Sunday:
Got to Tilt-a-Whirl at the Bridge Club at around 10:30.  I was told that they 
had been late in setting up the sound system and had to turn a lot of people
away.  Otherwise the place would have been full.  The sound system was a bit 
tinny, but hopefully this will improve.  The lighting was fine, dark and
and sparkly, and the overall feel was much less clubby than the DNA.  
Dutch played an excellent technotrance set.  I definately will be returning 
to this.

I was discouraged to find out that the GG Park was not going to be allowed to
have amplified sound.  Nevertheless, I went with a posse to enjoy the sun and
be with friends.  So we were hanging out with about 200 others, feeling good 
but yearning for the beat.  Then M Normal walks by with a boombox.  We were 
saved!  Pretty soon a large contingent of sfravers and friends had gathered, 
and we danced and hung out and got crazy until about 6pm.

I hope the organizers find a way to bring back a sound system, 
but if they don't, I think we can get by without it.  In fact, we might 
even want to think about doing more boombox raves, smaller, more mobile, 
harder to squash.  A visit to Angel Island, or the original Connection2
site, perhaps.

     Well it all started Saturday evening, most of which I spent waiting for my
ride to Charter Oak. (which never showed up) Brian I'm sorry I couldn't be
there to meet you and help celebrate your birthday, hope you enjoyed the party!
 
     Eventually my ride showed up at about 11:00pm ready to head up to Groove
Kitchen. (They had totally forgot about my pre plans 8( ) Goove Kitchen was at
Big Heart City which was actually a pretty cool little space.  Rick Preston was
on when we got there and he was doing a fine job.  After Rick, Mark Ferrina
played (Jeno had to cancel) and I caught about 20 minutes of his set and then
it was off to Vision.  We got there and Tony was tear'n it up in the big room. 
I took a tour of the huge venue and chilled for awhile up in the bleechers 
which had an incredible view of the dance floor, DJ , and Donovans visuals.  I
stayed to see Tony give way to Jeno and decided to go shake my butt. Terrific
late night thundering acid tracks.  I felt bad for all DJs because they had to
deal with people hovering over the decks. (Please let the DJs breath and give
you a quality set)  At 4 I went to the hot box to listen to Rick Preston who
played a really funky set , good contrast to the main room.  A quick drip dry
then back to Goove Kitchen ( I should have stayed to see Garth in a spin
tingling  closing set and tribute to Mal) to catch the tail end of Evil Eddie
Richards who had a live sax acompaniment that I had missed.  Morning called for
the Buggie Buffet where Rick, Evil Eddie and Ernie played.  others went on to
the End Up, but I was dead and went home to crash.  
     All in all a good vibe everywhere!  

PS   Hi Leah and all other SFravers I didn't get to meet.  Until next time...

OUT!!!  NOW!!!!!!!  so we get left in west Oaktown, 11 blocks from we3st

that brought us out there were gonna bring us back....interesting experience,
but i'm sick of all but the commercial raves getting shutdown.  the piggz
said that they shut it because the promoters had no permit (another cop

Subject: Re: excessive flyering! (and MORE!) 


Well, I actually usually have something I can stash stacks
of flyers in (leather jacket), because I kind of like them
as little pieces of pop art, despite the fact that they have
little effect on what raves I might go to.  The conventional
wisdom around these parts is that the bigger and fancier the
flyer, the worse the rave is likely to be.  So spread that
meme around, and eventually maybe Cool World and Toon Town
will be competing to do the smallest, cheapest looking
flyers possible.  Screen printing on recycled toliet paper
would be the ultimate.  Or almost as useful, how about on
the side of a folded biodegradeable garbage bag?  (Hey
Jessica.  Got "filter" working for you?). 

About the Vision comments... contempt seems to be running
awfully high for those Shirtless Guys.  Are you sure this
isn't just a case of "How dare you not dress the way I do"?
(Not to mention "Raves are for everyone... except THEM.")

And I strongly support the idea for more politically active
raving.  It's time we all put more work into defending the
right to assemble... (I think it about a year ago I was
suggesting doing a protest rave in the Civic Center).  For
various reasons, I haven't had a lot of time for rave
activity lately, but I'd do my best to join in on a project
like that.  Maybe I can find time to right up some opinion
pieces and submit them someplace above ground ("The right to
free poetry readings has been upheld, why is free dancing
still in limbo?").

And isn't interesting that the idea we were talking about,
holding a rave using music broadcast to boom boxes, seems to
be catching on?  The KZSU folks made a half-hearted attempt
to do it with limited results (first nano-rave I've ever
been to: five people hanging out in the Baylands park in
Palo Alto, listening on *my* box, which is hardly state of
the art), and this sunday's Golden Gate Park rave was
evidentally supposed to work that way, they just never got
the transmitter part of the idea in effect.

Subject: GG PARK RAVE / THE REAL STORY / PEACE

THE GOLDEN GATE PARK STORY (OK, Time to end the speculation, here's
the facts from the source) ****************************************
During the GG PARK RAVES last summer, we used to apply for a picnic 
permit ($125) from the Golden Gate Park Commission and in-turn we
applied for an amplified sound permit from The SF Police Dept (two
completely different agencies who do not cooperate). The sound
permit only costs $30 per event.  So basically, for under $200 we
could have a legal, fun time.  However, at other time, promoters 
and ravers would come down to the park WITHOUT permits and set up
as if it was a legal event.  Finally, the GG Park Rangers got fed
up with our unanticipated non-permitted events.  So, we made certain
to reserve the park WITH permits, to avoid problems.  After we
kicked off the first GG PARK RAVE this year, the Golden Gate Park
Commission saw hundreds of people dancing and ruled that we can
not use our PICNIC permits to conduct a dance event.  They consider
our Sunday event, A CONCERT!  Can you believe that?  And want us to
secure live performance (DJs) concert permits for $750 each Sunday
as well as leave a $500 security deposit, supply three porta-potties
and purchase an insurance liability policy to hold the city harmless
in the event of an accident (can you have an accident dancing?).
So, the bottom line is that we are appealing to the City's Board
(bored?) of Supervisors next Wednesday.  We have a presentation
including park video footage and letters of support from several
community leaders.  Last week, we were planning to stage a formal
protest rave in the park using FM radios (boombox types) to 
receive the live DJ spinning music over the radio station.  
As soon as we set up (12:30), the Deputy Commissioner insisted
that we would be breaking some FCC rule and that gathering so
many people at one location would be inciting a crowd to riot.
Anyhow, that leaves us with a few options; A. Move the party
(which I don't want to do) / B. Get Rave promoters to pitch in
so that we can raise the $3,000 per month for permits and get
portable toilet facilities (which I don't want to do either, 
since it would be giving in to ridiculous demands that no
one else needs to abide by) / C. Make a strong case and appeal
to the Board of Supervisors, get media attention, and demand
that no-one have access to the park unless they also pay $750
per group (I'm sure the boy scouts, schools, and tourists
would love that; NOT!).  I think we'll win this one (so says
my attorney) by next Wednesday.  In the meantime, we do have
a GG PARK party planned in association with Cal NORMAL and the
Bicycle Day Celebration (The 50th anniversary of LSD's discovery

I'm sorry, but I don't think I.D.ing is EVER a 'great idea'.  Discriminating
against a certain age group to avoid "liability" and to keep out a certain
subgroup of the people under 18, to me, is not so cool.  Remember, not
everyone under 18 is a 'teeny bopper'.   I thought this scene was about
unity, not discrimination.  Am I wrong?

on a more serious note - seth, you are not wrong.  being a youngin, a mere

18 until june which kinda sucks in a big way.  it limits me more than you

will admit that there is a certain age group with which I am most

is a rave type situation? =).  but that does not mean that I am not 
compatible with people outside this group.  I say that if you've got the
vibe and if you've got the energy, who cares how young or old you are?
I can think of plenty of people over 18/21 who I would trade in for huge
groups of teeny boppers at raves for.  it's not the age, it's what you
do and how you do it.  (no comments, please =)  I have high school raver

make a difference.  we're all guilty of discrimination... at least I know

 Sure , I can believe it. What's the GGPC's definition of "picnic"
 versus "concert" ? Also - would the crowd be there if no music was 
 being provided ? Do most picnics involve lawn-thrashing dancing?

 DJs ARE live performers. Just try to hold a rave and simply segue the
 records, one after the other. Or , just play the VISION tapes. :-)

 As for liability, let me imagine some worst cases -

 1. Somebody trips ( no pun intended ) and falls against the amp or
    generator.
 2. Heat exhaustion/heat stroke.
 3. Somebody goes into the bushes to pee because the bathrooms are so
    far away from Marx Meadow , and has an accident or is mugged.
 4. Neighbors of the park , who've had many peaceful and quiet sundays
    for years , complain about the #$%@! noise ( at the distance the
    nearest apts are at, only the bass gets through the windows - real
    annoying ).
 
 GGPC are probably also wary of getting hit via "deep pockets" - somebody 
 sues them for something the rave promoter is responsible for , because 
 the GGPC/city has more money than the rave promoter.

 A riot - sheesh !
 ( Was the DJ going to be on a feed to a regular FM station,

Subject: Free poetry frees free raves ?


A request for confirmation/information:

 I've only heard bits and pieces about the recent attempts by the city's 
cafes and poets to overturn the old law that requires the cafes to buy an
expensive permit to hold open-mike poetry readings. Isn't there an upcoming
public hearing and board meeting about this? 

 The reason I'm asking is , that I heard something from a KQED-FM reporter
that this law affects other free events too! It was reported that musicians
and other performing artists would also be attending/testifying at this
public hearing.

 Doesn't this have a clear relation to the holding of benefit/donations
requested raves like the Connection 2 ?

			A non-SF resident wants to know!

(by "next Wednesday", you mean the 7th, this week, right?)

Brilliant!!!!!  Well, we have our work cut out for us now.  First of
all, we need to show up in force at the meeting on Wednesday and
support Shaun's presentation -- there will probably be an opportunity
for public input, but just being there and clapping at key moments might
be all that's needed.

More importantly, we need to call various Supervisors today and tomorrow
and make our opinions known ahead of time.  Here are some phone numbers
of Supes who were in office last year (I don't have info on the ones
who were elected last November) roughly in order of predicted sympathy
to our position:

        Terence Hallinan    554-7766
        Roberta Achtenberg  554-5556

(she was appointed to the Clinton administration, but I *think* she's
still on the board pending her replacement...)

        Carole Midgen       554-4033
        Kevin Shelley       554-4005
        Angela Alioto       554-7788

(note:  Alioto is President of the Board, the aunt of a raver/promoter, and
stands to be mayor if Jordan is recalled -- make of that what you will!)

Probably less sympathetic but still worth pressuring are:

        Willie Kennedy      554-5734
        Bill Maher          554-5401 (ex-boyfriend of ex-Police spokewoman  =)
        Tom Hsieh           554-5015
        Annemarie Conroy    554-7751
        Barbara Kaufman     554-???? (newly elected)

and there's another new one who's name I don't recall.

When you call them, try to be calm, polite, and friendly, but firm in your
conviction that the park is a legitimate place for music and celebration.
If you're an SF resident, and especially a voter, make sure to let them know!

Here's our opportunity to get things rolling in our direction!

Subject: Proposed Flyer

Here's a draft of the flyer I want to distribute Tuesday.  Please
tell me if there's any wording you think should be improved ASAP.
I want to get these in the shops this afternoon.  Of course, I'll
fill in the missing information by then  ;^)

I know the second-to-last paragraph will trigger some reaction, but,
go ahead, reason with me!



              SUPPORT FREE AND LEGAL DANCING IN THE PARK

    Many of us in the House Scene have enjoyed the Sunday afternoon
gatherings in Golden Gate Park over the last year.  Together with the
Full Moon celebrations, the park has provided us a location to meet in
a natural setting, express our affirmation of life, and spread our positive
energy and love to the world at large, in ways that aren't possible in
a dark club or warehouse.  Just as importantly, they allow those of us
who may be below a certain age, or who can't afford ever-increasing
cover charges, perhaps their only chance to participate in this spiritually
uplifting movement.

    Unfortunately, park officials have recently decided that the type of
permits that had been acceptable for these Sunday events until now, are no
longer adequate.  They are instead demanding a new type of permit which
costs six times that of the old permit, on the basis that these
gatherings are "live performances", comparable to rock concerts.  They
are also insisting on other conditions that, in effect, make it impossible
to continue to put on these events for free.

    There is a chance that we can soon resume these celebrations though,
but WE NEED YOUR HELP.  This Wednesday, April 7th, at X:00 pm there will
be a meeting of the SF Board of Supervisors during which the organizers
plan to appeal this sudden change in bureaucratic temperament.  If
enough people call the members of the board and express their opinion on
the importance of these gatherings, and show up at the board meeting to
support the appeal, we might well be able to reverse the ruling of the
park officials.

    There is every reason to believe your support might make the
difference.  In the past few months, in a fit of permit-mania, the
police department clamped down on (of all things) open poetry readings
in coffee houses around the city, insisting that such activity require
an expensive cabaret license outside the financial reach of all but one
such establishment.  Thanks to swift action on the part of members of
the poetry community, enough pressure was placed on city politicians to
force them to stop enforcing this absurd regulation.  If they could do
it, so can we!

    Please, tomorrow morning, take a few minutes to phone the following
Supervisors and let them know what these events in the park mean to you:

    Angela Alioto       554-7788    <-- President of the Board

    Terence Hallinan    554-7766        Willie Kennedy      554-5734
    Roberta Achtenberg  554-5556        Bill Maher          554-5401
    Carole Midgen       554-4033        Tom Hsieh           554-5015
    Kevin Shelley       554-4005        Annemarie Conroy    554-7751
    Barbara Kaufman     554-????        ???????????????     554-????

    You don't have to be a resident of San Francisco or a voter to call,
but if you are, make sure and let them know!  Whatever you say to them,
keep it positive and let them know how peaceful we are.

    Also, see if you can use words other than "rave" to describe what we're
doing, as the media has done its best to sensationalize that word and imbue
it with negative connotations.

    Finally, please come to the Board of Supervisors meeting Wednesday
evening and lend your support and positive energy!


                 DANCING TO HOUSE MUSIC IS NOT A CRIME!!!

Two things, first I called antenna theater who put on the FM broadcast
performances last year at the beach and THEY DIDN'T NEED A PERMIT,
which is what they told me.  I also phoned the FCC and asked them about
the rules and regulations governing these stereo FM transmitter "Kits".
I told him that ms son :) wanted to have a bar-b-q in the back yard
and use one of those things to pretend to be a DJ.  He said that as long
as the kit was built within the guidelines of legal lowpower operation
and had an appropriate antenna length that it was OK and he did'nt need a
license or permit, although he could not interfer on frequencies where there
was an existing station or cause interference with the enjoyment of other
broadcast in the area.  He wasn't very co-operative but did say that I should
look up some FCC statute, clause 15.

Second, the incite to riot bullshit is the stuff they always hit people
with when they want them to disperse.  They find the head and try to cut it off.
I usually coulter with the fact that we are an extremely peaceful bunch of
people who have NEVER had a history of violence, which we are opposed to.
We only want to dance, we are conducting ourselves in a peaceful and responsible
manner.  We respect what they (the authorities) are trying to do but isn't
there some way that we can continue dancing and they can get their job done
at the same time?  We may have to make a compromise like renting porta potties
(which isn't a bad idea) or getting an insurance policy (which isn't a bad
idea either) in exchange for the City not charging us a huge fee and hassling
us.  The key here is that we are are RESPONSIBLE and AWARE constituancy.  We
don't want to make a mess and have the city foot the bill.  If we want to be
treated with some respect, we have to start acting like a responsible group.
If the Boy Scouts use the park , the city knows they will leave the place
cleaner then they found it.  Maybe we should offer to clean the place at
the end,  this offer has ALWAYS beeen a pleaser with police et. al. from
russian river to bonny dune.  It shows that we are functioning as an
echologicaly aware and mature group, not like a bunch of kids who make
a mess and leave it for mom (or dad) to clean up.


	If you don't want external authorities breathing down your neck
	you gotta develop some personal and individual responsibility.

sorry I missed the bbday party..I honestly was as in the dark about

it got lost...actually I know that was what happened...ergh urgh.

Anyway, caught up to Vision at 10:30 or so, determined (dammit) to 
take advantage of "in by 11=$10" offers...so such luck..$20, a portion
a friend assured me, for Malachy...OOOkay...no problem.
got in...
personally I love the space.  love love love....sitting back, chilling
out, looking at our brothers and sisters having such a good time kciks
me in the pants...awesome.

The music was insane.  I am on a real Josh kick (listen to Progress) and
a Tony splurge (I love side 2 of his vision set) and those guys worked me.
I was able to peer at Spun who went OFF, but I didn't geta lot of chances
to squeeze into the packed DJ area (except when Josh's music drew me to the
table..I sweartogod that happened..very cool) but they had 3 turntables,
Spun used it once to let Timothy Leary talk about his hallucinations...a
weary cheer arose from the early birdies...then after a bit, the palce got
packed and it was great...I was very happy and was having a fantastic,
incredible time...the definition of the rave being the ultimate subjective
experience was the flow for me...it was like an older basics, I just ran around
and everyone was so COOL...a little too crowded once or trwice, but there were
plenty of places to escape to...I stayed on the floor for the most part...took
a nasty spill on that rubber mat--at a certain angle, depending on how
you dance, your feet just get that groove and keep goooing! wham!  I
trust no one laughed...but I think I would have...

anyway, best parts:?  I liked making the first circle of poeple holding
hands and repeating it with Martin and crew the second time during the
increible "dream" (which is on this Acid attack tape by Para whcih is 
ripping it UP right now) song...fantastic.  Then Garth played the dream
speech and we were all there, together, listening, praying...then
CHEERS!!! awesome awesome...
I also liked Martin telling us to hold hands and share energy for Malachy..
the community is there....it's still there despite the commercialization
of it all...

SOOO....incredible time....Jeno was great (as soon as you get into another
DJ, Jeno spins something so out of control you feel bad for some reason
ever doubitng his skills!)...it ended too early for my friends and I...
sure it was seven, but it WAS daylight savings...so we sat in the lobby
until 8, went to the party---Tilt-a-Whirl....it is always worth the moeny
to see Carlos get into it and do a little scratching..he's the coolest..
La Paix's set was a bit chunkier and discordant for the morning..but then
I just like easier trancier stuff in the morning..what do I know?  but
dutch ( a personal favorite) rescued me (again, it would seem) and worked
it great...we left before Jeno was supposed to show up, dropped a tired 
pal off and got some sandwiches and chilled until 5 at the park...great
day..beautiful.

but what is it with the park?  there was a noticeable lack of speakers,
turntables and dj's there...I heard lotsa rumors, but what is really going
on?
(side note0--great to see this yuppie group doing their corporate picnic
complete with croquet, volleyball, and football, and keg in the middle of
about 200 ravers sitting on, giggling slightly here and there.../:)

anyway, thanks for reading this obnoxious post, you get a prize, and I hope
to see you all soon...good to see ravi and brian and others at vision.

WHAT A GREAT WEEKEND!!! YOU CANNOT STOP THIS CROWD!!!!

(oft spoken at park...you cannot stop it--they made one girl tiurn off her
gloriously loud car stereo (they=cops) but without missing a single beat,
someone pumped up their boombox....!!)

Well, I've just called the main office of the Board of Supervisors.
there's no general meeting Wednesday evening, their regular meetings
are scheduled on Monday evenings.  There are two committee meetings
that night (Budget and something else) but neither of those meetings
have this issue on the agenda.  So....

I'm presently trying to contact Shaun and a few other people behind
this park thing and try to get the REAL story (behind the REAL story
we got last night  ;^).  I'll also call Alioto's and Hallinan's
office just to break the ice about the issue.

Stay tooned,

Sounds like a good possible fall-back compromise, if not an initial
bargaining position!  Maybe a solution to the insurance thing would be
an agreement waiving the city's liability -- does someone still have that
article about the state court decision holding landowners immune from
liability claims resulting from recreational uses of their land?

This was done repeatedly last year, and we should emphasize that along with

One more issue that may be interesting to everyone in the hope that we may come
up with a solution is the effect dancing in Marx Meadow has on the the grass.
Last year when the park events were going on every week the grass all but
disappeared in some parts of the meadow. Moving the location of the dancefloor
doesn't really alieviate the problem/challenge and at present an addition to
that challenge is the fact that the meadow gets water logged. One solution may 
be to provide a lot of cardboard boxes and make the dancefloor from them. That
may not be the ideal solution while the area is still wet but may be a simple
and cheap solution in the future. 

Any body got any ideas?

Hmmm.  My last message to sfraves.stanford.edu hasn't gone through so
I'll try sending this update through soda:

I just had a long talk with Shaun -- there was a misunderstanding about
the meeting on Wednesday; it's not with the Board of Supervisors, but rather
with some Deputy Park Commissioner, who may be able to clear up the problem
without any need for public intervention.  There's no B of S (BS?) meeting
until this coming Monday, anyway.  I promised we would hold off on lobbying
the Supervisors until we see what happens on Wednesday.

Darn... I stayed up all night writing that agitprop for nothing!  =)  =)

Hi all -

Now I'm not volunteering or anything, but . . . in following this thread
about the best way to fight city hall/policemen/money hungry permit mongers
I had an idea.  Might there be certain liberal reporters or alternative
newspapers who might be willing to do a story on all this?  Perhaps the
best approach would not be a "ravers just want peace love and understand-
ing" tack (although that's obviously an implicit subtext), but rather to
expose the scum who are giving such peaceful folks a hard time -- FOR NO
REAL REASON ("real" read as, reason they'd be willing to share with us).
I think reporters are more into uncovering dirt than promoting good vibes.
Such is life.  

Anywya, maybe someone already suggested this & I haven't been paying attention.
It just seems kind of logical.  I'm not hip on all the alternative (used
loosely) press stuff, but even the Guardian, Metro, SF Weekly.  Maybe some-
body has a friend who knows someone who knows something.  One time some
friends and I were really pissed about something (that I needn't bore you w/)
and we wrote to Herb Caen.  Our  compalint actually got published in his
column & it brought a smirk of satisfaction to all of us.

Good luck on Wednesday (or was it MOnday?)

Are you sure it wouldn't?  It would seem to me that using a plot of land once
every three weeks would do far less ecological harm than once every week.  
even something intelligent like putting the speakers 30 yards away could do
a lot, as the most damage gets done right in the center....

BTW, howbout having some at Berkeley Marina?  There was one there last
Saturday from what I understand...  nothing big, but they did have a sound
system and generator.  Maybe have Saturday events there, and Sunday in
the park?  There's more than just that one cove we could set
up at the Marina, too....

several people noted in their weekend reviews that they were surprised or  
shocked at the $20 price tag.  (of course, after getting psyched, driving  
there, parking, etc., they coughed up the bucks anyway, even if they had to  
borrow funds.)

no surprise here - i've noticed a trend:  the more secret the price, the  
higher it probably is.  the publicity for VISION - direct mail, info line -  
univerally failed to mention how much it would cost.  this [common] practice  
seems vaguely exploitative to me.  i feel much better about events when the  
promoter clearly identifies up front what the price will be, and if it's a  
benefit, how much goes to the cause.

if you agree, might i suggest leaving a message in the voicemailbox of info  
lines that don't cite a price, e.g. "sounds great, please tell us what it'll  
cost, i won't go unless i know in advance.  thanks."  *and then make good on  
your word.*

I like the proposed flyer.  Hopefully we won't have to use it but if we do I
don't think it needs any changes.  It's clear and well-put.  Also, I agree
that the word "rave" has been heavily sensationalized.  I prefer "house"
because it's a great image, everyone in one house [like the ComeUnity logo]
and it refers to the music, which is not only important, but also at least
the concept of music is a familiar one to people [even if they don't like
it, most people recognise that there are different types of music, enjoyed
by different people.]  The word "rave" on the other hand refers to the just
as important but much harder to explain aspects of trance, change of
consciousness, all that ineffable stuff that we can barely talk about
amongst ourselves, much less explain to people who at best don't understand
and at worst are hostile to it before they even know what it is [whether due
to media sensationalism or simple fear of the unknown.]

thoughts?

see you in the future... peace!

   I agree with you Laura. Here in Seattle the scene is plagued by unwarranted

for promoters here to put on an event. We must plea bargain with city officials
to obtain these permits. Our big "scene paper" The Rocket has a cover story
about the problems the cops and fire dept. are causing the scene. The paper
should have used it's power to *our* advantage, rather the article, IMHO 
just added fuel to the fire. The article accomplished to garner more negative
publicity/vibe. Thanks Rocket! The feature did chronicle nearly every event
held over the last 18 months and annotated every police/city/fire dept.
complaint. If there is interest, I'll make it available @soda.

I spent friday evening ride seeking to brian's birthday.  I finally decided the
easiest way for me to get there would be to ditch work (oopsie!) and take my
friends up on their offer to drop me off in berkelely the next afternoon. so, 
that's exactly what i did.  saturday, i met up with mykl and leah in berkeley
and skipped off to charter oak.  it was a bit hectic watching everyone else stre
ss out ;) gettin a sound system together but finally we ended up with all the
right pieces.  people started showin up, the place was lookin cleaner than it
had ever been, mykl's kidnap plan for brian was in effect.  then, SURPRISE! 
well, sorta but it was a lot of fun anyhow! :)  the djin downstairs by lee,
jon, and oopsIdidn'tcatchyourname was pretty darn good!  i was dancin like
crazy and feeling so tranced out for some parts of their sets.  thanks!  every
now and then i took a rest and went up to chat more with people [hi again to all
the new faces i met and EVERYONE!] and eat (cool cake!).  At about midnight 
it was time to head out.  I went to vision in richmond with brian.  i had never
been to that space before and was AMAZED at how HUGE that place was and how many
zillions of people were there!  I don't think I got over the shock for like 1/2
hour.  Anyhow, despite my reservations with there being such a huge crowd, it w 
was awesome!  The people were great, everyone just gruuven along.  The music
always had this underlying tranceyness in the backgraound which blows my mind!
I was dancin like crazy again but wandered between dance areas.  The music in
the bermuda room WAS pretty damn good but I couldn't dance for very long in that
humidity without havin to leave.  The trance/chill room, I thought was AMAZING!
There were not many people dancing but I could NOT resist.  The music just took
me.  I was so happy in my own little world dancin away.  The visuals in the main
room were INTENSE too.  I was staring at them for a long time.  I was totally
sober that night but the music, vibe, and everything just intoxicated me!  I was
soooo happy.  Sfravers mike w, ravi, and larry were all spied havin a great
time!  At 6 (NOT! late for work) we headed out.  I kinda felt bad cuz the place
was still goin strong but I had to leave to get home for work.  The cooolest
thing that happened was Larry offered to drive me back to santa cruz!!!! yeehaw!
not a greyhound in sight! thanks x infinity! :)  I still can't believe I survivd
that day at work!  Yesterday I found out there was the full moon rave AND that
it was in bonny doon no less!  my friends andd i arrived at like 1:30.  lots
of people were  there by then gathered around a huge fire.  drums goin, boombox..
everyone was cheery and chatty.the sound probably got there 3ish I wasn't lookin
at my watch :).  anyhow, this was the only the second fmr i've made it to and i
must say that this was EXCELLENT!!!  I have been been in various stages of ill-
ness for let's say 2 MONTHS which totally saps my energy and causes me to have
to actually STOP dancing sometimes (what?!) BUT yesterday I was back in full
force!!!  I could not believe my energy level!  I missed it sooo much!  I danced
98% of the time I was there and finally decided to hitch homewards at 11:30ish.
there were still quite a few people hanging out listenin to the music or dancin
when i left.  i can't believe bonny doon is STILL goin strong!  at one point
there was a cop or sherriff standing behind the dj (I really gotta learn their
names) watchin him mix. weird.  anyhow, i could go on...:) but i'll spare you.
anyhow, i had a WAAAHHHNDERRRFUUUHHHLL weekend and more!  thanks to all! byeee!

It would be nice to be able to piggyback onto the poetry reading issue
that the press & local government are pissing all over themselves about.
Todays Chronical referred to free musical events along with poetry readings
as part of the permit debate, and how some of those concerned  want to relax 
permit requirements for poetry readings only.  Meanwhile Alioto and Jordan are 
publicly exchanging verses with each other like this is some kind of big joke.
If we don't speak up now, there's a good chance we'll be left out in the
cold.  

Hey, how about a petition drive, not for the GG Park in particular, but
for the general freedom to have free public musical events in general?
I lot of ravers may be too shy to call City Hall, but I bet we could gather
a shitload of signatures.

It would be great if we had more sympathy in the press.  Somehow, I don't

get him to experience it first hand.  Onward...

One solution may

Any body got any ideas?

A good way to show the city we're a community and responsible and maybe

I can't remember if this was brought up, so here goes.  I don't know
how much the Examiner or Chronicle charges for full-page ads, but
do you think we could get the attention necessary if we were to 
write a small article describing who we are, what we do, what we
stand for, and also describe our plight with the city and see what
kind of response we can get from that?

Who knows, maybe someone could come forward to offer a solution.

Jus' a thought...

Subject: we were hot "together" last night

Last night - Big Heart City basement.  Wow!  what an incredible 
night!  This was my first time at this location and for this 
party.  Got there around 12:30 to catch the last half hour of Evil 
Eddie (I think that's who he was).

At first I thought to myself, "what am I doing here when I have to 
work tomorrow".  I walked in and the first thing I noticed was 
that the sound system sounded awful; it seemed as if a speaker was 
blown (that's as technical as I can get with that description).  
There weren't too many people on the floor dancing.  I was getting 
worried, so I cruised to the chill area and had a beer, convincing 
myself that I was already there, therefore have fun anyways.

Came back to the floor, watched the dj do his magic, meanwhile 
observed more people coming in and also noticed that the sound 
system was now in good shape (another technical term).  Around 1am 
Simon came on and was he ever more god-like than he was last 
night!  It was an incredible experience as he drove the groove 
right through my skull, into my limbs, and out my skin for over 
two and a half hours, until I had to go home to catch some Zzz's.  
I don't think I've ever sweated as much as I did last night.  My 
shirt was not only soaked, but drenched (sweat dripping from the 
shirt).  I suppose ventilation could have been improved, but with 
the number of people there, that would have been a serious 
undertaking.

The people there were great!  The vibe was definitely alive and 
well.  Everyone was friendly, happy, and had left their attitudes 
at home.  Thanks y'all.

Anyways, that was my night in review...

Hey,

I just found out that live 105 pays $5000 for the permits/etc. from
police/GGPark officials.  sound, etc. is ON TOP of that.  so it looks
like the city wants only "Rich Rock & Rollers"(TM) to do music in the park.
still i wouldn't give up, the rules are often different for crop vs. non-corp

	There is something else you should consider and that is torgue. When I
bought my JVC turntable years ago pitch control and direct drive were all I
thousgt I needed. To bad the JVC just does not have enough torque to alow
easy mixing. Any scrathing, backing up the record or just pinching the spindle
will slow it down to much and it takes to long to speed up again. I have found
that many Technics turntables have ample torque. Even their consumer models.
So try to get a Technics if you can.

Subject: full moon

so i went to the full moon rave at bonny doon on tuesday morning.  a
pretty good-sized crowd was in full effect when i got there.  the
sound system was incredibly good sounding - one of the cleanest,
nicest systems i've ever heard, in fact.  didn't seem to be much of a
vibe though.  no hostility, but not much positivity either - just a
bunch of people doing drugs and dancing.  a true "rave", to me,
consists of a bunch of people doing drugs and dancing, but with a sort
of mystical psychic connection added on top.  you just feel it.  maybe
my vibe receptor was in need of its 30000 mile tuneup on tuesday, but
i just didn't feel much of anything.

i heard all of jeno's set and it was fine, although by no means
overwhelming.

garth was all over the place, trying out tweaky acid stuff, funky
stuff, diva stuff and housy stuff.  consequently, my enjoyment level
fluctuated wildly.  i am almost embarrased to admit that the two songs
he played that really blew me away were moby's "next is the e" (i'd
never heard THAT mix before... WOW!) and madonna's "deeper and
deeper."  well, at least i won't have a hard time finding the 12"s for
either of those...

songs that are beginning to really irk me: "we are phuture" and "show
me love."  *especially* the latter.  KMEL-style diva disco at its
worst.

Aha!  But "he who ignores the past is doomed to repeat it", or something like
that...  there are just too many similarities between the two subcultures
to act like the 60's are totally irrelevant.  Ravestock is a gross example
of this concept gone awry, The Cyborganic Be-in was just slightly over the
bounds (but I think 95% of the people younger than 35 who were there had no
clue as to the allusion), and as forr "death of the Raver", there's a Monty
Python sample which would fit perfectly here.

I agree, Pete, we shouldn't be duplicating the past (especially since hippie
culture's heydey ended with such adverse public reaction) but let's learn 
from it when we do what we do.  Especially now as it looks like we're gonna
have to start dealing with certain People in Charge.

Hi gang,

Just a quick public announcement to let you know that there are now two
more options (other than BPM) for house music. Primal Records, at 2556
Telegraph (510-548-8511) has been open for about a month now and stocks
the latest from the UK and beyond. If you're sick of the attitude and
hassle of BPM, this place is for you. The people who run it are very
friendly and have their act together. If there's anything that you want,
they'll try their best to get it for you--and believe me, if they can't
get it, good luck finding it anywhere else... 

The other store is, believe it or not, Rasputins (located on the corner of
Durant and Telegraph). My roommate was just given the position as the
dance music buyer recently and has been trying very hard to bring new
music into the area. I think he has been largely successful. If you liked
the tunes that were played at C2 (by any of the djs), you can find most of
them at Rasputins. Prices, in general, are around $8.99 to $9.99 (which is
about a buck cheaper than anywhere else). The only disadvantage here is
that you have to know what you are looking for; they don't have turntables
for you to demo the records... BTW, they also do special orders, although
it's something of a pain in the ass. You have to ask for Brian because no one
else there will know what to do.

Hope this info is useful to someone...

I talked to a few people, who gave me more people to talk to and I'm
still working on that part. I did speak with someone who has strange ties
to the Chronicle OP-ED page (on the editorial board, or somehow associated
with it) and he said that a well-written letter expressing our point of 
view and defining the issues as we see them could be a really good fit
for the op-ed page. I know it's not much, but it's a beginning, and it's
way cheaper than a full-page ad. Also, it's possible that it could be
written by many people and fashioned into a coherent statement, signed
by "all" to protect those who wish not to be named. Did I mention this person
would give the letter a special push?

It's just a suggestion. And, I really have been reading postings, but
if someone could e-mail me personally a description of a few instances
of permit-mongering by the SFPD that ruined the day or seemed excessively
burdensome, I'd like to hear about it. *Briefly* The GG Park thing was a
good focus, but now happily that seems to be less of a problem. Does this
mean that we will no longer be petitioning the board with flair?

I think both of you are right, but instead of coming up with something
"original," something "different" might spark some new ideas.  Instead of
going to events at night, and in "secret" places, maybe someone should take the
initiative, have an event during the day and very public.  I don't have any idea what legal problems we would encounter and what permit requirements
need to be met, but maybe something at the polo fields, chrissie fields,
justin herman plaza...etc.  Some public outdoor place, that starts at noon,
and goes till 7 or 8.  Would be fun, and might show others what rave culture is

all about.   Maybe even something like the Black and White ball.. at night,
but in the streets... all night.  Either of these would take massive planning,
and would probably need to be headed by committee.  The chances of this
becoming a huge production are high, and the commercial aspect is certainly
there, but it would be different..... my two cents...

*Warning: soapbox mounted*

Before we start get to get loud and public about police persecution, we 
might want to think about this a little more.  The SFPD has been busting 
"illegal" parties long before they were called raves.  In fact the SFPD 
have been busting up peaceful gatherings of various  kinds (political, 
social, artistic), not to mention the on again/off again harassment of 
street vendors and musicians, often using permit laws as an excuse.  I'm 
not completely convinced that raving has been especially singled out by 
the established order for special treatment in this regard.  The problem
may be a lot larger than us and it might be better to address it as such. 

If we have been singled out, then we better understand why so that we
don't accidentally reinforce their reasons for singling us out.
If we are being percieved as some kind of spoiled adolescent anarchist
movement, then I'm not sure that demanding the right to party and blast
giant stereos whenever and wherever we please will win us much sympathy.

There has been some discussion on this list about whether media coverage
of any kind on what we are doing is desireable at all.  There's a lot to 
be said for peaceful coexistence within the nooks and cracks of society, 
as opposed to right in its face.

I still think that with some cooperation between ravers, promoters, club 
owners, local gov't & the community, everyone stands to benefit from the 
rave scene/community/movement/whatever.  There's been a lot of friction 
and cooperation between these groups, but so far it's still happenning.
Things will continue to evolve and there will always be limits to test.  
Along the way there will be many directions to explore. 

Before we stand up to demand our rights, we should have a sense of who 
"we" are and what it is that we are trying to be.  Or in the TAZ tradition, 
we can shun definition and restrictions and continue trying to dodge those
that are thrown at us by others.  Sometimes it can be more fun *not* to 
have a leg to stand on.

i think it has *much* to do with the perception of raves being associated
with psychedelic drugs.  A while back their was an episode of 48 hours
that it mentioned there was a special DEA  task force with the expressed
intention of busting the "new psychedelic scene" in San Francisco.  They
did as much as they could to make LSD look as scary as possible, spread
much disinformation about it, and mentioned that LSD, X,  and raves were
all "targeted" for investigation. I believe you will have much trouble
getting anyone to cop to this from an official the of view, but in my
opinion, this has everything to do with the current situation.  The
authorities are scared to death of psychedics, as I believe they fear
the social ramifications of a new psychedelic resurgence.  To get a little
snide and somewhat corny, I think they (the authorities and the status

I agree, black kids on crack shooting up eachother is not a problem for
the authorities.  They keep it contained in the ghetto and that's that.
In fact crack addicts are too busy trying to line up the next rock to worry
about the "Man".  When white kids take psychedelics and realize that they
can make that tree overthere disappear and reappear and notice how assinine
and irrelevent the stuff on TV is (except for Ren & Stimpy :) especially
the 6 o'clock news and propaganda like 48 hours.  This worries the authorities.
They know that these kids have to take over for them when they die and guess
what?  If too many of them trip then they might not want to keep the status 
quo in place, this scares the shit out of them although they don't know why.
Oddly enough though, virtual reality will go a long way towards turning this
mode of thought around.  I think that the "War on Drugs" is really the name
for "containment" of the kids in the ghetto who are using and selling crack.
It only became a problem when white kids started going into these places to
buy it. 

What needs to happen is to focus on a person's right to think and to have
any altered state of consciousness that they so choose so long as the do
it responsibly and it doesn't impinge on anyother persons right.
Weather I want to meditate or have estactic sex, or drop acid or MDMA or
even crack should be my bussiness and no one elses unless I'm creating
a proble for the people around me.

Subject: Rave Funeral Reconsidered


  On reflection, I think that the rave-funeral idea needs rethinking. 
What I had in mind wasn't a "death of hippie" media event, but a New
Orleans-style jazz funeral.  But the more I thought about it, the more
inappropriate the application seemed to me.  For many years in a part of the
New Orleans
culture, a person's death was mourned with a public street ceremony
accompanied by
jazz musicians.  The procession moved solemnly down the street, friends
of the deceased crying and consoling each other. Then, at a critical
juncture, the music turned happy
and the mourners danced. Life wins out over death, the spirit lives...
 To apply that idea to a rave event now seems inappropriate, and even
disrespectful to the culture that gave birth to the jazz funeral. However, as
Brian and Mark pointed out, there are
some open, public celebrations that could be good for the movement and a
memorable good time.  The Summer of Love in 1967 (Jesus -- was it over a
quarter of a century ago?!  Sigh.....) was just such an event. It was
done without commercialism, and proved that the psychedelic culture was a
real entity, with some shared beliefs and positive values. Most important,
it proved to the people in that culture, scattered around the country (and
world), that there was indeed a culture, and not just isolated
collections of freaks.
  Can ravers do the same thing -- not imitate the hippies, but create a major
event that proclaims and practices the communal values that so many ravers
say they believe in?

perhapse this is something that should be brought up at the next promoters

Mykl,
	Have you forgotton?

	Well in 63 Kennedy was shot, (I was 6 years old but remeber it
	well, that was the turning point and the country got weird) but
	when Johnson took over, we had the Great Society, yes there was
	the War but there was also Bobby Kennedy (shot)  Martin Luther
	King (shot) Malcom X (shot).  But things got BETTER, the war
	ended, my particular group of folks (African Americans) could
	at least get a halfway decent education (Nixon did not reverse
	major civil rights bills) and I am most definitely a product of
	post-60s great society, america.  When I was in 4th grade, I
	had a college reading level so I at least was noticed and given
	good teachers and encouragement and text books and got to go to
	an engineering highschool that had computers and vacume
	chambers and wind tunnels and stuff, what does even a white kid
	in the public school system have now?  Not much and less each
	year anyway back to the 60's, by the time I turned 18, I still
	had a draft card and lottery number (It was 72 so I WAS GOING
	but my classification was 1H (H for Hold) so the war ended just
	in time.)  The war was the major bad shit around but people
	were getting ready to rip shit up over it so it was stopped.

	In many ways Clinton is trying to pick up where the Kennedy's left
	off, let's hope he doesn't get offed as well.  Not that the Kennedy's
	were angels but they realized that it was easier to go along with
	and co-opt change rather than resist it.  Johnson realized this to,
	Nixon tried to halt it but it got the best of him in the end.
	The only group that was successful in making things bad in a BIG hurry
	was Regan/Bush, we lost the 80s to reactionaries, lets hope we can
	finish the work the 60's started in the 90's.

In one sense I agree, particularly when discussing the 'rave' culture.
It is odd that 'ravers', who rely on the underground/covert to
maintain their culture might want to have anything to do with the mass
media. Now on the other hand, I work at Mother Jones, which has a reputation
for trying to get the truth out from under the mass media. We do a lot of
stuff that other media leave alone, and we have goals and ideals, and we
think (hope) that we're making a difference. There are many magazines, zines
newspapers etc, who, given a connection to the right people, could do a 
favorable story that refutes the *mass* media notion that raves are 'drugs'
first an foremost and forget to mention that it's also about community
and connection and the joy of perpetual motion. Of course, some editors
I've met would say that's a boring story:-( I think not. My too sense.

I think as a purely pragmatic tactic we should support Hallinan's
proposal to open up the cabaret law to allow 14-21 year olds.  When
the measure gets out of committee and is scheduled for debate we should 
mount a phone and letter-writing campaign aimed directly at the Bd. of Supes.
On the other hand...

...given the current climate of opinion that no permits at all should be
required for reading poetry in public, shouldn't our underlying position be
for the abolition of all permit requirements involving dancing to recorded
music (at least in a not-for-profit situation)?  

As to whether we should try getting press coverage, I'm not convinced
one way or the other.  My instincts tell me that "publicity is a bad tactic,
while tact and virtual clandestinity are good tactics", as Bey suggests.
Sometimes political pressure works best behind the scenes.  I'll be more
specific:  if we shine the public spotlight on this proposal, there's
likely to be a backlash from conservatives that wouldn't happen if we keep
quiet.

I really think Shaun has the right idea:  one of his park raves last year
functioned as a voter registration drive.  A few hundred voters were registered,
and he got a letter of recommendation from da Mayor himself.  Don't you
think that letter was a factor in his negotiations yesterday?  No messy
press coverage involved.  Now *that's* strategic thinking!

I know it would be exciting and 60's-like (but aren't we trying to get away
from that?) to have demonstrations on the steps of City Hall, but is it in our
long-term interests?  I think there's an assumption some people have that
if they only knew what we were *really* about, the mainstream would approve
of us.  Is this really the case?  Maybe it is.  Maybe we can play a role
in the tourist industry, the local color angle, like someone suggested.  (yuk)

One final thought -- one way that our situation is the polar opposite
of the late 60's, is that back then the overall political establishment was 
getting worse in a big hurry.  Today it seems to be improving.

The media can also be used to spread the word, and turn more people on
to the good vibes created by 'ravers.' But it takes a sympathetic platform
to do it right. And then again, maybe we've moved beyond the days when
the established print (or broadcast) media can do anything of value.
Maybe we've moved into an era where we have to show and not tell. But
you can't get away from the fact that a staged event like a jazz funeral
is likely to get some press. What you do with that press depends on how
willing you are to talk to them and get your point of view across. It's
most certainly a tricky game.

Subject: Mass media exposure - we want it IF.....


	We as a community need to come together and decide - 

	*What* is it that we have a problem with.  

	There are two basic categories I can see answers to this question
come under:

	1) Tangibles.  The Park party permits.  The curfew laws.  The 
possibile existance of the anti-rave task force in the SFPD.  Payola.  
Identifyable objects of dismay.  or

	2) Intangibles.  The thought that raves are a *bad* thing by the
People with Power.  The association of all night parties with hedonistic
drug use.  Being able to tell someone you like dancing to techno without
getting a sneer... abolishment of the raves=danger meme in current society.


	Those problems which fall under 1) are problems which we can do
things about via direct action - Shaun led the way in clearing up the Park
party permits by basically being very smart and diplomatic with the GG Park
authorities.  Solving the other problems would require an equal amount
or more diplomacy, with perhaps a tinge of activism.  Here is where we could
make use of resources like lawyers, the ACLU, the Freedom of Information Act,
petitions, calling government officals, et cetera.  For these problems we need
well-defined goals, or we sound confused, a sign of weakness.  We as a 
community (and not just as a net.community, but as a Bay Area House Nation)
must come to a concensus on these issues.  We need to decide amongst our
ourselves what is reasonabe to ask of current society.... asking that we can
hold full-sized raves in a state park for free in the middle of the night is 
perhaps not realistic; how can a cop be expected to tell if we are a friendly
non-violent crowd or a meeting of the Crips?  Cops have never had a
particularly keen sense of "vibe" ya know ;)  On the other hand, asking that
the owner (of a particular building where a party is being thrown and 
complained about) is given written notice of the complaint and a chance to
turn the sound down is NOT unrealistic.  

	To attack complaints under #1, we need a SPECIFIC list of greivances.
The Park party (and in relation, Giamma's attempted Saturday benefit rave)
was the largest issue in my mind of this nature.  Let's come up with some
more.  We can decide our plan of action AFTER getting this list, and after 
thinking about what overriding goals and concerns are.

	However, I think we face a greater danger from, and should concentrate
at least an equal amount of energy towards the issues latent in #2.  Why the
fuck should we care what others think about our parties, our lifestyle?  
Because we can't escape society.  Yeah, we always have the option of rebelling,
of saying screw you to the status quo and pretending that we don't have to live
by those guidelines - we can cut ourselves off from the rest of society and 
live "underground".  Some of us can find a way to make a living while doing
this, but they are the lucky few.  Most of us (especially those who are 
reading this now on a computer) have jobs, or go to a college, or are self-
employed, or though some other means have a life within society that we don't
want to lose.  Unlike others who mount soapboxes, I'm NOT going to advocate we
escape those bonds which tie us.  I'm suggesting we retie them.  Yes, modern
society is a big sham put on by those with power and money to perpetuate their
power and money, but we are an accomplice to that structure if we refuse to
challenge it.

	By the words "challenge" and "retie bonds" I don't mean radical action,
subterfugal quasi-terrorist secret missions, or renegade parties.  I'm talking
100% about ED-U-CATION.  We need more flyers out there.  We need more 
communication.  The net here is a wonderful place to exchange these ideas and
communicate on a peer-to-peer basis, but we only represent a fraction of the
House Nation out there.  We must communicate to others in the scene and on
the outside what we're about, why "we're all here" - and this isn't a question
with an easy answer either, and certainly not one everyone can agree upon.
Instead of deciding exactly what we want to say, let's think about what we
want the overall effect of our words to be.  

	I want to be able to tell people I go out dancing all night and not
have them instantly assume I'm sort of deviant.

	I want to be able to tell people about getting INSIDE the music, about
trancing out and finding a renewing agent within myself, without them thinking
I was necessarily high to find that or I've joined a cult.

	I want to not have to read about "raves" in the newspaper and hear
only about somone dying from heat exhaustion.

	I want to not hear a cop bust a party because they got complaints 
about noise from a house 4 miles away.

	There are other things I'd like to hear, but I think you get the idea.
Most of all, I'd just like the outside world not to think of us as a 
bogeyman, or scapegoat, or waste of time and energy.  


	But wait!  All this wouldn't seem that hard if we were a united group
of people who transmit a vibe even in our everyday lives.  Unfortunately,
this is not the case.  We can't even hope to have a strong effect on the 
outside if our House is not in order.  

	So what sort of "order" does it need to be in?  And wouldn't
establishing some sort of "order" be exactly contrary to everything the scene
is about, which is being unique and liberated from others' norms and 
expectations?  

	This is the hardest question of all.  This is where we as a Community
need to do some serious soul-searching.  Some of you out there are no doubt
saying, "Oh please, just give it a rest.  I'll pay my $20 every Saturday night
to get my brain scrambled by Jeno, and the rest of the week I'm a normal
human being, pay taxes, everything.  And I see no reason why this'll change
if I do nothing".  Actually I'd be surprised if you read this far and thought
that :)  But those of us who have been to the Full Moons, who have gotten
DEEP inside a house trance, be it by substances or meditation or pure adoration
and enjoyment of the music and the people (the latter option being the 
strongest), those who have felt the rewards of making others happy, be it
through DJ'ing or throwing parties or handing out lollipops to everyone; all
of you know what I mean and WHY I feel as strongly as I do, that this is a
REAL thing, a BELOVED thing, a thing that is in great danger of being lost if
we don't work to keep it.  We know it's NOT all about getting wasted and
taking your shirt off and picking up on chicks on X... it's NOT all about
buying the puffiest hat or the dopest laces.  These are all aspects people
may choose to see in raves, but if this is all they see we are lost.  

	I'm not about to dictate what it IS about, but the overwhelming 
feeling I get at a good party is one of inner peace, of finding myself, 
of realising I don't have to worry how I look when I dance because people
no one else is critical about it either, so I have true freedom to express
myself, and expressing oneself is something that's VERY looked down upon
in modern society.  And you see other people who are happy with this thought
too - and there you are in the middle of 3000 people who are happy and 
dancing because hey realize they can express themselves and dance however
they want to whatever MOVES them, and you realize, if we can be in this
mindset, all 3000 of us, for 6 hours every weekend, why can't we carry some
of that into our real life?  It's these revelations, these tinges of, oh
wow, here are 3000 people who for a breif moment in time have NO conflicts
with each other... "Imagine a world..." indeed.  And it doesn't matter if it's
3000 or 30 - you can get the same feeling at any size.  And is there ANYONE
in the world who you wouldn't want to share in this?  ANYONE?  Forget the
fact that they might not be capable of feeling it the first time they've
gone (though this has almost always happened to newbies I've taken to the
full moons)  Do you feel you can walk away from this with something POSITIVE?
Would the world be a better place if everyone carried this POSITIVE meme
with them?  I say YES.

It's the people who feel this who need to work on the issues presented in #2.  

I'm going to start working on a number of flyers in my spare (ha!) time, this
flyer being the basis for the first one.  I've got ideas for three or four 
more, and they are all messages I want out, not to try and dictate what the
scene is or should be or could be in my wildest dreams (which is effectively
what this post has become) but just progenators of memes I want to start 
circulating.  Above all, I want to get out the message that we are at a
crossroads.  We can't stall or stand still or we will fall behind.


As a final message, I have GREAT HOPES for what has been coming out of the
lead-up to the Malachy benefit on the 17th.  On Monday in a room at the
Sound Factory (which from henceforth I will never call Attitude Factory - 
the management was incredibly supportive) sat 30 people who are normally
at each others throats.  Many people there had long long histories of 
promoter wars with each other.  And over the past few weeks they've been
able to put aside those concerns and concentrate on doing something as a
community.  For three hours they talked about various things, should they
have a second dance floor, should the security be armed, should vendors
be allowed; and EVERYONE, by meeting ground rules, was permitted a chance
to speak.  And when it became obvious at one point that it was going to
be impossible to make everyone happy and satisy everyone completely, 
someone said, "Well, it's not like we have to do everything in this one
party.  There will be more opportunities like this, right?"  Everyone in
the room nodded or grunted in agreement.  AMAZING.  This is a realization
of the many discussions we have had about trying to get together a promoter's
conference/retreat last fall;  what our goal was, a unifying of the scene,
sounds like it's finally coming about.  As long as this doesn't denigrate
into a cartel-like operation, this can only be a Good Thing.

So get crackin' on those flyers!  I know some of you out there have put them
out with success... make sure you are communicating to the right audience, and
you're sure of what you want to say.  Appeal to their hearts AND minds.  Give
them the tools to carry the vibe with them into real life.

Up the Evolution!

Shamanarchy Time is NOW!

	Brian

Subject: This week's rave guide

	Hi all!  Sorry this got out so late, but there was a power
failure in all of Evans, one of the main CS buildings here, and.. let's
just say it's VERY BAD to have a *NIX machine lose power all of the
sudden....

	Anyways, I only know of one thing going on Friday, but I'm
sure the weeklies would be happening too... Instinct has a great lineup
so I'd go for that, but it might be a good week to check out the weeklies...

	Saturday - I'll probably end up going to Vision Quest simply to
quell my Doc fetish, but there's nothing I really have to recommend against
the other parties... 

	Sunday - THE PARK PARTY!!!  :)  GG Park, 25th and Fulton, you can
call the number to get last-minute details on its status.

	Be sure and get lots of rest this weekend for the big Malachy
benefit on the 17th.  This will be an event you WON'T want to miss.

	Also that weekend is the big celebration of the 50th anniversary
of LSD.  If you want info about the events planned and where to call and
such, let me know and I'll forward it to you.

Subject: OK with you folks?


Hello fellow SFRavers!

 CONFRANCISCO , the world science fiction convention , is happening in
San Francisco Sept. 2 to Sept 6 . I expect that , as in most science
fiction conventions , that there will be bulletin boards set up in each of
the buildings that are holding convention events.

 What I would like to do is post up a one-page "flyer" of all the rave
events happening on those dates - a condensed version of the weekly calender
for that week. 

 I got questions:

 1. What's your opinion(s) - good idea / bad idea / don't care?
 2. May I mention "..this list brought to you courtesy of SFRAVES" , with 
    a short explaination of what SFRAVES is? 

 and 3. Anybody going to it too ?

 I think it would be great to find out how many science fiction fen/ravers
there will be at this huge , international convention - maybe some will
have first-hand stories about raves all over the world! Maybe I should put
up a comments sheet as well , next to each posting.

    In the several ways that really matter, this is so.

    To the club owners, raves are competition.

    To those who pay for all those TV advertisments,
    psychedelics threaten their ability to manipulate us.

  I think the idea of posting the rave notices at the science
fiction convention is a terrific idea.
  Say... has anyone ever written a science fiction tale with a rave
setting? Seems like a natural alliance.

Seems like we have some positive momentum to ride on this week:

- Vision: Successful "Big" rave raising hope that the vibe isn't
completely limited to the "underground".  

- Last Sunday's GG PArk: Even the lack of a sound system couldn't
squash our spirit.

- Planning for the Malachy benefit: Promoters coming together to
forge a greater sense of community among the people who may be in
the best position to create or destroy it.

- The GG Park victory over city beauracracy:  Of note here is *how*
it came about (communication, not conflict), and how the issue has
brought us closer together, yet again.

Our sense of "We"-ness is growing stronger as we face and deal with
adversity.  As diverse as we are, music, dance, and the ability to
look beyond ourselves will continue to unite us.  Ya know what?  I  
think I'm ready to party!

I will definately be at Tilt-A-Whirl and GG PArk on Sunday.  Hope
to see everyone then.

Just wanted to let everybody know that Mission Rock is back after its brief
hiatus.  As usual, the DJ combination will be some combination of James and
Gavin from Tweakin' Records.  Outdoor dancing (weather looks good so far), view
of the water, great DJs-- what more do you want? 

Oh, Synergy Visuals?  You got 'em.  =)
This is much less a shameless plug for the club than a shameless plea to meet
some of you folks.  If you do go, please say hello. I wanna meet you people!

Have a good weekend everyone!

A pretty rare thing happened last night-- live house music!  I know it happens,
but not often enough, IMHO.  Dubtribe and Space Time Continuum (Jonah)
played for about 2 hours last night at DNA, mixing back and forth between each
other before fading into Robbie and the start of Deep Faith.  Good Stuff!
Dubtribe (good friends, really good people, BTW) come with some heavy beats,
layered samples, live vocals and assorted tweaking.  Jonah looks like he could
be the next Aphex Twin.  He started the show slowly- nearly ambient and slowly
worked into a 303-heavy acid trip-- really trancy, really hard hitting.  Take
a chance on either one of these groups next time you see them on a flyer.

Peace,

Subject: No GG Park This Week  =(

I'm sad to relay the news that the park thing will not happen this Sunday.

Although the park permit was secured (the park commission actually
waived a lead-time requirement), the amplified sound permit required
by the SF Police could not be arranged in time.

In a way this may be a blessing:  the event on the 18th will definitely
take place, in conjunction with Come/Unity and Bicycle Day, and will
kick off what will certainly be weekly park raves throughout the summer
(weather permitting).  It will go off like a rocket, maybe all the more
so for having to wait the extra week.

Personally I'm going to avoid the nocturnal scene this weekend, try to spend
as much time as possible in the great outdoors, and store up energy for
Things To Come!

Good weekend, all!

	Indeed this is true, but there is still something that bother's
	me about the Scene and it is growing.  I'm talking about the
	use of Meth.  It's getting really out of hand.  I guess I'm just
	an old fuddy-duddy reactionary but the shit IS bad.  It's worse
	than alcohol cuz it makes you emotionless and mean. Yeah you stay
	up but what good are you at the party if your heart isn't open and
	ready to accept/generate the Vibe.  Lot of promoters are doing it
	so they can promote, DJ are doing it so they can go from one gig
	to the next, Ravers are doing it so they can stay up all weekend
	and go from party to party. I'm starting to see people who are
	younger then me with dark circles under their eyes fro this shit.
	I'm just about at the point of writing a flyer about the use of Speed.

	I'm not saying that it should be outlawed or anything but people
	need torealize that they CAN rave without it.  I've gone over
	40 days so far without E and I haven`t done speed in 20 years but
	I know what it can do.  How would people feel if folks started showing
	up with CRACK pipes at raves!  Well speed is the same thing, it may not
	pull you down as fast but it will pull you down!

	So does anybody have any Ideas? Or am I just ranting?

Agreed. There is something to be said for a little help in making it through
the night, but certainly not three nights etc. L or E, however, does the job
nicely without impacting the Vibe. My favorite part of the party is usually
5-6 am, and sans anything i just never make it that long...zzzzzzzz

maybe *long* naps are the key. sure would impact the family less. My wife
has a hard time with the idea of getting high on e or l every couple weeks.
Anybody else out there with family experiencing similar conundrums?

I managed 48 hours during the weekend of "Rites" and I didn't even have
caffienne to keep me going.  Of course, I'm conditioned for this now.  At my
first rave, I started hallucinating because I was so tired.

> 	So does anybody have any Ideas? Or am I just ranting?

I don't know how you can stop people from doing any sort of drug.  Possibly by
advertising a "drug free" event, but then you get that whole sort of "just say
no" nausea that follows with that.  Maybe I'm just ignorant, but I don't
really look for people doing anything.  I'm sure there were stimulants at
Wicked, but I barely noticed myself, let alone a super-charged Jon Drukman
(not that Jon was on anything besides the music).

What's ironic is although I've never done any sort of drug, except for a
year-long bout with alcohol, I embrace drug-culture.  Put me in a room with
Primal Scream and an oil lamp and I'm happy.  Maybe I'm just being naive.

Subject: A Meth Tale


  This is the kind of story that just made me roll my eyes when the narcs
told such stories at my high school.  However, this one is true.  I saw it:

   Don Wolfey was a damn fine writer and a dedicated Harley rider. He started
taking meth to get himself jacked up to write during the barren stretches that
every writer knows and dreads.  He came to feel that meth not only helped
his writing: is kept him healthy ("When I feel a cold coming on, I just
take a little shit, and the cold goes away, man.  It's God gift!").
  Then he started telling his friends that he was being watched and
followed.  We'd be sitting in a room talking about something... anything
... and he would get up several times in an hour, peer out the window,
look up and down the street, then sit down again.  Pretty soon, he began
to look at all his friends as if they were planning to do something to
him.  The paranoia was worst when he was on speed, but it seeped into his
"normal" life as well.
  In the end, Don wouldn't come out of his bedroom.  He had to be taken
away to a mental institution.  That was many years ago, and I think he's
still there.
  What a waste of talent, what a tragedy for himself, his friends and his
family.  It was clear to me that it was meth pure and simple that caved in
his brain. There are ways to fly without jumping off a cliff. There are
ways to get high without resorting to meth.
  Geoff is right.  But meth kills more than just the vibe.

Subject: Safe-Sex Drive Aimed at Users of Drug Ecstasy


[Are there any correlations between MDMA use and sexual activity? -Sean]

From the April 9th Sacramento Bee:
From: ???
Date: ???
Subject: ???

A novel safe-sex campaign aimed at late-night revelers and
dance club enthusiasts hopes to reinforce AIDS awareness
among people who use the drug ecstasy.

The San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the Haight-Ashbury
Free Clinic said yesterday that they will begin distributing
information flyers about ecstasy at a dance club tomorrow.
The leaflets identify problems associated with the drug, a
popular amphetamine that proponents say induced a feeling of
well-being and helps break down social inhibitions.

The flyers, designed in the same psychedelic poster style
used to promote rave parties and club shows, remind revelers
that unsafe sex usually occurs when partners become carried
away and forget to use condoms.

Another flyer warns that ecstasy dehydrates the body and
should be accompanied by plenty of water. Another warning
urges club members to "take care of each other." All the
leaflets state that drug use is not encouraged.

"People are dancing and meeting people and coupling in
clubs," said Lee Pappas, an education coordinator for the
San Francisco AIDS foundation. "So we're very concerned that
people under the influence of drugs are really aware of the
risk of HIV."

Pappas said the foundation based the safe-sex campaign on
the widely quoted 1991 Young Men's Health Survey conducted
by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, which
found an increasing rate of HIV infection among men in their
late teens and early 20s.

most people on E that i've observed tend to go sit quietly in a corner
and fondle each other.  not that that's a bad thing, just that it
doesn't instantly give one the impression of a drug-crazed kid dancing
like there's no tomorrow.

i wasn't on anything at wicked although i did partake of a tasty iced
mocha around 3 AM.  the music was so fucking funky and wonderful that
i *had* to jump around like the funky white boy that i am.

it's always the music.  i can be hyped on any substance known to man
but if they start playing that diva crap, i'm sitting down.
preferably somewhere far far away from the main dance floor!!

About meth:

I've watched people become incredibly despondent. The one word that comes 
to mind to describe people who frequent meth is: lacking; lacking good sleep, 
lacking emotion of any sort (I think the meaness and short fuses are NOT 
results of the meth, but sleep-deprivation, which, BTW, is often used as a 
form of torture.). I've seen people literally burn out. Supposedly, this 
stuff burns you from the outside in: one of my friends (she finally stopped; 
yeah!) developed a rash, becaue the meth had fried her system so much and 
left her so anxious that her nerve-endings on her skin freaked out. You might 
say she was allergic to it, but given enough, who wouldn't be? another friend 
began to have anxiety attacks; you know, the ones where you think you're 
having a heart attack; the list goes on and on, I'm sure.

Geoff- I whole-heartedly support fliering or any type of anti-meth propoganda. 
Let me know if you need another writer.

How about this: No More Crackin' On; if you have been awake for more than 
48 hours, please go home and sleep and eat and take care of yourself.
The parties will still be there; we promise!

or for the promoters/dealers: 

The market will still be there, we promise! (just teasing, sort of)


About the nap taking/ways to stay up for the 5-6am crowd:

I recommend staying at home and sleeping 'til about 3:30-4am or so,
then getting up and going out. Have a good breakfast, even!
There are only two problems with this method:

1. it takes dedication to answer a wake up call in the middle of the night-
   look at it as a test to see if you really want to go....
2. sometimes it's a little difficult to jump into the groove in the 
"morning."

ALSO- make sure you're awake to drive!

Love-

Jocelyn

Subject: PICNIC on MT. TAM this Sunday!



	Since the Park is not happening, I and a few friends
	have decided to have the Picnic on top of Mt. TAM this
	Sunday (Easter). It will be a pot luck so bring your own
	food, where we are going doesn't allow fires so pre-cook
	everything or bring cold dishes, drinks and plenty of water.
	NO GENERATORS OR LARGE SOUND SYSTEMS ALLOWED!
	Boom Boxes are OK!  I will post explicit directions to the site
	shortly after I see how many people are interested.  For those
	who have a hard time, we can meet on the vista point on the NORTH
	side of the Golden Gate bridge at 2 p.m.  If we get to the site at
	2:30 - 3:00 this gives us a full 4 hours of sunlight including
	a spectacular sunset into the pacific ocean.


	What to bring:

		o  Blankets
		o  Sun screen
		o  Food, water, beverages, utensils, napkins, for yourself
		   and for TWO others.
		o  Tapes, boom boxes, CDs, musical instruments, drums, etc.
		o  Telescopes, binoculars.
		o  Poetry stuff to share
		o  Toilet paper
		o  Sacrements (It is after all Easter/Passover )
		o  Good Vibes

	What to leave Home:

		o  Two turntables and a mixer
		o  Gasoline powered generators
		o  Attitude
		o  Crystal, Speed, Crank, etc.

	BAsic directions:

	101 north cross the GG Bridge thru the tunnel take Rt. 1 exit
	to Mt Tam, Muir woods, NORTH.  Stay on Rt.1 for several miles
	turn left at traffic light (still rt 1) continue up 
	untill you see a turnoff on your right marked Mt. Tam, muir woods.
	take the turnoff, continue up, (if you get to green gulch farm on rt.1
	you missed the turn, go back and try again.)
	Continue allong taking in the scenery till you get to Mountain Home
	It is a junction of 4 roads, take the road to Mt. Tam state park
	(the middle one that goes up) continue for a few miles more untill
	you see a sign for Mt. Tam State park, turn right, continue up
	past bootjack trail eventually you will go around a bend and see 
	the pacific ocean sprawled out about 1000 below you, continue to
	the parking lot on your right THIS iS THE PLACE.


	Call me if you have any questions.

(lots of stuff deleted)

The San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the Haight-Ashbury
Free Clinic said yesterday that they will begin distributing
information flyers about ecstasy at a dance club tomorrow.
The leaflets identify problems associated with the drug, a
popular amphetamine that proponents say induced a feeling of
well-being and helps break down social inhibitions.

The flyers, designed in the same psychedelic poster style
used to promote rave parties and club shows, remind revelers
that unsafe sex usually occurs when partners become carried
away and forget to use condoms.

Sure.  Make sure you include the good (positive) effects as well as
the negative, and also make sure that you make it clear that all the
negative long-term effects are quite possibly also true for E, since
the two are very similar chemically.  The nice thing about the info-E
flyers is that they are (fairly) objective.

About the nap taking/ways to stay up for the 5-6am crowd:

I recommend staying at home and sleeping 'til about 3:30-4am or so,
then getting up and going out. Have a good breakfast, even!
There are only two problems with this method:

1. it takes dedication to answer a wake up call in the middle of the night-
   look at it as a test to see if you really want to go....
2. sometimes it's a little difficult to jump into the groove in the
"morning."

ALSO- make sure you're awake to drive!

Subject: Info for Meth flyers..

If anyone is doing info flyers on methamphetamine, they might want
to contact my friend Dr.Gantt Galloway at the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic.
He's been using the amino acid tyrosine (about 6 grams/day mostly in the morning)
to help people go off methamphetamine and has found it very helpful.
We're currently trying to get NIH to fund a larger,double blind study..
(he's currently in the midst of a 'historically controlled'
study,which has been very promising.)Tyrosine is an amino acid that
serves as the direct nutritional precursor of norepinephrine and dopamine,
the two neurotransmitters released by stimulants like amphetamines and cocaine.
This research needs to be supported.Long term drug abuse ratts given tyrosine
dramatically reduced their self-injection of amphetamine,and several anecdotal
studies of tyrosine with methamphetamine and cocaine using humans have
been promising too.If this is true,it could help treat stimulant abuse,
at a much lower cost than current treatment options offer.
(maybye thats why research has been so slow to be funded,recovery is big
business..)

Maybe I'm just sensitive becuz the Cyborganic Be-In was my baby, but  
I'm going to jump back in here anyway...

One of the major criticisms levied at raver- / generation-x cultures  
is their lack of interest in historical perspectives on much of  
anything. It is a sad day indeed if our desire to be "in the now,"  
our sense of kitch, and our psychedelic-simulacrum-seeking prevents  
us from being able to understand what is happening now in light of  
what has happened before.

I wholeheartedly agree with Brian that those who forget the past are  
doomed to repeat it.

Though hippiedom died partially because of adverse public reation,  
that reaction was not to the values held by the hippies such as  
peace, freedom, etc., but by the means they used to achieve them. The  
psychic empowerment, ritual celebration, community, and positive  
energy that form the core of what most of us enjoy about raving are  
all positively rooted in the *good* parts of sixties psychedelic  
culture / hippiedom. I, for one, think those elements are absolutely  
worth preserving. And I think that drawing parallels between then and  
now helps to do just that.

Referring to the past doesn't mean that you live there.

	Since the Park is not happening, I and a few friends have
	decided to have the Picnic on top of Mt. TAM this Sunday

	post explicit directions to the site shortly after I see how
	many people are interested.  For those who have a hard time, we
	can meet on the vista point on the NORTH side of the Golden
	Gate bridge at 2 p.m.  If we get to the site at 2:30 - 3:00
	this gives us a full 4 hours of sunlight including a
	spectacular sunset into the pacific ocean.


	What to bring:

		o  Blankets
		o  Sun screen
		o  Food, water, beverages, utensils, napkins, for yourself
		   and for TWO others (i.e. to share) .

	the tunnel and down the other side, exit at Rt 1 north (Stinson
	Beach) Follow Rt 1 as it turns left at the stop light onto
	shoreline highway.  Continue along for a very twisty 2.5 miles
	untill your reach a turn off to your right and signs to Mt. Tam
	(this is the beginning of Panoramic Highway). Continue along
	Panoramic Highway until you reach 4 corners. Take the Middle

	another 2 or three miles passing Mountain Home on your right.
	Stay on panoramic highway for another two miles till you come
	to the entrance marked Mt. Tam State Park, turn right, Continue
	along this road for about 1 mile, you will eventually come

Subject: weekend update


Friday night, I checked out Mission Rock ($5.00), which was simply
great. Nothing like dancing away a few hours in the open air without
smoke machines, cigarettes, and with a delicious view of the
marina/bay. The afterparty for mission rock ($1.50) was at a graffiti'd
graveyard for buses and trains overlooking the bay and industrial
docklands of SF. This was probably a "break-in", but I never saw a cop
or anything. The soundsystem was a bit sucky at the afterparty because
they got a cheesy generator that could only drive one side of the
soundsystem (sans subwoofers) -- so there were alot of interruptions
due to circuit breakers blowing and all.... Fortunately, there was a
stadium-lit boat yard off in the  distance providing much visual
stimulation, so I spend some time just "sittin on the dock of the
bay"....  When I got back from the docks around 4:30AM,  most of the
dance floor had cleared, and since we were tired (stimulant of the
evening was a cappucino), we went to sleep. Overall, a nice night of
outdoor raving and ravercise. 

Saturday night, went to Groove Kitchen at "Big Heart City" ($10.00) and
had a good time as well. The new location is a big improvement over 174
king st, cleaner, less crowded, and the vibes were better as well. Got
there around 1AMish, which is far too early, so we played pool for a
while and chilled until the music got good at 2:30AM. Sound became
massive and tasty around 3-4AM with a solid infusion of funk/dub/ragga
beats interspersed with some trancy stuff as well. Left at 5 since the 
music was getting less interesting and our cappucino was wearing off.
DJs were supposedly Adonis, Ernie Munson, and Doc Martin -- don't know
who was playing when, but I suspect Ernie Munson was the DJ dropping
the beats that motorvated my booty.

   Sure.  Make sure you include the good (positive) effects as well as
   the negative, and also make sure that you make it clear that all the
   negative long-term effects are quite possibly also true for E, since
   the two are very similar chemically.  The nice thing about the info-E
   flyers is that they are (fairly) objective.

I disagree.  I don't think there are any positive effects of methamphetamine
that are worth mentioning.  Sure, I know that people who use it feel they get
something from it, but I don't see any point in saying what that is just in
order to present an "objective" picture.  Objectivity, to me, means that if
a drug is addictive and dangerous and has little redeeming value, we say so.

I know that the consensus culture likes to paint all illegal drugs as
uniformly destructive; and it's natural that those of us who have discovered
that they're not (and have noticed that some of the legal ones are worse)
might go to the opposite extreme and think that they all have some redeeming
value.  But I don't think this is true either.  I think each one has to be
considered on its own, for the value, and, yes, dangers that it presents.
Only then can people make informed choices.

So personally, I would like to see a lot of people in raveland take the line
that methamphetamine is nasty stuff and we just don't want it around.  The
consensus culture will sprain its brain trying to understand that we accept
the use of some drugs while taking a hard line against others, but maybe after
a while it will start to get the message that they aren't all the same.

Also, I can tell you from personal experience that MDMA does not have the same
kind of long-term destructive effect as methamphetamine.  I used to take quite
a lot of MDMA, and while it certainly isn't good for the body or the brain --
in particular, I am inclined to agree with speculation that it does some
damage to the immune system -- after I quit, I was completely back to normal,
so far as I could tell, within two or three months.  And I never got paranoid
(at least, no more than I was already :-).

I understand that there is a fine line to walk: that a sufficiently negative
info flyer on methamphetamine would push a lot of people's "establishment
bullshit" buttons.  I think we should try hard to avoid that, but not at the
expense of telling the truth about the stuff.

While it may not be germaine to the specific topic of raves, various
amphetamines have been clinically prescribed for 40+ years to treat a
variety of problems, ranging from eating disorders to controlling
hyperactivity.  Whether things like that are worth mentioning or not
is up to whoever writes the flyer.  Also whether it is meant to be a true
informative flyer or propaganda.

Well said... I agree completely.

Really?  I know people who, after extensive MDA and MDMA usage
behaved/appeared exactly like someone who had taken a lot of speed.  It
just took longer.  I'm glad you haven't had any problems.

That's a good point... an info flyer will do no good if it's dismissed
as Just Say No crap out of hand.

This is all IMHO, of course.

I'm not necessarily arguing your point, but . . . Everything is addictive.
Many many things are dangerous and quite a few things have little redeeming
value.

My point you ask?  Well, simply that I would rather have a truck driver who is
going to do a 2 day run (solid) try to do it on meth than through willpower.

I think everything has it's time and place, but I do agree that raves are
neither the time nor place for it.

I do not in any way advocate the use of meth, but if you are going to do it
have a specific reason.  Don't become a speed freak and do lines everyday.
I've seen some people handle it well and I've seen it destroy others.  As
always, it's *your* choice, make the right one.

I don't see why we should take a hard line on others.  I think we should
emphasize that meth detracts from the experience of sharing and doesn't mix
well with raves.  If people want to do drugs other than the ones ravers do
then I don't see who we are to say whether a drug is good or bad.  We're
stilling being leftist (as opposed to) rightist fascists.

Definitely.  I'd agree about trying to educate people.  I think that handing
out a pamphlet on Meth (aa very objective one) similar to the one on 'E' would
be a very good starting point.

but happy families picnicing at Marx Meadow. 

 Didn't want to wait for TAZ , so I drove back down south - BUT, did a snap
decision and drove to Bonny Doon and ate a real late "Easter" lunch of
deli-bought devilled eggs and a rye roll. Hardly anyone there at 6:30 PM -
drank some hot chocolate and watched the waves.

 - So , did anybody get any sunshine raving done today ?  :-)

 Well , since the weather has warmed up, maybe we can start meeting for 
lunch at that park in Palo Alto again. I got a request/suggestion -
start at 12:00 noon instead of 12:30 - it would mesh better with my work
schedule that way . But , I can still make 12:30 .

  So , since the Grateful Dead are playing at Shoreline , will there be an
 Atomic Rooster there ? Since the parking lot is smaller , the Shoreline 
 security may not be as forgiving as Oakland Colesium's security...
 
  But , since Shoreline is a lot closer to me than Oakland, it'd be nice to 
 see Planet 6 et al there.

Well, I decided to check out Instinct on friday night since I was on the
guest list, even if it was all the way out in Santa Clara.  Bad move.
I can't say exactly what it was like, because I never made it in the door.
It turned out to be at One Step Beyond 8-(, and it was supposed to start
at 11:30.  We got there around 12, and there were about 50 or 60 people
still waiting for the doors to open.  We waited.  And waited.  Many annoying,
flyer toters shoving the same "Love American Style" and "Wally World
(yuck)" flyers in my face every few minutes.  After about 45 minutes, and
with the news that the cover was going to be $25, most people were leaving.
 We heard that something was going on at 2am at Charter Oak (Future
Forum?), so we headed back to the city.  We waited.  And waited.  No sign
of anyone at Charter Oak.  There were about 20 or 30 people waiting with
us, one who kept banging violently on the alluminum door of the warehouse.   
Was something really supposed to be going on there?  Well, we grooved to
the Ford Escort sound system for a while, then came home at around 2:45.  It
was an adventure, if anything.  So goes my weekend...

I agree, I think the info-M flyer (or equivalent) should be primarily 
against the use of the drug.  But it should make its point not with rhetoric
but with facts, and those facts better not come from any U.S. government
institution :)  But.... I have known people who have used methamphetamine
responsibly, so I don't think advocating a total ban would be worth our time.
By "responsibly" I mean having to drive home 60 miles away in the morning and
doing a little to help stay awake, or those who use it once every three 
weeks or less, and still hold respectable jobs and/or go to school and/or
are brilliant people.  

So we all can agree that speed is something people abuse way too much in the
scene... but I think instead of telling people "No!  Bad raver!  No lollipop"
we need to think about the underlying reason for taking speed.  Some people can
not help the fact that they live 60 miles away from SF, and coming into the
city is a major thing for them, so if they come they decide to stay all weekend,
and use speed to stay up.  This is true for the majority of "speed phreaks" I
have met.  Others may use "Mother's Little Helper" when they have to go to work
early the next day, or for some reason or another sleep just doesn't become
something they have the time for.  

Maybe the way to address this is to have more options for people post-rave, on
both Saturday and Sunday mornings, and make it a place where they can CRASH,
sleep for at least a few hours to recharge their batteries if need be, have some
food, etc.  Or better yet, if you have friends who you know live far away and
drive a lot, offer to provide a crash=space for them if you live closer (I keep
waiting for the Santa Cruz people to get together a post-Bonny-Doon-FMR thing :)

Hey, I was another one of tthose folks who made it to
Instinct because I was on the guest list

Yo.  I went to Instinct.  I was on the guest list too.  I
showed up 

Hey, I was on the Instinct guest list too.  Yeah, they
started way late, but I got in the door more or less on
time, in part due to the imense lack of organization.  I did
notice lots of people wandering away, and tis true the place
never did seem to get crowded.  I'd never been to One Step
before, and I didn't realize where I was until I was inside
the door.  Lots of people wandering around, vaugely getting
things set up, but no one seemed to know what needed to be
done.  I kept offerring to help, but this seemed to baffle
everyone I talked to.  There did seem to be a surplus of
fascist types "Can I Help You?  What are you doing here?
Please wait over there."  

I was watching the poor warm-up DJ trying to get things
moving, and after awhile it dawned on me that the dance
floor was set up kind of stupidly: there was a big platform
in the center of it with people sitting on it.  Why would
you waste prime dance floor space like that?  Still later I
figured out what was up: the main dancefloor & lightshow was
centered on the *far end* of One Step.  The DJ was isolated
from this, set up in a small area near the door.  The
dancers could not see the DJ and even worse, the DJ could
not see the dancefloor.  

After awhile, the babe freind and I hit the dance floor...
and something happened to the techno.  It went to some sort
of instrumental hip-hop...  This did not bother the
babe-friend, who seems to be able to put in tremedous
amounts of energy dancing to almost anything, but it did
distrub me.  Maybe I've got a mental block on hiphopping,
but it still strikes me as immensely low energy music.
Visited the DJ area later and discovered that Spun had taken
over.  I gather the concept was start with hip-hop, move
through break-beat, and take it back to techno.  This may
sound nice on paper, but I don't think it works, certainly
not for anything but the absolute first DJ to go on.  

Had to take off early, so we didn't get to hear Jeno, but
given the surroundings I don't see how it could've been more
than a generic Jeno set.  There was no chance of interacting
with the "crowd". 

They were collecting $5 donations for Malachy.  I hope some
of the money made it to him.  

So the few hundred folks that were there paid $25 to get in?
I hope most of them were on the guest list.  

(By the way, I see on the Weekly list that there's a Monday
night event that advertises it's "All ages"!  I think this
definitely deserves some support.  I'm going to try and
check it out either tonight or next week.  Anyone know
anything about it?  

The list info is: "House Coffee - DJ Stefan blends house
grooves", "115 4th St., Railroad Square (Hot Spots) 546-8665".)

We headed up to Mt. Tam early spending nearly an hour trying to
figure out which spot was the designated gathering location.  We
finally settled on what was the the most beautiful area of rolling
green hills with an absolutely mesmerizing view of the ocean, city
etc.  It was so naturally hypnotic that we kept our boombox off,
decided that the sound of the wind was superior than anything we
could play.  Someday, virtual reality machines with direct neural
interfacing might be able to replace all this, but until then, the
real thing works very well indeed.

After another hour or so we noticed small energized clumps of humans 
on a hill in front of us, so we hiked over to find various groups of 
ravers that included Geoff, Astroboy, MykL, Chris, Shaun, Bob Jesse, 
Brian.  There were a couple of boomboxes and a car stereo going, which 
sounded a little out of place in this mountain paradise.  

2 congenial park rangers came by to let us know that they knew we were
ravers and to tell us that we needed a permit to do what we were doing 
but that we could stay until the park closes (9:00) as long as we clean 
up after ourselves.  They explained that we were on an ecologically fragile
spot, and would have directed us to a different location if we had let 
them know of our plans.  This seemed fair enough.  A little later a
ranger in a truck used a bullhorn to tell us the same stuff.

It was nice to see everyone, but Janie & I, overcome by the romantic
beauty of the area decided to slip away to be by ourselves.  Sorry if
we seemed antisocial, but we just fell into one of those couple-in-love 
kind of things.  Thanks Geoff for inspiring us to get our asses up
there.

DODGING BULLETS AT PARTY

3 suspects arrested after fatal shooting

By Mary Anne Ostrom, Mecrury News Staff Writer

A private dance party in a warehouse near Watsonville, CA. turned deadly
early Saturday when three men who had been turned away earlier shot indiscrim-
inately through a metal door into a crowd of more than 100 partygoers.

At least four people were hit, including an 18-year-old Santa Rosa man who
died of a gunshot to the head, according to the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's
Office.

"Three young males were denied access to the party and threatened to come
back with a gun," said Lt. Ken Oakes of the sheriff's office.  He said
they returned around 2:30 a.m. and with a small caliber rifle shot through
the warehouse's roll-up metal door.

Three suspects, at least two of whom are from the Watsonville area, were
arrested and taken into custody by Saturday evening.

Young people, mostly from Santa Cruz and the Bay Area had gathered at the
warehouse for a rave, a private dance party with a disc jockey playing
"techno" music that was to go from midnight until dawn.  An estimated 150
people had paid $10 each to attend, one of the partygoers said.

GUEST AT RAVE PARTY FATALLY SHOT

As the disc jockey was mixing three records, "all of a sudden large thuds
echoed off the back of the warehouse.  It sounded like six or seven shots
in succession.   The whole room vibrated," said 22-year-old Michael Rohner,
a student at the University of California, San Diego who had lived in 
Saratoga.  "Everyone went to the back and got low to the ground."

Several of his friends were hit or grazed by bullets in the legs, ankle and
thigh.  "People were scared and frightened and comoforting each other,"
Rohner said.

Damien Gabriel Caesar of Santa Rosa was shot in the head and rushed to
Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, where he died Saturday afternoon after
undergoing surgery.  Oakes said three others who required treatment for 
gunshot wounds had been released.

Oakes and Rohner said the incident began when a large group of men tried
to get into the party at 2560 Freedom Blvd.  A fight ensued between the
men and the party's makeshift security guards.

Rohner said about 30 minutes later several men returned and began throwing
bottles at the door, then left again.  Thirty minutes later, Rohner, who
said he had been dancing near the door, heard the gunshots.

After questioning about 30 witnesses, sheriff's deputies arrested Jose
Luis Flores Mendoza, 18, of Las Lomas, while he was driving the suspected 
getaway vehicle in downtown Watsonville.  Raul Edgar Valencia, 21, was
later arrested at his Marine Street home in Watsonville and a third,
unidentified suspect was also tken into custody.

All three were being questioned Saturday evening, and no charges had yet 
been filed.

I was sitting around the house listening to Brian Eno's "Ambient 4: On
Land" and when it ended, all the creaks of the house and the noises
from the street sounded just like part of the record.  So I just sat
there for about 30 minutes, listening to the ambient music being
created live by my house and the surrounding environs.

Wow.

Given that many (most?) ravers are disdainful about the use, I stress
USE (i.e. not even including ABUSE) of alcohol, I personally can't
see the problem with using propoganda, plain and simple. Calling out
propoganda as such is a better solution than offering an "objective"
info-flier. If the point of the info flier is to get people to quit 
using/abusing meth, then it isn't really "objective;" is it? 

I just think that "facts" about pretty much anything are never 
completely "solid." Didn't someone mention the positive medical uses 
of meth?  It's the whole text vs. context/contents vs. packaging 
tamale, no? If we want to influence the scene and get 
people off of this stuff (BTW, the folks who are hooked, but are 
also "functional," are gonna need motivation), we might as well
just point out what we've noticed to be the case. How many 
"METH KILLS THE VIBE" posts do we need?

Maybe we could head the flier with:

Warning: Anti-Meth Propoganda Contained Within This Flier!

It's Honest, it's direct, it's simple:

"we" (heck, I'll sign my name) don't like what we see with this drug.
it's harmful not only to the individuals who frequent it, but to our 
community; METH KILLS THE VIBE! Please don't abuse it, or yourself,
becuase we need everyone's input to continue building the house.

Meth does not emulate Energy.
Speed cannot replace Spirit.

Peace-

Jocelyn

P.S. Has anyone else noticed that we (our culture in general?) are 
heading towards another temperance movement, much like the time of
prohibition? I don't mind; it's just something I noticed; and this

Agreed on the crowd energy comments on this.  And what's with Tony spinning
to the set up crew.  General confusion, but solid music.  Spun began with
a wicked Moving Shadow intro delving into further cut-up beats and jams.
I never made it to the Ernie set which was to follow for a few reasons.
One of which was the cryptic line of people surrounding Spun at the tables
without a trace of groove.  They just stood there.  I spotted Carlos dancing
nearby which kind of threw me.  That was neat.  In one sense, however, I'm
glad I found myself holed up at One Step.  Did anyone attend Good Friday
in Santa Cruz?  Apparently, their were gang related gun shots and the party
closed down.  Disgusting.

Don't remember.  They also mentioned that we could rent out the Mountain
Theatre for $150.  The Mountain Theatre is this really cool stone outdoor
theatre-in-the-round, which would be perfect for a rave.  But alas, no
amplified sound allowed.

Bob Jesse talked to the rangers a bit, so maybe he has some more info
to share?

   The party, Good Friday, was incredible.  The vibe was so good.  Everybody had
on a smile.  The music was great.  Then three people took it upon themselves to
ruin it all.  They first tried to get in, and got in a fight with the bouncer, and
cut his hand.  They threatened his life, and left.  The party almost stopped at 
this point, but Mary, the promoter, thought it would be ok.  The doors were locked,
and the music started back up.  Soon they came back and began hitting the metal
rolling door(Like a garage door).  The music again stopped, and everyone waited
until they stopped hitting the door.  It sounded like they were using bats, and
bottles.  The music started up again, and everybody screamed with excitement due
to the fact that they were unable to ruin the party.  This probably really pissed
them off, and they decided to come back with a gun.  
   I was right near the door when the shots were fired.  I was standing right next
to Gabe, who unluckily was shot in the back of his head.  I couldn't believe my

mary used to work here with me, and she's a cool person.  it sucks
to see someone who works to put on good undergrounds get shafted
like this.  not to mention gabe's family and him (whom i don't 
know personally).

this scares me, too.  am i the only person who feels threatened
(and somewhat /frightened/) by this?

my ex-girlfriend was there, and she said she left after the first 
round of shit-starting.  she normally hates raves and house music.
but she said that this was a "cool party with good house music"
being played. :) :)

then she added, "it was cool...you were right, but i'm not going
to any more raves.  there just too dangerous." :( :(

can we blame people for this type of attitude?  it seems like more
and more, raves are becoming synonymous for gangfights.  i know
this would never happen at an sfraves function, but how does this
get stopped???

once again, love and prayers for gabe's family.

   The party, Good Friday, was incredible.  The vibe was so good.  Everybody had
on a smile.  The music was great.  Then three people took it upon themselves to
ruin it all.  They first tried to get in, and got in a fight with the bouncer, and
cut his hand.  They threatened his life, and left.  The party almost stopped at 
this point, but Mary, the promoter, thought it would be ok.  The doors were locked,
and the music started back up.  Soon they came back and began hitting the metal
rolling door(Like a garage door).  The music again stopped, and everyone waited
until they stopped hitting the door.  It sounded like they were using bats, and
bottles.  The music started up again, and everybody screamed with excitement due
to the fact that they were unable to ruin the party.  This probably really pissed
them off, and they decided to come back with a gun.  
   I was right near the door when the shots were fired.  I was standing right next
to Gabe, who unluckily was shot in the back of his head.  I couldn't believe my 
eyes.  I just stood there, not reacting to the shots that were still being fired.

I am extremely saddened to see this happen to anyone. This is especially
uncomfortable for me. I decided against going to the rave here in Seattle
this past weekend for various reasons but was talked into  going to one
of the local "all crowds" dance clubs in Pioneer Square. (It was pretty
lame I might add.) As my friend and I were leaving around 2:00 AM, we
noticed that two guys were having a shouting match with each other. Being
just as curious as any other person, my friend and I stood and watched the
tragic events unfold. To make a long story short, one guy pulled out a 9mm
handgun and shot the other guy in the chest, killing him. The assailant
proceeded to pop out two or three more shots hitting two young girls in
hand and foot. The guy fled. We gave statements to the police. I then went
home to my apt. and was just catatonic. About 3:45 am I was "awakened"
by more fucking gunshots. I live in a nice neighborhood too. Too much
for me in the matter of two hours. It's bullshit when people go out to
enjoy themselves and end up losing their life. Over what?!!! BULLSHIT.

Thanks Lee, it seems you had the experience that I had intended everyone
to have.  The place has a certain magical beauty and the natural sounds
are indeed trance inducing in themselves.  I've heard several ravers say
what you said about turning off their BoomBoxes which is why I didn't
want people to bring sound systems.

Maybe now that everybody knows how cool the place is, we can have a more,

My major worry about this spot was the fact that it is
very beautiful with a lot of wild flowers around that shouldn't
be picked and that ravers=smokers and they would throw butts
all over the place and cause a fire.  We MOST people were considerate but
I did see people throw garbage in places where it shouldn't be
thrown which bummed me out.  I've been going to that place for years
and had mixed feelings about telling the "rave family" about
it
cuz I would never forgive myself if a fire got started there
because of us and I knew I was the one who made the careless ones aware

Who doesn't?  But the kind of shit that happened probably didn't 
happen because it was a rave but because it was a large gathering
at night and some gangbusters were looking for trouble.  Unfortunately,
this points to a need for professional security, and I mean professional
in a positive way, not some minimum-wage idiot who is just in it 'cause
he trips on patting people down.

> but how does this get stopped???

I was involved with putting on free concerts and theater performances
when I lived in Detroit; two major lessons come to mind. 

One, up to a point a conscious
crowd is its own best security.  Our theater performances were held in a
storefront on Skid Row.  Street folk would wander in and refquently be
disruptive.  Over time, tho, some of them became our friends and kind of 
kept the others in line or out.  A couple of them even wound up reading
their poetry.  The rave scene has lots of solidarity *inside* the events;
all the really bad stuff that happens seems to be started by people who arent'
really part of the party, and don't want to be.  

Two, large public events are going to attract unwanted attention, and 
the vibe alone will not be enough to prevent violence *if* the wrong
people are out to cause trouble.  They're not in an emotional state to
feel a positive vibe.  We once had an outdoor concert where our "security
committee" did not believe in violence.  The evening before the concert,
an unrelated group spray painted offensive slogans at the park.  Local
motorcyclists took offense.  Midway through the concert, they started
random fights with members of the audience.  Our pacifist security folks
disappeared.  Fortunately, the Detroit police intervened and for some
odd reason didn't stop the show.  They saved our butts.  Of course, they
could just as easily have broken lots of heads and arrested the promoters.
Point is, we were unprepared.  In that situation, we needed people who
knew some martial arts and were good at talking people down.  A violent
response may not of been needed.  The *perception* that violence would be
resisted *was* needed.  

I once had the privilege of working the door at a rave in Texas just 
around bar-closing time.  I was grinning and looking at people's -er-
hand stamps.  Next to me was a very large, calm, smiling man who was
deflecting the various drunks and rowdies who didn't want to pay $5 to
get in and were trying various scams.  ( If you're too much of a mess to
come up with a good story, maybe you're too much of a mess to add to the
vibe ).  Anyway, only one slight scuffle broke out, and my colleague had
merely to touch one guy on the shoulder and suggest maybe he ought to walk
home.  This guy was a pro; he didn't threaten or pose, he didn't have to.
He didn't diminish the energy at the party, tho not a raver he was pretty
friendly.  I'll bet if there were 2 guys like him at Santa Cruz the other
night things could have been different.   
>> They first tried to get in, and got in a fight with the bouncer, and
>> cut his hand. 
Maybe not, I wasn't there, and
I don't claim to be qualified to work the door in that kind of situation.
But I do think I've seen it done right.  It's quite an art.

Poor or weak security *invites* violence, it doesn't prevent it.
Unfortunately, this may even extend to armed security.  That's not a popular
thing to say, maybe, but if there's a large event with large flows of
cash, I sure hope the promoters take reasonable precautions.  More than once,
discussions of raves with non-ravers turn to the subject of "gawd they
must be making a lot of money".  I don't think I'm the only person that
ever heard this sort of reaction.

Good security = the door people at the FLoppy parties last year.
	Some BGP concerts have skilled security, others don't.
	Mark Metz knows some good door folk if last Junes Russion
	 river party is any indication.
	Being clandestine is some help, but I guess it's not 
	the insurance against trouble that we all wish it was.
Bad security = off-duty thugs like at Pilgrim's Pie.  Idiots in 
	Halloween cop suits just seem to *inspire* thugs.  Pat downs
	don't help much either, tho I don't mind that much (Remember,
	if you don't like it, pat them *back*, they ease up fast !!).

Subject: Security


Would "professional" security have prevented this Really Bad Thing from
happening?  I'm not sure.  The way people tell it, security had turned
these people away (their function, right?) but they came back, first
threatening from the outside, then shooting from the outside.  It doesn't
seem like this would have been prevented no matter how "professional"
the security was -- they could have just as well blown the bouncer's
face off first and then shot through the door.  Anyone angry enough to
go get a gun and plan on using it will be stopped by very little short
of a larger armed presence (not likely nor desirable).

Would smoother handling by the door people have kept the people from 
becoming angry enough to shoot?  I don't know, but my experience with
"security" services indicates that they would have pissed these people
off even more.

We're all looking for a reason that something senseless like this could
happen, and I don't think we can find it.  A warehouse of happy people
happened through chance to become the focus of anger for some seriously
screwed-up people, and another act of random violence occurs amongst
us rats locked in the society-cage, going a little crazier each day
and night.  The newspaper headlines become a little more real, and
the need for the temporary community and love of raves becomes even
greater.

I wish, for Gabe's family and friends, the strength to pass through
their grief.  And for everyone: Time passes.  So, in the future, will
we.  Now is the only time we are certain to have.  Let
's live it.

--- back to discussion mode ---

Given the total casualty rate in deaths per raver-hour, I still feel 
safer dancing like a demon than driving, riding my bicycle to work,
walking around DTSJ, or eating at Jack-In-The-Box.  I'm probably 
even right.  "When we do right no one remembers.  When we do wrong
no one forgets"- even if merely by association.  

In a society containing large numbers of angry people with guns, killings
will happen.  The only real solution is a society with less anger and
better ways to express it.  A good rave will address the first problem.
So make more! >^)

Of course, I could be totally full of horse feathers, but so can
everyone.  You knew that.

I really don't see how the shooting can be tied to a scene
gone bad.  I mean, given that there are X number of parties 
going on per week, with X steadily increasing, and Y the chance that 
something bad will happen at a particular event, and given enough time
even with Y very small the laws of chance tell us, well,  something
really bad is bound to happen every now and then.  It's really not
something you can try and attribute to the party itself; perhaps having 
it in Watsonville was a bad idea, but if Watsonville were to be off 
limits I can think of TONS of other venues which would be considered
bad.  I don't think the people at the party brought it upon themselves
by being "unconscious, self-centered and generally asleep."  This could
have happened at a Wicked, or a Come/Unity for that matter.  It's
chaos; it's bound to happen.  Unfortunately this time, and almost exactly
a month ago, chaos struck and took a very bad toll upon us.  We must
strike back and show Chaos that we can weather its ills, and be better for it.

My love goes out to Gabe and his family and friends; if there is a service 
please let us know about it, and if a fund or scholarship is set up in
his name, let us know too.

Fortunately the press has been semi-kind in the story - none of the articles
I've read have linked the shooting to the scene, at least not directly.

As for the danger of shooting at raves... all I can say is be careful this 
weekend, if the verdict comes out "not guilty" we are all in for some DEEP
TROUBLE.  The meeting tonight to plan Malachi's benefit next Saturday night
was dominated by the spectre of relocating it or postponing it.  The final 
decision will be made Thursday night, and all the promoters have agreed
that even if one person was hurt at the party or on the way to the party, it
wouldn't be worth it.  Some in the audience were of the opinion that, well,
we can create such an intensely wonderful vibe inside, that that would defuse
any tension and project such positive energy that any maliciousness going
on outside would stop.  I think that's really naive, the danger isn't from
people within the party but from those on the outside.  And even moving it
farther away from the city might not help things.... 

So stay tuned.

	Brian

That all ages weekly I was talking about smells fairly dead.
I called the voice mail number and it sounds like it's been
reassigned to someone else (telephones are astoundingly
stupid and archaic, and this is one of the clearest
proofs... when you get a "new" phone number, you have no way
of knowing if it belonged to some funeral parlour that just
went out of business and may still be listed in the yellow
pages).

(Brian: can we scratch "House Coffee" off of the list of
weeklies?).

And let's keep an eye out for all ages raves, huh?  I've got
some personal interest in this, since I've got a young girl
friend these days, but I really do think it's important.
Don't let them drive a wedge through this culture with some
stupid, arbitrary laws.

And just to do more some back-seat raving: A better security
force might have been prepared for those jerks coming back.
I've heard too many stories like that ("badasses go away,
come back with weapons").  The organizers *might* have
called the cops, except that I gather this was an
underground, which illustrates a problem with living on the
far side of the law, no?  Maybe this is another example of a
problem created by some stupid laws.

Anyway, just to keep a sense of perspective, what do you
think you'd get if you compared the occurence of violent
incidents involving bars with the occurence of violent
incidents involving raves?

I probably can't make it to Come/Unity this Saturday, since
I'm going to be on the air (try tuning in on your way up,
south bay folks: 90.1FM midnight to 3AM).  See you all at
Golden Gate park on Sunday, though...

The New York Times, Sunday April 1993
 
Chilling Out With the Stocking-Cap Crowd
     Ann Powers
 
 
 
In pop music, the route to spiritual epiphany is usually accidental.  It
might occur during the second encore at a Springsteen concert or nearing 4
A.M.  on a downtown dance floor; at these moments, transcendence comes
with an air of spontaneity, no matter how carefully orchestrated the
circumstances.  To actively seek some sort of nirvana (remember when it
was used to be a state of consciousness, not a band?) seems silly to the
ranks of skeptics and hedonists that make up pop's hippiest ranks. 
Enlightenment is iffy business, at the least it was until raves brought
young scene makers into a brand-new age.
 
Tipping its stocking cap to psychedelia, the English-borne dance movement
known as rave encourages a belief in the possibilities of mind expansion
through electronic beats and synthesized hallucinogens.  On the dance
floor the quest resembles the dervish's twirl into frenzy.  But even the
most energetic ravers sometimes need a break and seek a space where their
mental journeys can flow a less physically demanding path.  This need has
resulted in the establishment of chill-out rooms in clubs as well as the
closest thing in years to a fashionable form if meditative music-ambient
house.
 
Over the past two years, ambient house has moved from clubs to record
labels, and some if its originators are beginning to find an audience  in
this country.  Among the best-known groups are the Orb, Ultramarine and
Orbital; 777, a collaboration between Alex Patterson if the Orb and the
progressive house rock guitarist Steve Hillage, has yielded a self-titled
American album, available on Caroline Records.  Caroline has also just
issued "Excursions in Ambience," a compliation of English, Dutch and
American ambient-house music that provides a thorough overview this
emerging style.
 
The tracks on  "Excursions in Ambience," which was complied by Brian Long
of Caroline and the New York club D.J.  Mr.  Kleen, range from
Ultramarine's sweet nostalgia trip for the 1970's, "Saratoga (Upstate
Mix)," to Psychedelic Research Lab's "Tarenah." featuring Tibetan
throat-singing and an East Indian drumbeat, to the happy android beats of
"Afterglow by It's Thinking.  Strangers to ambient house many find the
variety in these works hard to grasp at first.  But a few listens in the
proper state of reflective attention reveal the span of experimental 
moves that the creators of ambient house are making with seemly random
sounds.

In the late 80's, as a disk jockey in a London club, Mr.  Patterson
established the first chill-out room as a retreat for dancers who were
coming down from a chemical high or just tried.  He mixed  bits of
progressive rock with slowed-down synthesized rhythms to produce music
that was witty and seductive as the faster rave style.
 
Mr.  Patterson soon united with Jim Cauty, who had begun similar
experiments with his group, the KLF, to create a more than 30-minute-long
single entitled "A Huge Evergrowing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the
Center of the Ultraworld." That 1989 track contained elements that remain
integral to much ambient house.  Layered pulsating beats supported a
series of samples ranging from church bells to a rooster crowing to
altered passages of Minnie Ripperton's soul classic, "Loving You." A
female voice plucked out of context, often serves as muse in ambient house
recordings, and noises that would not otherwise be considered musical help
it redefine what music actually is. 
 
As does hip-hop, ambient house rearranges snippets of familiar sounds
within a bed electronic; but in this case, rapping does not ground the
tracks in narrative.  Instead, the samples become a guide to an aural
experience that is realized within the listener's own imagination. 
Ambient-house tracks (they're rarely songs, in the conventional sense)
don't tell stories; they aim to encourage dreams.
 
In this way, ambient house resembles the decidedly uncool genre of new-age
music.  New age is typically dismissed by young music fans as nothing more
than easy listening in hippie garb, purchased by balding men in Guatemalan
sweaters, desperately seeking psychic relief from their bourgeois burdens.
 Yet the genre shares one crucial element with the rock tradition: it
seeks to affect its listeners with a life-changing intensity.  The Rolling
Stones, the Clash or Pearl Jam all offer their fans some kind of
enlightenment whether sexual, personal or political.  Rock's dedication to
a do-it-yourself ethic and its often anti-intellectual fear of
"preachiness" keeps its lessons informal and streetwise.  New-age
composers, on the other hand, think of themselves as gurus, manipulating
sound either to produce specific physical responses (such as relaxation)
or to lead initiates on so-called spiritual journeys.
 

 
A somewhat willful obscure line of pop falls between these two extremes,
and it's that tradition that inspired ambient house.  The composer and
producer Brian Eno, who named the genre ambient, released as series of
minimalist electronic recordings in the mid-70's with titles like "Music
for Airports" and Apollo (Atmosphere and Soundtracks)." Mr.  Eno realized
that music runs on a continuum with the random sounds one hears during an
average day.  He structured his pieces in a diffuse away that subtly
created a mood, rather than forcing a narrative on listeners.  The new
approach to composition is central to ambient house.  His collaboration
with David Byrne," My Life in the Bush of Ghosts," sampled spoken
evangelical texts and other voices within a melange of dance rhythms,
foreshadowing ambient house's fascination with religious material and its
roots in dance.
 
Progressive rock by the likes if Pink Floyd, King Crimson and Mr. 
Hillage's former group, Gong, also leaves its mark on this music., mostly
through a shared interest in fantastic themes like science fiction,
Orientalism and mythology.  But while progressive rockers were all too
fond of a Dungeons-and-Dragons-style romanticization of medievalism,
ambient house pioneers favor space-age imagery.
 
Dub, a slow, thick and reverb-heavy style of reggae, also surfaces in
ambient house mixes.  The English producer Adrian Sherwood synthesized
dub, hip-hop and dance music in his influential work with groups like New
Age Steppers and Tackhead during the 80's.  World music, notably Indian
and Asian classical styles, also influences ambient house, with its use of
repetition to establish a trancelike state.
 
Mostly, however, the young brains behind ambient house feed their
creativity from the forest of the media that surround them.  Mr.  Long
notes that today's teen-agers, raised on hip-hops' beats and samples,
possess an entirely different idea of music's possibilities than do the
forebears, who are accustomed to the linearity of rock.  Ambient house
finds its soul in the link between the human experience and electronic
information.  Walking through Times Square, surrounded by video
billboards, dialing the phone and hearing a friend's recorded musical
message, channel-flipping after a hard day in front of the computer
terminal, many people spend their lives in constant communication with
electronic angles.  Ambient house makes a musical home for the spirit
using these signals sent through technology's stratosphere.

	This is not an accusation but maybe the police should have been called
especially when the bunch returned a second time and threw bottles at the door.
I know that the cops could have shut them down but this is risk you have to
take.  If I were a promoter, I'd rather have a busted party then a dead
raver any day.  Also, just curious, why were these guys not let in in the 
first place?  Were they drunk or did they "not look right"?  Even if they were
hardcore "vatos" they should be allowed in if they can pay the price and
show restraint.  Sometimes acceptance defuses dangerous people more than
resistance.  I can see these guys really getting upset that they were not
allowed into a "gringo" party and comming back to do a drive by.  Folks as
I said, if we want to operate outside of authority we have to be prepared for
this type of stuff to happen.  Security is not about keeping out a certain
element per say, it is about making the people who are inside secure, this
is a delicate thing, sometimes you can reason with gangsters, sometimes not,
sometimes you gotta make deals or at least keep the situation from escalating
which it seems to have done.

          Some Musings on Raving & the Evolution of Mankind

Some ravers feel that they have experienced something special while raving,
a kind of positive "vibe" supported by a shared set of ideals that seem 
"right" to us.  It is my belief that the activities associated with raving
represent a methodology by which many of us, despite having come from very 
diverse backgrounds, are able to attain shared states of consciousness that
may point to a future direction for the evolution of human existence.  Here
is a simplistic outline of some of the ideal concepts I have sensed through
raving:

- Physical selfawaremness combined with the transcendence of my physical
self: dancing & trancing, sleep deprivation.

- Connectivity with my immediate environment and the surrounding universe: 
Experiencing the Now and the loss of my self in the timelessness of 
neverending rhythms.

- Unity and community, caring and sharing: seeing how we are all capable of
experiencing the same feelings; each of us at our center are one and the
same.

- Awareness of the neverending journey, change, interactions, of everything 
through the evolving cycles and patterns in things and the discovery of new
limits to be challenged and explored: changing music, venues, relationships,
and use of technology in the house music scene.

The ideals of bringing people together, making them aware of themselves and
the world around them is nothing new.  Seeking harmony with the world while
challenging the limits that seem to be imposed on us by the world has
always been a part of human culture. 

Throughout history, humankind has struggled to define and attain an ideal
state of human existence. But human consciousness has always been controlled
by a mishmash of physical, biological, cultural and metaphysical forces.
These forces, often in conflict with each other, were capable of producing
minds with various ranges of undefinable chaos and selfperpetuating 
structure.  The brain, even with its hardwired tendancies, is completeley
programmable as well as selfmodifying, alonf with the concepts of 
right-&-wrong, good-&-bad, meaning-&-purpose.  The knowledge of the
malleability of the human mind is older than cave drawings, but the
exploration of mind potential has been crude and unscientific.  

Recently, new selfprogramming tools and technology have become available to
the common person.  Although people will continue to be influenced by
authoritarian forces like organized religion, education, and parenting,
people are discovering their ability to reprogram themSELVES more now
than anytime in human history.  Biological hardware modifications through 
neurochemistry, and eventually genetic engineering and mind/machine 
interfacing will be coupled with the software modifications acquired 
through various information networks and new forms of sensory stimulation.
This data will be filtered and  and transformed into percieved experiences
in ways that will be limited only by our imaginations.

LSD, MDMA, trance-inducing music & stimulating visual effects are only the
tip of the iceberg; just a hint of what we can do with ourselves.  

The techniques of reprogramming our minds are techniques of self-
empowerment.  Although communal guidance is very much a part of raving, and
may even be desirable, the communal acceptance of individuality and the 
lack of overbearing leadership can continue to foster unity through *choice*
and through *personal* exploration and discovery.  Disagreement is OK, 
and varied perspectives are fun, because our basic common unity is 
SELF-evident and will continue to make us care for and respect each other.

What is trying to be achieved, i.e. the "common good", "truth", or 
happiness, will always be debatable.  Definitions can be questioned, 
limits surpassed.  The recognition of a basic unity between all things can 
be viewed as a foundation from which all rules can be experimented with and
broken.  There will always be a question as to where the rights of 
individuals interfere with each other, and where freedoms need to be
restricted.  But human evolution may point to a solution to this dilemma.

The next step in human evolution is being characterized by our ability to
alter the way we experience reality.   We can now even reprogram the way we 
go about reprogramming ourselves.  By directly manipulating our minds, 
we are able to directly manipulate our experience of reality.  Each of us
will be able to choose to be a god or devil, a pattern of cosmic energy or 
a biological animal.  Both or neither.  We will be able to become  any 
combination of anything that can be conceived.  We will be able to choose
to recognize the independant existence of other beings, or see them as mere 
projections of our all-encompassing minds, or not see them at all.  In the
future, if we do indeed evolve, the  question each person may have to try 
to answer for themselves may simply be:

What do I want Reality to be?

Humans can seek the answer alone, or acknowledge the existence of other 
seeking minds with which they can join with in our adventures.  Or we can 
simply choose to experience our existence as it is now without attempting 
to understand it at all.  Whatever we do the choice will be ours.

On the 50th anniversery of civilization's discovery of LSD, I wish 
everyone fruitful, challenging, and mind expanding journeys of discovery 
and experience, wherever they may lead.  The future may be unknown, but
the potential will always be infinite.

challenging the limits that seem to be imposed on us by the world has
always been a part of human culture. 

Throughout history, humankind has struggled to define and attain an ideal
state of human existence. But human consciousness has always been controlled
by a mishmash of physical, biological, cultural and metaphysical forces.
These forces, often in conflict with each other, were capable of producing
minds with various ranges of undefinable chaos and selfperpetuating 
structure.  The brain, even with its hardwired tendancies, is completeley
programmable as well as selfmodifying, alonf with the concepts of 
right-&-wrong, good-&-bad, meaning-&-purpose.  The knowledge of the
malleability of the human mind is older than cave drawings, but the
exploration of mind potential has been crude and unscientific.  

Recently, new selfprogramming tools and technology have become available to
the common person.  Although people will continue to be influenced by
authoritarian forces like organized religion, education, and parenting,
people are discovering their ability to reprogram themSELVES more now
than anytime in human history.  Biological hardware modifications through 
neurochemistry, and eventually genetic engineering and mind/machine 
interfacing will be coupled with the software modifications acquired 
through various information networks and new forms of sensory stimulation.
This data will be filtered and  and transformed into percieved experiences
in ways that will be limited only by our imaginations.

LSD, MDMA, trance-inducing music & stimulating visual effects are only the
tip of the iceberg; just a hint of what we can do with ourselves.  

The techniques of reprogramming our minds are techniques of self-
empowerment.  Although communal guidance is very much a part of raving, and
may even be desirable, the communal acceptance of individuality and the 
lack of overbearing leadership can continue to foster unity through *choice*
and through *personal* exploration and discovery.  Disagreement is OK, 
and varied perspectives are fun, because our basic common unity is 
SELF-evident and will continue to make us care for and respect each other.

What is trying to be achieved, i.e. the "common good", "truth", or 
happiness, will always be debatable.  Definitions can be questioned, 
limits surpassed.  The recognition of a basic unity between all things can 
be viewed as a foundation from which all rules can be experimented with and
broken.  There will always be a question as to where the rights of 
individuals interfere with each other, and where freedoms need to be
restricted.  But human evolution may point to a solution to this dilemma.

The next step in human evolution is being characterized by our ability to
alter the way we experience reality.   We can now even reprogram the way we 
go about reprogramming ourselves.  By directly manipulating our minds, 
we are able to directly manipulate our experience of reality.  Each of us
will be able to choose to be a god or devil, a pattern of cosmic energy or 
a biological animal.  Both or neither.  We will be able to become  any 
combination of anything that can be conceived.  We will be able to choose
to recognize the independant existence of other beings, or see them as mere 
projections of our all-encompassing minds, or not see them at all.  In the
future, if we do indeed evolve, the  question each person may have to try 
to answer for themselves may simply be:

What do I want Reality to be?

Humans can seek the answer alone, or acknowledge the existence of other 
seeking minds with which they can join with in our adventures.  Or we can 
simply choose to experience our existence as it is now without attempting 
to understand it at all.  Whatever we do the choice will be ours.

On the 50th anniversery of civilization's discovery of LSD, I wish 
everyone fruitful, challenging, and mind expanding journeys of discovery 
and experience, wherever they may lead.  The future may be unknown, but
the potential will always be infinite.

Hi Peoples,

Sorry for the sudden influx of postings, but I finally found a machine that
(I hope) can talk reliably to the list servers, so I remailed some of my
failed postings over the last week. 

If some of you are seeing dupes, I apologize - hopefully this new machine

> 	So does anybody have any Ideas? Or am I just ranting?

No, definitely (and I think everyone agrees) Meth is baaaad.  I've seen many
friends, including one very close to me (who, I'm very happy to say, has
been clean since January!), be consumed from too much meth.  Meth seems like
a good short term perk (and while on E, who cares? ;-) but its long term
effects *will* suck the life out of you and leave an empty shell.  

The best way I've found to go all night is to live a healthy lifestyle:
eliminate (or reduce as much as possible) day to day stress;  eat healthy
and regularly; get enough sleep between long weekends and especially the
night before (or nap); and exercise regularly!  

Yes, dancing all night till you drop will give your body a hell of a
workout, but remember it's one that it needs to recover from.  Marathon
runners know this and will only push themselves to the limit maybe once a
month.  Then they back off and slowly build it back up again. 

Stay healthy in mind *and* body.

I think this is an excellent idea.  I've been lucky enough to have places to

the times I didn't - it was a *long* drive.  

In the same spirit, I'll offer a bean bag and blanket to anybody stuck in

Are you referring to psychedelics or to other factors as well?  If so which
ones?  I'm not being critical, just analytical.

I think some of the other things that freaked Joe Public were communal 
living, dayglo everything, rock n' roll, spiritualism rooted in Eastern
philosophy, sexual freedom, and the basic misinterpretation of the
'drop out' attitude.

Remember that these things weren't all that popular or well known to the
Mr. and Mrs. Average American (especially to the scale that the hip movement
brought), but America *had* just witnessed the Beat Generation. 

But, again, I think the BIG scare was the mass attraction to psychedelics.
The Beat Generation had psychedelics, but on the scale of the 60's.

Exactly.  So let's not only not forget the past, but try to understand it:
What *were* the 'mistakes' that we don't want to parallel?

Subject: Public Perception


Chris says:
> i think it has *much* to do with the perception of raves being associated
> with psychedelic drugs.  

I too believe that drugs are *the* main concern.  Everybody here agrees that
raves don't exist for the sole purpose of doing drugs and that raves offer
something (besides drugs) that is missing from our day to day programmed
lives.

But, the public perception of drugs in general is bad.  They lump all drugs,
including the psychedelic group Leary referred to as A-M-M-M (Acid-Mescaline-
Mushrooms-Marijuana), with crack, heroine and other hardcore drugs.  Our
reaction here to Meth is analogous to Joe Public's reaction to all drugs
(except alcohol, of course).

There can be no denying what role psychedelic drugs have played in the
development of the rave community.  I'm not implying that everyone in the
community has been exposed to them, but many *have* and owe their new 
perceptions of reality, life and self to the insights gained through
indulgence.  

However, even Kesey said that we shouldn't just keep going through the door 
over and over, but that we should move beyond to the next step, using what
we've learned along the way.  I think that many in the rave community (if
typified by the feelings on this list) are doing this - or at least trying 
to.  There are still others though, who are just opening that door for the
first time - with or without psychedelics - and this will continue and
should if the community is to survive.

The crux of the issue is Joe Public's and the Establishment's perception of
psychedelics.  This perception is rooted in the '60's and was developed in
part by the most ominous control agency of them all: the CIA.  Once the
message that psychedelics "are real bad" was firmly implanted in the media,
it has spread throughout our society.  (I remember once having the perception
that Acid would actually melt parts of your brain causing it to ooze from 
your ears!)

I don't know, sometimes I get the impression that some of us on this list
want to deny or at least cover up the association of psychedelics with the
rave culture.  I can understand this however, given the stigma associated
with drugs.  We don't want to associate something perceived as 'bad' with
our beautiful community.  Even if we could convince the media that drugs
play no part in raves, what happens when they find out differently?

So what's the point?

Maybe just that we should be careful when trying to find solutions to the
problems we're currently facing.  We can't forget that there is, and
probably will continue to be, a connection between psychedelic drugs and
raves.  It seems that all that we can do is de-emphasize their importance.
Give merit to the rave community for what it is *really* all about.

I agree with Geoff White's comments:

But I think that this should be done independently from, but in parallel to,
the liberation of the rave scene.  No doubt they are dependent, but let's
not complicate the rave fight until we have to address that issue.

We can't forget how drugs are currently perceived in our society.  
This, I think, is the reason some of us would rather avoid media attention.
I too am worried about how the media will finally play their cards.  But one
thing is for certain: if nothing is done, they will continue on their
current negative path of destruction - how better to get the public's
attention than to play off their irrational fears?  

I also agree, to a point, with Mykyl's comments:

> My instincts tell me that "publicity is a bad tactic,
> while tact and virtual clandestinity are good tactics", as Bey suggests.
> Sometimes political pressure works best behind the scenes.

But, how long will the media onslougt continue?  Will they eventually become
bored (as they so often do) of the same old news and relegate it to the
dust bins?  Can we hold out until the initial blitzkrieg is over?  If we
look at the scope of the rave scene, how fast it seems to be growing all
across the country, then probably we will see no relief soon.

In addition, the younger (under 18) crowd probably poses the biggest threat.
Not from the ones attending the raves, but from concerned parents worried
about their child's exposure to drugs.  There is probably nothing more
formidable than a parent's protective instinct for their child.  When I was
in junior high school, the PTA put the local roller skating rink (OK so I'm
dating myself here!) out of business claiming it was a haven for cigarettes,
alcohol and marijuana.  Parents can assert tremendous pressure on local law
enforcement and governement to adopt policies to protect what they see as in
their and their child's best interest.  Politicians in turn use the war on
drugs as campaign bonus points to get elected.  (How else could a backwoods
hick like Traficant get elected to the Ohio State House of Reps?  He was the
sheriff instrumental in "exposing the local drug problem" by holding 
community meetings with concerned parents.)

I believe that we on the West Coast will fare much better, given the liberal
attitudes this state is famous for, much better than the rest of the
country.  However, care in dealing with these issues must be taken!

Peaceful Coexistance!  Our *Community*.  Do we really want to distance
ourselves as far away from society as we can?  If we do, people can think of
us what they will.

Doing things that strengthen this sense of community in the public's eye is
key to changing the perception of ravers as drug abusers who like music.

Yes, that is "strategic thinking", but without press coverage, who ever
finds out?  The Mayor's attitude will follow public sentiment and is thus
subject to change without notice - this is political survival.  However, if
the public also were informed of a 'raver' doing something to *strengthen*
community, they might start to view this culture differently.

rant,rant,babble,babble,babble...  I guess I've been storing up for a while!

Maybe we should all get together some afternoon and brainstorm about what
tactics could be pursued to change public perception in a favorable
direction.  A joint action committee of some sort.  This electronic forum is
good, but if we're really serious, face to face is the only way to proceed.

I understand your feelings.  In fact I went through the same thing just
recently - I haven't been to any event since mid-January.  I am planning on
going to Saturday's Come/Unity and GG Park on Sunday.  Hopefully, I can
recapture some of the same spirit I used to feel.

I think alot of it has to do with the mass commercialization of the events.
Whereas in the past it was mostly underground, recent attention has brought
in a host of new elements including some of the bad.  

Gang bangers will always be a problem amongst themselves and to others.  I
don't think anybody in the rave community can change that without
eliminating the problem entirely.  I was shocked by the tradgedy on Friday
night and feel deeply for those who were affected.  I can't help but feel
that maybe we will all end up loosing something very special because of a
few that can't understand.  All that I can say is that I hope we don't let
this happen - that we don't let ourselves be driven out and that we can
sustain, at least amongst ourselves, that which has been sown from the
scene.

across the country, then probably we will see no relief soon.

In addition, the younger (under 18) crowd probably poses the biggest threat.
Not from the ones attending the raves, but from concerned parents worried
about their child's exposure to drugs.  There is probably nothing more
formidable than a parent's protective instinct for their child.  When I was
in junior high school, the PTA put the local roller skating rink (OK so I'm
dating myself here!) out of business claiming it was a haven for cigarettes,
alcohol and marijuana.  Parents can assert tremendous pressure on local law
enforcement and governement to adopt policies to protect what they see as in
their and their child's best interest.  Politicians in turn use the war on
drugs as campaign bonus points to get elected.  (How else could a backwoods
hick like Traficant get elected to the Ohio State House of Reps?  He was the
sheriff instrumental in "exposing the local drug problem" by holding 
community meetings with concerned parents.)

I believe that we on the West Coast will fare much better, given the liberal
attitudes this state is famous for, much better than the rest of the
country.  However, care in dealing with these issues must be taken!

Peaceful Coexistance!  Our *Community*.  Do we really want to distance
ourselves as far away from society as we can?  If we do, people can think of
us what they will.

Doing things that strengthen this sense of community in the public's eye is
key to changing the perception of ravers as drug abusers who like music.

Yes, that is "strategic thinking", but without press coverage, who ever
finds out?  The Mayor's attitude will follow public sentiment and is thus
subject to change without notice - this is political survival.  However, if
the public also were informed of a 'raver' doing something to *strengthen*
community, they might start to view this culture differently.

rant,rant,babble,babble,babble...  I guess I've been storing up for a while!

Maybe we should all get together some afternoon and brainstorm about what
tactics could be pursued to change public perception in a favorable
direction.  A joint action committee of some sort.  This electronic forum is
good, but if we're really serious, face to face is the only way to proceed.

Are you referring to psychedelics or to other factors as well?  If so which
ones?  I'm not being critical, just analytical.

I think some of the other things that freaked Joe Public were communal 
living, dayglo everything, rock n' roll, spiritualism rooted in Eastern
philosophy and the basic 'drop out' attitude.

Remember that these things weren't all that popular or well known to the
Mr. and Mrs. Average American (especially to the scale that the hip movement
brought), but America *had* just witnessed the Beat generation. 

But, again, I think the BIG scare was the mass attraction to psychedelics.
The Beat Generation had psychedelics, but on the scale of the 60's.

Exactly.  So let's not only not forget the past, but try to understand it:

I think this is an excellent idea.  I've been lucky enough to have places to

the times I didn't - it was a *long* drive.  

In the same spirit, I'll offer a bean bag and blanket to anybody stuck in

I understand your feelings.  In fact I went through the same thing just
recently - I haven't been to any event since mid-January.  I am planning on
going to Saturday's Come/Unity and GG Park on Sunday.  Hopefully, I can
recapture some of the same spirit I used to feel.

I think alot of it has to do with the mass commercialization of the events.
Whereas in the past it was mostly underground, recent attention has brought
in a host of new elements including some of the bad.  

Gang bangers will always be a problem amongst themselves and to others.  I
don't think anybody in the rave community can change that without
eliminating the problem entirely.  I was shocked by the tradgedy on Friday
night and feel deeply for those who were affected.  I can't help but feel
that maybe we will all end up loosing something very special because of a
few that can't understand.  All that I can say is that I hope we don't let
this happen - that we don't let ourselves be driven out and that we can
sustain, at least amongst ourselves, that which has been sown from the
scene.

Subject: RE: Public Perception

What we're talking about here is still the right to manage one'e psyche in
whatever way one sees fit. So yes this establishes a parallel between the
sixties, the nineties, the fifties, early Greece and milions of other times.
and yes, in the current climate of drug hysteria this gains mucho bad press.
The fight however still needs to be waged. If our movement is gaining
popular support worldwide, then perhaps we will be the current crop best
suited to wage that battle.

While I don't usually like to couch my thinking in such conflict-based
verbage, I feel very strongly on this issue. My desired state of mind when
raving is one of ecstatic mindlessness. This is reachable via dance, people
and energy sometimes, other times not. I truly value the ability to get
there in a hurry if I want to. And a hit of E plus a hit of L does the job
remarkably well. 

The idea that we have to reach this space via some kind of inner purity of
sacrifice (that should be *or* sacrifice, meditation, fasting what have you
is jsut the legacy of earlier drug hysteria, prevalent dogmas etc.

I for one claim the psychedelic, ecstatic experience as my human birthright.
It connects me to the planet, to the people and to mu soul. Rave On, and Up
the Evolution.

Subject: Together was cool

Hi:


Last night was really cool, I got home at 9:30 after working out and my
girlfriend and Raving Nieghbor were waiting from me and said that they were
going to Together.  After much dottling we hooked up with 2 more friends and
went out. 

It was in the Big Heart City Basement and was jumpin at 12 when we got there.
The Basement had a really cool Chill Room with great visuals.  Simon and Garth
spun while I was there and both of their sets were excellent.  For awhile Garth
got into this Hip/Hop Rap set which didnt thrill me.

The place gets really hot because of the poor ventilation, so at 2:30 my
girlfriend and I went outside to get some air.  We noticed that the Marriot
Hotel was right across the street.  We strolled over walked around the hotel a
bit before going back to the club

All in All a good night

    I was wondering about this myself.  Most raves seem to take place
    in areas that I might not want to leave a car parked in all night.
    In any case I might not feel up for driving after being up all night.

    Taking public transit to a rave would mean I'd have no choice but
    to stay all night :^) but what if the rave gets closed early by
    the cops :^( ?

Here's an idea, put some of the proceeds into a lawyer fund. Perhaps
you could have a lawyer at your event to deal with the nice policemen.
Or better yet, a harassment suit could be in order.

Catch a ride with someone to the next party :-)

I'd guess that if you were in any kind of a dilemma that someone would
give you a ride back to civilization...  Most ravers are friendly folk
:-)

I sympathize, though... until recently I've been relying on public
transpo (including my 40-mile hellacommute to work).  I finally broke
down and bought my motorcycle.  [[ Now I can't believe I went 3 years
without one...I'd forgotten how much I love riding. ]]  

The point about not "feeling up to driving" (nudge nudge, wink wink ;)
is a good one, though...  Actually I think a location near one of the
Muni owl lines (like charter oak) would be a positive "selling point"
to put on rave flyers...

   So far, not much has been followed up on these plans, but we have planned
on maybe making a huge card, with a bunch of notes and signatures on it.  We plan
on setting up a table at the park on Sunday, and anybody that wants to show thier
support would have a chance by signing the card.  We (Mary, the promoter of the
party on friday) have also thought of maybe getting donations for Gabe's family's
expenses.  Although Gabe'
s family is not in desperate need of money, I feel that is the least we could do.
I am sure it wouldn't hurt.  Any other suggestions would be very helpful, since
my ability to be creative seems to have shut off recently.  
   I know we probably wont go far with donations, so I have been trying to think
of some other type of fund raising event.  I have been told that we could throw
another party with all of the money going to Gabe's family, but I REALLY dont think
another party would be the right way to do it.  I dont know, please give me as many
suggustions as you people can, alright?

stay happy all,

Jesus, Lee - it's just a party.  Most of us aren't daft enough to
think that we're evolving when we dance the night away.  

What does this have to do with the science of medicine, anyway?

hard to tell from a sample size of one, but i predict this kind of response
will not be uncommon.  happily, i think the situation can be helped by
thoughtful "marketing" of our ideas:

- represent ourselves as "celebrants" in addition to ravers

- represent our events as  "celebration rituals" (raves) lovingly engineered
  to maximize the likelihood of people having relevant direct personal
  experience that *does* contribute to their personal growth

- let people know that many of us do have serious intent that goes beyond
  mere partying, possibly entering the realms of spiritual/religious
  discovery.  our serious intent has strong historical basis (the power
  of rhythm in shamanism, the importance of direct personal experience
  in zen, etc.)

- we do this and have amazing, joyous FUN at the same time!
  
dare to dream of where this can lead....   what we do is so much fun,
more people around the world will continue to join us, as celebrants,
and as fellow engineers evolving our rituals.  the vibe will spread.
we carry our growing insights and expanded consciousness with us throughout
the week - home, family, school, community, our jobs, government.
i like to think of what evolves as The Rhythm Society.

is it only a dream?

I think the best idea yet is what Vision is doing.  Hire off-duty cops for
security.  I'd pay an off-duty nicely to watch the door, especially when his
buddies show up.  "Hi Joe, what's up?"  "Aww, just some kids having a little
dance."  "Oh, OK, see you at the donut shop!"  It would almost be an insult
for the cops to break up a rave that was watched by their cohorts.

Hi Folks!

Finally a break from the grind.

Questions:

1.  South Bay Lunch...is this still happening on Thursday, 12pm, 
    Greer Park, Palo Alto?  IF so, I prolly can't make it :(  
    but would someone please post directions anyways...

2.  If you work, do you work in a raver-friendly environment?

    My workplace is downright hostile, or at least overly judgmental.
    Recently, I have been imagining how nice it would be to walk into
    work Monday morning, make that Monday afternoon, and openly tell
    someone how my weekend was...I *hate* having to hide the most
    fulfilling side of my life 8 hours a day. 

    Anyways, this all leads to question #3.

3.  Anyone have any ideas for a start-up?  This is a serious question.
    There must be loads of just brilliant people tied into the scene.
    Is it not conceivable that a bunch of us could get together and
    start a company with a positive vibe?  (Hmmmm, maybe this would 
    make a good SciFi/Fan story)--how is this movement going to change 
    things in mainstream America anyways?  Sure, dance music has been 
    revolutionized, but how far/how long will the message travel?  
   

Well, I am just full of questions today.

***
An interesting experience (maybe):

I went to Gravity Trip @ The Stone on Saturday.  I was really tired, and
not on anything; my friends however....  Anyways, the place was pretty
dead, and all of a sudden I realized that I was *bored* out of my mind
and dancing was doing nothing for me.  A first.  So, I lied down in the
corner, and thought and thought, and somehow I came to the conclusion
that I was wasting my time/energy and that the scene was not for me.  Woah.
It was too intense a feeling, and I've had it before.   What to do?
So, I'm lying down on this smelly carpet, and from nowhere, I feel a 
shiver-inducing, invisible wave come sweeping over me...and with it, 
an answer.  

This, folks, was a revelation--the most intense, focussed, personal, 
spontaneous moment of self-discovery I have ever experienced.  Blew me away.
***

Anyways, back to the grind.   BTW, I am trying really hard to keep 
from getting over-excited thinking about the weekend, but I am 
totally psyched and completely committed--can't wait to see you all!


Until then, keep it Flavor-full.

Ravi

For some reason I like these... a lot.  It gets across the point that
raves are/can be (if you want) more than just mindless parties, without
delving into (IMNSHO) a bunch of new-age-like doodoo.  It also alludes
to a community artificially created in which an individual can benefit
personally and directly by participating, instead of only
strengthening the movement itself.  If that can be presented as a goal
of raving, then it may help defuse the apprehension of large underground
hedonistic movements pooped by the media upon mainstream america.
This is yet another reason, if raves ever want good PR, to move away
from the hippie image.

Then again, I'm in total agreement with what Hakim Bey thinks about
trying to use the media... So screw PR.  :-)

Why?  Who will get this information, and what will they do with it?
I don't mean to be overly paranoid, but I'd like to know the point of this.
If its' a demographic study, its customary to allow for confidentiality,

Dear Poster,

     This message was greatly needed!  I hope that no one thinks that your post
is from someone who has been zoomin' a bit too long on whatever.  I definitely
use raving as described by you and Lee.

" let people know that many of us do have serious intent that goes beyond
  mere partying, possibly entering the realms of spiritual/religious
  discovery.  our serious intent has strong historical basis (the power
  of rhythm in shamanism, the importance of direct personal experience

"It is my belief that the activities associated with raving represent a
methodology by which many of us, despite having come from very diverse
backgrounds, are able to attain shared states of consciousness that may point
to a future direction for the evolution of human existence." 

     One should ponder these quotes and keep them in mind this weekend.  This
could all be a bunch of mumbo-jumbo, but then again it could be "The wave of
the Future".

Keep it Alive and Thrive,                               T. Scot

Jesus, Lee - it's just a party.  Most of us aren't daft enough to
think that we're evolving when we dance the night away.  

What does this have to do with the science of medicine, anyway?

-sue
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

hard to tell from a sample size of one, but i predict this kind of response
will not be uncommon.  happily, i think the situation can be helped by
thoughtful "marketing" of our ideas:

- represent ourselves as "celebrants" in addition to ravers

- represent our events as  "celebration rituals" (raves) lovingly engineered
  to maximize the likelihood of people having relevant direct personal
  experience that *does* contribute to their personal growth

- let people know that many of us do have serious intent that goes beyond
  mere partying, possibly entering the realms of spiritual/religious
  discovery.  our serious intent has strong historical basis (the power
  of rhythm in shamanism, the importance of direct personal experience
  in zen, etc.)

- we do this and have amazing, joyous FUN at the same time!
  
dare to dream of where this can lead....   what we do is so much fun,
more people around the world will continue to join us, as celebrants,
and as fellow engineers evolving our rituals.  the vibe will spread.
we carry our growing insights and expanded consciousness with us throughout
the week - home, family, school, community, our jobs, government.
i like to think of what evolves as The Rhythm Society.

is it only a dream?

Not necessarily, at the full moon before last, I Tranced the hardest and

any substances.  I'm NOT against the use of these drugs but I is possible

we "represent" to a lot of people, not just the media:  each other, our  
friends, initiates, and so on.  if in discussions about our rituals we  
include the discovery/creation/spiritual/social aspects as well as the party  
side, we sensitize all listeners to broader possibilities.  perhaps sooner  
rather than later they will see more than "it's just a party".

maybe it's best not to try to "use" the media (i don't think that's a simple  
question), but we can't hide from it either - witness the "48 Hours" TV  
episode among many.  the more visible we make our spiritual side, the more we  
can hope that at least some media reps will report a more complete picture,  
not just the party.

finally, i believe there will come a time when our legislative and legal  
systems will re-examine the use of psychedelics.  (as randy tinkerman has  
mentioned, various groups have tried to claim legal use of certain chemicals  
as religious sacraments, and mainly failed.)  to be successful, we'll need a  
more receptive socio-political climate (which seems to be coming, and which  
we're helping to create!) and we'll need to demonstrate a history of serious  
spiritual/religious practice.  i'm not sure that the words "rave" or "house  
movement" really convey that to most people now - yet i for one have derived  
more spiritual growth and fulfillment from it than from any other ritual  
experience in my life (e.g. the organized religion my family practiced).

i like the notion of The Rhythm Society to convey the breadth and depth many  
of us feel in the scene - with rave as our sacred, joyous celebration ritual.

[Back to the 60's]

This same thing happened in the sixties and was one of the main reasons LSD
was made illegal.  Leary and his League of Spiritual Discovery wanted to
focus on the "religious" aspects of expanded conciousness.  He went as far
as to legally apply for religious status in N.Y.  They wanted to use
Marijuana and LSD as sacraments in attaining higher levels of consciousness.
Leary always believed in guided trips with trained guides and lobbied in
Congress for legalization.

At this same time, the drug culture was in full swing.  Students across the
country were turning on.  The West Coast became the center for most of this
activity.  There were various groups devoted to holding Acid Tests, Love
Ins, Concerts, etc. in celebration.  The most famous of which were the Merry
Pranksters (led by Ken Kesey) who took a long bus trip (pun intended)
cross country - basically one long wired out party.  They ended up at 
Millbrook where the League of Spiritual Discovery was then based.  Their
reaction was exactly the same as the one above: they viewed the whole 
Millbrook scene as "constipated".  


[More Party Attitude]

Just recently, I saw another post talking about Leary.  It said basically
the same thing:

> He's right.  During the 60's, when everyone else was having fun, Leary
> was trying to look like some kind of big shot by pretending the events
> of the time (the drug culture) actually had substance.  He was a pretentious
> paranoid goober.

> Perhaps the best account of the era was by Tom Wolf in "The Electric
> Kool-Aid Acid Test".   While most fun-loving people were out having 
> a good time (like Ken Kesey), Leary was, I don't know, like the
> drunk at the party who has cornered you into a serious conversation. 

Leary believed it was this party attitude that was the eventual reason LSD
was made illegal.  As more and more people turned on, the media started to 
pick up on all the negative aspects of LSD.  They would run stories of
college students eating bark off of trees and of LSD related deaths.
Even though the percentage of these incidents were but a mere fraction of
alcohol related incidents.  


[Back to the Future]

Now it wouldn't be too hard to draw parallels between the situation then 
and the situation now.  Sure we're not pushing for legalization of LSD, just
our right to dance and practice our form of spiritualism.  But, remember -
LSD was at that time, like dancing is now, legal.

OK, so it will be easier to fight for dancing than for the use of a
extremely psychoactive and unpredictable drug.  But, the media is also
emphasizing the connection of LSD to raves.  And whenever you start talking
of spiritualsim and expanded consciousness, even if it doesn't bring 
thoughts of drugs to Joe Public's mind, it does sound abstract or just plain
weird to Mr. & Mrs. Christian American.  Recent events involving religious 
cults also add stigma to the spiritualism front.  


[Almost Done]

I really don't want to sound negative, I just think we should again learn
from the past.  Learn from how the media and public reacted to the unfolding
of expanded consciousness, spiritualism and the celebration of these
concepts.  We face the same types of problems stemming from fear, ignorance
and refusal to accept a reality that is separate from a droll day to day
existance.  Some people just won't change - no matter how much you try to
educate them.

> is it only a dream?

Yes, but without dreams, Human spirit would stagnate and die.  We have to
fight for our dreams!  The thing that we do have going for us is alot of
positive vibe.  Let's use it and thrive.

	in grades K-12 mostly specializing in grades 7 - 12.  The report

	report was very concerned about the rise in LSD use and seemed to

hard to say if there will be a backlash, or how strong it will be.  in any  
event, how does one prepare for such a thing?  how would a "movement" prepare  
for such a thing?  here's one take:

1.  be careful - stay clean

2.  encourage people who use psychedelics to use responsibly, in moderation,
    and as part of a planned ritual (whether private or group).

3.  we *need* articulate spokespersons.  *lots* of them.  be part of the 

    public re-education effort!  spread the word that drug use is not a
    simple all-or-nothing question - not all drugs are deleterious; some 

    people derive great benefit from responsible use of some drugs; at stake 

    is religious freedom - control of one's own consciousness.  you can say 

    these things without using drugs, or admitting use.

4.  more people who actually use (or have used) psychedelics will have to
    "come out of the [psychedelic] closet"  and speak firsthand to debunk
    the drug myths, and talk about what they have gained.

    (anybody remember Stuart Reges, the stanford CS faculty member who went
     on record a few years back?  he ultimately lost his job at stanford, but
     has not been prosecuted.  i think he's now an officer of the Libertarian
     Party.  he'll be in the bay area this weekend.)

i see such a strong parallel between society's efforts to put down drugs and  
its efforts to put down gay people that it makes me dizzy.  we can learn from  
this.  for the long period of time during which gay people reacted to  
oppression by going further underground - acting straighter than ever - the  
oppression continued.   with visibility - outness - comes strength.

i see the public debate about gays in the military as hugely beneficial.  as  
one small example, there was an article (page one, plus a *full page* inside)  
in the Wall Street Journal on 4/12 about a gay Army lawyer who came out, and  
is now an activist.  i though it was balanced and sympathetic.  gay-positive  
WSJ coverage!  (as an opressed, closeted gay kid i was completely unable to  
imagine anything like this ever happening.)

can you imagine the WSJ devoting more than a full page of coverage to a  
balanced and sympathetic article about a New Consciousness developing across  
the world?   the emergence of a joyous religious practice that encourages  
people to discover their inner wisdom, tap it, and apply it to individual,  
community, and society?

when the inevitable revolution in consciousness occurs, it *will* have an  
impact on *everything*, including business, and the WSJ (if it's around then)  
*will* cover it.   we can make it happen sooner rather than later.

I've never been to a real rave(just the kind that are somewhat regulated) and
would like to know if there's a real underground rave breaking on the 
horizon.   I hear you haven't been to a real rave unless sexual orgies are
occuring thruout the dance floor and thruout the premises.   Sounds like a
world to be explored.   I've been to a few dozen half-raves but it's my
intention to frequent a real rave.    I hear that on the 24th of this month
there's a rave in s.f. and they'll be having a simultaneous broadcast of a
rave going on in Boston.   Should be pretty happening.   well...if you hear
of a good totally underground orgy fest, let me know!

Actually, I've been noticing a more neutral stance on the part of the media
about "the spectre of drugs" - more and more articles mentioning the ridiculous
costs of the War on (Some) Drugs, and the obvious failure of the war to have
any lasting effects on reducing usage in the population as a whole.  If any
of you thought the 48 Hours episode could have been shown 4 years ago,  you're
crazy :)  I think more and more people are opening their eyes to what's going
on, and this can only be a good thing.

I think the President could be doing more; his proposed budget is simply a
continuation of Reagan/Bush priorities ($2 of "intervention" for every $1 of
treatment)...

used when bargaining with officials about getting permits, etc.
They are very good examples of our plight and position...

Hello Geoff! Here is Ina after 4 weeks ore more. Sorry for your waiting, but i
got always problems with the e.mail stuff at the Mac Intosh; sometimes it's
not connected with the uni-net, sometimes I forgot some steps how to use it...
But here am I. Today I'm writing from my Silicon Graphics account, please send
your next messages to here.
So, now is following a little Techno Guide through Europe. What kind of Techno
they are listening and raving at different places?
           
       Cologne: Acid, Detroit Minimalism, Break Beat (UK Techno), Rotterdam Rec.


       Berlin: Belgium Techno, Italian Techno (Ramirez), lesser Techno



       Frankfurt: Trance Techno, Hard House
    



       Hamburg: House with Techno-Bits




       Rotterdam: Heavy Techno - chainsaw "Gabber House" (Euromaster EP)




       Amsterdam: House, Minimalistics (DJAX UP BEATS), Traditional Acid



These informations are from Riley ore "Triple R", he is a DJ from Cosmic
Orgasm, a DJ- &Party union here at Cologne. There is a tape for you in
preparation with actually listened Techno.
In to weeks I want to go to Latvia, espacially to Riga. On May the first there
will be "The biggest russian rave ever". These DJ's are often mixing with old
audio reels, because they can't get the new records and they don't have the
special players for it. I'm very interested in what's going on there.
2 months ago I went to Prag, there is also a growing szene.
So, Geoff, you have to know, I come from East Germany, the last 5 years I
studied fashion design in Halle (this is near Leipzig). We had a really good
Techno time there; the movement was much more closed to the living conditions,
you know, after the unifikation all things were changing. We had nice old
factories and bunkers (of course illegal) & great parties. 
Here in west it's more like a trend. The speed is actually by 170 bpm. So, 
I think it's enough for today. Please, send me your adress, than I can send
you the tapes. I hope, you could understand my English. 
                    

                                       Put your hands in the air

Ha ha ha.  Boy, I tell you, I almost missed the sarcasm in this
post.  Sure am glad that people have _long_ ago seen through the
absurd idea of raves as orgies.

Yeah, multi-media is getting alot of attention.  There will be alot of
really big players, though.  Ideally, you need something with little or no

	Before I begin, I want you all to say thanks to Derek Chung for 
helping pull this together each week.  He submits at least half, and sometimes
all, of the new flyers each week.  Since I can't make it to Haight or out
to events every week he's a true lifesaver :)

	Friday night I'm off to Santa Cruz for the Island Group/MAPS 
Bicycle Day conference, and returning to go to Sunrise... hopefully
Onionz won't have played before I hear him, coz he'd be half the reason
I'm going.  The other half would be to hear Dutch and Carlos, two people
I haven't heard in the longest time... 

	Saturday night, you have ONLY ONE option - Come/Unity.  I can't
tell you how amazing the whole process of bringing all the SF promoters
together and having this event has been; the unity and selflessness has
shown there is definite hope that our scene won't be plagued by the same
sorts of troubles scenes in other cities have.  So definitely, definitely,
come out for this one.  There will be a very special ceremony for Mal at
3am, but come EARLY, as it will almost definitely oversell.  The doors
open at 9pm (and I'll be there, taking tix from 9 to 11, so say hi!)

	Sunday - The Marx Meadow party in GG Park *WILL* be happening.

There's a book by Gabrielle Roth called, "Maps To Ecstasy, teachings of an
urban shaman".  

She believes in the power of ecstatic dance to allow one to reach "the five
sacred powers natural and necessary for survival - the power of being 
[freeing the body], the power of loving [expressing the heart], the power of 
knowing [emptying the mind], the power of seeing [awakening the soul], the
power of healing [embodying the spirit]".

I have yet to get too far past the prologue, but so far I can't disagree
with anything she has said - good food for thought.  I'll post again after I
finish the book.  Has anybody else heard of or read this book?

 ... some supplementary information - Interviews with G. Roth , Mickey Hart ,
Arthur Hull , and other mystic/shamanistic drummers are in the Sekhmet issue 
#6 of TANTRA magazine. The issue is also full of ads for music by a few of
these people , especially G. Roth. I bought the mag at Printer's Inc. in
Palo Alto last Friday.

 I haven't heard any of her stuff yet , but there's a store in Menlo Park
that's sure to have her music. I'm going to buy some CD's myself , on the
strength of the interview.

 Some quotes:
  < (her) personal challenge is to musically map her journey to and from 
altered states of consciousness so she may bring others with her >

 "I'm not a musician , I'm a dancer. I didn't know the musical language. 
I knew the soul, not the intellect"

 < At the start of the creative process Gabrielle dances and her husband ...
creates the first drumbeat that will serve as the base rhythm for the piece.
This emphasis on the bottom, and the syncopated spaces between the beats,
helps create the trance-like quality that is such a hallmark of her work.>

 < A direct experience of pure energy is the very center point of Gabrielle
Roth's work. She feels because we have so much stress in modern life, that we 
need a dynamic form of meditation. Her favorite Osho quote is , "Dance until 
the dancer dissappears and only the dancer remains". ... (she) says of her
work "It's Zen because it's focused on the moment. It's Tantra because it 
includes the whole self, both dark and light. It's Shamanic because, among 
other things, its goal is the ecstatic merger of spirit and flesh" >


-----------------------------------------------------------------

( I wonder what her reaction would be to a few raves? )

( Do any of you DJ's out there know about her music? Have you already been 
  putting her in the mix? :-)  [ kinda tough w/ cassettes/CDs ] )

Subject: Raving/Partying as public policy

 
I have read every post concerning making  raves/parties a bit easier to
obtain permits for.  As for the GG Park thang, I do not think that it
is an issue.  The REAL issue is parties being broken up because of the
cabaret laws of this city. 
 
I think that instead of starting a fight bringing in lawyers and other
weaponry a SOLUTION should be offered to the city.  The city's first
concern is liability which costs the city MILLIONS each year.  
The next is safety. The next is revenue.  I have one possible solution
in mind.
 
I think the approach should be to attack each one of the issues head on.
First the city should provide a one-night cabaret license for $750.  
This license would do the following:
 
- The licensee would assume all responsibility for the patrons of the
event.The licensee in effect would assume all liability for damages or 
personal injury which occured at the event.
 
- Part of this license fee would go towards an inspection of established
Minimal Cabaret Safety Standard.  This would provide that the fire
marshall make an  inspection of the location to determine if the place
has two accessible exits, two  fire extinguishers,and the building is 
not condemned.  The electrical system should  be checked for minimum
safety as well.
 
- This license would allow partons 18 years and older to enter, but
there will be no alcohol served. No exceptions.
 
- The premesis of the event MUST be guarded by a certified and bonded
security agency or off-duty policemen.  This discourages things like
Watsonville from happening and the NUMEROUS fights that are breaking
out at parties (the Wicked before last had one, and most recently
Vision had one).
 
I think that if any of the promoters find these rule too restictive then
their motives must be questioned, since these rules are designed to 
generate rev. for the city, make sure that the public is protected, and 
makes sure that the promoter is responsible FOR EACH PERSON THEY ALLOW
INTO THEIR EVENT.
 
As for the pursuance of a 14-21 license...IMHO, drop it!  There is too
much shit going on to allow Teenies into a party, and the LAST thing
you want is some parent getting pissed off and organized.  People who 
are 18 can BARELY handle the scene now.  Young women without tops 
(just look CLOSER at VISION next time, there is a girl who shows
off complete frontal nudity...at a RAVE?),  no bras, breast showing, 
teamed up with guys on E or meth & Testosterone along with inexperience
with drugs, is a prime mixure for rape.  We don't need any more
young people under the age of 18 getting hurt.  In this country at the
age of 18 you are legally responsible for your actions, I do not see
any purpose in lowering it further.
 
 
After the 17th I will have more to say, but until then I plan on
attending the massive party at Come-Unity (it's the LEAST I could do
seeing that my party was mentioned on the flyer).  Hope to see you
there....and oh yeah, $20 is too much to pay for a rave, PERIOD!  
I hope this trend stops soon!

I am having a party this Saturday, April 17 starting at 9pm.  It is a
theme party, the "Pretentious Art Party," so all participants must show up
in their most pretentious attire.

THis might be a good pre-party for all you East Bay SFRavers, before
you go to Come-Unity or whatever.  And, yes, there is a rave angle on
this:  I will have on display some of the dayglo posters created at
Alternity (on display in a specially created "blacklight room.")


My address is:  5258 Claremont Avenue, near 51st street and Telegraph

I'm sorry, but this is bullshit.  Age has little or no bearing on
people being able to "handle" the "scene".  It's not as if a rave is
a highly stressful event filled with life or death decisions...
It's a damn party! What would you rather have 18- people do?  

Has ANYONE ever been raped at a rave?  I'm not saying it hasn't
happened, but I haven't heard about it.  Even if someone has, are you
trying to say it was their fault because they were 18 or younger and
dressed provocatively?  Because claiming minors or their attire (or
lack thereof) as the problem does just that...

The problem would be with the assholes who committed the crime, not the
victim.

Have you met any of the SFRavers who are under 18?  Do you feel they
can barely handle the scene?

Do you think, say, 21+ people hanging in Johnny Love's would be better
for the scene than, say, Leah?

Sorry for the generalizations, and the tone, but age discrimination
has always pissed me off.

In my experience, good crowds are better at breaking up fights than
security people.  What you are proposing sounds like everything I am
trying to get away from when I go to an event.

I don't want a promoter responsible for me.  I am responsible for myself,
and you are responsible for yourself.  The government uses this excuse to
say "We're responsible for you, and what you want to do could possibly
be dangerous.  Therefore we won't let you do it, and will impose 
consequences that are probably worse than whatever could have happened
to you anyway."

Oh, PLEASE.  You're sounding like your parents.  I'd rather have young
people at a rave than older people: they're less likely to cause fights
and get slobbering-drunk-in-your-face.  The beat is for EVERYONE.  Why
do you want to exclude the people who are in their most fertile
learning years?

Some of the coolest people I've seen at events have been "teenies".

"Protection" is the excuse the government always uses to deprive you and

late at night is DANGEROUS.  That evil music causes you to go into a

No age restrictions for Come/Unity.  The only restriction that may
happen is if you arrive late, as the place (Richmond Auditorium) can

I discovered Gabrielle Roth when I was a subscriber to the 4AD e-mail list;
someone described her music as a cross between Peter Gabriel (Passion) and 
This Mortal Coil.  I picked up two of her CD's, _Ritual_ and _Bones_, and
I have to say that hardly a week goes by where I don't listen to them,
almost two years later.  Her music is intensely deep, mysterious, spiritual,
sensuous and beautiful -- the ultimate ambient/chill music IMHO.  Lots
of trance/tribal percussion, flutes, violins, and ambient synth.  Her tempi
are slower and more hypnotic than most ambient house/techno.  Another
point of reference would be the composer Jon Hassell, although I find Roth's
music more meditative and moving.

Her CD's and tapes are found in the New Age bins, which I think is misleading 
and somewhat insulting, but I guess her music defies categorization.  I'd
relate her music as much to World Beat as New Age, although it's very
non-specific geographically and historically.

The first time I went to a rave, I remember standing in line feeling very
old a the tender age of 25. On my way out that morning, I was thinking:
Right Fucking On! I wish this was an option when I was 16.

But rather than there being a peaceful, supportive, positive scene to
surround me while I learned life's hardest lessons there were simply no
options so me and my friends learning by example filled our veins with all
manner of horrid substances and grew slowly cynical, dying a little
everyday.

If there is a problem, it is not with people of a given age, but rather with
people of a given attitude. That promoters of all people are advocating
caving in to the path of least resistance and thereby assuring themselves
easy profits rather than making a stand for the scene in all its possible
manifestations attem,pting to secure its benefits to the widest cross
section of people deeply in need of said benefits is, IMHO, very sad.

Sorely missing from our society are initiatory rituals that instruct young
people in how to relate to each other, the world, the planet. In their
absence, testosterone poisoning (thanks xoc) reigns supreme. 

Sanitizing, lobotomizing and otherwise trashing our scene just so it will
fit nicely within the established borders of a fucked system is missing the
point entirely. the difference between 21+ clubs full of drunks and 21+
clubs filled with people on everything but alcohol will soon be a negligible
difference indeed.

Open the doors and let the energy flow.

Chances are, unless your town was even more backwards than Salt Lake (not
likely), it was an option when you were 16.  The music was different though

Yes Marx Meadows is at 25th ave and Fulton. You could park there and then
walk into the park and veer right down the hill through the trees and into
Marx Meadows.

You've lost me here. As you enter the park on what street? If you mean 25th
this might work (I have no idea). But from westbound Fulton this would
require an illeagal left turn.

If this is all to confusing just park at 25th and Fulton and walk into the

this is actually basically right at 25th Ave

	unfortunate word choice !!! )

THIS IS NOT QUITE IT:

come into the park on 19th, then bear left at the fork, which is
25th Ave.  Park on 25th before it leaves the park.  Marx Meadows is 
on the other side of the woods on the soutwest side of 25th. You'll
hear the bass!!  But anyway, you'll be in GG Park on Bicycle day!

oh, is this so?  thanks for telling me that I can't handle the
scene.  do you think you could give me some pointers?  I guess since
I'm only 17 (but gosh, soon to be 18) I can't understand the vibe,
the community, the music, the people, the energy  *sigh* my mental 
capacity is enough to handle making important, life-altering decisions, 
but its not capable of handling staying out all night being with people I
care about, listening to music I love, and being happy.  I knew I should
have stuck to hanging out in malls.  call the folks!  I'm going
back to the farm!

(flame mostly off)  please, if you are going to make generalizations,
do it with a little more thought.  I am aware that many under 18ers
are not mature, and are not really into the scene.  but don't assume
that because the person next to you can't vote or buy a beer, she/he
is automatically a "Teenie".  it's called stereotyping, and it's just
plain stupid.

anyone have any suggestions?

Dear SF Ravers:

First off, we at Island Universe would like to thank you just for being on
our mailing list.  We also hope that you've enjoyed our past events to their
fullest - that's what they're for.

As you may well know by now, the next Island Universe creation, Trance in
Space is happening on 4/23/93.  Since you are on the list, your job is to
spread the word - so here are the details:

Locat
ion... SF Sound Factory - the back room, entrance "in the back" closest to
the Essex St.
 ramp.

DJ's are Special K, Michael Manahan.  Also please welcome the vacationing DJ
Ben Krolick fro
m Brighton, England.  He's been a mainstay for the Zap and Escape clubs and
we're just plain excited to have him with us.

Tropical Space ambiance provided by Synergy Visual Projections - these guys
are innovative and very in touch with our vibe.

And it all starts at 2:00 am and will continue until morning.

Cover will be between 5 and 10 dollars (depending on our final negotiations
with the Sound Factory).

Remember that Island Universe is the only place to hear the latest, produced
in the SF loft, super trancy, ultra trippy, saturated with bass (not fish),
Trip n' Spin recordings.  Oh yes, the record is out
, "Island Universe - Musical Satellite" and is quite liked by lots of DJ
types already, 
so don't be surprised if you hear the stuff when you go out.  Just remember,
only we have the DATs a
nd only we've got The G ("I am a Cybernaut").  

 We now also have a phone line up for up-to-the-minute updates.  Please call 
(415) 979-6807 before you set out to join us on Friday in case anything comes
up.
Or just call to let us know who you are.

Handshakes and Hugs,


ISLAND UNIVERSE

FYI for those who care, "Timothy Leary sends his regrets that he will not
appear either in Santa Cruz or San Francisco", but if you're going to
either planned event, they will have a consolation video and written
message of/by Tim. (this latest info from MAPS) So Tim probably
won't be at Marx either. (But ya never know...)

Wow- Many of you really got pissed off at my post...GOOD!

The FACT is all of this talk about changing attitudes is fine AND welcome,
but UNTIL things change it is best to get as many included in this movement
as possible.  Therefore my tack was to approach the issue from an 18+
perpspective.  If you people even THINK that a parent would allow his/her
child to attend one of these functions, with the current hysteria (sorry for
use of a word that is NON PC) over ex use then you are sadly mistaken.
Check out the scene in LA.  What I would like to do is get people 18+ access
to the scene.  It is MUCH to difficult to get those under 18 in due to
CURRENT laws.  I was NOT debating the validity of such laws, I will leave
that to lawyers and judges, and other activists among you.  Fact is 18-- do
NOT have the right to vote, much less are listened to by the general public.
 In TIME this will change, and as far as I am concerned the sooner the
better.  But for now things can be made to change drastically at least for
those 18+.  I think it is BULLSHIT that 18+ are sent home at 2:30.  I think
that it's bullshit that 18+ are accorded all the rights of being an adult
but none of the responsibility.

No I have not met any of the 18-- SFRAVERS.  I doubt that I would meet them
in any of the clubs I go to since ALL of them are 18+.  Maybe at a more
informal gathering, but not a a club.  Unfortiunate though it is this is the
CURRENT reality.  MAybe in time it will change, but I would rather chip away
at the edges of society's lame rules than to just bulldoze them over.  All
actions must be weighed fotr thier consequences.

As for fights...girls w/o tops...problems...OPEN YOUR eyes...problems are
occuring now!  I was not saying that it is their fault so lay off.  I am
saying that AT TIMES the atmosphere is charged, and the more you can do to
make people comfortable then the better. I am not blaming the woman but I do
want to protect everyone from fools who are starting to ruin this scene.
Ignore this fact and this "scene" will be over before it really gets a
chance to blast off!

It's still the 17th...lighten up, have a good night. And to those 18-- who
can't get in tonite maybe something can be done in the future.  Maybe
someone can champion the cause. I will work on the 18+ issue since it is
something that means quite a bit to me.

good Luck.

Uh, the key word is parents...maybe you've heard of NIGHTMARE in LA....here
let me give you some info.  A group of LA parents overreacting to their 18
 and 17 year old dancing all night and taking e.  It means NIGHT Mothers
Against Raves and Ecstacy!  They have been quite effective at shutting down
most all of the UG (undegrounds) in LA that EVERYONE would frequent.  Now
the ONLY clubs that are happening it seems (aside from the fewer number of
UG's) are 18+.  So much for the YOUTH.  Now they got very few places to go.
Why? Beacuse:i strongly believe that it is a parents

Uh, no...THAT was not what I said (re-read post please).  It said that there
are many 18+'s
(since I have never been to anything other than FMM that had teens in it)
who act this way.  It is NOT to imply that those 18-- would be worse, but
WHY, due to your MINOR status in society, risk it?  I mean if YOU and OTHERS
fell so strongly, as well you should since I know I was pissed when I had
little legal standing. then change the laws so that you can vote.  Then
participate by voting, change the laws, organize, get it all together...then
change your status or have laws legislated as such!  I am all for that!

But let me tell you this...as I said in my post it is not REALLY the problem
of the teens, it is a problem of society (If you read the post you would
clearly see that).  I said that the PARENTS would have a fit and get
organized.  And that is ALL that is needed to ruin this scene...If they
wanna stop it, they well may be able to, at least the above ground events!
And I am not talking about some rural bumfuck who hates ravers and raves.  I
am talking about any concerened parent who doesnot understand what this is
all about, and any parent who is anti-drug (to the extreme, since there are
many).  This is the true danger...18-- only provide a catalyst for this
danger to become real and fuck up an otherwise OK scene.

(Note: An 18-- can get an Adult BBS shut down by peering at pics...now THAT
is dangerous).

As for I am sounding like my parents, you really wouldn't know what my
parents sounded like.  They are quite reasonable human beings, not
reactionary like you tend to find these days (Just Say No was not mentioned
in my house and THC was frequently smoked in private by them).

Oh yeah, I AM A PARENT.  My chils will be raised around some of the most
crackin' on people on this scene today so please stop your alarmist talk.
All is fine and well on this homefront.  But I would be concerned i they
were 14 and Crakin on.  I will probably dose with him once he turns 17 or 18
but we'll see.  By that time synthetics will be the thing of the past.
Jackin' in will be the one!

So although many of you may have been hurt, and even mistook my statements
as a call to NOT get 18-- involved, but I am DIRECTING my energies toward
getting people who are 18+ and currently legal adults in this society
permanently into the scene without being harassed by illogical rules which
should not, due to their ADULT status, be applied to them.

The other battles are for other warriors.  I wish them good luck, and a good
fight.

Peace....it's the 17th...go out, chill out.

Did you only do things your parent's allowed you to do before you
turned 18?  Do you believe teenagers should be slaves to their
parents moral judgements?

Easily accomplished, since they already do have access to the scene.

This is the first time I've heard a judge called an activist.  Are you
a cop?

So they should de facto be excluded from positive activities.  I
disagree.

I agree 100%.  This isn't a reason to exlude 18-- people, though.

Net effect:  You reject the way society handles these issues.  You
feel they should be changed.  You want to make these rules go away.  

Why not just reject them outright and achieve the same?  Do you feel
it may not be worth the possible consequences?  Then why do you care
at all?

Thank you very much for your advise, but I will choose my own battles and
focus my attention to where I think I can make the most impact.  If YOU want
to change current laws for those who I have so excluded then it is within
your right to do so...Maybe that can be your battle, but it will not be
mine.  Things that are not focused tend to be misdirected.  I would rahter
get 18+ in permanenetly without being sent home.  After that, who knows...

Hi, John.

While your statement might be true as a generalization, I've actually
met young ravers whose parents are totally cool about what's going on,
especially kids who grew up in Berkeley or Marin/Sonoma.  There are
quite a few parents who spearheaded the various liberation movements of
the 60's, and not all of them became reactionary yuppies over the years.

In fact, I know of at least one such parent here on the list...

I'll grant you that parents of college age ravers might tend to be a bit more
permissive than those of high-school students.  But let's take a straw
poll.  You parents out there; how old would you want your kid to be before
attending a rave (with or without your supervision)?  How would you justify
that decision with respect to your own experience as a teenager?

Hi Mike!, a voice of reason in the storm....

I am NOT concerned about those parents who are OK with what is going on.  I
am worried about those who have NO IDEA what's going on.  They do exists,
and PROBABLY in much greater numbers than those who are a bit more
permissive about their childs behaviour.  What about the burbs' of Concord,
and other places here in the Bay Area that have a more conservative bent.
One parent's idea of OK tends to be different than another parents idea of
OK.  Your poll is a good idea.

Maybe we can publish it in SFWeekly or Guardian :) (just kidding).

But to diffuse this bomb:  Let's keep this a non heated discussion.  I
originally talked about the idea of a different kind of cabaret permit to
allow people 18-20 the right to stay in a club past 2:30 without food being
served (a special clause provides that if food is served then they can stay,
since the category changes from being cabaret to something else....I do not
know WHAT exactly but it does change!).  If you have OTHER ideas about
different permits why not voice them. And voice a means of implementation
and how it can be sold to the city/ state govt.'s!

As for my personal ideas on the scene and teens (I know you ALL hate that
word, but 1st amendment and all....;) I would like to continue as the
subject: 18-- and Public Policy.  Since there are a WHOLE range of issues
when it comes to minors within our society.  But if you want to attack me
for my opinions, then I will be ready to defend them....In a MOST verbose
manner if you annoy me ;)

To all: PEACE

Oh yeah, I heard that tonites event is ALL AGES...TRUE (I can't get a hold
of Preston...but Ken just called and I'll find out from him!).

and now people wonder why there is such a big market for fake id's...


basically my biggest grudges are the curfew law and the alcohol laws...i have
never actually gotten the 1942 version  of the law but i know that it is
selectivly enforced...(after a lowell high school dance i was walking home and
walked right past a police officer...stopped to ask me not for id and to check
my age but if i had seen someone...he was not in a hurry) interestingly enough
it was after 11pm (which i never understood if dances end at 11 and curfew star
ts at 11 how i was suppose to get home) i have always wondered if you have an
early morning sports practice or a job...how you can avoid being on the streets
 b4 6am???and all of our proms (most of which are held at the galeria design
center...which i believe they have held a few raves at...) end at 1am...
gee i guess they were corupting us youth...

and the alcohol laws blow chunks too...you aren't allowed in a place that doesn
't sell "food" along with alcohol even if there is a preformance or show
there...even if you are 18...

in a few weeks i will be joining the 21+ crew...and in a way i feel kinda bad
about it...cuz there are some clubs and events i have waited many years
and dreamed about going to...that they will let me soon get into...in a way
i don't think i want to support such ageists...but i have been plannig
to go to some of these places since i was a young teen...i don't know if i will
be able to reconcile this with myself..ever...

btw if my understanding is correct one can file to be come an independant befor
e 18 (which from my understanding is very difficult) one still can't have
those "privilages" named above...

what is the deal?..partyon...susie (:  btw have a cool time tonight at the even

Sure... Absolutely nothing, except encorage people I know who organize
things cut some slack to 18-- people.  As far as legislation goes, I'm
not foolish enough to think society is ready to treat them like
adults... nor will anything likely change that.

I, in fact, think the entire effort to put a legal facade on raves is
futile but that's another story.

I took exception in particular to _your_ assesment of 18- perple, I am
well aware of society's.  I'm only 25, after all...it wasn't that long
ago.  It just surprised me to hear such sentiments from someone on the
list.

Subject: MRA (Minumum Raving Age)


  I'm taking up the challenge by the Babylonian goddess of Chaos (Tiamat)
to answer the question: "How old does your kid have to be before he/she
should be allowed to go raving?"
  Since my oldest is married and makes more $ than I do, I guess I'll let
him go whenever he wants.    :<)
  Colin, my 15-year old and Corey, the 12-year old, are avid techno music
fans.  They have attended several of the GG Park raves, with no noticeable
adverse effects on their morals or character.
  Aha, you say, you're avoiding the question: what about those
late-nighters under the full moon, or in some dark South-of-Market warehouse?
Aren't you afraid they're going to come home stoned, shot, or at the very
least permanently deaf from the blasting of overamped speakers?
  When you raise kids, you give your best -- and I do mean best -- shot at
giving them the values you think are right: don't hurt other people; don't
take stuff (including little capsules) from strangers; try to be kind to
folks who are suffering; etc.  Your kids take on some or all of these
values, and give them a spin of their own.  But after you've had your
say, you (the parent) get a pretty good idea of the moral stamina of your
child.  Age has something, but not everything to do with it.  I would
trust Corey or Colin at a rave with the folks on this list -- though I'd
have to (and would want to) drive them to the dune or the warehouse. After
that, it's up to them to have a good time within the limits of their
consciences.
  And as for drugs: either of them -- yes, including the junior high
schooler -- could purchase E, lsd, crack, etc. at their schools.  There is
no way I could stop them.  I can only rely on the values that my wife and
I have tried to give them. And so far (knock on wood), it seems to have
worked.  
  So that's my answer.  But before I step off the soapbox, I offer one
final observation for you to test out in the future:

      The relations between parents and children hold deeper dramas
      than the relations between husband and wife.

Subject: 18-- and parties/policy/raves


>.and what about the 18-21 crowd that isn't ruled by there parents and disc
rimintated too...)
 
The original post was about 18-20 to be allowed to stay after 2:30.  Current
Cab laws here in SF have no such provision unless food is served.  I have
already addressed that issue.
 
For some ODD reason, some seem to think that I am AGAINST 18-- partying.  On
the contrary, since many have attended my functions (and let me tell
you...no SM's soptted at ANY of my functions, and the people were
great...ALL OF THEM!).  No, the only thing is I will NOT pursue a license
that allows 18--, and this pisses some people off.  I did not even IMPLY
that 18-- should not go out, or party (I HATE the word RAVE except wehre
appropriate...like tonite! :).  Just that I would NOT champion legislation
to allow them to.  And I PRECISELY pointed out why that is CURRENTLY and
unfeasible task. But for even stating that I am now an AGEIST...Give me a
break.
 
Here to even make it clearer for the MYOPIC:
 
- Will I try to go to city hall to talk about 18-- -> NO
- Will I try to go to city hall for 18-20 after 2:30 ->YES
- Will I throw events that are all ages -> YES
- Will is sign a petition to allow them entry LEGALLY -> YES
- Do I think 18-- are not valid in this society or our little sub-culture ->
NO
- Do I think more and more this scene is eroding for various reasons -> YES
- Do I think the MAJORITY of parents would allow their kids to go to a RAVE
(ugh!) full well and knowing what does go on -> NO
- Do I think that burb parents could hamper a scene if their child gets
hurt? -> YES
 
And as for howards questions, uh, who was responsible for that young man's
death in Watsonville.  The gunmen surely, but does not the security co if
any bear some responsibility, or even the promoter?  The idea of each person
is responsible is true, but if it were a reality then there would not be a
thing called lawsuits.  So the owner of a club IS responsible, or at least
should be, for his/her patrons safety.  Why you would argue this is beyond
me and stinks of irresponsibility.  There is enough of that going on in the
scene now!  Currently the CLUB is responsible for the patrons safety...so
take it to city hall if you don't agree.  I am talking fact, not theory or
theoretical lawmaking.  I am referncing things on the books now.  Your
rhetoric is illogical and does not address the issue of Cab for 18-20 after
2:30.

This event was like an exaple of what the raver community can do when
we work together..which hasn't happened since the -early- ToonTowns
(and the beginning of when the rave scene started to get popular here in SF.)
It's such a shame that it would take something as terrible as Malachy's
accident to bring us all together again..Lets hope that we can bring
together similar cooperations in the future..



High point of the evening.. the huge meditation experience at 3:00 am
when THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of ravers lifted their heartsand minds in
meditation to lift a prayer for Mal's recovery and healing..

WOW!!

For anyone who's reading this.who wasn't there..it was incredible..
They showed videos of Buddhist monks and the Dalai Lama.. and
the whole auditorium chanted OM.. 
Thousands of people's energy lifted in such a strong prayer..

Come/Unity Benefit for Malachy: My Impressions 

 I got there nice & early , about 9:45. It seemed hideously loud as I 
walked up to the auditorium , louder than usual for this venue. It 
turned out that the entrance to Come/Unity was switched to the back 
loading area. The sound was coming from a system setup in the main lobby 
area.

 Nice polite ID check & pat search ; bag check was embarassing - I 
didn't realize how much junk I had until someone else was looking inside 
it. $20 ticket - and then the first pleasant surprise of the evening - 
Brian B. at the door , taking tickets. 

 Three dance areas - the arena , the main lobby , and the "Ambient" room 
. ( For a room labelled "Ambient" , the music would often be switched to 
funky grooves or techno ). The Bermuda room was reserved for a "Temple 
of I-Magi-Nation" environment - nice place to really chill . Large 
central platform for relaxing on. Big video projection mix of movie 
videos and computer generated patterns - with music provided by a semi-
live keyboardist ( I saw him fake his way through M**3's "Brainwaves" ) 
and a DJ ( I think ).

 Met a lot of SFRavers - Gray (sic), another Larry, the Normals, MykL, 
Derek Chung, NRG, our friend Mike, Lee Fogel & his wife with-the-neat-
hat-whose-name-excapes-me-at-the-moment  Derek Yu, Craig Larson , and 
others. Will Penna brought some folks from an LSD 50th anniversary 
conference ( I'll let him post more details about the conference and his 
friends ).

 At 3AM , a healing ritual for Malachy was performed. The dance music 
was segued to a slower tribal/dub track, leading to a videotape of 
Malachy talking to us from his hospital bed. This was followed by the 
ritual portion. A tape of the Dalai Lama was projected while a Tibetan 
chant sequence was played over the sound system, as three figures waited 
on a platform. In the center of the group was a Budhist monk , waiting 
in front of the microphone for the music to end. [ Hopefully , other 
SFRavers can explain the significance of the two flanking figures ( 
especially the guy with the wings on his head ). ] After the chant tape 
was over , the priest made a short , minimalist speech/prayer for the 
healing of Malachy and the planet , and for the benefit of the future 
generation.

 The audience was generally divided into two groups - one was clumped 
near the front stage area , and the rest where scattered about the arena 
wherever they were dancing. I'd say that the front group was more 
patient with the ceremony as a whole. Of course , this was not the most 
ideal audience for any kind of religious ceremony , but it went over 
surprisingly well.

 A mixed audience it was ,too - I think much more so than VISION two 
weeks ago. Due to the multiple dance areas , it never got extremely 
crowded on the arena floor. The mood was very "up" , and even though 
some gals had their blouses off , none of them were raped that I know of 
... 


 Was there really a camera crew from The Family Channel , doing 
interviews outside? "Your Children Go To A Rave!".

 I finally paid $5/5 minutes for a Reflexology massage at about 6:30AM.

 A great event. As I'm going to take a monthlong break from raving for 
awhile , I was pleased that my last event was so positive. I may make it 
up to Golden Gate Park some sunday - hope to see you folks there!

Just wanted to post with last nights events still fresh in my mind...

It was really nice to be at a large event where the spirit and energy were
so high.  I can't help but think that Malachy feels and feeds on our love.

I'm finally starting to put names to faces... Hi Leah, Cin, Lee, Derek, MykL, 
Brian, and others!  Good to see you all...  The first time I've really sat down
and checked out VRAVE at a live event... hello Krusty's!  - The first rave ever
named after a pancake mix   =)

Anyway, I had a fabulous time... it seemed like there was a room for everyone.
I truly felt like every single room that was open was a legitimate party in
itself, and it was nice to be able to wander from one room to the next, the big
boomin' beats folding into each other.

Thanks to those of you who checked in and said hi, it makes the line between
work and play very fuzzy.  =)

Until we meet again,

Tony

Subject: Come/Unity (Yet another perspective)

Hello All,

Come/Unity was really a lot of fun.  I got in around 10:30 and
checked out the entire place.  I think it was 11:30 when I found 
the vrave location.  It was nice meeting Cindy, Leah, and Brian.
There were others there, but I didn't get a chance to talk with
them.  Maybe next time...

The Richmond location seems to be an ideal place for this size
of event.  Lots of places to go and listen to a variety of music 
and not get bored.  This was my first time here; I was impressed!

The music was great!  Markie Mark knocked me out spinning and the 
lasers that came on after the ceremony were fun.  I was surprised 
that the 3am healing ceremony took place in the main room.  I was 
searching for the location prior to that and gve up when ten minutes 
after three I couldn't find it and headed back for the main room and 
WOW!  Everyone was getting into the healing.  I had trouble tuning into
it at the proper wavelength, but my thoughts and prayers were on 
Malachy inded.  What was the pupose of the man with the bird wings 
on his head?  I'm sorry, but that sort of stuff gets a little wierd 
for me :(

What a great weekend!!  I wish for the promoters to get together in
the future to create more of these events jointly.  It went really well.

  AHA! Now that I've had 8 hours of sleep - I think he was supposed to
represent Mercury , Western Greek God of messengers and doctors ( and 
thieves? Need a mythological expert for this ). So, I guess the other guy
flanking the Buddhist monk was supposed to represent the Native American
tradition. 

  If Mercury's wings were smaller , he would have been more identifiable.
As it was , he looked like a semi-nude Viking ( a buff Hagar ?). 

  I guess they didn't have enough room for a Judeo-Christian representative 
:-\ .... (NOT!) Just another example of pagan anti-Xtian prejudice/paranoia.
They could have had a Unitarian ...
( BTW - if folks want to flame me about this , email me personally to keep

	I'll let others write about the sound system and the quality
	of the spining and other production details.  For me this rave
	was all about psychic/spiritual ENERGY.  It is a landmark and
	a turning point for the entire Bay Area House community.
	It shows what can be accomplished if we all work together.  I'm
	not just talking about the quality of the party.  Last night
	I made some really profound connections with different people
	from Police and security guards, to some company officials, to
	people I will be doing business with in the future.  Our tentacles
	truly run long and deep... deeper then any of us can even imagine.

	I think this event truly did Malachy justice, I hope it raised a 
	significant amount of money for his cause, I KNOW it raised a 
	tremendous amount of psychic/spiritual energy and there is no doubt
	in my mind that he will be healed.

	It seems obvious to me and I hope to the promoters, that our
	strength is in our numbers and what we can do as FAMILY.  I'm
	sure they can see that, what they have to give up is possesing it
	for themselves.  As a group, we can move mountains and EVERYONE 
	can/could be provide for.  Co-operation not competition is the key.

	The tibetian healing service was very powerful for me.  I felt the
	monk or priest or what ever he was, focus and channel ALL of the 
	psychic energy in the room.  This is the first time that I have
	ever felt someone do this to the extent that it was done
	saturday night.  I was pulled into a deep meditation and I felt us
	all as ONE MIND go through a GATE or DOOR.  Don't ask me to explain
	this because it comes from a totally experiential place, but I know
	that for good or ill the Scene will not be the same after this.

	Happy Birthday everybody.

Subject: San Francisco Techno-Saucer

Some competition here decided to throw their own "rave" this last weekend.
Apparently one of the organizers was from SF, and used that to promote the
event with a phoney English accent on their phone line talking about the
landing of the "San Francisco Techno-Saucer" in Salt Lake.  What this meant, I
wasn't sure.  I wasn't sure of what sort of attraction this was supposed to
add, but I'll cheerfully support someone else's events, so I went.

It wasn't put together too bad.  They had a couple of overheads with people
spinning murkey oils that sort of looked good.  The sound and two Intellibeams
was provided by the people who do Devin's "Deep" events, so they looked good,
but I'm so tired of Intellibeams that they rarely do anything for me.  The
worst part though, was the music.  Even though I could sympathize with the guy
who only had two standard CD decks, I couldn't sympathize with the jukebox
manner he used in playing the music.  There was actually dead air between
tracks and he never attempted to mix anything.  Any sort of rhythm or vibe
that would be built up by a good track (and they were few and far between,
they mostly came from "Techno Trax" compilations) would die when the silence
opened up before the next track started.  There was even a point where he
would just let a compilation CD play all the way through.

Made me sad that this was many people's first exposure to the scene here.  A
friend talked to the kids doing the oil lights and they had never heard of
"Taste".  Myself and another DJ feared for the worst when we heard about this
event, so we planned a free house party at his clothing shop in case there was
a bust.  We didn't plan for the fact that the music would be so bad, so we
ended up leaving way early anyway.  The vibe in that little shop, with just my
laser and a diffraction grating for light was so much better than what I'd
experienced earlier in the evening.  Too bad only about fifteen people saw it
happen.

I'm planning on bringing the tapes to the park on Sunday again, it was
very cool and nice to hang out in the sun with my dog, met a lot of
neat people (hi Tai, AstroBoy...)  Special thanks to Lee Fogel and the
other sfravers for playing a set on their boombox, I think a lot of
people really enjoyed it, neat to have a public unveiling, and it
definitely aroused curiosity among the throng...  (DJs Jon and Lee, I
think you've made a few new fans!)

Soooo, if you are local and pre-ordered and would prefer for me to
hold on to your tapes another week, I can do that, saving you $5 and
saving me (minor) hassle; no problem.  Otherwise they'll go out in the
mail tomorrow morning.  Send me email...

Also, I'm going to be hanging out at home tonight, some friends are
coming over to use my gear to dub some cassettes to DAT, so I'll be
around, if you want to come by, anytime between 7 and 11 pm would be
easy, I live in Mountain View.  This is the option for those who would
like to save $5 AND can't wait a week for the tapes :-) Send me email
and I'll send you directions and all.

Thanks for the bandwidth, and this is ** it ** for me on this subject

What a huge event! This was only my second rave, and it just blew me
away. They rented a small coliseum so there was room for everyone, and
there were thousands. 

The lasers were great, the music was great. The security people were
professional yet friendly. I wish all raves coupld have this quality 

Good: Music, room for lots of people, no huge lines, *coat check*,
more than one music room, security, *lasers*, the large spinning
projection at floor level, Jeff & co. (you're awesome).

Bad: All the chill rooms had loud energetic music -- not good for
chilling. Event was so large it felt kind of impersonal. But I'm new
to the scene so I figure that'll change once I get to know some
people. Danced so hard & so long I can barely walk today.

In a word: Fun!

I just found out that in addition to today being the 50th anniversary
of Hoffmann's magical bike ride, it is also the 50th anniversary of the
uprising against the Holocaust in the Warsaw ghetto.

I think it's worth taking a few minutes out and pondering the synchronicity
of these two events.

I could go on at length, but I'll try not to...  it was great.
Enjoyed hanging out / dancing with Cindy, Brian, Leah, Robert Jesse,
Anne, Larry, Lee, Janie, MykL and his friend and others.

I have to say, though, that one of the laser programs TRULY offended
me and was played more than once during the evening.  It was an image
of a burlesque dancer with nipple tassles dancing around.  I have no
problems with consenting adults viewing anything.  That said, I do
think that stuff like this is inappropriate for a large crowd of
people with mixed interests and values.  I especially think it's
inappropriate given the suggestible state of mind that many are in at
a good rave, due to the vibe and overall mindset.  Maybe I'm way off
base, but images such as this one might encourage women to take off
their clothes, and that's not right --- at least it doesn't fit my
image of the types of messages that are appropriate at a rave.

This was most uncool, and was part of the reason I left before the
event was over.

Did anyone else have a problem with this?

Bob

PS To all who are wondering: YES, I have EXTRA C2 sets, plenty for
everyone, so if you are local and want one, meet me in the park on
Sunday or drop by my house in Mountain View tonight (send email).
Mail order is also available as per the blurb sent earlier.  I decided
a while back to borrow some money and get a bunch of sets made up,
rather than just filling the orders I had received, so I have plenty
of copies... sorry for any confusion!

Subject: RE: Raving/Partying, I Agree.

Hi John:

John I for one understand and agree to what you have to say. I got blasted too
for posting something about 18+ events. I have alot of freinds under 18 that I
raved with all last summer and had a great time, Although I feel they got a
little carried away on the dosing and not the Vibe.

Your right lawsuits keep people from taking responsibilities for themselves and
unfortunately 18-- take even less.  I can totally see a parent taking action
against a Promoter, Club/Space Owner, City when one of the 18-- comes home High
on LSD, E not to mention worse things like Rape or ODing.

This is the reason why I agree IDing for 18++ events it removes alot of
liability for the promoter and puts it on the person "I can take care of
myself"(this is hard enough for those 18++ which is legal to take care of
yourself).  It would be hard for parents (lawyers) to come after him/her if
their Son/Daughter got into an event with a fake Id.  I dont want to see what
happened to scene like what happened in L.A. either. 

I agree that society and this age limit thing is FUCKED UP!!!! I hated it when
I was 21-- (there was nothing to do when I was 18++ either).  Being able to
Vote and get killed fighting for your country but not being able to go to a bar
never will make sense to me.

Dont get mad at John, get mad at the Lawyers and the loser's who don't take
responsibility for themselves.

Subject: A good time

Overall, C/U was a good time for me, but right now I can only think of a
couple incidents that really bummed me out and pissed me off.  At one point
this one guy near me grabbed the hands of the people next to him, who then 
did the same and soon we were a small circle dancing together.  I was going to
hold onto the hand of my friend Steph, but I pulled in this other woman 
since I was psyched and happy and really into the circle.  We danced like that
a short while and then broke off.  One guy looks at the woman I brought in
and asks for some water, which is tucked under her belt in plain view.
She REFUSED to give any water (and she had plenty.) :(
Why?  I gave her a really confused and mean look.  The guy was saddened and
went off dancing.  I had to walk away and muse for awhile....
Also, these girls in the Chillout room were hogging five chairs among the 
two of them.  They wouldn't give one up for this one guy so that he could
join his friends.  I thought this was a healing/happiness party...

But then again, several people came up to me and hugged me for no reason,
so I was rejuvinated.

Hi to everyone I saw there and at Mike's party, which rocked!  When Harry
Who dropped by his place with his records, you knew the evening would take 
off.  All the DJs did great jobs, and Rick Preston is the coolest guy, 
I swear.

Subject: come/unity -- so that was a rave!


Too bad i was too confused (from excessive bike riding) to discover all
the rooms, fortunately, I was able to remove my training wheels shortly
after the healing ceremony and was able to enjoy 4 hours of excellent
dancing, visuals, music and people.

The healing ceremony was definitely interesting, but, in my opinion, a
bit heavy-handed. Although I looked on it as just another fringe
experience, my partner thought it was a bit "religiously manipulative",
especially given that there were alot of suggestible, mind-expanded
folk out there. I guess part of it had to do with a bunch of mostly
white males temporarily "stealing" another culture's religion and
imagery as a tidy "sound byte"... without any examination of why they
settled upon the particular religious metaphors they did.  Why a
Warlock, a Buddhist Monk, and Apollo as opposed to, say, a rabbi, a
Zoroastrian Magi, and an Ayatollah? And why no representation from a 
priestess, or earth-momma?

Once I got past the initial shock of what they were trying to put
across, I fell into the groove and just looked at it as yet another
anthropological religious observation (kinda like the time I witnessed
animal sacrifices at the Kali temple in Calcutta... but not nearly as
gruesome). My mind gobbled up the imagery and sounds (i was near the
speakers at the stage and got BLASTED by the chanting-monk sound track
-- yay!) and it did sorta trance me out. As much as I tried, I wasn't
fully able to get into the "ritual" or "trance" because of the crowd --
despite the fact that i wasn't comfortable with the religious aspects
of the ritual, i couldn't help but get angry at the incredible
DISRESPECT shown by some ravers that insisted on whistling and hooting
while the monk gave his speech. It was clear to me that he ended early
after giving up on the crowd/ceremony; as the crowd-agitation rose
(paraphrase: "we want our MTV!") he did a perfunctory wrap-up and quit.
Whether or not you agree -- give some RESPECT!

Despite my misgivings, I felt that the ceremony was a big turning point
for the event as a whole. I felt very little "vibe" before 3AM, and
felt plenty afterwards. Maybe it was because I finally was able to
reassemble my mind, but I feel that alot of it had to do with people
stopping for a moment to realize that they were at more than a
teenybopper dance. So... whether you are rationally or spiritually
inclined, I think all of us felt that this event helped Malachy, and
helped the scene.

I personally was expecting the local TV news to show up and do some
hype-reportage on 3AM satanic/buddhist/extatic cult rituals twisting
the minds of thousands of bay area youth... but that's another story.

--------------------

Visuals: these were the best visuals i've ever seen at a rave. My
favorite was the leftmost screen (leftmost when facing the stage) and
the laser doing it's thing on the disco ball at the center. I do wish
the operators would aim the laser AWAY FROM THE CROWD -- I got zapped
straight in they eye by the laser when i was near the stage -- for a
few minutes, I could see the afterglow of the laser-burn when I shut my
eyes.

Music: nothing really blew me away musically, but perhaps this was
because i was too distracted by visuals/crowd/bike-riding. For me, the
music kicked hardest on the main floor from 5:30-7AM because it was
good-n-funky. Who was the DJ then?

PS: wasn't the buddhist monk at the healing ceremony also at the first
big golden gate park event this year? I remember seeing him chanting
and  doing something ritualistic with a bell... Even then, I thought it
was perfectly, beautifully incongruous.

Oh well, maybe I'll meet some of you at the next event.

	Getting reviewed today on our premier outing are:

_Remedy_                -- Ubik, Zoom records

_Approach and Identify_ -- F.U.S.E, Plus-8
_Digital Grooves Techno Breaks_ -- The Alchemist, ?

	Some are kind of old and some are kind of new, but they're

_Nocturbulous Behavior_ -- The Suburban Knight, UR

	From Detroit, and sounding just like it.  'Nocturbulous' is a
boggly trance, with background synth punctuation from an old Egyptian
Lover spinoff called 'Computer Power' by Jamie Jupitor.  Doesn't kick
like 'The Art of Stalking', but it works, and it's a domestic.

PRO 13 -- Cusp, Probe

	The first 2-3 minutes of 'Venusian Biosphere' are bleep noodlings over a slow bass pulse, but then the drums kick in -- a three legged gallup, 
hitting on the up beats, and building up to a trance so steep, they're going 
to have some blue-balls unless you finish them off with a Hardtrance 
Acperience or so.  'Mars the Red Planet' is in the same vein as Venus'
action mode, minus the warm-up, and so's the other track for that matter.
Also domestic, and I recommend it.
	

_Remedy_ -- Ubik, Zoom records

	Swing beats, fairly fast, sparse.  Has an LFO texture, but in a
hurry.  I've got an old single by them, on braniak records,  called 
hi-ryze, which has got one of the most idiotic and fun basslines I've ever
heard.  This one's a little more subdued.  Anyhow, a nice slide along your
Strictly Rhythm groove to maybe a Warp or a Transmat.

_Ultra EP_ -- Like a Tim, D-Jax Records

	Very minimal.  These tracks are stripped down further than any
beats and breaks disc I've got.  Drum, bass, and a single synth line
doing something loopy and rhythmic.  2 tracks are swing, as above, one's
an AFX style mantra, but pesky, another somewhere between, and one with
an electric bass (stringed) sample that sounds familiar, sorta.  Good for
mixing, but not too special.

_Approach and Identify_ -- F.U.S.E, Plus-8

	This is Richie Hawtin playing with quaaludes, Kraftwerk, and some
very round bass.  There's a scratch pad, with self-indulgent stuttered
samples that say 'Richie Rich' and would be great to throw in your mix if
you were in fact Richie Rich, but for those of us who aren't, are kind of
irritating.  I'd do the exact same, though, when I ever put out a single --
unleash x-dozen miles of vinal groovage worthless to anyone but me, just 
so as to have some hard hype to scratch myself.  This is a rerelease from
1990, but there's nothing crusty or dated about it.


_Digital Grooves Techno Breaks_ -- The Alchemist, ?

	Damn fine!  It's nice to have this -- 6 to work with, and all
are incognito and varied enough, to where I can imagine seeing this in
my A-crate even months from now.  A bouncy breakbeat doing reverb sequences
with some bass breakdowns, a straight-up techno mover, another one, but
sorta raved over, a 303 jam that's not worried about making it all the 
way to total orgasm/meltdown, another breakbeat with absolutely depraved
bass confusion, and the absolute highlight -- a loop from Juan Atkins'
'Technicolor' (which Coil copies in 'The Snow') and 'can you feel the
beat' sampled from Lisa Lisa.  My call for 94 is a freestyle, electro, miami
bass revival, even bigger than 303-neo-acid, and I'm stocking up on bargain 
bin copies of Cybotron, Mantronix, World Class Wrecking Cru while they last.




	More reviewing to come ... a batch of the hard and raw, and one 
with an SF psychedelic flavor.

In a truly dance oriented shamanistic society, we would all be known by our
own personalized dance as much as by name.  In fact, our very names would  
become synonymous with our external manifestation of our inner being.  And
to others, these "names" would also take on their own personal meaning:
individual symbols of individual existence.

I was not offended at all. I think you read too much into the
image. I thought the danser was festive rather than pornographic, 
and the
description "burlesque" did not occur to me at all. How can you say
it is not right for women to take off clothes, when there are
so many men with their shirts off? Is that not right too, and why
not? It seems to me that there is a lot more about raves that
would offend your intrests, values, and sense of appropriateness
if you are the type to think that it is not right for people to 
take off
their clothes.

The best effect for this party thang for Mal would have been to CANCEL all
parties for the month of april (this will make peope starved for partying).
Have this one MEGA bash for Mal where most would attend. (I think that the
Sunday park things should've continued, though).
Start fresh in May.

Why wasn't this doen?  I dunno.  Maybe there are some who actually make a
living at oarties.  Maybe egos, maybe who knows.  If they (the promoters,
which I am one), wanted to do the best.  A moratorium would have been the
best bet.  This gives respect tot he fact that we've a frined in trouble,
and would give time for people to replflect a bit in the sun (remember, I
would want the sunday things tg a continue).

I hope they let people know how much was raised for Mal.

NOW:

if I see ONE MORE promoter use Mals name on a flyer saying that he/she is
doing a benefit, they formally suck.  At this stage it is pure exploitation.
They can easily put this on their voice mail, or post a sign on the door of
the event.  Afterward tehy should say EXACTLY how much was raised for Mal in
their voice mail.

As for the M.O'Brian fund, a voice mail number should be established so that
reports can be given as to Mals status and how much money has been raised on
his behalf.  This will keep the exploitation factor lower.

CUnity...

Brian and Leah...it was great to meet the two of you!  Hope to see you again
at an event soon! :)

Subject: Crackin' on @ C-Unity....


Come-Unity was one of the most crackin' on events so far this year.  This is
BOTH good and bad.

AS for the good:
- Promoters got together t make this thing happen.
- Most of the popel got into the music.
- All of Mal's friends were there in force to wish him well.
- The best people cooperating (and this means everybody, not JUSt the
promoters) and helping each other make it through a near waterless night.
- DJ's did their best and really fucked that place up...
- Great sound.
- Great visuals (thanks to Craig & Crew/Hyperdelic/Pure).

The prayer ceremnoy was ok (notice the little 'o' and the little 'k'). A bit
heavy handed and contrived, but ok.  It's a healing thang.

Overall this bodes well for the community.  But since this MAY be the last
cooperative effort, it is BEST to see that many have DONE an effort at all.
Gee, SF is the shit when it comes to parties.

Now the bad:
- Was ther a gust list?  I thought I saw one. If so this is lame since
EVERYONE should pay.
(oops, I mean guest list).
- There was so much BAD VIBE in that place I almost wanted to scream.  A
friend of mine walked into the bathroom and heard some girls saying "...fuck
this shit, I paid twenty dollars to see some cripple!". This attitude sucks
and is indicative of a bunch of people who could give a fuck about anyone
but themselves.
- Scam/Testosterone factor was so high I sat up in the balcony seats to
observe the ritual.  You know: Guys danes next to girl, hoping to gert her
attention.  Girl cathces on and decides to be nice and dances next to him
for a second or two.  Guy thinks this is THE signal he's been waiting for
all night.  Girl gets really annoyed, whispers something in his ear, waves
her hand in a "no" fashion, then dances away.  Guy plays it off as if he
never wanted her fine, nicely built, and firm body in the first place.
- Putting Mals face on the screen was to say the least, too intense.  I
overheard someone who KNOWS Mal (who was not in my posse) say it was
pornographic.  I must agree.  That type of display, with all good intentions
in mind. Was not necessary.  Especially since MOST (and I DO meant he
MAJORITY of those who partied) did not even know Mal.  Most did not care.
They came for the music, the drugs, the whatever.  Not saying that the
intentions were not the best, just that it was not necessary. Considering
all factors...
- NEVER stop a party at 3:00 am.  That is the peak hour and everyone is
usually off their respective rocker.  I understand the point, but it could
have waited till the morn.  This was grandstanding.
- NEVER have a party and charge $20.00 to get in.  This decision was not
good. $20.00 for wahtever reason is TOO MUCH TO PAY. EVER.


There it is...it's after the 17th and the best is yet to come.

News from the front:

Promoters meetings (if you are interested) are EVERY MONDAY at 7:00 pm at
Sound Factory.  It was indicated that this will be an ongoing thing.  What
will come of it, who knows.  But ther's the info if interested.

Peace.

I've been thinking about it a bit, and I think that selling

Don't let them split us up like that.  

Try and avoid the age-restricted parties, even if you're
over the age limit... and if you know about some all ages
events be sure to let us all know.

What is wrong is the implied ** suggestion ** (intended or otherwise)
that they ** should ** take their clothes off.  At least it's the way
I read the image.  On another tack, the image of a basically nude
burlesque woman is an icon of male repression and exploitation of
women through the guise of entertainment.  I found it offensive on
many levels because of this --- I found it really ironic that this
image was being used for entertainment, especially at a rave, which is
supposed to be an event of inclusion and sharing, not exploitation.  I
find it even more ironic that some people found it entertaining -- it
was shown more than once.

I would have had a LOT less problem (and probably laughed my butt off)
if there had been a man in a G string image up there dancing around
with her...  this would have been totally appropriate and made me
agree with your "festive" diagnosis.

Wrongo.  I never said this.  I have no problems with people taking off
their clothes.  Hell, I even took off my clothes last night (before I
went to sleep).  But seriously, I've hottubbed nude with people I
barely know, this is California after all...  (Hi Carl!)

The image was put out in a prominent place.  I'm sure that some women
had the same reaction I did -- ugggh.  On the other hand, some women
saw the image and may have consiously decided or unconsiously been
pursuaded that taking off some (more) clothing would be a good idea.
No problems here with the clothing removal, what I don't like is the
manipulation involved, especially with a lot of people in a
suggestible state.  Either way, not mellow and not cool.

Actually, this exact scenario happened with me, but I went to the
trouble to say "No, sorry, I've got a cold" rather than just saying
"No"...  this is a really plausible explanation.  Also, with the
amount of "ravers cough" going around, I wouldn't be surprised or
offended if anyone didn't want to share their water with me, maybe
they catch colds really easily.

Subject: Unity


Well, what a weekend.

Thanks for the people who made it to my house, fantastic, looking forward
to throwing one outside in a couple of weeks...

anyway, Got to Come/Unity are 10 or so, nervous that I would have to
wait since dorrs were opening so early.  didn't.  Had a lot of fn
looking at  all the cool screens, best visuals I have seen in a LONG
time.  The laser was absolutely fantastic..it was a great surprise...

DJs who rocked--Josh, Simon (ouch!), Dutch (he and Rick are the most
underrated in the area, says zak and I), and Markie...balls nasty!  Markis'
bass was just incredible. He has a great massive sound that really 
twisted people apart.

The ceremony was really interesting.  I thought that there could have been
a call for people to pay attention, especially for our whistle blowing
friends in the back area, and even some posters explaining what would happen
so we were not caught off guard.  It was neat though, if maybe a bit too
long for some people.  I really enjoyed watching it, though, and was able
to get into it.  I also sat for awhile at the Malachy "shrine" in the
super chill chill out room with ambient stuff going on.  That was very 
peaceful, and I think I sent as much positive energy as I could muster...
it was cool at the beginning of the ceremony--it got fairly cold
where I was, maybe they opened the side doors--but it was like my 
energy was being sucked from me, sent out to where it was needed.  As I do
not know Malachy, it was nice (if a bit eerie) to see him on tape, but
I got into it.   The guy with the feathers really tripped me out,I could
not figure him out.  I loved the monk, he was very patient with us, to get
to where he was.  I felta bit embarrassed that people would not SHUT UP,
but they did eventually. I would have liked to hear his chime go
through out the entire hall at the end, but alas, it did not, due to whistles.
Thgat is the first time I have ever felt that the whistles should be put
away.  Too bad.  I think we did a lot of good work together, though.

Anyone bump into that chiropractor guy?  he did wonders for my neck.
"relax...CRUNCH!" Felt like a champ.

At the end (it went by FAR TOO FAST) we hung out for awhile, half of my
group went home, I could not, so I went with zak and alan and friend to 
Denny's then Tilt-a-whirl, which was very nice.  Free food and stuff,
It really made my day nice after I went there for awhile.  There was 
a cool dj from England, I cannot remember her name, but she played some
neat tunes.  Carlos was there, dancing up a storm.  I like that place a lot.
I hope more people go there.  the park was CLASSIC.  Of course it failed
to happen.  you get a bunch of dosed people to throw a celebration like
that and something is going to happen....so nothing went on at Marx Meadows,
at least not officially.  Lee saved the day by having a box delivered, a
nd the connection tapes ruled the land.  FANTASTIC tapes.  REally cool.  I
am going to pick up a set next sunday.  The park was great, a lot of people
showed up, lots of LSD adventurers from previous times, it was a neat collection
of past and present lysergic surfers. I had a ball, an absolutely great time
chilling out and enjoying the sun.  Actually, my neck and half of my face are
burned to hell, but it was worth it.  Even the train ride home was nice...
a great weekend.  

This might not be true for everyone, but I thought the crowd at Vision was
a bit better than Saturdays.  I am not to sure why. A lot of people
were very much into their own little groups and such, but maybe that
was just me.  I had a ball running around and channeling all sorts of energy
throughout the building.  I just can't seem to sit still.  hello to everyone
I met, I hope I didn't seem rude, I just don't stand still for very long
at these things.  I guess I am saving up for the parks.

Next week Channeling?  I don't know.  See you at the Park though.

Getting used to CalTrains,

Mike

Or maybe it wasn't water at all!  Maybe it was a water bottle of Vodka, or
Everclear, or white gasoline.  Maybe the girl was an alien or Disney
prototype.  Or it could have been a specially refracted light-weight water
bottle, with no water in it at all, simply a fashion statement.

This is really not a bad stance for everyone to take. I have always passed my
water bottle around freely, but several times I have had people warn me of
diseases other than colds that can be contracted.  My girlfreind thought she
got a cold sore this way.

A solution to this is to get one of those water bottle tops that are little
valves (like on Bicycle water bottles) that screw on Normal bottles, or bring a
bicycle water bottle.  This way when you share ask people not to put their lips
on it.

I tend to agree, especially because such images seem *only* to involve
naked women, not naked men, so it's sexist *and* offensive to many. 
On the other hand, I don't want to discourage people from  taking off
their clothes.
I just want an atmosphere that doesn't pressure anyone,
and I sure seem to know a lot of women who are put off by that type of 
nudity.  Not nudity per se, but showgirl/playboy_bunny type stuff. 

I want to get turned on by people, not pictures.

Well I don't know about cold sores but after getting really sick and 
having to stop raving for about 3 weeks, I'm a little hesitant to drink
out of passed around water bottles.  Only because I don't want to get infected
again, the common cold can be passed VERY EASILY through a water bottle,
if your immune system is surpressed from drugs, lack of sleep and dancing
it is very easy to get sick.  Eventhough I know this, I was still drinking
out of random people's water bottle cuz I got really thirsty.  I remember
thinking a couple of times that if THEY really wanted to get rid of ravers
all THEY would need are a couple of bottle of Evian with anthrax and we'd all
be done for :)

Subject: come on


I have been talking with some people about he ceremony thing, and
there were some interesting observations from some fairly new ravers...

One thought that the ceremony tried to build a false sense of community.
Now, I took some offense to that at first, but maybe there was a grain
of truth to it.  I mean, I posted earlier that I had really "got into it"
when the monk was chanting.  I did, but only partly because of the
Malachy element.  I was really trying to figure out what he was saying,
but I do realize I was hoping that it would end fairly soon because I was
having so much fun dancing.  I was also affected by the people who
were next to me.  They looked like they couldn't give a damn, and I was
trying so hard to be focused because I thought that's what I was supposed
to do.   I don't know.  I was kinda spooked out when I thought about it later,
having Malachy talking really really wierded me out because I couldn't hear
him and he was so disemobided it looked kinda scary...I don't know.   
I guess I wanted to get into it more because I really wanted to help
in whatever way needed, but I wasn't able to focus due to different elements.

Also, it would have been nice to focus more on the benefits of the house
community coming together and working together.  I mean, I knew about 
all the politics because of the net, but lotsa other people probably didn't
realise it.  

I guess the comment about community came up because we were somewhat
"forced" to be a part of it.  Now, I really didn't mind that, but I guess
some people did. 
I agree with the message aobut using Malachy's name on fliers.  That is so
much bullshit.

I think Joe's point was as follows:

The quote in parentheses is an example of obviously flawed and wrong logic.
He was comparing this argument to the argument that has been floating around
on this mailing list that we should fight for the rights of 18+ partyers
first and not worry about the rights of those under 18, since securing
rights for 18+ is more politically feasable, whereas having under-18 people
at raves could be inviting trouble.

He does not agree with this argument  (Vested interest? ;) OR the one about
whites and blacks.

Yes, apparently it's the sole source of income for many promoters, DJ's,
lighting and sound people, etc.  Would you give up your day job for a month
because of what happened (if it wasn't of tangible benefit to Malachy)?

Do you think it's appropriate to consider whether this is what Malachy would
want to happen?  In his worldview, these parties are a very powerful force
for global peace and healing.  I know he would have been distressed if
the parties were stopped on his account.  That might not have been your
call had you been in his position, but you're not he.  Less than a week before
the accident he said to a close friend, "if something bad happens, dance
to make it better." [verbatim quote]

I do think a moment of silence for the people shot in Watsonville would
have been highly appropriate -- I regret it didn't occur to me or anyone else
to suggest this.

> if I see ONE MORE promoter use Mals name on a flyer saying that he/she is

This was universally agreed at the last two promoters meetings.  This
won't be tolerated unless 100% goes to Malachy, as was the case for Oracle.

Finally, there was *absolutely* no guest list.  Only the DJ's got in for free.
Even the production staff paid.

Subject: COME-UNITY REVIEW..


i will make my review kinda brief b/c what i wanted to say has been said already
by many people and i do not want to bore anyone with repetitive observations.

i agree that Come-Unity was the top 3 raves of the year..  I have to put Connectin 2 at the top and the Vision two weeks ago tops this past one by a nudge.

I guess one of the reasons i put Vision ahead of this one was b/c i was just 
sick of the space.  This is my 3 rave there in the past 6 weeeks..  I went
there for that IMAG. NATION (Cool World- Ugghh), Vision, and Come-Unity.
that space is just too big and tends to seperate people.  you have maybe 
500 people up in the balcony sitting with there own little cliques. those 
auditorium seats allow for little social interaction.  and i did notice a bit 
of unfriendlyness in a few, but that is overshadowed by the good vibe i felt
all night...
the good points- as everyone has already indicated are the lights, sound, the
spinning (Markie Mark!!!!), and the setup compared to Vision..


hope this twenty-first review of Come-Unity did not bore anyone..


**********DEREK************

p.s.  oh yeah, i did run into that chiropractor guy in the chill-out room.  that
	guy was amazing.  he went around cracking everyone's neck.  It feels 
better than it sounds..  he made you lie down, take deep breaths, and then suddenly jerk your neck and releive all that tension. intense stuff....

Yes, Crash Worship is the shit.  There's something about real drums played
well that 4/4 techno-bump just can't match no matter how many watts are
pushing it in your face.

Too bad they were in a "nice" venue and couldn't start as many fires as 
usual.  The show at Gilman last November had an even more intense setting
and a slightly better crowd that didn't mosh as much -- ironic, hey?

Evidently they played way out in the desert near L.A.  This is a thing I
would have driven to see.  Too bad I didn't know about it.

Their shows tend to keep away the gadflies and poseurs, as you can't really
go there and emerge with your clothes not messed up.  I've never seen (or
been in, yeah) a slither pile that big.  Helps when everyone is being hosed
down with fire extinguishers and cheap wine.

I need to start drumming again, meaning I need space to play.  I may have 
some when I move.  Is anyone else in South Bay interested in forming a
tribal orchestra?

Greetings, brethren:

I'd just like to say that all the positive vibes from the raves are really 
filtering into this maillist: even here in vancouver I can feel the sense
of community. Maybe when I get a car I'll come visit (Love to meet virtual but
our sysadmin here at SFU has defined vrave as a "game" :P )... I think its
cool that on this mail list there are literally people from almost every walk
of life. It just goes to show that raving isnt just a bunch of kids with 
nothings better to do that the media and society in general portrays us as.

Unfortunately, up here the legal age is 19, I'm 18 1/2, and most of the raves
are in licenced premises. This bums me out occasionally, but I get by... You've
just got to make do with what you have (like putting on my headphones and
dancing around my dorm room at 3am.. wicked.. Don't know if its to combo of
lack of sleep and exhaustion and the darkness, but it gets pretty intense).

Anyhow, thought I'd just say hi.
Peace out, flame off.

Subject: Re: Koolaid / Acid 


_The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_ is a book by Tom Wolfe
about Ken Keasey dropping out of his "job" as a novelist
(_One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ and even better
_Sometimes a Great Notion_) to lead a band of merry
pranksters called The Merry Pranksters on an acid drenched
trip around the country in a psychedelically painted bus.  
The main bus driver was Neal Cassady, also written about
(under the name Dean Moriarty) by Jack Kerouac in the book
_On the Road_.  Included in the band of pranksters was the
young Stewart Brand, later to become involved with the Whole
Earth Catalog, Whole Earth Review, book about the MIT Media
Lab, and so on.  

People who insist on drawing parallels between the 60s and
raves are likely to refer to this frequently.  Ditto people
who think raves are about doing drugs.  It has some
interesting stuff in it I suppose, but also lots of boring
stuff... it's hard for me to avoid the conclusion that it
mainly documents a long period in Kesey's life wasted on
(chemical) mental masturbation.  Personally, I wish he'd
spent the time writing more books.

(In case I haven't editorialized enough already: yeah,
knowing some history is a good idea, but nostalgia is, if
you'll excuse the expression, a bad trip.  And whatever the
Pranksters were about, it certainly wasn't nostalgia, and if
anyone out there is harboring ideas like "wouldn't it be
cool to be like the Pranksters and bring back the good old
days of Acid Tests and Woodstock" I'd like to suggest it's a
better idea to twist your head around and look in the other
direction.)

Hm.  Did I answer the question?  Should I have mentioned
that "Acid Tests" were acid parties, begun in the days when
it was legal (picture posters hung up on college campuses:
"Can you take the Acid Test?").  The title of the story
refers to a party at Kesey's place, where Tom Wolfe got
himself involuntarily dosed by drinking Kool-Aid spiked with
acid that was put out for anyone to drink (just possibly,
that practice was a tad irresponsible, no?).  

But then, should I talk about the Hell's Angels invited to
the party?  The now archetypal gang bang that I still see
discussed in places like the New York Times?  Maybe I should
explain that this was before Altamont?  Should I mention
Hunter S. Thomphson's _Hell's Angels: A Strange and Terrible
Saga_?

  My gosh , your folks must have raised you on health food! ( Unless you
forgot to put in a " :-) " ) Kool-Aid is a crystalized , colored powder
that is dissolved in water to make a sweet soft drink. I don't remember
where in the grocery store they sell it. 

 Kool-Aid commercials were always pitched at kids - I guess because it 
was so easy to mix , and didn't require a can opener. Just like any other
soft drink - a lotta sugar with a pinch of flavoring.

Well, these things do vary from one continent to another.  Sweet
flavoured drinks of all kinds are commonplace here in concentrated
liquid form (often refered to as squash).  The main defining
characteristic of these drinks is they are usually fruit flavoured,
and they invariably contain no fruit.  I haven't seen such things in
powder form.  If it does exist here then it's certainly not
commonplace (or least it wasn't when I was young -- I don't drink the
things much these days so it could have crept up on me unawares.)

Anyway, thanks for the info.  What does it taste like ? -- does it
come in lots of different flavours...?

Mike, this was sarcasm.  Lighten up.  But the FACT is if they wanted to
raise the Maximum amount of cash then a moratorium would have been the best
bet.  If the promoter is any good they should have some money in reserves
saved up so that they can devote some time to making this a killer
production.  Or even stop all parties until after the 17th.  There are many
ways. But parties were thrown up to that day, and I thouhht that it was less

Uh, exactly how much of this party WAS Malachy's call?  I doubt much of it
was.  I also think that Mal wouldn't want things blown out of propotion in
the way things have been handled recently.  So unless Malk was involved at
each step then none truly knows what his call was.

I do not want to seem mean spirited about all of this, just that many people
have now started talking, and speaking on Mal's behalf.  People who don't
even know him.  I do know better than to voice an opinion or beleif on the
behalf of someone without their prior consent.  All I can hope for is that
consent was given at each step.

I hope Mal get's better soon...how much was raised?

Except for the big chunks of flesh that keep falling off of his body, Grey
seems to be quite healthy these days. 

IMO, I think we're getting a little paranoid over this germy water thing.  
In any crowded closed in area with poor ventilation, sweat, hand touching,
smoke, dust etc. you're going to be coming in contact with desease-causing 
elements.  Conserve energy, be aware of your body's needs, replenish needed
nutrients, keep that immune system pumpin'.  The mental stress caused by 
worrying about germs probably does more harm than the germs themselves. 
It would be a shame if the fear of coodies is allowed to get in the way of
a basic activity of sharing/caring for each other.

Why worry so much what other people are doing?

yes it was beyond incredible.  it was all that and more.  however, i
thought the music in the main room was pretty lame for most of the
evening.  i mean, i am SO sick of acid crash, we are phuture and
whatever else all the mainstays of the scene play to death.  every
time i walked in there it was like "damn.  can't they find any NEW
songs?"  fortunately, the room in the back (front?) was WICKED.  first,
dutch & carlos were doing a tag team thang that was joyous.  later,
rick preston did one of the most incredible sets i've heard in ages.
he brought back "pump up the volume" which i've been wanting to do for
ages.  i like his new goatee, too.  after that, robbie hardkiss ripped
it up in traditional robbie style.  yummmm.  i was so out of it i
could do little more than sit on the floor with my jaw hanging open
making "mmm wow" noises.

the bermuda room didn't really interest me, with the beatles blasting
or darwin chamber pretending to play...  however, the OTHER chill room
was INCREDIBLE!  i want to know who that DJ is cos I could just kiss
him.  he played satellite serenade (which really is the best thing the
orb have done in a long time - damn, now i've gotta find it!), some
trancy meat beat manifesto (paradise found for you score-keepers),
infinite wheel's "lake of dreams" (at the RIGHT speed!) and much much
more.  heavenly, absolutely wonderful.

i couldn't really get into the vibe on the main floor - just too many
people showing off and too much boring music.  once i discovered all
the little nooks & crannies around the building, i was much happier.
the visuals were amazing in the main room tho.  i wish they had put
rick & robbie in there and left jeno & the rest of the crew out in the
hall.  still i was seeing some pretty amazing things in my head, even
without lasers & video screens to aid me...

afterwards i went to a small party being given for jon williams'
girlfriend lindsay - a birthday/going away party.  we're going to miss
her.  *sniff*

me up nicely, which totally relaxed me and focused my energy outward \
rather than inward.  I wish I could have given him something, a trip toy
or whatever.  Great guy.

About the water:  I am fully aware of the communicability of disease via
shared bottles, and being worried about getting sick is fine.  I was put
off because she didn't explain to the guy as to why she didn't want to 
share.  She just shook her head 'no'.  I have refused to share water
\before while I was raving withg a cold for fear of getting someone else
sick.  People are usually grateful that you are looking out for them.
So if you don't want to share your water, give them a good excuse.

The more I think about it, the more I realize that c/u was only a mediocre
experience for me.  Way too many people who didn'y Understand The Vibe.
I guess this was because c/u was the only event that night and people had
no other options.

I have to say Bob, if I were a woman I'd be more offended at someone
thinking that women are so shallow that they could be encouraged to
strip their clothes off soley by a suggestabile state of mind and
a laser-image of a burlesque dancer than I would be at the image itself
(if I was the type to be offended by the image, which I'm not, and I
don't think I would be if I were a woman either).  Maybe the image is 
not appropriate, hell I don't know, I don't represent everyones point of
view but I don't think you need to be concerned about those poor
suggestable woman.  If it was like that, I'd be concerned about guys
going around with pocket watches:  "Stare at the watch as it rocks
back and forth.  You are getting horny, very horny."  Besides, if 
someone wants to be nude at a rave, more power to 'em.  Anything that's
in the face of normalicy or reminds me of the diversity that I'm 
immersed in at a rave puts a smile on my face.

Hi there. Just thought that I'd let people know that both rooms were dat
recorded on saturday night.

The main room was recorded using an ADAT (an 8 - Track Digital Recorder)
that had the music (left and right channels) and the audience (two
microphones) recorded onto it. Naut Human offered his services to do this.

I spent Sunday night and most of monday mixing down the tracks onto new
DAT masters and believe me it sounds great !

The DAT masters will later this week be transferred to cassette masters
and hopefully within two weeks or so a six tape package of the full
unedited night will be available with all profits going to the Mal trust
fund.

The recordings of the other room will also be released but I have no
information as this was done by another group who have to get clearance
from the DJ's concerned.

As to using Yemotos speech for a sample for a record it will be very
direspectful to do so without first approching him and requesting this. He
is an extremely important religious person and would be greatly offended
if this were to happen without his consent.

Thanks to everyone who worked, supported, and attended Comeunity on Saturday.

Love and Peace

Although I was not a witness to this particular video image, I have
to say that as a woman, I find this offensive. I was at a Jesus and
Mary Chain concert earlier this year and during one of their songs
projected on the video screen behind them were scenes of a blindfolded
woman, women dancing naked, a gun being held to her mouth, scenes of
her sucking off a dildo and various other offensive images that had
absolutely nothing to do with the song. Pretty lame.

I don't usually focus on things like this, but I just find it puzzling.
I also don't have any problems with consenting adults viewing anything,
but when I see things like this, I just have to wonder. 

Not over sensitive, just concerned,

Elizabeth.

I really got to play with Rob's VR set-up this time -- I especially like the

multi-colored trails all over the screen.  Gee kids, remind you of anything?

It was good to meet all the net-ravers who came from Richmond, Univ. of MD,
DC/AU, and Charlottesville.  I have to laugh a little about Susie and Derek,
though:  Derek says "I don't like hardcore" yet he was bouncing around like
his butt was on springs during it; Susie (Ms "oh I miss San Francisco style
house and acid jazz") says "oh, there's this Orb remix that I really like"  --
it's Influid's "Mastermind", Susie -- 168 bpm of slamming 909's and acid
noises.  What's with you people?  Is it politically incorrect to admit that
MAYBE, just MAYBE you *like* hardcore :-) :-)  ;-)  I know how you feel,
though, because I used to be the same way.  Thanks for coming, everyone -- next
time, get there earlier!! :-)

10 125  06:42 Spooky: Schmoo (Steppin' Razor Mix)

Comments: Before I listened to this, I somehow knew I would favor the second
disc.  I was right.  The first disc is more in a housey vein, the second isn't
really techno or trance, but something in between.  More like Orbital's more
dancey stuff, and the reason they come to mind is the excellent remix of Drum
Club they provide with "Alchemy".  The first disc isn't bad, it just isn't my
cup of tea.  However, I do enjoy Spooky's wonderful "Don't Panic" and
amazingly enough, the "Jelly" remix of D.O.P.'s overplayed "Groovy Beat", as
well as "Flatliners".  One the second disc, "Feel", "Schudelfloss" and the
tribility of "Feeling Warm" and "Intoxication" make those tracks stand out
from the rest.

Summary: 7/10.  Domestic and packed, but with about a 40% hit rate in my
opinion.


Moodswings: Taste EP - Rainsong
Arista/BMG: 74321 118572
Volume One:
1   94  04:27 Rainsong
2  110  04:53 Wombtones
3  122  04:15 100% Total Success (Madsters at Work Mix)
4  116  04:19 100% Total Success (Moodfood Version)
Volume Two:
1   91  06:23 Rainsong (Moodfood Version)
2  117  05:33 Skinthieves (Deluge Mix)
3  122  05:19 Skinthieves (Murder Mix)
4  122  04:05 100% Total Success (Do What You Want Mix)

Comments:  A highly anticipated set of remixes for several trakcs from the
Moodswings "Moodfood" album.  Both discs are actually sold seperately due to
the UK limits on EP releases, but the first disc DigiPak container has a well
for the second disc.  Short of the "Wombtones" track on the first disc, I'd
recommend just buying the second disc.  The remixes of "100% Total Success" on
the first disc are lackluster and unamazing, "Rainsong" is slightly different
from the original.  "Wombtones" itself is wonderful with a huge ambient intro,
then soft slow drumming when it finally does break out.  On the second disc,
the "Skinthieves" remixes are good, especially "Murder".  The "Do What You
Want Mix" is better than the mixes on the first disc, but still doesn't
compare to the original.

Summary: 6/10.  Expensive and slightly disappointing.  If you're curious, just
buy the second disc for a "taste".


Airstream: Airstream
One Little Indian: 66TP7CD
1  115  03:57 Airstream (Short But Sweet Mix)
2  115  07:12 Airstream (Good 'n' ard Mix)
3  114  08:33 Airstream (Arkansas Chugabug Mix)
4  122  04:32 Road Hog

Comments: Produced by Steve Hillage, Airstream opens with a light beat and a
wickedly beautiful piano riff, then the vocals kick in.  This guy can't sing
and the lyrics are especially bad.  I hoped that the mixes would possibly
throw him out, but only the "Arkansas" mix comes close with about three
minutes of opener.  The "Good 'n' ard Mix" is simply a longer version of
"Short But Sweet".  "Road Hog" surprised me with an instrumental that harkened
back to, of all bands, Felt?  Ironically, I loved their instrumentals and
hated their singer as well.

Summary: 4/10.  Nice listening when there aren't vocals, yet not extremely
dancey.  Somewhere between older indie and newer techno.


Blue Eyed Christ: Catch My Fall
Kk: KK081CDS/390.1081.3 16
1  123  02:09 Dive
2  123  06:17 Stratosphere
3  123  06:22 Troposphere
4  123  06:33 Ozone
5  123  04:12 Ionosphere
6  101  03:02 Biosphere
7  101  08:17 Abyss

Comments: An angry young reznoralike yells his vocals into your ears.  You
wish you were home, listening to The Orb.  Then the third track comes on.  You
are listening The Orb, "Evergrowing Brain" in fact.  The single continues to
mutate through 123 BPMs, using a female vocal which works for the single much
more than the lead's own.  Thankfully, after "Stratosphere" he reappears
singing on the bottom of a spinning lake.  Yes, I'm rambling, but how do you
describe a single that is remixed in 123 then 101 BPMs, from industrial
originals to Orb samples, to trancey female ahhhs, to a hip-hop beat, back to
pure ambience?  Apparently, I just did, but this has to be the strangest set
of remixes I've ever seen.

Summary: 6/10.  I love it and I hate it.  The band is from Illinois, but the
single is from Holland, go figure.  Sort of sketchy at an import price, but
otherwise good.


Hypnopedia: Spectral EP
Boy Records/ZYX: BOY 8846-8
1  132  07:00 Cario
2  133  05:39 Mark IV
3       06:44 Eclypse
4       12:47 Spectral

Comments: Rather ordinary attempts at trance with the first two tracks on this
disc, then a pair of odd ambient pieces.  "Eclypse" is the Eddie Van Halen
answer to ambient music with a screaming guitar solo eclipsing any sort of
mood trying to be set with beatless backing music.  "Spectral" is interesting,
with rainstorms, bird sounds, strange reminiscent beats, new age snippets,
Spanish guitars, a light synth, and Harry Connick Jr.  The two artists in
Hypnopedia create a beautiful ambient mix.  "Spectral" is definitely the
highlight and the focus of this EP.

Summary: 4/10.  Bit pricey on the import, worth purchasing only for the title
track.


Twitch CD 6
Twitch: TW-CD-06
1  120  05:43 Lion Rock: Lion Rock
2  122  06:11 Baha Men: Back to the Island
3  122  07:23 Jaco: Show Some Love
4  123  06:58 The Orb: Blue Room
5  124  07:16 Fini Tribe: Forever Green
6  125  07:22 Coco Steel & Lovebomb: You Can't Stop The Groove
7  125  06:18 Supereal: One Nation
8  128  06:42 Prefab Sprout: If You Don't Love Me
9  128  07:16 Shakedown Productions: Alhambra
10 128  06:18 Electrosonik: I am the Creator
11 128  07:19 Ultraviolet Catastrophe: Trip Harder

Comments:  The strongest release yet from Twitch.  The prime mover on this
album is the Ultraviolet Catastrophe's remix of Orb's "Blue Room".  These boys
put Frank de Wulf to shame as they completely restructure "Blue Room" into an
even more explosive track.  UVC's own release, "Trip Harder" makes its way to
CD for the first time.  If you haven't heard this track yet, prepare for some
severe head melting.  On the strong side, the wonderfully beautiful remix of
Prefab Sprout's "If You Don't Love Me", Lion Rock's "Lion Rock", and Shakedown
Production's "Alhambra".  Coco Steel & Lovebomb didn't impress me this time
around, and I'm really tired of the "I am the creator" sample used by
Electrosonik.  Electrosonik's music didn't do much for me either.

Summary: 9/10. Twisty, twitchy remix work.  Although there are some weak
points, the strong tracks really stand apart and make this a worthwhile
purchase from Twitch corp.

Not to put a damper on people's enjoyment of the show, but I just thought I
should mention I had a very bad time.  Why?  Because I went all the way into
SF by myself only to find the show was 21+ and I couldn't get in.  Given
the incredible information density of the flier and the voice mail message,
you'd think they would have mentioned this small detail when I got back
(yeah, I just turned around and went back; didn't have my rave guide with me
and didn't really feel like going out for the sake of going out anyway) I
left a rant on their voice mail, but whether they cared I dunno.  So I
missed yet another opportunity to see my first Crash show.

Oh well. Maybe if we find me a good rave to go to this weekend I'll cheer
up.  :)

Kool-Aid is powdered drink mix that most of us were raised on in 
the 60s and 70s.  It's VERY SWEET due to the dump-truck load of
sugar that the package directions call for and comes in many
flavors with NEW! ones comming out every summer.  The dye is also
very strong and stains your fingers and can be used on hair (old
practical joke:  Unscrew a shower head and put in a package of
Kool-aid).  It's mascot is a giant pitcher full of Kool-aid that
used to burst through walls and other structures and say "OH YAHHH!"
in a Wolf-man Jack voice when one kid would say "I'm Hot" and another
would respond with "I'm Thirsty" and then in unison "Hey Kool-Aid"
You used to be able to order Kool-Aid collectors cups when you saved
10 proofs of purchases plus $1.50 and your mom or grandma would
send it away and it would take 6 million weeks to arive and you and
your sister would fight over who got the watermellon one.... Sorry,
flashback.

The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (EKAAT) - you got it a little off - 
has already been described but I'll add that I think they started
as all night parties held in the Marin headlands (If memory serves) 
and everyone danced to music and many took acid and the early Grateful
Dead played at some/all(?) of them.  Kind-a-like raves with a band
instead of a DJ.

        Well, for most of the show (at least before CW came on) I had a
rather bulky backpack on my back, and I had at least three or four people
come up to me asking for acdi -- this WAS supposed to be a show
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the discovery of LDS, after all. I
guess they assumed I had some in my pack or something, which I did not.

        Other than that, the only real drug present was alcohol, of which
there was quite a bit (all 4 bars at 1015 Folsom were open). CW also did
something different from either of the other two times I've seen them as an
encore -- they set up all their drums in the middle of the pit and then did
about ten-fifteen minutes of the most intense non-electronic drumming I've
ever seen or heard in my life.

i too really enjoyed some of the music (jason's?) in the chill room.  didn't  
pay much attention to my watch, but i think it must have been say between  
midnight and two that i heard there some very cool ambient stuff (from CD, i  
thought i saw once) mixed with some very cool grooves:  slower rhythms,  
evolving from the faintest origins into funky, jazzy, complex, constantly  
changing patterns.  far more interesting (in my Prime Time state of  
consciousness then) than the more repetitious drum machine stuff that most  
house is made of (much as i groove on that too).

overall, i was overjoyed with the event.  my expecations had been low - of an  
overcrowded, overproduced megarave - and i was pleasantly surprised at every  
turn.   it was also satisfying to see and hang out with so many folks i know  
- as brian has said, my family - my tribe.

i'm taking off tomorrow morning for the Big March in washington, and will be  
off the list until early next week.  if there's any traffic you'd like me to  
see in the interim, i'll be grateful if you cc or forward it to me.  - bob

Interesting observation.  I had been looking (i.e., wandering and dancing
all over and through every room) for a few friends since I had arrived at
about 12:30.  During the ceremony, I wandered about not thinking of them,
but observing everybody's reactions and trying to project positive energy
towards Malachy.  

Afterwords, the main room was packed - after all, most everybody ended 
up there.  Anyway, I glanced up and there they were - synch.  Earlier, a
friend had even told me to quit looking and I'd find them.

I really don't want to say too much about the ceremony other than maybe alot
of people didn't really clue in to its intended purpose.  Nobody should
really be faulted for that, since it is a sensitive subject not really
appropriate to mass fliering.  Those who did, though, were the core of the
community and I'm sure Malachy felt their energy.

seeing the various postings about water-sharing protocol, shirtlessness,

with the following ideas.  they are some guidelines that, in my dreams,
ravers (celebrants) and rave promoters (producers) would naturally follow.
taking a celebration ritual as a metaphor (and a training ground) for life,
i think it's not a bad direction for the planet, too.  i don't mean to say
that this is "the" "right" model for behavior, or that it answers all
questions.  it's just one simple aesthetic out of countless possibilities.

Subject: ???

	Imagine a regime so totalitarian that it will not allow its young
	citizens to dance when they want.  Imagine that this regime
	introduced a law which banned dance parties unless they were
	authorised by the state, and even then the parties would only be
	allowed to be of limited duration and on state-licensed premises.
	Naturally this regime would, in line with its ideology, only apply
	these laws to parties held for profit.

	The populist pro-government newspapers would of course launch a
	propagnada campaign against what it would call evil dance party
	organisers.  The pro-government press would conduct a hysterical
	smear campaign, describing the party organisers as criminals.

	In order to combat the subversive profiteering free market dance
	party entrepreneurs the state would form Lifestyle Police. ...

	This is truly a regime of which Stalin or Hilter himself would be
	proud, implementing socialist policies to protect the citizens from
	their own moral weakness. ...

	Sadly, the above is not fantasy, it is based on reality.  In Britian
	in 1990 all this happened ...

	... The Lifestyle Police are controlled by members of a powerful but
	little known clandestine entryist political party known as the

	The Safety Nazis want to ban things: video nasties, cigarettes,

Well the idea with me isn't so much to run away from
eroticism (I couldn't care less if you've got images of
naked women around), but to realize that raves are a very
broad based movement with lots of different kind of people,
and you've got to have some respect for their
tastes/inhibitions/whatever or your going to drive a lot of
them away.  

It's like that flyer for "Sin" awhile back with the picture
of a couple fucking on it.  My reaction was "how disgusting"
but how astoundingly clueless.  What kind of frat-boy jock
assholes were they trying to attract?  Didn't they realize
how many women they were driving away with that kind of
advertising?  

And we've all seen the way "eroticism" works in the singles
bar scene, and we'd do almost anything to stay away from
that particular nightmare... people get so focused on
getting laid that they can't even talk to each other like
human beings (and consequently can't get laid either).

Actually, I think it's one of the reasons you might get
women dancing topless at a rave is that they feel
*comfortable* there. 

(There's other things I could say... like there's an
unresolved tension between "raves as a mass movement" and
"raves as an elite, underground, sub-culture"... but I'll
save it for another day.)

The way I look at it, if we start putting a little economic

problem might get fixed by the venue getting a different
permits, or by promoters finding different venues.

its not that im against everyone taking all their clothes off and
dancing naked
cuz REALLY
im not
but this is not something that i would want done because people
want to go stare at naked women or something
its just that when you dance around naked it is 

1 - very freeing and uplifting
	its just you and the open air and it usually feels good

2 - a good way of tearing down barriers
	IF you can be naked without being self conscious of it
	~~ then it is really hard to put up barriers around yourself
	   with other emotional and what not things
	   that is, you tend to be frienlier

ill stop there but i could go on
there are problems with doing so, though, (aside from physical ones)
and thats that people dont have a basic respect for their fellow human beings

i mean there is a huge difference between some woman who wears a way less
than opaque blouse and a woman who takes her shirt off because she is hot

this saturday im going to be working with Bikini Kill, one of those
nice bands of females content and they happen to take their shirts off
when theyre working and my partner and i were told
'Dont look at their breasts or they will beat you up.'

and i think its really sad that one naturally assumes that
because im male im going to go around staring at women just
cuz their naked, but i understand why one would

personally i get offended by stupid pictures of naked women
whether its in an art museum and its by Gaugin 
or whether its on some video projection at a rave
all it does is serve to de-humanize women and  i really
dont see how something like that can possibly coincide with 
the ideology that seems to be behind this whole community

im not one for censorship, but i dont exactly want to see
animals be experimented on and tortured
and i would much less like to see women being turned into sex objects
and i think it should be a responsibilty of anyone 
who wants to further the community to try to stop this

i hate it when i go wacko about things like this, i mean hell,
i spent 5 minutes last nite yelling at the tv, cuz some guy said
magazines that show 'young, healthy women'(not to mention the fact
that they're not wearing clothes) encourages other women to stay in shape

but i think its really important that if nothing else
people need to check themselves
and make sure that they arent doing anything themselves
to encourage any of this

    This issue seems to be a pointer to something else I've noticed, 
that never really has piqued my interest till now.  It seems in the 
mad rush to love everyone we've lost an important aspect of the 
human existance, sex.  I would say the majority of the people I know 
through the scene are either single (some by choice, some not) or
in sime cases simply asexual (it's as if the idea doesn't even cross
their mind).  It's as if people are more focused these days on having
a wide assortment of good friends rather than a few close, intimitate
friends.  In many ways this is a good thing, a break from the sex-
centered "meat markets" of bars and a sharp contrast to the disco scene
of the 70's.  But many people seem to have a genuine fear of sex and their
sexuality - AIDS is prolly the biggest cause, and rightfully so;  but
I can't help but think there's more to it than that.  I don't mean to
sound like Dr. Ruth, but isn't sex a part of a healthy human existance?
Isn't the heavy anti-sex bias actually equivalent to sexual repression?
I think this bias is more against heterosexuals than gays or bisexuals, 
for what it's worth.  I'm not suggesting people should get it on in the
middle of the dance floor, I'm not suggesting we all adopt the lambada
as the official rave dance, I'm not suggesting we sell aphrodisiacs at
the smart bar (wow, this is fun, I could go on and on! :)  but it just
seems kinda skewed... I didn't actually see the laser display Bob mentioned;
most of what it was drawing against the parachute was pretty muddled 
anyways so I'd be surprised if a significant number of people saw it.
Even so, THAT may be a case of going overboard in emphasizing sex.  But
something honest like, "Wow, I had a really cool time talking and dancing
with you tonight, Jane - where are you going afterward?  What's your phone
#?  Do you need a ride home?" etc.... why is this frowned upon?  It almost
seems facetious to refuse to answer these questions, almost an implied,
"Well, I'll be your friend and love you, but only at a rave and while I'm
on E".  :(:(  People have to learn to *trust* their emotions.

There's more to say but I can't formulate thoughts right now...

I find it extremely sad that in this country we are preoccupied with nudity
and its association to sex.  I believe these ideas are programmed responses
stemming from the moral majority's view of nudity==pornography.  And perhaps
even this stems from personal insecurities.  Anything that is repressed will
fester into an ugly sore on society.

If we were all more accustomed to nudity in our lives - through art, on the
beach, at home - I don't think we would harbor these ill feelings.  Is it
really human nature to have these petty hangups?  Why can other countries
enjoy the sensual freedom of nudity without fear of sexual aggression?  Are
we all in this country of the same mentality as the HE HAW redneck portrayed
by Pete in his post?

I won't argue against those that are offended by nudity, because these are
learned responses that are really opposing the attitudes associated with
nudity not that nudity itself is necessarily bad.  Exploitation of the human
body for any purpose will obviously breed contempt - and women have taken
the brunt of that abuse.

Well Brian I think it's just us pent up and repressed americans (maybe
brits as well) who are into this thing about sex.  As far as I'm
concerned, there's NEVER enough sex.  But sex to me is a sacred energy.
That doesn't mean I won't get it on with a cutie in the back seat of a
car parked behind 177 Townsend, but it does mean that  one-nighters are
not my "prime directive" for a night of raving.  For me, raving
generates A LOT of sexual energy but that doesn't mean you have to go
fuck somebody with it.  Still I've often been in the delemma of being
attracted to a woman at a rave and knowing that she was attracted to me
and actualy thinking about suggesting that we  sneak off together to
the chill-out room... then Jeno will drop the PHATTEST beat I've ever
heard and I just CANNOT LEAVE the dance floor, so it goes.  But I do
think you're right, I've noticed that most hardcore ravers, including
myself ARE single, not always by choice.  I think for me, I know that
at this stage in my life, a relationship will only work if the other
person is a raver,  because of my age, there are not a lot of women in
my general age group that can keep up with me.  I have dated people as
young as 21 and that is fine for friendship and even sex but
eventually, our age differences tend to get in the way. Sometimes it's
easier to just remain single.

Boy, what an interesting topic...  I've really noticed, too, that the
"let's all hang out and enjoy ourselves and not have this be a meat
market" attitude prevalent at many raves and with many ravers can
hamper what would otherwise be a good place to meet people who are
sexually interesting to you and have similar interests.  Maybe I'm
just hung up on this, but I doubt it, it's probably not just me...

On the other hand, I've just recently been majorly turned off by two
things --- a) guys who attend raves apparently solely to chase women
and b) the use of drugs at raves as an excuse for "losing inhibitions"
and going to bed with someone.  These things definitely happen in the
scene and might be a reason for the aforementioned "hang out but don't
pick up" attitude among many.

On a slighly weirder note, I've recently decided that I'm going to be
celibate until I meet a woman who I really want to have a relationship
with.  (For me, this is pretty revolutionary...  I can never get too
much sex.)  I guess I'm joining the "hang out but don't pick up"
crowd...

I'm too close to things to really analyze why I'm feeling this way,
but I think it has something to do with needing to differentiate
myself from behavior I don't like.  I don't know about how much of
this decision is influenced by AIDS, but that's probably a factor too.
Maybe I'm just becoming a rave-scene conformist.

   some DeepLeftField rave idears are taking over aren't they?

     to me, rave isn't (wasn't) about 'Community' in the SantaCruz/
     Berkeley(?) overloaded sense. It was physically distancing
     ourselves from the rest. A self-effacement from old ways.

     It wasn't a 'movement' again in the hyperbolic terms popular
     here (in SF? in sfraves?). It was verification that we are
     in the prologue to post-industrial/info-centric/etcet culture.

     No races, no tribes, no diversity, except the smallest
     differentiations -- the vibe vs. diversity duality expressed
     here is so arrogant. It's like an artist calling him(her!)self
     living art or an activist believing they can shortcut 
     (read 'revolutionize') society.

     Once rave is above street level, and the 'celeBRATs' semantics
     are up there with 'culturual diversity' wet-lib pc schlock, 
      it dies.

     The pirates in IRC Warez group are our new leaders. THEY will
     make music a universal again. The're in touch with the viseral
     thrills of being current more than any drug-poppin' conscious-
     raising altruzealot who misses the functionality of the
     rebelous rave.

      last notes: The Beloved is heap good. The album 'Happiness' is
      better than 'Conscious,' but the import 'Blissed Out' is best.
      
      drug users always think they're a movement. it's self-validating.

        That was _supposed_ to be a really good show as well, but
unfortunately, they just never got enough of a critical mass of the

        Hmm... this sounds like an atypical show, although mebbe the fact
that this was outdoors allowed it to get a little more spread out than
normal.

        The nudity, etc. is a fairly usual part -- along with the people
actually on stage, CW also brings along about a half dozen or so people who
strip down to loincloths and cover themselves in bodypaints -- they're the
ones who bring out the torches, pyrotechnics, etc. among the crowd. The
hoses are to cool people down -- it gets rather hot down in the pit.

        No need to be scared -- if you fall down, you won't get trampled

Those are both cases of carrying something that could be a good thing
to an ugly extreme.... and are both exhibited by people who haven't 
necessarily "got it" yet.  ("It" being that purposefully vague
term for "understanding what the situation is about and how to deal
with it" - aka "knowlege", "wisdom", or maybe even "slack".)  I think
it's mainly the guys in a) doing the b).  

It's almost as if.... in high schools and colleges, alcohol consumption
is the norm.  Alcohol makes some people bolder in their attempts to lure
the opposite sex... they feel more attractive and more confident.  Now
when they hear about "raves", and about how many people use drugs at them,
they must think, "wow, the scamming there MUST be really high!".  I've
personally been siting with a girl in a chillout room, and another guy
comes in, sits down, doesn't say a word, smiles, and start rubbing her
stomach... neither she or I were dosed on anything, so it must have been
a big surprise to him when she slapped him and asked what the hell he
was doing :)

I'm really turned off by them too, and there's more and more of them
every week.... but it seems most leave after 2:30 or 3 (when the bars
close or when they get tired of trying), but those who stay usually
get closer and closer to "it".  I find the activites of a) doing b)
becomes much less noticeable after 3 or so....

If only more of them would start dancing... with their eyes CLOSED...and
get into the music, which is really why we're there in the first place!

Subject: a new view of ComeUnity

Sorry this is long...

After a few days to absorb the experience and clean off my desk at work,
here are my first impressions. By Bart, Bus and Taxi I finally arrived
at my first rave, better known as Come/Unity, and managed to get in even
without my ID (which IUd lost the night before.) I made a point of
getting familiar with the many spaces inside (BTW, saw Bruce Eisner on
my tour) then headed for the main room to join up in the dance. I was
delighted to see so many blissed out souls jumping and twirling,
laughing and touching, and I spent at least two hours just dancing and
smiling with people (so many different funny and wonderful flavors of
people). Except for a few slumped over shadows in some doorways, I
didnUt see anyone who looked like they werenUt enjoying themselves at
least a little. The screens floating above me were blinking out good
vibes and visualsQkaleidoscope mandalas, morphing montages, cryptic
collages and simply beautiful mantras: one mind, heal body, one
flow...After waiting for an hour for the break in the music so I could
get some water, I realized that there would be no break and after 15
more minutes, I managed to dance out the door before I collapsed. My
first trip into the Bermuda Room hosted by the Ambient Temple of
I-Magi-Nation took me into an archetypal inner-space I have not been to
in a while. Synergy was amazing IMHO, and sometimes the music there
(forgive me I know not what) was deeply but pleassantly disturbing 
(Though I believe I told Brian something about wanting to find
the chill room - this is the chill room! - I guess I had expected
something like EnoUs background music.) I waited for the healing
ceremony, and thought I might have missed it, so I did a dance and chant
for Malachy on my own. Shortly thereafter it started
and I was completely overwhelmed by the way it focused (most) everyoneUs
energy. At first I thought Malachy must be a Buddhist  due to the guides
chosen for the event (or Greek or a Magi I guess..)I had initially expected
something where we all joined hands in  a circle and did our own chant,
but MalachyUs message via video was moving and, well, it seemed almost
holy.Thanks to MykL for everything including introducing me to so many
of you, Brian, a couple of MikeUs, Gunter, Ann, Lee, etc etc and IUm
fairly bad with names picked up in passing. (Hey Bob Ramstad, I heard
you were there, sorry I missed you!) One thing I was wondering about: at
GD shows there is the ultimate in chill rooms: a paramedics tent and a
bunch of truly kind people whoUve Rbeen there beforeS and are happy to
spend a couple of hours talking if you need it. Do raves ever have
anything like this? And does anyone think something like this would be
welcome? (I believe I saw one person being taken out by strecher, but
what about simple problems like dehydration and twisted ankles?)

I guess one of my favorite moments was dancing in the early morning with
day breaking through the vestibules and lighting up the ecstatic faces,
then everyone holding hands and shouting when it was all over. Now I can
hear the beat everywhere - in cars passing me in the street, in the 
rumble of the CalTrain, in the spinning of my hard drive...My blessings
on the Tribe...See you soon.

	Um... that may not be quite a good idea, Lee -- IRC (Internet Relay
Chat) also allows for file transfers, that are essentially untraceable.
"Warez" is a euphemism for pirated software, as is "filez" -- IRC and an
ftp-like protocol called FSP are often used in this manner. Avoid this,
unless you, too want YOUR copy of the Windoze NT beta, followed quickly by a
phone call from the Friendly Persuaders from SPA...

Yes! we need this desperately,  if you know people from the GD scene
who would be willing to jump start something like that for the rave scene
it would be most helpful.  I always do what I can to talk to those
"shadows" slumped in the corner and to make sure they are all right.
But we need it to be a more co-ordinated effort.  I was talking to the 
security guys about this, especially at a large rave, it would be nice if
we had a "super chill-out" room where understanding and trained people
could offer water, maybe a little fruit but mostly kind words and some basic
first aid.

Yeah early morning is my favorite time as well, as the sun rises and
all of the other living things around greet the new day.  I feel after
a night of dancing that I've got my job done and the rest of Gaia can take
over now.  As far as the Beat is concerned, it IS everywhere, when you discover
this, it is the "trailhead" to living your life in a perpetual estactic
state (and I'm not talking about drugs here), all you have to do, at any moment
is to surrender to the beat and the vibe and let it take you.

Well I for one have LOOKED at the venues avaialbe, and if it means tyhat I
have to throw a party in the same place , EACH time I throw a party, then it
is not worth my while.  I try to find different spaces for every event.
That is what keeps things a bit fresh.

As for a boycott, good luck.  Remeber, MOST ravers are 18+.  And if they can
get in to a party, they will go in (for the most part). 

The BEST way to solve your dilemma is the legislative route.  Boycotts are
generally ineffective, esp. on this scene where there are many diverse
interest and reasons for partying.

Subject: sex n stuff

Wow, now this is something that I can honestly say I have thought about
a lot at parties, before and after...

I remember for a time when I first started going to these things, I was
more than a little interested in meeting someone cool to hang out
with and to dance with and to actually relate with who happened to 
be female...
now, as I got more into the scene, I find myself unable to really get into
a classical sexual relationship.  When I am raving, I am raving for everyone,
and I am very rarely (except at 6-7 in the morning) in the same place for
more tan five minutes.  Now, this is a farily recent event. When Basics
were still around, I was able to chill and dance with people and talk with
people whenever I wanted....then again, the blinking red light was something
new, not like today, so I rarely get asked to help people discover
blinking lights these days....but I digress...

truth is, I find myself focusing much more on the music and becoming more
into a personal trip, which is not bad at all, since I think I need this sort
of house-induced self-realization once in while, especially as I approach
graduating from college, and starting to figure out what I want to do...so
this is good...

It seems that lots of people at Come/Unity were very into their own groups,
and I didn't notice a lot of people actively going out and meeting people.  This
could be because of the size, my energy, I don't know.  all I know is that
I am beginning to miss the random hugs that used to be prevalent in the
scene...however, all is not lost.  I did find someone that I really just
sort of madly fell for, but that was at Vision, and alas, she was not
anywhere to be found a come/unity...hopefully Channeling?  

Things are odd.  Anyway, brian brings up a good point, and I am not sure
I clarified it or anything, but at least you had something to read.

see this is what i hate about the PC sex thing; you're either a wimpy

feeling guilty or you're immediately labeled "joe bob" and assumed to

only because of well, a "lust for life" if you will.  i am in no way
supportive of people abusing, judging, or otherwise discriminating
against others on the basis of race, gender, religion, sexual preference,
and sometimes even "socio-economic class" [tho *some* rich motherfuckers
really piss me off].  i do not condone butt pinching et al, but absolutely
do condone, practise and encourage forward sexual behavior, by anyone toward
any CONSENTING partner.  this doesn't mean that i can't and many women can't
deal with people on a sexual level, including allowing one's self to be 
appreciated as a purely sexual entity, a "sex object", (oooh, aaaagh, the
~evil~ sex object concept...).  there is a BIG difference between
what you describe above and being able to avoid being offended
by a video image of a belly dancer.  i honestly believe that you are
approaching this problem in such a way as to have the effect of suppressing
much more than just what you want to suppress; it reminds me of the unholy
alliance of feminists and fundamentalist christians in their combined "war
on porn", the effect of which is plain and simple sexual repression as
oppsosed to suppression of mysogyny, which i assume from your flaming
post is what your goal is, something with which i can hardly disagree.

i disagree totally with you on the issue of how to deal with it.  i would
rather see equal time given to images "designed" to appeal to straight
women, gay women, gay men, different body types etc. than to suggest that
projecting an image of a belly dancer is "uncool" and should not be allowed.

in all fairness, i have to admit to something of an email sucker-punch, i
knew from some of the comments that this PC sex thang is/was going on and
that i'd probably get a reaction like that above if i said what i said.  
i did it anyway cuz i'm real tired of what i see as an ineffective approach
to resolving issues of sexual bigotry;  i prefer to offer alternatives to
the straight (usually white) male oriented image of a straight (usually white)
woman than to prohibit it.  get me?

One of the things you might hope for from a "boycott", as
you insist on calling this, is that the promoters and
managers of different venues might get behind you in your
efforts to work on the legislature.  

Which is to say that it isn't a one or the other thing. 

The effectiveness of boycotts in general is a complicated
subject... I could probably come up with examples that work,
if only by generating publicity.  And you don't have to
convince *everyone* to follow a boycott, if some place loses
only a few percent of their business that can be a lot. 

But anyway, I'm not calling for a boycott of age restricted
raves... I'm just suggesting that we should be conscious of
it, look for some other options, and think twice about
giving them our money.  

(Hm. "MOST raves are 18+"?  I wonder if this is because of the
age-restrictions, rather than due to them?  So maybe there's
already a market their that some promoters might be going
after, if they weren't afraid of the stigma of being a
"teenie" event?)

Anyway, I don't feel real comfortable with the "Every raver
for himself" attitude.

	I was talking to some security and to some cops at ComeUnity
	about the under age issue.  What they mostly had to say were
	interesting, I'll summarize:

	1) Many didn`t care one way or another but felt that the crack
	down in SF stemmed SOLELY from pressure put on the force by 
	PARENTS.  It wasn't about 18 yr. olds but if you keep 18 year
	old out then it is even harder for the 16 year olds to get in.

	2) Many cops don't care about the 21+ people doing the substances
	"If they want to fuck up their minds..." was a directr quote but
	they DO care about under agers imbibing drugs.  Since drugs are
	already illegal the  only way they can control access of these
	substances to minors is to make it hard for minors to go.

	3) Let us not fool ourselves, the Cops know what goes on at raves,
	most of them also know that raves are not dangerous in the same
	way that a "rap" concert can turn out to be.  The age repression
	is because of the availability of controlled substances.  they
	see this as a "compromise" look we arn't trying to tell "legal
	age" adults what to do but people under age are a different story.

	I donno, maybe we can't have our cake and eat it too.  If E or A were

Subject: nudity


Part of the problem with semi/nudity at raves is that it puts you in a
very obvious minority, and your dealings with other people are then not
from a perceived position of strength.  An interesting turnaround would
be a clothing-optional rave where the people IN clothes were occasionally
given odd looks and disparaging comments about being repressed.

Nudity today is as much a taboo as interracial mingling used to be, and
(sadly) in a few places still is.  There is always risk to those who
are in the vanguard of challenge -- and the possibility for great 
reward.  Given the right setting and set o' folks, we might find out that
there is nothing left to hide -- and never was.  For those who lament the
demise of "dangerous" underground events, this can be your new frontier.

We're talking ourselves out onto a limb here.  Who's going to volunteer
to saw it off and dunk us all into the river?

Subject: Interested in StartUp??

Hello Everyone,


Last week, a few of us began discussing ideas
for a start-up company.  I am still interested
in the possibilities and think that some kind
of brainstorming meeting might be the best next
step.  


After what happened with those poor snowboarders,
I think it'd be good to keep this topic off of
SFRaves.  So, I ask that those interested send
me e-mail with the following info:

1.  Skills <optional>
2.  Interests <optional>
3.  Other <optional>
4.  Best evening/time to meet <Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday> 
5.  Preferred location <SanFran/Peninsula/SanJose>
    [If we do it on the Peninsula, we can probably
     meet at my place in PaloAlto......We could
     even make it a bit of a party :)]
6.  Suggestions <are welcome>


On Monday, I will send mail to everyone that has
responded telling them:  

1) Time/Location of meeting
2) Overview of Skill/Interests/Other (from above) for 
each person.  This way we all come having a general 
idea of what each person is thinking.


...Well, I guess that's it...

Thanks, 
Ravi


ps.  So far, my not-so-accurate records show that
Chris Hart, Mykl G., Brian S., Jessica, OUR FRIEND MIKE,
and one-more-person-whose-name-I-don't-recall have 
expressed interest.  Just so you know I haven't
lost track of you.... but mail me anyways to be safe!

I've experienced that at Pennsic, the SCA's really big war. About
5-6000 people show up. When it gets really hot, you can often see
30-70 people down at the creek, bathing Medieval style. Clothes kind
of stand out then. I was shy at first, but after a while it felt
really good. It's kind of neat talking with people when they have no
clothes on :). I made some good friends down there (and during the
rest of the war, there's a strong sense of family there - you would
love it).

I dunno about dancing though... techno is really high energy, and that
kind of movement is probably painful for the braless after a while.

But I wouldn't care one way or the other. Once you've hung out with a
bunch of nude people for a while, it's no big deal. I love being nude
outside. Feels great. I'd do it all the time if it were Socially
Acceptable.

Well, all you horny (and not so horny) party people, I have to tell you that
as a gay man going to a "traditional" rave, partners are not even an option, for
the most part, at raves. I'm very happy to go to raves for the music, the
dance, and the camraderie, but must you all be quite so demonstrative of your
heterosexuality? :-)

I saw an article in the NY Times awhile ago ...  it said, essentially,
that colds are not easily transmittable by mouth-to-mouth contact or
by someone coughing around you.  (that's because the mouth is pretty
good at killing viruses.  This is why it's hard to catch AIDS by
French kissing.)  Most colds apparently get transmitted nose-to-nose
or nose-to-eye (with some hands as intermediate carriers.).  The
article suggested:

1) DON'T cover your mouth/nose when coughing or sneezing.  This just
   gets germs on your hands.
2) Try to avoid touching your nose and eyes (or use a tissue or something
   when you do).

Sooo ...  sharing your water bottle when you have a cold should be ok.
(of course, there are other non-cold nasties that do get transmitted
mouth to mouth.)

Subject: The Compleat Amsterdam (long)


Hi gang, just got back from Amsterdam last week.  I've finally
recovered enough to send in a review of the scene there.  Fortunately,
staying up til 4:00 or 5:00 every night made the adjustment to
California time way easy.

Overall, the music was great.  A lot of trance house, not too much
techno.  Very similar to what I hear here, but not often things I'd
heard before.  The crowds seemed similar to the crowds here.  All
around a comfortable scene.  I felt (almost) at home, apart from not
knowing Dutch!  Most of the clubs were "members only" but I rarely had
trouble getting in.

It was Easter weekend, which means that most people had the Friday the
Monday off.  Definite party time.  Thanks to pointers from Aaron and 
Jessica I managed to find Black Beat records and the Wild Shop (rave 
clothing) fairly quickly and picked up some fliers.  The cool thing 
about the record stores is that they let you listen to CDs before buying 
them.  I liked that.

I never made it to a true rave, but did visit a number of clubs that I
liked a lot.  The true raves all seemed to be too much of a hassle,
involving shuttle busses and boats, ortrains out to the boondocks.  I
opted instead for the easily located clubs.  Another reason I stayed
away from some of the raves is that some of the fliers were in Dutch.
This (I was told) meant that the promoter was targeting high school
kids (not to be ageist) who didn't know English well enough yet.
Everyone there spoke English (except the high school kids, I guess).

My Wednesday evening there I checked out a small club called Mazzo.
Good music, with cool DJs and trippy visuals.  The space was about the
same size as the End Up, without the outdoor patio.  Unfortunately,
the crowd was small (50 people), but I left around midnight.  It was
more of a hangout than a rave.  They did have a smart bar, tho'.

Thursday evening I checked out the Roxy (THE club in A'dam), the night
before the 4-day weekend.  I had been warned that it was hard to get
in.  After casing the joint from outside, I tried getting in.  The
doorman asked me if I was a member (in english).  "No, how do I become
a member?"  "Sorry, we haven't sold memberships for two years."  "OK,"
and I left.  I crossed the street and watched for a bit longer.  The
doorman saw me and motioned me to come back over.  He said he thought
the people behind me were with me and he didn't like the look of them,
so he didn't let me in.  Once he realized I was alone, I was in.

The space was an old theater and was fairly big.  The people were
definitely the "in" crowd, but "in" in this case included ravers, as
well as club kids.  Still, a fair amount of variation.  They must have
a broad range of "members."  Very few shirtless men (or women, for
that matter).  Anyway, the light show was totally spotlights (and some
video), with no Intellibeams or lasers or anything else that moved.
Still, it was pretty cool, considering the lack of technology.

There didn't seem to be signs of many people on X (but lots of pot).
This was later explained to me.  Apparently a few months ago the Dutch
government decided to find out what the kids were taking at the clubs.
They set up booths at all the big raves where you could take your pill
or capsule and have it analyzed anonymously.  What they found was that
the "X" was mostly speed.  They then told the newspapers, and the
newspapers told everyone to stop buying the X -- that they should wait
for the good stuff if they were going to buy it.  Interesting.

At 2:00, a performance started.  The club that night was called
"womb".  The show involved a small platform being lowered from the
100' ceiling with a 4' diameter sphere cradled on it.  The music was
ambient heart-beat with ethereal backgrounds.  The top of the sphere
opened and a primeval-looking nude (!) man proceeded to birth himself
from the sphere.  It was quite amusing, with all his gesticulations
and moans/screams/etc.  A few minutes later he reached back in the
sphere and pulled out another primeval-looking nude (!!) man.  After a
few minutes of choreographed surprise and wonder, they picked up
amplified digeridoos and made odd noises for another few minutes
before disappearing back in the sphere, which got pulled back up into
the ceiling.  Highly entertaining, all around.

Friday evening, wanting to see some of the gay nightlife (being, gay
and all, you know) decided to check out Club IT, which I had been told
was THE gay club in A'dam.  It was a mess.  I left after 20 minutes.
It looked like all the cool people got into the Roxy and the rest were
left to go to Club It.  Club It had also (apparently) advertised to
the tourists, because it was even worse than a bad Friday night at the
Sound Factory.  Too bad the music was so good.  The light show was
again lacking anything that moved.

Saturday, back to Mazzo, where it was happening this time.  Again, it
was members only, which I hadn't realized until two people came up
behind me and a read a sign (in Dutch) that said "Members Only".
They, of course, exclaimed this to each other in English, while I
obliviously paid my way in.  The place was packed.  The crowd was cool.
(I was thrown off guard by a couple 14 year old boys, though.  "Cool!
-- lesbians!" I thought to myself before realizing what was going on.)
The music was great.  The lightshow was nearly non-existent.  Had fun.

That was pretty much it, as far as clubbing and music goes.  Spent the
rest of the time hopping from museum to museum and cafe to cafe.  In
case any of you find yourselves in Amsterdam, here is a list of
pertinent places:

Records stores:
Blackbeat, Nieuwedijk 104
Dance Tracks, Nieuwe Niewstraat 69

Clubs:
Mazzo, Rozengracht 114
The Roxy, Singel 465

Subject: MDMA Survey


A cool psychiatrist friend of mine in New York is doing a study on the use of
MDMA.  He's been handing out copies of this survey at raves in New York and
distributing it through e-mail.  Thought I'd pass it on to anyone out there who
might be interested in contributing to science.

Share and Enjoy,

Tim

==============================================================================

***Disclaimer:  Delete this message now if you are not 
interested in a survey on the usage of MDMA(Ecstasy).****

Dear E-mail subscriber

I am currently a resident in psychiatry at The College of 
Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University in New York 
and I need your help.  I am interested in MDMA, better known 
as Ecstasy, which has been used both as a therapeutic and 
recreational agent.  I have assembled a questionnaire which 
concerns both the settings and the effects of using Ecstasy.  

I realize that this rave mailing list may not be the right 
place to discuss the use of illegal substances, but in order 
to get the widest possible distribution of the survey, it 
makes sense to include those of us interested in the rave 
scene.

There are a lot of myths and misinformation about the drug 
and a lack of good clinical data about it.  I hope that this 
survey will help answer a few of the questions about Ecstasy 
and its' use.  You'll be contributing to science. 

If you have ever used the drug, I'd be eternally grateful if 
you'd take approximately 10-15  minutes and fill out the 
questionnaire. 

You have, if you are interested, two options to fill this 
out.  The easiest way is to answer the questions on your e-
mail and send it back to me.  My e-mail address is 
dmm6@Columbia.edu (128.59.40.130). The answers will be 
strictly confidential; The header will be automatically 
deleted electronically and thus I will be unable to identify 
respondents.  You will automatically remain anonymous.  The 
other alternative is that you can print it out, fill out the 
responses and send them to me at the following address:

				David McDowell  MD.
				Box 97
				New York State Psychiatric Institute
				Columbia University
				722 West 168th Street
				New York,  NY  10032

I would be really appreciative if you could forward the 
survey to anyone who might be interested.  Also if you have 
any questions or comments about our work or the survey, send 
them along as well, but with those remember to include your 
address as that will be the only way I'll be able to respond.

I thank you very much for your help and effort.


					Sincerely, 


					Dave McDowell MD.

Subject: this weeks RAVE guide

	Friday - Movement has a really good lineup, but this Island Universe
thing could prove to be interesting.... but maybe Friday night would be
a good chance to show me how outdated my calendar is by checking out some
of the weeklies :)

	Saturday - good things were said about the last Channeling, but if
I were going to be in town this weekend, I'd hit Fields of Joy - supposedly
it'll be in a field north of SF, all permits obtained, and the video link
with a sister rave in Boston, and the DJ lineup sounds great.  If you're
really jonesing for a multi-day outdoor bonanza you could try Wally World;
despite their reputation I've heard this one is their stab at regaining
some credit, so it could prove worthwhile, and the counter-rave, the free
A Child Is Born, looks good too....

	And I hate to sound like a broken record, but the park SHOULD
be going off this Sunday - call the info line to make sure.  

	Have fun!

	Brian

Subject: what IT is to me

Hi-all!!

i'm going to keep this from becoming a long rant n rant.  i'm going to
list some of the ideas that i feel in one of the compact list forms for
ez reading.  This is in response to the discusion of what been runnig
thru the net lately.

WHY I STARTED TO GO TO *RAVES* (a term i don't like to use, in private
with you guys its ok)
*1, im a parinoid kinda of human, at a rave i feel *safe*. no B.S. with
assholes who want to fight and the whole weapons scene.

*2, i could meet people w/o that meat-market garbage.  people will
actually  talk to you even if between the two you there is no intention
of sex.  amazing.  i've been to some really meat-markets (mostly by
accident) when i've been wanting and desperate for a beat and dance.  at
a meat-market i can't meet anyone because before i can talk to them they
have to decide if they want to phuck me or not. after which i don't want
to talk to them any more.

*3, the people that i did meet were cool on many levels.  they had jobs
and generally had their shit together.  they went to a rave because they
wanted to have fun not to be part of some *cool sub-culture* (this is
not always the case anymore).  

*4, the *SOOOOO-TOUGH* garbage was not cool and usually disappeared by
2-3 am after the booze shut down.

*5, MOST IMPORTANTLY I HAD MORE FUN THAN I CAN THINK OF FROM ANY OTHER
VENUE.  how else can i say it? so i wont try.

since its late at night (when else do I have time for this) im ending
that list here.
this thing is cool and special.  i annot fathom the amount life it has
left in it but i think that we can do a lot to determine that.  SECRETS
have more apeal to me then a big open thing.  I think the fickle media
has had their fun at our expense and will move on.  Rave is not a new
thing to them any more.  tring to expose *Joe Public* to the good points
of a rave will not change their mind.  it is too much of a personal
experience. how many people have you meet who say after a really good
party that *i have finally been to a rave* even though if you talk to
them before they were sure that they had been to a rave (and not had
great time).  There are to big reasons to be on the covert side that i
see.  1) when i started i had a guide group of people.  people to help
introduce the whole idea and w/o them even knowing it helping keeping
he peace and the vibe.  i've been to radio advertised parties where
guns were brought and gang b.s. was in the air.  2) if the tribal
aspects are to be kept then there must be an aspect of seperation for
the normal socity.  for a ritual to be effective it must seem that there
is some part of it that is not able to easily gotten to by everyone.

I'd rather risk death by self-inflicted accident than death by boredom.
Many people I know are dead but they're still walking around.

American society has no initiation ceremony by which one passes into
adulthood, usually through proving oneself equal to a harsh and risky
trial.  We are simultaneously repelled and attracted to freedom from 
the Ego, dreading yet fervently desiring the loss of control which often
leads to the gain of insight through transcendent ecstasy; the shamanistic
trance.  We are rediscovering the possibility of releasing this energy
that is simultaneously denied and termed "evil" by those who would control
us.  Someday we will learn to direct this energy, but this takes a 
strange (to us) kind of control that we have not had for millenia if at all.
For now, establishing the validity of the experience is often a
sufficient challenge, which I accept; but, reward cannot come without 
risk.  Our society has taken it upon itself to abolish risk, and with
it, the possibility of such a reward.  But, we _are_ society, and must
change ourselves first --> Catch-22 if you accept its rules.

Most of us can't even ditch the Super-ego.  You can see the problem.

Live, love, rave.  Try it totally straight.  The rush can be even more
intense. // g

Subject: What you should know about the Wiretap (clipper) Chip


	I've debated over whether to post any info on this subject

	back.  I think I've reached a compromise with this post,
	if you want to know more, e-mail me privately.  I AM posting

Vol. 13, No. 74; Pg. 2
 
Clinton Sets Policy Review
 
GOVT. WEIGHS IN ON PRIVACY-VS.-ENCRYPTION DEBATE, WITH ITS OWN TECHNOLOGY
 
 
   Clinton Administration Fri. announced sweeping policy directive designed to
protect privacy of voice and data transmissions using govt.-developed encryption
technology that ensures law enforcement agencies will have ability to eavesdrop.
Encyrption is achieved through use of " Clipper Chip"  that will be built into
telephones, computers, fax machines. Although govt. will adopt new chip as its
standard, use in private sector will be on voluntary basis.
 
		[stuff deleted]
   President Clinton Thurs. signed Top Secret National Security Directive
outlining details of privacy and encryption policy review. Review will bring
together industry and govt. experts under direction of National Security Council
in attempt to resolve long-running controversy on right of businesses and
citizens to protect all forms of communication and govt. right to conduct lawful
investigations. Review will take 3-4 months, NIST's Kramer said.
 
   Law enforcement agencies are concerned about rising popularity of digital
encryption methods. Multinational businesses, worried about economic espionage,
increasingly are incorporating encryption technology for all communications. Law
enforcement agencies have voiced growing concern that if they don't move quickly
to enact laws assuring them access to encrypted and digital communications, they
will be at decided disadvantage in attempting to thwart criminal acts. FBI
spokesman James Kallstrom acknowledged that "not many" criminals today are using
encryption to skirt law, but putting methods in place now to assure means of
intercepting such communications "is vital" to law enforcement's mission.
 
			[stuff deleted]

   Plan already is drawing fire from civil liberties groups and privacy
advocates. Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said White House acted "before
any public comment or discussion has been allowed." It said Administration will
use "its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt" technology.
EFF criticized govt.'s sole-source contract, saying there may be other companies
that have better encryption technology, and because encryption algorithm is
classified, it can't be tested. "The public will only have confidence in the
security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny," EFF said.
Privacy experts are concerned that because  Clipper Chip  was developed under
NSA contract, it might have "backdoor" known only to NSA that would allow agency
to crack code and bypass court order. Kramer disagreed: "There is positively no
backdoor to this technology."

make sure you follow this with AT LEAST ONE BLANK LINE or the remailer
will get confused and your message will not get delivered.
Note that the "::" IS necessary.  This should be the first two lines of your

Another method, for you mail hackers is to put the field:

right in the message Header.
If you have a mailtool program use the first method.

here is a list of remailer sites. so your survey answers should be sent TO

It felt really weird to read this. I've been going through a lot of
self-discovery lately, especially regarding the Ego. It was at my
first rave that I was really able to rattle it loose for a while, and
see myself from the other side. The next morning I wrote down in my
notebook:

     "Ego is trading everything you want for everything you fear."

I'm an extraordinarily self-controlled person. I've been growing in my
spirituality for years, and I've been aware that something is holding
me back. At that rave, I held that ego away from me for the first time
since I was a child, and was able to let go and express all those
things inside.

Now I have a perspective I didn't have before, and there are now
avenues of growth I'd never seen before. I'm a little more comfortable
with myself. I can recognise "me" in the mirror. I know now what it's
like to open that channel to my inner self and have fun, no holds
barred, don't think about it, just open up your soul to the two way
transfer. I can't tell you how precious that knowledge is to me.

Someday I hope I can find some others with the same experience and
talk about it. That would be really nice.

Subject: House Music Archives?

Howdy all. In my all but sublime ignorance, I rarely if ever know what it is
that I am listening to while I'm having such a great time dancing etc. Being
on mission to amass a collection of great house/techno etc. both past and
present, on 12"s I find this unfortunate. While listening to every disk in
every record store is one way to go about solving this problem, I still
misght never know if I was holding an absolute classic in my greasy little
palms. Upon consideration it seemed to me that it might not be unlikely that
somewhere there is an archive of the all time great house music. If such a
thing exists and is ftp-able I would love to know where it is. If not
perhaps we should start one. So if people have suggestions for candidates of
said list and would like to forward them to me, I would be more than happy
to begin compiling the Master List.

As a convention perhaps we could do:
Disk Title
Artist
Label
Brief (3-5 lines) description

Suggestions are of course more than welcome...

peace, and let the good vibe rave.

otherwise, who cares?  just keep it in your pants unless she's into it, but

Silent Records has released a 2-CD set, titled "50 years of Sunshine", to 
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the discovery of LSD.  The music varies 
from ambient-industrial to gothic rock to techno.  There are tracks from 
various sfravers: an unreleased track by The Ultraviolet Catastrophe, at 
least one track that features drum programming by Markie, and a few tracks 
that Genesis P-Orridge was involved with (including an unreleased Psychic TV 
track).  Also featured on the compilation are Timothy Leary, Nurse With Wound,
Controlled Bleeding, Hawkwind, and 68000.

Or you can get it directly from Silent.  They do mail order.  Their phone

Thanx for sharing Sean.

The ego is a weird thing to deal with.  You kinda need one to have an
identity, or perspective from with you can make day to day, or even
long term decisions with.  But at the same time, too much focus on one's
ego tends to cut you off from the rest of the world and from all the
possible ways you can grow, discover and explore new things.  People
who are insecure about their place in the Universe often spend a lot
of energy trying to build egos and often end up building walls around
themselve to protect what fragile ego supporting structures that they do
have.  This can be self-defeating because they then have cut off access 
to new material (i.e. life experiences) from which egos get built.  So 
ironically, I have found that it is often the case that people with 
strongly developed egos, are the ones who are secure enough to let go of 
them.

ON the other hand, I'm not convinced that pure selflessness can
work as a way of life in this world.  If we want to deal effectively with
reality, I think we need to develope character, egos, attitudes, 
relationships, points-of-view, emotional hangups, etc.  As long as we 
don't cling too tightly to them we can still bring them to parties and 
laugh as we stomp them into the ground.  Egos, once they reach a critical
mass, are pretty selfperpetuating, and because of this, they don't need
much care (although it is good to slap them around now and then so that
they don't get any bigger than necessary).  I know too many people
with poorly developed identities who seem to just float through life
like lost souls that continuously avoid reflecting on just how undefined
they are.  I'm not saying that this is wrong, just somewhat disconnected
from many of the things defined as "real". 

In conclusion, I like to view my ego as a launching pad for exploring
things that go beyond my particular perspective.  Raving, as a 
tribal/community thing where sensory stimulation and similarly
mind-expanding altered states of consciousness encourage us to focus 
beyond ourselves, is an activity where personal transcendance can safely
occur.

  So , is rave , to you , a celebration/confirmation of a future
 that renounces ties to the past? ( I'm trying to do the old English
 class trick of paraphrasing something in order to better understand
 it ). Are you anticipating a 'radiant future' ? Would you describe
 yourself as a neophile?
 
 While I do like flavors other than vanilla, strawberry and chocolate,
 but the point is separate. Functional/tender ravers, like their misanthrope
 orthoganal evil-counterparts, view society at large responsible, and  such
 no private sub-culture-music-drug made raves. Being in the proto-prologue
 of technocenter creates TAZs. Not century-old unshowered shamen/its. Nor
 them and their buddies. 
 
 To the core, the idea of people-centric instead of idea- (legit,comparable,
 and portable) centric power fuels the diversity falsehood. Yes, your [insert

 that is woefully supressed/confessed/but not redressed by 'Dominator'
 c(v)ulture (sfrave.text allusion) is the truest you, Ahem, roight.
 
   That is anecdotal. Widen the scope. Let the functionality ascend

  Do you mean "leaders" as being in the front of the pack , as the
 most valid 'avant-garde'? 
 
   Like all GOOD movements, they don't shortcut, they lead.
        
from bblehn:
The way I see it, what we're distancing ourselves from is the expectation
that society lays on us that we're all supposed to distrust each other,
be at each other's throats.  When you start getting tens of thousands of people
able to deprogram themselves from this behavior, I for one call it a movement.
 
from swierk: 
also: went off on SFraves-net.  aren't you just doing the same thing and
saying that this is what rave "is".  why can't it be the
mindless expression-fuck of a new drug subculture?
 
 O'course. But rave is of wider scope IMHO. First, the bounds 
 don't exist. Beyond, in our youth (ie (expected) rebellion) we realized
 that THE future is rebelious, idealized, etcet. We don't fight authority,
 we teach them to use their computers. All the difference.  
 
 Not 'frees' nor 'purges.' Too altrusitic. Healing is debased leading. 
  Again, rave IS rugged-out-a-limb behavior/living. Total inclusion
  = heap dysfunctional. Appreciation of the future is esoteric art.
                 RAVE EXISTS BECAUSE IT IS FUNCTIONAL
 
  Again , a hint of neophilia - "the visceral thrills of being current"
 
>     drug users always think they're a movement. it's self-validating.
 
  Depends on the drug and the era ... in any case , could you explain
 how "self-validating" comes into it?
 
   Self-validating (can be applied to all 'communites' euphemistically 
  defined, though somewhat to harsh methinks.) Is when, manifest
  dysfunctional passes (by side-effect (real/imagined)) as beneficial. 
  From NRA to HighTimes, it's really sad. Too bad these folks like to
  indentify with us. 
 
(Hey ,you're the same guy - I'll save "postage" and reply to your
 genderless post )
 
  In what ways will the future be genderless ? If you mean that gender
 roles will greatly overlap - I don't think so. In my opinion , people 
use gender roles to affirm/reinforce their own sense and appearence of 
 masculinity/femininity. 
 
  And why should a genderless future be of any advantage to gays/
 lesbians?
 
   Why do i have to do all the explaining?? Less genderizing, fewer
   distinct roles = overlapped socialized eroticism + need to 
   differentiate in more 'sophisticated' ways. Trivial proof.

I don't understand your use of the word "self-effacement" here. 
 
 That shrinking the world is direct altrusim. Noble, requires humility 
                              to carry out.

What is this "vibe vs. diversity duality"?  I see incredible diversity
at raves, plenty of races, tribes, shirtless males, etc.  The fact that
all these subgroups make eye contact and offer each other water, toys,
and backrubs is exactly what the vibe is about.  Again, where's the
contradiction?
 
     Unity as promoted is really a side-effect of earth-shrinking.
Not necessarily the product of raves. No, you don't *experience* diversity
(in the overloaded, "we are not who we are, but where we came from" spun
meaning), you experience unity. This, in my mind, is really just 'partying'
under another name. I think raving means more.

   No, Yes and No. I think if look closely rebellion/unity are the same
thing when it's u & frenz vs. moms&dads. Or larger scope but same semantics 
of ''deprogramming'' us  from oppressive them-meanies. And that's trendy.
 
   What trancends in rave? Rave is the theme song to a society happily
   making it's way to satori. It's not a shortcut there. Although
   the more who join us, the more who will be prepared for the future.
          That kind of road trip needs leaders. 
            I hope raves weren't a just map point to the future,
                but it could be.
 
And give us a break about drugs -- three of the most committed ravers I

Many people's sense of self/ego is determined by what others think of them.
This is not a stable foundation; most of the annoying people you see are
like this, as they need some reaction from other people to maintain
themselves.

Most people like this are trying to build themselves on the reactions of
others (as above) but are too timid to take the risks necessary to get
such reactions, and stay undefined.

hey,
is anybody from the sacramento area (or perhaps adventurous enough to make

he doesn't have any health insurance, so all of tonight's proceeds will go to
pay his bills. they're asking for a $10 donation. i can't guarantee it will
be good, but it's only $10 and i'm going to support my hometown scene. 

if anybody is interested, the # is (916) 449-3141

the directions it gives are from sacramento. if anybody wants to come and is
from davis or somewhere else west of sac., you take 80 east into sacramento.
then you stay on the freeway - it turns into business 80 (take business 80,
not 80 toward reno) from bus.80 take 50 east. the phone directions will guide
from there.

like i said, i'm not making any promises, i'm going and i promised i'd spread
the word.

hope some folks can make it

About the sex thing that Brian brought up, I think it's like that because 
everyone is ultra concious about raves not being the meat market sceen that
clubs are to the point that even when there is mutual attraction between people
it's generaly considered un-hip to hit on someone.  Another similar reason is that
because everyone is so nice and friendly, it's easy to get the wrong impression
and it might be real embarrasing and uncomfortable to hit on someone because you
thought it was O.K. and it wasn't.  That kind of thing tends to ruin formerly
platonic relationships so it's a big risk.  Is it worth possibly ruinging or
changing the vibe of this real good freindship? The ironic part is that it's like
everyone thinks that the other person doesn't want to be hit on when this is probably
not the case especialy at raves where you can expect that a person will tactfully
reject another and that the rejectee will probably not persist and be a jerk about it.

I'm sorry I'll have to respectfully disagree here but It's not just this country, it's
human reaction (I think, or maybe I'm just a perv).  I don't think I've been programmed
by anyone to be like this but if I see a nude body (female, but that's just me) I think
of sex.  If I see a killer veggie stir-fry I think of eating.  If I see warm sunny beach
I think of basking.  Get it?  It's just a primal reaction.  How could someone not think
of sex while looking at a nude body of their gender attraction?  That would be contrived.
It would take much control.  So much that I don't think a monk could do it (they just
wouldn't admit it).  In fact, you would think of it and THEN try to put it out of your mind
but you've already thought of it.  That means it's a natural reaction.  I don't think someone
should dwell on the subject mind you but like I said earlier, it's just a primal thought and
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

Subject: Re: malachy

(sorry this is so late, but I hope this still helps)

For those of you who don't know who Malachy is, here's da scoop:

	Malachy is perhaps the one person in the SF scene who most 
successfully embodies the basic tenets of the House Movement.  He is
a promoter, whose most famous gigs were the once-a-month Come/Unity
at 1015 Folsom, as well as El Rio, Mission Rock, and the Full Moons.
He's a friend of all people, a disbeliever in promoter politics and a 
supporter of ALL sides of the scene. He was a very spiritual person,
a non-denominational believer in the power of healing, a man whose
sheer power of love and acceptance transmitted itself through his 
actions.  His tragic accident the morning after the March Full Moon
party galvanized the promoters of the scene into action; it propelled
them into the realization that the scene needs to stop cutting its own 
throat and band together to help the healing, and to forge the power
of Come/Unity into a coherent, tangible, beneificial force upon the
San Francisco house music family.  The healing party thrown in his 
honor and for his benefit, Come/Unity on April 17th, was a landmark for
the scene.  As Malachy continues to heal, he is an inspiration to those
who know him and love him, and a signal to all others that behind all
this showbiz called the "rave scene" is the power of love and acceptance.
Shortly before his accident, Malachy said to a friend, "If anything bad 
happens, dance to make it better."  Right on.

p.s. - I wishwishwish something like this had been printed up and handed
out at Come/Unity.  Oh well.

  On thinking this idea over, I think there's something to it.  Not that
they are mutually exclusive; but different musics appeal to different

I think techno = mind music.  That's what got me into it and why I love it so much
and why I like good techno a little better than good house, which by the way would
be heart music to me, but I actualy think I feel a chemical response to hard, fast
blipy, torquey, funky, techno.  And I don't mean, industrial, goth, amsterdam type
stuff, it has to be warm and funky with lots of fat analogue base and high blipy 
computer-like sounds.  The "busyer" the better.  It's like a mild stimulant high
but cleaner.  I just feel my synapses start to snap.  It would be interesting to
monitor my brain wave activity in a control situation and then blast the walkman
and see what happens.

I have to agree with this.  I hope that my earlier post about thinking about sex
when seeing nude bodies isn't perceived as clashing with this.  I can and have
hot-tubbed, sun bathed, etc. nude because it's natural but so is thinking about 
sex.  I was trying to combat the idea sombody suggested that that associating sex
with nude bodies is some western, modern, or American perversion.  But anyway, I
guess this thread is veering off course so rave on (nude if that's your trip)...

p.s. On this subject, I saw the "naked guy" in Berkeley the other day.  I realy
look up to him and what he represents.  If I wasn't so self-concious and didn't
hate jail so much I'd probably join him.

	Actually, I tend to think of techno in ALL of those respects...
It's music for my mind because I'm fascinated with every nuance of a song,
and techno can be filled with so many subtle sounds and expressions that it's
easy for me to really get into it in that respect. It's music for the heart
for me because it makes me feel good, gets me happy, etc, and also because of
the 'heart' aspect of raving... As for the feet, I think THAT one is pretty 
obvious... :)

Subject: Nude Rave

Just a short interruption in your regular "nude rave" discussions
to mention that i was totally caught off guard today at the PP rave
in Berkeley.  I saw a total of three nude guys walking around and
at some points in time dancing with the crowd.  I had heard of the 
nude Berkeley student who was kicked out and also busted on
suspicions of drinking (alcoholic beverages) in public, but never
expected him/them there.

I thought at first, "cool, this is great!  Look at the freedom we 
have here to do this, but very soon I realized that I was there with
my niece (11 years old) and didn't know how to react.  She's fairly 
street-smart and kept dancing, but I knew she was disgusted. 

In talking to one of the cops later (who BTW chose to work that day
on that assignment) and he mentioned that they were concerned about
them SABM (Shirtless And Bottomless Men :), but as long as no one 
complained they would let them roam.

Now, back to your regular scheduled programming.

Subject: People's Park rave ...

Here's one neophyte-raver's opinions of this event ...

People's Park isn't very big, and there were a fair number of people
there, but it wasn't crowded.  It wasn't so focused as the indoor raves
I've been to, but was more anarchic and casual, which made for a nice
atmosphere.  Really diverse group of people there -- raver types, of
course :-), but also some Food-not-Bombs people (giving out free food :),
some old-time activist types, Andrew Martinez (the "Naked Guy", and he
was naked -- I got a bumper sticker from him, "HEY MAN, IT'S JUST A DICK!"),
and just people of other sorts hanging out and milling around
and enjoying the day.  It felt vibrant and non-forced, and the gorgeous
weather certainly helped -- it was like a low-key version of the joyous
exuberance and celebration of the present that used to exist in Cuba
and apparently still does exist in some native African communities.

I guess this is that mythical "vibe" ... :-)

Unfortunately they had to stop at 5, some silly regulations, and some dude
got up on stage and went on about how we all had to demand from Pres.
Clinton and other world leaders that they get together and have a
"global town meeting" and not stop until they solve the world's problems,
and stop the fighting in Bosnia, etc. etc.  It was awfully tired-sounding --
I felt like getting up and saying to the guy [he was in his 40's], "Didn't
the 60's teach you anything? Things don't work this way ..."

But it was kinda fitting for People's Park.  All over the park are signs
complaining about this or that horror committed by the Berkeley Police or
UC regents, lots of self-righteous stuff, tirelessly urging everyone to
take up arms in militant activism ...  there are lots and lots of activist
signs complaining about the volleyball court (!) in People's Park, and
likening their struggle to get rid of it to the struggles of people around
the world for free speech, freedom from oppression ... (!!!)

(I also got to say hello to Bob Ramstad of C2 tape fame.)

Ok, what happened? What went wrong? I just saw the news, some poor guy was
killed late saturday night after the Child closed down. I think I saw the guy
also. That was not a rave, it was a riot. Violence and gangs. No love there...
I have a few questions, I don't want to sound like an asshole, I just want to
know some things...If anything here annoys you, flame me, not this list...
	First off, why One Step Beyond? I thought this was supposed to be at
least somewhat underground. Finding the place was not hard. It was at one
of the better-known-for-violence-and-knives-than-dance clubs on a _VERY_ main
road in SJ. It was very, very obvious. Anybody and everybody who was
driving on El Camino after ten o'clock would've see that something big was up,
and the cops certainly could and did figure it out. It was not 'Bust free' as
the flyer vehemently proclaimed.
	Second, why was 2/3 of the club closed off? One Step is small, but not
that small. Why was the rave confined to one dinky room when there was potential
for so much more? I've been to concerts there where we packed in 5-600
people, and there was still room to move around. What's the deal?
	I think that the idea behind this rave (Giving a free rave as an
apology) was a good idea. The competition with the other raves is a bunch
of commercial bullshit. It had lots of potential...but, I think the organizers
screwed up hardcore by having it at this particular location. They were asking
for a riot by having a free event at such a small place. Free rave's attract
lot's of people (like the thousand that showed up) and this place could hardly
hold 200 in that small room. I think it was a mistake to not open up the whole
shameel. I think it was a mistake to advertise as heavily as they did for this
event. The Child made a mistake and paid the price. But it was a big mistake
to organize in such a fashion, and because they did so, one teenager is dead. So
much for the love. Fuck the unity as long as we can attract customers, eh guys?

	Next time, keep it a secret.

	I bet even the Clown isn't laughing at this one now...

Subject: A Child Is Dead?


Man.  I was at OSB to see Grotus, whose lead singer I know from some years
back and hadn't seen in some time, and heard about the rave from someone 
already in the club.  By the time I left, there were over 1000 people 
waiting outside and the line kept growing despite the number of people
leaving.  I hung around, not to get in, but to see what would happen.
There were a bunch of ravers there, but also a bunch of curiosity seekers
from SCU and other people who looked like they were just looking for free
beer or something.  The crowd got real restless (chanting "Let Us In!  Let
Us In!") but didn't get out of control or violent, although a few dumb 
people tried to start the line pushing forward.  After a while the music 
stopped and for a while no one knew what was going on.  After a bit the
doors burst open and what I guess was tear gas or something similar came
rushing out, followed by people running so fast they looked like they'd
been thrown out the door.  I heard scattered rumors about fights and stuff,
but couldn't really tell until after everyone had cleared out; someone said
a bunch of fights had broken out but no one seemed to know for sure.  An
ambulance didn't arrive for quite a while after this, so I don't know when
the person was shot.  

The people outside couldn't have fit into the club even if all of it was
open.  I can't believe only the front room was on.

No doubt the media has painted this as an example of how dangerous raves
are.  Sure, the organizers messed badly by advertising a free rave at a
small place (what were they thinking, with flyers all over the Bay?) but I
figure they were waiting to open up the back room 'cause the other bands'
stuff wasn't out yet, so they were off more like a factor of 3 than 10.
But, that's no excuse for people to bring their dumb-ass grudges into a 
party.  This happens all the time in the "wrong" areas of the Bay and 
no one gives a shit, but now that white people's kids are involved the
muck will start flying.

Ironically, having at least some sort of cover probably ensures that you
won't get people who don't give a shit showing up and ruining it for
everyone, permanently for some.  If you're going to keep if free, keep it
quiet.  There are too many people who can't handle the freedom.

So what can we do?  Keep it underground, keep the love.  There will 
always be plenty of big commercial events to make the money and draw 
people into the scene -- and we can really pull out the stops when we're
with our small yet expanding circle of family.  

Having said that, I'm still shocked.  Damn.  // g

Why didn't you just say "cool, this is great!  Look at the freedom we

What did she find so disgusting about it?  Their behavior certainly
wasn't lewd or offensive in any  The fact that it didn't even cause a 
stir amongst those of us who were there may have told her something,
like it was OK, no big deal.  What a great learning experience
this may have been for her.  Although she might have been uncomfortable
with the sight of a penis or two, she learned  that nudity can exist in a
natural, casual and harmless manner.  Next time it happens, she'll
be able to shrug it off.  And the time after that, who knows, maybe she'll
remove her clothes and join them. :-)

Actually, we spotted the "naked guy" at the End-Up (Housing Project) a few
times (he was wearing underwear). And yesterday, the naked guy was (fully)
visible at the People's Park "Rave". In fact it was catching, since there
were a few other naked folks that followed suit (birthday suit, that is).

Shaun...as it seems that, for whatever reason GGP is remaining problematic,
check this out: There is a park (killer one no less) at 20th and Minnesota
in SF called ESPRIT Park. Not surprisingly, ESPRIT (yes the clothing
company) *owns* it. Saturday I went to a little earth day gig there. A
friend of mine set up a rather *large* sound sytem with ESPRIT's blessing
and we all had a good time. Point is: apparently ESPRIT is willing to make
the park available for events for what I was told is: Roughly a $50
insurance rider and a fee of between $100 and $300. While ESPRIT may not be
into large weekly gatherings, they might be into once or wice a month, but
then again, who knows, maybe they can use the money.

Anyway, nice park: Easily as big as the main area of Marx, thick green
grass, picnic tables, *electricity*, very industrial setting, ie not many
if any neighbors to complain. 

Once again, anyhting I can do to help please let me know....

peace and let the good times roll

   A friend of mine contacted the Park Service people to ask about
Mountain Theatre, and evidently it's available,and can be used by
"up to a thousand people" (he wasn't interested because it was booked the
weekend he needed it and also because he wanted to have more people.)
I'm not one to explore this,but maybye some other people might want to have an
event there. I know it's far away,but we could carpool from the  City,
Berkeley,etc.

This is not good, brothers and sisters, two murders in the last 30 days.
Promoters take note! Maybe its better to scrub your party then to push
a bad situation.  There will always be another party and you DO or SHOULD
show some responsibility to/for the people who come to your events.  Having
very public events in areas that have reputations for violent crime is stupid,
these kinds of actiobs just give the authorities the excuse they are looking
for to shut us down, (they will say, we know ravers are peaceful but there
are other people at your parties who are not and you don't have adequate
security.  I think its time to really brush up on our underground party
throwing skills.

> [NRG tells of ESPRIT Park]

and if whoever it is that puts the Sundays @ Golden Gate Park gigs
together isn't interested, then perhaps we (SFR) should get something
together once every few weeks. 

Is there any way to talk ESPRIT to donate the use of the park without
the $100-$300 fee. Perhaps with exchange of free advertizing  limited
to little  more than "this party brought to you by ESPRIT -- please buy
our stuff". I'd rather see "ESPRIT" logos than "Coors" "Bud" or
"Swiller...err...Miller". 

i'd be willing to contribute tech-help, heavy lifting, and perhaps lend
equipment (that I expect to purchase real soon now).

			--------------------

On various occasions, i've gotten thoroughly lost while mountain biking
in golden gate park. There are a lot of "back areas" of golden gate
park that i somehow doubt police will find very quickly. If we can keep
'em small (< 100) and friendly, we could probably just set it up, pray
for nondiscovery, and if the mounties do find us, hope that they see it
as being a controllably small party. esp. one that won't escalate into
a riot.

I think the main problem with the last GGP rave was that it was totally
"in everyone's face" by being right on the main road/pathway through
GGP. It was way too big, too loud, and too easily discovered by every
stray tourist and tour-bus -- a wild and wooly audio-animatronic
freak-show. a beast that the authorities would rather repress than
exploit. Its easier for them to say no than say yes.... Well, it was
wonderful while it lasted. Eventually anything good gets squashed or
subverted, so perhaps it *is* better to burn out than fade away? 

Other thing that we should look for is locations that are a few miles
away over an open but infrequently travelled 4WD access road. Set the
soundsystem up in the back of someone's 4WD truck, find an appropriate
turn-out and crank it. Crowd gets to walk or bike to the party.

			--------------------

I'm thinking of putting together the roots of a soundsystem -- does
anybody know anything about the Ashly FET-2000M (2 * 500W@4-ohm,
MOSFET)  advertized by Bananas At Large for $699.00?? Usage will be for
playback of live-electronic and dj'd "dance/trip/fall" music.

But i guarantee you that the owners of the most expensive, newly-for-sale

well when it comes down to children seeing people naked
i think that is the one thing that this society fucks people up
on more than anything else
its just part of the whole thing that nudity=sexuality

REALLY it doesnt

it means being the way god wanted you to be
seriously, unless its required for protection
what are teh use of clothes?

they're good to hide behind
to be insecure about the way you look and the way
other people look at you

it has NOTHING to do with sexuality
clothing makes you look sexy
nudity makes you look real
and im sure that most everyone knows what a naked person looks like
by the age of 5 or they at least should
they can cover half the planet by looking down in the shower

i know this subject is kinda old and beat up
but to me its one of the most important things wrong with society
people cant deal with themselves or their own bodies
much less starting to deal with other people

i think that a c/o rave could really be the answer
maybe it should start off in some patio type area
that isnt open to the public but isnt completely indoors
cuz part of the wonderful feeling of being naked 
is being that way in nature

and then after more and more people got used to it
then move it out into the public 
and then rave will probably get billed as some orgy
where every takes drugs and rips off all their clothes
which sounds great to me, but i think the press would take it wrong :)

Smiling Thru's creators are putting on a new party called SPLASH which
will basically be the same thing at the same place and same time but
with a different name for no particular reason.  At least, I think
it's the same place & time.  Check the flyers.  I'll probably know
soon enough cos Jeff & I are going to be DJing at the opening.  Jeff's

I missed just about everything this weekend, which kind of bummed me
out since Fields Of Joy apparently turned out to be something I would
have really bugged out at, but...

Anyway, I salvaged my eternally raving soul by going out on the
Bulletproof boat party Sunday evening.  Pricey at $20 but worth it!!
A beautiful evening to tool around the bay, with a bizarre yet
entertaining mix of music - it started out straight slow reggae,
mutated through hip hop, disco, house and god knows what else.  Digs &
Woosh got the crowd screaming (and I mean SCREAMING) and then Scott &
Robbie helped everyone come down as we pulled back in to the dock,
while the city glittered about us like the prize jewel that it is.
San Francisco, I LOVE YA!!

Most of the boat partiers continued on at El Rio, Spundays and/or
Atlantis, but I had to go sleep, so I did.

Hold on... it's starting up again next weekend, I believe, as Splash.
They're actually opening up the pool for people to swim in!  It'll be
interesting to see whether it catches on.  I went to a swim/dance party
there about 1-1/2 years ago, but there only a dozen or so people showed up.

To find out more call the info line:  (415) 979-LUV0.

Fields of Joy (put on by the same promoter) pre-empted it this weekend.
Unfortunately the location got bounced around so many times that we
were unable to set up vrave there.  It ended up at the Sound Factory
and was pretty sparcely attended...

Subject: A long weekend

Well, my weekend started on Thursday night with Deep Space. It was excellent.
Spun and Garth both tore it up in their usual fashion and there was plenty
of energy on the dance floor. Digs and Woosh from the DIY people were in the
back room providing a nice alternative to the main floor. For the second time
in a row I left Deep Space wishing it didn't end so early.

Friday night, on a whim, I decided to check out Trance in Space at the Attitude
Factory. I got there at midnight and it turned out it wasn't starting until
2:00, so I just went in to the main club. It certainly did live up to its
reputation. The crowd was pretty lame. Fortunately the sound system there is
amazing and the music was incredible. The DJs were Doc Martin and Fabi Paras,
neither of whom I had ever heard and both of whom blew me away. I went to the
back room several time during the night to check out Trance in Space, but the
DJs there just weren't doing it for me. The visuals, however, were outstanding.
At 2:30-3:00 the main room cleared out somewhat and the energy improved
considerably. I left at 5:00 after Doc's set was over and went to check out
Smiling Thru, but that weekly is defunct (Alert to Brian) so I just went home.

Saturday night I went to Channeling, which lived up to most of my expectations.
It was at the Stone, which is one of my least favorite locations, but memories
of the last Channeling convinced me that it would still be good. There was a
show at the Stone beforehand delaying the rave until 1:45 a.m., which was
unfortunate, because it threw off the timing of the whole event.

The crowd was just about the perfect size for the Stone. There were enough
people to maintain the energy and still plenty of room on the dance floor.
The music was fantastic. Digs and Woosh were in full force followed by Tony
who pretty much blew everyone away. The night peaked when Tony threw down the
music..music..music..music..music.. song which had everyone jumping up and down
and screaming. That was one of the best moments I've ever seen at a rave.
After Tony's set was over it was around 6:00 a.m. which would have been the
perfect time to go into the ambient/acid jazz breakfast, but unfortunately
Josh went on anyway and played a set too fast and hard for anyone to keep up
with. A lot of people left and most of the rest just sat down and waited for
breakfast. When breakfast finally came, those few of that were left (30-40) sat
down and ate and talked. It's a brilliant way to end a party. To anyone who
missed this night (most of you), DON'T MISS THE NEXT ONE!

Sunday, I went to People's Park, but there weren't very many people there. Some
woman with a microphone was ranting over the music, so Mike W and I just went
shopping on Telegraph.

Overall this was musically one of the best weekends I've ever had. Anyone go to
the Sound Factory on Sat night for Fields of Joy? I'm curious to hear about it.

Subject: Weekend Update


Friday: (I lead a double life) went to see a smokin' Jerry Garcia Band
show at the Warfield.

Saturday: put my life in order, got a 2 hour nap, hung out with
friends, ate two dinners (pasta and chinese).  tried to meet Laura
(from this list, hi!) and Rebecca (a friend of hers from Stanford
graduate Art History) at the "Child is Born" rave.  Didn't realize the
directions on the number were to One Step Beyond, or I probably
wouldn't have tried it...

Anyway, I went to Wally World beforehand to try to sell some tapes and
generally check out the scene.  I talked to Joe, one of the promoters,
who didn't have any problem letting me in as long as I gave him one of
the tapes I was selling.  I met some pretty cool people while hanging
out and selling tapes, but on the whole, there were a lot of young
tough guys there.  

(Warning: potential slander coming up, but it's the truth.)  WW was
advertised (presumably on the flyer) as:

Saturday, April 24th - Wally World: Welcome to the Next Level
        Julius  Thomas  Spun  Bam Bam  Ernie Munson  Josh
          Shon  Joe Harp  DJ Dan  Rick Preston  Harry who?
	"Two days on the green outdoors" - tents and sleeping
	  space available.  BBQ, swimming, & Picnic all day long.
        408.450.2349    415.979.6822    916.449.3238    510.466.5533

(I have one of the flyers somewhere, and this excerpt is accurate, I
think.)

Well, their hotline number said "11 PM to 10 AM, Malibu Gran Prix,
Redwood City".  Pretty different than advertised.

I was there until about 12:30.  No one got in until 12:15 or so.
Driving back from Channeling, I passed the site at 7 AM.  Everyone was
long gone.  So, an event advertised as multi-day ended up less than 7
hours long.  Pretty bogus.  They had people lined up for about a mile,
4-8 people wide, my best estimate is 3-5K people.

Well, I left and went to Santa Clara.  About 2 blocks away, I realized
that things were badly out of control... it was close to 1 AM, and
there were just too many cars and people.  I found a spot, parked,
looked around for Laura & Rebecca in a crowd of at least 1K people...
and noticed a LOT of cops outside the lot.  After about 15 minutes,
the cops announced over their car speakers "there will be no show
tonight, please go home, you must disperse".

Discretion being the better part of valor, I went straight home.  15
minutes later, Laura called me and said that the cops had used tear
gas or possibly pepper spray on the crowd.  Wow.

We reconvened at my place in Mtn View and went up to Channeling,
arriving at about 3 PM.  Great great great time.  My only complaints
were lack of visuals and lack of chill space.  I met more random cool
people at that event than any other event I've been at, except for C2.
Nice sound system, loud but not too loud (and I can always use more
bass, but this was nicely balanced with a good amount of bass).

Left at 7 AM, exhausted... probably because I went to Deep Space in SJ
on Thursday and danced a good bit.  Saw Mike W., Pat R., Lee F., your
friend Mike, and other SF ravers...

Sunday: crashed for 2 hours, went to People's Park, had a good time.
Sound system didn't show up until 2 PM.

To be honest, I had a lot better time at GGP last weekend, even though
there wasn't a sound system.

This coming Sunday, if the hotline sez there is definitely a sound
system in People's Park, that's where I'll go.  Obviously if it's
definitely happening in GGP, I'll be there.  But, if the hotline sez
nothing is going on anywhere, I'm going to go to GGP with my new
"rave-in-a-bag" (tm) (about 50 pounds so it's semi-portable, 35 watts
per channel!) and hang out...  I had a great time doing this last
week, and I think that getting together during the day is really cool,
I love talking to everyone and enjoying the day.

Tear gas?

over-association is.  

From: gdallensworth@ucdavis.edu

Exactly.  A constant preoccupation with sex (to me) *is* dysfunctional and
seems to be overly prevelent in the US among heterosexual males.  I don't 
know, maybe that's just my own skewed perception.  I certainly wasn't trying
to implicate anyone on the list (or piss anyone off) - in fact, I have found
that many within the community feel the same way:

One final thought:

I was also trying to suggest that repression of one's fundamental 
responses to sexuality is not healthy.  That forcing these "evil" thoughts
from our minds leads to deviant behavior (i.e., harassment and rape).  That
the morals being established in this country by the far right ultra 
conservative wing is (again IMHO) partly responsible for sexual aggression 
(especially against women) just as prohibition gave birth to Al Capone.

Agreed.  If everyone could come to terms with and accept his/her own
sexuality (something it appears the people on the list have no problems 
with :), the world would be a much happier and less threatening place for
all peoples.

I am greatly disturbed by the recent (and not so recent, as this has been
going on for quite some time) police harrassment of partiers. Saturday night
we threw a (mellow compared to other parties we've had, and mellow by all
other standards) house party, and there was this one Oakland Cop who had the
biggest attitude, and decided that he WAS going to shut us down (before
2 am even). This particular cop LIED and said that he had been to our house
4 times (not true), and on the last time that he came, he barged into the
house and cleared everyone out. He then put my roommate and myself into 
the back seat of the patrol car (by this time there were 3 cars), went
into the house with another cop and TOOK my 1200's. These cops would not
engage in any dialogue AT ALL, and when we tried to talk to them the (bad)
cop said, "are you getting smart with me?". Also, when signing the property
receipt and other papers, the cop had written a ticket and had me sign it
under the auspices of it being receipt paperwork. I was assurred that getting
my turntables back would be no problem, but it seems that it isn't so. I
must now go through several more days of bullshit, paperwork, court and
then more bullshit for what I consider to be an obvious violation of my
rights.

I realize that the clown is dead fiasco is of a diff. nature, but it
is alike in that cops have been rude, abusive of their power, and will
fuck you up in a second flat. This is nothing new to me, just a very
pointed reminder. I will never show a cop respect unless he/she shows me
respect first, and that has only happened twice in my life. 

We are not free. Just ask a cop. Or someone who has been beat down by one.

Subject: Benefit Rave(s) and a startup all in one!


Hi everyone,

My name is Jon Lancaster, and even though I've never met anyone from
sfraves, or for that matter attended a rave, I've come to "know" many
of you over the last few months via reading the large volume of mail.

I'm "30-something", looking "forty-something" in the face, and have
great memories of the 60's, the Haight, Bill Graham shows at Winterland,
etc. When I was in college at U.C. Davis I worked security at many
BGP Shows (college football players gotta do something for pocket money!)
and it saddens me deeply to see young adults being shot and killed or
injured when all they want to do is dance and enjoy themselves.

After college at Davis, I've spent the last decade+ in the computer
business. I was employee #126 at Sun Microsystems back in 1983 when
Macintoshes, SparcStations, SGI Indigos were just the twinkle in an
engineer's eye. These days I run my own computer consulting practice
and Sun, SGI, Apple and many other well known silicon valley firms
are among my clients. My niche is graphics, window systems, imaging,
and as the markets develop, multimedia and virtual/artificial
reality. I'm also a repressed musician, a sailor and soon a pilot.

I am checking into the permits, insurance, and other costs involved
in throw raves as benefits to purchase computer HW/SW to donate to
schools. By virtue of being a very early employee at Sun, I know
many wealthy, well-connect people in the computer biz and think
that with some volunteer help from people on sfraves and friends
of friends, we could all put together a regularly scheduled event
with volunteer labor which be a win-win-win. I have my eye on a
really nice spot to do this that's mid-peninsula, has great
freeway access, plenty of free parking, etc.

if you think you would be interested in helping out, please
send me a *private* message with the following info:

	Who You Are
	What Special Talents You Could Contribute
	Why You Want To Help
	What You'd Like To Learn (in return for helping out)


send your replies to me at the following address:


Jon Lancaster

jonl@netcom.com


Don't be concerned if you don't hear back from me right away,
beyond a short reply to acknowledge that I received your mail.
My target date for our first rave is the July 4th weekend, and
I'd like to do something weekly all summer so we amass a big
wad of cash that I hope to get companies like Sun, SGI and apple
to match. At the very least we'll get big, big educational discounts
from them. The schools on *my* list are (1) an elementary school
in Palo Alto where a neighbor of mine teaches 3rd grade (they
already get all my old floppies, down-rev software, etc.)
(2) U.C. Davis, (3) SFSU MultiMedia Studies Program (3) Academy
of Art College (5) San Francisco Art Institute, (6) Calif. College
of Arts & Crafts, (6) Cogswell College (Computer Aninmation &
Music), (7) UC Berkeley Extension & (8) UC Santa Cruz Extension.

I hope to hear from many of you, and as soon as it makes sense,
I'll get in touch with those of you who respond and we'll get
together to talk things over.

Subject: Channeling delivers!

Man oh man, what a fucking party!

Mike (your friend) and I were all psyched up for Channeling whne

we called the line and it said the space was the Stone.  We hate this place
so much that we decided to check out Love American style, which was at the
same location as the frist rave we ever attended in Berkeley.  We headed
over there and sat around outside for awhile and checked out the people.
They looked like clubbers and Gangsters, people without the know.  We
sweated it for awhile, flipflopped on a decision fifty times, and chose
to go to Channeling, figuring that having a great crowd is much more 
important than the space.

We waited in line forever, but the Vibe was there, even in line.  The first
2 DJs sucked, mostly (Doran, Anton) but when Digs & Woosh came on with their
tag team set, my mind was blown.  They were absolutely incredible.  Anton
had laid down a happy, thoughtless set that had people happy and thoughtless,
essentially cool for people on e, pretty social scene at the time.  When
Digs & Woosh came on, the feeling changed into one big communal Trip, hard
and orgasmic.  Their music would build up in levels, higher and higher,
until you just had to scream, it was so intense.  The floor was packed
with people, as dense as it would get that night.  I hope they move here
and stay forever.
Tony ripped shit up really well after them.  He is a really good DJ who 
doesn't get much attention, except at Martin's parties.  Josh came on
afterwards and proceeded to beat everyone into the ground with the hardest
stuff I have ever heard at 7:30 in the morning.  Most people could only
sit there as he took out his aggression on the crowd.  I guess that's 
what you do if you had been to about 3 other parties the same evening... he
really gets around.  The breakfast was really cool as an afterparty, but
we needed more and headed to afterlife, where we bowed to Simon and his
funky music.  He is god.

The thing I have noticed about these parties is that the ones I have enjoyed
the most have been parties composed mostly of people under 21, alot under
18.  There are alot of these people who understand what it is all about
and
I know and like alot of them.  I think Martin knows how to attract the
right people with all the energy.  I love it!

Peace to everyone, especially Lee, Pete and Mike W., who all shared in the 
great night on Saturday.  All of you should go to the next Channeling.

wanted to check it out.  Luckily we found parking outside the fenced

dancing and the tented area was too crowded.  It didn't look like there
was that much energy going on, so we kicked back in the car and took a
2 hour nap.  At around 6:30 we were about go in but cops came, shut the
system down and stayed until 7:00, then they all left.  Their 2-day rave
was only a 6 hour rave.  It looked like this was planned because they closed
down exactly at 6:30 and within minutes a blue van arrived near the tent
and started packing.  Also if this was supposed to be for 2 days what is
Malibu going to do to their normal customers who wants to use the race track?
It's great that I saved $20 :)

Subject: Bill Graham Presents

Could someone point me to a book that contains posters done for the early Bill
Graham shows?  I know there was a particular artist who did this groovey sort
of work, but I don't know the name.  My sister wants to design us a flyer in
that style, but she has nothing to work off of.

I threw the shortest rave ever on Saturday, and had our first bust.  We set up
in a field in the industrial section of town.  The cops were there in ONE HOUR
after the sound kicked in.  They were nice enough, but I was skeptical of
their "complaints".  First off, the nearest house was a mile away and the
second complaint they had was of "crazy drivers."  Who is going to call in the
middle of the night and complain about "crazy drivers?"  We didn't argue
though, and just shut down immediately.  Talk about commando rave, we were out
of there in 20 minutes.  The new DJ table I built out of saw-horses was
working especially well.

I desperately want to do another outdoor show, but we'll probably have to do
it out in the western desert where nobody cares.  Someone suggested that we do
a "Rest Stop Rave", which I thought would be funny, but the highway patrol
would probably be rather pissed off about it.

Subject: Re: A Child Is Dead? 


I'd like to second Geoff's statement...  maybe not having some raves
that will attract trouble is a good idea.

And rave promoters need to realize the potential for that
trouble occurring.  And be ready to deal with it.  I don't mean
to think about it, have a plan for situations like "Ok, guy pulled
knife but left" and "Gang sitting off to side looking threatening"
and "Someone's outside trying to get in, and we don't want them."

The proper responses in cases like this may be to call police,
be honest with them, and let them maybe safely shut down the rave rather
than chance violence.  One thing you may want to do is call the police
business line some time in the jurisdiction you'll be in, and chat for
a bit about how they feel about you calling them in for security problems,
so you know where they'll be coming from and visa versa.  You don't
have to tell them when or how, just what. 8-)  They usually will be
cool about cooperating in the name of greater safety.

Some bars have to have armed bouncers.  Having to have armed security
at Raves would be pretty uncool.  If you want to keep the vibe, then
be ready to chill out and rave another day.

Your should show more respect.  After all, activists do more about peace, etc. 
than most of us do (if you don't thind this is true for you than by definition
your probably an activist too) and the only reason that "things don't work that
way" is is because everyone else is too apathetic to join in and reach critical
mass.  That's a big part of what made the 60's special, it's the closest we have
been to that critical mass.  And all though admitedly the volley ball court thing
sounds stupid, there is a lot more to it.  I was arrested over that issue I'll

WALLY WORLD....At the Malibu Grand Prix?

  Funny thing... I walked to the 7-11 near where I live on Saturday night
and some women dressed like they were going to a club (?!!) asked
me if I knew how to get to the Malibu Grand Prix. I thought it was odd as
it was after 11:30pm and I couldn't remember whether it was off of Seaport
or ?. Then some CHP's came in and I told them "I'm sure they would know".
Sheeesh... I didn't even know that WALLY WORLD was there. Of course I had
no interest in a rave that had a full page ad in the Metro and this was
a weekend that I was spending with my son, so I wasn't planning on going to
anything anyway. How strange! Strange because the person I was with said
"maybe there's a rave happening there".

There's info on it in the FTP site.  Basically, it's seen as comparable to MDMA
in the enhanced sense of touch and general state of well-being, but more like
LSD in its visuals and psychological effects.  It lasts about at long as MDMA,
but the high isn't as intense.  People describe the visual effects as making
everything look "biological" and "morphic".  Generally, I think people say its
effects are too subtle and delicate to make enjoyable at a rave, unless it's a
really good outdoor daytime event, and that dosing at the end of an MDMA trip
is the most advisable.  For further (more complete, and much more accurate)
info read PIHKAL by Alexandar Shulgin (a part of which is also available at the

Subject: Make your voice HEARD


        Every Monday for the past several weeks, a group of people, 
including the most of the major promoters in the SF scene, have gathered
together for three hours.  For the month following Malachy's accident and
leading up to Come/Unity, the meetings were predominantly about planning
the benefit party on the 17th of April.  Now that that has passed, and in
spite of all the problems both technical and spiritual the party had, 
COme/Unity was considered a triumph of cooperation.  In the weeks since
the party (and in small part while leading up to it)  there was a growing
sense of, hey, we *don't* need to be at each other's throats, we don't 
need to resort to backhanded deals and slimy antics to throw parties.  And
most importantly, we can do a tremendous amount of good by unifying, by
acting as a family.  Much of the talk since the party, particularly tonight,
has been based upon where we as a House Movement should go; should we throw
more joint parties, maybe throw a few more for Mal to ensure his financial
stability in the ties ahead, and then address other issues, should we set
up a "seal of approval" on parties we know the promoters have their act
together with, should we provide a forum for airing grievances about parties
and promoters... the list is truly endless, but in turn so are the
possiblities, and _everyone_ in the meeting is optimistic about what can be
done.

	Basically, here's where we fit in.  I'm sending the call out now
for ideas, pure, unadulterated ideas.  This is essentially an analogue to a
"letters to the editor" section of a newspaper - all replies to this message
will be collected and printed out for each person present at these meetings.
I will compile them this Sunday night, so be sure and have everything and
anything you want to say enclosed in that.  I think the topic should stick
to:

	Where would you like to see the House movement grow?  Where could
the parties and the vibe be improved?  What can promoters do as individuals
and as a group to make the scne in San Francisco the best in the world?

	Be as explicit in your letters as you want, but remember that 
brevity is the soul of wit.  PLease refrain from making them a bash-fest,
from mentioning specific names or making accusations.  This is about what
we should hope to attain, not necessarily a critique on what the scene is.

	I look forward to your response - the headers will be cleaned up, but
the names and dates retained unless you wish to remain anonymous.  SPEAK
UP!  :)  Also, if you feel you have made a relevant post in the past about 
this, the archives are available for anonymous FTP from soda, so feel free to
rehash something.  If it's a topic that's been done to death on the list you
can send it to me via private email.  It's time to turn our talk into action.

Subject: Re:  Make your voice HEARD

Clean up the security and door act -- now.  We're paying a lot of dough
and not so little of our even more precious time and energy to get
something wonderful out of (and maybe put something back into) the
scene.  And we are *well* aware of the security/door point of view.

Door Attitude is the one thing I most want to dispense with.  It is
not necessary.  Period.  Most people will be very cooperative if you
*allow* them to be so.  The rest will be isolated and not supported
in any acts which are destructive of common-sense good order.  

Good security *means* security, not control.  A crowd of 1500 people
doesn't behave themselves because 20 door and security people make them.
They behave themselves because they are of a mind to do so.  

One thing that really helps improve overall crowd security (I am NOT
going to say crowd control, based precisely on the point I made in the
last graf) is to provide credible and consistent information.  Let's
dispense with Door BS, one of the subsets of Door Attitude.  I will
use an example to illustrate.

A certain ambitious crew which has been putting on raves in the Northwest
scheduled one for last Saturday night featuring a well-known UK/Bay Area
DJ and some locals.  I checked another scene for a while and arrived
a little after 4 am, figuring (based on previous experience with the
venue) that it would end between 5:30 and 6.  Although there was obviously
plenty still going on, in fact things were going full blast, the Door
Gentleman informed me that nobody else was being let in.  Why?  Because,
you see, people were started to leave and blah blah blah.  This is simply
*not* credible.  Maybe they were full up inside.  Maybe they wanted to
go home early.  Letting a potential customer know the real reason was
the furthest thing from their mind.  What this attitude suggests -- and
at times this is unfair but this is the appearance -- is that promoters
think their customers are just a blind bunch of sheep who are willingly
stripped of their cash and then booted out just as soon as can be
arranged.  They call it 'turn' in the restaurant and bar business.

Few people are against promoters, DJs, techs and yes, even door people,
for making some money in compensation for their time and (in some cases)\
monetary investment.  Which is why we pay what often seems like inflated
dollars for the privilege.  

But the role of security and entrance/exit management is a *service*,
not a license to ill.  With the kinds of bucks we are paying, we should
expect no less.  But more importantly, and well beyond the money involved,
*we should expect no less* as people who are all (even fleetingly)
interdependent on each other for the health of the scene.

Thanks for the thanks, Arthur... actually, I've gotten private email

to mention hugs from people at People's Park :-)

I've also gotten a lot of requests for layout info, so here it is...
enjoy!

PS I'll be in the park on Sunday, if nothing is going on officially
I'll be in GGP with my dog and "rave-in-a-bag", otherwise wherever the
sound system is...  and I'll bring C2 sets, so drop by if you want
one.  I'm actually getting a number of re-sales to people using them
for gifts to friends living in depraved musical communities...
Pittsburgh and Cleveland seem to be the predominant destinations :-)

layout for C2 cassettes

(I hope this is ok here)
I'm interested in creating a laser show using my 386sx, I need advice
on:
  what equipment do i need (tubes, scanner, controller)
  where to get this equipment and
  any info that will help me get started.
  I'm not looking for any large lasers like the one on the last ComeUnity
  but smaller (and cheaper) ones for the beginners.

 Also, I've seen numerous people use the Commodore C64 computers, would that
be more better than my 386?

i was really bummed that fields of joy didn't happen at originally
planned site.  i was in the mood for an outdoor event...really
like the idea of the convergence of techno and nature, but anyway
decided to check out the berkeley rave at aquatic park (read parking lot)
got there early so crowd was small although it never really caught fire.

the people were mixed, too many clubbers and police/security roaming the
perimeter for me to really feel a good vibe.  the sound system outside
was thumpin though...did i really hear an irish jig with a techno beat?

thought about going back to sf and checking out f.o.j. but gave this
"rave" one more chance to ignite, i had no mo cash anyway.  but after 
reading what went on at some of the other events this weekend, i guess
it wasn't that bad.

raves in berkeley?  moooo...

When I phoned the White House about Bosnia today (Friday), I got
a rather different response than usual. Instead of giving my tirade and
getting a "Thank you, I'll pass your comments along to the
president," the operator said: "Let me ask you something. Do
you support air strikes or sending troops in?"

If they are asking that specifically, it seems to me they are
especially guaging now what actions they have public support for.
I STRONGLY urge anyone who wants to try to affect U.S. policy in

the fact that you may or may not be grinning like an idiot as you type

Subject: Rave on...


  At the last Mt View Cypherpunks meeting,  it was discussed about ways
in which we can get the word out to as many people as possible.    

  I have an idea on yet another way on how this can be done.    Would
like to get input and feedback on this from the rest of the group.

  One such place where lots of people meet are RAVES.   My proposal is
to set up a room with a bunch of donated PC's Macs or whatever,   and
have a booth set up where people can purchase PGP diskettes for slightly
above cost of the diskettes.    People attending raves can purchase
their PGP diskettes and on the spot,  generate their keys.    They can
sign each other's keys there,   and handout literature can be made
available for anyone attending that describes the "Clipper" proposals,
and suggestions on what people can do to resist further government
control over private cryptography.

  Already,  at most raves,  there are demonstrations set up for things
like the new "body synth",  VR demos,  and other things,  so this should
fit right in.

  I'm in contact with a number of RAVE organizors,  and plan on contacting
them.    If enough people from Cypherpunks are interested in bringing their
portables or small PC's,  Macs or whatever to raves,  this might be a
very good way of reaching the younger people who might not otherwize be 
plugged into the mainstream media like TV,  or newspapers,  or whatever.

  For those interested in donating a Sat evening,  and wanting to have
a little fun,  by bringing their computers to future raves,   please 
send me your Email address,  and specifics on any equipment you might 
want to bring,  I can put you in touch with the appropriate organizers.
Anyway,   I'm open for input on this,  and how we can get the word out.

  At the Cypherpunks dinner,  I mentioned to John Gilmore and others about
the possibility of doing short video "skits" and "infomercials" on
some hypothetical scenerios of a "Faschiist government" that outlaws
encryption.   We can make it fun and entertaining,  and I don't think I
would have a problem proposing it to those people capable of producing
this video.    We will need actors,   and some people to write up the
"skit".    I don't think we would have any problem convincing KQED,  or
any other TV station to air it.    It would reach a lot of people,  and
is a good instrument in getting the word out.

  I talked to Wes Thomas about this,  and we can set up an ad hoc get
together in Berkeley and perhaps Eric Hughes and John Gilmore can
attend and we can "ad lib" for practice a few hypothetical skits
and vide tape it some evening.    I think it would be fun,   and even
John Gilmore might enjoy participating in this fun activity.

Rave on - D00ds!!

I STRONGLY disagree that:
>asking that women "look good", etc.. DOES put

Point taken, but WHO's prblem is it?  Certainly not your, but the cultures.
So therefore I reserve the right to use "look good" in any way I choose, as
long as I know what I mean by it and do not force my idea of beauty upon
others.  That cannot be wrong.  I choose the words to enpower my own actions
and deeds, I will NOT let the popular culture, or some PC afficianado to
define the words I choose.  For that IS thought control.

The idea of "looking good" has many different meanings in many different
cultures.  What looks good to me may not look good to another person.
Everyone has their own perspective.

What is TRULY scary is this insistance on WHAT to say and HOW to say it.
This makes me SICK in a country where we are SUPPOSED to have many liberties
(we ALL know this is more fantasy than reality).  So, remeber, it's not how
you fell but how you look.  Most importantly it is up to you to define what
good is for yourself, and in time, people will catch on.

Live on biig sistah', keep the vibe!

(BTW as an African American I have first hand experience at people's bigotry
and intolerance.  But I have decided that they have the power so long as I
ALLOW them to exert a force of will over me.  As long as I deny them that in
word and deed, I have WON!).

i think thta using a word to mean what you wnat it to is fine
but i think you need to define the word when you use it
not just use it and expect people to realize what it means
or if the word has common usage other than yours
that they will ask you if it means somethign different

i mean i personally use the term boyfriend to describe
men friends that i have and likewise with girlfriend
(well.. i mean.. with women friends that i have..)
but usually if i use the word i make sure to define it
so people dont get confused and think i have 4 male lovers at once
not that that is a bad thing but i dotn and probably wont any time soon
so why confuse people on purpose just to make a point?

likewise if i use the term nigger is that bad?
if to me it means a person who is descendent from africa
that is equal to me as a human being, can i use it freely
as long as it is clearly defined that i am using it as such?

Not to beg the question or anything, but if you don't trust the guy
doing the survey in NY not to record your name, why would you trust
one of these remailing services?  Or for that matter, why would you
trust that a hacker or a gov't agency isn't simply spooling off all
incoming messages sent to either of those addresses?

No, folks, without a good solid cryptography system there's no use
considering *any* form of e-mail more private than a postcard.

Without going into a bunch of technical details on the nature of these remailers
there are ways that you can definitely send secure anonymous messages.
If someone needs more info, look at the cypherpunk archives on soda for
the FULL details.

There are still problems.  Even if you use PGP encryption into the
cypherpunk remailer, someone can monitor the mail traffic _into_ the
remailer, and get a list of people who are using it.  Ok, they can't
tell what you're using it for, but they can tell that you're sending
anonymous mail.  If they monitor what comes out of the remailer as
well, and the remailers in your chain aren't heavily used, there's a
good chance that they'll be able to match up the outgoing mail to the
incoming mail, and track the message all the way from the original to
the plain text.  You could even automate this process to an extent by
looking at sizes of messages.  In any case, you still have to trust
the machine on which you do the initial encryption.  How do you know
that someone hasn't tampered with your pgp to keep a log of everything
you encrypt...

Now, if you're _really_ careful, and you have the right kind of
connection, you should be able to send mail which can't be traced back
any further than to the originating site.  But even that requires a
lot of care to get right.  It all depends on how much THEY want to get
you....

It's all a metter of degree.  Yes, using chained remailers with
encryption is probably safe enough to send an MDMA survey.  But it
isn't 100% secure.  Security is hard.

Speaking as someone who has been a pretty hardcore raver for almost 2 years now
my view on this is as follows:

	1) Most ravers don't want to be preached to, they do want to be
	informed though, the best approach is an "access to tools" approach
	of invite and education.  I think that as of right now, not many
	ravers even have e-mail, although there is a very organized group
	that does and is strongly networked already.  Some of them know
	about PGP.  We have already discussed whether our e-mail lists
	should be encryped and the idea was rejected by the group at large.
	Some of us do send encrypted messages back and forth sort of
	as a novelty, sort of for practice.  I think the best thing to do for
	this organized group is to educate them and at least get them to
	generate keys for themselves IF THEY WANT TO.  Education is important
	they have to realize  that the key is like a bank card password , you
	don't tell everbody what it is.  Many people are in altered states
	at raves, this is NOT the set or setting to have them generating
	keys with pass phrases that they have to remember.

	2) I am on a drive to "wire-up" the rave community, in the
	next issue of CyberTribe-5, I have an article on PGP and why
	ravers should get hooked up to e-mail. The e-mail advantage is
	clear for many ravers... the ones who are wired always seem to
	know where the best parties are.  Why we need encryption is not
	as clear.  The scene is about openess, we are well aware that LE
	folks are most likely on our lists, we don't post the truely
	underground events anymore to public list.  We set up phone trees
	and private e-mail trees for events like the Full Moon Rave.
	This has been sufficient to keep the authorities from having 
	preknowledge of our events.  I personally hope that most organizers
	learn about e-mail and at least generate keys in case there comes
	a time that the Scene really needs secure communication between
	people (I think this time is not too far off).

	3) I have seen some activity by the libertarian party around
	the rave scene in SF.  I've thought this to be curious but as
	I think about it, it makes sense, many ravers would most likely
	embrace large portions (but not all) of the libertarian ideals.
	Most ravers are not overtly political in the classic sense of the word.
	Although there is sort of a "Politics of Ecstasy" :) so to speak,
	we find that a lot of the problems that the left is still struggling
	with like, equality for women and people of color (within their
	own ranks!) are non-issues for us.  We don't need affirmative action
	policies because as a social group, we are intensely homogenous, 
	when you party with people across race,gender,sexual orientation,
	lines, it become easy to work with them, you naturally build a network
	of trust that is multi-cultural.  As far as capitalism is concerned
	many young people in the Scene have developed their own companies
	from the selling of T-Shirts to "other things" that people buy at raves.
	They have no great love for "taxation" or interfearence by the "State"
	The scene is forging its own economic web and they are finding that
	economic co-operation is more productive then traditional competition,
	e-mail and encryption can help here. Raving IS a social political
	statement, sort of like the people in (pre) nazi germany who danced
	to swing,jazz,blues music which the nazis said was a "degenerate"
	type of music from the negro.  You can go to a rave, dance to socialy
	unacceptable music, confront Authority with a statement but not land
	in prison (at least not in this country).  Ultimately raving is not
	just another disco, it IS NOT a pick-up scene as most people going
	for that reason have discovered, it is not even a drug scene although
	there is drug use at raves (there are also some folks who have sex).
	The Scene IS about a persons right to CONSCIOUSNESS, knowledge and
	the right to think what ever thoughts s/he might want to think using
	whatever tools are at their disposal.  The main goal of the raves that
	I go to are to reach that ecstatic state that some refer to as
	"The Vibe".  This usually happens in the wee hours of the morning
	after 2 am when all the alcohol drinkers go home.  This state is
	accessable via drugs but you need the beat as well, advanced ravers
	don't need the drugs any more to go into trance, this type
	of trance dancing is little understood in the west but is common
	throughout africa, india and parts of the middle east.

	4) OK so the bottom line is I think that a SIMPLE flier informing
	these young people what is at stake as far as their present and
	future freedom of thought/speech/privacy sould be handed out.
	Low on rethoric, high on information.  Have a lap-top available
	for the advanced ones who know/comprehend what PGP is and want to
	be able to use it.  Don't blindly give out floopies, most will never
	be used.

	This message has been long but I wanted to INFORM the group who might
	have had preconceived ideas about the scene.  I am willing to
	answer any questions that anybody might have, off-line.

	All of this is true but are THEY really going to go through all
	of that trouble just to discover who HAS used drugs in the past?
	Seems like an expensive way to go about it.  Now I suppose THEY
	might get some judge to give them a search warrant based on the

	I suppose THEY could put this info in your file, but I'm
	sure there are already more "interesting" things in my file than an MDMA
	survey.  All in all, If I am suppose to live in the "land of the free"
	Why should I live in fear of answering a few questions that might
	help science down the line.  And if it is THEM at the other end of
	the wire, I hope you got your money's worth!

Well, I guess you can use any word you want.  But I would suggest you watch
who you say it to.  I mean if you say "n---..." to the wrong person you will
be brutalized.  That word is different in the sense (and I knew this was
coming since EVERYTHING these days is equated to african americans/civil
rights) of a historical perspective.  It is a dehumanizing word, and a
fighting word.  Oh, yes, you bandy it about FREELY here, but you damn well
know that you would be MUCH more careful uin the company of people of color.

As for good looking, that is much more a cultural thing.  To me a good
looking woman is NOT the skinny Crawford, Brinkley, whatever vanilla flavor
of the day model you see around with no ass.  For me a woman must have, uh,m
BACK, not a lot but enough.  Now for some cultures this is not appealing.
For other cultures good looking invovles scarification, or a woman who is
quite ample all over.  It all depends upon the perspective and the culture.
It really has NOTHING to do with inflammatory language.

Sure you can use whatever word you'd like, and you don't even have to give
an explanation.  But be prepared for ANY consequences that may happen when
you put such words into use.  Just as I have been prepared to explain what I
meant, you may have to do the same when using inflammatory language.

<in response to "some thoughts on words and things>

While I would certainly agree that we should be able to use what 
ever word we like, and more importantly that the definition of words is
important especaiily when confronting negative connotations such as occur
with the word "nigger" I might disagree with some of what you say both on
a practical and metaphysical level.

Practically words are given meaning through usage over a long period of
time or in response to a recent societal or technical change--such as the
introduction of words to cover recent technical advances in fields of
virtual reality, imaging etc.  In this manner we must at one level accept
that words are given a certain amount of meaning in how they are currently
used and while we are free to redefine them, if the reason for these words
is communication we must stay within a certain framework of commonly
accepted meaning.

On a metaphysical level I  would agree that we must have the freedom to
redefine words as we see fit, with the acknoledgement that we take
responsibilty for these words when we do this.  I believe that words
andlanguage are not aonly a response to thought but also shape and in a
sense constrain thought.  If we redefine words putting them in a new
context -- for example by removing the negative stereotype associated with
fords such as "nigger"  then we may be able to renegotiate an image
associated with those words.  However, I would say that this is a
difficult and arduous process--though not an impossible one and I agree
that there is great value in redefining words at certain times.

	I hope that this reponse is not too long--anyway what you said was
interesting and relevant to a community of individuals in touch through a
medium that is based only on written words and not on images.

John,

Yeah, I'm still black last time I looked...
as far as "lookin good" and the "n" word well I think it's OK to have your
preferences in life and if you tend to only want to sleep with African/European/
Lesbian etc that's your bussiness but when you make a blanket statement like
well "I don't mind if the women take off there clothes as long as the look
good"  this statement runs pretty close to being sexist (even if you didn't
mean it that way, it's the _internalized_ sexism that gets you and yes it
IS the same as if someone said "Well I don't care if the women take off their
clothes as long as they are blond" - sexist and racist.  Now in this society
statements like the above are accepted but they are STILL wrong, 30 years 
in the south, it was acceptable to address an african american that you didn;t
know on the stree as "Hey Nigger, come here" that doesn't mean that it was right
even if the person didn't mean to be hateful by the words, please listen to 
what the sista is trying to say to you about how SHE feels. Words are importent
these days not cause I'm going to start fighting cause someone calls me a nigger
but because the person who calls me that in the company of the other people on
the list will show themselves to be the stupid racist fool that s/he is and will
have a hard time correcting their reputation afterwards. (even if they were
just joking) I suggest you choose your words carefully my brutha because you
never know when you might have to eat them.

<in response to your discussion on "words">

I disagree quite strongly with that you have said about word choice. While
I too would argue that in practice we must watch what we say; however I
would not agree that we must accept words and their meanings as they are
presently defined.  I believe by accepting their present meaning without
questioning where and why theyhave this meaning (and more importantly if
this meaning is acceptable) we give words too much power and do not hold
anyone or anything accountable.

It is more important to continually review and revise how and why we are
using certain words--challenge the meaning and see if it is acceptable. 
Actively evaluate societies vocabulary.  This is notto say censor
vocabulary or word choice because that is perhaps even a greater crime,
but make sure that we are in control of language instead of letting the
language we use control us.

Hmmm....well would it have been better if I said:
"I don't mind if the women take off their clothes as long as they appeal to
me..." or "....look good to ME" or "...visually stimulating".  I mean when
can I say what I want to say the way I want to say it?  How are we to define
what is proper and not proper.  I expressed a personal preference. I don't
want to be next to smelly-non-bathing ravers, nor
guys-without-shirts scamming on girls/guys, nor some foole who has eaten
SPICY food all day and has come to sweat-it-out at a rave.  All of these
statements are preferences that are mine alone.  Because they exclude
someone does that make the words bad.  And REALLY is looking good (which is
usually culturally defined) the same or even in the same league as calling
someone a "nigger"?  This IMHO is REALLY reaching, all for the sake of being
PC.  So how do you state a prefernce without being LABELLED a BIGOT, RACIST,
AGEIST,whateverIST...or do you just REFRAIN from stating ANY preferences.

If someone were to say: "..as long as the women/men are blond and muscular"
or "...if they are middle eastern" are these just statements of preference,
or statements of intolerance/bigotry.  To me they are just staements of
preference.  And we should all be allowed to have a choice as to what we
like, FOR WHATEVER REASON.

The limiting of speech to make people feel good is annoying if not DANGEROUS

Subject: talkin bout...

wow... didnt quite expect taht reaction
and seeing as such i might need to clarify a few things

yes, john, 'nigger' and 'i only want naked women who look good'
are two different things...
but youre the one who likes to use inflammatory statements to get reactions

one sidenote first.. how bout teh term 'nigga'?
common usage among many african americans i know

my point is, though, dont say something that you think is going to
be misunderstood and then define it later when someone gets mad
hell i defined my usage of the word and people still thought it was bad

im not talking about having to say this or that
im just want to encourage definition
the guy in the south who uses the term 'nigger' doesnt know not to
until he is told and cant really be blamed
now once he has been told that that term is bad,
then it is up to him to change or not...
but until such a time his use of that does not mean that there is necesarily
disrespect being shown, just ignorance
and many people are ignorant of many things

and as far as good looking people go...
WHO CARES?
i agree.. hopefully everyone looks beautiful to someone else
so everyone should feel free to be naked 
cuz soemone will think they are beautiful
but it has nothing to do with looks
it has to do with freedom
and clothes arent a sign of freedom
they are a sign of society saying that you look too ugly to be looked at
or that unless you wear the right things you arent accetable
either way to get rid of those to impositions by society
is what will make everyone that much closer

Subject: Solstice in Utah

For all who are interested in a vacation out of the ordinary or DJing for
cheap, this is what I've got planned for June 18th-20th, the solstice weekend.

About three hours south of Salt Lake City is an area known as the San Rafael
Swell.  A friend went there last weekend, and among other things told me about
an old cowboy camp in the heart of a canyon there.  The San Rafael Swell is a
BLM area, which means you can do practically whatever you feel like (as long
as it isn't destructive).  There aren't any police, there aren't any rangers,
there is a small campground outside of the canyon.

The event will be donation, since there is no real way we can charge
admission.  Besides, it is really stupid to charge for an event of this sort
anyway.  There are a few outside DJs in the works, but we're asking them to
donate their time, so whether or not they'll do it is up in the air.  If
you're interested, contact me.

The choice is yours, travel to Wankerstock and pay mucho denero for empty
vibes, or travel to where the flavor is.

I've ordered good weather for this weekend, so it should be really spectacular
underneath the desert sky.  The sunsets here are red and purple, and there are
many little fluffy clouds.

	I found a cheap laser kit ( ~100$ ) at "Halted specialties co."

	HSC
	3500 Ryder St.
	Santa Clara, CA 95051

	Phone: (408) 732-1573	Fax: (408) 732-6428


	The kit contain a small laser, the power supply and a motorized mirror
	to create simple effects (no computer connection).

	They also sell big laser tube, motors, mirrors and lens.

	To connect a computer, I think you should look for a controller
	for a step motor and use the step motor instead of the normal one.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	A few year ago I read an article on a magazine and they was suggesting
	to use a speaker to create laser figures.

	You take a big speaker, remove the paper around and leave only the 
	cover on the coil. Then you fix a mirror on that, connect the speaker
	to a music source and direct the laser light on the mirror.

I beg to differ. How many government nets will your supposedly anonymous
message pass through before it hits the remailer? Perhaps EVEN BEFORE IT
HITS THE INTERNET it'll end up on your corporate
mail-exchanger-to-the-outside-world where some nosy geek will scan your
messages for confidential corporate secrets and/or drug-talk. Or maybe
it'll pass through UUNET and get handed over to the NSA on mag-tape. Or
maybe it'll hit an NSF-net backbone where the government has every right to
snoop onto the data you're txmitting.

Sorry... WITHOUT SECURE, TRAPDOORLESS ENCRYPTION the only way to send an
anonymous message is to forge it yourself -- make it anonymous at the
source. It is unfortunate that one has to resort to subterfuge in order to
fight big-brother's deceit.  Of course, forging should be used ethically --
to protect yourself, rather than spoofing others.

Alternately, alot of freedom lies in low-tech solutions -- print it out,
fill it in, and mail it through the US post without a return address.

Or even better, do what I'm doing -- ignore the survey. What I do is
nobody's bizness but my own, science and surveys notwithstanding.

But... don't even try some mindless positivity-trip, stating that the
solution to this "is just around the bend" with the Clipper chip snafu....
A very artful technology railroading job by the government, i must admit,
which makes me even more suspicious. (Thanks prez. clinton, your true colors
are shining through...)

I am very interested in going to this I will just getting back from Puerta
Vallarta that thursday evening so I wouldnt be able to leave until Friday.  Is
anybody interested in driving with me, I dont have a car but I am insured and
can share in the drive.  I also have lots of camping stuff.

If their is enough interest we might be able to rent a car (VAN) for the trip. 
It might be difficult to find an unlimited milage rental agency that will allow
for out of state trips.

Huh?,  Man someone wrote me (or the list) and directed a question to me,
WHICH I answered in half-jest that "yeah, a nude rave is ok as long as the
permits..." blah, blah, blah.  Jest, jest, JEST!  Jeez!  Now all of a
sudden I like to say things just to spark controversy?  No I may say things
that are controversial, but I do have fun as well.  I do not say things just
to get a reaction, since that is so simplistic.  I think that the things I
say get a reaction moreso than me actually doing it for such purposes alone.

As for inflammatory language?  I dunno, YOU used the word "nigger" to make a
point...I do not use such language EVER to make a point.  My previous posts
are evidence of that fact.

In any case some things should be taken quite seriously, many things should
not.  I do not want EACH word I say to be deconstrcuted and toiled over to
find something for people to flame me for, but if that is how people get
their jollies then fine.  

First it was:
- 18+ permits = John S. Lee is an AGEIST

Now it is:
- as long as the women look good = John S. Lee is a SEXIST.

Oh well. I guess if I want NO controversy I better choose my words
carefully....uh, I don't think so. I say what I mean and mean what I say.
And in between all of this OVER-SERIOUS, OVER-ANYLYTICAL,
OVER-INTELLECTUALIZATION, there is fun.  And that IS what it is all about.

RAVES = FUN.
PEOPLE = FUN.
CONVERSATION = STIMULATION = FUN.
MEDITATION = CONCENTRATION = INTERNALIZATION = RELAXATION = FUN.

And I will offer no retraction from the previous or anything else that I
have said.  I cannot account for peoples paranoia or insecurities.  All I
can do is be myslef, be true to that which is me, and define myself and NOT
let others do it for me.  That way I have peace of mind and harmony with
myself and those around me.  So in parting, look good, feel good, be
good...but it is MOST important to look good, since that IS ALL that
matters...isn't it? ;) 
(note the sarcasm, of the last sentence...if you can't hang, flame me
persoanlly, but keep the shit off the list...too much juice!).

Hey they are one of my favorite part of Raves.  Now that I think about it I
will retract what I have said about shirtless guys.  The thing that I didnt
like about before is that they would just take their shirt off stand around and
look, Project attitude and that kinda stuff.  I am sure the same thing goes for
many of the Underwear girlz too.  

Coming from me I find it an incredible turn on, and the woman doesnt have to be
a cosmopolitan model. I dont lear or drool over them but I do like it.  Hell I
am Hetersexual with a insatiable sexual appetite what can I say. By the way I
met my girlfreind at rave with a similar appetite.

Being heteral doesnt mean I dont appreciate guys bods.  I find it very
stimulating looking at a guy with a nice body(as long as he is not projecting
attitude) it is very motivating to keep myself inshape.

...for us to say is "I was wrong."  Even a tiny bit of retraction is often
more difficult and painful than wholesale rejection.  We, as a group, are
doing what we are despite large-scale rejection from the mass of society, 
and often have to take solace in thinking that despite all this, we just
*know* we're doing the *right* thing -- so losing even a small part of
our perceived foundation can be painful.

Me, I used to want to be right all the time 'cause it was my only defense 
against everyone else telling me what a misfit I was.  I still like to be
right, but I like having fun more.  "I told you so, this was gonna suck"
is not very fun in the long run.  I'd rather be able to say "Well, it sucks
now, but at least we had fun trying" or "Wow!  This doesn't suck anymore!"

Wow, I'm sounding pretentious.  Valuing brevity has its disadvantages.

If you continue to say it and they express to you that it hurt them

Well, the whole point of the cypherpunks remailer is that is uses PGP.
And the whole point of PGP is that it provides SECURE, TRAPDOORLESS
ENCRYPTION for the masses -- it's pd (there are legal problems with
using it in the US, though, and with importing or exporting it from
the US).  Of course, in order to achieve a real level of security you
would probably want to run it on a PC, and carry with you a bootable
floppy with a copy of PGP.

Having over-reacted to what I thought was Geoff overstating slightly
the security of these systems, I have to say that you are
underestimating the technology available to us for free.

Also, you might be interested to know that the reason you can't use
PGP in the US has nothing to do with the government.  It's simply
because a company called Publik Key Partners owns the rights to a
number of patents.  And all Publik Key Partners are interested in
doing with the patents is making money from them...  That's the way
the system works...

Our company, FringeWare, has been out doing brain machine demos at
raves for a while..  I'm still trying to catch up on sleep from last
weekend's rave construction & show :-)

The raves started as socio/politial but in many places have become 
yet-another-club-hop-for-kids-with-time-to-kill.

Even so, sentiments are in the right place, guaranteed.  Especially
among the *RAVE PROMOTERS* ..  The promoters are already sensitive to
issues in common with cypherpunks since they tend to be underground
operations in the cash economy, etc.  Plus, they're HEAVILY networked.

As a techno/gonzo journalist, I've found it EASIER to get in with hacker
cliques than with rave promoter cliques; granted the real stakes are 
higher so they take security more seriously :-)

Also, I'm intrigued to see the overlap (at least in this area) between
ravers and people at EFF-Austin mtgs..  Some of the main u/g promoters
even showed up to EFF-A's CopCon a couple weeks back, so the overlap
in our agendas is valid.

I'd tend to go with the argument that actually signing keys or passing
out pamphlets during a rave would be weird and blow the mood.  Maybe you'd
say "So what?" but to an entertainment promoter, mood means everything 
and only a few cypherphuckups would spread a terrible image for us.  I'm
generally the most hi-tech part of these raves, what with the sound/light
brain gizmos and even that's too left-brained some ravers..  Most want to
experience, not engage in discourse.  With pheromones and alkaloids
being some of the dominant attractions for people attending, I could
agree more :-)

Which is why I'd suggest we tag along with the VRrave project, based on
IRC connex between concurrent raves.  That'd present a hi-tech set & 
setting and allow for some demo/experience of secure comm.  

Do what you can to introduce/instruct the local promoters -- but 
generally they're busy people with better things to worry about, like
liability and overhead not somebody else's political agenda.

It must be homogenous with the rave. For example, in the chillout room, you
put a mind machine, a vrave connection, an electronic LED race (it's way
cool to either create or modify handheld games into huge "techno" games),
and finally several PCs, modified as "rave machines(tm)" :) with some people
to explain how to get the keys, how to exchange them, what you can do with it,
and emphasize the cool side...

The majority or ravers in Montreal know about raves thru my radio show, Raving
Up North (emaill list) or my interactive phone line. I regularly talk about
the net, internet issues, etc... (been doing that for 2 years) so most people
know what the net is really about and they send lots of mail when the written
press around here screw up). Another point, i'll be doing a rave on may 8th
and the ravers have dubbed it the cyberpunk rave, even if it's called
Rave en couleur...

Vrave is used in the east coast too. Twould be really cool if some rave from
the west coast be connected may 8th... i'll probably have 2 lines here.

As most people who are heavily "connected". There is an article in the may/june
issue of wired about a guy called cursor cowboy who wants to connect everybody
he meets. Speaking of wired, i've read the article on crypto rebels aka
cypherpunks. What do you think? Please respond to me since i am not on
cypherpunks anymore because the traffic was too heavy and religious when i was
on.

UTAH SOLSTICE INFORMATION LIST INFO
-----------------------------------

The alias "solstice" is a mailing list provided to give information regarding
the Solstice event in the Utah San Rafael Swell desert area from the evening
of June 19th to the morning of June 21st, 1993.

At the creation of this list, several acts were being worked upon, with no
actual confirmations.  Confirmations and scheduling will be sent to the list
as they happen.

People around the country, and even Mexico have expressed interest in
attending.  Ride information can also be sent and requested on the mailing
list.

Although "Taste" productions is in charge of the event, there is no way we can
do it alone.  This is a FREE event, but donations are requested and needed.
Because this is on Bureau of Land Managment land, there isn't much regulation
as to what we can and can not do.  There also isn't much in the way of
showers, bathrooms, and luxury condominiums.  Realize that things may not be
completely comfortable, but this has the potential to be an event that will
not be forgotten.  Your participation and help is crucial, please offer what
you can.

i agree - men are judged by standards from popular culture also.  HOWEVER, 
in our culture, women are appraised/surveyed/judged for their appearance much
more than men, particularly heterosexual men, are.  "men act, women appear."
- john berger.   overall, women consume diet programs, books, etc. and have 
eating disorders and negative body images, and more concern about their

	No u r not the only one, I'm with u too.

I also like to add something: we should try to keep these discussions about 
specific topics (like Nitrous or America versus Europe) readable.
What I mean is that if we all keep posting very long e-mail with two or three
level of cross-references, we basically create a useless network traffic
that most of the people on the list won't be able to read (for time reasons
mostly). 

So let's try to be always open-minded and not ready to flame someone else
right away and let's also try to post e-mails that fit in one page unless
is really necessary to make them longer.
Last but not least let's try to post only when we are adding significant
informations to the discussion that is going on and not post only because
is cool to post or replay.

Well sure, mainly because the laws of our popular culture are largely
defined by heterosexual males.  Doesn't everyone know that the  saying 
"bald men are sexy" was invented by a bunch of balding old men?

But anyway, one thing I've noticed while raving is that people can feel
beautiful about themselves in a way that is largely independent from 
mainstream culture's brainwashing.  When people feel like they are part
of something beautiful, then they themselves can share in the beauty, and
it often brings out a sense of beauty in them that can be seen/felt by 
those around them.  Man, there are times that I just want to hug *all*
of these people.

And yes, the outward expression of inner beuaty can also be a sexual turn 
on.  Personally, I find myself more attracted to someone who expresses a 
beautiful vibe that I can connect with over some model with an attitude. 
I think this is what is sometimes referred to as "love", something this
world could use a bit more of.

Subject: net rubber-necking......

What's up with all these hang-ups people are chattering about on the
network?  American culture (if that's what it is) is getting too hung
up on things like verbal acceptability.  Are people intellectually so
fragile that trauma results from the recognition of a concept?

I can understand why a politician may create euphemistic terms such
as "revenue enhancements" instead of saying "tax increases" because part
of the goal is to subtly deceive a group by not directly stating the
true intent (i.e. intentially creating an additional level of abstraction).
But must the average person be dragged into this also?  Life is hard
enought without having to worry about what concepts are acceptable (and
yes, each word/phrase, if intelligible, is a concept).

Does everyone see what I'm getting at?  The issue here is censorship.
I often find myself spending ridiculous amounts of time trying to figure
out if what I wrote would be emotionally "acceptable" to the people
reading it.  Lawsuits and who knows what else could happen as the result
of a "mistake" (the interesting thing here is that most of the censorship
in our daily lives is not by the government, but by our peers).

Perhaps, I'm just to idealistic, but I think of the enormous amounts of
time and money which are sunk into worring about what is "correct" and
what is not when NASA has trouble funding space exploration, our educational
system is crumbling, etc...  

Maybe it's time that people start to look at society less as a group 
of individuals and more of as a single entity.  People these days are so 
wrapped up in themselves that they forget they are part of a larger group
and their actions effect everyone around them.  I think that this is
why the "rave" scene is dying.  When I first started going to "raves" a few
years ago, the one word that summed up what a "rave" was, was "community".

Nobody worried about what kinds of shoes to wear, or passing water bottles
(there used to be people who had water bottles with spouts on them, and
if you looked exceptionally hot or thirsty they'd squirt some water
into your mouth), or much of anything else.  Everyone was there to share
an experience together.  Most of the "raves" I've been to in the past year
have been comprised mostly of groups of individuals projecting attitudes; it's
like being at the X or some other dance club (even the music they both play
is starting to merge).  Anyway, I've rambled on enough....


                            Jon.

P.S. I apologize to those who feel this topic is wasted bandwith as far
     as this group - and that this groups should focus more on "raves"
     and "rave" experiences because I agree.  But so much mail has been
     passed regarding "status quo" that I had to say something...

no matter how right you know you are ...

the most effective way of dealing with the police is to be VERY
calm, polite, and respectful - despite the completely lame experiences
most everyone has had with the cops.

If they suspect that you are not sober or they approach a
situation where they expect people to not be sober (party/rave)
they will treat everyone rudely and without respect.
They are following procedure.  
They are not trained to do otherwise.

here boy  fetch!  good boy    do you want a treat??? 

Don't waste your energy at the scene.  File a complaint later if
you feel they were out of line.

Well, I *was* that way with the cops at Charter Oak at Connection 2, but the
Sargeant didn't feel like cutting me any slack...  maybe it was when I 
offered them some donuts....

Very definitely. 2 weeks ago there was a rave in Montreal. 2 cops came to see
what was going on. They made the dj stop the music and turn on the lights.
They checked to see if there was alcool. Since there was not and everyone was
cooperative, they let the party go back on. 1 cop even tried a mind machine!
Before leaving they asked an organiser if they could come back, cause it was
really cool!

> If they suspect that you are not sober or they approach a

> they will treat everyone rudely and without respect.

Here they are mostly going for alcool (you can serve or sell if you have a
permit, but until 3 am only. They tend to be pretty rude when alcool is
present), so when they find out that there are only fruit juice, soda and
water, that nice people go see them smiling and giving them lollipops, they
can only smile back. Happiness is contagious!

Of course in cities like LA, W.DC or NY where people are so violent cops are
extremely prudent and have a different vision than cops in Montreal or
Boston (I would put SF in there too from the trips i've made there) which are
more understanding (of course drugs are a very little part of the scene here,
so it may be another reason. I understand that the SF scene is more drug
oriented, or maybe this is a false impression i got from the net).

Word, I hear what you are saying, but when you enter into an interaction
with an officer in a completely non-threatening way and they return the
favor by responding to you like you never graduaded from 1st grade and you
just rolled around in shit it is hard to maintain a calm polite and 
respectful attitude. At some point you get sick of swallowing your pride
and dignity, which is more important to me than trying to come out on
top of your dealings with the man (especially when you have to enter
via smelly posterior to get there). If you are used to seeing how police
operate in the 'hood' you will know how out of hand the situation is. It
is not even funny. Oh shit, don't get me started! Anyway, not trying to
be argumentative, just adding on.

Generalities are dangerous.  No one (or city), no matter where they live, is
exempt from violence, and along with that thought....I have lived in
quite a few places in my life, and SF (the Bay Area) is one of the most
nonthreatening places to live (IMHO).  Just random thoughts, mumble,

Let's read line 2 and 3. I say that Montreal and Boston are safe cities and
that i would put SF in that same category. It seems to go in the same sense
as what you say, so why "generalities are dangerous"?

The thing i was asking is about the cops reactions: are they really bad in SF?
Wouldn't that be because of the drugs?

Just some sequential toughts... :)

But women STILL take off their tops and show off plenty of flesh when they
want to at a rave huh?  The fact is the truly liberated individual could
give a shit WHAT people think about their appearance, as long as the person
is happy with who they are it should not make a diff what ANYONE thinks.

I know PLENTY of women on this scene with that general attitude, and they
are BEAUTIFUL.  Both in appearance, and spirit/soul.  I think that it all
comes COMPLETELY from within.  It ain't necessarily a body thang as much as
it is a vibe/soul thang.  If she has confidence in who SHE is, does not let
the outside world define who and what she is, takes her sexuality into her
own hands, and empowers herself, then she is BEAUTIFUL.

The idea that women are victims of mass media has some truth.  But isn't it
the relinquishing of women of their innate powers as humans the real
problem?  I like powerful women.  Women with confidence in who they are.
Women who can be themselves without fear of what any male fuck thought.
That is beauty/power.  The last person I want to deal with is some woamn
(this also goes for male, but were talking nekkid women here :)  ) who is so
insecure that she looks to Jenny Craig, or the flavor-of-the-day diet
because she is sooo disssatisfied with who she is.  To damn neurotic for my
tastes.

Women who take those clothes off at parties MUST be confident in who they
are, and have decided to take their OWN inititative regardless of what
anyone thinks.  THIS is the nekkid woman I want to see...oh yeah...SHE LOOKS
GOOD!

Uh, where do you live in SF?  Man there are places even the cops won't
venture to in THIS non-threatening city.  This is ONE of THE most densly
populated areas in the US, and despite all that hippie past, there is a
smoldering underbelly that burps all too often of late.

For the most part cops here are REAL cool.  You want screwed, check out LA,
of better yet MIAMI.  SF is a breeze.  I have talked to many officers about
their jobs and parties.  All have been very cool (and this means something
to me since Rodney King is too close for comfort).

I have found if you deal with them on the up & up, deal with them
RESPECTFULLY, and stop trying to make a point and cooperate, you will have
no probelm for the most part.  Start the wise-cracks, and you're busted.
Whoever has the gun, has the power.  Historical fact!

I am not saying I love cops (I don't), but I have called them when I had to
and they were fiendly and responsive (no I don't live in a 100+k house, just
and apartment.  Nor do I live in the BEST neighborhood, just an ok one (not
the little "o")).

Greetings to everyone.  I apologise for the massive cross post, but I'm 
hoping some of you can give me a little information.  I'm conducting a 
VERY BRIEF survey for rave and club DJ's and I would very much appreciate 
your assistance.  Please don't waste list bandwidth by replying there...just 
reply to me personally.  If anyone else is interested in the results, send me 
a note, and I'll forward the results once they're compiled.  On a few 
questions, I ask "What is the average..." or "approx. how many...".  Please 
don't take a lot of time to figure this stuff out, just make the best 
guesstimate you can.  Once again, I really appreciate your time in answering 
these questions. 

1. Do you spin in clubs, raves, both, _other_?

2. What is your preferred medium? (i.e. vinyl, CD, other(?))

3. On the average what is the amount of vinyl that you are receiving? CD's? 
   Other?

4. Do you mix CD's?  If so, approx. what percentage of your set is CD and 
   what percentage is vinyl?

5. What type of CD player do you generally use?

3. Do you or the club you spin at belong to a record distribution service
   (i.e. Rockpool)?  If so, which one?

4. What is the average song length you play?  Average BPM's?

5. How do you determine what to play?  For example, do you watch the charts, 
   go through the new records and pull out your favorites, shop for new music 
   on your own, etc.

6. Do you network with other DJ's?

If you'd like to add any additional comments, please feel free to do so.

Well...  here are my findings, as promised.  The article was called "Carry

& arrests) at raves grabbing the headlines in the coming summer.  Here's as
much of it as I could be bothered typing:  :-)

	The week-long Castlemorton event in Worcestershire last May
	was the largest ever unlicenced party in this country,
	attracting somewhere between the police's estimate of 20,000
	and the organisers' claimed 50,000.  Police were accused of
	not stopping the party before it got out of control but this
	year, the government in proposing wide-ranging new powers to
	allow police to stop illegal raves more quickly.  These
	include the power to turn back anyone travelling to a rave
	within a radius of five miles.  They also allow the seizure
	of amplification equipment and forcing ravers to leave a
	site.  For the first time, these measures will make the mere
	act of attending an unlicenced event a criminal offence.
	Home Office Minister Earl Ferrers told Venue this week that
	the new measures "are justified in the light of the serious
	mischief they are seeking to prevent and will be welcomed by
	law-abiding citizens throughout the country."

	But many illegal party organisers feel such measures are
	already being used by the police.  They point to the 40-mile
	excursion zone set up around the White Goddess Festival in
	Cornwall last summer.  Though the new police powers will not
	come into force until next summer, many are fearing a more
	aggressive police response to illegal events this summer.

5  132  06:01 Strange Attractor
6  129  09:34 Elevator

Comments:  A solo member of Psychick Warrior's Ov Gaia presents their first
album.  Although I found his later release, "Reassembling Reality" to be very
interesting, "Dream Night Dance Music" suffers from meandering track syndrome.
Where the artist starts off with a good idea, then has no way of finishing it.
All of the tracks are trancey, but rather shallow.  Nice to listen to, but
hard to stay moving for the full length.

Summary: 6/10.  Not as good as later releases or PWOG material.  Nice
ambient-with-a-beat listening.


Quazar: Seven Stars
Go Bang!: BANG CD 097
1  129  05:04 (FF Into) The Future
2  130  03:56 Last Train to Paradise
3  128  03:31 Take-Off
4  126  03:02 Quazar in Motion
5  128  04:51 Revolution
6  130  03:30 The Underworld
7  128  04:50 Cycledrops
8       00:44 The Star
9  129  04:18 Change for the Better
10 126  06:28 Dragonfighters
11 128  05:34 Thundermountain
12 126  02:21 Moon Turns the Tides
13 126  04:42 Seven Stars
14 126  03:19 Dayglo

Comments:  Quazar holds their own with many original ideas from house to
trance.  Tracks like the house remake of "(FF Into) The Future" and the
trancey supreme "Dragonfighters" show their ability and range.  There are a
few dragging moments though, especially near the end with the especially
boring "Moon Turns the Tides" and the title track "Seven Stars".  Yet these
two failures can easily be overlooked by a band that is really a _band_, some
superb production, and twelve other strong tracks.

Summary: 7/10.  Very expensive import.  Recommended to house and trance fans.


The Grid: Heartbeat
Virgin: VSCDT 1427
1   98  04:01 Heartbeat (Radio Edit)
2  126  05:29 Heartbeat (Back to the Future Mix)
3  126  05:27 Heartbeat (Purple Heart Mix)
4   98  04:44 Heartbeat (456 Mix)

Comments:  A poppy, sweet, smooth entry for the Grid.  Reminds me to the death
of System 7's "Freedom Fighters", but I like this more.  Weirdly enough, they
had it right the first time, with the original "Radio Edit" and "456 Mix".  In
the attempt to speed it up with the other two mixes, they lost the magic this
song has entirely.

Summary: 4/10.  If you have the album, "456" already, forget purchasing this.
The "Radio Edit" is slightly better, but not that much.


Paradise 3001: Tales of Northern & Southern Hemispheres
ESP: 9122-2
1  128  03:51 Long Distance Call to Heaven
2  128  04:43 Normizon 5AM
3  128  04:36 Gonna Take Me Up (Pt 1)
4  128  04:21 Gonna Tape Me Up (Pt 2)
5  128  02:27 Espaces

Comments:  Really one track with different names, and not much variation.  The
only remixing done here was adding and subtracting vocals and instrumentation
lines.  "Normizon 5AM" is my favorite since it manages to throw in a heavy
drum line mid-way through the sitting-on-synthesizer trance.  Both "Gonna Take
Me Up" tracks are virtually the same, in fact, I was surprised to find myself
listening to the second track, when I thought the first hadn't ended.  These
tracks are where the vocal sample is introduced and frankly I don't like it
much.

Summary: 3/10.  Slightly cool, mostly waste.  Definitely a disappointing
release from Dr. Nunu.


Exquisite Corpse: Strange Attractor
Kk: KK 082 CDS
1  131  07:14 Strange Attractor
2  124  08:06 X-Out

Comments:  Short with long tracks, this single is really empty.  Bassy rhythms
repeated over and over and over and over, with little variation.  It possibly
might be useful for mixing or insomnia, but otherwise there isn't much here.

Summary: 2/10.  Sounds more like a two track "breaks" disc.


The Wolfgang Press: Mama Told Me Not To Come
4AD: 9 40674-2
1  115  03:19 Mama Told Me Not To Come (7 Inch)
2  115  06:59 Mama Told Me Not To Come (Go Back)
3  103  03:34 Birmingham (7 Inch)
4  104  08:27 Birmingham to Jerusalem (138 bpm outro)
5  115  04:26 Mama Told Me Not To Come (Up All Night)

Comments: The domestic release of a song that is almost two years old now, but
has been remixed in a very good way.  The remixes included on the original
import were good, but not great.  The "Go Back" remix grabs that great funky
drum and just jerks you around the room.  "Up All Night" emphasizes the
strings for a bit stronger effect.  The "7 Inch" mixes of both the title and
"Birmingham" are different from the album, especially "Birmingham".  Finally,
"Birmingham to Jerusalem" sweeps into a fantastic majestic second piece, the
only problem is this track is really poorly recorded.

Summary: 8/10.  Decent funky funk.  The best remake in the past five years.


Young American Primitive
ZoeMagik Records: ZM-CD001
1       00:20 Intro
2  125  06:05 Trance Formation
3       00:48 Flux
4  127  06:09 Young American Primitive
5  122  06:12 Ritual
6  104  08:04 Sunrise
7   86  04:20 Daydream
8  105  06:51 Over and Out
9  120  06:48 These Waves
10      05:06 Monolith Part One
11 130  07:27 Monolith Part Two

Comments:  San Francisco's Young American Primitive gives us an original sound
with a measured amount of experimentation.  Bouncey bright melodies with
strong rhythms as well as slow ambience that both depend on female vocal
samples that are modified in a subtle manner.  Other samples are well picked,
and not overused.  Things tend to get samey and sometimes plodding on the
longer songs.  I really enjoy the title track as well as "These Waves" which
were both on his original EP, but are great to have on CD now.  "Ritual" and
"Trance Formation" follow in a close second.

Summary: 8/10.  YAP's more upbeat stuff is better than his drippy ambience.  A
good overall album, but leaves you with an empty stomach when you finish.

I have read really bad things about the illegal raves in the country sides
outside london.  I heard that Raves squat on a piece of property have their
RAVE  totally trash the place and then leave afterwards leaving all thier
garbage behind for the land owner to deal with.

If this is true no wonder the goverments taking such a harsh stand to it.  Your
not going to get any respect if you dont show it yourself.

Subject: This week's RAVE guide

	Hi!  Since it's been a lovely week weather-wise, I thought a 
picnic outdoors would be cool, so we can meet each other, soak in
some sun, play frisbee, etc... not a "rave" (there will be no sound
system, but please bring boomboxes) but just a friendly get-together,
like the east bay picnic a year ago.  Anyways, after a bit of deliberation
on the planners list, it looks like Rengstorff Park in Mountain View is 
our best option.

DIRECTIONS:  Take the 101, exit on Rengstorff (this may also be called
Amphitheatre Parkway if coming from the south) and head south-west (away
from the bay).  Go about a mile, cross the train tracks, and make a left
on Crisanto.  The park is right at that corner, and you should find 
parking right after the turn.  I'll try and get there early and reserve 
some tables.  Be sure and bring:  food (for yourself, or to share - no
cooking facilities unfortunately), water, boomboxes, tapes, blankets, 
frisbees/bubbles/anything for fun in the sun, sunblock, etc.  Come see
the faces behind the flames!  :)

Now, as for parties this weekend:  Tonight the cyber forum looks like
fun.  I'll be there hadning out info about SFRaves :)  After that,
Conception looks promising, but I know there must be other stuff going
on too... maybe checking out the weeklies would be a good idea (Zanzibar
is always worth it).

Saturday, after the park :) there's quite a few parties.  Wickeds are
usually very highly regarded, the music is guaranteed to be great and
the people usually quite friendly, but it's at a 21+ club... I may
try and check out Unification, since the phone message says it'll be
outdoors.  Groove Kitchen is happening at the King Street Garage (right
next door to Wicked) and Moonpup says he's spinning, but the phone 
message right now says:

"Hello... Always remember, whether baked, or fried, always enjoy the 
chicken"

Preston has a WEIRD sense of humor :)

Sunday morning, Dante's playing at Tilt-a-Whirl, so I'd definitely try
to make that if you want to hear a cool trancey set from a highly regarded
East Coast DJ.  As for the park... the phone # has been disconnected, so
I don't know what's up (Shawn??)....

Whatever you do, have fun, play safe.... and hopefully see you Saturday!

Subject: This week's RAVE guide

	Hi!  Since it's been a lovely week weather-wise, I thought a 
picnic outdoors would be cool, so we can meet each other, soak in
some sun, play frisbee, etc... not a "rave" (there will be no sound
system, but please bring boomboxes) but just a friendly get-together,
like the east bay picnic a year ago.  Anyways, after a bit of deliberation
on the planners list, it looks like Rengstorff Park in Mountain View is 
our best option.

DIRECTIONS:  Take the 101, exit on Rengstorff (this may also be called
Amphitheatre Parkway if coming from the south) and head south-west (away
from the bay).  Go about a mile, cross the train tracks, and make a left
on Crisanto.  The park is right at that corner, and you should find 
parking right after the turn.  I'll try and get there early and reserve 
some tables.  Be sure and bring:  food (for yourself, or to share - no
cooking facilities unfortunately), water, boomboxes, tapes, blankets, 
frisbees/bubbles/anything for fun in the sun, sunblock, etc.  Come see
the faces behind the flames!  :)

Now, as for parties this weekend:  Tonight the cyber forum looks like
fun.  I'll be there hadning out info about SFRaves :)  After that,
Conception looks promising, but I know there must be other stuff going
on too... maybe checking out the weeklies would be a good idea (Zanzibar
is always worth it).

Saturday, after the park :) there's quite a few parties.  Wickeds are
usually very highly regarded, the music is guaranteed to be great and
the people usually quite friendly, but it's at a 21+ club... I may
try and check out Unification, since the phone message says it'll be
outdoors.  Groove Kitchen is happening at the King Street Garage (right
next door to Wicked) and Moonpup says he's spinning, but the phone 
message right now says:

"Hello... Always remember, whether baked, or fried, always enjoy the 
chicken"

Preston has a WEIRD sense of humor :)

Sunday morning, Dante's playing at Tilt-a-Whirl, so I'd definitely try
to make that if you want to hear a cool trancey set from a highly regarded
East Coast DJ.  As for the park... the phone # has been disconnected, so
I don't know what's up (Shawn??)....

Whatever you do, have fun, play safe.... and hopefully see you Saturday!

Here's some of what I'm playing right now.  Highly suggested stuff for 
just about anyone but the hahhhwdkoah.

If you can't find this stuff where you are contact Acid Boy Todd P on the 
net - he can probably hook you up with some of it.  (Sorry, I don't know 
his address from memory but if you need it send me mail.)


Lion Rock - 'Packet of Peace' - deConstruction, UK
  A: Prankster Sound System Mix
  B: No More Fucking Trumpets Mix, Instrumental Mix
Justin Robertson is back with help from MC Buzz B.  Acidic Trancehaus 
with vocals that aren't lame, for a change.  Very Robertson-esque as is 
expected.  This is the MUST HAVE for this issue.  

290 North - 'Spirit of 93' - Tomahawk, UK
  A: Judgement Mix
  B: Skins Up Mix
Very synthy wavering trance line with a house 'tude.  A couple annoying 
orchestra hits in the main mix, but it works well overall.  Fairly 
typical trance that doesn't really sound that typical.

Exoterix - 'Void' - Positiva, UK
  A: Original Mix, Fuckycats Subrosa Bonus
  B: Diss-cuss Remix, Art of Dance Club Mix
Uplifting house with trance influences.  Repetitive female vocals of 
'there's a void where there should be ecstasy.'  Nice piano breaks and DJ 
Malcolm does another wonderful remix job on the flip turning into 
hypnotic trance.

Liberator - 'Stand Above Me' - UCR Promo, UK
  A: Stand Above Me
  B: A 10 Minute Therapy Session Into Hyperlife
The most original song of this issue.  Subtle breakbeats with a train 
whistle chugging along over driving bassline and high trance melodies.  
If you listen to the ambient breaks while under the influence of MDMA it 
might cause implosion.  Great use of pitch bend really wacks the mind.  
The flip is standard repetitive trance.

Balouga Boys - 'Iceni' - Cowboy Promo, UK
  A: Iceni Remix
  B: Iceni
Cowboy is back after a short hiatus following Talizman.  This is typical 
Cowboy but no one does it better.  Follows the traditional Cowboy 
formula, fairly tribal, piano break, driving bassline, but you don't hear 
me complaining about that.  Keep 'em coming.

Jens Lissat Project - 'Energy Flow' - JL, Belgium
  A: Original Mix, Remix
  B: House Core, Alibba on E, Trance Core Still
'Energy...Flow...Eternal.'  The Original Mix is melodic, hypnotic, and 
mesmerizing.  Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the other mixes.  
Theres a lot of stuff coming out of Europe proper nowadays that is 
getting housier and that makes me happy.

Miro - 'Pure Silk' - Effective (White Label), UK
  A: ?
  B: ?
This is a white label from Effective with the name of the group and song 
handwritten on it.  One side is upbeat trance that is somewhere between 
house and hardtrance, if you can imagine that.  The second is slower 
trance.  Highly suggested - I think this gets general release any time 
now.

Acorn Arts - 'Vanilla' - X-Gate, UK
  A: Vanilla
  B: Speed Controller
Vanilla sounds like Acorn Arts using a hardtrance influence and they do 
it well.  But Speed Controller is the gem - it's now my favorite Acorn 
Arts track.


Some other suggestions:

Morgan King - I Am Free (Slam Remixes!)
Kaos - (Re)Definition of Love (1993 Remixes)
No Mass - Hands of Stone
Masters of the Monotonal Groove - Show Me/Keep Pumpin
Bandito - San Andreas/Loco
Van Basten - The Lizard King
Eden - Do You Feel 4 Me (older but still going strong)
2 Examples - Just Can't Help Me (also older - still going strong)
Fishbone Beat - Always
Ritmo De Vida - Taboo


That's all for now.  Any more info or comments, send me mail.

trance.  Highly suggested - I think this gets general release any time 
now.

Acorn Arts - 'Vanilla' - X-Gate, UK
  A: Vanilla
  B: Speed Controller
Vanilla sounds like Acorn Arts using a hardtrance influence and they do 
it well.  But Speed Controller is the gem - it's now my favorite Acorn 
Arts track.


Some other suggestions:

Morgan King - I Am Free (Slam Remixes!)
Kaos - (Re)Definition of Love (1993 Remixes)
No Mass - Hands of Stone
Masters of the Monotonal Groove - Show Me/Keep Pumpin
Bandito - San Andreas/Loco
Van Basten - The Lizard King
Eden - Do You Feel 4 Me (older but still going strong)
2 Examples - Just Can't Help Me (also older - still going strong)
Fishbone Beat - Always
Ritmo De Vida - Taboo


That's all for now.  Any more info or comments, send me mail.

Just a small correction. Groove Kitchen occurs at Big Heart City, 836
Mission, and Wicked is happening at the King Street Garage, 174 King

I'll be there.  A lot of people showed up the week before last and
hung out in the sun... it was very cool.

I strongly encourage anyone and everyone to come!  We don't need a

another.

I'll bring the "rave-in-a-bag" (tm) and my golden retriever, plus, of

Still thinking about Richard Sun's Beltane thing.  I could use a 3-ring

And I like Eddie Richards & Mark Farina; they were great at Groove Kitchen
a couple weeks back.

The Beltane phone line promises "Artemis will dance with the horned one".
Sounds logical to me!

sometimes yes, sometimes no.  blacks are individuals too you know (or do you?)

i think both had alot to say, give and teach.  MANY whites say what you are

perhaps realize that after so much abuse, blacks (and other trod upon peoples)

whites are responsible or racist, nor that all blacks (or others) realize this.
still, so what?

Subject: Re: cops & racism

Chris,

I agree with everyhting you said.  I think that the cops/race/sex/etc.
issues are all in some way related to the rave scene.  I mean for the MOST
part raves are for everyone and for all races and sexual bents.  The cops
figure in as a MINOR irritant, which at times acts as the glue to keep us
all cohesive in our attempt to enjoy ourselves and our community.  I know
this sounds drippy, but I DO believe it.

Many people have pointed out how the discussions on the net of late have
been, "pointless", or "have degenerated".  I see it as just the opposite.
Underneath all the love and smarm some people like to push there are
questions.  And if you look at the subject matter that has been discussed of
late, flames not withstanding, there has been a fruitful dialog.  We have
talked about sex, age, race, public policy, sexuality,and humanity over the
course of these discussions.  How BORING it would be to JUST have party
announcments, and record reviews (both of which are important to many),
instead of a total expression of feelings that has occurred over the past
month.

There has been much chaos on the scene.  And this is reflected everyhwere,
from arguments here, to murders at parties, it has at times seemd like
everything was becoming unraveled.  In truth though things have become
better defined.  People are starting to take action (the benefit for Mal is
JUST one instance) in many forms.  Some have stopped going to parties that
are not open to more age groups, some have taken their cause up with lawyers
and the legislative process.  Overall a beautiful and pro-active thing, if
carried out fully.  So bag all of this apologetic shit, because in one way
or another it realtes to us.  If not as fellow party-goers (I have the term
"raver") then surely as human beings.

Peace.

(Oh yeah, it should read I HATE the term "ravers"---oops fingers slower
than the mind :).

CYBERTRIBE RISING

Consider the present situation.  The Industrialized World wakes up to
find itself in a quandary.  Perhaps the technological confrontation
between the two ideologies of Communism and Capitalism, known as the
"Cold War", was mearly a device for global control that was expedient
and advantageous for the regimes which held the rest of the world at
nuclear ransom.  We are told that the "good guys" have won, and that
the world is now safe from the threat of the "evil empire".  We find
ourselves left with only one Superpower, which has taken upon itself
the job of enforcer for a "New World Order".  But what is the nature of
the victory that this New World Order has brought us?  The ozone layer
is still depleted, and continues to become thiner and thiner.  People
are still starving in the world, while food is rotting in warehouses.
A deadly disease is ravaging the continent of Africa and threatens the
very fabric of the industrial populations, and the Last Superpower, our
Superpower, refuses to spend even a fraction of the amount that it
spends on nuclear weaponry, on finding a cure.

We ravers, as a new breed of individuals, have a unique chance to make a
difference in the world we live in.  Most of you, for better or worse,
who are reading this, reside in the United States or some other
industrialized nation.  You probably came across this at a rave or
house party.  Some of you have had profound experiences of togetherness
and and a sense of community while attending events such as this.  What
we need to do as a group is to expand this feeling out into our lives
and into the global community.  As a group, we are incredibly diverse.
We are multi-racial, multi-ethnic and multi-talented.  We are artists
and engineers, dancers and bankers, doctors and lawyers, scientists and
mystics.  In many respects, we are the "result" of the goals of the
60's.  We have learned to interrelate, communicate, and party with each
other across lines of race, gender, class and sexual preference.  We
all have come together under one "House" to share a few moments in
Eternity before we go back to our jobs in the "real world".  Consider
what the "real world" would be like if part of our jobs were to spread
that sense of Unity and Togetherness that we experience within the Rave
"Family", to others that we come in contact with.  We who live in the
industrialized nations have access to incredible technologies, these
technologies, like all forms of power, can be used to harm or to heal.
The choice is left up to you and me to decide, right now, how our
current and emerging energies, wealth and technologies will be used.

Over the last 40 years, the Dominator culture has developed a paradigm,
often referred to in military circles as C^3 I, or Command , Control
Communication and Intelligence.  The doctrine of C^3I has grown up from
the early work of Norbert Wiener who coined the word _cybernetics_
[from the greek kyberne-te-s; to pilot or steer] to refer to the
"comparative study of the automatic control system formed by the
nervous system and brain and by mechanical-electrical communication
systems".  Early cybernetics research was used in WW II to develop
swivel and turret systems for anti-aircraft gun platforms. It laid the
foundation for the advent of the digital computer.  Subsequently, C3I
was developed as a way to manage and control everything from the
outcome of battles to the deployment of disaster forces, to the
missions of the space shuttle.

We have a chance to transform and mutate this technology of control and
domination, into a technology of sharing and cooperation.  What is
needed is a new paradigm based upon the cybernetic model, but with the
additional ideas from Deep Ecology, Distributed Systems Theory and the
"New Physics".  For lack of a better term, I refer to this as C5I2 -
Community, Consensus, Cooperation, Communication, Cybernetics,
Intelligence and Intuition.

The old C3I is a vertical control structure.  Information passes from a
select few at the top, down to the masses at the bottom.  The new C5I2
is a horizontal control structure.  Information passes from small groups
to other small groups through what some call the Web, an interconnected
communications network made up of mail, word-of-mouth, phone-trees,
VCRs, FAX machines, audio cassettes, free software and computer
networks.  Control is not centralized in one person, group or place.
Each person is individualy responsible for their piece of the whole.
If for some reason, they are unable to be responsible, their immediate
group will assist them.  Groups assist and interact with other groups
and communities to form a Web of control and responsibility that is much
more powerful then just having individual "leaders".

When we come together for a ritual such as a Full Moon Rave on a remote
beach, we are creating what author Hakim Bey calls a Temporary
Autonomous Zone.  A rave creates a TAZ of relatively short duration,
only a few hours, but during that time, we are functioning at the level
of _Community_.  In the area that has been appropriated, a separate
code of ethics and behavior can be enacted.  The Authorities are
troubled when it becomes apparent that sections of society don't want
or need their policing activities.  It is not part of their model of
society to have a gathering of several hundred people from diverse
backgrounds and classes without the eruption of violence and
exploitation.  The Authorities are frightened because they are not
needed; which means they no longer are in control.  Think about the
ramifications of this.

The strength of a TAZ formed by rave activity is not measured in how
many people  possess weapons or how well they can out smart or out flank
the police, but in how well the group can function as a
community, reach consensus during a crisis, and cooperate to insure
the safety of each and every member of the group.  When we are raving,
it is important to remember that if we don't want to have the
authorities at our events, then we, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US, HAVE TO
BE THE AUTHORITIES.  This does not mean that we should have "raver
police forces", that's the old, Dominator way of thinking.  What needs
to happen is that we have to be just a little bit more AWARE of what
goes on around us, and learn to take care of people in our immediate
"family" as well as looking out for others outside of our immediate
circle of friends.  If we want to have parties in remote or underground
locations, we need to be able to handle minor emergencies like
administering first-aid, CPR and being able to "talk down" someone.
This is what building Community is all about.

Consensus and Cooperation go hand in hand with Community.  Consensus
means collective opinion or general agreement, it doesn't mean that you
have to have the same beliefs as your group.  What it means is that you
are willing to support the general direction that the Community is
going in or, if you feel strongly about something, that you take
responsibility for getting your point across.  With Communities that
work by consensus, the whole group cannot move forward unless EVERYONE
agrees or at least agrees to allow movement, (i.e. steps out of the
way).  This is not the same as attempting to change an agreed upon
decision once it has been decided, but it can include forming a
contingency plan if you feel that the decision is "doomed to failure".
The former is sabotage, the latter is supportive.  The majority opinion
of the group also has a duty not to " bull-dose" their opinion over the
minority.  Remember, one person who firmly holds their ground should be
enough to stop what ever the majority decision might be.  That is the
essence of consensus. Cooperation insures that individuals or
sub-groups don't abuse their powers of veto or opinion, this is not an
easy thing to achieve in practice and is the major place that
consensual governments break down.

Communication and Cybernetics constitute the areas of opportunity and
challenge for our group.  The creative and dynamic use of these
technologies will make the difference between a "flash in the pan" fad,
or a serious contribution to  global culture that we could make as the
_CyberTribe_.  It is not necessary for each and everyone of us to be a
Hacker or "Computer Geek" but we, as a group, should all strive to
become "computer literate".  Just as you don't need to be an auto
mechanic to drive a car, you don't need to be a programmer to be
skillful at the use of computers.  As the realm of computers and
telecommunications continues to merge, computer literacy will become as
important as standard literacy is today.

The CyberTribe exist today.  All over the world, thousands of ravers
communicate daily via e-mail over an international computer network
called the INTERNET.  They do everything from exchanging information on
the latest _techno_ trax, to planning and organizing raves, to
discussing the Scene, politics, and the ultimate meaning of life.
E-mail has turned out to be an invaluable tool for keeping in touch
with folks in our "family" as well as the worldwide "Family".  It also
is a great aid at building consensus and cooperation. _Virtual sites_,
such as the VRAVE telnet port, function 24 hours a day and provide a
meeting place where  ravers from all over the world can meet, share
ideas and socialize.  When Personal Communicators (pagers that can send
and receive data) come on-line in the near future, the CyberTribe will
be able to communicate with each other at the speed of light.  At no
other time in history has a movement had the facilities of high speed
communication at their disposal; this is significant, but technology
alone is not enough to make a difference.  Each and every one of us
must strive to become more aware, and more loving.  Not because our
parents or some other authority want it, but because it is necessary if
we,  our movement, and our House (planet) are going to survive in the
comming years.

Intelligence and Intuition are the glue that binds these diverse areas
into a functioning, organic whole.  Intelligence as we use it here, is
the accumulation of knowledge.  On a mundane level, it is knowing the
laws, behavior, policies and procedures that the Authorities will
utilize in their dealings with us; for example the techniques the
Milwaukee Police used to bust 950 people at a rave last year and the
legal strategies the ravers used to combat this type of harassment by
the police.  (400 people pleaded not guilty and the charges were
dropped, the Milwaukee raver community is now filing a class action
suit against the City for civil rights violations)  On a higher level,
it is learning about the nature of the environment around you, which
includes everything from paying attention to and caring for your body
(It's your piece on the monopoly board of life) to learning to care for
the Planetary environment.  We are at the vanguard of western culture,
both socially and technologically, and as we gather and use
Intelligence information we must temper it's use with Intuition.

Intuition can be summed  up most simply by the phrase "Do the Right
Thing".  If we look deep into our Hearts, we can always find that place
where we know what the next step is.  It may not be the thing that our
parents or our teachers or our leaders may want or tell us to do but it
is the thing that will always feel "right".  Sometimes it is hard to
tune into this place and find where our Intuition speaks to us.
Sometimes you have to just be still, but it is always there.  When
people as a whole are acting from combined Intelligence and Intuition,
laws become unnecessary because it becomes obvious what does and
doesn't work.

One way to look at all of this is to view C5I2 as the technology behind
Temporary Autonomous Zones, and to see the CyberTribe as a step towards
the realization of Global T.A.Z. networks.  The economic and social
strategies for this type of network are already being practiced on a
basic level.  What  we need more of is, "Family values" but not the
family that the dominator culture speaks of, but the Global Family.
This type of awareness can start with your own individual "rave" family
and spread out from there.  There are simple things that each of us can
do that increase the economic strength of the CyberTribe, like buying
from other people in the "Family" as much as possible, bartering for
goods and services with other Family members and offering discounts.
These activities help to circulate our available monies within the
CyberTribe and gives the Tribe better overall buying power when
purchases  have to be made "outside".  It also makes it more difficult
for opportunists to exploit the trends and creativity that we have as a
group.  As we grow older and the Web becomes stronger and more
extensive, economic prosperity will extend with it.

It's up to us to pick up the pieces of a post Communist/Capitalist,
Us/Them "Dominator Culture" world and transform it into a "Partnership
Culture" world of "Global Unity with respect for Cultural Diversity".
It can be done, but it will take work, mostlikely all of our lifetimes
at the least, but when all is said and done, we will leave to our
children, an intact planet which, will be back on the road to health and
prosperity, rather than a sick, dying, world, flitting from crisis to
crisis, awaiting the apocalypse.  The choice is ours now, as we gather
together in our dance rituals to  build "the feelings of togetherness,
instill courage and break down emotional and mental barriers".

Remember in the months and years to come as this tapestry that we call
the Scene unfolds...

again, in response to john,
i agree that we as women relinquish our power when we look to jenny craig
(who is she, anyway?) however, i think we all have to remember that for many
of us, loving our bodies is a STRUGGLE, is RESISTANCE, against the
dominant/dominator culture that keeps us buying their diet products and their
other consumer goods to overcome what are perceived as, constructed as,
inadequacies.  sure it's great when a woman feels powerful enuf to take her
clothes off in public - i've done it in countless gay pride marches til the
sun started burning my titties.  but i'm getting off-track.. .. just remember
that while the confidence may come from within, it is a result of active
resistance to media messages, and it is a PROCESS. the fact that women may
want to look more like jenny craig than themselves is not a result of
individual neurosis, but is a SOCIAL issue.

Pull My Finger was last night.  You didn't really miss anything.  Left

Subject: Cops, Montreal, H2O...

This week we were talking about cops on sfraves and neraves. I said that we
didn't have any problems with them here. Until now.
Last night (saturday may 1st) was H2O LIFEJUICE in Montreal. A big event,
totally commercial, tickets sold in advance 15$. Got in with some help at 11pm
but if i had done the lineup i would have got in at 2am... At 3 am, the system
is shut down, lights turned on. On the mike: "the cops are here. please leave
the building, thank you.". Everybody sat on the floor (what happens in most
case when there are large crowds faced to the cops here) and waited. At first
i couldn't see any cops, then suddenly i see about 75 cops all geared up with
helmets, sticks etc... People were not leaving. Then the cops start running
in the crowd, then stop. Panic. people running everywhere, afraid of beeing
clubbed. When trying to find my way out, i saw a girl with blood on her head
but i couldn't get to her to see what was happening (turns out she is ok, but
it is not sure if its because of the cops or people running). Again they
start running in the crowd, then stop. Somebody picks up the mike: "yo, give
them a chance to get out, there is only 1 door left open!".

It turns out that the event didn't have a "special event license". Talk about
organisation! Still the cops showed up because clubs are putting a lot of
pressure on the city council to shut down the raves since Solstice. It seems
that the owner of Metropolis and Royal and some other places are really
pissed off. Well, people maybe would go more to these clubs if the crowd and
the music was interesting...

Subject: Extropian/Raver connection. Save Now! -LONG-


** Warning 'Geez it's Long!'

      Ravers and Extropians may have much in common. Save now, read later.
  For me, I'm through ranting and raving. I don't follow the life ext. stuff
  but I think the technology POV is easy to follow. And Authority-Thumpers,
  extrops are angered (active form of 'hurt') by 'Dominator' culture as well.

---edited by ianc@cats.ucsc.edu a bit---

I hope you find information you receive through the list to be useful and
enlightening, or at least amusing and harmless.

----

Please note, again, that communication to the Extropian mailing list
is *private*. It must *not* be forwarded to third parties and each
reader of the list must have an active subscription or be registered
with the list administrator. You are welcome to keep archival copies
of list traffic you receive for personal use.

  1) Formal complaints and administrative requests MUST be sent to:

               Extropians-request@gnu.ai.mit.edu

     To join or discontinue the digest version send a request to:

               exi-daily-request@gnu.ai.mit.edu

     To join or discontinue the real time version send a request to:

               Extropians-request@gnu.ai.mit.edu

 1a) Please allow up to 3 to 5 business days for your requests to
     be processed. Please note most requests are handled with 12 to 32
     hours. The handling of requests on the days just prior to and after
     holidays maybe completely deferred or greatly delayed.

 2a) Mail to the list should be sent to:

        extropians@gnu.ai.mit.edu

 2b) The software that processes traffic on the list alters the mail headers
     so that all correctly working mail readers will automatically address
     replies BACK to the LIST. [reply-to: extropians@gnu.ai.mit.edu]

 2c) If you want to reply to an individual poster you should manually address
     a reply. If the post does not have a signature line, viewing the message
     in a text editor should help you determine the senderUs address.

 2d) It is strongly recommend but not required that all list members use a
     signature file containing their e-mail address.

 3) Due to the volume of list traffic and the cost of disk
    storage, please restrain yourself also from over-quoting
    previous posts -- just a couple of lines to re-cap for those
    who weren't paying attention is usually sufficient.

 4) The list is conceived more as a forum for the exchange of new
    information and techniques, than as a forum for debating the
    basics.  We do have our disagreements -- often quite lively
    ones -- but rarely about really basic issues.  Arguments in
    favor of socialized medicine or dying a natural death at age
    sixty are, judging by past experience, likely to be
    refuted, and finally ignored.

 5) Traffic on this mailing list can run quite high, sometimes more
    than fifty messages per day.  We like to keep the signal-
    to-noise ratio as high as we can, so please restrain the
    impulse to post "me-too" messages or ad hominem flames to the
    list at large.  If you cannot resist engaging in such
    discourse, please do so in private e-mail.

 5b) Posts about the list, or its rules, MUST have the pre-fix "meta"
    Post about should have a prefix indicating their contents
    examples include, PHIL, MATH, SCI, CHAT, etc.

 5c) Several times a year ExI may hold on-line pledge drives,
    these posts will have the "PLEDGE" prefix.

 5d) Polls being submitted to list members will have the "POLL"
    prefix.

 5e) Use your imagination and define your own meaningful prefixes.

 5f)Rules about fighting and insulting; fighting and insulting
    are not allowed are not allowed
 5g) If someone starts a fight with you what should you do ?; we have a
    private legal code set-up to handle such disputes which includes a
    judge (me) and a adjudicator to handle appeals

    any of the following)
        1) Nothing - give no response
        2) Respond OFF the list
        5) Make a formal complaint to me asking for
           a judgment against Person X

 5h) What if you just have to respond to "up hold your honor" or to set
    the "facts/record straight," or to tell the entire list why you
    will not be speaking or reading posts or messages from the person who
    offended you.

    D O N ' T; we consider such responses flames in their own right and
    you would be taking the law into your own hands; you might also be
censured
    or removed from the list.


 Remember
    Don't contribute to or continue a fight once one has started.
    doing so places you in violation of the list rules. That includes
    meta communication, which includes posts with an angry tone, or voice.

 6) However, don't be afraid to ask questions.  This is a forum
    for the interchange of information... speak up!  Many of the
    answers, though, can be found in just a handful of books:

    and in our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list, which will be
    available eventually.

    With regard to "required reading," list member Hal Finney makes
    the following worthwhile points:

"I disagree that familiarity with Eric Drexler's books on
nanotechnology is necessary before beginning discussions on this list.

"Extropianism is a philosophy of life.  Max More, editor of Extropy
the journal of transhuman thought, has identified five Extropian
principles:

        - Boundless Expansion
        - Self Transformation
        - Dynamic Optimism
        - Intelligent Technology
        - Spontaneous Order

You should join the Extropy Institute at $30 per year (Students $25),
$40 (overseas) which includes a subscription to Extropy.

"But I think you can see that the basic point is a belief that the
future will allow virtually unlimited expansion in the possibilities
for our own personal lives.  Extropians reject limits imposed by
outsiders on what we can do and what we can become.  We embrace the
future, with all of its awe-inspiring possibilities.

"The role of Drexler's books, and other books such as David Friedman's
"The Machinery of Freedom", is to show that these aren't just idle
musings and hopes, but are well-grounded expectations about what we
are going to have to work with in the next century.  Without having
read those books, such common-place Extropian ideas as immortality or
a world without governments might seem absurd.

"If you haven't read these books but want to ask questions about these
and other Extropian ideas, the problem is that the answer is usually
going to be, first read the book.  You can't answer a question about
the possibility for immortality in a page or two, not in any kind of
convincing way.

"Now, after you've read some of these books, you still may not agree
that all of these ideas are practical, but at least you can discuss
them on common ground with other list members.  That kind of
discussion is practical, helpful, and informative.  Extropians are not
dogmatists.  If there are practical problems standing in the way of
the realization of their hopes and ideals, we should be discussing
them now, so that solutions can be found.

"Of course, some people will be opposed to Extropian ideas not because
they seem impractical, but because they seem immoral. Re-read the list
of Extropian principles above.  If you don't agree with them, if you
don't agree that we should attempt to break through all the limits
that constrain us today, then you probably won't benefit from
discussion with Extropians.

"The Extropian list is not meant to proselytize, to gain converts.
Most people either find the ideas instinctively attractive, or they
find them abhorrent.  It's a waste of everyone's time to come on the
list and to argue that governments are really good for us and that
death is desirable.  Those are the kinds of messages that lead to
serious flaming, and no one benefits from them.

"To sum up, the Extropians lists welcome members who share an interest
in the exciting, optimistic, future-oriented philosophy of
Extropianism.  If you're new to these ideas, they can offer
suggestions to help you find books, authors, and other resources to
learn more about what we can and will become.  If you're more
experienced, they offer discussion and feedback with a high level of
quality and responsiveness.  The future is coming, and the Extropian
lists offer you a chance to get ready for the fantastic opportunities
that await us all."

There are two other "official" Extropian communication activities.

There is now the ExI Essay list. It is dedicated to the presentation
of essays, monographs, reviews, abstracts and details of current
research, etc. Posts are expected to be scholarly, academic, or at
least well thought-out within the frame work of Extropian principles
(see below) Original research is especially welcome. It is very low
volume. Subscriptions can be made by sending a request to:
exi-essay-request@gnu.ai.mit.edu

There is now a private exi conf. on the Well. If you are a member of
the Well send mail to habs for entry to the conference. This
conference contains all the posts made to the essay list. It is also
used for discussing Extropian topics. It is just getting off the
ground.

    End quote.  Hope you have a pleasant stay.

 ____ Here are the Extropian Principles version 2.01 _____


THE EXTROPIAN PRINCIPLES V. 2.01 August 7 1992

Max More Executive Director, Extropy Institute

1. BOUNDLESS EXPANSION - Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and
personal power, an unlimited life span, and removal of natural, social,
biological, and psychological limits to self-actualization and
self-realization. Overcoming limits on our personal and social
progress and possibilities. Expansion into the universe and infinite
existence.

2. SELF-TRANSFORMATION - A commitment to continual moral,
intellectual, and physical self-improvement, using reason and critical
thinking, personal responsibility, and experimentation. Biological and
neurological augmentation.

3. INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY - Applying science and technology to
transcend "natural" limits imposed by our biological heritage and
environment.

4. SPONTANEOUS ORDER - Promotion of decentralized, voluntaristic
social coordination mechanisms.  Fostering of tolerance, diversity,
long-term planning, individual incentives and personal liberties.

5. DYNAMIC OPTIMISM - Positive expectations to fuel dynamic action.
Promotion of a positive, empowering attitude towards our individual
future and that of all intelligent beings. Rejection both of blind
faith and stagnant pessimism.

These principles are further explicated below. In depth treatments can
be found in various issues of EXTROPY: The Journal of Transhumanist
Thought. (Spontaneous Order in #7, Dynamic Optimism in #8, and
Self-Transformation in the forthcoming #10.)


1. BOUNDLESS EXPANSION
        Beginning as mindless matter, parts of nature developed in a
slow evolutionary advance which produced progressively more powerful
brains. Chemical reactions generated tropistic behavior, which was
superseded by instinctual and Skinnerian stimulus-response behavior,
and then by conscious learning and experimentation. With the advent of
the conceptual consciousness of humankind, the rate of advancement
sharply accelerated as intelligence, technology, and the scientific
method could be applied to our condition. Extropians seek the
continuation and fostering of this process, transcending biological
and psychological limits as we proceed into posthumanity.
        In aspiring to transhumanity, and beyond to posthumanity, we
reject natural and traditional limitations on our possibilities. We
champion the rational use of science and technology to void limits on
life span, intelligence, personal power, freedom, and experience. We
are immortalists because we recognize the absurdity of accepting
"natural" limits to our lives. For many the future will bring an
exodus from Earth - the womb of human and transhuman intelligence -
expanding the frontiers of humanity (and posthumanity) to include
space habitats, other planets and this solar system, neighboring
systems, and beyond. By the end of the 21st Century, more people may
be living off-planet than on Earth
        Resource limits are not immutable. The market price system
encourages conservation, substitution and innovation, preventing any
need for a brake on growth and progress. Expansion into space will
vastly expand the energy and resources for our civilization. Living
extended transhuman lifespans will foster intelligent use of resources
and environment. Extropians affirm a rational, market-mediated
environmentalism aimed at maintaining and enhancing our biospheres
(whether terrestrial or extra-terrestrial). We oppose apocalyptic
environmentalism, which hallucinates catastrophes, issues a stream of
doomsday predictions, and attempts to strangle our continued
evolution.
        No mysteries are sacrosanct, no limits unquestionable; the
unknown must yield to the intelligent mind. We seek to understand and
to master reality up to and beyond any currently foreseen limits.


2. SELF-TRANSFORMATION

        We affirm reason, critical inquiry, intellectual independence,
and intellectual honesty. We reject blind faith and passive,
comfortable thinking that leads to dogmatism, religion, and
conformity. A commitment to positive self-transformation requires us
to critically analyze our current beliefs, behaviors, and strategies.
Extropians therefore choose to place their self-value in continued
development rather than "being right". We prefer analytical thought to
fuzzy but comfortable delusion, empiricism to mysticism, and
independent evaluation to conformity. Extropians affirm a philosophy
of life but distance themselves from religious thinking because of its
blind faith, debasement of human dignity, and systematized
irrationality.
        Perpetual self-improvement - physical, intellectual,
psychological, and ethical - requires us to continually re-examine our
lives. Extropians seek to better themselves, yet without denying their
current worth. The desire to improve should not be confused with the
belief that one is lacking in current value. But valuing oneself in
the present cannot mean self-satisfaction, since an intelligent and
probing mind can always envisage a superior self in the future.
Extropians are committed to expanding wisdom, fine-tuning
understanding of rational behavior, and enhancing physical and
intellectual capacities.
        Extropians are neophiles and experimentalists. We are
neophiles because we track the latest research for more efficient
means of achieving our goals. We are experimentalists because we are
willing to explore and test the novel means of self-transformation
that we uncover. In our quest for advancement to the tranhuman stage,
we rely on our own judgment, seek our own path, and reject both blind
conformity and mindless rebellion. Extropians frequently diverge from
the mainstream because they do not allow themselves to be chained by
dogmas, whether religious, political, or social. Extropians choose
their values and behavior reflexively, standing firm when required
but responding flexibly to novel conditions.
        Personal responsibility and self-determination goes
hand-in-hand with neophilic self-experimentation. Extropians take
responsibility for the consequences of our choices, refusing to blame
others for the risks involved in our free choices. Experimentation and
self-transformation require risks; Extropians wish to be free to
evaluate the risks and potential benefits for ourselves, applying our
own judgment and wisdom, and assuming responsibility for the outcome.
We neither wish others to force standards upon us through legal
regulation, nor do we wish to force others to follow our path.
Personal-responsibility and self-determination are incompatible with
authoritarian centralized control, which stifles the free choices and
spontaneous ordering of autonomous persons.
        External coercion, whether for the purported "good of the
whole" or the paternalistic protection of the individual, is
unacceptable to us. Compulsion breeds ignorance and weakens the
connection between personal choice and personal outcome, thereby
destroying personal responsibility. The proliferation of outrageous
liability lawsuits, governmental safety regulations, and the
rights-destroying drug war result from ignoring these facts of life.
Extropians are rational individualists, living by their own judgment,
making critical, informed, and free choices, and accepting
responsibility for those choices.
        As neophiles, Extropians study advanced, emerging, and future
technologies for their self-transformative potential in enhancing our
abilities and freedom. We support biomedical research with the goal of
understanding and controlling the aging process. We are interested in
any plausible means of conquering death, including interim measures
like biostasis/cryonics, and long-term possibilities such as migration
out of biological bodies into superior vehicles ("uploading").
        We practice and plan for biological and neurological
augmentation through means such as effective cognitive enhancers or
"smart drugs", computers and electronic networks, General Semantics
and other guides to effective thinking, meditation and visualization
techniques, accelerated learning strategies, and applied cognitive
psychology, and soon neural-computer integration. We do not accept the
limits imposed on us by our natural heritage, instead we apply the
evolutionary gift of our rational, empirical intelligence in order to
surpass human limits and enter the transhuman and posthuman stages of
the future.


3. INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY
        Extropians do not denigrate technology, no matter how
radically different from historical norms, as "unnatural". The term
`natural' is largely devoid of meaning. We might say that any
technological means of altering the environment or the human body is
unnatural since it changes the previously existing state of nature.
But we can also say that applying our intelligence through technology
is natural to humans, and so changing both outside nature and our own
biological nature can be regarded as natural.
        Extropians affirm the necessity and desirability of science
and technology. Practical means should be used to promote our goals of
immortality, expanding intelligence, and greater physical abilities,
rather than the wishful thinking, ignorant mysticism, and credulity,
so common to the New Agers.  Science and technology, as disciplined
forms of intelligence, should be fostered, and we should seek to
employ them in eradicating the limits to our Extropian visions.
        We do not share common cultural fears of technology, such as
those embodied in the story of Frankenstein and the myth of the Tower
of Babel. We favor careful and cautious development of powerful
technologies, but refuse to attempt to stifle development on the basis
of fear of the unknown. Extropians therefore oppose the anti-human
"Back to the Pleistocene", anti-civilization rhetoric of the extreme
environmentalists. Going backwards means death for billions and
stagnation and oppression for the rest. Intelligent use of
biotechnology, nanotechnology, space and other technologies, in
conjunction with a market system, can remove resource constraints and
discharge environmental pressures.
        We see technological development not as an end in itself, but
as a means to the achievement and development of our values, ideals
and visions. We seek to employ science and technology to remove limits
to growth, and to radically transform both the internal and external
conditions of existence.
        We see the coming years and decades as being a time of
enormous changes, changes which will vastly expand our opportunities,
our freedom, and our abilities. Genetic engineering, interventive
gerontology (life extension), space migration, smart drugs, more
powerful computers and smarter programming, neural-computer
interfaces, virtual reality, swift electronic communications,
artificial intelligence, neural networks, artificial life,
neuroscience, and nanotechnology will contribute to accelerating
change.


4. SPONTANEOUS ORDER
        Spontaneous orders are self-generating, organic orders and
differ from constructed, centrally directed orders. Both types of
order have their place, but spontaneous orders are vital in our social
interactions. Spontaneous orders have properties that make them
especially conducive to Extropian goals and values and spontaneous
ordering processes can be found at work in many fields. The evolution
of complex biological forms is one example; others include the
adjustment of ecosystems, artificial life demonstrations, memetics
(the study of replicating information patterns), computational markets
(agoric open systems), brain function and neurocomputation,
        The principle of spontaneous order is embodied in the free
market system - a system that does not yet exist in a pure form. The
free market allows complex institutions to develop, encourages
innovation, rewards individual initiative and reinforces personal
responsibility, fosters diversity, and safeguards political freedom.
Market economies ensure the technological and social progress
essential to the Extropian philosophy. We reject the technocratic idea
of central control by self-proclaimed experts. No group of experts can
understand and control the endless complexity of an economy and
society. Expert knowledge is best harnessed and transmitted through
the superbly efficient mediation of the free market's price signals -
signals that embody more information than any person or group could
ever gather.
        Sustained progress and intelligent, rational decision-making
requires the diverse sources of information and differing perspectives
made possible by spontaneous orders. Central direction constrains
exploration, diversity, freedom, and dissenting opinion. Respecting
spontaneous order means supporting voluntaristic, autonomy-maximizing
institutions as opposed to rigidly hierarchical, authoritarian
groupings with their bureaucratic structure, suppression of innovation
and diversity, and smothering of individual incentives. Understanding
spontaneous orders makes us highly suspicious of "authorities" where
these are imposed on us, and skeptical of coercive leaders,
unquestioning obedience, and unexamined traditions.
        Making effective use of a spontaneously ordering social system
requires us to be tolerant and peaceful, allowing others to pursue
their lives as they see fit, just as we expect to be left to follow
our own paths. We can best achieve mutual progress by interacting
cooperatively and benevolently toward all who do not threaten our
lives, and by supporting diversity of opinion and behavior. Respecting
diversity and disagreement requires us to maintain control of our
impulses and to uphold high standards of rational personal behavior.
Extropians are guided in their actions by studying the fields of
strategy, decision theory and game theory. These make clear to us the
benefits of cooperation and encourage the long-term thinking
appropriate to persons seeking an unlimited life span.



5. DYNAMIC OPTIMISM
        We espouse a positive, dynamic, empowering attitude. To
successfully pursue our values and live our lives we must reject
gloom, defeatism, and the common cultural focus on negatives. Problems
- technical, social, psychological, ecological - should be
acknowledged but not allowed to dominate our thinking and our
direction. We respond to gloom and nay-saying by exploration and
promotion of new possibilities. Extropians hold to both short and
long-term optimism: In the short term we can cultivate our lives and
enhance ourselves; in the long term the positive potentials for
intelligent beings are virtually limitless.
        We question limits that others take for granted. We look at
the acceleration in scientific and technical knowledge, ascending
standards of living, and social and moral evolution and project
further advances. More researchers today than in all past history
strive to understand aging, control disease, upgrade computers, and
develop biotechnology and nanotechnology. Technological and social
evolution continue to accelerate, leading, some of us expect, to a
Singularity - a future time when many of the rules of life will so
radically diverge from those familiar to us, and progress will be so
rapid, that we cannot now comprehend that time.  Extropians will
maintain the acceleration of progress and encourage it in beneficial
directions.
        Adopting dynamic optimism means focusing on possibilities and
opportunities, and being alert to solutions and potentialities. And it
means refusing to whine about what cannot be avoided, learning from
mistakes rather than dwelling on them in a victimizing, punishing
manner. Dynamic optimism requires us to take the initiative, to jump
up and plough into our difficulties with an attitude that says we can
achieve our goals, rather than to sit back and immerse ourselves in
defeatist thinking.
        Dynamic optimism is not compatible with passive faith. Faith
in a better future is confidence that an external force, whether God,
State or society, will solve our problems. Faith, or the Polyanna/Dr.
Pangloss variety of optimism, breeds passivity by encouraging the
belief that progress will be effected by others. Faith requires a
determined belief in external forces and so encourages dogmatism and
irrational rigidity of belief and behavior. Dynamic optimism fosters
activity and intelligence, telling us that we are capable of improving
life through our own efforts. Opportunities and possibilities are
everywhere, waiting for us to seize them and create new ones. To
achieve our goals, we must believe in ourselves, work hard, and be
open to revise our strategies.
        Where others see difficulties, we see challenges. Where others
give up, we move forward. Where others say enough is enough, we say:
Forward! Upward! Outward! We espouse personal, social, and
technological evolution into ever higher forms. Extropians see too far
and change too rapidly to feel future shock. Let us advance the wave
of evolutionary progress.


        Extropianism is a Transhumanist philosophy: Like humanism it
values reason and sees no ground for believing in supernatural
external forces controlling our destiny. But transhumanism goes
further in calling us to push beyond the simply human stage of
evolution. As physicist Freeman Dyson said: "Humanity looks to me like
a magnificent beginning but not the final word." Religion has
traditionally provided a sense of meaning and purpose in life, but it
also suppressed intelligence and stifled progress. The Extropian
philosophy provides an inspiring and uplifting meaning and direction
to our individual and social existence, while remaining flexible and
firmly founded in science, reason, and the boundless search for
improvement.

yes!!! some of us can't always afford that $20E, and a $200 rave outfit? - no
way! i mean, if people want to spend that much $ on clothes, whatever, but
i'm there to dance, not show off consumer goods.  

and IMHO, i wish there were more cheaper, smaller events.  sure i appreciate
nice visuals, etc., but i can forgo them for good vibes, great music, and a
lower price.    
when i see a $20 price tag, i feel like raving's become just another pricey,
exclusive, $-sucking event, when before, i had always seen it as an
alternative, a DIY event... guess that's cuz i started raving in brighton,
england, tho, where most of the raves i attended were outdoors and FREE
(donations for the generators)...clearly, this was because djs donated their
time, and i don't expect them all to do that as they also have to make a
living, and perhaps because the brighton police weren't as organized to crack
down on raves as they may be here (nj, sf).  however, i guess i'd always seen
it as a kind of countercultural, even anarchic/autonomous, thing.  (i so
understand that not everyone feels this way - for some it's just a party). 
now it seems in some ways that, along with the hypercommercialism we've had
to deal with, it's becoming another expensive, hedonistic, leisure good.

That's 'cause everyone went to Wicked!  It was packed;  the crowd 
peaceful and friendly;  music to die for;  not much fog used.  In other
words, a great experience until the cops showed up and closed it down
at 5:00 due to the overcrowding...


Apparently, a fire marshall should have been involved, but none around.
Hmmm.  They cuffed someone and took him away.  I think he was the 
promoter; maybe someone has more info.

Afterwards moved on over to AfterLife at DNA around 6am where Gavin, Doc M.,
and Simon did their usuall damage :-)  

All in all a worthwhile evening.  Time to rest...

I agree!  I was being 50% sarcastic, 50% realistic - there ARE lots of 
people who have the excess cash for the above scenario to be true.  I'm
not one (I dress in cheap T-shirts and jeans and stuff, and try to get
my drugs free :), and the enjoyment I get out of an event almost invariably
seems to be the inverse of the price I paid to go.  But there HAVE been
a couple of events where I felt the $20 ticket was justified, and after
seeing recently a bit more about where the money goes, I feel a little
better.

Yeah, it was great to finally see people throwing the parties start talking

raves as such a holistic viewpoint.  People should arrive at this 
conclusion naturally.

Subject: Cyberforum: rants and raves

  I agree with Brian that the overall mood was upbeat and communal --
though not without some separatist undercurrents.  There was also theusual
mix of high tech and low tack in the sideshow booths (my favorite: a dude who
had folks lying on the floor with what looked
like coin purses spaced on top of them as he waved a stained glass star
over their bodies.  "Relax," he'd say. "This is an ancient healing method
channeled to me from the far past."  I guess I'd lie pretty still too, if
someone armed with a sharp piece of glass was chanting over my prostrate
form....).
  The rave forum was full of positive energy except for two themes that
seeped out:
  "It's such a shame that most ravers are white suburbanites."
  "We have to transcend patriarchalism and embrace the feminine side of
our natures." (addressed to the men, of course).
  Anyone want to start a thread about either of these issues?

This issue was not solved! Yes we need to look at it as 9 people but
we also need to look at the fact that rave scene, at the level of organization,
and performance (the DJ's) are dominated by Men.  Might I also add that 
the person who said that we should look at it as 9 people was
a man and I did not feel that all of the women who spoke up felt
that the issue was solved, we just moved on thats all.
Let`s not sweep this one unde the rug guys, (and gals) we'll be making a

be adventurous.  Caught the bus to Berkeley and went to Flower Garden
at the Berkeley Aquatic Park.  At the 'Thunder Bay' pavilion at the
north end of the park, which is that water you see on the right when
driving north on 880 toward the University Ave exit.  

What a cool place!  It has a medium-sized sort of old-style funhouse
main room in a sort of oblongish octagonal shape, and a big side room,
i.e. perfect for chillspace which is what they were using it for.
The DJing when I got  there was good (could have been Harry Who? but
I couldn't see for sure because he was mixing upstairs in the projection
room), interesting light show and various flashers.  The sound system
was undersized and overdriven, which meant that the bass had a really
muddy sound, and it needed to be better balanced, but what the hey.

The main thing was there was almost *nobody* there, maybe two dozen
people tops in a space that could easily fit 300.  In fact, when I
got  to the front  nobody was even taking money so they just waved me in.

I left after about an hour and made my way back to SF.  Showed up at
King St around 4:30 but by 5 it was clear nobody else was going in, 
and then it  got shut down.  Way disappointing -- I'm not completely
tired of King St yet and I miss the energy that generally develops
there.

So I walked up to Big Heart City and did the Groove thang between
about 5:30 and 6:45.  Not very crowded inside, but not bad, the
spinning  was decent and the visuals pretty good.  But it is obviously
a slice of clubland, and when the floor started getting populated with
beer drinkers after the bar reopened I figured it was time to split.

My schedule just isn't  working out these days -- have to go back to
Portland Tuezday night so y'all will just have to howl at the moon
without me . . .

Subject: re: cyberforum - rants & raves

Arthur Chandler wrote that in the cyberforum one of the themes that "seeped
out" was : "we have to transcend patriarchalism and embrace the feminine side
of aour natures."  he asked for opinions, so....

i am VERY uncomfortable with this statement, as it reeks of essentialism. 
IMHO there is NO such thing as a "feminine side" and a "masculine side" to
our "natures" - femininity and masculinity are culturally and socially
constructed categories, not natural at all.  i assume what the speaker meant
was that we need to get beyond a dominator/hierarchical mentality, and
embrace a mor(oops) ESSENTALLY FEMININE about cooperawhat one can say,
however, is that in our culture cooperation is THOUGHT OF as feminine/
competition - masculine --- but there is nothing natural about this.  

i am uncomfortable, also, with something stated on another post (brian's, i
think) about the cyberforum, which said that the issue of 1 woman, 7(?) men
on the panel wasn't a problem, because we need ot get beyond patriarchal and
matriarchal thinking - they're all people.  sure, we're all people - however,
we do live in a sexist culture, which organizes things along gendered lines,
whether we like it or not.  the lack of women on the panel could mean that
women are not as active in the rave scene, or it could mean that women are
active but in different (non-visible-leadership) roles, and thus are being
overlooked.  and if women aren't as active in the rave scene, why not? any
thoughts?
