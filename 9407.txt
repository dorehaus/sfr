In keeping with the recent thread concerning more details on events:
Liquid Drano is free, and everyone is welcome.  It will be out of doors
somewhere in the san francisco bay area.

Why? We do the Liquid Air series of parties because we like to. they are
not elaborate productions, and all of the materials necessary are present
and taken care of.  Donations are never turned away, but neither is money
solicited.  What~is~ solicited is active participation.  We welcome 
everyone to these parties regardless of which category they think they
might fall into or describe themselves as; we do this because we believe
in inclusion.  We don't announce the location until the night of the party
(usually) because we prefer to avoid inflexible authorities, and because 
sometimes we've found great spaces the day of the event (i'm reminded of 
a certain tunnel :) ).

Susie's question about yellow smileys made me think of this...

During the past few months I've been seeing bumper stickers that say
"Arrest a Friend".  Does anyone know what these are supposed to mean?

maybe it has something to do with the growing air of protectionism

Unlurking to offer a possible answer to Michael's "arrest a friend" question. 
Often, the American Heart/Diabetes/Cancer/Horrible Disease Associations will 
have fundraisers where a person is "arrested" from their place of business 
and taken to "jail." The person then has to "post bail" by calling friends 
and asking them to donate money to get him/her out of jail. All of the money 
goes to the Association, and it's supposed to be pretty fun. Sometimes the 
people arrested are celebrities, which adds to the spirit of the fundraiser.

Hope that helps. Hope I'm right! Have a fantastic three-day weekend, 
everyone!!!

take wearing hat one:  sounds like fun!  cute practical joke on the arrestee,  
great source of stories & conversation among all concerned. and all for a good  
cause.  this prison stuff in the news every day is such a downer - let's  
lighten it up a bit!

take wearing hat two:  of all the countries in the world, the U.S. has the  
highest incarceration rate.  a big fraction of people arrested and jailed are  
there for victimless crimes, e.g. casualties of the War on Some Drugs.  is

I'm sorry, but "raves" stopped being "underground" a long time ago.  Hell,
there is even a Usenet newgroup for them, alt.rave :-)  You can find out
about raves by looking in several nationally-distributed magazines (XLR8R,
Urb, Slurp!, Reactor), they've been on TV numerous times (fictionally and
non-fictionally), they've been in the "New York Times" and "Rolling Stone."
I see flyers for upcoming raves in clothing and record stores all over.  In
LA I saw rave flyers in restaraunts in the Melrose area.  I've seen raves 
listed in the Village Voice's weekly entertainment calendar.  Most parties
that might call themselves "rave" in SF are held in clubs anyway, which 
strikes me as being quite aboveground as these clubs have permanent known 
addresses that anyone who has ever heard of them can just show up.

I think the difference between a "rave" and a "concert" is that "rave"
encourages active participation, whereas a "concert" is still much more
in the "watch-the-band-up-there-on-stage" producer(band)/consumer(concert-goer)
paradigm.  This is the thing to focus on to KEEP "rave" different from
"concert." :-)

Anyeay, the big mainstream parties such as Wicked, Basics, Cool World, Sharon,
etc. HAVE to be legal to happen, so what is the point in being so 
faux-secretive about them?  Might as well give the age requirements and if you 
can bring in food and water up front.

The renegades are a *slightly* different story -- of course organziers of 
things like the FMRs, the NMRs, Spiral Jive, etc don't want to give out 
location information in advance because the parties are being done illegally 
according to the strict letter of the law.  But still, the phone lines and
other announcements can still say if there are any age or food/water 
requirements.

All of you who wanted to know what breakbeat was, what hardcore was, how 
to tell the difference, what the heck "rotterdam" and "gabber" are, here 
is your chance!

The best way to learn these things is by hearing lots of examples, so come 
on out to "Liquid Draino" on Sunday night, July 3rd.  As usual for the 
Liquid * parties, it will start by midnight and will go until we decide by 
mutual consent to stop it.  So get there at the beginning 'cause if we have 
to re-locate or get tired you might not find us later.

This will be a free outdoor all ages party.  Bring food, water, blankets, 
toys, ear plugs, friends, pets, whatever you want EXCEPT FIREWORKS (but those 
little hand-held sparklers are cool if you are really careful).

You can get more info by calling (415) - 985 - 5244.  Bryce calls the 
party "Compressed Air" on the tape but it's the same party as "Liquid 
Draino," he changed the name because the second name sounded cooler :-).
Location info will be put on the voice mail the evening of the event, and 
you'll also be able to finger me for directions.

I'm not against $20 parties, as long as I get $20 worth...

The issue here is that promoters intentionally withhold information
that attendees badly need to help plan their night. And while some of
us who have been to a lot of parties can guess some of these things,
we shouldn't have to. Two friends and I drove all the way down to club
FX in San Jose from Sacramento and had to turn right around and head
back because there was no way for us to know the club was 21+. I
frequently drive people around who are under 21.

It's not too much to ask to have a promoter publish a few simple
things like cost, age limits, and water/confiscation policy.  The
bottom line is: if you won't do that, you don't care about your
participants, you only care about the money. Walks like a duck, looks
like a duck, etc. The vibe of such parties usually reflects this, in
my experience. Sometimes one lucks out, but not often. Find a caring
promoter, and you usually find a good party.

For those of you that have heard it before, sorry, but I just can't let his
one go by...

Charging $20 for a rave is no way to keep the scene alive and healthy. It's
a good way to keep *yourself* and *your djs* alive and healthy but, once
again, not so the scene.

Keeping the scene *healthy* would entail engaging people in a shared and
cooperative producer-producer, creator-creator relationship as opposed to a
producer-consumer relationship. There is mounting eveidence to support the
notion that this can be done at a very low cost to everyone involved, say
$3 for instance.

I don't mean to undermine the original efficacy of the rave approach which,
granted, introduced (re-introduced) this very concept, ie dancing
*participants* as opposed to headbanging, drone-like, front-facing concert
attendees !-); but one easily supplants the other...

And, from a budget standpoint, no amount of production values truly
necessitates a $20 price tag. But, just for fun, lets do some of the math
as it relates to the party in question. To be fair we'll estimate high...

Arena:                  $2500   (+no bar guarantee here; *huge* savings)
Security:               $1500
Sound Systems:          $2000
Visuals:                $1000
Laser:                  $1000
DJs:                    $6000
Food/Water:             $0500
Promotion:              $0500
Misc.:                  $1000

Total:                 $16000
Revenues: (2000@$20)   $40000

Profit:                $24000!


However this still misses the most important point which is that virtually
every line item (excluding arena & security) inflates in direct proportion
to the cost of admission!!!!

DJs charge $1000 cos it's a $20 party. They'd charge $500 if it were a $10
party, $300 if it were a $5 party etc. This party could stil be done at a
profit to everyone involved except *you* of course for $10. $5 would still
produce a profit. And, on a break even basis, this party could be done for
$3. 

One might contend that the promoter risks losing his/her shirt at this
point but, then again, imagine the appeal of a $3 Let Freedom Rave. I don't
think it's unreasonable to suggest that attendance could easily double were
the price $3 at which point it would once again be profitable!!! 

Now, as far as this myth of the holy big name dj shamans living in poverty
along the rugged frontiers of the newest music goes: Give Me a Break! I'm
not gonna point fingers but for the last month and a half I've been hearing
the biggest names playing the same old nightclub-oriented regressive house
sets over and over again. If I hear "it's your turn now" one more time I
think I'm gonna puke.

okay I guess I'm ranting now, however I think I made my point....

take it easy, and more importantly, keep it aliv..(gotcha!) no, 
keep it *real*
ethan

PS: I would *love* to be corrected by *someone* supplying the actual
numbers for this party :)

Very similar music for you on the same label (Flask, which is a subsidiary

12" vinyl:  303 Terrorists
12" vinyl:  DTS (303 Terrorists - artist)
(There's another CD coming out in July under Flask, as well.  I've heard a

Also, check out these record labels: Djax-Up Beats, Structure, Important,
Trax, +8 (check out the CD called Probe), Underground Resistance.

Enjoy!

   This brings up the reminder to travel in packs when in the wilderness

berkeley marina for a waycool afternoon/evening MESS party. One of our little

Could be a reference to Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons(? Gibson? Don't
rememeber, and can't find my copy)'s work, _Watchmen_, in which the
first and last image is that of a smily face button which has had a
drop of blood smeared on it in just the right place so as to appear
liek a bullet wound.  Certainly a large percentage of people around in
1988 would have been aware of the fact that it had been used as such
in _Watchmen_ even it wasn't meant as a direct quote.

Along this line of conversation, I've heard that Spun brings home 
$60k/yr, Doc Martin $100k/yr.  And that Doc's getting in trouble for back 
taxes.  These figures seem a little outrageous, but then again so do most 
DJ's fees.  (I usually play for free, taking money only if the party made 
money, my only exception was when I was relying on what I was offered to 
make rent.  And I'm dumb enough to do this at massives! :-))

Peace,

Lets Have A Free Rave    Saturday July 2nd
David . Das . Rucspin . U.S. Thomas . Tracy

Basically this is a spiral jive party
outdoors and free, kind of.

Y'all are familiar with the 24th and illinois space which gets busted
occasionally because many cars and people create a chaotic atmousphere
on the street. Well we got a guy who will let you in the gate and park
at the end of Army , and the party is further down than usuall. But the
guy will ask each person for $2 . He has reduced the bust probability 
by talking to the neighbors and finding out how we should do it to least
offend. He has been watching us for a while and now wants a piece of the 
action. He doesnt want to be paid to dissappear, so we think it is worth it
to let him provide pay parking. If you must sneak around please park wiseley
and don't hang out in the street.

 From Lynn:
     -----Sheesh. Lighten up. It IS for a good cause, plus,the "arrestees" 

     work with the group to let them know when they'll be available to be 

     "arrested". 

     

     As for the bit about New Year's Executions: I don't know where you get 

     ideas like this, but go outside and take a walk, you've obviously been 

     staring at the walls of your cubicle/office for a little too long. 

     It's a beautiful day, so relax and enjoy!

lynn, i'm back from a lunchtime walk through noe valley per your  
recommendation - beautiful day indeed outside!

do you know anybody who has actually been arrested?  or subjected to a  
no-knock bust-down-the-door 5am search?  particularly for something he or she  
doesn't consider to be a crime, like posessing prohibited drugs?   or have you  
known somebody who has lived under fear/paranoia of such arrest?

the people i know who have been in situations like that aren't very "light"  
about it most of the time.

i think mock arrests or mock executions as an adult game (even for charity)  
can be likened to kids playing with toy guns.  in uncritical moments, i would  
doubtless play and laugh at these games (how *nice* that i could schedule my  
arrest for a convenient time).  but a more thoughtful take is that there's  
already enough of this stuff going on for real to need to augment and  
trivialize it with make-believe - even "for a good cause".

then again, if the mock arrests were made as shocking and harsh as the real  
ones, maybe they would be an excellent way to Wake People Up to what's going  
on in our society.  - bob

Wow, and mostly cash too!  I make less than Spun, and my profession
is Computer Software Developer/Tester. 

Maybe I should quit my job and practice all the time until I get as good

Another reason I support the smaller parties: variety. Name DJs are
really good, but I like a lot of variety in whose sets I hear.

If it weren't for small-medium sized parties with good variety, I may
have never heard killer sets from:
        
        Susan
        Tamara
        Dave Synthesis
        Jon Drukman
        Ethan
        Laura
        M
        Tara
        Lee An
        Tomatsu
        DRC
        Kenneth Paul
        Bryce
        Jan Cooley

And who knows how many more I can't remember at this moment but whose
sets made me dance like a fiend :). I think I'd go to bigger parties
more often if they could mix more new talent with the the name DJs.
That would be really cool :).

If you like acid, my new tape is for you! It's called 'Acid Test' and
features music from:

  Robert Armani
  Hardfloor

seeking only to regain my production costs: media, j-card etc...

	Maybe there is a need to clarify the position of today's DJ's. In the 
	Bay area alone there is well up of 60+ DJ's. Ranging from Professional
	to Semi-Professional(No they havn't given up their day job yet or 
	they're a student) to Amateur(no pay, doesn't want to be payed, or 
	would like to be payed).

	I view the DJ as an artist. In so much as a graphic designer, script-
	writer, musician, actor/actress etc is an artist too. If these people
	view themselves as professional then I'm sure they want to get the best
	deal they can. Why sell themselves short? Why let the big corporation,
	employer, promoter makes loads of money off them? Surely they deserve a
	piece of the pie?

	I agree that $20 parties are steep. I wouldn't pay that much for a 
	party and if I did I'd damn well expect to entertained! Equating with
	music concerts, though, people will happily spend $15 - $30 or more to
	go to The Warfield, The Filmore, The Shoreline etc. to see some bands 
	play for a few hours. Is $20 so much to pay to stay up all night?

	Most DJ's operate a sliding scale based on the intended size of the
	party, the cover charge, and their personal feelings about the promoter
	and even to what the party is called or what the flier looks like - I 
	mean who really whats to play at a party called'Dawn of the E Heads'
	I think there are some ethics out there.  :)

	As to Wages. The figures quoted I think are somewhat inflated. I think
	if you half them you might get a more realistic amount. And of course 
	these are gross earnings. You must remember that professional DJ's run
	their own business - they're self- employed. Net earnings are much 
	different if you take into account the spend on vinyl per week. Most
	concientious DJ's buy a lot of records ($5 -$10 a pop).

	Even with all the griping, I think the diversity in the Bay Area is 
	enormous, more so than anywhere in the country. Small, medium, large 
	parties. Free, cheap, expensive. Acid Jazz, Techno, House, Garage etc.

	It's down to you where you want to go. If you want to go see Jeno-Garth
	and it costs $20 you know that in week or twos time you'll catch them 
	for $5, or for free at a FMP. What's the hurry?

	And if you don't like the way it is all I've got to say is this:

		IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE PROPERLY DO IT YOURSELF

When I left New York 6 months ago the musical selections were MUCH more
diverse than anything I've seen out here in San Francisco.

You could go to a party there and hear breaks, hardcore, electro, trance,
acid, progressive house, and old-school deep house ALL ON THE SAME FLOOR
ON THE SAME NIGHT.  Parties were like a tour through the realms of dance
music . . . acid jazz at sunrise . . . hip-hop sets . . . old school
techno from 1990/1991.  Dante would spin trance sets that would include
selections from Skinny Puppy and This Mortal Coil.  DJs from Europe and the 
West Coast visited quite often to give us a taste of their local scenes.  I 
have yet to encounter anything like that in SF.

Where is the hardcore?  Where is the breakbeat?  Where is the trance
that runs faster than about 140 bpm?  What about Laurent Garnier?
Damon Wild?  Miss DJAX?  Adam X?  Or anyone from the outside?

For sure.  And that is exactly why I am doing the small little bit that
I am, because I really want there to be more of a musical variety for 
people to choose from.  

I'm turning over a new leaf.  Enough of this.  Ethan has the "new acid" 
realm covered really well -- his tape that he just described contains some 
of the best of the recent acid/trance genre.  Get his tape, I love his 
taste in music (heee, since it's a lot like my own).  Liquid Air doesn't 
need two DJs who have nearly identical taste in music, though.  I'm putting 
my records where my mouth is and am going to pull out exactly what I miss.  
I may never work in this town again, ("we did that hardcore thing a few years 
ago and are over it") but so be it :-).  Come to Liquid Draino and get ready 
for rave-aerobics. :-)

	Hi. Thomas is out of town on July 9th. So we've decided to have a 
	guest at Wicked :O

	We will be featuring DJ Pierre (NYC).

	I'm sure all you audiophiles and house addicts will recognise him as
	one of original Chicago instigators of the sound we call 'Acid House'

	Working under many guises - Phuture
				    Phortune
				    Pierre's Phantasy Club

	he laid down the roots of acid on the Chicago Trax label.
	He is currrently joint in-house producer with George Morel at Strictly
	Rhythm Records as well as having produced records for Emotive Records
	and a host of remix work. He's also one hell of a DJ.

	Personally he's one of my total heros and is also responsible for the
	first house record I ever bought back in 1987 'Acid Tracks'.
	Other tracks you might know include 'We are Phuture', 'Fantasy Girl'
	and his current release on Strictly, 'Mental Breakdown'.

	
	See you in the land of green and purple on the 9th :)

	Markie  !)

I don't think just becuase we don't see a wide range of music that was
popular years ago makes San Francisco (or LA) inferior to the New
York scene that Laura describes.

Personally, I would not want to hear many of those older styles at
a club.  I look at progressive dance music as a huge inverted 
whirlpool.  At the bottom, you have all the music of the past.  Great
music, yes, but older music.  As you ascend, the music becomes more
current, drawing on styles from the past.  Then, at the very top, at
the vortex, you have the music that is popular now.  I don't think
music at good clubs shifts from being housier or trancier, I think
it is all these things, all the time.  Lets face it, if a new track
comes out  that you can easily catagorize, then it probably is not
a good track.  The progressive dance music scene is so exciting! We
are evolving music at an incredible pace.  What other music scene
can you think of where a new sound is superseded by an even new
sound in less than 6 weeks?  Basically, I just like to hear the latest
evolution of dance tracks when I go out.  Becuase just when I think
that I have heard the best style that ever was or ever will be, I am
always suprised to hear the next thing, which is always better (at 
least for me).

Also, I don't think 20 dollars is completely unreasonable for an event.
If Let Freedom Rave has a nice location, a great sound system, good
DJ's, some lights, and some breakfast, and if it goes off all night,
then that is well worth 20 dollars for me.  No matter how much money
our promoters make, it will always be a fraction of what mainstream
promoters make.  Hey, I just payed nearly 30 dollars for Dead tickets,
and I KNOW I won't have half the fun I will have at LFR. Hey, it's
cheaper than church. And where else are you going to get that much fun
for 20 dollars?

In a reply to my last post Troyz said something about me implying that
NY was a better scene musically than LA.

Actually, from what little I've seen in LA, LA seems to be doing
pretty well.  There are breaks DJs (RAW), house, dub, and ambient
of all flavors, people who play varying hardnesses of trance
(Sondra Collins, Ron D. Core).  The few non West Coast Djs that
have come out this way seem to play in LA much more often than
in SF (but we got lucky with Pete Namlook).

As for breaks and hard trance being tired and old, how would anyone know
when it doesn't get played that much around here anyway and is quite
difficult to find in the stores?  There is stuff coming out that is
new and good and a bit of a change from groovy funky happy major key
house or slow minimalist warped acid under 130 bpm.

There is new music from the UK, all over Europe, and even from Australian 
labels like Juice that I've never heard in SF and I've never even heard 
those styles played here except for when someone like Alex gets a gig.

some human said,

yes, but if a promoter was planning on making a big (say, like in the 4 
digits) net profit, then maybe s/he could share some more of his/her real 
self by lowering the admission cost and thereby making a smaller personal net 
profit yet simultaneously benefitting many party people who live near the bare
minimum when it comes to $$$ ie. hand-to-mouth.  Ahhh, promoting,raving, and 
money, the wonder of it all ;-)

        Wow...no one else has said anything so I had to pipe up.  This was
great.  The people throwing the party were so organized.  There were
visuals, ambient space, refreshments, all of this and more out of doors...I
met a lot of people and kicked it with some really happ-e people... :)  The
one's under the parachute hehe...you know who you are...it was a bit chilly
but dancing kept me warm.  One of the most beautiful places I have ever
been in my life, really breathtaking.  I met robertj308 finally yeah and
had the pleasure of dancing with so many happy people that I'm still
wondering what happened.  So check out Ceremony next time and also check
out Cafe Odeon on Mission in Santa Cruz they got it going on in there,
turntables set up and everything (plus good coffee).

        One point I was really trying to get across earlier today was that
I really believe that if people are going to base the worth of a party
solely on how much it is going to cost, then I think that person is
missing the point of the rave scene, which is supposed to promote inner
peace and peaceful coexistence with your neighbors.  I don't think I said
it in those words, but now I realize that was what I wanted to say. 

        Part of achieving inner peace, I have found, is to dispense with
needless worrying about things you have little control over.  A lot of the
messages that came back to me were along the lines of RI don't mind paying
$20 if I get my $20 worth, and it is on the right track.  I was just
concerned that people were focusing too much on the money aspect of it. 
$20 might be steep, but if you pick the right $20 parties, you'll get your
money's worth. 

        I think everyone gets soaked once or twice when searching for a
rave to go to.  So all I can say to people that are afraid of that
happening is donUt worry about it.  I think if you really ask around,
youUll find that everyone has been to a party where the promoter doesnUt
care.  I have been.  I went to enough parties and found which ones I
thought had people that cared enough, so I continue to support those
people as much as I can. 

        I have to go to bed now, so good night.  :)

Is there nothing to be said for a person or persons using the money

Building a sound system, or starting a clothing company etc, to spread our

seriously impede the growth of the house nation.  We live in a
materialistic society, especially here in america.  To inflict change we
have to integrate within society, but in such a way as not to sell
ourselves out.

Im sorry ethan but you have no idea what you are talking about, last years
Freedom cost $40,000  (forty  thousand ) to put on, that for an intake of
$43,000, a profit of $3,000 between 3 people for 2 months work.  How much
do you make in two months ethan. I am not saying that i have not made any
money from this scene, i have.  By putting on big paid parties i am in
essence asking you to support my beliefs and my actions and the direction i
am taking.  If any, or all of you do not support or believe in me, you do
not have to come.  Mabey i am a foolish dreamer, mabey not.  I believe that
a party is a direct result of the person or persons that are putting it on,
reflect on what you have learned in the last few years, i believe that
there is room for us all.

I've seen it on flyers (not in so much SF though, I guess people are 
more honest here) and here's what happens:  you go before 10.  There is
a long line to let people in.  Why so slow?  "Oh, we have to check
carefully for security you know."  Time ticks by . . . suddenly it's
10, only about 50 people out of maybe 150 have gotten in at the
discount price, and everyone else has to pay in full.  Suprizingly
enough, SUDDENLY the line through security starts moving more
quickly.

But I still think it's a good idea, as long as the owner of the space
and the organizer of the party aren't slimy about it.

This keeps being stated and I'm less and less convinced that this is
really a focal point for the "rave" difference.  Remember that sock-hops
and your lowest-common-denominator pop hip-hop Janet-Jackson-music dance
club all differ from concerts in this way --- but I think a Grateful
Dead concert is closer to what you mean than a pop dance club...

Yes, this is only possible because people are used to paying MORE than
$20 for concerts (note that Pearl Jam is suing Ticketmaster to keep the
prices of concerts to $19.95), which also cost more to produce than raves.

Abandoned warehouse versus Warfield Theater - imagine the cost savings.
And, due to the existing information system for rave attendance, you can
get by on the 25 cents per person promotion budget listed above, whereas
advertising for a 2000 person concert costs a LOT more than $500.

and i all had a great time.  the promoters were very organized, the people
were 'very' friendly, and the site was absolutely beautiful...I love seeing
the sun rise after a night of dancing  =)  oh, and the price was only $5 and
they even had free fruit....so i really suggest that people check out the
next Ceremony.  it is definately worth the drive....

And eye says,
Free and low cost parties have a right to exist as much as the $20 party.
The free parties may seriously impede the growth of Martin's definition of
"house nation" which I'm personally interpreting as, "free parties will
seriously impede my ability to make a big buck".  In my opinion, the "house
nation" will do what the "house nation" will do.

Just cuz one is living and thriving in this materialistic society
called America does not give one any excuse to be anything, much less greedy.
If one wants to be greedy, then go ahead and be greedy and s/he has my 
blessings too.  But charging $20 because one wants to "inflict change by
integrating within society but in such a way as to not sell ourselves out."
Sounds very funny to me!

eg.  Hey Tom & Jane, I see a society of totally decadent people who are doing 
little except for focusing on survival and satisfying their physical senses
ie. USA.  Let's go join em and make lots o dough so we can forget about 
spiritual evolution...... oh yeah, and remember not to sell out!  ..... NOT!

PURE LOVE IS FREE (I'm talking about a state of mind, not a party name)......
Let Freedom Rave is $20?

>Freedom cost $40,000  (forty  thousand ) to put on, that for an intake of
>$43,000, a profit of $3,000 between 3 people for 2 months work.  How much
Tho, I agree, if the truth is $3000 net profit for 3 people for 2 months work,
that's not much indeed, unless....
And I dunno which Freedom you're talking about because in '92 there were about
5000 people there which translates to gross intake of 100 Gs.

Big secret on what promoters do:  One gets an idea for a party, and then one
expends effort & energy to promote it (let others know about it) and set the 
whole event up and organize and pay all the people.  Basically the spark for
a rave begins in one person's head.  Now this spark will PERMEATE the whole
rave.  Ravers will come to the rave and pay an entrance fee, but what they are
really doing is sharing in the costs of the rave and thus, they are actually
paying money so the rave can happen.  The promoter *NEEDS* people to come to
his/her rave so he's not stuck with the entire pre-paid costs, which is the
risk that many promoters assume.  Ravers think, oh there's a party, I think
I'll go, but another way of looking at it is, oh there's a party, I think
I will contribute to it by financially offsetting bhe costs the promoter paid
by my fraction & I will give out tons of energy  by participating in the party.
There is a balance here.  In my view, an imbalance occurs when the ravers don't
want to offset the promoter's costs by their little fraction OR when the
promoter starts treating the entrance fee, not like a donation to defray costs,
but as a way of making big $$$.  Anyway, there is no right or wrong here,
just like in real life.  Because the BIG RAVE promoter's way of looking at it
is, what if few people comes to my rave and I lose $10K in prepaid costs in one
night?......Next time I throw a rave I've got to make some extra $$$ so I can
have some safety net in case next next time, I end up losing.  The 
hand-to=mouth raver's way of looking at it is, I can't go because it costs too
much unless I learn how to schmooz with the door people (ie. selling oneself
out?)  So I didn't go....but if I had  50Gs lying around or even an extra $100
bill lying around, I definitely would have gone.
Martin I love you & thank you for throwing Freedom so I could think about 
whether to go or not.  I spent about 2-3 hours just trying to make up my mind,
which was a rave in itself!  I hope Freedom went well for all parties involved,
and I hope it was about Freedom.

That's nothing but a personal attack on Martin.  If you can't hold a
conversation about this without casting people who hold opposing views
as money-grubbing big-time P.T.Barnum-esque Bill Graham wannabe's,
stop now.

If promoters who charge $20 only make a couple thousand from a party
after spending three months working on it, it's not called being greedy,
it's called paying rent.  More often than not, large parties lose money.
The only parties that I've ever heard as being large cash cows were
Cyberfest, ToonTown (after they left King St.) and a couple of the
New Years' parties.  

What I interpret Martin as saying is that, yeah, small parties are great, 
but if you really do want to make a change in this world, and you think 
throwing parties like ours is a way to inflict that change (which I don't
disagree with at all), then large parties are a very good thing, if not
necessary. 

And if you don't think that large-party promoters care about their
patrons, you haven't met Martin.

> PURE LOVE IS FREE (I'm talking about a state of mind, not a party name)......
> Let Freedom Rave is $20?

Yes, because you can't rent out a large track for $3 per person, you can't
get enough security and sound for $3 per person, etc.  Some elements of
your costs are a function of the admission price, but many are not.

I was there too, and I wouldn't say there were 5000 people there.  If you ask
me who's in a better position to judge attendance, you or Martin, you can
guess who I'm picking.  Finally, I'm sure a substantial portion of the
people there were either working or on the guest list, and guest list
bloat might be a problem.

In the rest of your letter you talk about how throwing parties should
be a collaborative process, and if promoters view themselves as showmen
or in the entertainment industry that's a bad thing, and I agree there.

Subject: ongoing rave-finances comments, FREEDOM REPORT.
Date: Sun, 03 Jul 94 16:04:42 -0700
X-Mts: smtp
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


Attached at the bottom is the last message I've received in the long chain
   of rave-finance email, esp. re:freedom.  My addition is to comment about
   this in light of a review of freedom.  Please don't flame me- I may have
   a jaded view or "missed something" but I'm not trying to offend.

Freedom:

   vibe: ecccch.  okay, seen better, but definitely there to be had.  Don't
   mean to detract from those who had thebesttimeoftheirlives, but it
   seemed like the point ("freedom", etc.) was kind of lost amid the
   tanning-shop made-up teenie boppers from the valley and their musclemen
   d00d gangstastylin guys.  I was wacthing the security folks pull
   junkbeer from cars.  Fortunately, people seemed to get along and more or
   less chill, so no complaints, but let's not compare this to sfrave's
   resort, the fmr's of a year ago (pre-r.s.)  or liquid air events.

   HOWEVER, much as I hate to say it, I can't complain about the $20 worth,
   the security folk were plentiful and reasonable, and didn't give me a
   hard time (ie. they did their jobs... professionally -- gasp!), the
   visuals were as interesting as stacks of alternating slide projectors
   get (but, to their credit, they did make sure to switch the slides a lot),
   the sound was quite rich, no problem trancing. the ambient tent was
   pretty good (although the music wasn't... spacey... enough for me) - it
   needed some more ventilation... too many _cigarette_ smokers (not enough...)
   but there was plenty of room, and the carpet was a nice touch.  Overall,
   the site was okay, although it didn't leave a lot of room to explore
   (security folk watching the hills... par for the course in bigger events)

So where did your $20 go and was it justified?

   overwhelmingly, yes.  Consider the bounty of helpers: security, ticket
   people, people to manage parking (which was amazingly well organized,
   even when the bubble appeared around midnight and they were reorganizing
   things on the fly to avoid a street spillover), lighting folks, etc.
   I won't go into the financial details- that's already been covered in
   previous email.  The point is that somebody went to a lot of effort to
   coordinate things, right up to the last minute, and for that- $20 is
   justified.

Now, you ask, I've had just as much fun paying $15, $10, $5, and $0.  What
   gives?  What gives is that you're paying a premium to rave suburban
   style- my _mother_ would probably sanction such an event, it was that
   well organized.  Granted, what's the likelihood that some crazy is going
   to try to set the place on fire etc. - but think about the gangs etc.
   At a big, well-publicized event like Freedom, you're partying with the
   highschoolers from around the area, and if you don't need that kind of
   cushion like they (their parents...) do, then don't go- save the $20.
   The Liquid Air folks pump in toons just as well as the Freedom folks do,
   and with the help of friends/family, we have the food, and the vibe and
   the blankets - and it's all donations or free.  There's no (real)
   precautions against a bust, there's no security folks to break up the
   fight that sucks you in when that wacked out, angel dusted jerk mistakes
   the gangsta for a punching bag ('course, there's no reason why that
   would happen, but if you don't tell the wackos or the gangstas about
   sfr events, they won't come, and it will all be a self-fulfilling
   prophesy, exclusion not being necessary since such folks seem to like to
   be among their own, and sfr definitely doesn't have the "proper" :-)
   density of the "in" crowd etc. etc.)

Btw, I had a pretty good time last night.  As usual, compliments to the
   folks who provided the info.  one thing: it's always cool to meet people
   on their first x-adventure, and hear them lose their cliquish,
   clothing-makes-the-person, i'm-in-you're-out attitudes, replaced with
   the girl who was laughing her ass off, rubbing my poncho and saying
   "people are GOOD... they really are."  To her, my best wishes - please
   hold onto that feeling by daylight.  Maybe then...

thoughts... peace... _harmony_

That's nothing but a personal attack on Martin.  If you can't hold a
conversation about this without casting people who hold opposing views
as money-grubbing big-time P.T.Barnum-esque Bill Graham wannabe's,
stop now.

If promoters who charge $20 only make a couple thousand from a party
after spending three months working on it, it's not called being greedy,
it's called paying rent.  More often than not, large parties lose money.
The only parties that I've ever heard as being large cash cows were
Cyberfest, ToonTown (after they left King St.) and a couple of the
New Years' parties.  

What I interpret Martin as saying is that, yeah, small parties are great, 
but if you really do want to make a change in this world, and you think 
throwing parties like ours is a way to inflict that change (which I don't
disagree with at all), then large parties are a very good thing, if not
necessary. 

And if you don't think that large-party promoters care about their
patrons, you haven't met Martin.

> PURE LOVE IS FREE (I'm talking about a state of mind, not a party name)......
> Let Freedom Rave is $20?

Yes, because you can't rent out a large track for $3 per person, you can't
get enough security and sound for $3 per person, etc.  Some elements of
your costs are a function of the admission price, but many are not.

I can't over-emphasize how psyched i am for this party, and i hope you all
are too!

Anyway, I might be in need of a ride from Berkeley, depending on where the
party is.  If anyone can help me out, drop me a line!  I'll let you blow my
train whistle.

thanks loads,

My car is having flaky times tonight so I'd rather not risk it driving
to liquid draino.

Once I get it fixed I'd of course be more than happy to give rides to
folks to future events!

Free parties. Cheap parties. Social meetings. Donations to charity.
Helping beginners get started. Free fruit. Etc etc.

Document, document. If you hate it when people saying you're getting
rich off expensive parties, keep good records and show them what
you're really doing.

When we went to Apocalypse, we got there before 11 (?) when the price
was going to go up. There was some problem delaying the party, and by
the time 11 rolled around there were 200 people waiting. They all got
in for the pre-11pm price.

Now that is caring promotion. :)

 A short post about Liquid Draino:

 I got to the back-up location somewhat after midnight . Interesting mix
of more caustic music styles - the gabber was too hard for me , I decided
to stay holed up in my truck ater my nap instead of trying to come out
and dance to it! Otherwise , the music was perfect for a cold San Francisco
summer night.

 I'm going to bed ...

Liquid Air went caustic (sort of) and did it up in an oft favored spot
on the SF waterfront on Sunday night.  We heard (and *danced*) for a good
four hours to tunes spun by Laura, Ernie Deakyne, and myself, with everything
from housey things to trancey things to acidy things to old techno anthems
to gabber and jungle madness. oh, yes...and breakbeat, too.  the smile
factor was very high, and we had quite a few visitors throughout the
night, and i met some new friends and some old friends.  one thing that
was way fun was when laura started off: there were less than 10 of us
when she started; suddenly, she looked up, and asked "where did all these
people come from?" cause there must have been 30 or more of us by then,
who seemed to appear quickly, and from nowhere.

although i helped organize this party (what little organization was required),
i still *love* these parties in general, and this last one was just great.
i was fully prepared to set up the sound system and play for a few of my
closest friends.  it was just amazingly wonderful to see so many people come
out for this little gathering.  it was also very nice when the party took
on a more intimate feeling after laura, myself and ernie has spun the first
round, and then each spun a shorter, second set of 4 or 5 tunes apiece.
people were still grooving out.  

i was also really happy to see that people were *not* put off by our
labelling this as a "hardcore" party.  i guess i take this as proof that
SF *can* handle hardcore, at least in small doses.

Yowza!!  i got back from the last Grateful Dead show at Shoreline
(they're heading east for the remainder of the month) and found that
Susie had not only arranged to get me a ride with our friend Ann but
was also cooking up chocolate goodies and ice cream to send us on
our way!  (She was working the big 4th of July event down at the
waterfront today so didn't come down, wish you'd made it suze . . .)

We arrived a little before 1 and there was already a good crowd and
Laura was spinning up a storm.  Bryce kept us amused with oddities
and disasters from the Techno Closets of History.  Yes, it's true, the
sfravers actually *danced* to James Brown Is Dead, although Bryce
confessed to me later that around two-thirds of the way through he
remembered why we all got sick of that track!

I really liked Deaks' set too, lots of hard trance.  I must have missed
out on all the hardcore/gabber because not much was played (for the most
part, a good choice, although there are good tracks in those genres 
I find most of it aggro-paint-by-numbers clanging).  Bryce even came
back with the good mix of 'Dominator' and Deak did this great remix or
overlay of 'Planet Claire' that was both funny and sublime.  The wind
and chill were a bit much to take but everyone managed pretty well.

Thanks to everyone and see you in the future!

To add to Bryce's comments:

>four hours to tunes spun by Laura, Ernie Deakyne, and myself, with everything
>from housey things to trancey things to acidy things to old techno anthems

An interesting story of how I met Ernie -- DJ Deaks.  I hang out on vrave a 
lot, and he was there one day telling us about how he'd just spent a good 
amount of time in the UK, and had bought all these great records.  When Bryce 
found out that Lee An was going to be out of town, I recalled the conversation 
with Ernie and sent him some email.  He came up from Monterey, had killer 
sets, and HUGE smiles.  He also danced like a madman!  I didn't realize he 
was also on sfraves until last night :-)  Thanks for coming, Ernie!

The funny thing about the old hard techno anthems that Bryce was spinning was 
how into them everyone seemed.  It was like going back to 1991, when many of 
us first heard techno or started raving.  The funniest thing was that Cindy 
Kawakami knew EVERY track within about 2 bars of Bryce putting it down.  A big 
hug goes out to Cindy, Kia, and Sharona for dropping by -- they were at 
another party in San Jose, left it and came up to Liquid Draino, and then went 
BACK to San Jose.  They are the true hardcore women. :-)

>was way fun was when laura started off: there were less than 10 of us
>when she started; suddenly, she looked up, and asked "where did all these
>people come from?" cause there must have been 30 or more of us by then,

It was bizzare!  All day Brian had been saying "are you sure you want to 
do this, not many people will come" but we went out to set up with Bryce 
anyway.  Around midnight a few cars arrived, and John Martinko, Tamara, 
Brian S, Ethan, Maui, Sean, Greg, and a few others helped Bryce to get set 
up (it's amazing how quickly Bryce's sound system goes up, too!!!!).  So I 
started spinning, and didn't look up for about 3 or 4 records . . . and when 
I did look up I was shocked!

Another funny thing was that during my set, I noticed that everyone was 
focused on something although they were still dancing.  Unknown to me (my 
back was to it), there were two fires going on in Portrero Hill.  I guess 
they were started by fireworks up there or something.  They got put out 
pretty quickly, though.  It was just odd to feel that something was going 
on, and to have no idea what it was.

Anyway, big thanks to everyone who came, I'd guess there were about 50 or 
so.  I wish it hadn't been so cold -- but Bryce has some new location ideas 
that are a bit further south, so hopefully next time we won't all be freezing 
by 4:00 am.  As Bryce said, "it's time to find a new 'weak' spot." :-)

I met a new friend at Let Freedom Rave yesterday, and he asked me to post 
some infotainment on the net about a party tonight...somewhere in the 
Santa Cruz area.  

The flyer given to me says:

	   JULY 4TH

James	Ruben	Eric	Mei-Lwun
	& Special Guest

$2	(408) 684-3434	      $2

And for those of you wondering, this is actually what the flyer looks 
like, too.  Except the "July 4th" part is in bIG letters!

I called the number and it said there will be a mappoint somewhere near 
Mission St. in Santa Cruz.  And the party won't start till sometime 
around 11pm, so keep your eyes open and your fingers crossed.  :)

CELEBRATE THE WAY YOU LIVE

That was a cool party :). Sorry for crashing after Laura and Bryce
spun, but after a long grueling day that was all I had in me. Great
sets!!!!!!!!!! Let's do it again :).

I thought I should comment that, if Bill Graham were alive today, given
his feelings for PLUR-related activities (such as G. Dead concerts), he
would probably have bought a SOM warehouse as a full time Rave venue,
with nicer security apes than most clubs, free water and a special place
for flyers, venders, etc.  (Plus his downtown influence would probably
have resulted in less busts within the venue, etc.)

This is my direct experience of attending concerts that he produced,
and, during the same period, ones that he did not (usually in LA).  And
seeing some interviews with him.

respect,

I thought I'd come out of lurking mode to say that I had a great time at 
Liquid Drano last night!  Thanks lots to Laura and Bryce who spun some 
great sets (especially Bryce's ultracheesy stuff!  I LOVED it!) and to 
all the new people I met there...  I wish we could have stayed until the end
to hear Ernie spin too!

At my largest count, there were at least 50 people there.. I was surprised
at the turnout, especially since the first site didn't pan out.  I'd never
been to this one either, and even though it was cold it was still a great
spot, and very intimate!  

Thanks to Larry for the cinnamon candies and to everyone for the hugs and
smiles..  I met a lot of new people and made sure to give them blue,
purple, red, and/or green blo-pop tongues, too! It was definitely worth 
the trip from santa cruz to san jose to san francisco and back again.. :)  
I can't wait for the next event!

Now if only I could get Cindy's "meow mix theme sung to the tune of James
Brown is Dead" out of my head I could go to sleep...

>>> Greetings! I know there a probably a ton of people who want to spin at 
your party on Monday, but I'd just like to add my name to the list :)  I 
just got back from Europe with tons of music and I am dieing to play it 
for people.  I've been spinning for a little over 2 years now (mostly on 
my radio mix show) and will be moving to the city in August.  Anyways, 
it's a bit late to send a tape, but if I find you on Monday, I'll give 
you one (and anyone else who wants one!)<<<

We've got a full line-up for Monday and we would have to hear your tape 
first anyways. If you make it out on Monday find me (I'll probably be
wearing black cut offs and Adidas) and give me your tape. If I don't
see you there e-mail me back and maybe we could hook up somewhere and 
I can get it. We've got tons of other parties planned for this summer
and we allways like to have 1 or 2 guest DJs spin records.

Hope to see ya on Monday!

I could sum up Freedom by saying that the total experience was far 
greater than the sum of its parts due to the fact that the vibe from 
the crowd was absolutely beautiful. 

We arrived at around 2:30 to a thorough but good natured search for
any fireworks and alcohol.  When we arrived at the site we found the
party to have criticle mass but not overly packed.  Tony played first 
and he was great.  I'm so pleased that he is back from where ever
he went to because he has always been a favorite of mine.  After Tony
i would say the music was good not great, but it didn't matter.  Almost 
everyone was dancing and happy, sharing the experience and talking with
one another.  I realize that the joining hands and making a circle is a
Martin trademark, but on Saturday everyone joined; even those sitting at
the time, and made acircle the circumference of the whole track, broke
hands and ran screaming to the dance area to Josh who played a really
good finishing set.  Where else but at a party can a group of people do 
something so completely goofy but with such honesty and good intentions
that it becomes something almost spiritual?

The party ended around 8:00, but the Ambient tent stayed open longer
with a Tofu scramble and loads of fresh fruit.  

Just as an aside I don't know why people are so down on Martin and/or
$20 parties.  We all have jobs to make a living and so do promoters.
Its really what you personally bring to a party that matters not
the fact that someone is trying to pay their rent from it.  There is
room in this scene for the $20.00 party just as much as the $3.00 
party -- they all have their place.

Freedom definately exceeded my expectations.  We arrived after 2 and
established camp.  Amongst SFRavers that we either hung out with or saw
were P-ter & M Normal, Gil, Grey, Ethan, Bryce, Giamma, and Martin (who 
now after posting here is as much of an SFRaver as any of us).

At parties like this, I usually lay back for a couple of hours and wait for 
the drunks and gawkers to get tired and leave, but my first foray into the 
dance area was a pleasant surprise.  Everyone seemed happy and very much 
into the groove.  The sound was system was absolutely superb.  There were 
some nice projections against a couple of trucks on both sides of the DJ 
booth, supplemented by a bank of strobes.  They never got the lasers 
working, but there were enough visuals to make me happy.  The weather was 
perfect, little wind, clear sky, no dust.  After Tony's set, the quality
of the music waned a bit (for me), although Josh was pretty good as the 
finisher.  

As time wore on, the vibe continued to improve, especially as it got light 
out, with people smiling, introducing themselves to each other, sharing 
stuff and just being friendly.  Lot's of people climbed the hill to watch 
the sun come up.  Nothing beats outdoor parties.

The only (minor) downer was the appearence of a white stretch Limo on the
party grounds; this symbol of status and elitism was sorely out of place
here, but thankfully it didn't stuck around to long.

The finale alone was worth my $20 "donation".  It was during the last song 
when the circle started forming, growing and expanding until *all* 3 or 4 
hundred people who were left had joined hands with our backs were against 
the racetrack perimiter.  There was a moment of what-do-we-do-now 
hesitation, and then we ran back to the center screaming and jumping for
joy like a bunch of crazed idiots.  Then Josh gave us an encore for the 
final dance under the morning sun.  

A bunch of us hiked up the hill where we poked around at some petrified 
wood and fossilized seashells, wondering what kind of rave-related fossils 
archeologists might discover here 100 million years from now.  

All in all, I, and everyone I have spoken to so far, thought Freedom was 
a great party.  Thanx Martin.

sidenote: this was the only party I can remember where there were more
barechested women than men.  This probably says *something* about the 
freedom vibe that was in the air.  ;-)

*   *   *

The Sunset party started a little later than usual on Sunday at about 
3:30pm.  The Presidio location, amongst some bunkers protected us against 
the wind, but also gave us the option of a spectacular view of the ocean & 
GG Bridge for those who danced on the bunker's roof.  We helped Galen set 
up and a DJ named Monte started us off with some nice energetic house 
tunes.  There were about 30 - 40 of us dancing as the fog gave way to warm 
sunlight.  The Normals, Gil, Ann(thrax), Gregg, Robert, and Mark (ameba) 
were also there.  

Shortly after the music started, a ranger-type dweeb wandered near.  I saw
his jaw drop, before he vanished in a hurry.  We were soon surrounded by 
a variety of uniformed authorities in squad cars and on scooters.  
Negotiations ensued, and the party was allowed to go on until 7 at a 
temporarily decreased volume.  This was enough time for Phil Smart to 
deliver a killer set.  Although I was somewhat exhausted, it was impossible to not dance to the high energy trance/house he spun for us.

*  *  *

Monday nite, we were still too drained to drag our asses 6 blocks to the
Marina's fireworks display, but we managed to take in a pretty good show 
from the roof of our building.  Nationalism, like racism and organized 
religion is a force that mostly serves to divide humanity into warring 
factions.  But fireworks are cool so we focused on the general celebratory 
spirit of it and felt happy with the freedoms and choices that we *do* 
have, realizing that even in this seemingly imperfect world, it was still 
great to be alive.

I know a lot of people enjoy $20 parties, but have a problem with $20
parties that:

Have rude or intrusive security.
Sell water at obscene prices.
Don't deliver $20 of party.
Get busted.
Appear to be $10 parties before you get there.
Have poor ventilation.
Won't let you bring food in.
Make overt attempts to kill other parties the same night.

I don't think the complaint is the price tag. I know lots of really
good vibe rave participants who don't go to $20 parties because they
can't afford it, and I hardly ever hear them complain. I've totally
ranted about $20 parties before. There are good ones out there.

My own complaint is that a lot of $20 parties fail the points above.
Those points aren't luxuries; they're basically treating human beings
like human beings.

How many parties have we been to with poor or no ventilation and no
fans? Do they allow smoking where the ventilation is bad? How much
work does it take to set up a couple of fans to blow air from cool
areas to warm? How much do the fans cost if you amortize the cost over
10 parties? Hint: I just bought two totally kick ass fans (with 5 year
warrantiess) for $38 each at Price Costco; look for them at parties I
attend. And yet I've gone to $15 and $20 parties that grossed in the
$10,000s with almost no ventilation and no fans.

I could go on and on. I think the thing is: we're tired of expensive
parties where the promoters are negligent or abuse the participants.
People are throwing their own parties because they're tired of paying
$20 only to get slapped in the face.

And at the same time, a lot of these bigtime promoters are promoting
love, community, peace, etc. etc.  If you talk the talk, then you
should walk the walk and treat your participants like you care. Don't
tell me your party is about brotherhood and then charge dehydrated
participants $2 for 12 ounces of water.

I don't have a job. 
Same goes for lots of my friends.
I know very few "employed" people.
I know almost no one who will pay $20 for a party.
I am not down on anyone.

What people *bring* to twenty dollar parties is usually twenty
dollars and not much else - in my mind.

Greetings Friends!

I think an apology, of sorts, is in order. I have a habit of getting
carried away which, at times, is a good thing and yet, at others, not such
a good thing...I think I got a bit carried away in my recent analysis of
$20 parties and Freedom in particular.

Which is not to say, however, that I'm backing off from those points; they
are still entirely valid in a variety of contexts, however, I regret the
degree to which I allowed them to focus so intently on Freedom, especially
in light of Martin's recent disclosure of the financial breakdown for last
year's LFR. 

While I have to admit to no small amount of shock and just a hair of
disbelief that that party could have cost $40,000, I would have to agree
with Martin that, if you're trying to make your living throwing parties,
$3000 is not much compensation for three people over two months, in which
case, you all deserve our thanks for working so hard for so little. That
was, indeed, a fine party. :)

However Martin is not the only one throwing $20 parties. We have some very
recent and, unfortunately, horrifying examples of big name parties that,
IMO, really abused us, leaving me, in particular, a little trigger happy in
regards to the $20 party. I have no problem with us as a scene enabling
promoters and djs to make their living at it. But, make no mistake, this
implies a relationship and a *responsibility* on their part to deliver the
goods. And for $20 the goods better be good goods. 

Comparisons to BGP style mainstream concerts don't prove the point either.
If all we're measuring ourselves against is something that is obviously and
grossly inflated then our standards are far too low. Why shouldn't this
*movement*, if we're going to try and call it that, challenge, rather than
perpetuate, the hyperinflated material consumerism that is the hallmark of
american 'culture' if not western so-called civilization?

                                  * * *

One aspect of my initial post was that it was intended as a polemic; I knew
my estimates were low (despite calling them high); I was hoping to provoke
a response, which we got, on a number of fronts. And this, if you ask me,
is great news, long time coming too. The point being, that, as people in
community, the more we know about each other the better. Nothing makes me
happier than having someone tell me what their vision is and just how much
work they've put into it; it gives me a reason to support them. And, what
better place to do this than here on sfr?! If all we're using this net for
is just another place to hang a flier, we are indeed missing the point. So
I'm tickled pink to find myself in the midst of a real live discussion of
all the above and all of the below...

What has value? Who's worth supporting? Why? Where should this (house etc.)
go? Why? Who's getting the money? What's being done with it? Why? IMO,
these are essential questions if we have a future *together* as promoters,
as djs, as ravers....especially if we're gonna call this a *movement*. I
have yet to see a movement comprised of 2% producers and 98% consumers even
if the consumers are consuming a good product, well worth $20...

How about next year we do a net-organized, massively promoted (wired!),
free and fully permitted, national (worldwide!), march and Let Freedom Rave
on Washington DC! See just how much of a movement we've got...

Martin, you're the only person I know that could pull it off. You've got my
help if you want it :)

lots of love
ethan

If your makin money many Americans, regardless of their beliefs, won't say
too much about what your'e doing to make it.  Even the the anti-drug folks
acknowledge that the dealers are  businessmen trying to make some cash.  Its
just the wrong drugs and the wrong people making the cash.  Profit is a
sheild.  It works for mega-corporations, TV evangelists,  just about anyone.
 California's #1 cash crop contributes mightly to our economy and that
doesn't go unnoticed.  During the CAMP years, production has quadrupled
according to some estimates.  Not exactly effective enforcement, but enough
to please the voters that want it - enforcement that is :-)  The powers that
be will squish you harder and faster for implementing that
let's-get-rid-of-money ideal than perhaps any other.  It scares 'em silly.
Its a classic dichotomy - change from within or revolt from outside.  I'm a
fan of the change from within using irresitible memes -- like a house virus.
 The music alone has this power because of its ability to unite across
cultures and sub-cultures wordlessly.  Many companies in the Bay Area,
particularly high tech/ creative ones,  do an amazing job of being
successful, making money, but still remaing true to what they were about in
the 60's. Our scene has definately benefited from this enviroment, as will
the future.

We're all sick of promoters that don't deliver.  That is why I mostly 
attend Wicked and Basics/Gathering/Vision parties.  I've always had the 
positive environment presented to me.  I feel I've always gotten my 
money's worth.  What about your experiences?

Actually, I agree, though others have had negative experiences with him
due to his very serious business sense.  In fact, he might have said 
"forget it" after seeing how much money large parties tend to lose. :)

I have found that, in general, Basics, Gathering, and Community are
good bets and worth $20 when they are $20. Wicked is always a banging
party, but I express reservations about the vibe--the four I've been
to had some extremely happy people and some extremely rude people.
Bring friends to Wicked.

One Gathering I didn't go to because security and the door people were
pretty rude.  A Basics at the armory had doorpeople that treated me
well, but others told me they got extremely rude treatment.

A lot of spaces come with special liabilities:

I'd stay completely away from anything at Caesars or the Haze.
Security at these places is very rude and intrusive. If you like
flashlights in your face and having your bathroom stall kicked in
because they think you are doing drugs, by all means, patronize these
spaces.

Likewise, stay away from the King St. garage. It is too poorly
ventilated, the goons are too rude, there are no ins&outs to breathe,
and on top of the bad ventilation, promoters allow smoking in there.

Go to events at DV8 and the Trocadero. I haven't been to these spaces
myself (or if I did, it was before I learned their names), but people
keep ranting about them.

As far as bad parties go, I've been to too many of them, and have
tried (successfully) to just forget about specifics. 

DO attend smaller parties like: Spundae, F&F, Liquid Air, YSH, SPAZ,
New Moon Rave, etc. If you've ever wondered where the vibe is or why
the scene "is dead" you need only go to one of these for a massive
positive energy recharge.

Hmmm. I don't know; the best recent example of a promoter not delivering
that I can think of is Wicked. The last Wicked I went to (5-6 weeks back at
19th and Alabama) was without doubt the worst value on the dollar I've
seen. The door price rose throughout the night from $13 to $15 while I was
there, and people I know report that it didn't stop til it hit $20. I've
already thrashed this party once so I won't go into all the gory details
but they're in the archives if you're curious... 

However, just what a poor value this party was, was further driven home by
a party in the same space a week later which doubled the number of big name
djs and viusal artists, used an additional room, actually did *something*
with the horrid hallways there and, believe it or not, cost
$10...unfortunately while this party may have been a better *value* it was
horrifying vibe-wise.

You had to ask. =)

Re: Basics/Gathering/Vision, in general I have always regarded these
parties as the yardstick with which to measure the biggies...

take it easy

well, without griping too loudly, i feel as if i've rarely, if ever,

I mind, somewhat, the high price.  I have, more than once, been treated
to a full body search and arbitrary confiscations by security.  At
certain events of the wicked persuasion, the price has been raised through-
out the night, from 13 to 15 to 20 dollars.  The sound at Wickeds (every
single one) has been abysmal.  The knock-me-over factor has been extremely
high at all Wickeds, and fairly high at all Martin events.  The clique
factor has been extremely high at all these events.  The quality of
mixing has been high, but the music has rarely if ever moved me to do
more than sway (the exception is Tony, who always seems to have two or
three tracks that I've found in obscure places and loved), and often
drives me right out of the room.  I attended several Martin parties where
the security was so in-your-face as to make life unbearable.  I have
attended many Wickeds and Martin parties where there were no in-and-outs,
despite being told at the door on the way in there were.  I have heard the
same DJs play at these parties for going on two years...one
notable exception was a Wicked that Christophe played at.  I have paid
money for a renegade sound system that has never appeared.  I have seen
more and better visuals at the Orb and Orbital shows, for less money than
some of Martin's parties.  I have heard more and better sound at the 
Orbital show than Martin has ever marshalled.  I have never felt *safe* at 
any of these parties.  I have generally enjoyed the chill rooms/areas at 
these parties when there has been a chill area. it was my observation the 
other day that i'd have to be heavily enhanced to enjoy LFR...i was right.  
folks around me who were enhanced had a great time; i, unenhanced, had 
a tolerable time, and really looked forward to  leaving. oh, it was very
nice to see and talk with friends, but my mind and spirit were elsewhere,
yearning for different music, better visuals, nicer people all around.
when i hear talk of $40,000 budgets, i imagine the ~series~ of events
that i could help organize.  so far, i've spent about $900 out of pocket
and helped organize over 13 events...total cost to the attendee for all
parties: $8 plus any donations they chose to make (we've only asked for
money at the door at two events, and one of those was a benefit).

and, when i hear that large parties are near essential to the health of
the "house nation", i'd take issue.  from what i've seen at large parties,
diversity in artistic expression is *not* present...look at the DJ list,
the visuals list, the sound providers list, the location list. unification?
not from what i've seen and felt. increased communication? not from what
i've experienced.  improved dialectic? barely.  this is the first serious
discussion on SFR involving Martin directly, and the Wicked posse some-
what directly; i've never had these discussions in person with the
promoters.

do some people have fun at these things? yes, unequivocally yes. me? nope.
i keep giving them a try to see if things will be different, and they
aren't.  it's why i keep helping to provide alternatives.

Why do i keep going from time to time?  several reasons: 1) people say of
me that i only go to parties that i help organize or spin at; it ain't
so;  2) i want to give these people a chance from time to time, to see
how they're doing, and if my perceptions of them were wrong; 3) my friends
want to go, and want me to go with them; and 4) i sometimes go to promote
parties i'm involved with. And, i don't just gripe about these parties.
I take action by helping to organize events. and, i have a good time at
other events besides Wickeds and Martin parties and ones i participate
in planning, so i'm not just a sourpuss.

>>>The Sunset party started a little later than usual on Sunday at about 
3:30pm.
Shortly after the music started, a ranger-type dweeb wandered near.  I saw
his jaw drop, before he vanished in a hurry.  We were soon surrounded by 
a variety of uniformed authorities in squad cars and on scooters.  
Negotiations ensued, and the party was allowed to go on until 7 at a 
temporarily decreased volume. <<<

I thought the police were pretty cool about the whole thing considering that
they
could have shut down the party and written Galen a ticket. Thats what happend
to us
a few months ago but the charges got dropped.

Did anybody see the 2 guys who got arrested? They were smoking pot on the
other side
of the bunker when an undercover cop approached them. He called some
uniformed police types and after looking through his backpack discovered a
bunch of LSD & MDMA. What makes it really bad is that they were arrested in
the Presidio which makes it a federal crime and subject to stiffer penalties.
I guess the moral is to BE CAREFUL when doing drugs in public, you never know
who might be watching.

Bill Graham was alive in the begining of the rave scene and BGP promoted
at least one rave under the name of Brainstorm (production group).
I don't remember the name of the rave. As I recall from the reports I got
it sucked. Some friends had work in the show. BGP is still alive and
going its headed by his son.

	i arrived at the sunset party around 5:30... i was delighted to
find mr. phil smart providing sounds the place was neat....presidio...had
never been there before, etc. after great dancing for about an hour i
decided to walk around and enjoy the location. i climbed a flight of
cement stairs to an interesting platform and saw a handful of friends
peering down below to the ground. i walked over to them and when i looked
down i felt that weird buzz i always feel when i see the authorities at a
party. the badges were handcuffing two guys and hauling them off. the
story that was passed to me was one i had heard before... a designated
undercover (narc) had fooled the boys into selling him e. the narc
appeared to me as a fashionable filipino male around 26-30 years of age.
he was dressed in a khaki vest with matching khaki hat, i believe he had a
blue and green flannel on under the vest...if this helps anyone...i do
believe i have seen him around before well the story goes on ...the boys
were searched..goods were seized...posession..tears...OH WHY DOES IT HAVE
TO BE LIKE THIS!!? this is exactly the thing that makes everyone say "FUCK
THE POLICE!" ...these boys have no intention of hurting or posing a threat
to anyone/anything, yet they are stripped of their dignity and thrown into
a squad car as if they have done something horribly wrong. as they were
loaded into the vehichle friend tracy gave them the number of a really
good attorney.

circles of the past this one got so big it seperated and our semi-circle
ended up hiking around behind the dj booth. any way i am getting off the
subject. since i was only there for the morning i obviously missed the
prior line-up. what i need to know is the order of the line-up because i

The following is a general consensus of a small group of overanalyzers
us who went to freedom:

Simon came on after Tony, and started off pretty well actually.  High 
energy multilayered stuff.  But after a while, his set got kinda boring.  
I really haven't been crazy about Simon for over a year now - a lot 
of the songs he plays focus on the midrange frequencies, and although 
pretty energetic, seem rather souless and sterile without being 
trancey.   Spun followed, and played some funky tunes that were OK, but 
never really established much of a groove.  The set was enjoyable, but 
kinda low key, energy-wise.  Things definately picked up with Josh, 
though he didn't blow me away.  I felt that the music at the last
Gathering (Richmond) with a similar lineup was better.

Upon reflecting with friends about the music at Freedom, we agreed
that we'd rather hear mediocre sets on a great sound system (as was
the case here) than great sets on a shitty sound system.  Anyway, I
never go to parties looking for perfection, and the music was certainly
good enough for our needs, i.e. we had little trouble dancing our asses 
off. d:-)

	I agree with you, but it's going to take lots of people to do it. 
The fundamental problem here is we live in a society that promotes
materialism based on money.  Too many people have forgotten that money is
just something that we all agree on.  Money is something created by
people, so many people stress out on it and act like it is something 
real, when it is really mostly paper and electronic bits.  To invoke 
change on society, we must make our message big.  And unfortunately, in 
this society, if you are going to make something BIG, you need money.  
You can't go on forever throwing free big parties.  It's like the NRA 
when a gun control law is going to be passed, they pump millions of 
dollars into fighting that. I guess that is why I don't mind paying $20 
for certain parties (when I can afford to, that is).  I have really come 
to a personal realization that I don't care about money, even though 
that's hared to do sometimes, because I am a starving student.

	I'm totally happy about this too.  Just think that every time you 
say something on this net, over 900 people can recieve it.  The 
possibilities of sfr to help us define who we are as a rave scene and 
what message we want to say to the rest of the world are limitless..

	This sounds like the right type of idea, and I think it could be 
a good start.  Would we want to do DC or start here in Sacramento 
(wouldn't it be cool if Pete Wilson came to a rave and joined in the 
circle with the rest of us happy ravers?  hmm?)

I just wanted to say one more thing about my response to ethan's 
article.  I really agree that we need to fight the materialism.  But I 
think we also need to realize that we live in a materialistic society, 
and trying to force change on people won't work as well as just letting 
it happen.  I really think it is already happening to a certain extent.  
But we can't get discouraged if we still see negative energy all around 
us.  It's just there, and if we let it be there, it will slowly 
dissapate, and it might not all happen in our lifetimes.  We will pass 
our message of peace and love without strings or credit cards on to our 
children, and we ought not to worry about whether or how they use that 
information.  

At one of the last parties I went to, I sat with some of my friends and 
we all came to an agreement that our revolution is hard to fight, because 
we don't really stress anything more than inner peace and acceptance of 
our neighbors and communication between everyone.  Even negative people 
can't fight our being positive.

My dear friend Sean Hall wrote in "Feel":

"New people are constantly being accepted into my tight-knit circle of 
friends.  Even people that don't seem to have the best attitude or 
friendliest disposition, seem tol let themselves go when they are 
surrounded by us.  It's as if we are showing them the way, and the 
greatest part is that we dont try to, it just comes naturally."(Feel, 
Vol. 2, Issue One, May 1994, page 4.)

I've experienced this, too.  I feel like I am showing people the way, 
especially negative people.  They can't fight you when you simply sit 
down and refuse to fight them back or be negative.  


HAVE FUN TODAY.  THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

And by doing this, you become just another part of the system you are 
trying to leave behind.

"Changing the system from within" is a fallacy.  The system will only let
you in after you have changed yourself enough to conform to its rules --
or when you have changed consensus reality enough to make it adapt, or die.

Kurt Cobain wearing a "Fuck Corporate Rock" T-shirt on the cover of Rolling
Stone didn't weaken corporate rock, just like Clinton blowing sax on MTV
didn't change the drug laws, just like throwing $20 parties won't
weaken the wage-slavery combine.  They might be fun (which is why I don't
attack their existence) but I don't pretend that they're revolutionary.

> You can't go on forever throwing free big parties.

But you can go on throwing free (or cheap) small parties, which become
free (or cheap) bigger parties, or even several free (or cheap) small
parties.

Sacto would be a good start -- get the car or bus-pools going and converge
the House Nation on the Capitol steps.  Now _that_ would be worth some
money and time to get happening, especially after the Brazilians showing
up for the World Cup proved that lots of happy partying people != disaster.

Speaking of which, the articles in the Merc about the "Brazilian Invasion"
were surprisingly sympathetic, even to the point of wondering whether the
US is too strict and puritanical.  The coolest anecdote was about a big
bunch of Brazilians partying their way down the street being stopped and
told by an officer that "You need a permit to parade down this street,"
to which someone replied, "We're Brazilians, man!  We don't need permits!"
and sambaed their way down the avenue.

Good discussion going here.  Don't anyone back off from their opinions,
please, it's very important to hear all this considering where we are
at with the current state-of-the-scene.  At the same time I like it
that nobody seems to be taking this personally as sometimes is the 
case.  This sort of discussion is edging us closer towards why we're
doing all this crazy shit to begin with . . . !

I will say this in defense of King St., three or four of the best
parties I ever went to were there -- particularly the 'Hardkiss Birthday
Party' in January 1993.  I continue to hear great things about the
ambient party with Mixmaster Morris also, although I couldn't go.
King St. is great if it's not too crowded.

Thanks for putting on a great party.  The music was both energetic and
nostalgic .   I love that fast whacky beat.  Everyone was just so glad
to be there too!  It'll take me a few days to recover from this one 
as I have haven't been inclined to such rave-aerobics in awhile :) 
Next time I'll have to wear reeboks or something just to save my body
from the constasnt JARRING brought out by the increased FREQUENCY of up
and down motion initiated by DJ's who can dish out INTENSE DOSAGES OF
BEAT! 
OR I could just calm down.  ok thanks SFRaves.

>>>Bummer. :^(  Didn't see it.  What did the undercover cop look like?  I
have to assume that he specifically followed the Sunset party to the site
cause I can't imagine any other reason for an undercover cop to be
hanging around there.  So much for "freedom weekend".  Thanks for the 
warning.  <<<

I doubt he was following the Sunset party. I'm sure he is assigned to patrol
the area for people doing drugs, having/solicting sex, getting robbed, raped
etc.
There are alot of tourists and others that frequent the area and I'm sure the
police
are there to keep it safe for everybody (including us ravers). I knew a girl
in high 
school that was raped near that spot during full daylight. 
Anyways, the most important thing is to be sure of your surroundings and the
people
around.

Hello,

In a positive way, I would like to ask to see the breakdown of the
$40,000 cost of the earlier rave.

This could produce the following results:

- It turns out that $40K is really the minimum cost for that event and
everyone gets a better feeling for $20 events, AND other potential
promoters have a better idea of costs, so they don't go broke
underestimating costs, OR
- It turns out that some of us say "gosh, you paid $5k for
such-and-such?  We did it once for only $1500." and the promoters find a
new way to save some money on costs,  OR
- (unlikely from someone in this astute group) when it is broken down,
$40k is seen to be an over estimate...

How about it?

This is awful.  I, personally, have known 2 people who have been busted
for mere possession in the last 3 months.  I have heard that the bust
at the Sunset party was for possession only, also.

Sometimes I really feal helpless, becuase I think there is nothing we
can do to change this obviously flawed law.  If pot is still viewed 
as being an evil to society, then certianly drugs like acid or ecstasy
will be imposible to decriminalize.

I guess all I can do is warn people.  If you buy or injest a controlled
substance, you are committing a very serious crime.  So please, BE
CAREFUL, they are after us.  If stopping the drug problem means putting
all of us young, smart, loving people in jail, then that is what they will
do.

That is not at all what happened. The undercover cop (white guy with beard
and baseball cap) was walking by and saw 2 guys and 2 girls smoking pot.
He went up to them and identified himself, called for uniformed and the other

with
the rest of his pot.

Okay, undoubtedly *not* my last statement on the subject :) 

Just because last year's LFR cost $40,000 does not prove the assertion that
parties of this size must, or need to cost this much. Embarking on a profit
based endeavor creates a certain atmosphere. Embarking on a free or
break-even based endeavor creates a different (and I'm *not* saying better)
atmosphere. Believe me when I say that if the same party or, better, a
party of the same scale were attempted on a free, or break-even, basis it
would cost *dramatically* less, IMO, on the order of night and day.

For example:

Penelope's Web Site        $1200 (for the whole weekend!)
Plenty of Sound            $1500
DJs                        $0000 (Donated)
Visuals                    $0000 (Donated)
Security                   $0000 (Not an issue, different crowd)
Insurance                  $0000 (Not an issue, not required)
Promotion                  $0300 (30,000 2-sided b/w fliers)
Logistics                  $1000
Food/Water                 $1000
Misc.                      $1000

Total                      $6000

If 1000 people $6 each
If 2000 people $3 each
etc.

Feel free to add items I've forgotten. Hoewever the site quote is solid and
right from the source. At "Home" (a large party I threw) 6 pairs of the big
Community stacks cost $700. 6 alone would be adequate, 12 stacks would be
truly *plenty* of sound. Promotion costs are accurate as well. $1000 for
logistics seems generous....So unless there's some $35,000 item I'm
forgetting seems plenty feasible to me.

It's all about energy. If you *wanted* to make this happen, got other
people that wanted it to happen involved, they got their friends involved
and *everyone* promoted, here, in LA, in Seattle, on all the regional
'x'rave lists, it could easily be done...

F&F VIII perhaps...  :)

take it easy

Yes, there is a need to clarify these positions. Nice to get a response
straight from the horses mouth, as it were. As an aside remember that the
word 'amateaur' comes from the root 'am' as in 'amore' and, translated,
means: someone motivated by love :)

In general agreed; I would not expect anyone to not try and optimize
whatever professional position they put themselves in. However I know for a
fact that both FTT and Cool World have paid DJs on the order of $1200 for a
2-hour set. Which, as we've noticed, results in bloated budgets which then
'necessitate' $20 price tags. I'm not going to suggest (again) that people
*shouldn't* have a profit motive in promoting raves but, like a farmer that
overplants his soil thereby depleting it's nutrients, $20 parties,
especially shitty ones, will wear out *your* market. Bottom line: I think
the whole shebang is inflated (especially in summer!) and that the scene
would really benefit from more promoters and djs making an obvious attempt
to demonstrate some good (financial) will (like the fmr) towards the people
that support them. Not to get too carried away on the subject, however, it
has been my experience that most of the so called "big name djs" have been
willing to play for free at free parties when asked to. Unfortunately they
haven't always followed thru, which is to say, actually showed up. 

>I agree that $20 parties are steep. I wouldn't pay that much for a party
>and if I did I'd damn well expect to entertained! 

Then why do you (Wicked) throw parties that, by your own admission, you
wouldn't attend?

>Equating with music concerts, though, people will happily spend $15 - $30
>or more to go to The Warfield, The Filmore, The Shoreline etc. to see some
>bands play for a few hours. Is $20 so much to pay to stay up all night?

I'll reprise a paragraph form an ealier post here: 

Comparisons to BGP style mainstream concerts don't prove the point either.
If all we're measuring ourselves against is something that is obviously and
grossly inflated then our standards are far too low. Why shouldn't we
challenge, rather than perpetuate, the hyperinflated material consumerism
that is the hallmark of american 'culture' if not western so-called
civilization? 

I think my idealism is getting in the way lately. I thought we were trying
to challenge some of the dominant paradigms. If we (you) just want to be an
another entre on the mainstream american platter then yes, I suppose $20 is
not a lot to pay for a nights 'entertainment'.

>As to Wages. The figures quoted I think are somewhat inflated. I think if
>you half them you might get a more realistic amount. 

Which figures are these? The ones I suggested or the $60K (Spun) and $100K
(Doc Martin) figures? As noted above, $1000 - $1200 for a 2-hour set can be
verified.

>And of course these >are gross earnings. You must remember that
>professional DJ's run their own business - they're self- employed. Net
>earnings are much different if you take into account the spend on vinyl per
>week. Most concientious DJ's buy a lot of records ($5 -$10 a pop).

Yes, being self employed has a lot of hidden overhead: dental, medical and
yes, vinyl. But, just out of curiosity, how much, on average, do you spend
on vinyl a week? I won't aim this directly at you, but if everyone's
spending so much on vinyl, I sure wish I was hearing some more new music. I
went to the Pure Space immediately prior to the Wicked at 19th and Alabama.
Garth played, then Jeno came on played no less than 4, and I think it was
more like 6, of the exact same songs. Two days later at Wicked they did the
they exact same thing. And, in actual point of fact, I've been hearing the
same sets from them for the last month and a half which, in case you hadn't
noticed, means I've been *supporting* them. My take: I haven't been getting
a lot for my money. For you to call this griping is, IMO, in very poor
taste.

>Even with all the griping, I think the diversity in the Bay Area is
>enormous, more so than anywhere in the country. Small, medium, large
>parties. Free, cheap, expensive. Acid Jazz, Techno, House, Garage etc.

I see the possibility here for a misinterpretation on my part of your vague
use of the word griping, so please clarify. But as long as we're on the
subject lets put the cards on the table and discuss some of the other
gripes with Wicked. I don't mean to attack you personally here and I can
easily see as how you might not want to be "The Voice of Wicked" but, to
some extent, you have you've thus identified yourself. So...

One of the main gripes I've heard about Wicked is that, in effect, you
operate as a cartel. Promoters have allegedly been "harassed" for not
replacing one Wicked DJ that was unable to play with another. Package
deals: Jeno won't play if Garth can't and vice versa are also reputed to be
a common occurrence. Given that these occurrences are true (are they?),
what right have you, as a collective, to try and exert that kind of
influence? We all try and get our friends gigs, but this takes it a bit far
I'd say. 

There's other people out there that would like a chance to play as well.

>

We are. So grab the rest of the boys and come on by sometime. You never
know, you might actually have a good time.  :)

hi y'all,
this  discussion raise some interesting points: supposing that rave kulture
'wants' to reach  a larger population, we need massives. do these massives
 have to be expensively run ? nrg seems to indicate that this is not
the case. so then why the higher priced raves at all ? by entering the
capitalist market, raves become part of that culture rather than challange
it and/or change it. and the rules of capilatist market will start to
dictate the nature and/or price of the party rather than the participants.
i don't see a way out of this. it is the old means/ends 'split'. it DOES
matter how we get there, the 'new' structure: the way there is part of
the new structure , post-capitalist/anarchist/whatever. or this is at
least one possiblity.
take care/shalom

 The date for the SFR Picnic in Sunnyvale Baylands Park will be 
August 20th , a Saturday. I just called the park and made the 
reservation . The picnic area is called "Owl Burrow" , and is
located at the far end of the park.

 I will be posting a more detailed message about this , but I 
want to talk about one thing first. Due to some error in communication,
I had the sound system restriction wrong- it wasn't 25 AMPS , it is
25 WATTS. So , I want to warn folks right now , it may not be 
bone-shaking bass that we can put out here.

 If anyone has any ideas/recommendations , let me know. ( Really 
efficient speakers would be nice , maybe also some way to enclose the 
dance area - to maximize the sound and minimize the sound that
gets out. ).

	Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - Also - which would people be more interested in - a late lunch
 thing from 1PM to 6PM , or a dinner thing from 3PM to 8PM? We have
 the site all day until 8:45PM anyway.

	I never listen to hearsay.

	I think if people are going claim something in a post they should
	have the necessary, pertinant information to back that claim.

	

	Find me the person who payed $20 for a sole Wicked event.



	If anyone thinks Garth, Jeno or anyone else at Wicked are  playing the
	same old music why not tell them to their face. I'm sure they would
	welcome the feedback. Or write a post to me - I can pass it on.

Community ConneXion: The NEXUS-Berkeley is having its first public
monthly meeting on July 10th, 12pm, the Sunday after the cypherpunks
meeting.

It will be upstairs at Kip's in Berkeley. It will be very
informal. We'll be able to snag a table to fit all of us, I think, and
from my experience at Kips on Sunday afternoons it should be quiet
enough. We'll probably have to get some food so they don't kick us
out. Shouldn't be a problem.

Items on the agenda: (not yet formalized/finalized.. suggestions welcomed)

	Privacy
		Privacy services
		Privacy emphasis
	Community
		building a local discussion group
		forum
		moo
	Organization
		Need to get more organized
		Find someone to help with that
		Issue of investors?
	NexusBucks
		Scheme
		goals

Directions:
	From I-80:
	Take the University Exit, go East on University until you
reach Shattuck. Turn right onto Shattuck. 3-4 blocks south turn left
onto Durant. Continue on Durant about 4-5 blocks, Kips is on the left
the block before Telegraph. Find parking. (It shouldn't be very
tough.. not like there will be an actual *lot*, but not tough..)

Summary:
	Nexus-Berkeley Meeting
	July 10th 12pm-? (maybe 4-5?)
	Kips in Berkeley
	
	I'd like to make this a regular thing, to have a meeting every
month the sunday after the cypherpunks meeting.

OKay, now that I am fully awake to write my post. I loved Liquid Drano. 
It was great listening to ultra-cheesy/hardcore/and hard trance. Bryce's 
sets were hilarious. It brought back so many memories. I loved Laura's 
set. Too bad SF sorta tamed her and she really didnt get into her 
hardcore set. Oh well. Next time. "I smell a blood of an english muffin."
It was great seeing everyone. Well, I guess I can be callled the hardcore
commuter: SF->SJ->SF->Los Gatos->SJ->SC->SF->work. *yawn* thinking about 
all that driving tires me. *phew*. Thanks to Bryce, Laura, etc. for 
putting on the party and to Hardcore Kia and Sharon for the "conversation"
up to SF.

I was there and had a good time while the music was going.
We didn't want to pay the bums to park so we parked at the end of 24th.
One of the locals tried to approach us and tried to get $2 from us so we

Who were the people collecting money and what authority do they have over

Actually I've been talking to a few people about doing this next summer.
I'd try it this summer but I have a second child due in a month and a half
besides which this summer is getting a bit long in the tooth. 

If you'd like to be involved, I'm sure there's room for everyone.

            we built a ramsey fm-10 last year to use at our boombox parties.
                the signal is alright,a little noisy but full range.it 
doesn't transmit very far,maybe 25 yards.further if you use a good anntenae.
contact radio free berkeley for info on amplifiers to boost this kit.

 Actually , 25 yards transmitting radius would be just right - I wouldn't
want to boost it any more than that . I think I have the same kit (Ramsey),
I'm glad that someone on the list has already tried it out. "A little
noisy" ? , well , thats to be expected for $35. 

 After the picnic , my transmitter is going to my father-in-law - he's
going to be listening to the TV audio on it ( he's a bit deaf , and the
volume he needs to listen to it at is too loud for the rest of the family.
The plan is for him to listen to the TV audio on his FM radio w/earphones ).

Hi all,
        Thank you Ethan for pulling the needed response from me and for
your kind and inspiring words.  It is nice to communicate with 900? people
@ 0nce and hear your comments, criticisims etc.  Most of you seemed to
enjoy Freedom as did most of the people not on the net. That makes me happy
to say the least.  Still i have heard that it was to far to travel from
some people.  One thing i believe is we have to learn to travel great
distances. Not only in the way of miles to a party or festival as the House
Movement ( your comments taken into consideration ethan ) expands within
america, but also in the distance we have to travel into the depths of
depths of our inner selves.  This is nessacary to in order to love and
accept ourselves first, the world will follow in due course.  This is
something i struggle with on a daily basis, somedays a lot, some a little. 

        I have put parties on for three years now, i have done them for
lots of different reasons over the years.....  For the love and happiness
that is created at them; for the boost to my ego; to satisfy my drive to be
the best at whatever i do; to create an enviornment where people are more
suseptable to achieve a higher state of consciousness; to bring people
together; for the money that can sometimes be made:  These are just some of
the reasons, but for the most part as i sit here now, reflecting, the main
reasons.  I think you would agree there are both good and bad reasons in
there.  You see, i am just a human being, i am no better or worse than any
of you.  I am just doing the best i can to make sense of whats going on
around me.  I see right, i see wrong, i see change.

It is not clear to me whether raving, even as a "movement" is intended
to specifically challenge/change capatalism.  What is clear to me is that 
raving enables us to experience our ability to transcend our differences 
and come together in a spirit of energy, respect and caring for each other.

>... it DOES

I don't think I can completely agree with this.  There are many paths
to the same end; no one way is necessarily right for everybody.

At Freedom, when a few hundred of us held hands and experienced Unity,
Love and Silliness, it didn't matter who paid $20 or who was guested or 
who was Xing or what kind of music was played or who made money or how 
good the visuals were... It just happened because everyone there wanted 
it to and believed in the vision of what raving is supposed to be about.

I am hopeful that despite the variety of perceived flaws in our scene, 
those of us who continue to seek out the *positive* will continue to 
experience and perpetuate it in a variety of ways.

Ok folks!
The Freak Out! Possie and the Shake Your Booty Sound System are going to try
and do a dayytime/night house (warming) party on Saturday, July 16th. It all
depends if we can get out of a prior comitment and get the sound system down
to Santa Cruz. Saturday is also the day the comet colides with Jupiter so we
can celibrate that also. I'll get back to you with the details as soon as I
know.

Is it true that they have been having house DJs at the Catalyst on Wednesday
nights?

I'd put it this way: _I_ hope that raving as a movement will, among other
things, help to specifically challenge/change capitalism.  And I know I'm
not the only one that feels that way.  Maybe we aren't all expecting the
same ends from our movement?  But then is it really a movement?  Questions,
questions...

You're both right.  Obviously there is not just one way, but if the way we
take is paved with corruption, the corruption will still be stuck in our
soles when we get there and we won't be able to get it out.

by the way, in case anyone was still wondering, liquid drain-o was dope.
Everything I would expect from an outdoor party and more.  And, I made an
accidental discovery from the fact that i didn't have enough oranges to give
everyone their own: the best thing you can give to someone is the ability to
give themselves!

What do you mean by "corruption"?  
- paying off a bum $2 to not report a trespass?
- taping and selling DJ sets of copyrighted material?
- paying a corrupt SFPD for a sound permit?
- putting friends on a guest list?

If we let debates over these kinds of philosophical issues stop us from 
coming together to share and perpetuate our message, there won't be much 
in the way of a rave scene, or a movement.

Maybe, maybe not.  When I step in shit, I can usually manage to eventually
get most, if not all of it off of my shoe.  Oh, you meant soul :-)  Well 
that can be cleansed also.  I believe in evolution - we humans will make
mistakes along the way to wherever we are going; the important thing (IMO)
is to keep moving in a positive direction.

In response to a recent comment on the meaning of the rave movement, I have
this to say.

I think raving in itself, and the music, has very little to say.  The music is
good music, technically, and it can give one a good happy feeling.  But it
doesn't get me thinking about unity and peace and stuff.  Unless I'm on
something.

I think the politics come from the promoters, and can come in any form.  You
could have a Rush Limbaugh rave, just as easily as a Greenpeace rave.  However,
generally the alternative (I hate to use that word) scene is where the raves
are at, be it pop alternative, or underground alternative.  And alternative is
generally about freedom, and open minded-ness.  Therefore, that's the general
political voice and backbone of raves.

However, how many raves have you been to that was overtly political, or even
just had something to say?  Although I had a good time at Let Freedom Rave, and
there were a lot of nice people there, and people who were into meeting new
friends, there were also a lot of people who were there just for the scene, or
just for the music, or just to be drugged up, or even just for a fight.  Peace
and unity wasn't on their minds.

It's true, I read it in the Enquirer.  I saw a picture of NY covered in 
snow!  Really!  It's true, because I read it there!

	I didn't read it in the Enquirer, but I heard it from one of my 
dorm friends.  I think from what I heard, though, they are not very 
ravey.

My friend Timothy is throwing a party >4500' above sea level, as he 
believes that the polarity of the earth will reverse and everything will 
slide 2000 miles south.  I don't know what 4500' has to do with this, but 
the party should be.... interesting.  And plus it's happening on my 
birthday! :-)

Peace,

              to add a little perspective to all this talk about the 
social and political implications of the "rave scene"----we just got back 
from the rainbow gathering in wyoming.this gathering of several thousand 
people was completely free including camping, parking, food, drugs, in 
fact ,the use of money is totally unneccesary and obsolete!!!no permit 
was obtained for the use of this public land because the rainbow family 
do not recognize anyone's authority to issue a permit for land that is 
our's to begin with.noone is in charge, there are no security people, you 
are free to walk, climb, run ,swim, smoke ,and freek  anywhere that you 
feel like (with respect to others around you).the self governing nature 
of this gathering relies on a wisdom-system that evolves and mutates 
collectively---the rules are not handed down.of course the family have 
been working on this for over twenty years, but the end result is that 
they have created for themselves (and anyone else who wants to include 
themselves)a powerful force for personal and social change which does not 
concede an ounce of it's energy to the surrounding political and economic 
forces.pretty cool , huh?

Is anyone here planning on going to the Burning Man Festival this Labor Day 
Weekend?  It's going to be up in the Black Rock Desert, about a 7 hour 
drive from SF (but not in the same location as last year).

Brian, Bryce, and I are up for it.  We're even thinking about bringing
MetroVision along if we can figure out a way to keep our records from
melting -- even in the shade in the daytime I suspect it will be too
hot for them.  If you have any  ideas . . . . 

If you are seriously planning on going let me know.  There is an
address to which you must send $30 to register, get directions, and
get some high desert camping/survival information.  I've got that address
somewhere, I'll have to dig it up.  So anyway, I figured that any
of us going could coordinate hauling/sharing supplies and rides.  If
you're not near the Bay Area and are going and would like to meet up
at the Festival, let me know and we can plan for a camping neighborhood
or something.

Of course, once I get there, the planning stops :-)  I fully realize
that chaos and cacophany rule.  I just don't want things to be so
chaotic during the packing/driving stage that we've forgotten something
once we're up there.

Laura

	I bought the same last year. It works, but I cannot set it correctly
	for stereo output (it has a lot of noise). Anyway, it can be a backup 
	for yours (and it is available for the future).

	What about having also a few boombox around ? They are not part of 
	the sound-system, and can contribute to the bass level.

	I would suggest (and if I have time I would do that) to go in the
	park one of this weekends before the party for checking the transmitter
	and finding the right frequency.

	
	Speaking of silent-raves, I found in July Wired (pg. 40) a description
	of the Interactor Vest, something you put on and connect to a sound 
	source to feel the vibrations of basses. They suggest to use it to
	play 'Mortal Kombat', I had another idea :)
	Anybody of you knows more about this toy ?

  This is regarding your letter about the person who said that they heard 
of people paying any where between $13 to $20 for the Wicked that was at 
19th and Alabama.  I'm sorry to say that I didn't go to that one, but i 
am usually seen at almost all of your parties at which I have always had 
a wonderful time.  As I understand, that night you had a person named 
chas running you door.  Well, I dont like to slam people but that is the 
same person that has sold bunk E to several of people that I know,  
stolen things from ameba, he is not allowed around here anymore.    

  With him at your door it is possible that he charged people more than 
he was asked to and kept the change for himself.  I am just telling you 
this as a friend, because i am tired of seeing you guys get slammed by 
other people in the scene saying that you charge $20 for a party.  I have 
never paid that much to go to one of your events but also, Chas was not 
at the door.  I advise you not to have that guy at your door and you 
won't have any problems with people getting charged $20.

See ya Saturday,

Tracy Ameba

Ever since I heard about it last year, I wanted to go. I'm really
serious about going this year.

My small wagon is really uncomfortable for backseat passengers to
ride in for any length of time. I was thinking about trading passenger
space for gear space. I can get quite a bit of gear in my car.

[Cost breakdown... I have omitted the items which I choose not to
comment on. -Sean]

 > Security                 5,200

I wasn't there and I'm curious; how much and what kind of security
does this buy? (How much are rent-a-cops vs Lyons etc.?)

 > dj's                     5,500

Could we break this down by DJ?

 > laser                    1,000

How many, how long, what kind and color of lasers, and what kind of
effects? I'm into lasers so I'm really curious. Maybe I'll put some
higher end gear together and start doing big raves...

 > visuals                  2,000

What kind of visuals were they?

 > cash and door people     1,800

How many were there? This really seems like a lot.

 > clean up                   250

Now this seems like a bargain!

 > toilets                    750

This too, if there were enough for a couple thousand people!

Come/Unity was great last night, back it its rightful place (1015).
Too bad it had to end at 3:30.  I picked up a few flyers but not as
much as usual.  What's up with the slow summer?  April and May were
packed with cool parties.  Actually there's still more than enough,
but I guess we're spoiled here.  Check out the new moon party and
Wicked this weekend, and Sunset or Mushroom Jazz or Elation after
that...

	Hey Markie, how's it goin'?  I don't get on the net much but i 
couldn't help but notice that in your reply to all the various complaints 
you said that someone said that they paid $20 for the Wicked party at 
19th and Alabama.
	Working here at Ameba I hear all sorts of things from the people 
that attend the various parties of the weekend.  I heard from a few 
out-of-towners that they were charged $20, which I thought was kind of 
wierd especially since every wicked that I have been to has always been 
$15 or less.
	Well by the end of the day at the store I learned that the 
infamous Chaz was working your door that night, which explains why people
were charged $20.  He used to work this same scam at Charter Oaks.  
Example: The Agreed amount of the party is $15, Chaz charges $20 and 
keeps $5 for himself, be careful he is very good at this and selling bunk 
E at your parties.
	I hope that you take my letter seriously, I speak from past 
experiences.  He has stolen from Ameba, therefore he is not allowed here 
anymore.
	Good luck in all that you do.  I'll be there Saturday.
Thanks for all the good times, Tracy Ameba

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno

In my recent post regarding Wicked I did *not* mean to imply that Wicked
has routinely or historically charged $20. I have never paid more than $15
for a Wicked party. However people did claim to have paid that much ($20)
for the party at 19th & Alabama. Recent information on this list suggests
the possibility that Wicked may have been unaware that this was happening.
However as Wicked made no statement on the subject, and, in fact, may not
have known, there would be no way for anyone, like myself, to know whether
or not this was an anomaly, which is to say mistake, or simply a new
pricing arrangement.

We (we = me and my dog, Evan and maybe my husband) are definately 
interested in going this year. I'd like to car- and gear-pool with a 
group of people.

A side note about this event: apparently it has become a very public 
and popular kind of thing. Last year there were even TV stations 
covering it! So, just a warning that it's not nearly as private as it 
has been is years past...if that's what you're looking for you might 
be disappointed by the hordes at Burning Man (though the new location 
might be a help.

am usually seen at almost all of your parties at which I have always had 
a wonderful time. <<<

I was going to go to that one but after standing in a line that didn't
move for 45min with asshole security I left vowing to never return to
there. I'm glad I left because i heard the entire party was a disaster
with lots of sound problems. They were charging $15 at the door when I
was in line.

stolen things from ameba, he is not allowed around here anymore.<<<

That guy is definately bad news.
He once tried to pick up on my girlfriend and give her some E when she
was sitting in my lap. If I wasn't candy flipping that night I probably
would have beat him silly. I didn't see him at the door that night but
I wouldn't be suprised if he did something like that.

	THis is a good idea. I'd like to go but I don't really know

Subject: guitar player looking for DJ's a/or band for raves

Recently turned onto the rave techno scene. I've been playing guitar for 12
years and have played in several bands and played in most of the clubs in San
Francisco.
While at a rave last week I thought it would be interesting to hear some live
artists working with a DJ. My friend turned me on to Amourphous Androgenous,
Young American Primitive, Orb, etc. I WANT to play music like that! If anyone
is interested in experimenting I would be more than happy to drag my
equipment over, or you can bring you're rig to my practice studio in the city
(SF). I would like to play at some parties, I really get off playing in front
of groovy people, the more people the better I play.

I believe the rave scene has taught me that if people can be this 
friendly and peaceful around each other at a rave, then there must be a 
way that people can be that way all the time, without drugs.  It's true, 
the music itself has really very little to say.  My opinion about house 
music is that when I am on something, I lose track of time dancing, 
partially because there's no words in it.  A lot of the sounds used in 
house music sound like they come from nature, but they're created 
electronically.  To me, it's almost contradictory, but it's beautiful.  I 
listen to songs sometimes and say "I've heard this song somewhere 
else--but it wasn't a house song."  Also, when I first started raving, I 
had heard stories about people getting into it too much, wanting to go 
out every night and take something.  So right from the beginning, I 
wanted to try to enjoy it afterwards after I came down.  My first rave 
was so fun.  Since I was told what raves were supposedly about (inner 
peace and cultural unity; love your neighbor), I found that happiness 
almost before I got there.  Since that time I have found the music to 
inspire me, and I don't need to be high.  I guess I am responding to your 
message, because I was concerned that you said the rave scene and the 
music doesn't get you thinking about unity and stuff.  I am curious, have 
you found yourself being more positive when not on something after going 
to a rave?

Yuck, a Rush Limbaugh rave?  Was that the one where Morton Downey Jr was 
the promoter and the lineup of DJ's were David Duke and special guest 
from the Traditional Coalition?

I don't think raves are meant to be overtly political.  I think the 
message is simply that people dance, are happy together, and simply just 
exist in a large crowd without hurting each other or being violent.  The 
message is that people are so happy just existing, that nothing more 
needs to be said.  When I was agreeing with Ethan about a walk on 
Sacramento, I don't know how political I would personally like it to 
get.  I think just by keeping it alive, we are showing people around us 
that we are not a threat to society, unlike many other gatherings of 
large groups of people.  I mean, I heard cops were not trying to break up 
the last full moon, but they were in fact showing people the way.  I 
don't know if it's true or not, but I am hearing more and more about 
people saying how nice ravers are.  The word is getting around, and 
that's why I don't think we need to be totally political, except to fight 
to keep our scene alive.  I was part of the group of people that called 
the SF supervisors to protest the law about dancing after 2am if you're 
under 21.  I helped fight that, because it would suppress those people's 
right to dance.   


This is my definition of the rave scene:  Teaching people to exist 
alongside one another by being positive rather than negative.  

I'm curious.  What are other people's definitions?  What does the scene 
mean to you?

Hello,

I have the following Vinyl LPs left over from the days when I used to be
the only mail order retailer in the US for these titles (I'm no longer
doing any music retailing :-( ).

I'd like to trade them (individually) for DJ tapes, either IDM or not...
in fact, old stuff is perhaps preferable (91? 89?).  Or else for tapes
of old out of print techno or house.  (Which is not to say that I'd
refuse DJ tapes of the latest IDM/house/trip-hop/jungle/? ).

They are (all still sealed and all "reissues") :

Manuel Gottsching - E2-E4 (6 copies) - The million-selling hit of Summer
'89 "Sueno Latino" was a "cover" of this 60-minute long track.  In the
TEEX book, Dr. Patterson describes his favorite ambient albums, and says
this in his description of Steve Hillage's "Rainbow Dome Musick":

"Mix Manuel Gottsching's 'E2 = E4' with 'Rainbow Dome Music" and you'll
be very surprised at the end result.  Music to rebuild your head after a
heavy night".  So, all you need are two 1200's and the RDM LP and this one.

Richard Wahnfried - Time Actor (5 copies) - Richard Wahnfried is the
name that Klaus Schulze used for his collaboration albums.  This one
includes Arthur Brown ("I am the god of hellfire and I bring you
fire."), Vincent Crane (played keyboards on the original Fire), and Mike
Shrieve - percussionist for Santana.  There is a pretty weird "talk" by
Brown on this about the metaphysics of time...

Richard Wahnfried - Tonwelle (3 copies) - This is less Ambient and more
space-rock-ish.  Features Manuel Gottsching on guitar, Mike Shrieve on
percussion, and the artist-known-before-and-after-this-recording-as-Carlos
Santana :-) (but attributed to "Karl Wahnfried" in the liner notes).  Oh
yes, this is 18 minutes a side -- at 45 RPM (12").

Of course, there's Klaus Schulze on synths on both the Wahnfried LPs.

respect,

    Ken

I kind of doubt that that feeling of unity and peace and stuff would come
across so strongly if the music was'nt what it is even if you were on
something.  Would simply Xing a Metallica concert make the attendess start
smiling, holding hands and dancing ecstatically? Worth a try.  Maybe the
music has more of an effect than you think...

Wow!

$6 per person, just for the space.

I'm not familiar with the details of this event, was it more than one day?
If not, maybe we should all go into the "space" business :-) .

Well, it depends what you mean by capitalism.  I can't imagine anything
wrong with a free market system tempered by real anti-trust controls.
The problem comes from materialist and power junkies who distort the
system and use it for negative purposes.

Any other system (such as communism) really requires, in advance, that
EVERYBODY already has a positive vibe and community spirit, otherwise
you end up with all the same problems.

I think that it is really materialism and selfishness that you are
talking about changing.

Hey Guys,

I can understand the need to stop the crooks who charge extra $ for parties
only to pocket some of it for themselves.  I think it's wise to inform
everyone on the net as the best method to put and end to it.

I'm not sure, however, whether it's really necessary to name these people
for selling drugs.  People always will end up buying bunk anything and if
we were to run around and cry, so-and-so sold me shitty this or crappy
that, then we can't complain about cops visiting Wicked parties (or any
party for that matter) 'cause they heard people sell contraband there.

If you need to inform, take it offline...

- Steve

That's one of the things I think makes the rave scene really unique.
Without a lot of overt communication, people at a party come to an
surprising level of understanding and empathy. Out of nowhere, a
feeling of consentual sharing and (often) love comes forth. I felt
this at parties long before being exposed to any sort of of rave
rhetoric or philosophy.

I don't think it comes from any sort of message directed from raves. I
think that it's something many of us hold dear inside and which
flourishes in the autonomy and acceptance of a good rave.

Not that messages are bad or anything. I think they help set the
stage--encourage the right mindset. Good caring promotion ties in here
too. Provide a good positive experience for your guests and it makes
it that much easier for them to enjoy themselves and let loose that
good stuff inside.

The whole experience: experienced people setting an example, promotion
that says "we want you to share in this", the pounding beats, eye
candy, disinhibiting psychoactives, and the consentual "vibe" that
builds. I don't think this says (or really needs to say) any
particular message. I think what it does is makes it possible for a
very special part of ourselves to migrate outward and touch other
people. It's just the good side of human nature, that very personal
identity deep inside that just wants to love and be loved.

And if that wasn't nice enough, I hear from a lot of people that the
experience has a lot of carryover into real life. Some people, once
shown the way, find it a little easier from then on to reach out to
others.

ethan,
 when i first got on the net i learned that ideally it's main
purpose was to increase the communication within our *scene*. i also
learned that self promotion is frowned upon. the exception being promotion
of free parties. i have noticed you've done it more than once:  i.e. your
recent post/advertisement for your demo "acid test". i am not saying we
should limit the party info going through the net, i just think the info
could be stated without excessive use of adjectives and such. i feel that
the continuation of such posts could turn the net into an outlet to
increase popularity/exposure in the scene.

It's not necessarily self-promotion that I think it's frowned upon, it's 
*ego-centered* self-promotion.  It's not popularity or exposure that 
would be a problem, it's the *type* of popularity or exposure....

well, in light of my recent post concerning what i disliked about
wickeds and martin's parties, i thought i would give some time to
things i liked about them.  wicked persists.  martin persists.
when martin says a party will be at a particular place with particular
performers, it's there, with those performers better than 90% of the
time.  for those of you who prefer, there are guaranteed to be hundreds
of people (if not thousands) in attendance; not precisely my preference,
but noted.  the sound at all of martin's parties i have attended has
been massive (with one exception, which was an anomaly in many ways).
i've never been to a martin party that was busted.  one has almost
certainly heard all of the DJs before, and consequently knows the
kind and quality of music to expect (again, not entirely my preference,
but noted as desirable by many).

I certainly don't think that Ethan has crossed any line that should
be frowned uopn.  He certainly didn't say anything with "excessive
use of adjectives" and such -- here is his post:

Here are the adjectives he used:  6th, 2, live, djd, 21+, killer.

I've been away from diagramming sentences for about 15 years now,
so I'm sure I got some wrong, but my point is that the only "hype"
adjective Ethan used was "killer" and he only used it once so
that's hardly excessive.

How else are people supposed to get the word out about small parties
if they aren't allowed to post to sfraves?  Ethan's post struck 
me clearly as a combination of information and invitation, not as
some money-hungry advertising thing -- especially since I KNOW that
DJs at SPAZ don't get paid.

What is so wrong in telling the community about upcoming gigs?  When
it's done personally and in good spirit then what is the problem?
Should Ethan, myself, Martin, and everyone else maintain private
copies of the entire sfraves list so that when we want to get the
word out about things we can without posting it to sfraves? 

It's not like Ethan posted every day for a week "buy my tape" or
"come to SPAZ" -- he did it just once each.  He is a high-profile
member of the sfraves community and so a lot of people really ARE
interested that he has a tape and that he will be spinning at SPAZ.
If DJ Deaks or Tamotsu or anyone else were to get a gig someplace
I'd hope they'd post it to sfraves so we could find them if we
wanted -- for profit party or not.

I don't think it's rude to advertise a party or to say "Hey, I'm
spinning at this party, come out and visit."

As a matter of fact, I *want* people to do this so I'll not miss them!

i, personally don't mind some promotional info on whats happening or 
who's playing/spining wherever. Where else (other than the weekly calendar, 
which i missed this week?) should this info be posted and available? 

At least the subject title had the word promotion in it so those who don't 
like that sort of thing can simply skip/ignore the message.

i say keep it coming,

<my mail reader seems uninterested in quoting, unfortunately, so I will try to
paraphrase>

I'm not saying that dancing doesn't put me in a positive mood, and a good
mind-set.  But I get this feeling from *all* kinds of dancing, be it to hip hop
or rave or gothic or industrial.  Maybe in general the music is happier in the
rave scene, but Just being happy isn't really a statement.  It's nice, but it
isn't a statment.

And I feel that there is just as much negativity in the rave scene as there is
in other scenes.  Gangster wannabes go to raves, and annoying jock-types go to
raves, and teeny-bopper girls go to raves.  IMHO there may be a greater amount
of people who are into unity and group happiness, but there are probably more
of the other kinds of people at most raves.  *However*, I am speaking of the
typical rave scene, and *not* the more spur of the moment, and underground
raves.  But these are so few and far between, that one can't generalize about
the whole rave scene and think of just these.

discounted price. Today is my boyfriends 21st b-day, (he often mails to 
the list through my account) and he realllllly wants to go to wicked, the 
only problem is neither of us have the money to get in.
Any info would help, I really want to be able to get him there.

I think one of the points about the rave scene is that you get people 
from all walks of life together to join together and dance.  That's why I 
think things like the join hands in a circle at Freedom are so positive.

  HI Steve, How are you.  I think that you should meet the person that 
you are calling an informant.  I really don't see myself as such because 
it isn't illegal to rip people off by selling them vitamins.  The police 
will always be around our scene as long as there is prohibition in this 
country and we are not allowed to totally free.  I just think that people 
should be aware of who these people are for everyone's safety.  I will 
try not to mention these nasty facts of partying on the net any longer I 
just hope that you are never a victim of being ripped off or put in jail.

Thanks for your comments:

Tracy Ameba

	Hey New Moon Party goers,  The party at Point Reys got shut down 
by the rangers this afternoon.  Wait, don't get too upset, I got a  phone 
call from Greg and the location has been changed to the Chateau in 
Berkeley.  The Chateau is located on Hillagaff on block South of People's 
Park.  The party is supposed to kick off at 4pm this afternoon.  If you 
still need help with directions call the Mother Earth Sound System 
hotline at 510-549-6260 or Ameba at 415-750-9368.  Sorry about the mixup,
                           Thanks, Ameba and the New Moon Posse

	A couple of days ago at Ameba we received several copies of Mark 
Healey's new magazine 'Clublife' which had one of the stranges editorials 
that I have ever read, it goes as follows:

		DON'T BLAME SPEED.....	
	
	Much is often heard around San Francisco about how speed has 
destroyed the house scene.  Sure, it's not difficult for most people to 
bring to mind friends and aquintences who've crashed their lives into a 
wall of tweak.  Certainly, amphetamine use has become more conspicious 
and widespread, but to blame the end of good vibes in the house and 
techno scene on a drug?  First of all it reeks of the crass 
oversimplification that characterizes the popular media's attitude 
towards drugs- an attitude that those who are a little more well informed 
rightly complain about, but in this case seem to unthinkingly 
perpetuate.  There's a popular myth in our culture that drugs- and not 
people- are responsible for 'drug problems'.  It's an easy answer that 
takes the focus of attention away from the causes that are more 
difficult to quantify because they involve looking at out own behaviour 
and changing it.

	Speed didn't destroy our scene, if anyone 'destroyed' it we did.  
Speed use just grew to fill a vacuum, presenting itself as the next step 
in the logical progression from ecstacy abuse.  Infact, ecstacy when 
taken in large doses (more than 150mg or so, ie two hits of street 
quality ecstacy), produces an effect 'paradoxial' to it's usual emphatic 
qualities, an effect almost identical to that of amphetamine/......

	/What further complicates matters is that there are some people 
who can take amphetamines and use them to a positive effect in their lives.
/........

	/Even speed isn't always bad- not if you're learning, not if 
you're being creative, not if you're moving forward.


If anyone would like a copy of this publication to read for themselves we 
have a ton of them at ameba for free.  I think that this has to be one of 
the most uninformed of editorials that I have ever read.

Argghhhh!! We just got back from Point Reyes, where we got busted around
noon.  Unfortunately, our voice mail is having a seizure and we haven't 
been able to remove the message telling everyone to go to North Beach.  
So, ignore the New Moon info line.  Call the MESS line for location info
(510)549-6260.  As Tracy posted, the New Moon weekend continues tonight at
the Chateau (in Berkeley, call above # for directions)  The startup time 
has slipped back to ~10 PM, to give us sound-system haulers a chance to
recuperate a few hours.  Call the # though -- if we start sooner they've 
got a great clothing-optional pool to swim and dance in before it gets 
cold.  This should blend nicely into tomorrow's Sunset party at the 
Berkeley marina :)

Oh yeah, tentative DJ list (these are the ones who didn't get a chance 
to spin up at Pt. Reyes and are planning to come to the Chateau) --
Scottie, Whitsitt, Bryce, Dante, Kenneth Paul, Ronan, and of course 
some surprises (and maybe an encore performance by Bonnie, who had a 
_great_ public debut up at Pt. Reyes).

					hope to see y'all there,
					bring towels,
					peace,
					gregg

P.S. we're really sorry to anyone who got caught by our info line 
   glitch and arrived at Pt.Reyes after it was shut down.  We're 
   hoping to get _some_ form of compensation from our voice-mail
   provider...

I'm new to this list, so I'm not sure if anyone's talked of it yet, but did
anyone read a book called CYBERIA?  It has many mentions of S.F. and things
going on in the rave scene there.  

Cap'n Crunch, Jeno, Toon Town, Rose X... these are a few names in the book that
I recognized from discussions on SFRAVES.  I think the book attempted to be a
nonpartisan look into cyberculture and rave, but often I felt that it was a bit
limited in its scope, at least in its treatment of the rave scene.  I'm not
really familiar with rave in S.F. (i'm from L.A.) but I'd be interested in what
those from S.F. that have read it think.

Right on Tracy.  Bet that left a bad taste in your mouth having to speak up
like that but we're listening and we feel the positivity in your purpose.

We'll continue to support you and you'll meet us soon.

We've read it.  Info's old.  Good general overview but outdated in a big way.
 Our scene has grown alot and gone through many changes since the era he
wrote about.  

Only citing Toon Town as his example for ALL SF raves was kinda like
describing education through a first grader's eyes.  There was ALOT more that
could have been written, but maybe that's another book.

We record DJ's live at raves.  Greg does the recording and I do cover art for
tapes which we distribute for free to people local and long distance.  There
are strict karmic guidelines that we follow to keep
everyone happy (DJ's, promoters, $$$).  This is a non-profit thing that we
do.  We're not really ready to go mainstream, we do this for fun.  We get off
on sharing the music of our scene with people who might otherwise might not
get a taste.  We do offer taping services with negotiable terms (free).  

Peace,

Apparently, we're up.  At least SFRaves currently is.  Due to the fact
that Stanford needed to reclaim their machine, I have set up and installed
a new machine on the net called hyperreal.com.  All the stuff techno
was doing (mailing lists, web stuff) will now be here.  I'll send out a 
more formal announcement soon.  So from now on, use sfraves@hyperreal.com.
I apologize in advance if things are a little rocky, as this is a new 
machine and all :)

Wicked was Jeno,Garth,Pierre, and Markie. Pierre managed to play hard 
acid which was still "funky groovy" underneath the acid bleeps. It was 
Townsend on a Saturday Night which is always clubby yet fabulous. Wierdo 
ravers and drag queens, donovan visuals, smart bar, li'l chill space, 
line outside crowded dance floor, markie physically restrained security
from cutting of his record ....AND they turned it off with a scrAATch at
9:00am or so.  Courtney did more than anyone luv phaser set at broad sweep.
Geoff white between markie and security..you've seen it before...and it 
is still wonderful.

Had a great time!salutations, allen@ameba

First of all, i'd like to thank Bryce and Ethan and Laura and all for the 
Liquid Drano party. It was another arm-twist in my campaign to get my 
friend Hank (visiting from sh'kago) to move out here. He had a really 
good time for the week he was here. danke!

I personally would have rather gone to FreeFall, but the group we were 
with wanted to hit Wicked, so...We ended up getting there around 11:40 
hoping to get in before the price went up at midnight. I didn't really 
expect to succeed, but it sure seemed like the doorfolk were out to make 
sure it didn't happen. Carmen's backpack was dug, and I mean *dug* 
through for a full ten minutes while we had to wait on for her on the 
side. We rarely, if ever, have anything to hide, and if we did we 
wouldn't be so stupid as to put it in a backpack. They kindly 'offered' 
to hold her water bottle on the side so we could come up front and get it 
later, but of course it was gone. No big loss, but the manaical search 
through *every* container and pocket in her bag left her shaken for the 
next half-hour. That, and the passing of midnight in the middle of all 
this really pissed me off. Of course the misdirected search tactics 
completely missed one of the folks behind us who was certainly packing 
some...er...contraband. 

I can see it now: The Water-Bottle Riots of '94! Emotional crowd of 
brightly dressed San Franciscans storms doorpeople at club armed only 
with empty water-bottles and random pieces of fruit. Prisoners are 
dropped in front of a Coke machine in the middle of the desert with only 
a handful of bent Canadian coins and a well-worn and ripped one dollar bill.

Once inside, wicked was...well...the Townsend. Seemed just about the same 
as when we went for the CareFree/Wired deal two weeks earlier (note: CF 
charged $10 and allowed ins and outs, hint). The sound was louder, but 
certainly not better. Actually, let me rephrase that...THESE MOUNDS BUST 
POWDER, BUT SIR TINGLY NOT VETTE HAIR...WHAT?...FREEZE...HOUND...WAS... 
CHOWDER...WHAT?

THOUGH IT WAS NEVER <click> really totally enclosed, I do miss the little 
upstairs chill area they used to have there. Why is it closed off now?

For future reference, I suppose you can save this article and re-post it 
after each wicked (little 'w') that goes on at Townsend. After all, I 
really can't think of much that has changed since they started doing the 
big-club circuit. 

Maybe this is just more a reaction to the Townsend than wicked, but I 
fail to see how a party that gets rewound and replayed every other week 
or so is supposed to get anyone excited. I try not to have the 'been 
there - seen it - done it' attitude, but frankly three summers of this 
here and five more back in Detroit is about all I can take. When I first 
got here, I was taken by the creativity (or maybe the novelty) that 
Detroit had lost, but at the large-party scale it seemed to end with 1992.
One slide projected mandala or intellibeam or wailing diva thumper or 
brain blast drink or whatever seems pretty much like the other. I will at 
least credit the Basics/ComeUnity/Gathering/LFR hydra and wicked with 
being among the best purveyors of this model, but at least for me it's 
just become too formulaic.

One thing I've been wondering is why we need these frequent massives in 
the first place? Because we have to 'unite the world?' Hell, I have 
enough trouble keeping track of names, numbers and birthdays already much 
less actually keeping up friendships. I admit, i love seeing a couple 
thousand people together every once in a while, but in my experience and 
from reading many of the reviews posted here, the highlight of most 
evenings is when the crowd thins out to just a couple hundred and less. I 
rarely (if ever) see a massive with nearly everyone dancing or somehow 
interacting with the crowd as a whole. I have seen several smaller parties 
that have achieved this.

Oh, I don't know where this is going. I guess the massives do provide the 
function of spreading the 'rave' message further than the smaller and 
renegade parties do, but take a look at the message that is being sent. 
For $19.95, anyone can buy their way into a well-known, frequent, easily 
accessible party of consistent quality where you will be entertained in a 
consistent fashion for the regular amount of time until you tire of it. 
And all this for no more effort than sliding the twenty dollar bill over 
than counter. This method also sells a lot of laundry detergent, but I 
certainly wouldn't consider Tide (no matter how white my socks get) to be 
anything new, creative or revolutionary.

Eh, I'll shut up now. My week-long e-mail jones has been fed. john.

All walks of life?  How many of the jock-types, and country hicks at Let
Freedom Rave do you think actually joined the circle with a clear and happy
mind, thinking about unity?  And I don't really think that that many different
people go to raves.  Thjose that do, however, that are into the scene, are a
good bunch generally.

I think it would be more fair to just say "people who bring negativity
to the scene" rather than listing stereotypes. I know plenty of people
who are in these groups who aren't negative at all. Take our own Bob
Ramstad, who is a "frat boy", and who has donated an enormous amount
of time, labor, and positive energy to the scene. Or how about Devin
and Stacy, both "teeny-boppers", whom I met this weekend at the NMR.
They were so nice that people were remarking how much they liked them
long after they left.

I'm not so much into PCness as seeing that people like this don't feel
unwanted. And if they read posts stereotyping them in a negative way,
they're going to feel unwanted and unappreciated. Wouldn't that be
awful?

You know, I've never heard of anyone abusing MDMA in SanFran, not
once, even secondhand. I have personally seen people abuse themselves
with methylamphetamine and pot, and know of more than one person who
has abused heroin.

But E? Not that I know of. And I've seen plenty of it.

Sean

PS - I define "abusing oneself" to be when the net effect in someone's
life is substantially negative. Substantially meaning things like: you
blow off things in your life which pile up. You get depressed. You
spend all your money on drugs. You screw up a good relationship. Etc.

I've seen people take too much E - defining "too much" as often enough
to not get nearly as much benefit each time as if they spaced it out
more, and also to the point where they couldn't enjoy themselves unless
they were altered.  That's abuse, in my mind.

Yup, that pretty much described them.  This is very rare, though, I
should point out, as most people when they start going down that path
do get negative feedback, like the opposite of cocaine.  But to say
it never happens isn't strictly true.

But compared to cocaine, cigarrette, alcohol, or even chocolate, E's
pretty benign.

well, a FOAF was an abuser of E, and exhibited all of the effects and
"classic" symptoms of addiction, and many more.  it *is* possible
to be ill-affected and overuse the substance.  Caveat emptor. Fortunately,
said FOAF is doing well now, and talks to anyone who will listen about
the experience.

i have to disagree here...but only in the matter of degree.  the FOAF i
mentioned in a prior post was left with no job, was homeless, had no
money, and was left with one friend who would help them.  it took this
person over a year to pull themselves out of the hole.  i remember 
conversations with this person where they would be hiding themselves in
a basement they were so paranoid about being "overheard" by roommates.
it's true they didn't have their nasal passages destroyed, nor die of
lung cancer, nor kill anyone driving while intoxicated...a few people
intervened ~before~ it got to that point.  let's make sure that no one
finds out what the long term effects of abuse are.

While MDMA has less potential for abuse and "destroying
people's lives" than methamphetamines do, such potential
*is* realized and I have on several occasions encountered
it in friends and acquaintances over the years.  To really
consider this subject seriously, look into Bruce Eisner's
text on Ecstasy, it's the standard in the field, either the
first or sefdond edition (Saunders' book is interesting, but
it tends to be rambly and long on interesting narratives
rether than based on as much useful info).

To cite just two areas:  people who, liking the E experience,
attempt to "stay there" by continuing to take E regularly 
have burned themselves out physically and psychologically,
needing extended periods for recuperation.  The most intense
E trippers I know have had to take extended times for re-
integrating themselves in their relationships, day-to-day 
lives, healtthy routines, etc., and for a few that I have
know over a 15 year period their E use *may* have been a 
factor in their suicide.  For others who have not integrated
the E experience it remains something that they do not bring
into their everyday life so there is more spiritual and/or
emotional disharmony in their interactions with others; these
are the folks that are groovy on E and more edgy, nervy or
even less capable of intimacy than they were before when they're
not on E.

Again, my experience over a 15 year period has been much like thos
in Adamson's (Metzner's) Gateway to the Heart book about MDMA:
that for the vast majority of E-takers it was a path, trail,
or autobahn lane to heart chakra interconnects--and I remAIN CON-
vinced that that is what it is for most ecstasy seekers.

Tahnk you, Mark and Sean, for opening up this important thread,
because I know that communication about our sacred and party
substances is important in the context of use and abuse of them
as tools of consciousness!

Ciao,
Will

Hi Brian and others--

Well, I said my bit about E in the post I just
sent to sfr, and while I agree with most of whAT
I've seen (including your sage comments Brian B.),
I must take issue with:

>But compared to cocaine, cigarrette, alcohol, or even chocolate, E's
pretty benign.

As an Italian American who has had alcohol (wine) all
of my life since birth and a kid growing up with cocoa
products, even the universe of statistics does not tell
me that these substances are more harmful if a similar-
ly large population were exposed to E.  I think that
comparisons are frequently judgments that we have no
need or ability to raise.  Let me give a real virulent
example: heroin-using former students of mine have frequently
used the old "you have your drug, I have mine" approach
when conversing about their addiction.  That's, as Uncle
Bill Burroughs puts it (I guess I think of him as the 
consummate authority in this realm) junk talk pure and 
simple!  Comparisons and judgments too often lead us into
circular arguments, finger-pointing and enabling rather
than empowering. So : )  !!!

Ciao,
Will

(we all know how I feel about 24th & Illinois being debauched :( )

We need to make this the jump-off point for finding a TAZ, I guess. I 
repeatedly hear of folks being interested in doing this sort of thing on 
a weekly basis, and then they just seem to go away (YSH sez "Grrrrr...!!)

Does anyone else have folks mention that they would like to be involved 
in having parties, only to sort of drift away and out of touch?  

I think that when someone exhibits interest in having their space be a 
possible happening-place, we ought to double-team them in a really nice 
way. A couple of us could call them and go visit, and then maybe a couple 
of other folks, etc.-- maybe we could keep them interested long enough 
to overcome initial doubts. Also, that way no one need spend all their 
time courting a potential ally, with no help from the rest of us.

Does this sound helpful, or is it just one more been-there done-that?

Thanx

Maui :)

I agree. It was AWESOME! Thank you to everyone who organized, spun,
and showed up. Thanks for a great initiation into the rave! My brother
and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fire was an unreal touch. What a way to
usher in the 4th.

You mean there isn't always some intense jammin' beat? I really dug
letting my inhibitions go and let the music take over. I've been
infused with a slightly above subconscious manic mood since Sunday
morning. What a great feeling. Everyone was super-cool and it was
a good, friendly atmosphere. Can't wait till the next one I can attend.

> OR I could just calm down.  ok thanks SFRaves.
(don't do it.)
Love the rave. Looks like a lifestyle change is in order.

  I wasn't actually planning to go raving this weekend, but when I saw 
someone post for "Remembrance" in Santa Cruz, I just had to go.  So I 
gathered up some friends and we made the hour drive to Davenport around 
11pm.  When we got to the site, Greyhound Rock, there were a TON of 
cars... Unfortunatley, there was no music! It was just in the process of 
being busted :(  I was realy disapointed since I wanted to hear Spun, 
Wool and Harry Who spin.  

  As if the party getting busted was bad enough...  They NEVER updated 
the info line giving a new location or appologies for the bust.  I can 
understand when the promoters can't get to a phone, but come on, it's 
simply rude not to change the message.

  So we drove around the Santa Cruz mountains till about 3am when we 
saw a decent amount of cars at Bonny Doon.  There were about 80 people 
there, drinking beer, and hardly any of them were dancing.  The people 
were friendly, but the vibe was non-existant.  Plus, the music was all 
about a year old and the DJ couldn't match beats at ALL! 

  I have respect for the DJ because it was his sound system and he 
organized everything and as far as I know was the only DJ for the whole 
night.  So basicaly he was just throwing a party to do some 
self-promotion and get some practice spinning live.  Which is fine, but 
it would be nice to get some GOOD DJ's to go on afterwards.

  Anyways... I expected more because the last time I went to an outdoor 
party in SC it was AWESOME!  But this time things didnt work out, and now 
I'm getting sick to top things off...  ::sigh::

  On a positive note: I hope you all come out to the next Liquid Air 
party this Saturday...  As far as I know, its still happening, so bring 
your friends, your smiles, your warm clothes and some telescopes so we 
can all check out the comet colliding with Jupiter!! ;)

Peace out...

-Ernie

Hi Folx--

I'm sorry that Ernie who came down for Remembrance
unfortunately did not stay connected to the folx
when Remembrance reconvened after being busted by
the CHP at Greyhound Rock. We stayed and found the
*real* party again!

It was a truly awesome (if somewhat dusty) small
party with the best djing I've *ever* heard Wool
do (especially the work before the generator needed   
regeneration)! The combined energy of those who were
there from the San Jose and the Santa Cruz families
made for a powerful dance vibe for us kicking up 
the dust (somewhat like the arena at Golden Gate
Park).  Imagine  a sacred glen near an abandoned barn 
and farmhouse of the turn of the century, the trees
holding back the wisps of fog, the hills on the 
inland side of highway one echoing the rhythms,
Santa Cruz and San Jose (and a few City folk) homies
dancing together, communing on blankets around small
lamplights, gathering and munching blackberries between
sets in the early a.m. light and you have this picture.

As summer progresses, let's have more of these parties 
at such sites; our ancestors knew many of them, we're just
re-discovering them!

Peace and love,
Will

I can't believe that this is even an issue.  If I'm spinning or have
a tape available, you bet I'll post it here.

And I hope the same applies for all of us, whether we're talking about
playing, promoting or just attending.

Yeah, I figured it would be. We went to the one up there a few months ago 
and it was very nice. Carmen and Hank and I were up in Marin that night, 
but Carmen had to be awake and functioning the next morning in Santa 
Cruz. We had to pass on it this month. See you there next time though.

> Tinnitus: no

eh?

Don't think my previous criticism included these smaller events. It's not 
really directed at the big events either. The target was the formula that 
has evolved and has been choking the life out of many events here and 
that seems to go completely counter to the lip service of 'change and 
growth.' I also want to keep the scene alive, but not if it means 
a future of unending, expensive and degrading life-support.

Thankfully, other events and people have been appearing to provide 
something other than the meat-and-potatoes. But I hope that they too will 
be aware of the trap of stagnation. A new formula is just as bad as the 
old one. 

I guess as Markie said, I could do it myself, and back in Detroit, I 
already have. While I have great stories and memories from each event, 
being a promoter isn't really my calling, so to speak. It's hard 
work and I tip my hat to anyone who tries to do it, but I need my energy 
and time for other things. If I can someday find a way to tie my outlet 
into these smaller events, I will, but for now I have to remain just an 
attendee. sigh.

I read the book and thought it was a disappointing mishmash of half-
understood "scene vignettes" and personality pieces.  Mark Heley is
about the only one who comes off half-decently.  Don't get me wron,
the book has a lot of interesting comments but I didn't find it 
very insightful.

Tinnitus is what happens when the sound is WAY TOO LOUD and you don't
a handy pair of 24+ db reduction earplugs to make everything sound
nice and muffled. The next day or three one's ears ring. It is a sign
of hearing damage.

Try this test: Don't go to an event for three weeks. Find an ultra
quiet environment and listen. Do your ears ring? Permanent hearing
damage.

What a lot of promoters haven't figured out is: louder isn't better.
Louder sounds like shit, reverberates too much indoors, and causes the
smarter participants to wear earplugs, which means it sounds even
shittier.

What I'd like to see them do at big events is:

      Raise the high speakers above the crowd (and point them down) so
      that speaker-worshipers don't block the sound. Treble beams out
      narrowly; it won't go around someone standing in front of a bin.
      (Try it.) All that money you spent on the mid-high bins is
      actually spent on the few people standing in front of the
      speakers.

      Remove at least 1/2 of the sound system. SHREDDER 60,000 WATTS.
      You walk in and it sounds like you're standing between two train
      locomotives at full throttle. The pattern recognition in your
      brain goes into overdrive trying to find a beat in the clipped
      off waveforms and the multiple bass echoes and fails. You've
      been mugg^H^H^H^Hshredded.

      Use a limiter and set it so that the amps don't clip and the
      volume is below earplug level.

The first one is a little hard. You gotta stack the bass bins and
stack a mid-high on top. Might even need a sandbag or something to aim
it down.

The second will probably save anywhere from $500 to $2000.

A good stereo compressor/limiter is about $500.

And the whole thing would sound better. You'd be getting reviews like:
"It sounded really good!" and "I met God." And you could smile about
it later knowing no one's hearing was damaged. :)

 It's got a name now: "RADIO! RADIO!"

 The SFR Picnic in Sunnyvale Baylands Park , afternoon of Sat. ,Aug. 20th 

  I just finished building and testing a Ramsey FM-10A micro stereo FM
 transmitter , and it seems to work pretty darn good for the size and
 price. I'm going to test it out at the site tomorrow , after work.
 What I'm mostly concerned with is the range and clarity. I think I've
 found a frequency that's rarely used ( 96.1 ) , we'll see in the park.

  I hope everybody has portable personal FM receivers that they can bring 
 and dance with. What a sight it'll be !

This is a bit of an overstatement. I'd say "street quality" E, if indeed
MDMA, is more around 100mg. He seems to be arguing that doing a couple of
E's is the same as doing speed, and that people started doing it for that
reason. First of all, while high doses do increase amphetamine-like side
effects (teeth grinding, etc.), they don't obviate the entactogenic effect;
and I think 150mg is a bit to low of a dose to cause serious amphetamine
like side effects. Secondly, who would waste $40 or more on E if they
really wanted speed, which is much cheaper and more widely available?

I have seen E abuse, but what I've seen is a different pattern than
amphetamine abuse. I've rarely seen anyone doing it as frequently and with
increasing dosage as I've seen people do with speed. Rather, I see people
start relying on it to free them from insecurities and to make them more
open. Instead of using the experience as an example of how change sober
behavior it becomes a crutch. I've even known people in relationships where
"when we're on E I love her, but when we're not I can't stand her."

What I find rather scary is the use I've seen around some colleges - it
almost seems like it sometimes replaces alcohol as a "pick-up" drug.

My opinion is that an increase in speed use ocurred (among other factors)
because of a lack of quality E, its relative low cost, and a tendancy among
users to look for peer support by getting their friends to do it as well.

As far as effects on the scene, speed is a big ego-inflating I-me drug,
where as much of what is good about this scene is the we-us atmosphere...

Or can achieve positive effects in their lives despite speed use.

No, it doesn't necessarily turn people into paranoid, aggressive,
spaced-out tweakers, but I've seen personalities change in that direction
quite a bit more than I've seen anyone giving it credit for making their
lives better.

it was a thriller, folks.  people standing on the side of the road, 
biting their fingernails, literally glued to their watches.  would the 
party be able to go off before the sun came up?  it was a race against 
time.  suddenly, the music started.  then stopped.  then started.  then 
stopped.  then stopped, oops, i mean started again.  ?

the music it was fun.  the first dj spun a fun set.  but where was spun?  
i looked all over the place for him.  i looked in the old abandoned house 
for him.  i asked all over the place for him.  i began to get a complex 
about myself.  did he have prior engagements, or was he simply not at the 
party to avoid my presence?  

it all worked out in the end, though.  everyone parked their cars in the 
eucalyptus trees and danced.  someone told me wool was spinning.  

anyway, all in all, i had fun.  when i left, i drove through the crowd to 
get back on the freeway, since that was the only way i could go.  it was 
embarrassing, since i felt like i was a party pooper, but it did help 
make my experience at remembrance into a plural and process-oriented noun!

	The only events I have been to where the sound was not damaging
	have been SFRave events. I find that almost 100% of all concerts
	and rave type events I have ever been to have poorly run overly loud
	sound. The sound "engineers" at these shows are probably long gone
	for concert deafness and couldn't effectively set up and run
	sound anyways.

	If you *always* wear 24db+ earplugs then you will find that your
	mind adjusts to this level of volume reduction and that the sound
	is *great*. Its just like your eyes adjusting to dim light in a room.
	You will be able to pick out the components of the sound and enjoy
	it much more if you have earplugs on.

	For those of you who *never* wear earplugs- it will take you several
	sessions to get used to the reduced level and have your mind adjust
	but it is worth it.

	Anyone who doesn't wear earplugs at events *does* have hearing
	damage and it *will* get worse throughout your life. If you get
	tinnitus (ringing) you will be in tremendous agony and it is
	*incurable*.

	Wear earplugs.

Not since Spacelab have I enjoyed a weekly as much as SPAZ. Its in a 
cool place, its $3.00, the people are always smiling, the decorations are great
and the sound is tolerable. 

I highly suggest that everyone come out and support SPAZ. They really have
the right idea- its parties like this that keep a city's scene thriving.

Ethan was awesome. The sound system was set up in a *circle* in the middle
of the dance floor. An awesome idea.

hey g n c,

what did you think of wicked, assuming you showed up. i was very
disappointed. the crowd was totally not the one i am used to. i kept
trying to convince my friends to go to the new moon thing in 
berkeley, which i had read about and morgan said he was going
to hit when i saw him there. i actually came home at about
4:oo and listened to a simon tape i have...that was good music.
i think garth has lost it or something. and the crowd...seemed like
a bunch of raver wannabe's. very strange. i am curious to know
what you guys thought/did. looked for you for a while, then figured
you weren't there.

am seeing this as a sign that it is time to give the scene a good
long break. if you are online and see any discussion of the event,
please forward it to me. it seemed like i saw quite a few other folks
like me wondering "what the hell is going on here...this isn't wicked
in any way".

        It usually hasn't been a problem for me at outdoor events, I just
        don't get that close to the speakers.  Indoors, I use earplugs.

        The larger outdoor concerts rarely get that loud, the neighboring
        communities won't let them  (Shoreline, for example).

        Where do you get earplugs that block sound evenly over the frequency
        range?  All the ones I know of block lows a little, midrange a bit
        more, and highs totally.  If all you listen for is the booming beat,
        you won't miss anything with earplugs, especially since you really
        feel that more than hear it, but if you actually want to hear the
        highs, you need to find a place where the music isn't so loud that
        you need them.

Yes, wear earplugs at least some of the night. I still like to take them out
from time to time because there is no substitute for LOUD - I need a little
brain SHREDDing.  The important thing is quiet or quieter rest periods in
between blasts.  I recognize a lot more songs with the plugs in, but I kinda
like not recognizing whts being spun if you know what I mean.

I have it.  It sucks.  Don't get it.  Please.

...and I've been wearing earplugs since I was about 19.

Besides, earplugs don't cut out the body-shaking BOOM BOOM BOOM of the bass,
just that ear-roasting sizzle of overdriven mixers or 808 hi-hats treble-
boosted by producers who can't hear either because their ears are roasted too.

PS: Even worse than raves are rock/punk/guitar shows -- guitar distortion
is in the perfect range to munch your cochlea triple-quick.  If you're
*lucky* you'll just end up half-deaf, unable to hear any treble at all
so you can't make out consonants when people talk.

PPS: There is absoultely no known cure.  Read this again -- THERE IS 
ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWN CURE.  Stays with you to the grave, and gets worse
as you age.  I got wise before it got too bad, but there is no such thing
as silence for me anymore.

to amplify the recent warnings from others:  yes, the sound is loud enough at  
most events to cause permanent hearing loss from just being there.  speaker  
tweekers are at much greater risk.  protection is a MUST.

in addition to handing out blow pops and fruit, how about handing out earplugs,  
especially at those events where the sound is certainly above the damage  
threshhold?

some notes:

- one source of inexpensive, disposable earplugs is Lab Safety Supply, 800  
356-0783.  most brands are fifteen to twenty cents per pair in quantity of 200  
pair.  my favorite type (so far) is "Flents Quiet! please Foam Earplugs".  Lab  
Safety also sells a little "Foam Earplug Sampler" kit for $8.00.

- yes, foam earplugs are pretty nonlinear in their attenuation.  i find that if  
i insert them only a little way into the ear canal (maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of the  
intended depth) the attenuation is still sufficient for rave use and it is more  
linear (the highs are not so terribly muted).  before use the plugs can be  
trimmed down in length a bit with a serrated knife so they don't stick out so  
far.

- psychedelics can be analgesic.  a speaker tweeker who ordinarly would feel  
pain might not feel discomfort at all while dosed.  



following is some text from the MDMA Frequently Asked Questions document.  it  
could well be extended to include hearing loss at concerts or raves as a result  
of 1) not feeling pain and 2) not remembering or caring about the possibility  
of hearing loss.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behavioral Safety Concerns
--------------------------
     As noted, a primary psychological effect of MDMA is to make the user feel  
"safe", at peace with the world, pleasantly reconciled to things as they are,  
and things however they will be.  This can remarkably diminish one's ability to  
make sound judgements during the session.   Examples:

- It becomes easy to want to prolong the MDMA state by taking more and more of  
the drug (or of other drugs), beyond what you would judge wise or worthwhile  
when not under its influence.

- It becomes easier to have unsafe sex.  You may "forget," judge that the risk  
of infection is very small, or feel that infection wouldn't be such a terrible  
thing after all.  If you think you might have sex while on MDMA, it may help  
you and your partner to stay safe if you lay out safer sex supplies before  
dosing in a place you'll be sure to see them later, and agree beforehand that  
you'll use them if the occasion arises.

     Another danger stems from MDMA's lessening of the awareness of pain  
(whether through chemical analgesia, or through psychological analgesia).   
Combined with the extra energy the drug gives, it becomes easy to sustain  
bruises, blisters, or other bodily damage from extensive dancing, hiking,  
climbing, etc., without noticing it until after the damage is done.

     Under MDMA, it may seem "right" to make immediate changes in relationships  
(increasing or decreasing commitment) of all kinds.  The fresh points of view  
appreciated during an MDMA session are one of the drug's most prized benefits,  
but it is probably unwise to actually make lasting relationship changes until  
you have a chance to see how you would feel about them after the drug and its  
afterglow wear off.  - rnj

Including addiction to extacy.

Ive had freinds get so burnt out that they couldnt
fight off even a little cold.  they got wierd 
rashes, they were always depressed, except when 
they were on the drug.
They'd say "I need a break I shouldnt do this so much"
but by the next weekend, they did it anyway.

And isnt it funny how some relationships dont make it
when people take a break from doing the drug.
Ive seen that happen a few times...

Interesting....
A lot of people also think that you cant be addicted to pot.

dont you think?

Thanks, Robert Jesse, for the practical and wise comments
about *both* hearing loss and MDMA abuse. I hope people
who are interested in the latter read your post as well,
since I think it's the most thought-provoking one we've
had this particular go-around!

As ever,
Will

	A terrible thing to come out of .lurk mde for, but I feel the need
to emphatically reiterate what several others have said before.  PLEASE
WEAR EARPLUGS!  "Taking a break" from ear-damaging volumes is not enough.  
Nothing can describe the feeling of knowing you will never be able to hear 
silence again.

Hmmmm I've tried and tried but it just doesn't work well for me. It
sounds like...well...like music through earplugs :(. When I have the
plugs in, about the only place that sounds good is right in front of
the stack.

The cool thing is, some people realize that it can be loud enough (!)
without being at earplug levels. I luuuuv the sound at those parties. :)

Any SPAZers on here? If so, any chance of getting an 18+ space? Hey if
you can we'll pack a car full of people in Sac and Davis and drive
down and jam at your party. I'll even bring cool stuff like black
lights, fans, toys, etc.  :)

I didn't start wearing earplugs until my ears started ringing. Only
then did I look it up and found it was (surprise) permanent.

In my case the ringing isn't noticeable unless it's exceptionally
quiet, or if I wear earplugs when it's not loud. Kinda ironic. Funny
thing is, I can still hear the 14kHz+ whine of some CRTs. Oh well :).

Subject: Linear Noise Reduction?

I have tried earplugs, but the non-linearity of them makes it sound like
someone turned off the main speakers, leaving just the subs on.

A friend I once knew (who was a musician) had custom, form-fitted
earplugs made.  Does anyone know if these provide more linear noise
reduction?  This discussion of hearing loss has me scared.

(custom earplugs cost 100.00, a small price to pay for hearing, I guess)

The worst I ever saw was at one my earliest raves, at the Sound
Factory. There was this extremely tweaked woman with her head almost
completely inside a 24"x12" horn-loaded mid-tweeter with a giant
magnet on the back. No earplugs. The sound pressure level 6 feet away
was on the verge of pain (you know, when sound is so extremely loud is
causes the insides of your ears to tickle/hurt) . God knows what she
was feeling. I was too freaked to do anything about it.

Nowdays, I think I'd try and distract her, and if that failed, I'd get
help. We've got to take care of each other.

I guess the part of me that likes to get up and soapbox got the upper

I can't tell you all enough how happy i am that this discussion is 
taking place.  As a sound person, the single most frequent comment 
and request i receive when working with the equipment is: "Can you
make it any louder?"  It's really quite a difficult issue for me, in
a way, because i want to give people what they want.  However, i like
my hearing, and am exposed to much higher SPLs for longer periods of
time than almost anyone else in the rave "scene", so i almost always
answer "NO".

i have seen many a DJ who turns everything up to distortion levels
(and beyond), and still wants it turned up, up, up, and up, because
they are (whether they know it or not) deaf.  i have warned folks
here before about permanent hearing loss.  What most folks don't
realize is that most of damaging sound energy comes from the mids and
the highs...having a flat frequency response curve on the sound
system produces deafening levels in the mids and especially the highs.
This is because the smaller the speaker, the more efficient they are
(the magnets move smaller distances, and are smaller, so the same
amount of electrical energy produces higher SPLs at higher frequencies).
If sound people put most of the system's energy into the bass bins,
and EQ'd their systems properly (and listened to them), there'd be
far less problems with "too much sound".  it's also a square law kind
of thing...twice the energy can produce 4 times the SPL.

it is precisely this problem of improperly tuned and monitored systems
that causes most of my problems when listening to the so-called wailing
diva school of house music.  an improperly tuned system reinforces the
mids and highs far too much.  since the sound of the human voice, 
especially alto and soprano voices falls mostly in the 1KHz-5KHz range,
when these are reinforced by an improperly tuned sound system, the
"diva's" voice reaches 6-12dB over the rest of the system, which goes
from being a sound on the edge of painfully loud to well beyond that
level...and my ears feel it.  i *like* hearing the human voice on
sound systems, but if every time it's played on a big system, my ears
lose a little more hearing, and hurt me, i develop an aversion reaction
to the sound.

as a representative of both Sound Vision and Metro Vision, i'd like to
take this opportunity to tell you all that if you're at an event where
we are doing the sound (ethan or i), and the sound is too loud for you,
or in some way unpleasant, *please* let us know immediately, and we'll
take care of it.  we love our hearing, and we love yours.  we'd like
to be offering sound services for a long time, and we'd like to preserve
ours and your hearing.  we take this stuff very seriously.  also, if you
do events, and want advice or counsel on proper setup and tuning of the
system you are using, please feel free to contact us...we want to make
sure the community at large retains the ears by which we hear each other's
unique voices.

	Okay a number of common things have been said about earplugs:

	1) Wearing earplugs doesn't sound good. The sound is muffled and
	   and I just don't get that *loud* feeling.

	The mind and ear are a trainable duo. If you *always* wear earplugs
	and you *pay attention* to the music you listen to then your senses
	will adjust to the shift in EQ and *compensate* and it will sound
	just fine. The only exception to this rule is if you are so deaf
	already that all of the relevant damagable frequency reception 
	in your ears is gone- then earplugs will do nothing for you unless
	you are at an event with damaging sound in different frequencies-
	like a missile launch or an SRL show or an atomic blast.

	2) I like to take off my earplugs once in a while because I want
	   that *loud* sensation.

	See #1. If you take them off then you lose the tuning your brain
	has been working on to adjust to the EQ.

	3) Which frequences to earplugs really knock out? How many dbspl
	   do they remove?

	dbspl = decibels sound pressure level. I prefer the generic
	flourescent green thrify earplugs. These are made by the Super301
	company in the South Bay. They take down *30dbspl* of sound. There
	is no concert you can attend that has sound loud enough to damage
	your hearing if you have 30db earplugs in. 

	They knock out mostly high and mid frequences. The bass shines
	through and of course you body feels it. Again your mind WILL
	compensate for the EQ shift if you *listen*. IF YOU *LISTEN*!!!!!

	4) I'm a DJ and I can't mix with earplugs in.

	If you truly consider yourself an artist you will make sure you
	have the right tool for the job: good ears. Learn do deal with 
	earplugs. Don't be a Pete Townshend and suffer for 50% of your
	life in great pain every time you hear music. 

	If any of you have any questions that need more exact frequency
	measurements- I can provide them.

	Oh and you can substitute the word "condom" for "earplug" and
	reread the whole schpiel and its still valid.

You get used to it after about two events, in my experience.  I play drums
and all amplified musical instruments with them in, and don't like the
sound without them now.

There are many kinds of custom earplugs.  The ones I had were designed to
block as much noise as possible and damn the linearity.  They did about
35 dB, I think.

One model I recall was nearly linear but only provided about 10 dB of
reduction.  For speaker-tweeking, this will not be enough.  For most
other situations, if you don't already have ear damage, it might be, but
I wouldn't risk it.

Keep in mind that no earplug can block bass: the sound waves are simply
too long, and much of the perception is physical anyway.  The more
protection you get, the more bassy the sound gets.

> (custom earplugs cost 100.00, a small price to pay for hearing, I guess)

Custom earplugs don't block much more noise much better than store-bought
ones.  The best kind are the standard E.A.R. yellow or beige foam ones,
which will knock off 30 dB if used properly.  There exists a brand of blaze-
orange foam ones with the advantage of having a slick and non-icky surface
but I don't remember the brand name and they're more expensive.  E.A.R. were
about 29c a pair at the Payless last I checked.

Of course, the custom fit more nicely and don't itch after prolonged use.

Handy Hint:  If you forget earplugs, go to the bathroom and get either
two squares of micro-thin institutional TP or one square of normal TP.
Fold it over itself until you get about a 2/3 inch on a side square.
Saturate it with water (under the tap), and push it over the opening of
your ear canal so it forms a vacuum seal -- don't shove it way into your ear
canal.

This will get you as much protection (if done properly) as any earplug,
at the cost of feeling somewhat gooshy and tending to dry and pop out every
hour or so.  Way better than tinnitus, tho.

I don't know. How many "jock-types, and country hicks at Let Freedom Rave 
do you think actually joined the circle with a clear and happy mind, 
thinking about unity?"  Hopefully, all of them.  However, that question 
is one without an answer for me, since there is no one definition of a 
"jock-type" or a "hick".  Certainly there are many people that could fit 
the description by sight, but I don't judge people by the way they look, 
so I could care less about that.  As for whether everyone joined the 
circle thinking about unity and with a clear and happy mind, I can't 
answer that one unless everyone that was in the circle took part in a 
poll that asked "were you thinking about cultural unity and happiness 
when you joined in the circle at Let Freedom Rave on the 2nd-3rd of 
july."  And I don't care, either.  Hopefully people that aren't thinking 
of it will.  If not, as long as they don't interfere with other peoples 
right to dance in peace, let them do what they want.

Some words of wisdom here.  I for one don't like going deaf.  I have been 
to some parties where the sound was just too loud.  I can't think of the 
ones offhand right now, but in recent memory, Mother Earth/Vivid in Santa 
Cruz had excellent sound for the system they had.  And I was really 
impressed with the sound at Let Freedom Rave.  The sound was crisp and 
clear, and not too loud, even though I was standing pretty darn close to 
them.  Definitely more volume isn't necessarily better.

Be careful, however, about sticking it in too far.  otherwise you will 
end up at the doctors office like i did saying "well, i kinda stuck it in

I use earplugs I purchased at a sporting goods store.  They are metal 
cylinders held in a latex insert.  They don't stop much sound until there 
is a sudden change in sound level.  So you can still hear fine and you 
get some protection ( though probably not as much as foam).  I have been 
using them for around ten years and have had good results.  My ears don't 
ring after a concert.  (I don't wear them for raves, because I can 
usually find a safe spot, whereas at someplace like the Kennel Club, 
there's no escape from noise).  They're less than ten bucks.  I've only 
had to buy 2 pairs so far (got to buy another one, lost my last pair :-().
They were recommended to me by a musician, but I d on't know if they're 
FDA approved for rave hearing protection ;-).  They are better at 
stopping sudden noises such as you might find at rock concert than the 
constantly loud levels heard at raves, but the fact that they 
don't muffle the sound and are comfortable makes them tops in my book.
I don't know the brand name, we used to call them Sonic earplugs but they 
had a different name on my second pair.
(Longwinded, rambling hearing story follows)
For many years, I used to be able to close my ears.  This was a blessing, 
because I was able to sleep no matter what the ambient noise level was. 
By placing my head in a certain position, my ears would close, and I 
could sleep.  One day, I was suddenly attacked by dizzy spells.  This 
disturbed me considerably, because I had not experienced this before, and 
I had no other symptoms of illness.  It did have the benefit of occuring 
when I tilted my head a certain way, creating a cheap thrill rush.  So I 
went to the doctor and told him how when I turn my head a certain way 
everything starts spinning around and around and around.  He said don't 
tilt your head that way. (rimshot).  But seriously folks, he wanted to 
look in my ears.  He tried but couldn't. Totally clogged with years of 
goo!  He asked me if I ever had my ears cleaned, I said no.  I didn't 
know this is something you had to do regularly, maybe I don't watch 
enough TV commercials.  So he stuck a squirt gun thing in my ear and 
whoosh! out came tons of gunk.  He told me that the dizziness was probably 
caused by an allergic reaction to dust.  I think it was caused by a rave 
I went to the previous weekend.  It was a Vision in a very dusty Livermore 
warehouse (hack hack thanks, Martin...).  I got over the dizziness, 
but my whole perception of sound changed.  Now I could hear sounds that I 
hadn't for years, like those great 909 hi-hats!  And birds tweeting!  It 
was amazing.  I used to be totally into the bass because it was all I 
could hear.  But my hearing was much more sensitive now.  Unfortunately, 
it robbed me of sleep but eventually I adjusted.  I wish I could still 
close my ears though.  The moral of the story is, well there's none I 
suppose.  OK, how about get your ears cleaned  out, you may be suprised 
at the difference.  And oh yeah, wear earplugs, 'cause hearing is great.

 Someone finally mentioned my favorite style of ear protection - wet
paper tissue:

  The way I shape the wet tissue varies from JITF's method in that I 
 make it an oblong shape instead of square. I insert them into my ears 
 such that the main body of the tissue rolls lie in the curve just 
 outside my ear canal . Then , I adjust the amount of insertion into the
 ear canal to tailor the degree of attenuation. The part of the roll
 that is outside the canal acts as an anchor to keep the earplugs from 
 flying out , and also act as handles to make removal easier.

  If no institutional TP is available , regular TP works good , as does 
 cocktail napkins - just get 'em wet!

  If you have trouble getting used to the mid/treble attenuation of 
 commercial earplugs , you might give wet tissue a try. It's my preference,
 after trying the foam ones and the expensive latex/metal ones ( HOWEVER,
 if the sound system is godawfully LOUD , the latex/metal ones are the 
 best - keeps a better portion of the high end than the foam ones or the
 earplugs that look like silicon putty. ).

 As an offshoot of the hearing protection thread -

 About once every 4 or 6 months , I'll be sitting around , not doing
much , when a weird little thing happens to my hearing. The hearing in 
one of my ears will cut out , and something that sounds like a pure
sinusoidal tone rings delicately in that ear for about 4 seconds . Then
my regular hearing returns as the "test tone" fades away.

 I've had this since I was a teen ( correlation to my first rock
concert experiences? ). I've heard of way worst cases of tintinnitus ,
some poor folks hear tones and whistles all the time - so I'm not
complaining. I'm just wondering if it's happened to anyone else.

 It's the weirdess thing - as if some technician somewhere to doing the
remote biannual check on my sound sensors! << "the gov't put a circuit
in my head" >>.

( I posted this to alt.rave last week )


 There's a comic book artist who's work I've been collecting over
the years named Matt Howarth. Not only do I like his style and 
imagination , but he often has personal music reviews at the end of
some of his comics. Since his tastes run similar to mine ( pre-new age 
space/synth music , some industrial , some avant-garde misc. stuff , and
more recently techno ) , I've always enjoyed reading his reviews. 

 Matt Howarth has also incorporated "real-life" musicians as characters
in his stories. The list includes This Heat , Nash The Slash , Conrad
Schnitzler,and Dave Brock & Hawkwind. Which practice leads to the tie-in
with this newsgroup.

 Coming in Sept. , one of Matt Howarth's comics , "Savage Henry", issue #2 , 
from Iconografix Comics , will have Moby as a "guest". Here's the plot 
synopsis from a recent comics catalog:

 *Savage Henry meets techno rave musician "Moby" as they share a dream of
of highly amusing proportions in "Going Interactive." They go fishing, 
ride dinosaurs, sit on the beach as melting ice cream cones, talk with
penguins, go flying, play detective and spy catcher - and then realize
that they are prisoners of their own shared dream! A mysterious presence 
wants them to have fun, wear hats, and not ask questions.*

 I thought some of you folks might want to know ...

	Well,

	  I guess I was at a completely different wicked than everyone
	else this weekend.  Although I do agree the $15 entrance fee
	to be quite high, I had an enormously great time.  I arrived
	inside after being searched by the entrance nazis.  They
	confiscated all of the fruit and water that me and my friends
	brought.  Major downer, but since this was a once in a 3 month
	outing for me I decided to not let the night rest on one thing.
	I had reservations about going to Townsend for a Wicked, I
	usually do not enjoy that venue because of its sound quality
	and I usually overheat easily in there.  But on this particular
	evening staying cool after dancing for several hours was no
	problem.  The sound system was ok, but not spectacular.  I
	was wearing my my favorite sunflower shirt and boots and brought
	along my favorite toy (flashing bike light).  My toy as usual
	got lots of attention and allowed me to meet lots of new
	smiling faces.

	  In all I had a terrific evening and if I never go to a
	rave again this was a good one to end raving on.  I do not
	know what you all are crying about.  You only get out of
	a rave what you put in, I guess I put in tons and got out
	tons.  Those of you who did not enjoy yourself need to
	put something into this scene instead of complaining about
	it or it will just die.  Keep in mind I am a 29 yr old
	professional and my 20 odd friends range in age from 23
	to 33 from all walks of life and we all just had a fabulous
	time.

	Keep the peace & safe journey,

	Ron.

Yes. This happens to me every now and again. Did you hit your head as
a child (wild guess)? Maybe it's your ear-bones finding a nice 
natural harmonic with your surroundings for awhile.

as a veteran of the LA metal scene (Troubador back in '86 or so), i can
  attest to the benefits of earplugz, tho, i've heard one interesting
    theory about ear damage:

  if you are CONSTANTLY exposed to loud sounds (at least once per 24hour
    period), you are in danger of having hearing damage... but, if you only
      subject yerself to loud volume levels on an infrequent basis (like
        once or twice a month) then your ears will probably not suffer
          any damage at all, unless the volume's 200 db or something like
            that.  issit true or not that yer ears have a sort of 'shielding'
              effect, for short-term exposure to loudness, kinda like the
                adjustment your eyes make for bright light?????

whadyasay? huh?

Yep.  Each of those tones is one of the little cilia in your cochlea
dying.  "Aaaaaargh!"  Everyone loses some hearing as they age -- loud
sounds accelerate the process.  I get that sensation every couple of
weeks.

Interestingly, this means you can "burn out" certain frequencies.  I used
to be incredibly annoyed by the 14.75 KHz (or whatever) of free-running
standard-resolution video monitors, which I'm always around at work.  Now
I can't hear them at all -- constant exposure has zorched my ability to
hear that particular frequency.

Also interesting is that the impression of "loudness" that you feel is based
on an average over the sound spectrum.  In general this works, but it means
that you can totally blast out your hearing if you are listening to a single
frequency (say a sine wave from an oscillator for some sort of test) even 
though you feel no significant pain from the loudness.

I just called the Super301 company in the South Bay and asked them about
the pricing of their 30db condoms.  They didn't seem to know what I was
talking about.

Do raves in NYC have altars?  My guess is no; I may be very wrong but I
would think that this is an SF thing rather than a rave thing...

You used to be able to get custom-fitted musician's ear-plugs (I forget the
brand name) at the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic for about $50 (they're usually
about $100). These block sound evenly over the entire frequency spectrum- rather
than cutting out the highs leaving a dull <thud thud thud>. *WAY* better than
foam, at any thickness. They're very musical and transparent, and offer about 20dBs
of attenuation. Well worth the money.

This is what I expected from Wicked:  I thought it would be kind
of bad early in the night, and get a little better towards morning.
Instead, it was really bad early in the night, and it got really
good in the morning.

	When we arrived at 4am the place was packed.  I immediately
saw what my 15 dollars was paying for:  Excellent visual 
projections (anyone want to send me their name/number?), about
92 intellabeams, and a mediocore sound system.  Unfortunately,
it also bought a neon pink-and-glass-block bar (gag!) and
San Francisco's "Coolest" club goers.  The bar I could live with,
the "cool" club goers I could not.  The dance floor was swamped
with expensive clothes and cheap pick-up lines.  Beer was spilt
everywhere.  There were way to many people on the dance floor
to actually dance, and about half of them were just standing
around talking.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I really enjoy some
showiness at clubs.  I like dressing up in some cool clothes too,
but I don't make it my mission in life to look cool, like many of 
these people do.  For some reason, the sound did not seem all that
loud.  I could here the conversations around me a lot better than
Pierre's spinning.  
	But, as I expected, around 5am people started leaving.  Around
six o'clock it felt like someone in a back room through a giant knife-
switch (give my party life!) ,and hey! I found myself at a good house
party.  By 7am there was just enough people on the dance floor to
create some vibe and to have room to twirl around a little (well,
not literally (:   ).  Even the music seemed louder. Either they
turned it up in the morning or there were just fewer bodies to
absorb it.  At 8:30, the dj (sorry, havn't matched names/faces yet
to sf djs) was forcibly removed from the 1200s, and we left
happy.
	I suggest if you want to experience Wicked, that you arrive at
5am.  This way, you will just catch the tail end of the drinking 
crowd, and have about 3 hours of a cool house crowd.  
	Anyone want to tell us about the Ameba party?

Well, we often have altars here in Seattle, but then again we've got a

	Two comments:

	To Larry:  Along with the steady *riiiiiiing* that I get with the
tinnitus, I also occasionally get the pure sinusodal tone, too and often
wondered what it was.  I guess I've got the same question -- does anyone
know what this is? (fluid rolling around in your inner ear?)

	AboutWickedPost:  My first rave was the Wicked about six weeks or so
ago (also at Townsend), and although I had an absolutely fabulous time, I
had some similar complaints as the guy on alt.raves.  I felt the music was a 
little too simple (?).  I guess I like more going on at the same time with the
beat/bass/etc.  I actually *liked* the fact that everyone there was dressed to
dance.  Rather than being faced with a room full of fashion kings/queens, I
was pleasantly surprised with a lot of really down to earth, smiling faces :-).
Does anyone have any recommendations on parties with better music?  No insult
to the folks that run the show.  I'll still go to the next one :-).

Subject: Any takers for GG PARK?

As much fun as In The Light was, I'm not going to be able to organize 
another Golden Gate Park party this year.  However, I have the date of 
Sept. 3rd reserved for us.  Anyone who would like to take the lead on this 
can count on my help with the paperwork.  A few notes:

- The Park Permit costs $400.
- A $500 refundable security deposit is also required.
- The SFPD sound permit costs $30.
- No soliciting is permitted at the site, although we can probably get a
  waiver for this if we do a benefit of some sort.
- Amplified sound must end at 6pm.
- The renovations to the Band Shell are complete and will provide a more 
  interesting backdrop & better acoustics than previous parties there.
- Sept. 3 is Labor Day weekend, the same weekend as Burning Man.
- I managed to collect about $200 in donations for In The Light.  Some
  people have already stated that they would donate some $ for another park
  party, but it is not clear how much can be expected in this regard.
- There are plenty of volunteers on sfraves willing to help setup/cleanup 
  etc.

I'd love to see another park party, so if anyone is interested in organizing
one, or knows someone who is, please let me know. :)

When Liz Roberts, Laura, WILL-E & I were trying to put together a rave here 
in the NYC area, Liz mentioned setting up a table to use as a sort of altar 
(I remember her using a different term, but the idea is the same).  I loved 
the idea, and had never seen one before at a party in NY.  

When Will-e and I traveled to your sf land I saw one (I think it was at the 
Blue Cube party), and was impressed that someone went out of their way to 
add that level of spirituality to the party; it was there also that I saw 
not one but two people burning sage (at Launch Pad), which WILL-E has done 
at home before, but which I've never seen at a NYC party.

So I'd say it's a sf or west-coast thing.

For a long time i've thought that the whole
"You do things your way, i do them mine" thing was totally right on,
but then i realized i was just too egotistical about how
important i thought a lot of issues are just too damn important
to let any viewpoint hold,
things like racism...
i try Real hard to say "let them think their way, and you think yours"
when listening to a bunch of KKK members on Geraldo
and i think i can do it better than most of my friends, but overall...
its just too much of a thing that is not just affecting
their own persons, but is somethign that affects others

Now, as to an "I do my drug, you do your drug" idea...

Considering how your body is pretty much made up of chemicals
and the way your brain interacts is pretty much based
upon the chemicals that happen to be in it at the time
Chemicals seem to be an important thing 

As an important thing, we should look at the chemicals that people take
and what affects they have...

I think that too many people in drug cultures try to deny the 
negative effects of their drug of choice
Mainstream America was doing a damn good job of placing all the
blame on every other drug that wasnt supported by a large lobby
and it's just now that we are starting to deal with all the problems
that nicotine and alcohol and hopefully soon caffeine cause

In the same respect, lots of users of LSD or E or whatever say
"See? Our drugs arent like that!"
(in reference to things like physical/sexual confrontations and abuse
that tend to happen a lot by people under the influence of alcohol)

The big question is: Are the people the problem or the drugs?

I mean, i think that a lot of the people attracted to LSD for its
abilities to open peoples minds are going to get that otu of it

people attracted to LSD because its a fun toy and makes you feel funky
will get that out of it

I spent a whole nite in Los Angeles watching people in a park wandering
around aimlessly just talking to themselves and the little
people that they were seeing

They didnt seem happy to me, they didnt seem to be having some
great educational experience either, they were just homeless people
looking for some way to get their minds off their problem
and found a REAL cheap one that lasts for the whole nite

It's not the typical picture i have in my mind, from experience, of
an LSD user, but its one that is probably the strongest

It just points out the important thing that:

ANYTHING CAN BE ABUSED
~~~~~~~~

some people have addictive personalities, and it doesnt matter
what they do, until they change their personality enough,
they will get addicted
to heroin, to alcohol, to MDMA, to watching TV all day
all of these can be done to a point where 
they do nothing with their lives,
do not interact with other people,
have no job, contribute nothing to anything, etc etc etc

WITH ALL THIS IN MIND:

How can anyone say, "My drug is better than your drug!"

Well, i dont think anyone should say that, but they should
provide lots of INFORMATION about drugs,
about the statistics, and better yet about real stories

I have NEVER talk to someone about Speed without them saying that
they hate it and how stupid it is
Does that mean they dont do it again? No, it doesnt. I see that as a problem.
(Of course i also grew up aroudn smokers who said the same thing...
and none of them ever attempted to quit)

with everything, people get really fucked up, on whatever
and they go to far for their own good, and say
"I'm never going to drink (or whatever, thats just the most common) again!"
only to go and abuse themselves later

And percentagewise it would be real hard to find out which drugs
are the most problematic
because the percentage of the population that uses alcohol
and the percentage that uses psychadelics are not even close

NONETHELESS, we should do our best to provide information
and to find information about things like:
Rape, Domestic Violence, etc etc 
and see what drugs are related to those

and use that as caveats, 

Its NOT the drug that is the problem in these cases
its the fucked up way that WE as a society
are letting people be brought up

letting them think its okay to hit their spouse, OR
not giving them the means to express themselves another way

letting them think that certain sections of society are objects of desire
and not letting them interact with them as Subjects of their own control
which makes things non-ideal for either side

if you throw chemicals into someone's system, depending on what it does
and depending on them, these leanings can get increased or decreases
some chemicals are obviously more likely to increase
and some more likely to decrease
but it kinda depends on what they are acting on

my point?
theres not enough information about anything
theres CERTAINLY not enough negative stories
about psychedlics/empathnogens that arent media-hype 
some kid thought she could fly and jumped off a roof type things

personally, i think, ideally, any chemical can be used to 
learn, either because it fucks you up and you learn to deal with that
or through some other means that is immediately less harmful

but thats ideally
and it think that the ideal type people doing that
would be ideal becuase they have enough information
to really know what they are doing

until then, we need to look around and get information
look at all the people in the spotlight using heroin 
to solve their problems and when that doenst work, a shotgun

look at our friends or former friends in a state of
amphetamine-induced paranoia too scared to talk to you

look at our friends who are involved in horrid relationships
that eat at their lives until a half an hour after
they pop a little capsule in their mouth

and look at all the things that happen that are good
when under whatever influence
and learn that too

                         Rainbow Gathering report
                         ========================

                    (c) by John Draper (Cap'n Crunch)

   Well,  I'm BACK,  after traveling slighly less than 5000 miles in 
a period of almost 2 1/2 weeks.    Thus explains my long term absence.
But,  from the chatter in the Raves mailing lists,  I wasn't missed.

   I had actually not planned to go to Rainbow Gathering,  but it sort
of turned out that I was in a unique position to go,  so I jumped on the 
opportunity.

   It all started when my friend Aaron who origionally lived in Iowa,
wanted me to drive him there to pick up the rest of his stuff.    Figuring
that I have to start work soon,   this was our only opportunity to do this,
so our decision to drive to Iowa was a "Spur of the moment" thing.   So
on the 22nd of June with little fanfare,  we pack up the car and head east.

   About 40 hours later,  after continious driving,  we arrive in Iowa City,
A College town.    While Aaron was dealing with his stuff,  I head over to
the University Computing center where I can get on the Internet and check
my Email.   Few people even knew I was gone.

   At that time,  I learned my friend from Pennsylvania was heading west and
was to pass within 50 miles of Lake Okoboji in North West Iowa (Our next
destination),  so we arrange to meet there a few days later.    Andy,  our
friend from Pa.   was heading out West to Wyoming to attend the Rainbow
Gathering,  so it was then that we made the decision to go.    

   On the way,  we visited Yellowstone park,   and took long hikes through
the wilderness,  enjoying the more remote parts of the park.    For me,  it
was really GREAT because I haven't gone on such a long trip in several years
and needed the break.     We met some people who had been to the Gathering
earlier in the week,  who warned us of some potentual health hazards and to
avoid drinking from some of the natural water sources in the area,  because
some of the land was used for cattle grazing.   We also get word that more
than 10,000 people were already there,  and the event hadn't even started
yet,   but most of the encampments were already set up,  and that it was
spread out over an area about 5 miles in diameter along several ridges
and valleys,  with a huge meadow (About 1 mile by 1 1/2 miles in size)
with some large and very small forest "Islands" providing ideal camp
environments with plenty of dried firewood easy to gather for the fires.

   After several days at Yellowstone park,  we head south to the site of the 
rainbow gathering and easily find the nearest city "Big Piney" along the
route where we take the cut-off to the national park.    After driving
about 10 miles on paved road,  and another 20 miles on dirt roads,  we
finally make it to the huge parking area late in the evening and decided
to set up camp in the parking area and hike into the main Rainbow area
in the morning.

   We learned that it was about a 2 1/2 mile hike to what they called the
"Center Circle".    Andy,  with his two daughtors Lindon and Heather wanted
to camp near Kid Village (Another half mile in),  so we lug all our camping
gear up to that point.    Along the way we stop at the "Ganji testing station"
for treats and coffee and casually make our way,  visiting all the camps
along the way.    Everyone greeted us with "Welcome home brothers and sisters"
as we headed down the long pathway into the main Gathering area.   The place was
so spread out.   Hundreds of people scatterred out over this huge "Bowl" like
meadow,  the air so clear that everything looks so close until you realize that
these tiny little things out there are people.    Far out on the other side
of the main area is the Teepee area.   These huge teepees,  along with the
Wyoming mountains in the background certainly convinced me that I had taken
a trip back in time to the days of the old west.   Camps were set on the edges
of the tree lines.    Kid Village was in this little "Inlet" of trees,  and
CALM was located at the tip of a tree penninsula.  

   Aaron met some of his friends from Iowa,  and insists that we hike another
mile back to a camp called "Turtle Soup".  which eventually became our home
for a week.    Along the way,  we visit Sun Dog camp,   North West camp, 
MIA/POW camp,  and way in the back,  we finally make it to Turtle Soup.
I figure that we were about 4 miles from the parking area at this point.

    The Turtle Soup camp is mostly folks from Michigan,  and probably (in my
opinion) was the hippest camp at the Gathering.

    A little about the environment....   I figure we were at about 8000 feet
elivation.  On our first night,  it was BELOW FREEZING,  and I had ice crystals
all over my sleeping bag in the morning.    But as soon as the sum comes up,
the temperature rapidly rises to well above 80 degrees.   The sun is fiercly
hot in the day,  very windy,  and extremely dry.   Most days I was there,
it was partly cloudy,  and when the sun gets blocked by clouds,  the temperature
drops down to 50 degrees within minutes.

    Later that afternoon,  a fire started,  but luckely,  it was quickly put out
before it got out of hand.   It turned out that some bozo built a fire too 
close to an adjacent tree,  and without a rock base,  and the roots caught
fire and spread quickly to the rest of the tree.    Quick thinking on the
part of bystanders quickly chopped down the tree to isolate it from
the others,  and the fiew was doused.   Naturally, we were warned that
fire conditions were very high due to the windy weather.   That evening, 
we had a council meeting and gathering to make sure that everyone knew about 
the fire danger,  and what to do if there was a fire.  IE:  Get out of the
trees and out into the meadow.

     The rangers were very impressed with how fast we reacted to the fire,  
and how quickly we set up the bucket brigade to put it out.   By the time the
fire fighters arrived,  we were mopping up the fire,  putting out the "hot
spots". 

    The water sources come from spring water,   but it had to be filtered, 
and was un-drinkable unless filtered.    Turtle Soup had our own water 
filtering pump,  and we took turns pumping our own drinking water through 
the filter.

Later that afternnon,  after the fire,  I go out and explore the vast area
and visit the camps.    With only 3 hours of daylight,  I didn't have much
exploration time after having to help deal with the fire,   but I manage to
make it back to Turtle Soup to get my flashlight before wandering out to
all the fires scatterred around this vast area.

Most of the encampments were in the forest,  bordering the meadows.   Some
areas just had little Islands of trees in the vast meadows,  and others in
huge groves of trees.    Finding my way around at night was quite challanging,
but I finally figured out that it was really not possible to just pick out
some camp and head out there at night.    I quickly learned that it was much 
easier to just sequentially go from camp to camp,  visiting each one,  and
hanging out by their fire before striking out to visit another one.

On the 2nd full day ( I think it was Sunday) in the early afternoon,  
I decided to dose up and hang out by my camp and do my yoga.   About
the time I was "peaking" I hear a faint shout "Fire Fire" from far away,
but no reaction from anyone close by.    About 5 monutes later,  everyone
was shouting "Fire Fire".    By that time,  I could smell the smoke,  and
quickly grabbed my fanny pack (With my car keys),  and vacated our tent
area and headed towards the main Turtle Soup camp.

By the time I made it to the camp,  it was diserted,  and a ranger directed
me in the opposite direction (Towards the Krishna camp).    I was totally
disorentated,  going off in a direction TOWARDS the trees and in the opposite
direction to the opean meadow where I would seek safety.    I don't know how
close the fire was,   but I could hear it,  and the smoke was really getting
thick.    Eventually,  a person named Dan assisted me down to the open meadow,
and we made it along the river (Away from the trees).    Once out in the meadow,
I realized how bad the prediciment I was in.    Flames were shooting up
hundreds of feet in the air,  and the wind was blowing the flames everywhere.

I tried to skirt the fire by going in the opposite direction,  always trying
to stay behind the fire,   running like crazy along the river.   I never
stopped running until I actually reached the river and came across the Krishnas
doing their "Hera Krisha" chants.    I just wanted to get away from them as
quickly as possible,  so made my way along the river for several more miles
until I was far enough away from the fire (And Krishnas) to feel somewhat safe.

By that time,  I noticed the wind had changed direction,  blowing the fire
AWAY from me,  so thinking I was somewhat safe,  took the opportunity to
skinny dip in the river to cool off,  get my bearings and figure out where
I was.   I must have covered about 7 - 8 miles (About two ridges from the
main circle),  and after meeting some other people,  learned just how far
I had traveled.    I never saw any forest rangers anymore,   but teamed with
several other Rainbow folks,  picking my way back to the main circle which
was estimated to be about 4 miles away from where I had fled the fire.

On the way back,   I saw that the fire fighters had started to drop fire
retardent on the fire,   but by the time I returned back to camp,   most
of the fire was put out and rumors were that it was ALMOST under control.

I also learned happily that Turtle Soup survived the fire,  but the Aloha
camp got burned out.   The fire was located near the Serenity kitchen.

   Announcements were made for volunteers to help mop
up the hot spots,  so 4 bucket brigades were immediately formed,  and about
4000 Rainbow folks (including myself) joined in the mopping operation.

The wind played a great part in helping to contain the fire,  as it changed
directions three times,  whipping the fire opon itself towards the areas
it had previously burned,  thus resulting in only about 8 achers of forest
burned.   We were REALLY LUCKEY.

Aaron,  my freind was caught in the parking lot when the fire started,  and
wasn't allowed back to the camp until long after most of the fire was put
out.    There was only a very small number of professional fire fighters
available to focus on this fire,  because of many larger fires in Wyoming
and Glenwood Springs Colo.  

Later on,  the local fire investigaters learned the fire was arson,  and
just before I left the Gathering,  we learned that the bastard was caught.

I arrive back at camp at about 2 am,  totally tired and fried out.   Then
thinking back,  and with some maps of the area,  tried to figure out where,
and how far I had traveled.   I'm not so sure,   but after tallying up the
distances,  I think it must be in the range of about 45 miles or so of
walking (And running),  when I considered I went to the parking lot TWICE
after helping fight the fire,  and on two of the bucket brigades,  each of
which was about a mile long.

That evening of the fire,  someone commented "The fire is out",  and I rebuffed
and said "NOT LIKELY".    That mopping operation took several more days to
insure that "root fires" wouldn't flare up again.

That evening,  EVERYONE was on FIRE WATCH...

The next day,   I focued on doing more of my yoga,   teaching other Rainbow
family members how to identify "Energy blockages" and remove them through yoga
and thai chi like exercises.    

That next evening,   I went night exploring again,   hopping from camp to camp,
telling stores of my travels to Russia and other interesting things.    My
wanderings brought me far and wide until Sunrise (2nd day without sleep,  and
35 more miles walked,  hiked or wandered).  Instead of trying to sleep at night
(When it was the coldsest),  I used that time to keep active (And warm).   Then,
I would meditate out in the meadow (When it was the warmest).

Most of the evenings,  I would dance my ass off in the drum circles,  grooving
on the flames of the fire as a natural source of visual eye candy,  tripping
on the lights of the fire and the stars in the sky.    Unfortunately,   the
circles didn't offer much room to dance without getting roasted near the fire,
and buring off physical energy dancing like crazy.    Somehow I managed to
kick around for several hours before I got so hot that I had to cool off.
Some of the best drumming I've heard in a long time...

Late one afternoon it rained,  right about the time we were to gather out in
"Main circle",   but nature had other pland for us,  and provided us with a
spectacular rainbow,  lightning,  thunder.  and her awsome power.    I stayed
sheltered in "Everyone's Kitchen" trying to stay out of the way.    Eventually,
I made it over to Kid Village to visit with Andy before going back to Turtle
Soup..

That evening,  the weather was surprisingly warm,   but pushing that "Warm front"
was a "Cold front" and long after I wrapped myself in blankets,   the weather
got colder and colder.    Not having a warm sleeping blanket,   I wrapped around
anything I could find.     I did manage to stay somewhat warm,    but was 
surprised to find it snowing in the morning.    Shortly after that,   later on
in late morning,  yet another awsome Rainbow was hanging in the sky....  This
one was from snow,  and a lot more intense.    But that evening,   thanx to the
warmer evening before it got cold,   I slept for the first time since I arrived.
In fact,   after staying for more than 6 days,  I think I only slept TWICE.

Living out there for a week made me realize how little technology means,  as
I totally lost touch with the rest of the world.    I called no one,  nor even
cared what happens in the real world.    The only high tech thingie I had was
a flashlight.  It was GREAT!!    Wandering around in the great hills,  large
meadows,   and seeing the teepees.  No cars,  electric lights,  amplified sound,
radios,   or anything to even remind me that I'm in the 20th century.   

The stars were awsome,  at 8000 feet,  there was little air between me and outer
space,  no pollution to dirty up the air,   no bright electric lights were
intruding on my sky gazing.    Eventually,  my lousey night vision improved,
but I still needed a flashlight to nagigate the trails.

One day,  Aaron and me decide to head out even further to a place he discovered
called "Granola Funk".   It was an "Out of the way" camp,   very nice people,
and spent several hours with them,  hanging out,  telling stories,  and keeping
warm by the fire.   

We also visited the "Lost Hippies" camp,  "Fairy camp",  and a number of others
in that area,   but couldn't get to the Pizza Kitchen or sweat lodges.    

Living at Rainbow gathering was like living in a utopean world,  where barter
replaced money.    This was an experience I'll never forget...

Zippy Rave
==========

Our 2nd to last evening,  we get word of a Rave to take place in the parking
lot area.    When I hear the word "Rave" my ears perk up and I take immediate
notice.    Raving is my favorite passtime,  and I really like dancing until the
sun comes up.    So,  I head over to the main access trail waiting for some
people coming from the parking lot to tell me if a rave is really happening.

I had assumed that I would be able to hear it,   but as I walked along to access
path,  I could barely hear anything.    Some people were pointing in a direction
opposite to Bus Village (Where it as alleged to be).     As I headed down to the
area (Still not hearing the music) I realize why...    It was in this huge deep
revine.   I could hear the generator but not the music.     Once I got close
enough,  I could hear this amazing acid trance music like what you get from
Germany,   and it didn't take me long to get down there and start dancing.

WOW!! What energy... And how bright electric lights were,  compared to camp
fires.   It didn't take long for me to get acquainted with the Zippies,  and
I danced my ass off all night.    At one point,  just as the sun was coming up,
I realized that I was the only person dancing for about a half hour...   

Eventually,   I noticed a fire,  and most people (including the Zippies) were
huddled around the fire.    I quickly joined them and got told some amazing
stories about the Zippy movement.    Pretty heady stuff...    I would say at
the peak,  about 50 - 70 people were at this small family rave.... Most had a
lot of fun,  and the rave disn't in any way,  interfere with the reat of the
Rainbow gathering.  In fact,  It was almost invisible,  and one had to make
a concerted effort to find it.    You couldn't find it my listening for the
"Thud Thud" sounds,   thats phore shore...

We were assures that the Zippies were to do a live presentation the next day,
but the Zippies were to be heading out to San Francisco,  and couldn't stay
one more night.

The next day,  we managed to get our car up to the "Secret access road",  about
100 feet from our camp.  We assured the rangers that we would only be there long
enough to load our camp gear and leave by sunset....    Aasron takes the car
into town to get gas (town's only gas station closes early).

I attend the last circle,  and tearfully said my goodbys to all these wonderful
Rainbow brothers and sisters,  and make a vow to definately make it next time.

On the way home
===============

   We left LATE at night,  around 10 pm or so,  and headed back to civilization,
and the rest of the world regrettably.    While traveling through Salt Lake City,
I stop and get a newspaper and read an awfully inaccurate article about the 
Gathering that made me want to vomit.    Cristopher Smith was the reporter,   
but his article contained som many inaccuracys that it is hard
to believe that he even visited tha Main Circle.   Here is what "the Salt Lake
City Tribune" said about the Family....

Headline:   RainBow family may say Utah is the place for 95 reunion

It opens with:   Utah,  are you ready for the Rainbow Family.....   It goes on
  to mention that the Rqainbow members are considering Utah.     Hmmm!   Don't
  recall that,  but I wasn't at ALL the council meetings.    That might have
  been discussed.
  
  Apparently,  this Ron Jablonski,  spokesman for the Forest service incident
  command center was quoting this to the press.
  
They go on to mention...  "Family members caused 4 fires...,  the largest
  scorched 8 acres near the Kiddy Village or Serenity camp.    "Forest service
  crews were assisted by Family members in controlling the fires,  although the
  Family members were not equipped to be on the fire line".
  
I personally feel that the forest service didn't give enough credit to the
Family on how quickly the fire was dispatched.   I urge all you Brothers and
Sisters to please write to the Salt Lake City Tribune and please set this
poor un-informed weenee straight.

We stay overnight in Reno (Where the hotels are really cheap),  and go swimming
at Pyrimid lake to cool off from the 100+ degree heat.    Shortly after 6 pm,
we cross the California border... Aaron asleep,  and me driving the last leg
into Mill Valley.....

For those that cannot make it,    and for those that can,   I hope to see you
all next year,   and that I can be better prepared....

Peace...

Hello, I'm new to the sfraves list.  It looks great so far.

  I'm trying to track down some way to contact Crash Worship.  About a year 
ago, I toured with them for two weeks as their sound engineer.  Since then, 
I've been busy trying to stabilize student loans and all that Real World sort 
of stuff and I've lost track of them.

  I didn't see an ad for Crash Worship in San Francisco until the *day after* 
the show.  Talk about timing!  Did anyone see the show?  (Sorry if it's been 
discussed to death already.)  On the tour, we had a show every day except for 
a few long distance travel days so I saw more then ten shows in 14 days -- 
there's some stories there...

  An email address or the snail mail address of their record label would be 
great.

  I've just moved to the Bay Area this past March leaving behind Albany, New
York.  I'm a Unix sysadmin working for NASA Ames at the NAS facility.  We've 
got some really nice computer toys (two Cray Y-MPs, a Thinking Machines CM-5, 
an
Intel Paragon, piles of Silicon Graphics workstations, etc.) so I'm happy here 
workwise, but the nightlife in or around Mountain View for someone like myself 
is either non-existent or strictly word of mouth.  I don't mean to be elitist, 
but the Edge on a Saturday night is a depressing place to be.

  We plan to move to San Francisco inside the next year or so, but I don't 
have a handle on the area yet.  So in general, any suggestions of places to go 
and things to do, areas to check out for apartments, etc. would be useful.

  If you feel this is inappropriate material for sfrave, feel free to email me 
directly.

The Zippies thing in the Grand Canyon is happening, it's just
not being set up, paid for, or run by the Zippies.  This guy
Ryan I know (inertia@delphi.com) is seeting up the party using
his own resources and the Zippies are bringing DJs and are basically
special guests of honor.

This is what Ryan himself told me about 3 weeks ago, so if my information 
is wrong I'm sorry but I'd think the source is reliable :-)

	Some guy approached me and said 
	"we really like your Weird Blinking Lights music. would you like
	 to play at a massive Zippy rave?"

	I said, "thank for the offer but i'm really not to into that scene
		but I hope it goes well for you."

	he said "but this could mean a lot of MONEY for you."

	i then launched off on that this whole cyberzippyraver
	all about people just like him and that i would never lend my
	share my resources with such pathetic greed and weakness and that
	I would have nothing to do with him.

	he wouldnt relent. he followed me around and kept saying "money!
	it could mean money"

	i came fairly close to decking the guy. he was physically in my space
	and couldn't believe that i could turn down his "hip" offer.
	to me this is what this whole thing, as well as all other currently
	documented "hip" things are about. greed and trend. 

	i hope they keep their evil and filth away from our city. they would
	do much better in LA

Yes, let's avoid this SF/LA thread, especially since we've had first
hand reports from Tam and Laura, among others, about the good parts
of the scene in LA.  

Besides, I think SF can handle the Zippies just fine.

Ah, I'm pleased to see a Crash Worship helper on our group!  Sorry you 
missed the show, I enjoyed it muchly.  The only discussion on sfraves was 
my notice urging people to check'm out, and a reply from someone who was 
glad she took my advice.  The best place to find discussion of CW is on
rec.music.industrial.  I think most ravers would enjoy CW, but it's not 
the same as a rave by any means, though they  aren't Industrial 
either, IMHO. I see a few ravers at CW shows, but not many.  I'd be 
intrigued to find out if there is more of a connection in other cities.
 
There is a good thread about about the 
SF show on r.m.i.  It's also probably the best place to find 
out  how to get in contact with them, as I already saw a similar request 
on that newsgroup.  I saw that they are now booked by the Rave agency, which 
I believe is local.  Rave with a capital R, that's their name.  I hope 
that there can be discussion of CW on this group, so if anyone wants me 
to either e-mail or post the CW review thread, let me know.  I would love 
to hear your stories, I've heard so many crazy rumors.  Welcome to the 
Bay Area, and remember, Mountain View isn't THAT far from SF.

The Dave Brock one was a little silly, but you left out his more

Hello,

Does anyone know what downloading the image.ps version of the imag file
will get me?  Are there pictures or what?  Or just prettier typeface
than the regular image file? (I already have the latter and the .ps
version is pretty big)

I do have postscript capability...

thanks,

seems to be a lot of confusion and misinformation going around about the 
whole zippy thing.i'll relate the info i have and people can interprete 
this however they see fit-------
the "zippies" are anybody.the word means "zen-inspired professional pagan".
if you think that you might describe yourself this way , then you're a zippy.
if you don't like labels, that's cool too.
currently, there is a group of people who have been travelling across 
america as the "zippy pronoia tour". this tour started in london from the 
megatripolis club and wound it's way via the rainbow gathering to san 
francisco.some of them are sleeping on our floor.others are scattered 
throughout s,f, on other peoples floors.some of them are from england , 
some are americans who joined up along the way.
this is a diverse group of people {new people are joining every day).
the organizing principle of the pronoia tour is chaos.
there isn't actually anyone "in charge" , and at this point i'm sure many 
people have tried to claim that they are the "organizers" but i can 
assure you that this is impossible.
the grand canyon thing is happening and people are encouraged to bring 
their own sound systems.

Jus' wanted to add an imho to the discussion on ecstacy:

psychologically speaking, i think it rewires your personality somehow.  it
is a subtle effect, but real, i think.

i honestly believe that doses of e, appropriately administered, would transform
the world.  i've already encountered two different communities that have been
transformed, or perhaps created, by e.  

i've also known people who would steal and grovel for their next hit.  

what comes down to i think is that it makes you feel truly and genuinely 
happy...there have been a few times when (under its influence) some problem
or piece of static in my life would change.  it was as if the e transformed
my mentality concerning that aspect of my life.  and when the drug wore off,
and the feeling went away, there would be no more problem....i mean, it 
wouldn't look like a problem anymore.  it would look like something that
had been bugging me, wanting my attention, wanting my love.

that post about Adolf Hitler & speed keeps going around and around in my
mind...creepy!  (who was it that told us all about Hitler's daily injections
of meth?  and suggested that the Holocaust was a direct result of speed?
or maybe i read that somewhere else...sorry!)

the people that i know who would steal and grovel for their next e experi-
ence were just going through a crazy period in their lives and got over it
eventually.  as far as i'm concerned, they were looking for a way to feel
some love.  

one last thing:  i don't really care if e does some kind of irreparable
damage physically... it used to worry me some, but not any more.  the
benefits make up for all that.  the chance to feel like an angel for an
hour or two was worth it!

peace, love & buckets of e to you all!!!

How many of these have we done?  I'm not sure . . . . 

        Fluid Grooves (Crissy Field)
        Liquid Air (in SF, was it 24th?)
        Liquid Air (Freemont)
        and then I lost count because I moved here :-)

anyway, the biggest complaint I've heard about these parties has come
from my own mouth -- it's too damn cold most of the time!  

We have a plan, however, to deal with this.  We're going to make a go
at a party this FRIDAY in a Mid-Peninsula location where it *should*
be a bit warmer at night.  DJs will include Tamara (funky cool grooves),
HDW (Bryce, doing whaterver), me (trying to beat match those fast trance
records again) and hopefully some other friends of the family as it were.

i haven't exactly worked out my feelings but i don't like the zippies one 
bit....i feel they have nothing to offer me, a twentynothing...i mean i 
am distrustful of a new movement that doesn't have the word "youth" 
attached to it...maybe i am just being ageist or something...but i also 
see a commercial/greed/money element that resonate described so clearly...
also i think they don't know what they are doing or maybe they have it so 
planned out this disorganization is planned...all i really see is some 
large bucks and some sleek hip pr agents...(they had a "press conference" 
in nyc earlier this summer **ravers have never a held press conferences for 
a reason**) and also this joke of a woodstockthing...ahhhhh!!!
I FIND THIS ALL VERY FRUSTERATING!!!

maybe if we don't give the zippies the attention they want they will go away?

i guess all we really have are renegades, tazs and crash worship...(:(:(:
and that sounds good to me....susie (:

I wouldn't be so hard on the Zippies.  There are some good folks involved
and it's clear that Megatripolis is a very happening thing in the ferment
of the UK club scene.  But nevertheless, their spokespeople have a chronic
problem reining in their hype.  crunch, bless 'im, gave us a great and
realistic view of what they are doing in his Rainbow Gathering report.

Quite frankly, I think that the arrival of Mark Heley and the Wicked
crew and others from the UK in the early 1990s in SF, and more recently
the visitation by the DIY crew last year and the forthcoming transplantation
of the Third Floor crew (Digit, EFX, Buck) to the UK for a while have and
will have far greater implications for the development of a GOOD scene
with global interconnections.  And you know what, we're part of that 
with our mailing lists and vrave.  I'm glad the Zippies are participating
in these same tides of change.  But instead of preaching how house and
techno are going to change the global zeitgeist, I'd rather get on wit
the business and fun of doing it.  And letting the quality of our scene
and music speak for themselves.

I wanted to let folks know that Susan of YSH will be playing at SPAZ on 
Friday. Yep, she's baaaack.....

Hope you folks can make it-- it should be a really nice party.

I would also encourage folks to come to SPAZ because they are giving some 
new talent a chance to be heard-- something alot of us are really craving :)

Nothing against the larger, more established parties, but I think the 
small ones are really a great place to get recharged with the good vibes.
That has certainly been my (admittedly limited) experience with the 
SFRaves & Sound Vision posse(s)-- I'm not a party animal, but damn have they 
been good :) :) :) ! (props to Ethan, Bryce, and Sean Casey-- <and i know 
i'm forgetting others> if it weren't for you folks, I don't think I'd have 
left the house at night-- expert, professional sound, great visuals (thanx,
Jen, Donovan) and good things to play with are *so* important...)

Hope to see you all there-- especially the folks I've been talking to, 
but haven't laid eyes on yet :)

Peace!

Maui :)

I think a healthy dose of skeptacism is in order for these guys (the
Zippies) all I've seen from them is hype, and if thats all they're
going to put forward then they should expect to be judged by it. Haveing
read there hype hear and in the house confrence on the WELL to me they
ring as nothing more than another third rat e evangelical con.

I was wondering if anyone could suggest the good
music stores for acid, trance, techno, house etc...
current cool music that I keep hearing at all
the raves recently.  Like all this acid like trance
hard sounding grit and flow...  Or should I just be
shopping at Tower and know what I'm looking for?
I seem to keep stumbling on so so kind'f old
boring techno.  Or maybe I'm just asking for
good recommendations on music.  Or maybe Ijust
need to meet people who have tapes of these
recent raves and hit them up for copies...
I don't really know what I need.
Somebody help me!

Ann, what I find so encouraging about your observation is how you clearly
see that your experience doesn't make the "problem" go away, but instead
gives you a more positive perspective on it.  The key here is that the
"problem" still demands you attention.  In other words, you do not use mdma 
as an escape.  In fact, you might even be more likely to take action now
that your perspective on it is a more positive one.
 
Unfortunately, I have known people who use mdma simply as just another
feel-good high; as a way to more easily avoid difficult issues in their
lives; a way to happily continue along a path to nowhere; a path of both
self-avoidance and the avoidance of many difficult aspects of the world
around them.  
 
So much seems to depend on how a person is predisposed to begin with.  Many
people seek to explore, to grow, to reach out - but are held back by deep
psychological pain.  I've seen such people have their lives transformed
by the liberating nature of the mdma experience.  There seem to be others 
who are more predesposed to hiding from the responsibilities and challenges 
that normally come with living a varied and growth-oriented life.  For such 
people, mdma seems to do little more than perpetuate a lifestyle that, IMO, 
rarely leads to happiness for themselves and does little to benefit the 
world that supports them.
 
Fortunately, I think most, or a sizeable minority of people are curious 
about what the world has to offer and what kind of role they can have in
it.  Most people want to be able to love themselves and others around them,
but have been trained by society (sometimes justifiably) to distrust 
instead.  But humans as a species tend to be curious and want to understand 
things.  And because such positive predispositions seen to be buried within 
so many of us, I generally agree with your assessment that
 
"...doses of e, appropriately administered, would transform the world."

Argh! No sooner than I commit to SPAZ when Bryce throws another

Here's a quick rundown of what's around...

In San Francisco --

Tweekin' Records (on Haight near Steiner), 415-626-6995
	good selection of house and acid jazz 12" and CDs

BPM Music Factory (1141 Polk, between Post and Sutter), 415-567-0BPM
	good selection of house 12" and CDs and DJ mix tapes

Gaia Mantra (on Valencia near 16th), email mantra@netcom.com
	good selection of techno and trance 12"s, a few CDs

Record Rack (corner of 18th Street and Sanchez), 415-552-4990
	good selection of commerical house and club music, 12" and CDs

Star Alley
	good selection of commercial hip-hop and house 12" and CDs

Ameba (on Haight, west of Cole)
Housewares (on Haight, east of Masonic)
	Both are clothing stores that carry some CDs and DJ mix tapes



In the East Bay...

Primal Records (2420 Parker, at Telegraph), 510-548-8511
	good selection of house and tribal 12"s -- the current hot place
	for DJs to shop right now.  Some CDs also.

Mod Lang (on University, about a block from campus)
	small dance section, but since everyone shops at Primal, Primal
	will often be sold out of titles that Mod Lang will still have in stock.

I heartily recommend Gaia Mantra at 511 Valencia at 16th Street in SF.

Alex and Klea will happily recommend trance/acid/ambient music for you
and let you *listen* to the music before you buy it. They are an independently
owned store and its a really cool place to hang out and hear the latest music
from outer space.

Tell 'em that "uncle rsn8" sent you...

I used meth every weekend (and only then) for about 2 1/2 months during 
the summer in Santa Cruz, that being one of the only times that lovely 
town has enough employment. I can honestly say that it did no perceptible 
harm whatsoever. I worked like a fiend and had the fortitude I needed to 
survive two tourism-based jobs, and I even enjoyed the experience. It was 
a little hard to eat, but that wasn't much trouble. I didn't sleep for 
two or three days, but heck, I can do that w/o help anyway.

I should also point out that I wasn't smoking it-- I don't know if that's 
relevant or not.

My first E experience left me feeling oddly depressed for a few days, but 
I think that might have been the absence of the person I had been with 
while on it. It hasn't recurred subsequently.

Peace.

There is a solution to Sean's dilemma:

* Go to SPAZ -- it gets over around 2am, right?  We're going to start 
	around midnight.

* At 2am call (415)-985-5244 to check the directions.

* JUST to be safe, check "the usual spot" on your way out of town.

* Join us after SPAZ at Liquid Air, and bring everyone!

To add to the music store list:  I recommend the CD collection
at Rasputnin's in Berkeley.  I've been happily amazed many
times by what their buyer, Brian, gets in there.

Rasputnin's is on Telegraph.

PAGANS AND PATRIOTS

by Gigi Bisson
Contributing Writer, Metro
Copyright 1993. Distributed with permission of author.

We're going to singe, parch, smoulder, simmer, deep fry, and burn to a crisp
in one of the world's largest frying pans.  We're traveling East to find the
West.  A lonely and lawless frontier, so uncharted and undesirable that you
can do whatever you damn well please.  

 Along with a flock of techno pagans, nature-lovers, hippies, full-moon
crazies, performance artists and ravers from the Silicon Valley, San
Francisco, and Los Angeles we made the eight-hour pilgrimage to the northwest
Nevada desert.  My travel partner, partly for shock value, partly for reality
check,  announces our plans to strangers.

"We're going to the Black Rock desert to watch a group of people burn a
40-foot tall wooden man. You heard of it?" he asks waitresses and gas
attendants.

"Are they a bunch of satanists?"
"Sounds like that horror movie, 'The Wicker Man.'"
"Is that some sort of religious festival?"  

We didn't even mention the 30-foot fiberglass dachsund head, stolen from a
Doggie Diner restaurant in San Francsco, hauled out there on a flatbed truck
and crowned with a ring of glowing neon.  The man was wierd enough. The very
idea of building a magnificent four-story effigy and burning it to a crisp. 

An hour out of Reno, we climb over the Sierras. The land dries up and
flattens out, turns from green to gold to brown to beige. In Gerlach,
 outpost of bars, slot machines and taxidermy shops, we stop for ice.
  Stuffed bighorn sheep, coyote, fox and mountain lion line the highway.   I
glance at the official Burning Man topographic map.  Like the Cancer scare on
a cigarettes pack, a rectangle in the corner reads: 

"WARNING: Black Rock Desert may be hazardous to your health. Vehicles may
become mired in unconsolidated terrain.  Should you stray from the path,
remember: Help is NOT around the corner.  People have died here." 

"Do not rely on your odometer or compass. All objects -- humans, cars, our
encampment -- drastically diminish in the scale of the desert.  Lights array
themselves in random and confusing patterns.  Any point may be four, 40 or
should you happen to fix on a star, 400 billion miles distant."

The Black Rock Desert, a prehistoric lakebed that forms the largest flat
expanse in North America stretches to our right. In the distance, spectacular
plumes of dust rise twenty feet above the surface and streak East across the
playa like jet exhaust.   We see a tiny black-lettered cardboard sign:

"BURNING MAN ---->"

They say if you were placed in a dark, silent room and all stimulation was
removed, you would begin to hallucinate within an hour. It's the principle
behind a flotation tank. It's principle behind the desert.  

A black van ahead of us skirts the horizon, disappears into a mirage of heat
haze, hovers and then shrinks into a black sphere that floats above the sand.


Dust plumes streak across the hard-packed white alkaline dust lined with a
fine lacework of cracks. As far as the eye can see. Nothing. Not even a
tumbleweed. Then barren violet mountains in the distance.  We floor it, and
streak across the desert at 70 miles per hour. 

Suddenly, we see BLACK ROCK TRAUMA CENTER, an egg-shaped aluminum trailer,
with bones, kerosene lamps and feathers dangling from the door. A sign warns
that broadcast media will be taping this event. A craggy hippie in a cowboy
hat asks us for our $40 registration fee and directs us on the last part of
our journey. 

"Stake everything down. We had 40 mph winds yesterday. And at night, watch
out for the acid heads driving 90 miles an hour without headlights on, man,"
he says.

 The camp shimmers in the distance. Desert Navigational Locators, a series of
eight sculptures made by William Binzen of rusting potato mashers and
institutional egg beaters, form gateways marking a compass of four
directions. This inner circle is surrounded by an outer circle of vans, land
yachts, Airstream trailers, candy-colored nylon domes and Port-o-Potties. 

A hollow conch-shaped mud sculpture by Pepe Lauzan rises dramatically to the
South, the neon-haloed Dog Head marks the West. And on an axis exactly 15
degrees North of due East, the Burning Man lies in state, with the largest
blank canvas in North America behind him.  Up close and personal, he's a puny
framework of plywood, glued and stapled together.  Like Cher or Madonna, the
icon seems larger in photographs.

Invite 1,000 of America's most helplessly urban people on a  camping trip to
America's most forbidding wilderness, and this is what you get. Sweltering in
black leather with no words like "dehydration" or "sunstroke" in their
vocabulary, staggering barefoot, swigging cappuccino.  Women dance topless
and men wear skirts, oblivious to the threat of sunburn.

They transform Nevada desert into California beach. Just add water. An
"Arabian shiek" wearing a cloak fashioned from designer sheets pedals
aimlessly on a mountain bike.  People circle listlessly in ATVs, dune
buggies, tricycles, skateboards, rollerskates, scooters. A guy skims across
the playa in a deranged landsailer: a four-wheeled plastic horse with a
windsail. Four guys in turbans slumber in a striped tent with a bank of
panels to run the solar refrigerator. 

It's soon apparent that the well-intentioned schedule in the brochure is part
mirage as well. A vaguely African head made of chicken wire, scrap lumber and
copper sheeting marks the center of town.  The "cafe" turns out to be a
Monkey Bean Espresso truck.  A press truck holds a Macintosh computer, a
laser printer, a Xerox photocopier.  A truck topped with antennas and loaded
with high tech equipment forms the pirate radio station, but when we tune
into 89.9 FM, nothing but irritating feedback hum materializes.

The temporal community gathers around a message board near the
satellite-dish-topped Greyhound bus in the center. In the early days, the
bedrock of support came from the Cacaphony Society, a group of anarchic
performance artists and costumers.  Louis Brill, a Cacaphony member,
overlapped the event into another group, YLEM (pronounced eye-lem) an
organization of artists using science and technology that includes Dr.
Clifford Pickover of the IBM Thomas Watson Research Laboratory, and Roger
Malina of the Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Astrophysics on its board of
advisors. 

Flyers are posted for other organizations that now converge here, each with
its own interpretation of the desert. A nature group called Outdoors
Unlimited, a group of conservationationists known as the Desert Survivors, an
Activist BBS. (If you accept the "Official Version " of anything, you are a
danger to yourself and humanity. Call for the latest on FBI, CIA, KGB, DEA,
KKK, FOIA, INS, IRS, JFK, MLK.")  A want ad bluntly advertises the desires of
at least one of the ravers and Deadheads present: "I'm looking for some
'Shrooms. Anybody want to sell some?" 

In the afternoon heat, thermals rise and cause dust devils -- swirling
dervishes of dust that spiral like tiny tornados across the sand.  Winds of
40 miles per hour suddenly rip tarps and shade awnings.  It's miserable. You
can't even keep the dirt out of your beer.  

Every third resident of Black Rock seems to be making a documentary.  I've
been out of the car for less than half an hour when a man thrusts a mike into
my face.

"I'm just looking for the definitive statement on what this all means," he
asks. 

I'm too drained by the stifling heat to mumble something about a strange
succession of mirrors.

We are the burning man. Everything becomes performance art. We suspend
disblief when we walk into the theater.  A tent called The Oasis sports an
indoor recirculating water fountain decorated with plastic snakes.  I tour
the Christmas Tent, strewn with tinsel and garlands. The hostess invites me
to visit later for eggnog, caroling and fruitcake.  Chrismas Muzak is piped
throughout the village and a guy in a red and green kilt and a Santa in a
cotton beard pass out candy canes.  

When the sun sinks into gold, crimson and orange, and a huge yellow moon
rises, the playa cools and settles into a surrealistic neon Las Vegas
carnival.  Various sculptures are ignited and sacrificed.   The doghead is
rimmed with stagelights, the generators hum, and it's transformed into a
stage alive with a halo of neon.  

Dozens of people line up, and tug of war-style, raise the man. Suddenly, his
hollow body is outlined in a dazzling skeleton of glowing blue neon framed in
a fuselage that seems, in the mirage of light, to be a wire-framed,
computer-generated graphic.  His head, a faceless kite-shaped Japanese paper
lantern, is aglow with blue.  Standing on the low horizon, he takes on a
prodigous proportion.  With the aid of technology, a lone man in the
wilderness is suddenly visible for miles.  

A Lost In Space fashion show features "shapes that time forgot."  A throbbing
circle of drummers, people playing tubas, horns, pots and pans forms, and the
costumed dance one by one. An alien, a teradactyl skeleton, a grim reaper or
two, dance in the center, ringed with popping flashbulbs.  

Recognizing the succession of mirrors, someone yells: "Hey, let's get the
video guys in here." Suddenly, a dozen videographers, including the PBS crew,
a super 8 camera, and a guy with a bizarre handmade video camera encased in
an aluminum box, bob in the circle, filming each other.

Time for the "Fire Tree" sculpture/performance: A bonfire is lit inside the
mud-covered shell.  Flames shoot out of the top, which looks like a hollow
glove stretched skyward.  The crowd whoops and chants, drumming, and
spinning. While standing near the center of the mud volcano, one of the
sculptors is nearly sacrificed as the tree colapses on to itself and flames
shoot out of its cracked molten fingers. 

People gather and stare into a neon crop circle, 50 feet in diameter of
glowing red, blue and green broadcasting to some distant UFO in the night
sky. A confused dog stumbles on the circle and is electrified, but not
sacrificed.

At midnight, a rave begins a half mile north of camp.  Follow the strobe
light. The night turns to Burning Jam.  

The Burning Man is the creation of Larry Harvey, who specifically disavows
any spiritual meaning, yet speaks fervently about the Man.  Eight years ago,
Harvey was looking for a way to cheer himself up after a relationship broke
up.  On a whim, he decided to burn a wooden man on the San Francisco beach
during summer solstice.  He called his friend, carpenter Jerry James, and
they knocked together an eight-foot-tall figure, gathered a dozen friends on
the beach, and burned it.  The sight of the man, arms blazing against the
night sky was far more moving than they anticipated.  Each year the Man grew
larger. By the fifth year, the police arrived in time to stop the burning,
and nearly caused a riot.   

They moved the Man away from the law, to the Black Rock Desert.  "Life seems
infinitely precious against that cosmically vast waste," Harvey says.
 "Everything that is, is more intensely so." 

 The Burning Man finally broke even last year, and Harvey reputedly hopes to
eventually make a living off the festival.  He talks of adding to the
spectacle next year, including Laser lights and a Tesla coil generating
man-made lightning. 

"We're primal technology. The ritual is derived directly from technical
requirements, and the logic of engineering the Man," Harvey says.  Last year,
he was invited to exhibit a slide show of the Burning Man at Cyberarts in Los
Angeles.  "A lot of cyberpeople come here,"  he says. 

The growth is a point of contention among the old timers, including Binzen,
who feels the festival has grown dangerously large.  Now the Bureau of Land
Management is demanding $2 per head as rent.  

In response, Binzen started Desert Siteworks, a more personal,
invitation-only performance work that focuses on ritual and art.   "As you
get more deeply into ritual, you relate to the movements of the desert,
working with desert navigation, creating alignments and time-based
performances," he says, talking of car lights creating patterns on the playa,
processions of candles, Stonehenge-like arrangements of sculpture mapped to
the heavens, and sand drawings that work as a matrix that helps us understand
how we fit into the cosmos.

***

The rising sun emerges from the Man's outspread legs. As the day progresses,
it traverses his spine, and exits through the top of his head. Sunday begins
with the Ancient Rite of the Java Cow.  When all the cups have been filled at
the Miraculous and Ever-Flowing Udder, the Cow addresses the crowd with her
ritual greeting: " Do you want cream and sugar with your coffee?" and the
congregation responds as one: "No we want it black."  

We hear of a hot spring, and with vague directions, head East past the Man,
toward the imposing Black Rock on the horizon, speeding away from the
anarchic urban madness and back into nowhere.  Ten, maybe 20 miles away,
across the railroad tracks, we sink into Trego Hot Springs, a warm creek
surrounded with vibrant green grass.  Naked bodies slick with sulphurous
black mud crackle in the sun.  

Remnants from Desert Siteworks litter the springs -- a semicircle of
descending railroad ties called "Woodhenge," and posts topped with sculptural
faces.  We continue on to Bordello Springs, a pristine pool surrounded by a
lone clump of trees and lush asparagus ferns.  

Here, the lawless soak together.  A man dressed in khaki unbuckles his gun
holster and slips in.  A guy from Boulder Creek with two pierced nipples
tells me about the loaded shotgun he found a few yards away.  "I'm thinking
of burning it with the man tonight. Or maybe I'll keep it," he says.  A group
of model rocketeers describe a 15-foot rocket, mislaunched this morning, that
shot back into the playa.  It's now buried eight feet under, and they're
trying to figure out how to extract $2,000 worth of metal from the hardpan
alkali.   A couple of guys called Desert Rats swagger in, one carrying an
automatic rifle.  A guy from Oregon asks if he can fire it, and suddenly, the
desert quiet is punctured with Ramboesque gunfire. 

By the time we head out, angry clouds gather on the mountains.  Thunder
rumbles. Racing toward the camp, racing against the dwindling light, we're
suddenly adrift in a horizonless white ocean.  Clouds hide the stars.  My
compass points West, but we forget how far South we drove.

This is the widest unpatrolled highway in North America.  It's nothing
compared to the 3,500,000 square miles of arridity that make up the Sahara,
but the 1,000 square mile Black Rock Desert ranks as one of top 30 deserts on
earth. Explored by John Charles Fremont in the 1840s on his way to the Santa
Clara Valley, and crossed by the historic Applegate-Lassen Trail, the route
of the 49ers, some sections are apparently littered at 50-foot intervals with
 the graves of infants who died when pioneer wagon trains lost in the winter
snows.  The warning rattles my brain: "People have died here."

 For an hour we race around in circles, heading toward hazy encampments that
appear and disappear on the horizon.  Finally, a flare shoots up in the
Southwest, and race toward it, knowing that the man will burst into flames
any minute now.  Finally, we see it, a blue haze, and the man begins to grow.
 

We screech to a halt behind the man. The crowd has swelled and tripled, and
white lights creep toward him from all directions as locals risk the night
drive to witness the spectacle. 

The crowd writhes to the steady drumbeat in evening gowns, tuxedos, feathered
Mardi Gras costumes, masks, Cyalume light sticks, LEDs and bare skin. Last
year, Brewster Kahle, a WAIS, inc. employee, exchanged wedding vows with his
wife
 while the man burned.

One by one, people volunteer to strip off their shirts and a woman in a
feathered headdress douses them with alcohol and torches their bodies.  A man
and woman rise and shoot flaming arrows into the man's loins.  The drumming
rises, the crowd whoops and hollers in an inebriated frenzy.  It's every bit
as tribal, pagan and halucinatory as Mardi Gras, Carnival, a Grateful Dead
concert. Torchbearers touch the man with flares and WHOOOSH! he's human
effigy flambe. 

Loaded with cheap fireworks, and popping neon tubes, the man starts to
explode. He colapses on his back, and a flurry of sparks drift in the sky.
 People begin jumping over the Man, and a woman slips and falls into the
embers, her dress bursting into flames. 

Lightening ripples like a Tesla coil cranked by a speed-crazed organ grinder,
bright as daylight. The Man is upstaged by a circle of raw electricity.  Rain
pelts us, turning the dust into tenacious clay and a dust storm whips up,
dumps baby powder from the heavens and blots the scene with a whiteout.
 Nature bats last.

"You're gonna turn white," a man standing by a truck covered with CB antennas
says.  A local, he owns a ranch and opal mine to the north.  "There are
probably police infiltrators in this crowd," he says. "The FBI and DEA's
probably here." He tells tales of drug-laden airplanes landing in the dead of
night, yuppies making cattle drives across the desert just like the one in
the movie City Slickers, fights with the BLM over mineral rights.  "They'd
just as soon git rid of all of us," he says. "If this rain keeps up, you
won't even git out with four-wheel drive. I've walked out of this desert
before," he says.  "You better go."

We follow an exodus out of the desert, through the blinding dust,
hydroplaning on the slick mud. I look in the mirror and I'm Betelgeuse -- a
ghost with dust white skin and hair.  As we escape the whirling anarchic
madness, I still ask why. 

Struggling to explain the question of the Man, I talked to my friend Diego, a
student of things mystical.  "Somewhere, back in their common consciousness,
they remember Lugh, the the summer horned god, child of light," Diego says.
"He dies so we may live."  In pre-Christian cultures, a man woven of straw
with loaves of bread inside was burned and the bread then fed to the village.
The druids also sacrificed humans who were burned alive so the crop would be
fruitful the next year.  "The Burning Man also sybolizes the death of love,"
he says.  "In their act of love, he is consumed." 

 Throughout history, old forms of religion are superseded by new, and the new
forms use the most modern technology available to them to propagate. If so,
what is the crop we are promised when the Neon God burns? Commemorative
T-shirts? Video footage? Software?

Or perhaps just an escape. I keep remembering what the rocket man said while
I was soaking in the hot springs. "You know, a lot of different people are
out here at Black Rock this weekend," he said in a Nevada drawl. "You have
the rocketeers.  You have the racketeers. You have the Desert Survivors.  You
have the Desert Rats.  You have the Burning Man people.  And we have
something in common.  We all like fire."

Right -- Rasputin's completely slipped my mind.

As far as techno/house CDs go, Rasputin's seem to be the best place to shop
in the East Bay.  In the city, Reckless (on Haight near Masonic) is pretty
decent.

Im sort of suprised to hear all of this negative talk
about the zippies...  Of course I know nothing about
them, and maybe everything is all true...

But it reminds me a lot of how my freinds who arent
into "the house scene" talk about raves/ravers.
If we expect others not involved with house parties etc.
to let us all party ANd at the same time, not bash
our heads, shouldnt we let those zippies do their thing...?

and not bash them ?

Of course this isnt "their city" so maybe they should
all go home, 
But then I only know three or four people who were born in
sf...  So I guess everyone else I know that lives there
would have to go home too.....hmmmmmm.

Just kidding, but really, my non "raver" freinds sound
a lot like these posts about how lame the zippies are...

I don't se this as a turf battle of any kind, but as a small group of
people claiming to represent a whole lot of people that they not only don't
represent and that( the jpeople doing kkthat but have piss poor if any understanding of what it is
thiiiiiat they are claiming to represent.

the last part should read- and that (the people claiming to do the
representing) have a piss poor understanding if any understanding of what it
is they are claimimng to represent. I wouldn't feel any differently if I

Actually, if you have the time, I'd recommend digging through many of the 
primarily used stores in the city. Techno and house are spread a little 
wider than you'd initially think. 

Streetlight on Market has a large 12" and LP section (new/used) and I ran 
a couple Plastikman and CJ Bolland singles among others, with the import 
of Quoth, a Seefeel promo, and an old Ink! copy of SevHeads "Dead Eyes 
Opened." Lots of white labels and test pressings, but unfortunately, no 
turntable to try them out. They also sell brand new cds with printing 
errors on the disc art for less than normal used prices. They play just 
fine and are even guaranteed to do so. On the nostalgia wave I picked up 
RSW's In Dub and Soundclash for $3.95 each. Lost both of these in the 
"great cd swipe of 91" and kept fogetting to re-buy them. They have some 
interesting new stuff as well but all the techno is located in the 
R&B/Soul section. Wierd.

Record Finder around the corner from Tower on Market has a small used
12"/techno section in the back. Nabbed a HartHouse comp and a Juno 
Reactor single there. Also picked up my Scanner and B12 cds used there.

There are many more in the city and East Bay, but these are the ones I 
hit most frequently, being only a short trip down Market. Happy digging!

One must not forget Outer Rythm Records in San Jose.  It's on S. Bascom 
in San Jose.  In San Jose, I believe it is the only record store in San 
Jose that has vinyl house in San Jose, except for Star Records, which is 
also in San Jose.  Well, this writer must be off now, for <this

KEN STUART <KEN.STUART@tigerteam.org> asked me to post this on the net.  
I got it out of "Feel", the newsletter produced by Martin and the gang.  
I really liked it, and I think you will, too.

Yes, there is a list of this in "Feel".  Here it is:

1.  Tendency to think and act spontaneously rather than from fears based 
on past experiences.

2.  An unmistakable ability to enjoy each moment.

3.  Loss of interest in judging other people.

4.  Loss of interest in judging self.

5.  Loss of interest in interpreting actions.

6.  Loss of interest in conflict.

7.  Loss of ability to worry.  (this is a very serious symptom)

8.  Frequent, overwhelming episodes of appreciation.  

9.  Contented feeling of connectedness with others and nature.

10.  Frequent attacks of smiling through the eyes of from the heart.  

11.  Increasing tendency to let things happen rather than make them 
happen.  

12.  Increase susceptibility to love extended by others as well as the 
uncontrollable urge to extend it.  

enjoy!

PS, I would also like to add that inner peace doesn't cost $20, $25, $10, 
$5, $3, or even 25 cents.  Inner peace is free, because it comes from 
within yourself.  But because it comes from within, you have to make it 
happen for you.

Your ear is actually producing that tone (at the frequency you are about
to lose some sensitivity to), if someone stuck a mic near the outside of
your ear 
when you heard the tone, they could pick it up .

They were in limbo for a long time, but they are open now. I spent
about $60 there last weekend and got some good stuff.

i agree with susie about the zippy "movement."  the fact that they a re
trying to publicize their thang is a bad sign.  publicizing just brings
it to the attention of the authorities, necessitating such measures as
security, much more subterfuge for those who wish to indulge in mind
candy, etc.  in my experience, keeping parties hidden from view of the
general populace, which doesn't much approve of what we do for whatever
reasons, is a key element for success.  im trying to keep an open mind,
of course, but....if the zippies are primarily motivated by greed, then
i don't want to have anything to do with them.

I don't sense that the Zippies are motivated by greed.  In fact, to the
extent that there are self-identified Zippies at all (and I'd be surprised
if more than a few dozen people actually describe themselves that way),
they seem to be motivated by the desire to get attention.

The whole thing seems like an elaborate prank to me, the only difference
between this and, say, the Merry Pranksters of the Kesey/Babbs/Cassidy
era is that the Zippies don't want to admit that's what they are doing.

I'm all for pranksterism, don't get me wrong.  But this all reminds me
of the apocryphal story, perhaps originally from the French Revolution,
where someone at a sidewalk cafe sees a crowd rushing up the avenue
and yells, "Wait for me, I am your leader!"

Somehow, I doubt he was representative of the movement/scene.
The high horses some people seem to be riding are starting to annoy
me re: the zippy thing.  Who are we to judge them.  Seems like a
lot of us are treating them the way other social groups view us.
We need as much unity as we can get be it with the zippies, the
ACLU, the League of Women Voters, or the Rainbow people.  The
oppressors are strong, we need to stick together and not quibble
over reletively minor differences.

Hmmm.  Then I guess I'm a "Tippie" - Tao-inspired professional pagan.

The druids also sacrificed humans who were burned alive so the crop would be
fruitful the next year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to clarify, this is actualy debated among scholars and mystics.  Some
say they did, some say they didn't.  Those that say they did also add that
those burned were criminals convicted of heinous crimes, as Druids were
not just mystics but historians, lawyers, judges, jailers, and possibly
executioners all rolled into one.

Can't believe the new majordomo made the word "help" a reason to bounce

In the list of "Signs and Symptoms of Inner
Peace" I would exclude just one:

 
6.  Loss of interest in conflict.

because the spiritual leaders with inner 
peace that I admire had a *lot* of interest
in conflict:

Gautama Buddha

Jesus the Christ

Mohandas K. Gandhi

Etc.

I would substitute:

6.  Loss of interest in editing minutiae such
as obvious typos on email

I wanted to add a note from my own personal experience, it just
wasn't one I saw expressed yet.

I used meth every weekend (and only then) for about 2 1/2 months during
the summer in Santa Cruz, that being one of the only times that lovely
town has enough employment. I can honestly say that it did no perceptible
harm whatsoever. I worked like a fiend and had the fortitude I needed to
survive two tourism-based jobs, and I even enjoyed the experience. It was
a little hard to eat, but that wasn't much trouble. I didn't sleep for
two or three days, but heck, I can do that w/o help anyway.

I should also point out that I wasn't smoking it-- I don't know if that's
relevant or not.

My first E experience left me feeling oddly depressed for a few days, but
I think that might have been the absence of the person I had been with
while on it. It hasn't recurred subsequently.

Peace.

Maui
============================================================================

Different bodies, different habits, different effects.  This should always
be taken as a granted.

I know plenty of people who use it recreationaly or for work on an
occasional basis with little or no side effects at all.

BUT....

I have enough experience and wisdom on this matter to say:

If you use it consistently for extended periods of time, and especialy if
you use it I.V., you WILL have medium to BIG problems, I guarantee.

I have never seen official studies but have seen more than enough
not-coincidental cases of users developin skin infections and sores
to make a corelation.

I have seen people who I know to be psychologicly "normal" (if there is
such a thing ;-) go way out after heavy use.  Of course they go back
to being there old selves after about 3 days to a month of abstinence.
I have also seen people who were a little psychologicly abnormal go even
further out on the abnormality spectrum.  This includes a recent case
of my mother-in-laws now ex-boyfriend, normaly a very humble and non-
violent person who is now in jail for hitting her and then hitting a
police officer over the head with another police officer's baton.  Prior
to this he told me that "they" were transmitting "programs" to his
brain at night-time through some sort of frequency similar to TV and FM,
that his sores and skin legions were caused by iritations from implants
that "they" had implanted - including the one he retrieved and saved
that he showed me that I believe was a hair folicle, and hundereds of
other paranoid stories.  He became loud, beligerant, obnoxious, and
paranoid of everybody and everything.  I could type pages of these stories
about him and a whole bunch of others I have known in the last 10 years.

I do know one person who has been a heavy user for 10 years has no
dicernable pysical or psycholical effects and never gets sick.  I
often joke with him that germs and virus can't live in his chemical-
laden body.  But, his problem is simple yet profound.  He parties and
raves so much that he's often late or just sleeps all day through work
during his one day after four days recovery and he can't hold a job.

I don't believe that there's been enought time to see if nuerolgical or
other damage occurs long term from this kind of use.

They say speed was the demise of the Haight-Ashbury scene or the greater
hippy scene in general.  I don't know if you can realy pin-point that one
thing but blames a funny thing.  People like to say it's not the drugs
it's the people who abuse them but you can also truthfully say the people
wouldn't have done that/been like that if it weren't for the drugs.  Or 
that the drugs wouldn't have done that to the people if the people weren't
using them.

Anyway, be forwarned.  Out of the many people I have known, none of them
have used heavily and not had medium-big problems in their lives that
they would not have had, had they not been using heavily.

These are just some personal observations and experiences that I feel
are important to those less familiar to know.  And I should also add
that these are moderate to heavy users and I'm not some sort of crusader
because I've seen friends/family ruin their lives.  I even occasionaly
indulge myself.

Hello....

This may or may not be an off-the-wall question:

Does anyone out there know more information about this whole comets
colliding into Jupiter thing?  If so, what are the supposed effects
on us?  A strange related bit of information I  heard from a friend
in LA is that there have been dozens of people in the southern
California and Arizona areas that have reported swirving in their
cars because the passenger seats of their cars were possessed by the
"Angel Gabriel" saying that he will return on this Saturday (the
second coming?).  The friend who told me this claimed that it had
happened to her (she sounded VERY serious) and the cop who pulled her
over immediately let her off because she was the 8th person that day
to report it happening!

Well... when I refer to the stereotypes, I refer to the people who *want* to be
in those stereotypes, and who try to fill those stereotypes, not the people who
just happen to dress non-raveresque.  I personally look nothing like your
typical raver, and I'm sure that I could be classified as many things besides
that, but when I talk about "punkers", and refer to the stereotype, I refer to
people who are attempting to be and look like a punker.
hmm?

I think it is a bit unfair to call the Zippies greedy. This is not 
readily apparent to me from their publicity. i can understand a certain 
degree of skepiticsm regaring the matter but would also say that we 
should reserve judgement until we know a bit more. I know that one of 
the orignal zippies Fraser Clark is actually pretty cool. He has 
published a magazine called "Encyclopedia Psycedelica" since the mid 
'70's and also put out a colcool cd called "Shamanarchy In the UK". Two 
personal friends of mine have hung out/interviewd Fraser and have said 
that he seems to be reputable and knowledgable in various areas.

Just cuz there was a big thing in Wired (and other mags) doesn't mean 
there media mavens.

 KESEY PASSES MANTLE TO ZIPPIES

 Independence Day, 1994
 Boulder, Colorado

 The Zippy Pronoia Tour to US stayed in Boulder a little longer
 than intended,  causing speculation at their planned destination-
 the Rainbow Gathering in western  Wyoming.  By invitation from the
 Naropa Institute, the Zippies hosted a late-night  4th of July
 rave at the Boulder Theater, keeping them in Colorado an extra few
 days.   It was worth it.

 The Zippy event began after a performance by Ken Kesey and the
 Merry Pranksters, in  honor of Allen Ginsberg's 70th birthday and
 Naropa's 20th Anniversary.  A stunned  and revved-up crowd came
 together on stage to dance to the ambient sounds of the  Zippy
 group Universal Sound.

 Around three a.m., Kesey pulled from his parking space to find a
 crowd of Zippies  blocking his white Cadillac convertible.  A
 bespeckled Zippy stepped toward the car  and said: "Ken Kesey, the
 Zippy Pronoia Tour hereby kidnaps you for transport to the
 Rainbow Gathering-- a prank worthy of your pronoia.  Will you come
 along  peacefully?"

 Kesey paused and frowned as his posse of pranksters roared at the
 suggestion.  "I've  bitten the ankle of the beast," replied Kesey
 to the befuddled Zippies,  "Don't ask  me to bite where you want
 to bite."

 "What about inspiring the next generation?"  The Zippies asked.

 "I've done that movie... it's your turn." Kesey pronounced,
 roaring off in the Cadillac.

 The Zippies scratched their heads for a few moments, then piled
 into  their vehicles and called the Associated Press via cellular
 on the road to the  Rainbow Gathering.

 The mantle has been passed.
 _________________________________________________

 ZIPPIES SYNERGIZE WITH NATIONAL RAINBOW GATHERING
 July 6, 1994
 Big Piney, Wyoming

 The Zippy Pronoia Tour to U rumbled through the Wyoming
 wilderness to arrive at the  annual national rendezvous of the
 American Rainbow Family.  Late from a last-minute gig in Boulder
 with Ken Kesey and Allen Ginsberg, the Zippies had a good excuse
 for tardiness.

 Although the Rainbow Gathering had reached it's climax a few days
 before, the Zippies rallied some of the core 6000 Rainbows who
 remained to throw the first-ever rave at a Rainbow Gathering.
 During the last five years in Britain, the Zippies gained momentum
 and strength by  achieving "festi-rave crossover" between the UK
 rave and nomadic festival subcultures. The formula worked even
 better in America.  The hippy-ish Rainbows generally shun
 technology, but were drawn by the siren's call of the Zippy sound
 system set up by the main parking field.  The ambient Zippy set,
 mixed with tribal  drumming and vocals, kept the strange mix of
 dancers ecstatic through to sunrise.

 The Zippies joined the main circle of the Rainbow Council, ate
 some organic  vegetarian food, and huddled together with the
 American hippies during the cold  Wyoming nights.  A debate over
 the uses of technology and the purpose of media hype  continued
 around the campfires, from the original Rainbow/Zippy discussions
 begun in cyberspace in the spring.

Actually none of those people had any *interest* in conflict.

Their only interest was the love inside themselves and everyone else.

However, they did not *shun* conflict if it became necessary to
accomplish their mission.   To shun or exclude anything is to give it
importance...

Will--

I believe when they say "loss of interest in conflict" they are referring 
to people who look for a conflict to throw themselves into, or resort to 
negative things to solve their own frustrations.  One example of this 
might be a parent that comes home from work tired and stressed and yells 
at their children because they had a bad day at work.  Clearly there are 
many valid reasons to have a conflict.  But even Gandhi and the others 
you mentioned stressed non-violent conflict.  

So perhaps I would change that to "loss of interest in violent conflict", 
but that might be creating too hard of a dividing line.  Anyone is free 
to cut/copy/paste to their liking.

Whoops!  I should have proofread this.  Delete the "of", but keep the

Actually, that's a result of depleted serotonin, rather common, even more

Because it's very easy to classify someone when they want to be classified, no?
 Some people try to fill those stereotypes, and do a damn good job, so that
they're very easy to classify.

Well, a fellow here in town named Tim is throwing a party above 4000' so 
that a select group of groovers won't sink into the ocean like the rest 
of the west coast.  He's *guaranteeing* that he'll be beamed up that 
night.  How's that for promotion.  That's one hell of a visual, and "come 
to this party or drown" is a good tactic... :-)  This is my theory: He 
has somehow turned into memetic flypaper.  If you encounter him, he will 
lecture to you for hours on end about a massive all-inclusive conspiracy 
theory.  The only way to get out of listening to it is to walk with him 
as he explains the thing, find someone else, spend 15 minutes in a 
three-way discussion, then slip off, leaving the unsuspecting third party 
to handle him.  I'm quite convinced that he's been talking about it 
nonstop since the dead show :-)

Peace,
Matt

I've found that there are two types of people: those who like to classify
people and those who don't.  :)

I think maybe the Zippies are just people with a certain mindset who
are trying to belong, to define something so that others like them
have a point of reference.

The name "Zippies", however, is profoundly stupid sounding to me.
Whoever coined that term did a great disservice to those people s/he
were trying to categorize.

Actuallky the whole "Some Signs & Symptoms of Inner
Peace" is a disgusting mishmash of P.C. spirituality-
babble.  Christ, Buddhsa, Gandhi, etc., *were* interested
in coinflict, interpreting actions, not just letting
things happens--to name just a few that contradict this
contempo-Pollyanna list of New Age dicta.  The aim is to 
roll over--smile, don't worry, think and act spontaneously,
etc., which funnily enough I don't find as parts of the
work or teachings of Christ, Gandhi, Buddha and spirits like
them that I've studied and admired.

It draws hairs to say they were interested in "resolving
conflicts"  (plus that sounds too ombudsmanlike for these
guides). I much prefer what one of them said--and the others
echoed in various ways--that "you shall know them by their
works," so let's look carefully at the content, results and
sources of our sayings and not be so concerned about holding
to how right our list is. Another one of the three said that
there are no teachings to ultimately grasp hold of, there is
only the way, and a third said that his three greatest
obstacles were, first his favorite the British government,
second the intransigent Indian people, and third and greatest
he himself!

ciao,
Will

As I understand from reading and hearing the Zippies, it's
a name they apply to themselves.  We're not stereotyping
if we call people what they call themselves.  And  *that's*
the central point about stereotypes, to relate these two
current threads: if I call myself an Italian American it's
not good to call me a wop or dago or greaser or whatever.
If you look at me and call me an old fart, that compounds
the problem because not only is that not what I call myself
but you have abstracted one part--physical age in this
case--and applied it, disparagingly at that--to *all* of
me.  Thus the problem with "jock,"  "bubble gummer,"
"redneck," etc.  And there's a third troublesome area
with stereotyping and that's identification itself:
in reporting in the media even if terms like "white,"
"Mexican American," "black" or "African American" are
used they can be inflammatory because by abstracting merely
one aspect of a person's identity we reinforce already
culturally established notiions, that is, notions our own
culture has in a thousand ways already established about
categories, usually unconsciously and sometimes consciously.

Ciao,
Will

Ok... so I guess all the people who were against my classifying people, anre
trying to tell me that they've never classified people, is that right?  Well I
personally find this hard to believe.  However, the fact remains that there are
people who dress like "ravers", but the furthest thing from their mind is peace
and unity.  You can't tell me that there aren't people who go to a rave  solely
for the sake of picking up chicks/guys and/or getting soused.

We've gotten way off the topic...

I agree that the underground parties tend not to attract this kind of folk, and
there for are conducive to a happy-go-lucky, peaceful and united kind of vibe. 
If that's the message of raves in general, then I'm all for it.  I like to feel
that way too, you know!  It just saddens me and can be difficult to feel that
way, when you're at a club/rave and there's some slimeball hitting on every
girl in a halter top there!

> Actuallky the whole "Some Signs & Symptoms of Inner
> Peace" is a disgusting mishmash of P.C. spirituality-
> babble.  

Will, I think "disgusting" is a bit harsh.  I feel that it would be naive 
to view SS&SIP as a set of guidelines for how the human race should be.  
Such ideas work better (for me) as a description of a (sorely neglected) 
place in our psyche  where we can let go of our preprogrammed tendencies
to focuse on our differences and on the things that separate and create 
turmoil among us.  Raving is largely about letting go of the analytical 
planned-action judgmental pragmatic focus of our energies.  We may not be 
able to live our lives according to SS&SIP, but periodic shared immersions 
into these concepts, as one of many perspectives on life, would probably
be of some benefit to everyone.  I too cringe at the sound of Dogma
barking, but there are other ways of listening to these kinds of things.

Peace, er Action, or whatever works for you,

It seems to me that most of the things that i have heard about wicked 
were pretty negative.  That's wierd, it seems like most of you went to 
wicked already expecting it to be lame.  I was there and I thought that 
it was one of the better parties that I have attended in awhile.  I go to 
raves because I love the music and the people. I thought that dj Pierre 
was great, he kept me dancing for 2 hours, I thought that it was a real 
teat to finally hear what they are playing in other places.  

Thank you Wicked for brining out some new talent and for a night of phatt 
tunes.

Hi Folx--

Lee suggested my use of the word "disgusting" was 
"a bit harsh," and I agree. I must say that I also
agree that in general these kinds of lists are handy
to peruse from time to time as touchstones for our own
guidance.  I disagree with the general tenor of the
11 "Signs & Symptoms," however, in that for me they
don't jibe with my own sense of the feng shuy of
higher spirituality.  They definitely come from that
current school of thought that separates inner peace
from activism, moral indignation and creating the new
dualism of bliss/blitz vs. nonviolent resistance.  I'll
happily choose the latter every time if (as the list
makes clear) and when I see the former.  Actually I
like the unity and simplicity of "Do unto to others as
you would have them do unto you" the best!

ciao,
Will

hi j.c.--
 
No, the point *isn't* that we don't classify people;
it's to try to do it with intelligence and sensitivity!
 
Since the following is what you're concerned about, let's
hear you talking about:
 
> It just saddens me and can be difficult to feel that
way, when you're at a club/rave and there's some slimeball hitting on every
girl in a halter top there,
 
*That's* a *long* way from the kind of stereotyping and
namecalling that you were doing earlier!  Thank you!

Lee--
 
I didn't think your piece was bad writing(you seemed to indicate that
it wasn't clear or showed some other negative influence from computer
programming work.  If someone indicated that to you in private e-mail,
maybe that person has a reading problem.  I see these forums, like sfr,
as crucibles where we worrk out our concerns and issues through as open
communication as possible.  They're radically different from any medium
we've had before because of their use of cyberspace's virtual presence.
 
Someone recently put down Doug Rushkoff's "Cyberia," and it *is* an
uneven book in terms of depth of coverage and timeliness.  But one
of the nice things he does in one chapter in the book is present and
discuss some of the unique communicatioons situations that e-mail
and the internet pose.  If someone else knows some good sources or
points about this, please come out with them.  I believe a lot of
our "flame wars," "sysop pulling the plug," and general lack of under-
standing of each other in cyberspace are related to the everyday
communications conflicts we have but *some* are unique to this medium!
 
ciao,
Will

I don't like it because it's not true.  (True for me: I don't believe
in Universal Truth (tm).)


I don't want other people to treat me the way they want to treat each
other -- generally with bizarre politeness ritual, groundless
suspicion mixed with naivete, and overt hostility to difference.

I don't want other people to treat me the way I treat them, because I
am not presumptuous enough to set myself up as an example.

I want people to do WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT.  I'll tell you if I
have a problem, and then we'll work it out.

I've been on this list pretty much since it started and I think I need
to point out that historicly Wicked is THE commonly acknowledged rageing
party of parties.  It's only lately that the classic media phenomena of
a very vocal (or in this case of e-mail, textual) minority expresses
they're opinions so much that it starts to seem like a commonly held
consensus of everyone.  This, I think happens a lot around here with
other topics and ideas too and I think it's important to keep in mind
that we are an entity of 900 different people.  If 5 people mail you
and tell you they think you suck it may seem like "everyone" thinks
you suck but keep in mind that's just 5 out of 900 people!

I was born here in SF (at what is now CalPacMed) and I certainly don't feel 
threatened by the zippy folks. Things are only a threat if you let them 
suck you in, right? Is this much ado about nothing, or is some concrete 
threat involved?

Just MHO...

>From what I've heard, the comet was broken into smaller pieces by 
gravitational flux the last time it passed by Jupiter.  Consequently, 
there are several (a dozen?) smaller pieces due to impact and varying 
times.  I'm under the impression that it should be sometime over the 
weekend; accuracy is quite variable.  But we (on Earth) should be able 
to view the impact site within 8 hours of its occurrence.  Does anyone 
know what position in the night sky Jupiter occupies currently?  It 
seemed to me that it was somewhere a little bit east of due south when 
looking about 50 degrees up at 11:00-midnight...

   I'm glad to see that it only took you 2 and a half months to figure 
out that speed isn't the greatest things in the world to be involved in.  
That is if you have quit.  

   I was once hooked on the crap, weighed only ninety pounds, ate little 
and slept hardly at all.  I remember how it felt when i lost it, so to speak.
Now over a year latter, I am clean off speed  and  I have absolutly no 
reason to pollute my body with that poison.  Consider yourself lucky that 
you didn't end up strung out, with no money and no home.

  Quitting wasn't very hard and once you get past the three week bummer 
then everything really starts to look up.  You finally feel like a  human 
being and healthy and realize that, yes indeed there is more to life 
than finding the next line.

  Since ending this chapter in my life I have picked up record s in place 
of the straw and my life is a lot better as a result.  


  For someone who is wanting to stop the best thing to do is eat alot, 
take lots of baths, and take tyrosine, that will keep you from getting 
depressed (this cause a lot of people who are trying to quit from quitting).
Just think of how you are going to feel, when you want to go to sleep and 
you can and when your health finally returns to normal you'll be glad 
that you stopped.

As for partying, I have much more fun when I go out to partys, it is alot 
easier to make friends when you are not tweaking (inflating your ego).
most people that I know that still use this drug spend a lot of time 
talking but not listening and learning but when you are on speed you know 
everything; right?

I just wish that people would learn to slow down a bit and really enjoy life.

I don't even know how this happened, but somehow an item I posted ended 
up with Mark Guthries's name on it. I feel *extremely* bad about this,

i agree with susie about the zippy "movement."  the fact that they a re
trying to publicize their thang is a bad sign.  publicizing just brings
it to the attention of the authorities, necessitating such measures as
security, much more subterfuge for those who wish to indulge in mind
candy, etc.  in my experience, keeping parties hidden from view of the
general populace, which doesn't much approve of what we do for whatever
reasons, is a key element for success.

And I say:

I see these points but don't necesarily agree.  "They" (who seem to be a
rather nebulous entity) are just having fun throwing raves and traveling
around to see our country.  What's so wrong with that?  And since they
are a pretty nebulous group it could be said that anyone who attends
they're events is initiated as one of them ala "You will be assimilated.
Resistence is futile." {Oh shit, they've assimilated the Captain (Crunch)
already.  Can they be stopped?}  I think everyone is taking to seriously
and reading in all sorts of conspiracies and motives.  Were realy very
much the same.  How is our fairly public and advertised GG Park events
any different?  Were trying to show the public that were not so bad and
that were just into having fun and unity.

Anthrax also says:

 im trying to keep an open mind,
of course, but....if the zippies are primarily motivated by greed, then
i don't want to have anything to do with them.

And I'd like to emphasize:

This is how rumors start.  A couple people form express the (in my opinion)
premature and unfair view that they're greedy after reading something on
the net or having one personal experience with one person "claiming" to
be "affiliated" with them and then someone sees the above sentance and 
then when the conversation comes up sometime someone else says "Oh, I've
been hearing from multiple sources on the net that they're greedy".  And
then that person tells others in the next conversation "Oh, they're a
bunch of greedy fucks.", etc.  Let's keep this in perspective and keep
in mind that as far as I know only a couple of people out of 900 or so
have expressed that they think the zippies are greedy.  And I haven't
seen anyone else claim this in any magazines (Wired, etc.) or any where
else on the net.

I appologise for using you as the example, Ann, and I want to point out
that the above sentence does say "if" because she's not saying they're
greedy, shes just responding to what others have said but when people
see things like that in print a lot it starts to become credible 
because it starts to seem like a commonly expressed view.

This is kind of uncomfortable for me, but here goes:

Malachy borrowed Susan's $5,000 video projector, and has told her he 
would track it down. He hasn't called at all. Everett Zero has it, and he
has made excuses instead of delivering. He says, "Oh, you can get it *if 
I'm awake*", which is pretty lame. It is Susan's and my opinion that both 
of these folks have been very remiss in their dealings with us. Heck, 
it's been a *very* long time since we've seen the projector-- we really 
just kept thinking we'd give everyone involved some time to get it 
together. But instead of getting it together, they have flaked off and 
made bad excuses. 

I just thought that the list ought to know what's going on before we have 
that big we-love-Malachy fest this weekend. I know someone on the list knows 
how it feels... we're just lucky we weren't in physical danger like that 
person was.

Subject: re: Jupiter

I had a Piracitam-enhanced dream about 4 days ago that I did not think
much about until I started reading about these wierd things going on
as we approach the Jupiter-asteroid day.

First, let me note that when I take Piracitam, by dreams can be ultra-vivid,
making them seem like visions instead of dreams.  Usually, I only
have positive, wonderful dreams on it, but...

Okay, I was in a van, driving down a beach.  In the van with me was
most of my immediate and much of my extended family.  This was a beach
by a large city (like Santa Monica).  I looked up into the sky, and I saw
some cosmic body, it looked a lot like another earth.  I can clearly recall
seeing green land masses and blue oceans.  Suddenly, things started to
feel wrong.  About a mile ahead of us a jumbo jet crashes into the
beach in a burst of fire and light.  The ground shakes a little.
Everyone in the car is silent, looking at each other, but we all seem
to feel the same thing.  Not a feeling of death, but instead a feeling
that each of us, all the ones we love, and the entire world as we know
it was about to be obliterated, and there was nothing anyone could do about
it.  There was not time to scream, there was not time think.  The ground
shook a bit more, and I awoke.

...And on that note, have a fun weekend, everyone!!!

Greg et al:

Jupiter is currently visible at approximately 5 degrees Scorpio, which can
be found by estimating where the sun is currently (assuming it has set of
course) then adding about 120 degrees. For example, if it is midnight, the
sun is roughly 90 degrees below the horizon, or "at 6 o'clock" (not the 
time - the position relative to you if your position was the center of 
a clock). Every 30 degrees equals one hour on the clock, so Jupiter 
would be found "2 o'clock high" or at 30 degrees above the western horizon.


The first collision is expected on Saturday night with the largest 
fragment crashing into the Great One on Wednesday.  In any event, I 
expect the best views will come from the Hubble Telescope, which 
photographed the comet on it's next pass following it's being shattered. 
I have a pretty amazing JPG or GIF image made from composite Hubble 
photos of the same.  They're most remarkable, and I'd be happy to put 
them into the sfraves archives if someone will send me some data on where 
to upload and how.  I have full net capability with all of the basic 
protocols.

BTW, if anyone is looking for somewhere to go tomorrow (Friday) e-mail me
and I'll try comp you in at 1015 so long as my guest list holds out. 
There's a Tatoo Show upstairs in the Gallery and Zendada is in the
basement.  I'm still waiting for info on the dj lineup in the main room,
but will post again when I know it.

Well, this "current school of thought" is not really current, in fact it
is the oldest recorded thought, period.

The basic problem of activism is that it comes from the ego of "I know
what is best for everyone".

"Higher spirituality" consists of removing yourself from the limited,
closed-in perspective of your own ego, so that you can resume the
natural state of a higher perspective.

The "signs and symptoms" are simply a sign post of how you are doing in
that endeavor.

Christ, Buddha and Gandhi were all coming from that non-ego/self-less
perspective, and what they did was in the best interests of everyone.

Note that Christ refused to take part in any revolution against the
Romans, despite the oppression going on.  Not exactly an activist.

Buddha renounced his position as crown prince - a very influential
position - in order to seek enlightenment.

I don't see any inconsistency between bliss and nonviolent resistance,
especially when you consider that Gandhi did both.

If someone really feels there is an inconsistency, that would mean that
they come to raves, which are generally blissful and non-political, only
to distribute flyers and/or recruit people for causes...

Hi--
 
I'm planning on going to the ComeUnity thing (so
I hope all that business about the video projector
gets worked out!) and on Sunday to North Beach to
watch the Italia-Brasil World Cup Finals.  My friends
and I went to a cafe in No. Beach yesterday and partied
with the folx in the street for more than an hour--the
dancing, chanting and spirit were as high as at any
rave.  Then we went to Bahia restaurant and partied
afterwards with those folx for at least 3 hours--the spirit
and love and energy were as high as if not higher than
*any* rave I've ever been to!  Those Brazilians live
their lives like a party!  Hope to see you!
 
ciao,Will

That's *hardly* what "Do unto others as you would have them do
unto you," says, means or even by the most bizarre stretch of
the imagination can be construed to be interpreted as.  And yet
g has a point: countless millions of Christians and Buddhists
over the centuries have interpreted the owrds of *their Leaders*
to mean what he cavils against!  So, in a way, his concern is a
real one: even though the Buddha and the Christ did not intend
such spiritual gymnastics, at least some of those who read their 
words afterwards turned them into that.

g also sez:
>I don't want other people to treat me the way I treat them, because I
am not presumptuous enough to set myself up as an example.


Even without re-reading the line, we can see that it definitely
does *not* say this! Maybe too much Crowley has impeded reading

Ken sez--

>Well, this "current school of thought" is not really current, in fact it

It's *one* thing to demonstrate that something is true,
Ken, and another to just baldly state it as you do here.

If you're interested I'd like you to relate these 11
Signs and Symptoms to "the oldest recorded thought"
somehow.  I doubt tHat you can.

Both Jesus and Gandhi (and possibly Buddha) were
killed because they *were* activists, real threats
to the political status quo of their times.  Check
*your* sources on that!

Going to raves, indeed, frequently *is* a very
spiritual experience of the highest order.  It
can be demonstrated from some of the truly giving,
ego-less moments we'vw all shared there and on sfraves    
as well!  But it's not the kind of mindless bliss
that that list suggests, rather it's a truly mindful
state.

Finally, Ken sex--

I don't see any inconsistency between bliss and nonviolent resistance,
especially when you consider that Gandhi did both.
 
If someone really feels there is an inconsistency, that would mean that
they come to raves, which are generally blissful and non-political, only
to distribute flyers and/or recruit people for causes...


Well, never having flyered at a rave, I haven't thought about
whether that is an inconsistency or not, but I don't think it
is.

And my point was, in fact, that bliss and n-v resistance are
a unitary state--but I saw nothing in the list that suggested
that the conflict that n-v resistance engages is is okay, in
fact it says just the opposite!

Good discussion!  I think a lot of us are going beyond
waving our own private banners with this one--and that's
encouraging!

ciao,
Will

This is the second time I've seen posts regarding the projector.  The
first time, I mentioned to Everett the next day what I'd read, and he
explained that the projector had been dropped off by someone, whose
identity he did not know, at a place he was working in Santa Cruz.  It 
was apparently disfunctional at the time (why else would it have been 
abandoned for a year at a repair shop?).  In spite of his attempts to 
locate the owner, it remained a mystery until recently.  I do know that 
he had been in contact with Susan very recently, explaining the 
situation to her, including the fact that the owner of the place where it 
is in S.Cruz is on holiday, and I know that he offered to ride there with 
her to pick it up when the guy returns.  

To begin with, I know few places that one can abandon equipment for a year
and then show back up indignant and malicious toward the people who
*could* very easily declare it their own by that point.  (Have you ever
been in a repair shop that didn't post a notice re: at what point it was
their gear if you didn't resolve it???) Second, Everett is the one and
only person who has been able and willing to show up consistently, do what
he says, and miraculously repair old, worn-out, beat-up equipment used in
the operation of the sound and lightshow at 1015.  That is why I feel so
indignant.  I firmly believe him to be a man of his word, and resent the
tone and content of the original post.  Thirdly, it's pretty chicken-shit
to attack someone publicly in an arena that they do not participate in...
meaning: Everett does not have a sfraves connection , nor a computer,
which is why I am responding in his behalf.

At the very least, I would suggest some public apologies.  I suspect that 
Malachy's accident must have closely followed dropping off of the 
projector, so being a bitch to him is pretty irresponsible.  And as 
Everett seems to have made the effort to track down and help return what 
may-have-once-been a $5000, three gun projector (approx ten years ago I'm 
told), I find the malicious diatribe above to be the worst example of 
netiquette.

I guess I need to clarify here.  There are several reasons I don't want 
people to "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" -- at
least not near me.

1) All relationships are not symmetrical, where each person gives and takes
in the same way.
2) A world where everyone was like me would be both scary and boring.  I
don't want that.
3) I don't want to be constantly subjected to everyone else's idea of
a good time, either.  I do not enjoy many of the traditional rituals of
handshake, small talk, male bonding through sports, etc.
4) Let's say I'm really horny.  If I "did unto others etc." I'd be in jail
on rape charges, or in the hospital with major contusions.
5) Not to mention...

Um...what?  If I am treating others the way *I* want to be treated, I am
using myself as the desired model for human interaction -- and I don't
even believe that myself, much less want you to believe it.

Because of this, "Do unto..." is the most selfish philosophy possible.

Oh, *please*.  You're stereotyping as badly as the people we deride
here on the list for being closed-minded.  If I quoted H. L. Mencken,
would that make me a misogynist and fascist like him?  If I quoted
Thomas Jefferson ("That government is best which governs least"),
would that make me a supporter of the Three-Fifths Compromise?  If I
quoted Martin Luther King, would that make me black, or a minister?

If I quoted Nirvana in my .sig, would that make me a suicidal junkie
with bowel trouble?

If anyone still cares, I'm not a Thelemite, Taoist, SubGenius,
Buddhist, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Druid, Satanist, or anything else -- or
I'm all of them, if you count thinking "they're right sometimes"
as being a member of some club.  Crowley was a fuckup and a
junkie, but I don't have to be like him, and neither do you.  What he
was, was smart enough to see through the smoke and mirrors of most
'morality', even the 'nice' kind.

Don't forget to floss!

Regarding the cometary impacts on Jupiter, most likely, the bulk of the
 US populace will see nothing unusual about Jupiter from 16-22 July.
  Even astronomers with telescopes and detectors of every possible
wavelength directed toward Jupiter may see nothing unusual either, although
a faint fireball or two and distortions of the planet's cloud decks as seen
 in the infrared are supposedly possible.  Actually, there are some nice
simulations of some model predictions available from MOSAIC.  These are 
probably the most exciting things that anyone will see from this event.  I
(may be mistaken... but) think there are some satellites in
the area which will also be collecting radiative emissions from the event 
via CCD and/or IR spectroscopy.   

You can point out Venus during the early evening as a reasonably bright
object in the western sky but I  do not think Jupiter will be visible.  
Generally one needs a telescope (or so Galileo said...).

hi, my name is john, and i'm new to sfraves.
i'm in boston now, but i'm moving to sf at the end of august.
i'm also known as handi.
call me whichever you like.


this post sparked my interest, because one time after having a very pleasant
day on mushrooms, that evening when i went to bed...i smoked out...
and my dreams were very very very vivid.  i still remember.  this is what
i remembered:

i remembered these childhood storybooks that my brother and i used to have.
the characters were called fred and scott, and fred was supposed to be
my alter ego and scott was my brother's (fred is my middle name, scott is
my brother's name...see the connection?  i think it was one of those computer
generated story books that came out in the mid to late 70s.)  anyways, these
characters were these kind of dog looking like people with fred as the
big brother that could do no wrong and scott was the little brother that
looked up to big brother and thought he was so awesome.  big brother took
care of little brother.  very nice things...

anyways, when i went to bed, i had vivid visions of these 2 characters
jumping up and down in these poses and sort of doing these superhero
moves....like they were conquering evil.

anyways, after i had this vision, i really wondered if any of these books
ever existed at all.  because i can sort of remember them after the vision
and remember thinking of them in the past, but i'm really not sure they ever
existed.


the reason i spouted all of this was that i remember by friend had given
me piracetum when we ate the mushrooms.

but i have no idea if this is related....
(i don't know how piracetum works, if you need to build it up in your body
before it takes effect, whatever)...

but that's my related story.

Ahem... I wouldn't say that...    I met them in Wyoming,  told them about
my involvement in the rave scene and got noticed dancing my ass off
(trying to keep warm).

They were at my place this evening here in Mill Valley,  and I have to
admit,  they are a very interesting lot of people.   We talked about a lot
of interesting things,  and I was invited to speak at their Jupiter Bash
party this Sat evening.    They seem to have a LOT of support,   and
are VERY interested in setting up a "Home base" here in SF area.    They
are in close ties with the SPAZ group,   and seem to be genuinely interested
in keeping the rave scene alive.

Their music "Acid Techno trance" is slightly faster in tempo (145+ BPM)
but whort of the 160+ BPM "Hardcore".    I really like the music I've heard
from Universal Sound,  both at a private birthday party (Oh!  Happy birthday
Foster) at Foster's place last Tuesday evening.

So,  I see no reason to want to stop them,   instead we all should just try
and figure out what they are about.    They don't seem to be "Money grabbing"
types,   and I doubt if they would charge $20 for one of their gigs.

I think for those SFRavers who are skeptical,  they should try and attend 
their Jupiter Bash party this Sat and see for themselves.

Peace

I was at WIcked last weekend and had a swell time.  Sure, there was a long
line to get in and it was heck-a cold outside...Sure, there were so many
people it was very hard to dance....but I did notice that the midrange
and tweeters were placed above the crowd such that it wasn't unbearable.
The sound was better than at that 19th and Alabama spot by a mile.  To me,
it seemed like the vibe was also better here than there.  Actually, 
I experienced the best vibe within about a 10 foot radius of the DJ booth.
It sort of peeked around 6am, as people cleared out of this 10 foot area,
leaving just about a square foot more room for each person and then all these
smiles just came out and it was great.  

As for the music...Sure, nothing mind-blowing, but everyone was still into
it around the "hot spot" giving out whoops and cheers when they felt that
surge of energy you feel when the DJ brings the energy up a notch with
just the right transition.

One thing that I saw that really sucked was the parking around 3rd st.  
Apparently they have a new policy on street cleaning on that street not
just tuesday and thursday, but EVERY day from 2am to 6am.  so basically a
whole bunch of people had to pay $20 tickets for missing the new sticker
on those signs... beware.

hi g// and other folx--

As a professional writer, editor and teacher of 34 years,
I must say it makes me feel good to see you clarifying
yourself, carrying on real discourse and not falling into
that all-too-American syndrome (imnduced largely by our
mass media that just wants us to roll over and buy) of
being just pissed off by real discussion of importaNT ISSUES.

I'm not going to reply to any of the good points you raise
now; it's 1;15 a.m., and I'm sure others will, too, but
we are all showing how and why Internet newsgroups are the
cutting edge of the information explosion: we're actually
having some real dialogue, not just passively accepting
what's put out there, which is what we're mainly "educated"
and trained for in our consumerist culture.

Early on as a teacher I learned the easiest way to make
students *hate* writing is to do what still too many
teachers do: bleed over papers with a red pencil, 
paying attention to spelling, mechanics and usage but
seldom interacting with the content.  Such red-pencil 
editing is the *last* step in the writing process, not 
the first and only one, as too many students experience    
throughout their education. And it only reinforces wha
the media tells us subliminally: your ideas don't
matter and if you think like other people rather than
for yourself you will be healthy wealthy and wise.
Bullshit!

Every now and then (and I expect it any mnute now on
sfr) some people get mad about these thread that have
*nothing* to do with raves, raving and rave culture.
Bullshit again!

ciao,
Will

P.S. My "follower" line to you, g, about Crowley
I admit was provocative bait, so forgive if you
can another admirer of The Great Beast when he
saw some wonderful sentiments that, no matter what
I may say, still fire and illumine the spirit
albeit not in the same way as they did once.

Perhaps I need to make myself clearer.  What I am trying to say is why be 
so concerned with what other people are doing?  Unless those punkers you 
are referring to are doing something specific to you to interfere with 
your space, then why expend the energy even talking about them?  What 
someone looks like or the stereotype they fill often has very little to 
do with the person inside.  This is why I say "why classify?"  
Classification requires too much energy for me.  Maybe you could give me 
some good reasons why I should classify people.

Kerry, in response to your comments on "the projector thing" --

susan here:

fact: i did not "drop off" my beloved video projector at some two-bit chop
shop in santa cruz a year ago. i don't even know where the fucking place
is (can *somebody* please tell me -- i'll be there within hours). what i
*did* do was entrust something i could ill afford to lose to someone i
barely knew (malachy) on the basis of good vibe alone, and am now reaping
the usual and customary benefits of such an action. silly me.

fact: when my projector "once-was" a $5000 machine (in *perfect* working
order) was approximately two years ago (it was *one* year *new* at that
time) when i turned it over to the "patriarch" of the house scene.

fact: when i finally was able to get in touch with malachy, last month,
(i didn't want to push it until then, because i knew he had far bigger
things to worry about, so i hesitated to contact him until i had exhausted
all other options) he said he would look into it and get back to me in a 
week or so -- again, i took him at his word -- he did'nt.

fact finale: when i ultimately traced the projector to everett, we set up
several appointments, which fell through for reasons which were out of 
his control, except for the one where he simply chose to sleep in while i 
waited by the phone all day for him to call. for this he apologised, and 
i heartily accepted his apology, being eternally grateful for the tender
loving care i know he has given the projector since it was dumped on his
doorstep by goddess-knows-who goddess-knows-when. i have expressed this 
gratitude to him every time we have spoken, and told him that when this
was all over i wanted to treat him to the dinner of his dreams, or whatever
special treat he could think of, to repay him for his kindness. talking 
to him, he does not seem like the type of person who would willfully blow 
someone off, but i have left him numerous messages since our last 
conversation, all saying something to the effect of "i'm totally flexible 
as to when we go to santa cruz, but please just call and let me know 
what's up", and i haven't heard a word from him, and i'm just kind of 
freaking 'cause he's my only connection to my projector. so, when maui 
offered to post a message regarding the situation, i told her to go for it.

yes, we are frustrated.

we are both relatively new to sf but old to the scene, and we've never 
encountered a situation like this before. we both believe in giving 
people the benefit of the doubt, and i think the fact that we have put so 
much trust in people we barely know is testament to this, but if you were 
us, how would you feel? it's gotten to the point where we can only 
believe in what we see -- and one thing we don't see is our projector.

we were both under the impression that everett *was* on the net and both 
posts were made in the hope that he would see them, in the (unlikely) 
event that he has not gotten my numerous messages. i assure you that 
nothing was meant to be said behind anyone's back. to be sure, i would 
welcome any communication from everett. i want nothing more. i'm sure one 
phone call from him would clear up any misunderstandings, and if you 
could persuade him to *make* that phone call i'd be forever in your debt! 
                                                  respectfully,
                                                  susan

ps: regarding the condition of the projector, it was in positively 
flawless condition last time i saw it, but i would gladly reimburse 
everett, parts and labor, for any work he has done on Betsy. the offer of 
dinner still holds and, kerry, you're welcome to join us.
                                                  peace.

Just the opposite!

Does this sound right - "Hillary Rodham Clinton and Eleanor Smeal are
not interested in conflict or interpreting actions, they just let things
happen".
No way! :-)  "Some Signs & Symptoms" is definitely not P.C. :-)

In P.C. if there is one oppressed cockroach somewhere, then an entire
campaign of angry letters to congressmen is required, plus daily
appearances in all the media. :-)

It comes froms the Vedas, estimated to have been written roughly about
10,000 years ago.

It would take some hours of research to rigorously demostrate this. I'll
seen what I can dig up that might be less rigorous...

No, I just mentioned in the last message that Jesus refused to be an
activist.  In fact, that was why he was killed.  As long as everyone is
distracted by the Judaea vs. Rome, Clinton vs. Bush, etc. then the
status quo is NOT threatened.  What is threatening to the status quo is
that Jesus and Gandhi asked people not to be selfish, to love/help your
neighbor.  Gandhi was killed AFTER his non-violent campaign caused the
British to give India its independance.  He was killed because he THEN
started advocating that Hindus and Moslems love each other and get along.

The whole idea of being ego-less and self-less is very threatening to
both individuals and the status quo.

Okay, could you list what on the list strikes you as "mindless"?
This could be semantics, really.  In order to be truly mindful, ie in
the sense of aware, you have to turn off your "mind", ie the chatterbox
in your head...

I re-read the list after reading this point and, really, the only one
that refers to this whole discussion is that same one:

6.  Loss of interest in conflict.

Whereas Tony posted that the problem is in the term here "conflict", I
think that the crucial word is "interest".

In the ego-less state one has no interest in conflict.  If, however,
circumstances dictate that conflict is the necessary and proper course
of action, then conflict is not shied away from.  To shy away from
something, is actually to be interested in it, in that one is interested
in avoiding it.  If one neither embraces nor avoids something, one is
not interested in it.

Indeed, someone who was interested in conflict would have no reason to
resort to "non-violence".

It's true, I have "classified" before.  I guess I have been learning

I am going to tell you about my friendy and what she did to one of 
those guys at a Vision party recently.  She was dancing and one of those 
guys started talking to her, and he was obviously being very forward to 
her.  I can't remember exactly what she said or did to him, but instead 
of telling him to fuck off, she sat down with him and explained to him 
why his behavior toward her, point by point, was inappropriate.  Instead 
of completely turning him away, she gave him the opportunity to look at 
himself.  Jesus, I get upset, too when I see people treating raves like a 
meat rack, too, but after this experience, I now have hope that this can 
start to change.

( Previous messages in thread too long and convoluted to include, but 
available on request ;-)  )

Susan, Maui, and sfravers, 

Thanks for your sweetness and patience during my earlier fiery diatribe.  
I have nothing involved here other than my appreciation for Everett's 
having made my work once again a joyful non-stressful experience, yet I 
very much appreciate Susan's well-spoken response.  I have spoken to 
Everett this evening, and am confident that the matter will be resolved 
as soon as the owner of the studio returns from his vacation. (Everett is 
of the opinion that it should be any day now.) 

To my knowledge, Ev has never had net access.  He recently lost the Haight
Street space where he lived and worked, and is currently staying with a
friend while doing what he can to help keep 1015's technical environment
functioning. This has been fiscally difficult as we are still under siege
from the City of San Francisco and the Irish-Catholic dominated Police Dept
which seems to be working in collusion with the Catholic Church's efforts to
develop the real estate next-door to us.  If it weren't for his efforts, 
I can assure you that your next visit to the club would have been at best 
disappointing.

Sorry for the flaming response, but glad it all is working out.  Please 
contact me if you lose touch with Ev'again.  BTW, I couldn't recommend a 
better tech should the proj need help.  Having been a club tech for 18 
years, I've had more than my share of 3-beam projectors and can tell you 
that they tend to be problematic, but generally have small part failures 
that only require lengthy diagnostics (as opposed to expensive Japanese 
parts).  Hope it's that or better... maybe we'll laff about it all over a 
nice meal soon.  Peace....................................Kerry

Ken sez--
 
It will take him "hours of research to rigorously demonstrate"
that the Signs & Symptoms list comes from the Vedas!
 
THIS I'll gladly wait to see! As a student of the Vedas myself,
it's hard for me to see how things like #5, 6, 7 and 11 come
from the Vedas.
 
Then he says that "Jesus was killed because he refused to be
an activist...(to be) distracted by the Judaea vs. Rome" thing.
 
Wrong!  Remember when he said "Render unto Caesar the things that
are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's"? THIS really
set the (then P.C.) Herod-Pontius Pilate crowd off because they
could see how these kinds of teachings were a real threat to their
status quo collusion of the religious leadership in Judaea with
the Roman colonial government.  When given the chance to kill
Jesus or the most heinous criminal, it's not surprising they had
Jesus the "rabble-rouser" killed!
 
Ken also asks if I "could list on the list what strikes you as
'mindless'?"
 
I did that in my first post responding to this list.  Let me say
again that the discussion about how the "ego-less state one has no
interest in conflict" has become so convoluted and dualistic that
it has lost any meaning. Conflict is an integral part of life, of
growth, spiritual, mental, physical or any other kind I can think of.
 
Finally, Ken lists Clinton and Smeal his idea of who the P.C. ones
are.  Well, P.C. is relative to your point of view.  If you like
Rush Limbaugh, he'd be your P.C. point man; or if you're against
his type of politics you's sneer at his P.C. right-wing perspective.
In New Age circles I've seen lists like this list held up before
as guides for right livelihood, not people like the
two above!

Jesus Christ, the Inquisition, the Crusades, witch burnings, the war
on homosexuals...

Where do we draw the line between crime and immorality? 

Too bad the Oceana project died. It would have been interesting to

Are you the one responsible for tomorrow's party?

We would like to tape it (audio) fpr a couple of reasons.

We have tape of Carlos, Tony, Dutch, and Bones spinning in the second room at
last year's come-unity(4-17-93).

We have taped dj Dan and Tony before---they know that our intentions are good
and positive.

We are friends of the members of dubtribe, and know that their
contribution to this party will help make it one we'll want to remember
and have in our collection.

We would like to send Malachy home with an entire set of our recordings taped
at the parties thrown in his behalf. The tape from
last year was very representative of the local scene's vast diversity
and this party's line-up promises to deliver the typical come-unity
intensity.

We would also like to distribute a few free copies to friends and interested
people(that's what we do with 'em)...

We have had some difficulty in the past getting permission to tape dj's such
as Garth, Jeno
           oops
Simon, and that whole group of otherwise killer dj's. while we understand
that they sell tapes, we aren't looking to undermine their income source. We
distribute to friends and 
people who would otherwise not have access to the music.

We do not want special privelages. We'll gladly pay to get into the party,
especially to benefit Malachy, a true friend to the entire house nation.We
are not "guest-list groupies".

Please consider our request.
We have placed this post in sfraves in case Martin's indeed not the big
Kahuna behind come-unity. Please point us in the right direction if you
can...

peace and love

let's faceit, folx, EVERYONE makes some sort of stereotyped, cubbyholed,
  categorical assumption about EVERYONE ELSE he/she sees, hears, hears about,
    or reads about, as soon as there is any sensory input whatsoever,
      round the clock, asleep/awake/whatever...
your brain is always working, always trying to hook things together, trying
  to make some sense of what your eyes see.

most people dress/look the way they ARE.  nowadays, with so many hundreds of
  types of races/creeds/lifestyles/etc all squnched together in urban areas,
    there's not enough time for your brain to fully assimilate ALL THE FACTS
      regarding any one person of interest, especially when passing peeple
        on the street.  that's all there is, pure and simple; so naturally,
          the brain lumps each person into some sort of category which each
            of us has pre-prepared for that type of person.
one of my personal foibles is always lumping pinstriped-suit peeple into the
  conformist-stiff-old-and-greedy category, which is absolutely silly. we all
    have one or more 'pet peeve' type of person out there who, we think, is
      not doing everything they should to be the wonderful person that we
        think they should be... SO, the ol' brain goes to work and that
          person's attributes suddenly all FIT into the category we have for
            that type.

needless to say, with 5 billion people, there's gotta be some repeats, or
  darn near-misses, of groups of people who act, think, look, etc. alike.

  still, we're all different, we still don't even know if we all see the same
    color when we look at a flower...

   if you think yer immune to this categorizing, take a good look at everyone
    you see on a busy street, and listen to your mind.  it'll be making all
     sorts of conclusions about EVERYONE you see.  your internal detail
      filter usually turns off the screed, but if you listen real hard, it's
       all there...

   so, maybe instead of altering human nature, it's just a matter of 
    thinking a bit more about what your subconscious says before you talk
     or act, so you can give yourself a bit more time to form some sound
      conclusions about the other people you form opinions on.

am i talking crap or whut??

No, not crap.:)  I read somewhere, maybe a psychology text or
something similar, that one of the main motives behind stereotyping is 
to define the unknown.  The brain needs to have a definition for things
and a classification to help figure out where to store information.
The problem with stereotyping is when a person doesn't let go of
his/her preconceptions when given an opportunity to explore the real
thing.  This leads to a very limited understanding of ones environment.

We classify much more than people it is something that we do to just 
about all of our experiences.  I have stereotyped every plant that looks
even remotely similar to poison oak as being dangerous.  I have done this 
for my own safety because I am extremely allergic to poison oak.  But 
when I found out that one of these plants wasn't dangerous and
actually produces sweet fruit I enjoyed that fruit.

Take care.

These people personally caused very little trouble.  The horror comes
when other people sacrifice their own Will to that of another, and the
power of the individual becomes the power of millions.

Anyone who practices "Do what thou etc." will not be suckered by
subterfuges like organized religion and patriotism -- they are simply
tricky ways other people have come up with to try and get you to do
what _they_ want instead of what _you_ want.

Note that all the above "evil" people or groups were pushers of either
religion or the state.  Both offer the illusion of comfort and safety
in return for freedom; your Will, or, as some put it, your soul.

"Those who are willing to give up essential liberty to gain a measure of
 temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."   -Ben Franklin

No, you're absolutely right.  Any time we recognize anything, we are
'stereotyping'.  It's like the old saying, "If it walks like a duck, 
quacks like a duck, ..." then I probably won't bother to dissect it just
to find out if it _really_ is a duck or not.

Harmful stereotyping happens when (as you pointed out) your initial
judgement based on first contact keeps you from learning based on
further contact.

If I say "All purple people are stupid", I'm stereotyping.  If I say
"All purple people are _not_ stupid", then I'm still stereotyping
because I've never seen a purple person -- though the assumption may
be more reasonable.  I have no idea whether purple people are smart or
not, and I don't really care, because it doesn't matter to me.  Same with
O.J. Simpson and U.S. foreign policy -- I have absolutely no data except
what newspapers and the government told me, so what business do I have
deciding others' lives, even if my opinion _did_ matter?

It's amazing how much time I have to do stuff and have fun once I started
mostly ignoring popular culture and other spectacles.

:) We were most delighted by your answering post :)

I'm sure now that this will be well-handled, and I look forward to 
meeting you face to face. I hope that Everett's troubles will be soon 
resolved, and I know what you mean about 1015. It's been a while since 
I've seen police fascism this extreme...

We're doing well in making fine distinctions, folx,
because what SCRUTON@JOYCE and then Candice are
talking about in their recent addition to the dis-
cussion on stereotyping is the important notion of
discrimination, which is the practice of prejudicial
categorization, and discriminating, which is judicial
or finely discerning differentiation.  Sounds simple
but it isn't; to some they seem the same but they aren't.
The diff?  Basically, our application ofr our experience,
observation, perception and interpretation.

Hi Sean--
 
I liked your post, but the one thang I couldn't
understand was your inclusion of Jesus:
 
> Jesus Christ, the Inquisition, the Crusades, witch burnings, the war
> on homosexuals...
 
Granted that people have done those things that follow his
name in his name, but that's also true of Buddha, M.L. King,
and M.K. Gandhi, so...,maybe this brings us back to the thread
that SCRUTON@JOYCE, Candice and I had about discrimination vs.
discriminating.  That is, how do our intentions (intentionality)
fit in with our words and actions?

The party is still on for tonight.  We have an upper peninsula location
and also a trustworthy backup site.  Bryce says we are aiming to start
after 10, and as usual we'll stop when it gets to the point that if any
more people leave it will be too much work to clean up and load the gear :-)
Directions will be posted after 8 pm, call (415) - 985 - 5244 or finger this 
account.

on rave ethics: as far as I can see, the only "universal ethic" of raving 
is to respect everyone for the common purpose of dancing.  Everything thing 
else (spirituality, politics, etc.) comes from individuals and is 
variable depending on who you ask. I, personally, tend to bring alot of 
this sort of thing in to our m.e.s.s. parties, but that's just our sound 
system, *not* raves in general.
as for "Do unto others...": don't deny yourself in favor of others, and 
don't deny others in favor of yourself.  or, Do what you want, but don't 
hurt anyone. I believe that provides for balance, IMHO.

love,
whitsitt

p.s. Just in case that comet does obliterate us all on Saturday night, 
thank you all for a wonderful time.  The parties have been real nice... :)

That is a distinct possibility,   but later this evening,  I get
a call from Frazer Clark that they are still checking out their OWN
space for a party.   So the rumours are still pouring in,   and
we shall see what we shall see....

Anything goes....

Whoa, we're not even talking the same genre here.  I even thought this
was in a different thread.

The above is basic ethics.

The Signs and Symptoms of Inner Peace is the relationship between me,
myself and I :-).

Universes apart.

I don't yet have the time to find my Upanishads to rigorously document
this, so I'll just go from general memory.

>5.  Loss of interest in interpreting actions. [of others]

What others do is irrelevant, everything of value is within yourself, so
all that you need to do is focus on the love within yourself (atman).

All actions of others are due to karma [perhaps messages on
hyperreal.com are due to hyperkarma :-) :-)].  Their karma, in turn, is
due to their actions.  Escaping this vicious circle is only through
focusing on the love within yourself.

>6.  Loss of interest in conflict.

Same answer as for 5.

>7.  Loss of ability to worry.  (this is a very serious symptom)

When you are focused on the love within yourself, what possibly could
there be to worry about?  If you say "but what if" or "but what about",
then that consists of a lack of focus.

11.  Increasing tendency to let things happen rather than make them
happen.

This is the more esoteric one (perhaps that is why it is at the end).
The mystics all describe that when they let go of their own petty
desires, and aligned themselves with the love within, then things happen
of their own accord, without their own puny intervention.  When they
aligned themselves with the love within (atman), they automatically
aligned themselves with the world (brahman, Gaia) and being aligned with
the world, things in the world happened in alignment with them in return.

Yes.  This paragraph is more evidence in support of my position :-).  I
was going to put in this paragraph, but I didn't want to make the post
too long.

>Remember when he said "Render unto Caesar the things that
>are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's"?

The previous sentence is "Whose face is on this coin?" "Caesar's".

The meaning of this is (in the context of the taxation without
representation of 2000 years ago) that there is no point in contesting
worthless material things.  The "things that are God's" are the
spiritual things - Peace, Love, Unity, Respect.  Elsewhere Jesus says
"my two commandments are Love God and Love Your Neighbor".  So, it's
PLUR for God and PLUR for your "neighbor".  (How you interpret "God" is
your own personal choice.)

The other jews were upset that he refused to lead a activist rebellion
against Rome, so when the high-priests (jewish establishment) made the
Romans arrest him, no one came to his aid other than his disciples.

Then Pontius Pilate asked him "Are you the King of Jews", he answered in
such a seemingly vague way that, after some further questions, Pilate
announced that he could find no crime.

NOT!  Whereas you definitely COULD use P.C. to describe those things
that right-wing republicans automatically assume are true, it just isn't
done.  Useage in the 90's refers to left-wing liberal rigidity and lack
of a sense of humor about their objectives; it especially refers to
where institutions try to prevent speech that says anything about a
specific group of people (cf the concurrent 'stereotyping' thread on
sfraves :-) :-) ).

>In New Age circles I've seen lists like this list held up before
>as guides for right livelihood, not people like the
>two above!

NOT!  Please excuse the stereotyping :-) but New Age overwhelming
consists of people who have the same PC speech taboos described above
and are VERY MUCH in favor of activism for left-wing liberal causes.

The Signs and Symptoms is very much at odds with the New Age - which is
one reason why it fits raving so well :-) :-).

New Agers are ALWAYS interpeting EVERYTHING :-).  They're ALWAYS
WORRYING :-).  They're ALWAYS acting due to fears based on past
experiences.   And they're ALWAYS judging their self. :-)

respect,

a great vibe at the last one and I hope we can get even more people and 
energy out tonight.  Spinning the tunes are: Laura, Bryce, Lee and Me and 
perhaps some others :)

   Btw, be sure to find the guy in the yellow shirt and blue sweat

I challenge anyone to come up with a more concise and useful definition
for the following terms:

Q: What is a "right"?
A: An expectation that someone else will behave in a certain way.

Q: What is a "moral"?
A: My justification for demanding a "right".

> >How about people can do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe
> >on the rights of their fellow humans and respect each other--a basic
> >tenant of humanism.

The concept of a "right" rests on a foundation of morals, without
which it is simply an expectation.  Since I do not believe in absolute
morals, I therefore do not believe in any sort of privilege given to
a certain set of expectations called "rights" over simple preferences.

It would, therefore, be meaningless for me to claim any authority other
than my own for my "rights", whatever I consider those to be.  I do
not expect others to cater to my whims, and I do not wish to cater to
theirs -- however, there are organizations called "governments" which
find it good business practice to impose the whims of some group on 
everyone else, whether those whims be sodomy laws, liability laws,
the concept of "trespass", universal health care, the concept of the
automobile as the ideal form of transportation, or subsidies for 
overpopulation of the biosphere.

If "my rights stop where your rights start", who gets to draw those lines?
Maybe it should be you rather than someone else.  After all, there is no
one better qualified than yourself to judge.

Some may object that such a philosophy, if applied, would result in
people running amok in the streets, killing or kidnapping and torturing
them for no reason at all, fighting each other out of blind hatred, ...

in other words, just like the present except you don't have to worry 
about drug busts, police raids, a trillion-dollar machine 
that props up dictators across the globe with your money, or timber
companies being paid to run roads into old-growth so they can send 
virgin pulp to Japan, ...

and who knows?  Maybe if more people took responsibility for their own
actions, and had the freedom to do so, we would fulfill our basic needs
of love, food, and shelter _first_ instead of last -- and then we could
explore the mysteries of our chaotic existence from a position of
ultimate strength instead of weakness and dependency on those who use
our energies to maintain the status quo.

"...and then I shall be free to pursue truth in one body and soul."
	-Rimbaud

 Sean said it all - SPAZ was great ( what I saw of it - I was there
from about 10PM to 12:15AM ). My wet tissue earplugs proved themselves
yet again - a DAMN loud system. Once I reduced the volume , the sound
seemed clean and undistorted for the most part.

 I must go again sometime ( maybe at a larger venue ? or are they
committed to 60 6th street for awhile? ).

  Another great night! And a great start to what I hope will be a much 
better weekend then last. Anyways, Liquid * proved once again that 
strange music can bring people together.  We had the usual SF-Raves crowd 
and their friends, plus the beer drinkers from down the beach.  With the 
exception of a few shady characters, the drunks danced among everyone 
else and added quite a few extra bodies to the party.

  Many many thanks to Laura for finding such a good spot. Although you 
may not have to worry about the homeless charging you for parking, you 
might have to worry about the drunks pulling the plug out of your 
generator. Other then that, a wonderful and slightly warmer spot then 
24th and Il.

  It was great to finally hear Lee and Tamara, both who spinned smooth as 
silk. Unfortunatley because of some generator problems Bryce was unable 
to make DAT's of the whole evening.... sigh... perhaps some other time.

  Finally, I had a great time and my friend, Drew, also had a wonderful 
time.  Was real nice to look up from the mixer and see so many people 
going bezerk!  Hope to see some of you at Come-Unity... Anyways, I just 
got home and am starting to slur my text, so I better get some rest.. 

-=*Ernie (deaks@netcom.com)

 p.s.

  I finally got to Costco and stocked up on blanks, and also finally 
finished BOTH sides of my tape.. So for all those people who have been 
waiting so long (especialy RobertJ) I will be sending the tapes out on 
Monday and Tuesday and I might bring some up tommorow if I meet any of 
you at C-U...

 After SPAZ , Raffaela & I drove to Liquid *. A nice site , like 24th
and Illinois in that it's located in an industrial area and is next
to the bay. We got there at about 12:45AM , and Lee Ahn was spinning
some nice music.

 It turned out that the isolated partying possibilities of the area
was known to other folks as well. A "kegger" party was occuring about 
a quarter mile away from us, and the attendees of both parties were 
using the same parking lot. Isolated individuals from the kegger came
over to check us out , some of those danced with us for a space.

 The first negative intrusion of "keggers" occured during Lee Ahn's set.
Four of them came down and stood to the side between the DJ table and
the generator. They lit a bottle rocket , made some mocking attempts
at duplicating our dancing , and started a mini-mosh-pit between 
themselves( stomping on someone's shirt in the meanwhile.). I think 
they also decided to test the flamablity of their plastic
beer cups. I made a hasty intervention when they started to mess with the
power cord running from the generator - seems they had almost tripped 
on it, and were wondering what it was.

 As they finally decided to leave , one of them decided it would be 
'fun' to diconnect our power cord - to our consternation. As they left,
there was an exchange of words between them , Bryce , and Laura 

 I don't know about anyone else , but it took about an hour before
I got my "good vibe" feelings back. Return they did though , thanks to 
Ernie's music.

 Then the "keggers" came back , about seven of them this time , one of
them a gal in a blanket. From what I could tell , the same asshole who 
cut our power decided that throwing pebbles at us would also be "fun" -
I don't think he hit anyone before he stopped. Four of them came down
to us again , at the other side of the DJ setup this time. They did a 
little moshing/bumper car stuff again , hung around some more, then
left to go back to their party. As they left , Mr. Asshole tossed one 
last pebble at us again ( he missed again , I think ).

 Well , this spoiled my "vibe" for sure. I started patrolling around ,
trying to make sure that nothing bad started. About 45 minutes after the 
last "invasion" , I think I saw three of our obnoxious neighbors drive
off , Mr. Asshole among the three. 

 It seemed that the other party was composed of a variety of individuals 
with an apparent age and intoxication spread which was much wider than
the first assumption of "high schoolers". One of them , a short-haird
guy in his late twenties or early thirties , whith a vauge "cop" feel
to him , stood on the ridge over our party , just listening to
Laura's set. I talked to him a bit , invited him to dance , but he just
wanted to listen. Later , he left in an RV with three other folks from 
his party.

 Great music by Laura!


 I think the keggers/SFRavers relationship turn to something most
positive in two stages. The first stage was the arrival of Matt , a 
thoroughly plastered fellow "from Coyote Point , dude". He had gotten 
a cigarette from one of our folks , and was negotiating the profoundly
complicated task of getting it lit. I tried to oblige , but the cigarette
just wouldn't light. It was then I noticed that he had put it in his
mouth backward - filters don't burn well. He got another cigarette , and
successfully got it going. It was then that some more Liguid * folks walked
up to us and offered the fellow a smoking bomber of a joint , which he did
not seem displeased to see. Matt , the happy drunk , soon joined us down
in the dance area.

 He had mentioned that the keg was empty , and his friends were going to 
be carrying it by any time . As I stood on the plateau above our party,
I did see three folks with a squat shiny object. Through some impulse (
maybe I wanted to make things "better" ) , I decided to go talk to them.
Maybe I was encouraged that one of them was a gal. 

 One of them did a semi-apology for having "a lot of drunks", I took that
in the best light, and kept on chatting. I wanted to tell them that Matt
was with us - a guy in no shape to drive or maybe even walk alone. So,
Matt's friends decided to check him and us out .

 "Is this a pay admission thing?"

 "Oh no , we're , like , a club - we just wanted to have a LATE party ."

 So , they came down to join us and find Matt - bringing the empty keg
and their little boom-box. I left and rejoined the party a few times ,
as I was watching the parking lot , since they were expecting some folks
in an RV to come back and pick up the keg and them. I wanted to tell 
their drivers where they had ended up. Of course , this would have been
unecessary - I could hear them whooping from the parking lot. The times
I returned to the party , the keggers seemed to be at a happier level -
and , accordingly , the SFRavers around them. The funniest part was when 
they used their Maglites as strobes!

 Poor Matt fell over some stuff near the DJ table  ,but seemed none the 
worst for it . At that , our visitors decided to leave us - to grins 
( many of relief ) all around.

 There's a story ( probably apocryphal ) about a primitive self-help
treatment for a troubled mind. The patient is supposed to lug a huge rock
up to the highest local point, and then toss the heavy damn thing away.
The physical feeling of relief is supposed to transfer to a mental
relief. Well , I felt just like that fabled primitive when those guys 
left - just like I had heaved a great big problem away off a cliff! I was
bouncing like a rubber ball! Wheeeee!

 I don't know if it was a concious thing by Laura , or just my carefree
mood , but the music seemed to jump up another positive notch at the
same time. 

 After doing some more working out , it was time for me to call it quits.
Raffaela and I left during Ernie's set - I hope Liquid * closed safely
and joyfully!

( PS - Thanks to Laura for finding the new location. Thanks again to her
  and the rest of the DJs for the great music! And thanks to Bryce for 
  the sound system! )


( PPS - Nice to meet the SFRavers I know , and some new ones! Now , I'm
        going to bed! )

  Someone pointed out to me that I should ask now if anyone would like
 to do some spinning at the SFR picnic at Sunnyvale Baylands Park , on
 Saturday afternoon, August 20th. 
 
  It takes about an hour to get to the park from San Francisco , for those  
 who may have other commitments that night and have to time the ride. I
 plan to have the picnic from 1PM to 6PM or 7PM , depending on the 
 attendence.
 
 
  So , if that doesn't clash with your schedule , and you'd like to 
 spin , drop me a line!

 	Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com
 
 PS - I could also use a shade canopy , if anyone's got one. One big enough
 to shade the DJ and the turntables.

I was watching CNN (to check out the comet collision thingie) and saw our
very own Brian Behlendorf (representing Wired Magazine) who got his very
own 15 second video-byte during an report on pornography on the
internet. Something about a case at Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Labs where an
employee got suspended for putting up nudie pictures on what appeared to be
the web. He said something about "in any community there will be a red
light district".... :-)

Well, unfortunately, the way I said it didn't come out quite riught, and was
widely misinterpreted, to my great displeasure.  However, we all know that
postings and email are easily misunderstood, so I tried to clarify myself, and
it appears that I was successful.

The other kind of bothersome attitude that I don't like to see at raves, and
that come from certain types of people who try to dress a particular way
*GENERALLY*, is the aggro "what are you looking at?!?!?" attitude.

I could see this as being very true.  It all depends on how one defines a
"rave".  For me, generally it's just the music.  But maybe I haven't
experienced enough of what you would call "raves" to distinguish.  I have only
been to 1 rave outside the bay area, and when I think about it, it was
definitely a different vibe:  Garden of Eden in Boulder, Colorado.  It was
pretty commercial, but the vibe was very positive, since it was away from the
big city types, and it attracted a lot of earthy-type ravers (and
high-schoolers too, but they were OK).  Well, now that I have more freedom to
choose the raves I go to, having not been as well connected as I am now, I
mopst certainly will go to more of what you call "raves" as ooposed to thge club thangs.

Well, a lot of the time, these people who I'm talking about *are* bothering me.
 And if they're not doing something to me directly, like I've said before, they
do it to surrounding people.  I've been elbowed and pushed around many a time
by a drunken jock or gangster who's looking for a fight.  Am I supposed to keep
my eyes closed when I see others making fun of the people around them, or
purposely trying to be an asshole for the sole purpose of being a downer for
everyone else?

Well, so now you see whgat I mean about there not being a complete vibe carried
by all the participants at most raves, correct?  I'm sure that at that party
you speak of, that guy wasn't the only one that was scamming.

I must say, that's very cool of your friend, and I hope that the guy got the
clue, and didn't go to his next rave looking for flesh, although I somehow
doubt it.  Still, A for effort.

Actually it was "In any community of 20 million people, you're going to 
have a red light district.  It's to be expected".   So they reshowed it
this morning?  Cool, I actually haven't seen it yet (only have the 
transcript :)

Basically they called Wired magazine the morning that story broke asking 
for a demonstration of the internet and how easy or hard it is to 
download images.  No one else wanted to do it, as the whole fact that this
story was considered important seemed stupid to us, but Hakim Bey 
notwithstanding I thought maybe we could help put things in perspectve.  
KTVU also interviewed me on the same subject a little later, and 
supposedly was a lot better about it (although the KTVU reporter wanted 
us to show him "the front screen to the Internet.  You know, when you log 
in".  Sigh!)

And after all this, my parents wanted to know why CNN would consider me 
an expert on net pornography :)

Thank you.  It almost seems like we're just arguing it into the ground 
now, which is too bad, but I am glad to see that at least one person

I don't know what to say for you.  I've seen those same type of people, 
and they have bothered me in the past, and they still do now, but I have 
found that when I ignore those kind of people, I simply do not see them 
anymore.  I don't feel I should be concerned with what they are doing, 
because they cannot change unless they want to.  So being concerned with 
those people, in my eyes, is worthless.  I am a much more peaceful person 
inside now that I "pay little attention to pop culture" as someone said.  
Jesus, I think if you just try to see this situation my way (I have done 
so for your point of view), I think you could get something out of it,

Hi I just called both the Come-Unity line and the Zippy line and it 
doesn't seem to me that the two parties are joining forces.

according to Come-unity they are doing their party is going to be at 
Townsend.  

according to the zippy line they have a wherehouse somewhere in the city 
that is going to be all ages.

It will be interesting to see who ends up where.

    Well, it appears Come-unity is going to be a 21+ event.  Which realy 
bums me out since me and a bunch of other friends were quite hyped to go 
see DubTribe and just have a killer time...

    What are the odds on getting in after 2 or 3 am??  I've been told 
that some of the clubs in the city stop carding when they stop serving 
alcohol.  

    There's always the jupiter bash... hmmm... That's going to be 
interesting :)

Hi Folx--

I must agree with Darren Atherton and nToy V Garcia
in regard to the seemingly interminable and endless           
escalation of argumemnts over the Signs & Symbols of
Inner Peace.  It started innocently enough with a couple
of us having a different view of one or two of its points,
and it looks like unless I end it here the posts will get
longer and longer, and increasingly self-justifying. I
must say I agree with Darren Atherton and Tony V Gracia:

> Actually I thought the original post was as beautiful and sweet as the music
> we listen to all week..
>
> I wish there were more posts like it..

>
>> Thank you.  It almost seems like we're just arguing it into the ground
>> now, which is too bad, but I am glad to see that at least one person
>> takes it at face value and not much more.
 

The music and parties I've enjoyed this week have just
reinforced my notion of how great a world there is out
there, and how rave culture is a small but beautiful part
of it: the Italian and Brazilian World Cup Games and party 
celebrations in S.F. on Wednesday that--especially in the
case of the Brazilians--show how people can really party;
and Babatunde Olatunji and the Drums of Passion last night .
at Palookaville that showed how much live energy love we can 
all share when our heart chakras are open to each other
through the vibrationalhealing of music!

I look forward to tonight's events--from ComeUnity to the
Zippies--to top off and lead into what should be a truly
insane tomorrow when Italy and Brazil meet!  If you haven't
been to the afterparties of events like these, go--they are
like block parties in Rio during Carnaval!

ciao,
Will

P.S. Ken--do you go raving as well as posting on sfr?
     Will you ever answer any of my private posts to you?

We will be premiering the new Orb video "Pomme Fritz" this Sunday at 10PM 
on Viacom channel 47 in SF. Just as the album is a departure from their 
last, the video (7 mins) is a departure from the Blue Room video and their 
longform.

Also airing: Jam and Spoon, MC Solaar, BNH, Autechre, B-tribe, Inspiral 
Carpets...

Hi there -

Does anybody know what the cover is for come/unity tonight?  Also
I was wondering around what time they'd be letting people in.  I
called the info line and it didn't give this information.  

thanks!

Even though I worried for our safety when 6 tall drunk guys turned
up to mosh at Liquid *, I had a GREAT time overall.

HUGE THANKS to Bryce, without who's soundsystem we'd be nothing :-)
        to Tamara, Lee, and Deaks for the good music
        to Larry for patrolling and watching out for the rest of us
        to all the people who showed up post-SPAZ or wherever they were
        to Samir and Adam for bringing their "renegade-virgin" friends
        to everyone for coming, dancing, sharing food and water, helping
                to haul gear and pick up trash

One thing that really stood out for me was that I got to play a bunch
of records I've been hoarding . . . or afraid to play . . . 150 to 160
bpm techno tracks.  I felt it went over well and have disproved to myself
my old theory that San Francisco hates the harder and faster stuff.  So
I won't bitch about that any more :-) :-)  What was even cooler though
was that from Tamara's old-style acid and funky set to Lee's house to
Deaks' progressive to my fast trance to Bryce's homage to Ritchie
Hawtin people really showed a lot of appreciation for what was played.
You all are just the greatest!

What we read was something to the effect of "look for the guy in the yellow

didn't have to read much into it . . .   Maybe you should specify what he's

  The SPAZ/Zippie party (5$ all ages) will be on Stevenson ST between 5th 
and 6th, which is about 2 blocks from Come-Unity.. So for all those under 
21, or unwilling to pay a (perhaps) high cover charge, you can come and 
check it out..  Hope to see some of you tonight, wherever I may end up :)

I agree completely.  Wide-0blanket styereotyping, is inheritantly wrong. 
However, sometimes it is in one's best interest to pre-judge someone on their
looks for the sake of personal safety.  However, in most situations, it is best
to judge someone by their actions, no?

Well, what do you mean by concerned?  All I'm saying is that it bothers me. 
It's unfortunate that that stuff goes on at raves.  You must agree that raves
would be better if and when these things *don't* go on.  Right?  And pop
culture has nothing to do with this.  This is just me trying to have a good
time, and *any* person being a dick in general.

Yet another great Liquid Everything party.  Everytime I go to one I feel more
and more a part of our little family.  It's really good to try and get back to
these small, tribal communities which will help each other and support each
other, especially in times of need.

I don't know what else I can say about the party specifically that hasn't been
said before.  I do want to bring up one point, though: I realize that there
were, in fact, one or two people from the other party who were being mean.
But the point at which there was the most animosity is when the main power
cord became loosed from the generator.  I would like to ask: did anyone SEE
the other party people purposely and with malicious intent pull the power
cord?  Maybe they just tripped on it and pulled it loose, and then,
realizing what they'd done, instinctively ran, having been brought up in a
hostile and unforgiving society (assuming we'd try kick their asses because
they interrupted our party).

Maybe that's not what happened, and maybe some would argue it's not
particularly likely, but you never can tell.  I would rather give them the
benefit of the doubt (I'd already given them some bagels, what the heck :) )

My one regret was that my good friend Laurel, who is not a regular raver 
(yet), was all ready to go with me but then decided she was too tired.  Too
bad, becauce she would have had a lot of fun, and she's also an incredibly
powerful presence whom I'm sure we all would have benefited from.  Oh well,
I'll make sure she gets to the next one, and see if we can get her to join
our family!

Particular thanks go out to all the DJ's for great music (I think Laura's
and my musical appreciation brainwaves must be on the same frequency), Deaks
for the Japanese twix things (that was deaks right?  I can't understand how
I've been raving all this time and I'm _still_ horrible with names), Marie
for the tasty apple, and eternal thanks to Brian, Bryce, and the Cap'n for
offering spiritual leadership.  I shouldn't even single out these people
though because _everyone_'s presence is important equally.

thanks to all,
stevie

p.s. my personal apologies for the fact that the earth did not in fact start
spinning in the oppostie direction during the night.  Oh well, better luck
next time.

Hi all,

Liquid Air was my second party to attend from SFR and again I really enjoyed
myself.
Although as mentioned before a "kegger group" was not too far away and some
interresting individuals would come stumbling by, until the time I left all
was lots of fun.  
Thanks to Bryce for putting the event together and Laura being an incredible
source of positive energy they managed to make this another evening to
remember.  Again I did not get to listen to Laura's set (last time I got
there too late and this time I was too tired to wait until 3:00am for her
set.)  Laura hopefully next time.

Getting back to Good Liquid...
The analogy here is very simple.  SFR was the good Liquid VS the Kegger
being, well... the not so good Liquid.. ??..
What I'm getting to is that I was very impressed by the warm, friendly,
sincere and very mature attitude the SFRs have as a group.  Their "Liquid" of
choice was water or juice mixed with lots of high energy adrenalin,
incredibly good music and a sence of peace with themselves and nature.  A
very big contrast to the OTHER group.  Keep up the good work, Bryce, Laura,
Brian and everyone else involved.
I'm planning to go to Free Fall tonight, in about 2 minutes, cause it sounds
like the music could be very good.  Lets check it out.

Until next time...thanks a lot all.

Denis

I've told a lot of you this personally, but I wanted to make a general an-
nouncement to all those who have met me, been nice to me, taken care of me, or
just helped provide a good vibe during my time near SF -

I'm pretty much decided that after I (I hope) receive my degree in December,
I'm moving back to my home, Illinois.  I have learned much from my travels
here, but it's time I go back to my blood realtives, my heritage, my climate,
my culture, at least for a while before i go traveling off somewhere else.
I'm especially excited to be reunited with some old friends whose intellects
and creativities all resonate really well with each other and mine.  We're
hoping that together we can accomplish some really powerful and exciting
things.

Don't think of me as leaving for good though; think of me as SFRaves's
ambassador to Chicago!  I intend to share the knowledge I have gained here.
My brain is already working on how we can get some more renegades going
there (there probably are some already, but I don't know about them).  It's
hard in a state that has so little waterfront property that seemingly every
inch of it is owned and patrolled, but we'll figure something out.  Also,
I'm thinking of trying to bring raves to Waukegan, my actual home town.
It's a podunk town, but but there are definitely a few people there who are
just as eager to shatter dominant paradigms as I am but haven't had the
opportunities that I've been so blessed to have.

I'll definitely be staying in touch with sfraves via email to get everyone's
help and input to achieve these goals.

So as you can see, I'm pretty excited about the whole thing.  But on the
other hand I'm going to get as much out of my last 5 months in SF as I can!

Here's to you all, and thanks again.

love, 
stevie

 As to the disconnection of the power cord - as they were leaving , they
trailed the power cord ( this I determine via body language and by their
heads looking down towards the ground ). Then , the main group made a 
sudden and obvious fade up the hill as the one guy bent down to the ground.
The power did not cut off until after he was rising back up to a standing
posture. By these signs , I think it was a deliberate decision by at 
least one of them to disconnect our power cord. 

 ------------------------

 In a large part , I feel the nonviolent and forgiving/tolerating stance
of the Liquid * participants truly prevented a deadly inflation of the
problems we had with the other party. We saw that one of their games 
was "I push you , you push me" - as an actual physical game , and as 
a psychological one ( Their "push" was to invade our "space" , be obnoxious,
and mess with our equipment ). Since we didn't "push" back , they didn't 
get a chance to prove how tough they were.

 Even then , it took that one "rotten apple" among them to really crank
up our tensions ( the guy who disconnected our power and tossed pebbles
at us ). If he hadn't left the site entirely , the evening may have turned 
out differently. Maybe his own pals had gotten tired of his shit.

 As it turned out , good vibes and nonviolence wins again! :-/ ( For a 
contrast, refer to the bad raver/gang problem that happened at Candlestick
Park months ago. Luckily , we got some "regular dudes" instead of 
gangsters last night. ).

This touches on the larger question of meeting people that one writes to
on the net.  My viewpoint is that I don't see a need to.

I find e-mail a superior verbal communication to either the telephone or
in person.  E-mail allows you to sit down when YOU have time to
comfortably think about what you are reading.  On the phone or in
person, two things happen:

(1) I can't fully relate all that I'd like to say about the topic
because it takes a moment or two to collect my thoughts.
(2) I find that in 80% of cases, the conversation veers into a different
direction before an interesting aspect is discussed.

Now, there is, of course, the non-verbal aspects which are very much
enhanced in person.  But, I'm married :-) and I find that the other
non-verbal aspects, ie raving, happen just being in the room with
everyone.

So, what is the advantage of associating a specific physical body with a
specific e-mail address :-) ?

respect,

    Ken

I was in Los Gatos with some friends (including several Brazilians) after
Brazil beat the US.  The news said there were two or three thousand
"revelers."  The scene was strikingly rave-like (a "revel"?)-- throngs of
people, some drummers, an occasional horn player, and lots of happy people
spinning, dancing and looking for the slightest excuse to sing "OLE ole ole
ole... Bra-ziiiil... Bra-ziiiil"

There were nationalistic overtones, but also "OLE... U-S-A..." too, which I
thought was nice, and something I found hard imagining Americans doing had
they won.

Another comment:  there were about a billion cops from several counties.  At
about one AM they proceeded to try to shut the party down, forbidding entry
into bars, and streets; hasselling drummers and dancing groups.  This
confused the Brazilian tourists quite a bit. It was a good example of the
insecurity of authority figures presented with a lot of people having fun.

You should have seen the motorcycle cops being surrounded by lauging dancing
people (my friends too) trying to get the cop to smile as we took group
pictures with him while he and his partners tried to break up our "dance
cell" using sirens and divide-and-conquer techniques.  Love and happiness won
out and they just made their escape temporarily, although many were freaked
out at the inappropriate seeming show of force.

It seems to me that by, in their minds, trying to prevent violence or
misconduct, the hard-handed behavior of the cops were actually creating
animosity, resentment and the nucleus for opposition.  Same old story really.

Why do people dislike it when other people are having a lot of fun?  I don't
know, but I've found it to be a depressing and widespread human trait since
partying in high school and college...

My point-- the World Cup celebrations really are rave-like, including their
eliciting of unreasonning negativity by uptight authority figures who equate
a little abandon with criminal behavior.  A legacy of (N.) America's
Quaker/Pilrim/Protestant work-good-go-to-heaven, and
play-bad-wanton-irresponsible-go-to-hell moral foundation, perhaps. : )

Here's to a little tolerance and post-judice instead of paranoid prevention
and prejuduce.  Let us revel!

Well, that was DJ Deaks describing himself so he could meet people
because he's new to SFRaves.  He was giving away these awesome
almond cookie sticks that were dipped in chocolate.

You DID read too much into it.  Remember, rave doesn't ALWAYS
equal drugs, and people who are giving things away sometimes
really ARE generous and begnin and just want to share chocolate.

asked if you ever go raving, and you didn't answer his question even 
though you claim that talking over email is so much less prone to errors 
than other forms.  If so, then how can it be when you've completely missed 
his simple and direct yes or no question? :-)   

Do you ever go raving, i.e. going out and actually HEARING the music you 
keep asking me about, dancing around, soaking up the atmosphere, and getting 
some hugs and smiles?

People can try to verbally describe music until they are blue in the
face or until their fingers fall off from typing, but until you've
gone and heard lots of examples yourself and heard for yourself how
a DJ works and how the dancers respond, it's not the same as email.

>So, what is the advantage of associating a specific physical body with a

Direct human contact with those whom we endlessly debate often gives
rise to greater understanding.  It also allows you to meet people 
with whom you'd otherwise not exchange email and in that way extend
your connections with the community.

Two years ago when ne-raves was first getting started there were 
endless stupid flame wars.  I then decided to throw a big party at
my house before a big rave so that the "email addresses" from the
list could meet face to face.  The result was phenomenal.  ne-raves
was transformed from a lot of sterile semantic debate into a huge
love-fest.  Once the initial euphoria wore off, a feeling of
family solidarity remained for quite some time.  To this day ne-ravers
go out of their way for each other to offer rides to parties, to 
offer crash space after parties, to cooperate to have picnics, 
dinner parties, nights out in cafes or restaraunts, and to even throw
raves.  None of this started happening until people actually met 
face to face. The transformation really was amazing.  (There are still
endless stupid flame wars, and I really think that this is due to
the fact that email is a very PROTECTIVE medium -- it allows you to
say things to people you never would in person because there is no
raw physical humanity for you to go face to face with.)

Here in SF, too, I've seen similar things on a smaller scale.  I distinctly 
recall a lot of bickery email going around before the Friends and Family
party at Komotion.  Two of the three combatants (and you were the third)
met in person at the party.  I made sure they got introduced.  The result
was smiles and hugs and declarations of new-found feelings of friendship.

Nothing beats first-hand experience, be it of music, of that ephermeral
quality known as "vibe," or of another person.

well, personally, i've found that sfraves became 10000% more rewarding
once i started regularly physically interacting with the people on the
list.  ymmv.

maybe it's some facet of insecurity or curiosity that drives it, but i
basically found myself really needing to meet these people.

i also wanted to be involved in the group, and the reality is that one
ongoing major activity of the group is actually throwing raves.  i
happen to be of the opinion that it's probably the most important
thing that this group does.  we HAVE provided an alternative scene
which, more importantly than just being different, we have
specifically tailored to be something which we enjoy immensely.

so, in the context of sfraves, i think that it's really important for
people on the list to interact IRL.  some great friendships have come
of it, and i think that the more loving connections between people,
the better.

in the greater context of the net, and as someone who has been on the
net for eight years, it appears to me that the longer you spend on the
net, the more you realize how important really meeting the person is.
(i'm not the only one who thinks this, btw, it's something which many
researchers in teleconferencing / virtual reality are thinking about.)

of course, these are all my opinions.  you'll probably only truly
value them if you've met me before :-)

i miss you guys!
Bob

I personally saw someone in a white sweatshirt and jeans, about 5'9"
brown medium length hair slightly stumble over the cord, then pick
it up, and follow it to the generator.  he then went over to his friends.
they wandered about for a bit, then went up a path to the top of the rise. 
this individual was the last in the group.  he, as he passed by the
generator, fished around the ground again to find the power cable, followed
it to the generator, and pulled the plug.  Definitely with a purpose.  He
then ran up to the top of the rise, laughing and nudging his friends, who
also laughed and twittered.  As i was walking toward the generator, i sent
some harsh words in their direction, including the stratightforward 
question: "don't you have anything better to do?"  the reply was, "No!"
to which laura responded, "well, go do it somewhere else."  end of exchange.
after that, we simply kept a watchful eye on them to ensure no further
mischief.

that incident, as well as the throwing of bagels and pebbles and lighting
of firecrackers amidst the dancers were clearly not mindless mistakes.  to my
knowledge, no lasting physical damage was done to anyone.  however, these
acts of "mischief" were, to me, intentional.

my response to these actions was primarily watchfulness.  lots of people
continued to dance, and the djs played on through all of this, including
several visits by our neighbors.  larry mentioned that he spoke with some
of these folks.  i don't think there was any malice on anyone's part, ours
or theirs.  for my part, i did not want them messing with the equipment
(since it's mine or my responsibility), nor physically harming anyone 
(even unintentionally).  it seems that once we established that as a ground
rule of sorts, we got along much better.

I found the mix of cultures quite interesting. Yes, there were some
bad apples in the bunch, but I think a lot of the keggers were curious
as to what we were doing. There is not way they could have "raved"
quite like we did - can you imagine dancing with a belly full of
beer, ech!!

There was a definite "sphere of influence" that the sf-ravers put
around our party. What with moving our dancing bodies between the
potential trouble-makers and the equipment, a buffer zone was made
and the "invaders" were kept at bay.

When the group left, the music definitely seemed happier (on purpose?)
and I felt the group accomplished something by standing our ground and
keeping everything peaceful.
 
>  As it turned out , good vibes and nonviolence wins again! :-/ 

Yes, it did. I want to thank everyone involved. Liquid * was my 
second rave (after July 4 Liquid Draino). I made some good friends
and had a terrific time. Thank you all - see you again soon.

-Mike

Went to spaz fri night fot the first time--and had so much fun we went to 
the jupiter bash as well.  Phat venue--lots of alters, incense...a woman 
painting a mural downstairs in the chill room.  Very agro music-heavy techno
SHOBAN back from detroit played swirling acid techno that was as extreem 
as anything I have grooved to.  All ages crowd--literally ALL AGES.  
Excellent party.  Thank you spaz people!

  The SPAZ/Zippie party was definetley one of the best parties I've been 
to all summer.   There were essentialy three rooms, the front 
entrance/bongo lounge ... The main dance area, and the chill space down 
below.  The vibe was plain and simple: DANCE DANCE DANCE.  With the 
exception of the ambient area, I never saw anyone NOT dancing!

  The atmosphere was this weird sort of techno-psychedlia.  They had 
some great black light art and lots of other wierd stuff painted on the 
walls, not to mention the video projections and the other assorted 
effects.  I was under the impression that the building the party was in 
was the 'zippies' HQ.  Does anyone know what the deal is with that 
location?  I really hope they decide to throw some more parties there.

  Now to the subject of this post... Does anyone have any mix tapes of 
that super super intense hardcore acid they were playing around 2-3am.  I 
thought I had heard it all, but that stuff was phenomenal.  The ripping 
analog bass lines grabbed  hold of my entire body and sent me stomping 
like a mad man! I need to hear some more of that stuff :)

Peace out...

You heard Shoban spin and she was the first person that played that stuff 
that I was aware of in SF but she moved to detroit cause we are Too funky 
groovy. That was the old cordouroy city location. The party was more of 
the Spaz crew than the Zippy crew,(except the door gaurdian road warrior guy)

I must agree that this was a very very high energy gathering of people and
also in what looked like someone's flat.  The music was intensely fast and
everyone was going WHACK-o.  I think it was around 3am that they started
doing LIVE techno with about 3 guys and a bunch of keyboards all piped through
the mixer so that the DJ could fill in his own stuff too.  THAT sent the crowd
into this frenzy... I wish I could have joined the pit of people but my body
just couldn't do it.  (one of the reasons why I couldn't get out to Liquid *
unfortunately) And the location was really quite a trip with spirals painted
on the walls and floor.  There was some guy behind the DJ doing some video
editing which I couldn't quite understand, but it seemed to add to this aura
of "technology" with all the keyboards, turntables, computers and tv screens
crammed into what looked like the kitchen.

Speaking of the Los Gatos world cup celebrations, I was there after Brazil
beat the U.S. and I felt that high energy-togetherness thing that was all
over the place, which definitely showed that there are a lot of people out
there who have that rave-desire, but haven't taken steps to find out.  But
what I also noticed was that it was dangerous.  People were throwing lit
fireworks into the crowd, causing a fast movement of many bodies in several
directions (almost like a riot) and then just kept-on chanting and even
started slam dancing pretty hardcore in the large crowd (prolly only because
it was a crowd).  Ok, I never saw anyone get hurt, but there sure was a lot
of potential for it.  

Luckily, the police were there to click their flashlights on and off.  WI felt
so much at ease!

It was a project to build a nation on a huge floating island. The
constitution was really neat; no "consentual crimes" were possible.
No protecting you from yourself, etc. Quite an enlightened document.

The project was going on for quite a while, and then at one point they
decided they just couldn't raise ther money, and it was ended.

Here in Washington D.C. tonight the Brazillians we're partying all over the
place having fun and driving up and down M St in Georgetown waving flags
and dancing on the top of their cars. Even tho i was going for Italy who'd
id got a chance play Nigeria, The party was so much fun i ran up and down
the streets huging various people and high fiving a many more.
   And the cops didn't stop the party, and actually in another part of town
closed off a road so people could celebrate

  Id venture to say that the World Cup although its competition and all
is basically all about fun. I've had a lot of fun taking part in the 
different celebrations i have been part with, either Nigerians, or
Saudi Arabians or Italians, or Brazilians (or even Americans ;) and
going to the games. The World Cup was as amazing as attending a rave.
  Raves and the World Cup tap into the same vein of: "Look life can
suck but here we can create are little utopia and just dance, cheer,
hug, run around act crazy, but by all means have fun!" And it definately
was like that for me Im really gonna miss all the Cup has brought with
it over the past month :)

Thank you San Fran for a most ecumenical cross-pollination.
I'll let the local reviews stand alone...  community needs no hype.
The venue is NOT zippy HQ, tho future parties are possible in that venuw.

The gig was ZIPPY and SPAZ all the way-- Zippy design, UK and SF mixmasters.

Please come one and all to the Zen-Inspired Performance Publishing event
at Crash Palace (628 Divisidero Street, SF) from 9 am Mon to 2 a.m. Tuesday

Just like the Jupiter Bsah-- this is a chaotic creative romper room-
shareware worldwide web material for the global Zippy community.

Bring your gear and your sense of humour.

lets play some more

Because this is such a ridiculous question that the only result of the
question can be the thought -- why did this person ask this question?

(Can you imagine posting to someone on alt.cult-movies "Do you ever go
to see movies?" or to someone on alt.soccer "Do you ever watch soccer?")

The only plausible reason has to do with:

But you see there is a BIG problem with this.  All that has happened is
that you've moved someone from within the "them" circle to the "us"
circle.  What we need is to do this with EVERYONE - ie eliminate the
"them" circle.  As I mentioned to you in private e-mail (I hope you
received that), what set me off was that the supposed "narc" was treated
with prejudice as "them".  What was stupid on my part was to treat the
person who did that, as "them" :-).

The idea that we're supposed to be introduced and then never take
exception to false statements :-) :-) seems pretty silly to me.

>>So, what is the advantage of associating a specific physical body with a

>

Greater understanding of what?  I have friends I see every week (as a
group) and I know less about them than I know of many people I converse
with on e-mail - because of what I said before about the usual
meandering nature of conversations.

> It also allows you to meet people
>with whom you'd otherwise not exchange email and in that way extend
>your connections with the community.

Ah, but this is the opposite of my question.  If I go to a rave, meet
someone, and say "How can I contact you later?", that person might say
"Do you have e-mail?".  This has nothing to do with meeting people we
know on e-mail previously.

But again, this also works in reverse, otherwise there would be no rave
scene at all.  Someone throws a rave, people discover that there are
other people like them who are willing to take a chance in order to
experience the love vibe, they exchange phone numbers (and/or e-mail
addresses), meet at cafes or for lunch, etc.

>Nothing beats first-hand experience, be it of music, of that ephermeral
>quality known as "vibe," or of another person.

But this is just what I said in the part of my post that you deleted in
your response.

And we all do all of those things.  But I feel that we should interact
with EVERYONE on e-mail (or elsewhere) as if they were a close friend.
I'm unlikely to ever rave with Tony in Miami or Sigi in Australia or
Chrome in Amsterdam -- should I treat them differently??

Interestingly, the question at the top came at the end of a thread where
the OTHER person was advocating the place of "conflict" and THEN feels
the need to meet in person because we've been having this e-mail conflict.
:-) amazingly ironic :-).

Drunken kegger people!  That explains the folks I ran into in the parking lot
behaving very strangely  and chanting Rave on! Rave on!  We got to Liquid * a
little late having been at Spiral Jive earlier in the evening.  Though my
friend and I were in our own little world, we both had a lot of fun - great
location, vibe and music.  I wish I had been a little more with it and talked
to some of you sfravers - next time. So who was that spinning at the end and
was that old or new acidic stuff?

        I'm going out on a tangent here, but...on Saturday, I had the
incredible opportunity to see Richie Rich Hawtin at work at Destiny Five,
an indoor/outdoor event I took part in just north of Toronto (Canada).  Has
anyone here seen/heard him play?  I have never experienced anything like
it.  He was such an inspiration; I haven't played the same way since!

I saw Richie Hawtin in February of '93 perform as one half of Cybersonic 
(hard 909/metal-pipe-samples stuff) in Dallas.  They were opening for the 
Prodigy and Moby.  It was quite good actually.  For techno, he actually 
has that elusive skill which Aphex for sure hasn't picked up: stage 
presence.  Heh, whatever...;)

Wait, did you see him spin?  or perform his music?

Actually, it *was* quite funny. I had gone up there(since I had just
finished off my left ankle in the "track" next to the right speaker.).
to smoke and enjoy the lovely music and people below, when Matt came up
and sat next to me. It was obvious he wanted to bum a smoke, but thought
it was decent to make small talk first. So he said, "Where are you from, 
duuuude ?". I said, "India". He was a bit puzzled, "India,dude ? I 
live right over there---------> where those lights are.."...

I had just come to the party, and didnt know that he wasn't part of it..

In any case, it was a great party, and thanks to you all...
my only regret is that Laura's music refused to let my legs stay still,
and my ankle was forced to 'enjoy' in silent, joyous protest.:)

On Sat., we went to 177 Townsend..but were put off by the $15/- cover..
and landed up at the uppity jazz place on 2nd near Brannan.:p
Like someone else had suggested, why not advertise the cover charge on
the answering machine, as well? I can't see it doing any harm.,.

..And to make the weeekend perfect, Brazil won!!!!!
There weren't enuf of us Brazil fans in Ireland's 32( spoiled the
'vibe' for the Italian(Irish-turned-Italian fans, tho:)), tho..and the line
outside Bahia was 100+ strong at 1030(2 hours before kickoff):(...

Looking forward to the next party..:)

hi folx,

this coming sat. at this rave in santa cruz where the zippies will be present
too. hope you can all come. am looking forward to this, plus i LOVE sc.
 also, i had a really good time at sunset yesterday. the vibe was great,
 a la 1992, brought in part by some replaying of some good ole songe from  that
era. galen and gavin were really great working th crowd excellently, building
up the vibe in a beautiful way.  plus the location, at berkeley marina,
overlooking the bay , was just great.
take care/shalom

Although sfraves already has insane traffic rates, I'd like to suggest that
   we, in some way, try to either excourage zippies to join sfr or formally
   include zippy stuff into the sfraves charter.  From the recent spate of
   retractions etc., I think it would be neat.

The other option, of course, is to tell me to go join <insert zippy mailing
   list>.  But I'm not as into that- I only want to get crossover stuff -
   but I want it firsthand from the zip's, not regurgitated from sfravers,
   who obviously haven't a clue, as well-meaning (or not so well-meaning)
   as we are.

peace not piece not pc,

regarding the amusing case of ignorance on the part of the TV reporter
  when talking to Brian, i think it's GOOD that there's still a bit of
    mystery regarding the Net; it probably keeps some of the most
      seriously clueless peeple outta harm's way; kindof like not wanting
        peeple on the freeway who don't know what a steering wheel is...
    (am i being elitist?)

oceania was an idea ahead of it's time, (kinda sea-quest-ish...) which
  was to create an ocean-borne nation, which was immune from international
    lawz.  the list is still alive, but it's been merged with some
      libertarian list at MIT, i think...

>>The party was so much fun i ran up and down

...huge-ing or hugging? :)

Either way, its pretty cool-- and I'd venture to guess that its a lot
different than, say, when the 49er's win the SuperBowl.  I'm generalizing of
course, but Americans "party" like the "Drunken kegger people" more so than
I've found in other cultures.

Some friends & I partied pretty heavily/regularly in college, and we'd always
get newcomers who thought our group were real "party animals."  Often they'd
want to thrash or harass someone, or be an asshole, to fit in with us.  The
stone thrower at Liquid reminds me of the type ("Hey I'm drunk let's fuck w/
something/somebody"). Is there just one in every crowd, or just one in every
American crowd?

I guess I'm belaboring the point because it fits into my diatribe of
excessive rule making and repressive type behavior modification usually
bakefire (like w/ drinking age limits, Catholic girls, drugs, and generally
partying).  I won't go into it now :)

Hey, just revel, man.

Saturday night- we braved the big parties, avoided the zippies, and set up
the Weird Blinking Lights scientific sound lounge and it was AWESOME!

big thanx to BRYCE for providing the Metrovision Speakers. I have never
seen anyone as relaxed as he was- we could tell our sound was perfect because
he slept the *entire time*- the truest compliment for an ambient band.

The room looked awesome thanx to the decorative skills of WBL Arteests
peet seraphim and john "mandibles" tapeworm.

caliban spun everything from the Mahrahi Yogi to the the lunar landing tapes
overlaid with brian eno.

this was a first for live performance in SF by the famed WBL engineer
Doctor David van Brink (click the 7.0 text in the "monitors" portion of
your mac control panel). he did a traditional tape music of analog synth
piece. rocky jammed on the Nyles and analogs, and i had a small portion
of my analog arsenal.

we will next perform on aug 13 at FFIII at a time TBA.

hear you all there...

Hi Folx--

What a fabulous weekend this was!  I'm sure the *Jupiter Effect*
is doing it's thing!  The only regret I'd have, if I had regrets,
is that I didn't make it to the Come/Unity as I had intended be-
cause I was having so much fun, using so much energy, communing
with so many good friends, and dancing my arse off at their great
party!

My weekend was framed by zippy-related activities:
the truly excellent small rave on Stevenson Alley
that featured great spaces (chill room, drum area,
dance area with great altar and good sound and
visuals) and *mainly and finally* what ended up to be
more than six hours (!) of dj Goa Gil's Best DAT-ing
that had us all levitating from time to time!  The
zippies really showed that they can do it (I especially
liked pincus the parallel universe teuton at the door
and statuesque on the dance floor for at least an hour
near the end).
 
Going to a cafe full of Italians and Italian-Americans
to watch the World Cup Finals was extraordinary! The
spirit flowing around the huge TV--the highs and eventually
lows--was something we rarely experience in this country!
I had seen both matches on Wednesday in the semi-finals
and danced in the streets with Italia fans in the afternoon
in North Beach and endlessly with the Brasil fans in front
of Bahia off of Market, but the partying that the Brazilians
put on Sunday rivalled *any* rave soul and spirit I've ever
felt!  Wow!
 
Then today, Monday, I went by Crash Palace and saw the Cap'n
crunching in the adventures of his with the zippies and my
English friend Keith a poem of his for the pronoid cultural
anarchic CD-ROM they are making!  Anyone can put in anything:
song, writing, painting, dance, drama, you name it--it will be
a totally inclusive work of art.  And the ol' revived Kennel
Club looks great as the new Crash Palace!

I look forward to being of any help this weekend when our 
own Andrew of Epic Productions here in Santa Cruz puts on
the next zippy event!  If anyone needs crash space or other
requirements, please e-mail or phone me!  Looking forward
to seeing you-all!  Epic has put on some great parties here
so far--and this one promises to be spectacular.

End of superlatives!

ciao,
Will

Well, we *all* are!  That's really good of you to flgellate
yourself in public, Sean, but as the zippies are cultural
agents-provacateurs they open themselves for radical inter-
pretations.  I told some of them at the party on Stevenson
Saturday that they should contact Bill Griffith, the artist
who does Zippy the Pinhead comix, because Zippy is pronoid,
too, in a very existential, zen and idiot-savant sort of way.
I mean, we have to unite with our potential allies. In one
of his strips Zippy visits the Santa Cruz Beach and Boardwalk
because he heard it was one of the great sacred sitesf the
world.

I mean, how right can you be?

ciao, Will

Subject: Fraser Clarke wants to stay in SF!

I had an interesting conversation with Fraser Clarke, impromptu-spokesman
for the Zippies, last night at their Jupiter Bash.  He was saying that he
feels as if SF is a newfound home, and that he wants to do something here
on the same scale as Megatripolis; he phrased it as wanting to bring
together the young and old, in groups of 3000 people or more, on a weekly
basis.  He says he plans to have a learning center similar to the Parallel
University, and is hoping to use the University angle as a way around
police harassment.  It will be very interesting to see what he pulls off!

As far as the show last night is concerned; it was wonderful!  Having raved
in most of the major rave-aware cities on the west coast I have to say the
vibe last night was unique.  Everyone there was there to dance, and the
music played just kept us dancing!  Hot, hard and sweaty; combine that with
people who love to dance and you've got the formula for a good party.

Congrats to SPAZ and all envolved for a really well done show.

Next Tuesday, July 26, some friends and I are going to throw a party at 1190 
Folsom (the location of Mushroom Jazz) for my birthday and I'd like to invite 
everyone on the list to come down. Here's the info:

The Justice League Sound System presents:

Kinetic

Monty   Andre Lucero   Ray   Joe Rice

Tuesday, July 26 10p-4a @ 1190 Folsom - Free

Sorry for the short notice, but I was just able to get the location the other 
day. Hopefully they'll be open to doing regular events in the future - I got 
the impression business is a bit slow many nights.

Sorry to dump this one into sfraves, space, but I thought some other 
folks might like to hear these factoids.

Actually, we designed a promo piece for an HMO a few years ago that was 
sprinkled with some interesting medical tidbits.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS, EAR, HUMAN

Quoted from memory, but all the figures are true...

"An adult human can hear frequencies of up to 20,000 Hz. Children can 
usually hear up to 40,000 Hz. Adult hearing extends down to 16 Hz. Any 
lower and you would be able to hear your muscles moving."

"The human ear is sensitive to energies down to one quadrillionth of a 
watt. If the ear were only slightly more sensitive, you would be able 
hear molecular collisions as backgound noise."

jmar! shhhhh!

Recently , apost from  "JMRTNKO, the real Chekov!" <martinko@netcom.com>
contained some info about the frequency limits of human hearing:
 
> 
> Quoted from memory, but all the figures are true...
> 
> "An adult human can hear frequencies of up to 20,000 Hz. Children can

> 

 FM radio is specified to transmit sounds up to 15Khz. This was considered
good enough in the days when it was invented. In any case , most adults are
doing good to be hearing up to 15,000 Hz. To be considered "high fidelity",
audio equipment should be able to process frequencies cleanly up to 
20,000 Hz. 

 Of course , maybe I'm prejudiced - I've just tested myself with an audio
generator and a MDR-V6 headphone , and my hearing dropped off at 15,285 Hz.
I think I tried a similar experiment in my teen years , and I think I was
able to hear stuff up to 18,000 Hz. ( but I may have been hearing the
distortion in my test equipment ).

		Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com

PS - That "test tone" that I occasionally hear - that I've mentioned in
 a previous post - seems to be at about 3664 Hz. I used the audio generator
 to attempt a duplication of the tone , as I remembered it.

 A quiz ( that I don't know the answer to ) - what musical note is 3664 Hz ?

  Just thinking about the great gathering with the Zippies & SPAZ this past
  weekend. What a musical blowout - the music & visuals started good and
  improved all night. There was such a vibe leading to an ecstatically
  dancing early morning crowd - this was a good one! I'll assume that the
  gathering of the Z's in S. Cruz this weekend will be one happening
  place to be - starting at 4 outside and moving inside later in the 
  evening... the Zippies are in town and from all indications they like us
  and we like them - both sides have a lot in common.   

  I just met Will P. and Cap'n C. for the first time in the flesh and I for
  one find it nice to meet the people behind the "computer speak". What
  exciting times we live in! With even more options for interactions than
  ever before!!! 

  One great thing about the scene is its overall acceptance of and ability
  to appeal to people of all types - skin color, dress style, and age take
  a back seat to being with others and sharing the move groove.. This time
  around we have it a little better. In the 60's there was a paranoid 
  sense of not "trusting anyone over 30". Now; although not yet perfect; we
  find the willingness to accept anyone who can accept themselves, find
  an inner groove and share a bit of a smile. It's taking us back to tribal
  roots where after the work was done- people made music and celebrated.
  Think about it.. in tribal cultures the old and young took part in a
  united village celebration - the moon, the crops, the weather and change
  of seasons brought people together to make music and dance. And now the
  rave brings back some of this natural joy - and giving some of us a 
  chance to take at least a small step toward Pronoia. Maybe someone is
  trying to do something nice for us after all ! :-) (-: We meet and greet!

  Now at the risk of making this a little long a (reasonably short) file
  some of you might find of interest:

In response to a number of requests (most of them from Brian Smith), I'm
posting a radio piece I did for "Fresh Air" a couple of days ago on the
language of the info age.

geoff nunberg

			  The Dactyls of October
			       Geoff Nunberg
	  Language Commentary for "Fresh Air," NPR, July 6, 1994


	I've been looking over the new magazines like Wired and Mondo 2000.
Cyberzines, they call themselves, the Vanity Fair or Interview of the
information age. As best I can figure the information age runs from 18 to
25. Or at least the magazines have a rather MTV cast to them. Jazzy fonts
on colored backgrounds, text running over the pictures. It's all very
engaging, but a little hard to read for someone of my decade and diopter. I
find myself yearning for the austere simplicity of the black-and-white
screen on my antique Mac. But maybe that's the point of these magazines, to
drive us all on line. Cyberquislings, boring from within.
	There's clearly something big afoot. There are echoes of the
sixties, with all its talk of revolution -- how the technology is going to
lead to universal empowerment and the end of hierarchy. You might think
nothing had changed in the last 30 years, except that now the relevant
technology is software engineering instead of pharmacology. It's not
surprising to find Timothy Leary on the editorial board of Mondo 2000,
having decided to drop in again now that things are once more getting
interesting.
	But the language of the age has nothing to do with the 60s. It's
cyberspeak, all those compounds patched together from the truncated
syllables of other words. Cyberspace, internet, ethernet, hypertext,
vaporware, ubicomp, nanotech, infobahn. You think of the fighter planes in
the old comic strips: pocketa, pocketa, pocketa, pocketa. I have heard the
future, and it speaks in dactyls. It's a rhythm we've heard before, but not
at Woodstock. This is the music of October, 1917. It's the way the
Bolsheviks consolidated their words, as ruthlessly as they consolidated
everything else: comintern for Communist International, agitprop for
agitation-propaganda, komsomol, Komkultur, sovnarkom. The words
had a willful ugliness, as George Orwell put it, as if to signal a break
with bourgeois aesthetics. It was was the language of technological
efficiency, literally telegraphic, the clipped syntax used for
communication by wire.
	The resemblances to cyberspeak are more than accidental. For one
thing, current computers constrain the shape of words in some of the same
ways that the telegraph did. There are the programming languages that won't
accept expressions with extra spaces in them, the operating systems won't
let you use more than eight letters for a filename, so that all your files
wound up with titles like TaxInfo.txt. And when cyberspeak picks up the
pattern, it's as if to say, this is how we're going to talk when we let
machines be a party in the conversation.
	But there are indirect historical connections, as well. The
terminology of Soviet Communism was the model for Orwell's Newspeak -- words
like doublethink and Minipax, not to mention the name Newspeak itself. And
that in turn was the idiom that William Gibson transformed to make the
language of cyberpunk, which took newspeak from gray to noir. It was Gibson
who coinedCyberspace. It's the sort of word that Big Brother would have
used if he'd been a radio evangelist in Raymond Chandler's LA.
	Of course the new cyberspeak doesn't have the dark, oppressive
overtones of its predecessors. It's upbeat and hopeful. But then there was
a brief moment when the Russian revolution was light and gay. It was the
time of the Constructivist avant-garde, with their collectives, their
paeans to bridges and machines, their new forms of theater -- not to mention
the typographical experiments that are the direct progenitors of the
graphics in Wired and the rest.
	I'll grant you the comparison has its limits. The digital
revolution has produced some interesting creative works, but it has yet to turn
out a Malevitch or a Mayakovsky. For that matter, we should feel a little
embarrased about calling this a revolution at all, at least by contrast
what happened in October of 1917. It's more like a virtual revolution,
where everybody gets to lead the charge on the Winter Palace and nobody
actually has to be carried off on a litter. Still, it's a great time to be
young and on-line, and maybe November will come in little milder this time
around.

well,

(log (base 2) (3664 / 440)) * 12 = 36.69 notes above A440 (in equal

Hello,

Supposedly there have been e-mail problems at our internet supplier that
are "fixed" now.  Grrrr [sound of loss of inner peace :-) :-) ].

So, if you've sent me anything about tape trades or whatever over the
last 1-10 days, I may not have received the message.

later,

            JUPITER COMET IMPACT IMAGES AVAILABLE FROM NSSDC

The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center is pleased to announces the availability of the latest Comet 
P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, Keck 
telescope, Calar Alto, European Southern, La Palma, MSSSO, etc.

The images can be obtained using the World Wide Web (WWW). The URL is 

is http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/COMET.HTML.

The impacts have caused plumes 1000's of kilometers high, and have resulted in 
atmospheric features which are still visible after a few days.  The impacts 
will continue until July 22 and the NSSDC will endeavor to bring you the latest 
images.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the announcement was made at 1:00am on Tuesday, July 19, we have 
been overwhelmed with the accesses to our WWW server.  So far we have logged 
over 25,000 requests even though our server was down for extended periods 
today!

I thank you all for your patience and many, many note to support.  Please stay 
with us as we push the limits of the net over the next four days!  In the

when some dj's turn their treble way up, often late into the night, I too 
use wadded up wet toilet paper or paper napkin earplugs which are very
effective and allow me to dance without the treble pain.  They are as effective
to me as regular earplugs and sometimes, I have to reduce the thickness of
the toilet paper to allow more sound to come in.

Very cheap, disposable and effective.  Viva toilet paper!

Anyone unconvinced of the abilities of these folks obviously hasn't heard 
the first Tones on Tail singles/album. Unfortunately, I think Glen 
Campling (who has returned to Graphic Design AFAIK) was a big contributor 
to that ToT sound. 

I hope they have a few other infuences though. Not that I don't like 
Orbital, but...

They also showed up for the Autechre show here in SF a while back.

Subject: resonate/WBL & Ambient Music

SPAZ/Free Fall last Saturday.  I agree 100% with "a night of emusic" that
resonate posted on July 18 ... it was AWESOME.  Everyone involved did a
great job, from the incredible decor "I loved those space dronettes", to
the great gear setup, keyboard and all.  The sound system was also very
good...but... this is where I start to get irritated.
You have incredible, inspiring and intelligent mind twisting ambient music
(I'm sure those performers: resonate, caliban...put their heart and soul
into it) but as a listener I barely could get into it because of
distraction from the dance beat and baseline from the main floor
downstairs.  I do understand that this is not an isolated problem (sound
transmission in chill-out rooms).  For instance resonate says "we will next
perform on aug. 13 at FFIII at a time TBA."  The last FFII had a wonderfull
selection of ambient djs but an even worst sound transmission problem not
to mention the foot path to enter and to exit the club was right through
the ambient space.  If I'm not mistaken, I hear FFIII is going to take
place in the same location "Komotion".
Well, what is a Girl/Boy to do?
>From my professional background I know that when one brings up a complaint
one should also offer a solution.  Well... I don't have one.  I thought by
bringing up The Issue maybe a NETstorming session could occur and some
small progress could be achieved.  Maybe I'm too much of a sound purist but
then again I think any ambient dj would agree that the purpose of a chill
out room is to create an atmosphere where the music transport you into
another world where the dream is not interupted by annoying sounds. ---By
the way I do not totally agree with "...we could tell our sound was perfect
because he (Bryce) slept the *entire time* the truest compliment for an
ambient band".  I personnaly feel that ambient music should create a state
of "dream" not "sleep" where a dj (band, performer) could somehow control
your "journey" by the sound being generated or created.
I guess my frustration comes from really getting excited by the ambient
music I heard on Saturday (it was very, very good...it was great!) but I
just could not EXPERIENCE it. I kept on goin back downstairs out of
frustration. (Then again the MAD techno/trance music was absolutely fun to
dance to).
Like I said, I don't have a solution. 
-Maybe somehow organising ambient nights only with those performers could
draw an interresting crowd and create a wonderful peaceful atmosphere.  
-Maybe looking for venues where ambient and dance spaces are further apart
and better insulated.

 [ I tried to post this information Monday evening , but it got lost
   for some reason. ]

 I've found out that the excellent club weekly called MOTION in San Jose
will have its last two evenings tonight and next Wednesday. As I heard
it , some key personel have gone off to other things , and revenues were
also on the low side. So , if you've never gone to one of these , you've
got only two chances!

 Tonight , the DJs are Loren , Dutch , Tony - visuals by Pure. It is 
located at Club F/X , at 400 South First Street - use the side entrance.

 I intend to be there tonight - see you there!

	Sound isolation is a problem only if you deem that the context must
	always include it.

	After spending a large amount of my time in perfectly built studios
	I find that the setup and maintainence of a soundsystem in a loud
	environment, while not ideal, is a welcome challenge. Since the
	context of SFRaves events or most other events includes loud music
	outside- well we'll work within it.

	I'm very glad you liked our music- that show as kind of a "warm up"
	for us since all three of us haven't done live audio in SF proper
	until that show- we've done shows without the entire team and have
	been doing lights/graphics/projections for years (remember the
	digital countdown clock at Psychadelic Apocalypse?).

	We do plan to do a an afternoon show at Gaia Mantra records- so
	sound purists should be satisfied.

	Our decoration and artwork is done by Pete Lasell (flint@soda.berkeley
	.edu) and John Daniels (tapeworm@netcom.com). Pete has done our
	current poster. The Traditional Synthetic Cuisine CD artwork was
	done by me but the next one will be done by Pete. The CD is 
	available at Gaia Maintra Records at 511 Valencia/16th and at
	Rasputin's Records in Berkeley. 

	Thanks again to all who attended- we'll be bringing MUCH MORE 
	sound into the world as time continues to flow.

 ( I tried to post this , but it seemd to fail. If you get more than
   one copy per list , let me give my apologies now. )


  Hello! Just a little status on the SFR picnic RADIO!RADIO! in 
 Sunnyvale Baylands Park on Aug. 20th.

  These are the folks who replied to my request for music mixers for
 the picnic:


 Most likely to spin: Bryce , JSL , Laura , and Talizman

 Would like to spin , but may not be able to schedule it: 
                Ernie Deakyne, Harry Who , Marc  

  As it is still three weeks away from the picnic , folks may have some
 unavoidable problems which will prevent them from spinning. Still ,it
 seems we have enough SFR DJs to keep the music going! 

 ( If I've forgotten anyone , please let me know! )

true enough.  however, the alternative was to pump up the volume so loud,
and put enough bass bins in the chill space to turn it into a "main" room.
frankly, that space cannot handle enough power to overcome the downstairs
system.  imagine a 100W stereo competing with a 1500W stereo.  you heard
the results.  i apologize for the sound not being to your liking.  do you
have a suggestion as to how we can overcome the bleed through?

also true, as will F&F^4.  F&F^4 is one that I am helping to organize
as a party with ambient music in the main room.  that may alleviate some
of your concerns.  But, back to F&F^3...do you have a suggestion as to how
we can overcome the bleed through, yet still provide adequate ventilation
to the dance floor and still have easy access between the two? do come help
us set up these parties...we need your suggestions and assistance.

as an ambient DJ, i disagree with this as an absolute statement.  many people
use a chill room to do that...chill from dancing hard.  any soundscape is
incidental, often.  i once spun ambient in the same room as a 2.5KW system...
it gave me a new appreciation of the dj's art...trying to find spaces in
the dance beat.

well, as the person referred to in the quote, i'd like to publically clear
something up.  at no time was i really asleep...i actually had my eyes
closed and was listening the the entire soundscape provided to me...dance
beats as well as ambient sounds.  and, i got up several times to move 
around, and to go downstairs to dance and visit with friends.  the spirit
that steve intended his statement is still accurate, and true to your
feel for ambient...i *was* transported. i believe (correct me here if i'm
wrong, steve) that steve was also referring to the quality of the sound.
i deal with sound on a regular basis (SoundVision, and MetroVision...which
had parts at last Saturday's gig-under-discussion); when i don't fiddle
with systems, i'm happy, and i judge the sound quality good; hence, my
relaxing was a compliment to WBL's use of the sound system.

come to F&F^4, at least.  also, i hear that Noc Noc on Mondays (?) is
ambient.  Dalvah used to have ambient nights, too.  however, both of those
venues are also bars. on the ravey side, New Moon parties have been ~very~
ambient...do check them out.

> -Maybe looking for venues where ambient and dance spaces are further apart

if you come across any, do let the list know, as well as sfraves-planners...
we'd *LOVE* to use them.

Concerning sound isolation for chill rooms:

One unfortunate consequence of generating thousands of watts of very low
and  near subsonic frequencies is that they are *very hard* to escape. I
remember (a couple years back) *feeling* a toon town literally 4-5 blocks
away :) 

This problem is compounded by the general lack of available and, more
importantly, *affordable* spaces. Though, in truth, even the most expensive
spaces fail in this regard: richmond civic prolly one of the best in terms
of multiple rooms, but you'll still never escape the bass. Fashion center,
concourse, trocadero, caesars, townsend etc, fail as well. The best
solution to this I've ever seen was when imagination used both townsend *&*
king street; that was one *hell* of a chill room (all of king street).

But, to get to the point, in general, I think we're faced with having to
make the best possible use of spaces that meet many, if not all, of our
needs, the alternative being to do nothing (no music in chill room) at all.
I think that even given the constraints and problems currently under
discussion, both performers and the variety of other participants would
still prefer doing it as opposed to not. In the case of komotion we do have
plans to improve this situation. Unfortunately, these will not be realised
in time for the coming party, but rest assured that we are aware of and
concerned about the problem and will continue to address it to the best of
our ability. Anyone out there with experience in this area, we certainly
welcome your suggestions!

take it easy

Komotion makes for a pretty good TAZ, but it's just not very good for
having a main system and an ambient system. The front hall isn't very
big, has bad acoustics, and gets a lot of bleedover from the main
system. I'm surprised the last F&F worked out as well as it did,
considering the obstacles to overcome. It was also nice that the
ambient didn't try to compete with the sound level....it's hard to
chill when the chill room is really loud!

It'd be nice to further isolate the main room from the front hall, but
then it'd get way too hot. I'm trying to devise ways to get more cool
air into the main room, so maybe next party won't be so humid :).

I don't mind having other sound around whatsoever. This is the context of
the chill room and going to great lengths to change this doesn't serve
to much of a purpose... 

Sound is the *SUM* of all ingredients that go into its creation- chill rooms
are a *part* of the acoustic whole...

<Sound isolation is a problem only if you deem that the context must
 always include it.>

You bet I do!  
For instance, If I would go to a gallery to view some original art and
someone had spray painted some graffiti on it, I would be totally
devastated.  They are both artists in their own right, but definitely not
together.
You, as an artist have a perception of what you want your public to hear
and I'm sure you do not want some stray sound from another "performer" to
alter your original idea of what you want to project as a final sound
scape.
Yes, I do understand that the setting associated with "ambient" or "chill"
rooms in clubs or rave parties is beyond your control and you do need that
setting to expose your artform.  I don't want to picture myself as an
egocentric so I'm sure I could indeed sit through an entire set even in
that context (maybe with some mind altering substance though).
I'm delighted to hear that you (your group) will perform at Gaia Mantra.  I
think that it will be the perfect space for it....oh but the street
noise...sorry I just had to:)
Looking forward to experiencing the true you!  
Do post the date and time...I can't wait.

If I wanted there to be *no* interference with our sound we would make it so.
I don't mind the interference. It sort of creates a space where the mind can
tune into the ambient and tune out the beats. I have no problems doing this
and in fact the sensation that there is sound going on around me that I am
not tuned into is a pleasant one- sort of like being happily asleep in a room
filled with people. After having your attention focused on beats you will
usually find that the mind will happily wander and unfocus and enjoy
non-beat oriented music- or what i like to call ZERO BPM sound.

I'm working on a string of saturday afternoon shows which will feature
better acoustic surroundings.

#1) they were in a very un-safe place,   fire was appraching quickly
and later on,  they had to eventually evacuate the area....  They
were way too close to the trees.

#2) I was sorta freaked out,   somewhat dis-oriented,   and wanted to be
down by the river because I thought (And so did the rangers) it was safer.

#3) they ignored repeated warnings about the real danger of the fire
initially,

resonate sez:

<Sound isolation is a problem only if you deem that the context must

I sez:

Let's go back to basics (no pun intended) and consider what
ambient rooms, music, art, etc., is. I agree with resonate
that sound isolation is not a rquisite part of ambient art,
and in fact can be seen (or heard?) as quite extraneous to
an artist spraypainting another artist's work in a gallery
as being antithetical to ambient art as a misinderstanding of
ambience's concept.  The context--club, rave or party with its
main dance area's sound--is indeed an integral if background
part of ambience. At 90% of the raves I've attended over the 
years there has *not* been total or even major sound isolation.

Denis sez:

>Yes, I do understand that the setting associated with "ambient" or "chill"
>rooms in clubs or rave parties is beyond your control and you do need that

The fact that the setting is beyond the control of the ambient artist
is the whole point, wheteher it was Brian Eno's Music for Airports
which was one of the progenitors of this art form many years ago or
Adam Douglas's use of nature sounds mixed with techno bleeps in his
great Earthrise on the Silent label or the SPAZ folx downstairs at
last Saturday's Stevenson Street party where the upstairs thumping
was ever present, IM not so HO!

On sound isolation/interference: One thing to think about is John Cage's 
"4:33", where the pianist sits and does nothing for the allotted time.  
The background noise in the concert hall becomes the piece.

The constant droning of the main room can be both irritating and helpful 
in an ambient room, depending on the elaborateness of the environment you 
are trying to create.  When there's too much bleed from the main system, 
I tend to stray away from creating all-immersive environments and play a 
more abstract, noisy, bleepy set.

a piece of peace,

I can't think of much to say about the listings for this weekend, so
I'll ramble on about tonight.  The full moon parties haven't been starting
till about 3 or 4 in the morning, so if you want to get warmed up,
you might want to check out one of the many weeklies.  Soul Purpose
usually has good acid jazz DJs from the Mushroom Jazz crew, plus good
local live bands.   Lift probably has the deepest house on Thursdays; 
Jeno, Graeme and Spun are at Pure Space, with more of an SF sound;
Flour, if it's on this week, is more mellow at Deco.  For the South
Bay, Inspirations and Shake Yo Buddha both got some recommendations
a while back; I dunno if they're still happening.  I haven't heard much
about Universal Groove or Better Living thru Chemistry, so somebody
check them out and give us a report!  Finally, I'm still holding out
for Your Sisters' House to come back...

The only way I know to isolate sound at all effectively is by having 
double walls that are not connected to one another (except at top and 
bottom, I suppose)
About ten years ago, some friends of mine were putting together a movie 
theatre in Santa Cruz on Front St., and I remember discussing this with 
them. I will see if I can locate them and get more details.

this is just and idea...but i wanted to see how people felt about it...i 
have more  of a background in the visual arts....and i love chillout 
spaces...

so i was thinking...what if we added another element to chillout spaces...
kinda group exploration/art project...i love to build or make things 
while concentrating on music...it is both calming and inspiring...i 
always loved those murals on butcher paper that glowed in the dark that 
people drew on at big parties...

i was thinking some sorta group collage effort....or some computer 
graphics that can be manipulated by different people...i guess i would 
have to think about its direction and exacution a little bit more...

anyone interested? any ideas? susie(:

This is an *excellent* idea. One many of us have had and maybe done, but 
it's time to do it here! A good way to do this would be have an "Art 
Party"-- have some music, munchies, and whatnot, with paper, fabric, 
paints, pens, etc. that everyone can just go wild with. I just got some 
more fabric, in fact-- bannertime...

Anyone else?

I think that's a brilliant idea Susie.  

I once spent a few hours listening to ambient and painting with
black-light activated paints with a friend, it was great.  This
could be even better.

Oh, hey, I went to a Better Living Thru Chemistry!  Lessee...it was a few
weeks ago.  I don't remember that much, specifically, but I really liked
it.  The crowd seemed to be pretty fun and diverse; there was little
clubbiness or stuck-up-ness.  It was pretty crowded but not TOO much, and
the space was neither too big nor too small.  The dance space was ample and
dark, there were trippy paintings with black light, a big screen for
visuals, a laser...all kinds of stuff.  I don't recall being blown away by
the music or the sound system, but I was pleased.  There is a bar there,
which is a bit of a detriment, but there are also lots of chairs and tables,
a pool table or two, and a small balcony on which you could get some fresh
air and look out over the city (my understanding is that Chemistry is in the
same venue every week, a club around the corner from the Palladium where
there usually is, I think, salsa music).  And, bonus, it's only $5 with a
can of food. 

3.5 stars.  Joe Bob says check it out.  Sorry this isn't more detailed; our
friend Rocky was there as well that night, perhaps he has something to
add?...

I have scads of paper, art supplies, and even some fluorescent paints
that i was intending to bring to the next effandeff, and possibly the
4th instantiation of same.  i was also hoping to establish a graffiti
wall or several graffiti walls (one *must* be in the loo).  this is a
fine idea, and the more parties that have these kinds of things, the
better. i encourage people to bring supplies or creativity to all the
parties they go to.

 In regards to the recent topic of chill/ambient room isolation from
the main dance area , here's an idea that I came up with - and I
can't imagine that it hasn't been thought of before.

 For isolation - have the chill area and the dance area in completely dif
different buildings. Admission to one would be good for the other -
maybe hand stamps with the same design.

 Been done?

	Hi to the list...

	This is an introduction of sorts. Even though I've made the 
	occasional posting to the list, my contribution had been far
	from frequent. On and off I've been subscribed since this
	thing was created.

	I'm Gary, I live in Ayr, Scotland (For the moment)

	One of the reasons I'm not more of the familiar face around 
	here, is that I've felt fairly disconnected from a lot of 
	the goings-on I've been priviliged to read every day. After
	all, I am 6000 miles away - its not like I've the opportunity 
	to attend all the parties I hear you rave about.

	Well, thats about to change, In six or seven or eight weeks 
	time I'll be making my way to San Francisco. This is a large
	moment in my life. You see, its not just for a visit, its 
	permanent, I'll be living, working and playing in a city I 
	consider one of the most beautifull places I've ever been 
	lucky enough to experience.

	As you can tell, I'm pleased about the whole thing.

	Why ? How ? Well, my wife (Leigh Ann), I'm three months married, 
	is an American, and we've decided there's more over in America for
	us than over here. Initially I'll be staying in Montara, a 
	little place about 22 miles from San Francisco proper - just
	down the road from Half Moon bay. 

	So the point of this ? Well, I'd like to get to know some of
	you. I'd like to have some people I can call, go out with, a 
	few folks that know the scene. I'd like to make a few friends.

	Now I doubt I'll be out and about every night of every weekend,	
	its likely to more of an occasional thing. When I first get out
	I'm going to be more concerned with getting myself a job, and 
	then somewhere to live than the weekend scene. What I'm thinking 
	is that it would be nice to get to know a couple of people through
	mail - people I could get in touch with once I've made the
	move...

	Guess I'd better wind up, I've rambled away enough. If you feel
	you could introduce a Scot to the San Francisco scene, or would
	like to get to know me a bit better - feel free to reply, I'll 
	talk to the list as a whole, or individually in e-mail...

	Thanks, 
	Gary

I like my ambient music slow and memorable, like stuffed with the occasional
weird sample or catchy melodic hook.  I don't dig TRUE ambient much, as in
music you're not really supposed to listen to, for if that were the case, then
why make music at all?  There should be something to the music that would make
someone remember it or even just maybe wanna dance or hum along.

I've caught on to the Orb, but can anyone recommend any other ambient bands (or
record compilations, for that matter) in this vein?

Any monkey can twiddle around with a synth tone for half an hour, but it takes
a CREATIVE monkey to think of throwing in samples from the Sesame Street
episode sponsored by the letter 'L'.

Ahem.

What with the recent discussion of bleedthrough and "ambient" rooms,
I was discussing the topic with a friend last night.  He observed that
the issue may be one of expectation...if it's called "ambient" or "chill",
some folks may expect a pristine soundscape; said soundscape may not be
possible.  

In light of the recent suggestions for art projects done to "ambient"
music, might I suggest renaming the area to "Multimedia Lounge"?

thanks susie, i agree.

i also love the chill spaces, i think they are *essential*.  I like the idea
of a group exploration/art project and chill areas would in my opinion be a
good environment, provided there is enough space (not the narrow hall at
Komotion). For some strange reason:) i am usually infused with positive
energy and creating/making things in a collective way could be a very fun and
interesting outlet.

i think some collective collage or even individual stuff that could be
included/mixed in with the projections in the chill or main areas might be
interesting (although there are already some excellent collective visuals out
there).

i would be glad to help, with materials or in any other way...

peace

  Four easy to get nice collections from 93/94 that I personally like are:
  
   Secret Life of Trance
   Excursions in Ambience - a collection....
   Excursions in Ambience - second orbit
   United State of Ambience  

  These have artists such as Namlook, YAP, FSOL, Spicelab, Dubtribe Etc...

  Enjoy,

>>>It seems to me that most of the things that i have heard about wicked 
were pretty negative.  That's wierd, it seems like most of you went to 
wicked already expecting it to be lame.  I was there and I thought that 
it was one of the better parties that I have attended in awhile. <<<

I've allways had a good time at Wicked, it's the only party I'll gladly
pay $15 for because I know it will be worth it.
I'm really bummed that I missed it, I try to make it to all Wicked events,
especially those at Townsend (Richard Long sound system bumps!)
Anyways, I'm definately not going to miss the next one so I'll see ya there!

Jeno, Garth, Markie, and Thomas - What else do you need?

DJ's and Sfravers,

I have been a DJ in SF for 7 years and have accumulated many records
varying from house, modern and hip-hop. I have more house than any other 
category and I'm looking to scale it down. I have all types of house music from
techno (early) to deep.            

Here what I'd like to know:

For those intersted in spending >$300.00 please send me your name and 
number and I'll call you for a private listening. 

Others let me know if you'd be interested and how much you'd like to spend.

I'm still organizing them and probably won't be able to begin selling them
until the second week of August.

I plan price them depending on condition, import or domestic and rarity from
$1 to $20. There are over 700 house records which I plan to sell - all good.

Regards,

Eric :*)

Does anyone know who is producing/promoting this event with Fr. Matthew Fox?
It will be in October at Grace Cathedral. (Not sure if that's a Catholic 
or Episcopal church)
According to my source, this event will "combine music, video, computer 
technology, and High Church".

TIA

Maui

(((I tried to post this message 2 days ago from my new address on crl and it
never got here.  More problems...if this posting gets here twice don't blame
me...call crl.   So here goes)))


Well after reading all the postings concerning this topic, it occurs to me
that we may be talking about 2 different things here:
1) Chill-out rooms vs 2) Ambient performances.
This is also probably due to my original vague statement: "I think any
ambient dj would agree that the purpose of a chill out room is to create an
atmosphere where the music transport you into another world where the dream
is not interupted by annoying sounds."

Like Will Penna probably would say,"Lets get back to basics" and I would say:
"Lets take a step back here!"

1)CHILL OUT ROOMS. A few years ago when chill-out rooms started to get
popular, the places I used to hang out at had ambient music on a tape or CD
player only.  This music or set-up was definitely intended to be used as
background music.  Fine environment but it did not matter if you listened to
the music or not.  I saw it's use mainly as a "crash and burn" type
environment after 4:00 AM post dancing type thing.  (I'm sure it's still used
that way too).   

2)AMBIENT PERFORMANCE. Enters the much improved version, The era of A.
Paterson (Orb) phenomena craze, of bringing ambient music as a stand alone
serious music form to the night life.  Today it is common to hear "live" djs
spending an entire evening spinning records or in this case, playing
instruments to create and enhance the mood in the "chill-out" rooms.  I see
this as a totally different thing, this is now closer to an art form. 

Getting back to last Saturday, one detail I did not put in my posting was the
fact that I was informed that "resonate" (Steve) was going to P-E-R-F-O-R-M
and to get upstairs so not to miss anything. So again my observations are
only that it disapoints me that one can't fully enjoy the artists performance
(vision) without additional sound transfer in this venue.  

Is there a solution?  I think everyone's comments (Steve, Will, Bryce, Ethan,
Matthew....) are all very valid.  I guess to simply enjoy the music in the
present chill rooms (while understanding the shortfalls) or better yet, also
attending their special performances as named in previous postings.  

Just a little footnote here.  It is interresting to read the feelings and the
views of the actual performers about their music.  Enlightening and
surprising at the same time.......but keep on striving to achieve those
dreams and keep on performing to enrich the soul of us music lovers...like
me.

Denis,  ravnbird@crl.com (or jeffsharp@aol.com)


P.S.: Ethan, Bryce...I'll try to make myself available if you need help
setting up future events. (But probably not tearing it down 'cause it's
usualy way past my bed time.)

The problem is that majordomo here is set up so that if someone who's listed
as being on SFRaves tries to post to it, it gets forwarded to me and then 
I can judge whether to forward it along or not.  The volume of posts from
people with different addresses has surged recently for some reason, so 
PLEASE PLEASE before posting make sure you're posting from the same 
address you receive mail at, if at all possible.  If this is impossible 
let me know and I can add you to a list of approved addresses, but this
is an administrative nightmare I'd rather not do.  Thanks, and sorry about
the rant...

	Brian

p.s. - see you in Santa Cruz this weekend!
p.p.s. - how was the FM?

Subject: introductions...

	Howdy everyone.  I've been lurking about for a long time now, and 
seem to have been able to do so without really posting much.  SOOO... like
Gary from Scotland, I'm introducing myself!
	One of the great things about this list is the diversity it seems 
to incorporate, much like the music we all share a common interest in.  
We have such a broad spectrum of entities converging here, that it's 
really a beautiful thing.  Obviously, may of you know each other first-hand,
but I, being trapped in this desert they call Arizona, do not.  Being a 
"outsider" of sorts, I'm free to look in on our conversations through 
unbiased eyes.  With few exceptions, everyone seems to respect 
each other, and a environment of good "vibes" ( I hate that word ) and 
energy radiates from my screen.
	I s*bscribed to maybe get the lowdown on some music I haven't got 
my grubby little hands yet, and maybe get some ideas for more musical 
excursions.  I've got my own radio show on our college radio 
station (exposing the masses to my ambient stylings), so I wanted to see if I 
could find something new to add to my collection. But what I found I like the 
most is the way everyone interacts and talks about the raves.  We've got an 
okay rave "scene" out here, but nothing in respect to what you have.  Consider 
yourselves lucky, you've got a great thing.   	
	Actually, I have similar intentions as Gary, as I too will be in 
the area shortly, and would love to meet a few of you some night.  I 
want to experience SF raves, so I can further my explorations of sound 
by adding a new element to it...  GOOD raves, not our wanna-be raves.
	I'll be there next weekend (July 30-Aug. 1) for a little Family
Reunion thang.  I'm looking for some brave soul in the San Jose area that 
would be willing to pick me up and drag me around for a night,
probably Sat. (31st), and get me back that morning.  I'm flying up to 
Montana on Sunday morning with "the cool uncle" in his Cessna.  That is 
assuming I can get away from all the Aunts and Uncles gasping @ how much 
I've grown in the last 20-some years... comprende?

Any takers?

I too have a strong background in the visual arts. I've actually done 
a lot of collaborative work with people, both for serious art 
projects and just for fun. I've had several collaborative painting 
parties which have all resulted in great artworks.

I've found that acrylics work best for painting in these these kinds 
of situations because they dry quickly and are easy to work with in 
terms of clean-up (water soluable) and toxicity. Acrylics are also 
toxic, but not nearly so much as oil paints which require solvents 
for clean up and thinning.

A few problems I've encountered with collaborative works: people tend 
to get VERY protective AND VERY sensitive when it comes to creating 
things, especially if they are not used to doing this professionally. 
They usually have problems with it if someone comes along and adds 
to, obliterates, or otherwise monkeys with whatever they've done. At 
my painting parties, before we begin painting it is made clear to 
everyone present that they should not become attached to whatever 
they do. Still, people get bent out of shape. Then there is usually 
somebody there that MUST obliterate everything that anyone else does, 
consciously or not. The only way to deal with that is to let that 
person know what you see going on and hopefully they will calm down 
and stop trying to enforce their aesthetic. I've never tried to say 
"leave everything as the artist lays it down". I don't think it 
really works to produce a finished piece that way, but if you're not 
looking for a solid finished piece of art then I don't see why it 
would not work to have a rule about people not mucking around with 
other people's creations. Though I think it would result in a 
visually "choppy" piece that way, and rules, well.... After art 
parties at my house the people involved are much closer. We go 
through a lot of stuff staying up all night painting and figuring out 
ways to work together while maintaining a sense of individual 
aesthetic.

Yes, I'm ALWAYS interested in art parties! A chill room art scene 
would probably be somewhat different than these things that I've 
hosted before. I could see painting getting a little messy or out of 
hand...maybe. Collage, yes! I can see piles and piles of old 
magazines, scissors and lots of white glue on huge pieces of butcher 
paper. Add crayons and markers to that. I'm sure people would bring 
things to add (jewelry and plant matter, etc.). Hang a roll of 6 ft. 
wide paper on the wall and just roll it off onto the floor as 
needed...

Since it seems like there's going to be a good number of us SFRavers at
tomorrows Zippy event, wouldn't it be a good idea if we had hauled out some
SFRaves badges.  I for one would love to meet some of the faces behind the
names, and since I've just recently become a permanent SF resident I
haven't really met any of you in person yet (except for the Cap'n, and
that's just because he's everywhere :)

So whadya think? ;)

A group of young people who have formed an alternative community in 
Sheffield, England will be producing the Rave Mass. They have developed 
Rave Masses and other community services which include the use of the 
rave & and multimedia idioms.

Matthew Fox was a Catholic priest but got booted out a year or two ago 
but has been taken in by the more liberal Episcopal Church.

Matt Fox is a recognized author and the founder of the Institute For 
Creation Spirituality at Holy Names College in Oakland.

I happened to attend a couple of talks at The ICS summer workshop last 
week which were quite stimulating. One was from the Seneca-Iriquois 
teacher Jose Hobady who spoke on native spirituality, ritual & dance and 
the other I attened was from cosmologist and ecological advocate Brian 
Swimme. He is the Director of the Center For the Story of the Universe @ 
the Calif Inst.. of Intergral Studies and quite an inspiring thinker.

Matthew Fox will be partaking in dialogue with noted biologist and 
philospher Rupert Sheldrake Aug. 25, 7:30 PM at Grace Cathedral. The talk 
is entitled "Ritual , Resonance & the Return of the Angels". Should be 
quite interesting, the only draw back is that admission is a bit pricey 
($18), maybe the promoters of this talk should arrange some kind of 
slideing scale.

That's what I know at the moment.

I just finished talking with James, one of the organizers of Vivid
Pronoia, and he asked me to let you all know that they have lost a
permit for their original space.  Consequently, they will be having
the party out of doors: the afternoon location will be in the mountains,
and the evening location will be on the beach.  The event will now be
entirely free, and is all ages.  Location information should be posted
shortly, and the numbers are: 408.247.4955, 415.292.3289, and 415.905.8800.

Re: ambient compilations. I highly recommend "Feed Your Head vol.1"  on 
Planet Dog Records. It is very, very good. Vol.2 will be coming out soon. 
Great tracks from Astralasia, Banco De Gaia, System 7, Eat Static, Tuu 
and others. Check it out!! Many compelling , deep trax.

I just logged on and will probably see that someone else has already
recomended this in the next few posts but just in case:

Aphex Twin -  Selected Amient Works I or II.

Also for space music style ambience:

Brian Eno - Ambient 4 On Land (Highly recomended - *****)
Michael Sterns - Planetary Unfolding (Way highly recomended but
not because it's better than Eno's Ambient 4 On Land but because
it's lesser known, Michael Sterns + Serge synthesizer = 1!

I am going to post a short excerpt from an interview with a defrocked 
priest who is taking a different, more constructive approach to religion 
& spirituality than the Catholic church.

Anyone who is offended by my posting something involving religion can 
flame the hell out of me-- I see this guy as healing a breach.

(the following has been excerpted, without permission, from San Francisco 
Focus magazine's interview with Fr. Matthew Fox)

SFFocus: Is there room in the Episcopal Church for your kind of spirituality?

Fox: I think so. I'll give you an example-- it's the main thing that's 
drawing me there. Last August, I had just finished writing "The 
Reinvention of Work'. The last chapter was on ritual, how we need rituals 
to create community support. We were doing a summer program in Seattle, 
and four people flew in from Sheffield, England. The oldest was a 33 year 
old Anglican priest, and their story was they have a community there of 
200 people, in their 20's reinventing the form of the Mass. The result is 
they have some 500 or so people coming to this Mass; average age 27. This 
is mind-blowing-- it's a miracle. There probably aren't 7 people in their 
20's going to church anywhere else in England on Sunday. These are 
blue-collar people. Sheffield is the Youngstown, Ohio of England, the 
birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, and it's in a total depression 
now. These young people come out of abusive situations-- economic, 
political, drugs, alcohol, all of it. They're plugged into the Rave 
culture there, and in the Mass they use Rave music and dancing and media.

SFFocus: Did you get an opportunity to see it firsthand?

Fox: I went over in November to experience it. It's held in the basement 
of a sports complex, a round room, and they have 42 television sets, 12 
videos, and projections all over the walls: galaxies dancing, to atoms, 
DNA, and so forth. The altar is a big, round white table with projections 
on it from above, colors and forms that change throughout the service, 
and they create the videos every other week for the Mass. There's also 
live television happening during the Mass, but the reading of the 
Scripture is on all the television sets and video screens simultaneously. 
   
The first response I had was that this is a very friendly experience for 
a generation raised on television. The second response I had was that 
these people are taking television away from the broadcasters. They're 
doing it live. Where? At the heart of a community. That's why it was so 
interesting and powerful. And yet it is the Mass-- you can recognize the 
form of the Mass within it.

I came back and talked with Bishop Swing in San Francisco, and we're 
planning such a Rave Mass in the basement of Grace Cathedral in October. The 
Sheffield Community is going to send ten people over, their best artists 
and techno artists, for a 2 year commitment to get the community going 
here in America, here in the Bay Area.

SFFocus: So this will be ongoing?

Fox: Yes. Eventually, we hope to coordinate the Mass with a conference 
for Silicon Valley on spirituality and TechnoArt. Technology is promising 
us 500 video channels and an information superhighway. But is that 
highway going to take us faster and deeper into the hell of consumerism, 
or can the new technology being born right here lead us to the next level 
of human evolution, which has to have something to do with spirituality? 
That's the challenge we want to give to Silicon Valley.

Do raves in NYC have altars?  My guess is no; I may be very wrong but I
would think that this is an SF thing rather than a rave thing...

Hello,

Does anyone know what downloading the image.ps version of the imag file
will get me?  Are there pictures or what?  Or just prettier typeface
than the regular image file? (I already have the latter and the .ps
version is pretty big)

I do have postscript capability...

thanks,

    Ken

Actually none of those people had any *interest* in conflict.

Their only interest was the love inside themselves and everyone else.

However, they did not *shun* conflict if it became necessary to
accomplish their mission.   To shun or exclude anything is to give it
importance...

Well, this "current school of thought" is not really current, in fact it
is the oldest recorded thought, period.

The basic problem of activism is that it comes from the ego of "I know
what is best for everyone".

"Higher spirituality" consists of removing yourself from the limited,
closed-in perspective of your own ego, so that you can resume the
natural state of a higher perspective.

The "signs and symptoms" are simply a sign post of how you are doing in
that endeavor.

Christ, Buddha and Gandhi were all coming from that non-ego/self-less
perspective, and what they did was in the best interests of everyone.

Note that Christ refused to take part in any revolution against the
Romans, despite the oppression going on.  Not exactly an activist.

Buddha renounced his position as crown prince - a very influential
position - in order to seek enlightenment.

requires an "us" and "them" perspective.

I don't see any inconsistency between bliss and nonviolent resistance,
especially when you consider that Gandhi did both.

If someone really feels there is an inconsistency, that would mean that
they come to raves, which are generally blissful and non-political, only
to distribute flyers and/or recruit people for causes...

P.C. ???

Just the opposite!

Does this sound right - "Hillary Rodham Clinton and Eleanor Smeal are
not interested in conflict or interpreting actions, they just let things
happen".
No way! :-)  "Some Signs & Symptoms" is definitely not P.C. :-)

In P.C. if there is one oppressed cockroach somewhere, then an entire
campaign of angry letters to congressmen is required, plus daily
appearances in all the media. :-)

It comes froms the Vedas, estimated to have been written roughly about
10,000 years ago.

It would take some hours of research to rigorously demostrate this. I'll
seen what I can dig up that might be less rigorous...

No, I just mentioned in the last message that Jesus refused to be an
activist.  In fact, that was why he was killed.  As long as everyone is
distracted by the Judaea vs. Rome, Clinton vs. Bush, etc. then the
status quo is NOT threatened.  What is threatening to the status quo is
that Jesus and Gandhi asked people not to be selfish, to love/help your
neighbor.  Gandhi was killed AFTER his non-violent campaign caused the
British to give India its independance.  He was killed because he THEN
started advocating that Hindus and Moslems love each other and get along.

The whole idea of being ego-less and self-less is very threatening to
both individuals and the status quo.

Okay, could you list what on the list strikes you as "mindless"?
This could be semantics, really.  In order to be truly mindful, ie in
the sense of aware, you have to turn off your "mind", ie the chatterbox
in your head...

I re-read the list after reading this point and, really, the only one
that refers to this whole discussion is that same one:

6.  Loss of interest in conflict.

Whereas Tony posted that the problem is in the term here "conflict", I
think that the crucial word is "interest".

In the ego-less state one has no interest in conflict.  If, however,
circumstances dictate that conflict is the necessary and proper course
of action, then conflict is not shied away from.  To shy away from
something, is actually to be interested in it, in that one is interested
in avoiding it.  If one neither embraces nor avoids something, one is
not interested in it.

Indeed, someone who was interested in conflict would have no reason to
resort to "non-violence".

I don't yet have the time to find my Upanishads to rigorously document
this, so I'll just go from general memory.

>5.  Loss of interest in interpreting actions. [of others]

What others do is irrelevant, everything of value is within yourself, so
all that you need to do is focus on the love within yourself (atman).

All actions of others are due to karma [perhaps messages on
hyperreal.com are due to hyperkarma :-) :-)].  Their karma, in turn, is
due to their actions.  Escaping this vicious circle is only through
focusing on the love within yourself.

>6.  Loss of interest in conflict.

Same answer as for 5.

>7.  Loss of ability to worry.  (this is a very serious symptom)

When you are focused on the love within yourself, what possibly could
there be to worry about?  If you say "but what if" or "but what about",
then that consists of a lack of focus.

11.  Increasing tendency to let things happen rather than make them
happen.

This is the more esoteric one (perhaps that is why it is at the end).
The mystics all describe that when they let go of their own petty
desires, and aligned themselves with the love within, then things happen
of their own accord, without their own puny intervention.  When they
aligned themselves with the love within (atman), they automatically
aligned themselves with the world (brahman, Gaia) and being aligned with
the world, things in the world happened in alignment with them in return.

Yes.  This paragraph is more evidence in support of my position :-).  I
was going to put in this paragraph, but I didn't want to make the post
too long.

>Remember when he said "Render unto Caesar the things that
>are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's"?

The previous sentence is "Whose face is on this coin?" "Caesar's".

The meaning of this is (in the context of the taxation without
representation of 2000 years ago) that there is no point in contesting
worthless material things.  The "things that are God's" are the
spiritual things - Peace, Love, Unity, Respect.  Elsewhere Jesus says
"my two commandments are Love God and Love Your Neighbor".  So, it's
PLUR for God and PLUR for your "neighbor".  (How you interpret "God" is
your own personal choice.)

The other jews were upset that he refused to lead a activist rebellion
against Rome, so when the high-priests (jewish establishment) made the
Romans arrest him, no one came to his aid other than his disciples.

Then Pontius Pilate asked him "Are you the King of Jews", he answered in
such a seemingly vague way that, after some further questions, Pilate
announced that he could find no crime.

NOT!  Whereas you definitely COULD use P.C. to describe those things
that right-wing republicans automatically assume are true, it just isn't
done.  Useage in the 90's refers to left-wing liberal rigidity and lack
of a sense of humor about their objectives; it especially refers to
where institutions try to prevent speech that says anything about a
specific group of people (cf the concurrent 'stereotyping' thread on
sfraves :-) :-) ).

>In New Age circles I've seen lists like this list held up before
>as guides for right livelihood, not people like the
>two above!

NOT!  Please excuse the stereotyping :-) but New Age overwhelming
consists of people who have the same PC speech taboos described above
and are VERY MUCH in favor of activism for left-wing liberal causes.

The Signs and Symptoms is very much at odds with the New Age - which is
one reason why it fits raving so well :-) :-).

New Agers are ALWAYS interpeting EVERYTHING :-).  They're ALWAYS
WORRYING :-).  They're ALWAYS acting due to fears based on past
experiences.   And they're ALWAYS judging their self. :-)

Whoa, we're not even talking the same genre here.  I even thought this
was in a different thread.

The above is basic ethics.

The Signs and Symptoms of Inner Peace is the relationship between me,

Hello,

Supposedly there have been e-mail problems at our internet supplier that
are "fixed" now.  Grrrr [sound of loss of inner peace :-) :-) ].

So, if you've sent me anything about tape trades or whatever over the
last 1-10 days, I may not have received the message.

later,

Because this is such a ridiculous question that the only result of the
question can be the thought -- why did this person ask this question?

(Can you imagine posting to someone on alt.cult-movies "Do you ever go
to see movies?" or to someone on alt.soccer "Do you ever watch soccer?")

The only plausible reason has to do with:

But you see there is a BIG problem with this.  All that has happened is
that you've moved someone from within the "them" circle to the "us"
circle.  What we need is to do this with EVERYONE - ie eliminate the
"them" circle.  As I mentioned to you in private e-mail (I hope you
received that), what set me off was that the supposed "narc" was treated
with prejudice as "them".  What was stupid on my part was to treat the
person who did that, as "them" :-).

The idea that we're supposed to be introduced and then never take
exception to false statements :-) :-) seems pretty silly to me.

>

Greater understanding of what?  I have friends I see every week (as a
group) and I know less about them than I know of many people I converse
with on e-mail - because of what I said before about the usual
meandering nature of conversations.

> It also allows you to meet people
>with whom you'd otherwise not exchange email and in that way extend
>your connections with the community.

Ah, but this is the opposite of my question.  If I go to a rave, meet
someone, and say "How can I contact you later?", that person might say
"Do you have e-mail?".  This has nothing to do with meeting people we
know on e-mail previously.

>raves.

But again, this also works in reverse, otherwise there would be no rave
scene at all.  Someone throws a rave, people discover that there are
other people like them who are willing to take a chance in order to
experience the love vibe, they exchange phone numbers (and/or e-mail
addresses), meet at cafes or for lunch, etc.

>Nothing beats first-hand experience, be it of music, of that ephermeral
>quality known as "vibe," or of another person.

But this is just what I said in the part of my post that you deleted in
your response.

And we all do all of those things.  But I feel that we should interact
with EVERYONE on e-mail (or elsewhere) as if they were a close friend.
I'm unlikely to ever rave with Tony in Miami or Sigi in Australia or
Chrome in Amsterdam -- should I treat them differently??

Interestingly, the question at the top came at the end of a thread where
the OTHER person was advocating the place of "conflict" and THEN feels
the need to meet in person because we've been having this e-mail conflict.
:-) amazingly ironic :-).

This touches on the larger question of meeting people that one writes to
on the net.  My viewpoint is that I don't see a need to.

I find e-mail a superior verbal communication to either the telephone or
in person.  E-mail allows you to sit down when YOU have time to
comfortably think about what you are reading.  On the phone or in
person, two things happen:

(1) I can't fully relate all that I'd like to say about the topic
because it takes a moment or two to collect my thoughts.
(2) I find that in 80% of cases, the conversation veers into a different
direction before an interesting aspect is discussed.

Now, there is, of course, the non-verbal aspects which are very much
enhanced in person.  But, I'm married :-) and I find that the other
non-verbal aspects, ie raving, happen just being in the room with
everyone.

So, what is the advantage of associating a specific physical body with a
specific e-mail address :-) ?

respect,

    Ken

In addition to the "ambient I love" things
that others have mentioned, one by Steve Hilage
that I've had for 15 years:

Rainbow Dome Musick
Virgin Records VR 1
with Steve Hillage, Miquette Giroudy, and Rupert Atwill
compositions are "Garden of Paradise" by Miquette Giroudy
on side one and "FourEver Rainbow" by Steve Hillage on side
two.

This is post-Gong Hillage and sounds  (to me) even more
Orb-y than the future work Hillage would do with System 7.

Has it ever appeared on CD? Are there other Hillage things
like this from this time (1979)?

My copy is  still in excellent shape if anyone would like
a taped copy (I have no idea if it's rare or not).

ciao,
Will

Maui--

Thanks for the relevant excerpt of the sf focus
interview with Mathew Fox! This background *does*
relate to our community as ravers, and for the many
of us who do not get sf focus it was worthwhile reading!

ciao,

p.s. (TO just Maui and Susan): Sorry for mixing-up those

I am boggled by the recent stream of posts debating the merits of meeting 
people one talks to via email.

It seems obvious to me that meeting folx face to face is great if it can 
be done. If it can't, that's okay too. 'Nuff said!

I need to email Kerry, who knows Everett Zero. This is re: projector.
We haven't been able to get ahold of Everett-- his vmail says he's "back 
in town"... since you offered, Kerry, could you contact him for Susan? It 
would be highly appreciated :)

Attention Kmart shoppers
Man, John Travolta is all over the tabloids
Control the press

Speed freaks and bikers 
What is a Zippy?
(just kidding - please don't answer!)

I went dancing in Seattle the other week
at a place called ReBar.  It was funk night
on Sunday and was crowded and fairly fun.
	
Immersed for the weekend in loungy clubs, cocktail parties,
and coffee shops I was compelled to find a place
where I could move at a faster tempo.
It was near Capitol Hill.

Love ya,
Dave

I'm going back home to seattle after several years away.
Are there any decent Rave style spots up there?
I remember the main stream house clubs-blaaaaaaa!
I'm looking for a place a little more sexually mixed.

Anyone know about this? Sat. 23 is what someone told me but no one else has
heard about it.  What is it, where, who? Why do I care? I don't but my friend
does and I said I'd try and find out...

Hello,

The tigerteam.org site has been having some severe problems,
one symptom was re-sending messages which were already sent,
SO my apologies for the stuff from a week ago that got re-posted!

But, any new subscribers, feel free to comment anyway! :-)

Well, welcome home Patrick!

>Are there any decent Rave style spots up there?

The house community up here is generally a here and there, every or 
every-other weekend warehouse-party scene with a few club weeklies 
thrown in for good measure.  There are a lot of smaller, more private 
house parties cropping up here and there, more free outdoor events and 
generally smaller things happening as of late.  As you'll see below, 
there are also things happening in other nearby cities that supply a 
bit of everything for everyone.  Still, it could use a little more of 
everything too, that wouldn't hurt.  At least _I_ wouldn't mind...

>I remember the main stream house clubs-blaaaaaaa!
...some things never change...

>I'm looking for a place a little more sexually mixed.
Well...I don't exactly know what you mean by that.  Other than sheer 
numbers, that could mean a lot of things.  But I'd hazard a guess that 
it's not going to be like what you're used to down there.  More often 
than not, people play it down up here, and it works.  Whatever.  To 
paraphrase an old idiom, "let whomever do whatever their thing is..."

Although IMO some of that was good, I thought a lot of it was rather dull.  Too
much monotony.  There *were* some good songs on it though.

Well, I guess I mean that FSOL put a lot of brains and talent into their
albums, unlike a lot of techno/ambient stuff coming out now, and that has come
out in the past.  "Cascade" is almost as complex as some of the great works of
Mozart or Beethoven, and are very listenable.  Of course, this is all an opinion.

Subject: VIVID PRONOIA-What the F@CK HAPPENED!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Last night my friends and I drove down to Santa Cruz from the City to attend
Vivid Pronoia. I must say it was a rather disappointing event! Although it
started out quite well, ( the visuals and music at the school were above par)
it rapidly disintigrated.
Problems:
1.) Moving a party a 11:00 at night is a really stupid idea when no mass
trans. is provided, i.e. a bus! While leaving I saw a LOT of people driving
really fucked up on a number of drugs. Very uncool! This is supposed to be a
healthy movement, not a stupid one, we don't need a car load of Ravers
smeared across the road, with the potential of killing other drivers.
2.) The directions to the after party where rather vague. My friends and I
drove up and down the coast for an hour trying to find that spot. I wasted a
lot of gas :-(  not good for the environment.
3.) Upon finding the spot 1 1/2 hours after leaving the first party none of
the promoters had showed up yet! The people who were there were wondering
what was going on..
4.) Who invited the guys in the big suburban and their friends? They were
definitely not part of the family! my friends and I asked if they would play
a Garth tape on their monster car stereo, to be told that "we don't like
House music"! Pardon me, but who the hell invited you, and WHY do you WANT to
be here?
I must say at this point that I do not look down on other peoples tastes in
lifestyles( variety is the spice of life), but there are times when people
with different agendas just should not mix.

last one:
5.) What the hell happened down in the lower parking lot?
I was sitting in my car, and  heard the sound of someones windshield being
smashed in, turning around I saw some guy (definitedly not part of the
FAMILY!) going apeshit on the hood of someones car ( a white GOLF or Jetta I
think_) who was trying to get out of the lot. A minute later this same fine
gentleman is kicking in the window of a green nova completely in a rage. I
could not believe my eyes! A few moments later he's kicking the shit out of
some young kid! I would like to applaud who ever it was who reached in and
grabbed the kid at that point, I hope he was taken to get medical help and is
O.K.!
 I was rather dissapointed with myself and others that no one stepped in to
stop this asshole, but somehow I can feel that we can be forgiven seeing that
we are not an arms carring bunch, I hope! I think I was afraid that he would
pull a gun or one of his friends would. 
Those are my gripes about last night. I must say that that was definetly the
last out door rave I go to where there is no security (with the exception of
the full moon, and Sunset)
 I've been reading all this mail with people whinning about the cost of some
of these partys,To tell you the truth, I really have NO problem paying $15 to
be in a SAFE environment.
Having jumped in and out of the Rave scene over the past four years (was at
floppy's when that was still going, been to parties in L.A. with several
thousand people in attendence) Never have I experienced what I did last
night. It really made me sad, and the long car ride home was rather glum. ( I
don't think I've ever used that word before, funny sounding word, GLUM, GLUM,
GLUM... Sorry just felt I needed to get that out of my system).
ON A MORE UPBEAT NOTE:
I must say that I did have a blast at last weekends COME UNITY, as well as
the Full Moon Party. I'd like to thank the cops  for being smart (how
unusual!) and letting us stay friday morning. Or should I thank the person
who talked them into letting us stay, since we were all too messed up to
drive. Besides dancing is healthy and doesn't hurt anyone. I've been drinking
milk, and some day I'm going to be as good as John Travolta.
Peace, Love, Groovyness, and all that other mushy crap...

P.S. If anyone else saw what I did last night and would like to discuss it,
please don't hesitate to write me!

Subject: MESS! : a review of sorts.

Although I've known about Mother Earth Sound System for some time, I've never
been to one of their parties for more than a few minutes, until Friday's
shindig in Berkeley.  Was I impressed!

First let me tell you a bit about the venue.  It was a vegetarian co-operative
(mostly) student household called Lothlorien.  Throughout the years it has
had many laid-back and happy people pass through its doors and leave their
concentrated vibes on its walls, much as a pipe collects resin.  Needless
to say, it's a great place to have a rave.  I had had the idea myself of
having a party there when I was living there, but I didn't think it would
happen because it is, after all, a house where people live and sleep.  But
the MESS crowd somehow talked them into it.  (As i understand it, people
there are more accepting of ravers than in the past.  I'm told I was the
first person to play techno on the house stereo, but these days it's a
fairly common occurrence.  Good to know I left my legacy behind.)

At any rate, the party definitely deliverd its promise.  Who was spinning
around 10:30, 10:45, and what would you call that kind of music?  It sounded
a lot like commercial techno in some ways, but with a low cheesiness
factor.  Great stuff, and that quality was upheld throughout the night.

The crowd was really lively and friendly.  My favorite article of clothing
was a young woman's T-shirt which, due to a vaguely formed "l" and "o",
said equally "love" and "Rave".  I suppose that most of the crowd were
Berkeley students, given the proximity to the University, and if so, that
opened my eyes.  For some bizarre reason I dont know _that_ many Berkeley
student ravers, and I never cease to be amazed at the sheer numbers of
them.  (I even spotted one or two people I hadn't seen at a rave in ages --
remember Sheryl, Brian?)  We ought to have a Berkeley Student Raver lunch or
picnic!  The point is, the vibe was magnificient.

A couple of people were incredulous at the fact that I was wearing earplugs,
and I took a moment to explain to a few of them the Gospel According to
Lerner, of which (at least with regards to hearing protection) I am now a
devoted disciple.  I think you can actually hear things BETTER through
earplugs; everything's quieter, but sharper, and different sounds don't
bleed into each other, forming aural mush.

Best of all, I got my good friend Laurel to come, who is a woman of such
great intelligence, intensity, spirituality, and beauty that her continued
presence on the scene could not but help.  SHe had a blast.  I think she's
still a little shy about really letting loose and contributing to the vibe,
but I'm sure she'll improve with repeated exposure.

Unfortunately, I had to leave rather early as I've been sick (sniffle) the
last couple days and I don't have very much energy.  But I was definitely
glad I went, if nothing else to soak up the healing powers of house.  (And
how I could pass up a free party 2 blocks from my apartment?)

Peace,
stevie

  Yesterday's Vivid Pronoia at the Mountain school started well enough 
 (although I didn't arrive until 7 or so). Then as Laura was saying later
 "It was weird". At one point people were going to "talk". The music was
 stopped - strange stuff was affoot with the DJ's - lack of communication
 and planning happened (apparently no leadership). Pinkus? the "road warrior
 dude" took over the mic and became F. Clark "by definition". What was he
 talking about? F. Clark took over the mic - began got lost, began got lost
 began got lost... Is this the spokesperson for nationally famous Zippies?
 The talks became diffuse.. the music became diffuse - not DJ's fault. 
 Finally, a bit later the flow started back ...
 Good music, good visuals - some of the best computer visuals I've seen of
 late! so as darkness fell - the party was on. Ethan was spinning a good
 set and then -- here come the police. Close down time - at least this was
 expected since it had been announced. It had also been announced that a
 renegade was "planned" for the later evening...

 OK. the road warrior gave out directions to what turned out to be a GREAT
 site. Is it usable? Don't trash it. By telling us to go to Ano nuevo and
 how many miles past the deed was done properly. I watched my odometer -
 and sure enough we were there! But where was the music? We waited, and
 waited... there had been no planning for the sound system. DJ's with tunes
 were plentiful but no system. I was talking with Aaron(sp?) from SPAZ and
 at one point we agreed the site was big enough for two major sound systems.
 Unfortunately, no body had one. Keep this site in mind. Now for that 
 previous post.  As Crunch and I were walking in we came upon a group of
 "gentlemen" - I previously started a flame war describing the type -
 Sean uses "testosterone types" I believe and this will do... They asked
 Crunch and me "Are you ravers?" - loaded question. Crunch handled himself
 well - they joked about a "slightly used shotgun and a knife to cut my
 hair" - Crunch and I moved on.. This vibe was not at the Mountain school
 so how did it show up at the renegade? Later I went to a party with a guy
 who was beaten up by someone at the site - Could this have been the one
 observed in the previous post? Some people at the site watch too much MTV
 and had the "gangsta attitude" down to a stereotype... avoid, avoid...

 Crunch found another renegade so off down the coast to below Moss Landing
 we went. A small group of cars in the middle of a nice field. Deaks was
 one of the DJ's - these folks had gotten together a system on short notice
 set up in about 30 minutes, DJ tables on the trunk of a car, small but 
 adequate sound system and about 40-50 people were off dancing and hanging
 out until well after sun rise - good vibe guys. Now if only the Vivid 
 people had planned as well!  

 There sure are adventures out there in the land of renegade raving but
 danger seems to lurk as well....

  Are the various governmental "protection services" - police, park Etc.
  watching for rave (or other?) activities along the Santa Cruz coast ?
  Perhaps as as aftermath of Boony Dune ?

  I ask because as we were going up the coast looking for the rave site
  Cap'n Crunch was driving behind me and I was following a string of cars
  lead by a slow "white bus". The bus pulled into a parking lot as did the
  string of cars - we hadn't reached "the described site" yet so I continued
  slowly but Crunch flashed and turned into the lot also. I U'ed back into
  the lot. The self described "hippies in the bus" said we're no party we
  just stopped to get some sleep. As I got back in my truck I noticed a
  ranger truck had already arrived ( in about 3 minutes ).   

  Later at the site Laura commented on seeing the "white bus" go by so I
  will assume that the rangers told the bus to "be on its way" which 
  would be totally unfair since I had noticed many camper and RV type
  vehicles parked along the road - presumably to "get some sleep also" and
  I assume they were not systematically asked to "move on". 

  Once at the site which was in San Mateo Co. no authorities showed up (so
  far as I know) during the several hours I was there. I'm interpreting
  this fact as - authorities in Santa Cruz being "on alert". Is this a
  reasonable assumption? If it is planners might want to keep this in mind.
  (We did have a nice small gathering with Deaks et. al. later but this
   was way south of Santa Cruz and inland - not on a beach.) No trouble there
  either...

 
  Keep music going strong,
  Mike Clay

	I will never understand the endless fascination with having
	parties in Santa Cruz. I lived there for 4 years during the
	ascent of the rave scene and heres some info for you.

	Santa Cruz is a tourist/resort town. The police there are
	*specialsts* in the artform of busting people who are camped/
	partying/etc...  on beaches/forests/ranches etc. They *know*
	every site up and down the coast and in the forest.

	The Santa Cruz police are recruited locally and from the very close
	relationship the SCPD has with the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk Security
	force- who are most often on a career path towards SCPD. They are
	not sophisticated urban police who "have better things to do with their
	time than bust a bunch of suburban kids out dancing." This is exactly
	what SCPD are there for. To bust people who are partying out of bounds
	in this tourist/resort town.

	Santa Cruz sites are 100% dead ends. There are easy to box in by
	police and rangers.

	Why are people so bent on going down there? If they want a non-urban
	spot they should go *north* out of the city and away from the major
	population centers like Silicon Valley.

	If you want to have a party in santa cruz and enjoy the natural
	landscape the best bet is to simply get in touch with a student at
	UCSC and plan a daytime dance party in any number of the UCSC
	amazing viewpoint/gathering areas.

Here's one reason:  some of us live in Santa Cruz, and are not UCSC
students either.  It does happen...

The police up north can be even worse sometimes, not to mention that many 
of the residents are unfriendly to our using their (in the collective 
sense) land. At least many of the beaches are far enough that it poses a 
problem for any serious "law" enforcement, but I've known of a couple 
occasions where residents along the roads out there have called in a 
"suspicious group of cars heading west." I know of very few people who 
have pulled something off anywhere inland in Marin.

But where there's a will, there's always a way, I guess (and hope).

This weeks Sunset party at the Berekely Marina was one of the best yet. 
The weather was really nice, there was a real friendly group of people 
and lots of dancing. 

I definitely needed it after the disappoiting Zippy party.

The Zippies really didn't impress me. They mostly seemed like overgrown 
kids trying to massage their egos. Maybe they should go back and read 
some real Zen (or other teachings) and grow up.

Looking forward to then next New Moon party and subsequent Sunsets.

Yes, and this appears in Dr. Alex Patterson's top 12 ambient albums list.

It has appeared on CD.

No, there really isn't any other Hillage albums that are similar to this
one.   Most of the rest of his work is hippie/trancey/jazzy, similar to
Gong, but less exoticly weird.   His best is "Live Herald" with some of
my favorite rock guitar work ever.

The whole System 7 thing is interesting, because in England, the words
"Hillage" and "hippie" are entirely synonymous (even more so than
"Grateful Dead" and "hippie" here).

I also second the recommendation for Michael Stearns' "Planetary
Unfolding"; most of his albums are good ambient ("Plunge" is jazz, though).

Hence nothing to worry about...

I was talking to a friend this weekend who said there was a shooting at the
Moonlight Mass (Massive?) rave this weekend in LA.  MM is supposed to be LA's
equivalent of our FMR.  This was a free outdoors party where you're on your
honor not to bring guns or your bad vibe to the scene.  Unfortunately this
was not the case.  

This event brought up a good point about security.  Yes, we have to wait an
extra 1/2 hour or longer sometimes to get in because security wants to search
EVERYTHING.  Don't you think this is a fair trade off to keep us safe?

I know we're not LA and I certainly am not comparing - I just hope we never
have anything like this happen at our FMR, Sunset or equivalent free outside
event where there is no security - it sure would blow the vibe for future
raves of that kind. 

So next time you are being searched and are frustrated just remember what
happened that night in LA.  And remember to bring your PEACE and not your
PIECE!

Peace and positivity,

I have a friend that is in Chicago for a couple of weeks testing a game 
called Iron Helix . He is interested in any fun spots related to raveing. 
Anything from deep house to hard trance it doesn't matter-he just wants a 
taste of the city..

cheers

I'll forward a post to SoCal-Raves that had a news article
right now i think most of the attentive list is in a minor state of shock

BUT, just to throw in some comments here..

Moonlight Massive is held down in San Diego, not LA
LA has its own parties to have problems with :)
(although the LA full moon parties are probably the last places
i would expect to see anything even close to this)

Shots ring out; 2 teen-age revelers die

by Cheryl Clark and Pauline Repard
Staff Writer

  For months, two National City mothers fought separate battles with 
their 15-year-old sons, trying to keep them away from all-night rave 
parties.
  But Gustavo Maldonado and his best friend, Jorge Alberto Villarino Jr., 
didn't listen to their mothers.  They went to the parties anyway.  One in 
particular on Friday nights along the railroad tracks of Old Town was 
rumored to be a smash.
  Today, both are dead from shotgun blasts, fired at them as they 
congregated with about 250 other partygoers near Taylor and Juan streets 
about 4 a.m. yesterday.
  An anonymous tip led police to a 20-year-old Paradise Hills man who 
sat in a pickup that was boxed in by other cars parked in a nearby lot.  
The suspect, Mark Jonathan Morales, was arrested and booked into the 
county jail on suspicion of two counts of murder.  A loaded shotgun was 
confiscated from the cab of the pickup, police said.
  Jorge was found dead with a shotgun blast to his head underneath 
Interstate 5, near where a band had performed earlier.	Gustavo was 
taken to UCSD Medical Center, where he died several hours later.
  Both mothers said they were shocked and baffled by the killings.  They 
said they were told by police and friends that the gunman fired at their 
sons by mistake, and they denied that their sons had any connection to 
gangs.
  "We were told this guy went over there and started shooting like a 
madman," said Gustavo's mother, Patricia.
  Rave parties, a '90s phenomenon, feature live or recorded music 
popular with teen-agers, such as hyperfast techno or hip-hop styles.  
They are often publicized through pamphlets or by word of mouth and have 
an admission of $10 per person or less.
  They are publicized with leaflets listing a phone number that can be 
called that evening for the location, which is usually in a remote 
outdoor area or an abandoned building.
  But the so-called rave parties also are known for the availability of 
alcoholic beverages and illegal mood-altering drugs such as MDMA, 
methylene dioxyamphetamie, also called Ecstasy, or "X."
  Maldonado's mother said she had long suspected that alcohol and drugs 
were available at these events.

See Mourn on Page B-4

2 teen-agers are slain at Old Town 'rave' party

  "These parties go on in the middle of the street, with all the wrong 
crowd," she said.
  "You should tell whoever is organizing them that they're taking 
advantage of our kids and hurting innocent people," said Villarino's 
mother, Rosa, who lives a few blocks from Maldonado.
  Police Lt. Jim Collins declined comment on statements by the victim's 
families that the gunman hit the wrong targets.  He said the fatal shots 
were fired deliberately at each youth, just seconds apart.
  But he said the two homicides are the first to occur at a local rave 
party, which are not known for violence.
  "These are new to me," he said.  "One thing we will be checking on is 
what information our department has on rave parties."
  Collins said illegal drugs are sometimes available at such parties, 
but rave events are not usually associated with gang activity.
  "To my knowledge, rave parties are usually in a more isolated area, 
often a vacant warehouse," he said.  "I hope this (incident) lets kids 
know these parties are not a good place to be."
  Officers questioned those at the scene but said that only 10 saw or 
knew anything about the slayings and that they offered contradicting 
theories about the gunman's motive.
  Maldonado said her son was a loving, caring person who enjoyed camping 
and had a lot of friends.  But then he started in with a bad crowd, 
"just went in a different direction, like he was going through a stage 
where he was harder to get along with," she said.  "Everything was so 
out of control with these teen-agers today.  They do everything so hush 
hush and don't talk about anything."
  She said her son had admitted using drugs in the past, mainly smoking 
marijuana.
  "He said he didn't do it regularly, that it wasn't what he wanted to 
do with his life," she said.  "He wanted to be a civil engineer when he 
grew up."
  Maldonado said that her son had stopped going to the parties in recent 
weeks and that he spend Friday afternoon weeding and raking the front 
garden and cleaning up the yard.
  "He didn't deserve to die," said Maldonado's girlfriend, Tonya 
Marquez, 15, She said she thought he was going out with another friend 
that night because she had plans to go to the movies.
  Villarino's mother said Jorge wanted very badly to be a party disc 
jockey.  She said he practiced his banter as he washed the dishes, 
cleaned the house and threw out the trash Friday afternoon before he 
went out.
  "It isn't fair," she said, in tears.  "Suddenly to lose your son for 
nothing."

Hello everyone!

This message is along similar lines as several recent postings

My name is Amanda and two friends and I are picking up and moving
from the east bay to Europe (we're not sure exactly where,yet).

We will be leaving around the 1st of September and would like to find
a place in the scene in London and Paris....

I am writing in the hopes that there are some sfravers transplanted
to Europe and have developed roots there--or if anyone knows another
board that would give us some information.

This is the biggest move of our lives and it would be incredible to
feel welcomed in these strange new places:)


Thanks for everything and I'll miss S.F. "hella-much"!!!

I got to the site (the playground of a private elementary school) around
6:00 pm.  There were about 100 people there, sort of hanging out.  A
nice sound system was set up and a DJ was spinning some deep diva house.

About 10 people were dancing and the rest just hung out enjoying the
afternoon.  As time went on more people arrived, I guess there were between 
150 and 200 overall.  A bit before 8:00 Bryce was asked to start an
ambient set that would back up Frazier Clarke's talk.  So, the dance
beats stopped, the more mellow stuff started.  I sat down to listen
but was not watching who was speaking.  Andrew, the head of the people
in Santa Cruz who put on the party, made a little speech and a little
introduction.  Then things got REALLY weird.

Frazier Clark was supposed to speak, but Zippy Pinkus (the one who
wears body armor and carries a staff at all times) upsurped the microphone.
Now, I wasn't watching so I thought it was Frazier Clark speaking all 
the time, and many people who don't know Frazier Clark from John Doe
were probably confused too.  Anyway, Pinkus started talking some really
bizzarre wacked out stuff, he was saying "By definition, this party
is hijacked.  By definition, I am Frazier Clark, I have lied to people 
throughout this tour and promised them things that I have had no intention 
of delivering, I have promised money and then when asked to pay have not 
paid . . .  " it went on like this for a minute or two, and then the voice 
(Pinkus) was saying things like "this being, Frazier Clark by definition, 
declares himself no longer a voice of the Zippy Pronoia Tour to US."  The 
last bit of major confusion was when the voice (Pinkus) said "and now we 
must vector to the dance floor and dance" and at that point Planet-6 started 
playing some hard acid techno.  So some people jumped up and started dancing.

The music went on for a minute or two.  The music stopped.  Some people 
started screaming "what are we really here for?  To listen to some old guy 
go on and on with his tired rap?  Let's dance."  The music started.  The 
music stopped.  I got scared of the whole thing and sat on a blanket on the 
edge of the playground to watch this all play out.

The music continued while some people remained in the area where 
Frazier Clark/whoever were speaking.

After a while things calmed down.  Drew from Santa Cruz played a very
bouncey house set that got people relaxing and dancing again.  Then
Ethan from San Francisco started a wonderful trance techno set.  (Ethan,
I danced so hard that I pulled the muscles in my calves, and I still hurt!)
Shortly thereafter (around 10:00 pm) 5 policemen arrived to close down
the party due to multiple noise complaints.

Word was spread (through Pinkus) that we were to move to a location
in the fields north of Santa Cruz.  The music would start up back there
around 1 am.  Supposedly somewhere in all this the Santa Cruz people
who had planned, set up, and paid for the entire party (one of the 
Santa Cruz organizers told me the Zippies didn't even arrive until
after the party had started) threw up their hands and said they had no
idea what was going on and didn't know if they felt like going any further
with the evening.  So, I had serious doubts about any sound ever arriving,
but Brian, Jeannie, Jules, and I went to the new site.  We waited until 
3:00 am and drove back to San Francisco because no one from the Zippies or 
from the Santa Cruz planning group or with a sound system arrived and the
mood was getting ugly.  Some local high school kids got in a fight and
were trying to beat each other up.

I had doubts about this all along, and these doubts were magnified on
last Monday night when 4 of the roughly dozen Zippies who are currently
in the US came over to Brian's and my apartment to talk with him about
using hypereal to put up pictures, articles, and digitized video.  
Throughout their time here I had no idea as to what their mission or
message was or if they really even had one.  Pinkus even suggested that
they print up 50,000 flyers advertising a party at Alcatraz and then just
not have it.  Someone talked a bit about manipulating the media and
getting on the cover of something like Newsweek.  Their seeming American
voice, John (Cubensis) went on about how he went to some little rave in 
Iowa or something and how bad it was because the kids were drinking beer
and how the Zippies have to show people how it really should be done (at
which point I asked "What right do you think you have to tell people how
to go about having fun.?")  [Not that I'm into lotsabeer + rave, but if
that is what the local people like then who am I to tell them what to do?
As M. pointed out, the important thing was that these kids actually had
the idea and gumption to throw a party.]

But anyway, I figured they'd been travelling a lot and were probably stressed 
out, and when I saw them twice subsequently they were industriously scanning 
material and uploading it to the net.  So I figured what the hell, going to 
Santa Cruz would be fun and maybe then I'd get to see what they were really
all about.

I really don't know what the whole story is, or even if there is one.

There were two shootings.  Two 15 year old boys were killed.  One
died at the scene, one died at the UCSD hospital a few hours later.
The suspect was arrested at the scene with a loaded shotgun and all
the ravers were detained until morning for questioning.

Apparantly a dealer was held up at gunpoint for his supply of 
E and acid.  Being quite distraught (and possibly on speed) he went
out to his truck and loaded his shotgun.  He then shot two innocent
bystanders (had no connection with the robbery); the robbers had
already fled...

Newspaper articles are basically blaming the rave scene...

Regarding the weirdness with the Zippies, the "false" Frazier Clark speech
(really Zippy Pinkus), and Frazier Clark... a friend of mine has it from
Andrew, head of the Santa Cruz folks throwing the party, and who introduced
the Zippies... that what basically happened is that the Zippies self
destructed at that event.  Zippy Pinkus had joined them somewhat recently
in their tour, and somehow been turned into treasurer for the group within
a short period of time.  Apparently he decided to break from the Zippies,
but since he was in control of their money, no one knew what would happen
next.

As anyone knows who bothered to listen to him, the *real* Frazier Clark was
almost incoherent when he finally was able to speak.  The same source says
that normally he's much more coherent, but that he was very upset by these
unfolding events at the party.

hi folx,
here's what happened with m and i at the zippy thing.
after some tribulations - the directions to the party were bad; appearently
epic people in sc lost an earlier, better site so they had to improvise
the mountain hi thing - we get there around 8 pm. saw  andrew from epic
productions who was putting on the party and he told us to talk with
randy who was doing the ambient thing at the time. andrew told us
that itwas not cleara if there was going  to be an afterparty. anyway,
m and i wanted at  least an hour to do the spoken word ambient set.
now randy started this sob story how he took many hours to set up his
set and that he usually  does six hour sets (!) anyway, he had been playin
for about an hour -this was around 9 pm - so we said, ok, why don't
you play for two hours , till 10 pm, and m and i do the last hour.
well, randy said that he could 'give' us 15-30 minutes ! that seemed
really selfish to us. plus, there was no way we could do our performance
for just 30 minutes. so  we ended up NOT doing it. so sorry to the folx
who came to hear the quantum physics/spirituality thing ; we could not
make it happen. hopefully we will do it at friends &family iii.
i have to say that the vibe at this time seemed really weird, as laura
said. couldn't really put my finger on it, but it just seemd really 'me me me'
and non-cooperative. i had a difficulty getting into the party after this,
and just talked with laura and bryce and brian for a bit. since
andrew told me that he was NOT continuing, i decided to skip the possible
afterparty, &  i just stayed  in sc for the night and
spent sunday hanging around sc.
take care/shalom

WeakEnd rave report
===================

Well,   I have to admit it was a really strange weekend for us.   
First off,   I never got the word about the Full Moon event until way
after 5 am,   and by that time,  I had already nestled in for the evening
and didn't want to trek out to Contra Costa.    

A few things...  I think we might want to try and organize our phone
tree a bit better.    Almost always,   I start getting lots of phone calls
"Where the FMR tonight",   but most cases,   I'm just as "In the dark"
as most of those that call.     Is there one anymore?    I suspect so,
because I eventually got called,   and after that,   I put the info
number on my "Outgoing message machine" for those that still tried to
phone me,  so they can get the info.

I also don't mind being an "Information node" or using my 800 number
as an information nexus,   but sure can use some help in paying for the
800 number use (Which really don't cost that much).   Nuff complaints,
if you even call them that...   Lets get on the real gest....

The Santa Cuz Pronoia thingie was really strange,  as we all probably
know from all those reports that have already come through the SFRaves
mailing list.    

Re: the Zippies,  apparently  sometime between Wyoming and California,
possibly earlier,  there was some sort of "Falling out" or dis-association
between Frazer and the main Zippy possee.    I don't really know that
much about it,   and want to stay neutral in this.    This fragmentation
apparently was evident in ths Santa Cruz bash.   And could have been better
organized between the music and talks.   For instance,  the school grounds 
were sufficiently large enough to have BOTH music and talking going on,
but the area set up for the talk was in much too close proximity to the
main dancing area.

There was also a nice chill area set down the hill a ways and just beyond
that spot,   would have been a much better place for Frazer to give his
talk to those that might want to listen to him.

Although I was rather "tweaked" at the time,  and my mood was into dancing,
I had thought that Pinkus's talk was sort of a crude introduction to Frazer
in a somewhat twisted humerous way.   But lets not forget that the UK is
over 7000 miles away,  and British humor can be somewhat different than
ours.   Nuff said...

When the music finally did go back on,   it was really GREAT,  and Ethan's
set literally put my mind into a wonderful blissful state that made me forget
all the other stuff that happened.    Naturally,  the PIGS had other thoughts
about this,   and the music regrettably stopped about an hour short of the
expected finished time.

There was a tad bit of confusion when the music finally stopped,   and a mad
scramble for the location to the alternate area sortof ended a good mind
trip.

Mike and myself stopped by a restaurant for some food and to wait for the sound
truck to get to the alternate site.     After about an hour later,   we started
heading out to the site.

Luckily,  I'm familiar with the geography of the coastal region and didn't
have much problem interpreting Pinkus's directions,   but again,  good planning
could have been implemented,   by getting the info out to more people.
At least the SC shariffs lit up the place and made it easier to locate
my friends and clear out.

As mike pointed out in his report,    I ran into a caravan of about 4 or 5 cars
ahead of me that suddenly made a left turn into a parking area along the coast,
so I pulled in because I thought this was the place.   At least I got to talk
to some others about the location.

So we all pull in,   talked a while,  and just as the ranger pulled in,   me and
Mike left the parking lot,  and headed back north.    We find Ano Nuevo park
and proceed exactly as told and sure enough,   about 50 folks had already arrived.

I was somewhat concerned that the location was a bit too close to the Elephant
seal population at Ano Nuevo,  but later learned it was nowhere near there.

Because we were just across the county line,   I often wondered if that Santa
Cruz pig would actually go to the effort to notify the San Mateo county officials
about the rave.    But we discovered that the site was really GREAT...   Lots of
trees,   but people were yelling and in general making a lot of noise and I
had second thoughts about the possibility of the pigs arriving.    They didn't,
at least not while I was there...

I park in an authorized area,  carefully checking to see of there were any
parking restrictions.    At that point,  I walk into the crove of trees to
find an ideal spot.    At that time,  people were arriving at the alternate
site in droves,   and as I walked around,   I saw some raudy types,  and
one approached me and asked "Are you ravers?".    I didn't say anything,
just smiled and walked along a small roadway leading out to a cow pasture.

Mike and I sat down and talked a while,  then Brian, Laura,  and their
Dutch friend Joules showed up and Laura told me about the spat back at the
school about the sound system.    I was tripping pretty hard at that time,
so just hung out,  visited old friends and didn't much care about whether
or not the sound system arrived.    A few tents were set up,  and it sorta
reminded me of the rainbow gathering.

I was no where near where that fight broke out,  and Aaron was crashed out in
my car,   but I enjoyed chatting with Mike about a bunch of things in general,
and schmoozed around.

Later on,  a few Monterey dudes handed me a flyer to a renigade party they
had planned near Monterey,  and I took down the directions.    Everyone
was crowding around me,  eagerly wanting to know the location.    I let the
"Food,  not bombs" crew take down the directions and info number,  and
slowly made my way back to the car.    Eventually,  I ran into the Rowdy
folks again,  and they said "Are you a raver?",   I then replied "Raver?
Whats a raver?",  a few people laughed,   and some other ravers I had met at
other parties approached me and said "Just ignore those guys!",   I then
motioned for them to come with me so I could give them the directions to
the other party without the raudy people nearby.     As I approached the
road,   I saw more people I recognized and told them about the Monterey party, 
and they all eagerly followed me back to the hiway.

I gave everyone the Monterey party info number,  and headed back to the
car.    Without waking Aaron,   I carefully head out to the hiway,  with Mike
following and head south.   I noticed a few other cars following me.

About 45 minutes later,   I find the turnoff,  and head out to the party site.
The party site was a huge field of grass and stickers,   and I just arrive
as the sound system arrived and after some confusion,  we jostled the cars
around and in about 15 minutes,   the generator,  and mixer was set up on
the back of a car,  the music began,   and I was in my natural element
once again.

It turns out that the place we were raving at was on Ft Ord property, and
I silently thanked the US Government for providing such a nice site and
condemmed the local Santa Cruz authorites for being so much against the
idea of having a good time dancing and schmoozing.

I don't know who was spinning at first,   but he played some excellent acid
Techno,  then followed by another person who was a lot more fragmented in
keeping up a beat,  but I was ready to chill anyway.    Eventually Deaks
went on the turntables.    I had met Deaks earlier,   at the earlier
site,   and got to hear him spin.

He played a mixture of trancey acid stuff,   lost the beat a few times,
but spun some pretty good stuff.

All in all,  the after party was pretty good,   I would say about 20 or
so people eventually made it there.    

As the sun was coming up,   I could see this very straight line of cirrus
clowds in a perfect straight line to the East,  which was very appropriate
for the name of the party "Cirrus".    I had a GREAT time,  talking with
the young folks there,  as they were glad to have me attend their party.

One dude walked up to me and said,   "Could I have my picture taken with
you?",   I said "Sure!" and we talked for a while.    It turns out that he
had heard of me being in the rave scene and was surprised to see me.

I said "I always like the smaller renigade raves!"....    All in all,
I had a great time,  dispite the strangeness....

A few things the Monterey dudes should have considered... They should have
tried to keep the party at the first location instead of monterey....
Instead they should have spread the word out that an effort was being
made to go and get the sound equipment.  I know it would have taken another
1 1/2 hours to get back from monterey,   but I would have stayed...

Eventually,  around 9 or 10 am,   everyone packed up,  and I headed back
to Santa Cruz with Leo,   and visited him and a few friends at the beach
before heading back to SF.   I eventually had Aaron drop me off at the EndUp
and hung out there (Haven't been there in over a month),  and re-established
contacts with that crowd,  and took a nice leasurly bus ride back to
Mill valley.

The bus ride was very enjoyable and I enjoyed watching the multitude of
wind surfers out in the bay,   was treated to a spectacular view of SF
and when the bus pulled into downtoen Mill Valley,  I had stepped out
into a completly different world that the one I left.   It was 20 degrees
warmer,  and an incredably pleasant change from the socked in fog in
the past few weeks.

So,  dispite the strangeness,  I would have to give it an overall
8 on a one to 10 scale.... Looking forward to Tribal Funk next weekend,
as I was assured it was to be an outside location....  See U all there
next weekend...

Peace
Cap'n Crunch

        Ambient suggestions in another vein.  If you're into Aphex Twin
_Selected Ambient Works II_,  you might also want to check out Zoviet
France  (I believe they've split and half of the group is now Horizon 222).
 I've got _Mohnomishe_, which bears a strinking resemblance to some tracks
on _Selected Ambient Works II_  (the other way around, more likely...). 
Also worth checking out (now this is stretching it a bit), are albums by
Halfler Trio.  His stuff tends to be a bit spotty, and on the industrial
noise side of things, but the some of the albums I have have some really
beautiful moments.

Fort Ord is a VERY BIG place,  I doubt if anyone could possibly nail down
the exact spot where it was held from any info I might have given...
But just in case,  I'll refrain from even giving this amount of information
again...

      Hello, i think a daytime party on the beautiful campus of UCSC is a 
fabulous idea... the quarry in the center of campus is a very large outdoor 
amphitheatre with great accoustics. It is surrounded by redwoods and is far 
from other campus buildings.  AND/or we could venture into the ever 
popular "elfland" which is the redwood mountains behind campus. Elfland 
has two meadows that are a fairly short walk from the adjacent parking 
lot.
	I think this would be a great way to express some summer-love 
energy...so if anyone is interested in organizing please mail me.

Just a reminder that Kinetic is happening tomorrow (Tue.) at 1190 Folsom.
It's free, but I am going to ask for a $1 donation if possible as the owner
of the space wasn't quite as generous as I'd hoped. Also, it's going to be
21 and over. I apologize for that and will try to find 18+ or all ages
spaces for future parties.

        This was a very long weekend.  It started on Friday with a very
good small renegade that I threw together in about half an hour to an hour.
I was very happy to finally throw a party I've been trting for a year now.
Deaks and Tim spun and played us some wicked music!  We went from about
12:30 till 4:30 and then went to a friends house. The best was whe npoeple
fromk Santa Barbara showed up with notice from sfraves!!!  Thanks for
coming guys you made our day brighter!  So this is an up.

        I go to work after five hours sleep and then at midnight saturday
leave for the zippy/pronoia/vivid thing.  We head north to the site and I
meet friends as we arrive.  I'm in a good mood as I raved here a couple of
weeks ago.  The mention of guns and the rumor of a stabbing get me a little
nervous.  Someone driving a car too fast and near people said, "you don't
think I'll fucking run you over..." as I get closer to leaving.  Apparently
a lot of sketchy dealings were going on and there were some very rude
people there.  Quikly I organized my friends into a mobile unit and we
headed down to Monterey for renegade number two.  As I was leaving (after
giving Crunch directions :)) I saw someone violently smashing the
windshield of a car and my friend Clint stopped near the car and the
'smasher' was apcing back and forth in the way of exiting cars and then ran
headbutted thecar and then my friend quickly left as fast as possible.
Down.

        We got to my house about four and then got to the site a few
minutes later.  Sound up and running by four thirty with about fifty people
I was very pleased to have turned the evening around in a positive way.
The CAp'n was in attendance to deem our first official rave!  Thanks to the
Food Not Bombs people for the OJ and bagels!! Everyone was positve and I
was glad to have everyone come down to Monterey.  Crunch asked me what the
Monterey scene was like well that was it!  He asks if there are many
renegades answer as far as I know this was the second, the first was the
night before! :)  We ended at about 8:00 as friend with speakers needed to
go get sleep.  Thanks to K-go and Deaks for spinning both spun great sets.
Up.

Two guys were there from Richmond Virginia my friend Clint let them hang at
his house later into the day.  Unfortunately they stole his wallet from his
house and used his credit cards to get cash after they left.  They might
still be in the area so be wary.   They drive a black Suzuki Samurai and
told us their names were Ian and Graham.  They are average size both with
black hair and wearing biking shirts.  If you find them tell them they need
to work on their manners and respect, but I have faith their karma will
catch up with them.  Down.

Hopefully next weekend.  Up

        My friend was ripped off by two guys from Virginia.  They said they
were Ian and Graham and that they were from Virginia.  They were invited to
spend some chill time at my friends house after a party we threw this
saturday and procedded to steal his wallet and credit cards.  They took out
over a hundred dollars in cash advances.  The said they were going to Big
Sur and then maybe to Boulder, CO.  If you see them be careful I don't
think they are dangerous just not very repectful.  If someone could please
forward this to other lists I'd be appreciative, esp. mountain raves for
the colorado area  I don't know the addresses they also mentioned New York
as a destination.  It's hard to be trusting when this happens but just keep
the faith and thevibe...and give these guys a swift kick in the pants.

Not really wanting to drive all the way to SC and not having any reliable
directions, I went to the after party for Mind, Body, and Soul at the good
'ol 24th&Illinois spot.  No real vibe, nitrous, raucous people, and hours?
waiting for the DJs to get cartridges which they had forgotten!!! Of course
many balloons were filled during this wait. A pretty good set from Ghost and
an even better set by who ever was on after him(Spinner?) - he could have
been spinning from my own record collection.  I went with a bunch of friends,
so it was still fun. Weird though.

The trouble makers were local Santa Cruz gang members. We were standing
around
watching the guy with the giant bubbles when I noticed some activity going on
by my car. I walked up to see what was going on and 2 guys had a very young
girl pinned down on the hood of my car. They had a knife to her side and were
going through her pockets. They told me to "step off" and that they were
"doing a rip-off".
I decided to watch from a safer distance when several other of their friends
srounded the people I was with before they could get away and tryed to pick a
fight 
with them. One of them pushed my friend down and my other friend grabbed him
and threw him down so they could try to get away. The guy got back up and
pulled out
a knife and stabbed my friend in the face and hand while about 8 others
kicked
him while he was down on the ground. We got my friend in someone's car who
tok him
to the hospital and waited for the gansters to move away from my car so we
could leave.
It seemed that the gangsters (there were about 15 of them) were going up to
people and asking them either if they had any drugs for sale or if they
wanted
to buy any and then riping them off.
After we left some other friends of mine were parked in the lot closest to
hwy 1
sitting in their car when one of the gansters walked up and punched the
driver in the face and grabbed my friend's backpack. He then jumped up on the
hood and started to smash in the windshield. 

I just moved to Santa Cruz last week and we wanted to do outdoor parties here
but
the whole incident really turned me off. It's really too bad that instead of
worring
about getting busted by the cops we now have to worry about our safety. In
all my years in the house/rave scene in San Francisco I've never seen
anything like what happened last weekend. 

I'm too upset from the whole thing to say anymore......

	After reading some of the messages here expressing disappointment
with the vivid event, I'd like to let everybody know that some of the Zippies
did have at least a few good times in SC.  I was fortunate enough to spend
some of those times with them, and miss vivid and especially the "afterparty"
debacle.

	One thing I havent seen mentioned here is that the pronoia tour seems
to be made up of three or four groups.  This is my own observation -- please
forgive me if I've misunderstood.  Anyway, I saw the following:

	- the band, Universal Sound, and their friends
	- Pinkus (Pingus?) and Angus, who met up with Universal in NYC
	- various people helping with driving/logistics
	- Frazier Clark

	I got involved because my friend Craig set up some studio time
for Universal friday night.  They arrived around midnight, with Pinkus and
Angus but without Clark (whom I never did meet).  We went to the studio,
and spent a very enjoyable 6-8 hours partying and recording music, while the
drivers slept.  It was one of the band-members' (Dan's) birthday, which added
to the festivities.

	The Zippy caravan left my house (where I was entertaining part
of the party while others tore down the equipment) around 8am, and
I didn't get to sleep till after noon.  That, and other obligations by
Craig (who was going to provide video for the after party) caused us to
get to the vivid venue as the last of the people were being dispersed.
Apparently earlier plans for a more suitable (closer) location for the
after party had fallen through, and the eucalyptus grove sounded too
far away and not particularly real/likely, so we went home to see what had
happened.

	At this point we found out that things had gone a bit awry, and
that the after-party probably wouldnt have power for the projector.  Also,
the band wanted to mix the stuff they'd recorded and make some copies.
So, we all went back to the studio, where many people slept and the rest
of us listened to music...  another nice morning.

	I watched the Wharf-to-Wharf afterwards and slept, and the last
I heard Universal and Pinkus and Angus had left for San Diego, but Frazier
Clark was still in Felton -- and thinking about staying.  I just hope the
recent murders in SD don't bring things down too much there... we'll see.

	As an aside, I think there were two things, outside Epic's control,
which may have contributed to the dis-harmony:

	- a spot in a column in the Wednesday Sentinel (local SC paper),
mentioning the Zippies' planning a "massive two day party" in SC, and giving
a number for the location.  Not the kind of publicity the cops like to see...

	- a huge gathering of Seventh Day Adventist camp people -- some kind
of national convention -- just down the street from the party.  Many people
probably saw the security at the crosswalk, with flares etc.  So the cops
were already nearby...

Andrew

PS If anyone's interested in Universal, let me know and I'll try and get
	your message to them.  Angus is interested in selling tapes, but
	I don't know what his distribution plans are.  Its sort of a
	trance-dance blend...  maybe I can put some up on the net...

There might be more than we realize.  As a fairly new member (and lurker),
I don't know how well known/mainstream this list is  (my impression was not
very).  I was pretty surprised to open this past Sunday's  Living section
of the Mercury News and be able to read about the list and its recent
threads (including MDMA), how to subscribe, etc.  Did anyone else see this?
What's your opinion?

   If anyone south of San Luis Obispo is going to Anthem of the 
Sun on the 30th and is able to give a fellow raver a ride up to SF and back,
please let me know.  I will pay for part of gas.  I haven't been up
to SF since April, so such a favor will be greatly appreciated.

Hi- sorry to hear about what happened to you and your friends. Something very

simular happened to me in October of this year at a party near Candlestick. 
About four gang members asked my friend for drugs and then they just attacked

him. They had him on the ground and were just kicking away at him. Nobody was

doing anything but just watching. I couldn't take it so I tried to stop them 
at first I got in between them and then they starting hitting me so I fought 
back. My friend got away at this point and two of the guys went after him. 

These people fought like pigs they would scratch and come at me two at a 
time. I tried to run from them and instead run into to more of them. This 
time around about six of them. They all attacked me one had a board and beat 
me over the head and back with it. I had my ear slashed with a knife and a 
gun placed to my head. Eventually one of the guys held me up and said he was 
going to kill me but then he said he didn't want to go down for that. He told

me that I should say I am sorry for what I did. I couldn't really see 
anything at this point cause there was so much blood in my eyes and I was 
pretty close to buying it. So I said sure I'm sorry I even left my house this

evening and he dropped my on the ground head first and they left. 

Five people ended up in the hospital that night one was a girl who they put 
in a concussion. When they were attacking me they were also getting other 
people too, it was almost like they had this planned in a weird way. 

Anyways I know how you must feel-and it's fucked that there is people like 
this in the world. I wish that there is something that can be done to keep 
them away from the house scene but in the last couple of years we seem to be 
on a collision course with them. I hope you and your friends still go out 
and can put this behind you. I have and am having a good time again on the 
dance floor with my friends. Although some of the trust and over all free 
feeling has been left behind.

Take Care

 hello susan, the reason that i am
suggesting ucsc is because thaere was a recent post about the difficulty
of throwing parties around santa cruz.... but what do i need to prove? i
think sfsu sounds good, however i only have spinning capability..i.e. no
sound system. I am currently looking for a system , if you (or any
sfraver) could gather one i would be delighted to help put the party
together in whatever way possible. sounds phun! jason d. 
p.s. what do you mean by " much closer"...to what?

I am on three mailing lists and pretty much today all the stuff was sad.

Human Powered Vehicles List:
	Cyclists are talking about carrying handguns to protect themselvs
	from angry motorists.

So-cal Raves List:
	Two teens have been shot and killed at the moonlight massive.

SFRaves list:
	Gang violence at a pseudo-zippy gathering.

After washing the dishes and taking out the trash I thought about posting som
something about how bad news goes hand in hand with good news and my whole
yin yang theory but I doubt it will fix things. 
What I do want to say is that I'm glad people have access to this kind of
information.  Thanks for sharing all of it and just keep doing it.

Well now that I don't believe what I just wrote, I'll be at Final Motion
wednesday night and definitely with my earplugs and energy.

Just a brief note to all and sundry:

i am posting this message because i have received a few messages, and
read a post or two on SFR wondering where a sound system might be
obtained.

if you didn't know, i own a smallish sound system that is available
for parties.  i usually work with it for free or cost.  it has formerly
been known as MetroVision, after the other  sound system that i work 
with, Sound Vision, and because it fits in my Geo Metro.  however, 
after talking with a lot of folks who were less familiar with it's 
history and parentage, they have usually referred to it as "the 
Liquid sound system."  i can tell a good thing when i hear it (jingle 
hound that i am), so i've decided we should formally name it the 
Liquid sound system.

if you or someone you know would like me to bring Liquid to a party, 
please feel free to contact me at the address below, or phone 415.642.9791.
if you'd like to see it, talk with me in person, or hear it in real time, 
please call my voice mail for it's next workout: 415.985.5244.

I am interested in taking a survey of what people's favorite dj's are in 
the Bay Area.  They do not have to be from the Bay Area, but I would 
prefer them to be someone who at least plays around here once in a 
while.  If you are interested in taking part in this ANONYMOUS survey, 
this is what you need to do.  

1) email me, deepfog@cats.ucsc.edu.  DO NOT POST IT TO SFRAVES!

2) in your subject header, please write "DJ Survey Response"

3) please post your response no later than Sunday, July 31.  

4) only one response per person, please.

i think this will be fun for everyone, and i hope you all take the time 
to take part in this survey.  if I get a good enough response, I will run 
more surveys (complete with percentages! :) )

thanks!

I went to Kinetic at 1190 Folsom last night.

It was a buck - the front bar was doing its own offbeat jazz
Tuesday night lounge deal (quite pleasant).  The back room was 
dancing that stayed reasonably active during the evening.

The sound was good (got a little loud later).  The music was 
coherent and well mixed.   Of what I heard, I thought that 
the beginning of Monty's set was the strongest.  I am a bit
clueless when it comes to techno - but this stuff has a funkier
fusion feel.  You can certainly get down to a non-outerspace 
vibe.

There were a few aggressive young men trying to boogie their way
into people's lives.  This wasn't any real problem - mostly amusing.
They were the exception to a nice crowd.   I met several friendly
people.

I would think SF techno fans could get really into this
place as a weekly.

My injuries were basically just scratches and pulled hair, but the experience
stayed with me for a long time.  Until it happens to you, I'd say one doesn't

I'm getting really sick of thugs.  Went to the vivid pronoia party with 
the rest of the MESS crew and had a (mostly) great time.  Liberated a US 
flag from a gas station to make the "United States of Free Love" banner,
 and missed the conflict between Mr. Road Warrior and whatever...Gave 
Frazier back copies of the Mess zine and met Steven, who traded 
his zine for ours and showed us wonderful hospitality 
at his place while waiting for the second half of the party (thanks for 
the vitamins and spiritualina).
So as we arive at the renegade site, I'm feeling particularly 
(naturally) high and open and friendly.  I see lots of familiar bodies 
from the Mt. School, so I don't pay enough attention to my intuition when 
this thug steps to us offering treats. End result: a lesson in applied 
socialism with a blunt object and now I'm missing parts of two teeth and 
my wallet.
I spent a night in SF General hospital last fall waiting to see if my 
sister would survive the beating she recieved from several locals who 
showed up at the party we threw at Candlestick park. ( not to metion the 
other four people who suffered the same fate.)  In the hospital a cop 
tried to blame me (and the rave scene) for what happened.  Our discusion 
proved less than productive.  Two weekends ago a cop who broke up a house 
party we threw in our coop told me he would charge me with felony 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor so that i would "go to prison 
and get buttfucked" (btw- I like anal sex, but homophobic remarks from 
cops make me rilly rilly rilly angry, like "bricks to the head" angry.)
I'm trying to be peace and love, but I fucking hate cops.  I want to get 
over it, but I feel trapped between two groups of thugs-one with a 
uniform.  I remember Jane's Addiction's song "1%" "the gang and the 
government are no different"
sorry for venting on you all
all in all, loosing my wallet was a liberating experience (no money, no 
id, no responsibility!) Sunset was, as always, amazing. We got to 
hear Spun play deep house.  Hooray for stoner disco. The east bay can 
finally claim a decent "scene," thanks to several wonderful groups.
  On top of this, I'm also falling deeply in love with a wonderful woman, 
which has nothing to do with raves except it's all about love...

heaps of peace to every being (especially thugs),
whitsitt

I'm writing a paper on ambient music for a "popular music and society" 
mass comm. seminar i'm taking at Cal.  Since y'all are the most 
knowledgeable folks on this subject, would anyone with an opinion please 
e-mail me with it.
I especially would like to hear from DJ's, musicians/performers, and 
ambient promotors, as well as "audience" types.
I'm kinda working an angle along the lines of "the evolution of dance 
culture;post-rave dance/club culture"
I'm leaving this intentionally vague(rather than putting up a bunch of 
leading questions), but basically I want to know: your involvement 
with ambient music.
 how do you use this music?
 what does it mean to you? 
 where does ambient fit into the house nation?

I've got my own experience to draw from, but since this is a research 
paper, I want to hear from you, too.
btw, please hurry, I've got a deadline to meet:)

love,
whitsitt

Tracy spun the 2-4am slot at a memphis rave. In memphis they just cant 
wait to rent you a wharehouse to rave in! 
this bad weekend on the coast :(  

 also...will   someone please post the dirt on the HAZE theatre COP RAID?
is it closed for ever?

I've got a new house record with the Jim Baker Jessica Hahn thing as the 
theme. Can I get a witness?

Santa Cruz: went to school there and lived there- very liberal and 
criminal simultaniously, There is a backlash by local kids against hippie 
tofu eatin' pacifism, and of course they have always preyed upon "valleys"
who may or may not be from the vallyvalley.

Not that this kind of unoriginal macho behavior doesn't exist everywhere,
Santa Cruz does have a high murder rate in spite of its groovy reputation.
My experience is That parties in S.C. should be at houses in the hills Deep 
and Small.......salutations, allen@ameba

I'm gonna be there, so if you make it and see someone who looks a little 
familiar, say hi-it's me!  The zippies won't be there though, that's what 
one of 'em told me.  I'll probably report back on the event (although 
I'll admit that I have become biased against large, commercial raves).

I must say, I just got a copy of the flyer for Summer of Love and it is
TOTAL CHEEZE, but the word from those who went last year was that it
was a great event.  I'm tempted to go, but the fact of the matter is
there's a competing event in Portland the same day featuring Simon,
DJ Dan and our wonderful (and amazing) friend Carlos.  Realistically,
I've got a major political campaign to work on and a bunch of other
work, so I won't feel so bad about staying at home again this year,
as a result :-)

Hi, ravers!

As you may recall, myself and at least a few others from the SFR crew are
taking Liquid, ourselves, and whatnot to this year's Burning Man in Nevada.
I would like to produce a 'zine to handout at the event, called "Flaming
Dud[e][tte]" (PC, and a multiple read and entendre all wrapped into one,
as well as a joke...phew!).  This zine, hereafter referred to as Flaming,
will include at least who SFR is, how to get in touch with the regional
lists, access informatin for the more well known service providers, what
the house "movement" is about (as we understand it) and the like.

If you'd like to write something up (anything!) for inclusion, please
send it to me at the address below.  I need to get things together fairly
quickly so i can gather up everything, get it laid out, copied, etc. 
Therefore, the submission deadline is Saturday, August 20th, at midnight.
We won't have very much space available...i'd like to save trees and my
sanity by copying it on a single sheet of two-sided paper, folded.  So,
space is limited, and my judgement of what to include is, alas, final.
I will consider *any* material for inclusion, though it would be nice if
the material could be copied onto paper.  If you'd like to give us something
to take along to the Burning Man, we'll do that, too.

thanks muchly!  i'll be putting up the file somewhere on the net for your
perusal once i get it all done, as well as copying off a few extra hardcopies
to hand out around town after we come back.

Heh. Sooner or later the cops will clue in to the Haze goons' practice
of confiscating drugs...and keeping them. What goes around comes
around.

  I don't know if you are talking about our, cloud factory, plans or 
someone elses... But... We are working on it! :)  

  We have two group camp sites reserved for Saturday September 17th...  
Idealy we would like to have two sound systems (one ambient) and a few 
live groups.. Hopefuly we can convince Dub Tribe and The Orb to come.. 
OK, well one out of two wouldnt be bad..

  Personally, I am hoping that the beauty of the site, and the fact 
that the weather is great that time of year will be enough to convince
Alex P. and company to cruise on by.. :>

  We still have some kinks to work out.. Such as a sound permit.. And we 
don't know exactly how many people the site(s) can handle.. It's looking 
like a maximum of about 200.. But I wouldn't complain if 2000 people 
showed up to see the Orb do their only west coast performance of 94 ;)

  Anyways, we are still looking for some DJ's, so if anyone wants to spin 
ambient or trance or house... Drop us a line (or just me..)

  Peace out..

-Ernie

hello, i was thinking about the rave scene at last weeks 
sunset...like...what is different  etc. there is a theme of sf's scene 
this summer, but i have not pinpointed what i think it is. well i was 
thinkin of what it is like and what is popular and whatever so here...

	IN				OUT
***************************************************************
dj's spinning for free			dj's getting paid
dj's spinning at free parties		dj's spinning at smoky indoors
berkeley marina				bonny doon
violence				safety
goons as doorpeople			fabulous drag queens as doorpeople
marijuana				nitrous
water					beer

well those are all of things that i can think of. the theme of my 
personal summer is either "the summer of love" and/or "the best time of 
my life". 

My love goes out to everyone    (even the thugs at vivid/pronia)

Here's the relevant part of the Mercury-News article.  Someone
at my work actually saw my name in it and brought it in...


San Jose Mercury News, Saturday, July 23, 1994.

David Plotnikoff, "Modem Driver", excerpted from 
"It's a beautiful day in the cyberhood"

[intro about travelling and big city life and lack of meaningful
interaction with people] 

...I think of the home-brew bulletin-board
services and the small Internet mail-groups out on the edge of the
electronic wilderness as the places where real communities are being
built.

Forget video-on-demand and real-time stock quotes -- there's your real
"killer application."  I believe that small on-line neighborhoods will
be what finally sells cyberspace to a mass audience.  They offer the
things that are so sorely missing from real, streets-and-sidewalks
neighborhoods today: a sense of belonging.  A shared set of values.
Knowledge that -- for better or for worse -- we all have a stake in a
larger whole.  And someone to help with a barn-raising or a ride to
the dance.  Above all, small virtual settelements afford us a chance
to know each other as whole, multi-dimentsional people.  There are
thousands of small trives out there beyond the big mainstream services
and networds.  Here are two local Internet e-mail groups that
exemplify all that is good about small-town life.

To my ears, the musical terms "techno" and "house" are synonymous
with headache-in-a-can synthesized dance music.  Yet with that said,
I've had a tremendously enriching six months lurking on the SF RAVES
mail group.  The rave scene is still largely an underground phenomena
(sic).  This high-volume mail group (it regularly carries more than 25
messages a day) has been my window into the subculture.  On one hand,
it's very chatty and clubby - wiith a heavy dose of provincial
attitude, insider gossip and petty bickering.  Conversley, it can also
be very global in outlook.  These mostly college-age party-hounds are
the Beats of their generation - spontaneous, hedonistic and more loyal
to each other than they are to any cause.

The richest SF RAVES read lately was a long, hilariously detailed
travelogue on the Rainbow Family hippie convocation penned by the
legendary on-line wag John "Cap'n Crunch" Draper.  The list is also
the only place I've been able to find advance notice of the "Burning
Man" community-art project slated to go down in Nevada's Black Rock
Desert over Labor Day weekend.  (Yeppers - those zany kids really do
plan to torch a three-story human icon).

In between the gems you'll currently find long threads of discussion
about concert-related hearing loss, the drug Ecstasy and the recent
arrival of Zippies (nomadic British ravers) to the Bay Area.  There
are also semi-regular notices offering ride-pools to events, picnic
lunch gatherings in the park and the like.  Derek Chung's [that's me]
weekly rave guide, posted each Thursday, is dry-yet-essential reading.

The post-rave reviews, many of them quite poetic, are the real heart
of the community.  A recent dispatch from Will Penna, in which he
describes a group of ravers picking berries in the fog as dawn breaks
along a coastal ridge, is one of the sweetest pieces of writing I've
encountered on-line.  To svbscribe to the SF RAVES group, send e-mail
to majordomo@hyperreal.com with this in the body of the message:
svbscribe sfraves.

[goes on to describe the "nerdnosh" digest]

And one caveat, cybersurfer: If you visit these communities, please
respect the rules and conventions they've created.  I don't want to
see any reader of mine playing the gauche tourist in paradise.

I found this on alt.rave the other day, with the title "Fuck you ravers:
Full Moon Rave in the Cal delta."

Perhaps whoever talks to Wicked a lot should pass on this bit of
information . . . maybe that last site wasn't such a good one after
all.

Robert presented us with his list of in/out, which i think is cool, but
one problem with one of them...

> 
> 	IN				OUT
> ***************************************************************
> dj's spinning for free			dj's getting paid

now i realize we've all heard this point of view before...but really - i 
mean, i will never turn down a party because it isn't paying me to dj. in
fact, i almost NEVER get paid to dj - i do it because i love it and it's a lot
of fun and i like to share music with people. BUT...records are expensive and
not everyone is as fortunate as i am (both in getting free records and in 
having enough money to stay alive) and can really use some cash to help
out. a great preponderance of djs will spin for free if the party seems genuine
but to have the attitude that djs should not be paid imho isn't right.

To the person I sent the original message to about the Candlestick party. I 
sent that message to your address not the lists. I don't really care that you 
forwarded it- I think that's fine. But in the future when someone sends you 
something you might want to ask them before you post it..

Hay David- it broke my heart to see your sister in the hospital. I could not 
believe what they did to her. I did not see what happened to her because she 
was not around me when they were after me. I never really heard the whole 
story  I just heard that she was hit real hard by one of them. 

I hope that she has been able to put this whole thing behind her and can go 
out and enjoy your parties. I know how you feel about the cops too. They 
just stared at me that night as I was choking and they didn't even offer me 
any thing to drink I had to beg them for one. And at one point I just fell to 
the ground and they just left me there until the ambulance came.

Glad to hear that you have found LOVE- cherish it..
DA

Hi all,  James here... Andrew Morin from santa cruz is going to 
post through my account to respond about the vivid "pronoia" 
thing->

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: Andrew Morin of EPIC Productions in Santa Cruz, (408) 
423-7923.

The 4 PM to 10 PM Vivid/Pronoia was a pretty fantastic event 
though as you'll read below the "stars" had trouble ahead written on 
them. The school up Old San Jose road provided a beautiful site 
with redwood covered mountains in the backgorund and Soquel 
Creek in the canyon bottom. We had two sound systems, the fat one 
up by the school and the ambient by Dionysus Dreams down  in a 
field. As the day turned into night the crowd grw to about 500 
people who enjoyed spectacular visuals by Synergy, a great set spun 
by DJs Drew and Ethan, more visuals down in the field with 
projected images on the forests, a guy juggling florescent balls and 
flags, and a guy making huge bubbles in the lights. A huge falling 
star streaked across the sky and the moon began to rise on the event. 
Too bad we couldn't have gone longer as it was reaching epic...

It was very very sad what happened up the coast after our earlier 
event. In a major way, what putting on an event, of the sort that 
EPIC/Vivid did on Saturday, involves is creating a bascically 
anarchistic situation in which mostly anything can (and does) 
happen. Its not about creating a controlled and scripted event (like at 
rock concerts where people are assigned seats and told not to stand 
up). At a free event there is no security other than all of us working 
together to keep the negative energy at bay. Usually it works, often 
it doesn't.  I completely agree with what Whit from MESS said- that 
the cops are just thugs in uniforms. They killed our earlier event on 
Saturday just as it had reached critical mass- knowing that we were 
only going to go just one more hour (to eleven- by contract with the 
school).  They were extra-abrasive and rigid-  perfectly fulfilling 
every negative stereotype about police. 

There had been a bunch of confrontations at our day/evening event 
as the Dog Day of Sirus and the Full Moon played havoc with 
emotions. The zippies break between Fraser Clark and the 
Pincus/Angus group went public as Pincus pushed me aside as I 
was introducing Fraser and "hijacked" the event with such negativity 
that it had our DJ in tears. It was only DJ Drew's and Ethan's 
spinning that brought the event back together again for the final few 
hours. But the negativity had been unleashed... and the 
Pincus/Angus group were all over me about the fact they weren't 
going to be making any money from the now free event (at 
which they didn't participate at all except to try and sabatoge it.)  
Also, some of the Santa Cruz "Family" members also expressed 
their displeasure about the event, ie, the attempt to do something 
slightly different than simply have DJs spinning records.  After the 
cops broke up the event the zippies and the santa cruz "family" just 
got up and took off leaving only Drew, James, and myself to clean 
up and move the sound and generators. Three hours later wefinished 
cleaning up and had no way to transport the sound up the coast and 
back.   

The zippies are hype, and while Fraser Clark and the three Univeral 
Sound Band members are cool people, the rest of the group are 
useless groupies looking for a free tour of the US. With no real 
purpose except to ride the hype of the Wired Magazine article the 
group has been aimlessly wandering around the US hoping to hitch 
a ride on the back of existing rave communities. It hasn't been 
working very well. Fraser Clark is a true philosopher and 
visionary, and the three Universal Sound band members play some 
hot hard core euro-techno. But nothing has really come together and 
the tour is now in shambles. Now minus Clark, the group is 
scrounging for money to stay afloat. 

so thats the scoop... if anyone wants to respond- any questions, 
comments, concerns you can reply or call us at (408) 423.7923

peace and love to you all,

Andrew

Well I wonder if big brother bothered to read the San Jose Mercury News.
This ain't unda ground no more.  Ahh, above ground now.  Well the sun is 
shining and I can see the sun or the moon.  Oh and over there are those pesky
guys who like to wear blue uniforms (why?) and dislike the fact that other
people besides themselves are enjoying life.  Are we paying their salaries by
any remote chance?  Hey there's more people around
here.  Look they've come to learn about unity.  Isn't that exhilarating?  But
with more exposure comes greater responsibility and more risks.  Are we in
the Soviet Union of Amerikkka yet?  I see a few signs that seem to be similar,
but good, I'd prefer not have to look over my shoulder when I take a pee 
behind a tree.....

Anyways, I'm going to nap.  Have a fantastic fantasy dream reality every-one, 
if you're already there.  While you're at it how about looking at one day's 
worth of waking life as a dream reality.  Wait a second here..... Me remembers
going to sleep and in my dream I'm tapping on a keyboard while I nod off yet
again in that dream to find myself tapping on another keyboard in that dream.
Now am I dreaming or am I awake or am I awake but actually my life from birth
till death is within another short dream and I'm really just a dream segment
of a much larger, more all-encompassing creat-ure that is dreaming?

Playing the work game, the rent game, the green paper play-money game, the
survival game, the crew-member of spaceship Earth game, to name a few.......

Love and respect and tolerance and forgiveness and unity to ya ahlll,
Spanky

I've always thought that it would be great if the authorities *really read*
sfr; they'd be the first to realise how totally harmless we are :) 

That our only real threat (and this IMO is *the* most important aspect of
"what we are doing*) is in subverting the dominant paradigm by engaging in
peace, by engaging in positivity, by engaging in and bulding community is,
I think, well beyond the ken of the average officer. Too bad that their
lack of a conscious cognizance of this dynamic seems not to interfere with
their baseline dislike of people having fun.

Unfortunately and, as recently evidenced, the world is full of *real*
criminals. That, seen in this light, 'civilization' seems to require police
is the unforunate consequence of a culture weened and perpetually
malnourished on alcohol, violence and a total lack of paths leading towards
meaningful existence in the (lack of) community. 

"..protect me? who'll protect me from you, the likes of you, the nerve of
you..." 
             Gil Scott Heron (approximately +)

Funny to think that twenty years later the all too bitter irony is that the
revolution *will* be televised; this, however, will make little difference,
as the the very nature of the approaching involution will be nothing if not
the wholesale consumption of physical materialism by itself. Those that
stay behind to watch it will be, by then, so far gone as to find the next
level totally incomprehensible. Inside the mind, that's where it's goin... 

Now how's that for topic drift +)

ZIPPY NEWS FLASH
================

   Hi,   I just talked with Frazer Clark,   where he has sort of made me
a spokesperson in this area,   where he is planning to set up a permenent
office here in N.  California.   We are currently establishing our own
identity here in the Scene.    This includes myself,   Aaron Namaste,
and Radion Matrix TestData (Who has now come back to us,   after a long 
absence from the scene).

>From Frazer Clark...

    PHASE 1 OF THE ZIPPY INVASION IS NOW COMPLETE
    
   As planned,  I have now reached California where I have gone underground
with the Zippies here,  and with others joining me here from London,   including
Cap'n Crunch.

   We are working on the Grand Canyon Maga-rave (whose venue will be announced
this Monday) and also on opening a very large Megatripolis club in San Francisco 
in September.

   As with Megatripolus in London,  it will combine the best of Rave Culture,
Festival,  New Age,  Supertech,  and Internet-weaving etc.   Which will
facilitate the scene meeting itself.

PLEASE NOTE:

   The Pronoia tour was the hypodermic syringe to inject the new cultural virus
deep into Americas psychic body.

   This stage has now been completed and,  although the booster rocket continues
to orbit under its own momentum,  it is no longer connected IN ANY WAY to the
nroader Zipy invasion as it disperses deeper into the US Culture.

I REPEAT:  The Zippy Pronoia Tour to US is no longer connected to me (Frazer
Clark) IN ANY WAY AT ALL.

						Signed:
						Frazer Clark
						"Zippy Invasion HQ - California"

----- end ------

John D - There you have it from the horses mouth,   and we (John Draper,
Aaron Getting,  and Radion) will have more information as it comes together.

   Well everyone...  Last night has convinced me that the underground Rave
scene is flowering back into something of the likes I haven't seen since the
ToonTown days.

   I'm sure you all remember the Survival Research venue this last June,  where
they did theoir awsome show.    WELL,   this venue has yet again served a super
scene last night to an awsome rave where about 300 young folks danced to the
awsome tunes of Carlos,  Dutch and others in an incredably energetic and
wonderful vibe that exceeded all my expectations.

   Everyone there was on their best behavior,  and Carlos got on the Mic and
made an announcement that NO Alcoholic beverages were allowed.    I am happy
to report that I saw nobody indulging in said substances.    Instead,  everyone
had a killer time....  no police showed up,   and as I approaced the venue,
I was efficiently guided into the large dirt parking area,  where the cars
were neatly parked in an efficient manner.

   The party was FREE,  dispite the killer sound system that made for some
very heady spacey sounds when bopping around the dance area.

   I also want to remond folks that Tribal Funk is happening tonight (Friday)
and I will be there,  and encourage others to make plans to go,  either after
the last SPAZ party,   or both.    This venue is to be an outside venue,  on
private property,  and is reputed to be bust free,  and last well into the
morning.   Call (415) 905-4476 for venue location after leaving SPAZ or
sometime after about 8 - 9 pm.    See Ya all there...

Crunch
Namaste
Radion Test Data

I wish Frazer Clark well, but quite frankly, his note (kindly provided
through Crunch) is an admission of the hollowness of the whole Zippy
Pronoia affair.  In a scene saturated with hype, I'll give the Zippies
credit for rising above the fray to a new higher level of hype.  Coming
to the States and glomming on to local scenes all over and taking
advantage of the good intentions and hard work and positive vibes of
event organizers and attendees alike, without providing all that much
of substance in return, strikes me as more an exercise in ego than
a doorway to the transformational future.  I'm thankful that we're
nearly done with the self-congratulatory, self-referential phase of
this particular trip.  

Sorry to be so down on this, but I'm one who is always more impressed
with results than pronouncements.

All the same, we do need to hear from articulate, visionary folks who
can crystallize some of those feelings we all have, I think, about the
*need* for a transformational approach to life on this planet.  But
we hardly have a corner on that particular font of truth.  I just happen
to think non-commercial dance-oriented house-based music is one hell of
a great gateway to the future that I want, a reuniting of mind, body,
spirit with our earth, with each other.  I've heard some interesting
thoughts along those lines from Frazer Clark and I hope to hear more.

Who knows where this journey leads?  I'm not leaving my place in this
theatre until I see the final credits!

  Well, in some support for the Zippies (but not much), They brought some 
realy wicked DJ's over and all the guys in Universal Sound are cool too.  
But this whole "Wired Inspired" event is just terrible.  I realy have no 
clue as to what they are trying to accomplish, and whatever it is, they 
aren't having much success at it..

  Believe me, I am all for a cultural and psychological change, but I 
have the sneaking suspission that the zippies are making people help them 
and behind their backs aren't doing diddly squat.. (err.. ok.. whatever :)

  Frazer Clark has an intriguing writing style and the zippie propaganda 
and philosiphy is interesting.. But try reading something like "The 
Celestine Prophecy" by James Redfield.  He talks all about major changes 
in humankind in an interesting and down to earth way.  Not in a 
psychedelic, technological mind opening way...

  ::sigh:: 'Frankly, I don't give a damn..' but they have invaded our 
scene and left a not so sweet taste in our mouths (see: VIVID PRONOIA) 
and the idea of them staying here.. well.. I just dont know.. What are 
they going to do, get some people to work hard and open a club for them 
and run it for them?? 
 
  And finally, if there had never been the story in Wired (which I never 
read, but saw the cover..) would they even be here now??

 Peace out.. Keep the vibe strong!

Don't forget jugglers, tilt-a-whirls, gravitrons, and clowns.

Hey, it's Cool World!

John, here's a suggestion for Mr. Clark: Instead of bigger and better
mega this and mega that, why not just spend some time with us? Find
out what we love about the scene...why we pour our hearts into it. Go
to some small events.  Have him come to the next NMR. Not by storm,
though, but with humility.  Have him talk to some of those smiling
faces, and ask them what they like about the scene and what they don't
like. Ask them about their favorite parties and why. Ask them what
it's done for them, and why they think it happened.

Have him read the spirit files in the rave archives.

I think he's going to get a really empty feeling from all this unless
he gets in touch with the people and what's on their minds.

Sean

Maybe not, but some sense of forward motion is always good.

	This mail is from Ran at Dionysus Dreams...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Ran@ Dionysus Dreams
Subject: Vivid/Pronoia

These are some of my personal observations concerning Vivid/Pronoia.

First- My heart felt apologies and sympathies to those hurt at the
(so-called) after-party for Vivid/Pronoia.  I would be happy to meet
anyone who was hurt or sustained property damage in order to convey my
apologies personally.

Second- No one at Epic Productions or anyone with the Santa Cruz Family
ever informed about an after-party.  It was discussed earlier in the
week, but I never heard any concrete plans.  At the Mountain School
party, I was asked by several people as to the location of the
after-party, but replied that while there may be one, I did not know of
it.  During the party, someone (oh I wish I knew who) told me of the
eucalyptus grove scene, so I passed on the info thinking it reliable.  I
feel really awful that people were hurt at the grove and that I had even
so little to do with it.

Third- I've been hearing grumblings (still?!?) about how I handled the
ambient space I helped to bring about, with mother earths benevelonce,
as part of Dionysus Dreams's performance at Vivid/Pronoia.  Specifically
Ovid and his companion (m) are claiming that I would not let them perform
or made the situation for them so difficult that they would not want to
perform.  I would like to respond:

1- I never promised anyone anything, except Vivid- and that being that I
would provide the sound, lighting, technical personal for the ambient
space as well as a juggler, an ambient set from me and times for other
ambient performers to express themselves (using my equipment and the
energy time it took me to set up).

2- I was told by the promoters that I was ultimately in charge of the
scheduling for the ambient performers and given a tentative schedule to
work with.

3- On that schedule (which I still have) Onid was scheduled for a half
hour.

4- Back at Vivid/Pronoia I offered Ovid and m 15 to 30 minutes to
perform their material.  I offered to st up a very exspensive microphone
and the use of my CD players.

5- m raised her nose and huffed that only an hour was good enough and
Ovid quietly agreed.

6- It was 9pm, I had been playing for about a half hour, no help me set
my equipment (about 3 hours of work), and I wanted to play for a while
longer and establish a groove in that beautiful setting.  We were
scheduled to stop at 11pm.  As it was we were stopped at 10pm by the
police.  I'm happy with my decision since if I had given in to the
demands of Ovid and m I would have omly a half hour to show for about 6
hours of work (load in and load out) that I agreed to do for free.

7- Only those who own portable sound and lighting equipment, create
sculptures, hire talent for shows, and have a spiritual (for lack of a
better word) approach to their art can understand the work and Love I
put into that ambient space for others to enjoy.  If this attitude is
not good enough for others- tooooo bad!

I really appreciated the chance to create a chill space for everyone!!!!!
I can be reached @ (408)462-0849, look for my e-mail slot at Cabrillo
College (Dionysus Dreams).

Increase the peace,-Ran

Final Motion at F/X in San Jose was PACKED!
I don't just mean people
I'm talking fun.
Even when I could find a decent square foot to get in motion, (so many 
happy people) I could hardly keep up with the trance breaking into what 
very much reminded me of hardcore LA techno/rave all layered with 
jungle/tribal beats from the live drummers going off in the corner!
By the way, thanks Larry for showing me the "sweet spot" between all the 
drummers.  It was like a massage of the soul to be completely surrounded 
by "booonga-booonga" reverberations through the body, all the while 
surrounded by hundreds of people dancing like MAD!
Thanks to WIll Penna for introducing yourself to me.  You seemed right at 
home grooving with the jester's cap and a big smile!

I don't think many more people could have fit into that converted 
theater.  It reminded me very much of the last Wicked event, because the 
whole crowd would FEEL the energy coming from the DJ.  And when it was 
time to bring it up a notch, everyone would respond with whoops and 
cheers when they felt the surge.  It was fantastic.

The visuals were good as well.  Multi-layered slides mixed with film 
clips (what was that clip of the tin man from Oz in the desert?) At 
first, I didn't dig the smoke machine, but as I sat in the corner and 
looked across the sea of moving bodies during a trance-type set, I could 
see the effect someone was going for.. the light mist filled the room and 
gave it an ethereal feeling combined with the space-like sounds and 
suddenly I felt like we were all on a cloud... . .

					. . ..in the jungle.. . 
					(the booonga boooonga drummers)

		. . ..on a slight incline.
			(the movie theater)

I liked it.  Too bad that was the Final Motion.
I hope to see more vibe in San Jose..

if you can forward things to Ran, please forward this to him.

i was not there, but as someone who has been similar situations, it
sucks both ways.  a little planning, though, and a little
communication go a long way.  if anyone had informed Ovid or M of the
situation, that they could only expect to have 15 to 30 minutes, they
would have been able to make the decision one way or the other and
there wouldn't have been any hard feelings.

another comment on this is that there are dozens of people on this
list who have spent hours and hours preparing for parties where they
don't perform.  the party itself is the payoff, not the performance.

finally, the system is self adjusting.  if you make it clear to people
that you would rather spin than have others spin, that's fine and
people can deal with that.  if you make it clear that it's
collaborative, then you'll get people joining in.  it is totally fine
to say "i took six hours to set up so i want to spin the majority of
time" but this also means that it's unlikely that people are going to
leap to help you set up the next time.

the most important thing is to throw the events... but it does make
everyone a whole lot happier if they know what the deal is.

just a bit of blather,
Bob

I disagree.  What caused the mess last Saturday was lack of structure
itself - which is the darker side of the whole pronoia concept, i.e.
"having the sneaking suspician that others will take care of the details
and handle responsibility for you".  Andrew, from what I could tell you did 
everything you could to keep structure and form there, but when the event
was sabotaged the control was lost, and that's where the negative energy
comes from (I know Jump in the River will flame me on that one :)  HAD a
sound system shown up at the second location, even with gang members there
I don't think anyone would have been attacked or hurt.  I guess I just come
from the school of thought that chaos is a highly inefficient method of 
getting something done.

I don't blame you for not having been able to get a sound system to the
second site, though it would have been very nice to have sent someone up
there to let others know that it wasn't happening.

They're an embarrasment to the magazine, frankly.  I spent all last
weekend with the author of that article, Jules Marshall, as he's
come out here to follow them (as well as write some other stories).
He had never met Pincus or John Bagby or Angus when researching the
article back in November of last year.  One can debate whether or
not the story merited being on the front page of Wired in April,
but I think that decision was made for photogenic reasons more than
anything else.  Wired is offering NO support for the Zippies on this
tour, firstly because they didn't ask, and secondly because we've never
felt a responsibility for them.  It was just a story, we didn't make
it up, we might run a part 2 or we might not.

They simply don't have any competent people managing the tour, and
they're frittering away the publicity they have which could have possibly 
been put to much better use to really educate people.

Subject: Zippy Pronoia Tour to US '94 

The Zippies Are A Movement
The Movement Has No Leaders
There is an official Zippy Pronoia Tour To US '94
consisting at this moment of 12 simply real individuals
whose feet are on tour
There is an untold number of Zippies around the universe, 
the world, and in cyberspace,
transponding the Zippy Pronoia Vibe

The specific individual Fraser Clark is manifesting his 
life poem in San Francisco as an entity seperate from the
Zippy Pronoia Tour to US '94

And now, on with the show:

tonight, July 29, 1994, the Zippy Tour was invited to host
the Ambient Room at ELEVATE, in Tijuana, Mexico with music by 
the Zippy Tour Live Techno Band: Universal Sound (UK)
and ambient architecture provided by the Zippy Tour Artists.

Border realities between the US and Mexico being what they be, 
we could all have gone down to Tijuana with the equipment, yet 
not all would be allowed back across the border.  Thus, there
will be a Zippy Tour presence manifested at ELEVATE of a core
group of Zippies to keep the vibe alive.
Unfortunately, no equipment other than DAT and audio recordings
will accompany them

The only real Zippy Pronoia Tour Events are those we are 
communicating to you officially, with the next ones as follows:

Zippy Rave at The Works, Pheonix Arizona, August 16, 1994

YAY!! We're on the bill!  NARNIA, Vector Outbound San Diego
                                  August 20, 1994
>From which we will all transpond to the big one:

Zippy Rave in the Grand Canyon Area August 21-28
Further Details Forthcoming From US to YOU in a 
responsible fashion

Then, officially, at the Grand Canyon Area Event, 
the Zippy Pronoia Tour will be distributing vouchers
for $5 off the ticket price for the
Burning Man Festival, Black Rock Desert, Nevada
Sept 2 - 5
So that whomever so desires comes along parallel to the 
Zippy Pronoia Tour to US '94
Vector Outbound To Burning Man

Vector Transponder Information Throughput

 I believe that Willis managed to convey everything I wanted to say
about the final night of MOTION at Club FX. I understand that Friday 
evenings will be house music , but I still think that this special
weekly will be missed . I hope the people involved in holding it go
on too producing more and just as good/better events.

 One of my favorite MOTION memories will be the percusionists that were
allowed to bring their congas in and play ( as long as they weren't too
close to the DJ ) . I brought claves once , and one gal had a tambourine
this Wednesday. 
 Having a DJ playing the "endless groove" with live drummers that 
know what they're doing is always a potent combination with me!
It should happen more often.

 That was from a satire of "Star Wars" , called "Hardware Wars" .

I agree, I'm not interested in self-proclaimed 'leaders'.  I prefer to
work with those who lead by action and intention.

If this crew can pull off something to equal the original Megatripolis,
more props to 'em, SF could use a boost.  But unless the same folks who
organize MegaT come over and do it here too, I doubt the result will be
as good.  SF doesn't have a *single* weekly event of the Megatripolis
type, which of course is a niche to fill but also indicates how difficult
it is to get something that substantial going.  I also tend to think
that the more episodic efforts like Wicked, Gathering, etc. have been
more successful in this environment despite the many problems, because
of specific characteristics of the SF scene.  For one thing, as major
as it is, the club/going-out-for-music scene even in SF isn't anywhere
near the size and visibility it has in the UK right now.  Megatripolis
is just one little corner of a massive upsurge in club culture.  Another
point: in the UK, it's generally not possible any more to *do* the kind
of one-off, warehouse or outdoor events which still happen fairly often
here.  This makes it more like the scene in the east, particularly New
York, which is pretty much limited to clubs (aside from underground
one-offs which are not really in the realm Megatripolis occupies anyway).

Finally, I wonder what the established club/event promoters are going to
think of yet another set of out-of-towners trying to establish something
in SF.  The crew that came over from the UK in 1990-91 adapted very well
to local conditions, but quite frankly the lack of cultural awareness
and "scene sensitivity" from the various missives and pronouncements of
the Zippies don't lead me to anticipate big success.  As I've said before,
better to take the DIY approach, blend in with the natives, figure out
what you can add to the scene where it needs it and you can do it.

But we don't need any damn leaders, thank you very much!

I guess it's a little late for a reveiw, but here goes:

We arrived at the Marina around 3:30 and Solar was spinning some very
funky grooves.  There were already lots of people dancing, but the
crowd lacked the critical mass at that point to really get off just yet.
But we could tell that 	SOMETHING was going to happen there that day.

First of all, it was beautiful!  The weather was perfect - sunny, with
just enough breeze to cool you down.  There were maybe over a hundred
people sitting on the gentle slope up from the dance area in front of
the decks and people were laughing, talking, passing around paper bags
of plums...the trees are dropping them by the dozens around here it seems!

Soon after we got there, the MESS crew (mostly people who live at Chateau,
a student co-op at UC Berkeley) arrived and planted a flag at the top
of the hill where everyone was sitting.  On one of the white stripes they
had printed "United States of Free Love."  I guess it's official!

Then they passed out a sheet for all the various soundsystems and parties
to fill out...mostly a fact sheet asking for rental info, soundsystem
& party contacts, voicemail info, etc...that they are going to compile into
a phone list of sorts to give out to people who want it.  (Hmm..maybe
they should have had a category of: places NOT to throw a party, considering
recent events...)

By then, Galen was starting his set.  The crowd was loving it!  There were
 a lot more people dancing and you could feel a definite vibe emanating
from dancers.  A lot of the people there were "regulars" that i've seen
there pretty much every weekend & it seemed like everyone was thinking:
"this is the best sunset party yet!"

Also in the park that day was another soundsystem that was set up at the
other end of a pathway that runs along the water and then into the park.
I checked it out: John (Jon?) was playing some progressive house with a lot
of energy, but there were only a few people there.  I got the impression
it wasn't a flyered party...does anyone know who they were?

Spun went on after Galen and he played well beyond the sunset....the crowd
wouldn't let him go and shouted for more when tried to quick when it got
dark, and so he kept on giving the people what they want.  You could see
the lights of the city coming on from across the bay...it was such a 
beautiful sight to see that and also so many people together experiencing
musical nirvana.  *sigh*

Oh, I forgot to mention all the kites!! And the woman walking her Doberman
who jumped in and started dancing!  (You should have seen her poor dog..
he was so confused!  But then he got into it & went around everywhere 
checking people out...) And the guy jumping off the hill with a parachute!
(no kidding...)

Unfortunately, there will be no sunset party this weekend, due to a kite
festival/contest that will be held there.  At least, this is what i heard
last sunday.  But maybe he'll change his mind and do it anyway?  Call the
info line & see!

Nope; you answered the question yourself in the next sentence.

You're probably right.

The important distinction here is that the event needed a focus (the
sound system), which usually causes the structure to form naturally.
I think this is a better way than imposing the structure from outside
based on what you _think_ will happen -- because you might not be
right, and then you have conflict.  This is the problem of authority
-- it tries to enforce the future.

It sounds like the afterparty had the opposite problem, which is that the
expected future never came, so the energy people brought was spent against
each other in the absence of a focus (music), and the spontaneous order
never emerged.

I don't believe everything should be chaos, or that everything
_should_ be anything at all other than what it is.  I believe that
most people deny that chaos exists at all, or maintain that it is a
bad thing that can and should be stomped out.  I prefer to surf the
edge of chaos, and if I sometimes get dunked, well, that's life, and
if I sometimes hit ordered land harder than I'd like, well, that's
life too.  It's the people who try to pave the sea that scare me.

PS: Hey, I'm 100% done with the arcade game I've been working on for the
past (almost) two years!  If you see a T-MEK at yer local arcade, check it
out.  It's just starting to ship but many places around here are beta test
sites for us.  If not, ask.  It's easy to find; just follow the sound of
loud explosions.  I promise my next game will have techno in it; I wasn't
in charge of this one...

PPS: I finally dumped all my music-to-date to DAT, so Bryce, Steve,
and other interested folks should get to hear some of it soon.
Mysterious beautiful ambience, head-splitting power electronics,
bouncy electro-jazz damage, intense lights-off head trips, and more
not-very-classifiable stuff.  If you thought Richard James' ambient
was experimental this'll expand your mind.  If I generate enough interest
I'll probably press a CD...we'll see.  My bit on the Mind/Body CD was
about the harshest you can expect, but the sense of mystery (what _is_ that?)
remains...

I'm super bummed that since I've moved to Santa Cruz I won't be able to make
too many Sunset parties. Sunset was one of my favorite places to unwind after
a long weekend. How come nobody mentions Sean Murray from the Freak Out crew?
He has played at several Sunset parties and never gets props.

Hello Tamara,
I completely understand where you are coming from. I too belong to the 
collective of dj's which is ever snowballing. I meant that entry about 
not getting paid in a joking way. I was not trying to say that dj's 
shouldn't be paid or it's wrong etc. I was only trying to express my 
feeling for all the new dj's that seem to be coming out and spinning 
genuinly good music for free, because getting paid as a new dj is very hard.

Thanks for your opinion.
Jason D.

Well, it seems that transformation just never happened.  I showed
up later, like 2-3ish and there were a couple of confused ravers
walking up and down the railroad tracks...  and no word about
anything.  And the phone line still had the message that it was
going on.. and.. well,  Someone should've at least changed the 
message to let people know what happened.  A good twenty people
sat around for a an hour or so being confused.  but that's ok.
Perhaps Anthem of the Sun tonight will make up for it.
For now I'll just have to be content with my ferocious cat 
chewing on my foot.  yup.

anyway.
Good luck to those going to the other outdoor Santa Cruz thing tonight.

Hi folx--

my e-mail or phone number.

Craig has made a personal video copy for Malachi of the

directly to Malachi before he leaves on Monday.  Please
contact one of us if you know where he will be tomorrow,
Sunday!

Thanx,

Hello,

What think ye all of compiling a list (perhaps for the FAQ) of all the
local DJs, together with their "style"?

So that when one sees a flyer or ad that says:

DJs - Fred, Joe, and Gluph

one has a better idea of what style of music will be spun at the event.

I think you have the right idea.     I'll work towards that goal,  as

Since *you* came up with this idea, Ken, what do *you*
mean by "style"?  I'm not aware of your ever mentioning
raving as an activity you participate in, not having seen
any posts from you about raves you've gone to.  How about
telling us what you mean by this "style" thing, then?

Looking forward to your elucidation on this subject,

Unfortunately, the bottom half of my message was chopped off somewhere
along the line (you'll notice there was no .sig ).

I'm referring to style or sub-genre of music this DJ spins, ie
"progressive house", "acid trance", "gabber", and so forth.

The idea is that if you see a notice for an event, you at least have an
idea in advance what sort of music there will be.

As has been mentioned here before, very little information is provided
by promoters in advance.  [For example, for "Anthem of the Sun" last
night, there was no information other than a list of the DJs (in this
case, well known ones) and the location.  No age limit, cost, intended
starting or ending time, availability of water, exit priveleges, etc.]

Perhaps you thought I meant something like "flamboyant", "repressed",
"boring", "exciting"? :-) :-)

respect,

    Ken
    Ken.Stuart@tigerteam.org

PS What is this "validation" trip you are on?  Are you next going to
require everyone on sfraves to submit a blood test indicating positive
presence of psychoactive substances? :-) :-)

I think you might have a problem defining individual DJs style since many
DJs play a wide variety music. I think you might want to know more about the 
kind of party that they are spinnig at since that usually sets the tone for
the musical style. I don't know of too many DJs that only spin one kind of
music.
An example is Thomas (UK) he plays House, Deep House, Progressive House, Acid
House,
Acid Jazz, and Hip Hop.

Well, not quite Uncle Sam, but I want you - hyperreal has been up for
several weeks now and seems quite stable (needs to be rebooted
every couple of days, but I'm working on that) so I've been giving
out accounts to people willing to do projects here or help maintain
the mailing lists or archives.  I want to make hyperreal a real
community machine.  In exchange you get an account here, with
mail and news and all the usual Unix features, as well as a reliable
site for any other infomation-providing projects you might want to
work on.

If you are interested in helping out in sfraves-related projects here,
let me know.  Here's a sample of what I'd like to delegate:

1) Management of the sfraves list - basically someone to manage
bounces and the odd subscription request that didn't get automatically 
handled.  Approximately 20 minutes/day, but it needs to be done regularly.

2) Creation of and management of the SFRaves home page including
the pictures, flyers, and mailing list archives (possibly a couple
of people to work together on this)

3) Management of the Spirit and HoldYourOwn archives - putting these
documents into HTML and creating a nice interface to them, as well as 
updating them with other related documents lying around that belong
there. (possibly a couple of people here, too)

4) There are other projects I'm thinking about too... if you have
your own idea for something you think belongs here, let me know.

I have registered sfraves.org for this machine, and I'll be setting 
up the DNS for that soon.  If you're kinda in the dark about
what exactly we're all about, check out http://hyperreal.com/
or more specifically http://hyperreal.com/info/hyperreal/
for an idea.  If you don't have access to a web browser, telnet
to hyperreal.com and log in as "lynx" and it'll give you a text-
based hypertext browser.

Thanks in advance!

	Brian

So I arrive at this location around 2:15 am or so and there's people 
walking all around the streets and congregating at the door and seemingly 
waiting for something when all of a sudden the security guy says 
"nobody's getting in, everyone move out" and then suddenly a cop car 
pulls up a-la-streets-of-sanfrancisco-sideways and they announce "Get 
Moving or goto jail"  (something like that) so everyone disperses and I 
tried to ask some guy what happened and he tells me " I dunno, I was in 
there and they kicked me out cuz two girls was draggin' me downstairs" 
and right then and there I knew that I would get no answers to this 
run-on sentence.

So what happened anyway?

I'm not the "Fred" on the list and I have NO idea who Joe and Gluph are :)

But if I were, I don't know if I want to be type-cast as far as DJ style.
While DJs have distinctive "styles" it's awfully hard to categorize beyond
the very broadest generalities.  You could say, for example, that Ethan
and Laura are both "techno-trance" DJs but they play very different styles
to my ears anyway.  If Jeno is a "house" DJ, then where do you make the
distinction with Markie, Digit, Neon Leon, Jan Cooley and Tony, all of
whom can fairly be described as "house" DJs but have totally different
styles.

It's hard to figure how I would fit into a typology, since my whole approach
to DJing is grounded in the house environment but reaches out to dub,
techno and trance of various types, '70s funk and some ambient stuff.

To some degree we need labels, shorthand handles for a much more complex
reality.  But it's all too easy to cross the line into fixation with
labeling.  The map is NOT the territory!

After a few dance steps at the so called new club "Universe", same old
thing (177 Townsend), I taxied over to Ultraviolet around 12:30 - 1:00 last
night and I thought the atmosphere was great.

Now talk about a positive change.  Right away the music dragged me
immediatly to the dance floor.  The music was really good with hard techno
trance.  Now correct me if I'm wrong but I think the djs' name was Craig.
Wonderful stuff.

After awhile I made my way to the ambient room.  Very cool space. I ran
into Alex (Gaia Mantra) and he pointed me to Steve (resonate).  It was nice
to meet him in person after having a few words with him here on sfraves.
-"He reminded me that he (WBL) will be playing live at Gaia Mantra on Sat.
August 6th at 2:00pm.  If I'm not mistaken I think he also mentioned that
he will be playing the ambient room at F&FIII".

This was my first time in that location, 788 Minna (at ninth street).  I
thought the space was layed out quite nice.  Both rooms were of fair size
and well ventilated.  For the somewhat short time that I was there I
thought the energy was real good.  I would go back for sure.  Did not see
too many familiar sfravers so if anybody else were there I would love to
hear your comments.

my lap.  Special thanks to Mr Crunch for his sfr post.

To preface my review, I must admit my overwhelming desire 
for dancing that evening - I was giddy with anticipation.
A school girl

Around 1:00 or so I was directed into a secured parking area.
Near the water with pavement and gravel and rocks.
I would guess several hundred very beautiful people
Extremely Beautiful
Gorgeous, Frantic, Bubbly, Wild and Funky
not a sweaty pit
but Getting Down with an Urgency
a Fix
give it to me
all of it
Now

They moved around both sides of a dj/speaker area with some tents
and small fires off to the inland side.  A few decorated cars made
a loose semi-circle around this sortof designated chill area.

Within minutes (hours?) I was Bombarded with cookies, stickers,
flashing lights, nutty sounds, water, hugs and smiles
I had space to move - all around
Cool air to breathe (and smoke in)  
The sound was the Best  - dozens of sweet spots 
Decorations were minimal  
A low key underground
a Neo-Classical Rave Revivalist Movement

Simon, Christophe, Buck, Josh, Tracy is what I scratched onto
my directions.  I don't know who is what.  Tribal House with
liberal horns moved into Deeper House - busting out with the
Fusion references and some insane classic Jams.

By dawn there was a good crowd  
I could sense a Cast and Crew who knew their jobs
Worked me like a dog - and, overall, were as Cute as a Button
High Marks for the gratuitous Gogo dancing

I met almost no one - beyond the casual water/cigarette exchange
I wore a Red Hat and thought this was a Wonderful Party

Early Tuesday morning I will be getting on a plane to spend a week at the
Summer School for Designing Society, which I'm including a description of
below.  I'll be joing up with the regular Summer School students who have
already been there for 4 weeks.  These people seem to be on the same track
as a lot of us are, so I thought some of you might be interested to know
about it.  If you have any questions or comments you'd like me to bring
along on your behalf, feel free to mail me before I leave (no email in South
Dakota, it seems).  I'll try to take good notes and bring back a full
report.

peace,

SUMMER SCHOOL FOR DESIGNING SOCIETY, a five-week seummer school in Sioux
Falls, South Dakota, is a project of composers, performers, teachers and
engineers working with students to build a desirable society.

Rather than orienting participants to find a "comfy" spot within the current
social system, this summer school offers time, ambiance, and tools with
which people can energetically imagine, discuss, and begin to design, a
system they would prefer.

The Summer School zigzags between social concerns and artistic concerns:

1.  Participants will explore the question "What would I consider a
desirable society?"  In addition to being asked to consult their wishes and
desires, students will be given conceptual tools from the areas of
cybernetics, information theory, and composition.

2.  Participants will consider the question "Can I learn to use my
imagination to write prose, music and theater that would have desirable
consequences on society?"  Skills for composing (music, prose, and theater)
will be taught, and time will be set aside for writing, rehearsing, and
performing.
