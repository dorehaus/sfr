Went to Creation Sat.  I had a really good time but I still don't know
the story about the location confusion.  Was it supposed to be a two-part
two-location rave?  We showed up at the amusement park near Guernville
around 11:15 to find lots of ravers (mostly leaving the scene) and cops
(confused and friendly).  Luckily, my friend overherd someone who had a map
to the next stop, which was Scandia (the mini-golf-family-fun-center-thing-
chain/franchise - like the one by the Oakland coleseum).  This was back
the way we (and most ravers) had just come, near/in Santa Rosa.  We waited
for the line to diminish and then went in.  I thought it was $15 to get in
but the girl at the door said $20 so my friend (who was loaning my broke
self entry $) gave her a $50 and received $30 change, meaning we ended up
getting in for $10 so I don't know the story on that either.  Once we were
in it was really fun.  I think golf and bumper cars were free once you were
in but golf ended at some point.  There was also a wide assortment of vid
games.  The dance floor was in a large batting cage, complete with lights,
lasers, projections, and scented fog.  We left around 4:30, since this was
my second night of no sleep and lots of energy expenditure and no
stimulants - not even coffee.  I felt really high, though.  Probably the
lack of sleep combined with the dance floor's energy and a mild buz.
On the way out I saw another dance floor by/on the golf course.  It seemed
well lit and I couldn't tell if it was the same music as the other floor
or not.  Looking back, I think one of the succesful elements about this
rave was that it had the secure feeling of a club in that you weren't too
worried about it getting busted up, yet it was differen't than a club
scene and more unfamiliar than the clubs were used to.  There were, however,
rent-a-cops there who were avidly trying to bust people smoking pot in the
batting cage away from the dance floor (and probably other places too) but
we were all too sly.|-)

Subject: Female Techno Attraction?

I'm applying for a job at a new club here in SLC.  Today whilst talking with
the owner, he stated that he wanted techno, but music that females enjoy.
This probably sounds fairly sexist, but I've noticed that not many of them do
enjoy the hardcore stuff.  So what is it?  I'd like to hear from anyone who
can give me a perspective from the opposite sex.  What is it that you really
enjoy dancing/listening to?  KLF?  Disco divas?  Ambience?  I'm after a more
melodic techno.  I'm so sick of the "James Brown Is Dead" type stuff I wretch
every time I hear it.  Orbital and Future Sound is prime right now.

Females here have always told me they enjoy the "hip" music.  Stuff like Chili
Peppers (bleagh), but they also enjoy swing a lot.

Yeah, but Twitch's high prices are balanced by the fact that they gave away
over 100 CDs at that outdoor rave benefit thing in Golden Gate Park a few
weeks ago.  You just have to be at the right place at the right time.  (Hint:
At the cash register at BPM is the wrong place any time.)

For some reason I'm not looking forward to 10 monotonous techno tracks centered
around Dune samples.  And I'm really looking forward to T.99's album, which 
will probably be 10 monotonous techno tracks centered around choir samples.

If you want good rave music, stick to the Garth and Jeno tapes.

Can anyone recommend some good trippy ambient after-rave music -- something
along the lines of the KLF "Chill Out" CD or the Orb stuff?

A couple months ago I typed in this list of CD compilations for a friend.  I've
bought a few more since then, but they're at home.  I'll try to remember to
type them in later.  

My favorite store for CD compilations is Butch Wax on 18th near Castro in SF. 
Clay the guy who works there will often play the CD for you before you buy it
and he's always willing to recommend discs if you tell him what you like.  The
prices are a bit high, but I think it's worth it to pay a few extra bucks
knowing that I'll like it since I just heard it.

The Tower Records on Market St. near 16th in SF has a decent selection that's
usually pretty current

Let's see.  Here are some of my favorite Techno tracks from my CDs.  I'll list
the title of the CD cmpilation and then my favorite tracks (group first, song
second) from each:

Compilation:  XL Recordings -- 2nd Chapter
Tracks: T99 -- Anasthasia
	Channel X -- Rave the Rhythm
	Holy Noise -- The Noise
	The Prodigy -- Charly
Review: killer techno (4 stars)

Compilation:  Thin Ice 2
Tracks: Cubic 22 -- Night in Motion
	LFO -- We Are Back		(LFO's album is great, too!)
	Moby -- Go
Review: some killer techno, some pop house, long-playing CD (3 stars)

Compilation:  Techno EX-TACY
Tracks: LA Style -- James Brown is Dead
	Praga Kahn -- Rave Alarm
	2 Unlimited -- Get Ready for This
	Dangerous Zone -- Naughty
	Interactive -- Dance Motherfucker
Review: more killer techno, plus a few things I hadn't heard before (3.5 stars)

Compilation:  Techno Sonic
Tracks: Phantasia -- Inner Light
	Day Dreamer -- Happy Dreams
	Cold Sensation -- Control the Universe
	Trance Trax -- Odd Flute
Review: sorta acidy techno, happier feel to it than hard techno.  Cool stuff
	(3.5 stars)

Compilation:  Strictly Rhythm
Tracks: Logic -- The Warning		(I love this one!)
	(this one is new enough that I don't recognize the names yet, but
	they're all good if you find the CD)
Review: majorly cool house/techno with an acid jazz feeeellll to it.  (4 stars)

Compilation:  Deep Heat 11 -- Spirit of Ecstasy
Tracks: Altern 8 -- Activ 8
	Bizarre Inc -- Playing with Knives
	Anticapella -- 2 * (231)**.5
	Control -- Dance with Me
	Shades of Rhythm -- Extacy
	Fierce Ruling Diva -- Rubb It In
	Rozalla -- Faith
	Sabrina Johnson -- Friendship
Review: another long CD -- lots of bouncy pop house and mild techno.  This one
	really gets me goin'.  (4 stars)

if you don't have the import double-CD Orb album, i think it's worth finding.
i also like the Art of Noise ambient album.  and Give Peace a Dance (V2 - the
ambient collection) isn't bad.  a bit less interesting than some ambient.

also, do you have the Josh tape called Depth?  it's utterly fantastic. softer,
if not entirely ambient, house.  my absolutely favorite apres-rave chill out
music.   also interesting in that the first two tracks on the "A" side (or what
i have labeled the A side) are "happier" - lighter, arier, but not cloying,
than most house.

don't ask me what kinda music wymyn enjoy, but i certainly do get sick
of them stupid sounding repetitive techno synth leads. you know that
five-note non-chord progression baap-baap-bap-baap-bap sound.  and
then there's the monotony of fast 16th-note nonsyncopated beats. turns
you into a human metro-gnome. 

there's music you can pogo & convulse to (hard techno) and then
there's music you can dance & gyrate to. i bet the funkier stuff may
help get a better mix o' sex onto the dance floor.  this needs to be
done w/o turning it into a hip-hop/kmel/wild-107 type of event. 

while i have certainly enjoyed having my brains mashed into squamous
tofuburger with hard techno on a loud&crisp sound system. there are
times when a bit of funk is in order, or at least a good dubwise ragga
bass line.  future sound o' london's papua new guinea does it for me
in that respect. 

i've long been lamenting the lack of industro-dub sounds at raves. i'd
really like to hear dj's (re)mixing in some mark stewart & maffia,
fats comet, gary clail, keith leblanc, spike, old tackhead, etc. i guess
the problem is that some of that would be considered "old hat" and "too
mainstream" by trendo rave djs.

I have about a half dozen ambient house CDs that I like:

	State of Mind (domestic, I think)
	The Orb (domestic, although the import is a double and is better)
	The Orb -- The Aubrey Remixes (import, but now available domestic I

	The Art of Noise Ambient Collection (domestic, some of the samples
		are the same as the samples on The Orb album.)
	Enigma MCMXM (or whatever that roman numeral is -- domestic)
	System 7 (import -- many of the same artists who did the Orb. 
		Actually this one is a bit bouncier than pure ambient, but
		I like it.)
	808 State -- (Oh, jeez, I can't remember the name of the album,
		but it's way different than their earlier stuff.  Again, it's
		a little bit more intense than ambient, but I like it.  Check
		out the Muzak(TM)-like remix of Cubik!)
	Frazier Chorus -- (Oh, jeez, I can't remember the name of this one
		either, but it has dolphins on the cover.  It's sort of vocal
		mellow house-ish.  Mellow but not ambient.  I think this one is
		an import, too.)

No doubt.  I really like Anaconda for the bend and twist.  Too bad I only have
two of their tracks, with no likelihood of finding anything else.

The problem with the hardcore stuff is that most of the dancing fools like it,
but the majority hates it.  If you play a song the majority likes, they
usually sit on their stools and say "wow, cool song", while six people thrash
it up on the floor.

I usually work in some Renegade Soundwave and ALWAYS a Meat Beat track here
and there.  I think this new Ragga stuff is a poor immitation of dub.

Thanks for the advice though.

hi y'all!
i just came back from a week's trip to the lone star state . i was at
a conference, but was able to go out couple of times. someone on the
alt.rave list recommended some clubs to check out - basically all the
interesting places are on elm st. anyway, we went to to the clearview
club, and it was really good. 1st there was a room with a bar and dinner
type atmosphere, which later gave way to some top-40 music. then a bit back
there was a different room where they had tekno music and a smart bar.
the music was EXCELLENT - mike, i heard some twitch stuff even.
then there was a hip-hop/rap room, and these folks were really getting
down. the atmosphere was pretty friendly, kinda in between a rave and
the i-beam :). i asked the woman at the smart bar if there are ever
all night raves, and she said that every few weeks someone puts one
on.
take care/salam/shalom/rave on

What can I say, I had the best time that I have had in a long while.
Everything turned out quite well.  Fortunately, I bought my tickets
in advance at ameba and just sowed up and picket them up saving $15.
Someone this was around 6 pm on Saturday, someone their told us
that the location had changed and that Mark (the co-owner) had left
for the new location to set up.  I noted this but decided to head
for gurneville(sp?) anyway. We drove up 101 passing Scandia and arrived
at J amusement park around 8:30 pm.  There were a bunch of ravers in cars
parked in a lot close to the amusement park, which seemed kinda small.  I
wend over to scope the place out with the excuse that I needed to go to
the bathroom (actually I did need to go to the bathroom!) and saw a
flier posted on the wall saying basically that the event had  been moved.
Ravers were milling around, eventually the police came and moved every
body on.  A Raver in an orange hat took it upon himself to direct every
body to a privately owned parking lot near a beach, I found a legal place
to park right outside of this and sat my car down there.  Eventually the
owner came out and made everyone move.  We milled around at this beach
for about an hour, someone brought a duro-flame log and people danced
to techno played out of boom-boxes.  Around 10:30 rumors about the
actual site started to filter in... it was at Scandia, south of santa
rosa,  I remembered what I had heard.  We drove the 20 miles back
to Scandia arriving at around 11, families were leaving, a guy at the
gate told us about their policy about leather jackets with patches
and that the park was closing in ten minutes,  I saw a raver standing
next to him so I basically said "Um were her for the rave?" He said OK
and directed us to park in a field on the side of the parking lot.
At this point I began to wonder whether the whole gurneyville thing
was what is called in military terminology a "feint", that is send
all the forces toward one target to buy time , eventually they'll figure
it out but you'll be ready by then.  I just thought how "inconveinent"
it would be for the family image if hundreds of dosed ravers descended
on this "fun for the whole family" scene before it was closed.  This
problem was neatly avoided, the two groups that used scandia that day
never collided.
	Once I got in, I made my typical quick search to check out the
space and get the "lay of the land", the nature of the typology, etc.
It had a central enclosed, lighted and heated area (this is NORTHERN
California after all) which contained a plethora of video/pinball and
game machines, concession stands selling greasey nachos and French fries
and the ever present corn dog.  It also contained the restrooms.
Ameba and the smart bar was out in the cold along the perimeter of the
video arcade, there was some sort of miniature golf course but I didn't
pay much attention to it.  The whole place was dominated by a cheesey
imitation of the Disney castle (more about this later). Some serious
Techno was being played in the "batter's cage" and I could see a fog
machine going off.  For some reason we were not allowed in right away,
this was actually great because it created tension so that when people
actually did get in they WENT OFF!  The energy was really great!  I saw a
lot of people dancing with total abandon (including myself!).  One woman
dancing in the same batter's cage with me kept taking more and more stuff
off.  I t was sorta cold outside but the temperature was definately
rising on the dance floor.  I danced for several hours straight, at one
point I had a truly esstatic experience (although those of you who know
me know that this is not uncommon for me:).  Pretty soon the sky was
beginning to get light,  I stopped and went into the arcade, there were
ravers passed out in corners, dozens of ravers obviously dosed on A or
X huddled in clumps in various places on the floor.  It was good to get
warm, get some water go to the bathroom, etc.  Two smart drinks, and
a powerbar later and I was ready to go again!  I must say that except
for a few macho blockheads, the energy on the dance floor was
exceptional. Around 5:30 Ernie is spinning some great shit, everybodies
still dancing, I look over and people are dancing on the spires of the
"castle"! I can't imagine how this must have looked to tired travelers
or groggy early morning trucker going by on 101.  At 6 Ernie announces
that he's playing the last song but that the after party will be at
a beach along the Russian river half way between Santa Rosa and
Gurneville,  We decide that a caravan of dosed drivers is safer than
people setting out individually and put the "straight and sober" people
in the lead, with a couple in the back to protect against CHP comming up
from behind.  People arrive at the designated beach around 7 pm.  It was
truly bizzare to see a bunch of skateboard ravers doing their thing in
the middle of this country road.  Around 7:30 the generator arrives
and we carry it down the hill to the beach along with a "coffin". We
patch it all together and ernie is spinning by 8.  I'm amazed at how much
energy people still have although many people are using this
as an opportunity to get some sleep before heading back to the city.
The sky was overcast and sorta foggy but this is common for mornings in
this part of the state, I knew it would burn off by 11.  Everything is
just dandy but obviously when things are in balance the only way that
their can be change is for them to go out of balance. So the local
sheriff shows up at about 9:30.  I must say that he was truly a nice 
guy and was only their because some neighbors complained.  I and another
raver named Sharon took it upon ourselves to deal with him and basically
worked everything out.  He wanted to know who was in charge and we told
him noone, this seemed to blow his mind, that 400 people could descend 
on this beach set up a generator and sound system, start dancing manage
carpools etc, not be violent and have noone in charge.  But never the
less (I guess this is what anarchistic consensus is all about) it was
true, I told him that even though I was not in charge, we didn't want any
trouble and we wanted to make his job easy and still have a good time, if
possible,  " He said I like what this guy is saying over here".  
He said "That personally he had no problem with what we were doing
and that if he was off duty, he'd come by and have a beer with us, but
that he was on duty and that the neighbors were complaining that they
couldn't use the beach, etc."  I told him that it was not our  intention
to "take over" the beach, we were just dancing, that the neighbors were
more than welcome to come and join us or that we would even move to a
more isolated part of the beach if they wanted.  Eventually we worked out
a deal that we would drasticly turn down our music by 10:30, if that
didn't work, we would stop the generator and just play our boom boxes.
I told him that If there was any problem to come back at 10:30 and we
would iron it out and that we would leave the beach cleaner then we found
it. (Which indeed we did!)  Just then, an older couple came up from the
beach, they had gone down to check out these "invaders" they told the
Sheriff "It's allright Joe, they're not doin nuthin, just dancin that's 
all" so the cops left happy, we were happy and the after party continued
until we blew a fuse (around 11:15) anyway.  All in all it was a great
weekend and the locals said that we were such a nice group that they'd
let us come BACK!.

Absafuckinglutely. The UVC prerelease listening party we had in Jeff's car
outside of "Blow Your Head" was a musical epiphany for me. It's good to
hear such vital new blood transfused into the occasionally anemic
dancefloor techno scene. UVC's first single engenders this vitality like an
intravenous squirting pure uncut hits-o-joy straight into the jugular!

So anyways, y'all should check out this soon-to-be-a-hit wundertechno as
soon as it gets off the Twitch presses! Good job, Jon, Jeff & Mike!

Personally, I like some of the earlier techno-ambient stuff, such as:

    -   Brian Eno, esp. "Another Green World"
                        "Before and After Science"
                        "Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy"

    -   Roxy Music/Phil Manzanera, esp.
                        "Country Life"
                        "Diamond Head"
                        "801 Live"

    -   Quiet Sun (Phil Manzanera side band),
                        "Mainstream"

    -   Peter Gabriel, esp.
                        The first three albums...
                        Soundtrack to "Birdy"

    -   Mahavishnu Orchestra (w/ John McLaughlin), esp.
                        "Birds of Fire"
                        "Live"

    -   Be-Bop Deluxe, and Bill Nelson, esp.
                        "Live in the Air Age"

Clinging to an old submarine-launched transport system called Trident, those

bill nelson has done lots of more ambient-oriented stuff, like the
double "Chance Encounters In The Garden Of Light" set and the Bill
Nelson's Orchestra Arcana albums.  Of the BNOA stuff, "Optimism" is
best, with "Iconography" a good runner-up.  There was a US release of
"The Love That Whirls (Diary Of A Thinking Heart)" which had his
soundtrack for La Belle Et La Bete (beauty and the beast) included as
a free bonus LP.  Good place to start - you get one of his best pop
song records and a good ambient disc too.  I got my copy for $3
several years ago...

Subject: Ambient music-

  One of my very best favorite things to play during the chilltime
is the music of Eric Satie, a French composer of the early
20'th century (and a friend of my father,who for various reasons,
I am very proud- he was one of the people whose works-he was a modernist
composer..led to the modern techno-industrial milleiu...)

Satie's music is incredible.. it leads one to a moody,erotic and sensual space
that is mind-altering in it's intensity..

Some other suggestions-
Dead Can Dance - any record..
Michael Stearns - Planetary Unfolding..
(this is the most "cellular" record, Ive ever heard..don't really
know how else to put it..)
Brian Eno - any of the "music for films" records,"On Land" are my personal
favorites..

Subject: anatomy of a full moon bust


This morning, I talked to some people who helped put the full moon rave on.  
Specifically, I talked to the people living in the house where it was 
at before it got busted.  They are facing possible eviction by their 
landlord.

The guy told me that California Highway Patrol has a keen interest in busting
every full moon starting from a few months ago.... why? who knows?  Anyway, 
they seem to be desperate to find out where the location of FMRs are.  So I
asked him how they found out about the last one and this is what he said, 
(paraphrased)
"The location was kept really quiet until the same day and then someone put
the location on a computer network in the early afternoon.  Somebody 
reading the network told his friend who happened to be a college radio DJ and 
the DJ broadcast the fact that FMR was happening and it's location.  It was
only a matter of time before the highway patrol found out after that."

When he said that, I went "gulp", because I suspected he was talking about 
the sfraves mailing list.  The way he described it later on, I think
it could only be sfraves.  Anyway, I emailed a very vague description of
the location of the last FMR to sfraves but I did that at about 6pm
and I didn't get a copy of my email until about 8pm.

The result of all this is that he asked me and everybody else on our
"network" not to post any date/location info. regarding the FMR.  He wants to
keep it totally word-of-mouth and he doesn't want any written info.
about its location or date put anywhere including the net.  I think
sfravers who aren't in the know should get some contacts who are and
thus we can keep all FMR info off sfraves.  

By the way, he said they probably won't have a FMR this month because
of all the trouble with the last one.... so we'll see.....

Braving the raving,
 - TAXI

ps. Comeunity last night was a blast.  It was so full of positive energy.

The disc says only "State of Mind" and all the pieces appear to be by the same
group, therefore I imagine that it's the name of the band.  It's on Next
Plateau records.

After re-listening to it, it's definitely a bit dancier than ambient, but

eon's singles "spice" and "fear: the mindkiller" are almost nothing
BUT dune samples over mediocre techno tracks.

t-99's singles "anasthasia" and "nocturne" feature the choir sample in
extremis.  they had a single out a few years back called "invisible
sensuality" that is devoid of choir samples, but it isn't that great.

Keep us in chemistry posted on it or catch Jai or I(VooDoo) at the coffee house.
We will probably be hanging out in this (un)Greater area at least through Sat.

The disc says only "State of Mind" and all the pieces appear to be by the same
group, therefore I imagine that it's the name of the band.  It's on Next
Plateau records.

After re-listening to it, it's definitely a bit dancier than ambient, but
mellow all around.

	I am not much up on things as I have only experienced the LA rave scene
during the Gilligan's II/ unification mumbo jumbo but there is a place called the Probe.(xqqqqs my overrun here!)  The place is absolutely slamming and they 
can pick up other information there.  I'd advise them to stick to the smallest 
thing that they see.  Bigger is definitely NOT better in LA!

	O my god. 

	Well, in my defence, I didn't announce the location at KALX. I made
sure of that. (But I did tell people who called up asking specifically for
info where it was, I didn't even hint over the air that I knew about it..)

	But yes, it was sfraves that was apparently responsible for it.

	I don't know what to say; I mean, on one hand the main person responsible for the leak was whoever
decided to take the message off the list, give it to their DJ friend and
broadcast it. On the other hand, I feel responsible because on Thursday I
was pushing for somebody to post the info as soon as they got it. :( With
174 people on the list, maybe there was no way to prevent something like
this. Maybe the only way we'll be able to find out about future fmr's is
to call Ameoba clothing the day of the event, which wouldn't be efficient,
and who's to say they're gonna tell a complete stranger over the phone?
This is everything I didn't want - exclusivity....

	Maybe the thing to do now is to try and redeem ourselves.

	A few eeks ago we had a moderately sized conversation about possible
new locations for FMR's. People from UCSC suggested we use the beaches around
there, since large private events are often held on oil company property
with no trouble at all. Would somebody from UCSC like to find the ideal
beach for an FMR, and report back to us? The single best place; the next
step would be to call Ameoba Clothing and ask for (Fred? One of those
guys) who knows the people involved with the FMR's. Tell him/them about the
location, have them come down and visit, etc., and maybe the location 
can be set before the middle of the this month.

	That's the GOOD half of what we can do.

	The other half.... well, I don't want to do anything that might 
jeopardize my running for President someday (OOOPS! Too late! Well, my
graduating from Cal at least), but there must be a way we as a list
can act to help keep the fuzz in the dark, or at least too preoccupied
with other things to check out a silly little noise complaint :) TI think
if I explicitely line possibilities out I might be crossing the line, but
I think many of you know what I mean. As for narcs on the net, there's nobody
with a sfpolice.gov or scpolice.gov on, but again with 174 somewhat
anonymous people on the list, anything's possible.

	So again, foetus, all of you at ucsc, let us know what consensus
you reach; remember, private property is the best if it's without neighbors...
do the oil companies know about the local events held on their property?
If they do, I think telling them about the FMR (in totally oblique terms - 
a "party" with about "a hundred people", done by "midnight" :) wouldn't be
bad.

	And again, TAXI, if you talk to the owners of the house, tell them
I'm VERY sorry.

	Brian

Subject: anatomy of a full moon bust
Status: RO


This morning, I talked to some people who helped put the full moon rave on.  
Specifically, I talked to the people living in the house where it was 
at before it got busted.  They are facing possible eviction by their 
landlord.

The guy told me that California Highway Patrol has a keen interest in busting
every full moon starting from a few months ago.... why? who knows?  Anyway, 
they seem to be desperate to find out where the location of FMRs are.  So I
asked him how they found out about the last one and this is what he said, 
(paraphrased)
"The location was kept really quiet until the same day and then someone put
the location on a computer network in the early afternoon.  Somebody 
reading the network told his friend who happened to be a college radio DJ and 
the DJ broadcast the fact that FMR was happening and it's location.  It was
only a matter of time before the highway patrol found out after that."

When he said that, I went "gulp", because I suspected he was talking about 
the sfraves mailing list.  The way he described it later on, I think
it could only be sfraves.  Anyway, I emailed a very vague description of
the location of the last FMR to sfraves but I did that at about 6pm
and I didn't get a copy of my email until about 8pm.

The result of all this is that he asked me and everybody else on our
"network" not to post any date/location info. regarding the FMR.  He wants to
keep it totally word-of-mouth and he doesn't want any written info.
about its location or date put anywhere including the net.  I think
sfravers who aren't in the know should get some contacts who are and
thus we can keep all FMR info off sfraves.  

By the way, he said they probably won't have a FMR this month because
of all the trouble with the last one.... so we'll see.....

Braving the raving,
 - TAXI

ps. Comeunity last night was a blast.  It was so full of positive energy.

TAXI quotes:
" "The location was kept really quiet until the same day and then
" someone put the location on a computer network in the early
" afternoon.  Somebody reading the network told his friend who
" happened to be a college radio DJ and the DJ broadcast the fact that
" FMR was happening and it's location.  It was only a matter of time
" before the highway patrol found out after that."

The power of networks!  This is great!  Except in this particular case ...

I was at the Zanzibar with address in hand, asking where it was so I
could compare notes.  The bartender told me they wouldn't let anyone
know until after 2AM.

I asked Malachy how I could find out where it was to be.  He said I
could call him the night of the rave, since it wasn't to get out
before that (this was a day before the event -- Thursday).  (I of
course understood.  If I had it myself before the event, I would have
waited until late evening before posting to sfraves.)

Those organizing the Full Moon Rave definately tried not to let the
word out too soon.  Unfortunately there was a good-hearted leak
someplace, somewhere, or more than just one:

I heard that Ameba Clothing on Haight was giving the address to
anybody who asked much earlier than the start of the event.

Also, I asked some Sheriff guy why this party was a problem, and he
gave me a standard answer:  complaints.  Is this true?  Would
complaints have closed the event anyway regardless of whether the
radio show broadcasted the location?

***

I was afraid all this would happen.  I think this is where we need to
go from here (in my naive opinion):

* As usual, continute to try to find places that are good and avoid trouble.

* Try not to tell everyone and their mother until near time.

* SFRavers -- that means don't post the EMail to the list until about
  8-9PM (it's safe then, since Soda takes a couple of hours to deliver
  it, is 10-11PM too early?)

* A lot of us will know other people on the list -- and will find out
  for ourselves by calling around.  Just expect to use the telephone
  more than usual, I guess.  Or, we could use private e-mail.


Is there a way we can do this so that no ham will ever know?

Subject: Legalizing FMR..?

 Maybye the solution would be to set up a nonprofit corporation...
(The Foundation for Full Moon Raving?) to do legal-large full moon
raves.. People would be paid,an inexpensive admission would be charged..
sort of a collective, no promoters...
This approach is necessary, because the FMR will be squelched
again and again if it is not legalized..now that the local establishment
seems to be on a vendetta against it.... Or it will have to stay so small
that it will become a nasty elitist event.. There is just no middle
ground..there are too many (cool,good people,who should be there..who want
to go..to keep it underground much longer.
-also, safety should be provided for.. Remember the guy who fell
off the cliff two FMR's ago.. If you have 500-1000 people..
some type of emergency medical care should be accessible..
The Rainbow Gatherings should be a model.. The rainbows have a very
good reputation now (after 15 or more years..)of cleaning up after
themselves..etc..
Also, we don't raelize it, but there are people in the community who
would step forward to help,people with money..We are carrying on
a grand SF tradition...

e info - practical information about ecstasy

[This is second in a series.  I have a copy of both the first and
second online.  The first page or two appear the same for both, so
I'll just copy the old one (and miss minor changes) ... but the
last few pages of #2 have some more info!  Have I missed any? -ulmo]

* The multifaceted jewel *
Ecstasy catalyzes a powerful experience that takes many different
forms.  It can provoke an intense, energetic, spiritual high or lead
to warm, loving relaxation.  It can connect people freely and openly
with each other or promote deep inner thinking and analysis.  Sensual
yet not necessarily sexual, beautiful and sometimes dangerous, Ecstasy
covers a wide range of human emotions, experiences, and passions.
What you put into it is what you get out, so be sure to explore the
many facets of the experience.

* Those little annoying side effects *
Although some people say it has no side effects, Ecstasy is not the
perfect drug.  Users have reported a variety of mild physical symptoms
such as jaw clenching, teeth grinding, eye wiggles, tightened muscles,
sweating, chills, increased heart rate, blood pressure and body
temperature, auditory effects, nausea, shaking, and next-day
sleepiness.  Occasionally it can cause toxic reactions in people with
asthma, heart conditions, diabetes, epilepsy, psychosis, or
depression.  Remember, Ecstasy is a power drug.  Treat it -- and your
body -- with respect.

* As time passes ... *
Myths abound concerning Ecstasy's effects after repeated usage.  Most
claims (such as that it causes Parkinson's disease or drains spinal
fluid) actually refer to other drugs or common misconceptions.
Although scientists suspect some nerve terminal damage and
neurotransmitter depletion in the brain based on animal research, the
true long term effects and implications remain a mystery until further
human research becomes legal.  By avoiding the temptation to use
Ecstasy too frequently, you can lessen the risk and have more fun.

* Less is more *
An active dose of Ecstasy depends on one's body weight, sensitivity,
and prior use.  A typical "hit" contains 75-125 milligrams.  Over 175
milligrams increase side effects for many users.  Taking a larger dose
does not necessarily mean a better experience -- it may be more
"speedy," but less ecstatic.

* Some tips for Ecstasy users *

> Drink lots of water to replenish body fluids.

> From time to time, stop dancing and chill for a while.  Take deep
  breaths and relax.

> Maintain a healthy lifestyle outside the raves: eat a balanced diet,
  take vitamins, and get plenty of sleep.

> Remember: Less is more.  Large or frequent doses can increase the
  side effects without adding to the experience.

> Integrate what you've learned.  Think about your thoughts and
  feelings and try to apply them to real life.

> Much of what is sold as Ecstasy is not pure MDMA.  Be cautious of
  what you buy and who you buy from.  Impurities may include
  amphetamine, LSD, heroin, or PCP.

> Alcohol can reduce or change the effects of Ecstasy, and the
  combination can cause undesired effects.

Pardon me for piping up here, but it seems like perhaps we could do the
map point thing.  Now I know it's a little trying at times 
(see: mail about Creation) but if we just had one map point that was, say,
20~30 miles away from the real rave (into the next juridiction?) and we didn't
let out the address for the map point until 9 pm...

I assume a cop wouldn't hold a hapless raver to the ground under the heel of
his/her boot and demand the location of the event under threat of 
mutilation...but perhaps I'm wrong...

I think so.  I've been to (or thrown) plenty of parties that have been
busted up by police that certainly weren't announced on a computer
network or radio station.  When there's a party with several hundred
people, some neighbor is going to complain (if there are neighbors!).
The last FMR was in a nice neighborhood to boot.  It was destined to
receive complaints.  sfraves certainly helped increase the number of
people there, but I don't think it had much to do with the police being
invited.  Isn't this whole CHP thing just a paranoia/conspiracy-theory
belief of the organizers?

But that's a good point.  It doesn't matter if the CHP is out to get
us or not.  If the FMR organizers believe they are, and if they
believe sfraves is responsible for some of their problems, we've got
problems.  People have made a couple suggestions for how we ought to
handle it.  Maybe someone should ask the FMR organizers what they
think.  Let's try to work with them.  Hey, imagine that, ravers working
together!

I agree with Brian.  The best way to avoid problems is to come up with
a good location.

So, lets throw an SFR-FMR!  If we can figure out this location thing,
let's go for it.  If we can show you can have a large rave without
it being busted by police, and if it's organized by sfraves people,
we may redeem the sfraves list.  When is the next full moon anyway?
Maybe too soon to organize this?

Anatomy of a full moon bust? Y'all must be heavily into T&A....

Being a law-abiding goody-goody citizen of this here proud nation
(harumph!), I think that a lot of trouble could be avoided by having the
FMRs totally above-ground, legal, but still word-of-mouth.

The great thing about amerikkka is that everybody has the freedom to act
like a Republican. Find a loophole in the law and abuse it! Yeeehaw!!

If it FMR was just a gathering of << 100 people, you could probably get
away with it as an underground event. When hundreds of people show up, some
one is going to notice. Remember -- there's nothing illegal about having a
private party as long as no neighbors complain. Make sure that no money
changes hands at the door -- use a map point to sell tix and treat these
tickets as "invites to a private party".

Take a look at how well the Creation rave went off. There were cops
patrolling up and down the streets & the parking lots, but nary an oinker
was to be found within the premises itself. (Renta-cops notwishstanding).

W/r/t people talking about holding a FMR on someone else's property (e.g.
the oil company property in Santa Cruz) -- sounds like a perfect formula
for a bust.

Also remember that companies don't take kindly to people trespassing on
their property. If someone gets hurt on company property, the company may
be liable. For a company with deep pockets, this can be a problem.

Remember kids -- It's all fun and games till someone gets their eye poked out!

With a passel of sarcasm and a plethora of sharp gouging instruments,

It's counterintelligence time, folks.

If the Statspoletzei are that interested in breaking up dance parties, let's 
make it interesting and confusing for them. A little intelligence fieldcraft 
will surely tie their brains into knots.

1. "The Canary Trap." Issue MANY messages about the location of the next 
FMR. Make them all point to slightly different places, and keep track of
who got what message. When the deal goes down, you'll be able to tell which
of your communication links are compromised.

2. Misdirection. Well before a FMR, announce lots of potential sites, and
don't announce the final one until the "last minute," perhaps through leaving
the true destination information at "dead drops" at the potential sites.

3. "Dead drops." A dead drop is place to store messages, like a hollow log or
behind a brick. You can have unattended map points this way. Use only a few
copies of the message, so the drop "expires" after a few people pick it up.

Combining these techniques with others already discussed like telephone trees
would make for more secure FMRs. Enjoy...

of busts.  Absolute necessity: leave the place better than we found it (When

bennet@redwood.com proposes:

>So let's throw an SFR-FMR!

	I like this idea a LOT, and if there's interest on the net I'll
help organize it (what help I can be from 400 miles away, I don't know,
but I have an idea of the resources available to us...). The next full
moon is on Sunday the 14th (having it on Sunday night is better than
Saturday, I would imagine... less competition). We have a week and a half;
if we can get everything secured for that night, we can tell Ameba
(tell them ONLY to tell other ravers who come IN THE STORE), maybe tell
BPM, a few other places... well, let me do this right:


	DJ's: We had some TERRIFIC guys at the sfraves picnic, from
Pete Grassi to
Scott and Robbie Hardkiss. I know there are other DJ's on the list, too...
I don't think the Hardkisses do anything on Sunday nights, but asking them
soon is probably a priority. 

	LOCATION: Santa Cruz might be far for most of us, but if it truely
is a safe place it might well me worth it. Anybody down there get back to
me as soon as you can about exact details.

	SOUND SYSTEM - I'm assuming the turntables and mixer can be 
provided by someone on the list. The amp and speakers, if no one on the net
has a loud pair, could probably be rented by someone up there who wouldn't
mind serving as a bank for a little bit. I did my turn as the bank for the
sfraves picnic, and all went well with that; as far as cost is concerned,
for $200-250 we could probably rent a system as loud as anything the normal
FMR people have, plus $25 for a generator, and someone needs to bring a
light to. There are two ways I can think of to pay for it - either charge
a small admisson ($2-4) if the beach has only one way of access, or if
it would be impossible to charge admission hand out flyers that say something
like, "Are you n-joi-ing the rave? Please help us, the organizerd, break
even by donating $2 to the box next to the DJ stand. Peace." or something
like that. If 500 people show up, I think at least 1/3 of them would volunteer
some money (and nobody can claim financial hardship from $2)

	LIGHTING/EFFECTS - It wouldn't take too much to satisfy this; it's
not like we're trying to light up Moscone or anything :) Maybe someone down
at UCS has some spare projectors..?

	If not, there's a great place in SF to rent light - one of those
oil/water projectors was $25 for the weekend or something - I can't place the
info I had on it, but it was in the Mission district, east side, right next to t
the train tracks...

	Also, Pro-Formance Audio in Berkeley is probably the best place to
rent a system. The sfraves picnic system was $150 (two 15" woofers in their
own cabinet, two more cabinets with 12" woofers a midrange, and a tweeter
each, and a PV-800 amp which was more than suitable)

	What else? I know I'm missing something. Maybe I'll come back up there
a few weeks early to attend this....

At that club in Santa Clara...what was the name of that place???

SHARON MEETS DESTINY.

The number for A Rave Called Sharon is... (415) 995-4959

I decided after all this informative discussion about compilation 
albums and ambient goodies, to head down to the Tower in mountain view.
Two fellow ravers had applauded a young fellow named robert who is a 
supervisor and rave-lover there.  I met Robert right off, and he was not
only helpful, but excited about showing me what was what in the rave music
world.  His first choices being ZOO Rave and the XL Chapter 2 stuff.
Anyway, he's a real friendly sort and the selection over there seems fair.

He gave me the following directions to the above mentioned rave (which I'm
sure everyone knows where is except me) which he HIGHLY recommended as being
a positive-energy type of rave (as opposed to a meathead rave)

101 towards San Jose
De La Cruz exit west to Martin Ave.
Right on Martin, 1.5 miles to 1400 Martin Ave.

Was my computer down last nite, or is there just so little info as to not be
worth putting out a list this week?

I'm 99.44% sure of this information.  The rave is on Sunday, the same day as
the Haight St. Fair.  It will be from noon to (six? sundown?) in Marx Meadow,
where it was on Memorial Day, near Fulton and 25th.  I'm 100% sure that the
Haight St. Fair is on Sunday, so if the plug gets pulled (knock on wood: 
knock, knock, knock) there will be something else to do.  

Tonight, if I have the energy, I'm planning to go to Gamma.

Another question about full moon cops:  how were the raves in the UK organized
in the summer of 89?  I think they were completely word of mouth and that the
location was not even decided until a few hours before hand.  There were a
number of contact points to find out at that time.  From what I understand, the
police were even more ferocious there and then than here.

When the full moon raves started here last summer, the location was announced
via phone tree just a few hours before the rave.  The organizers (the Full Moon
Massive) would call a bunch of friends, who would then call their friends. 
Only when they started telling people a day or two early where it will or might
be did they start having problems.  The Massive is usually good about checking
out the place to see if it will get busted.  

One of the coolest and least suspect places it was held was in a picnic ground
behind Candlestick park by the water.  Isolated, centrally located, *tons* of
parking, and no security patrols between sundown and sunup.  Gina (sp?) from
the Massive stopped by the park office and asked if it was safe to jog at night
there.  The security officer said that she should get a big dog or a jogging
partner because there are NO SECURITY PATROLS AT NIGHT.  IF SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO YOU NOBODY WOULD SEE/HEAR/HELP YOU UNTIL MORNING!  

They had it there two or three times last summer, once planned and once or
twice after the primary location got busted.  The only problem was the
sprinkler system that popped up at 3:00 am in the middle of it all.  Actually,
it was kind of fun...  Ever take a shower on E?  Anyway, sorry to ramble on
again...

Share and enjoy,

Candlestick Park location is better. You _can't_ see it from the road, there are

It's my impression that one of the things that helps a rave get noticed by cops
is lights where there shouldn't be any at night.  A strobe on a beach in Marin
can be seen from the bridge, etc.  I don't think lights really help an outdoor
rave -- it's kinda fun just watching the stars and the moon.  Plus, it's one
more thing to carry when setting up or moving the rave in the case of a bust.

Anything that would attract attention is bad.  Like cars parked along the road.
Or music that can be heard by neighbors.  I bet that most of the raves are
busted by random cops who notice lights, or cars, or whatever, and just stop to
see what's going on.  Actually, at the East Bay FMR a cop stopped me walking
back to my car to ask what was going on.  I said "gee, there's some music up
there officer and people."  He looked around a bit and then left.  The rave
didn't get shut down for another 3 hours when some trucks couldn't get past.

Ramble and enjoy,

Tim

There's plenty of room to add files, too - if you want to add something,
put it in pub/incoming, and add a .sfr to the end of the filename. I'll
move whatever's there to the /sfraves directory... I haven't had the gumption
to assemble a FAQ file; I tried to make my welcome message as complete as
possible to answer any newbie questions, but I've still had requests for
a FAQ. If anybody would like to volunteer....

	Now that the calendar is FTP'able, if you have flyers you'd like 
on there you can download the calendar, add your info, and put it back up
in the /incoming directory. Every time I log in I'll look to see if a new
calendar version was put there, and if so copy it to the /sfraves file to

Subject: rave in GG park this *sunday*

sorry for the confusion on the date:  the GG park event is this sunday,
07 june, noon to sundown.  location is Marx Meadow.  looks like the DJs
will be Jan, Jeno, Garth, and Marie Mark.

afterward (starting at 9pm) is Soul Food - rave at 715 Harrison (@ 3rd).
DJs lined up are Dani, Garth, and Doc Martin.

on a different topic - i noticed something last saturday at Townsend.
the back room event (Blow Your Mind) seemed to attract a rather straight
crowd.  not surprising, because the front room event (Carefree) was
positioned from the start as a mainly-gay event, and is now being explicitly
promoted as gay.  not that anyone would be unwelcome in either place,
but it does seem to generate de facto segregation.

one of the things i like(d) best about the "scene" is its acceptance,
celebration even, of diversity.  i'm glad for all the events where i
can be comfortably, openly gay, and where my straight friends can come
too, without feeling out of place.

anyone else have any observations on rave diversity?

Subject: anatomy of a full moon bust - version 4


I also know the people that live at the house in Woodside where the May
Full Moon Rave occured.  It is my perspective that there were other
factors besides the alleged Highway Patrol vendetta & sfrave posting
that caused the FMR bust.

I arrived at 11:00PM, at that time the narrow road up to the house was
crowded with many parked cars but passable.  I saw no police on my way
in.  Shortly after midnight when the DJs began spinning on the outdoors
sound system is when one of the closest neighbors became irate.  He madly
complained that 50 people had already rang his doorbell, looking for the
party, and that the music was very loud.  I suppose he may have also
called the police? 

Other neighbors complained about trespassers, people cutting through the
woods to bypass the police.  One raver I met said a neighbor shined a
flashlight on her and tried a "citizens arrest", because she was 
trespassing...she escaped to the rave!

By 12:10AM there were 3 San Mateo Sheriff cars stationed at the bottom
of the driveway leading to the house, and others on Highway 84.  They
were turning people away, I know of one friend who arrived at 12:20AM
and was told "the partys over, Go Home!".  A noise complaint was recieved
from the cops.

*** I believe it was a combination of complaints from neighbors concerned
with noise and trespassers, plus traffic on Highway 84 (300 to 500 cars
converging on a Woodside house at midnight :) ), that was the cause of
the FMR bust and hassle.

*** Posting on sfraves the afternoon of the FMR may have added more people,
but I refuse to believe it was the cause of the bust!  Greater care
should be taken in the choice of location for future FMRs.

Problems aside, my friends and I had a fantastic unforgetable time that
morning.  Thanks and praises to our courageous friends in Woodside,
DJs Jeno, Garth & Markie Mark and all others that helped make the May
FMR happen...MAY THE FMR TRADITION CONTINUE!!!

Subject: Re: anatomy of a full moon bust

It seems to me that part of the problem you might be having is that, by 
associating your outdoor, night-time raving with something predictable, and
easily identifiable (ie. the full moon), nifty and cosmic though that is,
you make things easier for the cops to know when to expect doings.

I think resynching to some other portion of the lunar cycle, as was suggested
(ie. the new moon) won't improve things beyond the first time or two.  My
recommendation from out here in the ozone:  Avoid cycles altogether.

Why not confuse the oinkers by being so random in space *and* time that they
simply can't afford to be that vigilant?

Throw the I Ching.  Use successive letters in a particular page of the 
telephone book, or read from the warning label on a can of Raid.  Schedule
based on the score of Pierrot Lunaire.  I mean, really, you can easily come up
with scheduling mechanisms so far out that the fuzzy ones could never 
comprehend them, as well as being so cool and appropriate that the sfravers
could all figure them out.

'Sides, the moon should be appreciated throughout her *entire* cycle, no?

Umm, there's a world of difference between the police busting up
parties and them planning extensive operations to prevent them
in the first place.  I would be suprised if any police organizations
in the area have enough free time to waste watching sfraves to 
know what's going on before it happens...

[I'm newer at this than most, so if anyone has good evidence to
the contrary (not paranoia) I'll listen... but that seems sorta
silly.  It would look dumb in the papers and TV if a report showing
how many manhours were spent closely watching sfraves came out... 8-)
which could easily be arrainged if it was actually occuring. ]

As a recent graduate of the ever-popular traffic school, I'm in a
position to offer some enlightenment about "highways".  *Technically*,
a highway is defined in the CA vehicle code as all public roads of any
kind.  That's right, the street you live on is a highway, unless
private.  And while the jursidiction of the CHP is primarily highways,
it can even extend into private land in certain situations.  The reason
you tend to see the CHP most often on freeways is probably because
other (more local) police are already patrolling other highways that
fall under their local jurisdiction and the CHP is most needed on
freeways.  Only the CHP can cruise for a while on a freeway without
leaving their jurisdiction.


Hey, the dictionary even agrees with the vehicle code:

  dictionary-> highway
     high.way n  \'hi-.wa\
	: a public road or way; esp : a main direct road

People just tend to think of it as only the "esp" (especially)
meaning.

  Following up on R Jesse's thoughtful post:
  It does seem as though ravers are tolerant with regards to race, gender, 
preference, etc.  There does seem to be some prejudice -- sometimes latent, 
sometimes explicit -- against "bridge and tunnel" people, and in general against"outsiders" (whoever they might be) who are "intruding" into the rave scene. This may be nothing more than nostalgia for the earlier days when raves were
smaller, or more select.  But if the net effect is resentment that some types
of folks -- Joe Lawyer and Jane Realestate -- are showing up at raves, doesn't
this constitute a kind of intolerance?

I found myself there at ~3:30.  All the people I saw were great!  It
was a very mixed crowd (white, black, gay, straight/bi?), and all in
the `right' i.e. communally good mood.  People were trickling out and
there were plenty inside still.  When I got there the ground floor
level was a very nice setup ambient wise, and everyone was being told
to go upstairs, so that I did and we had a blast (all of us up there I
think) to whatever DJ was spinning then until about 4:20 or so.  It
was great.

I needed to get an orange from my car, but found out instead I was
TRAPPED!  So, I >had< to dance for the rest of the time there ... fun!

At one point I was wandering around to find a place to dance and see
who else was around (you can do both at once at this place since it's
laid out non-boxy) when I realized I couldn't see anything at all and
that there were people within two feet of me dancing!  The fog machine
was put on FULL blast, and the whole room was this neat mystery dance
spot -- dancing in the fog was really fun for me (I happen to like
that kind of fog).  It cleared soon enough (5 minutes later ...) for
me to see all the happy boys and girls, continue dancing and stuff.

(Was it good earlier?  I heard it was $10 -- that's a lot of money to
pay, but for those where money is no object (who?) this is likely
worth it.  My prior mood before attending: good, fed, not very tired,
calm city driving (Biases may apply.))

Although some of the FMR ideas mentioned will or might work, let's not
get to far away from tradition.  The roots should hold strong.  We
shouldn't have to change to a different moon cycle or get "legal".  
Fuck them.  The ideas that do sound realy good (to me, anyway) are:
New and improved locations.  Later anouncements.  Requesting Ameba not
give dirs. over the phone.  CARPOOLING (less cars and a good idea anyway).
The mail someone wrote about lights (or lack of) made good sense.  Map point(s).
Before we go organizing our own FMR:
1. Are we SURE the organizers aren't holding one this time?
2. Can we get their "blessing" and possibly help if even one or two
   of them are in town.

I'd like to see this happen.  The Bonny Dune location in Santa Cruz might
work but I seem to remember that the only parking is on the side of the
highway and what are the chances of a certain loveable farm animal not
running by in an 8 hour stretch?  This loc. is far but I don't think too
far.  An hour?  Hour and 1/2?  Might also help discourage some people
from attending.  Good?  Bad?

    Of course the 21 Jump Street thing is true, there were undercover
police officers in my school that posed as students and befriended people
so they could bust them.  Its about the worst kind of cop there is, they
get you to trust them and then they lock you away. At one highschool they
found out who was the police narc and the kids killed him and there were no
witnesses.  So if you are the evil one out there, beware.  Just kidding,

I think the ethnic and gender diversity factor contributes a lot to the
atmosphere at raves.  For me anyway, there's a kind of diffuse sensuality
that's *enhanced* when there's more people touching each other for whatever 
reason.  I thought CareFree was great the time that it got a infusion of
folks from shut-down Equinox on May 2.  Besides, there's something about
having some flamboyant dragsters in the house that livens up the visual
aspect of any party, esp. one where it's a bit too loud to talk much !-). 
I'm not real familiar with the more gay-oriented rave events; perhaps there's 
an anti-hetero vibe that I've not experienced.  

As for those ever-present B & T people, well, if some people can't hang with 
the idea of multiply-gender-preference'd event, maybe they *do* belong 
elsewhere.  Could it be, though,  that homophobes behave best when they're in a 
minority, and might tend to outgrow their little social handicap if they have
a good time?

Bonny Dune is a good place for a midnight activity, for a lot of
reasons.  Just don't park in the parking lot directly outside
(the sherrif's dpt tickets it for cars there after 10:00pm).
We've had large, loud parties out there before (including some
impressive fireworks etc., so sorta comperable to a loud music setup).
The police that ticketed the cars never came out onto the
beach to bother anyone, though, so unless it's way way loud
no problem.

The beach itself is over a hill from the road, and nobody's house
or business can see it.  Great location for not bothering anyone
if you party way late, loudly.

The incorrect assumption behind this idea (and with the telephone-only idea
and with the map point idea) is assuming that you can get 500 people to meet
in one place without having the cops find out about it.  No amount of secrecy
on the part of the first 499 people will do any good if the 500th person

Subject: FMR info, purpose, laywers, spies...


Just thought I'd condense my three days of 2 cents worths, for a total
of six sense (sp intentional; in fact, all misspellings and gramar
errors are on purpose.  Yeah!)
   1) Not giving info on FMRs over the phone is unfair to folks who live
far away or work days, etc, etc.  We're not all students (see below).
Also, I always thought that FMRs were on the FM not for lighting, but
for pagan reasons.  At least I'd like to think so O^).
   2) So some of us are out of school and ARE NOT SLACKERS (well, I guess
I am since I work at SLAC, but...).  Some of us are fortunate enough to
have jobs where we can look how we wish, others are not so lucky.
Don't think that Joe Lawyer and Jane Real-Estate are not 'with it'
just because of their jobs.  So if Robert Anton Wilson looked like
Quayle he'd be less cool?  Let's not advocate that.
   3)  Spying is an unfortunate possible reality.  I went to grad school
at Kent State University in Ohio, where the National Guard Shot at students
in 1970, injuring 11 and killing four (4 dead in O-hi-o, I hate that song).
Anyway, the SDS (students for a demcratice society, one of the first '60s
student political groups) and the violent splinter group The Weathermen
both started at Kent, and both were heavily spyed upon.  When I lived there
I knew several ex-members who believed they were still being watched.
Anyway,  What I want to say is: be conscience of spies, but don't become
overly paraniod else you will get innocent scapegoats, like the military
and the CIA with gays and people who hold 'different' political beliefs.
We're better than that, I hope.
   We should do our best to make it difficult to spy, but let's not do

Did you know about the great Floppy's that was conducted three stories
up in a warehouse recently?  Cops never seemed to know (since the
sound doesn't seem to travel out & down to the street the same way as
if it were at ground level).  The main entrance was so inconspicuous I
hardly knew I was going the right way until I got there.

Subject: Encryping sfraves ...

A couple of thoughts on this thread. The first message re: the FMR in San
Mateo getting busted did not target this mail list, but rather some "network" in
the chain to someone who put it out over the radio. They did not say it
was KALX and could have been KUSF. Brian's weekly list has been
showing up on SF NET, I believe posted by someone at Cyberden. 
It's also very unlikely someone on this list is giving out info to the CHP. 
And if they are, if we start encrypting stuff how are we to determine who's 
going to get keys. If the only way to get keys is by seeing an SFR button at
a rave, then it's going to take forever as I've only seen maybe two or
three SFR buttons in the past two months and I've been to maybe 20 raves
in that time period.

Subject: Encrypting sfraves ..


	After much deliberation, I am against encrypting the FMR posts.
The point of raves is to break down the social barriers people raise to
protect themselves. Creating a "subclique" within sfraves would hurt
this... and no matter how elaborate your coding, if the cops are
determined to find it they're going to find out about it, sfraves or
not. If there is indeed a narc on the list, which I highly doubt 
(c'mon, I hope cops have something better to do than peruse 10 messages
a day about how many people had sex at a rave :)  Brad's comment about
simply posting it later, like around 10 or 11, is the best; those of
you without I-net access from home, maybe you can form a phone tree
or something, with one of us homeloginphreaks at the top. That, in
combination with maybe reintroducing the concept of the map point
(and preferably FAR away from the site, so the cops couldn't simply
follow the trail of cars to the site, and maybe with a limited number
of maps, so as to limit attendance) would almost ensure that the cops
wouldn't find out about it ahead of time, and would have a harder time
finding it out the day of the event. I especially like the
limited-map idea; again, I hate to be cliquey, but more than 500 people
will make the location obvious no matter where it is. Hell, I'd even
OFFER to be the map point, since the maps would probably go quickly and
I could get there by, say, 2 or 3 and still dance until sunrise...

	Also, it looks like we won't be having an SFR FMR (not this time, at least)
but we should try to get SOMETHING going this summer....

	Finally, has anyone heard anything about any events on the Equinox?
(June 19-21)? When Psychic TV were in studio at KALX, Mr. Floppy was
there (yes, he really exists), and he mentioned something about having a
tract of land donated to him for that weekend up in Napa, and they were 
thinking about some free or ultra-cheap rave up there for the weekend.
Maybe we should invite the KLF... (oh, wait, they've disbanded, huh?)

	Finally2 - anyone in LA want to go to Camp Snoopy next week?

     Its a nice beach  for parties but
as you  menti^oned cars are vulnerable,
towing  by the  cops  is not unheard of
and vanalism is common. The beach     
itself is inaccesable as far as loading

Greetings from someone new to this list...

Not new to raves, though, been hardcore for about 8 months now.
Anyways, I don't think I saw mention of these two raves on the list;
excuse the bandwidth if they were already announced.

1) San Francisco: (from the flyer)
Midnight Saturday June 6th
to Sunday Morning June 7th

Todd Terry
Jeno  Markie Mark

King St. @ 3rd

2) Santa Clara: (haven't seen the flyer, only heard second hand)
A Rave Called Sharon
Probably at One Step Beyond, Martin St.
You could call for directions and information, I suppose.

About the first; my only complaint is mostly personal preference: The
DJ who will be playing, Todd Terry, played mostly House house, as
opposed to the techno that I like; when I asked who he was, someone
said he has supposedly "recorded probably 10% of all house music ever
recorded, dude!".  Whatever, I didn't much like him.  But anyways,
this looks like one of the only games in town tonight, the flyers look
like they might have been done quickly since there wasn't a whole lot
else happening, could be fun.

We went last night to Liquid, at 177 Townsend,
since there was nothing else advertised.  Mixed crowd, some of the
core that I recognized, some of the suburban crowd.  The energy
got better and better as the night went on, as the crowd thinned
out.  They have a hell of a sound system and that awesome laser
drawing 3-D pyramids and all.

Have fun.

I have a lot to say about encryption.  Especially about the government
involvement in the encryption thing.  In fact, I have so much to say about
that that I don't want to waste bandwidth by saying it here.  Send me
personal mail for more info.

But about encryption:  I was not planning on writing my own encryptor from
scratch.  I will use a publicly available one, with some exciting new
twists.  Even if we decide not to use it for fmrs, it will still be useful
for us.  And it will be safe, maybe even from the federal government (I
won't name the specific agency here).

girls, he tells the STUPIDEST girls where stuff is!!!!]  anyway, Ameba and

re DJz...  yes on the Hardkisses, also, we could try for Markie Mark, I've
never heard him do a bad set.  

re lighting...  let's rent a bubble machine!  They're cheap and make great

oh yeah, I'd also LOVE to hear DJ Carlos [who played at creation - he was

There seems to be an understandably increasing level of paranoia creeping in
here.  While it is true that the police are certainly capable of monitoring
here, and could cause some annoyances if they did, I would be surprised if
we are really getting much hassle from that imaginary source.  The cops have
lots of fun projects to watch which leaves little time or resources to check
the net.  Also, as a rule hereabouts, the police generally do just that:
they police.  If we keep selves relatively quiet and relatively out of the
way, unless we do something _really_ heinous or illegal, we usually get left
to our own devices.  And my experience of this crowd has generally been one
of law abiding normalcy, albeit with a fondness for gentle cultural
subversion.

If we start doubting each other or the efficacy of our chosen communication
(the net and SFRaves), we will have done to ourselves far worse than the
gestapo can do: divide and conquer.  NOT A FLAME at don by the way - I think
he makes a legit point, but it may not be necessary to start the inquisition

Subject: Sharon met Destiny

Finally, a fulfilling rave thrown in the traditionally arid rave
deserts of the South Bay. Once again the location was the once-mod/goth
turned Omni/Stone thrasher club, One Step Beyond.  Why the affinity
for raves at this location, and what's more, in the morbid confines
of 1400 Martin Ave. is indeed curious.  Nonetheless, I coughed up the
now standard $15 at the door while managing to wince in either pain
or sympathy for the under 18 crowd as they gurggled up $18.  Yet, once
inside, memories of dollars adrift in the swelling banks of fly-by-night
rave promoters quickly subsided.  I guess walking into 2 Bad Mice has
such an effect.  This song came out a year ago and it allready feels
like the "Free Bird" of my generation.  Scary, perhaps, Lynard Skynard
I mean.  Various degrees of facial hair separated one d.j from the next
as I paused and looked at my fellow ravers and asked "who the hell is
this?"  Mute glances of shared bemusement followed. Was that Afrika
Bambattaa's "searching for a perfect beat" at 2am?  Shivers. Shivers.
This was excellent until some wall ornament passes me a note with a sign
"no whistles." What the hell is with this? Petty censorship. The flyer
for the Sharon this Saturday bears similar note.  Anyhow, the message
was apparently not heeded as the sounds of thunderous bass and impromtu
whistling kept gyrating in my mind for the next three hours.  As d.j


techo began to take root, finally, around 3, the most rousing crowd
reaction to Bobby Konder's "nervous acid" broke forth.  Orgiasmic levels
were indeed noted.  I bailed before five as I began to nauseate to 
continued mixes of acid-house and jazz, hopped in my car two miles back
to Santa Clara University, home of the Jesuit, home of the ecstasy
deprived, paused to look at my hallmates, was about to say something,
beer cans, open textbooks - "nah." Lets keep it this way

Steve B. made some excellent comments with which I agree.  Our
greatest enemy can be ourselves if we let irrational fears guide us.
Actually, I think there is a lot of power in realizing this and living
without being controlled or influenced by irrational fears (e.g. doing
what one might fear).


I think it'd be really neat to organize a rave from here (the sfraves
list).  The full moon - I don't know which night it's closest to, but
it's marked on my calendar for the 15th (someone said the 14th was the
night it's closest to, a Sunday).  Six days -- talk about short
notice, this one will >have< to have short notice if we pull it off!
(Finally something where short notice is good.)


The rest of my post here is a little bit nitpicky, sorry for the tone:

" SFR are both less "guilty" of crowding the last FMR than whoever
" told all the highschoolers about it earlier that day.  There were
" highschoolers coming into Ameba all day with the address saying "is
" this the right address for the full moon party?"  That one just got
" out.

I think this quote from someone I know who was telling about a dozen
people what we can do that weekend exemplifies the reason why
teenagers are interested in going to FMRs (besides being funny because
of its logic):

  "We can't go to any of the bars, but we can go to a Full Moon Rave
   since they're illegal."

I like seeing teenagers able to have this sort of night fun.  As
someone who is young, somehow I haven't gotten into any sort of
anti-teenager trip, despite their increased ignorance, decreased
financial abilities (hah!  ma&pa have more $ than I do!) and etc.  I
had fun at One Step Beyond one night just seeing the mixture of the
crowd, which included many many under-18 creatures.

It would have been nice if the "highschoolers" weren't told so soon
about the last FMR, though, that is true.  But some amount of leakage
is always to be expected -- how many organizers can you keep in the
dark (how many times have you heard, before a good rave, "I'm doing X
for that rave and I don't even know where it is!" where X is an
organizing role that person has to fulfill (besides the obvious!)

So what do the rest of you think about organizing a full moon rave
this coming Sunday night June?  All we need is (everything)
   1) location 
   2) dj's
   3) speakers &  dj equipment
   4) generator

Kind of similar to the sfraves picnic except there won't be edibles
and it probably won't have permission from the owners of the land with
such short notice.  (I'll see about that if someone commits their dj
equipment for that night.)  I talked to quite a few people about this at the
park on Sunday (which was a blast by the way) and they
all were very enthusiastic about it.  Bonnie Dune or a neighboring
beach sounds like a good location if someone has had a party there
without it getting busted.  I've also scoped out a pretty desolate
beach 20min north of Santa Cruz.  To prevent a parking lot forming on the road
nearby I'll look for a parking area that we can shuttle people to and
from. 
Does anyone know any dj's who want to play?  Does anyone know
where we can get a generator?  Who had one for sfraves picnic?
What about the turntables, wires, etc.?  

I want to do my best to get one going this sunday eve.  So if any of you
can help send email to sfraves for discussion.  I'm even willing to
shell out some initial bucks and maybe we can break even with
donations.  I can get a few dj's for this providing we have a location
and equipment.  So basically, I'm waiting for you ravers out there
with some equipment (generator, speakers, turntables & dj equip) to
email in your thoughts, before you or I can ask any dj's.  

What do you think?  Shall we get this thing going?  We've got 5
days to plan. tick.. tock... tick ... tock... ti.  So far, it seems
like the hurdle is equipment.

Bonny Doon (or, at least, Bonny Doon Beach and Bonny Doon Road)
are already 10min north of Santa Cruz, so I think that the location
has been narrowed down sufficiently (if those are the only choices ;-)
BTW, I've had a few parties on those beaches without ever getting
oppressed by the authorities.  Of course, nothing along the lines 
or scope of a FMR.

I live in Bonny Doon, so I'd be happy to coordinate some of the details
that need to be arranged here.    I'll do some more beach scoping-out,
and search for a parking area near the location.  If nothing else,
we can always park cars near my house.    We live on 6 acres, and our
neighbors all have 40-acre lots, so many cars could conceivably
be parked here without alerting and/or pissing people off.  Still,
a closer parking site would be better, as I'm 10 minutes inland from Bonny
Doon Beach.  (can't have the rave on our property, by the way, as
our landlords who also live on the property would never approve).

Just a thought:

First FMR blames SFR for their busted rave, then SFR does the next full moon
rave.  Will they think that SFR is trying to take over?
Also, if we do have a rave on the full moon, will it be called Full Moon Rave?
How would the FMR organizers feel when someone is using their idea?

These are things that make you go Uhmmmmmm? (Is that how you spell it?)

6/16 @ the Kennel Club -- Crash Worship -- $5.00

This is a tribal performance thang that causes half the folks in the
audience to get nekkid and go crazy.  Drum fu.  Pyromaniac smoke and
fire-flash fu.  Dangerous objects aflame and swingin' on a rope fu. illegal
use of fire-hydrant fu. two dozen breasts. 10 burning chalices, and a
partrige in a pear tree.  slippery slidy squamous grunge fu. sweaty
painted-body fu.  Loud enough to get-your-genital-piercings-to-resonate-
pleasurably fu.  Drive-in awards go to this anarchic assemblage of
musicians and tribaloids.  For christians this'll be a (literally)
sulfurous fire&brimstone decent into hell; for the rest of us, this is the
kind of shit that makes life worth living.  Niels-bob sez check it out.

PS: someone tell me how the Leo Nocentelli/Russell Batiste show 6/13 at
Last Day Salloon goes. I'll be outta town, but I really really wish I could
go see this show -- FYI this is half of 'The Meters', the folks that
*INVENTED* New Orleans funk ('67-'74) that later spun off the Neville
Brothers and whose best grooves/riffs/songs got ripped off by the Grateful
Dead. What's this have to do with raving? Maybe you had to be at the last
Bay Area 'Meters' show (3 years ago) and been part of the throbbing
communal dance experience that occured there. I make no promises that this
show will be able to recreate that energy since Art Neville (keyboards) and
George Porter (bass) will be missing.

PPS: So how was Nusrat Khan? I couldn't scrounge comps, the $25-$75 tix
were too expensive and would cause the crowd to be the kind of people I
don't like spending time with (you know, the whine-and-cheeze set).

	Legitimate point, but:

1) I don't think they blame SFR for the busted rave; while we may have been
responsible for a lot of people knowing about it, the location almost 
guaranteed trouble, and normals@well.sf.ca.us says Ameba was giving directions 
away left and right to anyone who wanted to know... 

2) They aren't doing one this month anyways; hopefully they'll see it as 
"carrying on a tradition" rather than trying to take over.

3) I only want this to happen with their knowlege and consent. And maybe
even participation....

4) We're not planning on holding competing events in the following months.
We'll be behind the Full Moon Massive all the way.

Taxi here,

Since I've got a day job, I can't go around checking if we can rent
a generator.  We still need speakers and dj equip.  Is the person who
took care of that for the sfraves picnic off for the summer?  If not,
can you tell me how you got it?

I'm going to ask a friend if we can use his speakers and turntables
and dj equip.  If he says yes, then all we have to take care of is,

1) generator. (can we use someone's OR should we rent?)
2) speakers, dj equip if my friend says, no.

I'm getting a phone installed today, and I'll post my phone number
tomorrow.  If anyone wants to get in touch with me, just call.  Or send
email to sfraves, (but not to me - it will bounce back to you).
Leave your phone number on my answering machine so we can discuss
plans.  

Does anyone know what else is going on this Sunday June 14th?  I know
there's going to be another thing at GG park during the daytime which
will be good to spread the word, IF WE CAN GET EVERYTHING TOGETHER
SOON.  I guess what I'm looking for are commitments from people
regarding the generator and speakers and dj equipment (2 turntables,
amp, mixer, equilizer).  PLease don't spread the word about this until Sunday -
and then ONLY IF WE CAN GET EVERYTHING TOGETHER.  Don't tell any
college radio dj's about the existence of this rave, don't post info.
about this to any other network, don't tell too many high school
students -- we don't want this to turn into a high school dance.  I
know that there are some high school students on sfraves, so if you
want to keep the atmosphere at this rave similar to the one that existed at
Grey Whale Cove, keep silent about this.

Ok the sfraves FMR wheels are rolling.  The date has been re-scheduled
for this coming Monday.  Sunday night will clash with Preston's Soul
Food, the new Bowel movement and also Mission Rock.  So Monday sounds
like a better time.  Plus we won't have to compete for dj's if we hold
it on Monday.  The Full Moon Massive is being consulted on what they
think about this whole thing.  Word of mouth teasers will be spread on
Sunday at the park and exact location will be given on Monday via the
regular Full Moon channels, (we're consulting some people about that too).

Remember all this is REALLY tentative.  Name dj's cost $50-$70 an hour
and if we go from midnight-7am that's $350-$500 just for dj's alone,
unless some of you can get them to play for free.  

Let's keep location talk about this Full Moon off sfraves.

In my opinion, the major contributing factor was the simple fact that
hundreds of people/cars descended on woodside around midnight asking
store owners, gas station attendents, locals et al. where glenview dr
or whatever the street name was.  This kind of "highly unusual"
behavior is bound to alert the authorities.  I remember thinking this the
night of the FMR.  It would have been better to give out DETAILED instructions
to the exact location, then people would not have to ask any of the locals.
It seems that a neighbor called the police when folks kept comming up his/her 
driveway.  I think if your going to have a rave in a place like that, you
want everybody to get in rapidly without drawing undue attention to yourselves.

Ok, well, IRC==Internet Relay Chat.  It's a mega-user chat system.  To
access it you can either get the client and compile it on your own
machine or you can telnet to bradenville.andrew.cmu.edu to check it
out.

On the chat board, you can have different subs.  I was proposing the
idea that we name our board SFR.  Mind you, it's not a permanent
subboard, but it gets created each time.

So, how's that sound?  What would be a good time for people to log
into that?

One must remember, however, that you do need internet access,
specifically, being able to telnet to a different place, so I don't
think the people on the Well could use it.  I'm sure netcom.com users
are able to telnet...

Any other questions, please feel free to ask!

I think dancing at raves is more a release of energy than an art in
itself.  Dancing at raves seems to be more about free expression and
positive attitudes and high energy, not a carefully developed (and
hence less spontaneous) choreography, sort of like how punk is to more
"refined" musics.  If we say that raves are about community, we could
theorize that ravers are trying to accept everyone who has the spirit,
and are not trying to critique dance skills and make too many
judgments that way.  (Although I might be reaching here...)

Also, I think our generation doesn't really have much of a real dance
style, except maybe from hiphop culture; it seems like past
generations had popular dance styles (from ballroom dancing to yer
Jitterbug and the like, and then the Hustle :-), now it seems like
everyone does their own thing.  I haven't seen any rave dance classes :)

Subject: Understanding Your Local Fuzz

The simplest way to explain how cops work is to look at the job
description: "LAW ENFORCER". Now there are about 750 bzillion laws
that the cops COULD enforce.

Which ones are the cops going to enforce? Unsurprisingly, they are
going to bust the people that are disrupting their karmic movie of
total peace and undisturbed control through threatened violence.

Remember that although a cop might back down from busting an "honest
citizen" who isn't posing a threat and sincerely asking for a break,
no cop is going to lose face in front of the general populace -- thus,
if there are neighbor complaints, you will have hassles.

Thus: in order not to get busted, you must not disturb the cops. You
can take this on in several ways: visible compliance, invisible
non-compliance, or invisible complicity.

There is another possibility, of course, which is described in detail
in the Hunter Thompson chestnut "Hell's Angels" (recommended). That is
to simply out-muscle them. On the other hand, this is not going to
happen at a rave-like scene.

	I agree, most ravers aren't good dancers; but I think the dancing
we do is much more tribal, much more cathartic, than most other kinds of
dancing. I also don't think that it matters how you dance; if you look like
you're having a good time, that's the most important. I personally like
the fact that there's no real "dance" associated with rave culture; I
don't have to learn how to spin on my head or waltz perfectly to be a
part of the event. 

	I saw a sneak preview last night for a new movie, the title escapes
me, about "swing kids" in germany in the 30's - kids who refused to be enlisted
in Hitler's youth programs and instead were really into swing music. The "swing
scene" in Germany consisted of clubs who would secretly hold swing parties,
plying the likes of Duke Ellington, Count Basie, etc., and then at some point 
a guy would come running in, yell to the band leader to stop, the band would
switch the German polka music, all this right before a dozen cops would
come storming into the place. All the "swing kids", who up to this point were
doing wildly erotic and physically demanding dance steps, would suddenly start 
waltzing, and the cops would be forced to conclude that there was nothing
"immoral" going on. The symmetry between this and the rave scene was really
funny - complete with secret ways of finding out locations for "tonight's
event", special clothes, huge record collections, etc. The only part that
didn't jive: imagine cops getting ready to bust an event, so the organizers
decide to start playing new age music, thus defeating the cops :):):):)

	I think it was called "Swing Kids". 

	So when's the first movie about ravers coming out?

Rather than post a few replies, let me group them all together:

Dan:  ComeUnity is Tuesday nights at 1015 Folsom@6th.  It happens about once a
month, usually the first Tuesday.  ComeUnity was weekly last spring/summer, but
was discontinued in the fall/winter.  It was recently resurrected in it's
current form.  Definitely a fun one.  DJs are usually Jeno, Garth, and Ernie
Munson.

IRC/Chat/FTP/telnet/encryption/netnews:  At least a few of us work for private
corporations who remain wary of internet access apart from mail.  Here at
Oracle, outgoing telnet and ftp is nearly impossible and a number of newsgroups
are not received (in particular alt.rave).  I would very much like to see no
encryption and no dissemination of information through channels other than the
list.  (Phone tree for the FMR excepted.)  I hope Brian continues to mail out
the weekly list for those of us who don't have ftp access or the time for ftp
retrieval.

FMR:  Sounds fun!  Remind me to clear my calendar for Tuesday... :-)

GG Park:  As Preston's first park raves were fun, so was the latest!!  I can't
wait for the next one.  Is it really on the 14th?  Definitely fun seeing y'all
there.

Dancing styles:  To me, practicing dance moves and evaluating dance styles is
anathema to the rave mentality.  The idea is to get out there and do what comes
naturally.  If practiced dance moves (can you say "moonwalk"?) come naturally
to you, great!  But for a lot of rave kids, dancing is just the physical
embodiment of the energy and joy of the moment!  To say that rave kids aren't
good dancers is to subsribe to the mob mentality that anything that doesn't
conform is bad.  Why be normal?

And last, but certainly not least, what the hell is Bowel Movement??

What is meant by good dancing?  I'm not quite ancient but speaking for 
one who has been dancing since about the age of three (I'm 26 now) I 
always considered 'good' dancing simply to be keeping the beat and 
feeling the music-- sort of a spiritual commune.  I'm sure you've heard 
"do your own thang"  I observe most people to be having a great time and 
attuned to the music.  Choreography is a good thing, on one hand, but 
freestyling is the penultimate, Baby!!
	Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to flame(?) just expressing my
point of view on this.  As far as practicing, I really don't know anyone 
who actually practices at home but I know quite a few people (myself in-
cluded) who just can't stop bouncing, bopping, etc. whenever that 'moozac"
is heard.  
	Well, that ends my tirade on the subject.  Let's hear from some

I agree with Peter Morris about dancing at raves.  It's not necessary to be 
choreographed at these events.  If the event is a "true rave" (I'll probably
get flamed for that statement but what da hell!  It'll go to /dev/null 
anyhow! :) ), then everyone is trying to reach a different spiritual level
through dancing.

At commercial raves as ToonTown, the Vibe, et al, dancing may be a bit more
"choreographed" as they say, since at these clubs, it's more or less a
"meat market".  I'm going to abstain from using the term "Bridge & Tunnel"
crowd since the physical description (gel-ed up hair, occasional attitude,
etc) somewhat offends me since I usually look that way, too (just ask Jai!),
but you'll never find me at a "commercial rave" since I believe that it's
the spiritual-ness, the aura, the commune of ravers that attract me, not
the meat market.

Hmm...I've seemed to stray from the point...oh well...back to dancing...
Dancing at raves is just to reach that other level...doesn't have to be
a set dance routine or whatever...

I actually find 'rave' music dancing to be very difficult.  The beat is so
insistent, yet simplistic, that it's difficult to do any sort of interesting

That wandering DeadHead joke is no mere coincidence, I don't think;
the first thing I thot when I was exposed to raving was "Snake dancing
lives!"  _Why_ is left to your imagination.

Actually I have seen some dancers doing things that remind me of early
disco (before it was called that), before the '70's movies & hype
turned it into a commercial craze (beware, brethren & sistren)
complete with choreography & dance instructors.  I guess it depends on
the dancer's mood & athletic prowess (& sense of balance at 5 am).

Other musical eras have had dance styles that went with them but what
was often true about those dance styles is that they were focussed on
couples or small groups dancing together.  Not "dancing" "together"
but "dancing-together".  There's usually some kind of organization or
choreography to that, varying from rigid organization to nominal, but
there has to be something to keep you off ea other's feet.

We could invent a new style, yes?  A little voodoo, a little ceilidh or
Morris, a little West African, a wave of snake dancing ....  Feel free.

I agree with the general sentiment going around.  When I am at a rave
in the midst of all that explosive energy, the last thing that I want
to do is a predetermined sequence of steps, or worse, to be judged by other
people on the quality of my moves.  I much prefer to let my body just
take off and do what it wants.

I do enjoy watching 'slick' dance moves; they are visually appealing,
but I don't think of a rave as a dance performance.  People are
expressing energy through motion.  That energy is very chaotic and
thus the natural motion is chaotic and appears unpracticed.

Peace,

One reason some ravers can't dance is because they`ve been dancing
for hours .  Let's see how a rock-n-roller or a

This reminds me.  A lot of the old "couples dances" were meant to get
men and women into each others arms.  Since the sexual repression of
the day meant that you couldn't be alone in each others arms outside
of a group, you needed to work it into some sort of socially approved
scene.  The tango had a reputation as a dance of unbridled passion.
Nowadays we might sneer at that, given that there aren't too many
social pressures keeping boys 'n' girls apart, but you have to
remember how it was at the time.

Well, comming from a point of view of

1) Being a person who LOVES to dance.
2) Growing up in the Brooklyn ghetto where dancing is beyond being an art form
but a way of life.
3) Living through the 60s, 70s and 80s and going to everything from grateful
dead shows to led zepplin concerts to breakdance contest at the Roxy not
to mention "house" parties (the kind that your homie or girl from around the 
way throw, not the kind at townsend :)

I would say the following:

1) The most important and by far the primary thing (for me at least) is that
you let the music TAKE YOU to that SPECIAL PLACE and your body does what comes
natural or what is inevitable, every true dancer knows this is whats important
whether you practice a move or not is another matter.  When I go to a rave
if the music is good I will go into an estatic frenzy (with or without e).
You reach this orgasmic point which is very physical and very spiritual
at the same instant.

2) I personally could make a border line rascist comment about how 
most white people can't dance but I won't :) and In fact, of all the places
and parties that I have been too where whites have been in numbers it is only
at raves that I have seen people REALLY THROW DOWN and let loose!
That's one of the reasons I go to raves and not Nirvana or Greatful Dead concerts.

After much deliberation, I find it difficult to argue with you,
Brian.  But then I'm not really trying very hard.

Um, as I was like so totally UNPOPULAR in high school, etc., it
would never be my intention to create a "subclique."  yuck.
I was hoping that getting/using the key would be a very simple/
minor thing.  I can see that perhaps it is more complex than
I originally thought.  so, skip encryption.  I'll just
continue to indulge myself in it as a hobby.  And when I 
get it ALL figured out, I'll decrypt it for anyone who says please.

sorry this is so lengthy.  suffice it to say I've been convinced
by the discussion that encryption is not THE ANSWER.  as far I'm 
concerned, it's been an interesting discussion.

Taxi here,

I'm not gonna do the FMR this monday.  I've been trying to get in
touch with the Full Moon Massive and I can't seem to meet up with
them.  I've heard all kinds of rumors that they might be having one,
and also that they for sure won't have one, and also that this month
they're just gonna help out Malaky do his thing.  I can't tell what
the hell they're up to and I'm not gonna organize a FMR if I don't
have their blessings.  So I'm canning it.

But since a general area has been scoped out, I was thinking of
holding a daytime beach party on some upcoming Saturday for sfravers at
some beach down south.  Maybe just get a bunch of sfravers and their
friends and any ravers who want to come and hold a little gathering
with maybe just one powerful loud boom box
providing the music.  That way, it'll be legal, there'll be house
music, no dj's to worry about, and it'll be like a beach picnic.  Not
too big, not too small, no official rave competiton, no pigs to worry
about.  The only thing we'd have to worry about is how much sunscreen
to put on our faces, and which watermelon to cut open, and who hit the
sunbathing ravers with the paddleball :-)
And if everyone brings their beach toys eg. frisbee, paddleball,
beachballs, waterpistols, shovels & pails, oceanliners, then we could
have a real blast.  I personally can only make it either this Saturday
or any Saturday in July onwards, but that shouldn't stop you guys from
holding it on any given day.

Does this sound good to you guys??  Write in with your ideas.

 This is what attracted me to raves - the freedom to dance in accordance to
the way that your body/mind was played by the music, and not in comformity to
a dance style. I found a version of this same freedom at Greaful Dead shows,
where free style/freaky dancing is either ignored, attributed to "doses, man",
or actively participated in.

 As far as my personal rave dance style is concerned, it's an uninhibited
version of club dancing that I used to do, and the same style I use at Greatful
Dead shows. My legs and lower body "keep the beat", while my upper torso and
arms are busy interpreting the other stuff - and techno has a lot of "other
stuff" to keep me happy! ( Over the years, I've gotten some strange looks
from a few of my partners, who were trying to figure out what 'dance' I was
doing ! ).

 By the way, I've seen trance-dancing Deadheads who would spin in a circle
while fluttering their hands in front of their eyes, their hands moving such
that the fingers were causing strobe-effects. I guess there are enough strobes
at raves to make that unneccessary!

             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                         |-  Geoff, if you ever go to a GD show again, don't
stay in the seats! Shoreline is especially good for seeing the trance-dancers in action, up in the lawn area walkway. Indoor GD concerts find them behind the
soundboard and in the hallways. 

 I do agree that, in general, rock shows are attended by too many people who
are too "cool" to be 'out of control' !  Always made no sense to me ...

Ditto for me, too, providing that I'm already in the area.
I suppose the people who would offer to DJ would bring their own records?

It's pretty neat when you got lots 'o different DJs...a showcase, so
to speak...you can check out each person's style of music selection,

AHA! I didn't want to say this!! My girlfriend also grew up in Brooklyn, 
Downtown and Park Slope, and remembers the good old days of Dancing at
the Tunnel to some old Chicago house with sweat dripping from the walls and
not leaving till morning.. She is a GREAT dancer, one of the best I have ever
seen, to the point of being VERY intimidating.. I have seen her put steps to a
house track that would blow any mortals mind. Also, shit, just look at Paris
is Burning.. Vogueing was all about House music, and brothers like Willi Ninja
get all the way down.. So, all of these explanations are pretty stupid when the
fact is that most white people can't dance. thats it.. On the other hand, I have
seen enough white people backstroking all night long to make up for those that
can't! Cheers.

Subject: "Dancing" and "Raving", an etymological petit fours


One of my favorite things about the rave is that that is where one
goes to dance. Not to "hit on chicks", not to show off your threads,
not to bust a move, but to dance.

Indeed, as I explained to one friend who was nervous, there is no way
you can get people to look at you. In demonstration, I danced around
and under some random female. She did not notice. I danced on a
railing over a sheer drop, then suspended myself from it. No one
noticed. I laid on the floor and rhythmically flung myself into the
air. No one noticed.

This is a good thing.

Considering that the question "what is dancing and what is not" is
just as open ended as any other pertaining to the arts[1], I think
it's best to say that "correct" "rave" "dancing" is the dance that
makes the dancer rave.

And if you don't know what I mean, there ain't any way I can explain
it to ya.[2]

went/came off.  Obviously, my curiousity was not sufficient to keep me in 
Davis to attend the function or even stop by the map point for that matter.
Fortunately, I blasted off at Blow your Head ---> the DNA lounge ---> GG 
park ---> Soul Food (Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez, what a PARTY!).  Speaking of this 
Soul Food gig, 
	(i)	I HIGHLY recommend it, and I think it is going to become a 
weekly thing following the GG Park festivities. (Someone who has spoke to 
Preston about this may have further details)

	(ii)	DJ Danni was spinning some wicked (I'm talking Mephistopheles!)
hip-house, New York Stylee.  I was trying to get my party of five out the door
when she started and it ended with my party trying to get me to leave about 2
hours later.  How do you all feel about this conflagrative sound combining 
rap and house?

I agree with Cynthia (er, Harriet, umm, I mean Leigh) about seeing
some very creative dancing at raves.  In the early days (for me,
meaning last fall) I was struck by a number of "moves" that were
popular at the time, that were unlike any kind of dancing I'd encountered
before, and which I found myself frustratingly unable to emulate.
For some reason, things seem a bit more "free-form" these days, but
I often get more of a buzz watching someone who is really enjoying
their form of expression (whether or not technically sophisticated)
that I do by concentrating on my own gyrations.

Then again, there are a few people out there (any of you know Monique,
or Sharon, namesake of A Rave Called...?) who are just flat out
incredible dancers, full stop.

P.S.  Drove past the Concourse Exhibition Center, and the sign on the
marquee identifies Saturday's rave there as being a Sharon.  Smart
money is on Basics, however -- this is being run by Martin of

Subject: Re: Dancing at Raves

Most ravers I know sort of bob around and move their hands around above their
waist in time to the highhats... 

At least most of the girls that I know do that..

Seeing as I come from an industrial background I kinda end up either A>
stomping around B> acting realy silly and goth-like C> Acting like everyone else

Subject: GG Park Rave

I was reading the funk-punk-thrash-ska concert list and i noticed that on 
Sunday the 14th at 11:30 in the GG Park there will be a concert at Marx 
Meadow (with Life and Death, Fifty Lashes, One-Eyed Jacks, Louder than god 
Morticiuos and Influence 13).
Because there are a lot of bands, I'm wondering if the Rave will be there 
or in another place. Does anybody (R. Jesse) know anything ???? 
Another event happening on Sunday the 14th is the "Festival for the Animals" at 
the SF Civic Center between 11:00 AM and 7:00 PM (free) with the following bands
        Consolidated, Zakir Hussain, Sister Double Happiness, Greg Proops
	Country Joe McDonald, Zero, Midnight Voices and Chill E.B.
It could be interesting...		  Where is everybody going tonight?? 
Aborigine?? Alley Cat???   #############

Ya, like Tim H. said, solstice is coming up.  Let's divert the FMR plans to 
Friday June 20/Saturday June 21 so that we can dance all night and greet
the rising new summer sun.  Who's down?  Taxi?  Anyone?  I'm willing to 
help do pretty much anything (except invest - I'm broke for June).

Oh, I see now that it's Sat June 20/Sun June 21.  The calendar says there are
only two other raves listed so if we organize now we can compete.  It also
sonds like they might be the same rave (I called), which would be even less
competition.

	Anybody hear about a Floppy's on the Solstice? I seem to remember him
saying he had land donated for that weekend up in Napa, and he was hoping
to hold some low-cost mega-event up there....

Hmmm...I'm asking if the FMR not be on June 20/21 as that's right in graduation
time...the following weekend (June 27/28) would be better, although there 
probably isn't a full moon out... :(

Waldo is on the 27th and Rozalla is on the 26th, in case anyone is 
wondering.  I will certainly be at both of those events.  As if anyone 
really cares, but I have a ticket for Rozalla and I am working for the 
Waldo gig.   Peace and enjoy   Siva's Son

	It appears some sites may not have received the last line of my post,
since I forgot to type a carriage return to the end. It reads...

	"is not to be ignored."

	Sorry to leave anyone hanging!

	Ugh! Another letter from him!

	This is for anyone losing their account in the next couple of weeks
due to school, etc. It's a list of publicly accessible Internet sites. I
haven't tried any of these myself, but we have someone from all the San 
Francisco sites on, as well as "cleveland.freenet.edu" and others. Some
are just e-mail, which is really all you need...

Subject: Aborigine was great, Upcoming Solstice Party @ Townsend

More reviews later, but here's a thing ToonTown is doing rumored:

Saturday or Sunday, June 20th or 21st - Solstice at 177 Townsend -
	organizer Mark Hiely, both rooms of Townsend (back and front
	rooms) - cards not printed yet (verify this later ... -Ulmo)


Aborigine was about the best time I ever had at a rave!
[Previous mood: bad, high expectations, disappointed, told not to go,
didn't like the price, the people didn't look right]
What happened?

Santa Cruz came to San Francisco!  As the music got better, these people
really showed their stuff.  It was the energy and excitement of people
new to raving who finally figured it out.  The evening got better and better
as the night wore on, and daylight didn't slow it down much until it
ended later.  EndUp afterparty (Housing Project) was superb, the sun
was shining bright -- I had a great time in short.  I could go into
more detail but I'm tired now ...

P.S. I put new flyers into FTP list on Soda.

Hey all.

I just talked to the guy organizing Basics tonite, and he has just
added Jeno also to the lineup; says it will be his last gig for a while
as he has to stop back in England.

Anyways, that's where I'm heading.  For someone who does not have a
gif viewer, could someone describe the sfraves buttons so I can meet
some of you all?  I don't know the people putting Basics on, but
since I'm not really into the whole bouncy-castle-velcro-climbing-wall
huge commercial raves, this sounds perfect.  Some of the DJ's listed
are some of my favorites, anyways, like Garth and Josh.  Look for
me there, I'll be wearing overalls, Doc Martin's, and a blue baseball
like cap.

Later we're heading to Resurrection at DNA; I really like the atmosphere
there that those guys have created.  I'll also probably be flyering
for them tonite.

Later?

to the Concourse (in SF) on June 26th.  (She'll be at the Edge in Palo

How was Basics?

I wanted to go to that, but woke up at 4AM (a bit late -- I overslept
because of circumstances the evening before).  I was forced to check
out Sharon instead, which since the sun was coming up the dumb
security guard wasn't letting anyone in (equals lazy in my opinion --
how many people would want to wander in late anyway?  Not enough to
cause a problem ...)

The DNA lounge was sort of interesting -- only the second time I've
been there.  Zanzibar was quiet but up.

Subject: Basics!

I saw a couple of SFR buttons there.  They were fluorescent green with large
black SFR letters printed on them.  One of them had added drawings, so I 
assumed they are homemade buttons.

Basics was a great event nonetheless!  I attended it over a Sharon, and
realized I made the right choice since everyone there was practically a
ravEr (which completely made the atmosphere much more friendly for me,
which was very important.)  There's another Basics on July 11th.  They
have the same number as before for the location information.  Was Jeno
wearing a "Tonka" long-sleeve shirt?  I kept wondering who he was, and
everyone I asked on how to pronounce his name, gave me a different 
way to say it.  Ah well... :)

I bought the Zoo Rave 1 compilation yesterday, and have never heard a 
better compilation yet.  Every song is fast, and each contain the noises
I have loved the most from selected other compilations I have.  I'm still
happy hearing this compilation, and I can't believe something could sound
this good.

Anyone have any 2cb info they could mail me, or point me towards any books
that contain info on it?

Subject: Basics on Saturday

Yeah, this was a right decent underground-type rave.

We flaked on our original plans to go straight there, and waited in line
at Sharon for about 20 minutes.  We got nowhere, the line didn't move, and
about 90% (!) or so of the people were the, well, y'know, "party" crowd,
so we drove the 5 blocks to Basics.

I panicked when we first looked in, because there were only about 50 people
in a rather large warehouse space....  I was with several new ravers,
and wanted to show them a super-high energy full-twitch rave.  The
numbers and energy kept coming up, though, and by about 3 am the place
was full and people were GOING!  As a matter of fact, one thing that
struck me about this rave was that there were virtually no "observers";
everyone was really into it.  Only one or two overdressed people out of
maybe 250 (?) at the peak - a killer crowd.

Other particulars: didn't get busted, open until around 9 (I think), no
real trick lights to speak of (which I kinda like), no whistles to be
heard/no lollipops (thank you god).

I was hoping to catch a SFR button, but sorta forgot to look.  Oh well,
I'm sure I'll meet the rest of you in time.

Subject: Fashionable ravers?  Contradiction?


Hello all.  I was just thinking about what people were saying before that 
ravers don't follow trendy clothes and so on, such as when people go 
"clubbing", one usually dresses nice, exceptional hair, makeup for women, etc.
but one thing I notice a lot is that ravers are, too, fashionable/trendy.
Many ravers wear either "house" clothes or the Toon-ish Cat-In-The-Hat
outfits and such.

Is there some sort of contradiction??  To me, it looks as if these clothes
are more than just comfortable clothes, but rather fashion for ravers.  Not
saying that there's anything wrong with that, but I guess finals has got
me thinking strangely... :(

Right on ! BC the energy was high at Basics.  New people are a good thing 
That's what I would like to think the scene is about, and that's people 
coming together and having a good time.  One thing I would like to make 
a distinction between a party and a Rave.  I like to think that what Basics 
was, was a party.  Raves strike me as real big with lots of people on E 
for the first time.  Which is not a bad thing its just when some people 
get out of control bumping into everyone and knowing better to excuse 
themselves.  Anyway, my two cents.  Peace  Siva's Son

Subject: fashion at the rave


When I was at MIT, I used to buy clothes at Dollar A Pound, where the name
is the price structure. I would then "manufacture" them into interesting
objets, by bleaching, dyeing, sewing, etc.

When I went to my first rave, I noticed that all those clothes were now
fashionable. So I went to the Palo Alto goodwill and got my newest pairs
of orange and pink pants, etc. It helps to know what your sizes are in
womens clothing, but that shouldn't stop you. Try everything on, anyway.

I think the most important factor of rave clothing is that it makes you
feel ravey. Some of us don't need this stuff, but if it helps, it's a nice
boost. (I have a nice Ameba jester hat. Love it.)

But Rave should not be a fashion show. Fashion is to make other people
feel less cool than you. Rave is about making everyone feel cool. So
that's why I'm out painting faces, stamping hands (I need a big stamp
"APPROVED"), giving away DUM DUMs.

I do need a new pair of Reality Proof Glasses, though. Any leads appreciated.

I am thinking of having a tie-dye marathon soon. Interested people contact
me directly.

	If y'all haven't done so already, check out The Electric Kool-Aid
	Acid Test by Tom Wolfe. It's about Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters

	(the Acid Tests) sound amazingly like raves. Strobe lights, 
	black lights, massive sound systems, day-glo colors, crazy costumes,
	loud music, trippy decor, sound familiar?
	
	There was one Acid Test held in Longshoreman's Union Hall (the

I feel sufficiently distracted and compelled to want to contribute
to this conversation.

I believe that fashionable clothes can be comfortable clothes.
Especially if you make them yourself.
But then, most people don't think my clothes are fashionable.
I would like to point out that I own a pair of heels that are
so comfortable I can skateboard in them.  If I could skateboard.

I see nothing wrong with fashion for ravers.  I personally would
like to attend raves with my suitcase of accessories and hats
so I could accommodate my twitching mood changes, but there's
really nowhere to put such accoutrements, so I'm usually completely
de-cessorized, since it's kinda hard to dance with a butcher knife
swinging around your neck.  usually.

Warning:  I totally disagree with the following.

>From: bill coderre <bc@apple.com>

>But Rave should not be a fashion show. 

Wait, who's writing the rules about what Rave should and shouldn't
be ?  I love seeing some of the clothing I've seen at raves.

>Fashion is to make other people feel less cool than you.

Well, my subscription to Women's Wear Daily or whatever the fuck
it's called expired a few years back, so perhaps I'm not 
*qualified* to comment, but that never stops me.

_Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language
Unabridged_ (1981) at page 825:

fashion <deleted pronunciation etc> 2 a : manner, way <expressed himself
in a striking fashion> ... 2 d : *archaic* : show, pretense

(emphasis added)

that's about how I define it.  I think "fashion" is simply the use
of clothing, etc., to express one's personality.  It's an artistic
statement.  Or it can be.  Maybe for some people it's a pretentious
vehicle, but who wants to waste time with people like that ?

>Rave is about making everyone feel cool.

Can't argue there, but I still fail to see how fashion impinges
upon rave making everyone feel cool.  Plus, I think I'd rather
be uncool anyway.

Well, random derogatory remarks about how unfashionable I am
and always will be are always welcome, especially from you,
bc.

No contradiction here (he said diplomatically).  I think the point
Bill and Jeffrey were trying to make, with which I totally agree, is that
there is no single "correct" way to dress at a rave, or even a limited set
of options.  I enjoy seeing people who've made an effort to be highly
individualistic and visually striking, or whimsical, but feel no
pressure on others or myself to do the same.  Yet another feature
setting rave apart from its velvet-rope-doorman-with-attitude predecessors.

Let's revel in rave's celebration of human diversity, and recognize
that clothing, while fun, is no real basis on which to judge others.

Subject: San Diego Trip Report, etc. (long, but too bad)

Well, I've been back from San Diego for a couple of days.  It took me a while
to munge through the *hundreds* of mail messages you folks dropped in my
mailbox while I was away (not counting the "real" mail).  I add my $.02 to a
couple of the threads, but mainly, this is just the San Diego Trip Report!

                                  * * *

By way of preface, a brief self-description.  As a person pushing 35 now, I've
been through some 3 prior "underground" psychedelic-related music movements
(hippie, mutant and the pertinent aspects of 'wave), and was pretty active in 
the latter two.  I used to be a music critic, and have the record collection
to prove it.  I became one because I disagreed with virtually all of them (I
don't respect critics, and *enjoy* parody of generic criticspeak).  My musical
interests are *very* broad - I take my strange wherever I can find it, and it
doesn't have to have anything to do with amplified instruments or electronics.
I am not by nature a True Believer, though some might have doubted this in my
mutant larval stage.  I tend to push farther back, to find the roots of my
interests.  There is some possibility (probably slim) that I coined the words
"industrial" and "electropop" in my writings - I don't know of prior uses, but
would love to hear from anybody who thinks they know of any during or predating
the late '70s (Bloom, are you out there?).  I first used the former term to
describe the early-70's German band Faust (one of my all-time faves), and the
latter as a tag for the weenies circa 1980 imitating Eno, Kraftwerk, Cluster,
etc. (eg. Tubeway Army, The Normal, Our Daughter's Wedding, and a whole host of
others).

There - now you know "everything" about me, so it'll be easier to spot my 
biases, and interpret whatever I'm trying to say ...

                                  * * *

Prior to departure, I solicited the net for leads on San Diego rave culture,
and got zero response.  So I was on my own, and armed myself with the two most
valuable things to have in an alien city - the Yellow Pages and a good street
map.  I figured I'd apply the Harvard Square Theory to finding youth culture -
look for record and book stores in conflagration.  This approach works here,
and in places like DC, but fails in wastelands like Sarasota and Dallas, so I
wasn't sure it would pan out.  As it happens, the Records section of the YP
showed a bunch of stores on El Cajon, and had a display ad for a pretty
decent-looking store called Off The Record with a branch out there.  It also
showed a number of used stores and a Tower.  "Success!," I figured, and never
looked under Books.  On the map, I could see that El Cajon was a long street,
paralleled by University Av.  My strategy would be to cruise down the length
of University Av, then back up El Cajon, and see if I could spot any 
interesting neighborhoods where I could get leads to rave clubs or even raves
themselves.

University Av starts out with a bunch of ethnic eateries and other trendiness,
then turns low-rent, then sleazy, before ending up in white-collar suburbs,
by which point one clearly has gone too far.  Just as it's turning sleazy,
there's a head shop with colorful difficult-to-read signage reading "Synthetic
Trips."  Aha!  Scree!  Park.  (Boston lost its head shops in the mid-70's, so
I had to go in, for nostalgia, at the very least.)  The place is run by a 
middle-aged and pretty-normal-looking fellow.  It has all the standard head
shop stuff, but no rave flyers.  Having no interest in purchasing a 
balance-beam scale, a grotesque dildo, Maxfield Parrish poster, or any of his
other wares, I left empty-handed, cruised past strip clubs, "Oriental" and
"Swedish" "massage parlors," porno stores and peep arcades, all the way to
squeaky-white suburbia.  In short, a total loss.

The route back on El Cajon, while not as sleazy, didn't look much more 
promising.  The used shops and the Tower were out in the middle of nowhere
near shopping malls, as was my selected target - the Off The Record store.
Oh, well, I figured; make the most of it - besides, maybe the scene is sort of
"dispersed," and I'll still find what I want here.  

Inside, they're playing some metal record or other.  The place is half-filled
with old vinyl at inflated prices, and half-filled with "alternative" rock.
They fail the Henry Cow and Cecil Taylor tests, so clearly they don't go too
far out there.  I check under some well-known names like KLF (an empty slot),
Orb (absent), and Lords of Acid (absent).  OK.  Things at this point don't look
too good for raving, so I resign myself to generalized browsing.  Having been
in the car for hours that afternoon, I want to salvage the experience as best I
can.  I finally leave with the CD reissue of Tim Buckley's "Lorca" and a new CD
by Keith & Julie Tippett.  The antique Tyrannosaurus Rex vinyl isn't in 
condition to justify it's price, and the guys at the counter aren't helpful 
about raving.  At this point, I decide to bag the quest until the next day.

As it turned out, that evening I luckily made the brief acquaintance of a young
woman (a 22-year-old), and got to talking about what there was to do in town,
and where one might find a concentration of college-aged folks.  She suggested
I go out El Cajon and up College Av, and also informed me that University Av
was a dangerous place to be - there had been lots of hate crimes out there.
Jeez.

Day 2 - The College Av trip.

It being lunchtime, I decided to head to the base of University Av, where the
restaurants are, and get a bite before trekking out to College Av.  As it
turned out, I coincidentally cruised up 5th Av to get there, and lo and behold,
I found several interesting bookstores, and another branch of Off The Record.
The Blue Door bookstore was suitably alternative, but no flyers.  Desperation
more than anything led me to try the Off The Record.  I certainly didn't
expect results at this point.

But I got 'em.  Flyers galore.  Gazillions of club flyers, and a huge, gaudy
one for a true rave about a week after I would leave town.  A stack of free
papers about the scene, called Urb Magazine.  A rave 12"-er section.  CDs, too.
But I didn't buy any of them - they were too expensive, and I was too
distracted by the $6 used CDs of things like Captain Beefheart's "Safe As
Milk," Syd Barrett's "The Madcap Laughs" and Christmas' "Ultraprophets of the
Psychick Revolution," all of which I left with in my wittle hands.

[Besides, I'm not sure I know what I'm doing purchasing rave records yet - the
last three I bought ("Zoo Rave 1," "Best of Techno Volume 1" and "Paroxysm 
Volume 1") *bore* *the* *living* *crap* *out* *of* *me*.  I much prefer to
listen to the house and acid house records I've purchased over the past 3 or 4
years, or 808 State's "Oops," for instance.  Maybe there's more to techno than
these CDs indicate, but I've decided not to research the problem by throwing
more money at it.  End of digression.]

The flyer for the rave (at Jack Murphy Stadium) said to get tickets at
Behind The Postoffice and a few other places.  The guy at the checkout counter
gave me directions to Behind the Postoffice, and I was off.  I figured that
even if I couldn't make it to that one, the people who sold the tickets would
be good candidates for helping me find one in the few days I had left.

"On the way" (180 degrees out, that is) I did go to College Av.  Nothing out
there but a college.  I guess the 22-year-old misunderstood what I wanted.

Behind the Postoffice is (surprise) behind the postoffice downtown.  There's a
little strip of funky stores there, and in fact the neighborhood also sports
a number of galleries and clubs related to the scene, including the Verbum
Gallery of Electronic Art.  I got tickets to a rave (the last in the Opium
series - the following night - phew!) in the first store I ventured into, which
turned out to be next door to Behind the Postoffice.  More flyers.  I toured
the neighborhood, collecting flyers everywhere, before heading out to change
lodging to Pacific Beach, slightly south of La Jolla.

It turns out that in San Diego, these little funky clothing stores (tinier and
less self-consciously "hip" than, say, Allston Beat) are the best bet for
where to go to get info.  They have more flyers, and the people in them are
*really* *friendly*.

Another observation - there's clearly a lot of money behind the rave scene
there.  Virtually all the flyers were 4-color separations printed on pretty
heavy glossy card stock (the Boston flyers are very crude by comparison).
Behind the Postoffice uses old flyers for pricetags on their duds.

Behind the Postoffice also had the "Cat in the" hats (less colorful than
those hawked at the rave itself [but I get ahead of myself], and less well
made and less trippy than those at Allston Beat), as well as these even
more enomous jobs in the shape of teapots.  Would have been real popular with
the Planet Gong fans back in the 70s.  What PHP wouldn't want one of those
gracing his or her crown?

The guy in the store where I bought the Opium tickets suggested we go to a
supposedly rave club in the neighborhood called Metropolis that evening, which
we did.  Yawn.  The dancefloor was in a back room and tiny.  The DJ was boring.
Hardly anyone was there (there was this one couple which was clearly a 
throwback fo Saturday Night Fever era disco which was a hoot to watch, but
I think they *meant* it, which was frightening).  The club *did* have dark 
beer as it's one redeeming feature.  Our own Venus De Milo is a *much* more fun
and interesting club.

Day 3 - My first rave.

By this point the conference which had brought us to San Diego had ended, so
India was able to traipse around the city with me during the day.  We went
back to the little clothing shops to purchase some workable rave wear.  I ended
up getting over 1 year's hair growth removed right next door in a really
interesting hair salon/loft/gallery.  The woman who did my hair was two years
younger than me (and clearly hip), and asked what we were doing that evening.
I said we were going to a rave.  She wondered why we wanted to hang out with 
scads of teenagers tripping on X and A, and said that she had recently gotten
free tickets to a rave in Mexico, and had given them to her teenage daughter,
who had a great time.  India looked at me.  I said, "Hm.  As far as I know, 
it's not quite that young a crowd in San Francisco."  I hedged.  "Look, at the
very least it'll be anthropological, like we're among the Maori or something."

The evening came.  The plan was to skip dinner, so we would have empty
stomachs "just in case."  We were to phone the secret number after 9:00 PM.
That number told up to phone another number and enter the secret code when
asked.  I phoned the second number, which was in the LA area code.  It never
asked for the secret code, and proceeded to give out elaborate directions to
the site.  Already I was suspicious.  Why didn't it ask?  Did I do something
wrong?

By this point India was starving, and not very excited about the whole idea
anyway.  I gave in and we ate.  So much for metabolizing anything special,
should we be so lucky.

We followed the instructions all the way to Escondido before getting lost due
to an ambiguity in my transcription of the directions.  We stopped at a gas
station and got help from a local lady filling her tank.  She asked what we
were looking for.  I said we didn't know - we only had these directions.  She
drew a map for us.  We wandered some more, and ended up at an all-night store.
I shortcut the directions by asking the clerk how to get to the final street
on the route.

It was a completely isolated road leading milesup a mountain past RV parks to
an Indian reservation.  That's where the rave was held, under a full moon.  It
was really desolate up there, and *cold*.  The rave was in a kind of dirt pit.
And no Indians were involved.

As we walked up, the first impressions were of some whacked-out street fair.
There were a slew of concession booths, selling glow-in-the-dark tacky things,
smart drinks, showing trippy videotapes, hawking "Cat in the" hats, and so on.

The people were reminiscent of nothing so much as Deadheads, particularly the
boys.  There's a real gender differentiation in the dress between the boys and
the girls down there.  The girls dress real sexy, showing off their bodies as
best they can (it took real determination in that cold - I was wearing a down
vest and was still chilly).  Bikini tops were de rigeur.  Bottoms were largely
teeny shorts - both lycra and cutoffs, or if long pants, ass-pants.  One girl
was wearing a white lace minidress and dancing frenetically between hugging
people.  On the other hand, the boys completely camouflage themselves in the
baggiest clothing they can find, particularly the monstro overalls which were
so popular among certain potheads in 70s suburbia.  India and I agree that
there's an underlying sexist imbalance in these fashions which parallels so
much of mainstream popular culture.  We call it the "rabbit" effect, after
Roger Rabbit.  The idea is that the frumpy guy (the rabbit) gets to have the
sexy babe.  It's quite prevalent once you know to look for it, and you *never*
see the genders reversed in this story.  But again I digress.

Most people weren't dancing per se.  It was more like they were prancing 
around, walking bouncy.  I guess it was sort of the dance equivalent to what 
sprechtstimme is to singing.  There was a hardcore crowd of ravers which had
pressed itself up to the jigawatt speakers in order to simultaneously go deaf
and I guess feel stimulated by the vibrations.  A massage is better for your
hearing, but hey, I look at things differently at my age - hearing loss is
permanent.

There were a number of campfires scattered around the site, with matresses on
the ground nearby.  Cold people sat on them staring at the fire, and at the
laser show.

A "cigarette girl" worked the crowd with a tray of cigs, candy cigs, 
diffraction-grating glasses (preprinted with the words "Ravevision Eyewear"),
beers and doo-dads before sitting down on the matress to have a beer.

We had had some smart drinks and were waiting to see if there'd be any effects.
At one point I felt like I was on the cusp of feeling something like early X,
and waited, but nothing more happened.  I asked the "cigarette girl" if people
usually brought their own or what.  She said they brought their own (not what
the post-punky hairdresser mom told us).  At this point someone wandered by
with balloons.

It had seemed to me so far that the rave was *not* the greatest thing since
the invention of the napkin.  The music wasn't particularly interesting, with
the exception of occasional trumpet bits which turned out to be from a live
trumpeter behind the DJ table.  The laser show was similar to something we had
seen somewhere in Atlanta in association with Siggraph a few years back, only
cheesier.  The smart drinks (Durk and Sandy brand) hadn't done much but clench
my jaw a little.  The people weren't that fascinating after the first half
hour.  And every time you turned around there was another concession of some
sort.  I had become convinced that things *must* be more fun if you were in the
proper state of mind, because in a normal one, it all became rather dull
awfully quickly.  And we weren't being moved to dance for some reason.

I broke down and chased around to find the source of the balloons, and got two
for $5.  Further refills cost $5 each.  Lots of money being made there.  A 20
lb tank costs about $55 in these parts, and I know there's a whole lot more
than 11 balloons in one.

An "Ice Cream Truck" drove up tinkling.  It was covered with Merry 
Pranksteresque doodles, and was hawking candy, gum and water.  Someone 
immediately ran up to it with a big papier mache Mad Hatter head & stuck it on
top.

We never did manage to alter our states.  We never did get more interested or
into it.  Best part of the evening was watching the laser beams from below,
as they cut cross sections in the fractal volume that was the smoke from the
campfires.

We left, glad that we had gone, however.  It was a special, unusual experience,
if not the ecstatic fun release we had hoped for.

                                  * * *

We spent our remaining time doing other San Diego things.  Torrey Pines beach
and so on.  No more ravin' was undertaken.  But I have a really nifty
collection of flyers from out there.

I remain convinced that we can do better here in Boston.  It wasn't that great.
(It certainly was less interesting than dancing to the Au Pairs at the
Underground, The Dance at Maverick's after the strippers mostly departed, the
Lounge Lizards at BFVF when they were in Allston, Christmas at Johnny D's in 
Allston, Beefheart or Burma or the Somebodies almost anywhere.  I could go on,
but I won't.)  And we have a lot of creative people in this city who could
fashion something *really* new and different, rather than simply importing 
Dr Seuss doohickies and all the rest.

That's the challenge, as I see it.  You may (probably do) disagree.

PS: A few final notes - "San Diego's Weekly Reader" - not to be confused with
  "My Weekly Reader" - is the "Phoenix" equivalent; "Revolt" is the "Stuff"
  equivalent.  Jus' soze ya know, iff'n ya go there.  BTW, I really enjoyed
  San Diego on the whole.  My one reservation about the place is the sizeable
  military presence, which is unlike anything we have out here.

I don't think they are intended to be a test at all.  When I'm in the
rave groove, I'm feeling a lot of support for the positive and mysterious
energy within and around me.  I wonder if the 'fun-ness' of raves is
what will eventually dilute the scene as more people who *just* want
to have fun join in.  This brings up a question I have, being kinda
new to the rave scene:  Are there any raves without dancing (i.e. just
chill out rooms)?  Would anyone go?

Come out to our raves in Utah.  We're always testing new equipment and the
idea as to whether we'll make our money back.  This last weekend had power
breakers failing, the laser breaker tripping, and a CD player skipping, not to
mention half the mixer failing as soon as the thing started.

Party on.

My dear Miss Helen Haynes:

I think the gist of our disagreement lies in the definition of the
word "fashion". Cynthia prefers the pure definition, which talks about
expressionate style of clothing. I deliberately misused the word to
connote "The Fashion Police", the mythical organization that punishes
those that are not in the depeche mode, as it were.

Selah. I bow to the Woman of Many Names. Indeed, I do think that rave
has everything to do with fashion as Harriet has defined it. Or at
least, I certainly and without doubt operate in that mode myself when
raving.

So, at our next meeting, Ms Fitzhugh, shall we wear formal clothing? I
guess it's just a question of who wears the tuxedo and who wears the
cocktail dress.

maybe.  at Brainstorm a while back, it seemed more like a big drug

hi chris and y'all merry prankish ravers!
actually, there is a simple way to make raves more of a 'test' : we
just start doing more of 'our' thing, whatever that is. this can - probably
would - have a contagious effect on other people at the rave, and they
might also do more of 'their' thing, thereby making raves more spontaneous,
less 'controlled.' what do you say ?
regarding the similarities between the merry pranksters and raves, i think
it's more than sf/bay area location and 'tradition';
  whenever people try to create a space open
for more personal/spontaneous activities, there will be something like the
spirit of the rave or the acid test.

Yeah, first time I heard about raves I had just finished Tom Wolfe's book,
and they sounded to me kinda like Acid-Test ripoffs (with dancing added,
with a cover price, and with a different drug).  I'm not old enough to have
been at an Acid Test, tho ...

Has anyone read "Child of Fortune" by Norman Spinrad?  It's sci-fi and he
takes the ideas of the 60's youth movement and extends it into a sort of
"eternal flame of youth culture" thing -- e.g. one incarnation is in the
form of a guy named "Pater Pan" and his initiates, who wear multicolored
sashes and make their living as street performers of various sorts, hawkers,
etc.  Neat book.

Subject: The Acid Test

  I may be wrong (and I'm sure folks out there will let me know if I am), but I
believe there are some fundamental and decisive differences between the 60s
Pranksters and the 80s ravers.  
  1) The Pranksters were a real community, not just a group that got together
at dances or on a network.  They lived together, travelled together, shared a
whole lifestyle together.
  2) The Pranksters shared what Tom Wolfe identified as an "unspoken thing." TYhThis "thing" as near as he could puzzle it out, was a quasi-religious state of
community and awareness based on shared transcendent experiences. I don't see
a comparable "unspoken thing" in raving.
  There's more; but might as well let the flamers get their torches lit without
more wind from my corner.  :<)

Subject: fashioning your look

I not only agree with Cynthia: I'll lurch a couple of steps further:
1) Clothing is an expression of your personality.  You can't choose your skin
color (unless your M Jackson), height, etc.  But you can and do choose your
outer surface.  Even a non-choice ("What the hell... I'll just fling on anythingand jam off to the rave.") is a choice.  So the issue becomes: what do you want
to express?  Much of the clothing of the hippoes expressed a whole world of new
values: the vividness of the psychedelic experience, a receptiveness to ideas
from Indian masters, etc. What does the clothing you wear to raves express aboutyou?
2) You may insist that you aren't going to judge other people by their threads.
But that don't mean they aint a-gonna judge you! They do, they will -- whether
you ever hear those judgements articulated or not.
3) There is a difference between dressing (or writing or cooking, etc.) with 
style, and the same act done stylized.  The first comes from the heart and asks
to to accepted as such.  The second is an imitation.  There was plenty of
stylized psychedelic clothing (and music etc.) in the 70s; but (to be generous),
at least they were trying.

Weren't the P's a small group in a much larger community?

They've never stopped talking about it since, maybe he just wasn't
able to hear them then.  Isn't TW often criticized for putting his

Frankie bones was a rave i was at wearing our nations colours 
with some stars and stripes added and he looked pretty cool
his go-go dancer type girl was wearing the same colours
but had a beret (sp?) so she looked a little more french
(also her skin colour and bone structure added to that)

Yes!  You did the same as me.  It was funny when I was
walking home with Jonathen(sp), he said "everyone said they
had a hundred people -- it was just the same hundred people
going everywhere!" (jokingly) 

Wednesday is when my raving this week started. I can hardley
remember what I did that day:  I started writing about it,
and got about four paragraphs into it when I realized I was
just talking about Thursday (see below)!  However, I'll
mention the following ... 

I went to B.H.C.  Nothing was happening there at all.  I
went to 540 Howard St.  That was not a rave:  it's the first
time I went in the front door to this place called "DV8",
and I think it's the last.  There were a lot of people with
suits, straight, in the pick-up scene.  Very weird, spooky
-- I guess one needs to be spooked every once in a while,
but it didn't make me feel any better that day (I was having
a bad week this week).  Then, I left, and went to EndUp. The
$5 charge wasn't monsterous, but the crowd didn't look like
it was worth $5; what can I tell from peeking in?  I can't!
I meandered on to The Stud (a gay bar), got even more
disgusted with that scene than ever (I seem to really prefer
rave type events), and was very happy to call it a night. 

However, I did conclude something of prime importance, from
my `DV8' experience and from passing by whatever was at 1015
Folsom ... for some strange reason, I have this brain clot
or something where I just don't get hints from society and
the people I know about certain things.  This time, it's
with people:  I failed & refused to realize for the
absolutely longest time, despite all the sensority input
that told me to wake up to this, that it >matters< who is
DJing at a place.  Despite numerous people telling me "Brad,
you have to know which DJs are good" even from the people I
trust most, I utterly failed to really accept this idea.  I
don't think it was conscious, I think it's linked to some
unconscious trouble I have related to the fact that I'm very
poor at remembering people's names.  So, that night, I made
a resolve to know every DJ and who they are, in terms of
raving, so that from now on I will have a better idea of
what to expect. Henceforth, I'll have a list, and will be
keeping personal tally, on who I think is good and bad.
There seems to be a large amount of flyer polution in the
way of non-ravey events, and this one meter (who's DJing)
would be one of the best to determine where to go and where
not to. I'll remove a lot of the garbage I put into the
weekly list --- it really is quite bad!  I'm glad you went
to all those places Thursday, since it really does help edit
out the crap. 


Thursday:  Eddie Richards, Freesia, Bryant & 4th, and flyers
... 

My wonderful experience wih Deep Faith at 201 9th St
(basement of Cocktails) last week suggested I try it again
this week (I had a free flyer, plus it's only $3 anyway).
Unfortunately, the bartender said when I walked in at the
ungodly hour of 10PM "you're the first person who asked.
<name I forget> went to NY for a <name I forget> musical
<something>."  A few minutes later, a few other people
walked in and asked him the same thing ... no Deep Faith
that night. 

I got my exercise.  Nothing was happening at 339 Jessie St.
(back of B.H.C.) at 10PM, so I went on to Summerschool (I
think that was the name) at Bryant and 4th.  $15:  you've
got to be kidding me!  I could >not< handle that. I left,
with a nice big "YES" printed all over my hand.  I went to
id., at "it" (Harriet Alley & Folsom = 1015 Folsom), and the
crowd was very non-ravey. I got in right before the
you-get-charged time.  The only cool thing there, as usual,
was the black light stamps I love.  It was ok techno music
with a whole lot of down and out people attending:  not my
The white lasers were cool though.  I sort of dazed at them
for a while while I waited for the night to wane. crowd, at
least.  I'm 21, so perhaps the predominance of older people
put me off a lot. 

Finally, I decided to set out, and go >someplace<.  I went
to Freesia, and they said the magic word:  $8.  My $7 limit
is flexible ... the ten or so of us in there sort of waited
for everyone else to dance before we would.  I think I had
such great control over dancing crowd size for the first
four hours, that I sort of got way too self-conscious and
had to hide on occasion because of it.  There were a few
good dancers there who saw no trouble having fun, especial
ly later on, and the people who played did a good job (Jan
was there, as well as a few others I forget).  At 3:30 AM, I
took advantage of the time and went over to Gamma (which I
keep accidentally calling Osmosis -- I'm always behind the
times).  It was surreal going through the ritual of walking
in when it doesn't look like anything's happening.  The
doorman was sort of sleeping, which was about the right
thing to be doing since when I got in, the two of us dancing
were fairly alone. 

So, the music was ok.  (Note my sort of numbing complacensy,
inability to recognize good things ...)  I decided to go
talk to meander outside, and on the way out stopped at the
doorman.  I asked him why it was so quiet. For once, the
doorman actually responded with more thought and
intelligence than I was wanting!  He said that Evil Eddie
Richards was spinning, and that he just spins so fast that
the crowd didn't know what to make of him. 

Having figured out that I ought to take advantage of
everything while I had the chance, I pranced back upstairs
and did acknowledge that the speed of the beats was a bit
higher than I am used to hearing.  The one time, >one< time
I ever heard someone spin  so fast before, I >loved< it! My
body is much more attuned to dancing to things at that
speed.  Well, I got a second chance at it, and it was
wonderful.  I just >had< to let loose; my muscle-twisting
slow style developed at Freesia hours before was getting in
my way, and finally I realised there really is something
different about the UK rave scene than here:  the rate of
dancing does do different things, in terms of letting loose
and flowing freely. un at this speed, consistently.  If I
have a change, I >will< go  to Eddie Richards tonight or
whenever whereever. It was great! 

The bum who shoves people out walked up to me and said "this
is easy." I was the only one to throw out.  I made life
difficult for him by claiming "no!  I won't leave!", which
didn't amuse him at all (no sense of humor!)  But I left
fairly happily nontheless, and talked more with the doorman,
who seemed even more awake than before, I guess because he
was realizing that soon he would get to go.  I asked again
about why it was so quiet, and commented on how in fact he
was right Eddie does spin faster, and he had some things to
say back that I mostly forget. He said that night was
strange because there was no advertising (flyers) so there
were fewer people, and people sort of came and went all
night long. 

Going back to Freesia, I was astounded by the amazing
slowness of the spinning there, and took at least half an
hour to get my body re-accustomed to it.  It really is
different, and more difficult to dance to ... 

(Part of Freesia's poor turnout is attributable to the poor
advertising, partly because they didn't get their flyers
printed early enough.) 

After that, I was standing outside in the daylight making
contact with whoever was friendly enough to talk to. Someone
mentioned Osmosis turned evil once the suburbanites took it
over, and Gamma is worse (well, I can see all that -- but I
still liked both of them).  He mentioned how Gus Presents is
trying to find a younger crowd, and how Carefree is good. (I
didn't know about the Gus thing, but already knew the
Care*Free thing.) 

I was talking to Jonathen (everyone knows Jonathen, it's
funny -- I called the # for his rave, and one of the things
it said was "If you have any questions, ask Jonathen."  It
didn't say how, or where ... after all, he is everywhere and
most people know him).  He said "are you going to
Trecadero?" I said the equivilent of "huh?", and finally
after about three or four minutes of mumbling and deciding
what to do, he asked if I knew where it was.  I said no, but
that I was going to 4th and Bryant.  I laughed as we figured
out that was the same thing.  When we got there, they did
let us in (did my YES stamp combined with the lateness get
me past otherwise strict security guards?) It was fun, as
fun as fun can be when one is sick, tired, hungry and up for
24 hours (I don't handle that too well).  But I was happy to
see the guys and gals dancing -- it was a different crowd,
sort of mixed between the ones that snobs like to avoid and
the ones snobs don't mind.  I liked hearing Jonathen say
that earlier it was `happening', since that broke down even
more of my stereotypes.  He was commenting on how all the
guys there were buffed and how he ought to start working out
-- made me think of doing the same myself, but unfortunately
I just don't have the personality to lift weights.  That
made me appreciate everything more when he put it in that
light ... 

Funny, it was a very non-rave like evening, until the
morning came, but the best spinning I heard was Eddie
Richards and the guy who was spinning late at the 4th&Bryant
thing, as well as some at Freesia.  I just hope someday I
can put together some of these awesome and good DJs with
some great crowds ... ahh, maybe tonight? 

Flyers abound, I got most of them from SommerSchool.  Be
>very< forewarned, that these are not necessarily a certain
calabre of event that some people (myself included) would
want to go to, but don't let that stop you from showing me
(and a few others) how overly descriminate I am.

That might explain it.  (Not that there aren't planners who are into it.)

This was toontown like it aughtta/shoudda/useta be!. I had a lot of fun,
at first I though that it was going to be lame with a lot of "tourist" and
complet with "top gun" guys and gals but around 2:30 3:00 (I guess its true what they say about when the bar closes) The ravers took over.

The last DJ was Jan Cooley, a very small and, on the surface, frail looking woman.  But, as in all of life, looks are very deceiving.  She was RELENTLESS and she took no prisoners.  I couldn't stop dancing, I Just couldn't stop.
If this is feminine techno/house then give me more!  I could easily listen
to her all night but I don't know if my body could stand it.

Yeah, I'm gonna rant, not rave, about this one.

Did anyone else go to the Feel-X rave on Sat. nite?  I don't recall
ever being as disgusted over a rave as this weekend's Feel-X.

These guys were after some serious bucks.  First off, they're charging a
$20 cover for an underground SF rave, a price usually only gotten by the
biggest of the commercial bouncycastlevelcroclimbingwall raves.  By 1am,
there were so many people in the warehouse that you couldn't dance for
people shoving by you - the warehouse was only about 15 feet wide by a block
long; but STILL the map point is selling tix as fast as it can and elevator
loads of people are coming up and cramming in.

This was busted because of the size of the crowd, by 5 squad cars, 2 paddy
wagons, and a fire marshal.  AT 1:10 AM!  But STILL the map point at 1:30am
is trying to sell tickets for $20!  What the fuck?

Oh, but hey at least plain water is a BARGAIN inside AT $2 for a small water
and $4 for a large!  The crowd was the "mall" crowd, for the most part,
and I saw my first bona fide fistfight at a rave.

This is truly sad.  It's people like the organizers of this one that are
going to kill this scene here, don't you think?
Now the fire marshal will be all the quicker to find these
and shut them down; now people will have to wonder if an interesting
looking flyer has some greedy fucks behind it who don't care how many
tickets they sell or if people have a good time, and will go off to a
big commercial rave in a legal spot.

Sniff.

Did you know that the flyer for the rave Feel-X and another plain
yellow flyer that just says 'Map Point' and the date are actually
referring to the very same rave?  From the flyers, they make it seem
that the raves are actually different though sometimes they have the
same phone number, and the yellow flyer mentions a subset of the dj's
that the Feel-X flyer mentions.  A friend of mine found this out about
two Feel-X's ago - what clever marketing.  

I've never gone to a Feel-X.  Two Feel-X's ago, I went to the map
point and they were charging $15.  I thought that was kind of steep so
I waited to see what kind of folks would go for that.  I didn't feel
"in touch" with any people shelling out the bucks nor did I know any
of them so I saved my cash and went to some other rave.  After hearing
about that one and this past one, I'm glad I didn't go to either.  You
just have to watch out for the promoters who are driven more by
cashflow than anything else.  I've heard Feel-X promoters promote 
relentlessly in San Jose and anywhere they can.  I don't know who they
are or where in the Bay Area they are from so these days, I just stay away.

at one location and go to another for the rave, no chance of a refund. 
This is the same place that used where some of the better Zulu parties of 
5 or so years ago were thrown and the police didn't like it then either.
They said we'd get in free at Big Heart City, but I was't interested, and went 
to the Mr. Floppy party on Rose which was more my thing anyway, (a better 
environment for us temporally advanced ravers ....:)
Saterday night started OK with the Boom Operators at the Hyperbole/Berlin

(digressed?) to some very danceable house music.

Yup.  I had a bad FEELing about that one.  I first trekked to haight &
ashbury to the "pre-map point", only to be directed to page & stanyan to
the "map point", only to discover a street-full of kids waiting to drop $20
on a ticket for something they didn't even know the location of.  I quickly
made a three-point turn and headed home.

Later on, a friend and I picked up two tix for Vortex (only $10 this time).
 Even with a lower price, Vortex was OK but disappointing (but cheaper than
last week's BASICS).

It was held in a small, aluminium wharehouse way out near Candlestick Park.
 One dancefloor w/ a small wooden loft (filled with spectators). No
beverages or chill-out room.  They did have some hypervideo projections. 
The organizers were selling flourescent pendants right by the enterance.  I
guess even the underground raves are getting into merchandising!

I may stick to Townsend St. on my Saturdays out - What's the name of the
rave in the back of Townsend behind CareFree???

Does anyone know if there's anything regular at 174 King St.?

 ... It was Solstice, and a Saturday night to boot - in no way was I
going to be hanging around the house! So, I (tried) to take a short nap, 
got into my truck, and headed north on HW280. 

 "Why don't I go to a Map Point ? Always a first time for everything " I
thought to myself. Got the address of the house from the guy standing 
at the corner - not hard to identify the right place, as people were 
going in and out the same door.

 Walked in to see two high school/freshmen types plunk down $20 each, and
no change. After confirming that, indeed, the gal did want $20 for a pig
in a poke, I left. I should have gotten a clue from the groups of 
disgruntled ravers hanging around outside.

 So, what next? Looked at the handy-dandy calender listing - "Vortex" ?
A Haight St. address from the phone machine. Only $10.00 bucks, but "out
of town" ( near Candlestick ). Is this a rip-off? And only my fourth
rave.

 After missing the freeway exit and winging it, ( why is that cop following
me ? ) I find the warehouse. I go in. The follwing are my impressions and 
observations -


 *  Two video projectors, but actually the same signal. Mixture of
   psychotronic videos, cartoons, and computer animations. 
 *  One hard-working strobe light. Many blacklights. Thank Jah for the 
   big electric fan!
 *  What I think was a large, bare storage room that had a bare blue bulb
   palely glowing in the ceiling - by default, the "chill room". Nice
   graffitti on the wall - "I'll sleep when I'm dead, fuckhead!".
 *  The bathroom, designed for, at the most, 5 warehouse workers over an
   8 hour workday, not 1 person per minute. The hardest working toilet
   in Northern California that night. A tip of the hat to the promoters
   for the extra toilet paper.
 *  Power provided by electrical hookups directly to the circuit breaker
   terminals. Car jumper cables! 
 *  Free grapefruit!
 *  Great crowd! Little knots of friends together, and free floaters like
   me. Nice mix of "hippies", ravers, het, homo, youngsters and a few 
   white haired folks.
    My apologies to the SFRaver who I met, the only part of your name I
   could hear was "..jah" - you remembered me from the picnic. 
    Ovid, Giamma, Neils - what were you wearing? Were any of you the guy
   with the tambourine? I was wearing a large purple tie-dye and white
   baggy pants. I was too late to the picnic to get a metal badge, so my
   SFRaves smiley is on a painted rectangle in a plastic name holder - the
   letters S F R are made of silvery aluminium foil.

   To summarize:          I HAD A GREAT TIME !


>DJs were supposedly "Josh, Noel, James, Paaa" ... anybody know who the 
>afro-american DJ with glasses was? He was really good.
>

 I want to know too! It was the first rave I've been to that I was both
willing and able to watch the DJ at work - very interesting! Even while
watching him switch from one cut to the next, I couldn't hear the segue!

to have footage from the raves going on in India. Of course, the admission fee
of $9 was also great (and what persuaded my ride to go to that instead of 
Feel-X). Well, the problem of the evening was that we got there really early
at about 9 PM and hung out for an hour, but I don't think a single other
person showed up. By then my friends were getting really restless and decided
to make the trip to the city to The Big Mistake (i.e. Felix). I don't want to
get into unnecesary details on that, but I actually did pay the $20 knowing
exactly what was going to happen. We never got to dance (a moment of silence...)
Anyway, I want to know details on the Floppy Solstice Thing! e-mail me direct
or if you're happy and you know it, tell the list. Bye!

Scott & Robbie haven't played Ressurection for the last two weeks and Gavin 
told me on Sunday that David who runs Ressurection wants them to spin for 
free from now on.  Which means that they will probably be at home sleeping 
on Sunday mornings and Ressurection will have the same bad techno that Goa Gil 
and Carlos have laying down.  Sometimes Carlos does have some good Salsa-House
 though he only plays a couple of songs of it.

Subject: my first "rave"

yes, my first night out.  caught the last bart from berkeley, got to the map
point for feel-x around 1:30.  the guy directed me to a corner a couple
blocks away and said to look for a place with a bunch of people standing
outside.  i went there and there were lots of people wandering around, trying
to figure out where to go.  (a police car drove by and the officer asked what
i was drinking.  he asked if it was beer.  i told him it was yogurt (which it
was) and he drove away.  seconds later, a few people walked by selling x and
marijuana.  are the cops missing something?)  so i walked back to the map point
and the guy was gone.  there were directions written down to the warehouse
and i was fortunate enough to hitch a ride with some very nice complete
strangers.  we got to feel-x in time to watch the police busting it up.  we
then went by carefree to drop some people off.  it looked pretty good, but
the people driving me seemed to think floppy's would be better.  since
sticking with them seemed easier than relying on taxis or public transportation,
i went with (oakland was my direction anyway).  we got there around 3.
dead, quite dead.  for only $9.  after taking 15 minutes to analyze that it
was indeed dead and that we had wasted our money, we left and called it an
early evening.  fortunately, my hosts were kind enough to drive me home, rather
than leaving me alone in oakland.  oh well, i guess there's always next week.

Subject: reviews ... Vortex, Care*Free, Reveille, Feel-X, GG Park

Last weekend I had a lot of fun!  I was showing my friend Will how I
like to sort of know what I'm going to before I go to it, and since I
don't know anyone well, my way of doing that is by actually going
everywhere and sort of peeking around the corners.

I heard Feel-X the Cat was going to be at Ggreg Taylor's house (source
nonexistant) and so thought to myself: how the **** are they going to
get the normal number of (questionable) people into a small (already
illegal?) space like Ggreg's without it getting busted?  When I heard
that, I was even more interested to find out how they were going to
handle that.  So, I went to the map point, then to the location, then
to the ticket pickup location.  The absolute best thing about it was
the people in all the places >before< the rave being really, really
nice to me and all when I was walking around -- I've been living off
of that energy for the last three or four days now.

I felt awful boycotting them but knew I was doing right going to the
Vortex map point.  A lady at Ameba said Vortex would be the best bet.
I think the fact that the recording wasn't working until two hours
before the rave had a positive effect.  It was way down 3rd St, and
even though the police circled all night I think they figured it was a
tame, good crowd inside since there weren't a million people there.
Well, inside the crowd size was just about perfect.  The house they
spun at first was kinda weird for me, so we left and checked out other
locations (whatever was in the 500 block of Howard on both sides was
no good from my reckoning, Care*Free looked hopping, and the crowd
that left Feel-X was really a trip; I heard they >ran< down Mission
St. to 339 Jessie St. -- it must have been great!  We saw the crowd
waiting for the doors to open at around 2AM, and Will was sort of
amused by that outside semiparty.)

When we got back to Vortex, I had a great time from about 3AM to
when it closed.  That was one of the best places to be that night for
sure.  The DJs James and Josh were great, as were the people.

Evil Eddie Richards was keeping Care*Free going past its usual, and I
loved going to that.  Is the crowd turning sour in the morning?

Reveille (at Bahia) had a great atmosphere.  It's definately the
after-place of choice; the food was decent (I mean, it was breakfast,
not just a garbage snack like at DNA), the music was great, and the
Bahia is a wonderful daylight atmosphere.  Only 30 people had gone
there, and they weren't there when we were.

Golden Gate Park was wonderful (if a bit chilly), and my friend and I
decided to go see what other stuff was happening and do some other
things.  I was disappointed to find the GG Park rave over when I got
back; I wondered where everyone had gone.  The place was cleaner than
any other spot in the park.

M.R.R. hasn't been mentioned much here, so I'll just leave it at that
and say that I heard it was absolutely great (wah!).

My conclusions:  All the Feel-X's I've been to (#3, #4, #5) have been
busted before 3AM; everything we went to was fun (even the various
Feel-X external points of interest), especially James, Josh, Eddie,
Bahia and the GG Park.

I think James is the name of the Vortex `afro' DJ with glasses (I
asked for his name, as well as Josh's).

About your first rave:  I think a lot of them are like that, you just
have to sort of muddle through.  The best thing I think is to ask
around and see what's best -- the right people to ask are the real
ravers, so pinpointing them is sort of a fun thing.  Just ask lots of
people what is good, and >why<, and you can probably sort out a better
evening than most people (who just ask a few of their friends and
figure out most things from the looks of the flyers and such -- a
fairly good method, but also prone to a bit of error).

Uhh, I thought I was the only person on SF Raves crazy enough to even
wonder what Feel-X was like?  I feel guilty for not warning against
it; I knew better all along.

PPPSs:
How was the cruise Sunday?

Downtown Donna (mostly at lesbian/gay places) is a good DJ for
me ... I'll try to catch her more often.

The all-dayer next weekend called Re-Union sounds good (ref: Ameba
guy), but I fear I'm going to have to miss most or all of that since
I'll be going to Pride Day (my first in SF -- I went to the Santa Cruz
Gay Pride day about three years ago and was disappointed.)

Wow...Ulmo's sure getting around...the one thing I went to that he
didn't get to was the Mission Rock thing on Sunday, and it really
was fun!  Visually, it wasn't as ravey as other things (no light show,
less ravewear), but the crowd was friendly, the DJ was good, and the
main dance area was outdoors, on a deck facing the bay.  Later in the
evening there was also a DJ spinning hiphop indoors downstairs, so the
overflow from the outside was getting into that.

Anyway, Saturday night looks to be a big rave night (maybe too many
different things going on!).  Magoo and Tang for the cost-conscious
($10 and $5, respectively), both look interesting; Re-Union for the
outdoors people; Where's Waldo and Higgledy Piggledy also look   
interesting.  What is this midnight Carnival thing?

Subject: my weekend

i went to toontown friday night.  wasn't expecting a whole lot, given
that it was toontown, but it was at Townsend, which is probably my
favorite club ever, and i was curious to hear evil eddie richards,
since his name is all over a lot of the Shamen stuff.  $15 charge -
not great, but needs must and all that.  i was surprised upon entering
to hear music that was pretty damn good.  the dance floor was not too
crowded at all - presumably the 21+ age restriction kept the crowd
density to a reasonable level.  it was hot and sweaty, but there was
room to move.  i like that.  they opened up the back room, and that
made a pleasant escape - being about 15 degrees cooler, and with a
completely different vibe and style of music.  watching evil ed
richards spin was a trip - the guy is *hot*!  i spent my time going
back and forth between the two floors, getting a wide variety of
beautiful blissful techno poured into my ears.  i also saw plenty of
people that i knew from past raves, so even if i didn't meet lots of
new friendly faces, it was very nice to chat with the old ones.

the event ended sort of early for me personally, since i had basically
burned myself out with three hours of nonstop bouncing around.  then
they closed the back room.  then jan cooley came on.  as mike said to
me, "you mix better than she does."  she played a lot of the wailing
diva crap that drives me absolutely bonkers, so i spent some time
walking around in early morning light and watching the taxicabs melt.

so.  toontown - who woulda thunk it?  instead of being a mediocre
night out, it turned into one of the nicest rave experiences i've had
in a while.

saturday i spent mostly recovering.  briefly considered vortex.  never
considered feel-x at all.  in the end, i wound up passed out by
midnight.

sunday turned into an adventure.  had breakfast with friends in the
castro, went for a walk in the park, more or less stumbled into the
rave by accident.  we spent a while hanging out there, but the DJ
wasn't really doing it for me, and it was rather cold and grey.  saw a
few familiar faces, and that's always nice.

sunday evening we hit DV8.  what a crushing disappointment.  the sound
system and lights were fine, but the DJ (buck, i believe) was the
absolute pits.  he was playing really low energy techno stuff, teasing
the crowd with bits of the real popular songs, but never really
getting into a groove.  it was just plodding and monotonous.  we hung
out there for a little while and left, disappointed.

next week - my birthday rave...!

> Sometimes Carlos does have some good Salsa-House
> though he only plays a couple of songs of it.

At Creation, I found that Carlos' spinning "out back" was the best music of
the entire rave. He did spin some salsa-ish stuff that I liked alot.

This is probably a tall order -- where can one find compilations of salsa
house? I've been thinking of throwing some Mongo Santamaria, Tito Puente,
Willie Bobo, Ray Baretto etc through a sampler to see what I come up with.
Might be better to hear what others have done in this realm first....

			--------------------

(2) So is the rave scene in Goa still happeing? I've been meaning to get
back to india one of these years, and a bit of raving by the beach might
make for a nice respite from the typical tourist jive. After all, if you've
seen one Taj Mahal, you've seen 'em all. :-)

			--------------------

(3) I found myself in Palo Alto CD shopping after work yesterday. Stopped
by "CD Land" on University ave and picked up a most excellent import CD
compilation. At $20.99, price was a bit steep. On the other hand, you get
pristine CD-quality classic funk with some mixes that diverge from the
original LP in nifty way -- "our only criteria was to use the most
interesting mixes available, to avoid the readily available records and
present tham as the clubs and sound systems did..."

So if your sick of jerkin' it, instead of workin' it, you're feeling stoned
to the bone and all that techno don't do nothin but chrome yer dome, your
booty-bone will thank you for bringin' it all back home....

"at the time it was called "futuristic" -- quite correctly too, as almost
20 years later, the record is a much sought after rave track...."

Subject: Some ruminations

It's not uncommon for people who are involved in their first underground
music culture to become True Believers in it.  Some of the thinking ones,
as they get older and live through successive such movements become more
relativistic (ie. mellow with age).

Despite the claims for rave being non-exclusive, I've seen a number of
postings in the fairly recent past that very strongly remind me of the
`disco sucks' posturing which precipitated the `classic rock radio' now
so inescapable all over the country.  Techno, apparently, is the One True
Music (*derivative* though it is).  More chilling, perhaps, is what
I perceive as a strong misogynist undercurrent, not too different from
the most distasteful of the metalheads, headbangers and rappers out there.

To avoid (I hope) having this lead to some kind of pissing contest, the
following quotes are included without attribution:

> Within the realm of techno, I tend to like the stuff that sounds like
> it was made by a berserk Kraftwerk or, better yet, a computer - no human
> intervention.  I tend not to like stuff with piano breaks or house divas
> ("shut the f*ck up bitch, you can't sing").

Since she's not being submissive & quiet, like a good girl, why not give her
a good whack, eh?

> then jan cooley came on.  as mike said to me, "you mix better than she
> does."  she played a lot of the wailing diva crap that drives me absolutely
> bonkers, so i spent some time walking around in early morning light and

Now, obviously, peoples tastes run differently, but when I see statements
like this, I can't help read them as misogynist at least, potentially
racist (many of those `wailing divas' are black - is *that* the problem?),
or possibly full-bore misanthropic like the S&D (shit & death) crowd

The other trap that the underground music True Believer tends to fall into
is the attitude that less-commercial = aesthetically, intellectually or
morally superior.  F'rinstance:

So as art, this music has value only insofar as the great (presumaby philistine)
masses show no interest, or even better, evidence outright dislike?

And then there are the soul-searching questions and partial answers:

Well, it might be the `outsiders' and it might not.  My money goes with NOT.
I've seen this very exclusivity and elitism in every underground music 
movement I've known.  My conclusions, from years of observation, are that
it is usually the younger (first-time) scenesters that get so dogmatic
about things, and, ironically, often put their noses up at the precursors
of the very things they hold so dear.  The musicians, on the other hand,
tend to be more open, and aware of how deep the roots go, and how wide 
they spread.

There's no way around this problem.  It always happens.  The scene will
eventually fade.  The dogmatists will grow up and lose their blinders.
But by then, there'll be a new crop of experimentalists and their
True Believing followers.  BFD.

Well, that is a very interesting response set to my note. I was not slamming
Ce Ce Petiston, I happen to hum along to  Finally a lot, and to others in
that vein. This is not the problem - I object to it being marketed as "new"
and as "techno" because it is not really either. All I was saying is this
- putting songs like this on a disk billed as techno is gonna dismay those
who were looking for something else, true techno, and may cause others to
call songs like "Finally" (which has been around for what, 4 months or more?)
techno when it really isn't. Yes, they have the inalienable right to call
it how they dam well please, and I won't quibble with someone who voices
that opinion in my presence, but I won't agree with them either, unless it
was one heck of a remix. I just am questioning the record companies' motives
in putting stuff like this on a disk, when they could be using valuable space
to put truly original new stuff on a disk, and therefore satisfy the needs
of the lonely isolated midwesterner....

I submit that your perceptions misogyny and racism say far more about
you than they do about me or any of the other posters on this thread.
I will endeavor to justify this attitude throughout the rest of the

the original writer wasn't saying anything about hitting the woman, (s)he
quite clearly wrote "*I* tend not to like..." which is about as fair
and impartial a statement as you could hope for.  i find your
inference of misogyny rather insulting to the original writer in fact.

who's forcing you?  can't you think for yourself or are you
brainwashed by the PC movement?

>racist (many of those `wailing divas' are black - is *that* the problem?),

that's my quote up there.  again, i qualified my statement as heavily
as i thought it needed to be reasonably interpreted by human beings
with at least a minimum standard of intelligence, to whit: "that
wailing diva crap that drives *me* absolutely bonkers."  i wholly
resent your implications that i am misogynystic or racist.  as it
transpires, there aren't any records in my collection by black women
singers, but that's not through any program of deliberate misogyny or
racism on my part.  i just don't enjoy that style of music.

>From which I guess we can conclude that `nosebleed techno' has

>so one should feel guilty for indulging in them.

more inference on your part.  i saw nothing in the original quote
that would lead inevitably to your conclusion.  you do it again right
here:

>So as art, this music has value only insofar as the great (presumaby
>philistine) masses show no interest, or even better, evidence
>outright dislike?

you seem to be superimposing your own personal agenda over this whole
thread and i, for one, really resent it.  you may apologize at your
earliest convenience.

>Well, it might be the `outsiders' and it might not.  My money goes with NOT.
>I've seen this very exclusivity and elitism in every underground music 
>movement I've known.

everyone is an outsider at some point.  my argument was that the
outsiders become insiders and then start to like the feeling of
insiderness too much, to the detriment of the scene.  you said almost
exactly the same thing right here:

>My conclusions, from years of observation, are that it is usually the
>younger (first-time) scenesters that get so dogmatic about things,
>and, ironically, often put their noses up at the precursors of the

we are in agreement on this point. it's almost like you're not reading
very carefully.

>The musicians, on the other hand, tend to be more open, and aware of
>how deep the roots go, and how wide they spread.

i'm a certified musician and beautiful person (first techno single out
Any Day Now) so of course i'm aware of the roots.  doesn't mean shit
about my liking diva music (as i call it).  this call for tolerance of
all musical styles always reminds me of one of my favorite incidents
in the jazz world, when charles mingus said of ornette coleman, "that
dude couldn't play a straight c major scale." (paraphrased from
memory).  some people just don't Get It.  maybe they just don't Like
It.  i demand that my right not to { Get | Like } It be respected.  is
there any reason in the world why i *must* enjoy diva music?  as long
as i don't interfere with the rights of the musicians to produce it
and the public to consume it as they wish, i don't see the problem.
it's like pete townsend said about rap: "it's not up to us to like it,
it's not up to us to understand it, it's up to us to just get the hell
out of the way." (paraphrased from memory)

i hope my points are painfully clear now.

	I see two sides to the whole exclusivity thing. On the one hand
	the scene should be open to anyone and everyone who is interested.

I've been on the list now for a couple of weeks, meaning to check out the

friend is out visiting from Boston who is eager to rave and we are thinking
of hip-hopping up to the City this Friday or Saturday night.

Clearly we should avoid Feeline the Catatonic-- what's a good place to start
actively *not* avoiding, ie, where is a good intro place to go.  We're in
this to DANCE not be spectators, but we're not exactly the most in-shape of

Sorry 'bout the semi-bungled attempt at cross-posting, folks.  As a result,
I managed to spawn two separate threads with the post.  

First, I'd like to thank the person who wrote

At least one person understood what I was trying to say.  It was a pleasant
antidote to the one who really *did* want to goad me into a pissing contest.
Most other responses fell somewhere in between.

Here are a few brief replies to some of what's come out of this.

RE: The lead-off ...

>> [Despite the claims for rave being non-exclusive,] I've seen a number of

> Er, are you talking about raves, the events or techno, the music?

No.  I was talking about electronic mail originated by ravers.

RE: Getting personal ...

Perhaps, but what exactly do they say?

> can't you think for yourself or are you brainwashed by the PC movement?

I can't think for myself.  I am a brainwashed vegetarian clone. :)  Someday I
will grow up, see the error of my ways and bow down to Georges Will and Bush.

RE: Aesthetics vs misogyny etc ...

> the original writer [...] quite clearly wrote "*I* tend not to like..." which
> is about as fair and impartial a statement as you could hope for.  i find
> your inference of misogyny rather insulting to the original writer in fact.

The original writer quite clearly wrote "Shut the fuck up, bitch, you can't
sing", which is about as far from fair and impartial as one might get.

> Trying to decide which music has inherent value and which does not is a
> pretty futile exercise. However, everyone has an opinion which they're going

My reactions are not to people's aesthetic choices, but to their attitudes.
For instance, I don't like most reggae, but were I to express this by saying
something like "Shut the fuck up, nigga, you can't play", quite clearly I would
go beyond aesthetics and into racial antagonism.

RE: Exclusivism ...

A number of people have made statements to the effect of 

> the outsiders become insiders and then start to like the feeling of
> insiderness too much, to the detriment of the scene.

It is this very scene-xenophobia which first-time scenesters often exhibit.
They *love* their scene, and want it to go on forever, unchanged.  But life
isn't like that.  Every scene evolves and fades.  Which is OK, really.  Because
if it did in fact stay the same for too long, the scenesters themselves would
sense the stagnation and leave the fold.  Evolution and change are the forces
of good - they keep things interesting.

RE: Cooptation, the Dead, etc ...

It seems to me that all this worry about cooptation is a little misplaced.
Would it not be fair to see raving itself as coopted acid house in the first
place?

> The parallels with GDead culture are staggering

Oh, absolutely.  But one can also make credible comparisons with the Hawkwind
and Gong scenes in 70s Europe.  The 60s (US) band Kaleidoscope also comes to
mind, but since they never "hit", it's more of a stretch.

> from a vaguely grassroots phenomenon to a marketable commodity, except that
> it tooks the Gratefuls 20 odd years to sell out their subculture.

Oh, I don't think it took them anywhere near that long.  They were quite 
clearly a business by the mid 70s, when I first saw them.  On the other hand,
you might ask the Deadheads themselves if they feel "sold out."  The True
Believing ones I've known never did.

RE: Forced Exposure ...

>> [...] full-bore misanthropic like the S&D (shit & death) crowd promoted by
> Forced Exposure et al.

> Urm, FE sure gets bashed on the net a lot.

I didn't know that.  I started bashing them off-line in the mid-late 80s.
"Shit & death" is my original coinage, inspired by their principal fascinations
at the time.  A local friend of mine, who promotes honk/tweet jazz and other
free improv musics, also a freeform radio DJ at the time (WMFO) who did mind
melting on-air mixes, liked this so much, he shortened it to "S&D", which I
think has a nice ring to it.

> the stuff they really get all gooey over tends to be [list of innocuous
> musics deleted here].

Musta changed a little since I stopped reading them.  I got sick of putting
my head in their toilet.

> ignore dance music.

I can't speak for the net, and I don't give a shit whether or not they cover
dance music.  I dislike glorifications of rape, snuff films, and "black puh."

Anyhoo ...

Have fun, folks (and try to stay open).

i'm sorry that life is that way in SLC.  just proves yet again that
you should move up to san francisco and hang with us naturally high
people!  what invariably happens at raves with dumb bars up here is
that you have some to a lot of drinkers until 2 AM at which point the
liquor licenses expire.  usually the raves really begin to cook around
that point, as the remaining ravers are the serious "dance and have a
good time til the sun comes up" crowd.

could you adopt a "no alcohol after 2 AM" policy?  this way you'd get
the money from people coming early and then from 2 AM on you'd have a
better atmosphere...

>So what it comes down to is I don't know who to target.  The people with booze

my intuitive response is "without."  but if this will really make
nobody show up then i don't know what you can do.  one thing you might
want to ask yourself is: it worth it to have a big warehouse full of
decidedly un-ravey people?  i mean, you could give out free beer and
fill an aircraft hangar full of bodies, but is it worth doing?  as i
keep saying, the magic of the rave scene is the *people*.  none of the
people i've met through the rave scene are big drinkers.  coincidence?

as ever, it's quantity vs quality.  unfortunately you *do* need a
minimum quantity in order to make your event financially viable.  and
you have to make it so people *want* to come.  so it looks like a
classic catch-22 situation.

anybody have any ideas?

Look, as someone once said, on matters of taste there is no argument. What
people like depends on so many things that empirical judgements of song A
being definitely unequivocally better than song B are silly. So some of
us don't consider songs with wailing house divas to be particularly heavy
or mindwarping like other forms of techno; that doesn't mean we're racist.

I found of copy of this somewhere on Haight Street (Reckless Records, 
maybe?).  I'm not sure what # issue it was, but it was kind of flimsy.
It had 8 pages, I think, mostly charts and a few reviews.  There
were several different charts like "U.S.Rave Top 30" and "Techno Top 30"
and "Rave Top 30" -- don't ask me how they classified each record, but
the charts were different.  

I guess it's mostly useful just for getting names of things to listen
to at BPM; I think it's a tricky way for the publishers to get free
records from labels (if they are indeed getting any).  

Very little copy of interest; there was a half-page on Northern California
written by DJ Digit (i think)...he mentions Twitch as something to look
for :)

This is for you techno hippie djs.  Tons of top 10 list from
various djs and stores.  I only got the first issue and it
had a great interview of Moby.  Also lots of techno reviews
and record/cd store advertisements.  I got this last October
and I haven't seen the 2nd issue.  This is their introduction:

Welcome to the first issue of U.S. Rave.  We are dedicated to
seeking out and finding the underground tracks that matter and
letting our readers know whats up.  As the rave culture from UK
is slowly being absorbed adn welcomed in the us, we are here
right along with it, helping to light the path for djs and
stores that will make a difference.  In our comming issues we
hope to have expanded west coast coverage and uk correspondents,
as well as our cutting edge charts which will serve as valuable
reference tools for the dj's that matter.

It's written for a slightly broader audience than just ravers or techno per se.
Lotsa reviews.

They don't. That's the wonderful difference between the drugs that are done
at raves and the drugs that are done at most other social gatherings. I don't
want to sound like I'm promoting drug use... but I'd rather people used
those drugs than alcohol at any gathering. It makes people much more open 
about their feelings, much more excited about life around them, more energetic,
which is fairly opposite from what I see with alcohol or cocaine or speed.
People don't give you intimidating stares when you look at them; they don't
believe in striking poses or carrying attitudes.

I'm not suggesting you take drugs if you go - I went to raves in LA for
2 years without doing a single thing, and had a ball. And I can still
go to a rave completely sober and dance for 5 hours, relying purely on
the NRG of others and the DJ's. I'd even go so far as to say a good
rave is one so good you think you're on drugs but you're completely clean.
Of course, this has a lot to do with your personal mindset, but drugs wouldn't
change that too much. 

You're perfectly safe at a rave if you go clean. There might be quite a few 
people trying to sell you X, but once you get by them, you're fine. I've never
had any peer pressure to take hallucinogens. It's just not in their nature...
just like when people take LSD or X, they say, "man this is great stuff!"
whereas a cocaine user will say, "man this shit is RAW! I need more now!".
A lot of people on alt.drugs will probably agree. I've had people say,
"if only you could see what I'm seeing now...", but never, "C'mon! It's your
turn to take a shot of vodka! You hoser." like I hear at dorm parties. Fun.

I heard a statistic that sounds about right for the average rave: 30% are
on drugs, and another 30% think they're on drugs. If you find that you really
like raves, really enjoy the music and get off on the energy and the visuals,
I might even venture to say that the drugs don't help you much. They make it
easier to dance for 7 or 8 hours straight, but unless you take enough to start
seeing bright visuals, not too much is different (at least, that's been my 
experience - mileage may vary). And what's the point of going to a rave if 
you're just gonna sit and trip the whole night?

Raves are the only social gatherings I know of where individual creativity of
the participant is rewarded. I have no hesitation to enter a place when it 
first opens and if the music's cool start dancing right away, or when the
place gets crowded jumping on top of a speaker and dancing until security knabs
me. Uh-oh I'm getting romantic.... this is getting cross-posted to sfrave
because I want to hear their reaction, too....

Probably that they will have future sex but have already had past sex.

   Hopefully you will not dismiss any attempt at explaining or clarifying
 quotations as an invitation to a 'pissing contest'.
  
   Unfortunately I had discarded my original post that you took a quotation
 out of, the one about noisy techno and not liking wailing divas most of the
 time.  Jon Drukman responded  


>> the original writer [...] quite clearly wrote "*I* tend not to like..." which
>> is about as fair and impartial a statement as you could hope for.  i find
>> your inference of misogyny rather insulting to the original writer in fact.

   Insulting especially since your inference of misogyny is based on:

>The original writer quite clearly wrote "Shut the fuck up, bitch, you can't
>sing", which is about as far from fair and impartial as one might get.

   Notice that this phrase is in quotes.  This phrase is a lyric from a song
 by N.Y. Style.  By quoting this line I meant to draw reference to the music
 of this track which is noisy, fast, etc. in short a perfect example of the
 type of techno that I like as described in the paragraph I was writing.  
 Since this article was posted to a 'raves' newsgroup, I figured that most
 people reading it would be familiar with the track and realize that it was
 a quote from a song and not an expression of a personal opinion.  Obviously,
 I was wrong.

   Perhaps the makers of this track are misogynistic, I have no idea.

Brief review of FUTURE-SEX:

I wasn't expecting a lot and I think I was right. The all thing was
pretty bad and also boring. I had fun anyway thanks to my friends and
a lot of SFRavers (Derek, Niels, Eric, Joe, Mike, Jon, Marco).

Location: Martini. I like the place, may be because I've been to a couple
	of Come/Unity and I loved it but also because they have the
	best lights system that I've seen.

Music: besides two or three songs, was just regular club-music:
	I forgot how boring this music is. There was a lack of whistles
	as well (I usually get sick of them but I miss them when they
	are absent).

Performances: I didn't see anything that I haven't seen before to others
	raves or shows (sort of Hyperdelic video, chill out room with
	headphone to rent, half-naked dancing girls). There was the same
	girl with swords that was dancing with R.U. Serius at the
	Mondo 2000 thing a month ago (Delirioum Accident) and also this
	time her performance was pretty gross and WAY to long.

Crowd: mostly regular clubbers (yuppish and downtownish kinda of people).
	Besides us I din't recognize any raves.

Overall it was a bad organized thing because most of the people walk out
without any particular interest in the magazine (there were no free
issues available: at least with MONDO 2000 parties you can get a free
copy easyly)

Tonight I'm gonna take a break and I will try to make up my mind for
tomorrow.
	RE-UNION or WALDO or anything else ???

I just spoke to one of the owners of Zanzibar -- looks like the
Sunday morning after-parties there are but a memory.  It turns out
that with the warm weather, too many people just hang out in the
park next to the club, drawing complaints from the locals, and not
making their multi-colored cash register kick into gear enough.

All things must pass, I guess, but there are lots of other Sunday

Yeah, the music kinda sucked. Had me thinking and saying, "bjeezus we'll
dance to anything, won't we". That was around the time I decided I was
mostly there to ravercise! (See my upcoming self-improvement book,
"Ravercise & Raverobics -- How I lost 10 pounds in one night" for details
:-). I mean, I paid $8.00 so I wasn't about to go out like some kind of
sucker...

What? You mean you weren't into the way she mock- went-down on the chick
lieing beneath her, then sucked some fake- menstrual-fluid out of a plastic
bag that happened to be placed at the chick's crotch and then spewed it
towards the audience?

Gee, I thought that spelled *ART* in 30-foot-high gothic letters covered
with ivy and cherubs hovering wistfully in the breeze.

So I guess I kinda liked it, for the same reasons that I like watching
professional wrassling championships, watching postapocalyptic dyke-bimbo
kung-fu movies and/or reading joe-bob-briggs....

Summary: 40 breasts. sword-fu. Mock-Menstrual-fu.  Contortionist-fu.
Multiple mock-aardvarking.

Message: (1) future sex means that you'll have to watch nekkid wanna-be
valkyrie women lappin' at the cane-toad of love and blowing spew on each
other while attempting to reenact the dominant/submissive role. (2) Future
sex is when you have to wrap nekkid women in cellophane and then pretend
yer aaardvarking ontop of the cellophane. (Yes, this pretty much happened
on stage).

I didn't find it particularly badly organized. It was just one of those
semi-lame SF art-thangs (aka any excuse to party). The sorta shindig that
goes on simply because those things are supposed to happen in a real city.
I take that kinda shit at face value (i.e. it will probably be cheezy) and
try to enjoy myself best i can... 

It was the first time i've been to martinis when they had the full space
open (i've only gone there for come/unity). that was kinda cool. i wish
they opened up the full space for come/unity -- the last one was too
crowded.

No.  I think you handled yourself quite reasonably, in fact.

What I meant by 'pissing contest' was the tendency in electronic conversation,
if one says something controversial vis a vis prior postings, for things to 
rapidly degenerate into a battle of personalities.  As Brian Behlendorf 
succinctly put it, "you bite no you bite no you bite ...".  I knew when I made
the first posting that there was a danger of this happening (which outcome I
really did not want).  That was why I  stripped off all attributions from the
quotes.  I wanted to talk about language and attitudes.  I did not want to 
attack anybody personally, nor did I want to engage anybody in such an
exchange.

In that I obviously failed to accomplish this end, I am quite sorry.

I also tried to hedge my statements pretty thoroughly.  If you look at the 1st
post, you'll see all sorts of qualifiers, eg. "perhaps", "possibly" and so on.
I was trying to say this-is-how-this-stuff-looks-to-me, and initiate some
enlightening discussion of those issues.  That, for the most part, was not the
outcome.

Electronic communication is *so* difficult.  People reading the written word
in a news program will often miss subtleties of language , and read only the
bluntest possible interpretation of one's words.  Neither is it easy to
convey one's true personality, nor emotional state at the time of writing.
There are a couple of people on sfraves who know me rather well, for whom the
interpretation of my writings is probably a lot easier.  I trust they could
tell that I was not frothing at the mouth at the time.  Actually I was very
calm and trying to write in a clear, but reasoned way.

As for my "inference of misogyny," what I was saying was that there was a
certain kind of posting that I'd been seeing go by in my mailbox, that *I*
perceived as misogynist.  The song quote "Shut the fuck up bitch, you can't
sing" quite plainly struck me as offensive.  It still does.  And I'm sure that
if you look at it as someone who never heard that song, you should also be 
able to see it as an offensive piece of verbiage.  Is it my fault for not 
knowing it was a song quote?  Does it *really* make a difference that it is?

You yourself may be a perfectly wonderful person.  I certainly hope that is
the case.  It was not my intent to talk about *you*, anyway.  

I'm sorry you took this personally.  I'm sorry Jon Drukman did the same.  If
we could talk about these issues without hurling accusations at one another,
I think there would be *at least* one interesting discussion in the points I've
raised, and more likely some three or more good threads.  Unfortunately, this
does not seem to be possible, so I'd just as soon let it drop, and try to be
friends if that can be accomplished at this point.

Last Night, my roommate went down to Rose to check this out (the Top was our 
favorite bar) and found something at 30 Rose St.  which he describes as a 
large open space with a bar (not being worked last night) playing good music
on a rather small stereo.  He had a good time, describing it as more of a 
friendly party-like atmosphere than anything else.  It's also free.  Highly 
recommended as a place to hang out in the week, although not too many people
were there last night, he said.  Also, they're going to have parties 
(gatherings?) starting around midnight weekend nights which apparently will 
also be free or cheap at most.  I'm going to try to get down there tonight
to check it out since they had a list of the DJ's who will spin.

Howdy.

In case anyone is listening late, I'm heading out to the russian
river Re-Union tonite.  I think that there will never be a shortage
of warehouse raves, and since this is sunset-sunset outdoors, I think
this could be killer.  Especially if it is anything like the last
russian river rave, in which Ernie was spinning cross-legged on the sand
on a beach, people dancing in the sun, swimming in the river, swinging
on rope swings, all with great techno in the background.

I talked to the guy at Amoeba yesterday, and it really sounds like he's
got it together, having already gotten an OK from the sherriff up there
and all.  I CANT WAIT, I just hope it is anything near as cool a scene
as it was last time.

One caveat: I have not been to a party at the Jack London club in
Oakland (site of the Mr. Floppy's) in the last 3 months that has
been any good.  In my opinion, that place is dead; there is never
more than a handful there.  I think people just got sick of it.
Beware.

Have fun!  Anyone at the river look for someone in overalls, doc's,
and a blue hat going crazy!

Sounds exactly like what happened to the Casa in LA a long time ago... it
was a cool place, a ballroom-cum-warehouse-cum-perfect-rave-environment,
with underground passageways and a two-story main dance floor, and more.
But again. people got sick of it because there was always a rave there
EVERY week. People just burned out, and want to try new things (like aircraft
hangars, water slide parks, etc...)

Subject: Where's Waldo ? !BZZZT!


-- 

 I got to "Where's Waldo" at about 11:30. Cost was $20, including a discount
coupon to an upcoming rave called "hardkiss' mid-summer night's dream", to be
held on thursday, july 2nd @ 520 4th st. , san francisco. [ But, when I got
home, I found out that Atomic is suppossed to be there on that date - same
rave, two different names? The Atomic flyer doesn't list Hardkiss as a DJ ] 

 The dancing was in an aircraft hanger. Opposite the hanger, there was a smart
bar ( Chris') , jewelry, day-glo painting, the IF folk's candy booth, some
other group's table, and the port-o-sans. Like at Vortex, there was a garden 
faucet available for folks who didn't want to buy drinks. No free ice, tho'.

 The hanger's sheet metal walls were audibly vibrating to the music. As the
hanger doors were open, it was initially cool inside the hanger. As more  
people showed up ( and as I danced ), the interior got warm enough for me to 
remove my corduroy shirt and put it in away in my truck.

 Nice crowd mix, although not as many "older" folks as last week's Vortex. 
I managed to meet more SFRavers - Derek, Niels, Giamma, Mike W, and Chris at
the smart bar, and some folks whose names I can't remember right now. 

 While the music was good, I finally left when the sound system started 
producing occasional bursts of 60/120 cycle hummmm (BZZZT!) . This problem
started at around 1:15. I finally left at around 2:00, as it seemed that the
problem was getting worst (BZZZZZZZT!!!).
 
 On my way home, I decided to check out the club rave at One Step Beyond in
Santa Clara ( the "It - Meditation" rave ). However, they wanted $12.00, and
I didn't feel like paying it. So, home to bed I went ( anybody go to it? ).

I went to Re-Union Sat.  Didn't see any sfr people and it sounds like you 
all went to Where's Waldo?.  Did you find him?  Re-Union was cool but it
wasn't very big.  I got there around 3:00 a.m. and stayed until about 
10:00 a.m.  I had to leave early to come here (work).  The dance floor
wasn't very crowded most of the time and the DJs were playing a lot of
house and not as much techno (I think it was Josh and Moonpup who were on
while I was there).  People were friendly, especialy when it started getting
light and we could actualy see each other.  I met some cool people who
live here in B-town and intermitently danced, walked around, talked, and
partied.  An over-all good time.  Glad I went.  Could have been better.
I would have liked to have stayed for the blueberry pancakes they were
whipping up when I left.  I heard that when some friends of mine were in
the shuttle van to leave (after I had left) the driver was kinda spun and
he backed up into a parked truck.  Then he went forward, crashing into a 
port-a-san that had a girl in it and she cut her head or something.  I don't
know how bad or anything because I haven't talked to these friends yet but
if it's worth reporting (or would that be re-reporting?) I'll let ya guys/
gals know.  Apparently my friends made him stop and got out and hitched a
ride because of his driving.  Hmmmmm.

Subject: My review of FUTURE

This is a story about FUTURE (and my place in it)
-------------------------------------------------

	I live in Pittsburgh.  I took off to DC with a friend of mine around
4:00 PM on Saturday.  On our rush to make it to both Urban Outfitters and
Commander Salamander (we didn't know they closed late), we got ticketed going
81 MPH and my friend Mike, the driver, was fined $156.  Great start.
	We finally made it to Georgetown and shopped around a bit.  I managed
to buy a really cool short sleeve purple/grey plaid Freak Show shirt.  Then
we dined in luxury at the local Hardees (or was it Roy Rogers...).  Afterwards
we met up with some friends of ours who had lost us when we were pulled over
earlier in the day (it was pure luck we found them).  We all got in our cars
and headed off for the *big* event.
	We made it to the BrandyWine Road (the final one) around 11:00.  There 
was aboput a 15 minute wait in the car on the road becaueause of traffic.  This
served to heighten our excitement levels.  Eventually we pulled up into the
grass parking lot and hastily made our way to the ticket trailer.  3 minutes
and $13 short later, we walked into the FUTURE.  
	Our journey began with a trip into the park's "buliding" (for cookouts,
bingo, etc).  It was full of about 200 people or so, milling around and 
checking each other out.  They had an *incredible* colored oil projection
going on the back wall and some girl was running a projector showing some       
fairly entertaining computer animations.  A dj was spinning some laid back deep
house.  At first I thought this was it, that this was *the* rave.  I heard some
people talking about "something going on out back".  My friend Mike and I 
made our way to the back entrance.  Coming out on the porch, we saw the action
going on in fullEffect.  There was a large area cleared away that was filled
with about 1500 people (at least).  A large stage was set up with tons of 
lasers and lights, and extending out past that was a collection of steel
scaffolding that held intellibeams, more lasers, etc.  Pretty damn cool.  The
only problem with the lasers was the fact thatthe fog machines weren't getting
the fog high enough to show off the lasers full range.  The laser beams looked
about 3 feet long.  There was a "moon bounce" in one corner of the rave area,
and surround everything was a collection of little vendor booths.  
Considering I had only been to one other "real" rave (Catastrophic Prodx), I
was damn excited about what I was seeing.
	To summarize the nights events, I'll keep it short.  We walked around
and checked out all of the vendors (throughout the course of the evening my
friend bought a smart drink, Sjobeck hat and a Sjobeck tee.  I picked up a
Drawls stocking cap).  Neither of us felt like jumping around on teh moon
bounce.  It was getting cold and the thought of that cold, dirty air pillow
under my feet didn't move me.  The crowd started out full of energy.  Everyone
was throwing their hands in the air and yelling "Do it!", "Fuck it Up!" and
other assorted phrases.  I was surprised by the number of people wearing
huge ass clothes.  I mean, I thought my clothes were big, but some of these
people were just SooperBaggy.  Also, I must have seen at least 20 different
Jive shirts, and I got sick (and jealous) looking at all the cool stuff people
had on.  Anyway, two of the acts (Disintigrator and Merge) sucked rocks, A
Priori had some interesting dancers and music (the vocalist blew) and Moby
was incredible.  He threw his keyboard around and jumped all over the stage.
The only problem was that his mic kept kicking out on him.  Oh well, he sounded
good and the song "Next is the E" was fucking great!
	DJ wise, I was VERY VERY *unimpressed*.  Joey Beltram was announced to
come on, but he just wandered around a little bit, talked to some people who 
were on the stage, and left.  He never performed (and APOTHEOSIS never perford either BTW.  That seriously pissed me off).  Oh, I almost forgot.  Euphoria
played a set at Future also.  It was fairly cool, but he came on stage and said
this *really* stupid phrase : "This is the closest to Woodstock you'll eveer    
get".  Yeah, right (BTW, Euphoria is from Pittsburgh, my hometown).  As
I was saying, the DJ's really blew.  They played "hardcore" techno.  I don't
know what planet these people are getting their music from, but it sucks.
Most of it sounded like a droning synth rolling over a boring ass Chick-Boom-
Chick-Boom beat.  Seriously, I love stuff like ACEN "Close Your Eyes", Power
Zone's "Mind Games" and  Kane's "Mind of Kane", and I thought that this was
"rave" music.  It is fun to dance to.  The shit I was listening too just 
bored the hell out of me.  Maybe if I was high on anti-freeze....
	To close out the story, I spent a lot of time just standing around.
The vibe was dead early on (right after Moby).  A lot of people were standing
around and shivering (it was *cold*).  I was hungry and I wanted to leave.
Standing in a dirt patch at 4:30 in the morning, freezing my ass of and
listening to a droning sound coming from the stage was just plain annoying.
Mike and I headed into the pavilion where the other Dj was (and oil proj. AND
heat) and checked things out.  While Mike went in search of a drink, I crouched
next to the wall and listeneed to the music.  10 minutes later, a cop shows
up and turns on all the lights and cuts the power to the DJ area.  
Immediately some guy runs up to the cop and they start yelling at each other.
Moments later, the guy is telling everyone to "go tell the cop that you want
your money back..and so on".  The cop leaves and some guy goes over and turns
the DJ power back on.  They dj throws on a *killer* remix of "I'm Free" and
everyone starts dancing like crazy.  The lights eventually go off and the dj
continues into Rabbit City's "Digital Domain" and Oceanic's "Insanity".  Mike
and I have *finally* found where the good music was.  About that time, the
cop comes back and turns the lights on again.  Mike and I agree to go see if
Apotheosis is playing out back on the main grounds (BTW, the song was 
"Everybody's Free" not "I'm Free").  The guard at the back door tells us that
if we "step over the line (back door line) than we *cannot* come back in".
Mike and I are like "what the fuck?" and we decide that we are going to go out front, head around the building and see if Apotheosis is on.  We have to
wade through about 200 people standing out front of the pavilion waiting to
get in (apparently they heard that the dj was playing some good dancey stuff).
As we round back, we see that the rave is *dead*.  The sun is up, and the
zombies were just milling around the grounds.  Mike and I stumble back to the
car and drive away.  On our way out we see two police cruisers headed toward
the pavilion.  Oh well.  I spent the rest of the morning sleeping for four
hours in the parking lot of a Pizza Hut.  Upon awaking, we drove to Georgetown
where I blew even more money on a Freak Show jacket (and some sorely needed
food).  The four hour trip home to Pittsburgh then begins....
	Basically, the rave was mediocre.  It was cold, dirty, and 2 out of
the three acts I came to see (Apotheosis and Beltram) didn't perform.  The 
vibe was *definitely* wasn't there (unless you were high or tripping).
There were some friendly people, but for the most part I couldn't relate to
most of them (They are like half-people.  They just aren't down-to-earth).
The music only got good at the end when I was falling asleep where I stood.
Oh well, a rave is a rave.  Any one else out there go to this?

Subject: 30 Rose and Gay Day (no connection)

Hi everyone!
	Well I went and checked out the thing at 30 Rose on saturday...I went
in expecting a kinda mellow place like the Top was, and from my Roomate's 
description, a low-key type of party.  I was wrong...

#include "vague.description"
That place is cool.

There was no cover, they just asked for donations.  As near as I could tell, 
the lights were the same as at resurrection.  They also had a sort of TOPY/
Psychic TV video shrine against one wall, a large sit-and-chill area with
a gel/slide projector setup.  They had a bar with the typical expensive beer/
wine/mix drinks, plus smart drinks.  There was some truly good hard techno
mixes coming from a pair of DAT's that made up the sound source for a stereo
which was adequate at least for the space.  The place was more like a mini
rave (a tiny Townsend?) than anything else.  It was larger than the Top was,
but it got enough people later in the evening so it didn't seem vacant.  The
only SFRaver I met there was Brad, but I wasn't being extremely social...I
recommend this place to hang out, at least on Sat. nights.

Did any of you catch the Gay Day Parade?  I got downtown just as it was coming into full force (on my way to work :( ).  The reason I ask is that the truck
carrying Colossal had a cool sound system playing some pretty good music.  The
posing leather dudes were throwing a bunch of flyers around, and I got one...
It was a flyer for Tang, of which there are now several thousand scattered 
around Market St.  Who puts Tang on?  This is more coverage than ToonTown even.

Anyway, gotta go....

Subject: Outlands - Colorado

Just got back from the My Bloody Eardrums weekend in Denver, Colorado.  I went
out to see MBV (you'll have to read that review on the other lists), but also
managed to have a raving (sort of) good time while I was at it.

They were having their first outdoor rave, "Outlands" there.  So I went to the
map point and got my pass and map for the night of raving on the 28th.  Then I
made the mistake of letting my plastic lure me into Wax Trax.  I picked up
some VICIOUS compilations including the BEST piece of trance I've found yet.
Reviews will be forthcoming on the various channels.

Had to drive nearly 30 miles (remember Gilligan's Brian?) from the place we
were staying to arrive at the location.  Someone's car stalled on some train
tracks, thus causing a 30 minute wait for parking.  While my friend and I sat
in the car, we blared the PEE DOUBLE EWE EEE EYE and had a generally OK time
talking about what we would do for our "big rave".

After parking, we met the two girls who nearly rear-ended us as the procession
broke free of the train tracks.  Really nice, really friendly.  I must say
that I met more people that night than I ever got smiled at in an LA rave.
Definitely a different atmosphere.

As we approached the stage setup it began to rain lightly.  It was completely
wwild to watch.  They had a bright halogen light illuminating the path to the
stage that looked like it was spitting sparks from the rain drops.  The
intellibeams they had setup looked far better in the rain than fog ever did.
Seeing the shadows, the rain, and the incredible stroboscopic lights made me
feel like I was in a Fellini movie. :-)  It was all so surreal.

The first DJ sucked.  Lots of techno-rap, and some older crud.  I thought I
was going to see some par excellante mixing by the amount of hype these guys
give themselves, but this guy was no better than a clown paid to do
high-school dances.  Yawn.  I did my best to get the energy up.  I was
approaching people with my diffraction glasses, telling them to try them on.
This is what the response inevitably was:

	"Cool!  3D glasses right?"

Then they try them on.

	"HOLY SHIT!! HOLY HOLY SHIT!  HOLY SHIT!"

I was amusing to say the least.  The rave scene is younger in Colorado than I
thought it was.  The glasses are old hat in Utah :-).

The DJ kept telling people to move their cars from the street or they would be
towed.  He finally got his ass of the stage and the next DJ took over.  My
friend and I took off to look at the concession booths.  I bought a great
T-shirt that says "DOPE" in the "DOLE" style with a glow-in-the-dark logo on
the back.

All of a sudden, people were streaming from the stage.  I saw the two girls
we'd met and I asked them what had happened.  They told us that nothing had
happened, they had just come over to see the booths.  But people were still
coming.  The music had stopped.

Yes, that's right, two hours into the rave, it was shut down by the cops.  All
due to the parking problems.  Piss poor planning.  Things were starting to
look like the best rave I've been to yet, but it never got off the ground.

We did however, get some good ideas.  I also met the guy who did the Ali
Baba's in Las Vegas.  Got in contact with quite a few people.  We handed out
flyers for our rave on the 4th, although we knew nobody would come from
Colorado for it, we told them to get on the mailing list anyway.

For anyone in the four-corners area who is listening, the big one is coming in
August.  We're going all out for this.  If this doesn't succeed, we're never
going to try again.  If you want to get on our mailing list call:

aw, i think they're fun.  they don't do anything for me, mentally, but
it's fun to watch the trippy patterns and the ones i've tried didn't
cause me the physical discomfort you mentioned.  of course, i would
never pay for one (although i'm thinking about building a model for
personal use.  they sell them for $129 but i think i can cobble one
together for under $5.)

Subject: Weekend @WALDO

Peace and love everybody:
	First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who came out to Waldo's this
weekend.  This was the first rave/party that I've been actively involved in 
and I must say, despite my nervousness, I had a blast indeed.  It was great to
see my old friends; Giamma(If I don't see you then I KNOW something is awry!),
"chill" Neils, Jai (of course) and it was good to meet Cynthia (it's still 
duct-taped!), Jon, Eric(?Did I meet an Eric?).  The location was nice an roomy,
the weather was purrrrfect, the music reverbed probably a bit too much as did 
the price.  I really thought it was going to be $12-15!
	Byut, in the end I think all had a good time.  Not to forget, Chris B. 
had a really nice set-up at the smart bar, great drinks and conversation!  The 
next stop for me was Bahia (1635 Market?).  This is a nice little place that 
serves fruit-filled crepes, mixed, fresh(!!) fruit and potatoes with coffee for 
$5!  There is also $1 draft beer if you want that.  Scott hardkiss spun and 
turned a mellow, gently recuperating, and conversational crowd (hungry too, I
might add) once again into frenetic groovesters.  The music was FANTASTIC!  I
wish he had played the same at Waldo!  After a while, the dancing spilled out of the club and onto the sidewalk...  Ahhhhhh, I just love a good party!

peace out, again....

Subject: LA rave "Future" - long



This weekend I went down to LA.  I decided to check out a much touted, well 
promoted rave called, Future.  I paid $20 for the ticket and gave one of the
security men my pass and then wandered in.  I was tapped on the shoulder and
was told to go back outside to be searched.  I went back out and a security
guy searched every single pocket from head to toe.  He even inspected my 
pieces of gum.  I had an Evian bottle that I had just opened outside and he 
told me I couldn't bring it in because it was already opened.  After searching
me for about 5min, he finally let me in and he told me I could bring my water
after a growl on my part about that.

Once in, I was in the largest warehouse I have ever been in.  It probably 
covered about a block.  There were about one thousand people bunched in the
center of the warehouse.  Most of them were teenagers.  They weren't unfriendly
but they weren't friendly either.  There was NO energy in this crowd.
The sound system sucked
because the sound engineer must have forgotten to turn on the treble.  
Sonz o loop da loop was playing with this dude who was trying to talk to the 
music - not even rap to it and it really sucked because his microphone was
way louder than the music.  He kept this up for an hour, the crowd was getting
tired of him.  After various dudes had their chance at the mike for another 
15min talking unintelligable stuff because of the horrible sound system, 
Rosalla came on but they put her voice in the backround so you could hardly 
hear her.  The guy who was talking for the last hour got the foreground-clear
sounding microphone and he was saying things like, "yeah", "go for it" etc. at
the end of every phrase Rosalla sang.  It was really horrible.  Rosalla tried
her best despite the sound system setup and sange 3 songs and suddenly
decided to quit singing just as the 4th song was starting and disappeared 
backstage without even waiting for any kind of applause (which there wasn't).  

Finally someone noticed the treble was turned to zero and turned it back up
so the sound was now pretty good.  Then came some LA djs who played relentless
hardcore techno with not a single break for about 2 hours.  The LA ravers 
just didn't have anywhere near as much energy as SF ravers when it came to 
dancing style.   They just kind of stood around or barely moved their bodies. 
Scott Hardkiss came on and his selection was more hard-core than his selection
in SF but it was still good in my opinion.  There was a massive exodus starting
at around 3am and by 4am it was pretty sparse.  Scott was playing a great
song at around 4:15 when the promoter/guards shut him down mid-song.  No one 
complained except for me.  That was it.  It sucked.  I basically summed it up
to a friend of mine as just a collection of teenagers who don't really know 
how to have fun, fun as we know it in SF.  They were just going through the 
motions.  If the music was disco instead of house, it would probably have been
exactly the same.

The security guards were real assholes.  They were really trying to assert 
their "power".  I think real cops would have been more friendly.  This rave
in LA was being policed by its own "cops" making the situation tense and
adding to  the already shitty scene.

I hope SF raves never get to this.  I've noticed some of the bigger Sharons, 
and Citris raves in SF starting to approach this lack of communal energy and 
lack of communal personality and lack of friendliness toward strangers.

	Yes.. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who feels this way. Actually,
I'm surprised it was only $20, not $25 or $30 (self-justified by having a
"major act" like Rozalla play). But it really ended at 4:15? Shame. I think
one problem was that there were at least 3 major events that night, including
Paw Paw Ranch 2, which supposedly was out at a ranch in San Bernardino; PPR1

Subject: waldo kicked butt.

wow.  been out of the office since thursday.  here's a quick summary
of my life since then:

thursday night - "future sex" at 1015 folsom ($8 with invite).  lame
lame party put on by some magazine who didn't even have the decency to
give away free copies.  read an article in SF Weekly which made it
look like i didn't miss anything except for pictures of naked women.
the "sexual performances" were laughable.  after this lovely
performance art (art with a capital F), some reasonable but not
brilliant dance music came on and we shook our white butts for a few
hours.  they played a fair number of popular rave hits but there was
some of that Wailing Diva crud in there too.  crowd was typical club
poseurs for the most part.  ehhhh.

friday night - "a rave called sharon" at the concourse center ($15
admission).  walked in and heard "O Fortuna" playing.  bad way to kick
off a rave.  i was feeling pretty shitty from some apparently
contaminated pasta salad, and tired from lack of sleep and surplus of
running around the mission area all day with friends.  the concourse
is a huge space and it really needs to be set up properly in order to
work.  i don't think sharon quite got it down.  there were lots of
speaker stacks but if you weren't standing directly in front of one,
the sound was appalling - a huge rumbling bassy mess, basically.  i
danced for a bit, but felt pretty sick to my stomach, so i sat down.
DJ Spun came on, and played a good set - up to his usual high
standards, but i was still feeling ill so i danced only a little.  the
crowd wasn't really wonderful - lots of drinking and nitrous going on.
it felt like what i imagine LA raves are like (given what i've read
anyway).  we left early because i had to drive a friend to the airport
at 8 and i was dog tired.  on the way out we saw someone being taken
away by EMTs and another person sprawled on the hood of their car,
apparently sick.  lovely.  I vowed (yet again) to boycott all future
Sharons.

saturday night - "where's waldo" at an aircraft hangar in san carlos
($20 admission). a rave only 2 miles from my house?  in an aircraft
hangar?  at a small local airport?  it turned out to be one of the
most fucking godlike brilliant raves ever.  and it was my birthday to
boot.  they had the large doors of the hangar open so there was great
airflow.  the sound system was excellent - if you were outside the
hangar you could hear the music clearly at a nice listening volume.
so, you could hold intelligent conversations with the ULTRA friendly
crowd and also keep an ear out for your favorite tunes.  and talk
about tunes!  DJ Alfie played a really great set with some hard
hitting (but not hardcore) techno.  James followed with an amazing
acid house set - only marred by occasional problems with the sound
system (BUZZZZZ) and a Wailing Diva track or two.  I met James while
standing in line for the toilet, and he was very cool.  He was excited
to start spinning, saying that the crowd would be "putty in [his]
hands."  He played Helter Skelter by Meat Beat Manifesto and I turned
into a screaming flailing pile of ecstatic human garbage.  I walked by
his table and said, "putty in your hands!!"

The hangar was never too crowded - always room to move, and as I
previously mentioned, the airflow was *wonderful*.  The crowd was
incredibly open - I haven't met that many new faces since the Woopy
Ball, and I re-encountered many old friends as well.  Ecstasy seemed
to be the drug of choice, with lots of rave virgins X-periencing the
scene for the first time.  Almost no alcohol in evidence.  People were
there to socialize, dance and have a good time.  I was in heaven.

As the sun began to illuminate the (little fluffy) clouds, the DJ
played some beautiful trancy music.  The security guards warned us
that things would be winding up soon.  After the last song, a group of
people armed with cabasas, congas, agogo bells and other miscellaneous
percussion gathered outside the hangar and began to jam spontaneously.
Absolutely wonderful!  They were really together and the jam was
eminently professional.  The crowd cheered loudly and then the guards
asked us to leave.

I felt like utter crap on Sunday, what with having got only 8 hours of
sleep total the past two days, and the drugs wearing off, and the sad
knowledge that it will be a long time before I see another rave quite
as wonderful as Waldo, but I feel much better today and I'm beginning
to think about the next rave... :)  While some may feel that $20 is
pricy, for what Waldo delivered, it was well worth it.

There are a lot of DJs who know how to mix good dancing techno and

I for one would be impressed.  You need the phones (woops - blew your budget
right there!), the glasses frame, at least 8 little light bulbs, some wire, 
some kind of D/A for the sound, probably at least one opamp, and some kind of
sequencing device (either a weenie microprocessor, or a PLA), not to mention
the physical mounting doodads (breadboard, box, screws, phono jacks) and
assorted switches, trim pots (probably) and so on.  And I must have left some
other little ingredients out, since it's been *years* since I built anything
electronic.  *Plus*, you lose the economies of scale when you build a single
unit of anything.

But if there's some way you *can* hack one of these together for so little,
why not share the plans with the net?  I'm sure lots of people could have fun
with such a cheap project.

I'm pretty sure you're thinking of Faster Pussycat, Wednesday's at
Paula's Clubhouse.  16th Street around Valencia.  I don't know what
type of music she plays that night; she seems to have eclectic taste
in music.

Also, many thanks to Jai and Bam-Bam and the others who made the GG Park
rave happen, since Preston wasn't running things this week.  A rented

well i hope so too
i really need to go up to SF and catch some good raves before the scene
up there becomes destroyed
LA sucks.. the crowd sucks and the promoters, in general, suck
i love LA and i probably always will hold it somewhere special in
my heart, but when it comes to raving
it SUCKS
(i think i've used that word enough.. but really, it does)

there are just way too many people who go because it is trendy
and there are too many peopl who want to makes lots of money off
of people who go for those reasons

i really wouldnt ever bother coming down to LA for a rave
except one of the free ones that we are beginning to throw
which are really raves, but small dances, but i havent been to one
so i really cant say i help in throwing them

well, i was going to do without the sound.  put on a hafler trio
record or something.  (hell, they distributed a record with plans for
a dreammachine, so why not?)  as i said, i'm not building it for the
Incredibly Mental Improvement factor, i'm building it for the Nifty
Light Show, so who cares if the sound is scientifically calculated to
induce alpha rhythms...  i think we were looking at different devices,
because all mine is going to do is have two small LEDs mounted inside
a pair of swimming goggles that i'll spray paint black. controls will
be one switch that toggles between simultaneous and left/right flash

Here in San Francisco outdoor raves have been going on for a little over a
year.  A group calling themselves the Full Moon Massive puts on outdoor raves
every full moon and a promoter named Preston has been having daytime raves in
Golden Gate Park.  The cool thing is that the FMM and Preston both do these
raves because they are fun.  No cover usually -- often they just pass a hat
around to collect some money to pay a little bit to the DJs and the people who
carried the speakers and electric generators.  

The Full Moon Raves move around and are often on beaches or where ever they
think they can make a lot of noise and park a lot of cars without getting
noticed by the cops or neighbors.  About half of them get shutdown due to
not having permits or obstructing traffic.  A few of them have had cops show up
only to say "have fun and clean up when you're done" as long as nothing illegal
is going on.  Hardly ever any alcohol, although lately the highschool/frat
crowd has discovered these raves.

With the right location and the right planning the outdoor raves are great! 
The best was on the Winter Solstice last December, which was the same day as
the full moon and a lunar eclipse!  Sometimes it's foggy or (gasp) even
raining but I've always had a good time -- EvEn without hElp, if you catch my
EXcEllEntly subtlE drift.

Preston's daytime raves in the park are always fun.  Not as high-energy, but
everyone there is there to have fun.  Some sit and picnic watching the dancers,
some are dancing or bouncing around.  Some people play games.  There's always
an audience of a few tourists or families, but they add to the fun, sometimes
joining in.  The last one I went to a few weeks ago had at least 500 people
dancing in their barefeet under the trees with the sun shining.  Wow.  It
always seems like a love-in from the 60's.  These things are probably the
closest thing our generation will come to Woodstock, not that FUTURE thing, or
whatever it was that someone made a reference to earlier.

Anyway, hope the scene picks up for you guys back East!

Subject: Long (Weekend Review), as opposed to a (Long Weekend) Review


I have to second Brad's review of Care*Free.  Definitely one of the most fun
nights I've had in a long time.  But more on that later.  Wish I could have
made it to Where's Waldo, too.  Simply just TOO much to do!

The weekend started on Thursday with Terriculous.  Lame.  Lame.  Lame.  I saw
one person dancing the entire evening.  The DJ "Dave Rave" was so bad.  I've
completely blocked my recollection of his choice of music, but I seem to
remember it being old, bad techno.  Where the hell did they find this guy? 

They had some live techno which was really bad, too.  Did I mention the place
was LAME?  The "100 model *yes*100* model fashion show" never materialized and
Jonathon wasn't evening wearing one of his trademark hats!  The SINGLE high
point of the evening was that someone had brought some nitrous.  Granted, a
single nitrous buzz is a pretty lame high point, but, hey.  Looks like we
should have gone to Preston's Through the Looking Glass (if I'd remembered it
was happening).  Did anyone go?

Friday went to Sweat, which was aimed at the gay crowd, it being Gay Day
weekend and all.  It was at 174 King St., which they are now calling the King
Street Garage.  They've added a few more lights and done some more work on the
place since the first Blow Yer Head.  Not too crowded, but great music and room
to dance.  Jerry Bonham spun a decent mix.  He usually spins high NRG stuff,
but his selection was definitely more housey.  Then came Roger Sanchez from
Strictly Rhythm Records.  He has quickly become my favorite DJ.  He usually
plays that house with a sort of jazzy groovy feel to it, but not too mellow. 
And his mixing is amazing!  I guess that's why Strictly Rhythm pays him to mix
their tracks.

Brad already went into great detail about Care*Free.  Definitely a gay crowd,
but later on it was a little bit more mixed -- maybe 10% straight.  The energy
levels reminded me of Toon Town at it's peak last fall.  I was in heaven! 
(substance consumption:  1 rum&coke, two energy elicksers; mood:  annoyed at
the hour wait to get in, but improved with time.)  By the time I got in and
oriented and found my friends the bar was closed and the boozers were sobering
up or leaving.  Yay!

Roger S was back, Nikki Rivera was kicking, and Doc Martin was impressive.  He
often plays house on the pop-side of the scale (and, yes some of the "wailing
diva crap" that I actually like) but he manages to work it in and never over
plays it.  He has an amazing ability to work the crowd up for an hour into a
writhing frenzy of energy, keep it at that level for a while, and then to
slowly bring everyone back down, tired but happy.

Aside:  Brad asked where Doc Martin was from.  He promoted and spun at Recess
in the summer of 90 and DJed at Colossus and Atlas around that time.  He
originally came from spinning in New York and now is based in LA, but comes up
to spin here often.  He also did quite a few one-night things, such as Watch it
Wiggle and E is for Everybody in SF and the first Gilligan's Island (I'm
told).

I usually don't notice the quality of a sound system unless it's bad.  This
time, however, I noticed how good Townsend's new speakers are.  I've never
heard such crystal clear music played at such high volumes!  Even with my
wadded up, saliva-soaked bar napkin pieces stuck in my ears!  :-)  I definitely
like having two distinct dance floors, although I'm always worried in the back
of my mind that I might be missing something even *better* in the other room!

I left at 5:00 in order to catch a few winks before the parade, which was fun,
but tiring, especially after the long nights out.  The Oracle contingent in the
parade was just a couple spots behind the Box, which made it fun dancing down
the parade route instead of just walking!  

Anyway, it was a fun weekend, all in all.  I'm already looking forward to the
long weekend.  I assume Preston will be doing his thing Sunday?  Can someone
confirm that?  There's nothing as disappointing as getting psyched for
something that isn't going to happen!  

Share and enjoy,

Tim

Hmmm.... OKay, I'm about to disembark on social commentary here, so forgive me,
but I have a lot more faith in the people of San Fransisco to keep it from getting
like LA, or at least, to always provide alternatives to the huge events.  And I
think the core group of ravers here is larger, friendlier, and hardier than
the LA ones, and are more intelligent too.... and SF has had a long tradition
of being very peaceful and brotherly, ever since the 60's and continuing 
today.  Even as SF promoters start getting dollar signs in their heads, it 
looks like they have enough creativity to make it work on a larger scale....
How many people were at Waldo? I would assume a lot, since it was held at an
aircraft hangar. If all those sfravers could find that event fun, even with
that many people, we have a lot to look forward to :)  I think we can prevent
the SF scene from degenerating LA-style (a little pun there), if we keep our
wits together and don't allow greedy promoters to milk us. I have hope....

	Brian

p.s. - the main scene in LA may suck, but the smaller clubs, like Citrusonic
I went to, are where a lot of the hardcore crowd down there go; things like
sketch pad on Sunday mornings, Joy on Thursdays, etc., I've heard from
a couple of people whose taste I trust, are really good. And even if the
events themselves are bad, the scene does have some great DJ's like
Barry Weaver, Doc Martin, and Ron D. Core.... okay, I'll get off my soapbox
now....

What a cool idea!  A new moon rave... the area would get TOTALLY dark if all
the lights went out at once (if it can be held outside).  Besides, in my
major, NMR stands for nuclear magnetic resonance, which also sounds like a
cool name for a rave.

Good question.  Last Sunday it was just a couple of guys with a
mediocre home stereo system in the park (it took them a while to get
it running nice.)  Preston wasn't there to my recollection, but who
would be on Gay Day?  I was just wanting to relax from it all, and
Marx Meadow that day was a wonderful retreat -- why do these rave
producers put on these imminently successful events right in the smack
middle of times when we need to be asleep preparing for the daytime?

Unfortunately, I didn't feel the first quake because I was still hanging around
that gigantic warehouse and it must have been on very sturdy ground.  The rave
FUTURE had already closed down 30min ago when I saw these superbright flashes 
light up the sky.  I still don't know what they were but I guess they were high
voltage power lines shorting out.  None of the other ravers around me noticed 
the quake.  The second quake was a blast because I must have been on shakier
ground (halfway between Santa Monica & Hollywood) up on the 4th floor and I was
woken up by it.  I do feel bad for the injured and the fatality and the damage
but for me it was a complete blast (because I stayed intact).

As far as earthquakes go..
at Paw Paw Ranch II
there were still like 30 cars or something full of dosed
and sleeping people lying around paw paw ranch at 5 am
it was really freaky being dosed and experiencing the earthquake
i couldnt feel it or see it (hell.. the ground had been rippling
for hours any way) but the car sounded like it was sliding down the side
of the road.. and then all the other people
started honking and yelling, so we figured it out

as far as LA raves go...
i agree completely with Brian about the clubs
Flammable Liquid is a little bit trendy
but practically no one actually gets the number and goes
in comparison with the amount of people trying to find it
and gee.. its really easy to get..(it hasnt changed in a month)
but clubs like that are where most of the old ravers go
(as in people who have been raving for a long time)
and they are pretty cool and its also a good way to get to meet
the dj's and hang out with them in a non rave, non meat market club
atmosphere

And If I want to listen to a woman having a fake orgasm to a bad disco
soundtrack, I'll turn on the playboy channel. It's that simple. 

Of course, feel free to recommend some good modern wailing diva house
music that competes w/ the classic divas mentioned above. 

Gee, I guess that makes me only racist and misoginist against modern
house divas. (Get a grip y'all!)

Obviously you  guys are just a bunch of PWMs*.  IMHO Wailing Divas come straight from the Goddess  herself, they are the cry of Shiva, the apocalyptic

Ya, I was standing outside of townsend a couple of weeks ago
and I met and talked with the owner of the company (M&M Audio?)
who makes and installs the new speakers that are in townsend.
I asked him about the quality of them compared to what Meyers
sound (here in berkeley) puts out and he called them "meyer
killers".  He also boasted:  "we used to do the American Music Hall".
My friend Luke, who works at Meyers sound, replied: "Ya, but we
do the American Music Hall now".  In any case, I'm sure they are
very good speakers.

   count me in....

   We could each bring food and I'm sure to have some music won't be a problem.

What day are we talking about here?  And is Marx Meadow in GG Park or
elsewhere?

Okay, so it looks like there will be a semi-official sfraves meeting, at
Marx Meadow in GG Park, on Sunday, starting at noon. Everybody should bring
food at least for themselves, and maybe some to share. Is there a BBQ pit
nearby? I would assume not... if somebody could post that and explicit
directions that would be great.

Music will be follow, as it does every Sunday, (if someone could double-
check that this is going on, please do; if not, I could bring my tables,
maybe someone else bring their amp and speakers, etc...). Just an informal
get together :):):) 

We'll also get a chance to discuss when/where/how we want to do a major
sfraves event by the end of the summer.....

See you all there!
