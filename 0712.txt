Subject: [sfraves] oooh... my Thrusday night Reveiw

OK... so like on the way to the BART station... got into this conversation
with this guy who was all packed to go to Vietnam to hang out w/ the
buddists & i just made sure he knew how to take what bart train etc & I
said he could shadow me if he needed too.. so we got to the BART station..
then i dunno.. like he got lost :(  Hope he made it to SFO :|

So the DubStep party @ Shine was fuckin' SIIICK!!!  I mean.. ok.. all the
DJs who spun did their own like groove w/ the dubstep... Kid Kameleon put
hella 2 Step in his set & I was like totally so diggin' that hardcore
man!!!  But yeah... all the DJs rocked it!!  I was on the floor dancin' my
ass off!  But when it got too hot, & it did 'cause like for as tiny as
Shine is... like it was packed shoulder to shoulder the whole night!!  But
yeah... when Plastician got up & dropped his tunes... oooooh fuck yeah!!! 
For me... he played good then hella bult up his set to like something
Dope!!!  Like the longer her was on.. the harder his bests got & ummm...
it's hard to like really define.. just that it got harder & deeper &
yummy!!  There were alota vocal tunes that sampled alot old skool pop
songs.. none that i could rememeber atm... but ooh YUM!! Plastician did
that alot more towards the end if i remember correctly :)

The crowd was good too!!!  I mean.. like alota the dubstep family
repped... a few Thursday night randoms that followed where the big crowd
outside was... some Sine Regs.. & like alot of berners where there too!! 
It was Fun1!!  There was even this 1 burner i was hangin out w/.. forgot
her name.. but she got me & this other guy like we did these hand like
holding/ touching things where we exchanged energy in our bodies.. that
was kinda intense actually & was very fitting with the music goin' on!!! 
Oh yeah... before i forget, Levi who used to be on this list was there
lastnight!!!  he told me to tell whoever remembered him that he says HI &
well... he kinda hinted to me that he misses SFR & hoefully we'll see him
again!!!

Unfortunately i didn't end up going to Temple anymore for my Jungle fix...
I mean... ooh man.. the vibe @ Shine was sooooo damn fuckin' yummy & the
music was totally what i needed!!!

The adventure home this time around was kinda well... scary!!!  Like after
Shine.. we all kicked it outside then these burners who were like in a
groiup huddle, all beat boxing a dubstep beat & Manny Vibes started
spitting lyrics.. lol.. it was soo cute!! ;)  Then as the crowd kinda
dwindled down.. i walked over to Cat Club to see who was still working @
1984 or like who mighta been clubbing there that night.. but well... no
one was there... but ok.. like mean... from Shine to CC.. like there was
this lady who followed.. iy kinda freaked me out 'cause i'd stop to let
her pass, then she start diggin' in a trash can then follow me again...
then when i was walin' down folsum to got to AllStar Donuts... this man
with a cart well.. it seemed like he was following me.. then another scary
guy like told me he needed $1.75 to make it back down to Stanford & i told
him i only had a bart ticket & a bus ticket to get home & i was sorry... I
mean.. i had like 2 bucks for coffee & donut for that caffine & sugar
boost i needed so i wouldn't fall alseep on bart.. & another $1 for my
bart tix & i could easily like pass through the gate thingie in bart for
the bike people.. but i didn't wanna another $80 fine for doing that &
figured using my $1 ok yeah.. i was guilty.. but anywaze

so i got over to ALLSTAR, then a homeless guy like opened the door for
me... got my coffee & well.. turned out i didn't have anough for a donut &
BART, so i choose bart instead... & while i drank my coffee... like i
dunno.. hella scary people came in allstar & I just like totally minded my
own business@!!

Wheni was walkin' to BART, some security guy started yellng @ me for
taking pictures of street signs, & then when i got to bart... some guy
tried sellin me a $3 bart tix for $10... on top of that... the BART
schedule seems like slightly different now & the bus schedule was totally
diff too.. but YAAAAY... i got home!! OK.. the end!!!

all your reviews are fucking crazy adventures man, love reading them :)

I wonder if I know the guy trying to get to Stanford, did he look like a
student?

and lastly, I know this is going to make me sound like a retard, but what
exactly is Dubstep?  I couldn't find it on Ishkur's guide (while I don't
trust what Ishkur says he does post samples).  I have a mysterious feeling
that I've heard it somewhere before and liked it a lot but just didn't know
what it was labeled.  Is it sort of what Bassnectar and his usual retinue
play?  Please educate me.

Subject: [sfraves] Anyone up on "Sweet"?


Hey gang... I was just wondering if anyone was up on a group called
"Sweet", I think they're centered in the Santa Cruz area.

Lately, I've been participating on the events commitee at Cellspace,
and it looks like we're going to go with Sweet on New Years Eve...
I was just wondering if anyone knows what their gigs are like, etc.

I'd love to hear others' opinions about Dubstep but my feeling about it is
that it's slower, broken drum and bass. Some of it includes the standards
reverbs and ragga mc touches found in "dub" proper, as well as
dancehall. Some of the techier varieties are interesting....

I know Kode 9 was at Mutek this year, which signaled a diversion of the
festival from its typical minimal techno/experimental showcase. Here's a
live performance clip from Sonar:

And a performance vid from NY that I like:

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Anyone up on "Sweet"?



"Sweet" is a series hosted by Lost Tribe, which was formed by Jim Cyr (a
frequent poster on here) and Matt Stone.  They started going their events
back in 1997 and with over 1,000 parties under my belt, they remain at the
top of my list as having organized some of the most vibiest I've ever
participated in. I find this post sort of ironic since most of their "Sweet"
events were actually held at Cell Space. Having built their own strong,
underground following through the years, Lost Tribe has never used lists and
other types of internet promo to get the word out about their events and
while there was a day when many a SFRave-lister would be familiar with Sweet
experiences, I'm not sure how many still ramain on here that could share
their experiences at past Sweet events.  But, I'm here and I'm sure Jim Cyr
will post up when he sees this.  And while pictures can't convey experience,
I do happen to have a few links to past Sweet events on my website's pix
section. Here's one that was captured at one of the many parties they held
at Cell Space.

To sum it up, Sweet parties are hella Sweet.

Hey gang... I was just wondering if anyone was up on a group called "Sweet",
I think they're centered in the Santa Cruz area.

Lately, I've been participating on the events commitee at Cellspace, and it
looks like we're going to go with Sweet on New Years Eve...
I was just wondering if anyone knows what their gigs are like, etc.

I have nothing but props for "Sweet" and Jim and Matt.  Great parties with
family vibe.  As I recall they send party invitations via snail mail.  No
mass marketing.

Love,  

Apollo

OMG - Sweet is back?!!!
Man I love those parties some of the best SF has ever
offered! I remember Spesh playing out an awesome remix
of 'we are connected' at Studio Z and Jim playing an
awesome set later that night...simply 'rocking' the
decks and dancing with the crowd... ahh good
memories...in one of the past gatherings.
Cellspace is a way better space for these parties, in
my opinion, either way I hope this is true - I am
truely excited for little tidbit of info.
Oh man Sea of Dreams or Sweet...better yet maybe
both??
Thanks for sharing...

Ah, now "Lost Tribe" I've heard of.  Somehow I'd missed "Sweet"... but
then I was starting to lose interest in ravey-type events by the late-90s.

Well, keep in mind I'm a recent recruit to the "events committee"... the
attitude of the old-timers there I would summarize as something like
"yeah, they have their act together".

Well most likely it's true, though you shouldn't this confused
with an "announcement". Myself, I would guess Cell and Sweet
can work out a deal.

Anyway, there's been some turnover in management at Cellspace
recently... the former ED was more into youth programs/community
outreach/classes and so on, which is cool, of course, but events were
getting short-shrift there for awhile, which is much less cool.
There should be some more action coming up at Cellspace in the near
future (and for that matter, if you're looking for an events space,
you might want to keep Cell in mind).

When was the last Sweet?  I remember there was one big one held at Townsend before they closed it down. That was a great party.

Ah, now "Lost Tribe" I've heard of.  Somehow I'd missed "Sweet"... but
then I was starting to lose interest in ravey-type events by the late-90s.

Well, keep in mind I'm a recent recruit to the "events committee"... the
attitude of the old-timers there I would summarize as something like
"yeah, they have their act together".

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Anyone up on "Sweet"?

That last Townsend shindig was actually a "Generator" party, still Lost
Tribe, but a shoot-off from "Sweet" featuring a harder-edged sound (which is
tame nowadays), but yeah... I believe the last actual "Sweet" party was at
in January 24th, 2004 Sweet - Virtues of the Spiritual Warrior at Studio Z.
Lost Tribe's last party that I can recall was back in December of 2004,
again at Studio Z... "Bashing the Holidays".

Well, keep in mind I'm a recent recruit to the "events committee"... the

Subject: [sfraves] WR: My Yummy Saturday/ Sunday Adventure

ok... so like i woke up early & i was outta the house by 12PM... like the
buses that normally runs on weekdays don't run on weekends, & i called in
to see if i could get a pick up @ my house... they said w/o a 24
reservation yada yada, the wait time would take 2 hours..., i waited for 1
hour & got kinda ansty, so i just walked to the bus stop, which kinda took
a while...

anywaze... so to get to the City... well.. i left my house @ 12, walked,
bussed, BARTed, Muni-ed, walked more.. & with the slow schedule of public
transportaion added to the long walks & long waits in between pub trans
modes/ vehicle thingies, i actuallyt got to where i need to get to the
City b4 almost 6PMish..

So in the early eveing.. went to a family gathering to see my Lovlie
Yummies ( I was sooo late! ) then got dropped off on Gough & Market 'cause
my ride had a show to go there to... so i walked to Fat City from there...
OK.. when i was on 11th walkin' down, i saw this like old lady @ the bus
stop & this guy standing in front of her like hella feet in front... the
lady wouldn't stop yelling & Hello 2day.. she sounded like Satan's Child
she sounded so scary.. then every like 8 words or so, she made a weird
sound.. so i was guessin' she had terrets or something!?  I mean.. i know
it's a bad thing to have & stuff, but it was kinda fun to watch so i
walked like kinda slow just to like i dunno... watch....

So i got to the club a lil early & like the one thing i wanted to do
before all the DIRTY madness started was give Uberzone this oooold flyer
that i had from a rave a looong time ago in Oakland that i'm sure he would
appreciate... so i saw him & gave it to him & then he told me & whoever
was around that the party (Believe in 97) was 1 of the top #2 parties he
ever performed at... & he told us like this mini story about when he was
doin' his set & the vibe & how unforgetable it was.. ironically, the other
top party he performed at was also called Believe & that was in Arizona or
Oregan... so that was fun :)  LoL... both him & Davey asked me where my
Top Hat was... Hello 2day

BUt ok.. the night was fuckin' ILL!!!  Oooooooooooh Yeah!!  So Dope!!  All
the sets were So Dope!!!  I mean.. the the EB Reses like totally threw it
down like no tomorrow ofcourse!!  I mean.. even the lil tag diddy that Bam
& icon did @ the end was hella fun & yummy!! :)  BUt ok... that J
Haezenburger Dude... Fuckin' A man.. his set,.. ok.. 1st off... when i 1st
saw him in the crowd walkin' around & he bumped into me when i was
dancing, i seriously had to double take & grabbed his shoulder & pulled
back to me 'cause i seriously thought he was fuckin' Diesel Boy at 1st...
anywaze... his set was sick.. he opened up w/ this Glitchy Downtempo kinda
groove & kinda built up to yummy breaks in his set... Fuuuck Yeah!!

OK.. Uberzone & Davey Dave... WOW.. I mean... yeah.. just WOW... the live
drums & the live groovy melodies.. bad fuckin' ass... i danced even more
harder than i was  before... it was sooo fun!!!

All in all.. the music was mondo A+ all night long!!  Loved it!!!

The Vibe was really CooL!!  All the usual suspects where there & alota EB
1st timers or haven't been in a long time or even the needed something
differnt and the random SOMA clubby crowds all showed up too!! 
Seriously... b y 12:30, the house was sooo packed & it was literally
standing room only... the floor was packed & like the only place you could
stand was on the stairs or like the small edges of the dance floor (& that
wasn't like huge either)...

Oooh.. upstairs.. so like upstairs was teh Ambient Mafia Lounge & it was
Dope up there too!! They set it up up there to make it all comfy &
colorfully lit but dim & it was Nice!!  They played alota down tempo-ie
stuff, hip hop, old skool jamz.. it was fun too!!!  I was up there
occasionally, but the beats from downstairs just kpet bumpin' my name & I
need to dance dance dance!!!

After the club, i luckily was fortunate enough to crash out @ Bamdon's pad
in E-Ville!!  YAAAY!!  Then in the morning, i woke up to naked people on
the Sofa & drank coffee out of a large Martinee glass...  yeah... & i
haven't laughed that hard in a long time from wakin' up from a 2 hour nap!

Yeah.. it was a Dope adventure!!  YAAAAY!!!

It was Dope seein' y'all lastnight & there was alota y'all i missed
seein'!!! {{{HUGZ SFR}}}}

I don't know if you've been paying attention but I think the tide's  
starting to turn, people are standing up and refusing to support the  
New World Order agenda ... unfortunately we've still got cameras on  
every street corner.  Just remember what the Spanish tour guides say  
at Cuevas del Drach in Mallorca, Spain.  Every other stalagmite cave  
site allows you to take photographs, or makes you buy a permit, at  
this one, none are allowed, but all the Italians do it anyway, so the  
tour guides are going around saying, "la camara, por favor ... no  
fotograf ... no camara ..."

So when you see one of those cameras at a stoplight in the middle of  
nowhere and you're scratching your head wondering why, just say "no  
camara" ...

9pm - 2am

We've been doin the Bassdrop events for quite a few months now and
since we're coming up on the Holiday season, we decided that it would
be a good idea to have a residents only show. It's time for family

 Most def the noisiest synth ive ever heard!? Some cool sounds but a major biotch to program.? All those damn menu pages!
Definitely for a "synth collector", very difficult to use in a production environment.
Here's your chance to re kindle the love, bid on...!!!

Picked up a Mono Machine recently.? A great box, but takes some time getting used to.
Elektron makes some of the best gear.? Shame about Daniel...
Cheers,

Jon

Is this the Bar Crawl thingy?

If so, I think J.C. and I are doing this. Cuz seriously - being a drunken 
bastard in a Santa suit is the greatest idea of all time.

hey folks,

dunno if this is technically a BSP since it really has nothing to do with
me, but just a quick tip off...

tonight's special guest at "Lil' Brthr" @ 222 Hyde is REALLY, TRULY special!


i can't say who it is, but i can tell you...

* you won't see this guy perform around here again for a long time.
* he's never DJed in SF before
* he's not from the US
* he's performed on the BBC Essential Mix and toured around the world
* he plays a combo of minimal, tech-house and sometimes even a bit of breaks
* there's a hint on the flyer

....and the chit is FREE! (donations accepted i think)

i rarely go out on the weeknights anymore, but this is one set i just can't
let myself miss!

the special guest plays from 12-2am.


here she blows.....

Sorry I didn't get a chance to send the quote out yet, I've been kind  
of busy today.  Enjoy!

The measure of the wealth of a nation is indicated by the measure of
its protection of its industry; the measure of the poverty of a nation
is marked by the degree in which it neglects and abandons the care of
its own industry, leaving it exposed to the action of foreign powers.

- Congressman Henry Clay, 1824

just for the record, it's actually a monthly Auralism event.  ken is playing
tho, as he's now part of the Auralism crew.

travis and ken's night is called Binary, if i'm not mistaken, and it's also
on a tuesday, but a different one each month.

either way, i'm fuggin' excited!

No, not for that DJ Dreamteam thing.  For the SF Bay Guardian's Best 
DJ's Of The Bay poll.  All you have to do is email promos@sfbg.com and 
submit J.C. of An Epiphany Of Sound (KZSU) as the best Terrestrial Radio 
DJ. (Of course, it's also applicable to choose best Internet/Satellite 
Radio DJ, best Dance Club DJ, or best Bar/Lounge DJ if that's your 
choice.)

Deadline is Noon this Friday!

Thanks!!

The funny thing here is seeing how completely insane things can get when 
one takes a fanatical stance on something.  Here we see the result of 
this from the "Westboro Baptist Church" (which is not much more than a 
family, in reality.)  To learn more about them, search for them in the 
news, and watch the video to decide for yourself.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Santacon 2007

Recently I got into verbal fisticuffs with an idiot on a bus because he 
was being a rude prick in publick and I let him know,
in no uncertain terms, that his behavior was incredibly socially 
inappropriate.

The bus was crowded and as I was giving him the tongue lashing of his life,
(in my defense, he was the one that started the convo, not me),
someone called out:

"Hey, Buddy! Where's the Christmas Spirit?!?"

To which I snap-answered, w/out thinking:

"I'm *not* a Christian!"

Coulda heard a pin drop after that, it got that damn quiet, all at once.

Definitely a keeper.

:-P

it will definitely be on the candy side of things and draw a young

Scott Hexadecimal is playing, which is the ONLY person of note (except for 
maybe Ill D & Nick Nyquil) that I would bother watching...but that's

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Santacon 2007

do you talk to everyone that addresses you?  what was the guy doing 
that was inappropriate?

I frequently ignore people.  like spam.  or telemarketers. or street vendors.


I'd like to go to Santacon 07, it sounds like a blast, and I remember 
hearing about it years past.  What's the best place to get a suit?

After watching this, it's no surprise that people like Charlie Manson are
capable of brainwashing people to believe and do anything. Anyways, do you
know WHY these people believe God hates the world? I wouldn't be shocked if
they claimed that the evils in the world (natural disasters, 9/11, Iraq war,
etc.) are manifestations of God's wrath. Imagine the discussion, "So guys,
why do you think evil exists? CLEARLY God hates us all... Of course, of
course, there's no other possible explanation!" I'm sure they all got A+'s
on their philosophy exams.

Dammit, I'm going back home for winter break the day that this is happening!
I watched the video from '95, and it was HILARIOUS! I almost cried from
laughter when the Santas were being arrested. Haha, I wish I was on Market
that night. Does it get as crazy nowadays?

Of course! Wars cannot possibly be the product of politics and other
factors; they must be a sign God's divine wrath descending upon the sinners.
So actually, whenever I have a stomach ache it's not because of the spicy
food I ate, but because of God's divine wrath. God is out to fuck up your
day; somewhat like the drunken-asshole that wants to pick a fight with
anyone at a party.

Global free trade will force the poor of the rich countries to
subsidize the rich in poor countries. What GATT means is that our
national wealth, accumulated over centuries, will be transferred from
a developed country like Britain to developing countries like
Communist China, now building it's first ocean going navy in 500 years.

well, no breaks were heard. in fact, no records were heard!

contrary to what i had heard, alex smoke played LIVE, for nearly 2 hours. :)

another stellar performance, despite a couple technical hiccups near the
end.

if you made it down, you know what i mean...

if you didn't, you missed out on a fun night!  thx auralism!


but for the record, i swear alex does mix some breaks/electro/broken-ness
into his dj sets.  for proof, check out his debut essential mix from a
couple years back. the first 20mins or so are all broken-beat bizness.  good
shit too.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] special shiz 222nite

Blame myself for being tired?

I challenge anyone to come deal with my job for a week and see how energetic 
they are after work each day. If indeed they could make it through an entire 
day of my job.

My solution to this problem:
1. Go to the store and buy beer.
2. Drink beer with roommates
3. Take bus (with Late Night Special pass someone left behind at the 
store) to 222 hyde.
4. Don't comment on the fact that headphones weren't even used in the 
set.

You missed the "poor" part, huh? lol

Yea...100% poor. No cashola. My lovely job doesn't give us paid holidays, 
and I was shorted almost $400 on my last check, which was the check I pay 
rent and bills with.

WOOHOO.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] special shiz 222nite

Funny you mention TV....we are gonna be featured on TLC next year.

And why am I not looking for a new job? Well...

1. This time of year sucks for job hunting.
2. I kind of really need ot stay here a full year or more for stability - I 
have historically contracted, and I have found over the last few years that 
employers look upon contractors (even if they have finished all of the their 
contract periods) as "unstable", as loads of contracts are less than a year.
3. I don't have to deal with corporate BS at this job, which I am NOT a fan 
of.

But by next year, after my year is up - you best believe I will be job 
shopping. Unless of course they give me some massive raise.

interesting mix of mostly funky house stuff -- not too

Subject: Re: [sfraves] josh wink 88 mix

I met him at the Melkweg in Amsterdam in '98.  Good guy, but
his mixing wasn't really that on.  He totally lost the crowd
and it was basically just me and him in the DJ booth, smoking
huge quantities of...uh...tobacco.

Derrick May, however, was awesome!  (Same night:  Derrick May,
Jam Master Jay, and Josh Wink - truly an amazing evening.)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: c.moore on An Epiphany Of Sound this Thur.

My guest this week grew up in a jazz musician's household and has taken 
that tradition of musical knowledge and wonderfully expounded upon it. 
Originally a purist, he has since evolved to incorporate a wide range of 
these traditional styles into his music while still keeping it as 
organic sounding as possible.

For the show this week, I'm expecting that he'll be providing us with a 
bit of an education, guiding us through the african as well as jazz 
inspirations for some of his music before highlighting his own works.

I know I'm looking forward to it!  And I'm hoping you get to join in on 
the fun!  Please do!  It's really easy; just tune in to 90.1 FM in the 
SF Bay Area, or listen online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Hope to share some time with you soon.

Peace.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] josh wink 88 mix

I remember a few years ago Dan Bell claimed Josh Wink's hits are  
ripoffs of his records. This letter from Bell to his publisher is an  
interesting read:

It's a difficult thing to establish when an artist is influenced or  is
in effect copying another artist. I'm aware that in this age and  that in
my specific genre of music making that the issue of copying  another
artist's work has become an even more black and white issue  mostly due
to the frequency of digital sampling and more specifically  the clearing
of digital samples.

And while digital sampling has made the idea of copying musical ideas
less ambiguous and more easily detected than ever before, I find
myself in the situation where I feel I have become the target of good
old-fashioned copyright infringement.

I am writing this in the sincere hope that you will listen without
prejudice to the evidence I'm providing to you.

Introduction

I believe that the recording artist Josh Wink (aka Winx) has
knowingly copied arrangements, sounds and production techniques from  my
own copyright protected work and has failed to acknowledge the  source of
his success. It is my belief that Wink has developed a
pattern of loosely basing his musical structures and arrangements on  my
own original work. I also believe that his next release "Freak" is  his
most daring copy yet of one of my arrangements. [...]

History:

I have met Josh Wink several times. The first time was in November  1990
in Detroit where I was scheduled to perform as Cybersonik with  Richie
Hawtin at a nightclub called "1515 Broadway". The performance  was
canceled hours before it was to start and we only found out when  we
reached the venue. There was no line-up or crowd waiting to get  in, only
two people were waiting when we arrived. One of them was a  disappointed,
then unknown, Josh Wink, who I remember had traveled  from Philadelphia
to see us and was a "big fan" of our music.

I saw Josh Wink again in 1992 in either Rochester N.Y or Philadelphia  PA
while on tour again as Cybersonik. The DBX "Phreak" (the track in
question) was released weeks before on my label Accelerate. He was  sent
a copy of this record from the +8 label directly (the label
pressed and distributed my label Accelerate). He said he "loved" the
track "Phreak" and that he "just wished the track was longer" - it's
approx. 3 and half minutes long (his "Freak" approx. 5 mins).

The next time I had an encounter with Josh Wink was in 1995 just
months after I had released my "Losing Control" record. The record  was a
huge underground success most notably because it featured a  monotone
voice repeating the words "I'm Losing Control" on every bar  faded in and
out of the song. The effect was similar to a melodic  hook in popular
music. The entire song was based on the manipulation  of the vocal. At
the beginning of the arrangement the vocal is
introduced with the high frequencies muted and only the audible
frequencies are the lower frequencies. As the song progresses more of
the high and mid-frequencies are revealed until the whole phrase
of "I'm Losing Control" is audible. The vocal is then manipulated and
echoed and then disappears by subtracting the frequencies in the
reverse way they were added. To my knowledge, this way of slowly
manipulating a frequency filter over a repeated vocal phrase, over  the
course of an entire track was never done before in dance music  prior to
this record

Josh Wink called, he told me he had a similar track called "Don't  Laugh"
that had a "laugh" instead of the vocal "Losing Control" that  was
manipulated and arranged in a similar way. It was strange that  Wink had
phoned me about this because I had never received a call  from him before
or since that day. "Don't Laugh" was released in 1995  and was licensed
to several high profile record companies who were  able to promote the
single into mainstream markets that were not
familiar with "Losing Control". In contrast, Peacefrog records of the
U.K., the original label to release "Losing Control" froze sales at
10,000 copies in order to make the release rare and in-demand to
develop prestige for the label. Even though the release was the
biggest seller on the label to that point, no promotion was done. In  the
end, 500,000 copies of "Don't Laugh" were sold worldwide. Despite  the
similarities and the overwhelming feeling that he was trying to
capitalize on my ideas, I felt that that there was no recourse for me
because his track still had some differences.

In 1995 Josh Wink released a successful mix-c.d. on the DMC label
entitled "United DJs of America Vol. 3 " in which he licensed "Losing
Control".

In 2000 Josh Wink released "How's Your Evening So Far" a track that
featured a digital loop of Lil Louis' 1988 hit "French Kiss" . The  track
also featured a voice repeating the title - similar again
to "Losing Control" - only this time the way the vocal was
manipulated in almost the exact same way, as if 7 years later he
finally figured out the specific technical approach on how the
original was done.

Regarding the Lil' Louis aspect of the song the New Music Express
reported on July 4th 2000:

"JOSH WINK has run into a legal wrangle with PETE TONG's label ffrr  over
his version of the LIL LOUIS' acid house anthem `FRENCH KISS'.  The
record is due to be released in the US on Ovum label at the end  of July,
but a worldwide release is not likely until an agreement has  been
reached over how the Wink version will be credited".

Josh Wink reportedly resisted the Lil Louis co-writing credit that he
was eventually forced to put on his release. Many reviewers noted  that
the release sounded like a remix of "French Kiss" rather than a  new
song.

In December 2001, Josh Wink showed up at a club in Philadelphia PA  that
I was djing at and told me that "I have a track called "Freak"  that's
going to be really big" and that it was inspired by early
tracks. The track has been tentatively titled either "Freak"
or "Superfreak" (I also have a track entitled "Superphreak" a 1993
release on Peacefrog) and has been played on Pete Tong's show on
Radio 1 in London.

This track "Freak" sounds like a remix or remake of my track "Phreak"
from 1993. It features a pitched-down robotic voice saying "Freak" on
every bar. The arrangement is sparse like the original Also the main
musical repeating notes are very similar and may even be samples of  my
track cut up.

There already is a big buzz in several countries regarding this
release and I believe it is slated for release on the Ovum records in
the summer months. I feel that this is the last straw and that this
track is too close to my own. Please help to publicize this
situation. His New York lawyers claim there are no similarities. Let  the
people judge for themselves by supplying them with all the
information.

Thank-you for your understanding and attention,
Daniel Bell

Funny you posted this... I always wondered about French Kiss and how it
sounded so damn similar to Wink's release.  Either way, I like and own both
versions.

Yea, I am not a huge fan of Wink Djing...each time I have seen him, with the 
exception of one time at Buzz, he was kinda lacking in skills.

Definitely concur on Derrick May tho - that guy is pretty raw.

Haha, that might be taking it a little too far. I'm not a fan of the candy
style, since it's pretty much a uniform; but I have no problem with the
people. Most candy ravers that have been to more than a handful of parties
are extremely friendly and fun people. Of course you could point out all th=
e
newcomers that dress in the style, and that often have no clue what raves
are about (who tend to cause problems at parties because of this). However,
is that the fault of the candy style? No, it's the people that adopt the
style in order to try to fit in at their first party. The candy doesn't
force itself onto people.

Anyways, I think it'd be great if candy ravers made their own personal
style, instead of conforming to one. We could definitely use a little more
creativity.

Jea, that'd be ok I reckon - except for the whole working from 8am to 5:30pm

But I have bartended before and it was good work.

Anyone know of any clubs/bars hiring? :)

http://www.nrdconline.org/campaign/Tell_White_House_to_Protect_Polar_Bear=
s4

You probably know this. Polar bears are in big trouble. Here's how to =
take 30 seconds to help.

 We all know that the poles, the ice caps, glaciers, sea ice, and the =
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are now melting, receding, =
disintegrating FAR faster than anyone had ever feared (having now =
reached previous predictions for the year 2050 just this year, 2007).=20

This, of course, all has a huge negative impact on a lot of lifeforms =
and a lot of other areas of concern for this planet. But one specific, =
keystone species has stood out as the one many people feel we really =
need to be worrying about. The polar bear, the world's largest land =
predator, is in serious trouble. Because they hunt seals as their =
primary food source, they depend on sea ice to travel and to hunt from =
and to live on much of the time. Sea ice gaps previously ten miles wide =
are now reaching two hundred miles in many places.=20

Polar bears are starving, they're drowning trying to cross these gaps, =
they're cannibalizing each other, they're abandoning their young, =
they're losing size and mass, they're dying off in huge numbers. This =
iconic northern animal is now under consideration for the endangered =
species list, and could be largely gone in a few decades, scientists are =
saying. Their protection under the Endangered Species Act would be =
crucial to giving them a fighting chance.=20

Below is the email the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) sent out =
to its members today. If you're interested in helping out, please click =
on the link and add your name to the "holiday card" being sent to =
President Bush, asking him to place the Alaska polar bear under federal =
protection (a small step, admittedly, considering it's not going to =
bring the ice back, but an important one regardless).=20

Taking action with these guys actually makes a huge difference. There =
are millions of members, and they make it extremely easy to just add =
your email address to their petitions and amass a huge number of =
electronic "signatures" which are then sent to policy makers and the =
president and so on. The Council and its members have, in this way, in =
the time I've been a member, actually been the deciding factor in the =
creation of policies which have protected wolves, whales, and fisheries, =
stopped drilling in the arctic, and made huge differences in other =
environmental arenas. I urge you to join. It's free, easy, and they =
don't send you extraneous emails - just when they need you to help with =
something critical like this in which our voices really do make a =

Subject: Re: [sfraves] on the downtempo tip

Actually, I really can't. Been playing catch up with backed up bills for 
months, and have been running on damn near empty for a while now 
financially. This last check being shorted $300 + killed all my mad money. I 
have $1.50 to last me until next Friday.

If I manage to get rid of any goodies between now and then, maybe, but until 
that happens, I is poor.

Such is life in the world of the underpaid, it's ok.

Bassdrop: Resident Night
Thursday, Dec 13th, 2007
Shine (1337 mission st. @ 9th)
9pm - 2am
21+
FREE like always


We've been doin the Bassdrop events for quite a few months now and
since we're coming up on the Holiday season, we decided that it would
be a good idea to have a residents only show. It's time for family
after all.

Subject: [sfraves] thanks for the bday wishes

Thank everyone for the kind words. I think I plan to stop aging 
starting this year, just like Osby ;-)

Today went by like a blur, non-stop meetings, conference calls,
candidate interviews, & other work stuff. The whole day felt 
like an hour.

Gonna do my token dinner w/ the 'rents right now, and hopefully
I can get out early enough to run by Saiko Sushi for the 
Ambient Mafia-Sag thing before everyone leaves.

Subject: [sfraves] regarding Sweet !


so there was a bit of a thread on here a few days ago
asking about Sweet ! -

quite sincerely I was flattered by the responses from
both people who I know - and people who I am not sure
I know . . .

anyway . . .

yes, it's true - we are having our first event in
several seasons - i will always be grateful to the folks
of sfraves who helped us launch Frequency 8 many
years ago - after I split with those partners, I decided
that the only way I was going to continue with ugs was if
I was able to find a space with a decent dancefloor -
specifically,  a wooden dance floor with some bounce to it,
and a community, of sorts, that really was - into DANCING

anyway - i really prefer to keep it to "2 degrees of separation"
so, i would never post an open invite to as public a list
as this - however, there are many people who I feel I "know"
on this list and would feel really good about inviting (yes, pinkho,
including you) - so, if you are interested, (and Osby says
it's OK) - email me privately for the 411 - I just ask that you
do not forward the 411 - actually, forget the Osby part -
that part probably wouldn't work to anyone's advantage lol - Hello2Day

Hi Jim,

I don't go out very often these days, but I'd be honored if you'd add me to your private mailing list.  WHo knows maybe my wife and I will actually make it out on of these days!

Best,

Fur reals. Its terrible up in the North Bay -- burner-hippies in their
mad-max-in-yosemite outfits milling around 24/7. I think there's some kind
of compound up here...

I'm not sure if you were replying to me, but I don't hate candy kids at all
:P In my reply, I said that most candy kids are actually extremely friendly
and fun people. I pointed out that a possible reason why they have a bad
reputation is because a lot of newcomers to the party scene often adopt the
candy style in order to fit in, and that these newcomers often have no idea
what the party scene is about (thus the complaints about drugged up candy
kids in e-puddles). It's not that pronounced here, but if you've been to
parties in LA, then it would be blatantly obvious (it is not rare to see 13
or 14 year olds at parties down there). Of course, this is sfraves, so I
doubt that applies here.

On the point about creativity, it mostly depends on your definition of
creativity. I personally find more creativity in the style of burners,
junglists or househeads because they tend to wear the clothes that they
would typically wear. I see a lot more possibility and combinations in that
sort of approach, than compared to throwing on bracelets, phat pants, and a
brightly colored t-shirt.

However, I'd say out of all of those that the burners are the most creative=
.
I've been to techno, house, breaks, and psytrance parties (although not the
ones in the bay), but burner events (usually psytrance) tend to have a lot
more deco and people dressed in eccentric outfits. I went to the burningman
website and opened the first page of images from 2007 and I found this guy
that looks like a jedi crossed with a russian raver:
http://images.burningman.com/gallery/moontiger.31615.jpg I don't see how a
candy kid can push creatively when they're bound to phat pants, bracelets,
and bright t-shirts; but I would love to be proved otherwise.

I don't understand why people feel the need to adopt a costume for everyday 
life. That's my problem with any scene "uniform". And let's face it, Candy 
is a fuckin' uniform.

In all realness, costumes, face paint, etc, have a long, long tradition in
just about every human culture with their rituals that involve music and
dance.  I think costumes are a great thing to have at parties, BUT, I don't
like the elitism and snobbery that occurs in some of these circles when
people do not dress to what they view as the status quo of their "scene."
This seems to be most prevalent among the burners.

Anyways, I'm serious about the fur trading business, we can go skin pelts
off the back of burners and hawk'm for some sort of profit or exchange!

Ew.  So you are one of the people we can blame for the horrid fodder  
some call "epic" trance?  Gross.   You should be ashamed of yourself.

Yeah, I do not approve of elitism. Not only is it unfriendly, but it goes
against a lot of their (I'm speaking in generalities) personal ideals such
as love or equality. I think people should be able to dress however the hel=
l
they want at a party, and I'm pretty sure that's what happened when raves
first came about. It is about individual expression and freedom (pirate
utopias, temporary autonomous zones, etc.). You shouldn't feel forced to
conform to an image when you party, but inspired to create your own. And I
think we all have a responsibility to encourage behavior like this. Do you
enjoy parties where everyone hangs around in cliques and only certain style=
s
of music are accepted (elitism doesn't only apply to fashion, it applies to
music too)? If not, then I suggest taking action about it. It's easy to
maintain silence and keep this within your thoughts, but then nothing will
change. Inspire people to make things better, rather than allowing them to
revel in their flaws.

P.S. I suspect that burners wear fur a lot because of all the outdoor
parties. It makes sense to wear something warm, when you're dancing in the
cold. And I wouldn't be surprised if psychedelics had some influence on the
abundance of fur either. That shit feels great.

Yeah, I do not approve of elitism. Not only is it unfriendly, but it goes
against a lot of their (I'm speaking in generalities) personal ideals such
as love or equality. I think people should be able to dress however the hell
they want at a party, and I'm pretty sure that's what happened when raves
first came about. It is about individual expression and freedom (pirate
utopias, temporary autonomous zones, etc.). You shouldn't feel forced to
conform to an image when you party, but inspired to create your own. And I
think we all have a responsibility to encourage behavior like this. Do you
enjoy parties where everyone hangs around in cliques and only certain styles
of music are accepted (elitism doesn't only apply to fashion, it applies to
music too)? If not, then I suggest taking action about it. It's easy to
maintain silence and keep this within your thoughts, but then nothing will
change. Inspire people to make things better, rather than allowing them to
revel in their flaws.

P.S. I suspect that burners wear fur a lot because of all the outdoor
parties. It makes sense to wear something warm, when you're dancing in the
cold. And I wouldn't be surprised if psychedelics had some influence on the
abundance of fur either. That shit feels great.

Your guys recommendations for the sf dj dreamteam  (which I will not be
voting for!) are great.   I'd love to see DTA, shadow, MBM, mephisto
odyssey, among several others be represented....   However, I doubt we'll
see any of them on the bill!

Hey all, 
 
So, I have a friend coming in from Fresno (yea, yea I know) who is looking to do some dancing tonight. She is looking for the following: 
 
1. Cheap and/or free
2. "accesible" tuneage (i.e. good house or downtempo - nothing too bangin' or ultra minimal)
3. In the city
 
Any help y'all? I haven't been looking at too many events since I is po' - so I am not sure what might fit the bill...
 
THANKS!

Hey all, 
 
So, I have a friend coming in from Fresno (yea, yea I know) who is looking to do 
some dancing tonight. She is looking for the following: 
 
1. Cheap and/or free
2. "accesible" tuneage (i.e. good house or downtempo - nothing too bangin' or 
ultra minimal)
3. In the city
 
Any help y'all? I haven't been looking at too many events since I is po' - so I 
am not sure what might fit the bill...
 
THANKS!
 
~ Marco

Here's my 2 cents on the whole uniform thing.  A costume when done in
complete weirdness and outside the norms of acceptability pushes a boundary
of mind and culture that helps make a rave what it is.  However! due the th=
e
phenomenon of mass kandi ravers, wearing kandi has no longer become a
costume pushing societal boundaries, but an accepted form of uniformity tha=
t
goes against almost everything that is rave.  The idea is to push peoples
boundaries that they hold of what is and ought to be.  Kandi (even if it ma=
y
have ONCE done this, and this im not even sure of) does not.  It may have
started with good intentions but it cheapifies the rave experience.  Beside=
s
the whole dress code argument, my biggest problem with kandi is that it is =
a
cheap "gift" used to try to acquire more for yourself.  In otherwords it ha=
s
moved from a gift giving process to a process of exchange.  Not to mention
the idea of continually giving beaded bracelets at EVERY party takes away
any kind of heart or creativity in the gift giving process, which ought to
be used to spread love energy

hmmm!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tiësto nominated for Grammy Award with Elements of Life
 On December 6th, Tiëstos album Elements of Life was nominated for one of the most prestigious awards in recorded music, a GRAMMY in the Best Electronic/Dance Album category. Elements of Life released by Black Hole Recordings, continues its success, having sold over 72,000 albums in the US to date and reaching golden and platinum status in numerous other countries globally. The other nominees in the category of Best Electronic/Dance Album are Justice, Shiny Toy Guns, LCD Soundsystem and The Chemical Brothers. 

To support his album Tiësto has been touring with his Elements of Life world tour, selling out venues in the US such as the LA Sports Arena with an attendance of 15,000 people and the prestigious Hammerstein Ballroom in New York two nights in a row. The tour lands in almost all continents from North-to-South America, Europe, South Africa and Asia, reaching hundreds of thousands of people with each single event on the globe being sold out in advance. 

It has always been a dream for me to be nominated for a Grammy. I have been working on this album for over a year and therefore am very happy with the nomination. says Tiësto, Its a recognition for all the hard work! 


Nominees are selected through a voting process with members and record companies submitting entries. Submissions are then screened for eligibility and category placement by 150 experts in various fields, to ensure that entered recordings meet specific qualifications. The Academy's voting members, all involved in the creative and technical processes of recording, then participate in (1) the nominating process that determines the five finalists in each category; and (2) the final voting process which determines the GRAMMY winners. 

This is the 50th Anniversary year for the Grammy organization, and the GRAMMY Award show will take place on February 10, 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. USA.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Trippendicular 4

Yeah... that's the big difference.

I've never been given grief by a candy kid for not wearing candy.  It  
doesn't matter if you're at the cheesiest of the cheesy happy hardcore  
happy kids party.  Even if you don't have a single pony bead upon you,  
the candy kids won't look down upon you for not being one of them.   
Worst case scenario is that they try to give you some candy of your own.

That's a far cry from the treatment and attitude I've caught in jungle  
and house rooms of larger parties in the past when I've ventured in  
while I WAS wearing candy....  And the open mocking I was the object  
of, on the part of the burning man types, when I showed up at their  
little "decompression" block party thing a couple of years back for  
not being "proper playa attire".  (I wasn't even there to attend....  
just to give a friend a ride home.)

Thing about shorts though, is that except for summer day parties, =20
they're not exactly practical.

This time of year especially, but even during the summer, it's bloody =20=

*COLD* at 4 or 6 am when I'm getting out of a party... usually moist =20
with my own sweat.  Baggy pants give room to breathe and circulate =20
some air when I'm inside the party and fairly warm; but also kelp keep =20=

me from freezing my ass off when I'm walking out of the party and it's =20=

forty degrees out.  Plus, if I do want to sit down at some point; phat =20=

pants insulate me somewhat from whatever nasty is on the ground.

It's the whole prostitot look (Even guys are doing it these days.) =20
that makes me go WTFH?!?!?!?

You know, I obviously can't speak for all of the candy ravers that ever
existed, but I know when I was doing the candy thing and I had little candy
making parties, it was ALL about making interesting things to give to peopl=

shouldn't generalize so much?

Those junglists, though, they're hateful, mean, disgusting people. Every
last one of them.

of his 2000 book My Life and the Paradise Garage: Keep Dancin' for a
terrific look at his life. He donated the office space for GMHC in its =

founding
fiscal sponsor for LIFEbeat, The Music Industry Fights AIDS. He was an
active board member at LIFEbeat until his death.

Mel was warm, witty, and sweet. He loved music, truly supported artists, =

never tired of looking for talented newcomers to promote. He =
revolutionized
dance music, opened one of the greatest nightclubs in history, and used =
his
energies and resources to help in the fight against AIDS for 25 years. =

Subject: [sfraves] MY Thursday Night adventure & The Drunk DieselBoy

ok... so the ride to the City that night was kinda interesting.. so i
hoped on BART I like sat across from this dude who was like on his cell
phone the whole time & i mean.. i tried not to keep looking... but he
would like grab his crotch & like squueze a few times,, scratch, then
smell his hand.. I mean.. it was kinda disgusting.. but fun to watch
'cause he was reeeeeeeally into it man... so i could only assume he was
having really good phone sex or talkin' on 1 of them call girl phone
services maybe to be that ummmm noticably involved!?

So i got to Temple early.. ok... fuck man... 2 Cents & Ivry... they
fuckin' opened up the night w/ alota floor bangin' choonage.. i could not
stop brockin' the fuck out on the floor & they oooh man.. Ok.. yeah... i i
think i heard some freshly made stuff they like made.. YUM!!!

Like the crowd built up during this set & oh man.. people from outta the
woodwork cme out & it felt like fuckin' Compression Old Skool Back in the
day stylee man... the vibe was sooo damn thick & the energy was way up
there man!!  LIke ummm.. yeah... lol.. Hello 2day.. it was just.. ok...
i'm getting like giggley & all tingley just thinkin' about it & it's like
hitting me again that it was that mondo YUm!!!  I mean.. there was a time
when you'd go to Compression, it'd be just like a local line up, but 90
people showed up & we all just took the dancefloor... yeah... it felt
kinda nostolgic like that!!!  Oh yeah.. & met a whole bunch of new yUmmy
Junglists too!!!  So Dope!!!

Oooh oh oh ohoh.. so on the mic... Colenel MC,Manny Vibes, & My Fuckin'
Homie fuckin' ZEZOone tore it up... Dirtyboy MC got on the mic later when
he was well.. drunk & couldn't rhyme, so he just did like ummm.. Circus
Announcement MCing stuff...

OK.. so here's story.. well... what i was told anyway... like they wren't
letting people in to SFO 'cause it was like weather hazzards & shit.... so
alota flights were delayed... when Dieselboy got in.. he went strait to
his Hotel & passed the fuck out!  So it was like 12 already & he still
wasn't @ the club... so the promoters called him & woke him up & he
managed to get a ride out & kinda started his set a lil late... well..
this is what i heard what happened... so i dunno...

But when he got on... he fuckin' brought it... but he brought it after the
1st 3 tracks he dropped 'cause he was havin' prblems w/ the sound & drunk
people in the DJ booth...  I mean... this is the 2nd time I've seen him
like spin.. & compared to the last time... he *waves head around*, I
mean... it was sooo Fuckin' Sick... he didn't do a strait trough Rock
Metal Hard Jungle set like @ 1015 ummm.. last year... I mean... I really
wasn't diggin' the Clownstep part of his set.. but OOoh Fuck man... like I
was all about the UK Upfront shit he dropped :)  I mean.. he did play some
totally classic dboy ch00nz which totally like ooh yeah... got me good
when i was dancing!!

OK.. so like dboy finished spinning & grabbed the mic from the MC.. then
like ok.. so i call this he pulled a Frankie Bones.. 'cause Frankie Bones
done this a few times when i saw him spin out here... but yeah... dboy
started talkin' & Thankin' everyone & well.. i think he did that 'cause he
was drunk... but it was cute.. lol.. then he played this last track.. this
"electro" dnb song that he just rmxed for an upcoming something or
another!

OK.. so here's where it started getting more fun... so like we were all
kickin' it in the DJ booth after 'cause the Compression guys know that i
wasn't all about goin' back to the Haight w/ them this time & i needed to
stay @ the club as long as possible so my BART wait wouldn't be that long
to wait like outside... anywaze... so all the Groovers left & it was like
just me, Icon, & dboy... & yeah... i mean.. there was just soo much
laughing 'cause dboy was kinda really drunk & managed to get more drinks
even though the bar was closed & he was kinda force feeding me & Icon his
boo's.... oooh yeah... he also kept calling me "Janet.. Ms Jackson if our
nasty" 'cause of my shirt!!!  But serioulsy.. a drunk dboy is soo cute & I
just wanted to keep that small dude in mny pocket & bring around with
me!!!  YAAAY!!

I mean... hangin out w/ him & GEtting to know him kinda better well..
kinda made me feel guilty 'cause i dunno... i've heard so much about him &
like i dunno... but he's not a diva at all & YAAAY.. I <3 my drunk dboy!

So the raver gypsy adventure after wasn't too exciting.. i walked up
Market to go to the Donut World 24/7 shop, but apparently they remodeled &
reworked the hours they stay open now 'cause they were closed :(  So i
remembered about All Star on 5th & Harrison.. but by the time i got to
5th, i remembered that 88 Flavors place & they wre open, so i went there..
YUM Crumb Donut & HazelNut coffee!!!  Oh yeah... i figured it was late/
early enough that it'b be ok if i sang out loud while like listening to my
ipod.. well... i probably gave the homeless people & crack heads a good
show.. LoL..

YAAAAY!!!  How fun!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] anyone have groove the movie???????

this reminds me... i need to bug Minx again to see if we can have a 
Groove night at the Sanctuary.  she said she would re-create the altars 
she did for the movie, RA would do lights, and that we should try to 
get Viberation to do visuals. the idea was that we'd have a little 
party/movie viewing night, and it would be just like the movie, cuz it 
would be all the same props!

the only reason this event hasn't already happened is that the building 
(it's a church that was built in 1906) was being renovated.  i think 
the work is done now.

llar holdings.  The interest rate on US Treasury bonds does not come close =
to compensating foreigners for the decline in the value of the dollar again=
st other traded currencies.  Investment returns from real estate and equiti=
es do not offset the losses from the decline in the dollar=92s value. China=
 holds over one trillion dollars, and Japan almost one trillion, in dollar-=
denominated assets.  Other countries have lesser but still substantial amou=
nts. As the US dollar is the reserve currency, the entire world=92s investm=
ent portfolio is over-weighted in dollars.No country wants to hold a deprec=
iating asset, and no country wants to acquire more depreciating assets.  In=
 order to reassure itself, Wall Street claims that foreign countries are lo=
cked into accumulating dollars in order to protect the value of their exist=
ing dollar holdings.  But this is utter nonsense.  The US dollar has lost 6=
0% of its value during the current administration.  Obviously, countries ar=
e not locked into accumulating dollars.The reason the dollar has not comple=
tely collapsed is that there is no clear alternative as reserve currency.  =
The euro is a currency without a country.  It is the monetary unit of the E=
uropean Union, but the countries of Europe have not surrendered their sover=
eignty to the EU.  Moreover, the UK, a member of the EU, retains the Britis=
h pound.  The fact that a currency as politically exposed as the euro can r=
ise in value so rapidly against the US dollar is powerful evidence of the w=
eakness of the US dollar.Japan and China have willingly accumulated dollars=
 as the counterpart of their penetration and capture of US domestic markets=
.  Japan and China have viewed the productive capacity and wealth created i=
n their domestic economies by the success of their exports as compensation =
for the decline in the value of their dollar holdings. However, both countr=
ies have seen the writing on the wall, ignored by Washington and American e=
conomists:  By offshoring production for US markets, the US has no prospect=
 of closing its trade deficit.  The offshored production of US firms counts=
 as imports when it returns to the US to be marketed. The more US productio=
n moves abroad, the less there is to export and the higher imports rise.  J=
apan and China, indeed, the entire world, realize that they cannot continue=
 forever to give Americans real goods and services in exchange for deprecia=
ting paper dollars.  China is endeavoring to turn its development inward an=
d to rely on its potentially huge domestic market.  Japan is pinning hopes =
on participating in Asia=92s economic development. The dollar=92s decline h=
as resulted from foreigners accumulating new dollars at a lower rate.  They=
 still accumulate dollars, but fewer.  As new dollars are still being produ=
ced at high rates, their value has dropped. If foreigners were to stop accu=
mulating new dollars, the dollar=92s value would plummet.  If foreigners we=
re to reduce their existing holdings of dollars, superpower America would i=
nstantly disappear. Foreigners have continued to accumulate dollars in the =
expectation that sooner or later Washington would address its trade and bud=
get deficits.  However, now these deficits seem to have passed the point of=
 no return.  The sharp decline in the dollar has not closed the trade defic=
it by increasing exports and decreasing imports.  Offshoring prevents the p=
ossibility of exports reducing the trade deficit, and Americans are now dep=
endent on imports (including offshored production) for which there are no l=
onger any domestically produced alternatives.  The US trade deficit will cl=
ose when foreigners cease to finance it.The budget deficit cannot be closed=
 by taxation without driving up unemployment and poverty.  American median =
family incomes have experienced no real increase during the 21st century.  =
Moreover, if the huge bonuses paid to CEOs for offshoring their corporation=
s=92 production and to Wall Street for marketing subprime derivatives are r=
emoved from the income figures, Americans have experienced a decline in rea=
l income.  Some studies, such as the Economic Mobility Project, find long-t=
erm declines in the real median incomes of some US population groups and a =
decline in upward mobility.The situation may be even more dire.  Recent wor=
k by Susan Houseman concludes that  US statistical data systems, which were=
 set in place prior to the development of offshoring, are counting some for=
eign production as part of US productivity and GDP growth, thus overstating=
 the actual performance of the US economy.The falling dollar has pushed oil=
 to $100 a barrel, which in turn will drive up other prices. The falling do=
llar means that the imports and offshored production on which Americans are=
 dependent will rise in price.  This is not a formula to produce a rise in =
US real incomes.In the 21st century, the US economy has been driven by cons=
umers going deeper in debt.  Consumption fueled by increases in indebtednes=
s received its greatest boost from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan=92s low inte=
rest rate policy.  Greenspan covered up the adverse effects of offshoring o=
n the US economy by engineering a housing boom.  The boom created employmen=
t in construction and financial firms and pushed up home prices, thus creat=
ing equity for consumers to spend to keep consumer demand growing. This sou=
rce of US economic growth is exhausted and imploding.  The full consequence=
s of the housing bust remain to be realized.  American consumers lack discr=
etionary income and can pay higher taxes only by reducing their consumption=
.  The service industries, which have provided the only source of new jobs =
in the 21st century, are already experiencing falling demand.  A tax increa=
se would cause widespread distress.As John Maynard Keynes and his followers=
 made clear, a tax increase on a recessionary economy is a recipe for falli=
ng tax revenues as well as economic hardship.Superpower America is a ship o=

ses enormous costs on a bankrupt country, neoconservatives call for more wa=
r, and Republicans and Democrats appropriate war funds which can only be ob=
tained by borrowing abroad.  By focusing America on war in the Middle East,=
 the purpose of which is to guarantee Israel=92s territorial expansion, the=
 executive and legislative branches, along with the media, have let slip th=
e last opportunities the US had to put its financial house in order.  We ha=

Ah, Groove, where SFR got its 15 Seconds of Fame.

I can't vouch 4 this version:
http://www.mininova.org/get/881699

Zero comment, zero seeds, zero leechers, so you're own your own.

Speaking of "Groove" related items, this is the first "R" rated movie I 
ever saw.
http://www.mininova.org/get/889932

My parents actually wrote me a Permission Slip to go to it, it was on a 
Double Feature with
Monty Python & The Holy Grail, so there was no problem at the door.

This is when EDM took things out a whole new Groovy door that no one had 
heard b4:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMhMrecqAVI
(See: "A Clockwork Orange")

Gotta go, Wavy Gravy is saying hi.

Groovy, Baybee, Groovy, nothing but teh Groooooveeeee.....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR-Impending Destruction of the US Economy

Here's the retarded version.

America has lent China $1.5 Trillion Dollars.

Not counting the Wal-Mart:

"Made In China"

$$$....

That leaves the USA USA USA each and every day

The amount of Debt every working American *owes* China is $10K, per person.

$10,000.00

Oops.

How'd that happen?

Seen in reverse, it's like each & every every person in China, has 
*personally* lent the Citizens of The United States of America 
$1Thousand Dollars out of their own pocket.

Now bear in mind that most Chinese are doing well if they make $500 a year.l

Don't look now, my Libertarian Friends, but it wasn't Chinese Communism 
we needed to be scared of.

No, no, no.

but Chinese *Capitalism*

Chinese Capitalism.

Those bitches are about to eat our lunch.

Boo-fracking-hoo.

See you all after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, gonna be a Hootandannie 
Barn Burner.

:-P

I have a mainstream article about a Santa that was fired because he  
was going "ho, ho, ho!"  People thought he was calling women whores.   
And I mean this is just political correctness, no free speech, just  
cops running around in black uniforms tasering everyone.

About Fanon Flowers:

With a history of solid techno productions dating back to 1992 and a 2000
DEMF performance to his credit, Detroit native Fanon Flowers combines the
funky, syncopated rhythms of techno with the soul of house music.

Performing a live PA during his first ever San Francisco performance at Anu,
expect a future classic sound from one of Detroit's own.

About Fanon Flowers:

Shunning overdone melodies and neo-minimalism for a more pure, mechanical
sound, Fanon Flowers' 2004 release "Slovakian nights" has entered into the
canon of techno classics - with remixes by Exium and Loktibrada on Numb.

In 1996, Fanon Flowers appeared under his Mode Selector alias on the
"Detroit: Beyond the Third Wave" Compilation. Released on Astralwerks,
Flowers appeared alongside Detroit techno stalwarts such as Claude Young,
Ectomorph, Sean Deason, and Anthony "Shake" Shakir.

That same year, Flowers started his own techno imprint, Mechanisms
Industries, to showcase his unique and funky approach to techno. In
2000-2003, a sub-label project entitled Cetron (short for Creative
Electronics) was launched as a platform for more percussion-based material.

Mechanisms Industries has developed a large following for its creative
interpretation of the techno sound. Famed techno DJs such as Jeff Mills,
Surgeon, and Adam Beyer have been spotted playing releases from both labels.

Are you looking for that "GOOD AND VERY CHEEP" beat, but don't want to
create it yourself?

Say no more, http://shop4beatz.com/default.aspx  is where you want to be.

This has to be a highschool web-site project.

I'm gonna let you in on a little secret- (shhhhh)...
By establishing our debt in worthless pieces of paper versus hard  
commodities we maintain absolute control of it and in effect never  
have to repay it.
As our money devalues our debt diminishes- the Fed Reserve (while  
admittedly corrupt, illegal, evil etc) most assuredly knows WTF it's  
doing.

Here's another secret- China is BY FAR more dependent upon us than we  
are upon them.
Imagine China was wiped off the map by a meteor impact- we've got a  
flood of Mexicans and a healthy number of domestic poor to cover the
"cheap laborer" needs.
Things might cost a little more and be in a shorter supply for a  
while- big deal.
Now imagine that WE were wiped off the map- suddenly China can make  
millions of HD televisions but has nobody to sell them to.
Factories -> instantly worthless. Millions -> jobless.
Sure, China could instafuck us by converting all that debt to Euros or  
something, but they're not going to- because if we're not buying,  
they're not selling.

Whoops- Sorry SFR- I made a pact with myself to not respond to any  
political crap on this list, and I forgot to remove the CC.

To repent, I offer you Laurent Garnier's radio station:

You left out the bit about Iran refusing to take the US Dollar for its=20
oil anymore.

Made the switch over the weekend and so far the American Corporate Media =

Not that it would cause anything like panic selling of the Almighty US=20

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

I'm visiting some friends up in New York right now.  My friend was  
telling me how when he was a kid he decided he wanted chickens, you  
know for the eggs and stuff, raise them, and his dad was like, no  
chickens, they make a complete mess.  No way.  But he kept on him and  
finally his dad said, all right, we're going to the baseball game  
today, if you catch a fly ball, we'll get F***** chickens, all right?   
And so guess what happened, eh.

--

Why did the umpire throw the chicken out of the baseball game?
He suspected fowl play.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Tips for recording vinyl to digital via computer?

so, i think i'm finally going to start the monumental process of
recording my vinyl to digital format.

my current setup is fairly simple. i'm on my old G4 iBook using a
Griffin iMic (RCA to USB) and recording using Final Vinyl, the free
software that came with the iMic.

i know, definitely not audiophile level here, but it's what i could afford.

for those of you who have done this, what setup did you use?  any
problems you encountered?  any particular process or recording
settings that made things go smoother?

Be careful of sound degradation....even recording to 320 level can be a

it's a pita, but hey, so much is only available on vinyl. long
live black crack.

I have a DJPree II Phono Preamp[1] that I use for this.

They also offer a version with USB out[2].

I record using either an M-Audio FW 410 or an Echo Indigo IO.

meh, it's for dj'ing which is not audiophile level.

clicks 'n pops. doh.

On the Mac, Audio Hijack Pro and Fission work well. I like Adobe
Audition on the PC.

For click/crackle removal/reduction, you might try SoundSoap Pro, since
it supports Mac OS X.

I really wish Adobe would release Audition for Mac, since it's a great
program for working on audio when you need to clean it up or do other
granular work on audio.

You could probably run it inside Parallels after recording with Audio

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Tips for recording vinyl to digital via computer?



If you're not already familar, you need to know about
the "RIAA Curve" as it's known.  There's a standard
for equalization that's applied to vinyl records to
keep consistency in playback (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_equalization ).  If
you plug a record player into a "line in" audio jack,
you'll notice that the sound coming through doesn't
sound right.  That's because line level inputs don't
have compensation for the RIAA curve.  You've got two
options on how to account for it:
1) use a pre-amp, such as a DJ mixer
2) use some other kind of in-line phono pre-amp

Basically, your signal chain is going to look like:
record player -> pre-amp -> iMic -> G4

Now, making your recording is all about sound quality.
 If at all possible, get yourself an elliptical stylus
for your record player.  Sphericals are better for
cutting and scratching, but ellipticals hold the
groove better and will give you better response for
tracking in music.

The other trick that I like to use is to run your
recordings wet.  I don't mean heavy on the effects - I
mean actually damp.  Get yourself some vinyl record
cleaning solution (like eBay item 310006579128 ) and
get your record's surface wet, and track in your
recording that way.  This will significantly cut down
on the hiss, pops and clicks that you get on your
master recording.

Processing your master recording with SoundSoap or
Soundtrack Pro is totally up to you -- it all depends
on how you want your masters to sound.  Some folks
like to run a set compression over all their masters,
some like to fudge with the EQ a little.  It's all up
to you.

Good luck!

When I graduated college, I sold my car for $300 bucks and moved 500
miles away to San Diego, only to be contacted by the CHP and Butte
County Courts 6 months later because the car died, and the dude
abandoned it on the freeway somewhere and never got it registered. Long
story short, CHP and the courts tried to get me to pay the
towing/destruction fees for the dead-ass car and I had to convince CHP
to drop the charges. (which they did, finally).

So... point is, unless you can prove you aren't liable with some
documentation, then yes they probably are within their rights to come
after you. I had to go to the DMV and have them give me a copy of the
release of liability form to prove I sold the car... but my guess is the
car technically still belongs to you so that probably doesn't help you
much.

Good luck anyway though. You might consider talking to an attorney about
this, especially if they try to get the courts involved.

I guess the difference is that I did talk to the city it was towed from 
and they towed it for expired tags, not abandonment.  Does that change 
things?

My '69 Beetle was towed once in LA for being parked
where it shouldn't have.  But, it was towed from
private property by a private company, not due to a
violation like the tags.  I had to pay a pretty stiff
fine to get the Bug O' Doom back (including a mileage
charge to the tow yard!) but I had it back the next
day.

My guess is that you've got no recourse but to pay,
unless you can demonstrate that you had some kind of
variance or extension on your tag registration.  :/

Towing sucks.

My best educated guess would be: Probably not. From my experience,
towing companies are generally heartless (to say the least), so I would
expect them to come after you one way or another.

If I were you, I would at least talk to the towing company and see what
your options are... maybe try to negotiate a deal with them or
something. Unless you expect to lose a significant amount of money over
this, then I'd definitely talk to a lawyer first.

I guess the difference is that I did talk to the city it was towed from=20

Any lawyers on the list? :)

Or does anyone know how long fees will rack up?  In talking to them they 
say that they want the title PLUS the current impound fees.  (This is 
because they'll just end up selling it for scrap for $70.)  HOWEVER, I 
KNOW this is a lie, simply from this paragraph at the DMV site 
(http://www.dmv.ca.gov/vr/vr_info.htm)  (But still, the concern is the 
word "may" in the sentence "The lien may be satisfied by selling the 
vehicle through the lien sale process."):

Definition of a lien sale.

...
    If the vehicle is towed by a public agency or private towing company, 
the lien arises when the vehicle is towed or transported. The lien may 
be satisfied by selling the vehicle through the lien sale process.

    To conduct a lien sale, the person/lienholder must have possession of 
the vehicle and have lien sale authorization from DMV. Interested 
parties, including the registered and legal owners of record will be 
notified before the sale occurs.

    If the vehicle's value is $4,000 or less, the registered and legal 
owners of record will be notified by the party conducting the lien. If 
the vehicle's value is greater than $4,000, DMV notifies all interested 
parties.  You can call (916)-657-7617 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 
p.m. if you have questions regarding lien sales.

Expired tags on a public roadway (and even a face front driveway) is in
itself a towable offense. Unfortunately, you'll still be responsible for the
towing fee, despite whoever it was that called in the vehicle to get towed.
On top of that, you'll be facing "storage fees" for every day it's in a
yard. If you want to abandon it, then more than likely you'll still have to
have to pay a salvage fee. This is definitely something you want to have
taken care of as more time = more expense.  
Sucky J.C.!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Anyone ever have their car impounded?

You should try to take care of this sooner than later.  Usually there
is a tow fee, the city fees, AND the per day charge.  Some offenses
have a minimum amount of days that the car has to stay in impound.
Between 30 and 90 days usually, probably 30 in this case.

It's going to rack up quickly.  Negotiate with the tow company and see
what your options are.  Good luck.  I feel for ya.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Anyone ever have their car impounded?

After a period of probably 30 days, they will sell
your car to cover their storage fees, towing expenses,
etc... and I bet they will send you a bill for the
difference if the sale does not cover the fees.

I got my car impounded last year. After I moved, the
DMV never sent me a notice to re-register. It was 31
days past due. I got pulled over on the freeway but
the NHP, and basically told I was being left on the
side of the road and mt car impounded. Somehow, I
convinced the prick cop that leaving me on the freeway
was kinda dangerous. Although it is their POLICY to
leave you there, he graciously drove me home. Looks
good when your neighbors see you getting out of the
back of a cop car.

Being Nevada though, the storage fee was only $25 a
day, and the tow was $60. I got the care the same day,
after a trip to the DMV to renew my registration.

I know in SF that they sometimes charge like $250 a
day for storage. If you loook online, their is for
some reason ZERO regulation of the towing and storage
industry. AND I MEAN ZERO. It is the last totally
mobbed up business in the US.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Anyone ever have their car impounded?

I'm not sure that this one carries any manditory impound days.  (At 
least I see that mentioned with other offences, and not with this.)  So 
I guess my thought is does going to them and handing them a signed 
title transferred over to them (with a witness, of course) INCREASE my 
liability in any way?

If you're going to drive a Hummer and buy carbon offsets, that's like
getting drunk every night and getting into an AA meeting, throwing
money in the basket, and leaving.

how much are the fees?  If you want to just give the car to the towing
company anyway, might be able to find someone who needs a cheap car to pay
the fees for you.  Like a starving student or someone.

Any lawyers on the list? :)

Or does anyone know how long fees will rack up?  In talking to them they say
that they want the title PLUS the current impound fees.  (This is because
they'll just end up selling it for scrap for $70.)  HOWEVER, I KNOW this is
a lie, simply from this paragraph at the DMV site
(http://www.dmv.ca.gov/vr/vr_info.htm)  (But still, the concern is the word
"may" in the sentence "The lien may be satisfied by selling the vehicle
through the lien sale process."):

Definition of a lien sale.

...
    If the vehicle is towed by a public agency or private towing company,
the lien arises when the vehicle is towed or transported. The lien may be
satisfied by selling the vehicle through the lien sale process.

    To conduct a lien sale, the person/lienholder must have possession of
the vehicle and have lien sale authorization from DMV. Interested parties,
including the registered and legal owners of record will be notified before
the sale occurs.

    If the vehicle's value is $4,000 or less, the registered and legal
owners of record will be notified by the party conducting the lien. If the
vehicle's value is greater than $4,000, DMV notifies all interested parties.
You can call (916)-657-7617 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. if you
have questions regarding lien sales.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Anyone ever have their car impounded?



I ended up doing this with my old gti.  short answer:  nope, the impound
fee is if you want access to your car to get crap out and stuff, but with
expired tags it also usually requires a smog cert and any back reg fees
(never mind how you're supposed to get a smog check before you can get
the car.  I think you can get a temp reg for that purpose).  Basically,
if you pay their signover fee, they're accepting liability for the car and
you're done.  The DMV doesn't care since they got a POS off the street.
$500 seems to be the standard signover fee for the non-asshole places, sort
of worth it if you've actually lost interest in the car anyway to save
any more grief.  They're happy because it takes care of their tow costs
(those trucks are actually pretty expensive to maintain) and anything they
get from selling it is theirs to keep.

Gee, thanks. :)

I just learned that City Tow used to have the policy of accepting the 
towing fee and the pink slip.  That's something I can stomach right now.

We're ALMOST done with our special feature of some straight up techno 
from the Awakenings festival in Amsterdam this past Thanksgiving 
Weekend.  We actually get to go until 12:30 today and bring you the full 
set from Sao Paolo's DJ Murphy, which actually ends with 20 mins of a 
3-way tag team set from Ben Sims, Adam Beyer, and DJ Murphy on 6 
turntables.  And DJ Murphy has been TEARING it up.  (See his myspace

Listen in over the air at 90.1 FM in the bay area, and online at 
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Only ONE hour left!

Ah, looks like some network config things related to some security 
changes on the Stanford network didn't happen, so there are problems.

Hope people still got the chance to catch that DJ Murphy set through one 
means or another!

Heheh, sorry man, I couldn't resist. Sorry to hear about your situation,
predatory towing like this fuckin blows, pretty much boils down to extortion
at that point. Sucks that they're pretty much guaranteed to get money out of
you, that's just a frustrating situation.

Well, Merry Chrifsmas anyway. :-)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Hate to be asking for your vote again, but...

It's that time of the year again!  Nitevibe's Annual DJ Dreamteam 
Poll.....

I'm on the list as well as a few other of my fellow AuraSF mates; 
Koroma, Iyad & Floorcraft.  We would ALL greatly appreciate your vote 
and support!

Who's your Favorite DJ?

What better way to kick-off the giving season then to give a big fat 
Thank You! to the local DJs that's most moved & grooved your nights 
away. Folks - It's time once again for San Francisco's 6th Annual DJ 
Dreamteam celebrating our local sonic messiahs who show us how to 
meditate, radiate and proliferate good vibes through dance music. There 
are DJs representing all genres including hip-hop, dancehall, house, 
world, brokenbeat, drum n' bass, breaks, techno and trance, to name a 
few. Ultimately it's your choice. Your voice is what this poll is all 
about, and as always, your votes directly affect the outcome. This is 
the one time where you have a say on the lineup for the annual 
DJDreamteam massive event scheduled early next year. Please remember 
that this poll is supposed to be a fun thing for the community, it's not 
about who's necessarily the best, it's about who's your favorite! So 
keep it fair, keep it fun and let the voting begin! Poll closes on Dec 
14th, results will be announced on Dec 18th.

The voting page is here:
http://www.nitevibe.com/dt07/page1.asp

Be happy.

I've got a good mind to just keep posting Hillary Clinton quotes until  
someone starts throwing up, or until I start getting threatening  
emails ... but I don't think I'd really do that to ya ...

Have a nice weekend, I'll tell you all about the places I've been  
driving this week.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RR: Another mix link from SIMON

this mix is pretty damn good, i'm driving my car around the country  
right now just to make sure it runs for when I drive it back to  
california, and i did the nashville in 5 minutes thing, you know,  
you've all done that, right, anyway, i think i was about 30 minutes  
into the mix when I hit the city and it got real good, and i took a  
video clip on the way out, enjoy ...

What do you do? As a job? I am only able to understand
that you drive a volkswagon all around the country.
Summarizing, that you "are driving a brand new car
around the country just to make sure it will function
when you return to SF."

What am I missing?

I'm really excited that I recently visited Monticello, I found the  
visit much more personal and interesting in a way than going to Mt.  
Vernon, which I last visited a few years ago.  There are tons of  
artifacts that Jefferson owned himself, including much of his original  
library, the chair he sat in as President of the Senate, a job which  
he called an easy and honorable job, as compared to the Presidency,  
which he called a joyful misery, and even Jefferson's shoes!  It's a  
must see for any architecture or history buffs!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Take Back the Santa!

So, some folks didn't make it out for this last weekend's Santarchy 
event.  And others possiby did, but didn't have it go as they had 
imagined.  If you're one of the above, there's actually another SAN 
FRANCISCO santarchy event happening this Sunday.  Read below for the 
details.  Ho!



Tired of Santacon being a daytime activity instead of a nighttime bar
crawl? Tired of ideas like going to Oakland and not being able to get
on the ferry? Tired of having to hike two miles in between drinks?

We are taking back the Santa this Sunday. We're going to have an
old-fashioned bar crawl in the dark with Santas ending up passed out
on the sidewalk with their pants around their ankles.

We'll meet at the Ha-Ra club at 875 Geary at 9 p.m. on Sunday night.
Santas will drink and drink and drink. Bad things will happen.

Bring rape whistles and candles and we'll march through the
Tenderloin. This is all about taking back the Santa. It's Christmas
Eve Eve! We need to get stinking drunk before having to bring toys to
ungrateful children.

Details:

Ha-Ra bar
9 p.m.
Sunday, December 23rd
Then through the Tenderloin and probably to lower Haight afterward.

Need more info? Email to Damnesp.com.

Take Back the Santa!

Speaking of Jefferson, there's a really good book that is simply a 
collection of quotes from the massive amount of writings he did.  It's 
called Light And Liberty; Reflections on The Pursuit Of Happiness 
(http://tinyurl.com/29w75m)

I interviewed the author a couple of years ago.  And during that 
interview he reminded us all of another really good resource into the 
thoughts of one of our founders, which is The Jefferson Bible 
(http://tinyurl.com/yuce4g)

Both are good reads and both give you a much greater understanding of 
the man.

I must say, the whole idea of going to Oakland was pretty retarded.  It
didn't seem like a bad idea at first...  but seriously,  there's nobody out
and about in oakland, not at even JLS on a saturday?!?!?

That said, if you want to get the highest quality, using a good pre-amp is
critical.  I actually have a C-1 I could let you borrow Brandon.  If it were
me, I would also take the time to calibrate the deck used for playback so it
caters more towards the needs for high-quality vs vibration-resistance.
Back the tracking force down as much as you can get away with on your
cartridges.  Then adjust the anti-skating (since it will now be a factor
after removing all that "DJ-spec" weight.  Of course listening is the final
test but remember, you're listening for dynamic range now rather than
compression.  Louder overall isn't better.  You can compress the $%&# out of
it in post but you can never get that dynamic range back later.

3 minutes spent cleaning the record with a quality phono lint brush will
save you 300 minutes trying to clean up the pops and clicks in post.  If you
have some extremely poor plates that are irreplaceable and are fearful they
may be completely unplayable in a few years -hence your desire to digitize
them for all posterity- you can use various types of lubricant to try and
get one last good play from them.  Water is typically the first tried as it
does relatively little damage to the already worn out record.  The worst
case is it doesn't sound right so you let it dry, then are stuck with
perhaps a bit more dust to clean out of it.  I've also used isopropol
alcohol, silicon spray lubricant, gizz, you name it - anything in the name
of audio quality ! ! ! ;)

For a budget recording/edit app, look to Audacity.  Open-source...  sorry
but 100% off is the lowest they can offer =p

It's too bad you can't get a better A/D solution other than the iMic.  It is
truly garbage and seems a waste of your hard effort in doing this.  I have a
very decent Philips card but it samples native only at 48k/16 and 96k/24.
All other frequencies are in fact converted from one of the aforementioned
rates upon getting written to disk (like almost every card made outside of a
pro card from M-Audio or the like).  If you're looking for 44.1k/16 native
you'd have to jump to an M-Audio product at a minimum and at that point,
your back to where you are now, not fitting into the shoestring budget.

For formats, if it works out with your recording app of choice, I would go
with Apple Lossless, FLAC, or uncompressed AIFF.  Apple Lossless or FLAC
will each save you about 50% space over uncompressed AIFF. FLAC is
open-source but also a pain in the ass to work with due to compatibility
issues so the added space savings probably isn't worth it.  Any of these
choices isn't chiseled in stone since you can opt to batch-convert to any
other lossless format in the future with zero degradation.

Good luck and let me know if you want to borrow my audiophile phono preamp.
It is a gazzillion times more accurate than any dj gear.  You're welcome to
the PC with the Philips audio card as well if you decide to capture to
either 48k/16 or 96k/24... I just can't stand to see all that effort put out
for mediocre results from lackluster A/D equipment.

Yeah- what he said in the whole post- I know shit-all about specific  
phono preamps but my experience in the ADC realm can let me put  
emphasis on that.
You've spent how much $$$ over the years on records?
If you're archiving them now, it makes sense to spend the $$$ on a  
pristine ADC.
I'm not entirely up on the current scene (still using an SBLive AKA  
Emu10k from 1997 or so) but M-Audio seems to provide the goodness  
these days for only $99 list: http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Transit-main.html

Buy 3 good cables for phono->preamp->interface and call it done.

I use M-Audio's Transit USB with my G4 and it does an excellent job.  Please

Jam thingie where they play Brazilian EDM music (some with vocals, & I
swear I heard a Brazillian Ghetto Tech song) while they jam on drums, a
bass guitar, & other percussion stuff.... well.. so Chel_c & the guy who
lives there, Travis, well, they had this collab thingie goin' on where
Chel-C played this Techno/ Electro/ Hardcore/ Almost Gabber Music & Travis
sang.... so when they were warming up, Chel-C passed the Mic to me & I
well... I was in kinda a "dunk" fuzzy state & all i could do is harmonize
like these long ass notes that like reverbed & echoed while i sang &
eventually melded into the music Chelsea was playing.. it was kinda neato
actually... i feel bad i couldn't like think of any words to sing or what
to sing other than "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah" in various high
octaves.. almost hitting falceto once...  but that was fun!!!

--During someone's set ummm... i think it mighta been the cowboys.. well..
it was so like trippy 'cause he busted out this track that had the "Our

i want to get Reason 4.0, checked Craigslist, and found someone selling

etc., that seems too good to be true.  what's the catch here?

does Reason have to be 'authorized' like the Adobe apps?  am i going to

Thanks for the tip, I dl'ed and watched.  Awesome movie.

On an unrelated but kinda related side note... 

I watched Groove for the first time after Trip.  I thought it would put me
to sleep as I was just going to bed after about 19 hours of partying, but it
kept me awake.  Some parts were funny, some were dead on.  Either way, I
thought it was just plain cool when I saw this e-mail alias on there.  I had
no idea, and am almost jealous I wasn't around here at that time.  My first
rave was in '00-'01 but down south.  I only went to a handful since then and
am sad I missed all those years, but I am making up for lost time in full
force.  

Have a good evening.

Good lord-

I just started this movie and have no comment beyond "The first five  
minutes of dialog are making me twitch".

It's like it was written by a 10yo for a 4yo- "Hi John, Hi Bill. Hi  
Sally. You remember Jim. Is that a painting John?  It looks like a Van  
gogh.  Yes it is.  That's beautiful John"

Good Fuck- yes I remember the guys fucking name is John- you don't  
have to remind me by saying it every 30 seconds.

We've now spent 9 minutes establishing that yes, in fact John is  
moving away under curious circumstances.

I have a feeling this trains gonna come off the rails in a hurry...

Wow, I am in awe.

I think this is the second-worst movie I've ever seen.

Almost-unbelievably wooden "actors", cliched characters and plot  
twists, ping-pong dialog? Check.
Constant plot explanation treating you like a mentally deficient 10yo?  
Check.
Horrible "jokes" that, like that person driving backwards on the  
freeway, make me NEED TO SEE THE FACE of whoever was responsible for  
them? Check.

You know how some movies are so bad they're comically bad, or bad but  
still interesting?
This is not one of them- It's just bad.
And if I hear "Now that's going too far!" one more FUCKING time, I'm  
going to kick my dog.

So- I have to ask- and I do so because I'm somewhat notorious for  
recommending movies that many other people find utterly unwatchable-  
but I can always explain *why* I found them interesting.
Caligula is a good example- interesting to me for a number of reasons.

So- what on Earth could possibly make you and Peter think this is a  
good movie?

I wanted to wait until I had several episodes under my belt, so I am now
proud to announce my music blog / podcast:
6th Floor Sessions
http://zombie-j.com

Every week(ish) I'll post a new mix I've done or track I've written.  I
focus primarily on dancefloor breaks and dubstep, but anything that has me
spinning around in my office chair is fair game.  It will always be new
material - you read enough blogs that post content from other blogs already.

The podcast is available via iTunes, and podcast reader that accepts XML
feeds, and of course the blog.  More tech details @
http://zombie-j.com/wordpress/?page_id=2

This week's entry (so far) is a new dubstep track hot off the ol' macbook
pro.  turn up the bass and warn the neighbors, this is serious bizness.
 many thanks to my good friend jake boswell for mastering this one.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: breaks and dubstep blog / podcast

I wanted to wait until I had several episodes under my belt, so I am now
proud to announce my music blog / podcast:
6th Floor Sessions
http://zombie-j.com

Every week(ish) I'll post a new mix I've done or track I've written.  I
focus primarily on dancefloor breaks and dubstep, but anything that has me
spinning around in my office chair is fair game.  It will always be new
material - you read enough blogs that post content from other blogs already.

The podcast is available via iTunes, and podcast reader that accepts XML
feeds, and of course the blog.  More tech details @
http://zombie-j.com/wordpress/?page_id=2

This week's entry (so far) is a new dubstep track hot off the ol' macbook
pro.  turn up the bass and warn the neighbors, this is serious bizness.
many thanks to my good friend jake boswell for mastering this one.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] movie recommendation

I took my then GF at the time to see Guccione's Caligula in the theatre 
when it first came out, this was when the uber-pretentious I, Claudius 
was all the rage on teh PBS.

Boy, did she have a melt-down afterwards, but I did manage to talk her 
down, but the sex was never the same afterwards.

Actually ran into her about a month ago after not seeing her for a very, 
very, long time, and then talked with a friend of mine who went out 
w/her afterwards and he confirmed that she really is/was the one that's 
out to lunch.

I also like Tarantino's stuff, he writes scenes of man/woman domestic 
bliss better than anybody else in the business.

The wedding scene in NBK on the bridge between Mickey & Mallory is the 
only representation I've seen on film on how people used to get married, 
*for centuries* before the Catholic Church stuck its slimy paws into it 
and ruined marriage for everybody.

I don't recall, I do remember I was able to wander around for around 20

Good lord-

I just started this movie and have no comment beyond "The first five minutes
of dialog are making me twitch".

It's like it was written by a 10yo for a 4yo- "Hi John, Hi Bill. Hi Sally.
You remember Jim. Is that a painting John?  It looks like a Van gogh.  Yes
it is.  That's beautiful John"

Good Fuck- yes I remember the guys fucking name is John- you don't have to
remind me by saying it every 30 seconds.

We've now spent 9 minutes establishing that yes, in fact John is moving away
under curious circumstances.

I have a feeling this trains gonna come off the rails in a hurry...

Caligula has some dope lesbo scenes.

Woot.

(yes, I took it down to the lowest common denomenator)

There is an Italian version of  the Caligula story that is MUCH more graphic 
and historially accurate. Nasty shit. Can't remember the name,but Geez 
Louise it was awful.

I've learned that the music you listen to plays a big role on your attitude=
, out look on life, and mood. I used to listen to hard trance when I was yo=
unger but now that im older I really love soulful muisc. My favorite top dj=
s are mark farina and ltj bukem. To everyone, what genre of electronica are=
 you interested in and why. I'm here for the music. i dont do raves but i d=
o appreciate good music. So if anyone has any suggestions im open for conve=
sation.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The vibe

Isn't this the EXACT SAME fake message some dude was
posting earlier this year? That time, he really loved
Jungle, had never been to a a rave, had been to a
rave, didn't know what to listen to on his ipod, then
knew everything about music for his ipod, then knew
everything about raves, then his sister did, then his
brain imploded from trying to keep track of all the
lies....

When making up an internet character, for whatever
purpose, might I advise that you keep it simple enough
as to not have to remember what you do and do not
know.

Love,
Giacamo Gianherpules aka Ron Mexico

That's because you are such a nice guy Michael.  

If a girl I was dating used the "E" word, first I'd smoke all her weed, then I'd have sex with her making sure to satisfy myself first, and then I'd ditch her.  

Oh and then I'd ditch her sister too.

Of course this is all an entirely hypothetical situation and not all the sort of stuff I used to do back in the day.

Regards,

Peter

You can't really hate people for using correct terminology

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Wow what a suprise

>From Wikipedia:

Despite the mainstream popularity of the word "electronica" today, it is often shunned or met with disgust by electronic musicians or former ravers. Many of the people who were actually part of the electronic and rave movements firmly believe that the word was invented by the music industry, and is just a press-word for electronic music. This is understandable, because a major part of the rave and electronic movement was an outcry against the "media machine", and many ravers and musicians did not wish for the music industry to have a large part in their lives. This part of the electronic movement has similarities to the punk movement, in that it was not meant to be mainstream.[citation needed]
In 1998, David Reilly of God Lives Underwater denounced the use of "electronica" in reference to his band, suggesting "Some marketing team probably came up with it to make sure there was a separate section at Virgin Megastore." He went on to say that he would prefer the label of "pop band", and also distanced the band from the rave movement: "They just want to take Ecstasy and dance, not listen to lyrics. And we aren't about that."[22]

it's true.  techno is actually a sub-genre of electronica, house is a
sub-genre of electronica, etc.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Wow what a suprise

i can see god lives underwater wanting to be classified as pop.
 they were on the "1500 records" label and did a cover of
depeche mode's "fly on the windscreen" and one of their albums
was titled "live in the so called space-age" (from dm's "some
great reward").

definitely more pop than otherwise.  i'd even go so far to call
them "poseur-pop."

What is being played at undergrounds now adays? I heard that it all started with house music. Then after a while it switched to trance. Where are we at today?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Wow what a suprise

I can't imagine why those pesky ravers don't want to listen to profound lyrics such as these:

Starved myself
>From poisoned love
Memories with traces of
What knocked me out
Knocked me out
Act as if I'm just alright
But I've already lost my sight
And you're treading ground
Without a sound

BRIDGE
Something
For nothing
I know that I haven't given
You that I haven't risen (above)

Fight for love
Or love to fight
Never knew my
Wrong from right
Patiently
I wait for the day
When it hits me
Hardest yet
And it's real
Not second best
My hearts for you
You know it's true

BRIDGE

CHORUS
Please
Believe me
Round and round
Hear the sound
Reality
Crashing into me
I hear the sound
But I can't come down

BRIDGE

CHORUS

i can see god lives underwater wanting to be classified as pop.
they were on the "1500 records" label and did a cover of
depeche mode's "fly on the windscreen" and one of their albums
was titled "live in the so called space-age" (from dm's "some
great reward").

definitely more pop than otherwise.  i'd even go so far to call
them "poseur-pop."

Partying on the level of rave is my eyes an art form.  Conscious parties
push your bondaries, and open your mind, and I don't think it's sad when
people put their focus towards developing and pushing these kind of parties

Subject: [sfraves] what were we talking about again?

Oh yes, the two decades of excess known hereabouts as "rave culture"...=0A=
=0A"Yet a torrent of inquiry issues from our initial question. Is the rave =
a nascent rite de passage and, if so, what is its telos? What is its level =
and quality of efficacy? Is it a ritual of communion, a mass 'return' to a =
'womb' which sees co-inhabitants secure in a nutrient rich and numinous pre=
-separation stage, or an anomic post-partum 'dead-zone' catering for 'escap=
ist' desires and tragic careers in over-expenditure? An 'oceanic experience=

 fully aware 'in the moment' without any internal dialogue separating actio=

 around him. His branch of Buddhism had been brought from Japan where there=
 was emphasis on the need to develop and balance the complementary qualitie=

There are some levels of failure that can be measured, if only =20

Then there are failures that defy measurement, and can only be =20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Wow what a suprise

In our psycho American culture anything that is pleasurable = bad, bad, bad.

You have heard the phrase, "You can't just go around doing whatever you 
like," as if what people naturally like is presumed to be wrong right 
off the bat.

Been that way here since before the USA was founded and it's not going 
to end anytime soon, rave is just another of many cultural sub-sets that 
got caught in the cross-hairs of that fucked-up mentality.

 What is the difference between commercial events and underground events? I=

I imagine that some do, yes.

The banal nature of the content, the scattershot delivery, the horrid  
mispeellings throughout...
And then "Ribonucleic", spelled wrong... IN HIS NAME.
I can only hope that this also triggered the lol-detectors of others.

You severely overestimate the amount of mental cycles I spend on "rave  
culture"- whatever that is :)

There are some levels of failure that can be measured, if only
relatively against previous failures.
Then there are failures that defy measurement, and can only be
evaluated by that first-read metallic taste in your mouth- any further
contemplation serves only to dilute the experience.

> What is the real difference between commercial music and underground music? What is the difference between commercial events and underground events? Im only here to expand my knowledge on the rave culture. I like to collect records and Ive noticed a difference. The commercial records tend to have more emotion and talent while the underground records tend to be more repetative and emotionless. What do you consider to be the main goal of rave music? Is it really just dance music? Or is it meant to make you respond emotionally? With every genre of electronica there is always a style that effects the soul. (uplifting trance, soulful house, happy hardcore, atmospheric drum and bass, etc.) I want to know if it was just me or if these are what raves are about and the rest is just garbage.

accident caused by a crazy soccer mom on our way to Tar-Jay. 
She just *had* to get in the freeway lane ahead of us, and
nearly ran us off the road.  It was awesome.

Speaking of near misses I had one the other day driving through Baton Rouge,
I was coming onto this bridge and someone was stopped in the right lane
unexpectedly. Had a semi to my left and two stopped cars in front of me all
whilst I was doing 90 or so, had to slam the gas to get outta that one. Came
about *this close* to being worm food, it was the shit.

events? Im only here to expand my knowledge on the rave culture. I like to
collect records and Ive noticed a difference. The commercial records tend to
have more emotion and talent while the underground records tend to be more
repetative and emotionless. What do you consider to be the main goal of rave
music? Is it really just dance music? Or is it meant to make you respond
emotionally? With every genre of electronica there is always a style that
effects the soul. (uplifting trance, soulful house, happy hardcore,
atmospheric drum and bass, etc.) I want to know if it was just me or if
these are what raves are about and the rest is just garbage.

My favorite was the time I was on a side street in Palo Alto, tooling 
around with my best friend and his kids on a *Sunday* just puttering 
along in his beater car, when a Stupid Ugly Vehicle came barreling up 
behind us with the woman behind the wheel looking like she was gonna 
have a coronary because we deigned to be in her way, must have been 
doing 60 as she blew by us.

Caught up to her moments later, at a light that went red on her, so we 
had the kids blow her kisses, and wave at her with big laughing smiles.

A tension convention she could do nothing about, literally saw smoke 
come out of her ears because she knew she was being mocked for being a 
psycho.

Actually, what I've got in mind is making a nice, well cooked, meal, 
(prepared by the best Chef the Food Network has to offer, in filmed live 
in Alice Waters's place in Berkeley), out of Jamie Lynne's Spears's late 
term abortion, (with some Fava beans and a nice Chianti, {{sluuurrrp}}} 
on the side), and *then* feeding Jamie and a Japanese school girl the 
eliminated product of that delicious meal out of a the best crystal cup 
that Tiffany's has in stock.

People would pay good money on Pay-Per-View to see that, and the 
advertising revenue on the side from the YouTube video would be through 
the roof.

You poor bastard. I heard Uberzone play an anthem trance remix of jingle
bells while I was candyflipping once in DC. That was one of the saddest,
most depraved moments of my life. And I've seen some sadness and depravity.

Happy Christmas Eve.  I'm meeting my family down in Florida for  
Christmas and I'm spending the night near Jekyll Island so I can take  
some pictures, I guess.  Can you believe that hotel is a national  
monument?  That's what the road signs say.  How arrogant can the  
globalists be, to pull the greatest swindle on the American people and  
then brag about it by making it a national monument.  This is  
outraaaaageous!  I'm definitely getting photos.

More tomorrow.

Trance $B"v(B
Trance did a very promising start in the early nineties (1990's) in Europe, and is currently one of the most promising and influential music genres on the music scene. Trance itself is very wide-scoped, it occupies a lot of territory with a lot of space and brings its influence deeply outside and well beyond its own bounds, that seem to be quite obscure. At the time, many of the currently popular groups, artists, titles of mainstream music are starting to incorporate trance sound into their recordings. Initially trance was mostly non-commercial, but trance is getting more and more publicity now, on TV channels such as Viva and MTV, and in the press. Trance becomes more popularized, thanks to talented trance music DJ's and producers, trance music labels, and even large recording companies. Pop and rock stars are starting to collaborate with or even outsource their recordings to trance music composers and producers. An excellent example, Madonna with their mature, high-quality, semi-trance album Ray Of Light (1998), almost half tracks of which have explicitly clear trance sounding.

Characteristics
Perhaps the most ambiguous genre of dance music, trance could be described as a melodic, more or less freeform style of music, partially derived from house. While there is no strict definition for trance, songs of this genre are usually characterized as being accessible and having anthemic and epic and rifting and psychedelic qualities. Using that as a starting point, a basic trance track could then be described as being comprised of a particular melodic or vocal hook which is given presence over a bassline, a drum pattern, which often includes snare or kick drum rolls to mark important moments, and perhaps one or two other semi-quantified aural elements to provide texture and enhance the rhythm. However, not all trance fits that profile, and often times a song's classification as trance has just as much to do with who is playing it as what it sounds like.
The best way to generally describe the trance genre is that of dance music based around rifts and anthems, which can be either highly energetic or very chilled out. Trance tracks often intermix major and minor chords to create "epic" sounding, similar to classical organ music. Most trance is built around the 4/4 beat, and a lot of trance can be very uplifting. Uptempo, uplifting and often euphoric energetic synthesized sounds pumped by a beat and massive hooks, often with long breakdowns building slowly to create a tension and expectancy on the dance floor. Often with driving off-the-beat basslines and utilizing major and minor chords in sequence, trance tracks can take a central epic form of commercial trance or the form of one of several sub-genres including Euro (Epic) Trance, Goa (Psychedelic, Psy) trance, Hard Trance, and Progressive Trance.
Building Blocks
You can very well understand what trance is all about if you consider both house and techno a 'power supply' or a 'fuel' of trance. Yes, in some ways trance is derived from house and techno, but this derivation is just a matter of taking the proper power supply. Look, airplanes consume diesel oil in order to be capable of flight. They just cannot fly without fuel, yet they are not fuel! They are much more complex than plain, simple diesel petrolium oil. Now draw and see an analogy, airplanes is trance, and diesel fuel is house, that's it. A more important, fundamental baseline of trance is derived from religious and spiritual roots of the East and ancient Eastern culture. It is astonishing, in fact, ambient, beatless form of trance has been there for ages! More information on this is forth below this page. From a pure music producer's standpoint, the following elements build up a basic trance track on top of a solid, house-powered beat and energetic, techno-powered progressive sound:

Rifts, rolls, breakdowns and buildups. 
Short samples often going into 16th and 32nd notes. 
Anthems. 
Highly intermixed major and minor chords. 
These are the essential elements of trance, all of them are very important as they completely change the music sound. Applying even one of them changes the sound to trance-alike. House is a mature, developed musical genre. House music can be very good, but house can never be (and has never been and never supposed to be) as uplifting and as emotional as trance. That's because trance, by its definition, has at least some or all of the above unique characteristics appertaining to trance only, which are not attributable to house in any way. Suppose you have a good house track. Once you start adding/incorporating the above qualities into it, it no longer sounds as house, it first becomes progressive house, and then it simply turns into trance.
History & Evolution
You can arguably trace trance music back to religious roots emanating from a spiritual state of mind reminiscent of shamanism and elements of bhuddism. With this in mind, it's very important that trance age in aggregate can be estimated as hundreds and thousands years. The actual sound of contemporary trance, however, was born as early as 1990 in Germany, and through pioneering trance labels like Dragonfly the sound started to take on a slightly more mainstream appeal during the later 90's. Goa and Psy-trance are arguably older, with their characteristic sounds purportedly emerging in Israel and India. The repetitive nature of much of the early trance tracks provided club-goers with the ideal chance to immerse themselves in a new style of music after a period of relative quiet on what had been termed the "dance" scene.
Arguably a fusion of techno and house, early trance shared much with techno in terms of the tempo and rhythmic structures but also added more melodic overtones which were appropriated from the style of house popular in Europe's club scene at that time. However, the melodies in trance differed from euro/club house in that although they tended to be emotional and uplifting, they did not "bounce around" in the same way that house did. This early trance tended to be characterized by the anthemic qualities described above, and typically involved a break-down portion of the song in which the beat was dropped for a few bars to focus on the melody before bringing the beat back with a renewed intensity. The trance became instantly popular in Europe and spread very quickly. Inevitably, the style was to evolve and as more and more mainstream DJ's picked up on the sound of trance, so the sound became more commercial and more diverse often relegating the traditional trance styles into background sub-genres.
By the mid-1990's, trance had emerged commercially as one of the dominant genres of dance music. Immensely popular, trance found itself filling a niche as edgier than house, more soothing than drum-n-bass, and more accessible than techno. By this time, trance had become synonymous with progressive house and both genres essentially subsumed each other under the commercial banner of "progressive." Artists like Brian Transeau (BT), Paul Van Dyk, Ferry Corsten (Art of Trance), and Underworld came to the forefront as premier producers and remixers, bringing with them the emotional, epic feel of the style. Meanwhile, DJ's like Paul Oakenfold, Sasha, and John Digweed were championing the sound in the clubs and through the sale of pre-recorded mixes. By the end of the 1990's, trance remained commercially huge but had fractured into an extremely diverse genre. Perhaps as a consequence, similar things were happening with the DJ's as well; for example, Sasha and Digweed, who together had helped bring the progressive sound to the forefront, all but abandoned it by 2000, instead spinning a darker mix of the rising "deep trance" style.
In 1996, the UK became the core of the new trance phenomenon taking trance to new heights in UK clubs and out to the clubber's island of Ibiza. DJ's like Paul Oakenfold, Sasha and John Digweed started to open the eyes of the clubbing population to what would probably be best now described as euro trance: epic winding tracks with monumental breakdowns and uplifting lead lines culminating in the ATB and Delirium sounds of 2000. Assisted by well-known producers like Robert Miles, Sash and BT, these tunes struck to the hearts of an audience looking for new energy and excitement in their music. Just as interesting to observe is the creeping effect of trance around the world. While the Israelis and Swedes in particular continue to produce new sounds, American and the new Eastern European markets are absorbed in the trance sounds of a once frenetic European market. Meantime the UK and Canada are pushing the boundaries of hard trance with new genres cropping up like Hard House, a fusion of trance and house.
With such a diverse range of music to satisfy within the genre, it is inevitable that trance becomes a victim of its own success. We've already seen the likes of trance-made DJ's like Paul Van Dyk denounce the genre and its becoming de-facto to slate the genre as old hat. However, for many true trance fans of the mid-nineties, this is ultimately leading bringing their genre back round to what it was designed to be: music for the mind, not music for the masses. The likely path for commercial trance music is either back into the "dance" fold or to once more re-badge itself, maybe as progressive, maybe as epic dance music - whichever route it transpires to follow, trance should be remembered for providing a renaissance of dance music. Currently trance continues to expand the diversity of the genre as expressed through many of its brightest DJ talents.
Euro Trance
A central, neutral form of trance which is probably the simplest to understand. Euro trance is often very uplifting, it is usually around 140 - 145 bpm and has a lot of big rifts. The bass is generally quite heavy and it will often have a female vocal. Due to the big rifts, breakdowns and vocals this style of trance can also be referred to as commercial trance. This form of trance definitely falls into the instant "feel good" category - for many trance-heads, this is how it all started. Currently much harder edged Euro Trance is being referred to as "Hard Trance", in many ways it is similar to Euro, with big, but usually not so "euphoric", rifts and a bit faster, usually around 145 - 150 bpm, often using acid lines.
Goa Trance
Goa trance is form of electronic music and is a style of trance music which originated in the Indian region of Goa. The music has its roots in the popularity of the Goa region in the late 1960's and early 1970's as a hippie mecca, although the actual Goa trance style would not appear until much later. As the tourist influx tapered off in the 1970's and 1980's, a core group remained in Goa, concentrating on improvements in music along with other activities such as yoga, recreational drug use, and various New Age pursuits.
The introduction of techno style and technique to Goa led to what would eventually become the Goa trance style; early pioneers included Goa Gil and Mark Allen. Many "parties" (similar to raves) in Goa revolve entirely around this genre of music; Goa is also often played in other countries at raves, festivals and parties often in conjunction with other styles of trance and techno.
Goa is essentially "dance-trance" music (and was referred to as "Trance Dance" in its formative years), and as such has an energetic beat, almost always at 4/4 and often going into 16th or 32nd notes. A typical number will generally build up to a much more energetic movement in the second half of the track, and then taper off fairly quickly toward the end. Generally 8-12 minutes long, Goa tracks usually have a noticeably stronger bassline than other trance music and incorporate more organic "squelchy" sounds.
Goa trance parties have a visual aspect as well, the use of "fluoro" (fluorescent paint) is common in clothing and decoration. The images are often associate with topics like aliens, hinduism and other religious (especially eastern) images, mushrooms (and other psychedelic imagery), shamanism and technology. Goa trance has a significant following in Israel, brought to that country by former soldiers returning from recreational "post-army trips" to Goa. A great deal of Goa trance is now produced in Israel, but its production and consumption is a global phenomenon.
Goa Trance effectively morphed into psychedelic trance during the latter half of the 1990's. Both styles are generally non-commercial and underground compared to other forms of trance. The goa sound is more likely to be heard at outdoor parties and festivals than in clubs and places like Ibiza. For a short period in the mid-'90's it enjoyed significant commercial success with support from DJ's like Paul Oakenfold. The artist man with no name probably came the closest to being a goa trance "star".
Psychedelic Trance
Psychedelic trance (often referred to as psy trance) is a form of trance music, developed in the late 1990's. Trance has a fast beat, in the range 125 to 150 beats per minute (bpm), compared to ambient trance music and other forms like house and techno. It has a strong bass sound that beats continuously without change and is overlaid by many other rhythms. This type of trance is popular in the UK, but is a truly global phenomenon, and interestingly there is an underrepresentation of American artists, although Israeli artists are well represented. As of 2002 many Japanese artists have started to take in this genre from the influence of UK DJ's.
The club and dance scenes worldwide have been using psychedelic trance in performances along with Goa trance, ambient trance, progressive trance, and minimalist trance. The mixture of Goa and psychedelic trance music is the popular kind of trance performance to many trance listeners. Psychedelic trance can be considered an offshoot of Goa trance. Popular artists that make psychedelic trance include Astral Projection, Space Tribe, Infected Mushroom, Atmos, Total Eclipse, Cosmosis and Simon Posford. Psychedelic trance is often played at outdoor festivals. People at these festivals sometimes consume psychedelic drugs like LSD, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. The festivals often take place over a few days with music being played 24 hours a day.
Ambient Trance
The precursor to Progressive Trance, Ambient Trance is a dreamy, hypnotic and intelligent style of trance, mostly German, that utilizes atmospheric pads, epic melodic progressions and occasionally symphonic arrangements. It is not to be confused with commercial, mainstream trance from artists such as ATB or Darude. At times borrowing elements from the earlier acid movement, such as rezzy 303 leads and minimal percussion, but based more on the spiritual experience that Goa Trance has since trademarked, Ambient Trance is an often-forgotten but extremely influential style that took rave music to a higher and more profound level. Sometimes called "Oldschool Trance" because it has since been left behind for the harder styles popular today.
Ambient Trance is not as much a specific genre as it is a period in the history of dance music's most notorious style. When The Orb and other early dance pioneers were mixing ambient records with current club-oriented sounds, many producers and DJs in the UK and Germany began taking notice. As early as 1990, German musician Harald Bluechel (aka Cosmic Baby) was experimenting with classical piano and synthesizer melodies contrasted against techno rhythms, and in 1993 released one of the most popular trance songs of all time, "Cafe del Mar" (under the pseudonym Energy 52) which is still being remixed today.
Perhaps the most prolific figure in trance, then and now, is Oliver Lieb. Recording under the aliases Paragliders, The Ambush, Spicelab and LSG, Lieb remixed almost every trance producer of note during the 90's and continues to do so today. His albums spanned entire genres, from tribal, ethnic fusion to spacey trance to rough and tough techno. Considered by many to be one of the gods of trance alongside Paul van Dyk, Lieb was a huge reason why the style remained powerful and important in dance cultures around the world.
As with all styles, Ambient Trance eventually morphed into something different and by the mid 90's, it was almost entirely abandoned for harder and more progressive sounds. However, a few producers of that time still remain today producing intelligent trance, among them Humate, Salt Tank, Lieb and Paul van Dyk, albeit in a more modern setting. But most fans of dance music will fondly remember the early and mid-90's as the "good old days" of trance, with some of the most beautiful and profound tracks produced during this time.
Progressive Trance 
This trance is generally more laid back than Euro, it tends to be a lot deeper and has a less commercial edge. It is also usually slower (130 - 140 bpm) and has a wider variety of sounds - many progressive tunes use a lot of tribal techno and breakbeat sounds. The rifts in progressive music are much more subtle than that of Euro and never as uplifting. Progressive music relies more on subtle builds and drops guided by the DJ throughout the night, whereas Euro builds and drops in each individual tune. Recently much progressive trance has moved towards deep tribal sounds and breaks. This is often referred to as "progressive house".
Hard Trance
Hard Trance, as the title suggests, blends traditional trance sounds and structure with harder elements more reminiscent of Acid and Techno. The tempo is generally increased to between 145 and 155 and the kick drum and bass is usually a focus for a clubbing audience.

I call bullshit.  To me, music isn't about controlling you (i.e. your
emotions), but is about an INTERACTION.  that is you take the piece of music
that is being presented to you and you interact with it (i.e. dance is a
form of physical interaction with music).  Trance begs and pushes for almost
a worship/trance state of interaction that is in my eyes, mostly mindless.
What house (and breaks) really do that trance cannot, is be a form of music
that allow for cognitive mindful interaction.  And to be completely honest
psy breaks, experimental, dubstep, and live hardware pushes me farther than
psy or goa trance do.  For example, rabbit in the moon COULD be classified
as psy trance but their breaks and dub influence are what really push the
boundaries.  trance just isn't weird enough to be the most effective form of
psychedelic electronic music in my honest opinion.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

That Christmas party I went to the other night in New York they kept  
playing this song over and over again, they attuned musical  
instruments to it.  It's a pretty catchy tune, though I'm not from New  
York, I guess I might prefer the San Francisco song.

Happy Christmas

--

There's snow in the air, winter is here.
The wind is blowing, the nights are so clear.
There's presents to wrap and cards to send.
It's Christmas in New York again.

- Shilelagh Law, "Christmas in New York Again"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Cyber trance

Mystre is calling it quits as of January 1st tho.

I found out via Bayraves after going out to the Haight, looking to get  
a presale for Trippendicular, and finding reveb all locked up and  
barred in the middle of the afternoon.  Apparently, it's being taken  
over by metalheads in the new year.

Funny thing is, someone on MySpace has been claiming that Mars back in  
the bay area and starting F8 up again.

You're welcome.

Did an old, and former, friend of yours happen to hit a nerve?

Remember they didn't start this thread, *you* fucking did.

Nobody asked you to sub here, Mister RNA.

That's all YOU.

Like the old saying goes, if you can't stand the heat, then stay the 
fuck out of the motherfucking kitchen, you stupid, motherfucking, 
clueless, worthless, piece of shit.

Thank you.

And you go on and have you a GREAT Massacre of Innocents Day, 
http://tinyurl.com/2nna9q otherwise known as Baby Jebus Day.

aight?

Thanks 4 playing, please drive through, twice.

~Nyc

Anybody see his new shirt line @ Armani while shopping this season? There it was, right in the f11cking window. Zipes.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Tiger tiger burning bright ... (was Re: [sfraves]NRR: Tiesto-Armani)

Well its been a pretty wacky Christmas here in the outer Sunset with helicopters flying over for several hours last night and again this morning.  

In case you missed it on the news, we've had an escaped tiger mauling people at the zoo here in SF.  One man and the tiger are now dead and two other victims are in intensive care recovering from the wounds they recieved.

No one knows how the tiger escaped or if the victims were wearing an Armani/Tiesto t-shirts (tigers hate Tiesto), but since the helicopters are flying again this AM one can guess that there may be more victims or escaped tigers found today.  

Happy boxing day!

Peace,

Peter

I give this post a C-

There is little to no originality, and the spelling/grammar just hurts my 
frickin' eyes.

Just to help you out for future postings, I have included a list of words 
you need help with. You can thank me later...

offence = offense
posses = possess
rarelly = rarely
low lifes = low lives
click = clique

Some people take that rave shiit too far. Im like get a life. No offence to 
those that dont posses one. Wether you call it house or drum and bass its 
still music. There is such a thing called balance. Something i rarelly see 
when I post on here. But like i said i appreciate good music. If i had a 
choice between being a musician and a groupie i would choose to be the 
musician. Its sad when low lifes ruin a good thing. Its cool to go to 
parties but its not cool when partying becomes your life. Some are here for 
the music, some are here for the women, and some are here because they have 
nothing better to do. im not goin to waste my time helping people to see 
where they fit in. but it is funny to me when i see someone with no life try 
to fit into something they know nothing about. so next time you choose to 
talk out your ass, dont. All the mature adults that havent fried all their 
brain cells i will probably respond with normal conversation. everyone else 
make a click of idiots and go sit in the middle of the dance floor. thank 
you.

> Characteristics
> Perhaps the most ambiguous genre of dance music, trance could be described 
> as a melodic, more or less freeform style of music, partially derived from 
> house. While there is no strict definition for trance, songs of this genre 
> are usually characterized as being accessible and having anthemic and epic 
> and rifting and psychedelic qualities. Using that as a starting point, a 
> basic trance track could then be described as being comprised of a 
> particular melodic or vocal hook which is given presence over a bassline, 
> a drum pattern, which often includes snare or kick drum rolls to mark 
> important moments, and perhaps one or two other semi-quantified aural 
> elements to provide texture and enhance the rhythm. However, not all 
> trance fits that profile, and often times a song's classification as 
> trance has just as much to do with who is playing it as what it sounds 
> like.
> The best way to generally describe the trance genre is that of dance music 
> based around rifts and anthems, which can be either highly energetic or 
> very chilled out. Trance tracks often intermix major and minor chords to 
> create "epic" sounding, similar to classical organ music. Most trance is 
> built around the 4/4 beat, and a lot of trance can be very uplifting. 
> Uptempo, uplifting and often euphoric energetic synthesized sounds pumped 
> by a beat and massive hooks, often with long breakdowns building slowly to 
> create a tension and expectancy on the dance floor. Often with driving 
> off-the-beat basslines and utilizing major and minor chords in sequence, 
> trance tracks can take a central epic form of commercial trance or the 
> form of one of several sub-genres including Euro (Epic) Trance, Goa 
> (Psychedelic, Psy) trance, Hard Trance, and Progressive Trance.
> Building Blocks
> You can very well understand what trance is all about if you consider both 
> house and techno a 'power supply' or a 'fuel' of trance. Yes, in some ways 
> trance is derived from house and techno, but this derivation is just a 
> matter of taking the proper power supply. Look, airplanes consume diesel 
> oil in order to be capable of flight. They just cannot fly without fuel, 
> yet they are not fuel! They are much more complex than plain, simple 
> diesel petrolium oil. Now draw and see an analogy, airplanes is trance, 
> and diesel fuel is house, that's it. A more important, fundamental 
> baseline of trance is derived from religious and spiritual roots of the 
> East and ancient Eastern culture. It is astonishing, in fact, ambient, 
> beatless form of trance has been there for ages! More information on this 
> is forth below this page. From a pure music producer's standpoint, the 
> following elements build up a basic trance track on top of a solid, 
> house-powered beat and energetic, techno-powered progressive sound:
>
> Rifts, rolls, breakdowns and buildups.
> Short samples often going into 16th and 32nd notes.
> Anthems.
> Highly intermixed major and minor chords.
> These are the essential elements of trance, all of them are very important 
> as they completely change the music sound. Applying even one of them 
> changes the sound to trance-alike. House is a mature, developed musical 
> genre. House music can be very good, but house can never be (and has never 
> been and never supposed to be) as uplifting and as emotional as trance. 
> That's because trance, by its definition, has at least some or all of the 
> above unique characteristics appertaining to trance only, which are not 
> attributable to house in any way. Suppose you have a good house track. 
> Once you start adding/incorporating the above qualities into it, it no 
> longer sounds as house, it first becomes progressive house, and then it 
> simply turns into trance.
> History & Evolution
> You can arguably trace trance music back to religious roots emanating from 
> a spiritual state of mind reminiscent of shamanism and elements of 
> bhuddism. With this in mind, it's very important that trance age in 
> aggregate can be estimated as hundreds and thousands years. The actual 
> sound of contemporary trance, however, was born as early as 1990 in 
> Germany, and through pioneering trance labels like Dragonfly the sound 
> started to take on a slightly more mainstream appeal during the later 
> 90's. Goa and Psy-trance are arguably older, with their characteristic 
> sounds purportedly emerging in Israel and India. The repetitive nature of 
> much of the early trance tracks provided club-goers with the ideal chance 
> to immerse themselves in a new style of music after a period of relative 
> quiet on what had been termed the "dance" scene.
> Arguably a fusion of techno and house, early trance shared much with 
> techno in terms of the tempo and rhythmic structures but also added more 
> melodic overtones which were appropriated from the style of house popular 
> in Europe's club scene at that time. However, the melodies in trance 
> differed from euro/club house in that although they tended to be emotional 
> and uplifting, they did not "bounce around" in the same way that house 
> did. This early trance tended to be characterized by the anthemic 
> qualities described above, and typically involved a break-down portion of 
> the song in which the beat was dropped for a few bars to focus on the 
> melody before bringing the beat back with a renewed intensity. The trance 
> became instantly popular in Europe and spread very quickly. Inevitably, 
> the style was to evolve and as more and more mainstream DJ's picked up on 
> the sound of trance, so the sound became more commercial and more diverse 
> often relegating the traditional trance styles into background sub-genres.
> By the mid-1990's, trance had emerged commercially as one of the dominant 
> genres of dance music. Immensely popular, trance found itself filling a 
> niche as edgier than house, more soothing than drum-n-bass, and more 
> accessible than techno. By this time, trance had become synonymous with 
> progressive house and both genres essentially subsumed each other under 
> the commercial banner of "progressive." Artists like Brian Transeau (BT), 
> Paul Van Dyk, Ferry Corsten (Art of Trance), and Underworld came to the 
> forefront as premier producers and remixers, bringing with them the 
> emotional, epic feel of the style. Meanwhile, DJ's like Paul Oakenfold, 
> Sasha, and John Digweed were championing the sound in the clubs and 
> through the sale of pre-recorded mixes. By the end of the 1990's, trance 
> remained commercially huge but had fractured into an extremely diverse

> DJ's as well; for example, Sasha and Digweed, who together had helped 
> bring the progressive sound to the forefront, all but abandoned it by 
> 2000, instead spinning a darker mix of the rising "deep trance" style.
> In 1996, the UK became the core of the new trance phenomenon taking trance

> not music for the masses. The likely path for commercial trance music is 
> either back into the "dance" fold or to once more re-badge itself, maybe 
> as progressive, maybe as epic dance music - whichever route it transpires 
> to follow, trance should be remembered for providing a renaissance of 
> dance music. Currently trance continues to expand the diversity of the 
> genre as expressed through many of its brightest DJ talents.
> Euro Trance
> A central, neutral form of trance which is probably the simplest to 
> understand. Euro trance is often very uplifting, it is usually around 
> 140 - 145 bpm and has a lot of big rifts. The bass is generally quite 
> heavy and it will often have a female vocal. Due to the big rifts, 
> breakdowns and vocals this style of trance can also be referred to as 
> commercial trance. This form of trance definitely falls into the instant 
> "feel good" category - for many trance-heads, this is how it all started. 
> Currently much harder edged Euro Trance is being referred to as "Hard 
> Trance", in many ways it is similar to Euro, with big, but usually not so 
> "euphoric", rifts and a bit faster, usually around 145 - 150 bpm, often 
> using acid lines.
> Goa Trance
> Goa trance is form of electronic music and is a style of trance music 
> which originated in the Indian region of Goa. The music has its roots in 
> the popularity of the Goa region in the late 1960's and early 1970's as a 
> hippie mecca, although the actual Goa trance style would not appear until 
> much later. As the tourist influx tapered off in the 1970's and 1980's, a 
> core group remained in Goa, concentrating on improvements in music along 
> with other activities such as yoga, recreational drug use, and various New 
> Age pursuits.
> The introduction of techno style and technique to Goa led to what would 
> eventually become the Goa trance style; early pioneers included Goa Gil 
> and Mark Allen. Many "parties" (similar to raves) in Goa revolve entirely 
> around this genre of music; Goa is also often played in other countries at 
> raves, festivals and parties often in conjunction with other styles of 
> trance and techno.
> Goa is essentially "dance-trance" music (and was referred to as "Trance 
> Dance" in its formative years), and as such has an energetic beat, almost 
> always at 4/4 and often going into 16th or 32nd notes. A typical number 
> will generally build up to a much more energetic movement in the second 
> half of the track, and then taper off fairly quickly toward the end. 
> Generally 8-12 minutes long, Goa tracks usually have a noticeably stronger 
> bassline than other trance music and incorporate more organic "squelchy" 
> sounds.
> Goa trance parties have a visual aspect as well, the use of "fluoro" 
> (fluorescent paint) is common in clothing and decoration. The images are 
> often associate with topics like aliens, hinduism and other religious 
> (especially eastern) images, mushrooms (and other psychedelic imagery), 
> shamanism and technology. Goa trance has a significant following in 
> Israel, brought to that country by former soldiers returning from 
> recreational "post-army trips" to Goa. A great deal of Goa trance is now 
> produced in Israel, but its production and consumption is a global 
> phenomenon.
> Goa Trance effectively morphed into psychedelic trance during the latter 
> half of the 1990's. Both styles are generally non-commercial and 
> underground compared to other forms of trance. The goa sound is more 
> likely to be heard at outdoor parties and festivals than in clubs and 
> places like Ibiza. For a short period in the mid-'90's it enjoyed 
> significant commercial success with support from DJ's like Paul Oakenfold. 
> The artist man with no name probably came the closest to being a goa 
> trance "star".
> Psychedelic Trance
> Psychedelic trance (often referred to as psy trance) is a form of trance 
> music, developed in the late 1990's. Trance has a fast beat, in the range 
> 125 to 150 beats per minute (bpm), compared to ambient trance music and 
> other forms like house and techno. It has a strong bass sound that beats 
> continuously without change and is overlaid by many other rhythms. This 
> type of trance is popular in the UK, but is a truly global phenomenon, and 
> interestingly there is an underrepresentation of American artists, 
> although Israeli artists are well represented. As of 2002 many Japanese 
> artists have started to take in this genre from the influence of UK DJ's.
> The club and dance scenes worldwide have been using psychedelic trance in 
> performances along with Goa trance, ambient trance, progressive trance, 
> and minimalist trance. The mixture of Goa and psychedelic trance music is 
> the popular kind of trance performance to many trance listeners. 
> Psychedelic trance can be considered an offshoot of Goa trance. Popular 
> artists that make psychedelic trance include Astral Projection, Space 
> Tribe, Infected Mushroom, Atmos, Total Eclipse, Cosmosis and Simon 
> Posford. Psychedelic trance is often played at outdoor festivals. People 
> at these festivals sometimes consume psychedelic drugs like LSD, ecstasy 
> and psychedelic mushrooms. The festivals often take place over a few days 
> with music being played 24 hours a day.
> Ambient Trance
> The precursor to Progressive Trance, Ambient Trance is a dreamy, hypnotic 
> and intelligent style of trance, mostly German, that utilizes atmospheric 
> pads, epic melodic progressions and occasionally symphonic arrangements. 
> It is not to be confused with commercial, mainstream trance from artists 
> such as ATB or Darude. At times borrowing elements from the earlier acid 
> movement, such as rezzy 303 leads and minimal percussion, but based more 
> on the spiritual experience that Goa Trance has since trademarked, Ambient 
> Trance is an often-forgotten but extremely influential style that took 
> rave music to a higher and more profound level. Sometimes called 
> "Oldschool Trance" because it has since been left behind for the harder 
> styles popular today.
> Ambient Trance is not as much a specific genre as it is a period in the 
> history of dance music's most notorious style. When The Orb and other 
> early dance pioneers were mixing ambient records with current 
> club-oriented sounds, many producers and DJs in the UK and Germany began 
> taking notice. As early as 1990, German musician Harald Bluechel (aka 
> Cosmic Baby) was experimenting with classical piano and synthesizer 
> melodies contrasted against techno rhythms, and in 1993 released one of 
> the most popular trance songs of all time, "Cafe del Mar" (under the 
> pseudonym Energy 52) which is still being remixed today.
> Perhaps the most prolific figure in trance, then and now, is Oliver Lieb. 
> Recording under the aliases Paragliders, The Ambush, Spicelab and LSG, 
> Lieb remixed almost every trance producer of note during the 90's and 
> continues to do so today. His albums spanned entire genres, from tribal, 
> ethnic fusion to spacey trance to rough and tough techno. Considered by 
> many to be one of the gods of trance alongside Paul van Dyk, Lieb was a 
> huge reason why the style remained powerful and important in dance 
> cultures around the world.
> As with all styles, Ambient Trance eventually morphed into something 
> different and by the mid 90's, it was almost entirely abandoned for harder 
> and more progressive sounds. However, a few producers of that time still 
> remain today producing intelligent trance, among them Humate, Salt Tank, 
> Lieb and Paul van Dyk, albeit in a more modern setting. But most fans of 
> dance music will fondly remember the early and mid-90's as the "good old 
> days" of trance, with some of the most beautiful and profound tracks 
> produced during this time.
> Progressive Trance
> This trance is generally more laid back than Euro, it tends to be a lot 
> deeper and has a less commercial edge. It is also usually slower (130 - 
> 140 bpm) and has a wider variety of sounds - many progressive tunes use a 
> lot of tribal techno and breakbeat sounds. The rifts in progressive music 
> are much more subtle than that of Euro and never as uplifting. Progressive 
> music relies more on subtle builds and drops guided by the DJ throughout 
> the night, whereas Euro builds and drops in each individual tune. Recently 
> much progressive trance has moved towards deep tribal sounds and breaks. 
> This is often referred to as "progressive house".
> Hard Trance
> Hard Trance, as the title suggests, blends traditional trance sounds and 
> structure with harder elements more reminiscent of Acid and Techno. The 
> tempo is generally increased to between 145 and 155 and the kick drum and 
> bass is usually a focus for a clubbing audience.
> Trance Labels
>
> Platipus, Kinetic, Ministry Of Sound, Dragonfly, Perfecto, Bedrock
> Trance DJ's & Producers
>
> Paul Van Dyk, DJ Tiesto, Armin Van Buuren, Paul Oakenfold, John Digweed,

Dear Bitch:

Have you tried looking on the Internet?  A strange concept apparently...

Hint for the Internet disabled DJ Import and others seeking goa trance 
sounds:

1. type http://www.google.com into your web browser's address field and hit 
enter
2. wait for the Google home page to load
3. type the words "goa trance mix" into Google's search box and hit enter
4. click on the results until you find what you want.

I found several good mixes in about 30 seconds and I didn't look very hard.

If this procedure seems too complicated for you,  may I suggest that you 
forget about goa trance entirely and pick up a copy of Britney Spears' new 
album instead?  No need to stress yourself out looking for these "impossible 
to find" goa trance mixes.

Thnx.

Peter

My god I hope not. Goa trance makes me want to shoot myself in the face.
Repeatedly.

i heard the gingerbread psytrance event this last week before xmas was 
awesome -- the place was decked out with string art decorations back 
from the thump days. too bad i didnt make it over there. if psytrance is 
on an upswing and has moved away from the repetitively lame super-evil 
shit then maybe i'll start attending again.

Subject: [sfraves] A report from late 2007-era Berlin, plus my musings (rant) on why SF is not Berlin.

Hello hello.  This is Chelsea Faith, reporting from Berlin.  I thought I'd
give a little report, after having been here for a week of my month stay.

Ahh Berlin.... a very special place where you can go out, take ecstasy, and
dance to techno in a packed club until 10am... on *Christmas*.  Gotta love
this place.

Last time I was here (in March) I was surprised to hear so much melodic
techno- Fairmont, Extrawelt, Patrick Chadronnet, etc etc.  Apparently now
this sound has been relegated to more mainstream clubs where raver
thugs from Brandenburg hang out.  (Brandenburg is to Berlin what the suburbs
of the South Bay are to SF).  So, most people are over it.  Things change
quickly here.

I've been hearing a bit of a retro thing going on here- not retro as in the
80s electro business that's taken over almost everything in SF, but more of
a return to Berlin's early 90s techno roots.  I've been hearing techno
that's deep, driving, hypnotic, and heady, much like the minimal of yore.
There's still the klicker-klacker minimal stuff around too, but in general
things have taken a bit of a turn for the deeper. Classic minimal sounds,
not minimal as in short, clipped, digital stuff, but more minimal as in
structure- gradual, evolving changes. I am hearing the influence of "Energy
Flash" in so many tracks, namely the use of crash cymbal, deep deep bass,
and those heavily verbed-out claps that still give me shivers. This is music
made with new technology by people who still know how to program a real drum
machine. A good balance of old and new.

Another sound I've been hearing is this very sparse, percussive, effected,
and rhythmically complex techno.  The arrangements are extremely sparse, but
continually changing - almost the opposite of what used to be called
'minimal'.  What I love about these tracks is that they are so heady and
spaced out, but still major dancefloor movers, designed for that special
moment around 7:30am.  Hi-hats will pan from one side to the other, a
heavily delayed "blooooooop!" might just pop up when you least expect it,
and bursts of white noise are everywhere.  It's psychedelic without being in
your face about it, maintaining its elegance. Though the percussion is
relatively thin, the beats are still driving and the bass is mega deep.  A
friend of mine here described this sound as techno created with the
techniques and aesthetic of minimal.  It's stripped down and tripped out,
but still pretty bangin by 2007 standards.

Berlin is pretty special, of course we know this.  The musical climate here
is so open, fresh, and fertile.  We have a pretty solid minimal scene in SF
now (as I'm sure you've noticed by now), but it's nothing like Berlin.
There are tons of reasons why there is such a unique and amazing music scene
here, I won't go over all the history and other blah blah blah stuff, but
there is one huge difference I see between the two cities: emphasis on local
talent.  Techno is made here in Berlin, there are so many great DJs,
producers, record labels, record shops, clubs, etc.  Parties here are often
driven by local acts. SF has a strong techno community as well, as you can
see from the near-nightly minimal club events happening in the city, but I
see a couple major issues that prevent SF from reaching the level of a city
like Berlin-

For one, everything is imported.  From the headliners flying in from Sweden,
Germany, or Detroit, to the legions of DJs playing the Latest Techno MegaHit
from M_nus, it all comes from outside.  I don't think this is because of any
shortage on talent, there are many people creating techno in the Bay Area, I
know a lot of you!  The party scene is strong in SF, but that's just it -
it's a party scene, not a music scene. It's a promoter scene. The
two-headliners-two-residents formula that pretty much rules all techno
events in the Bay Area is stifling. There is little room for growth. I know
there are local DJs that play out regularly, but there are only, what, seven
of you? And you only get booked because you're a promoter who books yourself
to play at every party you throw (I mean... ahem... you're a "resident")...
am I wrong?  I know how great it feels to bring out a headliner you love and
watch hundreds of smiling people get off to the music you selected for them.
And I know that it's important to get some cross-pollination going, getting
new sounds and ideas coming in from other places. I also know that many
promoters feel entitled to play at every event they throw because.... well,
it's their event, they can do what they want (or, they worked hard for it,
they deserve it, they paid for it, etc, whatever). But another important
thing is balance, and we don't have very much of that.  Sure, bringing out
fantastic headliners from around the world brings exposure to the music, but
haven't we passed that phase yet?  Minimal is everywhere- I'm expecting to
hear Loco Dice in a supermarket any day now.  Isn't there room to support
and develop local talent by now, as well as continue to bring headliners
from other parts of the world? Can't we do both?  It's been proven that
techno works pretty well here, so now would be a good time to experiment
with the formula, while people are still paying attention.

Another thing I see holding SF back is its identity crisis.  The local
DJs/residents here are trying so hard to emulate what they perceive to be a
European sound.  There isn't a whole lot of originality.  I hear the same
tracks over and over, played by every DJ.  (If I hear 'RUOK' one more
time... good lord, enough with that shit! Yes, I am ok. No, I don't have to
puke!)  We obsess over the latest tracks from Europe and Detroit, and strive
to emulate whatever's hot in Berlin right now, but never think to just be
ourselves.  Sure, imitation can lead to new innovations - Berlin was
imitating Detroit, after all. But originality is worth almost nothing in SF.
Part of the magic of Berlin is the way DJs and producers are so simply being
themselves, effortlessly. They aren't pretending to be something they're not
- Berlin is Berlin, and that's it.  SF is just buying into the global
minimal explosion, rather than creating its own sound.  There is no SF
techno sound.  This also goes with the over-emphasis on
out-of-town headliners.  Without creating something original, and without
creating something locally, techno in San Francisco is going to fade out
like any other normal fad. (Nuskool breaks anyone?)

So, yes, ok, maybe I am a little biased about all this, being a local techno
live pa. Really biased, in fact.  On the one hand, I feel like I should be
happy that the music I love is finally popular in my city. On the other
hand, the minimal boom has killed the local techno scene that used to exist.
Funny, we used to bitch about how none of us ever got booked because there
were no techno parties, nowhere for us to play - now there are more techno
parties than you can count, laptop DJs and minimal club nights are a dime a
dozen, but my American passport doesn't really help me get gigs in my
European-headliner-obsessed city. (A friend of mine here in Berlin suggested
I re-import myself - move to Europe and then get booked to play in San
Francisco. Ha.) I've heard people complain about local techno folks moving
to Berlin.... "Another local producer moved to Berlin. They keep leaving,
one after another!"  As if techno producers moving to Berlin are giving up,
quitters, going AWOL. But they're smart.  There's a reason why we're all
leaving. San Francisco's party scene (or rather, promoter scene) does not
support local producers, period. Nope. Does not. Why should we stay here?
To support the local scene or whatever?  What's the point of staying when
the scene does not support us? We're just here to take your flyers, help you
reach your bar minimum for the night, believe your hype, and be pawns. Maybe
we won't get booked in Berlin either, but at least in Berlin there is better
music and more efficient public transportation!

There is TONS of interest in techno in San Francisco right now, and this is
a great time to start something (well, I've been saying that for a long
time, but now is really a good time I think).  So, I conclude, here are a
couple things we need to get over in order to elevate our music scene-

-Kill the headliner/residents formula, or party formulas in general. Try
something different. There are all kinds of different parties here in
Berlin, with out of town headliners, locals, DJs, live pa's, laptops,
hardware, vinyl, etc. Parties happen in all types of venues too, not the
same club each time. (My favorite example is Reclaim the Sparkasse, renegade
parties that are held in the front room of banks, where the ATMs are.)

-Be yourself, be original, create something.  Sorry, I know, this is tired
advice that you've been hearing from your mom and athletic shoe commercials
since you were born, but it's still the truest thing ever.  Forget about the
top 10 on Beatport, and just do your thing.

I could go on, but I don't want to rant and nag too much.  You catch my
drift.  I don't usually post long, opinionated rants on SFR, for fear of
being shit on and looked down upon, but I feel like I don't have much to
lose.

Oh no.  I truly am one of you now.  It happened. I am jaded.


Love Chelsea

More Berlin reports to come, if you guys are interested.

Have you ever listened to anything that's considered QUALITY goa? Yes, there
was definitely a lot of grade A SHITE released, but that's true for ever
single genre of EDM and we all know that. I recommend that you try to ignore
your preconceptions and check out some Hallucinogen, old Astral Projection,
or Pleiadians. Also, some damn high quality mixes were released by Tsuyoshi
Suzuki. It might not change your mind, but it will give you a greater
exposure to the style. Give it a shot, and if you need help locating some of
the stuff I can help you out; just send me an email.

I used to hate dnb because I considered it all tweaker, elitist junglist
crap. Then I was introduced to some stuff that didn't suck. I'm not saying
the same will happen to you, but making sweeping statements about an entire
genre may sometimes be naive.

Subject: [sfraves] San Fran New Year Events

I was very excited to see that Krafty Kuts was due to Play San Francisco 
this New Years Eve, but for $60, plus beer and everything else this 
going to be $100 each!?!? I don't have that........
There must be an event which those of us who don't have tones of spare 
cash can attend this NYE? Anyone?
Thanks, Jon. www.jonstarbuck.co.uk

Subject: [sfraves] Gianni send his Love to SFR

I spoke w/ Gianni tonight (well.. lastnight) for a pretty long time... he
wanted everyone who remembers him here in the list that he misses y'all &
sends Proggy Trance Love to you all!!!

As for a mondo update on him... he lives in Santa Rosa still, has a
family, he married a China Exotic Dancer Mail Order Bride & had a kid w/
her.. his kid's 8 months old now, he own a sheep breeding farm & makes
clothes oh yeah.. he also has chickens, geese, he actually owns Zebras on
his farm, & a few horses & goats & cows... he's also in the butter
churning business & sells fresh churned butter!!!

OK.. For real though ... he is a proud Daddy, he owns 3 bars up there, &
he's the same ol' Gianni who likes to laugh at everything!!!

Ummm.. if you wanna find out more about his life...i guess look for his
myspace page :)

Hope y'all Groovy!! Night Night!!

I am one of 2 promoters in the DC area pushing Techno and I feel you on the=
 resident/headliner tip.

We have tried local parties though here in DC and they just fail. No one sh=
ows up. No one wants to support.
It's very hard to support and grow a local scene in an american city when n=
o one wants to come out....even when it's FREE.

I wish I had a good answer for you chelsea, but that was a great read nonet=
heless.
I think it really comes down to just not enough demand for the music (at le=
ast that is the case in DC)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A report from late 2007-era Berlin, plus my musings (rant) on why SF is not Berlin.

I loved this posting Chelsea and hope to hear more reports from Berlin.  

One thing I found interesting is contrasting your description of the local techno scene, "There is no SF techno sound" with the late nineties house scene.  There definitely was/is a unique SF house sound, but still many of the same issues with imported headliners, closed lineups, little innovation party-wise, and often just boring music.    IMO anyhow.

Regards,

Peter

Subject: RE: [sfraves] commercial vs underground

I'd like to take a stab at this one if I may.

For me the difference between commercial and underground is, and has
always been, about the connections you make with people. The quality of
people you meet in each of those scenes is always different. I met
people at some underground events 10 years ago that I am still friends
with today.

It's the same when you're talking about any music scene, not just EDM.
It's easier to find good quality people that you have a lot in common
with at a small punk club than, say, at Lollapalooza or Woodstock.=20

Hands down, I've ALWAYS had more fun and met more cool people at small
underground events rather than at massives... and it's those parties
that always stick out in my mind and make me smile when I think back to
those days.


Thanks,
=20

Subject: [sfraves] commercial vs underground

What is the real difference between commercial music and underground
music? What is the difference between commercial events and underground
events? Im only here to expand my knowledge on the rave culture. I like
to collect records and Ive noticed a difference. The commercial records
tend to have more emotion and talent while the underground records tend
to be more repetative and emotionless. What do you consider to be the
main goal of rave music? Is it really just dance music? Or is it meant
to make you respond emotionally? With every genre of electronica there
is always a style that effects the soul. (uplifting trance, soulful
house, happy hardcore, atmospheric drum and bass, etc.) I want to know
if it was just me or if these are what raves are about and the rest is
just garbage.

With music's digital explosion, and all the opportunities for music making
collaboration technology affords us there's a ton of global
cross-pollination that could easily drown out the sound of M_nus and other
copy-cats.

Because of this, I'm observing that the two main references for techno :
Berlin and Detroit, are going to give way to a variety of sounds drawn from
a huge variety of traditions, technologies and methods.

It's really exciting to participate in sample making, swapping and
collaboration with folks all over the world with none of the typical frames
of reference, even shunning the standard fave 303 or 808s. In fact, there's
a huge role for indigenous music and rhythm here in the modern-primal
dancefloor (no, I'm not talking about Samim's "Heater" accordians either).

Another perspective: We heard recently from producers and promoters in
Switzerland who were once fueling the minimal bandwagon that their main
source of inspiration these days is 90's era San Fran and Chicago house.

Interesting!  Now I am curious if anyone is using samples from old Panhandle recordings stuff?  

Any recommendations for techno drawing on 90s era SF or Chi-town house?  

Thanks!

Peter

Thanks ever so much, Chelsea, for this well-written and informative report
on the Berlin techno community.  Any experience with the house scene?

I, for one, eagerly await more reports from you.

Much love,

It's not location that makes an event underground, it's the attitudes of
the people involved with the event.

=20

You have to look at the mentality of the people involved. What is their
motivation for throwing an event? Are they interested in booking major
headliners, packing people in like sardines, and making money hand over
fist selling bottles of water for $6 a piece? Or are they interested in
hosting an event that is comfortable, that has a fun and relaxed
atmosphere, that not only is a good place for music but is also a good
place to collaborate, meet cool new people and share ideas... perform
random acts of self-expression... and sell water for a buck (or give it
away for free)?

=20

Where is the best place to hold an event is the wrong question to be
asking. You should be asking yourself, what kind of event to I want to
hold? What is my motivation? How do I want my event to be remembered?=20

=20

The bottom line here is this: Do you want a bunch of DJ's to be the
entire focus of the party experience, or do you want your partygoers to
create their own experiences? That's the difference between commercial
and underground to me.

Here's another way to look at it...

=20

Commercial vs underground are complete polar opposites, coming strictly
from a marketing standpoint. A true underground event doesn't have any
promotion other than word of mouth and *maybe* a flyer with a date and a
phone number. True underground events aren't sponsored, endorsed, or
otherwise affiliated with any products or services that would be
considered in the commercial market. That includes venues and sometimes
even DJ's. People who throw underground events aren't interested in
making money, they are more about the people and the experiences they
will create.

=20

Either way, it still boils down to motivation. And attitude.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A report from late 2007-era Berlin, plus my musings (rant) on why SF is not Berlin.


dittoditto.  This has actually inspired me to think it's time to take

For those who enjoy a more pure percussive techno sound, you won't want to
miss Fanon Flowers tonight at Anu.

 With a history of solid techno productions dating back to 1992 and a 2000
DEMF performance to his credit, Detroit native Fanon Flowers is credited for
being part of Detroit's 3rd wave of techno. Though not a household name in
techno like compadres Claude Young and Jeff Mills, Flowers' imprints have
made their way into the record bags of long-time Detroit techno followers,
and into the sets of influencial producers such as Adam Beyer and Surgeon. .


Recently, Flowers moved from Detroit to Los Angeles, where he's working on
another label project, based on the sounds of Berlin and Detroit, which aims
to move the classic sound forward.

His live PA, which debuts in SF tonight, will surely be an indication of
things to come for West Coast techno.

"Do you think google is really the place to find underground music?"

Yes.  Using a search engine is certainly one good way to find non-commercial 
and underground music.

However I note that previously on sfraves Chris opined: "What is the real 
difference between commercial music and underground music?"

You see oh clueless one, generally underground music actually requires some 
effort on the part of the listener to locate, obtain, and enjoy said music. 
It is supposed to be challenging.  There are lots of reasons for this, it is 
not merely elitism as I expect you believe.  Commercial music is designed to 
sell and that means it has to be easily accessible to a wide audience. 
Sales are not the primary purpose of undergound music therefore neither is 
accesibility.  But that's all changed now with the Internet.  We can get 
underground music almost as weasily as commercial music.  Unless you happen 
to be a Google retard of course.

Hint: use Google to find places that have mixes you like and/or links to 
them.

For example in this genre I found http://www.psypix.org 
http://www.psynews.org  and http://www.tranceaddict.com all had Goa mixes 
available.

e.g. I found a live set from Magic Dave which I enjoyed.  I downloaded a few 
other sets which I haven't listened to yet.  I found so many Goa mixes in 
fact, that I haven't had time to download or listen to them all.  i probably 
never will.

Why don't you post links to mixes you liked yourself instead of the usual 
mindless trolling?  Of course that would imply you are actually interested 
in music rather than just being an annoyance here.

Which is it?  I think I know the answer.

Peter

Yea i tried that but apparently i wasnt satisfied by the results. I thought 
maybe someone on the list might have a friend or know someone that 
specializes in the genre. Do you think google is really the place to find 
underground music? Well since you found several good mixes why dont you just 
post them. just a thought.

Oh my gawd that is sooo 2006 now, plus you made me play it at 
every party you were at ;-)

I demand a new green-screen video of Osby, maybe swimming with 
dolpins, or riding in a mortorcycle gang. Get to it!

A majority of the older goa isn't being released anymore. I recommend
signing up on discogs.com and trading/buying music on there; you'll be able
to find a lot of the classic stuff. Just don't bite more than you can chew;
the higher levels of record collecting are comparable to a crack addiction.

Umm, bullshit.  

But if anyone out there seriously wants to educate themselves try talking to 
Peter at Ceiba in the Haight or go here http://www.suntriprecords.com or here http://www.doofrecords.net or here: http://www.psyshop.com/ or ...

In the meantime, check this video to get the Goa flavor: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6365996398406388722

Includes a scene with Peter Z from Cieba records and some other folks you might know...FWIW.

Peter

Subject: RE: [sfraves] goa trance

Now this fuckbag claims to have SO MANY RECORDS???

Look asshole just go away. Its obvious you are
promoting something, as your lame stories and
questions never make sense, nor are they true, nor do
they ever maintain your fake persona. 

You're an idiot. Since you are going to the
Slik-E-Loot store, should we all ASSume you are one of
 the shop owners, begging for customers?

Last time you were in to Jungle, now you are a goa
freak? Don't you know that all the cool people with
dreads that used to be into goa are into breaks now?

You are a see-thru POS.

You're everyones Bitch. I'm gonna turn you out.

Michael, you got a harness and ball-gag for Chris aka
dj.import aka bitch?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] goa trance

That would be great...

Except he has made up a bunch of stories, from what is
electronic music and what should I get for my ipod, to
what is a rave, to I am an old raver.... from what is
Jungle to a jungle expert, and now what is goa trance,
to I have so many records... He once claimed to own no
electronic music but liked it after being taken to
raves back in the day by his older sister.. etc etc...

He/it is just totally full of shit, and on here to
promote some agenda as yet to be determined....

Subject: [sfraves] Hey Bitch....

I heard the re-opened to SF Zoo. You should go taunt
the tigers rather than the sfravers. It would be more
exciting, and might make you famous... or infamous,
depending on your perspective. There are tigers in
India, and you might best taunt them with goa trance.
It would certainly make most people angry, to be
caged, and forced to listen to it.

Let me know how that works out for you. Or maybe I can
read about  it online.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] goa trance

What exaclty is your mental malfunction Mr. DJ Import Psy Fan Ribonucleaic Asswipe?

Why do you care what we think?  Maybe we "think raves are so fuckin special", or maybe we don't.  So what?  What's it to you?

And BTW no one here cares what you think about raves.  We are all intelligent enough to form and maintain our own opinions and world views.  You are not impressing anyone with these phony questions and made up stories.

Maybe you should think about why you are posting here and why you imagine anyone will listen to anything you have to say at this point.  

Or maybe you just need to up the dose on your meds...

Happy new year!  Now fuck off.

Peter

You continue giving him what he wants.

Why do you care what we think?  Maybe we "think raves are so fuckin special", or maybe we don't.  So what?  What's it to you?

And BTW no one here cares what you think about raves.  We are all intelligent enough to form and maintain our own opinions and world views.  You are not impressing anyone with these phony questions and made up stories.

Maybe you should think about why you are posting here and why you imagine anyone will listen to anything you have to say at this point.  

Or maybe you just need to up the dose on your meds...

Happy new year!  Now fuck off.

Peter

Look asshole just go away. Its obvious you are

You're an idiot. Since you are going to the
Slik-E-Loot store, should we all ASSume you are one of
the shop owners, begging for customers?

Last time you were in to Jungle, now you are a goa
freak? Don't you know that all the cool people with
dreads that used to be into goa are into breaks now?

You are a see-thru POS.

You're everyones Bitch. I'm gonna turn you out.

Michael, you got a harness and ball-gag for Chris aka

The computer he's using is in likely Oakland and he likely uses Comcast
as his ISP. This assertion is based on the IP adress in the
X-Originating-IP header in his mails, which is 24.23.224.165.
Other conclusions are based on data returned by using whois and traceroute.

Hotmail, Gmail, and others usually use a mail header such as this
to track abuse. If one doesn't use a proxy, then one leaks this
information on each email sent.

Note that this header hasn't changed on any of the 18 or so posts
he's made to the list.

My take is he's a person (troll?!) who's listserv experience is low,
has maybe been to a few of the undergrounds in Oakland, is new to the
scene, and has annoyed more than a few people on the list. Maybe he's a
narc or an informant, but I doubt it, since pissing off people is counter
to gaining people's trust, which a narc or an informant needs.

Re: events being posted to sfraves, most of the undergrounds I've
been to aren't posted here anyway.

A+ to Holt on the header ino...apparently Yahoo Mail strips that info?  Does not show up under "full header" anyway...

As for the rest, I have to respectfully disagree.  "Chris" is almost certainly a pseud for someone else subscribed to the list.      He has posted here under multiple aliases and from multiple email addresses (giftofgab86).  People like this almost always have multiple subs so that they can still read the list after the troll address gets banned.

IP ban (if it's possible). But honestly, it's probably easier to avoid
feeding the troll. Although, we can't conclude that he is one; I've seen a
lot of kids try to find out (or at least act like) they know everything
about the party scene after their first shindig. Although such a situation
seems less of a problem in the bay, it is more visible in the socal scene
were the crowds are much younger. For instance, I used to go to this forum
called ravelinks, and a trolling situation like this was common. Most of the
time the culprit was just a naive kid, rather than a malignant troll.

Hello again friends. Thought I would share my Saturday night report, live
and direct from East Berlin. Osby isn't the only one who can share stories
of Saturday night debauchery here...

On Saturday, I met up with some friends at my friend Martin's record shop i=
n
Friedrichshain. We drank champagne and listened to some records
before walking down Revalerstra=DFe to a club called Rosi's.  This place is=
 so
typically Friedrichshain - A big, one-story brick building, placed off the
street, behind a wall, with a crumbling facade and an equally rough
interior. It seems to me that having a hole in the floor or in the wall is =
a
standard feature for clubs on the East side of town. There was a big patio
area outside, which I'm sure must be a blast in the Summer, when they have =
a
soundsystem set up out there. Tonight there was no soundsystem on the patio=
,
it was quite cold, but the outdoor grill was open and people were standing
in line to get themselves a bratwurst and a beer.

Inside, the place looked much like an oldschool Oakland warehouse space,
decked out with crazy projections everywhere and those trance-inducing LED
bricks that can light a room any color of the rainbow. Tall ceilings, brick
walls, cement floors, and lots of little secret hang out rooms behind beade=
d
curtains. At midnight, the place was still completely empty, as parties her=
e
don't really get going until after 2am.  I sat with my friends in some old
movie theater seats up against the wall. The music was typical Berlin techn=
o
early in the night - Minimal, touching on melodic, but still dark and
driving.

By 2am the place was packed, and we went to check out an acquaintance who
was DJing in the smaller room.  This room was totally reminiscent of the
Dungeon, having low ceilings with that yucky ceiling tile stuff that you
find in office buildings. The DJ was playing sparse, glitchy,
electro-influenced tech-house, which I was told is being called Fidget Hous=
e
these days. I've heard the term here and there, but didn't really know what
it was. Sort of a more techy offshoot of electro-house, from my perspective=
,
though I only heard this music once, so I am not an expert on the subject.

We weren't really that into the music, so we decided this:  If we heard
either RUOK, or Heater (that god-awful minimal track with the accordion in
it), we would leave. It was kind of a joke, kind of not. Talking about
these, my least favorite current minimal anthems, reminded me of my previou=
s
night out, at a club called Zur M=F6belfabrik, in Mitte. This place is anot=
her
typical East Berlin club - A former furniture factory, found below street
level, with lots of brick and cement, and of course the obligatory holes in
the wall. I told my friend about my surprise when I heard the DJ playing
Marc Houle's "Techno Vocals," a track I saw as a novelty record and didn't
really take seriously. (In case you're not familiar, the track is a parody
of the trend in minimal techno to make tracks with these really pitched-dow=
n
vocals in them. The refrain goes "Why are all the vocals pitched down so
low? This is the way we make techno!"  Yeah, funny. See here:
http://www.discogs.com/release/1075727)  I was genuinely surprised to hear =
a
DJ playing it at a real techno club, this record is such a piece of shit,
really. A shitty parody of some other shitty tracks, something that will
have little to no relevance a year from now.  So, just as I'm finishing
telling him this, the DJ starts to mix in the next record, and I hear "Why
are all the vocals pitched down so low, low, low?"  I totally jumped out of
my seat with surprise, laughing. It cracked me up. I couldn't help but
exclaim, "I can't believe he's playing this shit!!" Hilarious.

So, the verdict was that the music wasn't really doing it for us, so the tw=
o
of us that remained from our party walked out to grab a falafel and hit the
next club.  We walked through the outskirts of F'hain, in a quieter and mor=
e
industrial part of town. The first club we reached was closed, so we walked
on to the the Plan B club, which was also closed. It was about 5am, and I
was ready to go home, so it was ok with me. The two of us began to walk
towards Warschauerstra=DFe to catch a train home, when this guy comes up to=
 us
as asks if the party is around here. Neither of us knew what he was talking
about, but as we stopped walking and listened for a moment, we heard that
familiar sound coming from the next block: "wmmph-wmmph-wmmph-wmmph".  We
walked over to this run-down building covered in scaffolding.  It looked
abandoned and empty. A couple of street punks were sitting outside, smoking
cigarettes. The front door was unlocked, so we walked in. We went up severa=
l
flights of stairs, to the top floor, where much to my surprise, was this
amazing underground loft party. What luck! The place looked a lot like
Overworld in Oakland, for those of you who remember that space - an open,
dark, dirty loft. There were lots of TVs stuck up in the rafters, with live
visuals, and projections of circuit diagrams all over the walls. Hammocks
were strung up here and there, and there were lots of different chill areas
with benches, futons, chairs, etc. This was the first place I have ever see=
n
in Berlin with blacklights - it felt like home! I sat down on a park bench
with a beer in my hand and rested my feet on a broken wood box covered in
bottles. The coat check consisted of a row of nails on one of the rafters,
where a line of long black coats and scarves were hanging. At the bar they
were serving cheap German beer and afri-cola with jaegermeister. The way th=
e
place was set up, with all the projectors, TVs, netting, lighting,
soundsystem, and such, it appeared that this was a regular party spot, not
just a one-off thing.

I went over to the the dancefloor to check out what was happening, I had
heard a few people say that the "Ha-pa-na" was really going off, so I wante=
d
to find out what this was.  A Japanese guy was playing a live p.a. set of
stripped down, hard, heady, minimal techno. It was the real shit! Not any o=
f
this clubby minimal tech-house stuff, this was pure techno. Gorgeous.

The people here were peaceful, respectful, fun, and open, the way it should
be.  Berlin can be a little intimidating at first, because some parts of th=
e
club scene are very exclusive. I was shocked coming here for the first time
in 2002, when I had to be 'picked' to get into the first club I went to -
this was contrary to everything I knew about dance music events. We're all =
a
family, and everyone is welcome, right...?  We're united by music, dancing
together as one, aren't we...? Not always so.  So I was a little bummed out=
,
thinking Berlin wouldn't open its arms to a freaky hippie raver girl from
San Francisco. But, here, as in many cities, if you dig deep enough, you ca=
n
find the beating heart of the underground. Here at this loft party, I could
talk to anyone, everyone was kind, no fights, no drunken outbursts, no
creepy guys hitting on me, just a bunch of good people having fun and being
free.  Totally brought me back to my early days of raving. What a fantastic
party!

I left as the sun was coming up, and caught the train back to my flat,
watching the last stars burn out from the sky. What a great night!

That's all for now.  I hope all of you have a fantastic New Year's Eve!


Love Chelsea
reporting from Berlin, city of joyous techno and delicious falafel.

Is Communique still active? Communique 40 on that discogs link was

Thats a good question.

Haha... yeah.  Just to give him the benefit of the doubt;  I'll remind  
everyone that when *I* first started posting to the list, I knew so  
little, and asked so many damn stupid questions, and was an arrogant  
dot-commer who still thought there was nothing, including the rave  
scene, that I couldn't master with a couple of overnighters...

... that something like my second post here EVER, I accidently touched  
off a vinyl vs. digital format flamewar that got so big that Brian B  
got involved!  Whoopsie.

Now, I'm a jaded and overly-opinionated ass who probably does bring up  
the negative too often when I should be looking for the positive.  But  
for all the ass-hattery I've made of myself over the years, I've never  
been trolling; just sharing honest opinions in a sometimes tactless  
manner.


cya,
john

There very definitely *was* a SF techno sound.  Or more correctly, sounds.  
Kit Clayton, Twerk, Sutehk laid the foundation for a lot of what minimal 
eventually became.  Around the same time, San Jose's techno sound was 
driving dancefloors with a percussion driven, rarely distorted hybrid of 
what the Advent were doing but very much with their own sound and approach 
(namely in the approach to bassline and the often crazed past-latin amount 
of swing on the drum patterns)... and EBE (also from San Jose) was hitting 
massive critical and popular acclaim spearheading a new sound that blew up 
called tech house.  I had friends with releases on Mille Plateux and Force 
(landmark miminal labels), Planet Rhythm (*the* og swedish tech label), 
and Sonic Groove (NYC's original shack shaking dirty techno label).

I do however totally support that there is a MASSIVE disconnect between 
booking and talent in this town, and that even with releases on good 
labels, magazine coverage, and people in NYC, Chicago, Tokyo, Berlin, 
London, etc that love your shit from first listen, SF is and always has 
been a weird place for techno.

He's still living in LA, saw him at the DJ Bone show here a few months 
ago.  He's doing well.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  In the Fight Over Piracy, a Rare Stand for Privacy By ADAM LIPTAK


>From today's NY Times..

In the Fight Over Piracy, a Rare Stand for Privacy By ADAM LIPTAK

Published: December 31, 2007

The record industry got a surprise when it subpoenaed the University of
Oregon in September, asking it to identify 17 students who had made
available songs from Journey, the Cars, Dire Straits, Sting and Madonna =
on a
file-sharing network. The surprise was not that 20-year-olds listen to
Sting. It was that the university fought back.

Represented by the state's attorney general, Hardy Myers, the university
filed a blistering motion to quash the subpoena, accusing the industry =
of
misleading the judge, violating student privacy laws and engaging in
questionable investigative practices. Cary Sherman, the president of the
Recording Industry Association of America, said the industry had seen "a =
lot
of crazy stuff" filed in response to its lawsuits and subpoenas. "But =
coming
from the office of an attorney general of a state?" Mr. Sherman asked,
incredulous. "We found it really surprising and disappointing."

No one should shed tears for people who steal music and have to face the
consequences. But it is nonetheless heartening to see a university =
decline
to become the industry's police officer and instead to defend the =
privacy of
its students.

The recording industry may not be selling as much music these days, but =
it
has built a pretty impressive and innovative litigation subsidiary.

In the past four years, record companies have sued tens of thousands of
people for violating the copyright laws by sharing music on the =
Internet.=20
The people it sues tend to settle, paying the industry a few thousand
dollars rather than risking a potentially ruinous judgment by fighting =
in
court.

"People get pushed into settlements," said Fred von Lohmann, a lawyer =
with
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group. "The Oregon
attorney general is showing what a real fight among equals would look =
like."

In his filings, Mr. Myers claimed to be looking for a middle ground.

"Certainly it is appropriate for victims of copyright infringement to
lawfully pursue statutory remedies," Mr. Myers wrote last month. =
"However,
that pursuit must be tempered by basic notions of privacy and due =
process."

"The larger issue," Mr. Myers said, "is whether plaintiffs' =
investigative
and litigation strategies are appropriate."

Mr. Myers questioned the tactics of MediaSentry, an investigative =
company
hired by the recording industry. He said the company seemed to use data
mining techniques to obtain "private, confidential information unrelated =
to
copyright infringement." He added that it may have violated an Oregon
criminal law requiring investigators to be licensed.

A spokeswoman for MediaSentry said it collected only information that =
users
of peer-to-peer networks make available to anyone who cared to look. She =
had
no comment on the licensing law.

The record companies, in an apoplectic response in court, accused the
university of having "a political agenda." They said that it was =
protecting
people who had broken the law and that it was not entitled to raise =
privacy
and due process arguments on behalf of its students.

"Hundreds of universities and dozens of commercial Internet service
providers have responded to the exact same subpoenas," the record =
companies'

lawyers wrote.

James Gibson, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said Mr.
Myers's arguments had been raised in other cases and had met with little
success.=20
Still, Professor Gibson said, "it's significant that a public university =
and
its state apparatus is standing up to the R.I.A.A."

Mr. Sherman, of the recording industry association, predicted that Mr.
Myers's motion would fail and said the industry's litigation strategy =
had
worked well.

"The litigation program, as controversial as it is often written up to =
be,
has been very successful in transforming public awareness," Mr. Sherman
said. "Everybody used to think this was legal. Now everybody knows it's
illegal."

Indeed, the program seems to be expanding, and universities are being =
asked
to play an even bigger role. In February, the association started asking
universities to identify students suspected of file sharing and to pass
along "prelitigation letters" to them. The association says it has =
provided
some 4,000 such letters to more than 150 colleges and universities. The
letters offer the students what they call bargain settlements of about
$3,000 if they act fast, by punching in a credit card number at
www.p2plawsuits.com.

"The 'reduced' settlement amount, in other words, represents the record
companies' savings from cutting out the middleman - our justice system," =
the
Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a recent report.

The universities are under no legal obligation to pass the letters =
along,
but most do. Those that don't typically receive subpoenas like the one
issued to the University of Oregon.

At least one other public university in Oregon has cooperated with the
industry. In 2004, Portland State responded to a record industry =
subpoena by
blandly and efficiently providing the names, addresses, phone numbers =
and
goofy e-mail addresses of two roommates. The university said it could =
not
say which student's computer was involved, so it fingered both of them.

"We definitely felt betrayed," said Karen Conway, the mother of one of =
the
roommates. "They readily turned over private information without =
notifying
us. They placed responding to a legal subpoena far above a student's =
right
to privacy."

Though her daughter Delaney was blameless, the record companies' lawyers
demanded $4,500. It was, Ms. Conway said, "basically extortion," and the
family was forced to hire a lawyer. The case against Delaney Conway was
eventually dropped. Her roommate settled.

Mr. Sherman said the University of Oregon should disclose what it knew =
and
let the legal system sort out the rest. "It's no different than us
subpoenaing Verizon," he said.

But an institution of higher education has different aspirations and
obligations than an Internet service provider, which is why Portland =
State's
actions are so unsettling. The University of Oregon's efforts may be =
doomed,
but there is something bracing about them nonetheless.

All the university is saying, after all, is that the record industry =
must
make its case in court before the university will point a finger at one =
of
its own.

"This is the one with the accordion in it. It's being played at every party
you go to and it's causing a bit of a stink because accordions are not
exactly techno, are they? It's also got a man making monkey noises on it,
and it's really catchy, which means that now that everyone is playing it,
it's going to start annoying the shit out of people very, very soon. A bit
like 'Geht's Noch?' or 'Erotic Discourse' did. But to be fair, I promised I
wouldn't write this review until I'd heard 'Heater' out. Unfortunately, I
got my chance in Berlin, where the track had the awkward effect of making
all the white people in the room suddenly dance *whiter*. Club Weekend
turned into an old worlde barn dance, with woodcutters jigging with
milkmaids for six minutes. Hmm. Overall then, 'Heater' is a fun little
listen, but dancing to it makes you feel like an idiot." =96 Jeremy Armitag=
