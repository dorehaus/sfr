Sorry about yesterday ... and I have to make this quick.  I've been having 
Vice City moments again ... you know Tommy's thugs that show up at every 
property you buy?  

"Hey Mario."

"What's going on?"

"Those shoes are new!"

"I got those clothes you want."

"You better tell him, Mario."

"I never asked your sister out, man."

"What hardware have we got?"

... and it goes on and on.  

Have a nice Tuesday.

Al-Gore-ithm: The mathematical process of recieving less total votes and 
still win the presidential election.
                  The equations is illistrated here - (Less 
votes/presidential election = win)


The process involves dividing a satanic digit such as 9 by a more heavenly 
number such as 11, using their obscure symbiologies, instead of their absolute 
number value, to come up with illogical conclusions.
               i.e.   (9/11 = terrorism)

another expample ilistrated here:
                (endless weapon inspections/no weapons of mass destruction = 
war)

our favorite bush equation is 
                (unrelated, previously failed to pass RAVE bill/widely 
accepted, non-contraversial child abduction bill = Passed Bill)
     
and perhaps he tops it off with this one
               (heavily armed oriental communist dictatorship/"terrorist" 
bearing lands of the begining of man and the origin of language and mathematics = 
Axis of Evil)

          Are all of his well thought-out, history altering disicions an 
ingenius progression towards world peace?   Or has he subtley initiated a setting 
to the global narritive of WW3? You'll either thank him later or you won't 
live to complain!

Subject: REVIEW: Estuary (Monday Open Deck Weekly)

More of you really should have come out! For a Monday night, it was
pretty rockin'. A lot of people were there and all the time slots were
taken by 9!

The venue is AWESOME. FREE POOL tables (when you buy drinks/food), huge
dance floors, a really sweet enclosed outdoor patio, hella nice
employees, STRONG drinks, and plenty of tables and chairs! And I swear
I saw 3 decks up there, but maybe I'm just sleep dep'd.

Music-wise we heard everything from floofy house & trance, to old
classics (Groove is in the heart...), to mmm-DARK jungle & DnB, to
techno! Plus, the music changed quickly enough that I just didn't get
bored at all. I didn't get to stay and see Amber spin, but everyone
else that I heard was great (well, there was that one guy... *cringe*).

All you people that spin, but haven't had a chance to "play out" or
find a gig anywhere, COME TO ESTUARY! All of you that don't spin, come
and hang out... fun people, great drinks, funky music... DELISH!!

Special headliners every week at 1am. Open decks from 9-1, in half hour
slots. C'mon... you know you wanna go...

THANK YOU HAPPY/DEVIL!!
*hugs*
Jessica

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

if you have a cool boss, your always going to shine, and sometimes, you might even look forward to going to work even, and sometimes, you might not even feel like you are "working", so to speak, because all you feel is pleasure, and what's work if you aren't totally suffering all of the time, right? well, you do have to sleep and eat and care for yourself, but just the same, if you are one of those sane varieties who doesn't have a peculiarity for relapse or anything like that, you might actually enjoy your business endeavors with the kind of boss who knows what you like and gives it to you! free advice rules, doesn't it? i wish i could excel at nagging or something like that too, because then, i'd be a part of yet another community and all i could ever want is to totally belong and gee i sure wish everyone would like me and then we could all be friends until we die. j/k. :)

We don't even know Geri is a "she":

"...also, i read in playboy (of course, my favorite bedtime read) that there 
is a place for gentlemen like myself to order a drink that runs a little
more than $12,000 dollars that has a one carat diamond ring in there for my

Articles like this raise awareness in an effort from letting the gov't try 
to get away with what ever they want. Regardless of if they have a 
constructional basis for it. Wouldn't be the first time there was a law

Yeah thought mystic wrote the paranoid comment.
But also, there is a quote, forget who said it,  "Just because I'm 
paranoid, doesn't mean they aren't out to get me"

wait till status quo has negative effects their lives, then they people 
will have a different look on life.   I mean it used to be status quo that 
women couldn't vote, own property, let alone it used to be status quo to 
have slaves. now we live in a culture that thinks that is absurd.

only if you are afraid like a little sissy to touch your vinyl.

vinyl is meant to be touched, loved, interacted with. (IMO)

TOUCH your vinyl!

there are those who just do the rapid "up down" adjustments very common in the UK. dnb / jungle
scene.
there are those who hold down the 33 and the 45 buttons (if it's a 33 record) to briefly "nudge" the
record fwd.

but seriously-it's a turntable.  its vinyl!  touch it, your music, while you can
before all we have left is final scratch pro 18.2, cdj 987234, and the Rane mp23987 which
automatically mixes for you.

;)

My $.02!

Geoff

(PS to qualify for "professional" mixing would not involve how you beatmatch your records for me,
but that you do it consistently, on demand, perfectly-then you can at least think of your
beatmatching
(which says nothing about your track selection or other dj presence) as "professional")

;)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] dj'ing question

This is great advice for House. 

But what if she is playing something over 130 BPM?

In the time it takes to correct the record with pitch control, people
are already leaving the dancefloor. 

Why do you think there are so many House dj's? Prob because the beat is
so slow a monkey could mix the records and could prob learn to do it
with the pitch too. 

Try correcting with the pitch while playing some DnB or some 150+ hard
trance or even some hard techno or acid. Good luck, hope you aren't
recording because you will end up scrappin that mix. 

You are going to need to find faster ways to correct the record before
you trigger an elephant stampede. And using the pitch is not considered
a fast way.

  Well, I respectfully disagree, no big deal. You have
your oppinion and I have mine. 
 
Not all house is that slow though , try listening to
people like Terry Francis or Eddie Richards, they play
around 134 or 135. I think the slowest sets I've heard
from them are about 132.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj'ing question

Have to agree with Kevin here, the best way to smoothly mix is to ride the
pitch control, no matter what the genre.  I play house the same way I play
trance or jungle or hardcore, by riding the pitch and keeping hands off the
record.  Once you master the pitch control you can have a track matched up
and mixing within eight or so beats, and the adjustments you make can be
much more precise.  The crowd won't hear the adjustments, and the tracks
will stay together longer with less overall adjustment.  Watch any master
mixer play and you will see them riding the pitch.

I think so many DJs play house because it is the most mainstream acceptable
form of dance music right now, especially alla remix bootleg heaven, not
because it's the easiest to mix.  I find jungle and breaks much more
forgiving to mix, you can slip a little and still have it sound relatively
good.  Since house is slower and the beat is straight, it's a lot more
obvious when you slip the smallest bit.  A lot of crowds that listen to
house right now could give a fuck about mixing anyway, but that's another
thread altogether.  Besides, once you can mix one genre really well,
anything else should be cake because it's the same technique no matter what
you're playing.

Not trying to split hairs or anything.. but I've never heard a house
tune that was that high in bpm.  Besides, terry francis is a tech-house
dj.  Tech house is a small genre that helps further fracture the
American scene.

  Well, I respectfully disagree, no big deal. You have
your oppinion and I have mine. 
 
Not all house is that slow though , try listening to
people like Terry Francis or Eddie Richards, they play
around 134 or 135. I think the slowest sets I've heard
from them are about 132.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] dj'ing question

Hey all,

I've been a lurker on this board for a week now but I just can't keep quiet when it
comes to mixing!  Personally, I like to use the slider for rough beat matching and
then spin the record or "tweak the nipple" as you guys said, for fine tuning. 
Overall, I prefer to use the slider for mixing for one main reason - it's
reproducible.  At a given BPM, you can set the slider and depending on how quickly
the beats go out of sync, you know if you're fast or slow and by how much.  Now, I
don't claim to have it mastered to the point where I can do that and say "yup, I'm
1.5BPM too fast", but I know it can be done.  The biggest name DJ I've had the
pleasure of watching up close was Derrick Carter.  I was right next to the tables
and the man was amazing.  He mixed strictly with the slider and could have songs
matched as quickly as 4 bars, with an average of 6-8 bars.  I've never spun jungle
so I can't speak for fast BPM music.

Subject: [sfraves] [Fwd] REVIEW: Estuary

[Fwd'd for Greg since his email is messed up. -Jessica]

>From GregVP:
-------------
NOTE: My review was a reply to an original SFraves message from Jessica
McMahan, including her review. 
************************************************************************
Hell yeah! It was a great time. I danced my ass off after having 2
stiff
long island teas (the drink special). It was also good to see
everybody.
Finally met SE/30 (dave), a cool guy who likes to play pool but doesn't
do
much dancing. He was responsible for the networked Macintosh computers
at
the F&F party (the hardware was still in his trunk!) Most of the guys
that I
meet are always hungry. SE/30 was ready for In and Out burger by the
time we
shut down that place!

Of course Dave Parlier from the old Acme crew (Ascension) was there and
he
gave me the hugest bear hug I have ever experienced. How refreshing to
be
around guys that are not so uptight like the boring guys at work. I
love the
rave scene.

Most of the girls that I meet are sweet, pretty, and not very hungry.
(or at
least food is not the first thing they mention). Becca was sporting a
beautiful Opal necklace from a relative. I got another hug in return
for a
warm compliment.

Amber is refreshingly cute to me. It was great to hear her spin again.
Talk
about a dancer's delight. I had the whole floor to myself.

Mikah was the shutterbug with his digital camera. I said, "I bet we
look
pretty silly", and he said "no way, dude" but I didn't see the shots.
Maybe
I'm too self-conscious about pictures.

I thought that the door dude (bouncer) was a bit strange but maybe
that's
because they aren't used to working on Mondays. When I walked in he ran
after me to check ID. No big deal but thereafter he kept lurking around
and
doing things like reminding you not to take your drink on the dance
flooor.
Don't worry, he "chilled out" as the evening progressed. And the
bartender
(Gil) was really nice and he poured stiff drinks.

At around 12:30 a Pleasanton police officer showed up to chat with the
door
dude (he came inside the club to check things out). I guess they like
to be
safe around the suburban shopping mall. It was funny to me because I
heard
the policeman say, "Loud" (referring to the music) and it reminded me
that
some people are sticks-in-the-mud (not open-minded about new music). He
kept
looking at me so I just smiled politely. Cops make me nervous because I
was
busted once and it sucks. But the good thing about this venue is it is
not
close to a residential neighborhood. Dave even commented that we could
have
ambient music on the outside patio.

It seems to me that for a Monday night many girls showed up compared to
other places. Not much to do in the area, I bet (Dublin/Pleasanton/San
Ramon). I noticed one or two girls kept looking at me, maybe because I
was
dancing so much. I decided to quit being shy, and I talked to a girl
with a
cast. I asked her what happened and then I said, "you are probably
tired of
hearing that one." Turns out that somehow she actually HIT the bar in
this
place. How do you break your arm doing that? Maybe she was in a fight
with
someone. I didn't ask.

It was a lot of fun. I like going out on off-days during the week
because
you have more room to dance. And, it is easier to meet people. You guys
on
sfraves should check it out if you are bored on a Monday night (and
gals,
too).

Finally, I would like to borrow a phrase from Aaron W (technolounge) on
this
list:
Energy cannot be destroyed, only transmitted.

I felt so much positive energy flowing from "Estuary" last night.  This
weekly could become another gathering like Ascension, a place where old
friends unite and new people feel comfortable. Check it out. At least
it's
not in a basement, like Blake's had in Berkeley (Man, that place got
HOT).

In Pleasanton there is a breeze on the outside patio when you get hot.

Greg VP

I've heard some olav basoski (sp?) sets up around 140, Same with Donald Glaude....and ummmmm Bad Boy Bill, I've heard hard house (not that lame UK crap, but real chicago hard house) played up to 160 or so....just cause ya play house doesnt mean you're locked into the 120-135bpm range....

And my opinion in the pitch adjusment is the same as andrew's, it doesnt matter the genre of your tracks when adjusting with the pitch it's just all about skill and mastering the pitch technique.  I admit i'm still struggling, i used to be a table toucher, and i've realised that you can hear it and it does suck.  I'll catch my hand going for the platter and i just remind myself to fix it with the pitch and when i do, it seems to work out a lot better, more control over how much is sped up and slowed down.  You know how sometimes you have records that are slightly warped and when you touch the platter or the record they tend to speed up or slow down more than a normal records, but using the pitch doesnt cause that problem.

Not trying to split hairs or anything.. but I've never heard a house
tune that was that high in bpm.  Besides, terry francis is a tech-house
dj.  Tech house is a small genre that helps further fracture the
American scene.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj'ing question

I think telling someone how to mix, is like telling them what records to
play. It is none of your business; Everyone has their own style and how to
melt to sounds together. If you can achieve the same affect by spinning
upside down, or in a pressure-tank, is that bad? Isn't Dj'ing about
self-expression as well?

I think it is great to know how to mix using all the tools. Then when it
comes time, you can use the right tool for the job. I wont go into my
personal style, 'cause the world needs another Jack Triumph, like it needs a
whole in the head. Be you.

The only advice I will give is that if you are nervous and playing at a gig,
don't touch the vinyl....you'll be a 100 times more likely to jump the
record. Other than that, it's your kitchen, make something good.

Personally, I use a lot of pitch slider, a lot of directly manipulating 
the platter, and a little nipple tweaking.

Honestly, is there a right or wrong way???  The end result is what 
matters, and your technique can only be dictated by your own comfort 
and manual dexterity. I remember 2 distinctly different occasions where 
other, much more experienced DJs have watched me and said both, "Don't 
be afraid of the vinyl, man," and "Holy fuck, you touch your wax a lot!"

"All the top DJ's only use the slider" - yeah, and Ford Escort was the 
best-selling small car for decades and 99.9999% of major corporations 
run Windows ;) What's the point? If majority ruled, we wouldn't have... 
oh, I won't touch THAT one!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] dj'ing question

hahah.. seems like a funny opinion to me since Terry Francis isn't american, 
and Tech-House seems anything but small.. Tech-house to me, and it may just 
be me, just describes house that's anti-progressive..

When it comes to riding the pitch.. well, I'm a little of both kinda guy.. 
if my record is going off slightly, I can use the pitch to correct it, if 
it's really off, I'll touch the record.. I'm not afraid of it.. the talent 
(to me) lies in being able to touch that record without anyone hearing 
anything..

Personally, mixing to me altogether is of less importance than quality of 
music. I think any monkey can learn to mix records.. (Look at all the 
monkeys mixing these days) it's a learned skill, you're not born with it. An 
ear for quality music might not necessarily be an aquired thing tho. I've 
heard incredible sets from world reknown djs who hardly beatmatched at all, 
but played an array of music that I felt honored to hear. You could tell the 
set was hand picked and well felt and thought out.

What's easier to mix? to me, I like breaks and jungle and find it the 
easiest to mix. I think it's a bit more forgiving when it comes to being off 
and/or quick mixing. I find faster bpms easier to mix than slower bpms in 
general. The faster the track the easier it is to get in and out quickly.. 
That's just for me tho.. I'm sure it's all subjective.

Tech-house *is* house. And what do you know about the "fractured" house
scene? American producers and DJ's have long embraced tech-house, and
have helped define the sound. Detroit has become a source of some
ground-breaking sounds as techno artists have applied their
sensibilities to the structure of house. From SF to New York, and in
unlikely places such as Texas to Florida, American producers are
breathing new life into the *global* scene by injecting new ideas, and
fusing disparate genres with house music.

IMHO, tech-house is one of the only things keeping house fresh these
days. It's hardly a "small genre", either -- there's far more of it out
there than you're probably aware of. Actually, I'd argue that it really
isn't a genre at all, but an extension -- even an evolution -- of house
music... it's part of the world-wise realization that house doesn't
necessarily have to employ disco stabs or cheesy female vocals.

And this talk of BPM is rediculous, BTW. There's plenty of house in the
130's, and there's some stuff labeled as house that plays at r&b speeds.
Some Londoners (including Terry Francis) pitch their house way up, just
as some American DJ's are known to play really deep stuff very slowly.
And furthermore, I'm certain that Mr. Francis would take issue with your
statement that he is a "tech-house dj". FYI, he's been known to play a
wide variety of stuff, from traditional house, to breaks, progressive
stuff, and all sorts of techno.

No DJ worth his/her salt should label themselves as a DJ of a particular
genre, or even worse, a sub-genre. Limiting yourself to certain styles
is just silly when there's so much good music out there. And trying to
pigeonhole other DJ's as peddlers of a specific sound is not doing them
justice.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj'ing question

one thing to keep in mind is that some vinyl moves more easily on the
platter then others, so you may need to apply more/less pressure for certain
records you have...

a more solid way to do this, if you dont like using the pitch slider, is to
use the actual platter, not only for slowing down the record, but also for
speeding the record up.

also, i have noticed that, in general, when people touch the vinyl they
normally touch it pretty close to the nipple, which is not as precise as if
you were touching it on the platter (which is much further from the center
of the circle i.e. nipple). for example, your hand will travel more distance
by touching the platter rather than using the vinyl near the nipple (both
are equal in the amount the record moves, but the distance your hand travels
is not the same); this gives you more control and it is also less noticeable
for the untrained ear.

i hope that makes sense...

i'm with you on this.

i'm reminded of this kid who played the trumpet really well, but
held it "wrong" and had it at at "wrong" angle at his mouth. 
every music teacher he had tried to correct him, but he couldn't
play as well unless he was doing it "wrong".  he got accepted to
participate in this seminar run by a world famous instructor, who
instantly noticed he was holding it funny.  he said he just played
it better that way, so she asked him to demonstrate and said it
"sounds fine to me and that's all that matters in music".  i think
that no matter what you're doing, you just have to practice a lot
and find a place that's comfortable for you.  you know, try out as
many things as you can until you find what feels right.

just my two cents.

I like the (pardon the technical term) little bumpity-bumps around the 
platter - they're very tactile, you don't bump the vinyl itself (less 
potential for a skip, harsh speed change), and for slowing stuff down, 
you can control it to various degrees with the slightest amount of 
pressure from a fingertip. 'Course, when doing this, you have to be 
mindful of whether you're at 33 or 45 RPM, how much resistance in 
general the turntable has (I've noticed older 1200's can be a lot 
"looser"), how sweaty your fingers may be, etc.

For these reasons, the pitch slider IS more consistent, and I'm not 
going to disagree with those who say it's a safer means of speed 
adjustment. However, I really really really enjoy the variable, 
touchy-feely aspect of directly touching the moving parts, and a big 
reason I enjoy spinning is my own physical interaction with the music.

Personally, I use a lot of pitch slider, a lot of directly manipulating
the platter, and a little nipple tweaking.

Honestly, is there a right or wrong way???  The end result is what
matters, and your technique can only be dictated by your own comfort
and manual dexterity. I remember 2 distinctly different occasions where
other, much more experienced DJs have watched me and said both, "Don't
be afraid of the vinyl, man," and "Holy fuck, you touch your wax a lot!"

"All the top DJ's only use the slider" - yeah, and Ford Escort was the
best-selling small car for decades and 99.9999% of major corporations
run Windows ;) What's the point? If majority ruled, we wouldn't have...
oh, I won't touch THAT one!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] dj'ing question

Let me clarify my point about the fractured scene in America (I know
Terry is British btw).  My experience when I lived in germany was that
germans have our a handful of styles they play in the big clubs.
Whereas, here in America, there are waaaayyy too many styles to get a
large crowd together consistently.  Couple that with the fact that the
majority of clubs (that I've been to) only have one dj spinning techno
so it limits the appeal to a broad audience.  I believe 1015 has
multiple dance floors with multiple djs but that isn't as common as it
should be.  I was at a club in berlin that had at least 9 separate dance
rooms AND at least 15,000 people in it.  Yes, 15,000 dancers and ravers.
It was amazing to see.

Most people in the audience wouldn't know you had a train wreck anyway
so I agree with your point that music selection is most important.  You
should be trying to impress the dancers in the club not the djs.

be me, just describes house that's anti-progressive..

When it comes to riding the pitch.. well, I'm a little of both kinda
guy.. 
if my record is going off slightly, I can use the pitch to correct it,
if 
it's really off, I'll touch the record.. I'm not afraid of it.. the
talent 
(to me) lies in being able to touch that record without anyone hearing 
anything..

Personally, mixing to me altogether is of less importance than quality
of 
music. I think any monkey can learn to mix records.. (Look at all the 
monkeys mixing these days) it's a learned skill, you're not born with
it. An 
ear for quality music might not necessarily be an aquired thing tho.
I've 
heard incredible sets from world reknown djs who hardly beatmatched at
all, 
but played an array of music that I felt honored to hear. You could tell
the 
set was hand picked and well felt and thought out.

What's easier to mix? to me, I like breaks and jungle and find it the 
easiest to mix. I think it's a bit more forgiving when it comes to being
off 
and/or quick mixing. I find faster bpms easier to mix than slower bpms
in 
general. The faster the track the easier it is to get in and out
quickly.. 
That's just for me tho.. I'm sure it's all subjective.

Is it just me, or is it just a bit disturbing/annoying/irritating that 
lately, there've been BSPs for commercial massives without a single 
mention of what acts will be appearing?  And the fact that they're on 
pre-sale before there's any word on the talent?

I know that a lot of events are built on a reputation for consistently 
having big-name acts and lots of areas with something for everyone, but 
still... at least list ONE of the headliners if you're going to be 
asking for the loot right away.  This isn't some European festival or 
Burning Man where you know it's going to kick ass regardless, after all

Subject: RE: [sfraves] dj'ing question

Thanks for clearing that up shawn.  Btw, if terry takes issue with me
labeling him then he should give back his award he received for being
the best tech-house dj last year.  For your information, my definition
of house is probably dated since I don't listen to it much, house in
germany is different from the states/uk, and the last time I really
listened to house techno hadn't been invented yet.  And I never said in
know anything about a "fractured house scene".

As for it being a small group, small is a relative term.  By small, I
mean in relation to the more established groups of trance and
progressive trance.  Do a search for one of terry's mixed sets and then
try to find any of his songs on kazaa or whatever file share proggy you
use.  I bet you won't get a single hit.  In fact, I've never even heard
of the names that are on his cd.  So I would have to conclude that it is
a small genre.  Just my opinion.

Tech-house *is* house. And what do you know about the "fractured" house
scene? American producers and DJ's have long embraced tech-house, and
have helped define the sound. Detroit has become a source of some
ground-breaking sounds as techno artists have applied their
sensibilities to the structure of house. From SF to New York, and in
unlikely places such as Texas to Florida, American producers are
breathing new life into the *global* scene by injecting new ideas, and
fusing disparate genres with house music.

IMHO, tech-house is one of the only things keeping house fresh these
days. It's hardly a "small genre", either -- there's far more of it out
there than you're probably aware of. Actually, I'd argue that it really
isn't a genre at all, but an extension -- even an evolution -- of house
music... it's part of the world-wise realization that house doesn't
necessarily have to employ disco stabs or cheesy female vocals.

And this talk of BPM is rediculous, BTW. There's plenty of house in the
130's, and there's some stuff labeled as house that plays at r&b speeds.
Some Londoners (including Terry Francis) pitch their house way up, just
as some American DJ's are known to play really deep stuff very slowly.
And furthermore, I'm certain that Mr. Francis would take issue with your
statement that he is a "tech-house dj". FYI, he's been known to play a
wide variety of stuff, from traditional house, to breaks, progressive
stuff, and all sorts of techno.

No DJ worth his/her salt should label themselves as a DJ of a particular
genre, or even worse, a sub-genre. Limiting yourself to certain styles
is just silly when there's so much good music out there. And trying to
pigeonhole other DJ's as peddlers of a specific sound is not doing them
justice.

Cheers,

i'm with you on this.

i'm reminded of this kid who played the trumpet really well, but
held it "wrong" and had it at at "wrong" angle at his mouth.
every music teacher he had tried to correct him, but he couldn't
play as well unless he was doing it "wrong".  he got accepted to
participate in this seminar run by a world famous instructor, who
instantly noticed he was holding it funny.  he said he just played
it better that way, so she asked him to demonstrate and said it
"sounds fine to me and that's all that matters in music".  i think
that no matter what you're doing, you just have to practice a lot
and find a place that's comfortable for you.  you know, try out as
many things as you can until you find what feels right.

just my two cents.

Due to Cyberfest's and other massive's in the bay in recent years, it's
my guess is that Biden will be there paper in hand to the owners of the
Cow Palace pointing out what might happen if they continue with the
party.  Not to hate on Cyberfest or Coolworld although many people like
to, I've never gotten the good underground vibe there but I have had fun
regardless.  I just feel its going to be the summer of love Ashcroft

But to Coolworld, yeah, whats up with not even a teaser headliner?  Its

No, it's not just you.  I can count on one hand the promoters whose tickets I
would buy on their name alone; without having details on the actual lineup,
venue, and so forth.  And not one of the commercial, out of town, corporate,
massive promoters is on that list.

Of course, that's not the real question.  The real question is: "Is coolworld
actually planning to BOOK all the talent they're going to put on their flyers
this time around?".  Or are several of the headliners going to "miss their
flights" or "get kicked off the lineup" again?

Well duh...

One one hand there is some dope tech house out there... but like most
genres, a lot of it is crap, and bad tech house drives me nuts.
Especially when it fails both as house (not funky or soulful enough) and
as techno (not passionate or creative enough in the sound design
department).

It's awesome music to link different vibes, but few people spin whole sets
of what I'd consider tech house in a way I find compelling.  My faves in
the genre tend to be DJs like Guthrie and Chad Minddrive... who mix mostly
tech house with slow funky techno and some choice older midwest-flavored
house cuts.

let's go back to the good 'ole days, when commenting positively on a publically posted page layout could get a person cursed out for months at a time while simultaneously instilling fear into the heads of many followers looking for something to attach the chemical inbalance from the previous weekend's drinking/smoking/popping/family problems/no lover binge to. oh yeah, also included in the response to the single positive comment on the, uh, work: let's have a love triangle ensue too. yeah, bring in the love triangle theory even though the most important party wasn't even there. :)

Ah yes, my favorite subject to flip out on...  :)

HAHAHAHAHA.

Why the fuck is the dance music side of this town a bunch of Jeno
clones?

Can I smooth mix?  Yes!  I can, really.  I can put a record down and get
it in, and then go back and check it again, and by the time I throw it in
for cue, I don't have to touch it anymore.  Sometimes I can even throw in
and not have to touch the record again (esp if I'm playing house or
simpler techno in a close bpm range).

But if I'm playing hip hop, or ghetto tech, or bustin a record every 45
seconds with some frantic techno, it's a very good idea to touch the
vinyl.  Let the music and the situation decide... if the music has gaps in
it, and lacks any sort of whine or tone between the beats, you're actually
going to fix cleaner and faster by bumping the vinyl/platter than by using
the pitch.  Really.  Meanwhile, if the record has long sustaining tones of
mid to high frequency, any contact with the record will be noticeable...
hell even pitch slider changes are noticiable in some cases.  Ideally,
once the volume is up on that record, you shouldn't be fixing at all...

Suffice to say as notebooks and "virtual djing" start showing up as an
acceptable means of mixing for people, smooth mixing as this technical
marvel is going to die.  That can be easily done by a computer with 4/4
beats (Native Instruments Traktor DJ software can beatmatch and phrase
your mixes already if they're even remotely 'DJ friendly' tracks).  The
realm of the vinyl DJ will open up to a more skills oriented situation,
where crazier and more technically difficult shit is rewarded as both
crowds and other djs want to see what the masters have up their sleeve
next.  You can alrteady see this happening in cities that are well steeped
in DJ Culture... in Detroit for example, DJs like Gary Chandler, Godfather
and Assault are revered on account of a combination of superbroad
selection (hip hop, jungle, house, tech, electro, whatever), sick mixing
abilities, and unreal tricks (doubles, scratching, 2/1 or 1/2 bpm jumps,
etc).

If you are a DJ, learn to beatmatch, cause that's the glue that makes all
other things work... but learn to use the stop button, learn to backspin,
learn to just stop a record cold and punch the other one in on beat,learn
to mix into a record that can't be beatmatched into, learn to use a break
from the middle of a record, learn to play with loops and tools, learn to
beat juggle and freeze and stutter and scratch and don't let anybody tell
you it's all about this one little thing cause I KNOW it's not.  Stress
yourself, it's the only way to force growth!

For over ten years now, the bay area has been host to two scenes.  On one
hand, we've had the most innovative turntablists in the world... on the
other we have a cleanmixing culture (well and then there's the thomas
trouble/mars/mystere thing that i fail to understand to this day but I
don't like clowns either).  Why can't they see each other, and meet in the
middle?

-&e->I think so many DJs play house because it is the most mainstream acceptable
-&e->form of dance music right now, especially alla remix bootleg heaven, not

Argh!  If you wanna drop an 80s track, drop the original version.  Most of
those 80s rehacks are fucking trash, and many of the originals have way
superior production and are entirely beatmatchable thanks to click tracks
and drum machines becoming common place in the 80s... hell, at Delve a few
weeks ago I dropped PYT by Michael Jackson right off the Thriller LP smack
on top of an old Chicago house tune and you better believe the place went
*boing*.

-&e->because it's the easiest to mix.  I find jungle and breaks much more
-&e->forgiving to mix, you can slip a little and still have it sound relatively
-&e->good.  Since house is slower and the beat is straight, it's a lot more
-&e->obvious when you slip the smallest bit.  A lot of crowds that listen to
-&e->house right now could give a fuck about mixing anyway, but that's another
-&e->thread altogether.  Besides, once you can mix one genre really well,
-&e->anything else should be cake because it's the same technique no matter what
-&e->you're playing.

See above.  I can see your point within a certain style of club/dance
DJing, but I see a way brighter future in a world where that culture mixes
with turntablism and artistic bravery.

Smash genres, smash conventions, and maybe, just maybe you'll get noticed
for doing something different in this town.  Send dancers home with your
ideas in their heads... transcend what a fistful of producers have put on
vinyl and force a higher agenda.  Understand what a groove is and how to
set it up, but also understand that if that's the only goal of the DJ
before you, the DJ after you, and the DJ everybody heard last week...
you're just a signpost on a dark back road and you're not bringing
anything new to the lives of the people you claim to play for.

The notion of playing this year's popular utility dance music in a dark
corner somewhere is akin to muzak in an elevator... like resigning to the
death of creativity, and I refuse to admit that.  Music is alive, and
DJing is collage.  Take the old words and old images you find and say new
things with them.

if coolworld does not book bipole for cyberfest...someone should throw a 
party the same night and book bipole.

that way all the cool kids who want to listen to original, innovative 
material have someplace to go....and mike migurski will have an excuse to 
not go to cyberfest like he did last year.

unless dj skribble is headlining cyberfest again.  cuz then i'm there for

Somebody earlier had said 40-50.  Personally, I'm not going undercover.

No, I'm going to put on a police uniform, flash a badge, and confiscate 
all kinds of drugs from the kiddies.

Then I'll go hide in a port-a-potty and do 'em all myself. I'll be the 
one sweating and freaking out in the middle of the dancefloor, twirling 
my nightstick as if it were glowing.

You know, I don't have a problem with undercover cops or DEA agents
being at Cyberfest.

its a big, well promoted event.  The DEA says they don't want to shut
down ligitment dance parties, they just want to stop the drugs.  Ravers
say its all about the music and vibe, not the drugs.  So its time BOTH of them
put their money where their mouths are.

its obvious that kids can't handle themselves at these parties... 2 kids
died at the last big Cow Palace event.

So spread the word!  make Cyberfest drug-free.  Kids get their party,
and the DEA sanctions it.  Win-win.

I don't think drugs belong at such a above-ground event like Cyberfest 
anyway.  It only leads to more high-profile ODs that give the anti-party
crusaders more ammunition to shut us down.

you should show up with a few pockets full of Excederine, the ones with the

i am trying to track down a flyer or some info or anything, really, on the

called "the gathering."  it was in '96, i think, in a big warehouse in
oakland.  alex patterson was there.  the little paper squares had alien
heads on 'em.  everyone was lying on the floor.  'twas a good time.  is
there an online collection of such things?  anyone keep this stuff around?

I think what troy said is actually pretty valid. There are pros and cons to everything in life. I think it's important to ensure the integrity of the event and the safety of our patrons.
 
Cyberfest has been around for over a decade and every year we face new challenges, etc. This years promises to be one of the most eclectic diverse line up's we have produced in quit some time.
 
The line up will be released this weekend and i'm sure many of you old and new Cyberfest attendees will appreciate it.
 
Also, we have just released a small limited number of $25 tickets that are now available in all your usual indy stores/outlets here in the bay area. 
 
You can also purchase a limited amount of tickets @ the Cow Palace box office with NO service charge. After this weekend the ticket price will increase slighty...
 
Coolworld

You know, I don't have a problem with undercover cops or DEA agents
being at Cyberfest.

its a big, well promoted event. The DEA says they don't want to shut
down ligitment dance parties, they just want to stop the drugs. Ravers
say its all about the music and vibe, not the drugs. So its time BOTH of them
put their money where their mouths are.

its obvious that kids can't handle themselves at these parties... 2 kids
died at the last big Cow Palace event.

So spread the word! make Cyberfest drug-free. Kids get their party,
and the DEA sanctions it. Win-win.

I don't think drugs belong at such a above-ground event like Cyberfest 
anyway. It only leads to more high-profile ODs that give the anti-party
crusaders more ammunition to shut us down.

I agree.   In the late eighties and early nineties most DJs mixed wildly 
eclectic sets, and I believe the dancers loved the spontaneous serendipity 
of it all.  I used to throw down house, industrial, punk, and new wave in 
the same set.  Much fun.

Fun.  Yes.  I think what drives many people to DJ, including myself, is the 
need to share music that rocks their souls with other people.  If that is 
the motive, the rest will come.  Above all it is important to have fun 
spinning -- selecting tracks you love; playing with them at home;  and then 
sharing your beats with friends.

As for genres, there were none at the beginning and I think we are entering 
a time when the musical paradigms erected during the last decade are 
breaking down.  Exciting.  There are no "rules."  House, whatever that is 
these days, is evolving with everything else.

Love,

Apollo

The only correct way to beatmatch is to hit the turntable repeatedly until the needle just falls in place. then you can correct it if it slips out by gently licking the record (only lick it the area of the runout groove. don't want spit in the beats, and 9 out of ten records have lsd on the label). any other method is useless. this is the only way!!!!

Hee hee hee, I have had no web connection for a week and I'm back and I read something funny about bringing your bible to cyberfest! FYI the DEMF was started by a born again christian who claimed she was called by God to start an Electronic music Festival in Detroit. I am not making this up. So bringing a bible to a rave would not be wholly inapropriate.

Last weekend, I voulenteered to help out with decor for the Somarts Benifit, but for some reason didnt get the email until it was too late and was already invited to do an instalation at burning sol, I was honored to be asked so I went crazy and buit this bird but it got out of hand and I wore myself out and by the time the party started i was too exhausted to enjoy it and I ended up napping in my car! The bird ended up looking crappy cause I rushed it anyway.

Subject: [sfraves] ROOM AVAILABLE @ A HOUSE IN OAKLAND ($400 pm+utilities) 

   Seemz like we have a r/m who makes good money but would rather spend
it being a sugar daddy to the young females than pay the rent on time, so
it looks like he has to go. The way it looks now, there will be a room
available by August 1st.
  Here's whatz up. It's 400 a month plus utilities (averages about
$40-70). You would be required to pay first & last month's rent including
a $150 refundable (if you don't trash your room) deposit to move in, were
not gender specific, but you must be financially/maturely stable and able
to pay your bills on time, able to comprehend the word "moderation" in
every thing, able to clean up after your self, is tolerant and able to
get along with others (therez 2 punk rock girls, tekno me and new r/m)
and likes dogs too. We have 3.
  The house is really nice and roomy with a nice size back yard, located
right next to China Town and over the hill from Lake Merit. The
neighborhood on a whole is well kept, little crime, and usually quiet
except for Asian kids setting off fire works during holidays and a
neighbor occasionally doing his own side show trying to impress his
younger cousins. Oakland has a wild energy to it, but no more violent
than SF or SJ. I've walked the streets at night with no problems. If you
understand Oakland's MO, it's a hella great place to live. The hills are
just a 30-45 minute walk away.
  More details... you can e-mail my r/m Chelsea at
safedogsbythebay@hotmail or call her @ (510) 534-7225. (don't call after
12am) or hit me back.
  Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [Fwd] REVIEW: Estuary

    I'd like to thank everyone who came out for the first night of Estuary.
The vibe was everything that I had hoped for, and I was happy to see so many
people having such a great time! There was a good mix of people from the old
Ascension crowd, as well as a bunch of new people. We got to hear a good mix
of music from djs of varying talent and experience, and transitions from
slot to slot were practically flawless. Amber tied the whole night together
with her postive energy and passion for her music. I stood there watching
her mix and saw so many things that I had never thought to do! I think that
people were afraid to get too close and trainspot, but after all, this night
is all about new experiences and learning new things, so don't be afraid to
watch!
    Here is the playlist from June 30th:

Happy    (Jungle)
Gavin Wright    (Prog House/Trance)
Summer K    (Breaks)
Phaedrus    (Jungle)
M!kah    (Jungle)
Devil    (Jungle)
DJ Jacob B    (Hard House)
Jagged Mettal O    (Techno)
Amber    (Sick Sickness of the Sickest Kind)

    I look forward to seeing you next week, July 7th, Special Guest to be
announced.


Happy  :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] I'm Baaack! Jesus and the DEMF

 If I was a rabid fundamentalist/Pentecostal, I would call it looking for
a scriptural loop hole to have fun (sin), but for Jesus! I remember way
back in the late 80's when we had a "Christian" punk rock club, playing
"Christian" punk rock. Didn't do much witnessing for Jesus, the atheists
and anarchists had the argument, but doing the worm or moshing to "praise
god" was still fun. We listened to CRASS, Circle Jerks, Bad Religion in
private, to supposedly "understand where the world (the unsaved) were
coming from", but the real truth is that we liked them. All a scam,
really.
  I think this is a sad example of religious repressio, not spiritual
expression, and people wanting to still be humans, and do  normal,
natural things called having fun despite all the born again facade and
it's fun squashing legalisms.  Obsession about sin and the devil's snares
and trying to convince yourself that you are better than everybody else
because you have Jesus and they don't sure takes a lot of hard work, and
going to a rave and dancing sure can help you reconnect to the real self
and the real world and give that burdened mind a rest. 
  I mean, going to a rave and taking your bible with you and having a
bible study sounds like to me like someone being prepared just in case,
of all times, the rapture takes place during a rave and not being left
behind, like if Jesus comes and catches me raving, I have an excuse.
"Mom, we're not having sex, we were practicing CPR!" I'm not saying that
this lady is a hypocrite or anything like that, but maybe, like hundreds
of other "born again" kids going to parties, she's trying to "have her
cake and eat it too". I've had too many kids, many fucked up on drugs,
trying to tell me about Jesus at a rave. These often times were the
saddest kids I saw at a party. 
  Jesus must be so sad to see his name become so synonymous with
repression. Good example of the difference between religion and
spirituality.
  Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Dont be afraid to play with the vinyle, if we where on cds i would be all about 
the pitch. Get your fingers all over the recs. Also play with the metal plate, 
touch it like you touch a clit; sometimes hard sometimes soft all depends on 
the need. Sometimes the vinyle is thin so you have to touch it light, there is 
no one way to cut the grass or brush your hair. So why should there be one way 
to play records. I say do what you need. Pitch is good for the milisec mix. The 
shit is just a hair off and you need to dail it in. I can play three records 
and when that is the case i will just use the pitch cause those bad boys run 
off sometimes. Like a cat with a fresh bag of nip. TECHNO IS ONLY SO STOP 
FRONTING AND PAY SOME RESPECT TO THREE RECORDS ON THE REGULAR.

MALACHY ON HOUSE

"When used with positive intention, Group energy has the potential to help 
restore the plan of Love on Earth...When you open your heart, and trust the 
whole group you dance with; when you feel love with everyone, and they 
return it, a higher vibration can be reached. This happens when a crowd is 
deep into the vibe of House...In the true sense of rhythmic movement, the 
effect is to align the physical, mental and emotional bodies with the 
Oneness of All that Is...Don't put out negative energy and feelings. Leave 
the old ways behind. Throw yourself into the winds of transformation and 
sow the seeds for a new world -- one where the human family is together 
again. When people respect each and care for each other as a 
community-organism...Spread the Peace!"

Come share another evening of unity through music and dance
with San Francisco's oldest house family.


Love,

Apollo

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"I know what the great cure is:  it is to give up, to relinquish, to 
surrender, so that our little hearts may beat in unison with the great 
heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."

Hey folks,
I haven't got confirmation from my scheduled guest for today, so we're
not going to mention who that might be.  Instead, we'll let you know
that we're dropping some techno this morning on Stanford Radio, KZSU,
90.1 FM between 9a & Noon.  We've already debuted some brand new tracks
from locals and internationals, but more is in store.  Also, LOTS of
tickets to give out, including Rabbit In The Moon & Hawke tonight at
1015, Mixed Elements parties tonight (Cloud 9) and Sat. (Chi Chi),
Velvet Shop tonight, Square tomorrow (Tall Paul) and Release on Sat.

Do tune in!

"To announce that there must be no criticism of the President or
that we are to stand by the President right or wrong is not only
unpatriotic and servile but it is morally treasonable to the
American public."

-Theodore Roosevelt, 1918

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Ok kids... See the IP address below? If you are hosted by this provider you
better check your machine quick like. I've been getting a flood of emails
from whoever you are. Not cool. If you can't use a computer and not open
virus attachments you don't belong online.

Open your virusscan (if you even have one) and scan your machines people.
It's not hard.

so, july 4th is coming up, and while your sifting through the shite that is most of contemporary music...thank god for the underground, huh? realistically, all artists know that some things are best buried...just view your shite (nice, huh? shite) as furtilizer...that's what all shite is...anyway though, while you are sifting through the shite that other's can't bring themselves to believe is shite, you might realize that what is truly always american is your classic rock 'n' roll, and no one who knows their stuff can get enough of the year 'round girls in tightie flag tank tops...they be com'in out in droves this weekend, folks...........D-R-O-V-E-S...so, basically, choose wisely, or rather, not at all :): ) :) :) :hahahahahah okay, more on the REAL rocker van halen tip...sorry for so much david lee...he's like the vanilla when you think about mr. sammy, but it is david lee on the "panama" track...oh thank you, track leader..i used to think that track was only a running meet that i
 would be destined to lose unless there be only three of us in the heat! panama!!!!!!! do dododo, panama-ha!!! do do donererererere...panama!!!!!!!!!dododododod, panama-ha-o-o-o-o! gotta keep motivated somehow in between the good production and the generic pre-programed destination. :O

>so, july 4th is coming up, and while your sifting through the
shite that is most of contemporary music...thank god for the
underground, huh? realistically, all artists know that some things
are best buried...just view your shite (nice, huh? shite) as
furtilizer...that's what all shite is...anyway though, while you
are sifting through the shite that other's can't bring themselves
to believe is shite, you might realize that what is truly always
american is your classic rock 'n' roll, and no one who knows their
stuff can get enough of the year 'round girls in tightie flag tank
tops...they be com'in out in droves this weekend,
folks...........D-R-O-V-E-S...so, basically, choose wisely, or
rather, not at all :): ) :) :) :hahahahahah okay, more on the REAL
rocker van halen tip...sorry for so much david lee...he's like the
vanilla when you think about mr. sammy, but it is david lee on the
"panama" track...oh thank you, track leader..i used to think that
track was only a running meet that i
> would be destined to lose unless there be only three of us in
the heat! panama!!!!!!! do dododo, panama-ha!!! do do
donererererere...panama!!!!!!!!!dododododod, panama-ha-o-o-o-o!
gotta keep motivated somehow in between the good production and
the generic pre-programed destination. :O

its all true-Carol Marvin is completely insane.

But Sarah, you forgot to mention what a hate-inspiring bitch-from-hell she happens to be!  In fact, she's all the reason I will ever need to distrust anyone claiming they're on a mission from God, as if this weren't a dubious claim to begin with!

For those who may not know, Carol Marvin and techno heavyweight Carl Craig started the DEMF.  She proceeded to charge huge sums to the city of Detroit while the festival lost more and more money each year.  Then she fired Carl Craig and alienated the entire techno community.  She's continued to be a massive pain in everyone's arse by blocking any other use of the name "DEMF" and attempting to hold a competing festival under that name.  

...uh - sorry for the rant!  ;) I don't even know how the example relates to anything but I can't let mention of this person slip by without unleashing Carol Marvin's completely deserved villification!

So like my friend Dhoris wanted 2 go out & I told her about Hemisphere & she was down 2 check it out!  So we get there... things are totally in mondo full swing!!  Right away while I'm headed 2 the dance floor... LoL... FABLE comes up 2 me & introduces himself!!!  LoL!  My goodness, Oh My Gosh, Hello 2Day... I been waiting 2 meet this cat 4 that past year!!!  FINALLY MAN =) OK.. I gotta say... HOmeboy got some wicked moves on the floor!!

So yeah... 2 Hours of Hemisphere seemed kinda week by like thinkin' about it... but man... it was SOOOOOOOOOO DAMN DOPE!!!  Hello 2DAy... there was sooooo much energy & man... was I dancing!!!  

OK... so 2 hours, 4 DJs, 2 Singers, & 1 Digurido player... how the fuck is that possible... right?  Well all the DJs played this huge tag set/ mash up dealie & the singer all took turns singing & traded off w/ the digurido player!!!  LoL  Oh My goodness.. there was even 1 time when Audio Angel was singing on the mic while Frogger (the Digurido player) played on the same mic!!  It was Neat!!  

When I 1st got there, Zigmund Void was spinning & she was busting out w/ the hard tracks the whole night when she spun!  Freya spun some crazy Jungle tracks & there was this 1 song she spun that had this really Awesome Breakdown in2 Breakbeats & man!  Cyan spun alota Vocal tracks & it was Dope!!!  

OK... there was this new singer girlie who I never saw B4... her name is Shannon & she's really Good!!!  Deep Soulful vocals!!  Although when I 1st heard her when she 1st got on while I was there... she sang kinda flat the 1st record she sung over, but it was still good!  Ofcourse Audio Angel swept my off my feet when she sang & when we danced 2gether!  I Love Audio Angel sooooooooo much!!!  Thanks Girl 4 the energy (if you're still a lurker on here Shida ;)

The whole time @ Hemisphere was fun!!  It was Groovy finally kickin' it w/ FABLE!  LoL... I swear man.. he got alotta good energy!

Subject: [sfraves] Gear for sale 


I have some gear to sell before I move.  It is the random odds and ends I
have after selling much of it already.

9 extension cords
8 blacklight fixtures with 12 blacklights (3 feet)
11 blinky lights (not strobe) that plug into a light socket
6-8 beautiful blacklight murals

I also have a few covers to stop lights including the no turn arrow ones and 
super bright, long lasting bulbs that I got at a city auction a while back,

email me if you are interested.

there are a ton of social clots out there for you to join, but here is the ultimate no-no...now, i know this is going to be just totally difficult for you to resist, but just try not to wear a cowboy hat with your dress and a pair of cowboy boots...cowgirl joe is sort of in fashion now, but that doesn't mean that you have to go there. if you don't own a horse or some steer, don't go there. there's a ton of other clots too that are just the ultimate, apparently. you can always just hang up the phone or walk away if you get stuck in one. everyone makes a wrong turn sometimes. :)

Subject: [sfraves] RE:  help elect a President who is against the Drug War

   I do like what David says, but the issue is elect ability. I'm afraid
that if he get's the Democratic nomination, he would be successfully
labeled a "left wing radical", exactly what they did to Dukakus and
McGovern, and we would have a guaranteed reelection land slide for Bush,
and that really frightens me the most. With that, the Neo conservative
agenda would really take off and accelerate, and a more obvious Nazi
America (opps! Not allowed to say that word! Oh well... fuck it!)  would
emerge. Right now, the Neo conservative's control of government is in
it's infancy, and a reelection of Bush, especially a land slide one 
would be interpreted by the Neo-Cons as a vote for their agenda for
America, which means the acceration of more wars, more low wage jobs
without rights or benefits, no health care for the masses, poor impotent
schools, the emasculation of the middle class, corporate take over of
farms, water supplies and other utilities, the compete or starve
mentality for disadvantaged Americans, more prisons, the re emerging of
racism, homophobia, sexism and other str8, white male domination
paradigms, and the extended criminalization of dancing and other forms of
fun.
  People are frightened and that fear is being exploited by the Neos to
divert toward the war on terrorism, while the same people who think Bush
is a great president are loosing their jobs (unemployment shot up to
6.4%) and falling in the obis of surfism; waving the flag and getting all
emotional about patriotism while being bent over and raped by these real
radicals!
  Fear will be their strategy for reelection, and what we have is issues.
But when people are kept in a state of fear 24/7, people aren't
interested in issues. That how the reptilian/fight or flight brain
operates, and without the reptilian brain functioning they (the Neos)
can't win. That is why many people on the "left" say that without a
diversion of wars and patriotic fanaticism, people would be forced to
look at the issues and run these real traitors out of town! 
 Again, as much as I like David, like I said earlier, he would be
successfully turned into another fear factor and would loose big time.
Right now, we don't have the luxury of nominating a strong left candidate
or voting for 3rd parties. Bush and his hard right radicals are that
dangerous and that scarry. 
 Right now anyone, even ("me too!") Democrats like Liberman, Gephart or
Kerry are a superior alternative to Bush. I'm not saying that I would
vote for them in a primary, but if either of them would be nominated, I
would hold my nose and vote for them just to get Bush out of office and
save America and the world. The problem with David Kucinich is not his
policies, I'm for most of them, the problem is America is not mature
enough to embrace him and his policies. We're still a infant country
still acting like a child, that hasn't experienced the devastation and
other troubles Europe had experienced that made them grow up and become
30-50 years ahead of us. We think war is cool because we haven't had our
cities bombed and millions killed by a war, and we think fascism is cool
too because we haven't experienced a hard core fascist government yet,
until we got Bush, and his reelection will show his real colors. It took
Hitler 5 years to be Hitler at his "finest". He knew the importance of
slow implication of his policies, and it was done by persistent
propaganda, fear, creating enemies, the destruction of civil rights in
the name of national security and radical German patriotism. Sound
familure?
 My strategy, I think will best serve us for now, is to be willing to
compromise some and support the best candidate who can beat Bush. I don't
know who this person is yet, but who ever he will be, we need to get this
person elected at all costs and then put the "progressive" pressure on
him if it turns out to be someone like Liberman or Gephart. Right now,
Howard Dean looks like someone who could make "progressive" issues more
palatable and beat Bush. But then, in the reptilian state of mind this
country is in, he may not be electable too. True, he is for the war on
drugs, but I think we can turn him around if we engage him on the subject
and make that an issue with him. 
 I just hope the rave scene will wake up and be part of the process,
because we are effected by who will be President in 2004. We can't hide
in our parties and keep the world away. Ashcroft in a 2nd Bush
admistration will certainly be crashing in on our parties and we will
expirence the big party bust of all time.
 I know i'll get flamed again for being "NRR", but what good is there to
get your $4,000 tax cut while the poor suffer for it, and Bush and his
wars makes us feel like men again when at the same time we are loosing
our rights, especialy to dance? To call yourself a raver and a Bushite
still sounds like s&m to me!
 Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Why are DJs more popular than producers that do Live PA?

Why do we have to follow England?

Why don't we believe in where we are?

Why do people in San Francisco have to release their music on an

this is a good song to sing secretly in the pisser...after the pee part, allow the song to occur to you while you look in the mirror and wash your hands or something like that (by the way, always wash your hands, or else, maybe later when you run your fingers through your hair, you might be a pee head)...okay, here is the chanson:
 
if i give my heart to you, i must be sure from the verrrrr------------eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee start that uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, will love me more than her! cuz i couldn't stand the pain, and i, would be sad if our new love.... was- in- vain (you know, that's old beatles, but sing it softly to yourself in the mirror and your so cute). :)

I try not to be so cynical about it, After all, if you had told me when I was 5 and going to sunday school that I would eventualy find spirituality by dancing all night listening to electronic music, I wouldnt have belived you, because until recently, I didn't understand that spirituality and religion were, at least for me, and I think for a lot of people,  two separate things. I have read interviews with this lady and she seems to have the kind of zeal that only the truely faithful posess, she is also considered by many to be a total nut, and is no longer in charge of the festival. It reminds me of this great Hindu Quote: 
 
The world calls me mad. I am mad. You are mad. The world is mad. Who is not mad? Still these madmen call me mad. Some are mad after name and fame. Some are mad after money. Some are mad after flesh. But blessed is he who is mad after God. Such a madman am I!

-Rang Avadhut

The point is that she started something really cool, and if *God* called upon her to do it, so be it. I don't have to belive it, you don't have to belive it, Detroit doesnt have to belive it, only she had to belive it enough to be compelled to get it done, and fortunately have the good sence to realize when her role was over and step aside. I was thinking about that with the front page article on the cronicle about the crop circles the other day, if it works for you to belive that crop circles are messages from higher bieings from space, and that gives you fulfillment, who am I to argue with your happiness? Even if they were made by pranksters, which they probably were, on a personal level, if it brings people joy, does it really matter who *really* put them there? "I Want to Believe" Like I am really disgusted with how some people (read John Ashcroft or any insert any hypocritical "Christian" you like here) have twisted cristianity, but occasionaly I will meet a Christian of strong
 faith that I realy admire, someone who does things like voulenteer  work and donates blood, and really lives an inspiring life, and I feel like if the Idea of "Jesus" is what helps inspire this person to be the kind of great person they are, does it really matter if "Jesus" is really the "Son of God" or even "real"? When I Had my "major depressive episode", I was riding my bike down the street crying, looking for a place to kill myself, and this Catholic, (at least I think she was catholic) Hispanic woman put her hands on me and prayed for me, Now, I personaly have always thought Catholocisim was the weirdest religion, but I know that this woman who I had never seen before and would never see again taking the time to pray for me helped, wether it was the fact that a total stranger cared, (which it was for me) or her faith that if she called on her God and saints to save me doesn't really matter, the point is that I am still here, and I really think that it made a difference. Strange
 that an old Catholic woman praying for me would lead me to Eastern Philosophy and raving, but eventaly it did. I think everyone needs to find their own path to spirituality, and wether you belive in ghosts, aliens, Yawah, Jesus, Buhdda, Astrology, or Science, doesn't realy matter, as long as you don't abuse it and force it on other people, I agree Jesus must be sad to see what some people have done with his name, but I like to think that at least a few are sincere and doing their best although "Christianity" just isn't the kind of spirituality that works for me. It's like teaching children to paint, some kids need to hold the brush one way, some kids need to hold the brush another way, some kids want to render copies of (groan) Thomas Kincade, others just want to (groan) mix every color on the pallette together, but when you see a kid's face light up with joy because you have helped him figure out the right way for him to hold the brush, and the painting is starting to look the way
 he wants it to look, even if it is still a bad painting by most standards, you know that putting up with "stage parents" and people who want to cure their kid's Adhd with oil painting is worth it because you've shared a little bit of your gift with someone who Really wanted to learn and is NEVER EVER going to forget that now they can do something they couldn't do before.

If I was a rabid fundamentalist/Pentecostal, I would call it looking for
a scriptural loop hole to have fun (sin), but for Jesus! I remember way
back in the late 80's when we had a "Christian" punk rock club, playing
"Christian" punk rock. Didn't do much witnessing for Jesus, the atheists
and anarchists had the argument, but doing the worm or moshing to "praise
god" was still fun. We listened to CRASS, Circle Jerks, Bad Religion in
private, to supposedly "understand where the world (the unsaved) were
coming from", but the real truth is that we liked them. All a scam,
really.
I think this is a sad example of religious repressio, not spiritual
expression, and people wanting to still be humans, and do normal,
natural things called having fun despite all the born again facade and
it's fun squashing legalisms. Obsession about sin and the devil's snares
and trying to convince yourself that you are better than everybody else
because you have Jesus and they don't sure takes a lot of hard work, and
going to a rave and dancing sure can help you reconnect to the real self
and the real world and give that burdened mind a rest. 
I mean, going to a rave and taking your bible with you and having a
bible study sounds like to me like someone being prepared just in case,
of all times, the rapture takes place during a rave and not being left
behind, like if Jesus comes and catches me raving, I have an excuse.
"Mom, we're not having sex, we were practicing CPR!" I'm not saying that
this lady is a hypocrite or anything like that, but maybe, like hundreds
of other "born again" kids going to parties, she's trying to "have her
cake and eat it too". I've had too many kids, many fucked up on drugs,
trying to tell me about Jesus at a rave. These often times were the
saddest kids I saw at a party. 
Jesus must be so sad to see his name become so synonymous with
repression. Good example of the difference between religion and
spirituality.
Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

<...uh - sorry for the rant!  ;) I don't even know how the example 
relates to anything but I can't let mention of this person slip by without 
unleashing Carol Marvin's completely deserved villification!>
 
 
Wow, being out of the Detroit loop for a decade, I had no idea just how insane she was, and sence I get the digest, I wrote my response to bohdi before I got this rant, although reading it over you can add "should have" in the right places and it still works, although it takes on a new and sinister meaning. Detroit, by the way, is full of insane people of this nature (last time I checked). I think it's something in the water.

Only, in reality, you could just delete political rant emails if you wanted 
to... and yet somehow you are compelled to read this lefty non-sense. Face it, 
you love to hate it. It comes from your own self-denial and pretentiousness, 
and down to the roots it really is a lot like S&M. You let people control you 
and cause damage to the world, chosing apathy, because voicing out you own 
honest to heart opinion is too embarressing for you to even fathom trying.   
"Right" on...

Subject: [sfraves] to the spirit of independence [nrr]

in the last year, i've thought a lot about what it
means to me to be an american.  after september 11,
2001, i watched a hysteria-induced patriotism sweep
the nation as millions plastered decals and
mass-produced american flags onto any kind of surface
area imaginable and i wondered to myself how many of
those people were concerned with anything other than
what their neighbors would think if they didn't.

a year later, those same decals had faded into
oblivion and i would look around to see shredded
pieces of fabric that once were an american flag
fastened to the antennas of cars and since forgotten. 
it made me sad.  a lot of things made me sad at that
time, i think.  president bush made me sad.  the idea
of products being sold on the merit of their
advertising, instead of the intrinsic value of the
product, made me sad.  capitalism made me sad.  up
until recently, i don't think i could have honestly
said that i was proud to be an american.  that made me
sad.

in general, i've never really had a taste for
nationalism, and particularly as a hippie-raver chick,
i've supported unity through diversity and opposed
elitism in most forms.  recently, i've come to
discover a real spirit of independence within myself,
the kind that imbues you with (or perhaps better said,
coincides with) a sense of faith in the future and the
kind of respect that you can only share with other
people.  and for once in my life, i began to identify
with my country.

this last friday, i thought about my dad's
grandfather's great-great-grandfather and how he and
his family must have felt to be alive as their newly
formed country signed a declaration of independence,
celebrating freedom from oppression and tyranny.  i
thought about my mother and her sister in vietnam in
the 1970s during the war, waiting for the opportunity
to come to this place where women have the right to
vote and families have homes to live in with indoor
plumbing.  

i thought about me and my sister and the time and
place in which we live.  i thought about renting a
movie and i thought about getting on the internet
today to post this message and i thought about what
party i was going to next and i thought about where i
wanted to live and how i was going to go about getting
there.  and i realized that i have the power and
freedom to choose.  and i felt lucky to be an
american.  

it was a good feeling.

happy belated fourth, yo.

:)sooz

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) fridge sized subs



I have one old double 18' JBL sub that is the SR series. Carpeted.
I am offering it for 325.00.  It is a good deal. The speakers are good and
will thump for a while more but the carpet is trashed. And the model is out
dated.

I also have 4 EAW FL 103's one pair has the tweeter blown. I think they are
103's they weigh 125 pounds and kick raw ass.
These are the best speakers you can put on stands. (ie: better than mackies
420's)
And I have a pair of LA 325's. with sb250s (4)

I will take offers on the eaw stuff.

No, see, here's the thing. When I see something our country does as a 
problem, I use my voice to make known my opinion. I tell my congressman 
or congresswoman my opinions on matters all the time. I *DON'T* 
constantly blab on mailing lists which have nothing to do with politics 
about my personal opinions on political matters.

If you have a problem, fix it. Don't bitch and moan about it, just fix it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE:  help elect a President who is against the Drug War

in reality, the left is going to have problems for
quite a while.  the pillars of the lefty movement just
don't matter to people anymore.  environmentalism,
feminism, the civil rights movement, etc and look at
how the leaders of these movements have brought shame
to their cause.  Jesse Jackson, gloria steinem, the
earth liberation front and any other idiot changing
him/herself to a tree to save a spotted owl but let a
human die.  people are waking up to the fact that
those movements have outlasted their welcome and have
become caricatures of a once proud cause.

the only thing the Left has now is the "hate america"
agenda that only appeals to other lefties and
euro-weenies like the french.  the left is relegated
to a minor supporting role and will only benefit from
republican mistakes but they won't earn it because
they deserve it.  it will be like getting table
scraps.

This website is a trip! I'm having too much fun with
it. I have recently added Willy Wonka, Violet,
Charlie, Oompah Loompah, Mr. Slugworth, Bjork, Agent
Smith, Sulley and many other fun people to my list.
Come join me and you can add them, too! I love this
service! It's such a fun way to meet new people and
get info out to them as well, ie. parties, events,
anything you like on the bulletin board. Oh, and be
patient getting on, it may take a few tries,
overwhelming responses to their server. See you there!

love & light~

Subject: Re: [sfraves] old flyer collection?

I have a bunch of old flyers if you or anyone is interested, 1990 - 2003
and counting...

I especially have large quantities from '91, '91, '92, '93, '94, '95, '96,
'97, '98 and so on...

I have quite a few "Gathering" Flyers, take care...

I don't think those *are* fake links...
the URL for the WMD page is blueyonder.co.uk, but the links to amazon
are all real books/film, I think.

Very clever little spoof, though... granted, it isnt *quite* as funny on
Mozilla [mmm tabbed browsing], since it's quite obvious that the IE
Error page is a spoof, but still ;)

Hey there,


   This page is awesome and rather more clever than other spoofs I've
seen...but how did they manage to get a fake page on Amazon? Or is that
one of those 3rd party bendor pages?  Is the URL spoofed?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] documentaries?

i would say "better living through circuitry" is one of the better docs so 
far.  i have "american massive," and it's decent.  talks more about the 
industry more, featuring carl cox, keoki, ak1200, dara and other moonshine 
artists.  "scratch" was definitely great, especially if you're into hip 
hop/turntablism. lots of history.  then there's "rave nation" by 
floor9films.  wasn't all that in my opinion, basically footages from raves 
with music in the background.  "groove" was a movie, not a documentary.  but 
it was good. a lot of ppl claim the movie is not an accurate depiction of 
the 'underground scene,' but i just found it entertaining.

couple of recent ones are paul van dyk's "global" dvd.  haven't watched it 
yet, so can't say much about it.  don't even know if it's a documentary.  
and finally, on my to-get list, tiesto's new dvd "another day at the 
office".  talks about his life on tour.  i can't wait to watch this one!

No, see, here's the thing. When I see something our country does as a
problem, I use my voice to make known my opinion. I tell my congressman
or congresswoman my opinions on matters all the time. I *DON'T*
constantly blab on mailing lists which have nothing to do with politics
about my personal opinions on political matters.
If you have a problem, fix it. Don't bitch and moan about it, just fix it.


     Then what you don't understand is that, to some people, the rave scene 
has everything to do with politics. To some people the rave scene is a 
movement. It is a gathering, in the tribal traditions that our government has 
destroyed. It's purpose is to oppose that power. The rave scene is not some fantasy 
la-la land where people go to forget about politics, and a Rave discussion list 
is not some fantasy la-la land where people only talk about DJ's and Venues. 
There are greater issues at hand, and they obviously have caught your interest 
because you read them. 
     These discussions also catch the intest of SF rave's younger readers who 
are just begining to understand politics. I know because that was once me. It 
was the rave scene that made me start thinking politically, it was the rave 
scene that made me have hope in democracy. Before the rave scene I never 
thought that I could make a difference, but after seening tens of thousands of 
people every weekend who supported a lot of the same ideas as I did, I started to 
think that eventually these ideas would rock the vote, that things would 
change. The only problem to this thereoy is that despite the fact that tens of 
thousands of people rave every weekend, this is by no means mainstream. Lots of 
people talk shit about how raves and electronic music are too mainstream and it's 
bullshit. They are just begining to become mainstream, don't believe me? Go 
out and do a survey ask every single american what kind of music DJ Dan spins, 
I bet you less than 10% answer correctly. Believe it or not most people either 
don't know or have an extream distorted view of what a rave is, and I bet you 
less than 5% of americans actually have attended more than one rave in their 
life. In my high school I'd say I was one of maybe 25 ravers out of over 500 
students at my school in 98 when I graduated. And trust me I took a lot of 
verbal abuse just for being known to go to raves.
      The other 95% of people who have been to one rave or less in their 
lives generally oppose raves. They ban their children from going, they frown upon 
their employees going to raves they don't let their g/f or b/f go to raves 
because they (like the government and the media) thinks raves are "bad". 
Therefore with that kind of public support the government can pass any laws they wish 
against us. 
     The rave scene is still in it's <A HREF="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=infancy">infancy</A>, I know most of you don't want 
to believe that becuase it's giving all these dumb young party kids out there 
more credit and it takes credit away from those of you who started it all. But 
it's true, just like hip hop, the rave scene is not a "Fad" or a "Phase" or a 
"Trend", and just like hip hop was, the rave scene has been labeled all of 
these words. And when you talk about large groups of people who are a part of a 
movement.... It blows my mind how someone can say it's not related to politics. 
It is politics, in it's most raw stage, it's politics in the pure and 
original form that it came from... revolution.
     The reason we write these ideas here on the list and not to our 
government representative is #1- most of us (espectailly the younger ones) don't know 
exactly how to go about doing that or if it will even be read if we do. #2 we 
seek constructive critisism (not mindless insults) from fellow ravers before 
standing on a soap box and preaching these ideas to the government. & #3 
because we know that lots of people read the list and we want to bring up good ideas 
and questions that will hopefully spread around to more people. 
     It's not bitching and moaning, it's intelectual conversation. It talking 
about what matters, getting our ideas out and sharing and listening to other 
peoples ideas. You have to do that first, then you can perfect them into 
something that will appeal the actual government.

I *love* how you refer to the collective sum of people that don't think
like you as the "Left" -- it really makes me feel like I'm part of
something, and that ideas like "liberty" are finally starting to get
under people's skin. Who are you to tell me that I "hate america"? I
certainly don't, but I'll tell you what *do* I hate: people telling me
what I think, or what *to* think. The whole idea that people
dissatisfied with our country right now "hate america" is divisive
propaganda, intended to force Americans into these bizarre camps of
right and wrong, left and right, or liberal and conservative -- and I
won't stand for it. Do your part to help avoid the next Red Scare: stop
spreading the propaganda.

This left/right rhetoric is getting really boring. We get it: you're a
political conservative, and you're damned proud of it. Welcome to
sfraves! Now say something of substance, or take your silly labels and
fanatical views elsewhere. And next time, remember to add "NRR" to the
subject line so people can skip over your bullshit. Thanks! :)

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR)Re: [sfraves] (NRR) help elect a President who is against the Drug War

there you go with labels.  after all that emotional
hyperbole about me labeling you.. you call me a
conservative.  my my my.  a quick scan of my voting
record, which you aren't privy to, would show you that
i voted for clinton twice and bush zero.  if you take
offense to what i say, then perhaps i struck a nerve,
which was my intent.  i subscribe to the belief that
if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's a
duck.  of course i am saavy enough to know that i used
a broad generalization that doesn't fit everyone from
the left.  christopher hitchens and michael totten are
great examples of lefties that believe in the war on
terror.. and have been spit upon by the left.  IMO, if
all i hear out of someone is "i hate our government,
military, economy, progressiveness, or whatever else
is great about america" I come to the conclusion that
you "hate america".  the only thing i hate is whiners.
 whether left or right.

in case you missed the intent of my original email,
which you certainly did, it was to inform any of you
with half a brain about what is wrong with the left in
politics.  if you disagree, i'd be glad to show you
how you are wrong.  the pillars of the democratic
party are falling apart: the fight against racism is
dead, feminism is dead, the environmental movement is
being run by a bunch of kooks that should have stopped
a long time ago, and the fight to help the poor has
turned into the biggest financial fiasco in american
history.  what else do the dems/left have to run on? 
multiculturalism (not likely)?  raising taxes?  being
weak on foreign policy and national security (granted
bush needs a little help here too sometimes)?  there
is no appeal whatsoever to the dems/left that i can
see, even for a person that finds it difficult to vote
republican.

so next time you sign off with PLUR, you might want to
THINK about the content of your email.  otherwise, you
lose any credibility in my eyes and it makes me wonder
if you even know what it means.

It's not electronica or rave but "Freestyle: The Art of Rhyme" is a fantastic
documentary of the freestyle hip-hop scene.  Not available on DVD, but you can catch
it at film festivals.  Much better than Scratch.

Subject: [sfraves]So, I met Osby(Hemisphere Review)

Wassup all, this past Thursday was really cool.  Since it was basically a 
Friday for me, I really wanted to go out dancing.  I didn't really want to 
leave the East Bay though, so I gave a shout out on the board.  Osby 
responded and told me about Hemisphere on Shattuck in Berkeley.  Anyway, I 
guess Hemisphere is the event that is put on at the Jupiter Restaurant.  Me 
and my two friends didnt know what to expect.  So we parked off of Shattuck 
and headed in.  The first thing you see is the neon blue Jupiter sign(I 
think it was blue..lol).  Then there is this enclosed brick hallway, with a 
dude sittin there checkn ID's and what not.  So we continue on walkn and I 
really dont know what to expect, I mean, this looks like a fancy restaurant 
and I didn't see any party kids or nothin.  Well, we get to the patio 
outdoor area and we immediatley hear some sick jungle beats and I already 
pick up on Audio Angel's voice.  This was tight!  I had always wanted to 
hear Audio Angel sing live and WOW...her voice is everything I had hoped it 
would be.  So I see a few people swayin back and forth, but all in all, the 
dance floor is basically non-existant...my friends were prepared to do 
something about that, but first I had to grab a beer.  So I drank my beer as 
fast as possible.  I am not sure who the DJs were, but I was totally feelin 
the beats and just listening to Audio Angel and this other girl sing(dont 
know her name, sorry).

So I look up and I immediatley see Osby!  He was socializing with several 
people and had this BEAUTIFUL girl by him named Doris.  Anyway I went up and 
told Osby who I was and he immediatley gave me a fat ass hug.  I was happy 
to finally hear him talk, because I remember talking to Rayn a couple months 
ago and he said that Osby speaks exactly how he does in his emails.  So 
anyway, Osby, your a cool kat, your everything that you come off as being on 
email(by the way, thank you for introducing me to Doris =)

So anyway, I finally felt a little buzz off my beer and I could tell that as 
soon as you step foot on the floor all eyes will be on you.  This was okay, 
because I feel comfortable with jungle, Im always dancing to it in my room.  
So I went up towards the front and just got down, I started breakn a sweat 
but I was really feelin the music and I just needed a release so I was happy 
to find an outlet.  My buddy got down on the dancefloor with me and at one 
point Osby cheered me on...I wished that his homegirl had been 
dancing(grin).  I downed another beer, and kept dancing until there really 
wasn't anymore room.  It was great seeing everyone dance, and this one guy 
was really gettin down he was doin some really coordinated kicks and spins 
and what not...it was a cool crowd.

Anyway, the shindig was comin to an end at around 11 and Audio Angel and the 
other singer were closin out and what not.  At one point Audio Angel was 
talkn to someone next to me and I took the opportunity to say hello.  Man, 
Audio Angel is HELLA COO!  She aint bigheaded or nothin, she is just an all 
around genuine person.  I hope to see her in the near future, she is 
seriously a big impression.  I just realized now that I hadn't said goodbye 
to Osby and Doris, so..Sorry Osby!  I will see yah soon I know it!!  Tell 
Doris I said hi!

After Hemisphere we headed over to Blake's and proceeded to get down and 
dirty to some horrible mainstream hiphop.  Then I had some breakfast at 
Denny's and realized at that point I should not have been in public because 
I had two beers and three long islands inside of me(eh).

Well, this coming weekend Im kickn it with my homegirl Reverie, Im lookin 
forward to some house maybe...hmmm(what yah think Rev?)

All in all it was a cool Thursday night.

I think you still missed -his- point entirely.

'Left' and 'Right' are artificial labels created by what has developed
itself into a two-party system. Most of us with half a brain don't
identify ourselves as 'lefties' or 'right-wingers'.

It is this left/right, democrat/republican, liberal/conservative
distinction that causes us so much trouble and determines why we have
almost no choice at the ballot every year. It is why voting 'independent'
seems so useless and pointless to people.

We've come to group not just our politicians, but the entirety of our
society, into two camps. Human beings are not so easily categorized. If we
continue to categorize ourselves, however, we will fit more snugly into
the moulds we create for ourselves. And that way leads a lack of
individual initiative.

Why develop your own opinions when they can be determined by whether your
'left' or 'right'?

party hard?? nooo we only had 3 nights we could have danced until dawn why should we take the opportunity???
 
thursday night i think i read something.... friday (only because it was free) i wanted to see how tall tall paul was and see if he was any good....2,0000 molestations later i left ruby skye with 2 new friends under my belt (sweet bartender and clockworks promotors) and a rather jaded and awful opinion of tall paul
 
had more fun pounding my feet on concrete, gravel, and ballroom floors watching lasers on cargo ships out in the bay at the kelly's bash....lots of uk hard house and nrg, cyber trance, breaks, even early happy hardcore (not a fan but hey, others liked it), a darker Bonham set than i've ever heard...and uberzone's wicked electro percussion and digital 'scratching'  on the cdj.  random set up though...hard house set led into a hiphop set with 50 cent playing...all in all a great night with lots of variety, and fun fun people.  great vibes....woke up at 12:45 this morning with my roommate pounding on my door because she didn't have the key to the damn deadbolt.  that's what you get for going camping for the weekend and coming home late...she should have been home listening to thumpradio.
 
my body is tingly all over and has been for about 24 hours, and i even partied sober...i like that tingly soreness though...it's a bittersweet memory of the previous nights and keeps me going until the next...superqool wednesday and thump saturday....
 
peace all...i feel yeah, but it's worth it isn't it?

what i *do* understand is that there is a small but exceedingly vocal 
segment of the "rave scene" which views raves as a way to promulgate 
left-wing politics, using the scene to do so much as "Jesus freaks" and 
half-pint politicos used the rock-and-roll concert scene in the 1970s.  
frankly, i'm sick and tired of hearing it.

That's all I wanna do everyday ;)

This Monday is really rough.  3 hours of sleep last night.  Beat the
crap out of my body all weekend dancing and trying to be athletic again.
The upside is both of my bosses are out of town still!  I'm feeling a

Well, I don't know what happened but here goes. No one showed. It looked =

No line to get in, still had to fork out 15 though.=20

This was my first time going to that club. Nice place, a lot of =

There was a cat downstairs spinning rap, not my cup o tea, so I....

I went upstairs and DJ Moda was laying down some nice proggy beats. No =
one on the dance floor; Which doesn't bother me, I took that floor and =
made it mine. I danced for about 45 minutes, still no one out there. Saw =
John '00' come in and went over to say hi. Met him and DJ Moda. What a =
nice bunch of guys. They really were, completely approachable. It is =
always nice, when there are dj's you admire and you can actually talk to =
them. Shot the shit for a moment. Then John walked out of the room.=20

Then all the lights went on. They shut down the room. No hard feelings =
for John what-so-ever. I understand why he didn't play, but, that didn't =
make me feel any better.I will just have to catch him next time. I guess =
he was playing Vancouver the next day and wanted to get some r n r.=20

So, not feeling the rap vibe, we left.

Got to my car, and it was completely bashed in. Everything taken. They =
couldn't just break the window, they had to completely rip off all my =

clothes, smokes, and anything that wasn't bolted down. The bastards even =

collection of John Digweed Kiss 100 show(s), that I tape religiously =
every Friday. poop. Not that it matters, 'cause I have no stereo, but, =
now I have no cd's.

So all in all, I had a really sh*tty 4th. Not only did I pay 30 bucks to =
*not* see a DJ, but, I got jacked too.

Labels are, obviously, what you're comfortable with. I'm trying to speak
in your language, and it's apparently not working. Why is it that you
are so quick to label me, but I can't label you?

> a quick scan of my voting record, which you aren't privy to, would

So what? I don't care who you voted for, it doesn't give you the right
to disrespect people. What *do* you believe, then? All I've heard from
you is how much you hate the "left" -- what other conclusion am I to
reach other than that you are, in fact, a political conservative? You've
given me nothing to go on except contempt for other people's beliefs.

> if you take offense to what i say, then perhaps i struck a nerve,
> which was my intent.

Then you're trolling. You're intentionally striking a nerve by making
broad generalizations and blasting people's personal and political
beliefs on a rave-releated mailing list. It's off-topic and disruptive
behavior. If your only intent was to "strike a nerve", then you
shouldn't have posted at all. Again, say something substantive or take
your nonsense elsewhere.

If you're so savvy, try avoiding such generalizations next time --
you'll save yourself a lot of grief from people that don't enjoy being
targets of your unprovoked rediculousness.

> IMO, if all i hear out of someone is "i hate our government, military,
> economy, progressiveness, or whatever else is great about america" I
> come to the conclusion that you "hate america".

Then you've got some logic issues. I don't think many people can
honestly say they hate their country, but is it wrong to say that you're
not satisfied with the administration's policies? The government and the
military are *NOT* what is "great about america" -- what's great about
this country are the people and the freedoms that they enjoy. What
worries me is that the people are getting greedy, angry, and scared, and
they're giving up their freedoms because of money and a temporary, false
sense of security. What I hate, again, is that you and I are even
arguing about this. I find it ludicrous that other people can't see what
is going on in this country. You're defending the very people that seek
to destroy everything that *is* "great about america".

> the only thing i hate is whiners.  whether left or right.

Whiners? I don't think you'll find any whiners here, pal. Everyone that
I know on sfraves is very passionate about what they believe. Many of
them (myself included) actively fight for their rights by raving,
participating in rallies and marches, sending emails and faxes to all
levels of government, and making themselves heard in public forums. It's
just stupid to label somebody who voices their opinion on a mailing list
as a "whiner" because you assume they don't do anything else
politically. So stop it.

Gee, that sounds like whining to me! And no, I didn't miss your intent
-- but I very obviously disagree with it.

You've got some serious problems if you think that the fights against
racism and feminism are dead. Environmentalism certainly isn't dead
because of kooks tying themselves to trees -- the EPA still exists, and
there's quite a bit of work to be done to reverse the harm that Bush's
policies (not signing the Kyoto Treaty, for one) have done so far.

What else to they have to run on? Education. Social welfare, including
assistance for the homeless and destitute, and better public health care
(including health insurance for all Americans). The reinstatement of
civil rights tarnished by the Patriot Act. Better (err, "actual")
foreign policy and diplomacy, instead of military threats and
unconditional demands. Equal rights for all Americans. Restrictions on
the privacy-infringing Office of Homeland Security. Campaign finance
reform, and all the other things that affect politicians' abilities to
act on behalf of their constituency. Drug reform, including harm
reduction and therapy as alternatives to illegalization and prison terms
for soft drug offenders. The shriveling economy, the rising jobless
rate, and corporate accountability. I could go on and on... there are
plenty of issues to "run on" in this day and age, and they're all
substantial, important issues that affect the majority of Americans in
their day-to-day lives. What more do you need?

Oh well. I think it's sad to think of an American that doesn't consider
any of the issues I've mentioned (among others) as "appealing".

Your ignorace astounds me. How can you pretend to know what PLUR is
about if you're preaching the death of civil rights and feminism? What
do I care about my credibility in your eyes when you have no credibility
in mine? You just popped up out of nowhere as "Captain Scarlet",
proclaiming the demise of the "left" and bashing "leftists" as you saw
fit. You hide behind this bizarre fanatical pseudonym, spouting off to a
rave-related mailing list about abstract politics, and you demand
credibilty from *me*? Nice try.

But I guess that's what I get for feeding the trolls. :\

There you go with 'wing' delineations again.

Rock and roll was political too.

Guess what. All those hippies who dropped out of society? Who ate all that
acid and we make 'dirty hippy' jokes about? They were political, too.
Until they decided that politics were just playing into the man's game,
and the only way to fight back was to opt out.

Nonetheless, all political and social issues aside...
There are certain powers in our government who DO NOT LIKE US.
This is not a personal issue with Howlin' Bob, or Apollo, or Sean, or
anyone else.
Some people think 'ravers' are a bunch of drug-addled buffoons. Others
think we're dangerous criminals. Others thing we're a threat to the moral
fabric of society. Most simply don't care -- aside from cracking down on
'BAD ECSTASY SUPERNINJA RAVE 3000' will make me look like I'm fighting the
drug war and win me some votes.
Some, perhaps, are even existential enough that they despise seeing human
beings behave and feel like human beings.

Their motivations are irrelevant. If a small but vocal portion of these
groups have their ideal (and, hopefully, impossible) way, there would be
no sf-raves. There will be no intimiate underground beneath the streets of
San Francisco, there will be no Cool World, there will be no DJ Howlin'
Bob. The fact that there are people who would love to crush the electronic
music scene (or commercialize it to the point where there is absolutely no
soul left in it) is a very real fact that you need to come to terms with.

This is not a matter of left or right wing politics. It is not a matter of
nationalism or loyalty to a leader.

It's a matter of protecting your right to dance.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE:  help elect a Pre sident who is against the Drug War (NRR)

>(Sean)There you go with 'wing' delineations again.

yet another version of the mini-meme i've been seeing more andmore: people 
who are *obviously* arguing from the politicalpersepctive long known as 
"Left," but who demand not to be called "leftist."  undoubtedly this has 
more to do with the desire to avoid the stigma of failed policy that has 
adhered to the Left over the past half-century than with any desire to 
expand the argument..

>The fact that there are people who would love to crush the electronic
>music scene (or commercialize it to the point where there is absolutely no
>soul left in it) is a very real fact that you need to come to terms with.
This is not a matter of left or right wing politics. It is not a matter of
>nationalism or loyalty to a leader. It's a matter of protecting your right 
>to dance.

seriously, do you think that isn't obvious?  perhaps you haven't noticed 
that the RAVE Act was originally proposed by Senators Leahy (Democratic, 
left-liberal) and Biden (Democratic, left-liberal) and finally attached to 
the AMBER Alert bill by the aforementioned Biden?  sounds to me like it's 
the people you'd have me *support* that are the biggest threat to my "right 
to dance."

additionally, the conflation of those who would allegedly "crush the 
electronic music scene" with those interests who wish to "commercialize" it 
is utterly specious.  after all, isn't it the large commercial interests who 
have the most to lose economically if the EDM scene is "crushed"?

you're so afraid of the Ashcroft Boogeyman that you can't even see your 
liberal congressional Democrats selling you out for another shot at the 
power they have so signally abused for most of the last fifty years.

this is historically inaccurate.  the "hippie" scene (i hesitate to use the 
term "movement," since there was no leadership nor any generally understood 
principles) was decidedly ANTI-political, and the SDS-type ideoplogues used 
to decry this constantly circa 1970, when i started high school.  by the 
way, i was/am one of those "hippies."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr focking Monday

Monday's are bad mkay.....


I partied it up on Friday and had an absolute blast but spent Saturday
and Sunday being sicker than a dog. So now today I am still coughing
shit up out of my lungs and then this morning on the news they are
talking about cases of whooping cough possibly in my area as I am
hacking to the point of almost puking. I wish they wouldn't show that
shit when I am sick it makes me freak out a little bit. Hopefully I will
be feeling well enough to play on Wednesday otherwise I will be feeling
sick for another week. Peace

Not registered as a democrat. :)
I am not part of your 'left'.
I do not support a political party.
I am not asking you to vote for whatever unfortunate candidate the
Democrats come up with. I say 'unfortunate' because it's very unlikely the
nearly-crushed democrats will have a canditate that will be capable of
winning the next election.

I do not cheer or boo people based on their political party.

I make my decisions on character individually, rather than blindly
following a party line.

Your argument fails.

I really wish people would stop calling environmentalisim a "left" cause. It is not. I learned a long time ago that there are plenty of people of all walks of life who want to save the environment. I used to really hate hunting, for instance, untill I realized that the big woods behind the house where I grew up was saved from rabid developers and a landfill company by (dat da da da!) Hunters! Shure there are some Idiots with guns, but When I realized that the majority of hunters really legitimately cared more about preserving open space than being rabid killing machines and just wanted to have a woods to hang out in like me, I realized we had more in common than I thought. I would rather stay out of the woods for two weeks a year and have it safe from developers than not have the big ass hunting lobby on my side. So get to know your "enemies" it may turn out that you really want the same thing.

Funny thing.  I really haven't been following this thread carefully, but I 
would think electing a President who is against the WOD would be a good 
thing, especially for those old apolitical hippies:)  BTW, I don't know 
what the "hippie" poster (poseur?) was smokin' back in those days, but most 
of those I knew as hippies saw themselves as counterculturalists who were 
in clear opposition to the values of the established 
culture.  Political?  Who can take seriously the views of  a person who 
thinks the Democrats have run the country for the past fifty years:)?  One 
wonders what some of these folks actually stand for....

What distresses me about some of the political discussion on this list is 
that it consists of name calling and little else.   The worst kind of 
bigotry:  making blanket assumptions about the values and beliefs of 
individuals;  dumping everyone and everything into neat categories so they 
aren't required to challenge themselves intellectually or enter into some 
discussion with specificity.

I have found that when I talk to people I've had heated discussions with 
off line as individuals there is not much separating us.  Useless terms 
like lefty and neocon evaporate when one moves beyond the level of radio 
talk show mentality.

Love,

Apollo

So then the point is that, to us, it's not really about right and left but=20
rather which officials are going to support our rave scene. I could see how=20=

would be inclined to think that the left side of the government would be mor=

"open minded" to raves. but that's just an assumtion, there is not one=20
political figure that I can think of off the top of my head who is sincerely=
 "pro=20

their efforts to remain politically corrent they have failed to undrestand w=

the rave scene actually is. And in this failiur they have proposed bills tha=

don't even seem "liberal" to us ravers, yet the government and media labels=20

You have to look at all the variables that surround each member of the=20

they could also have a stick up their ass about other issues that we think a=

proper research and they could use some corrections but not insults.

Of course you could always look at who has signed anti-rave legislation.
George Bush being at the top of the list.

I have a hard time believing that someone who goes to all night parties
(unless they are cops) would vote Republican.
I take that back, Republicans are known for their all night (cross burning)
parties.

IT’S COMING… 

The festival you have waited all year long for! 

Saturday September 20th, 2003 

CYBERFEST 03 
11th annual Music & Arts Festival 
 
Featuring...
 
KRAFTWERK (Germany)

Initially viewed as a quirky band of German nerds propounding the values of a mechanized state through systematic electronic pop music, Kraftwerk have gone on to influence countless genres and musicians, including the driving techno of Aphex Twin and Juan Atkins, the surreal ambient of the Orb and the rumbling hip-hop of Afrika Bambaataa and Public Enemy. 
Formed by music conservatory students Ralf Hutter and Florian Schnieder in 1970, the pair went on to form permutations with various other artists (who in turn formed Neu! and Doldinger), releasing albums such as Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk 2, and Ralf And Florian. It was with electronic percussionist Wolfgang Flur and violinist Klaus Roeder that the band found their winning formula of mechanized beats and plainly electronic, but weirdly human-sounding melodies. Influenced by the Bauhaus school of German impressionism that existed before World War II, this group recorded Autobahn, which was an international hit with a single of the same name. Hutter, ever the group spokesman, talked of having a band of instruments that could tour without human control, leaving the band to sunbathe or read. Through the remainder of the '70s, Kraftwerk released Radio-Activity, Trans-Europe Express (which Bambaata sampled for his ground breaking "Planet Rock"), The Man Machine (the accompanying tour featured
 robots on stage), Computer World (1981), Electric Cafe (1986), and The Mix (1991). 
 

Also Just Added to Cyberfest 2003 -->

>(Apollo)I really haven't been following this thread carefully, but I would

i make my political decisions on what i consider to be best for the country, 
not merely on the basis of what might be beneficial to me personally.

you really shouldn't insult people who you call "friends" to their face by 
calling them "poseur" online.

>but most of those I knew as hippies saw themselves as counterculturalists 
>who were in clear opposition to the values of the established culture.

that is not the same in any sanse as being part of the Leftist "political" 
discourse.

>Who can take seriously the views of  a person who thinks the Democrats have 
>run the country for the past fifty years:)?

fact: by dominating the Congress, the Democrats have effectively controlled 
the political discourse, and have stalled many desperately-needed measures, 
e.g. welfare reform, school choice.

>What distresses me about some of the political discussion on this list is 
>that it consists of name calling and little else.

pot.  kettle.  black.  (see above)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr focking Monday

I just tend to be a hypochondriac when I hear things on the news like
that. I am more concerned I have been coughing for around 2 1/2 weeks. I
have insurance but fuck if I will go see a doctor. I really don't trust
anyone who gets kickbacks from major drug companies. I am sure I will be
better soon. I will take plenty of hers and a few wheat grass shots and
then off to drink I go. Peace

so, all i have are some things to show for it. some things and some other things and then after those things are all through, there will be more things, but what i do know is that without those things and the other things, i am the luckiest person on earth, probably, and if not, then one of the luckiest. maybe that sounds better, but just the same, sounding better doesn't mean a hill of beans if you have no beans. :)

what you call knitpicking, i call facts.  and you
proved my obtuse/filter comment perfectly.  thanks. 
you say i couldn't address your points.. i didn't have
to.  you don't have one.  you didn't even acknowledge
the fact that kyoto is a sham.  you just focued on the
fact that bush didn't sign it.  guess what?  clinton
didn't either.  and no POTUS in his right mind would. 
but you wouldn't understand that issue because you are
uninformed.

CPT Scarlet out,

LOL. You've got me all wrong, buddy. Guess what I said
"struck a 
nerve",
eh? How can you say I'm filtering anything out when
you're the one
glossing over the important parts of my emails, then
nit-picking things
like this:

> for example, what do you know about kyoto?  you know
that we didn't
> sign it.

That's all I should have to know: the Kyoto Treaty set
forth standards
for, among other things, internationally reducing air
pollution. Do
*you* know why Bush refused to sign it? Because
corporate lobbyists won
out over environmentalism and common sense. Not that I
don't care about
the fact that China's not living up to their part of
the bargain (which
I was well aware of, thank you very much), but I'm
much more concerned
that our president would refuse to sign it at all.
We're not talking
about China, we're talking about America. This point
is so
insignificant that I feel silly having to defend it.

My view is myopic? How is the simplistic belief that
nobody be denied
their individual rights to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness
"myopic"? Idealistic, perhaps... But I'm not the one
trying to sort
people into these cookie-cutter molds of "liberal" and
"conservative",
"left" and "right", or Democrat and Republican.
*That's* myopic. You're
so sure that everything I have to say is diametrically
opposed to your
opinions that you're willing to brush everything I say
aside (which
you've done several times) and just insult me
personally. Nice
"perspective".

News flash: ethnic minorities have had equal
protection under the law
for decades, and descrimination still runs rampant in
this country. But
it's not just about ethnic minorities now, either:
it's also about gay
rights, and the perpetual struggle to maintain a
woman's control over
her own body. Civil rights extend to staying out late
at night, or
whatever it is we like to do for fun. If civil
liberties aren't an 
issue
anymore, why is it still seen as subversive to be a
"card-carrying
member of the ACLU"?

Why must you insist upon comparing America to other
countries in an
attempt to belittle our problems? Things are *always*
horrible 
somewhere
else, but that doesn't mean we can't complain when
things get 
relatively
worse at home. Even worse yet, a "bad" American
military has the 
ability
to inflict harm upon innocent civilians all over the
world without our
say-so. Are you really comfortable with anyone
controlling the entirety
of America's military might -- let alone somebody that
refers to
millions of protestors worldwide as a "focus group"?

do you think W

 you probably 
do.

Erm, no -- that's another rediculous presumption on
your part. People
threw a fit when Lincoln suspended Habeas Corpus
during the Civil War,
with good reason. But we're not at war -- we're
dealing with the same
terrorist threat that existed since the day we got
involved with 
Israel,
and our unilateral actions overseas have only given
religious
fundamentalists another reason to hate us.

In a traditional war, I might be more willing to
accept restrictions of
personal liberties, knowing that as soon as the war
was over, they 
would
be lifted. But the terrorists will never stop, and I
will *not* accept 
a
perpetual PATRIOT Act that allows the government to
track my every 
move,
and threaten my friends with "no-fly" lists. My only
hope for this
presidency is that Bush can push that Road Map through
and give
terrorists one less reason to hate us so much.

So you admit that the PATRIOT Act was a mistake, but
you reconcile its
existence because you think it'll just "right itself"?
Like Hiroshima,
the WWII Japanese imprisonment camps, Bosnia and
Hersegovina, the
botched Operation Iraqi Freedom, and every other
political "mistake" 
the
government's made, right? I don't care what party any
of the 
politicians
belonged to when they made these mistakes, but the
government shouldn't
be allowed to make them at all. When American policy
makers make
mistakes these days, people tend to get hurt or die.

You know, I don't really care too much about being
able to party all
night legally -- I don't even get out that much. But
it's the
*principle* of it. Going out and dancing all night is
a fundamental
right that people all over the world enjoy. Yet
Americans were so
frightened by the media fanaticism over ecstasy that
they allowed night
life to be all but threatened out of existence by
(among other things) 
a
law that passed without a vote in Congress. And while
I don't believe
marijuana's going to be legalized any time soon, I
find it frightening
that the same legislation intended to combat club
drugs has found its
way into the hands of officials who used it to
threaten a NORML event
into cancellation.

People protested in the past when things like this
happened, and
thankfully things were "righted". But we can't depend
on the 
floundering
checks and balances system when government's
controlled by a single
party. I don't care if it's Democrat or Republican,
it's never a good
idea. Ours is a representative government, and people
that share my
wishes and concerns are not being represented fairly
at this point in
time. I'm trying to keep things on-topic here, so this
stuff is going 
to
sound trivial compared to other issues -- but it's not
unimportant. And
if you think it is, then you're going to be pretty
surprised when your
apathy allows this government to trample all over the
rights that 
you're
fond of.

Do you really feel safe though? Has the war on Iraq
saved us from a
madman with a massive arsenal of WMD's? No. Rather,
they've put 
hundreds
of thousands of Americans in harms way, and given
Islamic
fundamentalists another reason to hate our country.
Our new school of
pre-emption has alienated us from the rest of the
world, and encouraged
countries like North Korea and Iran to accelerate
their weapons 
programs
so that they might be able to fend us off, or at least
kill a bunch of
Americans on their way out. Now is not a good time to
have a family to
feed, when unemployment's at its highest in nearly a
decade. And by the
time your kids are old enough to need it, there won't
be any Social
Security because we'll have squandered it trying to
protect fossil 
fuels
and on multi-billion dollar weapons to "defend" our
country.

You may accept restricted liberties, but don't you
dare expect the rest
of us to take it lying down. Call me idealistic, but I
wouldn't be in
America if I didn't believe we were capable of
becoming a genuinely 
free
nation. I'm here because I think things can and will
get better for
*everyone*, and I'm doing everything I can to make
sure that happens as
soon as possible. What are *you* doing to help your
fellow Americans?

There you go again, putting words in my mouth...

That's a really common position for people that have a
hard time 
getting
their position across: "So, rather than explain
myself, I'll just pick
apart a few of your points, then duck out with
something that sounds
witty so I have the last word." Nice.

Please, try to find an email in which I said "the dems
are the last 
hope
for your rights in this country". I double-dog dare
you. You're so
blinded by your hatred of the "left" that you're
making up things to
argue against. It's kind of disturbing, actually.

You know, I shouldn't even be responding to this because you posted an
off-list message back to the list. That's really rude.

But hey, you sure know a lot about the Kyoto Treaty. Guess that puts the
whole "left"/"right" issue to bed, k thanks!

Subject: [sfraves] atlantis is where-at?

so yeah, the conversations before about atlantis being at the richmond civic 
and how cool that was since it's an old school venue that hasn't been used 
in like 5 years...

so following the little followup with folks saying they lost the venue, no 
they didn't, it is in richmond, no it's not....so i heard from another 
source that it's going to be in SF.  so out of curiousity i just called the 
info line and it says it's going to be at a "virgin" location with no 
mention of the richmond civic.  check the website and there's no mention of 
the richmond civic no any specific location.

this is almost as fun as atlantis in 2000 (was it?) where they said it'd be 
at the "west oakland events center" which didn't exist and someone on this 
list even got some overhead satellite photo of the region they said it was 
going to be at.  ah, those were good times....

Well, for one who wants to bash others for not knowing their "facts", you sure
seem to be lacking on yours:

http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/07/25/column.novak/

Clinton DID, in fact, sign the Kyoto treaty.  Bush has effectively caused the
US to renege on the deal by exploiting cheney's position as president of the
senate to prevent its ratification.  He has done the same thing to the CTBT
(Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty)  And he "unsigned" the ICC (International
Criminal Court), so as to place US soldiers above the law, when they commit war
crimes.

Now, Kyoto WAS flawed.  It actually allowed, for example, Russia to INCREASE
CO2 emissions to 1990 levels (Said emissions had dropped between 1990, and the
time Kyoto was negotioated.).  And it exempted many "developing" countries
(including China and India) altogether!  Obviously those loopholes needed to be
slammed shut, the Kyoto provisions made universal, and with severe trade and
financial penalties for any violation.  Kyoto wasn't perfect..  But it was a
step in the right direction.

And when you come right down to it, those treaties were negotioated in good
faith, and bush should have not have been a spiteful little prat and abrogated
them just because they were signed by a democrat.  What does it say about the
integrity of the United States as a whole if the treaties it signs are so
fleeting as the whim of whoever is president four years later?  Would the US be
so elastic with other countries?  Or would we expect them to hold to agreements
they committed themselved to even when their leadership DID change?  Is Iraq,
for example, now and forever exempt from the non-proliferation treaty, and the
UN provisions barring its possesion of other WMDs, simply because Saddam
Hussain is no longer in charge?  Or will THEY be held to the terms of the
treaties they signed, even though the presidency has passed?  I suspect the
latter, even though bush obviously doesn't seem to feel that *HE* has to live
up to the obligations of treaties signed by previous US presidents.

Seems that, under the bush regime, the era of good faith negotionation is gone,
replaced with: "might makes right".


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) help elect a President who is against the Drug War

point for you, however clinton was in office for 8
years before he signed it.  the only reason he did was
to leave a flaming sack of shit on bush's desk.  IMO,
it was politics as usual and the signature wasn't
worth the paper it was written on.  

might makes right is one way of looking at it.  but
put yourself in bush's place... you have an ever
growing nuclear proliferation problem that clinton
helped make worse.  couple that with nKorea selling
long range missiles to anyone that wants them and a
recent terrorist attack that killed 3000 people on
american soil.  would you honestly put americans at
risk because of a treaty that was signed during the
cold war?  i wouldn't.  the same people that didn't
want us to back out of that treaty, were the same ones
that benefited from having nukes to threaten us with. 
russia and china.  china is especially ticked because
now they don't have the ultimate equalizer to help out
their pitiful armed forces.  for those of you that
don't know, a first strike with nukes WAS the
centerpiece of the chinese army's game plan to fight
the US.  

when you are the POTUS, you have to make some tough
decisions. 

and to shawn, i didn't realize that the last email i
responded to was straight to me.  i'm not using my
usual email proggy, outlook, but the crappy yahoo
default program.  i'm currently overseas at an
undisclosed location on vacation trying to blend in
among people that don't necessarily like me.

Subject: [sfraves]NRR: Collecting Money for School?

Hi all,

I need around $8000 dollars to attend an International Business School in 
Holland, I have already been accepted, but the void in cash has forced me to 
postpone my trip 6-12 months.  What I am wondering is, do students ever 
lobby for 'donations' or 'grants' from legit companies, or wealthy people?  
I was thinking I could write up a letter of request to send out to companies 
and people and what not, what have I got to lose?  Someone may want to make 
this opportunity happen for me.

I don't really have good credentials though, thats the only thing.  I am not 
currently attending any college classes, I have a horrible high school grade 
point average...  But I have three years of administrative work experience 
if that is worth anything.  I dunno, maybe people will just take it as a 
joke kid who wants to smoke weed on a free ride for four years(grin).  In 
all seriousness though, I want to pursue this Business Degree.

Thanks for any and all responses.

Have you pursued all of the federal loan and grant options? That's how
it's most commonly done. If the school you are planning on attending
doesn't have this info, someone from a financial aid office at a local
college should be able to help.

Wassup Dan!

I have done a bunch research for grants, but I only found one that I was 
elligible for.  This is the one that I am counting on, but it can't hurt to 
ask around other ways.  I told my idea to a few co-workers and they think 
its nuts.  So I guess I should go the grant route.

If that doesn't work, you can always sell drugs.  That will make you plenty of money
so you can go to Holland and... buy drugs :-)

check out the local library and college libraries, go to the reference department and look through those big books full of private scholarships and grants...
 
i signed up for fastweb once before..you can find a lot of stuff on there, it's not amazing, but it's not bad. i would set up a 'junk' email account for it though because after you fill out your profile with ethnicity info, location info, money info, what kind of dog you own info..you end up getting a lot of notices, so i would set up a separate account...
 
there are lots of scholarships for women studying abroad i remember seeing those when i was registered with fastweb.... also type that shit into google...good luck if i have some spare time i'll see what i can find. 
 
cheers,

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I am building a project for Burningman out of "raver beads."  It will be part of a sponsored theme camp so it will be pretty visible. I was going to buy the beads with a grant but I have heard a lot of people on and off this list say that they "don't do candy anymore" and I thought it would add a really cool conceptual element to the peice if I used donated beads. I need, in order of importance 1) 9mm Flourecent Pink (sometimes called flourecent red)  Barell Pony Beads 2) the same thing in Flourecent Orange 3) same thing in Flourecent yellow, 4) all of the above colors in the smaller size, I think its called  5mm or size "E" ( yeah,  ha ha,  I know, I know ) 
Drop me a line off list if you want to unload some beads.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr)Re: [sfraves] Brian Behlendorf in Salon...

you sound like you've done some good research on the
subject.  i don't have a subscription to salon so i
won't be able to see the rest of your letter.  i agree
that education is the key to helping solve the "third
world" issue.  well, it is the second step.  however,
democracy should be there first and it should be
backed up my a similar moral code like we have in the
west.  

i know that sounds snooty.  who are we to tell what
morals are?  we aren't and i don't want to begin to,
however, how can you explain that america is the
strongest, most powerful, and rich country in the
world when we aren't the biggest and most educated?  

look at india.  they are the largest democracy in the
world.  they have enough people that received formal
education to compete with the US however their
literacy rate isn't that great.  yet out economy is 5
times bigger than theirs.  

people with similar belief systems get along better. 
the west tends to stick together and if you look at
india's system of government (a british style
democracy) along with who their largest trading
partners are you see there is a connection.  india's
economy is driven in part by the UK/US machine.  but
then look at china, their greatest gift is cheap labor
that is exploited by every country in the world.  in
the news, we put down china for human rights issues
but maybe china has a legitimate reason for cracking
down on falun gong.  we can easily look at china and
creat a demon because we don't understand them or
think like them.  the lack of understanding of other
cultures or the lack of similarity between cultures
can be a trade barrier as well.  IMO, multiculturalsim
or trans-national progressivism won't work.  i can
accept the fact that every human has certain basic
human rights.. that's a no brainer.  but if i don't
understand you, your laws, your beliefs, i'll go the
path of least resistance and sign a contract with
someone safer.  

this would be a basic building block of helping other
countries to grow more rapidly without having to
outsource from america/the west.  if you need a
working case study to drive this point home, look at
any surviving communist country or most middle eastern
countries and compare them to your average western
style economy.

hi, this is geri dahl from sfraves, and i just wanted to take a minute out of your day to remind you to try new 
and improved coast deoderant soap.  coast has a clean refreshing scent but is mild on those hard to reach 
areas and it's also in a way cool package.  so remember, try coast.

Some people promote hype...
Very rarely do people promote truth...

Question...What are you promoting?

is there any truth left in our scene?

-> -> -> CFDC- emerging fashion FRESH from the underground!

The Cloud Factory Design Collective (CFDC) is comprised of an inventive
group of up-and-coming designers, burning with vision, talent, and
creative energy.  With roots in the Bay Area underground dance culture,
the CFDC molds a post-rave fashion experience, at once heady and
whimsical, yet rooted in a disciplined expression of hard-earned
street-learned skills.

The collective creates, arranges, produces, and
performs its work, with one major annual spring show held over the last
five years. With a belief that real style is art, and art is life- a CFDC
performance is a visual, aural, and sensory treat that marries fashion to
theater, dance, and music.  The Cloud Factory Design Collective originates
and disperses fashion into the hands of the young, the fun, the real, the
good, and the true.

well, with that in mind, i suppose one could do 
worse than to promote soap...

although, one does wonder about the sanity of 
promoting soap on a rave list.

Why Are there so many great events going on this week starting Wednesday? 
Why are there three things on Wednesday that I should go to, but I am already commited to go to the one that will probably do the least for my career but I can't not go because what if it is actualy the best one? Not that I'm complaining about having three great opportunities, BUT WHY OH WHY are they all at the same time on the same night? It's like the weekend before last all over again! The weekend looks even more packed! 
 
ps.
Ok, i am the last purs0n in the wurld to critsise speling, butt it's "NITpicking", kn0t "KNITpicking" I m a knitter and u hav insulted mi! n0w i m nitpicking! ;P

Hey folks,
 
I was wondering if any of you knew somebody who does flyers.  I'm
looking for someone to design it using their creative talent and the
information I provide, plus I need costs on how much it will cost for
certain sizes.  If anybody knows of one, please let me know.
 
Thanks!

do you have a weakness for burgers?  

i do.  

my name's osby, and i'm from sfraves, and i'd like to remind you to use Omaha steaks the next time you 
want to have a barbeque with some home cooked burgers.  they have a fresh juicy taste and are great for 
any family budget.  remember, that's Omaha steaks.

How could you not like breaks????????????
I mean, almost every form of music uses one at some point or another.
Besides, I think you have to add yourself to this list smart guy, so guess what-- you're going to have to take yourself off!

ok I was peeping there page and I had to big up this wed night party..

Look who is on the lineup for $5-7 whatever the going rate is for qool these

What other party can you see Jerry and Ashley at the same time for like $7 
bones???   if you like prog or are just "Prog curious" then you need to get 
your bootay on down to this shindig!


PS: I am in NO WAY affiliated with Jondi,Spesh or the qool crew.. Just have

Don't waste your time or money.

Noone should go.

Casselle is an amateur who plays hard rock and country music.

And he doesn't bathe.

Stay home. No crowds please.

Oh look. DJ fuckhead Seven is playing there. I should go just so I can jump
him at the decks and make him swear not to spam anymore. Qool is cool. Maybe
I'll drop by after the gym tonight.

ok I was peeping there page and I had to big up this wed night party..

Look who is on the lineup for $5-7 whatever the going rate is for qool these
days.. Still very well worth the price for all that prog talent.

What other party can you see Jerry and Ashley at the same time for like $7
bones???   if you like prog or are just "Prog curious" then you need to get
your bootay on down to this shindig!


PS: I am in NO WAY affiliated with Jondi,Spesh or the qool crew.. Just have
to big up a good party when I see it.

I haven't gone to Qool in ages, but having just noticed that, i might 
have to make the trip up to the city tonight. You think they'll be 
searching for aluminum baseball bats at the door? ;)

Hmmm, I'm not sure how violent they allow their guests! ;-)

As an aside, some bad news on the Ashley Casselle tip:

"He was unable to get his work visa from the us embassy in time
to make the last connecting flight over here. He will for sure
be back in the future, and promises to throw down something
sööper special for the qoolios then. At least tonight we get 
to be treated by an extended set by Jerry."


  :-(  Sorry guys! Take care...(and still see you tonite?)

sorry, but we discontinued that model many, many moons ago in what was a burst of, uh, growing up. "it" just wasn't very cost effective to maintain in the midst of the excuse of youth. time is very valuable, you understand. thank you. :)

Canada to Sell Medical Marijuana to Seriously Ill

Wed July 9, 2003 01:52 PM ET
By David Ljunggren

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada became on Wednesday the first country in the 
world to start selling marijuana to several hundred seriously ill people 
but said the pot project could be halted at any time.

Ottawa announced in July 2001 that some patients would be able to use 
marijuana provided by the government. But plans to grow official pot hit a 
series of snags, prompting a court in Ontario to give Ottawa until July 10 
to come up with a solution.

The new plan is Ottawa's response to that ruling. Federal officials said 
more research into the claimed benefits of medical pot was needed and they 
would therefore appeal the court ruling, a decision that angered critics.

"My first obligation is to ensure the safety and efficacy of this product. 
Marijuana is not a proven therapeutic product," said Health Minister Anne 
McLellan.

"I remain committed to (Ottawa's) medical marijuana research program, which 
promotes research on the medical value of marijuana while taking a 
compassionate approach to Canadians who suffer from serious medical 
conditions."

The 582 sufferers granted dispensation from criminal laws to use the drug 
will be able to buy dried marijuana for $3.70 per 0.04 ounce -- about half 
the current black-market rate -- or a pack of 30 seeds for $20 so they can 
grow their own plants.

"Although this interim policy can be amended or suspended at any time, it 
is anticipated that it will remain in effect until...(Ottawa's) roles and 
responsibilities with respect to a supply of marijuana for medical purposes 
have been clarified by the courts," the health ministry said in a statement.

McLellan said despite the planned appeal, Ottawa would press ahead with 
clinical trials to probe whether marijuana could really benefit the ill.

The drug -- grown in a special federal facility in a mine shaft in central 
Canada -- will be given to patients by their doctors. Officials recommend 
that patients do not smoke pot but rather put it in food, drinks or use 
other methods.

Alison Myrden, who has multiple sclerosis, a disorder of the brain and 
spinal cord, took part in a demonstration in Ottawa and condemned the 
government for appealing the court ruling.

"This country has to act now...nobody wants us to play this political 
football game any more. People are suffering and dying out there," she said.

Canada's approach is markedly different to that of the United States, where 
the Supreme Court in 2001 upheld a federal ban on medical marijuana.

U.S. authorities have strongly criticized Canadian plans to decriminalize 
the possession of small amounts of marijuana, arguing it could result in 
highly potent pot flooding across the border.

Much the same way you'd feel when your pre-teen came home drunk, I
imagine.

I'd hope, with any legalization efforts, there is a minimum age for
consumption. Someone shouldn't be smoking weed at 13 any more than they
should be drinking. It's not good for a developing mind.

Exactly, probably a little ticked.  (And I totally agree with you on the
developing mind, I'm really glad I didn't do anything until I was 18.) If it
were legal it would actually be harder for teens to get.  Right now its
easier for teens to get weed than it is to get alcohol.  With it legal it
would most likely still be illegal to grow your own or monitored in much the
same way that beer supply stores are monitored.  It would be sold in stores
with an 18 or 21+ age limit needed so they'd have to have someone else buy
it for them much the same way alcohol is bought now.  It would be cheaper
than street value (it'd have to be to get rid of illegal sales) and a new
way would have to be developed to tell if you're high right then and there
and incapable of driving instead of any ol' blood test which will show
you've smoked within' the last month.  All in all my guess is that less
teens would actually be smoking it than they do now because of the hassle of
getting it and switch to the next easiest thing to find most likely.
Probably a combination of lung capicty and skill tests.  Or, if its legal
and you're a pothead you'd probably just reek of it ;)

Probably pretty damn upset. There's be a sense of betrayal, a sense
of somehow failing my child. Wondering where they got it. Why? Why?
What do I do?

But, it *does* happen. Kids smoke cigarettes, too, which is much
more harmful. Kids find liquor, too.

So then I think, what happens a while down the line?

Down the line people will be more familiar with it. Rather than
*DRUGS*, will it be more like cigarettes or liquor, familiar and
off-limits, but not dramatically stigmatized?

What happens when the horror reaction to MJ as *drugs* wears off?

Subject: [sfraves] Square Root of America

--part1_1e0.d00af26.2c3e42ee_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

So when it boils down to it, the real root of the two sides of America at 
their most extream measures. You have one thereoy I would like to call the 
"Imagine" theorey based on the lyrics of the song of course. Proposing that people 
can govern themselves because every human being is good deep down within their 
hearts. Proposing that perhaps we (heaven forbid) forfiet our military and 
that out of this kind gesture the rest of the world would leave us in peace and 
possibly become peacefull themselves. Suppose we deactivated all of our own 
nuclear weapons first, then asked other nations to do the same? Would waring 
nations just say "haha you naive fools! muhahhahah" and proceed to bomb us after 
our peaceful gesture? Taking over our land killing and raping us all? 
And then you have the other thereoy which states the fact "Thank god for US 
military or we'd all be nazi's by now" pointing out that, in fact America saved 
the entire world from Hitler. Learning from our mistake of not taking him out 
sooner, we now search and destroy all potential "Hitlers" by being bigger and 
badder than them. 
I mean we are forturnate to truely be the most powerful nation in the current 
global waring networks, nobody is arguing with that, but how do we use this 
power? Can we really expect other nations to just get rid of their nuclear 
weapons just because we tell them to, in the meantime while we have more nuclear 
weapons than anyone else? It seems we only trust ourselves because we know that 
America is good at heart and means well and good and is globally moral, while 
other nations who have nuclear weapons aren't to be trusted. but who is it to 
judge that? 
If we chose the "Imagine" theroey stoped funding for weapons and military 
equipment, spent that money on environmental issues and our ecconomy for building 
jobs for jobless and houseing the homeless. Would then, terrorist still die 
to attack us? perhaps terrorist attack us for a reason, because they see our 
spending as selfish they see our power and intimidating and unfair. Does that 
make terrorism ok?   no of course not but you do have to unstand that terrorist 
isn't just madmen, it's people who have taken extream measures agaist our 
ways. They believe in it so fiercly that they die for it. Our growing military 
makes us more vulnarable to these attacks because it gives them incentive, motive 
and reason to be agaist us and they can do so convincinb themselve they are 
doing the right thing. If we were a truely inocent giving loving country that 
doesn't focus on self defense perhaps they wouldn't attack us in the first 
place. 
Of course there is a chance we could try to take this so called "Imagine" 
thereoy into effect and it could very well backfire on us supposing that they 
disreguarded our peaceful gestures and decided to bomb us or invade us while our 
guard was down, I think that is the big fear in the back of our minds.... But 
somewhere down the line you have to figure, a world where you make a profound 
peaceful gesture and in result get shot for your effort is a not a world worth 
living in. On the other hand you have to wonder "what if"... what if we used 
all our nuclear weapons for energy... what if north korea and iraq folled in 
our path. Are we gonna set an example? or are we just gonna implement "Do as i 
say not as i do" to the rest of the world??? What if...

Mars has a studio in LA so he's selling most of the equipment he doesn't
need.  Below is a list of links so far that i've put on ebay.  Everything

Hhaah- yeah, I agree-

I'll tell my kids whats up, about weed not being the
same as meth and stuff- but I'll specifically tell
them not to do that at school when they need to be
learning.

Well IF it was legal, it should be 18 if not 21 and over.
and if my son came home drunk, high or whatever before the age of 18 i would surly chase him around the house and kick his ass.  Anything after 18 is his problem, but good guidance helps.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] paging dj seven

It doesnt seem like we get multiple postings from DJ seven any longer, so 
maybe he is making an effort to be accomodating?  Maybe not.  If I was 
trying to be accomodating, I would at least let the board know.  Like 
Coolworld, its hard to hate them because for every snide comment directed 
toward them, there is a personal response explaining how they could possibly 
make it better.

something to consider: do you want a relationship that is based purely on signs? you can have one at anytime, because signs are something that are pretty much based on your imagination...relationships are based on trust...do trust and signs go hand in hand? i don't know. maybe if your partner is constantly yawning and is totally honest, then yes, she is in fact tired...bars are places where people go to hear music sometimes, especially when there is music playing that has been formally announced and everything. people need to believe what they need to believe to get by. i suppose that life is tedious for some without the extra stuff. filters aren't just for computers and programmers did not invent the idea of filtering. football fans have been filtering out their loved-ones in the easy chairs for decades. dream on. :)

I was the one planning on packing my Louisville Slugger. Alas, I just 
got my first wave of NetFlix DVDs and ended up staying home to watch 
them.  This renting-by-internet thing has rendered me pretty much 
useless.  (Then again, some would argue that this isn't much of a 
change!)

Newp. I have to reschedule. I think the tactic will be pulling the record
off and yelling YOU'RE AN ASS SPAMMER BOY! Either that or try to steal his
record bag and threaten to pour a can of redbull over all his records.
Imagine the sticky mess that would be to clean up? All the same - harmless.
Just has to wash his shit later. =)

Alas I was po like Kenny after buying a new PowerBook so I didn't head into
SF.

Did innocentchild take to him with a baseball bat in the middle of his

Anyone else hear word round the campfire about RIAA shutting down Kazaa =
and others and then file lawsuit(s) to have the companies release their =
user lists? Remember, RIAA sued Verizon to just get ONE username.=20

http://news.com.com/2100-1029-1023735.html - this is all I have found so =
far...

yes, I know I am one in 60,000,000 who use the software, but, I don't =
want to be the one who RIAA decides to f**k with. Just seeing what =
y'alls opinions are...

Where the hell am I supposed to get decent 'stuff' now ;) ?

Being a Mac user means I use less-targeted P2P and file-sharing 
clients, so I think my chances are even lower of being dragged in by 
the DAs on the RIAA's payroll. However, part of me kind of wishes they 
would. Oooh, how I'd love to call a big-name bloodsucker.. er.. 
attorney, alert all the media, and show how the music industry is going 
against one of its best customers. I'd produce thousands of dollars of 
receipts (which I've kept) and show that even though I do download 
music, I buy more than their demographically "best" customers combined.

There was somebody on Slashdot or somewhere similar that said something 
along the lines of "They think that by suing us, we'll buy more 
records?"  That's the non-sensical scare tactic behind all this.  If 
they come and bust people like me (and I'm sure hundreds of others on 
this list who blow most of their income on records, CDs, etc.) then 
they'll really be asking for the worst PR possible.

So as our fearless leader has so eloquently said..  "Bring 'em on."  
Bitches.

Ahh the days of private ftp servers will once again rule. The days of ratio
downloads where you HAD to contribute to download will be back enfore. I
dunno about you but all the user info in Kazaa is complete BS. I personally
wouldn't stress over it. Did you read the article about Kazaa and how it's
setup? It's not located in any *one* place. The places that it is located in
and how it's run have all this privacy *fuck you america* policies in place.
It was really rather clever. The woman that functionally acts as head of
Kazaa won't step foot in our country because if she does then they can come
after her. The article is from a few months back. If you can find it, then
read it. I'll be curious to see how jurisdiction works with Kazaa because
from what I read the US can't do dick nor can RIAA.

Kind of like having your site hosted at Haven Co in Sealand...

people downloading music hasn't significantly reduced record 
sales.  i think that what the RIAA is really afraid of is having 
lost their near monopoly on exposure.  having the fewest musicians 
making the most amount of money for them has been the business 
strategy of many major labels.  in order for that to work, 
*everyone* has to be hearing the big hits put out by the major 
labels alone.  no one in that business considered indie labels to 
be a threat until mp3s came on the scene.  what scares these 
people is not having as much control over what we listen to.

about a year ago the RIAA paid a lot of money for a study to be 
done on whether or not internet music piracy could be effectively 
stopped.  mind you the study wasn't on HOW, but on whether or not 
it's possible.  the results -- well, i can only guess that it 
suggested that it's unstoppable because the results were promptly 
supressed.

I can't find the full Wired article that goes in depth (I have it in 
print), but here's a taste from the online edition.

Actually, the deal is that the RIAA has been unable to shut down Kazaa
et al, and is now resorting to litigation against individual users. At
one point, they were lobbying for legislation that would allow them to
DOS (or worse) people they suspected of sharing copyrighted works, but
that didn't make it very far. :) Then, of course, was Orin Hatch's
recommendation that they be given the technology to physically destroy
copyright violators' machines... *sigh*

Your chances are pretty slim, but from what I hear they're just
targetting the big "dealers" -- people offering up lots of stuff for
download. If you're just downloading, you're probably in the clear. Of
course, the general consensus is that the whole thing's just a scare
tactic.

> Where the hell am I supposed to get decent 'stuff' now ;) ?

C'mon, could you *ever* really get anything decent from a filesharing
network? I gave up on that shit before Napster bit the dust... low-
bitrate, incomplete, poorly labeled crap, the lot of it. And to top it
all off, the people with the good "stuff" were either on dialup (so your
transfers were slow as all hell), or PPPoE connections (so they lost
their dynamic IP's all the time).

Trying to find music (or anything else, for that matter) on P2P networks
is an unreliable, unbelievably time-consuming exercise that I'd just
rather not bother with anymore... YMMV, of course. ;)

And regarding Soulseek... I've heard good things, alas, I was unable to
find a Mac client last time I looked. But we've got the iTunes Music
Store, so neh neh neh neh :P

amen!  you hit the nail on the head.  it was so long ago, no one in the world
remembers the time when the music industry WASN'T controlled by multi-million dollar
monopolies.  the fact is, the music industry will ALWAYS thrive because music is so
important to our human nature.  what's really in peril is the record labels' iron
grip over what we should listen to, think, wear, speak, etc.  and i for one am
looking forward to the day when record labels lose their ability to create superstar
artists on the wing of a marketing department.  because when that day comes, all
artists will be indie artists and maybe it will actually be viable to make your
living as one when you don't have to compete against Britney Spears and Justin
Timberlake.

Yeah, I do gotta give them credit on that one.  Whoever they employ to monitor
and post to SFRaves is sure dedicated to his job.  He/she finds the smallest
criticism, even in threads that aren't specific to coolworld, and is quick to
try to spin things around to make it look like coolworld is an honest,
intimate, friendly promoter that's a positive and integral part of the local
scene, instead of a greedy and exploitave out of town corporation that throws
massives.

And talk about turnaround time.  This guy's on the ball.  Last week, when I
posted a (admittedly, kinda snide and trollish) remark on the cyberfest flyers
thread, as to wether or not coolworld was actually going to DELIVER all the
talent they promise this time around; it was less than thirty minutes before I
got a reply pointing out that: "all headliners for PNY03 were at the Cow Palace
and on time".

Of course, said reply didn't mention the talent that weren't "headliners".  And
it didn't mention LAST year's cyberfest, and Richard Humpty Vision and Donald
Glaude; whom they promised on their flyers, but didn't deliver.  Nor did they
mention eminem and his D12 "supergroup" which they promised at some party or
another, but "kicked off the lineup".

It's wierd as hell dealing with people who have actually "drank the Kool-Aid",
so to speak.  PR drones are just something else.  The engineer and cynic in me
just screrams "bullshit" at most of what comes out of them.  But they just seem
to believe it like the gospel.  If the corporation says it's so, then it's so. 
And any attempt to question or challange them is just beyond their
comprehension.  When I get caught in exchanges like this:

(Regarding DanceSafe)

coolworld drone:  "The organization you belong to is illegal.  What you do is
illegal.  You are a criminal."

me:  "Then why have both the district attorney, and a lawyer I once retained
myself, said otherwise?"

coolworld drone:  "The district attorney is irrelevant.  Your lawyer is
irrelevant.  The law is irrelevant.  The organization you belong to is illegal.
 What you do is illegal.  You are a criminal.  Your biological and
technological distinctiveness will be added to our own.  You will adapt to
service us.  Resistance is futile."

... it really does make me wonder if there *IS* an actual human being at the
other end, or not.


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Dried peppers.

Okay... this is not even REMOTELY rave related.  And I'm sorry.  But SFRaves is
the largest cross-section of people scattered throughout the whole of The Bay
Area that I know.  And I was hoping someone would know the answer.

So, you know those little crushed red pepper flakes you get in shakers at pizza
places?  Well, back in Florida, there used to be this place that had the same
kind of crushed and dried pepper flakes... but with habanero peppers instead of
the tamer red peppers.

Well, I used to get regularly resupplied in care packages from my mom.  But the
place we used to get them closed down, neither of us has found a new source,
and after streaching out my stockpile as long as I could, I'm out.

So does anyone know where I can get those little shaker jars, but with habanero
flakes instead of regular peppers???

Thanks bunches, and I'm sorry about such a horrible NRR.


cya,
john

Read your own reply...Yep.

Yep, and Nope.

Depend's on what you're trying to do.

Taco Bell analogy:

A. I'm ordering 2 taco's: they come out butt-crappy.
 1. Complain to the cashier/drone, get an apology
 2. Complain to the manager/drone, get 2 replacement tacos

Result: Tacos are still crappy

B. I'm ordering 2 taco's: they come out butt-crappy.
 1. Complain to Customer Relations/drone, receive apology
 2. Also receive coupons for more crappy Taco Bell

Result: A few bucks richer, but tacos are still crappy

C.I'm ordering 2 taco's: they come out butt-crappy. Abandon
establishment, make own tacos.
 1. Figure out how to make good taco
 2. Make good taco, Invite friends
 3. Everyone experiences good taco (on a small scale)

Result: Good Tacos, Good Friends

The problem is...?

Granted, this is a simplistic solution, but <spin aside>, can you expect
massives to acknowledge and embrace harm-reduction with what's on their
public plate w/ current threatening legislation?

Tell 'em to take out Trans-fats while you're at it...or just work to
replace the tacos.

 -t

p.s. Sorry for the analogy, it's late, and I'm hungry =)

I have really enjoyed Apples iTunes music store... except that it lacks
any decent dance music.  I looked all over the net for a legal way 
to download all 7 Om Lounge compilations... but there was none.  So,
I bought the 7 CDs instead.  I am going to rip them, then give them
away to my friends, since I have no use for that landfill-fodder after
I rip it.  All my music listening is done off .mp3 now.

Putting music on big chunks of plastic is just so wrong now that we
have the techonogy of the Internet.

At one point this was true.  But this has definitely changed.  Between
economic factors and file sharing they have started seeing huge
decreases in record sales.  Doesn't make me like them anymore but they
really have started feeling the hurt (if millions in profit can be
considered the hurt).  On a side note though, indie labels that have
been around forever have had to start hiring employees because their
record sales have never been higher.

people downloading music hasn't significantly reduced record 
sales.  i think that what the RIAA is really afraid of is having 
lost their near monopoly on exposure.  having the fewest musicians 
making the most amount of money for them has been the business 
strategy of many major labels.  in order for that to work, 
*everyone* has to be hearing the big hits put out by the major 
labels alone.  no one in that business considered indie labels to 
be a threat until mp3s came on the scene.  what scares these 
people is not having as much control over what we listen to.

about a year ago the RIAA paid a lot of money for a study to be 
done on whether or not internet music piracy could be effectively 
stopped.  mind you the study wasn't on HOW, but on whether or not 
it's possible.  the results -- well, i can only guess that it 
suggested that it's unstoppable because the results were promptly 
supressed.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] paging dj seven

Not to try and redeem coolworld and the problems they've had over the
years.  Eminem and D12 had made themselves publicly violent at a show
about a week or two before Cyberfest.  Coolworld wasn't the only one to
drop them from the bill after that.  As much as I would've loved to see
Eminem, I can't fault them for not wanting violence at their event.  And
this is from a dude who was stranded in Fresno because our bus drivers
were asleep and the cops shut the event down early.

Another funny thing that I mentioned to Fable offline earlier is that
ever since they posted the teaser with Kraftwerk and Heiroglyphics as
the headliners, I haven't seen one word of criticism. ;)  Unless I was
dunk and hit delete on replies to it.  All in all I have had as much fun
at coolworld events as I have had at school dances.  Can be kinda fun
but overall you'd much rather be somewhere with a more intimate vibe,
some good locals and actually go all night.

I wasn't going to go, but no way in hell am I going to miss Kraftwerk.

Yeah, I do gotta give them credit on that one.  Whoever they employ to
monitor and post to SFRaves is sure dedicated to his job.  He/she finds
the smallest criticism, even in threads that aren't specific to
coolworld, and is quick to try to spin things around to make it look
like coolworld is an honest, intimate, friendly promoter that's a
positive and integral part of the local scene, instead of a greedy and
exploitave out of town corporation that throws massives.

And talk about turnaround time.  This guy's on the ball.  Last week,
when I posted a (admittedly, kinda snide and trollish) remark on the
cyberfest flyers thread, as to wether or not coolworld was actually
going to DELIVER all the talent they promise this time around; it was
less than thirty minutes before I got a reply pointing out that: "all
headliners for PNY03 were at the Cow Palace and on time".

Of course, said reply didn't mention the talent that weren't
"headliners".  And it didn't mention LAST year's cyberfest, and Richard
Humpty Vision and Donald Glaude; whom they promised on their flyers, but
didn't deliver.  Nor did they mention eminem and his D12 "supergroup"
which they promised at some party or another, but "kicked off the
lineup".

It's wierd as hell dealing with people who have actually "drank the
Kool-Aid", so to speak.  PR drones are just something else.  The
engineer and cynic in me just screrams "bullshit" at most of what comes
out of them.  But they just seem to believe it like the gospel.  If the
corporation says it's so, then it's so. 
And any attempt to question or challange them is just beyond their
comprehension.  When I get caught in exchanges like this:

(Regarding DanceSafe)

coolworld drone:  "The organization you belong to is illegal.  What you
do is illegal.  You are a criminal."

me:  "Then why have both the district attorney, and a lawyer I once
retained myself, said otherwise?"

coolworld drone:  "The district attorney is irrelevant.  Your lawyer is
irrelevant.  The law is irrelevant.  The organization you belong to is
illegal.  What you do is illegal.  You are a criminal.  Your biological
and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own.  You will
adapt to service us.  Resistance is futile."

... it really does make me wonder if there *IS* an actual human being at
the other end, or not.


cya,
john

right on.  i love what neurological studies have shown about our 
reaction to music.  music is unique in that it simulataneously 
stimulates all parts of our brains.  it's not like, oh the 
amygdola for fear and religion, the left hemisphere for language, 
etc... music gets us using everything at once.

CoolWorld and Cyberfest type events are not *raves* nor are they *parties*
anymore. It's a concert now. A lollapalooza of the dance music variety. The
same can be said about the Skills parties now with the slight difference
that Skills attracts a more foo foo crowd due to bookings//history. All the
same they're both dance music festivals that share more in common with a
Live105 BFD than a *rave* or *party*  now. If you go to one of these with
the mindset that you're going to a concert to see a few acts I bet you will
walk away with a better feeling about the event. When I think about the last
BFD I went to in 2000 with all of the kids running around, the 21+ crowd
getting trashed at the bars, and the masses of people in general it sounds
just like a massive. Biggest differencence? Your typical concerts aren't
having laws passed to ban them...

Not to try and redeem coolworld and the problems they've had over the
years.  Eminem and D12 had made themselves publicly violent at a show
about a week or two before Cyberfest.  Coolworld wasn't the only one to
drop them from the bill after that.  As much as I would've loved to see
Eminem, I can't fault them for not wanting violence at their event.  And
this is from a dude who was stranded in Fresno because our bus drivers
were asleep and the cops shut the event down early.

Another funny thing that I mentioned to Fable offline earlier is that
ever since they posted the teaser with Kraftwerk and Heiroglyphics as
the headliners, I haven't seen one word of criticism. ;)  Unless I was
dunk and hit delete on replies to it.  All in all I have had as much fun
at coolworld events as I have had at school dances.  Can be kinda fun
but overall you'd much rather be somewhere with a more intimate vibe,
some good locals and actually go all night.

I wasn't going to go, but no way in hell am I going to miss Kraftwerk.

Yeah, I do gotta give them credit on that one.  Whoever they employ to
monitor and post to SFRaves is sure dedicated to his job.  He/she finds
the smallest criticism, even in threads that aren't specific to
coolworld, and is quick to try to spin things around to make it look
like coolworld is an honest, intimate, friendly promoter that's a
positive and integral part of the local scene, instead of a greedy and
exploitave out of town corporation that throws massives.

And talk about turnaround time.  This guy's on the ball.  Last week,
when I posted a (admittedly, kinda snide and trollish) remark on the
cyberfest flyers thread, as to wether or not coolworld was actually
going to DELIVER all the talent they promise this time around; it was
less than thirty minutes before I got a reply pointing out that: "all
headliners for PNY03 were at the Cow Palace and on time".

Of course, said reply didn't mention the talent that weren't
"headliners".  And it didn't mention LAST year's cyberfest, and Richard
Humpty Vision and Donald Glaude; whom they promised on their flyers, but
didn't deliver.  Nor did they mention eminem and his D12 "supergroup"
which they promised at some party or another, but "kicked off the
lineup".

It's wierd as hell dealing with people who have actually "drank the
Kool-Aid", so to speak.  PR drones are just something else.  The
engineer and cynic in me just screrams "bullshit" at most of what comes
out of them.  But they just seem to believe it like the gospel.  If the
corporation says it's so, then it's so.
And any attempt to question or challange them is just beyond their
comprehension.  When I get caught in exchanges like this:

(Regarding DanceSafe)

coolworld drone:  "The organization you belong to is illegal.  What you
do is illegal.  You are a criminal."

me:  "Then why have both the district attorney, and a lawyer I once
retained myself, said otherwise?"

coolworld drone:  "The district attorney is irrelevant.  Your lawyer is
irrelevant.  The law is irrelevant.  The organization you belong to is
illegal.  What you do is illegal.  You are a criminal.  Your biological
and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own.  You will
adapt to service us.  Resistance is futile."

... it really does make me wonder if there *IS* an actual human being at
the other end, or not.


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] bsp:  Choco LIVE on 103.3 KSCU FM Tonight!

Hey folks,

Tune in tonight!  KSCU (Santa Clara University) 103.3 FM will be having me 
as a guest DJ on the "Electrossential Mix Show" tonight, on Saturday July 
12, 2003 at aprroximately 3:45 a.m. (yes, early in the morning).  I will be 
playing a non-stop 45-50 minute trance/breaks set.  I will also be debuting 
a personal production that I had finished recently entitled "Polaris!" 
(trance).

I also have a small time happening this Friday night at a teahouse in 
Cupertino.  Check the flyer i made here:  http://www.prolificdjs.com/fan.jpg 
  There, I will be handing out my new demo mix, "Tears of a Memory."  As of 
MP3 downloads, my crew's in the process of reconstructing the technical 
stuff behind it while I take over the layout.  So, when that's all done, 
media should be available for download.

Peace.

Paul

hi, my name's deepfog, and i'm a whiney little short fat kid from san francisco who freaks out every couple 
of years and tells all his friends to go away (well this time i did that *and* went away myself.)  also i want to 
do all kinds of cool stuff with my life like write, be a big fat dj and produce movies, but i never want to take 
any of the steps toward them.  all i want to do is eat too much, drink beer in my car, and play video games.  
sound familiar?  well, no, i thought not.  i'm the only one like that.  character flaw, i guess.  

anyway, i'm here to tell you to switch to sprint pcs cellular phones.  why?  because claire is foxy (and she 
doesn't really exist.)  once again, that's sprint pcs.

remember: most all pregnancies are planned by both parties involved. i hate it when i see one party blaming the other for the perfect child. screw those people. also, i hate it when someone who is having a ton of problems, but also, holds promise to be a good friend at some point, acts totally irrationally, so that when you avoid the hell out of them, they accuse you of following them, and when you stay away, because they really want you to, then they are mad at you for not helping out or participating. screw those people too. screw you too. good and hard. screw you and your family. j/k. for reals, i don't want to evoke any emotions..good or bad. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Steve Porter, Jefferson Starship, Pink Floyd????

ok, so i saw this listed on ravelinks today and it sounded mighty 
interesting...strange, but interesting:

"July 12 (Saturday) - The Space-Time Continuum Concert

Featuring Steve Porter (DJ) performing a live Dj-band set with THe Jefferson 
Starship.Ê Steve Porter and THe Jefferson Starship will also perform their 
own sets.Ê Plus The Machine "the worlds greatest PINK FLOYD show. The 
machine - 8:00PM, The Jefferson Starship - 10:00PM, Dj Steve Porter - 
12:00AM. Located @ The Avalon Ballroom, 1268 Sutter Street, San Fransisco, 
CA. ÊInfoline 888.339.4400"

but then i checked steve porter's site and it says he'll be in LA on 
saturday.

but it's also listed on groovetickets here:

http://www.groovetickets.com/bz_art_new.asp?DID=384


anyone know anything about this?  seems like a mighty odd combination of 
talents, yet, i'm strangely curious....

Actually, Ryan, the only event that has been shut down so far because of the
IDAPA/RAVE act was a concert (the NORML benefit at the Eagle's Lodge in
Billings, Montana) and not a rave.

I think the larger point here is that there's nothing transcendentally
special about events where electronic/dance music is played; a massive
40,000 person event will be less intimate than a 500 person gathering
regardless of what type of music is coming over the speakers.

Uh yeah right - but what scene spawned that hideous law? I'll give you a
hint - the bill has the name of the scene in it. Actually the point of this
thread is that you can't compare a giant concert//massive to a *rave* or
*party*  They aren't the same and aren't meant to be something intimate and
special. You don't go to an Ozzfest to get intimate with people there
because it's a concert. Well, actually if you're in the pit I bet that's
pretty damn initimate. =)

Two different beasts that can't be compared on the same ground.

( ; The solution for the big labels might be to bring back vinyl. Outlaw
CD's and CD players and only sell their crap on vinyl. : )

Some people might opine that flooding the market with crappy swill from
untalented 'musicians' would be the reason for loss of sales.
The music market could possibly be too complex for a corporate boardroom
committee. They just might not be quick enough to keep up with a
multi-headed hungry monster. The committee didn't even know, Long ago, that
monster moved on.
So turn to examine the rise of Hip Hop.
Once again the black man reshapes, refines and redefines music for the stale
white crackers. Give me your soul and your culture and I will give you the
choicest crumbs. You can be my house nigger in heaven, Jimmy Jam. Trust me.

On 24th street  at Florida is a 'Mexicatesson' called la palma.
They have the most authentic menu in town. It is possible to buy freshly
made (Hecho en Mano) tortillas with a pint of your favorite fillings,
refritos, arroz, chile Colorado.  And have a rich culture filled Mexican
picnic.
None of that  chintzi Cuban stuff though.
Real soul food for real caballero's

Oh and I asked about Habanero peperrs and the senorita said that stuff is
for fattening Gator bait. Not good for food.  ; )
Just kidding.
They have freshly ground red pepper for about a $1 a pound. It will do till
you find a gator bait shop. (ooops racial slur , my bad)

On OSX, getting the latest python (and other linux stuff) going on is 
relatively easy...

download and install the developer tools, after a free signup at apple:

http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/

then go over to the fink project, and get that going:

http://fink.sourceforge.net/

then you can use fink to update python if needed, and get whatever other 
packages you're interested in that they've ported...

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: California Court of Appeal Decides "All Night Rave Parties Not Inherently Dangerous"


While not an antidote to the current Anti-rave
legislation at the federal level, this opinion does
show that the California Courts have some common
sense.  It also might have some positive effect on
property owners who are concerned about 'liability'
for providing spaces:

NJURY AND TORT LAW
SAKIYAMA v. AMF BOWLING CENTERS, INC., No B151800
(Cal. 2d App. Dist.
July 10, 2003)
In an action arising out of injuries occuring after a
"rave" party at
defendant's facilities, the trial court properly
granted defendant
summary judgment because 1) all night rave parties are
not inherently
dangerous, and 2) defendanthad no duty to prevent its
facility from use
for such a party, even if it knew or could assume that
drugs would be
used by some of the attendees.

To read the full text of this opinion, go to:

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Looking for a roommate...

Hi guys!

I am currently looking for someone to move in to the
Fillmore center with me. I'd like to get a 2bed/2bath
and their apartments are sweet! Most have
washers/dryers, dishwashers, garbage disposals, and
your own bathroom in your bedroom. You can check out
their apts. here www.the fillmorecenter.info. I am
currently living there in another apartment but my
roommate and I have chosen to go separate ways. I am
very laid back and positive, like to have fun, 420
friendly ;), and do like to keep our common areas
neat. I'm looking for someone similar. I have 2 cats
who mostly stay in my room and are very friendly and
don't terrorize the house. :) I am also starting to dj
so I have 2 tables and a mixer that you can share with
me if you are careful and take good care of them.
Email me back to my email, not the list, if you are
interested. Thanks!

love & light~

Thats why you gotta love SFRAVES...someone pages a dj and the next thing you know were talking about massives vs. undergrounds, past Coolworld Events, and Coolworld Public relations. 

For starters, Rayn...your pretty much on the money. After Eminem and D12 decided to rumble in the Bronx, we really didnt have a choice but to cut them from the show. With law enforcement factors, etc...are hands were pretty much tied.

Yes, last years Cyberfest had some issues with some of our artist, but not with malice or ill intent. John almost makes it sound like we wanted are artist not to perform, or that we had some other agenda in having artist not play? What would we stand to gain from that, but some criticism on list like SFR as we've now seen.

It really doesn't add up John? We've been in business in the bay area for 13 years. We've had countless events where all of our artist played and performed as billed. 

Planet New Year 2003 did in fact feature all artist as advertised and for the most part all artist played as scheduled. 

What I find most interesting though John is your portrayal of myself, cause I don't really feel like you know me enough to be able to determine if i'm a drone, a real person, or an alien.

Fact is john, I probably have partied at some of the same Underground events that you do. We may have even danced side by side? I've helped and assisted countless organizations and continue to host smaller events that some of your friends probably have come too. hey maybe we'll see each other at the Moksha Tribe party?

It's also interesting how you characterize Coolworld, almost as if Coolworld was a large Corporate company with offices inside the Transamerica building? 

Well John, we don't have 50 employees and were not some corporate conglomerate either. Coolworld has gone through so many changes over the last 3 years that there are only two original employees from the old crew.

I've been with Coolworld for 2.5 years now and I oversee operations and marketing. I wouldn't say that I am "quick to try to spin things around to make it look like coolworld is an honest, intimate, friendly promoter that's a positive and integral part of the local scene", more so I would say that I am very passionate about what I do, and what ever has happened in the past with Coolworld is no longer happening now.

Since I am an integral planner and at the nucleus of Coolworld development I help shape and decide the direction of the organization. I can assure you that I have spent countless hours personally turning this organization inside out in an effort to create positive events that not only benefit the community, but are good events with excellent talent and superb music.

As you can see, Kraftwerk is booked for the show....in Addition to the Hieroglyphics....the Metal Heads Tour with Goldie and Storm, Mix Master Mike, and Planet Asia....and this is just the beginning of the line up.

Finally, your perception that Coolworld is a "greedy and exploitive out of town corporation that throws massives" is false. First, non of us are greedy, second were based in Alameda (and all of us who work for Coolworld, grew up here in the bay area), and last were not exploiting anything but are events.

No other scene in any genre fights over big parties vs. smaller parties. You don't see the Hip Hop community talking about how the Rock the Mic Tour is 20,000 people each event. You don't hear rockers complaining about the Ozzfest and how many people they have at there show. Yet, to some of you, it's almost a sin to have an event over 500 people?

I would have to re-utter ryans comments that Coolworld doesn't produce small 500 person shows, we never have. We produce large scale events that I would characterize as a concert festival...much like other festivals that you see today...

theres more then meets the eye john...you just have to dig a little deeper to see it. no harm no foul....I guess you see things one way I see them another. i wish you well either way.

In any case, if you have questions send them my way...I'll be happy to answer them.

years. Eminem and D12 had made themselves publicly violent at a show
about a week or two before Cyberfest. Coolworld wasn't the only one to
drop them from the bill after that. As much as I would've loved to see
Eminem, I can't fault them for not wanting violence at their event. And
this is from a dude who was stranded in Fresno because our bus drivers
were asleep and the cops shut the event down early.

Another funny thing that I mentioned to Fable offline earlier is that
ever since they posted the teaser with Kraftwerk and Heiroglyphics as
the headliners, I haven't seen one word of criticism. ;) Unless I was
dunk and hit delete on replies to it. All in all I have had as much fun
at coolworld events as I have had at school dances. Can be kinda fun
but overall you'd much rather be somewhere with a more intimate vibe,
some good locals and actually go all night.

I wasn't going to go, but no way in hell am I going to miss Kraftwerk.

Yeah, I do gotta give them credit on that one. Whoever they employ to
monitor and post to SFRaves is sure dedicated to his job. He/she finds
the smallest criticism, even in threads that aren't specific to
coolworld, and is quick to try to spin things around to make it look
like coolworld is an honest, intimate, friendly promoter that's a
positive and integral part of the local scene, instead of a greedy and
exploitave out of town corporation that throws massives.

And talk about turnaround time. This guy's on the ball. Last week,
when I posted a (admittedly, kinda snide and trollish) remark on the
cyberfest flyers thread, as to wether or not coolworld was actually
going to DELIVER all the talent they promise this time around; it was
less than thirty minutes before I got a reply pointing out that: "all
headliners for PNY03 were at the Cow Palace and on time".

Of course, said reply didn't mention the talent that weren't
"headliners". And it didn't mention LAST year's cyberfest, and Richard
Humpty Vision and Donald Glaude; whom they promised on their flyers, but
didn't deliver. Nor did they mention eminem and his D12 "supergroup"
which they promised at some party or another, but "kicked off the
lineup".

It's wierd as hell dealing with people who have actually "drank the
Kool-Aid", so to speak. PR drones are just something else. The
engineer and cynic in me just screrams "bullshit" at most of what comes
out of them. But they just seem to believe it like the gospel. If the
corporation says it's so, then it's so. 
And any attempt to question or challange them is just beyond their
comprehension. When I get caught in exchanges like this:

(Regarding DanceSafe)

coolworld drone: "The organization you belong to is illegal. What you
do is illegal. You are a criminal."

me: "Then why have both the district attorney, and a lawyer I once
retained myself, said otherwise?"

coolworld drone: "The district attorney is irrelevant. Your lawyer is
irrelevant. The law is irrelevant. The organization you belong to is
illegal. What you do is illegal. You are a criminal. Your biological
and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. You will
adapt to service us. Resistance is futile."

... it really does make me wonder if there *IS* an actual human being at
the other end, or not.


cya,
john

Without going into details, I'm sure you and I can agree that this isn't

Subject: [sfraves] Digital Mix: A Special BayFF Celebrating Illegal Art

* Digital Mix: A Special BayFF Celebrating Illegal Art

On July 25th the Electronic Frontier Foundation will host a night of music,
art, and conversation to celebrate digital culture.  Hosted at the Black
Box in downtown Oakland, this special BayFF will bring up-and-coming
artists of electronica, digital film, and illegal art together with leaders
from the cyber-rights movement.  Lawsuits and legislation have become the
weapons of choice for dealing with file-sharing and cultural recycling
("sampling"); come out and discover what all the hype is about. Between
laptop music, hip hop, and industrial performances, you will hear from
people who are fighting to protect new forms of expression and cultural
distribution from the attacks of the entertainment industry.  This is an
all-ages event.

How expensive are apartments at the Fillmore center?

I've been on the roommate hunt for a while now. However, I'm a poor-ass
college student. As I'm currently paying about 900 a month to share a
shitty dorm room, a lot is preferable to this. I heard, however, that most
of the apts @ TFC are in the 'luxury' range.

Well, for thge most part, that's what I HAVE done wrt/ coolworld, though I
haven't sucessfully gotten so far as the "make own tacos" step.  I had my bad
experience...

(Yes, I DID, once, actually buy tickets to a coolworld party.  Hey, I was still
pretty new to town, didn't know that many ravers, and hadn't even first signed
on to SFRaves yet.  And I didn't, yet, know or heve experience with the
reputations of the crews that throw parties in the Bay Area.  So I never really
had the chance to be warned off about them at the time.  In fact, it was only
my second ever ATTEMPT at going to a rave in "the Bay Area".  I didn't actually
get to *GO* though.)

... and after getting fucked that once, I decided that they were a company that
would never see a penny from me again.  And this was WELL before I developed my
"small undergrounds over massives" preference.

The problem, though, is that I can't just abandon said establishment and
pretend they don't exist.  Because even *IF* I don't set foot in a coolworld
party ever again, their actions still affect me.

To continue your Taco Bell analogy:

Taco Bell not only serves crappy tacos; they serve notoriously and festeringly
bad tacos.  They don't take health precautions like refrigerateing their sour
cream, and washing and sanitizing their hands before handleing food.  They are
sloppy in handleing their poultry.  And they don't even allow their patrons to
inspect their food before eating it.  This leads to regular instances of food
poisoning at Taco Bell.  In some cases, said food poisoning has been fatal.

This leads the health department (Rightly or wrongly...  wrongly, IMO, but that
doesn't matter.) to conclude that not only Taco Bell tacos, but ALL tacos, and
indeed, all mexican food in general, is evil.  The health department therefore
recruits a pack of gun-toting thugs to rampage down Mission and Valencia
streets, and rough up and harrass the owners and patrons of the small and
independent taquerias where I *DO* get healthy and reliably good tacos all the
time.  This leads to some of these taquerias closeing down, and many of the
rest imposing tedious restrictions on the customers.  For instance, where I
could always bring candy bars as dessert before, to restraunts that didn't
include it on their menu, and I could bring my own hot sauce, to the ones that
didn't serve their food quite spicy enough; niether is allowed anymore.

Not only THAT, but the health department is doing their VERY best to prevent me
from making my own tacos as well...  To the point that, even though I was
planning to try a while back; Safeway, under pressure from the health
department's gun-toting thugs, has pulled taco shells off it's storeshelves,
forcing me to abort my attempt at making tacos of my own before I could even
get out of the store. 

So, despite the fact that I DID abandon Taco Bell, the fact that they serve
butt-crappy tacos (And sometimes send your order to another store, instead of
delivering it to you in the dining room where you ordered.) still AFFECTS me...
in multiple ways.

Now, I'm going to go downstairs, make myself some ramen noodles, and hide from
the bad-analogy police...  'Cuz I just took your ball, and ran with it, Forrest
Gump style, all the way out of the stadium.


cya,
john

Hrmm. I question any place that claims you need a certifcation for 
protools, I know plenty of people who use it on a regular basis and would 
laugh hyserically if you asked them to show you their certification. most 
producers & engineers in the audio industry bearly have degrees it's not 
exactly an industry built on schooling.  a lot pick up more in a studio 
working then they do in school, and before you flame me. I did go to a 
school with a sound program, but they never made claims that you need 
certifcation to work and the teachers all still work in the industry.  a 
good school will teach you more then just protools.

Read your own reply...Yep.

Yep, and Nope.

Depend's on what you're trying to do.

Taco Bell analogy:

A. I'm ordering 2 taco's: they come out butt-crappy.
 1. Complain to the cashier/drone, get an apology
 2. Complain to the manager/drone, get 2 replacement tacos

Result: Tacos are still crappy

B. I'm ordering 2 taco's: they come out butt-crappy.
 1. Complain to Customer Relations/drone, receive apology
 2. Also receive coupons for more crappy Taco Bell

Result: A few bucks richer, but tacos are still crappy

C.I'm ordering 2 taco's: they come out butt-crappy. Abandon
establishment, make own tacos.
 1. Figure out how to make good taco
 2. Make good taco, Invite friends
 3. Everyone experiences good taco (on a small scale)

Result: Good Tacos, Good Friends

The problem is...?

Granted, this is a simplistic solution, but <spin aside>, can you expect
massives to acknowledge and embrace harm-reduction with what's on their
public plate w/ current threatening legislation?

Tell 'em to take out Trans-fats while you're at it...or just work to
replace the tacos.

 -t

p.s. Sorry for the analogy, it's late, and I'm hungry =)

Well, I was looking at some records online and I remember seeing Darkraver 
before some where in cali I am not to sure where he played at but his style is a 
lot like Rob Gee and DJ Gizmo and DJ Buzz Fuzz I was thinking it would be so 
cool if somehow a production crew could book Darkraver and some real hard-core 
DJ's like scooter and hell Cloudskiper is a dope hard-core DJ.

But what about the real hard almost gabber sounding hard-core? Dose anyone 
know how I can find out about partes with hard-core core music?

To place blame for the vilification of mexican food on a single promoter
is short-sighted. Clearly many of us on this list have been to a slew of
taquerias, and I'll bet many have seen lots of "jacked up shit" in many of
them thrown by the entire spectrum of promoters.

Not to bust your bubble or anything, but some of those, healthy and
reliable tacos are some of the most insane death traps I've ever seen.
The problems you are lamenting are not because the biggest, baddest, most
public taquerias are irresponsible fuck-ups, it's because they are the
most visible and easiest to blame.

I think your gun-toting and rampaging thugs retalition argument is
paranoic. Speaking for myself, I've pretty much been to a whole host of
very good, safe, and unbusted fiestas this year. IMHO, it has become
*easier* to throw a fiesta now than in the last few years. The scene is
considerably smaller, and segmented. The fiestas that I've seen that have
been getting the most heat are the ones which have been borderline public
nuisances and potentialy more dangerous than their massive counterparts.

Safeway pulled what? No one's stopping you from making your own biggidy
baggidy bad-ass tacos. Taquerias are in full-effect in the bay area.

Warren aka SparcoTrip, why to you keep harassing both sfraves and sacraves with you nonsensical babling?
 
And why on earth would you call "scooter" a real 'hardcore' DJ?  If you are refering to scooter the producers from Hamburg, THEY make trance music, specifically a type of kiddy nu-nrg that was around back in the day made specifically to target young audiences and generate chart numbers.  There is nothing 'hardcore' about them whatsoever, they make cheese for children.  A number of other artists (ex: Hardfloor, Tom Wax, Michael Kohlbecker, Jam & Spoon aka Tokyo Ghetto Pussy, DJ Hooligan, etc) during the time did the same thing as a JOKE.  This repackaging of standard issue frankfurt nu nrg for children first took place back in 92 and by 94 the joke was over for everybody but scooter.  Why they have continued to do the same exact thing for the last 10 years is totally mind bogling and certainly shows they are worthy of the lamest act in EDM award.  
 
I guess the fact that there are still people out there that want to hear that crap, and even worse, don't even know the history of that crap or which genre their crap is, proves that while they certainly have no artistic integrity to speak of, they made the right decision for their wallets.  And I wont even get into how every record they ever made is a KLF ripoff in some way or another....
 
But my point being... scooter is trance...   so 1) please stop cross posting to sfraves and bugging them with your nonsense, and 2) if you are going to bug everybody with your nonsense, at least know what you are talking about before you do it....

But what about the real hard almost gabber sounding hard-core? Dose anyone know how I can find out about partes with hard-core core music?

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Anyone know Danielle in Dublin/Pleasanton (really good dancer)

Hi all -

this is pretty random, but does anyone know Danielle that lives in 
Dublin/Pleasanton in the East Bay - she's short (around 5 feet), over 21, 
usually wears her hair back (used to be in buns, now in braids or twists) 
and a fantastically good dancer....

Anyway, if so could you forward this to her:

this is Becky, we chatted at Five Star Funk a few weeks back (I was wearing 
a white button up shirt like her friend's, over a tank top) ---- I'll be out 
at Masse's in Pleasanton on Monday night with my friend who's playing ghetto 
tech in the 1 am guest dj spot - hope to see her since she lives out that 
way!

Subject: [sfraves] Re: (NRR) help elect a President who is against the Drug War

Speaking of labels and name calling, it might be helpful to consider
propaganda analysis when playing word games and throwing flames. By
defining people through various names, labels and stereotypes, the game
begins. It is interesting to observe the depth of opinions conveyed, and
the point in which manipulation of people's ideas, definitions of ideals
and people change through one's perception and bias. Presumption versus
fact can have a huge impact on how ideas are received and messages
are conveyed.  To note, this applies to many situations, whether it be
political or any other subject that is emotionally charged...see

propaganda: case study
Propaganda Techniques: Word Games
Name Calling

"...The name-calling technique links a person, or idea, to a negative
symbol. The propagandist who uses this technique hopes that the audience
will reject the person or the idea on the basis of the negative symbol,
instead of looking at the available evidence..."

Psychological:

"...Name-Calling is a Disappointing Substitute for Real Criticism..."

-- Jensen, Arthur R. (2000) Name-Calling is a Disappointing Substitute for
Real Criticism, Psycoloquy: 11,#9 Intelligence G Factor (25)

Labels:

"...Think about the term "bitch", it used to be an insult toward women yet
today many women call themselves this name with pride. It was taken over
by the feminist movement almost a decade ago and redefined to mean "strong
woman who stands up for herself without apology..."

Political Propaganda:

"...List of Negative words and phrases that GOP candidates were told to
use when speaking about their opponents..."' -- cited from "Newt's
Name-Calling Words"

Historical:

Propaganda: Name-calling - Lesson Plan (University of Michigan)

redefined: (NASPCenter)

"...Unfortunately, many adults also engage in name-calling, having never
learned more appropriate means of expressing anger and displeasure; we
have only to view the evening news to see the consequences often violent
death...

...Name-calling is a means of expressing displeasure/disapproval of
others. Its aim is to hurt the other person, at least verbally, or
facilitate the other person's getting into trouble as he/she retaliates in
kind. This kind of retaliation firmly cements into place the reinforcing
consequences; thus, name-calling begets name-calling, resolves no
problems, and often leads to accelerated destructive behaviors..."

..In respects to the truth and reality:

The flaws of word games: Though this strategy of persuasion is effective,
it is flawed as a method for discovering or evaluating the truth; and it
is highly prejudicial and ripe for generating gross misrepresentation and
wrongful perceptions.

List of Flaws

* Oversimplification. Does the name capture the full essence of what the
person or idea represents?
* Overly broad classification and errant associations. The use of certain
labels tend to lump ideas together that have substantive differences.
* False classification. Not all labels are correctly applied. In fact,
negative labels, used in reference to various organizations by their
opponents, are particularly suspect--such is the case with the critics who
continue to use labels to communicate their point.
* Presumptive judgements. Not all labeling comes from generally accepted
sources
--particularly with regards to negative labeling. The questions may well
be asked, "who are the critics of the idea being criticized?" "Who are
they to decide who/what is [insert label here] and who/what is not? Who
are they to alter the dictionary definitions of certain terms, and stand
in judgement of another idea?"
* Mis-connotation. Because certain labels have diverse meanings, there is
the potential for the wrong meaning to be applied, and misinterpretations
to occur.

Subject: [sfraves] REUNITED

OK... so last Friday..> I went w/ Amber 2 her gig in Auburn called "Reunited".... LoL... yeah.... it was an interesting trip on the way 2 pick up Drag'n'fly!! Very interesting!!!  there's a new thing called "McPorn" now!! mmmmmm... yeah!

BUt the party was very interesting!!  It was in this vet hall & there were 2 rooms!  When we 1st got there... as soon as we walked in... we were in the Jungle Room already!!  This DJ was Groovy... but I dunno... his whole swet it seem like was mainly all like Raga Jungle & Tech Step & it was kinda hard 2 get my Groove on... but he was good!!  BUt Ooooh My Goodness... OK... I respect like girls who go w/ their DJ boyfriends 2 gigs & stuff yeah... but man... I dunno... be happy your bf is spinning or something!!!  There was this girl like bein this Mondo wall flower sitting behind the decks of standing in from of the speaker jus' i dunno... eating her fuckin' fingernails!!  I mean... unless that DJ was like  babysitting that girl or something... it's kind apathetic 2 watch your bf spin & not do nothing!!!

Anywaze... we went in2 the main room & there was this 2X4 goin' on w/ these DJs spining like Tech House & stuff!  It was interesting!!  I liked it!!  It was fun!

So like yeah... I went 2 the outdoor area & like right away.... I saw fuckin' Mr Breakbeats himself, CANTOS!!!  Oh MY Goodness man... it was So Awesome seeing him!!!  

I also ran in2 His Highness!!! Weeeeeeeeee... it was so Dope seeing him!!!  Oh My Goodness... it's like totally rare I get 2 C this CAt.. so we had alota stuff 2 talk about!!!  Grrrrrr... unfortunately... I won't be able 2 make it 2 his SunDance party This Sunday & man.. the line up looks fuckin' Awesome man!!!  But it was Dope kickin' it w/ Paul again!!! YAAAAAAY!!

So DFly & Amber got on the decks & man... their set was so trippy!!!  I mean... they like totally started out w/ this tribal house kinda stuff... I think I heard some Electro thrown in there.... then they totally went full on in2 som Breakbeats, Trance, Acid, a lil' Techno here & there, man... it was Fuckin' Sick!!!  LoL!!  I Loved it!!!  I was pretty much dancing the whole time during their 2X4 set!!!  It was so Awesome!!!

So the party itself was pretty ummmmmm.... intimate I guess U could say!!  It wasn't a full house 2 like what that venue coulda been, but it was a Groovy crowd!!

It was a really fun time!!!  

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

You forgot to mention that he's way more than just a DJ/producer.

Most of the comic book stuff here is his work:
http://www.djax.nl/
http://www.capsite.net/grafix/aoldham/aoldham.htm

Anyway, along with US label UR (undergroundresistance, detroit... who
brought a super minimal criminal activist vibe), t-1000 aka alan oldham
has brought a lot of techno's most creative visual imagery and concepts to
the world (countless comic style stuff for djax, the logo designs for
transmat and kms, list goes on).  AND he fuckin shreds as a dancefloor DJ,
producer of some of the genres banginest tracks and historically as a
radio DJ with a show going back to 1987.

Take this opportunity to see the man throw down.  Essential listening for
anybody interested in techno...

i saw a movie that i really wanted to see, but forgot about, and then all of a sudden, POOF!, there it was, and i went, "woah, i forgot about that one." and i thought i wouldn't be able to watch it, 
thought, "nevermind", but then i watched it, and it was really good. so, scratch that one off, huh? now what? sometimes, 
they are just too loud these days,(the movie houses, that is) and also, why sit still for a movie when there is so much to do and see? if you have a date, and then on your way to the date, you see 
someone else that you want to go on a date with, do you think you should just go home? i think in most cases, the answer to that question is probably, "yes". what does that have to do with films? well, 
you should always question yourself about why you want to go to that movie. i mean, one show i want to see, i was thinking i might just want to see the clothes, and couldn't i just pick up a magazine or, uh, 
do my laundry for once in my life? no. why should i wash my clothes when i can go see some clean clothes on screen, dump the other clothes, and pick up more later? see what i mean? there are just too many choices sometimes, but always, well, i was about to say,  always a good time 
to be had, but recently i heard on the radio that you can't plan a good time. good times just happen or don't. i guess that is why you aren't having fun sometimes. i mean, if you are planning on having fun, 
then you must have something in mind, and what happens is never an exact replica of what you have in mind. there is a big difference between internal thoughts and external thingies. if you draw a picture, you 
will know what i mean. there are some things that are kind of predictable though. like, maybe your drawing is really going to suck ass, and you knew it before you picked up the pen, however, you didn't really know how badly it would suck ass until you saw the finished product, and then, well, that was no fun at all, was it? :)

I'll third this comment.

Alan is a top notch dj, producer, artist, and overall great guy.

We had Alan come out to the first ever trust outdoor event in Wisconsin in
1994.  Due to some complications with our choice of speakers, and the
nighbor 4 miles away complaining about their walls viberating, we had to
drop the volume significantly to keep the event going.

Luckily Alan ramped up the energy even with the stacks at 1/4 volume, and
everyone went away happy.

Looking forward to seeing/hearing him again.

Subject: [sfraves] coolworld tacos

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

For some reason, the Taco Bell by my house makes really good tacos, other Taco Bells can suck, but this one is great! It's because of the nice ladies that work there.
 I guess I come from a different perspective, since I was a Detroit Club Kid long before I was a Raver, and the First and only Massive I have been to was Planet New Year 2003, and I was there as part of a friend's crew, but I had a good time, and so did another member of the crew who is so hard core he LIVES in an underground venue, (it was also his first massive) Anyway, this same friend is performing at Cyberfest, and it is a great opportunity for him, I just got off the phone with him discussing details, I am definately going to be on the crew again, Cyberfest is going to help him make a lot of headway into making a living from his art and 20,000 peole who might never see him perform  get to see him. So, I can't wholy diss massives myself. I also met my first honest to god English Trancer this weekend and was impressed, it seems raving is a lot more mainstream over there and has led to social change ... just something to consider. Not saying that fillet minjon isnt better, but
 hamburger has its place.  ( it's a metaphor, so don't get mad if your a veggie, ( I keep trying to go veggie myself ) I just couldn't think of a better one cause I am a little fried.)

But that's *.net* and we're .org! To my knowledge there is no relation.
Hyperreal - Everytime I hear that name I have to go back and listen to the
Shamen - En Tact.

Pop quiz! How is Hyperreal pronounced? =)

Actually, they have it right in the article:  Hyperreal.org.  Must have 
been some problems with the folks who proof the content on the web site.

introducing ourselves to the local community, and
dropping some raw ass broken beats at a low cost
to you! We know you're ready to let us in to your
heart, so here's the info for you and your lovely
self:


JUNGLE:

[1:30 - Close]
DOUBLEDAY (EMUOR, Swatchdog)
vs THE DOCTOR (Bay Raves, Swatchdog)
Everyone's favorite lovable junglist, The Doctor,
is a fast rising phenom in the NorCal Jungle
scene. He plays all over from San Jose all the
way out to Reno, Nevada. Dj DoubleDay is 1/2 of
iLLKO, the dark duo from Oaktown. Together, they
are unstoppably rocking the Tech/Up Jungle.
Fierceness!!!

BREAKS:

[12-1:30]
MADAME MERCURY (EMUOR, Mad Wax) -

catch on bad ass battling another, DJ Spinner. He
is the well proven veteran heart breaking bass
mechanic from iLLKO, rocking since old school
residencies with heroes such as Dan, Garth, Jeno,
Joey Mazzola…the list is long. If you miss this,
you miss your brush with greatness. It's
Spinner's Birthday to boot, expect shock and awe!!

Subject: [sfraves] Club Six and Doc Martin

--=====================_3644384==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

As many of you may know, Leslie Ayres, former moderator of this list and 
SFLNC activist, is back from Thailand -- permanently, this time.  So Joey 
and I took her out for a night of dancing at Club 6 last Saturday.

I pretty much tend to avoid clubs these days.  I've come to detest security 
pat downs and surveillance so I keep most of my dancing in the friendly 
underground -- with the exception of Club 6.

Club 6 is to my mind the closest thing to an underground party "above" 
ground.  The venue has the feel of a warehouse downstairs, sweat and 
all.  And we sweated Saturday night.  The place was packed for the Doc's 
4-hour set and we danced almost continuously.  When a DJ has four hours on 
the tables he/she can really reveal the musical soul, and Doc Martin's set 
was amazingly eclectic and beautifully complex.  He threw down some of his 
remixes, moved to banging, rockin' house, then there was some very trippy 
acid stuff, and even some soulful, disco-flavored house.  Reminded me of 
those early parties when Doc was based in San Francisco.

When we left around four we all looked like we had been in a torrential 
downpour -- just soaking wet.  And I noticed my pants were covered in 
dirt.  What one used to call raver dirt.  So satisfying, it was.  Down and 
dirty at Club 6.  Props to the owner of that venue -- hope they can 
maintain the freedom and the vibe.

They could, however, purchase a few more fans:)

Love,

Apollo

you could go in order of priority...meaning: man, woman, child...of course, man comes first when people say: man, woman, child....you could be number: 242, if 242 is next...either that, or you'll have to wait a 1/2 hour, because you are: 254...you could be a woman and be refered to as "Mrs. John Stone", that is if you don't want to wait five years to be semi- accepted into the "ladies" club at the church. once your accepted, so will your donations be, and then when you die, your name, "Mrs. John Stone" will appear on the plaque on the front door to the new church "clubhouse" with the other 569 donor names....don't call me mister. i'd rather be "little pincher bug" or something like that. "little pincher bug" gets TOP billing everytime...guaranteed. :)

Hyperreal is pronounced "ooh aahhh yeah yeah

Now the *groovy* sample... I always thought it was Ash (Bruce Campbell)
from Evil Dead. I know in Army of Darkness he says it, but I'd have to go
back and watch the first 2 again to see if it's said in those two. Random...

Subject: [sfraves] Question for the Flyer designers...

Sup yall,

Thanks for your suggestions for the printing dilemma.
I followed Nick's advice. I went 3 up on one sheet and
went B&W. The cost went to $170 to a mere $22.  Thanks
to everyone and thanks to Nick.

One last question to the designers out there...

I'm new to the flyer design game. How much do you
designers usually charge a client for designing the
piece? I did a flyer & a CD label. Anyone have advice?
Thanks again!

Right on....that was an awesome party...great vibe...great people.

SFLNC activist, is back from Thailand -- permanently, this time. So Joey 
and I took her out for a night of dancing at Club 6 last Saturday.

I pretty much tend to avoid clubs these days. I've come to detest security 
pat downs and surveillance so I keep most of my dancing in the friendly 
underground -- with the exception of Club 6.

Club 6 is to my mind the closest thing to an underground party "above" 
ground. The venue has the feel of a warehouse downstairs, sweat and 
all. And we sweated Saturday night. The place was packed for the Doc's 
4-hour set and we danced almost continuously. When a DJ has four hours on 
the tables he/she can really reveal the musical soul, and Doc Martin's set 
was amazingly eclectic and beautifully complex. He threw down some of his 
remixes, moved to banging, rockin' house, then there was some very trippy 
acid stuff, and even some soulful, disco-flavored house. Reminded me of 
those early parties when Doc was based in San Francisco.

When we left around four we all looked like we had been in a torrential 
downpour -- just soaking wet. And I noticed my pants were covered in 
dirt. What one used to call raver dirt. So satisfying, it was. Down and 
dirty at Club 6. Props to the owner of that venue -- hope they can 
maintain the freedom and the vibe.

They could, however, purchase a few more fans:)

Love,

Apollo

Mmm, yes... it was such a great time!! BabyDaddy kicked some ghetto ass
and had lots (relative to the number there) of people on the dance
floor shakin' their rumps.

And the drinks were seriously strong AGAIN tonight. 

Lots of good talent on the open decks... altho I did miss hearing some
good jungle last night.

Come out to Estuary!!! Lots of fun fun fun!!!

there are so many ways to say, "i love you." there are so many ways that one could not possibly see them all, and they just go on and on and on. there is so much love in the world. there is so much love in the world. the world is powered by it. there is nothing without love. you would not be here without love, and when you are gone, it is because there is love and there was love, and there will be more love. i am just saying so, because, people don't believe in what is completely apparent, and it is my power to point out whatever the hell i want to until the day i die, and then afterwards, maybe i'll do a little haunting too. black widows have a little red dot on the back of their bulbous (sp? round) bodies. sometimes, they like to live with you too. :)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The Drug Policy Alliance, in coordination with Assemblyman Mark Leno, the 
San Francisco Medical Society, the San Francisco Medical Cannabis Task 
Force, Americans for Safe Access, California NORML, and Marijuana Policy 
Project, invite you to a:


COMMUNITY FORUM ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION S:
SAN FRANCISCO'S COMMITMENT TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA


WHEN:   Tuesday, July 22, 2003, 9:30 am to 3:00 pm
WHERE:  First Unitarian Church, 1187 Franklin Street (at Geary)
INFO:   PLEASE R.S.V.P. by contacting: Ellie Schafer,
         EllieSchafer@msn.com, 415.584.7675
         Open to the Public
         Breakfast and Lunch provided


As we move forward with the Implementation of Proposition S, we need your 
input and participation!


San Francisco has supported Medical Marijuana for over 25 years.  In 2002, 
62% of San Francisco's voters passed Proposition S, which calls for the 
City and County of San Francisco to explore the possibility of cultivating 
and distributing Medical Marijuana.


We are proud to host a Community Forum during which we will introduce and 
discuss various implementation plans, as well as hear from experts in the 
field of medical marijuana.


We want to hear your ideas and concerns. Our goal is to include, inform, 
and unite our community as we proceed with this groundbreaking legislation.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."

It's sad to see it go but I can guarantee that if you come out to this party
it's going to blow shit up! It's one of my all time favorite spaces below
Market St. (literally underground below Market!). New Hack City will be
missed.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: software?

hey i was wondering what kind of software you folks out there 
would recommend for mixing.  i have a friend who's just learning 
and they asked for suggestions, but i've only ever worked from a 
composition oriented stand point.  maybe this is a really dumb 
question.  anyway, i know that a lot of the software i've used for 
electronic compositions could also be used for just mixing, but 
they might be a little bit overkill.  and i can't imagine that 
features like, oh, being able to view/edit everything as standard 
staff notation is really helpful. 

thanks!

Not to sound snarky or anything, but our reply to their never-changing
lineup never changes either.  =P

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Celebrate under the Stars!!! Stilldream 3 Year Anniversary Campout 7/26/03

Ok everyone we have been keeping this underwraps, but finally here it
is.....

An event 3 Years in the Making!

Everybody in the Stilldream Collective has been working hard to bring
everyone a very special party this summer. It is our favorite party of every
year and this is going to be the best ever!!!

Oh ya did i mention that it is at a 100% FULLY PERMITTED venue!



Coming July 26th, 2003
*~Stilldream 3 Year Anniversary Campout~*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------

22 hours of camping and continuous music in a beautiful
outdoor setting, featuring the best of techno, trance, and house from cali
and beyond:



DJ T-1000 (pure sonik records, tresor, d-jax beats, detroit)
The master of Disaster, Alan Oldham aka T-1000 coming straight from Detroit
to bring you some of that bangin techno sound, this is going to be one of
the most talked about sets of the year. Make sure you don't miss it!

Brad and Treavor (moontribe, l.a.)
DJ Brad's eclectic mixes flow smoothly, taking the listener on a musical
journey where time and space seem to disappear. Using the language of music
to unite and celebrate the earth and humanity is Brad's goal.

While most DJs are focused on one type of electronica, Treavor is known to
make the barriers between Techno, Trance, House and Breaks seem non-existent
often fusing them into one set. Be ready for the "DJ Treavor experience"!

John Massey (soundRehab, l.a.)
Deffinatly one of the hardest dj's coming out of the SoCal area in the
recent years, prepare to have this peerless pioneer of the classic and
contemporary techno sound use a rich blend of some bangin beats intermeshed
with drummy tracks yielding enough energy to run the lights in Los Angeles.

It's become an enjoyable experience for us to read these emails :)
 
As always email us who we can include to change the lineup to your tastes. 90% of everyone we book are due to the fans asking for them. So just ask away by emailing us personally. If you email us and we get enough demand for someone we'll book them if it's realistic for us to do so.
 
Best wishes and thank you for your support and enthusiasm to interact with us.

See you at PULSE...

Sascha

There are huge crop circles just south of Fairfield... they are the largest 
reported crop circles in the US. So did anyone else on the list go check this 
out? I did, I find it strange because my girlfriend and I thought we saw UFO's 
in that same area on our way to Reno on 3th of July. We didn't take it too 
seriously because we only saw a glipse but this story makes it quite a 
coincidence.

I'm from Vacaville, and there was an article in the paper last week about
the teenagers that made them. But if you are looking for fresh produce..
Larry's Produce is the shiznit.

The UFO that you thought you saw could have been an airplane from Travis
AFB.

I'm aware of the claim of the teenagers that suposedly did it but I've also 
read articles that show holes in their story. There are mathamatical problems 
that don't support the methods that the kids claimed to have used in the making 
of the circles, compared to the advanced geometric patterns of the circles in 
the main circle complex.
     It is true that there are now reported two "practice" circles near the 
one that was orginally reported. It is strange that these were found so many 
days later. These circles, very well could have actually been done by the 
teenagers... but did you ever think that the teenagers might have been trying 
(unsucessfully) to imitate the original pictogram? There are many possibilities to 
this story, it is still inconclusive. It's bad journalism to say "Teenagers 
that made them" in those words because the story is inconclusive as of now. It's 
just as bad as saying "Aliens that made them" or "Military that made them". 
     As for Travis AFB... I'm well aware that it's in the area, I have had 
friend stationed there before. But what I saw was three strage UFO's flying 
extreamly low directly over the freeway with triangular red/orange light patterns 
on them (did not look like jets mind you). Also I was an hour or so north east 
from where travis is located. Since this happened within a period of a few 
seconds, yes it is possible that these were some kind of military aircraft that

could it have been a large group of ravers all fucked up on psychadellics 
laying in large geometrical shapes under the full moon or something?
After their "puddle" was done it just looked like something from a UFO

--

In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. ... 
This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists' tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a scheme 
for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of 
property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists' antagonism toward the 
gold standard.

Subject: [sfraves]NRR: Makin beats, findin sounds?

Like many other people on this board I spend every free hour working on my 
music.  I need more samples!  More Bass drum .wavs, snare drum .wavs, 
ambient pads...  And for you Reason producers, I need more Maelstrom and 
Subtractor patches!  I have been pointed to a bunch of free sites for 
downloading patches, but it seems like they all sound the same, or are too 
light sounding.  I am coming to the point where I may actually have to spend 
money(gasp) on some new samples and patches.  So, if any of you have some on 
CD, I would love to buy them off you, or trade for something of equal or 
greater value.

Let me know.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ~*PULSE*~ FRIDAY.AUGUST.8th.2003 (*TWO ROOMS* w/13
 DJs)(XTORT)*BSP*

If the Market demands it.. Someone will book it..

There was a big ol debate that I posted on this a while back how I mentioned 
how the extort guys promote there party via BSP once a week everyweek till 
there "Monthly" happens. And the lineups only change slightly

And Dina (Dragnfly) Brought up some good points about this crew.. We have to 
keep in mind it is in Suck-of-tomatoes. And not the bay area.. so the 
"Market" is a bit different out there.
She went on to mention that these guys are good guys and not out to screw 
the scene or local comeunity. Which no one implied they were..

BUT!!!! I have a challenge for you XTORT guys.. If people love your parties 
so much and you do a solid event. Then lineup should not really sway your 
attendance.. So how bout you try and book a non lower common denomiter 
lineup and lets see what happpens.

Good example of what im talking about..  When I started going to parties 
Half the time I did not know the DJ's that were on the flyers for "The 
Gatherings" But I still drove my Ass miles out to there events.. Why you 
say?? Cause they Martin O'brien and rest of the crew were known for throwing 
solid events.

Another example.. Till this Day I will attend a FnF,CFC or Viberation or any 
other solid crews party Just based on the date alone I don't need to see the 
lineup or ask how many Lasers they are going to have... why you ask?? Cause 
these said crews throw kick ass parties regardless of who is playing. And 
half the time FnF parties sell out with lil to no promotion at all just word 
of mouth.. Now that is "Keeping the Faith!!!!"

DISCLAIMER:!!!! Now some of the Said DJ's on the XTORT lineups are people 
that I know and have respect for. So NO im not slamming there DJ's one bit 
but more so the way they gear there predicatable lineups.

Buying samples won't necessarily give you what you want...try taking some
samples and tweaking them out to sound how you want them to.

I'd recomend you look into sampling your own sources. A lot of times the 
resources you'll find are the same old tired sounds that everyone on mp3.com is 
using in their music. Try taking existing samples and modifying/effecting them. 
Take a snare and shorten it, change it's attack. Or take a kick drum and layer 
it for a fuller sound. Combine two different synth pads to make a new sample... 
Stuff like that. Play around with your samples in a program like SoundForge and 
you'll probably be able to come up with some stuff that doesn't sound like 
everyone else.

Good luck.

Ditto on the advice of making your own samples...

If you're using reason, just grab yourself ReCycle so you can slice 
them for use at various BPMs... Gotta love REX files :) I think BIAS 
Peak will also automatically create slices from sound clips, but I'm 
not sure if it can export to a format that Reason can use.

I know these methods all too well, I still have a lot of samples to work 
with, I just want more!  I know that there are cds out there with like, 500 
snare drums and 500 kick drums, etc.  thats what I would like.

What do you guys do when you get tired of the kick drums and snare drums 
that you are using?  Just find ways to tweak it more?  I have probably 50 
odd snare drum files, I just want to build up my database so I have more to 
choose from.

I appreciate the responses!

I'd say get a digital recorder a halfway decent mic
and head out to the streets. I would suggest taking a
drum stick and a rubber mallet and heading to the UC
Santa Cruz Music buildings. It seems like all of the
surfaces there (i.e. railings and steps) were
engineered to produce different sounds when percussed.
I would check that out. 

Also there is this beach about 4 miles north of the
last stoplight in SC that has this undercut bank and
at low tide the waves hit it.  It makes the deepest
bass resonance I have ever heard. 

Other than that, how about messing with other people's
drum noises like Einsturzende Neubauten's.  They had
everything in their music from a fork on sheetmetal to
a microphone in a fire. 

I got the Archos digital jukebox and have been doing
stuff like that. The only thing is I need a better
mic.

sounds (telephone rings, flutes, dogs, whatever) into percussive 
sounds has been fun.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: New toy from Apple.. "Soundtrack"

Looks like a loop-based Acid type thingamajig, but with 24/96 
resolution, support for AU plug-ins and bouncing individual tracks to 
ProTools/Logic/etc.  Supports Acid, AIFF, WAV formats. Seems pretty 
prosumer.. doubt I'd use something like this on its own, but it could 
integrate nicely into an existing recording environment.

http://www.apple.com/soundtrack/

I think this is great overall.. it'll create a lot more laptop 
musicians.  :)

Subject: [sfraves] VRR:Makinbeatsfindinsounds/analog vs digi

2 cents coming at u...
ive been through this the past few months so listen up to some advice.  and we will further the discussion into the familiar battle between digital vs analog and computer vs out board gear.  

lets start by saying i was given an enormous amount of software 12 months ago.  Reason2.0, CubasSX, FM7, Absynth, MoogSynth, the works, u name it i gots it. 
(btw Atmosphere & Stylus are hands down the best ive come across as far as clarity and beef)
to make a very long story short, and to add that i dropped using all my studio/outboard gear to learn these programs.
the studio list consists of a Korg Prophecy, a 909, a SH101
Alesis DM Pro (these are going for 500 bucks now!!! i paid 1k years ago) Sequential Pro One, Emu sampler and some FX.

here goes,
i learned that reason sounds best when Rewired through CubasSX
and separating each track (sound) and to hit it up with the FX section.  VERY nice sound when applying the right FX (ohmboyz,flange, delay,reverb etc.) its the only way to go.
Reason sounds like crap to me if you don't separate the tracks in addition to having a decent sound card.
rex files are low rez as are the drum patches that come with Reason.  the story is, THEY SUCK. canned fruit.

after 6 months of this with reason, most of my outboard sits and collects dust.  6 months later i drop reason and turn all the external gear on.

WHAT HAPPENED!?! the sound coming from my external gear IS FAR
superior as far as clarity and low end (u will notice reason sounds tingly-high-end-hard-to-get-a-real-sound-out-of-tha thing) canned fruit we call it (fruity loops anyone)

its as simple as this.  the software is NICE! 
BUT, you will get a MUCH cleaner more defined sound if you just take your time and build your studio piece by piece.
check out music swap shops, hell check ebay.  stuff is around for cheap.  and by-the-way...
GO ANALOG.
i have also found, and yes the Nord , Virus , and the like are awesome face punching synths, but a keyboard like any vintage korg or roland, or even the Alesis Andromeda blow all that digital crap away hands down don't even respond back to this cuz i ait listnin and if you cant take 10 years worth of advice go learn it the hard way.  also stay away from bang for the buck boxes like electribes and such.  it aint worth it.

and oh yea, i do pick up a sample disk once in a while. even picked up the Creative Essentials for Reason and it was a big fat waist of 150 bucks.  shoulda saved it for the studio.  live and learn.

Jon

Instead of spending time and money acquiring a CD of patches someone else
has made, why not spend it learning some synthesis basics so you can create
your own.  Knowing even just the basics of waveforms, filters, envelopes,
etc... will allow you to make the synths sound like you want them to sound.
A lot of the time it's frustrating trying to get the Subtractor and
Maelstrom (or any synth for that matter, but those two in particular) to
sound a certain way just by "tweaking" the parameters; but if you understand
what sort of waveform you're trying to create and how to adjust the synths
to generate that waveform, you'll be a lot more successful.

Hey peeps,
I'll be having a local underground house DJ on the show this week.
Thomas B will be making a repeat visit to KZSU tomorrow morning between
9a and Noon, to send you on your way to work/school with some tasty,
inspiring, booty-shaking house beats.  What better way is there to start
your day off???

Thomas B has been involved in the SF underground since '95, playing
with rockin' crews such as Overworld, Urban Wasteland, Infinite Beat
and Friends and Family (You DO remember some of these, right????)

You can contact him @ galvanize @ galvanize.org

As usual, plenty of goodies to pass your way!  So make sure you tune in.
90.1 FM, or online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

1. Future Music -- sample CDs with every issue. I got
a ton of 808/909 sounds that way.

2. Todd Terry vs. Everything But The Girl, hit Chicago
house track, a classic for the rave fogeys like me.
Some might say it made ETBG's career in dance music.
Snare drum was a golf ball thrown down a hallway.

3. Sample tracks you like, filter the fuck out of
them, mangle them beyond recognition. Not even for
loops necessarily, anything.

4. XOLOX!!

5. If folks are down to trade sample CDs, I am so
fucking down I can't even tell you. Down like James
Brown. DOWN. If you have BT's new school breaks sample
CD, I will suck your dick.

(note: I will probably not actually suck your dick.)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] VRR:Makinbeatsfindinsounds/analog vs digi

with all due respect for your ten years of experience, ALTRD, i think your
advice is tremendously short-sighted.  to say that in ALL cases one might
achieve more "clarity" and "beef" out of a broad category of equipment such
as "analog" vs. "digital" gear or outboard vs. plug-ins is foolish.  things
like clarity, crispness, definition, and body are dependent upon a multitude
of factors.  i've heard digital set-ups that sound incredibly clean and warm
and analog set-ups that sound totally hollow and crappy.  i know a number of
producers on this list who can create incredible sounding stuff in Reason or
on an Electribe, and a number of producers who have access to millions of
dollars of high-end gear who can't make shit.  the fact of the matter is,
there's no piece of "magic" gear; the principal factor in the quality of
your productions is always going to be your TALENT, not how much money you
spent on a studio set-up.  yeah, it's true that a 50k+ protools HD rig is
probably gonna sound better than a PC with a Soundblaster card running
Reason, but all that gear is still just a TOOL; what matters is how it's
used.

Fook me, I'm tethered to a desktop, too... I've been wanting a 'book 
for a while now, but this article cemented it:

http://tinyurl.com/h5a4

Looks like some others have had the idea as well!

To the person who didn't want any responses (that's asking for plenty 
of responses) re: outboard equipment and a decade of expertise. Yes, 
outboard equipment is and probably always will be better in terms of 
sound quality, etc., but the original question was posed by someone 
using a digital solution. Secondly, as it always comes up in these 
threads, the quality/accuracy/whatever of digital emulation vs. 
dedicated hardware completely takes a back seat to whether the music is 
any good! :)

I have about zero dollars in my studio budget, and I'm not all that 
great at tweaking the hell out of sounds or even producing the cleanest 
sounds when I record. I get my greatest satisfaction not from when a 
listener appreciates the technical accuracy of my recordings, but from 
where the piece of music takes them, if it meets (or defies) particular 
expectations, etc. Maybe I'm too much of a pop-song-writer type, but to 
me, the message matters more than the technology used to convey it.

Bullshit.

Analog has yet to be perfectly emulated.  Digital is digital.  Anything that
you can do in a Virus or Nord, you can do in host-native software.  Virus
and Nord and all the digital synths are nothing more than host native
software on a different host.

Just because Nord hasn't ported their NordLead software to a PC or Mac,
doesn't make it anything more special than software.

Perfectly good point, and I hadn't differentiated between digital and 
analog ;)  At any rate, the big point I was trying to make was that 
arguing over the bits and bytes and sound quality don't mean anything 
if you can't put a tune together for shit. EN (I can't freakin spell it 
right now) made just as interesting stuff by hammering on bedsprings as 
Throbbing Gristle did with playing with noise and Sonic Youth has done 
with feedback and Orbital does with a fortress of gear.

I've had a problem with 60hz hum on my guitar amp, and I can't stand 
it, but when putting a track together recently, it was more important 
to me to get the whole thing working as a track first...

--=====================_3458372==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

RAVE ACT:  Drug Policy Alliance


Our supporters fought hard to try to stop the Illicit Drug 
Anti-Proliferation Act (more commonly known as the RAVE Act) from becoming 
law, but a handful of career politicians ignored the public's sensible 
concerns and enacted the measure without a hearing or public debate. With 
your help, the Drug Policy Alliance continues to challenge this bad law.


In the wake of a recent incident in Billings, Montana where the DEA used 
the threat of the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act to shut down a 
medical marijuana fundraiser, we asked you to send faxes to the DEA 
demanding they adopt guidelines or regulations to stop such abuses. We also 
asked you to fax Senator Biden (the sponsor of the law) and your Members of 
Congress to urge them to pressure the DEA to adopt such guidelines.


Since you took action, Senator Biden has strongly criticized the Billings, 
Montana incident and pushed the DEA to enforce the law in a fair and proper 
manner.  Whenever possible we thank our legislators for doing the right 
thing.  Although we continue to have concerns about the Illicit Drug 
Anti-Proliferation Act we commend Senator Biden for taking such important 
steps. Senator Durbin and other Members of Congress have also criticized 
the DEA's actions. Bowing to this public pressure, the DEA has adopted new 
internal guidelines.  We are certain that Senator Biden's intervention was 
a key to restraining these DEA abuses.


While new DEA guidelines do not have the force of law (which is why the 
Drug Policy Alliance strongly supports reforming the law), we hope they 
will provide important protections for our civil liberties. Unfortunately, 
the DEA has refused to release the details of their new guidelines. The 
Drug Policy Alliance is submitting a Freedom of Information Act Request to 
require the DEA to provide the American people with copies of the guidelines.


In the meantime, voters continue to organize around the country to pressure 
Congress to change the law and the Drug Policy Alliance is putting together 
a legislative coalition to repeal or reform it. A major musical 
demonstration against the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act is planned 
for September 6th in front of the Senate. We hope to see you there!

I hate to be a cynical bastard (Well, actually I thrive on my own cynicism. 
But I'm trying to use a figure of speech here.).

But isn't this something like the third "last party at New Hack"?

I'm almost 100% sure that I remember another "farewell to New Hack" thread on
this, or another list, many months ago.  And I'm pretty sure I remember being
told verbally, as I was leaving the last New Hack party I attended, that they
weren't going to be doing any more.

I don't see any problem here. they're having another
last party ever because the last last party ever was
so good.

How's this for ya - they got threatened with losing there lease, poly had
moved to Atlanta while Greg still kept the space going. Under the threat of
losing the space the parties stopped. That was the *one* last party at new
hack ever. Guess what? This is the final blow out that violates the lease
because why? THEY DON'T GIVE A FUCK now. That's what happens when you move
out of the country in a week to Costa Rica.

So this is the final, final party at NHC. You green now? =)

History of Hyperreal:

http://hyperreal.org/info/history.html

circa 1994

"...the pc, a pentium 90, went under his desk at wired, was hooked up to
their lan and was given a public ip address. he chose a domain name for it
in honor one of his favorite techno tracks at the time: 'hyperreal' by the
shamen. (specifically, the jack dangers remix of that song). the machine
name, taz, was a reference to hakim bey's entry on every cyberpunk's
essential reading list: 'T.A.Z. - the Temporary Autonomous Zone,
Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism'..."

aye - i thought that MAYBE someone out there might possibly be =
interested in what i am about to say....


------------------------------------------------------

I just recently watched a movie named "who is cletis tout" and let me =
tell you, this has some kick ass directing (sort of along the lines of =
Tarantino) with a humurous yet interesting plot.


Who is Cletis Tout? (2002)
    =20

            comedy     Prison escapee Trevor Finch (Christian Slater) =
assumes the identity of a deceased man, Cletis Tout, but soon discovers =
that someone had put out a hit on Cletis. Now, as Finch and fellow =
escapee Micah (Richard Dreyfuss) race to recover Micah's hidden =
diamonds, they must outrun not only the police but hit man Critical Jim =
(Tim Allen), as well! Portia de Rossi plays Finch's girlfriend, Tess, in =
this caper comedy. =20

    =20



-------------------------------------------------

i also recently watched the movie "Wasabi" which is a french film that =
was made in 2001. if you get it on DVD you can choose to watch the =
original French version, or the dubbed English version. I watched about =
quarter of the movie dubbed then switched to the French version. I must =
say that i prefer the French version (with subtitles)


Wasabi (2001)
    =20

            action     Hubert (Jean Reno) is a police inspector who =
receives a telephone call from Japan one day informing him that Miko =
(Yuki Sakai), the love of his life who disappeared nearly 20 years ago, =
has died under strange circumstances. She hasn't forgotten him -- in =
fact, she's named him executor of her will. But what Hubert soon =
discovers is that he's been saddled with a handful of problems -- and a =
daughter (Ryoko Hirosue) he never knew he had! =20
    =20


-------------------------------------------------

and if you like French films, then you should also check out Amelie.


Amelie (2001)
Le Fabuleux destin d'Am=E9lie Poulain
    =20

            foreign     Impish gamine Am=E9lie (Audrey Tautou) lives =
alone and works in a caf=E9. When she finds a trove of toys hidden for =
40 years behind a baseboard in her apartment, she's inspired to =
repatriate the items, an impulse of generosity that sparks more =
benevolent acts. A celebration of life, Am=E9lie reminds us of the small =
wonders that abound around us . if only we paused to look. =20
    =20

  aye - i thought that MAYBE someone out there might possibly be =
interested in what i am about to say....


  ------------------------------------------------------

  I just recently watched a movie named "who is cletis tout" and let me =
tell you, this has some kick ass directing (sort of along the lines of =
Tarantino) with a humurous yet interesting plot.


  Who is Cletis Tout? (2002)
      =20

              comedy     Prison escapee Trevor Finch (Christian Slater) =
assumes the identity of a deceased man, Cletis Tout, but soon discovers =
that someone had put out a hit on Cletis. Now, as Finch and fellow =
escapee Micah (Richard Dreyfuss) race to recover Micah's hidden =
diamonds, they must outrun not only the police but hit man Critical Jim =
(Tim Allen), as well! Portia de Rossi plays Finch's girlfriend, Tess, in =
this caper comedy. =20

      =20



  -------------------------------------------------

  i also recently watched the movie "Wasabi" which is a french film that =
was made in 2001. if you get it on DVD you can choose to watch the =
original French version, or the dubbed English version. I watched about =
quarter of the movie dubbed then switched to the French version. I must =
say that i prefer the French version (with subtitles)


  Wasabi (2001)
      =20

              action     Hubert (Jean Reno) is a police inspector who =
receives a telephone call from Japan one day informing him that Miko =
(Yuki Sakai), the love of his life who disappeared nearly 20 years ago, =
has died under strange circumstances. She hasn't forgotten him -- in =
fact, she's named him executor of her will. But what Hubert soon =
discovers is that he's been saddled with a handful of problems -- and a =
daughter (Ryoko Hirosue) he never knew he had! =20
      =20


  -------------------------------------------------

  and if you like French films, then you should also check out Amelie.


  Amelie (2001)
  Le Fabuleux destin d'Am=E9lie Poulain
      =20

              foreign     Impish gamine Am=E9lie (Audrey Tautou) lives =
alone and works in a caf=E9. When she finds a trove of toys hidden for =
40 years behind a baseboard in her apartment, she's inspired to =
repatriate the items, an impulse of generosity that sparks more =
benevolent acts. A celebration of life, Am=E9lie reminds us of the small =
wonders that abound around us . if only we paused to look. =20

Nomad Jukebox 3 .mp3 player AND RECORDER, 20 gig hard drive with Firewire...
only $200 after rebate:

http://www.jandr.com/JRProductPage.process?RestartFlow=t&Merchant_Id=1&Section_Id=&Product_Id=2780386&showcase=t&sh_rKeyWord=nomad+jukebox+3

You can record a 10 hour DJ set to uncompressed 48khz .wav files with this
thing...

My .mp3 player/recorder I bought recently is simply, hands down, the best 
consumer electronics investment I have made in years...

-troy

ps: I am not affiliated with J and R electronics... just passing on this
info... its a great deal.  Similar iPods cost twice as much and don't currently
record.

not to detract from your business, but there is a model i saw a picture of this morning whose name escapes me, but my point is is that her name is really close to yours, and she is so very perfectly beautiful, so i thought i would share that with you, because,  maybe that will make you feel beautiful too. you can totally ignore me, if you like, by the way. wierd men read my posts. protect yourself. :)

that's cool -- it looks like there are some good DJs lined up.

man. i like what Fanboy spins, but he is a serious fan-boy all the 
way. last time i saw him, he was wearing a "klingons don't need 
ribbed condoms" shirt.

Hi all - in case you didn't know, one of the best, and one of my =
favorite DJs, is coming to SF to play at the kinkyfunk boat party this =
sunday.  the one and only danny howells.

i was trying to think of what to say to convey how much fun his sets are =
and how much people who are into quality progressive tech-house electro =
funk fun music need to be here for this party, then i saw the article in =
the examiner about him and thought it was a good start.  this really is =
a unique opportunity to hear one of the best, in his prime (versus some =
other big djs that shall remain nameless...)!

http://www.sfexaminer.com/arts/default.jsp?story=3D071703a_howells =
(pasted below too)

thump radio resident house djs on the upper deck.  :)

so any of you self respecting prog heads out there - you should have =
your tickets already!  we'll see ya there with those big grins on your =
face!

come out onto the high seas with us sunday - you will not regret it...

tickets available on www.thumpradio.com

peas!

-brian

ps. does function 1 sound mean anything to you?  ;)

DJ Howells climbs aboard Kinkyfunk Boat Party.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------

DJ Danny Howells has often described his love of music as more of an =
addiction. Maybe that's why he's been affectionately dubbed "the =
clubber's DJ" by fellow junkies around the world and on both sides of =
the decks.=20
So naturally, when much-heralded U.K. label Global Underground, arguably =
Europe's kings of the double-CD mix, decided to launch a brand new mix =
CD series devoted to people who eat, sleep and breathe music, Howells =
was the first person they went to.=20

The English DJ, and all- around fine bloke, headlines Sunday's Kinkyfunk =
Boat Party, whipping up an on-the-water mix of deep and dirty =
full-spectrum house in celebration of the upcoming release of Global =
Underground's "24:7 Danny Howells."=20

"I'm gonna have to have a word with Dahi when I arrive," jokes Howells, =
referring to Dahi Donnelly, who together with partner Brian Sheehy, =
helped organize Sunday's shindig. "I did a track called 'Kinkyfunk' a =
few years back and that Dahi stole the name for his party."=20

Howell's new CD won't hit stores here in the U.S. until Tuesday but the =
"24:7" promotional tour kicked off months ago and the veteran DJ says =
he's already earned enough frequent-flyer miles to take a nice holiday, =
if he ever gets the chance.=20

"I think I've discovered a new kind of (DJ) ailment," he says. "I did a =
12-hour set the other night and when I got back to my hotel, I had =
friction burns in a rather embarrassing place from all that wiggling =
about."=20

These marathon sets, a nightmare for some DJs, have become Howell's =
specialty. The graduate of British progressive house royalty John =
Digweed's school of Bedrock currently holds a coveted monthly Saturday =
night residency at New York megaclub Arc; and his already legendary =
10-hour sets there are gabbed about on Monday via the club's online =
message board with the same degree of reverence usually reserved for =
rock stars.=20

"Back when I had a day job doing sh-- work, I thought an eight-hour =
workday was long," he jokes. "But actually, it goes by pretty quick =
because I'm having such a good time. Sometimes, I'm having so much fun =
that I actually forget to even go to the bathroom."=20

The new CD, he says, is a taste of what he's been listening to lately at =
home, in the car, in his hotel room and on the plane, tracks that he =
loved to death but had trouble finding a home for.=20

"They're really gorgeous little tracks," he explains, "but a lot of them =
are really spooky and cold and I just didn't think they worked well in =
one of my regular sets. I knew they'd work well together, though, so I =
just put them in a little pile at home for the next project."=20

So when Global Underground founders James Todd and Andy Horsfield =
knocked on Howells' door with the idea for a new series about life in =
and beyond the club -- the first disc features a daytime, chill-out, for =
lack of a better description, mix and the second, a nighttime, dance =
floor mix -- he knew the records he'd been stockpiling at home would =
work perfectly.=20

"When I started working on (the project), I wasn't concerned with style, =
really," he says. "I was trying to create more of a feeling or a mood. =
The record goes through a really wide range of styles, but the mood is =
pretty constant. It's pretty dark and a lot of the tracks have this sort =
of melancholic vibe, but it's really sexy, too."=20

Howells says he couldn't be more pleased with the end result or with the =
opportunities that seem to keep coming his way and believes he owes his =
success of late to his rather organic approach to business.=20

"I just sort of let things happen, really," he says. "My only plans for =
the future are to get married someday and have children, maybe do some =
gardening. Other than that, I don't really have any plans. I'm just =
gonna carry on as I am."=20

Kinkyfunk Boat Party featuring Danny Howells
Boat leaves Pier 9 at 6:00 p.m. SHARP on Sunday. Tickets are $35 =
advance/$40 day of event. Call (415) 543-3505 or visit =

Who out there remembers a show, i think it was on PBS, or maybe nickelodeon or something, but it was a math show and it had the ever popular Mathman skit, kinda like pac man but with math involved, what was the name of that show.  For the life of me i cant remember.

I used to watch that show ALL THE TIME!! Mathnet was awesome... I can
still remember the episode that was focusing on prime numbers was my
fav.

Did any of y'all ever watch Encyclopedia on HBO?? They had this
hilarious kitsch trio named Betty singing all the stuff for the show.
Each show was on a different letter volume of the Encyclopedia...
learning through comedy... LOL

anyway, I have a friend flying up from l.a. tomorrow who really needs to dance.  he's been out of the party scene for the past three years, and this was going to be his 'welcome back' to the scene.  
 
I don't want him to waste the trip...  does anyone know of anything cool going on saturday night?  ug or massive, doesn't really matter.  please hit me back off the list if you know where I can find some beats.  
 
thanks for the help!!

Thanks for the trip down memory lane!  Totally forgot about these shows
minus Mathman.  That dude was my hero growing up! :)  Down with evil
tornado storm clouds!  But we also can't forget Nova, MP's Flying Circus
and Masterpiece Theatre... Or more preferably.. Monsterpiece Theatre on
Seasame Street.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Some crazy show on PBS

I think I'd outgrown daytime PBS by the time Square One TV and Mathman 
were on the scene, although I do remember seeing them.

My summer daytimes were spent getting fat and lazy in front of the TV 
in the name of cultural diversity. Vegetable Soup, High Feather... it's 
interesting how a lot of these shows promoted diversity long before the 
"PC" movement started.  Even Electric Company and Sesame Street went a 
long way to have people of different ethnic backgrounds while all the 
other programming geared toward kids was stuck in Father-Knows-Best 
suburbialand.

For a kid growing up as a mutant freak in Sunnyvale, it helped me deal 
with being "different."  While race and ethnicity are still issues, 
it's nice to see that some shows have progressed to embrace different 
"types."  Pretty soon, I'm sure Canadian import Degrassi Jr. High will 
have b-boys mingling with ravers mingling with preps mingling with 
goths mingling with punks...   I think those are more divisive lines 
than anything, at least in our area these days.

Kudos to PBS...

A NEW HARD-LINER AT THE DEA

Soon to be new chief of the DEA Karen Tandy will be confirmed with little

the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we

Subject: [sfraves] ATP: NRR: Minidisc Players

I have a Sony MZ-R500, connected to my computer, via USB, through a
XITEL MD-Port DG2. I am using Music Match Jukebox to "attempt" to place
items on my MD. I say attempt because it doesn't appear music match
recognizes, or supports my product. 

Which hassles free app can I use to get music onto my MD? 

Thanks in advance for the help.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Great deal on .mp3 player...

yeah, so when are we all going to start sharing our MP3's :-)

I own an 15G 3rd generation IPOD... I dunno, but the JB3 seemed kinda *huge* 
to me. I like to rollerblade and put the player in my pocket. And people
would think I'm far gladder to see them than I actually am, were I to pocket
the JB3. (BTW, if you see a big tall guy in a shiny metallic blue helmet with
built-in silver headphones skating at 
embaracero/marina/ftmasongreen/goldengatepark, or just slaloming down
the middle of haight street after dining at Blue Front Cafe, well that's
me!... ).

The Nomad Zen USB 2 seems cool as well, though I hear it is not very 
shock/motion resistant. Is it true that when you open the bag for this
device it says "No jogging"... how does your NJB3 stand up to constant
motion??

But... 200 is a good price for the NJB3... but If I were to do it over again
(and I might just return this Ipod for something that just lets me
drag-and-drop directories of MP3s and listen to them, like god intended us to)
I'd get an archos recorder 20 and run Rockbox (http://rockbox.haxx.se/) on it.
IPODs still kinda suck on windows, cuz you have to use Music Match Jukebox, 
which is kind-of-a-complete-piece-of-shit.

my friend, you have not learned the joys of EphPod.  connects to the iPod quickly,
transfers music 3X faster than MMJB, and it lets you use your iPod however YOU want
to.  not like that MMJB bloatware that wants to be your "media center".  i manage my
media just fine, thank you.  all i want is to transfer music to my iPod.  best of
all, it's free.  by the way, you can thank me later by buying me a drink ;)

Yes - the people that throw the Sunset parties... All night long in SF.
House music of the good kind. It's normally a 21+ thing, BUT special
occasion and it's all ages! =)

Subject: [sfraves] A Pattern (revisited)

This poem is fucka old.  I done writ it back in 1992. 
I know I posted it here several years ago, but I just
sent it out to Fable, and then I re-read it and found
some embarrassing typos, sloppy spots, and tired
images.  

So here's the '03 remix.  I hope the formatting goes
OK through e-mail.

cunnilingus & whippets,
boomerang
.... .  .   .

	
     A PATTERN	© 1992 Peter Sandifer	

A seagull skims the ocean at dawn--
Youth.
The flutter of wings, the dust of feathers;
a raven in the churchyard caws.

The earth will find her way--
these revolutions work on circuits.

Time.  Our greatest game.  
You've been,
	    You've thought,
			   You've seen,
You've twisted this spiral before.

10:21 a.m.
Tuesday.
A fetus settles into the vacuum.
A pause in creation--
She will be reborn.  
She will find her way back out.

God's fingers work absurd mathematics
on the humble scales of time--
			and hereness
			and nowness
in human weight
make no sense to the stars.

The churchyard at dusk:
Poets and politicians and junkies rot.
A raven picks the frozen ground.
The earth buckles from frost.
A fencepost leans with weariness.

An ancient oak by the graveyard's edge:
Naked branches break skyward
Again and again
	again and again
		in perfect patterns, 
feeling for heaven.  
As instinct.

Springtime.
One minute to midnight.
The grass glitters with wetness, 
      and worlds below.
The children dance until dawn.
A synthetic heartbeat pounds
between earth and womb,
or gravity and flight:
	boom boom boom boom
	boom boom boom boom
One hundred and twenty beats per minute.

"Meaningless! Meaningless!"
cries the child to the ancient stars.
"Utterly meaningless!
Everything is meaningless!"

The planets line in soldiers’ stance:
			Hup, two, three, four.
			Hup, two, three, four.
A pattern.
	A pattern.
		A pattern.
What has been done will be done again.

A baby is born.
A heartbeat tapers.
Gravestones mold and crumble.

A seagull grazes the ocean at dawn.

There is nothing new under the sun.









Several lines hijacked from the Book of Ecclesiastes: 
Meaningless! Meaningless! ...
What has been done will be done again.
There is nothing new under the sun.

Subject: [sfraves] "Friendster" for mp3s???

So I was thinking it'd be kind of cool to have a secure peer-to-peer
filesharing service for linking groups of friends together.

It'd need a layer of encryption on every bit of the service. To
browse it, use it, eavesdrop on it, or even know what kind of
service is throwing around the encrypted packets, one would require
a key. That would be as simple as having a service admin, or perhaps
even a voting majority (pgp can do this) create you an access key.
One could even have an option of keeping the files encrypted on a
drive, and using a decryption driver to make them available to mp3
players on your box.

It'd be nice in many ways. People with similar interests would
naturally be able to help each other out more. It'd make it pretty
reasonable to advertise files without advertising them to the world.

It would utterly foil the RIAA.

Anyone know of anything like this? Or heard of it being developed?

Sean

The voting thing is a tough problem. Some of what you're looking for can
probably be done with a system like Direct Connect
(http://www.neo-modus.com/), which lets you run your own server and
network. Just limit membership to people whose musical tastes you like. :)

Translation: AEC is throwing an all-night outdoor and would like you to
come. Email <aeclubsyou@hotmail.com> for more info.

DJ's will be  in Alter-ego form, like Candy AndyW, or something like that.
Osby may (or not) be some crazy Goth Kid.

Sounds like fun.

Subject: [sfraves] Adobe Acquires Cool Edit Pro

--=====================_2160569==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Received the following from a friend.  I also understand Adobe will no 
longer offer Premiere for the Mac.


INTRODUCING ADOBE AUDITION!


Syntrillium Software and Adobe Systems Incorporated are delighted to announce
the introduction of AdobeR Audition(TM) software, the essential tool for
professional digital audio! Adobe Audition is a re-branded release of Cool Edit
Pro, which we expect to begin shipping in late August 2003.


Visit http://www.adobe.com/audition for more information.


Read on to learn how you can upgrade to Adobe Audition!


In May 2003, Adobe acquired the technology assets of Syntrillium Software,
including its flagship product, Cool Edit Pro. Adobe is excited about 
continuing
to develop Adobe Audition as the digital audio tool of choice for musicians,
audio professionals, and video professionals. Adobe Audition includes all 
of the
mixing, editing, mastering, effects, and analysis tools from Cool Edit Pro 2.1,
as well as thousands of royalty-free loops (including many from the Loopology
Web site). Integration with Adobe's video products has been added too.


As a customer, you have helped make Cool Edit a success. Your passion,
commitment, and enthusiasm-as well as your participation in the Cool Edit
community-will continue to be essential to our team. We hope that you'll 
upgrade
to Adobe Audition:


  Own Cool Edit Pro 2.x? You're eligible for a complimentary update to Adobe
Audition when it becomes available in late August! Visit
http://www.adobe.com/audition to find out when the product is available.


  Own Cool Edit 2000 or Cool Edit Pro 1.x? You can upgrade to Adobe 
Audition for
just $99(USD)! Just visit
http://www.adobe.com/store/products/master.jhtml?id=catAudition
to pre-order your copy today.


Upgrading entitles you to Adobe technical support, invitations to special Adobe
events, and more. We hope you'll join the Adobe family by upgrading to Adobe
Audition.


As part of Adobe's complete video solution, Adobe Audition is included in the
Adobe Video Collection, which also includes Adobe PremiereR Pro, Adobe After
EffectsR, and Adobe Encore(TM) DVD software. If you're looking to expand your
toolkit to include the most complete desktop video production solution
available, visit http://www.adobe.com/products/dvcoll to learn more about the
Adobe Video Collection.


Thanks for your support of Cool Edit, and we hope we can count on your future
support of Adobe Audition.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

Subject: [sfraves] .: Dirtbox Radio Tonight : Kirin, Abe Froman, and More :.

Hello my friends,

Yes, that's right, it's Sunday again.  And that means it's time for
another exciting episode of Dirtbox Radio.  Take a peek at this week's
special guests:

Kirin will be dropping in to start off tonight's show, from 7pm 'til
8:30pm EST, bringing along Final Scratch and tons of tunes.  For those of
you not lucky enough to catch him at the late Player's Ball in Bethesda
last month, be assured that he can throw down like a champ.

Abe Froman will be coming back to grace Dirtbox with his presence again
tonight.  He and his fellow crewmates are some of the hardest working
Junglists in the area right now, pumping out new CD's and crating around
some serious hotness.

Other guests for the night will be announced during the show, so make sure
to tune in, starting at 7pm EST, and running until Vindicut's Jungletrain
show @ 3am EST.  Big up the TX massif.

To tune in, go to http://www.dirtboxradio.com/listen.html, or click on one
of the following links.  Winamp is reccomended to tune in
(http://www.winamp.com).

64k - http://jungletrain.net/64kbps.pls
24k - http://jungletrain.net/24kbps.pls
webcam - http://glue.umd.edu/~odjallen/dirtboxradio/webcam.html
chatroom - http://jungletrain.net/chat.htm

Feel free to hit us up on AIM as well, at DIRTBOXRADIO.

As always, we are continually looking for new talent to showcase.  If you
spin any style of dnb, hip-hop, or breaks, holla@dirtboxradio.com, and
we'll sort ya out.

The next few shows will be full takeovers from the A.L.I.A.S., Roundtable,
R3, Syndrome, and Mantis Sound crews.  More TBA.

Much love to all of you, and I hope to see you in the chatroom tonight.

Ez,

I used to use an RCA jack with the one black headphone size jack on the other 
end. I'd plug that end into where the computer speakers are supposed to go 
and then the RCA end into the minidisc player. What ever you're playing on your 
computer transfers onto the minidisc, you just hit record and then stop when 
the track is over, you do have to watch over it and hit record and stop at the 
perfect times but surprizingly the quality sounded great this way for me. You 
have to listen by putting headphones into the minidisc player as well by the 
way. You can even record stuff off of internet radio this way, it reminds me of 
the old days when we recorded blank tapes :)

massv respect to everybody that came out to paradigm shift. total respects to 
ALL the djs who worked so damned hard to keep the vibe alive. this, at a rave 
which some were saying it was the best they'd ever been to or said it was  
the most well done they'd seen in a really long while. 
       although way overbudget and coming out with a low return, i'd also 
have to say it was one of the best raves i'd ever been to. not simply because i 
held the reigns on this mission, but because this rave had everything i wanted 
a rave to have and that's worth eating a loss in my opinion. I think the vibe 
was also great due in part that there were lots of energy foods available 
(which made people less cranky) and caffeine was made free and at the ready. 
caffeine, i feel, has always been a great and reasonable alternative to turning 
your brain's neuro receptors into mush from illicit drug use. remember your older 
sister just taking no-doz and water to that beach party in 93?

respects to the Hated In Middleschool Crew:
Chel-c Faith our hostess
Shifty
Meter
Natatat
Kenneth J. Sexton
Navigator
and everybody who worked to make this party a reality. 

respects to
Everybody involved with DEF in it's goals and ideals, everybody who's 
furthering west coast techno in their own way, and bringing a positive attitude 
towards change in our small scene.

keep a sharp eye open for the DEFSF mob to rally back for another night of 
bangin' techno, smiles, and positivity in mid september.

Subject: [sfraves] Jessica Grace Wing

I don't know how many of the people on this list have been around 
long enough to remember, but a beloved veteran of many a full moon 
rave has passed away.


============================
Jessica passed away Saturday, July 19th at home in Brooklyn. She was 
surrounded by family and loved ones.

We all deeply feel the loss of our talented, beautiful Jessica. It is 
incredibly difficult to comprehend losing one so young, vibrant and 
creative.

In addition to our thoughts and memories of the time we spent with 
her, she has given us music that will live on.

Her last project, into which she put a significant amount of time and 
creative energy as Jessica has always done, is a new opera entitled 
"Lost," a collaborative effort with playwright Kirk Wood Bromley. 
Jessica composed the opera's original score.

"Lost" is scheduled to open on August 9th as part of NYC's celebrated 
Fringe Festival

More information and a sampling of songs can be found here:
http://www.inversetheater.org/Productions/lost/info.htm

Please come to the show, and please download and listen to Jess's 
music, and pass it on to friends. As you know, that is what she would 
have wanted.

If you'd like to send your condolences to the family, the address is:
260 Hoyt Street
Brooklyn, NY  11217

Please forward this message to all who knew her and loved her.

--=====================_19396615==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Abundant praise to Sean, Chel-c and all of the DEF crew for throwing a 
totally awesome rave last night -- yes, "rave" in the very best meaning of 
the term.  Paradigm Shift was characterized by unselfish respect and care 
for guests;  a loving and peaceful vibe;  and a the growing reemergence of 
unity I have been feeling in the new underground revival in the Bay.

Experience has shown me time and again that a party is the reflection of 
the souls of the party givers.  DEF is a collection of lovely souls and it 
showed at this event.  Hospitality was in full effect with free fruit, 
water, and excellent vegan food.  Much care was given to details (make or 
break a party).  The decorations were very creative and playful.  Loved the 
altar with the dancing Furby, I guess it was, on top.  At first I thought I 
was having some "flashback" when I saw what looked like a small creature 
moving about:)

Music was excellent with some moving techno 2X4s.  Loved Forest Green vs 
Andy W.  Andy, as usual, was inventive and entertaining with skillful 
surprises on the decks.

Most impressive to me, however, was the passion for music and dance that 
motivates parties like Paradigm Shift.   If there is a shift here, and I 
believe there is, it is a movement back to throwing raves for the love of 
it all.  One is lucky to break even these days doing an event with high 
production values coupled with generosity towards guests.  The risks 
financially and otherwise seem to grow.  Fortunately -- and we should all 
be thankful for this -- there are those good promoters willing to embrace 
these challenges and give back to the community.

It gives me great joy, therefore, to welcome DEF to the mix.  The DIY 
spirit is far from dead with fresh blood like Sean and his crew in our 
community.  There is rebirth, reinvention, and regeneration of our 
underground "scene" going down right now, and the DEF crew is certainly a 
part of this paradigm shift.

Much love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] (3): A philosophical and theoretical framework of a scientific school
 or discipline within which theories, laws, and generalizations and the
 experiments performed in support of them are formulated 


Late Latin paradigma, from Greek paradeigma, from paradeiknynai to show
side by side, from para- + deiknynai to show.

Recognize. Those of you hay00g production krewes trying to capture that
'something' that you can never quite get to come through at your
parties... you should have been at Paradigm Shift taking notes.

To say the aboveground scene is missing something -- that's not quite
right. They're operating within the wrong paradigm, and it shows.

I've had the pleasure of attending a number of very good parties in the
last few months. I've been discovering psychedelic trance, grooving to
d&b, and ... well. We won't mention that brief stint of happycore. I'm
sure you all understand. Everyone has their embarrassing moments. ;)

It was nice to see that good ole techno could show me the way once again.

There's something about techno. I dunno what it is, but it seems like
every time I go to a party like this (the last one was Mindcontrol,
which also god mad props) I get this really great oldschool vibe -- a
feeling of energy in the air; something very positive and powerful you
just don't normally get, no matter how good the music is.

Massive props to all the DJs (including... was it Chris Jackson who was
just tearing it up at about 5-5:30 in the morning? And AndyW/Forest Green
just before that? Who got some people who were dancing all night to jump
right back to their feet and bust out all over again?), Sean and Chelc,
and everybody else who made that ... okay, I'll say it: /RAVE/ happen.

And now I'm going back to sleep.

"History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even
without being sure of 'history' it seems entirely reasonable to think that
every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a
long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time --
and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened." - Dr. HST

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "Friendster" for mp3s???

Sean --  I think we were talking about this the other month at that show
at the GGP Bandshell (i was on rollerblades).

<braindump>

Specifically, because of the betamax ruling being applied as case law
in other cases (or having the potential of being applied), it is basically
"ok" to share songs between friends. So for example the mixtape you make for
your friend(s) is ok as "fair use copying." Also similarly covered, I believe,
is educational and classroom fair-use copying. So the question is whether this
concept can be legally extended to degrees-of-separation networks like 
friendster where one is not broadcasting or sharing broadly, but rather,
sharing among "friends."

Of course, there have been legal decisions in the vicinity of this issue
which need to be watched closely, eg.:
http://news.com.com/2100-1025-1022462.html?part=dht&tag=ntop

Moving on to the tangibles of software: there already exists a project
called "Waste" which can easily form the basis of an encrypted, file sharing
network. Of course, I have a copy from before the time it got pulled. And
given its GPL status, I feel that I am legally within my rights to use and 
modify this software.

(For more info on "waste" and the surrounding controversy:
  http://news.com.com/2100-1032-1011585.html
  http://news.com.com/2100-1032-1012833.html
  http://news.com.com/2100-1032-1020206.html
)

One of the aspects of "waste" is that it is designed for small-scale sharing. 
It would be quite inefficient for large-scale sharing. But this could actually
be a benefit, since one could say "the engineers designed the code 
specifically for fair use copying, and not broadcasting." See it doesn't 
scale, just like friendster!

We should setup a "waste" network amongs us friends and start playing with it,
in our infinite spare time. In fact, some might say that this is what NPM is
working on nowadays. I wish I could find a paying job doing this though.

My main design issue right now is whether such a filesharing network would
"piggyback" as a separate but linked site along side friendster, versus
just being a standalone site with an attached encrypted filesharing backend.
(The foolioz at Frienster.com used to have port 3306 open for MYSQL access. 
That woulda been the easiest. No, I never tried to mysqldump their database, 
or at least I won't admit to hacking in public. My warning to you, though,
is be careful what you stick in frienster -- unless friendster has firmed up 
their shoddy security, I can't imagine a dedicated hacker not being able to
break into their site with ease in less than 24 hours of work.)

Another legal pondering: can the concept of "friendster file sharing" be 
extended to arbitrary "affinity networks"... that is, the group of "friends" 
comes together simply because they all listenend to the same song, or like the 
same group, or ... (an "unintentional community"). Imagine if Microsoft built
a friendster like network into windows media player, for example: you could 
get together and chat with whoever is currently listening to that same song,
or join in with people who like the same band, or ....

I'd imagine that legal challenges to "affinity file sharing" would equate
it to "broadcasting." The cool thing about a "friendster file sharing" network
is that you have demonstrated a specific intent-of-friendship with another 
user, at least at the level that one is willing to request/confirm/accept each 
"friend" like friendster does currently.

Babble babble babble.... this is a subject of some excitement for me.

PS: also relevant is the concept of "scale free networks"
http://www.computerworld.com/networkingtopics/networking/story/0%2c10801%2c75539%2c00.html
ponder this next time frienster.com is down -- it is theoretically impossible 
for frienster not to be down most of the time. A "frienster killer" would be 
quite easy to implement, IMHO. And it would have good uptime because it would 
use federated databases and/or reside in it's own failure-resistant, 
distributed, p2p network implementation.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my hat in to the electronic trance music.  
Seems no promoter is interested to support this bay area silicon valley 
producer. I've fought long and hard, the good lord (and you promoters) knows how 
much $ i've been spilling to try to make a difference..

all this time i've been trying to show people how live pa can be done without 
a dat or tape.  i've always believed our genre was headed to a death because 
there isn't an accurate representation of our music.  other genres bring out 
the gear that made the music, but electronic music brings out only djs. i wish 
someone would've at least check into what i was doing and give it a chance at 
their venue.  but they've all ignored it.. 

So now i will tell you how live pa can be done so that maybe some DJ out 
there thats in the circuit of getting booked can do it. it's simple, and will 
mesmerize your crowd.

I am publishing this over the net only to the sfraves list, because we are 
silicon valley, where innovation happens.

The Ideal Electronic Live PA...

All must devices must have midi
1. you must have a drum machine. I use the tr 909
program each pattern, to know where they are, memorize what makes the rolls, 
add lots of verity.
2. you must have a sampler. program your favorite samples
3 program a synth that has an internal sequencer such as the korg ea1
4. have a secondary drum machine for layered drum sounds such as another 
sampler or a tr808 with effects connected.
5. maybe have your laptop running cubase sx, or reason.
6. connect all devices making all timecode external except the main drum 
machine internal, changing appropriate midi channel
7. when you press "start" on your drum machine, all devices will sound off 
and should be in sync. 
8. all will play into the mixer. now you must control the mixer. and 
different elements of each device.
9. you have yourself a synth, this synth is your favorite synth, it's like 
your guitar synth, and you jam on this synth and show the crowd that you and 
this synth are one. and your crowd will love you.
10. your act is a combination of known patterns, knowing when to switch off 
devices or changing sequence within the devices, vocoders on and off connected 
to your favorite synth. (my favoirte synth i've been using is the nord lead)

for a sample of all of this in action, you must have broadband, click here:

there you have it...this is as real as it gets, and if only more people was 
exposed to this maybe we could've started something, maybe we would've been 
more respected and represented for electronic music as supposed to being 
followers of europe. they look down on us for not having culture, yet they are all 
using our computers. yes we've not been around as long as europe, but fuck that 
we are the capital technology hub of the world, and innovators of the fucking 
tv, computer, radio, and everything that makes entertainment happen. YES 
SILICON VALLEY AND YOU ALL LIVE HERE!!!!! dont you ever forget it.  all of us are in 
this sprit of technology...
So good luck to the scene... It was fun...

actually this is part disagreement part tangent.

ready?

my theory is this: electronic music inherits
traditions of composition and improvisation. producing
is all about composition. DJing is all about
improvisation. there's a core musicality required for
both roles, but being able to make the right choices
in a prepared way (composition) and in a spontaneous
way (improv) are totally different abilities.

live PAs have always seemed to me rather odd because
even tho I like the old-school jam session as much as
anyone the truth is that the technology involved in
making this music often tends to be persnickety and
particular. fine-tuning it in the midst of a sweaty
club or a full moon renegade often looks to me like
trying to crack a safe in the middle of an orgy --
there's a lot going on, and most of it detracts from
your ability to concentrate.

besides, even if you can get unique sounds that way,
doesn't it seem like the crowd deserves more of your
energy than that? after all, 303 fanatics aside, it's
not actually about the machinery...

Subject: [sfraves] Paradigm Shift: Major Props!!!


Abundant praise to Sean, Chel-c and all of the DEF crew for throwing a
totally awesome rave last night -- yes, "rave" in the very best meaning of
the term.  Paradigm Shift was characterized by unselfish respect and care
for guests;  a loving and peaceful vibe;  and a the growing reemergence of
unity I have been feeling in the new underground revival in the Bay.

Experience has shown me time and again that a party is the reflection of
the souls of the party givers.  DEF is a collection of lovely souls and it
showed at this event.  Hospitality was in full effect with free fruit,
water, and excellent vegan food.  Much care was given to details (make or
break a party).  The decorations were very creative and playful.  Loved the
altar with the dancing Furby, I guess it was, on top.  At first I thought I
was having some "flashback" when I saw what looked like a small creature
moving about:)

Music was excellent with some moving techno 2X4s.  Loved Forest Green vs
Andy W.  Andy, as usual, was inventive and entertaining with skillful
surprises on the decks.

Most impressive to me, however, was the passion for music and dance that
motivates parties like Paradigm Shift.   If there is a shift here, and I
believe there is, it is a movement back to throwing raves for the love of
it all.  One is lucky to break even these days doing an event with high
production values coupled with generosity towards guests.  The risks
financially and otherwise seem to grow.  Fortunately -- and we should all
be thankful for this -- there are those good promoters willing to embrace
these challenges and give back to the community.

It gives me great joy, therefore, to welcome DEF to the mix.  The DIY
spirit is far from dead with fresh blood like Sean and his crew in our
community.  There is rebirth, reinvention, and regeneration of our
underground "scene" going down right now, and the DEF crew is certainly a
part of this paradigm shift.

Much love,

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we
recognize our shared humanity."
-Pema Chodron

"It's taken me all my life to learn what not to play."

Subject: [sfraves] How to DJ right

Yo, I picked up a pretty good book the other day 
"How to DJ right - the art and science of playing records".  
A good book I would recommend to the beginner or novice.  
It includes the basics and then into some technical aspects of mixing.  It also includes cute illustrations, quotes from your favorite DJs, well written, lots of details.  Its not a hard back, but sturdy construction, cost me 15 bucks.
Not a bad read , pick it up.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What difference does it make? (Art of Live PA)

i've been following your posts over the past several months.  i've even 
taken the time to check out your site and listen to your sounds clips and 
view your video clips.

its obvious that you are passionate about what you are doing.  i can also 
see that you want to get out and show your stuff.  and i think that's 
awesome.

i just think you need to start taking some new avenues in promoting yourself 
and producing your material.  continuing to post here whining for people to 
book you isn't going to help much.  have you tried shopping your stuff 
around as a demo cd?  do you have promotional materials that are better 
designed than your website (which i'm sorry, it looks really amateur).  have 
you tried to get your tracks pressed on vinyl?  if so, have you actively 
pushed that material?  have you taken active steps in getting involved with 
local crews and helped throw parties?  have you tried to throw your own 
party?  have you tried to team up with other local producers and 
collaborated so that you can combine your energies in promoting yourselves?

just a few ramblings from me.  i'm an aspiring dj and if all i did was sit 
here and send emails in hopes of getting a booking....then i'd be going 
nowhere.  hit the streets, make connections, and pimp yourself out like a 
cheap hooker.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] How to DJ right

"how to dj right" is great, it's like one of those
classic late-90s Andy W rants that make you realize
playing records IS the meaning of life. if you've been
spinning a while you won't find any new information,
except perhaps in the turntablist section, but it's
still worth reading.

my favorite quote in there is the bit where fatboy
slim describes the key to finding good samples:

"I look for hair styles and beards on a band. If
they've got long hair and beards, they're likely to
make better records. Especially those big seventies
bands with eight of them in -- half white, half black,
and they look like they all take acid."

I might as well just nerd out like a muddafugga and
give you my second favorite quote, the definition of a
breakdown:

"This is where the song calms down and creates drama
by stripping away its elements until there's nothing
left (except perhaps a single string note, a German
woman having an orgasm, or the voice of God telling
you to take drugs)."

British people are funny. I think I'm gonna move to
England.

usually, it is not green anymore....it is solid, but also, sort of soft...the softer the sweeter...always wash the fruit before eating it....also, oh, nevermind. i saw something cool yesterday that was a treasure, but also, none of your beeswax. :)

You can tell because they plump when fully cooked, and explode into your mouth
like an all-beef-bukakke when bitten. Geri loves it when I say bukakke, noh?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What difference does it make? (Art of Live PA)

I just watched Jay Walker and Jack Buser play live, each on their own rig,
with no, read that NO DAT, and all hardware based sequencing. Guess what?
They blew the mutha fucking roof off of POW! that night. That tiny place was
JAMMED with people that were dancing away. I've seen Praxis tear shit up
live on stage at the DNA regularly. He's got people stomping around and
again - all hardware based sequencing and NO DAT. I think where you fall
short is the need to produce trance. Sorry - trance is dead here. Those that
listen to it are few and far between with most live acts being of the
psy//goa realm.

LivePA is well loved in this area and happens all the time. It just hasn't
worked out well for you... =/

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my hat in to the electronic trance music.
Seems no promoter is interested to support this bay area silicon valley
producer. I've fought long and hard, the good lord (and you promoters) knows
how
much $ i've been spilling to try to make a difference..

all this time i've been trying to show people how live pa can be done
without
a dat or tape.  i've always believed our genre was headed to a death because
there isn't an accurate representation of our music.  other genres bring out
the gear that made the music, but electronic music brings out only djs. i
wish
someone would've at least check into what i was doing and give it a chance
at
their venue.  but they've all ignored it..

So now i will tell you how live pa can be done so that maybe some DJ out
there thats in the circuit of getting booked can do it. it's simple, and
will
mesmerize your crowd.

I am publishing this over the net only to the sfraves list, because we are
silicon valley, where innovation happens.

The Ideal Electronic Live PA...

All must devices must have midi
1. you must have a drum machine. I use the tr 909
program each pattern, to know where they are, memorize what makes the rolls,
add lots of verity.
2. you must have a sampler. program your favorite samples
3 program a synth that has an internal sequencer such as the korg ea1
4. have a secondary drum machine for layered drum sounds such as another
sampler or a tr808 with effects connected.
5. maybe have your laptop running cubase sx, or reason.
6. connect all devices making all timecode external except the main drum
machine internal, changing appropriate midi channel
7. when you press "start" on your drum machine, all devices will sound off
and should be in sync.
8. all will play into the mixer. now you must control the mixer. and
different elements of each device.
9. you have yourself a synth, this synth is your favorite synth, it's like
your guitar synth, and you jam on this synth and show the crowd that you and
this synth are one. and your crowd will love you.
10. your act is a combination of known patterns, knowing when to switch off
devices or changing sequence within the devices, vocoders on and off
connected
to your favorite synth. (my favoirte synth i've been using is the nord lead)

for a sample of all of this in action, you must have broadband, click here:

ctnow.com/media/Reflector_Agenda.wmv</A>


there you have it...this is as real as it gets, and if only more people was
exposed to this maybe we could've started something, maybe we would've been
more respected and represented for electronic music as supposed to being
followers of europe. they look down on us for not having culture, yet they
are all
using our computers. yes we've not been around as long as europe, but fuck
that
we are the capital technology hub of the world, and innovators of the
fucking
tv, computer, radio, and everything that makes entertainment happen. YES
SILICON VALLEY AND YOU ALL LIVE HERE!!!!! dont you ever forget it.  all of
us are in
this sprit of technology...
So good luck to the scene... It was fun...

Greetings carbon-based lifeforms!

>> JOSH WINK 'Profound Sounds v2' - OUT NOW! <<
http://www.systemrecordings.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=62

2xCD includes DJ mix CD + Bonus EP featuring some of Wink's biggest tracks!
+ View Wink tour dates at: http://www.systemrecordings.com/tourdates/
+ Enter to win a Final Scratch system: http://www.systemrecordings.com/

Critics are using words like "brilliant" and "revolutionary" to describe
'Profound Sounds v2'. But don't take our word for it, Here's what the
people
are saying...

+++++
"OMG!!!!! By far the best mix of the year! By far the best mix of the year!
It has been a very long time since I have bought a cd and loved every track
on it. Come to think of it the last cd I bought like that was PSv1. Josh
MAD
PROPS on an amazing cd you are such an inspiration!!"
+++++
"PSv2 is DA BOMB!!! AWESOME!!! I was just lucky enough to get my hands on a
copy of Profound Sounds v2, and it was WORTH THE WAIT!!! If ever a DJ stood
for quality over quantity its Wink. He doesn't just toss one off, he makes
it as good as he can."
+++++
"The perfection of this CD is that Wink gives you exactly what you need to
hear. You can attentively listen to it or simply let it slip into the
background of your life. It never attempts to exhaust the listener and
keeps
the music fresh throughout. The CD is a worthy buy; I can promise you it
can
be listened to for hours and never fail to leave some aspect unexplored."
+++++
"This mix is so smooth! The intensity builds very gradually but it always
remains interesting. This is a very effective way of capturing the
listener.
You can feel the tension starting to build. The mixes are sometimes rich
and
textured, and often smooth as a chocolate swirl. It depends on what Wink
wants you to feel. It's a beautiful thing."
+++++
All i can say is HELL YEAH... You've done it again Josh... Made my head bob
and my ears happy w/ the sounds of great music.. Id say keep up the good
work, but so far I haven't heard anything you've done that's bad work.."
+++++
To those who haven't heard PS v2, GET OFF YOUR BOOTY AND GO BUY IT, THEN
SHAKE YOUR BOOTY ALL THE WAY HOME TO THE SOUNDS OF A MASTER LIKE WINK..."

STREET TEAM:

System Recordings is looking to expand its current street team with your
help! This is a great way to get involved in the music industry and get a
few perks along the way - all the while enjoying the music that you love!
Street Team responsibilities include passing out flyers/stickers/magazines
etc and putting up posters at events, servicing local retail and lifestyle
locations (cafes, clothing stores, skate shops, record stores, college
campuses etc) with System materials, setting up listening parties and more!

We are asking for as much or as little time as you can commit, but the
perks
are certainly relative to your time! This is a great opportunity to get
involved with a fast-growing record label and help grow your resume at the
same time.

This is a NON-PAID position.

If you're interested, know someone who is, or have questions, write us at
teams@systemrecordings.com

Lack of booking isn't necessarily due to your format.  It could be based on 
talent, or lack thereof.

Anyone going?  So far, I'm having trouble finding reviews of what he's

if it's worth the $16 and hiking my ass up to the city in the middle of

Subject: [sfraves] Dancing to Latin (in Oakland) was Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Celia Cruz

Ah, I discovered some Latin music last week in Oakland, at Noche De Vaqueros
(Latin Cowboy  night). For some reason, perhaps trying to stay happy (and
thin), I have been dancing a lot lately. Not partying too hard here, just
dancing hard all last week at:

Estuary on Monday night (at Masses, in Pleasanton)
Noche De Vaqueros (The Latin cowboy party, on Wed)
Reform Skool at The Stud (Thursday)
Fashion show & dance at the Noodle Factory (Friday)
Underwear party in Hayward at the Turf club (Saturday)
(P.S. it's fun to dance in sexy silk boxers)

Now I'm ready to start all over again at Masses.

Anyway, about that Latin music, I had SO much fun. I don't speak a lick of
Spanish, didn't understand the words to the songs, but boy was it good for
dancing.

I wore my Roper cowboy shirt, Stetson cowboy hat, and just got into the
spirit of things. I even had a large Latin cowboy try to dance with me. (by
the way, there were many cowgirls, too). I was shaking that booty all over
the floor, even moved to the middle of the action.

Wow, I stayed until closing (2 am). I am not familiar with the Latin genre,
but apparently on this night (Northern Cal's only Latin cowboy night), they
play Cumbia, Banda, Nortena, and Ranchero music. (whatever the heck that
stuff is).

I missed Naomi's drag show at 10 pm, but I came to dance, not watch the drag
queens.

I don't know my inspiration, but if might have been news reports about the
Queen of Salsa, may she rest in peace, because I think I understand her
spirit now (the essence of latin soul).

I've had a lifelong affection for Latin music and, in particular,
salsa.  The "Queen of Salsa,"  Celia Cruz, passed last week.  A great loss
to anyone who loves music.

pluses and minuses of little school girl skirts....many styles to choose from these days, because they are classic and totally trendy:
classic style number one: school girl skirt...basic, thick fabric, pleats and plaid...multiple colors to choose from...
trendy style number one: closes with velcro, is short...comes in small, medium or large rather than number sizes...thin fabric, costs more than all of them except for one style i saw with a medium ranger price..mostly ill fitting, only good for a costume...highly unusable, but apparently are selling sometimes....
new age style number one: skirt with shorts..available in high quality fabric and design or in the cheapo, wear it once design too...so many options for the collector these days. :)

Geri, you really creep me out sometimes. How long have you been
'collecting'?

Tossing my shit in to the ring-

(but i comment only cause ive known about you for a
long time)

I dunno- I know you've tryed to focus on the "i'm
really live" aspect- but I think your song structure
is just kinda not there-

Like- just cause you're hand-playing that arrpeggio
cheese synth line doesnt make the song any more
palateable.

Not that I'm any master in this area, but certain
songs evoke emotion in me- songs a built from tension
and release.
Unfortunaely I've been "blessed" with the ADHD that
doesnt allow me to ever really complete anything; but
I'm guessing you must have some songs that do these
same things to you-
Listen to them- study them.
Break them down in to exactly what it is that makes
the hair on your back stand up when you hear them-
Im talking about the pure SQ-wave 303 1-bar breakdown
in Voodoo People-
The 3-bar drum-mixup progression at ~1:20 in the Chem
Bros remix of their own Music Response.

Those are just a couple sections that take me to a
differnt place; I don't think you've discovered yours
yet...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What difference does it make? (Art of Live PA)

A couple of years ago, my live PA duo was having similar problems. 
We'd go to promoters, say, "Look, we're doing deep house, LIVE- don't
you want to see that?", and they'd go "Uh, we book dance music here,
you know, DJs?".  We'd come back saying, "Yeah, we know- we make dance
music, live, with electronics and live instruments together.", and
they'd still be saying, "Oh, maybe you don't get it- the music we book
here is dance music, you know, like house?"

So apart from a few brave promoters (mainly good friends), we were
largely ignored- until we turned our sights on production.  We put out
a single, it got a little press and some people got to hear it, and we
started getting booked a little more.  We've put out a second now, and
it's picking up steam, little by little.  We're not actively seeking
bookings for live stuff right now (focusing on the next single and the
album), but we still get offered the odd thing here and there, and feel
very lucky for that.

I would say, as a person who has tried to push the live PA thing for a
few years, the best thing you can do is have something to put in a
promoter's hands- a live demo, say, or a 12" of a killer track you've
produced.  If you can come to them with a bit of precedence set, that's
far better.  Just like a DJ needs a good mix CD and a 'lil bit of a
"resume" of events they've played to get better bookings, a live act
needs some "money" to put where their mouth is.  If your music is great
and there's a market for your style of music in a given area, you've
got a good shot.

Even still, support or no support, make music if it makes you happy. 
The more I've gotten my head wrapped up in the success or failure of my
music, the more weary and uninspired I've been.  When you can strip all
that away and get back to doing it for the reasons you did when you
started (i.e. love of music), the rest will come naturally.

First of all Quitters don't lose, and Losers don't quit!
Second, This is a hard industry to be in. Times are tough for everyone. As a 
producer you should be focusing on pumping out as many tracks as possible. 
Shit I wish I had that ability. Get those tracks out to labels, Its up to you, 
but let me just say this, If your in the industry JUST for the money Yea get 
out, If you truly love dance music, Suck it up like everyone else and enjoy it. 
As an "artist" you now get to enjoy the Top Raman dinners that so many of us 
eat. LOL! Really, don't quit, Its a bad habit to start! Good luck, 


                             Gianni  ;0)      <-------Has been easing a lot 
of Top Raman

I can't tell if that was candykid speak or l33t speak. Funny. Candy kids and
the hacker crowd type quite similarly when posting... is there a
correlation? =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What difference does it make? (Art of Live PA)



If you are doing live stuff, it really helps to have a niche.  I do a live
set with a friend, and we work well at chill rooms at psytrance parties...
I dunno, we just work well there.  We don't aspire to be in the main room,
and we don't aspire to make it big.  We just have fun with it.  And we
enjoy it.  And we get people's groove on in the chill room.  

Find your niche and go with it...

And it certinaly helps to be a part of the production crew... a part of
the scene.

does anyone else think it's funny that someone posted a while back asking
about a rumour they heard; something about Atlantis losing their venue....
if i remember correctly a couple people jumped down their throat for posting
a rumour like that... and of course the people throwing Atlantis chimed in
and dispelled the rumour...

and then low and behold the party got postponed.... coincidence?

Actually, ::jumping in on the speculation bandwagon::, I'm guessing that
Ron's in quite a pickle right now, I don't think he's gonna make anywhere
near a house off this party. I don't think he's gonna make much really. I
think he's just trying to not lose his ass on this party.

And, think about it, you have $100K or more invested into a party, and
ticket sales/ venue drama cast doubt on your party, are you gonna
introduce more doubt into the event by spilling the beans, or are you
gonna try to keep the event as rumordly positive as possible so ticket sales
don't go into the toilet.

Of course, I may be wrong, just trying to get into the head-space of a
massive promoter.

I can't wait to wear it, got a cute top too. all for $15, but I am not telling you where, gerri, because too many people know about the "Panty Pile" now.

ours were blue and grey. so we had to spice it up with snazzy shorts underneath...hanging upside down from the jungle gym to show off to the playground...like a rush of blood to the head....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What difference does it make? (Art of Live PA)


I'm in agreement with George on this.  Making tracks, getting demos out
there, and soliciting feedback from listeners is vital.  Not only to your
bookings, but to your quality as well.

The music industry is populated.  Every Dj, performer, band and live act,
is (in one way or another) in competition with each other.  Competition
for people's attention probably being number one.

I think we are lucky in the rave scene to have people involved that are
interested in working together and collaborating to achieve goals that
will help the group.

Another suggestion that tends to work really well in this scene is DIY.
If you think you've got it going on, put an event together and show it.
Get some other performers and dj's that you respect together and suddenly
you've got a venue to do whatever you want with.

Personally, I think it's great that we're seeing more and more live
performances popping up.

Good luck.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] short skirts...with or without built in shorts nrr

If I can remember from my private-school skirt chasing days, the only
green uniformed skirt is St. Lawrence Academy (I'm from SJ). the 2 main
schools down here were Blue (Presentation) and Grey (Notre Dame). Most
everything else was blue or red.

I thought it was funny how their parents would drop them off with their
skirts down to their kness, then when the boys would visit for lunch
they'd hike 'em up to their ass.

Good times, good times =)

maybe it didn't work the first time...apologize if you get two copies..i was most definitely a catholic schoolgirl...i still am....
ours were grey and blue...had to jazz it up with snazzy 80's shorts underneath...we'd show them off to the playground while dangling from the jungle gym...wearing our double'd up neon socks. fun times....

i've seen kids with rolled up skirts here, but no one rolled their 
skirts where i went.  one of the schools i went to made us wear 
matching plaid berets.  that was the gayest thing ever.  those 
wound up stuffed in lunch boxes unless the nuns were watching.

Reflector,

Don't give up.. it would be sad for the elec music scene to lose someone who
really respects the technology and the music. Also I think it's awsome that
you gave us a little "how to". When I first started looking into doing live
pa I found it nearly imposible to find any info on how to do it, except by
using a dat tape or ableton live. Have you ever thought of writing a larger
"how to", it would be a great addtion to the scene.

ps. for Giles: Nikola Tesla atcualy invented the radio in America, see the
1943 court decition

Peace,
Mystic

friend whether that be you neighbor, your classmate or that cute barista =
that just hooked you up with a tripple venti caramel macciato.

Check your seriousness at the door. Turn your goof on and come ready to =
throw down silly style!

11:30pm - 06:00am
Located 20 minutes from Berkeley in the EastBay

Alright.. I know I am not the only one who is reading this stylish discourse 
on the requirements of modern day hispterdom.. but they are throwing some 
big ass party in SF on Thursday and I hadn't seen anyone bring it up.  Is 
there a DJ list anybody knows of ???  I just subscribed but my friend who 
had subscribed got three invitions so I am going with her.  It will probably 
be some cheesy corporate party.. but what if it's not.. I kinda stoked.  
Reviews forthcoming :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] old skool still fairly new nrr

not only is 4 or 5 years a long time,.. but also, the music itself has this 
incredible ability to change so much over a short period of time. Trance 
alone has definitely come a longgggggg way. Even though a lot of it is oober 
cheesy nowadays, every now and then comes out a pretty descent track that 
eventually becomes a classic. Gotta love the music :)

How to get a marina.girl

Scan a $20 bill front and back. Have your friend at kinkos run them on a
Canon fiery on high cotton content paper. Make about $500 worth and print
them front and back (duplexed) and cut them out. Wrap a real $20 bill around
the fakes and conspiquously flash your money clip while buying drinks. Dress
like the uber scenester from Ruby Skye. They'll flock to you like flies to
shit. But who wants that?

All of my credit cards have less plastic than a single marina girl.

hey thanks Mystic.

it was actually William Hewlett and David Packard that were messin around in their garages and built the resistance-capacitance audio oscillator in their garages here in Palo Alto which gave ways to the radio...

By the way i'm going to give you guys the truth, if it's dealing with trance, people won't listen to you if you're not from Europe. I feel like i'm battling a war with a handicap - that i'm not in Europe.  Warner Brothers has shown interest, Columbia Records loves my tracks and think it's commercial and a hit, but i'm not from Europe.  so for those who say to write better songs, either you've not heard my new songs, or you are pre-judging without really knowing. 

Thanks for all your love..and your hate. You all make the world go round...

that's surprising, actually, given all the support
that Warner Brothers and Columbia have shown for the
scene.

not so fast .. hate to nitpick, but ..  
http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blradio.htm
"
Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian inventor, proved the feasibility of radio 
communication. He sent and received his first radio signal in Italy in 
1895. By 1899 he flashed the first wireless signal across the English 
Channel and two years later received the letter "S", telegraphed from 
England to Newfoundland. This was the first successful transatlantic 
radiotelegraph message in 1902.

(Note: Nikola Tesla is now credited with having inventing modern radio; 
the Supreme Court overturned Marconi's patent in 1943 in favor of Tesla.) 
"
"
The first time the human voice was transmitted by radio is debatable. 
Claims to that distinction range from the phase, "Hello Rainey" spoken by 
Natan B. Stubblefield to a test partner near Murray, Kentucky, in 1892, to 
an experimental program of talk and music by Reginald A. Fessenden, of 
Brant Rock, Massachusetts, in 1906, which was heard by radio-equipped 
ships within several hundred miles.

In 1915 speech was first transmitted across the continent from New York 
City to San Francisco and across the Atlantic Ocean from Naval radio 
station NAA at Arlington, Virginia, to the Eiffel Tower in Paris. There 
was some experimental military radiotelephony in World War I between 
ground and aircraft..

Subject: [sfraves] Review and future BSP: ESTUARY -- somewhat long, but very informative.

Hey all,

I'm not normally someone who posts on here, though I go out alot.  Whether
it's DNA, Sitio, NHC, Tenderloft, 550, Moksha parties, other parties, etc.,
rarely will I make a post.  I've always had fun at those places (most of the
time), so don't get me wrong.

However during this past Monday night, I had an AMAZING time at this
bar/club out in Pleasanton.  The night is called ESTUARY. OK, first I was
concerned that it was too far.  45 minutes to drive on a Monday can be a bit
rough, but it is SOOOO worth it.  I can't stress that enough.

Here are a list of things that make this place wonderful:
1) Security is really friendly and nice.
2) They serve dope and reasonably-priced food for a bar.
3) It is a LARGE space -- could easily fit 200 to 300 people.
4) There is FREE pool!!!!
5) There is a huge outside smoking area furnished with chairs and tables.
6) The people there are SOOOO cool.  I met all these new people who were
great: Happy, Damien, Michelle, Chris, Dave, Karen, KJ, Nate, Jacob, Greg,
Tom etc. etc. (plus my wonderful group of friends who happened to be there:
Graham, Jessica, Audra, Penny, Brandon, Monique, Teks, John and Marcine).
7) There are OPEN DECKS from 9 until 2AM!!!!  (with one hour set-aside for a
headliner)
8) Long Islands that should be called STRONG Islands and they cost ONLY $2!
9) It's FREE to get in.

I was in such awe when I got there.  I wasn't expecting much, but made about
some new friends, got to hangout with alot of people, got to throw down some
breaks, got to see some friends spin and also got to see Marcine play some
kickass D&B (she was the head-liner that night).

Another highlight of the night:  Kicking Brandon's (DJ Bam) butt in
foosball... 9-0.  :-)

If you guys have not checked out the place yet, set aside some time on this
upcoming Monday.  You won't regret it.  If you are a DJ, show up early and
try to get an Open Deck slot.  I warn you though, the slots go quick.

I just have to say thanks to the people who throw ESTUARY for really making
the place so welcoming and wonderful.  You guys have a goldmine out there.
They've been doing this for a month and are going pretty strong (for being
out in Pleasanton).  If things continue well, they'll move to Thursday
nights!

(Scroll down to see details for ESTUARY.)

Much love,

Tom Lee

Subject: [sfraves] review: Paradigm Shift

I don't like the Tenderloft.  *shrug*  I don't know why except that I feel
like it's missing something.

I loved the music at this party, start to finish.  Except I felt like our
scene wasn't paying enough respect when the promoter scheduled Chris Jackson
to play at 4am to close.  But it makes me happy that there's so much solid
talent in the slightly-above-underground that anyone would consider having
J-Bot and Clarity play the opening set.

Hell, even Deaks was playing at another party that night.  Choices,
decisions, random chance.  Deaks and Maya duo-handedly turned me on to
techno back in 1998 at a party another tekhead helped throw (sup Oracle).
God, I love SF.

...?  I'm still not sure why people in the area take for granted the talent
we have living in the bay simply because they live in the bay.  I've seen
horrible DJs get booked for good slots (like the most recent Overworld
party) when the grass is way greener in our front yard.

<3

n i c o

p.s. Anyone willing to sell me a used copy of Chris' tape "Lifeline"?  Mine
broke and I miss the tracks on that tape.

 Position 3. - Locking Legs The woman raises her legs higher and locks them 
around her partner. The higher she can raise her legs, the deeper the 
penetration because access to the vagina is easier. If she has the flexibility to lock 
her legs around her partner then she can contribute to his leverage by 
squeezing him close to her or just hold him with her thighs. Many men find that the 
feel of their partner's legs around them to be a real turn on. One significant 
drawback of this position is that some men find it results in hurried orgasms. 
For this reason we might suggest that you leave this position towards the end 
of your lovemaking.

Closing set isn't bad for that kind of party is it?

Anyway, yep, sorry to miss T-Loft, but Deaks/Cloudfactory was shiznizzy
off the hizzy.

Pro-renegade debauchery beach-style all around, and a classy
breakfast too =)

Sorry to be non-sequitor, but gotta give props to CF too.

Glad to hear there were good parties this weekend!

I have been to every night of Estuary so far, (since the premiere) and I
have really enjoyed it. I have a day job that requires getting up in the
morning but I just don't give a damn when it comes to some good dancing and
fellowship.

The work will get done and I can drink coffee.

Check it out, don't make any excuses, it's just sinful, too.

I mean, where else can you hang out with someone named "Devil?"

It's bad when there's only like myself and 2 other people listening to Chris
Jackson play records.  That's my gripe in a nutshell.  Why pay him to play
for 3 people?

Man, thank you all for writing me, I would write you all back individualy, but I am too drunk I had ONE drink, ONE! I always wanted to go to a private school myself, but damn, I was poor, I had uniform envy, like I was in girl scouts and my mom wouldn't buy me a uniform, EVEN WHEN WE SAW ONE AT A GARAGE SALE, I got a huge kick out of working at a movie theatre and actualy getting to wear a uniform. I loved the thing about the 80's shorts and the doubled up socks. Being poor was good though, my mom had the best line when I wanted some toy off TV, she would say "Why don't you make one?" so I would, and pretty soon my toys were way better than the "real" thing, and even at RISD, where it's supposed to be the most creative kids in the whole country, right? Kids would be all like "How do you do that? How do you know how to do all that stuff?" "I was "poor," baby, I can make anything out of anything!" I used to teach oil painting to rich kids in Cupertino, I felt kind of sorry for them,
 never getting to make their own toys.

That's awesome!  The best "toy" I ever made was my super-psychedelic TV paintbrush. 
It was actually just a magnet and we discovered that if you moved it over the TV
screen, it would make pretty colors.  Of course, it also irreparably damaged the TV.

So, does this mean Kraftwerk *won't* be performing? Because Karl Bartos
isn't even part of the group anymore. I'm not looking for a reason to
rag on Coolworld here -- I just know a lot of people that bought tickets
exclusively because they thought Kraftwerk would be performing.

Granted, this type of thing happens all the time with large-scale music
festivals, but seriously: how long have you known it was going to be
just Karl Bartos? You wouldn't have said Kraftwerk were performing just
to generate interest... right?

Thanks,

That's precisely what I thought when I saw the BSP and an announcement 
on another list that Kraftwerk's new album is finally out - Karl Bartos 
was the name noticeably absent from the Kraftwerk announcement. This is 
precisely the type of bullshit that kept me from buying an advance 
ticket, and despite what looks to be a good lineup, will prevent me 
from going at all. Not that I like massives much to begin with, but 
such marketing practices will NOT be supported by my pocketbook.

I'm sure Cyberfest will be a blast, even without Kraftwerk. Personally, 
it was hard for me to even imagine a bunch of kiddies getting down to 
"Autobahn" or whatnot, so I know that KW would've been the main 
attraction for a handful of us geezers anyhow. But this about seals the 
deal for me. I'm never believing promoters again. After getting burned 
on supposed appearances by Daft Punk, Groove Armada and others, I'm 
only going to rely on Pollstar to check booking accuracy for 
too-big-to-be-true acts from now on.

Coolworld Productions - here's a tip:  Next time, do the listing like 
this

	KARL BARTOS (Kraftwerk, Germany)

His name still carries enough weight with KW fans, and you'd get a 
helluva lot more respect from the bitchers and moaners (myself 
included) on this list and elsewhere.

Just to clarify a couple of issues, I'm going to post Karl's Bio so that you can read for yourself. If you still feel mislead, we extend our apoligies. However, Karl is performing as Kraftwerk and will be with his new band / group of musicians performing ALL KRAFTWERK hits & New Material.
 
If you would like to go to his own web-site and check it out, here is the address;

www.karl-bartos.de

Karl Bartos Bio:

Hardly any other name in German popmusic is as much a synonym for electronic lifestyle as Karl Bartos. Not only his work as a member of Kraftwerk, but also his co-operation with local and international artists show him as an icon of a worldwide movement in music. Now, the pioneer of electronic music is back to be heard and seen live. 

As co-author of known Kraftwerk titles as "The Robots", "The Model", "Pocket Calculator" or "Tour de France", Karl Bartos set the foundation for the world-wide success of German Techno-Pop a la Kraftwerk. Countless bands such as Depeche Mode, OMD, The Human League, but also the complete Techno-Dance movement never seize to stress the importance of Kraftwerk's influence on their creative work. 

Bartos belongs to the rare German Pop-icons who enjoy the highest international recognition. His authenticity as one of the founders of a particular German genre makes him as hip as ever. 

As a classically trained drummer and keyboarder, Bartos' influence is evident on the music of Kraftwerk. The godfathers of US-HipHop such as Africa Bambaataa & The Soul Sonic Force, but also the protagonists of the early Detroit Housegrooves have picked up his typical electro beats. With the international success of German Dancemusic, the quality of electronic lifestyle from Germany (co-founded by Bartos) is confirmed until this day. 

His activities as author and producer lead him to world-wide successful co-operations with OMD (Andy McCluskey) and Electronic (Bernard Sumner / Johnny Marr), The Mobile Homes (Sweden), and Anthony Rother and Deine Lakaien from Germany, as well as records of his own project titled "Electric Music". 

A suprise-gig as electronic DJ in August 1999 at the "Kickzone"-Festival during the PopKomm in Cologne gained him excellent critics for Bartos the starting-signal for new live plans. 

Accompanied by a keyboarder Bartos' live-set is composed of newly arranged solo-titles and some premiers. Thus "Man Machine", "Metropolis", "Techno Pop" and "The Telephone Call" have never been performed live before further Kraftwerk songs have been digitally optimized for stage conditions. The previously unreleased track "15 Minutes of Fame" will be complemented with further new compositions, inspired by the atmosphere of a live audience and set to be captured on an upcoming album. 

Visually Bartos will be supported by the work of Cologne video artist Karsten Binar who created video loops, illustrating on big TV screens the classics of Electro-Pop bartos live.

I've heard that the REAL kraftwerk does a shitty, all-off-laptop prerecorded
"live" show these days anyway.  Maybe Karl will be better.  Maybe he will
drag a modular synth on stage if you are lucky.

Of course we still feel misled!  Your current BSP says "Kraftwerk's 
Original Member Karl Bartos" - but in the previous round of hype, it 
was listed simply as KRAFTWERK.

While he will surely play a great deal of Kraftwerk songs, he is not 
performing AS Kraftwerk, he is performing as Karl Bartos. Those of us 
who know Kraftwerk, Bartos, and his music are well aware that he was 
the brains and talent behind it all. (Listening to the lackluster new 
Tour de France 2003 is proof enough!) However, that doesn't mean you 
can advertise the headliner as "Kraftwerk," which you had done before 
the full lineup was officially announced.  Some of us actually WERE 
interested in the boring, robotic live official Kraftwerk experience.

Here's an example of proper promotion. Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode is 
currently touring. Half of his set is comprised of classic DM tunes. On 
no bill or marquee or poster or pre-sale email or festival lineup does 
it list "Depeche Mode" as the act. Why? Because it would be dishonest.

Another example: Trey Anastasio of Phish is recording and touring as... 
Trey Anastasio!  How novel is that? We all know he'll play a lot of 
Phish tunes, the audience is mostly Phish phans, but guess what? It's 
not Phish!

Nice site. And if you click on the "LIVE" portion of the site, there's 
a small facsimile of the poster for his London gig, which clearly says 
"KARL BARTOS" across the top.

I understand CWP's position and the talking-up it requires to be a 
successful promoter. I'm in marketing, have done a fair bit of 
promotional work myself, and know how brutal the market is out there, 
especially now with people spending less on events than they used to. 
But there's no rationalization for lying to the people whose money you 
rely on, especially when you have recurring events and hope to keep 
bringing us back.

Omid, no one is trying to falsely market you. I'm sorry that you feel that way. We are producing a show, Karl Bartos is performing as Kraftwerk with his new band.
 
It's not that far fetch since he's doing the same thing in other markets.
 
Coolworld isn't trying to make you believe something that isn't happening, thus were completely upfront with you on this list and on our advertisements.
 
The first initial emails you read were not meant to mis-lead you, hence we've been very forthcoming and have billed the artist and group appropriately.
 
In addition, lets not jump to conclusions on intentions, as i know nothing has been marketing with malice or ill intent.
 
If you would like to discuss this off list, i would be happy to answer any questions.
 
Thanks for your time...
 
COOLWORLD

Monique, Coolworld has been around for 13 Years. Although we've have had our share of complications and political problems, we've never out right cancelled. 
 
The Cow Palace, has been a Coolworld staple since the early 90's.
 
This is the 11th Annual CYBERFEST Music & Arts Festival and will be one of the most incredible events in northern california. 
 
Feel free to do all the research you want too....the venue is credible and safe.
 
Tickets can be purchased at the Cow Palace Box Office right now for $25 with no Service charge....
 
Any other questions, dont hesitate to ask.
 
Coolworld

No doubt Karl Bartos is an awesome musician. Not only did he do some
incredible work with Hutter, Schneider and Flur as Kraftwerk, but he's
also done some really interesting collaborations with members of New
Order and The Smiths. And some of his newer stuff is being distributed
by Kompakt, one of my favorite german "tech-pop" labels.

HOWEVER, Karl has not -- to my knowledge -- had anything to do with (or
performed as) Kraftwerk for over 11 years. I find it really hard to
believe that the remaining (and founding) members would give the rights
to the band name to him for the purpose of performance... Otherwise you
wouldn't be saying "Kraftwerk's Original Member Karl Bartos" -- you'd
just be saying "Kraftwerk".

Furthermore, Karl is *not* an original member of the band; in fact he
was the *last* of the four to join the ever-fluctuating roster before
the '74-'86 string of hits that put them on the map. I'm not trying to
downplay his significant contributions to the band, but saying he's an
"original member" is just factually inaccurate.

Sorry to split hairs here, but I really think your use of Karl's name
and that of Kraftwerk so interchangably is very misleading. I would
appreciate it if you changed the BSP. Omid's suggestion of "Karl Bartos
(Kraftwerk, Germany)" is much more appropriate, IMO.

Subject: [sfraves] re: pangea, friday night...

(sorry if this went through twice - i'm not sure if i
fucked up the first time or not.)

so... i'm considering attending this party because 
t-1000 is playing at it and if you haven't heard him
yet, he fucking rocks, off the hook.  but i don't
know... the party invite/announcement is just so damn
cheesy - arrive dressed in your porn star best? 
basically sounds like a bunch of guys want to see
women/girls dressed scantily, because what guy is
going to really do this?  i don't have a problem w/
people dressing sexy (although wouldn't "porn star
best" be naked?), but it just strikes me as a way for
guys to see more girl-flesh w/o really putting out
themselves, and putting pressure on girls/women to
dress up.  i could be wrong about this, but i don't
know... anyway, at least i'll get to see t-1000 at dna
and then if he really, really rocks, well, maybe
then...

but there's just so much to do friday night!  why is
it that it all seems to be happening then?  u-ziq at
the bottom of the hill, legends of house at club six,
some techno thing at rawhide, a spaz/5lowershop
party... what to do, what to do?

Subject: [sfraves] paradigm shift review...

so... i probably should have stayed home cuz i needed
the rest, and i'd cut my foot swimming and was limping
around :(  but... i needed to dance and i need my
techno fix so i went to check this out.  was it worth
it?  well, i really enjoyed forest and andy w
tag-teaming.  got to dance for a while, and it was
great because they actually played some detroit and
were mixing different styles together.  but the rest
of the time?  i found the music rather boring -
straight-ahead techno, all pretty similar.  don't get
me wrong - i LOVE techno, but i guess i've just got
different techno tastes than most of sf, alas.  

granted, i did miss clarity/j-bot and yap, all of whom
i'd wanted to check out.  don't know if they played
any differently.  

i did appreciate the effort that went into the party -
the food, coffee bar (!!!!!!), etc, tho' $15 still
seemed rather steep.

I was writing up my own reply but Shawn summed it up perfectly.  It's 
all pretty much semantics from here on out, and all I simply ask for is 
  accuracy in promoting. When good information is available, it's wrong 
not to use it.

In terms of CWP's repeated requests to take further inquiries off-list 
- I appreciate the effort to reduce list "noise" and squabbling, but I 
personally think that the integrity of BSPs are of interest to the 
community at large, no matter who they come from.

This thread is not about any sort of public mudslinging. As I've said, 
I'm sure this Cyberfest will be as good a time as 'fests of the past. 
However, I think the public discourse on what I (and others) feel is a 
misleading practice will only serve everyone.

You listening, other promoters? This isn't just about CWP, and I hope 
you don't feel singled out.  ;)

Coolworld -

If indeed you never intended to mislead anyone by advertising a single 
member of Kraftwerk as the entire ensemble, will you be offering 
refunds to those people who bought tickets believing they would be 
seeing the entire group?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] more on pangea...

Monika,

Nothing in the BSP made any mention of gender; both men and women can 
dress as porn stars, can they not?  Furthermore, no one is being forced 
or compelled to dress as a pornstar.  Given this, I fail to see any 
exploitation occurring in this instance.  In fact, it seems to me that 
Sintaxxx is actually interrogating traditional notions of gender, 
sexuality, and pornography with this event by de- and 
re-contextualizing pornographic imagery and icons in the context of an 
electronic music event.

Exploitation would be telling people that a certain act was performing, 
only to later reveal that in fact only a portion of the act would 
actually be in attendance.

--part1_2b.44aa06ca.2c503b76_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I just picked up this DVD called Intelect and It must be fairly new because I 
hadn't heard of it until I saw it the other day at Suncoast video. It a 
techno/progressive house documentary. They Interview like 60 house & techno DJ's 
about different people's opinion on what DJing is about and the what's all goes 
on behind the scenes in the industry. 
It's funny to see how pretentious and arrogant some DJ's are compared to 
other DJ's who are modest and are willing to explain exactly what it is that they 
do and how easy it really is. I mean they also tell you how hard it can be and 
certain situations that can happen that will be frustrating, which is 
understandable. 
There's this one guy who says he prefers to do his live set in another room 
or from the basement because all he does is twiddle around with knobs and 
program sounds on his laptop, and he doesn't understand why people always insist to 
see him play live lol hahahahah. See now that's modesty that guy is the shit! 
He spins from the fucking basement lol hahahaha while people dance on the 
upper floor. Actually I think he spins IDM music so they probably don't even 
dance but oh well I think that concept is hilarious. 
Then there's another disc which is a full hands on DJ instructional video 
with Nigel Richards and he is great. I mean he doesn't assume that you know 
anything about DJing at all, he explains even the most tinyest details about it 
that you probably already know but maybe someone else doesn't know. I it's like 
two hours full of every trick in the book about DJing from hooking up the 
equipment to beat matching and pitch control. At one point it seems like he is 
subtley making a reference to this little compartment on a tecnics turntable where 
you can keep an E pill... Is that true? 
Anyway I think this is the best yet rave related documentary, there's a 
really good interview with Mars as well as Dyloot where they even talk about the 
whole candy trance scene and It's hilarious to watch but they are really sincere 
people tho you can tell, I don't know why people talk so much shit about 
those guys. The movie start out a lil dry and boring but if you just let it keep 
going and keep watching it, it just keeps getting more interesting... and all 
the SF scene stuff is at the end of it. I don't think any other documentary has 
touched on the SF scene like this one yet. So check it out yo.

Subject: [sfraves] cyberfest/kraftwerk

it sounds like the kraftwerk thing might have more to
do with band breakup drama than anything coolworld was
responsible for. like he's the only KW member there,
and the other guys are doing work without him, yet
they say it's all Kraftwerk material and the set will
be recorded for a live album? will it be a Kraftwerk
live album?

that sounds like the noise you hear just before the
lawyers show up.

personally I've never been to a massive on that scale.
I might go just for the hell of it. :)

 Straight up, get dressed up in anyway you want. If you dont want to then dont. 
We are only about having a fucking great time. It is a shame that you think 
coming dressed up to party is exploitation. If you want I can get you drunk, 
naked fuck your brains out and put it over the web and charge 29.99 a month to 
old mid-western pervs to pull off too. So since I dont want to do that and we 
just want to have a good time, drop the assuming.

Subject: [sfraves] What difference does it make? (Art of Live PA): ATTITUDE MAKES THE DIFFERENCE!!!

   "Gianni  ;0)      <-------Has been easing 
a lot 
of Top Raman"


 Top Ramen, Mauchan, it's a, who ever has them 10 for a buck, kind of
economy. Not good for the bowels, but it streaches the $5 you have to get
through the week!



 "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my hat in to the
 electronic trance music.
 Seems no promoter is interested to support this bay
 area silicon valley
 producer. I've fought long and hard, the good lord
 (and you promoters) knows
 how
 much $ i've been spilling to try to make a
 difference.."


 If every starving artist had this kind of attitude, would we have art
today? Our art galleries would be empty, the book shelves in book stores
would have no books, and radio stations would be all right wing talk
shows!

 I know what it means to be discouraged, but there is something in me
that tell's me not to give up, even if it's a Top Ramen Noodle kind of
day.
 
 If you fail, is it you who failed, or are you blaming others? Here's the
cosmic deal. When you get up in the morning, you have two choices: face
the day with an attitude of fear and say you won't make it, or face the
day with an attitude of somehow, someway, I'll get through. I've made it
this far haven't I? Your personal reality is in your mind. Everything has
karmic consequences. If I choose to live in the attitude of fear, then I
will attract people and situations that will confirm my attitude. If I
choose to live in the attitude of faith, then I will attract people and
situations that will confirm my faith. I'm not talking about this phoney
"name it and claim it" faith, but real faith that recognizes life will
work out if we let go and let life happen in life's own time and own way.
I may not get every thing I want, but I know I'll get what I need. Maybe
what I need now may not be recognition or instant fame, but It may be
other things that pertain to the soul or what's going on inside me and
what's in my mind.
 
A famous prophet once said, "seek first the kingdom of god ( who ever
"god" is to you) and his/her rightousness, and all these things
(electronic music career) will be added to you.
 The electronic music scene is full of big $$$ rock stars and super stars
and people inspiring to be big $$$ rock/super stars, that, in my opinion
is one of the major reasons for the down fall or the rave scene and the
infusion of cheezy, mass produced electronic music. We have too many
D.J.'s inspiring to be big $$$ rock stars and very few in it for the love
of the scene and the people. Again, that cosmic law of the universe,
karma. If you go into this with an attitude to be famous and rich, then
you choose to be in that reality whose karma is competitive, cut throat
and the odds are against you. If you go in this with an attitude to give
my talents to the world and particularly the rave scene as an offering of
love and healing (boy do we need love and healers in these days!), then
you choose to be in that reality whose karma may not get famous and rich,
but will give you happiness and satisfaction, which all the money and
fame can never give you, and in time all these things "will be added to
you". If you get fortune and fame, you won't become an ass-hole about it,
which means if you are an ass-hole, you are not happy.
 
Maybe you need to stop fighting and start living. Just do it for the
love. You don't even know what doors will open for you if you do it
life's way! Karma, karma, karma!!!!

 Right now as I'm writing this, I have no job, the job market is tuff and
I have 2 months of unemployment left and the little money I get barely
pays the rent and I have a lot more 10 for a buck meals. Hopefully, EDD
will accept my schooling application which means I can go to school and
collect unemployment until April of next year. I may not get accepted,
but I try not to start my day in fear over this and my employment issues
because if I do, I will set in motion the karma consequences of fear and
I'll be like someone with a tire stuck in the mud,  spinning my wheels
out or frustration and anger, and in the end, having flat tires and no
gas (depression) and have gone no where. If I get rejected, I know life
has another way of taking care of me. Faith allows me to let go and give
life an opportunity to provide rocks, sticks, what ever I need to get out
of the hole.

 So, if you give up, that is your choice. Like Gianni sayz... "suck it
up!" We all have our problems and we don't get all we want, but we don't
give up. I can "suck it up" with Gianni because eventually it does work
out. May not be what we like or want, but things work out. Accepting that
is real faith. 

 I love to spin records, but I haven't bought records in 2 years! I have
a cheezy $75 shredder mixer and a turn table with a bad arm. When I moved
here from Arizona 3 years ago, my "D.J. career" came to an abrupt end. I
know people who recently bought nice $1,000 mixers, new 1200's and can
keep up their record collections. Am I depressed? Some times. But, thanks
to unemployment, I've had the time to ponder the mysteries of life, and
part of my spiritual awakenings is the realization that I know this is
happening for a reason. If I'm meant to have a "D.J. career", it will
happen when it's supost to happen and let it go. Faith is understanding
there is a reason for this to happen, and when I learn my lessons, it
will all come together for me again. I choose by my attitude what reality
I will have and the karma that it brings. If I come up again as a D.J.,
attitude will bring the karma for that to happen. Find your own
righteousness, and all these things will be added to you!

 Peace, Bodhi ^_^

Actually omid, no ones trying to sweep anything under the rug here, simply trying not to over sensationalize something that is in a difference in opinion, both professionally and personally.
 
I think 10 threads is pretty sufficient?
 
I admire your persistence and need to make sure Coolworld presents an honest depiction of it's event, so i simply asked you to take it on a private level. 
 
I don't think thats too much to ask?

If every starving artist had this kind of attitude, would we have art

would have no books, and radio stations would be all right wing talk
shows!

I know what it means to be discouraged, but there is something in me
that tell's me not to give up, even if it's a Top Ramen Noodle kind of
day.

If you fail, is it you who failed, or are you blaming others? Here's the
cosmic deal. When you get up in the morning, you have two choices: face
the day with an attitude of fear and say you won't make it, or face the
day with an attitude of somehow, someway, I'll get through. I've made it
this far haven't I? Your personal reality is in your mind. Everything has
karmic consequences. If I choose to live in the attitude of fear, then I
will attract people and situations that will confirm my attitude. If I
choose to live in the attitude of faith, then I will attract people and
situations that will confirm my faith. I'm not talking about this phoney
"name it and claim it" faith, but real faith that recognizes life will
work out if we let go and let life happen in life's own time and own way.
I may not get every thing I want, but I know I'll get what I need. Maybe
what I need now may not be recognition or instant fame, but It may be
other things that pertain to the soul or what's going on inside me and
what's in my mind.

A famous prophet once said, "seek first the kingdom of god ( who ever
"god" is to you) and his/her rightousness, and all these things
(electronic music career) will be added to you.
The electronic music scene is full of big $$$ rock stars and super stars
and people inspiring to be big $$$ rock/super stars, that, in my opinion
is one of the major reasons for the down fall or the rave scene and the
infusion of cheezy, mass produced electronic music. We have too many

You didn't read anything that was in response to your first post on this
subject did you? Writing in all caps whining for a promoter to book you just
because you're a live pa won't get you anywhere. If your music isn't up to
par for what people want to hear you aren't going to get booked. From what
I've heard, you just don't cut it. You try really hard and that's admirable
but that doesn't mean you're *good*  That's just reality. There are a lot of
musical acts out there that bust ass to get somewhere but complete suck ass!
That's just life and the business.

Now please - quit your bitching, write some better (different) music, get
INVOLVED with the scene and throwing parties or just fade to grey like
Visage...

karma. If you go into this with an attitude to be famous and rich, then
you choose to be in that reality whose karma is competitive, cut throat
and the odds are against you. If you go in this with an attitude to give
my talents to the world and particularly the rave scene as an offering of
love and healing (boy do we need love and healers in these days!), then
you choose to be in that reality whose karma may not get famous and rich,
but will give you happiness and satisfaction, which all the money and
fame can never give you, and in time all these things "will be added to
you". If you get fortune and fame, you won't become an ass-hole about it,
which means if you are an ass-hole, you are not happy.

Maybe you need to stop fighting and start living. Just do it for the
love. You don't even know what doors will open for you if you do it
life's way! Karma, karma, karma!!!!

Right now as I'm writing this, I have no job, the job market is tuff and
I have 2 months of unemployment left and the little money I get barely
pays the rent and I have a lot more 10 for a buck meals. Hopefully, EDD
will accept my schooling application which means I can go to school and
collect unemployment until April of next year. I may not get accepted,
but I try not to start my day in fear over this and my employment issues
because if I do, I will set in motion the karma consequences of fear and
I'll be like someone with a tire stuck in the mud, spinning my wheels
out or frustration and anger, and in the end, having flat tires and no
gas (depression) and have gone no where. If I get rejected, I know life
has another way of taking care of me. Faith allows me to let go and give
life an opportunity to provide rocks, sticks, what ever I need to get out
of the hole.

So, if you give up, that is your choice. Like Gianni sayz... "suck it
up!" We all have our problems and we don't get all we want, but we don't
give up. I can "suck it up" with Gianni because eventually it does work
out. May not be what we like or want, but things work out. Accepting that
is real faith.

I love to spin records, but I haven't bought records in 2 years! I have
a cheezy $75 shredder mixer and a turn table with a bad arm. When I moved
here from Arizona 3 years ago, my "D.J. career" came to an abrupt end. I
know people who recently bought nice $1,000 mixers, new 1200's and can
keep up their record collections. Am I depressed? Some times. But, thanks
to unemployment, I've had the time to ponder the mysteries of life, and
part of my spiritual awakenings is the realization that I know this is
happening for a reason. If I'm meant to have a "D.J. career", it will
happen when it's supost to happen and let it go. Faith is understanding
there is a reason for this to happen, and when I learn my lessons, it
will all come together for me again. I choose by my attitude what reality
I will have and the karma that it brings. If I come up again as a D.J.,
attitude will bring the karma for that to happen. Find your own
righteousness, and all these things will be added to you!

Peace, Bodhi ^_^

Do I really need to break out the cop uniform at this point ;-) I always
thought the posting limit was a guideline to reduce the massive traffic
this list used to have and general chatter.

The list has been chill lately, but as always this is the people's list.
Ya'll just let me know if things are becoming intolerable, and I can start
enforcing guidelines.

If I dare to even chime in on the CWP thread, I think those who clarified
the Kraftwerk issue are appreciated. You guys totally know your stuff
=) And CWP sufficiently explained their position as best we'll get on this
list. Aside from that, let's see how the party pans out.

I may actually be at Cyberfest too...we'll see.

<Of course we still feel misled!  Your current BSP says "Kraftwerk's 
Original Member Karl Bartos" - but in the previous round of hype, it 
was listed simply as KRAFTWERK.>
 
Ah, with all due respect, I was showing off the flyer with my friend in it and EVERYONE ( late 20's early 30's) was flipping out about Kraftwerk! People who would *never* go to a Coolworld show! One guy who would *NEVER* go to a rave, was all like "I want to see Kraftwerk!" ( I mostly go to ug's since scope closed and I think Coolworld Parties are fun, so sue me! ) And as a graphic designer, I don't know if I personaly would have chosen to phrase it EXACTLY the way it is on the flyer, but I have seen more misleading things from people bigger than coolworld, and I have also seen band members do EVEN MORE misleading things to the promoters, that have resultied in trashed press runs and recalled flyers for legal reasons ( NOT BY ME! This is why I am willing to explin to my client 300 times that we can't use SOMEBODY ELSE'S image. ) ! ( this is why I would have phrased it differently, see?) But you know, bands break up,  and there are disputes over names, it is just a fact of life.

man you ain't got the right to shit.

you want to represent the bay?

go make a hip-hop track.

this music is not about representing.

this music is about having fun.

having fun is not more important than success.

having fun IS success.

now go fuck yourself.

Subject: [sfraves] (Art of Live PA): karma, karma, karma!!!


  Like I said, karma, karma, karma!!!! If you want to get booked, do what
others have done and don't waste your energy spining your wheels in the
mud, give out liberaly C.D.'s and throw your own parties. I'd say, 75% of
known D.J.'s did their own parties when they were unknowns. Do enough and
you will get more attention. Your bitching is makeing your reality of
having a hard time coming up happen. Change your reality, and change your
karma. 

Want love? Give the love
Want to be cared for? Care for others
Want to stop the hate? Stop your hating (I can't get booked! It's someone
eles's fault for my situation!)
Want to get motivation toward you? Motivate yourself, like doing your own
parties!

Read again what I said.

Karma, karma, karma!!!

good points..someone else mentioned inner eye parties...how about all the silver pearl stuff too? or rather most of it..not all of it...quest...why can't we just discontinue the gross parts and keep the good? if things 
remain completely underground, it keeps things special, but also, if things are too hidden, then people 
can't thrive, and then things get shut down. there's a lot of good things going on these days. there are a lot of single event kind of things going on, and clubs galore are opening up too. it's kind of like a candy store. also too, just for the record, my taste in clothing has absolutely nothing to do with religion or anyone else's fetish of the moment.  :)

Not quite. Karl Bartos left (along with Wolfgang Flur) around '92.
Granted, Kraftwerk as a band hasn't put out anything worth listening to
since then (celebrity remixes of Expo 2000 nonwithstanding), but that
shit's old news. Breakup drama doesn't usually last 11 years, right?

But you're right in some respects, this is starting to sound like a
legal issue. Did Karl get booked as Kraftwerk (with the band's
permission), or is Coolworld just using his involvement with the group
to sell tickets?

Regardless, the man was one of the most influential members of the group
during their most prolific period. He had a hand in most of the tracks
that originally defined techno as a musical genre, ideology, and
cultural movement. So, if you're really interested in seeing your
favorite Kraftwerk tracks performed live by one of the "godfathers of
techno", you should still at least consider going. ;)

Just trying to be diplomatic,

Subject: [sfraves] SFR Sex Map - For the good of the community.

Hey all-

I've started up an SFR sex map that will keep track of
 who has slept with who.
As SFRaves grows as the beautiful community it is,
keeping track of the STD chain becomes a very
important thing.  STDs are real, and it's important
everyone be informed and knowledgable about everyone
here.

There's only about 20 names on it so far, and it's not
complete by any means so please send me any
information you have about anyone here and I'll add
them to the list.

You can see it here:

Be safe all- God bless!

Hmm... that's an interesting way to characterize it.  "A difference of 
opinion?"  A difference of opinion is whether or not you like chocolate 
or not; a difference of opinion is whether you vote Democrat or 
Republican (or Green, or what have you).  A difference of opinion is 
NOT the difference between the band, Kraftwerk, and one of its members. 
  That is a difference of fact.  Either all the current members of the 
band known as Kraftwerk will be at the Cow Palace on September 20th, or 
they won't.  If indeed Coolworld Productions knew that on September 
20th only Karl Bartos and not the other members of Kraftwerk would be 
performing and nevertheless advertised that Kraftwerk would be in 
attendance, that's LYING.  When corporate entities engage in this sort 
of behavior in television, radio, or print ads, it's known as false 
advertising.  In those media, there are laws and regulations 
prohibiting that sort of behavior.  Furthermore, if Coolworld 
Productions allowed tickets to be sold to people who believed they were 
seeing Kraftwerk when in fact CWP knew that only Karl Bartos would be 
attending, that's FRAUD.

In other words, Coolworld is aware that their behavior is bordering on 
illegal and doesn't want anyone to know about it.

> I don't think thats too much to ask?

Actually, it IS too much to ask.  It's not as if Coolworld has made any 
sort of apology for their blatant deception or in any way owned up to 
their behavior; their responses to this thread have been further 
obfuscation.  Note their reply which says that Karl Bartos will be 
performing "as Kraftwerk."  Even after their Blatantly Scurrilous 
Perjury has been exposed, they continue to attempt to perpetuate it!  
Look at Monique's post about how she was unable to find any of the 
supposed $25 tickets, and then look at the post from Coolworld that was 
just sent to the list, wherein Coolworld maintains that $25 tickets are 
still available!   It's not as if these greedy corporate entities learn 
from their mistakes.  Not even a day has gone by since they were caught 
in a lie, and they're already fabricating another one.  Too much to 
ask?  TOO MUCH TO ASK?  Is it too much to ask that if you're going to 
make money from OUR community and OUR music, that you at least do it 
honestly?  Is it too much to ask that if you're going to appropriate 
our ideology and imagery for your mega-corporate carnivals that you at 
least treat us with a modicum of respect?

If Coolworld was really serious about putting this embarrassing episode 
behind them, they would offer, PUBLICLY, refunds for anyone who bought 
tickets thinking they were going to see Kraftwerk.  Somehow, though, I 
don't think that's going to happen.

Hmmm- I just curious what Karl Bartos says about this-

Thinking about Pink Floyd, there's a lot of messiness
about who "Pink Floyd" is when different unassociated
members of the group wish to keep performing under the
band name.

In any case, either Karl Bartos correctly represented
himself to Cool world as "Kraftwerk" (shame on the
consumer for not doing research in to who "Kraftwerk"
actually is these days), or Karl told Coolworld he was
Kraftwerk when in fact he was not(bad hot Karl!), or
Coolworld knew it wasnt Kraftwerk and lied to
everyone.
(bad Coolworld)

I thin kmy point is that the only person who can set
this straight is Karl Bartos, and I don't see him
popping on to SFR to do it :)

You guys are being upfront well before the show, so that's cool in my
book.

-&e-> I think 10 threads is pretty sufficient?

Whatever it takes.  The larger your promotion and party... the larger the
discussion.  The more you promise the world, the more a natural increase
in skepticism.  You guys signed up for the big time, not me.  I could get
mad (about the fact that my last car's window derailed from how hard one
of your flyer peeps shoved your foldout into my window jam but I'm over it
now even thought I wasn't even parked anywhere near a club or party at the

Asking questions publicly to the benefit of the public as a response to a
public advertisment is totally fair game.  this is not an advertisement
list, it's a discussion list, so expect a little discussion in return for
the free promotion opportunity.

And it's a great topic this Kraftwerk thing... I mean, just WHO is the
operator of my pocket calculator?

peace,
andyw

p.s. You haven't gotten back to me about booking me for your party, which
lands on my birthday (what a coincendence, the premier West Coast Massive
and my being shot forth into the world by my loving mum... is that cool or
what!?!?!).. so I'll remind you of my special needs on my special day.
They are as follows: I need three decks, and a good mixer (I reserve the
right to adjust the turntables to span a bigger bpm range, but I'll set
them back when I'm done so it's shouldn't be a problem).  I'd like to play
on the loudest sound system there (I love it when the bass rattles my
nuts, it feels like a friendly musical hand).  Furthermore, if I could
play after some big name DJ and wipe the floor with their over-marketed
ass, that would be great... maybe Christopher Lawrence, last time I played
after him was super fun (few years back at one of the Innercense
parties... right after his wedding actually, suffice to say his hair
looked great!  I'd love to figure out who his stylist is, I've got some
problems managing my locks if you know what I mean).  I'd also like a cold
six pack of Coors Light or Lucky Lager, a blunt and some nice people to
pass it around with (this has to be _before_ my set, it helps me unwind
and feel *the vibe*), and if possible an armed escort so I can get back to
my bike safely with all the grip I'm gonna make for the set I'm playing
for you guys.  If you guys wanna really set me up, I like those almond
m&m's... don't worry about hiring any dancing girls or anything, my beats
take care of that right quick (the honeys like a friendly musical hand too
*wink wink*).  You don't need to worry about a hotel (I'm local baby!),
and I know of at least three people that aren't planning on going that
would totally go if you booked me (so that's like a third of what you'd
need to pay me right there!).  So it's like a win/win situation!  Act now!
I know I play techno and you might have your doubts, but seriously, it's
the shinny (and well, Carl Cox and Jeff Mills are techno Djs too,
right?!)!  Plus, I'm sorta considered underground, imagine the value add
of all the 'street cred' I pack in this ass...  it's like you could
promote your party as a *Genuine* Underground Event[tm] like Vlad used to
when he'd book me for those 5am chill room slots.  In fact, it's okay if
you want to use my name to help sell it... like maybe CYBERFEST featuring
ANDYW (please note capitalization... all text should appear in like
fontface and size although dropping the point on the "featuring" is
acceptable if called for by formatting constraints).  If you wanna drop
the Kraftwerk guy, I could dress up kinda nerdy and open up my set with
Tour de France as well (you 'd save a ton of money, I could totally pass
for a German electronic music pioneer, and I won't tell if you won't ;).
Please get back to me when you have a chance, it's getting kinda tough to
keep this date open (the Canadian Government narrowly voted against adding
AndyW Day to their holiday calendar last session, but apparently
detractors of the measure felt they had to repeal Bastille Day first...
and I don't want to sit in some silly car cruising at 3 kilometers per
hour in some parade in Quebec anyways, casue you know... I don't even
speak French!).  In any case, I'm really looking foward to it!  Peace
dudes!

If indeed Karl Bartos was performing under the name "Kraftwerk," do you

       first off to nico and others who had a differing opinion, i hated the 
timeslot decisions but i feel they were necessary to keep people at the party. 
i think it's really tough throwing parties where the whole mass concensus 
agrees that just jetting at 3 am is the standard. nobody's hardcore anymore. it 
gets to the point where someone like yours truly has to get people to come 
because of gimmicks like putting the headliner on last and serving breakfast. and 
those of you who left w/o seeing chris jackson, REALLY missed out.
       it's as if the whole techno scene was just way too used to SF Bar life 
and gotten past the desire and excitement of the RAVE (shout it proud). just 
look at people in the SF techno scene, is anyone younger than 19? i personally 
feel that we should embrace and educate the next generation of people to 
bring some fresh new sounds into techno. because isn't that what it's about? 
-techno being a close synonym for the future and all?
please feel free to read the comments below if you made it this far. `;)

if chris jackson's timeslot is your only gripe then i
feel compelled to mention that we didn't plan the
lineup, that was DEFSF.  so don't hate, biotch!  8)

It's bad when there's only like myself and 2 other people listening to Chris
Jackson play records.  That's my gripe in a nutshell.  Why pay him to play
for 3 people?

<3

n i c o

high praise nick, at least *you're* true hard core. `;) thanks for coming 
out, had i known deaks was spinning i would have been party hopping myself 
(shouts to CF). tons of respect for everyone who came out, had fun, and is 
representing with techno in their own way.
my appreciation:: Sean.

again,

quit bitching and expecting to be booked because of it.  What you've sent 
to the list as far as tracks, I haven't liked, so I have no desire to 
recommend that a crew book you.  Live PA acts, on the other hand, are 
regularly booked at both UG's and clubs.

story...

my favorite band in high school was Sisters of Mercy.
Sisters of Mercy got involved in litigation pretty
regularly -- basically, any time the main guy (Andrew
Eldritch) disagreed with anyone else in the band, he
kicked them out, sued them, and (in extreme cases)
made records bragging about the amount of money they
had to pay him to settle the lawsuits.

as you could imagine he had a different guitarist
every album. he also had a different bassist every
album. in fact the only member of the band to stick
thru it the whole time besides Eldritch himself was
Doktor Avalanche, his trusty drum machine.

Eldritch/SOM recently toured the states playing a ton
of unreleased material which was not available
anywhere else. he hadn't put out a new album for
several years, because he was busy suing his record
label over the terms of its recording and release.

anyway, during the few years I was all into this goth
stuff, I learnt the history of the band, and this sort
of thing is **exactly** what used to happen right
before Eldritch sued somebody.

however, Andrew Eldritch is definitely eccentric.

hopefully the guys from Kraftwerk are a little more
laid back.

altho in all fairness Kraftwerk more inspired techno
than defined it...you know what would be cool? a mix
CD which combined Kraftwerk, Africa Bambatta, World
Class Wrecking Cru, Juan Atkins, etc., and sort of put
them all in historical context -- so you could hear
how the ideas flowed from track to track. put in early
house, too, kz all the Detroit guys were driving to
Chicago to buy records.

man that would be cool to hear.

which reminds me, I gotta get that Tenaglia mix
"Classics."

blah, blah... :-)

yeah, sorry, that was kind of obnoxious, but it was
lots of fun. seriously tho? if I was gonna give you
like grown-up respectful advice and stuff? I'd say the
same thing, I'd just say it more gently. you want
people to give you love. give yourself love.

and don't go throwing in the towel. maybe you're
underappreciated. maybe your music just sucks. who
cares? you'll want to make music again. just put your
shit aside for a while and do something else.

and Hewlett-Packard did not invent the fucking radio,
dude. you might be more satisfied with your musical
career if you were smoking less crack. :-P

  28 or more injured at police raid against ravers in France
  --

  Everything began when members of CGT (the biggest labour syndicate)
sent a message on raver's infoline network telling that the Teknival will be
thrown in "Vieilles Charrues" festival's spot in support to its
artistic/technical workers (people working in art industry in france have a 
special status
  that is actually changed by the governement, to explain it quickly:
people like Depardieu or Johnny Halliday are "indemized" by social services in
addition to their already huge rewarding, and goverenement changed it
making it harder to have this status, so they took the money to people who
already are in difficulty....! so actually there's a big social movement about
it).
But the CGT told it wasn't them who did that. This point is quite
obscure.

 > The party was forbidden by the use of a prefectorial decrete, a
thousand policemen were mobilized.
 >
 > Then on thursday, a hide & seek game began with the authorities that
finished in Plouray during a big part of the night and day.
 >
 > About ten partypeople's vehicles took part on friday in a blocking
operation at about ten kilometres of Rostrenen (Côtes d'Armor) on the
road to Carhaix where the official festival took place.
 >
 > On friday night, party people went to a cul-de-sac "St Barbe's vault"
located in Faouet, a 2/3 kilometers road surrounded by fields ending on
two large ones.
 >
 > At about 9pm policemen seeing upcoming difficulties, the continuous
flood of cars arriving from everywhere and partypeople doing a sit-in
blocking the only way to t! he fields, began to get a little more irritated.
 >
 > At this time, everything was very peacefull, slogans were "Give our
sound back!" or "Let us party!" and such... it lasted quite a while.
 >
 >
 > Faouet's war
 > ------------------------------------
 >
 > Surrounded by policemen, some began to throw stones. The Morbihan's
prefect, Elisabeth Allaire, having reaffirmed that it was "out of
question to grant ravers an exeption", gave order to assault and to use all
means necessary to disperse the ravers. Quickly a rain of tear gas grenades
fell on the sitting partypeople.
 >
 > Partypeople answered by "stoning" police's vehicles (and policemen
obviously), that were about ten at this time.
 >
 > More and more partypeople were arriving to defend the road's entry,
attracted by the noise of grenades, always throwing stones. Policemen
feeling in inferiority and in danger didn't hesitate to ! use great
means:
these so called OFFENSIVE GRENADES !
 > (info: http://www.ssi-media.com/pigbrother/Report2003Part2.htm#8)
 >
 > That's when everything began to get really nasty, all the partypeople
agree saying that one would have believed oneself in war, "a true blood
bath" "a butchery" "a carnage"...
 >
 > First wounded raver received an offensive grenade on his thorax (he's
been very lucky), 4 broken "thorax bones" and multiple open wounds on all
the body, everybody thought he was dead. The problem was that policemen
were still firing offensive grenades (about 70 grenades were thrown ! ). No
way to
 > get (him) out of it, firemen couldn't come in, partypeople couldn't
come out ! Another one had a hand bursted by a grenade that exploded at few
centimeters away of him in the air...
 >
 > In fact, 25 wounded people have bee! n sent to the hospital or have
been healed by firemen's emergency services, but uncounted wounded people's
number is huge. 7 people were hospitalized.
 >
 > An old woman that has been saved by partypeople has been interviewed
on TV (only on 1pm news, it's strange that that infomation disapeared on 8pm
news - to broadcast only the part when she shows her wasted house).
partypeople took her to a safe place while policemen were firing
grenades everywhere, including houses of the residents (many broken 
windows), and present residents.
 >
 > The residents asked the cops to let ravers pass as they were already
many there anyways, but no way for them to be heard. Residents understood
the partypeople's distress, obliged to defend against cop's violent attack.
 >
 > Burning barricades have been set almost everywhere on the road and
the bridge leading to the place where a few sound-systems managed to take
place (2, 3 or 5 accor! ding to the testimonys)
 >
 > Another testimony: "12 CRS (crowd control police unit) with support
of the army, motorbikes and trucks... the hill was on fire with many burning
barricades and a few wooden gates"
 >
 > Everything lasted about 6 hours ! 6 hours of war to take the right to
throw a TAZ (Temporary Autonomous Zone)
 >
 > Some partypeople were in quite critical state and spent two days in
the hospital.
 >
 > The cops were firing grenades, partypeople were moving back a few
meters then assault with stones, breeze blocks and such. Prefect tells about
molotov cocktails but this is not confirmed by any witness.
 >
 > It ended when partypeople decided to stop fleeing the cops assaults
and began to all stand in front of the cops and their grenades, getting
closer and closer to them without moving back.
 >
 > Fortunately the cops stopped their butchery and all went away,
freeing the spot's! access. A "victory" but at which price ?...
 >
 >
 > The rave passes on
 > ------------------------------------------------
 >
 > Morbihan's prefect justified public force use, including using
offensive grenades, telling that "It wasn't a youth gathering but a real 
riot".
She also told that it wasn't a rave "as there were no sound-systems
present",that is an obvious bullshit, every sound-system being seized by
policemen.
 >
 > AFP: "The 1000 policemen spread in all central britany proceeded
since friday to 27 sound-systems seizures..."
 >
 > After the fight the policemen just completely went away, without any
will to "securize" the place. Not even an emergency call number was
available. Lastly it seems municipality was almost absent, Saturday 
afternoon, the
residents only received a simple phone call from the mayor. No visit on
the spot. For some of them, even victims, the fault is to the authoriti! es
that tried stopping things too late and ill-advised, as many ravers were
arrived in the city, they shouldn't have take the risk of the confrontation.
 >
 > 58 people were challenged for narcotic detention. The next day, two
of them were sent to prison for a year (No reason supplied).
 >
 > AFP: "Many ravers joined those already installed on St Barbe's
vault's spot during the night, taking the number of present people to about
10000 -according to police"
 >
 > On sunday morning about 8 000 young people were still in
Faouet,concentrated on a hill at the end of a road located just near
the borought.
 >
 > Saturday to Sunday's night have been quiet. Prefecture maintened
filtering the roads around Faouet to prevent sound-systems from getting to St
Barbe. It couldn't avoid that a small part arrived at destination, dismounted
in separate elements for more conceability.
 >
 > Ravers ended by pr! oceeding to the spot's cleaning (seen on TV).
Everybody participated, with trash bags distributed by firemen. Testimony: "At
the end the spot was really clean, trash bags were all grouped along the road,
even capsules and cigarettes ends have been took away in some places"
 >
 >
 > Whose fault?
 > ------------------------------------------------------
 >
 > The wrongs are shared.
 >
 > To the "organizers" that apparently didn't organize much, and are
surely not the ones that paid the full price for this night of hell. But if
these people have a part o responsibility, it surely wasn't to the ravers
"mass" to undergo the consequences for them. Even less, it was the resident's.
The Tekno comunity see the people responsible for this waste with evil
eyes.
 >
 > The fact that there has been a minority of rioters and breakers in
the partypeople crowd is very probable. But police's reaction was
appare! ntly (voluntarily?) disproportionned. Partypeople's image has been 
more
degraded -
that is a good deal for the governement.
 >
 > Lastly, and mostly, prefect and public forces didn't hesitate to
knowingly create a confrontation situation, pertinently knowing that with or
without authorization, thousands of young people would converge toward 
Carhaix.
The State once more led to a foreseeable confrontation, to make tekno
 > movement's reputation worse, in spite of the structuring attempts of
associations such as Le Silence Tue, Sound-systems collective... These
efforts towards a dialog are highly in question, that could lead to
others serious tensions and/or confrontations, in continuity of the
systematically repressive logic of the government...

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we

mmmm... I'd suggest to venture further..  where... yeah.. that is a good 
question.. m_s is good stepping point I suppose; just don't let it swallow 
your soul... 1000 MFA new media students and counting...

I am 1st in line to hurl on Kim Cascone's powerbook.

Attend a "lecture" of his (granted they probably aren't all as pompous as 
the one I saw; well...) and you can take a number behind me.

;P

**Raises hand**  I want to book you seeing how you slammed most promoters on 
this list by the line "Add some fun to your parties for a change" So what 
your saying is most peoples partys are boring and mondane right now. And if 
they add you to there lineup somehow it will become ultra happy fun and 
special!!

This is one of the funniest emails i've read to date, but isnt andyw always good for that? Andy, you were always my FAVORITE sound guy! The day you Sold Mutor, was the saaddest day of my life!
 
If you could bring back MUTOR, then i could possibly pull some strings to get you on the line up?
 
the balls in your court old buddy!
 
--> the good ole memories of andyw and kj picking up Mutor, kj's running late, andys eating lunch and picking out records, kj's starting to stress "dood, andys not even ready and he's picking out records", andys still drinking a beer = kj's stressing out even more. gotta love the old school underground, those were the days!
 
LONG LIVE MUTOR!

You guys are being upfront well before the show, so that's cool in my
book.

Whatever it takes. The larger your promotion and party... the larger the
discussion. The more you promise the world, the more a natural increase
in skepticism. You guys signed up for the big time, not me. I could get
mad (about the fact that my last car's window derailed from how hard one
of your flyer peeps shoved your foldout into my window jam but I'm over it
now even thought I wasn't even parked anywhere near a club or party at the

Asking questions publicly to the benefit of the public as a response to a
public advertisment is totally fair game. this is not an advertisement
list, it's a discussion list, so expect a little discussion in return for
the free promotion opportunity.

And it's a great topic this Kraftwerk thing... I mean, just WHO is the
operator of my pocket calculator?

peace,
andyw

p.s. You haven't gotten back to me about booking me for your party, which
lands on my birthday (what a coincendence, the premier West Coast Massive
and my being shot forth into the world by my loving mum... is that cool or
what!?!?!).. so I'll remind you of my special needs on my special day.
They are as follows: I need three decks, and a good mixer (I reserve the
right to adjust the turntables to span a bigger bpm range, but I'll set
them back when I'm done so it's shouldn't be a problem). I'd like to play
on the loudest sound system there (I love it when the bass rattles my
nuts, it feels like a friendly musical hand). Furthermore, if I could
play after some big name DJ and wipe the floor with their over-marketed
ass, that would be great... maybe Christopher Lawrence, last time I played
after him was super fun (few years back at one of the Innercense
parties... right after his wedding actually, suffice to say his hair
looked great! I'd love to figure out who his stylist is, I've got some
problems managing my locks if you know what I mean). I'd also like a cold
six pack of Coors Light or Lucky Lager, a blunt and some nice people to
pass it around with (this has to be _before_ my set, it helps me unwind
and feel *the vibe*), and if possible an armed escort so I can get back to
my bike safely with all the grip I'm gonna make for the set I'm playing
for you guys. If you guys wanna really set me up, I like those almond
m&m's... don't worry about hiring any dancing girls or anything, my beats
take care of that right quick (the honeys like a friendly musical hand too
*wink wink*). You don't need to worry about a hotel (I'm local baby!),
and I know of at least three people that aren't planning on going that
would totally go if you booked me (so that's like a third of what you'd
need to pay me right there!). So it's like a win/win situation! Act now!
I know I play techno and you might have your doubts, but seriously, it's
the shinny (and well, Carl Cox and Jeff Mills are techno Djs too,
right?!)! Plus, I'm sorta considered underground, imagine the value add
of all the 'street cred' I pack in this ass... it's like you could
promote your party as a *Genuine* Underground Event[tm] like Vlad used to
when he'd book me for those 5am chill room slots. In fact, it's okay if
you want to use my name to help sell it... like maybe CYBERFEST featuring
ANDYW (please note capitalization... all text should appear in like
fontface and size although dropping the point on the "featuring" is
acceptable if called for by formatting constraints). If you wanna drop
the Kraftwerk guy, I could dress up kinda nerdy and open up my set with
Tour de France as well (you 'd save a ton of money, I could totally pass
for a German electronic music pioneer, and I won't tell if you won't ;).
Please get back to me when you have a chance, it's getting kinda tough to
keep this date open (the Canadian Government narrowly voted against adding
AndyW Day to their holiday calendar last session, but apparently
detractors of the measure felt they had to repeal Bastille Day first...
and I don't want to sit in some silly car cruising at 3 kilometers per
hour in some parade in Quebec anyways, casue you know... I don't even
speak French!). In any case, I'm really looking foward to it! Peace
dudes!

i am not a lesbian, but even if i were, i would still not be into some random lesbian coming up to me because they think the environment is safe or because my gay husband sent her over to me to create some sort of fantasy come to life for her or for a potential crowd of strangers. i wish people would learn to keep their hands to themselves. i don't think that sexual orientation is sexy. sexual orientation just is. i am not into experimenting with people and judging them based on the results or anything like that. i think that is so weird and just so annoying beyond belief, so i just treat it like trying to buy some groceries. no matter where you are, or might always have to take a huge round about route until the lameness either changes or goes away completely, which usually it doesn't, so really, it is not about words as it is about convenience for a lot of people. why do you think people fly from coast to coast for the simplicities? really, consider it.

i've always felt that being groped by lesbians and buying 
groceries were very different experiences, personally.

I was groped by some skater lesbians once in that bar
at 6 6th st right off Market.

They kinda pushed me back against the wall and grabbed
my crotch-
It took me off guard like "i'm being assaulted by a
group of girls" was not something my brain knew how to
process.
Then a few seconds later I "woke up" but they were
already done and had got their fill.

Any mention of rescheduling for a later date? Curious to hear the man behind

Subject: [sfraves] RE: SFR Sex Map - For the good of the community.

First of all, I have to say that I can appreciate the intention of protecting ourselves here...

However, I also feel obligated to say that if this is anything more than a passing joke it is 1.) a gross violation of privacy and 2.) opens whoever is maintaining it to libel/slander suits.

If indeed this is more than a joke, I wouldn't feel too sorry for anyone that DID get sued.  Managing personal STD infections are the responsibility of that individual; NOT the community, and certainly not via a cruel and embarassing blacklist.  It's kinda like the stocks in the puritan colonies.

Just my 2 condoms worth...

- Graham

FYI - my CLEAN, RECENT test reports are available should the ladies of SFR have any questions.  ;)

-----Original Message-----

Hey all-

I've started up an SFR sex map that will keep track of
 who has slept with who.
As SFRaves grows as the beautiful community it is,
keeping track of the STD chain becomes a very
important thing.  STDs are real, and it's important
everyone be informed and knowledgable about everyone
here.

There's only about 20 names on it so far, and it's not
complete by any means so please send me any
information you have about anyone here and I'll add
them to the list.

Subject: [sfraves]NRR: FLustered over Technics

After finding out about final scratch (finalscratch.com) I decided that I 
need to get into turntablism.  My buddy is selling two brand new MKIII's and 
a vestax mixer(anniversary edition w/ blue face) dont know the model.  He is 
hooking my up with the whole thing for 700 bucks.  Now, I can either suck it 
up, pay him the cash and be broke for the remainder of the summer(no 
partying, no nothin).  Or, I can wait until I am out of debt and buy some 
techs some other way.

I'm nervous cuz I am horrible at tables, but I know I would have a lot of 
fun practicing and playin with them.  I mean, I wouldnt even be able to buy 
final scratch for a long time but I dont have problems with practicing with 
regular records and what not.  Yeesh, I will be just barely scraping by 
financially if I buy these tables.

Had to tell someone...

It's amazing how many people don't get that or notice the impossibility of
some *connections* so to speak. It's made me laugh in some cases when I see
the supposed connections. =)

gosh, there sure is a lot of mail to go through lately. tons of events and just a bunch of stuff, and it keeps coming in way to fast to keep up with it seems, plus, good god that anyone finds me to be even remotely interesting. couldn't someone start like a hate thread over geri dahl or like some sort of political movement stemming from my blatant observations? i mean, shit, there is already way to much mail on the internet, and on top of it all, way too many people like myself in the world. why not kill two birds with one stone? oh, wait, isn't that someone else's saying? say, is there anyone out there who is bored in their relationship or just having a boring day who would like to hook up with me for a few years? i think i should go on craig's list too, or at the very least, the f-8 list. i am actually, fairly certain, that my posts or my name has come up in several places now. why? i don't know. i think it must be the tedium or something like that. looking for an apartment in
 arizona? just ask me where it is. oh, how about saving something that isn't dying or closing? we could all pull our time, money and resources together and go to the papers and everything. :)

Correction...  Manging STD infections is the responsibility of the
individual and the department of homeland security now in conjunction
with the CDC and the new disease tracking initiative.  But still not the
community.

First of all, I have to say that I can appreciate the intention of
protecting ourselves here...

However, I also feel obligated to say that if this is anything more than
a passing joke it is 1.) a gross violation of privacy and 2.) opens
whoever is maintaining it to libel/slander suits.

If indeed this is more than a joke, I wouldn't feel too sorry for anyone
that DID get sued.  Managing personal STD infections are the
responsibility of that individual; NOT the community, and certainly not
via a cruel and embarassing blacklist.  It's kinda like the stocks in
the puritan colonies.

Just my 2 condoms worth...

Hey all-

I've started up an SFR sex map that will keep track of
 who has slept with who.
As SFRaves grows as the beautiful community it is,
keeping track of the STD chain becomes a very
important thing.  STDs are real, and it's important
everyone be informed and knowledgable about everyone
here.

There's only about 20 names on it so far, and it's not
complete by any means so please send me any
information you have about anyone here and I'll add
them to the list.

Tables are always around for good prices. My advice is this buy vinyl
right now and meet up with someone near you who will let you practice on
their tables then save for 1200's and have fund during the summer and
buy lots of sick tracks along the way. Just my two bits.

Subject: [sfraves]NRR: FLustered over Technics

After finding out about final scratch (finalscratch.com) I decided that
I 
need to get into turntablism.  My buddy is selling two brand new MKIII's
and 
a vestax mixer(anniversary edition w/ blue face) dont know the model.
He is 
hooking my up with the whole thing for 700 bucks.  Now, I can either
suck it 
up, pay him the cash and be broke for the remainder of the summer(no 
partying, no nothin).  Or, I can wait until I am out of debt and buy
some 
techs some other way.

I'm nervous cuz I am horrible at tables, but I know I would have a lot
of 
fun practicing and playin with them.  I mean, I wouldnt even be able to
buy 
final scratch for a long time but I dont have problems with practicing
with 
regular records and what not.  Yeesh, I will be just barely scraping by 
financially if I buy these tables.

Had to tell someone...

you'll need to spend money on records to even use the
turntables. put aside half the money for turntables,
use the cash left over to make life fun, and then save
up the difference.

making life fun includes buying records. :-)

or, since you want to learn turntablism, buy one
turntable and a mixer. a lot of turntablist techniques
only require one table and a mixer to learn. the idea
is, the first record spins unmolested on the 1s, while
the other record is scratched, crabbed, transformed,
and flibberdigibbetted to hell and back on the 2s. you
might not be able to put on any parties with just one
table and a mixer, but you'll be able to learn shit,
and there's no point putting on a party until you know
what you're doing anyway. :-)

but really, ignore all that, just buy the fucking
tables. food and rent are for pussies.

right on!!

you'll soon be hooked, fiending for new records and
spending every last dime. you'll find it's a bit like
heroin, right down to the needle fixation and
everything. :-)

(actually I've seen cheaper deals on eBay, but the
average eBayer won't give you payment plans and a full
crate of records.)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP update: Rendezvous, Aug. 2, will be in San Leandro

Hi everyone, after I posted some info about Rendezvous, people started asking me where the party was going to be. Istyly has announced that it's going to be in San Leandro, just south of Oakland. A virgin venue, no less! The party is permitted, all ages, and will go from 6 pm to 2 am. (The actual location will be be given out at 9 am the day of the party -- Saturday, August 2.) San Leandro is easily accessible from the 880 freeway.

If you didn't already hear, ticket prices have been reduced to $9.00. Tickets at the door will be $15.00. Rest assured, it isn't because of a smaller venue or fewer DJs -- Istyly just managed to get a better deal on this great venue. The pre-sale outlets will have the new price today. 

We're looking forward to seeing everyone at this party for the return of Istyly. Thanks, everyone -- have a safe, wonderful, and fun time.

Again, here is the info on the party:
Istyly is back kids!!  And we are ready to throw another party for you all!!  Banging the Bass in ROOM ONE : Tom Slick, Mystre,  Thee-o,  Denise,  Ton:e,  Molly Mush,  Peter Gozenya vs Yagi,  & Lip. Bringing the Beats in ROOM TWO:   Torque,  EJthaDJ,  Little Star,  DJ Citrik,  Charlie,  Dj Girlie, & Carlos Alfonso. All responsible ages are welcome to join our happy celebration. Infoline 415.820.1649 / 510.496.6065.

I'm kind of annoyed that I'm only linked to the few people I've gotten 
quickie hand-jobs from, but not the people with whom I've participated 
in full, unprotected penetration. What kinda STD tracker is this???

It's an expensive, obsessive hobby. And it rocks.

Mr. Jackson is right here, he asked to be booked for august sometime and well 
we arent going to do it. We are as professional as we can be in this game and 
when you dont act with the same respect well then we dont want you. So I can 
say I am sorry that he didn't make it as getting on a plan, getting paid, and 
playing records is an insanely hard job. Keepin it real one pond at a time.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR Some Friday humor

Understanding Engineers - Take One



Two engineering students were walking across the campus when one said, 
"Where did you get such a great bike?"



The second engineer replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday
minding my 
own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw the
bike 
to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want."



The second engineer nodded approvingly, "Good choice; the clothes
probably 
wouldn't have fit."




Understanding Engineers - Take Two



To the optimist, the glass is half full. To the pessimist, the glass is
half 
empty. To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.




Understanding Engineers - Take Three



A priest, a doctor and an engineer were waiting one morning for a 
particularly slow group of golfers.



The engineer fumed, "What's with these people? We've been waiting for 15

minutes!"



The doctor chimed in, "I don't know, but I've never seen such
ineptitude!"



The priest said, "Hey, here comes the green keeper. Let's have a word
with 
him." "Hi George, what's the matter that group ahead of us? They're
rather 
slow, aren't they?"



The green keeper replied, "Oh, yes, that's a group of blind
fire-fighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire
last 
year, so we always let them play for free anytime."



The group was silent for a moment.



Then the priest said, "That's so sad. I think I will say a special
prayer for them tonight."



The doctor said, "Good idea. And I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist

friend and see if there is anything he can do for them."



The engineer said, "Why can't they play at night?"





Understanding Engineers - Take Four



A man in a hot air balloon realized he was lost. He reduced altitude and

spotted a woman below. He descended a bit more and shouted, "Excuse me,
can 
you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I
don't 
know where I am."



The woman below replied, "You are in a hot air balloon hovering 
approximately 30 feet above the ground. You are between 40 and 41
degrees 
north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude."



"You must be an engineer," said the balloonist.



"I am," replied the woman, "How did you know?"



"Well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is, technically

correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the
fact 
is I am still lost. Frankly, you've not been much help so far."



The woman below responded, "You must be in Management."



"I am," replied the balloonist, "but how did you know?"



"Well," said the woman, "you don't know where you are or where you are 
going. You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot
air. 
You made a promise, which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect 
people beneath you to solve your problems. The fact is you are in
exactly the same position you were in before we met, but now, somehow,
it's 
my fault."





Understanding Engineers - Take Five



What is the difference between Mechanical Engineers and Civil Engineers?



Mechanical Engineers build weapons. Civil Engineers build targets.





Understanding Engineers - Take Six



Normal people ... believe that if it isn't broken, don't fix it.
Engineers believe that if it isn't broken, it doesn't have enough
features 
yet.





Understanding Engineers - Take Seven



An architect, an artist and an engineer were discussing whether it was 
better to spend time with the wife or a mistress.



The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife, building a solid 
foundation for an enduring relationship.



The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because of the
passion 
and mystery he found there.



The engineer said, "I like both."



"Both?" Replied the architect and artist.



"Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress, they will each assume you are 
spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the lab and get
some 
work done."




Understanding Engineers - Take Eight



One day, an engineer was crossing a road when a frog called out to him
and 
said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess".



He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket.



The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into
a 
beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week."



The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned
it 
to the pocket.



The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a
princess, 
I'll stay with you and do ANYTHING you want."



Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into
his 
pocket.



Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a
beautiful 
princess, I'll stay with you for a week and do anything you want. Why
won't 
you kiss me?"



The engineer said, "Look. I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a 
girlfriend, but a talking frog, now that's cool."

Must be *such* a rough life. Does he have any sets online? I still want to

Hell, I've been working on figuring out *techno* in Reason on my PowerBook.

Mr. Jackson is right here, he asked to be booked for august sometime and
well
we arent going to do it. We are as professional as we can be in this game
and
when you dont act with the same respect well then we dont want you. So I can
say I am sorry that he didn't make it as getting on a plan, getting paid,
and
playing records is an insanely hard job. Keepin it real one pond at a time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Maxim Party Review

Well I have to say that our sfr sources of what to expect for this party 
were right on.. lot's of plastic (silicone actually), and lots and lots and 
LOTS of eye candy.  If you could say.. lets throw a party and invite the 
most beautiful people we know.. hire a dj that spins hiphop and sandstorm.. 
for those people ;-), oh.. and of course, it's all for a bud light superbowl 
commercial.. then that's what I just experienced.  I have to say, the 8 or 
so dancers they hired were fabulous looking.. amazing stage presence and not 
too shabby with the moves either.  They filmed people all night long, with 
busy cameramen running around with strange audio gear and wireless movie 
cams.. gettin in peoples faces and broadcasting it on these huge screens and 
plasma monitors everywhere.. and the one thing I kept thinking as I watched 
was.. she's hot.. oh.. and the other was.. she want's to be a model.  
Everybody there was like- ooh.. a camera is filming me.. I must be sexy and 
devastatingly provocative as if my career depended on it.. LMAO!!  Seeing 
these people try to make the commercial was beyond belief.. and if bud light 
actually used any of the footage.. I would be kinda appalled.. but that's 
why I don't drink bud light anyway.. oh and because its sux ass.

Well, we were on the inside.. it was sweet.. limo in the front.. pimpin like 
big G's..hehe. My bro's friend was one of the promoters.. after being there 
5 minutes, they invited us to do a shot in the limo.. about 12 people piled 
in.. it was huge.  Then the cameras started to flash.. every damn person in 
this car looked like they were straight out of a las vegas strip club (not 
that I know what that looks like but if I could imagine.. this would be 
it).. the women were smokin.. the guys were all gettin their swerve on.. and 
I was in a state of disbelief.  Do you ever look at something your doing an 
feel like it's kinda surreal?  Well that was my whole night!

On a positive note.. If ever you have the chance to party at the 1300 Van 
Ness location.. I think its called the Regency Center.. do it!  It is one of 
the nicest venues I have been too.. super central.. lots of activity.. great 
location.. can get loud as hell and no one would care or notice from 
outside.  Beautiful bar in the center, a huge balcony with bleachers top 
side.. a big stage up high in front.. and lots of Corinthian style pillars 
and awnings, red hanging velvet and tapastries.. all very kewl.  I highly 
recommend ( promoters.. nudge nudge)!

Watch for me at superbowl halftime :)

Subject: [sfraves] BayFF Digital Mix - TONIGHT

* Digital Mix: A Special BayFF Celebrating Illegal Art

On July 25, the Electronic Frontier Foundation will host a night of music,
art, and conversation to celebrate digital culture.  Hosted at the Black
Box in downtown Oakland, this special BayFF will bring up-and-coming
artists of electronica, digital film, and illegal art together with leaders
from the cyber-rights movement.  Lawsuits and legislation have become the
weapons of choice for dealing with file-sharing and cultural recycling
("sampling"); come out and discover what all the hype is about. Between
laptop music, hip hop, and industrial performances, you will hear from
people who are fighting to protect new forms of expression and cultural
distribution from the attacks of the entertainment industry.  This is an
all-ages event.

Subject: [sfraves] what to do with ten dollars nrr

--0-1550658202-1059156912=:77290
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

when i have ten dollars, i usually will eat something, go somewhere fun, buy something to wear, a new scent, some new lipstick, go to a place where i can dance with as little bothering as possible...the last thing i would do is go somewhere to visit someone i don't want to see. i can't believe anyone would think even for one instance that i would go to visit someone that i am not at all interested in. i also can't believe that someone would ever think that i would be as immature as they need me to be just based on their own hypnotic suggestion. anyway, i know how to have real fun with ten dollars and it has never involved hanging out with some jerk or some jerks. :)

When I have ten dollars, I pay the co-pay for my psychologist.

he's an average DJ actually.  sorta like the
prototypical 313 jock...super quick, super
sloppy...with great track selection.  he makes up for
slighlty less than appealing mixing with an assortment
of amazing tracks..

still would have been nice to see him again..

Thats pretty much my opinion on him, word for word. New school Detroit's 
version of Jeff Mills. Only not as dope and I would like to see him to drop 
the BPM a little bit...

when i have ten dollars...extra...i'm tempted to run to clement street and pick up a mini-accordion at the music shop...or ... i hear the startup of a boeing jet engine ... it's 10 bucks towards that round the world plane ticket...only $3-- to go...every little bit helps.  i usually have fun for free...so that $10 helps me get on that plane

Geri Dahl <eeelips@yahoo.com> wrote:when i have ten dollars, i usually will eat something, go somewhere fun, buy something to wear, a new scent, some new lipstick, go to a place where i can dance with as little bothering as possible...the last thing i would do is go somewhere to visit someone i don't want to see. i can't believe anyone would think even for one instance that i would go to visit someone that i am not at all interested in. i also can't believe that someone would ever think that i would be as immature as they need me to be just based on their own hypnotic suggestion. anyway, i know how to have real fun with ten dollars and it has never involved hanging out with some jerk or some jerks. :)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

hey everyone
 
i'm doing inventory for a company called DVD station, and i  wanted 
to buy the Intellect DVD for our inventory...but i'm not fully in 
charge of that...i need to know now many of you would rent the film from us 
if we bought it.  we're located in the Metreon in San Francisco, on the 
first floor.  it's this semi-automated deal where you put in your 
credit card, push some touch screen buttons and order it...it prints a 
receipt you turn to the counter and the dude gets your movies.  $1/day for 
as long as you have the movie out (have it out for 2 weeks, it's $14 )  
enough positive responses for the list and maybe i can persuade the 
dudes to buy it...we also have another branch at royal grounds cafe in the 
fillmore, but the metreon would probably be the location they'd put 
this film...
 
so would you rent it?
 
i know...sucked into the souless corporate world..don't get me 
started...it pays the rent...and my plane tickets...
 
cheers,
 
lauren

i'd rent that!  $1/day is an interesting pricing scheme.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP :: AEC :: RAWR! :: **TONIGHT!** :: FREE :: 12am - 6am :: outdoor

Tonight is the night! AEC is back again with another party in the great
outdoors. In celebration of all the leo birthdays out there we're going to
be taking you back to when all house//trance//breaks//dnb was *rave* music
and the hard lines drawn between the genres hadn't formed yet. It's a
special night where all of the dj's will be playing genres they used to
play, but no longer do. It's a re.re.re.wind night under the stars. Get
stupid silly and run around as your alter ego with the rest of the clan
tonight. We're going back to the same location as AEC :: Come As You Aren't
from 2 years ago. The spot is nestled in a secret valley where you can drive
into the location. Hear you local DJ favorites play music as their alter
egos! Bring a friend whether that be you neighbor, your classmate or that
cute barista that just hooked you up with a tripple venti caramel macciato
then licked their lips and smiled at you.

Check your seriousness at the door. Turn your goof on and come ready to
throw down silly style!

// Info line will be announced by *5pm* and updated at 11:30pm tonight! //

This is word of mouth from here on out. If you miss the email with the vm #
just ask around for it!

:: RULES ::
!! YOU MUST FOLLOW THEM!!
Go the speed limit and don't pass other cars.
A carload of *ravers* sticks out so please keep the sound systems turned
down as well.
If you see someone behind you or coming towards you on the road keep going
past the gate.
Make a mental note as to where the gate is and keep driving past it.
Turn around up the road a bit and wait for the car to pass so as not to draw
attention to the location.
Be patient if there happens to be traffic do not just head for the gate
anyway! The party goes all night with cooperation.
When you're alone on the road turn into the gate and someone will open it
for you. TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS.
Go SLOWLY through the gate and continue slowly up the hill and please DO NOT
use your brakes (break lights come on)
Once you have crested the hill there will be someone to direct you to
parking.
We ask that once you are at the party that you do not try to leave until
after 4am. Having cars going in and out of the space puts the entire party
at risk.
Keep flashlights low so that you don't light up the hillsides for road
traffic to see.
Do NOT wander up to the top of the hill at night. You are visible from the
road up there and especially with glowsticks or other lighted objects
There is heavy equipment in the area and although hot rodding it would be
fun, we ask that you leave it alone.
LEAVE NO TRACE - No garbage, cigarette butts, flyers, cans, bottles, etc

hoo hoo hoo!

wait till you hear the shit i throw down tonight!  it's going
to be a pants-droppin, virgin-poppin, pop-n-lockin ****** set! 


oops, guess i'm not supposed to say what i'm spinning.  rest
assured, i've been looking forward to spinning at this party
since the last one, where i passed out on the roof of my car in
full stickman gear, then proceeded to spin completely blasted
out-of-my-mind-drunk - so drunk that i had to grab onto the
tables in order to stand up.

it's going to be another rockstar night, and you should come
out and play.

// Info line will be announced by *5pm* and updated at 11:30pm tonight! //

This is word of mouth from here on out. If you miss the email with the vm #
just ask around for it!

:: RULES ::
!! YOU MUST FOLLOW THEM!!
Go the speed limit and don't pass other cars.
A carload of *ravers* sticks out so please keep the sound systems turned
down as well.
If you see someone behind you or coming towards you on the road keep going
past the gate.
Make a mental note as to where the gate is and keep driving past it.
Turn around up the road a bit and wait for the car to pass so as not to draw
attention to the location.
Be patient if there happens to be traffic do not just head for the gate
anyway! The party goes all night with cooperation.
When you're alone on the road turn into the gate and someone will open it
for you. TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS.
Go SLOWLY through the gate and continue slowly up the hill and please DO NOT
use your brakes (break lights come on)
Once you have crested the hill there will be someone to direct you to
parking.
We ask that once you are at the party that you do not try to leave until
after 4am. Having cars going in and out of the space puts the entire party
at risk.
Keep flashlights low so that you don't light up the hillsides for road
traffic to see.
Do NOT wander up to the top of the hill at night. You are visible from the
road up there and especially with glowsticks or other lighted objects
There is heavy equipment in the area and although hot rodding it would be
fun, we ask that you leave it alone.
LEAVE NO TRACE - No garbage, cigarette butts, flyers, cans, bottles, etc

I couldn't stop dancing!!! Heeeeeeeeeello 2Day!

OK... I was hella buggin' during the next set 'cause Ooooooooh My Gooodness, Oh My Goooosh, Hello 2Day.... Praxis fucked shit up big time man!!  WHOA... he played this Mondo Groovy Live PA Techno set!!  It was funny 'cause when his set 1st started... I coulda sworn I heard a Ghetto tech beat!!  I swear... if U were there... U'd know what I was talkin' about when I saw he played 1 of the Grooviest Techno sets ever!!  I mean... & this shit was LIVE!!  Oooooh Wow... I Loved it!  Thank U sooooooo much Praxis!!!  I mean... was totally hard Techno all the way & man... his dark melodies that he wove in & out of his set totally made me dance & like totally yell from all that damn excitement!!!  Ooooooh man... so Dope!!

OK... unforetunately... T 1000 was unable 2 show up so Rich & Mel Summerhayes showed up in his place & lol.... they played this Wicked Techno set... Man...I Loved it!!!  LoL... it was sooo Awesome seein' those 2 after soooo long!!!  Oh My Goodness man... they played some wicked tracks & it was CooL 'cause Mel doesn't usual spin techno.. so it was nice seein' her totally get off like that!!!

OK... upstairs!!  Arson & G.Funk.Jeff opened up the room w/ their shit... wooooohoooo... I Loved it!!!  I mean... my 1 favorite part of their set well, G-Funk dropped this 1 track & it was a 1/2 speed slower than Jungle & it was this like Rock song that had a hip hop beat & it was fuckin' Sick man!!  I Loved it!!!

Ultra Violet went on next & she fucked it like usual!!  Hello 2Day... she played all my favorite Jungle tracks that she spins & ofcourse she was up on her usual mixer tricks!!!  Whoooooooooa man!!  

The Femmes went on next & Wow!!  OK... I think it was Tess when 1 dropped of my all time FAvorite Favorite Favorite Jungle tracks of all time!!!  It's a classic & I totally wish I knew the name & the artist... grrrr... but I Loved it!!!  It was Yummy!

I think I danced the longest during their set (next 2 G Funk's & Arson's set) 'cause Ivry is 1 of my Mondo favorite Jungle DJs!!!

The vibe there was So Groovy... So manyt people showed up!!  LoL... I was havin' this mondo long ass conversation w/ Eric Rigsbee during Praxis's set & he was all sayin' that his set was so perfect that this is the only way that Techno should be played... LIVE!!  LoL

But yeah man... it was total Family night as usual last night!!!  I Loved it!!!  Oh My Goondess man... it was jus' soooooooo Awesome!!  LIterally... I had a smile on my face the whole night!!!

LoL  I Love Terri 'cause seriously.... she my fuckin' playmate & whenever we get 2gether... we are so rowdy 2getrher!!!  LoL

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."

oops, guess i'm not supposed to say what i'm spinning. rest
assured, i've been looking forward to spinning at this party
since the last one, where i passed out on the roof of my car in
full stickman gear, then proceeded to spin completely blasted
out-of-my-mind-drunk - so drunk that i had to grab onto the
tables in order to stand up.

it's going to be another rockstar night, and you should come
out and play.

Subject: [sfraves] Producer question.. 

Hello Gang,

I wanted to ask some of you label heads,Producers and hobbiests what your 
thoughts,views are of Reason 2.x Im wondering with this day and age of insta 
producer solutions if this all in one type system is what some of the 
general populus uses? Or do most just use stand alone type systems..

Trying to guage if it is something worth delving into or just try to stick 
with using stand alone stuff. Logic,Ohm boys,kontakt etc..

Is there real production power in reason or is it more of a tool, but can be 
geared for real production.


Thanks,

M

I've got it running on my 12" G4 sitting next to me as we speak. Fun little
program to play with. Amazing how fast you can kill time waiting for bart
with it! It's ok sounding. Actually it's pretty darn good. I've never played
it through a soundsystem, but I may well do that tonight just for shits and
giggles. Like any tool it's only as good as the user.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Producer question..

I haven't used it much yet but both of my roommates and studio mate LOVE
IT!  Its not an all in one though and we use it with a midi controller
to bump up its functionalilty but it produces some great sounds across
the board and the samples are easy to find, use, edit and sequence.  I
liked Reaktor a lot and still like the fact you can program your own
tones/instruments but if you don't have the time for something like that
Reason 2 really produces some rich tones, almost an analog warmness that
I'm surprised comes from software and in general people love to use it
and work with it.  Just never limit yourself to one thing of course but
Reason 2 in my mind is a great tool that digital producers should have
in their lineup.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Producer question..

I have found myself liking Buzz more and more lately. I have played with
several of the heavyweights of home producing and Buzz just clicked for
me. I think each producer has a program that they just feel comfortable
with. Yeah Buzz is freeware but it isn't the cost of your programs that
decide the quality of your music. Play around with some different
programs and find out what is most comfortable for you and run with it.

Is there real production power in reason or is it more of a tool, but

I take flak for it sometimes, but I like Reason plenty. Primarily, it's 
for financial reasons. Of course, I do more pop-structured compositions 
for which it's probably not meant, but after running the tracks through 
various filters after bringing them into Logic or Deck, I rarely find 
anyone complaining about the problems with accuracy/sound quality.  
It's just my songwriting skills I need to beef up ;)

I just got reason 2.5 and the new fx are bomb!!! if you plan to seriously go with reason, make sure you have good hardware (sound card, hd) so you can rewire it to something like cubase or nuendo (cheap hardware=hella latency=sequencing nightmare)....then the possibilities are endless!!!

i am so ready to go on a trip myself. i don't know where yet, because there are many places i would enjoy. also, i want to plan around anyone i know who likes to travel, but who i am also sort of nice to but avoiding. i saw one such person this morning.....he is exhausted from traveling. i think that is really good timing, because then when i go, i won't have to worry that he will ask to join me. all i really ever wanted to do with that person was to say, "hello" and be very distant. so far, so good, but i have had to work at it. something else that is grand to spend small bucks on are used classical music works. i like to have some old sheet music or books that are falling apart next to my bed to look at for pleasure or to give me something to work on when people who are sort of my friends are out of town or at least have the common sense to save "it" for the ears that are more tolerant than mine. :) :) :) i was going to go hear some music this evening, but i have to be up early,
 and it looks like everything will also be much to loud, and if i am going to hear it loud, i am saving for the love of it all, but also, it sure would be nice to have a glass of wine...oh, one more cheap thrill...the marc chagall exhibit at the sfmoma....sf related. i am totally up on world museums. i was reading that on the free day, the marc chagall exhibit will cost a small $5.00. he is one of my very favorite artists. :)

when i have ten dollars...extra...i'm tempted to run to clement street and pick up a mini-accordion at the music shop...or ... i hear the startup of a boeing jet engine ... it's 10 bucks towards that round the world plane ticket...only $3-- to go...every little bit helps.  i usually have fun for free...so that $10 helps me get on that plane

Subject: [sfraves] .: Dirtbox Radio Tonight : A.L.I.A.S. Takeover : K-Lungz :.

boh boh boh!

got some ill drum 'n' bass for y'all tonight.

the veritable A.L.I.A.S. residents are showin' tonight as well as Partner
in Crime K-Lungz.  All ill dnb stylee.  Check out the lineup:

07-09 pm EST - K-Lungz [Stonefinger, In The Mix 88.1 FM, Dirtbox Radio,
Partners in Crime, K-Yun.com // DC]
09-11 pm EST - Titts & Arse [A.L.I.A.S., Krunk, Kind Bass Inc.,
Tittsworth.com // DC]
11-01 am EST - John Tab [A.L.I.A.S., Buzzlife.com // DC]
01-03 am EST - ODJ [A.L.I.A.S., Dirtbox Radio, Partners in Crime,
Trividual Productions // DC]

K-Lungz (aka K-Yun) has played venues around the globe, drawing on many
years of musical experience playing drums in a variety of bands as well as
hangin around the studio quite a bit.  Currently the Lungz co-hosts In the
Mix (http://www.inthemix1.com) with DeeJay Clutch, every Thursday night on
college Park's own 88.1 FM.  Make sure y'all tune in (you can grab web
audio links on the site) on August 7th, as they celebrate their 4-year
anniversary.

A.L.I.A.S. is held every week at one of DC's premeir venues, Nation,
alongside one of our longest-running Goth nights, Alchemy.  It's a really
tight mix of cats, featuring DNB, Breaks, Electro, EBM, and a host of live
Goth acts and such.  A.L.I.A.S. residents John Tab, Titts & Arse (Jesse
Tittsworth & Brian Arsenault), and Dirtbox's own ODJ hold down fort
alongside featured artists including Total Science, Baron, A-Sides, and
Twisted Individual.  It's always a good time, it's cheap, and they have $5
pitchers:):)  Send ODJ an email for more information & reduced list spots.

To tune in tonight, go to http://www.dirtboxradio.com/listen.html or click
on one of the following direct links:
64k stream - http://jungletrain.net/64kbps.pls
24k stream - http://jungletrain.net/24kbps.pls
chatroom - http://jungletrain.net/chat.htm
webcam - http://glue.umd.edu/~odjallen/dirtboxradio/webcam.html

Archives of the night will be stored, as always, on our website - so that
way you can listen to 'em again:)

If you'd like to come and play on Dirtbox, send us an email at
bookme@dirtboxradio.com.  We feature mostly DNB, with a spattering of
Breaks and Hip-Hop talent.  If you're well outside of the DC Metro area,
just send us a CD and if we like it, we'll play it!  That includes
production as well.

I hope to see y'all online & in the chat room tonight.  Be safe, and eat
your weaties.

On Saturday Night in San Francisco, Elektrosorcery presents the first =
installment of the new Zodiac Masquerade series.... LEO.
July 23 - August 22

 The lion symbolizes Leo, and people born under this sign are often as =
proud as the king of the jungle himself. Leo is a very ambitious and =
strong-willed sign, and Leos like nothing better than being the center =
of attention.  As in the animal kingdom, female Leos tend to be a bit =
more dominant. Both exes can be practical, philosophical, and spiritual, =
which helps them to get their way of thinking across. Leos are strongly =
attracted to the opposite sex, too.  Relating back to your animal =
instincts, you are most likely to be a lover of nature. Like the lion, =
you are seen as noble and very proud; you cannot tolerate teasing. You =
always fight fairly, though at times you may lack tact and diplomacy. =
The only time you might gripe is when you're ill or stressed, which is =
rare. Overall, this is a most agreeable sign to be born under because of =
the generous basis that it lends to you.=20

Come celebrate the Sign of LEO with fellow Leos: Tracer, Enemy, Charlie, =
Suess, and Leprechaun.

In the Elektrosorcery chamber witness the magik of: Majere, E-Light, =
Achilles, Dekota, Cauze, and Atom One.

Feel the deep roar of the Lion with the bass sounds of the Skills =
Junglists: Bicolas, DOS, B Dub, Lady Ms. B, E$kr, and Uptown.

Limited $15 tickets available at F-8, Skills, and Solid Grooves.

Free face painting all night, wild costumes encouraged, prizes given =
away to each Leo at the party. =20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Producer question.. 

The new London Elektricity album "Billion Dollar
Gravy" features two tracks created entirely within
Reason, namely "The Great Drum & Bass Swindle" and the
title track "Billion Dollar Gravy."

This isn't that unusual, actually, but in the same
article the L.E. guy mentions that he has a track
coming out on his label Hospital -- the highly
respected label that discovered High Contrast -- from
another producer which was produced entirely in Acid!

He also says Reason is a tricky beast, because altho
he was very happy with the two tracks he put on his
album, his experiences with it in terms of audio
quality vary tremendously, and he frequently creates
tracks in Reason and then uses ReWire to send the
audio into programs like Logic and ProTools to get a
better sound.

btw I got all this from the new Future Music. :-)

My own opinion: Reason 2.5 kicks ass over Reason 2.0.
The reverb is still more metallic than I'd like it,
but I want the distortion unit to fuck me. It's that
good. The best addition is the signal spliiters for
both CV and audio. This means you can have
functionally polyphonic Matrix sequencers now, where
before you couldn't; it also allows for more
expressive patch design (using filters, panning, and
effects). The vocoder's neat too; you can actually use
it to construct a multi-band compressor, just by
putting it in EQ mode, isolating specific frequencies,
and compressing them. Then you merge it all up again
in an audio spliiter/merger, and you're set. Also, the
CV splitter can invert signals in the merger mode,
which is fucking nuts.

It's going to be years before I bother with any other
audio gadgets. (Altho I really really REALLY want a
V-Station, and the entire Native line makes me horny.)
I sold a Prophecy, an MPC2K, and a bunch of other shit
and replaced it all with Reason. Then again, DJ Hype
sold a 30,000 pound studio (equiv. to approx $45K) and
replaced it with Logic running plugins! So who can
say.

"Too much nitrous?"

just my potentially rotten opinion, but if your psychologist is boring, you need a new approach...either that or a new psychologist. therapy is not boring. i would have never ever considered making a leap like that as a career if i saw a lot of teachers and therapists being boring in their schools, offices or seminars. also, kind of not related, but also related in a small way...i am into dreams and i took a psychology class in college that had a big dream section in it...last night i dreamt that a man made a baby cry and tossed it on its' head...i took the baby away from him, and i held it really close to me, and the baby stopped crying, but the police wouldn't come, 911 wouldn't help me, and everyone i talked to in the dream, including the babies mother didn't care, so i held the baby close to me all night long, and then, when i woke up, i had been hugging myself the whole time so tight that both of my hands were falling asleep. that was free by the way, so i still have 10 bucks to
 blow. :)

a lot of people I hadn't seen in a while which was great. Gothby//Oseric =
made an appearance. Goodbye tomorrow! The music was all over the place =
and got a lot of people dancing. I loved hearing Andy W spinning hip hop =
and mixing that into Tears For Fears! I was the kid in the NorCal hoody =
running around all night. Good times. Good times... =3D)

Subject: [sfraves] That party in the boondocks lastnight

I was driving to where the darkness led me lastnight and I found the perfect 
place where the darkness in the sky could almost touch my black soul!  It 
was nice, as cold as my heart, dark, & almost foggy in some places!

Unfortunately I wasn't alone like I hoped!  There was this totally crappy 
music playing, all these Dorky STupid people dancing, & it was gross & 
disgusting!

REM should of made a song called STUPID HAPPY PEOPLE because all that happy 
dancing shit was driving me insane!  The only reason I was there as long as 
I was was because I was mentally kicking & stomping on all those peoples 
heads!  I also thought it important to bring the message of depression to 
the masses!  So I told people the whole night to Fuck Off & jump off a cliff 
or take a shower w/ a toaster!  It was a really bad time!

Whatever!  That's it!  Bye!

Goodbye 2morrow,

Osric Gothby

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) any mySQL/PHP geeks out there?

I've finally met up with some people interested in the
non-profit I've been trying to start.  Actually, they
already are a non-profit and their current project is
the basis of the non-profit I wanted to start.

We're in the market for a database developer to help
us out, basically a service that artists sign up for
that lists their skills and allows them to search for
artists in their area.  We have no money to fund this
but can work out a tax deduction for you if you'd
like.

If you're interested, get back to me and I can give
you more details.

Subject: [sfraves] Review: Sintaxxx-- mixed feelings....


Judging from the super-long BSP, DJ lineup, and the amount of hype it was 
given, I thought this was going to be a huge party. I wasn't sure if I really 
wanted to go to or not, as I am not a big fan of porno-themed raves, and was 
disappointed about T-1000 canceling, but I did want to see Praxis and Dietrich 
Schoenemann. I had hoped to check out some other parties this evening, but Sean 
was pretty set on going to Sintaxxx, so to Sintaxxx we went. 

We arrived around 1:00am, which is usually peak party time, but it looked 
like everyone had gone home already. There were about 15 people in the techno 
room and 30 in the d'n'b room. As for that house room, we never found it. Maybe I 
wasn't looking hard enough...? Was there a third room?? 

Fortunately, the porn theme pretty much ended at the phone sex operator voice 
mail message. I guess we missed the porno karaoke thing. Not a lot of people 
were dressed up for the party, including Sean and I, who are both modest 
people that don't own any porn star clothing. I couldn't really imagine techno fans 
putting on their vinyl g-strings and nipple tassels for a party... 

Though the turnout was low, the music was really good. MC One seamlessly 
blended techno with ravey trance, which turned out a lot better than it sounds. We 
were really impressed by Praxis, who delivered an energetic live techno set. 
It made me happy to see the crowd get so into it-- every time he'd tweak a 
knob on the SH-101 or wave his hand over the Air-FX, people would holler and 
point and get all excited about it. Sean and I danced a lot, and so did everyone 
else, so everybody was pretty exhausted by the time Dietrich Schoenemann came 
on at 3:00. When we first arrived at the party we talked to Dietrich a little 
bit, and he complained about playing to 20 people at a party earlier in the 
night. I felt bad when everyone took off after Praxis' set-- there were only a 
few people left in the Techno room 10 minutes into Dietrich's set. Sean and I 
carried out our duty as The Only People Still Dancing and stayed until the party 
was over. Dietrich played a good set, and I think the people at the party 
would have enjoyed it if they weren't so wrecked after dancing so hard to Praxis' 
set. 

Overall, the good music saved this mediocre party. This party got way too 
much hype considering it was just a no-frills techno and jungle party. More 
attention to detail probably would have made it more worth the $15 admission 
charge. I can't complain too much though, because I had fun and that's the most 
important part. 

Love, Chel-C Faith

Jose all the way out to Reno, Nevada. Dj DoubleDay is 1/2 of iLLKO, the
dark duo from Oaktown. Together, they are unstoppably rocking the Tech/Up
Jungle. Fierceness!!! BREAKS: [12-1:30] MADAME MERCURY (EMUOR, Mad Wax) -
Introduction strictly for the uneducated, Mad Merc is the West Coast
Breaks Queen, dare we say America's Breaks Mistress? Throwing down a full
one and 1/2 hours of boom, prepare for definitive Cali-style breaks!
[10:30-12] CHRIS VIERRA (Terratraxx.com)  vs DJ SPINNER (illko.com, EMUOR)
- Chris V drops the HARDEST ass breaks sets, and he is proving his worth
in a monthly residency in Salt Lake City, Utah. He still finds time to
play in his local territory, the SF Bay Area, so come catch one bad-ass
battling another, DJ Spinner. He is the well proven veteran heart breaking
bass mechanic from iLLKO, rocking since old school residencies with heroes
such as Dan, Garth, Jeno, Joey Mazzola^=C5the list is long. If you miss
this, you miss your brush with greatness. It's Spinner's Birthday to boot,
expect shock and awe!! [9-10:30] BEATSLINGER(ElectricpeopleAM.com) - Local
brainiacs Dj Kid Hype and Dj Deraj Resall in their first year of
independent collab are already on Sponge Records (UK) without batting an
eye. You can find a ton of their work at mp3.com/Beatslinger. Like What?
Brilliance!!

Friday, August 8, 2003 ** Origin **

Euphoria Dreams & Spundae Presents: Origin @ Ten 15 Folsom
Mainroom: Spundae Presents: FC Kahuna with opening set by Taj
Bassment: Tom Slik Dead Dan Cyber Joe
VIP Lounge: DJ Torque Kepi & Kat DJ Hanna
Frontroom: Rafeal Fiero

Three years ago, Dan and Jon Kahuna made the decision that would decide
their future - they closed the doors on the Big Kahuna Burger, the club
that made their name but lost its way, and opened them on new night
Headstart. The result was a new sense of direction, one that has now given
birth to Machine Says Yes, their debut album as FC Kahuna. Machine Says
Yes is an electrifying fusion of futurist acid house and silicon soul,
driven by the sense of adventure and distaste for the mainstream that have
always been the pair's stock in trade. Location: 1015 Folsom St., San

Bassment: Dead Dan Ismael Rodriguez Cyber Joe

Frontroom: Rafeal Fiero

In 2001, as Kinetic records announced they chose the relatively unknown
Max Graham to mix the fourth installment of the Transport mix CD, the
music industry listened.  That year saw Max hit #23 in the coveted DJ
Magazine Top 100 - the highest new entry. While Nick Warren proclaimed Max
was going to be a worldwide success after hearing just a taste of his
production work, Paul Oakenfold himself called and invited the artist to
join him on tour dates through the US to Ibiza after hearing him play just
once. Location: 1015 Folsom St., San Francisco Doors: 10pm-6am, 21+ w/ID

so it is good to drink warm drinks on hot days i have heard. i am finally resting, but briefly. i still didn't find the red thing. i have something in mind, plus, i wouldn't mind some surprise reds. i would invite you formally, but also, i am completely aware that the odds are, i would mostly regret it intensely. :)

Subject: [sfraves] MK5!!!!

Woah, I just learned that there is now a Technics SL1210 MK5 in Europe. 
It has blue LEDs next to the pitch control, which is now switchable 
between ±8% and ±16%, and a blue LED popup light, which looks cooler and 
lasts longer than the current bulb light.  Thats 
Crayeeeezeeee!!!!!!!!!!!  Why don't we get any of the cool stuff over

Subject: [sfraves] sintaxxx (while you were sleeping)

woah, i'm still wrecked from sintaxxx, and i'm sure the talent is too by now. i'd have to say the techno at this party was simply wicked. i haven't seen djs spin such hard wax since Dj Rush came to town with ASR's "as you like it" (props to ASR). Praxis rocked the house all the way live and came representing fully with every bit of flavor in his live set. the set almost killing all left standing with originality and live sequncing of crashing techno madness.  MC-One crushed it with fresh energy and well timed tracks while a people just bailed on Schoeneman.
 -For those who made the egregious error of sleeping on Dietrich Schoeneman's dj set, you really missed out. excellent planning and record programming under an hour and with the most hard, funked, and pounding tracks you might have not thought possible. 
        when i came to this party i came prepared for the worst. half expecting porn stars and more than gratuitous nudity.. maybe i came late for that, but what i witnessed from the techno heads at the space was phenomenal. i was dismayed that at a few points i looked behind me and saw no-one else dancing even though i was up front with a few others. yet everything was just clicking and locking and feeling right on time to the beat in front of me, that i didn't take the time to notice for too long. 
I guess the point of this e-mail is that the survivors left ambulatory at the end had witnessed a powerful music experience and it should have been shared (i was stone cold sober BTW).  you just had to be there, i guess. -Sean Ocean

Thank you to all that came out to AEC :: RAWR! last night. You guys are =
hardcore! It wasn't the best weather conditions last night and yet still =
80+ people braved the weather and came to the party. The people =
celebrating their birthdays at this party were ecstatic about the large =
turnout. You all really made that a special night for some people.=20

Thank you to the dj's (michael, andy, tyler, andrew, john, nick and =
jason) for lending your talents for the night. Big thank you to =
Cloudfactory for the use of their generators after our primary generator =
was deemed inoperable earlier that day. Of course none of this would =
have been possible if it weren't for the generosity of Marshal from =
SwatSound who while sick as hell *still* came out and dropped off//setup =
the sound for us. If you ever need professional sound for your party =
he's your guy. It was a great group effort and a wonderful reunion of =
people that hadn't seen each other in a while. Hope to see you all at =
the next one.

remember...
aec.lubs.you!

i had something cool in mind, and then i picked up a cup of joe, and got sidetracked, and then, i forgot about whatever it was..oh, but there was something else, but also, it is a subject that is boring to me, so why should i bother? i was thinking about velocity, but velocity isn't boring, it is just a way to do things. i saw something really cool, which is also why i am here and not there. i wasn't actually going to be here, but then, i had to go and check out the cool thing again. i can't believe that everyone is as stupid as they are acting. they must be stupid liars, huh? drink up! :)

This was a fun party, better than I expected. Outside looking out at the

Subject: [sfraves] StillDream-in!!!!

Hey everyone,  What a wonderfull weekend!!!!  After a late start getting
on the rode and then getting lost making it about a 3-3 1/2 hour drive. 
StillDream Camp out was off the Hook!  GOOD TIMES!!  Terry dancin away..I
think Dina even did a little shake or two.  =)
I was surprised to see the party still jumping at 6:30am.  Thanks for
either waking up or staying up to listen, dance, and holla to my set.  It
was a refreshing site to see and can only mean the whole party was off the
chain!  and it definately was... minus the few incidents that were handled
quickly and the best possible way.  Thanks for comming out and I cant wait
till next year!!

Peace

Hey was wondering if anyone else happened to be at the Sunset Boat party
last night... For those that were there, I'm sure you had a great time... It
was one of those therapeutic parties to help put your head back on...but I'm
off the sleep before my head falls off again...

**********************************************************************
Neurofeedback to Enhance Musical Performance
**********************************************************************
Bio-feedback, also dubbed neurofeedback, a technique that monitors brain
wave activity via electroencephalogram technologies, was initially used
to treat depression, sleep disorders, head injuries and other health
problems.

Today, the use of technologies like transcranial magnetic stimulation,
or EEG neurofeedback techniques are shifting from therapeutic
applications to those aimed at performance enhancement. The latest use
of this technology allows users to see and alter their own brain waves
by using a visual representation of their neural patterns. This BBC
article cites recent research in the use of neurofeedback to improve
musical ability. Dr Tobias Egner says: "This is the first time
[neurofeedback] has been used to improve a complex set of skills such as
musical performance in healthy students."

Bob Hope, entertainment titan, dies at 100=20
By Pat Nason
UPI Hollywood Reporter
Published 7/28/2003 3:14 PM
View printer-friendly version


LOS ANGELES, July 28 (UPI) -- Bob Hope, who died at the age of 100 =
Sunday evening at his home in Toluca Lake, Calif., was one of the most =
successful and beloved figures in the history of entertainment.

Hope died of pneumonia at 9:28 p.m., said a publicist for the versatile =
performer -- one of the last surviving entertainers who achieved stardom =
across the board in vaudeville, radio, Broadway, movies and TV.

Hope's 100th birthday, May 29, was celebrated throughout the United =
States and in his native England.

Hope -- one of the most decorated performers ever -- added to his list =
of honors when the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce renamed the legendary =
intersection of Hollywood and Vine as Bob Hope Square, and the Los =
Angeles County Board of Supervisors named Hope Citizen of the Century.=20

President George W. Bush mourned Hope's death in a statement issued as =
he was boarding Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base.

"Bob Hope made us laugh, and he lifted our spirits," said Bush. "Bob =
Hope served our nation when he went to battlefields to entertain =
thousands of troops from different generations."

In Los Angeles, Nancy Reagan issued a statement calling Hope "one of our =
dearest friends for over sixty years -- losing him is like losing a =
member of the family. Ronnie always said that Bob was one of our finest =
ambassadors for America and for freedom, spending his lifetime =
entertaining servicemen and women away from home and overseas, =
especially in time of conflict."

Hope -- best known for rapid-fire one-liners, quips and gags -- tickled =
audiences during the dark days of the Depression and World War II and =
became a hero to millions of servicemen and women whom he entertained =
from World War II to the Persian Gulf.

He was nearly 90 when he went to the Gulf.His timely monologues on =
politics, politicians, economics and life in America made him a national =
institution.

His wife, Dolores, told United Press International in an interview in =
the mid-'90s that Hope's monologues provided a roadmap to American =
history over the second half of the 20th century.=20

A frequent and favorite emcee at the Academy Awards, Hope entertained -- =
and was entertained by -- presidents and foreign heads of state. He was =
an unofficial court jester of sorts to both Democrats and Republicans, =
visiting the White House during the administrations from Franklin D. =
Roosevelt to Bill Clinton -- all of whom were subject to his biting wit.

On June 1, 2000, three days after his 97th birthday, Hope underwent =
emergency medical treatment at a Rancho Mirage, Calif., hospital for an =
intestinal problem. Hope and wife Delores had just returned from a =
three-week trip to the East Coast, where he opened the Bob Hope Gallery =
Of Entertainment at the Library Of Congress and donated 88,000 pages of =
comedy material -- including many of his classic jokes. In 2001, a bout =
with bronchitis landed him in a hospital for several days.

During the summer of 1998, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives =
read an erroneous Internet report on the House floor that Hope had died. =
After a correction was made a few minutes later, Hope laughed it off.

Born Leslie Townes Hope May 29, 1903, in Eltham, England, the fifth of a =
stonemason's seven sons, he emigrated at age 4 with his family to =
Cleveland. He was educated in public schools and worked briefly as a =
clerk and fought for a short time as an amateur boxer under the name of =
Packy East.

As he put it, "In my third fight I hit the other man's hand so hard with =
my chin that I woke up in the dressing room. After that I quit."

Hope's debut as a performer was as part of a dance act with another =
youth, George Byrne, and a two-week engagement with Fatty Arbuckle when =
the silent screen star played a Cleveland theater. Hope changed his =
first name to Bob and did a blackface act in vaudeville with Byrne in =
Detroit, Pittsburgh and New York.

He became a single act in New Castle, Ind., when he was asked to =
introduce Marshall Walker and his Whiz Bang Revue. His quips had the =
audience roaring with laughter, enough to encourage him to become a =
comedian, playing small night clubs and stag parties.

It was a long, hard climb and for several years he barely eked out a =
living. Eventually he was signed by the Interstate Circuit, a vaudeville =
organization that took him to New York where he became a headliner with =
the RKO circuit. Gradually he made the transition from vaudeville to =
legitimate theater and by 1927 he was in his first Broadway show, "The =
Sidewalks Of New York."

Between 1928 and 1932 he traveled the nightclub and small-theater =
circuit as a stand-up comic. Later in 1932 he reached the Broadway stage =
in the musical comedy "Ballyhoo." His first big part came in 1933's =
"Roberta" and he began earning star salaries for "Ziegfeld Follies" and =
"Red Hot and Blue."

During the run of "Roberta," Hope met nightclub singer Delores Reade. =
They were married in 1934. They have four children, Linda, Tony, Nora =
and Kelly.

Hope first performed on radio in 1935 and three years later had his own =
show on a major network, joining such comedic giants as Eddie Cantor, =
Jack Benny and Edgar Bergen. Hope surpassed them all with 1,145 =
broadcasts.

He made his movie debut in "The Big Broadcast Of 1938," a box-office hit =
that introduced the song "Thanks for the Memory," which became his theme =
song. He starred in more than 50 movies, including "The Cat and the =
Canary"

(1939),"Caught in the Draft" (1941), "My Favorite Blonde" (1942), =
"Louisiana Purchase" (1941), "The Paleface" (1948), "The Lemon Drop Kid" =
(1951), "The Seven Little Foys" (1955), "Alias Jesse James" (1959) and =
many more.

His most popular movies, however, were his "Road" pictures, mostly in =
the '40s, co-starring with longtime friends Bing Crosby and Dorothy =
Lamour, starting with 1940's "The Road to Singapore." They were =
Paramount's most successful films of the '40s, and from 1941 to 1953, =
except for 1948, Hope ranked among the top 10 studio moneymakers.

Hope's final movie starring role came in 1972's "Cancel My Reservations" =
although he made several cameo appearances after that.

He was one of the first radio and screen stars to recognize the =
potential of television. Soon after the completion of the =
transcontinental coaxial cable, Hope began a weekly 60-minute television =
series. It continued well into the 1960s -- always at the top of the =
ratings -- when the demands on his time became too great. He reduced his =
workload to six specials a year.=20

Hope, who regularly employed eight gag writers at huge salaries to =
supply him with topical quips, was praised for his phenomenal memory of =
jokes.

"I can recall thousands of jokes but they usually come to mind in =
association with something else," Hope said. "But I've told so many =
jokes over the years there's no way that I can remember more than a =
fraction of them."

Hope was one of a handful of entertainers to be awarded four stars on =
the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one each for movies, radio, TV and theater.=20

A longtime host of the annual Academy Awards ceremonies, Hope never got =
an Oscar for acting but was given special Oscars or other honors five =
times -- in 1940, 1944, 1952, 1959 and 1965 -- for his humanitarianism =
and contributions to the film industry.

On Oct. 29, 1997, Congress honored Hope by naming him an honorary =
veteran.

"I've traveled all over the world and never met a better audience than =
this," he told Congress.

In 1998 he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth. "What =
an honor and what a surprise for a boy born in England, raised in =
Cleveland and schooled in vaudeville," he said.

On the night of May 29, 1983, Hope's 80th birthday, he was honored at =
Washington's Kennedy Center with a three-hour telecast that featured a =
score of celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, George Burns and Lucille =
Ball as well as stars who were not born when Hope became a household =
name.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s Hope came in for some criticism =
for his political leanings and support of U.S. involvement in foreign =
wars.=20

But honorary degrees from various universities around the country and =
his long-running romance with the public enabled him to weather the =
negative reaction.

Hope was an avid golfer. He sponsored a PGA golf tournament at Palm =
Springs each year, and had a small golf course built on the grounds of =
his Toluca Lake estate.

Hope was also a part owner of the Cleveland Indians baseball team at one =
time.

For years, Hope was one of the wealthiest men in America, with a =
personal fortune largely made up of real estate holdings.

not...just messing around. i have some info in my brain that i absolutely don't want to share, but just to wonder: why is it that people allow certain industry or preconcieved notions define their level of comfort? i am not really interested in anyone's view point on the subject, to be perfectly honest. what is the point of talking about it when, as we all know, the damage has already been done. if the damage has been done, you might try cave living. it has been being re-explored, and reinvented now for over one hundred years. what i am speaking of, is hi-tech cave living. go to your cave, never come out again. i think that might change  a few things. gotta go ride my new horse. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Going back to school party 8/16

 Talk about positive karma!!!! A teacher in a class I'm taking turned me
on to a program funded by a bunch of tech industries and the government
that, if your accepted, will pay for your upgrade in your computer skills
(like being competent with CompTIA Network +,CompTIA A +, Windows 2000
server, DOSS, Bookkeeper, Microsoft MOUS/Red Hat certification, computer
repair, etc.). Not a big deal for all the advanced teckies on the list,
but for me it's a big deal, mostly because it's all free and EDD
accepted! Things I've been wanting to do for a long time, but never
having enough money or time to do. Why I feel so thankful is that this
program is very limited (only 20 people accepted) and next year it won't
be free anymore and I was fortunate enough to be at the right place and
at the right time to get in. I'll be going to school much of the week and
doing mandatory community service on the side (to help pay for my
training), upgrading and building computers for the Oakland Schools. And
what else is pretty cool about all this is that I can upgrade my computer
for free for volunteering. 

 Free school and free hardware!!!

 What this shows is that, even in hard economic times like these, there
is a way to make it. We just have to know what our way or making it is.
It took lot of faith in myself, in my dreams and goals, in the goodness
and timing of life and in the karma of it all to have this opportunity
come to me.

 So, to celebrate my wonderful blessings, I'm considering doing a free
day party at my house on Saturday, August 16th, the weekend before
school, if this is a good date. I have a pretty good size back yard and
the neighbors are cool about the music during the day if I give them a
warning. 

 Here's my idea:
Begin around noonish until dark, may push it longer if we can keep it not
too loud.
Someone will help provide a sound system and turntables (mine's not all
that good)
I'll buy a keg (for 21 and over peeps)
Everybody contribute in bringing bbq stuff for a bbq and picnic
and let's party!!!

 If your interested in celebrating with me, hit back with a RSVP and let
me know if you will help with anything so I'll know how many people to
expect. Suggestions to help make this a hella phat party are definatly
welcome!

 To keep things safe and from potentialy getting out of hand, this will
not an open party. This is for SFravers, and invited guests only. 

 Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

sorry i was gone for so long.  first of all, i found out that in some cases, my workplace has a 128K internet 
connection for about 300-400 people.  that's about all i can say about that ... or am willing to say about it, i 
don't know which is more true.  ask osby.  maybe he'll fill you in.  the other thing is somehow the server my 
domain name accounts are on somehow selected my username to delete.  is this weird or was it just meant 
to happen?  anyway.  on a good note, i'm getting used to the humidity on the east coast, actually it's kind of 
fun.  

anyway, i'll try to put in a full week of quotes.  no guarantees!

Ain't that the fuckin' truth. I just got back from shredding my favorite mogul
field  on rollerblades tonight -- the "wavy" concrete outside of 
pac-bell-stadium  (between the stadium and the water). If you get going pretty
fast, you can slalom between the crests and the hills, and get this really 
cool rhythm going. I had some 100BPM Indian Hip-Hop/Bhangra playing on
the Ipod and it was SWEEET -- tha big drums going whoooomph.... 
dum--dum-dum--dum-dum-dum---WHOOOOMPH--dum--dum-dum--dum-dum-dum---WHOOMPH. 
Anyways, the velocity and the motion are kinda
like you would get doing a mogul field, but a lot gentler and more regular.
And due to velocity, as you're going up each crest, you can be banking your
turn (into the "mogul"), and then right at the top you're completely neutral
and transitioning  your weight into the next turn. It's really quite an 
incredible feeling.

Shredding rules. If you can't shred at whatever
you're doing (or do not have the will to learn to shred) don't bother doing
it. So sick of people "going through the motions" in life... whether it
be relationships, their job/career/life, friendships, dancing, health, eating, 
whatever.

Geri? Do you shred?

12- month period.

market.

* I am the first president in US history to enter office with a criminal
record. 

* In my first year in office I set the all-time record for most days on
vacation by any president in US history. 

* After taking the entire month of August off for vacation, I presided
over the worst security failure in US history. 

* I set the record for most campaign fund raising trips by any president
in US history. 

* In my first two years in office over 2 million Americans lost their
job. 

* I cut unemployment benefits for more out-of-work Americans than any
other president in US history. 

* I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. 

* I appointed more convicted criminals to administration positions than
any president in US history. 

* I set the record for the fewest press conferences of any president
since the advent of TV. 

* I signed more laws and executive orders amending the Constitution than
any other president in US history. 

* I presided over the biggest energy crises in US history and refused to
intervene when corruption was revealed. 

* I presided over the highest gasoline prices in US history and refused
to use the national reserves as past presidents have. 

* I cut health care benefits for war veterans. 

* I set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously
take to the streets to protest me (15 million people), shattering the
record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. 

* I dissolved more international treaties than any president in US
history. 

* I've made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in
US history. 

* Members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in US
history. (The 'poorest' multimillionaire, Condoleezza Rice, has a
Chevron oil tanker named after her). 

* I am the first president in US history to have all 50 states of the
Union simultaneously go insolvent. 

* I presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud in any market
in any country in the history of the world. 

* I am the first president in US history to order a US attack and
military occupation of a sovereign nation, and I did so against the will
of the United Nations and the world community.

history of the United States. 

* I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending
increases, more than any other president in US history.

election inspectors access during the 2002 US elections.

campaign donations.

best friends, presided over one of the largest corporate bankruptcy
frauds in world history (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation).
I spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in US
history. 

* I am the first president to run and hide when the US came under attack
(and then lied, saying the enemy had the code to Air Force 1) 

* I am the first US president to establish a secret shadow government. 

* I took the world's sympathy for the US after 911, and in less than a
year made the US the most resented country in the world (possibly the
biggest diplomatic failure in US and world history). 

* I am the first US president in history to have a majority of the
people of Europe (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world
peace and stability.

Korea more threatened by the US than by their immediate neighbor, North

government contracts. 

* I set the all-time record for number of administration appointees who
violated US law by not selling their huge investments in corporations
bidding for gov't contracts.

than two years turned every single economic category heading straight
down.

* I was AWOL from the National Guard and deserted the military during a
time of war. I refuse to take a drug test or even answer any questions
about drug use. 

* All records of my tenure as governor of Texas have been spirited away
to my father's library, sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public
view. 

* All records of any SEC investigations into my insider trading or
bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public
view. 

* All minutes of meetings of any public corporation for which I served
on the board are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. 

* Any records or minutes from meetings I (or my VP) attended regarding
public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public
review. 




* PERSONAL REFERENCES: 



* For personal references, please speak to my dad or James Baker (They

helping to divide up the spoils of the US-Iraq war and plan for the next
one.)

I read all the items and:

1. I couldn't find a single one that I knew was not true.

2. Many of them are definitely true. 

3. Many more might be true, or very likely to be true, but GWB's cloud of secrecy prevents us from knowing for sure. 

4. A few could be blamed on US policy in general, but Bush has made them worse than previous presidents. 

I'm 43 years old and have seen a lot of presidents. I thought Reagan was terrible, but he doesn't hold a candle to Bush.

I'm afraid it's the same here- there are a few shaky ones, but nearly
all of the core facts stated in Jason's email *are* verified truths,
albiet worded a little strangely in parts.

Whether we're nailing the facts to the ground or not, it's gonna be a
pretty tough sell to try and tell any of us that GWB is not one of the
worst presidents this nation's ever endured, Dan.

A sh*tty president is a sh*tty president is a sh*tty president.

too tired to write a coherent review - so i will just summarize with =
some key points...

* Venue is very nice, clean, in a very nice neighborhood, lots of =
dancing room, some pool tables (6 i think), some arcade games, an =
outdoor smoking patio, and 2 bars (only 1 was open last night)
* Drinks are nice, strong, and cheap... even though all i had were the =
$2 long island ice teas; i figure the other drinks are PROBABLY good =
too...
* great concept of having open tables (30 minute slots).... and if you =
dont like whats playing, something else will be on within 30 minutes...
* location is central :: 30 - 45 minutes from San Jose, 10 - 15 minutes =
from Fremont, 15 - 20 minutes from SF, 10 - 15 minutes from Oakland / =
Berkeley...
* Drank too much on monday night - now i have a headache.... blah!

i hope that makes sense....

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  teach kids to DJ

saw this on craigslist:

http://www.craigslist.org/eby/npo/13999650.html

Do you want to make good money doing what you love to do? DJing that is!

Community Learning Services (CLS), an education non-profit, is offering a
one week mini-course on "How to be a DJ" from August 4-8th from 4-6pm. We're 
looking for an instructor to teach the class. . .those who have worked with 
youth and/or taught before are preferred. The class will be held at Cafe 
Eclectica at 1309 Solano Ave, Albany and will have up to 10 students.

Here's the Course Description for Youth:
Who wants to be a DJ? You do! This class is designed for turntable
newcomers who want to learn the basics. You will learn firsthand how to
mix, blend, scratch, and beat juggle from Bay Area DJ’s. Turntables
provided for class.

If you like working with youth ages 14-18, love teaching how to DJ, and
can provide your own turntables/records/needles. . .this is the job for you.

If interested, send me an email (bfinnin@communitylearningservices.org) with 
your background and an outline of what you would teach.

Thanks,

Barb

we hang out right here, and a bunch of other places! don't forget USENET
as well as private NNTP sources such as news.cakewalk.com. And also the
http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?community_us bboards.

regarding USENET, sometimes, really useful discussions happen in strange
places like alt.binaries.sound.utilities and alt.binaries.sound.utilities.d 
... Also all the usual comp.music.* and *midi* etc yadda yadda ymv rtfm tanstaafl.

actually, the first flash mob was in new york, about a month before sf
people did one. london, tokyo and minneapolis also saw them before or
around the same time as sf.

The Flash Mob thing was funny for about 5 days. I mean, if they really

  Those two countries are, AFGANISTAN AND IRAQ, so far.
 Afganistan has a bumper poppy production this year thanks to American
"liberation". Talaban
 law is being reestablished, and our puppet leader, Karazi controlls ONLY
Kabul.
 American troops are being picked off one/two/three or more a day in
Iraq, not helping our cause 
 by displaying dead bodies in public, even if they were creeps,
DISRESPECTING ISLAMIC LAW. 
 It's OK for the US to use thug violence in the streets of Iraq, but not
for the g-boy in the streets of 
 East Oakland? Whatz up with the hypocracy? This is turning more into a
people's guerrilla war 
 instead of a Sadam led war. So what if we get Sadam? The war will
continue. It's not about Sadam, 
 it's about being occupied by "Christian" invaders.

 When Bush took over, there was a 3t surplus, now were down to -2t and

the early 90's, came in and

 Thanks to "free trade", we are becoming a poor nation. Jobs are going
overseas, WHAT JOBS ARE
 LEFT are $6p/h jobs with no health care and (coming soon) no overtime.
There is a possibility we may
 have a permanent 20-30% unemployed/underemployed rate in the US because
of "free trade". 
 Neo-Cons (yes they are cons!) are cool with that. More unemployed means
more eccess labor
 "competing" for what few jobs there are, thus they can pay them what
they want and treat them any way 
 they like. Good for THE BOTTOM LINE. 1870's here we come!!!!

 when Americans start to die because of budget cuts for needed social

 I'm not sure this is correct, but he did have a chemical dependency

service" was "fixed", the man who sends
 American soldiers to impliment the PNAC (project for a new American
century) doctrine, the 
 international version of the Manifest Destiny doctrine, AND NEVER SAW A
DAY IN COMBAT! 
 What a man!!! Why are white people so violent? Not so much because of
their Aryan/Nordic heratage.
 I speculate because, on the average, white boys have small dicks and
have to act like dicks in the world to  make up for their "percieved
deficit". ALL OF THEM, BUSH, CHENEY, ROMSFELD, PEARL AND 
 WOLSOVITZ (don't want to spend time correcting his name) HAVE SMALL
DICKS AND NEED TO ACT
 BIG IN OTHER PLACES.. Condollezza Rice has no dick, but is fustrated
that none of them is big enough 
 for her. Dildo user. As for John Ashcroft, he is so obcessed with the
burden of sin, HIS SMALL DICK NEVER   GETS USED, so he takes it out on
our freedoms! ALL OF THEM ARE CLOSET PERVERTS, like many
 radical conservatives are. At least liberals are out and proud about
being "perverts". Clinton admitted he
 got head and the conservatives got hella jellous (small dick complex)! 
When will George Bush admitt

 The number of unemployed is around 8-9 million people, not including

6.4% and growing, not

 It's a drag down fight to extend unemployment for laid off workers.
Neo-cons consider unemployment
 insurance, among other social services as "socialism", and for every $
spent on the poor (loosers)
 means less money for the rich (winners). IT'S A SINK OR SWIM WORLD OUT

John Ashcroft said back in '01 that anyone who thinks the constitution

"FANTASY LAND". Not exact, but real close to what he said. Hard
conservitives don't believe in liberty,
their definition of freedom is the right for the privilege class to rule
over the masses. Freedom is something
that is granted from on high by the ruling elites (Bush represents) like
bread and water if we earn it. HARD
CONSERVATIVES BY NATURE ARE FASCISTS. EVEN SO CALLED SOCIALISTS LIKE
STALIN AND
CHENESCOU OF ROMANIA WERE REALLY CONSERVATIVES. They used socialism to be
fascists.

Now that would kick ass!

Alright, who wants to meet up in front of the Ferry Building at 12:15 
pm on Saturday for a fight mob? We need at least 100 to beat the hell 
out of each other for 3 minutes and disappear...  Just try not to punch 
up the bystanders. We don't want any charges pressed ;)

We're the bay area, if we're going to do it we gotta show up New York
that's for sure. I like the superman idea too.  Or just plain
superhero's that way more people could get a costume together quick.

Endless possibilites of things to do.  We should try to make them
non-political for once too.  Imma go home watch Triggerhappy TV for
ideas...

You're talking about "projected", not actual. Sorry, I haven't heard about
the neo-cons cleaning out Russia.

It's the biggest deficit in absolute terms, but not relative to the GDP.
So this point is technically correct, but misleading in its implication.

Again, this is probably a record in absolute terms, but not as a
percentage. After all, there are more people now than ever before, so it
makes sense that the absolute number of bankruptcies will keep going up.
As for your point, why shouldn't people in poor countries have the chance
to compete with Americans for work? "There is a possibility", sure, but
not a reasonable one.

The stock market dropped because there was a huge bubble built up during
the Clinton administration! It's still overvalued by most historical
measures. The corporate scandals (what, a dozen companies out of
thousands) have nothing to do with the stock market returning to more
reasonable valuations.

You called Condoleeza Rice a "dildo user". You've convinvenced me of your
position now! Might as well stop the discussion right here.

Again, the job losses were because of huge overcapacity in the economy
after Y2K and the stock market bubble. The economy started to slide before
Bush was elected. Presidents don't actually have that much power over the
economy anyway.

Wow, anyone in power who you disagree with can now be brushed off as
a "token minority"??? You're a fucking racist. *plonk*

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NO WAR (except for Liberia) :: nrr

I think we're all jaded and warred out now.  Or tired.  But I'll offer
my two cents..  I don't know too much about whats going on.  I hear
so-and-so is a bad dictator and the people are protesting against him
and we're helping them.  How is this different than israel and palestine
though?  Oh yeah, because israel is our friends and palestine is just a
rogue nation of people pushed out of their homes a while back and for
some reason are pissed off about it.  And what about the south american
coup of the week?  Why does the media only pick one hotspot at a time.
And whatever happened to North Korea?  Did they just crawl back into a
hole?  I haven't heard anything about how relations are going with them
now..  And india and china blaming each other for running missions into
the others countries.  And India and Pakistan always at it of coruse.
And possible fighting between Thailand and Cambodia.. Or was it Laos...
Its just too much to handle.  Nothing anyone does to help helps, it just
seems to fan the flames while being swept under the rug.  We're tired of
it all.  Its hard to pick something to protest or talk about when we
have too much to choose from.. Which one is the worse of worses.
Although I think in Libya we're helping an already mounting body count
in a country were agressions are flying high and the people won't take
it anymore.  They want help, but they were willing to start without us.
I have no idea where I'm going with this.  I'm tired.  War sucks.

Probably because the people of Liberia have been begging for some sort 
of military intervention by outsiders? Because other countries in the 
UN (including those cowardly French) had already sent troops there 
months ago? Just a thought...   :)

so regardless of the support from other countries; all those "pro-life" and
"anti-war" people are for some strange reason, "ok with this war"?
interesting how some people will just drop their morals because something is
"widely accepted".

No one ever said that all people protesting the war were "pro-life" or 
against war in general. Many of us were and continue to be against 
unjustified, unsanctioned, unilateral wars.

I don't think most of the thoughtful people on this list develop their 
beliefs about war based on popular opinion, as you seem to suggest.  There 
are some who are pacifists and, therefore, are against all use of deadly 
force on moral grounds.  Others, and I include myself here, would support a 
defensive war like WWII while opposing a pre-emptive war like that waged in 
Iraq.  As for Liberia, I believe the United Nations should take action in 
concert with other nations to end the slaughter there.  'Tis all not black 
'n white.

Love,

Apollo

not at all - but it's pretty painstaking clear that we have a "leader" (I 
dare not call him a President) in office that will follow an agenda 
regardless of what his constituents desire.  It seems like a waste of 
energy to protest another war, when last time, we were heard and ignored.

In ancient Greece, Socrates was reputed to hold knowledge in high
esteem.

One day an acquaintance met the great philosopher and said, "Socrates,
do you know what I just heard about your best friend?"

"Hold on a minute," Socrates replied. "Before telling me anything, I'd like
you to pass a little test.  It's called the Triple Filter Test."

"Triple filter?"

"That's right," Socrates continued.  "Before you talk to me about my 
friend, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what you're 
going to say.
The first filter is Truth.  Have you made absolutely sure that what you are 
about to tell me is true?"

"No," the man said, "actually I just heard about it and................"

"All right," said Socrates.  "So, you don't really know if it's true or not.
Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness.  Is what you are 
about to tell me about my friend something good?"

 > > >"No, on the contrary.........."

"So," Socrates continued, "you want to tell me something bad about him,but 
you're not certain it's true.
You may still pass the test though, because there's one filter left:the 
filter of Usefulness.
  Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?"

"No, not really."

"Well," concluded Socrates, "if what you want to tell me is neither
true nor good, nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?"


This is why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.
It also explains why he never found out his best friend was banging his wife.

i think your example is flawed.... i dont see how the knowledge of ones
bestfriend banging their wife would be classified as useless information. if
my bestfriend was banging my wife; i sure as hell would not classify that
knowledge as useless information. i think that anyone who WOULD consider
that useless information is most likely a coward and too scared to face the
harsh realities that exist in this world; and clearly prefer to live their
life in a false reality.

LOL...gotta love you guys....  It IS a joke (with a point or two), but 
Socrates definition of useful information and ours would probably be much 
different.

Personally, I'd rather call him the president-select than a leader any day.
George Bush is the president, it's his job title, he might not have gotten
there through even close to legitimate means, he's not a good president, no.
But he is the president at the moment and he's anything but a leader, and if
"we have a 'leader' then that implies you follow him... And that's a
misconception I will do anything to stop... Oh shit, I think I just tipped
off Homeland Security again... Here comes the black choppers...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Thought for Today

No Cheese -- the example isn't flawed at all... Remember the first part of
the filter; *Truth* -- The man who came to Socrates did not know that it was
true that Socrates friend was sleeping with his wife -- it was only hearsay,
a rumor. If he had known it to be certain then it would've passed the first
of the three filters. An unsubstantiated rumor of infidelity is not liable
to be beneficial as it will lead Socrates to question the trust that he has
instilled in both his friend and his wife, when in fact it could simply be
slanderous gossip. Furthermore, of what use is it to Socrates to know that
someone out there thinks that his bestfriend is sleeping with his wife?
Sure, now he can call them on it, but we both know they'd just deny it. He
can become suspicious and try to catch them in the act but that means that
he's abandoned the trust that he placed in his bestfriend and his spouse and
doing so based on nothing more than a rumor is not only unwise but also sure
to be damaging to both his relationship with his friend and his wife.
Furthermore, assuming that the rumor was not true, then the man who
approached Socrates could've been responsible for ruining not one but two
important relationships in Socrates life. Is that useful? No.

Great piece of wisdom Apollo, and even with the joke thrown in -- it still
stands up. Namaste.

Likewise.  If that shit sandwich gave two fucks about what the people wanted,
it would never have accepted the office in the first place.  Instead, it had
daddy's friends hand the world to it on a silver platter.  So who thinks that
the opinion of the people matters NOW?  And for that matter, who thinks it
mattered at the beginning or Iraq pt. 2 in the first place?

Myself, I'm about as against the wars (Iraq, the possible Korea Mk 2, AND now
Liberia) as they come.  But I didn't go tromping through SF back at the start
of Iraq.  And I won't likely be out protesting if Liberia pops.  It's been
quite clear to me since about November of 2000-ish that the opinion and the
votes of the people don't matter in this country anymore.  So what's the point?

And quite frankly, I have better things to do with my time than go get beaten
up by the government's uniformed thugs for having the "wrong" politicial
opinion about the war.

john

Ah, so blind worship of it is a better idea?  Or are flimsy rationialization,
double standards, and dismissials of any criticism ("Surely, he can do NO
wrong, for he is Caesar!") more your cup of tea?

Furthermore, you say that as if there weren't a flock of xtian-right trolls

The key point there was "rubbish", not "liberal."

If you think what was going on in the streets of SF with the cops sucked --
read this story about 3 nuns who's protest against the war has resulted in
2+ year prison terms. They did what they believed in, are accepting the
consequences of their actions and I salute them for doing what you and I

I thank god every day that the tree hugger Gore didn't get elected.  I
didn't vote for either but we would still be having thinking sessions on

Likewise.  If that shit sandwich gave two fucks about what the people
wanted,
it would never have accepted the office in the first place.  Instead, it
had
daddy's friends hand the world to it on a silver platter.  So who thinks
that
the opinion of the people matters NOW?  And for that matter, who thinks
it
mattered at the beginning or Iraq pt. 2 in the first place?

Myself, I'm about as against the wars (Iraq, the possible Korea Mk 2,
AND now
Liberia) as they come.  But I didn't go tromping through SF back at the
start
of Iraq.  And I won't likely be out protesting if Liberia pops.  It's
been
quite clear to me since about November of 2000-ish that the opinion and
the
votes of the people don't matter in this country anymore.  So what's the
point?

And quite frankly, I have better things to do with my time than go get
beaten
up by the government's uniformed thugs for having the "wrong" politicial
opinion about the war.

On the contrary, bush gives me the willies.  I didn't vote for him.  I
hate how he protects the Saudis.  I hate that no one from Enron isn't in
jail yet but Martha stewart (a democrat) is being thrown to the lions.
I wanted john mccain to get nominated but the party would rather have
old money in charge.  Makes me sick.  I do however support the war in
iraq and the war on terror.  I think iran should be next followed by
north korea.  I see nothing wrong with freeing citizens of despotic
regimes.  The "left" was once the same way but they have lost their
moral compass.

Ah, so blind worship of it is a better idea?  Or are flimsy
rationialization,
double standards, and dismissials of any criticism ("Surely, he can do
NO
wrong, for he is Caesar!") more your cup of tea?

Furthermore, you say that as if there weren't a flock of xtian-right

lurking under SFRaves bridge' as well.  Case in point... well... just go

Don't you think that maybe, just maybe, we should clean up the mess in
Iraq first?  Scarlet, I suppose you fully support re-instating the Draft
to provide the troops to invide Iran and North Korea... because you are
certinaly beyond the draftable age, right?  Becuase our all-volenteer 
army to be difficult to recruit for the purpose of America's Impire-building.
Who wants to spend 1 year deployments in countries where they hate you?

You know, they are cutting the number of Air Marshals becuase of budget
problems.  At the same time they are warning about new Hijacking threats.

Don't you think America would be safer if we spent the 100 billion on the Iraq
war on homeland security?

Don't you think the real War on Terror would be more effective if we were
not bogged down in Iraq?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [Politics-NRR]Time to stir the pot from the bottom this time

I'm a member of the armed forces already and no I don't want to
reinstitute the draft.  It waters down the professional soldiers we have
with unworthy talent.  

I've spent most of my adult life in countries where they "hate" us.  You
can always find someone in those countries that like you (korea,
germany).  

We aren't bogged down in iraq.  I hope you aren't saying that you listen
to the liberal media shouting QUAGMIRE!  Because it isn't like that at
all.  America is rebuilding that country and doing so faster than is
being reported by the idiots at CNN and the BBC.

The war on terror is going to be pennies on the dollar compared to
ignoring the problem like Clinton did.  I will not vote for anyone that
wants to be soft on terror.  Ever.  I wish I could take by my votes for
Clinton because he cause the problems that we are seeing today.  Because
of his inaction, we are seeing nuclear proliferation problems and a
growing terrorist threat.  The only way to stop these issues is to carry
a big stick and not be afraid to whack people with it.

Don't you think that maybe, just maybe, we should clean up the mess in
Iraq first?  Scarlet, I suppose you fully support re-instating the Draft
to provide the troops to invide Iran and North Korea... because you are
certinaly beyond the draftable age, right?  Becuase our all-volenteer 
army to be difficult to recruit for the purpose of America's
Impire-building.
Who wants to spend 1 year deployments in countries where they hate you?

You know, they are cutting the number of Air Marshals becuase of budget
problems.  At the same time they are warning about new Hijacking
threats.

Don't you think America would be safer if we spent the 100 billion on
the Iraq
war on homeland security?

Don't you think the real War on Terror would be more effective if we
were
not bogged down in Iraq?

Really?  Thats the only way?

Its our policy that is forcing Iran to accelerate their nuclear program.
I don't blame them at all.  I would be doing the same thing If I were them,
and my enemy was at my boarder.

It seems that the more we piss them off, the more support they will have
to carry out more terrorists activities.

We can never force peace at the barrel of a gun.  

The more we "whack" them, the more resent they will feel to us, and the
more they will want to harm us.

You don't have a clue as to what is really going on in iran.  The people
there are revolting against their theocratic masters.  They want freedom
and democracy.  How is whacking the current corrupt and criminal
government going to piss the people of iran off?  Hmmm?

I am giving the Adminstration the benefit of the doubt on Iraq.  Lets
revisit this conversation in 1 year to see if the people of Iraq are
more happy at that time.

Honestly, I hope they are.

But we should certainly wait to make sure we are not doing more harm than
good in Iraq before we consider bombing other countries.

Regardless, it takes billions of dollars to "whack" these countries.  If
we are going to do it, we must raise taxes to pay for it.  Lets see if
the right-wing still supports that policy then.

I checked SFstation, but it seems that if one is interested in something other than deep and prog house, hip hop or reggae, then you are out of luck on wednesdays.
 
Specifically, I'm looking for techno and electro, if its house i want booty house or old school chicago house, NO TRANCE... also italo disco and new wave good too. and sound-arty stuff! 

Any tips? 
thanks!

fuck you, i have family from Iran and family *in* Iran.  yes there 
are people revolting and there are even people who are dear to me 
who had to flee the country in the 1980s, but NOT ONE of them 
wants the US to bomb the shit out of their country.

Check out www.djunderground.com and go to the calendar of events.  There are
three events going on, and two of them have techno going on.

Hope this helps.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [Politics-NRR]Time to stir the pot from the bottom this time

I just wanna know when the war on terror is going to turn inward.
Stopping our current terrorist organizations like street gangs,
anti-government milita groups that do incite violence (militia groups
are a constitutional right), violent aryan groups (free speech until
they turn violent), violent christian groups that blow up abortion
clinics, and violent envionmental groups.  It's only a matter of time
before someone with a lot of intelligence in one of these groups is able
to put together a nuke as well.  It can be done without a lot of
equipment, minus the uranium.  We have plenty of terrorists inside our
borders that need to be delt with on the same level we deal with groups
like Hamas and Al-Qaeda.  I see no difference with some guy walking into
a caf=E9 in israel and blowing himself up and a carfull of thugs in
Oakland shooting up a neighborhood and taking down innocents in
crossfire.  Here's some old material but a survey of 45 cities, reported
that there were around 1500 street gangs with as many as 120,000 members
between them.  That=92s a pretty damn big army of terrorists spread =
across
45 cities.

I'm a member of the armed forces already and no I don't want to

I've spent most of my adult life in countries where they "hate" us.  You

We aren't bogged down in iraq.  I hope you aren't saying that you listen

all.  America is rebuilding that country and doing so faster than is
being reported by the idiots at CNN and the BBC.

The war on terror is going to be pennies on the dollar compared to
ignoring the problem like Clinton did.  I will not vote for anyone that
wants to be soft on terror.  Ever.  I wish I could take by my votes for
Clinton because he cause the problems that we are seeing today.  Because
of his inaction, we are seeing nuclear proliferation problems and a
growing terrorist threat.  The only way to stop these issues is to carry
a big stick and not be afraid to whack people with it. =20

Don't you think that maybe, just maybe, we should clean up the mess in
Iraq first?  Scarlet, I suppose you fully support re-instating the Draft
to provide the troops to invide Iran and North Korea... because you are
certinaly beyond the draftable age, right?  Becuase our all-volenteer=20
army to be difficult to recruit for the purpose of America's
Impire-building. Who wants to spend 1 year deployments in countries
where they hate you?

You know, they are cutting the number of Air Marshals becuase of budget
problems.  At the same time they are warning about new Hijacking
threats.

Don't you think America would be safer if we spent the 100 billion on
the Iraq war on homeland security?

Don't you think the real War on Terror would be more effective if we
were not bogged down in Iraq?

Excuses excuses.  Aside from Israel exactly who near Iran has nukes and
hates
Iran?  Come on, be specific ok?  But then let's not forget Iran's claim that
"it's only
for power."  At least if they were honest about the program and said what
makes
them want nukes and what they plan to achieve by having them, etc.  I mean,
Iran
doesn't have much in the way of natural resources so I can totally
understand why
they'd go for nuclear power....

You think so?  When is the last time we "whacked" Iran?  And yes, carrying a
big
stick is a good idea.  Using it, when needed, is also a good idea.  The S.
Koreans, i'm
sure, would agree with me on this point.

The day a private group like the ones you describe can turn uranium into
weapons grade
material is the day I start believing in the easter bunny lol.  I'm sure
uncle same keeps tabs
pretty well on said groups in our boarders in relation to them trying a
stunt like a nuke and
or getting fissionable material of the type needed to go nuclear.

Don't you think that maybe, just maybe, we should clean up the mess in
Iraq first?  Scarlet, I suppose you fully support re-instating the Draft
to provide the troops to invide Iran and North Korea... because you are
certinaly beyond the draftable age, right?  Becuase our all-volenteer
army to be difficult to recruit for the purpose of America's
Impire-building. Who wants to spend 1 year deployments in countries
where they hate you?

You know, they are cutting the number of Air Marshals becuase of budget
problems.  At the same time they are warning about new Hijacking
threats.

Don't you think America would be safer if we spent the 100 billion on
the Iraq war on homeland security?

Don't you think the real War on Terror would be more effective if we
were not bogged down in Iraq?

I just wanna know when the war on terror is going to turn inward.
Stopping our current terrorist organizations like street gangs,
anti-government milita groups that do incite violence (militia groups
are a constitutional right), violent aryan groups (free speech until
they turn violent), violent christian groups that blow up abortion
clinics, and violent envionmental groups.  It's only a matter of time
before someone with a lot of intelligence in one of these groups is able
to put together a nuke as well.  It can be done without a lot of
equipment, minus the uranium.  We have plenty of terrorists inside our
borders that need to be delt with on the same level we deal with groups
like Hamas and Al-Qaeda.  I see no difference with some guy walking into

Actually.  I think the south Korean government is full of cowards and
communist sympathizers.  They are still trying to resurrect the failed
"sunshine policy" meanwhile millions of their family members in the
north are starving and being brutalized by the north Korean government.

Excuses excuses.  Aside from Israel exactly who near Iran has nukes and
hates
Iran?  Come on, be specific ok?  But then let's not forget Iran's claim
that
"it's only
for power."  At least if they were honest about the program and said
what
makes
them want nukes and what they plan to achieve by having them, etc.  I
mean,
Iran
doesn't have much in the way of natural resources so I can totally
understand why
they'd go for nuclear power....

You think so?  When is the last time we "whacked" Iran?  And yes,
carrying a
big
stick is a good idea.  Using it, when needed, is also a good idea.  The
S.
Koreans, i'm
sure, would agree with me on this point.

And what about the millions of Americans homeless and hungry who are
being brutalized by the police and the current economy. I just add fuel
to a fire that I can't back up I just like adding topics.

Actually.  I think the south Korean government is full of cowards and
communist sympathizers.  They are still trying to resurrect the failed
"sunshine policy" meanwhile millions of their family members in the
north are starving and being brutalized by the north Korean government.

Excuses excuses.  Aside from Israel exactly who near Iran has nukes and
hates
Iran?  Come on, be specific ok?  But then let's not forget Iran's claim
that
"it's only
for power."  At least if they were honest about the program and said
what
makes
them want nukes and what they plan to achieve by having them, etc.  I
mean,
Iran
doesn't have much in the way of natural resources so I can totally
understand why
they'd go for nuclear power....

You think so?  When is the last time we "whacked" Iran?  And yes,
carrying a
big
stick is a good idea.  Using it, when needed, is also a good idea.  The
S.
Koreans, i'm
sure, would agree with me on this point.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 2nd

10PM to 6AM

MOKSHA TRIBE
presents

**JAGAN**
(the third eye)

9e2581.jpg

Hiei is a fire apparition whose true origins are unknown. He is a master 
swordsman, and his strength and speed are incredible. However, these are 
hardly his most fearsome abilities. Typically kept concealed behind a 
bandanna on his forehead is the "Jagan," a mysterious third eye that 
possesses magical properties.

Moksha Tribe celebrates Japanese anime, culture and JAGAN -- the Chakra of 
psychic perception that can overcome the demons of oppression.  You are 
invited to dress as your favorite anime character or in traditional 
Japanese attire.  Three full rooms of rockin' house, breaks, tech-trance, 
drum 'n' bass, psytrance, ambient and experimental beats at a convenient 
underground Bay Area location.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [Politics-NRR]Time to stir the pot from the bottom this time

Back when the whole war on terror thing started I posted about domestic
terror and most people immediately turned it back to outside threats...
*shrug*  Like they mean more than inside threats.  Terror is terror.
Someone walking down the street in the middle of the night shouldn't be
scared.  I've always been more scared of internal threats than external
since all my life growing up I've been pushed around by thugs in
Sacramento and Salt Lake (mostly the violent straight edgers that
travelled in groups of 20 or more).  Thrown through display racks in
stores, some dude even went donkey kong and was hucking huge garbage
cans at me in a park.  I did cross country all while growing up so I
could get away.   =20

Here's the current on Oaktown.
http://www.redding.com/news/state/past/20021117state030.shtml

Yet we keep making cuts on education.  We keep trampling the ability for
people to get good education and be productive.  And I'm not saying
everyone has to be a corporate slave.  No one seems to be learning the
age old value of earning your money now and wants a quick return over a
long investment.

affiliated with outside influences.=20

I just wanna know when the war on terror is going to turn inward.
Stopping our current terrorist organizations like street gangs,
anti-government milita groups that do incite violence (militia groups
are a constitutional right), violent aryan groups (free speech until
they turn violent), violent christian groups that blow up abortion
clinics, and violent envionmental groups.  It's only a matter of time
before someone with a lot of intelligence in one of these groups is able
to put together a nuke as well.  It can be done without a lot of
equipment, minus the uranium.  We have plenty of terrorists inside our
borders that need to be delt with on the same level we deal with groups
like Hamas and Al-Qaeda.  I see no difference with some guy walking into
a caf=E9 in israel and blowing himself up and a carfull of thugs in
Oakland shooting up a neighborhood and taking down innocents in
crossfire.  Here's some old material but a survey of 45 cities, reported
that there were around 1500 street gangs with as many as 120,000 members
between them.  That=92s a pretty damn big army of terrorists spread =
across
45 cities.

I'm a member of the armed forces already and no I don't want to
reinstitute the draft.  It waters down the professional soldiers we have
with unworthy talent. =20

I've spent most of my adult life in countries where they "hate" us.  You
can always find someone in those countries that like you (korea,
germany). =20

We aren't bogged down in iraq.  I hope you aren't saying that you listen
to the liberal media shouting QUAGMIRE!  Because it isn't like that at
all.  America is rebuilding that country and doing so faster than is
being reported by the idiots at CNN and the BBC.

The war on terror is going to be pennies on the dollar compared to
ignoring the problem like Clinton did.  I will not vote for anyone that
wants to be soft on terror.  Ever.  I wish I could take by my votes for
Clinton because he cause the problems that we are seeing today.  Because
of his inaction, we are seeing nuclear proliferation problems and a
growing terrorist threat.  The only way to stop these issues is to carry
a big stick and not be afraid to whack people with it. =20

Don't you think that maybe, just maybe, we should clean up the mess in
Iraq first?  Scarlet, I suppose you fully support re-instating the Draft
to provide the troops to invide Iran and North Korea... because you are
certinaly beyond the draftable age, right?  Becuase our all-volenteer=20
army to be difficult to recruit for the purpose of America's
Impire-building. Who wants to spend 1 year deployments in countries
where they hate you?

You know, they are cutting the number of Air Marshals becuase of budget
problems.  At the same time they are warning about new Hijacking
threats.

Don't you think America would be safer if we spent the 100 billion on
the Iraq war on homeland security?

Don't you think the real War on Terror would be more effective if we
were not bogged down in Iraq?

Um, the neo-conservative Americans?

-They talk endlessly about how "Iran is next"
-They are developing new, smaller, tactical nuclear weapons.
-They are building numerous military basses in Iraq.

Yes....education, health, infrastructure -- all going to hell.  I heard a 
horrific estimate of true unemployment figures yesterday, and one segment 
of the data indicated that nearly sixty percent of inner city blacks were 
unemployed.  Couple this with the fact that many of these people end up in 
prison and become, in effect, unemployable long term and you create 
problems, including crime and violence, that will continue well into the 
future.

Love,

Apollo

So with all of that in mind lets go destabilize another country and then
funnel money into the rebuilding of that country so the area around them
will be safe. I am not safe walking down my street but it is nice to
know in other countries people can now walk down the street easier

Subject: [sfraves] BSP-related: clarification, $9 Rendezvous tickets

Hi, the Istyly crew asked me to clarify the price for Rendezvous tickets. Apparently some people have gone to buy tickets and found that they would be $10 instead of $9. That's because the store selling the tickets added a $1 service charge, which is typical. Often, stores will charge $2 if it's a more expensive party. 

I used to own a store that sold party tickets. The service charge is the only money that stores make from ticket sales, but that's ok because people might buy records and other things while they're at your store to buy tickets. 

If you're far from a store and buy your tickets online, that's likely to cost a few dollars or more, but compared to driving 100 miles just to buy a ticket, that's not too bad. 

Note: if you're going to a massive, and there are tickets at Ticketmaster (and therefore Tower Records, etc) you're still better off getting your tickets at a store like Skills, F8, Solid Grooves, etc. I think I paid at least $8 in service charges when I bought a ticket for a massive at Ticketmaster, using a credit card. (But also keep in mind when you're buying tickets at a store like Skills: it's likely to be cash only. That's why it's so great they have an ATM right in the store!)

Tickets at the door will be $15.

And now, again, the info about Rendezvous:

That report, Apollo, is meaningless without knowing the data pool and
context,
as you're no doubt aware.  I'm sure it is high, but 60%?  Wanna buy a

So with all of that in mind lets go destabilize another country and then
funnel money into the rebuilding of that country so the area around them
will be safe. I am not safe walking down my street but it is nice to
know in other countries people can now walk down the street easier
thanks to our government ;)

Yes....education, health, infrastructure -- all going to hell.  I heard
a
horrific estimate of true unemployment figures yesterday, and one
segment
of the data indicated that nearly sixty percent of inner city blacks
were
unemployed.  Couple this with the fact that many of these people end up
in
prison and become, in effect, unemployable long term and you create
problems, including crime and violence, that will continue well into the

future.

Love,

Apollo

I understand this -- one of those programs I was listening to whilst 
multitasking.  Apparently some researchers were looking at more realistic 
unemployment rates than those reported and did some sampling in cities like 
Oakland, Chicago and other major metro areas.  I must say, however, that 
I've seen this stat in other places.  Me...I already have the GGB:)

occasionally, i will give something some thought and be sort of sensitive. sometimes, i don't have to think about it at all. i can always empathize, but also, in most cases, i won't be doing anything to make anything anything more or less than it is. hopefully, no one has been crying or sobbing or anything like that. it is okay to totally sob, but please, don't sob over me, because you never know if i will be sensitive or not, and usually, i am not by choice. most people aren't either. sometimes, i am just too busy trying to get my food despite much opposition. it is not always blatant insensitivity. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [Politics-NRR]Time to stir the pot from the   bottom this time

I'm sorry but a statistic like that, from multiple "credible" sources is
statistically
impossible; pun intended lol.  The unemployment rate for blacks in the
inner-city
is higher, certainly more than 10% but likely less than 20% with an unlikely
possibility
of 25% or so, and that would be a stretch.   Did you see the report (true
i'm sure heh)
recently that blamed telephone poles in the inner city for a lack of
self-esteem?  Just
saying that it's hard to believe far out stats and research ;)

Is Apollo right? Micromu? Anyone?

Here's an interesting article from the Beeb about the application of 
statistics...

	http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1091350

I'd estimate it's about 87% correct. Enjoy.

Where are your sources?  One thing I've discovered about data -- everyone 
has a different story.  Current unemployment stats, I think we all agree, 
don't accurately reflect those who have given up looking for work and those 
who never have been employed, especially teens and young adults.

But I have work to do....

Love,

Apollo

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we 
recognize our shared humanity."

Help help I'm being repressed.  Come witness the violence inherent in
the system.

Why is it that liberals (I'm making that assumption based on your ad hom
Coulter comment) are so quick to try to stifle free speech?  Hmmm?
Can't handle open and honest debate?  You think ad hom attacks will win
people over?

I usually expect people on SFR to have some original ideas or thoughts, 
whether they represent the left, right, or the middle. (Or hail from 
muthafuggin Mars.)

So Coulter Clone, until you've got something new to contribute to the

why is it that, while you don't hesitate to employ, not only an 
arsenal of ad homminem attacks, but countless red herrings and 
slippery slope arguments yourself, as soon as someone gets 
frustrated with you debate tactics are suddenly something you care 
about?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [Politics-NRR] Last & only thing I have to say on the topic this time.

like i save all of your emails in a database or something..

seriously, though, you have this tendency to cast people off 
as "oh, you liberals" and i keep hearing "you liberals think..." 
from you.  ad homminem is not necessarily a personal attack the 
same way that, say, blatantly calling someone a bastard is.  what 
i see is that you say things like "liberals are dumb" or "liberals 
are wankers" and then you clearly imply or state that the other 
person is a liberal.  that's an only very thinly veiled ad hom 
attack.

Don't forget "You don't have a clue"


"> You don't have a clue as to what is really going on in iran."

Like Scarlet is some sort of freakin' expert.  Has he visited there
recently?  Is he writing a report on Iranian policy?

My guess he is an expert based on watching countless Fox News reports...

"Oh America, please come and smash our infrastructure and civil society just
like you did in Iraq."

Him to, but I dont think it'd solve all the problems. I think allowing us 
to severely punish those who hold a public office such as president would 
be more productive.

Recall? Impeachment? Calls for resignation? Screw that. What we've 
sorely needed for a long time is a revolution.

"god forbid we should ever be 20  years without such a rebellion. the 
people cannot be all, & always, well informed. the past which is wrong 
will be discontented  in proportion to the importance of the facts they 
misconceive; if they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a 
lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. we have had 
13. states independant 11. years. there has been one rebellion. that 
comes to one rebellion in a century & a half for each state. what 
country before ever existed a century & half without a rebellion? & 
what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned 
from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? 
let them take arms. the remedy  is to set them right as to facts, 
pardon & pacify them. what signify a few lives lost in a century or 
two? the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the 
blood of patriots  & tyrants. it is it's natural manure."

America gives the opportunity for bloodless revolution every 4 years.

There is only one way we will get Bush out of office, and that is to vote
him out in November 2004.  Do your part.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question

I agree wholeheartedly, but the thing is, there's no
recall, and for that matter, no referendum power on
the federal level. Furthermore, there is no direct
political redress of the federal government at all!
Even the vote is mediated by the electoral college!
Ugh... I should have paid less attention in
government...it would have kept me happier and
ignorant longer. :b

The only immediate thing to do is impeach, and
remembering Clinton, we all know how that went down.
Furthermore, with a Republican Congress, there is no
way Senate will impeach let alone the House convict
Shrub. Sux. So the best thing is start working for
your favorite candidates in the local and state
elections for the next round.  

What's worse, is the argument that the republicans are
concerned about the budget, bull****. If they were
they would not be risking the 30 million it's costing
our counties to hold this unecessary election. And
what's more, when Davis wins (not if ya'll), the State
will owe him for his fees(i.e. the cost of running
against the election. You all know that Shrub is the
only president to simulatneously have all of the
states go insolvent? Perhaps another 40 mil will help
the budget eh? Put that in your pipe and smoke it. 

This is all about Tom Delay's and Daryl Issa's move to
carry out Shrub's plan to punish the states that
didn't go his way. 

Sorry about the diatribe...but I think I needed the
Catharsis

Please, enough :)   You think liberals don't do the same thing ad naseum?
If liberals are getting put
into said pigeon holes then liberals only have themselves to blame.  If you
don't know what i'm talking
about you haven't been paying attention the last few years.

I don't.  A recall isn't the same as impeachment and the criteria for each
are not
the same.  Does Bush have a 22% approval rating?  No.  'Nuff said.

I think you're about dead on with the 87%.  That site is something everyone
should check out
as it clearly shows why statistics as raw numbers or percentages are just
not to be trusted; usually.
This one comedy show still stays with me as a prime example of statistics
and their ability to be
warped worse than a wormhole....guy is reading a pack of chips that say "Now
with less fat!" and
he thinks to himself, "Less fat than what?  A tub of lard?"

"47.3% of all statistics are made up on the spot.

I trust Steven Wright =)  He's right about that.

Yeah, we see that goes over really well. Let's see.

2000: Election results handed to Supreme Court. "Winning" party claims 
"hey - those are the results. We won. Live with it."

2003: Election results handed down to referendum a year and a half 
later, after same party as before claims, "Sure, those were the 
results. We won't live with it."

The entire system is flawed. And it's not just one party that needs to 
be rooted out. Remember who's behind the RAVE act, is pro-DRM, and 
initiated the FCC's love-in for megacorporations in 1996. You're not 
just being bent over and fucked by one party. No way. You're building a 
bridge, forcibly sucking off the other. You're in your own societal 
porno. You're in the starring role. Joe Q Public in "Three Way Action 
'03." Is the reference crude and disgusting? Only as much as what's 
actually going on.

As for bloodless? No problem. I don't think any blood will be shed when 
these whores are shoved fistfuls of their own dirty money to choke on 
and expire in a stifling, torturous manner. Asphyxiation (figurative or 
literal) isn't all that bloody...

Ok, when non-liberals say "those damn liberals" this is exactly what is
being
talked about.

"This is all about Tom Delay's and Daryl Issa's move to
carry out Shrub's plan to punish the states that didn't go his way."

Seriously, what state do you live in?  I have two hard-core liberal friends
who *ran* a recall Davis booth.  Bankrolled by a Republican isn't the issue.
Of course it'll be bankrolled by them, duh.  The issue is a 22% approval
rating,
lies about the size of the deficit, mismanagement, lack of cutting spending,
the
list goes on and on.  Wanna talk about "those damn liberals" let's talk
about
something more incideous than a Rep. bankrolling the recall effort that had
bi-partisan support from the people.  Let's talk about the Dem. funded group
"taxpayer's against the recall"  Hell i'm a taxpayer and i'm for the recall,
how *dare*
the Dem. party fund this and lob me into it by association as a tax payer.
Let's
talk about the DNC not offering any other candidate to run and stating
publicly
in a nutshell, "the voters of CA, if the recall succeeds, must now be
informed they
will have no other option but to vote for a conservative."  Hey, thanks for
that
DNC, way to throw a temper-tantrum, way to care about choice, your party
members,
and the people of this state.  Rock on DNC.

What's the state of the economy?  The Liberals needed a bad economy and
the media liberals will attempt to sell "bad economy" to the American
public till unemployment is below 4per cent, the Dow is at 12,000,
profits are at record highs, and Donald Trump enters the ministry. The
data is the main reason the Democratic crazies are campaigning against
"the sixteen words"; they have absolutely nothing else to talk about.
Don't listen or read the "news" to make investment decisions. Corporate
profits for Q1 were REVISED UP by $20.1 billion; profits mean dividends.
That revision has also dispelled the rumor that we were in a recession.
We weren't.

If you've been watching the bond market, you'd know that the rise in the
bond market is a signal that the need for private money is higher now
and has signaled a return to corporations need for money to finance
projects.  

As for global relations, being the leader of the world isn't a fucking
popularity contest.  Sometimes being in charge means you have to piss
people off.  And make no mistake, America is in charge.  We will be
damned if we do, and damned if we don't.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [Politics-NRR] Last & only thing I have to say on the topic this time.

I don't have cable and I don't watch tv.  Its poison for your brain.

There wasn't much infrastructure to smash in iraq unless you count all
the wonderful palaces that saddam built for himself under the UN oil for
palaces program.  He certainly wasn't feeding his people with that
money.  

You are indeed clueless.

Don't forget "You don't have a clue"


"> You don't have a clue as to what is really going on in iran."

Like Scarlet is some sort of freakin' expert.  Has he visited there
recently?  Is he writing a report on Iranian policy?

My guess he is an expert based on watching countless Fox News reports...

"Oh America, please come and smash our infrastructure and civil society
just
like you did in Iraq."

Yeah, we see that goes over really well. Let's see.

2000: Election results handed to Supreme Court. "Winning" party claims 
"hey - those are the results. We won. Live with it."

2003: Election results handed down to referendum a year and a half

The entire system is flawed. And it's not just one party that needs to

More statistics.. for those of you too lazy to do your own research
about what the media whores are spewing about our economy.  

http://www.econopundit.com/2003_07_01_econopundit_archive.html#105958266
017030566

More than 3.8 million people now draw unemployment benefits, the highest
in 20 years. The number looking for jobs has passed 9 million for the
first time in 10 years. The unemployment rate has climbed to a nine-year
high of 6.4 percent. The economy has lost over 300,000 jobs this year,
and unemployment claims are still up around 425,000 a week.

Okay, now unglaze your eyes for a second and you'll notice something.
First he says bla bla, the highest in 20 years. Then he says bleah,
blea, highest in 10 years. Then it's yadda, yadda, climbed to a nine
year high. And finally yackda, yacdka this year and this week.

Why doesn't he keep the time under consideration constant? The answer
is, it might weaken his argument!

Here are plots of new and continued claims for unemployment insurance
since 1967. I've made no adjustments for the growth in the population
and labor force, so you can plainly see what we're going thru is a very
mild jobs recession. By standards of the early 1990's (when 6% was about
as low as we thought we could go) we are not far from full employment.

I think you're about dead on with the 87%.  That site is something
everyone
should check out
as it clearly shows why statistics as raw numbers or percentages are
just
not to be trusted; usually.
This one comedy show still stays with me as a prime example of
statistics
and their ability to be
warped worse than a wormhole....guy is reading a pack of chips that say
"Now
with less fat!" and
he thinks to himself, "Less fat than what?  A tub of lard?"

I trust Steven Wright =)  He's right about that.

Let me add to this...

If you've never been to an FnF related event for a campout, well you're
missing out. REALLY missing out. If you want to be surrounded by the
chillest, zero-drama people you've ever seen then this is your gig. If you
want crazy production, badass sound, lights and such like you don't see at
most parties - this is the event. I'm blown away seeing a post for this on
SFR. Take advantage of it. You won't regret it.

That said I'll be there. =)

--part1_a6.3afbcc3b.2c59d559_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Let me get something staight...

     When I say there is a "Square Root" problem/equation in America, and 
that there are two sides we must chose from, I'm not trying to neatly put 
everyone into little groups that they don't fit in, nor am I trying to use labels 
that we should all wear on our left or right breast pocket... 
     What I am saying, is that there is one epitime-type problem in America 
that people seem to never, ever, ever talk about: Should we, the U.S., have 
Nuclear weapons? I'm sure I know the reason why people don't talk about this 
issue... because we think the answer is obvious. Too obvious of an aswer to even 
ask the question, I mean what a STUPID question, people would look at you in 
disgust. "Of course the U.S. should have nuclear weapons! Fucking dumbass!"   
"If we didn't, all the Hitler type people would blow us the fuck up and take 
over the world." 
     And there you have it, you've been silenced, you never mention it 
again... but then you start to think what about John Lennon? How would he have 
answered that question? What about Bob Marley? What did Einstien mean when he said 
"You cannot similtaneously prevent and prepare for war." Was Einstien just 
being brash? Did he not think it all the way through? I mean if we don't use his 
thereoys in politics then why use his thereos in math? Maybe he's a madman. On 
that note lets just stop listening to the Beatles and the Wailers too. :p
     I know what you're all thinking now "It's not that simple, you can't 
just chose to have Nuclear weapons or not" "It's a touchy decision, that none of 
us are ready to make yet" and in the meantime I dunno when we last checked but 
I'm pretty sure we DO have NUCLEAR WEAPONS as of NOW. So to avoid the subject 
is the same thing as agreeing it's ok   to have them. Because we do have 
them. In fact we have the MOST of them of any other nation. And since by in large 
Nuclear Weapons are the most hated, wretched items in the world.... and we 
have the MOST of them... then wouldn't it be logical for us to be the most hated 
nation as well? We metaphorically hover these apocolipse capable bombs over 
our enimies heads practically stating "Well we could kill you if we wanted to 
but we're not going to because we're nice... so be goddamned thankful and don't 
start any shit, got it?"
     So anyway, when I say there are two sides to this issue it's because 
there ARE two sides and there can ONLY be two sides. You can either OWN nuclear 
weapons or you can NOT own them. You can't be inbetween. 
     I do empathize with those who say we need them for self defesnse... 
knowing that they believe other nuclear powers to be "madmen" who would kill us 
all if not for our current militant supiourity over them. ... but this thereoy 
somehow always reminds of the Rage Against the Machine song/quote "Fear is your 
only God"
     But I want to make it clear that, contrary to popular belief the 
"hippie" types who protest and call for peace are NOT wimps but are rather very much 
more couragous because:
 #1 they are swimming against the tide, (not out of spite, mind you, but out 
of personal, moral integrity)   
 #2 they entrust in other countries to have compassion equally as much as our 
own, (instead of attaching themselves to what's familiar and safe). 
 #3 Because they know that there is a chance they could be wrong and naive, 
and if that turns out to be the case, we could all die in our lack of 
self-defence militia, while being attacked and killed, in our efforts to serve the 
envirornment and the community... (just like soldiers die serving the military). 
     I don't think it's any different and therefor you can't use courage as 
the insult, nor can you use inteligence or integrity. When it boils down to 
it... it's a battle of faith. You can either die FIGHTING with a pretty good 
chance of wining and surviving (since you are very fortunate to be on the stronger 
side)
... or you can die Believing, in other people and in other nations than ours. 
Knowing that if your faith is wrong or naive you may catch a one way nuclear 
ticket to the cosmos. (at least then you have your honor, and you know you 
were a part of what could have been... something of the Utopia) And then again 
perhaps this way really works afterall? Who knows...

Feh... we need more than just a revolution.  We need complete annihilation..

We need a Deep Impact or Armageddon style comet to hit certian parts of this
country.  The way I see it, it needs to break into three pieces: one for each
washington, and one for texas.  That'd eliminate the worst sorts from the
country, and solve many of its problems in one fell swoop.

Failing that, perhaps the British could burn down DC again?  Only this time,
hopefully they'll lock all the republicans *IN* the buildings when they raze
them.  Then we could just give texas back to Mexico.  'Not sure what to do
about the other washington, though, in the absence of a comet.


cya,
john

That's a good question.  There could be a case made that the US doesn't
need them because we are the single most powerful military on the
planet.  But that can change and china is doing their damnedest to catch
us. =20

1.  we must keep our nukes until everyone that has them agrees to
destroy all of theirs at the same time.  You may not know this but china
has a "nuke first" strategy to deal our military a crushing blow in case
they go to war with us.  China is very opposed to our missile defense
system for this reason.

2.  the UN has to get a set of nuts and enforce their existing
agreements with all the signatories on the nuclear proliferation
agreements that all the countries signed and the India/Pakistan violated
with no actions and that iran and north korea are currently violating. =20


But I want to make it clear that, contrary to popular belief the=20
"hippie" types who protest and call for peace are NOT wimps but are
rather very much more couragous because:
 #1 they are swimming against the tide, (not out of spite, mind you, but
out=20
of personal, moral integrity

what moral integrity lead protestors to protest the ouster of a man that
would have his sons throw live people into wood chipper machines?  You
think it is moral to oppose war when the end result is to allow human
rights violations on a scale beyond the most heinous acts?  The end
result of the na=EFve protests would have been more death and =
humiliation
for the Iraqi people.  I would not claim to have any sort of grasp of
what morality is if you actually protested against the liberation of
iraq.=20

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [Politics-NRR]Time to stir the pot from the bottom this time

Btw... I've had a little time to digest why this email makes me sick and
I'd like to share it with you all.

http://www.viewfromiran.blogspot.com/2003_07_01_viewfromiran_archive.htm
l#105950623389319043

the above link is a blog that is written by a man and a woman currently
living in iran.  They detail their life and experience quite well.
There are hundreds if not thousand of these blogs if you go and look for
them.  The mad mullahs of iran are trying desperately to shut them down
because they are informing the world about what is happening in iran.

What pains me about this email is my little friend has demonstrated to
me that he is a moral coward, someone that believes in noble ideals but
would never sacrifice for them.  Screw all the people that are living in
iran, it is much better to let them suffer under the mad mullahs (and
suffer they do) than to take action.  No one knows how many people might
die in a real uprising with guns and bullets but if the end result was
that the mullahs were captured and dealt with and democracy returned to
iran then the pain would be worth it.  Using judas' logic, the US would
still be a british colony.  

I am tied by family to the country of south korea.  My wife and daughter
currently live in seoul.  The little bastard to the north has promised
to turn seoul into a sea of fire and if he does you can bet I'll be on
the next plane there to kill him with my bare hands (and anyone that
gets in the way).  You have no idea how much I fret over what is going
on in korea now but you can believe that if something happens I'll
support our government in its' actions.  I personally think there will
be a war there within a year and I am hoping that it doesn't happen
while my family is there.  But if it does, I'll join the fight, not the
protest. 

If the end result is the freedom of other families to have what I have,
it is worth it.

fuck you, i have family from Iran and family *in* Iran.  yes there 
are people revolting and there are even people who are dear to me 
who had to flee the country in the 1980s, but NOT ONE of them 
wants the US to bomb the shit out of their country.

     I think you missed the point compleately. The reason we shouldn't have
nuclear weapons isn't because we can defend ourselves without them. The
reason
we shouldn't have them is, since we're supposedly a peace making nation, and
we're asking other nations to disarm, we should then make an honorable
example
by disarming first. If then China or any other nation uses our own kindness
against us, and proceeds to "kick us while we're down" so to speak, then
president Bush's axis of evil thereoy will be truely proven, there truely
will be a
great evil preying on our true inocence, and we'll have to die hedious
deaths
because of our naiveness. And when we're all dead you can all blame naive
people like me throughout the afterlife...
     BUT if you have any damn faith in mankind at all, one would like to
believe that even a nation like China has this little thing called "honor".
Can
you imagine, if the U.S. disarmed nuclear power as a peace gesture, as an
example for North Korea and the rest of the world to follow, can you imagine
then
China turning around and saying "They've disarmed nuclear power! lets bomb
them
mhuahahahhaha!!" No because China, like all other countries has honor. The
reason China has strategies against us is because they don't trust us. We
don't
give them any reason to trust us. We ask other nations like Iraq and North
Korea to dis-arm while we hold on to our own nuclear weapons, we ignore
inspection
requests from the UN and we call that fair. We expect and assume trust from
all other nations because we just assume all of our intentions are just and
fair. But we only play by our own rules, compleately ignoring the UN.
     If you ask me I think it's a goddamn miricle that there even is a UN.
It's a miricle that it even exists and It's just about the only entity that
can
make peace in the world and do it fair, without causeing spite and
humiliation
on the losing side. To disrespect it or ignore it in any way is just not
forgivable. I think the U.S. truely does have good intentions but we just
expect
other countries to trust us and if they don't, too bad. This is no way to
run a
country. Yes it can be done, yes we have the power to do it if we want to,
no
we're not technically doing anyting downright "evil". We do have good
intentions, but it's just retarded to expect other nations to trust us, just
because
we say so.

I was going to type out a long rebuttal to this but I don=92t think it =
is
worth it.  Anyone that thinks the UN has any credibility after all the
stark and utter failures that they have lined up the past decade is
beyond debate.  (Genocide in Rwanda, genocide in Kosovo/bosnia, genocide
in Africa, genocide in north korea, complete failure to enforce their
own treaties).  The UN is a joke.  Hell, Libya heads the human rights
commission.  Libya for Christ sakes!  It=92s time we pulled out and =
formed
a new group.
=20
Second, China has honor?  Christ man.  What kind of honor does a country
that promises hong kong 50 years of democracy under a =931 china, 2
systems=94 rule and then tries to take democracy away this year?  Is =
that
honor?  Ever talk to a mainland Chinese person?  They love America.
They love how we honor our contracts we make in the business world.
When we sign on the bottom line, we honor our agreement AND if we =
don=92t
we have the rule of law to allow for action to be taken.  There is no
system like that in china.  My brother-in-law is a Chinese business man
and he hates dealing with Chinese companies because they steal from him
too much. =20

disarmed nuclear power! lets bomb them mhuahahahhaha!!" No because
China, like all other countries has honor. The reason China has
strategies against us is because they don't trust us. We don't give them
any reason to trust us. We ask other nations like Iraq and North Korea
to dis-arm while we hold on to our own nuclear weapons, we ignore
inspection requests from the UN and we call that fair. We expect and
assume trust from all other nations because we just assume all of our
intentions are just and fair. But we only play by our own rules,
compleately ignoring the UN.=20
     If you ask me I think it's a goddamn miricle that there even is a
UN. It's a miricle that it even exists and It's just about the only
entity that can make peace in the world and do it fair, without causeing
spite and humiliation on the losing side. To disrespect it or ignore it
in any way is just not forgivable. I think the U.S. truely does have
good intentions but we just expect other countries to trust us and if
they don't, too bad. This is no way to run a country. Yes it can be
done, yes we have the power to do it if we want to, no we're not
technically doing anyting downright "evil". We do have good intentions,
but it's just retarded to expect other nations to trust us, just because
we say so.=20

1.  we must keep our nukes until everyone that has them agrees to
destroy all of theirs at the same time.  You may not know this but china
has a "nuke first" strategy to deal our military a crushing blow in case
they go to war with us.  China is very opposed to our missile defense
system for this reason.

Subject: [sfraves] DJ Website survey

Hi everyone,

I am conducting a survey as part of my research in my
senior project class (DAI 505). I am designing a
website for a local DJ as my senior project. The
survey is targeted at fans of electonica/dance/and DJ
culture.  It's quick and simple. If you could respond
to the survey or pass this link along to others, I
would greatly appreciate it. If you have any questions
or comments, let me know.

Here's the link to the survey: 
http://www.createsurvey.com/cgi-bin/pollfrm?s=9949&magic=H46LsnJaIRuYLvb

If you're a DJ, I have a specialized survey for DJs:
http://www.createsurvey.com/cgi-bin/pollfrm?s=9952&magic=lJWxJU0ZkpB4KXE

Thanks for your time and have a good day.

Best Place to See an Electronic Duo Score 'My Dinner with Andre' 
----------------------------------------------------------------
As far as SoMa spaces go, the DNA Lounge has definitely stepped to the
plate in the post-1015-relevance era. Resident DJs Shane and Amber have
been putting on :CODE there every other Thursday since the club's
impressive renovation two years ago, spinning a consistently good mix of
acid techno, ghetto breaks, glitch, and drum 'n' bass as well as
showcasing live acts when they can. :CODE's a good party, and the night
we saw experimental duo Idiom Creak perform was no exception. What was
exceptional was watching kids get down to their bizarro breaks while the
two scored epochal indie film My Dinner with Andre on the fly. Kids who
didn't exist when the film came out in '82 were shakin' it beneath the
projected image of Wallace Shawn waxing philosophical as Idiom Creak
trickled dialogue into the mix along with their spastic beats. DNA
Lounge, 375 11th St., S.F. (415) 626-1409, www.dnalounge.com/0xC0DE/.

Hey folks,
We're a little late due to transportation difficulties (the time machine
broke) but we're here now.  Koroma is on the decks tearin' it up, and
Aqui_no is waiting in the wings to jump on board at around 10:45.  It
all ends at noon, so don't slack on it!

As per the usual, lots of ticket giveaways too!!  DO be sure to tune
in!!!  90.1 FM, or online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question

Are you kidding me? Obviously we know where your loyalties lie. You are
comparing a greedy son a bitch governor who spent your money and mine and
put us in danger of junk bond status to a president who whole-heartedly is
doing the best job he can (which is an opinionated statement) ?

Hello, class...anyone tell me what state *used* to have the 5th largest
economy? You see the other states in the same shape we are? You think bush
is responsible for the economy? 8 years of trickle down politics, open
borders, failed social programs, focusing on bj's instead of work, and
overall bleeding heart liberalism got us in this spot folks; Bush didn't
create this, he inherited it.

Only a dem can spend money that fast: aka, see Red Davis' spending spree in
the first 7 months of re-election. I feel nauseous from your lack of
backbone.

Don't feel, think.

Bush inhereted a 200 billion dollar surplus, and now it is a 450 defeciet.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Question

What about another governor who not too long ago almost (if not did, I
can't quite remember) run California and at the minimum Orange county
into bankrupcy.  He wasn't a democrat, so how is politicians screwing up
with money a repub/demo thing.  Politicans are pretty much bad with
money period.  Of course they love to spend spend spend.  Most of them
are not poor farmers who really know the value of a penny, especially
when its not their own.  I'm pretty appalled at my tax dollars going to
have federal lawyers define marriage as man and woman.  We'd have to
stop at humanity because we can't communicate with animals and know if
an animal says I do so there really is no retort as to where will it end
with that.  Who the hell said a government needs to decide something
like that.  From a non religious standpoint this has no implication into
anything.  Without religion why would we balk at two men or two women
getting married.  I guess on that accord I'd have to say polygamy should
be legal again although personally I don't agree with it, but unless
there's incest going on which is biologically harmful polygamy really
has no place being governed at all either.

http://www.vdare.com/francis/ca_budget.htm

Damn parties and partisan politics.  Fix the issues not perpetuate an
internal non(violent) war.  Mostly non-violent.  I think I remember
reading about a fist fight that broke out on the floor of the house or
senate recently but that I am unsure of and can't find anything to back
it up at the moment although I believe I saw it off a link on fark this
week.

Deficits go hand in hand with recessions.  This recession was rooted and
underwey before Bush took office.
The surplus was due to run out regardless of a dem or rep in office.

As to Mr. Davis....let's recall in wonder his assessment of the CA deficit
during the last election, shall we?

Days before the election:  "It's around 5 billion"
Days after being re-elected:  "Actually it's closer to 35 billion"

I'm sorry, that is not a rounding error, that's a lie to get in office.
Davis is ruining this state in more ways
than just the deficit, and whether he was a R or D or I i'd want him gone.

No, Deficits go hand in hand with increasing spending and cutting taxes.

Mr. right-wing Scarlet just said we are out of the recession, and its
all a media fantasy.

So why still the Deficit, Hmmmmm?

Its young professionals like myself who are going to be paying for Bush's
failed economic policy for the rest of our lives.

Maybe you haven't heard about the fact that during recessions the tax base
drops, I know
this is a tough concept to fathom, but think about it.  A wonderfull
democrat (unlike Davis)
once did what Bush is doing, and that is spend spend spend and lower taxes.
Care to guess
who?  Bush is making the right moves.

"I'll have you know I was online registering my disgust on the internet within minutes"
>comic book guy<
 
Remeber a while back when people were talking on here about racing cars and I made some sarcastic remark about how cars were some evil capitalist plot or something, and then a flame war started and I apologised...Well I take My apology back: CARS DO SUCK! If you want to drive em go ahead, but yesterday I had to drive and IT SUCKED! I LOVE BART! I LOVE MY BIKE! How can you people who drive stand it?!
So Here's what happened: I had this big commisiion right, and the art was done, but I needed blacklights, batteries and frames, all of which I ordered on line to be delivered by UPS, the Blacklights came while I was back East , so I had to go to to Sunnyvale and Pick them up, the Frames were backordered so I had to buy them retail, and the only place that had enough in stock was in Sunnyvale too! My husband, who does drive, works in Palo Alto, You would think this would be easy to coordinate, but I had to go to Sunnyvale and Palo Alto Twice because one frame was broken, and the UPS thing took me an Hour to find even though I used to live in Sunnyvale the UPS place is like in some alternate dimention or something, and there is this big body of water in the way between Fremont and Sunnyvale! Plus the guy at the frame place did not understand that 10 $6 frames does not add up to $85. his Exact words " I don't know, that's what the cash register says, if you want to add it up on the side
 while I ring these other people up go ahead." OK, I am not a math genius or anything but 10x6=60, tax is 8% so 60x8=480 just estimating you get $65, not $85. Even with cash register hypnosis, that is easy to figure out. I have had cash register hypnosis, it takes exactly 3 times as long to do basic math when you have it it, so it should have taken him about 30 seconds! IT TOOK AN HOUR AND A HALF! Anyway, by the time I got that straightened out, I had to pick up my husband in PA, and there are all these other people in other cars, that you cant go around because you are in a car, and these red lights you have to stop at, even when they turn green because all the cars are in the way, and these big orange cones you have to drive around, all of which is really easy on a bike but is a pain in a stupid car. So then I have to go over the big body of water to get home, but everybody else wants to go home at the same time, so there are all these cars in each others way! Then, after I frame
 all the work I have to deliver the art to San Francisco, but there are still cars all trying to go the same place at once! Even at 9:00 at night! Where are they going? And then I have to go across this big bridge, because that lake or whatever is in the way AGAIN! And they want $2 to get across it, so I have to go to this shady place in oakland to get cash. And I have to drive all over the place and the signs are all different sizes and hard to see, you can't just get back on the freeway where you got off, no, you have to drive to some other place. And then when you get on the bridge it is broken, and only one lane works! Then when you want to go back they close off all the places to get on with those little yellow cone thingies, I think they do this to keep all the people trapped in San Francisco so they can charge more for rent!  I gave up and took 280 to 101 to 84 to 880 home because 280 was the only freeway I could find that was open. Anyway, I got home and Kissed my BART pass
 (not literaly, eww) and Hugged my Bicycle. DRIVING SUCKS!

I beg to differ. Driving RULES!

Driving in the Bay Area does suck ass, though. The idiot, 
unaware-of-their-surroundings and ignorant-of-other-vehicles drivers 
around here rob all the joy out of what should be one of the simple, 
exhilarating pleasures in life.

I'd get a motorbike, but not with the clueless way people drive around 
here.

People think I'm crazy when I say I miss driving in LA. Fast, 
aggressive, but highly predictable.  You could put on a tribal house CD 
and it'd be the ideal soundtrack to your drive. Here, I want to listen 
to beergarten oom-pa-pa music with lots of lumbering tuba.  *sigh*

If we're really going to get started on the growing deficit, deciet and 
corrupt politics lets start with Nixon shall we, and take a good look at every Rep. 
thereafter. Clinton regardless of the occasional BJ (like you don't get 
yours) had the world on our side, economy up and the debt of our country on its way 
down. Back to the Cowboy...(downward spiral) started with the favor of his 
Gov. brother bumping him into office. As for Gov. Davis, I think its funny that 
some how the man was reelected. If you didn't like the way the state was being 
run that would've been your chance, vote for someone else, not campaign for a 
recall--campaign for the next election. I don't like the President, I voted 
against him and will certainly do it again. I may even do a little campaigning 
for the next Dem. in line myself. Good day all. Mel

Whatever.  The economy was in a tailspin when bush inherited it.  Please
look in to economic cycles if you wish to continue discussing this.
Cherry picking information to prove your point is childish.

Just a couple facts in response...

On Thu, 31 Jul 2003, Jack Triumph wrote:
-&e->Are you kidding me? Obviously we know where your loyalties lie. You are
-&e->comparing a greedy son a bitch governor who spent your money and mine and
-&e->put us in danger of junk bond status to a president who whole-heartedly is
-&e->doing the best job he can (which is an opinionated statement) ?

Honestly?  Both.

-&e->Hello, class...anyone tell me what state *used* to have the 5th largest
-&e->economy? You see the other states in the same shape we are? You think bush
-&e->is responsible for the economy? 8 years of trickle down politics, open
-&e->borders, failed social programs, focusing on bj's instead of work, and
-&e->overall bleeding heart liberalism got us in this spot folks; Bush didn't
-&e->create this, he inherited it.

"Trickle down" was a term coined by the Reagan cabinet to describe how
giving tax breaks and other fiscal advantage to the rich and corporations
made society benefit as a whole (detractors referred to this practice as
voodoo economics).  Time has proven that this is horribly incorrect by the
way... it does stimulate cash flow in certain sectors, but at the expense
of middle class solvency.  It creates more money in the banking system
available for lending at cheaper rates, but has middle and long term
effects of foreclosures and bankrupcies.  See Bush's recent tax package,
which offers low income families not a fucking thing, kicks a couple
hundred bucks to middle class and dual income families, and reduces taxes
for well off individuals and corporations substantially.

Many other states *are* in the same shape we are in.  Two things happened
to make California eat shit.  One, a temporary economic growth that seemed
like it would be a permanent fixture... and two, the expense of bailouts
that were a direct result of the deregulation of utilities.  The first was
the result of bipartisan economic shortsightedness, the second a strong
libertarian/republican push to privatize the energy market during Wilson's
term.  Make no mistake, rolling blackouts, a couple hundred bucks of your
money in extra bills, the enron debacle and the lobbying that allowed this
all all very linked.

Regarding open borders, NAFTA was bipartisan.  The China free trade
agreement had it's roots in Nixon's visits there in the 70s and 80s.
Most of the resistance to NAFTA stemmed from unions, usually a
democraticaly aligned concern.  The republicans were strongly behind
NAFTA, the version that passed was an edited version that Democrats were
convinced did enough to protect American jobs.

Your choice of words ("inherited") in the last sentence of this is
especially funny.  Some of the most questionable practices in federal
economics were established during the reagan/bush era, where defense
contracts went unchecked and often without adequate oversight... resulting
in the infamously expensive toilets seats and other overpriced materials
at taxpayer expense, as well as whole departments in the areas of
national security and intelligence that have almost zero accountabiity
and cost hundreds of millions.  Of course, for each of those there's a HUD
or similar democratic party darling, but I still thought it a funny word
choice.

-&e->Only a dem can spend money that fast: aka, see Red Davis' spending spree in
-&e->the first 7 months of re-election. I feel nauseous from your lack of
-&e->backbone.

This statement is a tad emotional don't you think?  Can we talk about the
world we live in without you threatening to barf or accusing those with
dissenting opinions of being invertebrates?

Looking at budgets, both major parties are horribly irresponsible with
money. At the national level, the budget shortfall winners are Reagan and
Bush Jr.  Greed, stupidity, and corruption are hardly something that
should be discussed along party lines... for each "blo job" or "bleeding
heart liberalism" I could spout a "watergate" or "iran contra" or
"senseless invasion of sovreign nation without internationally accepted
provocation" but the whole discussion sucks when it ends in inflammatory
slogans best left to inbred radio show hosts that cater to the quick to
judge and slow to understand.

I'd like to politely request that all the armchair politicians acknowledge
that this type of hardline crap would lock up the political process
altogether... politics is about compromise and finding middle ground (and
taking bribes and doing big lines of coke off hookers at the no-tell
hotel).  It's not too fun to see on a rave list, especially without an
"NRR" in the subject line.

If you're going to discuss politics, let's talk about what we could do
better without it descending into sandbox namecalling.  Suffice to say,
both parties have made major moves against many of the freedoms I was
raised to appreciate only a few decades ago.  Both parties are wickedly
self serving, and often work at 180 degrees to what they publically state
(for example, both major parties accuse the other of being "in bed" with
corporations at the expense of the people... when what we really need is
MAJOR lobbying, campaign and government employee compensation reform).

---You are wrong on a few points *just* on the above.  The utilities were
*not* deregulated, that's the problem.
They were half-way deregulated, and anyone with a brain and knowledge of
economics would tell you that you
either regulate, or don't.  Period.  This is how we got into the energy
mess.  Yet you go further and make a second
error and suggest it was Wilson's fault alone for deregulation; deregulation
never happened, hello.  The democratic
controlled assembly forced Wilson to compromise with them and as I said do a
half-way deregulation, that's what
screwed us.

Subject: [sfraves] seb fontaine at sno drift last night

Seb Fontaine played an amazing set last night at Sno Drift. Totally unlike
what I expected to hear him play. The vibe was, well, usual for Sno Drift. 
Nothing worth writing about. Fortunately, every once in a while they get a DJ
that really knows how to work it. Last night, IMHO, was such a night.

I expected trancier pop mainstreamy stuff with some good crowd-working
going on, inna UK style. But instead he played some pretty heady, groovy,
dubby tribal stuff that was still hard as nails. It was cool. You could
bug-out to it. It was less dark than, say, a Danny Tenaglia set, but kinda in
the same vein of being deeply embedded in a humid, sexy jungle of beats, with
occasional wafts of cool dub-fog to help  that last little bead of sweat on 
your forehead to not eruct all over the dancefloor.

Anybody got the proper term for the style he was playing last night? Was
it just "i'm going to play a bunch of underground shit for all the heads
in SF?"

Anybody got a DAT or some MP3s online of his set??


this is re:
|Please join us for a very special event with DJ SEB FONTAINE (Perfecto, 
|Thrive, Radio 1 / London, UK), one of the best DJs in the world, at Sno-Drift 
|tonight, July 30th. Seb Fontaine is touring in support of his new Perfecto CD 
|available now on Thrive Records and will perform an exclusive 3 hour set in 
|celebration of Mason from Thump Radio's birthday!

Dammit, I opted not to go to that out of fear that he'd be laying on 
the Cheez Whiz. Hmph!
Instead I went bar-hopping in the Mission and now I have a tummy ache 
to show for it.

Subject: [sfraves] video artist needed

Greetings all, I am looking for a video artist for an
upcoming party to do single-screen projections.  This
is a paying gig.  You don't need to supply the
projector or screen.  Any interested parties please
send me an email off-list with 1. a brief description
on your work, 2. a list of recent gigs/references if
any and 3. a quote for your services for the night. 
The length of the set is flexible, 6 hours at the
absolute most.  Demo reels or references to online
samples would be great and we can take it from there. 
I'm mostly interested in material with a dark, gritty,
abstract, techy feel but I'm open to anything.

thanks, Dave

Subject: Re: [sfraves] seb fontaine at sno drift last night

probably just continuing the vibe from his little surprise warm-up set @
Qoöl last night....got to share the decks with Mr. Fontaine...which was a
surprise, since I had no idea who the guest was last night.

Can I say I maybe persuaded him to play a little deeper, because my set and
Tyler Reed's sets were so damn dark and progressive....Probably not, but it
still makes me feel cool anyhow!

Just another death toll for the massives culture- nobody "profits" much

Still a sh*tty piece of (possible) legislation, though..  Will they

Dancers Break Record in 51-Hour Marathon 
46 minutes ago

By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer 
CLEVELAND - Kool & the Gang's "Celebration" played early in the morning at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, marking what 41 marathon dancers hope is a new record for the longest dance party.

It will be a few weeks before the Guinness Book of World Records confirms whether the record was broken, event spokesman Peter Collins said Thursday. 

"We wait for evidence to come in for it and if it fits — which I think it probably would — they'd be looking at getting the new record," Kate White, press officer for Guinness in London, said. 

"I'm relieved that it's over and exhilarated that we broke the record," said Dick Hurwitz, the oldest dancer to make it to the end. "I'm 58 years old and I'm not sore a bit." 

Hurwitz and others started dancing at 5:10 a.m. Tuesday and reached 51 hours — one hour past the 1999 record of 50 hours — at 8:10 a.m. Thursday. 

"It was rough this morning and people were hurting but everyone was determined," said Valerie Salstrom, co-owner of "Get Hep Swing," a swing dance instruction company based in Cleveland. 

Dancers were allowed to take 10-minute breaks every hour for food, trips to the bathroom and short naps. They also could stop moving between songs for up to 30 seconds, but otherwise had to at least be shifting their weight while on the dance floor. 

Guinness' current mark for longest dance party was set in November 1999 by 56 participants in an event sponsored by MTV India. 

Ben Rich, 26, got ready for the marathon with a little training. Rich, who lives in Washington, D.C., ran 4 miles one day and then stood for 12 straight hours — including during dinner at a Mediterranean restaurant. 

"The waitress was hysterical," Rich recalled with a laugh. 

The dancers originally had planned to dance for 81 hours, but they cleared the floor Thursday morning after 52 hours and three minutes, organizers said. The 81-hour goal was in recognition of the 81st anniversary of their sponsor, St. Joseph Aspirin's 81 milligram aspirin tablet. 

Salstrom and fellow instructor Marty Klempner helped recruit the dancers, who they know from their teaching trips around the United States and Canada. Unfortunately for Klempner, despite his training, painfully swollen knees forced him to bow out Tuesday night — the first casualty of the event. 

As the clock on the deejay platform hit 30 hours, the crowd cheered. 

"Seattle is in the house!" cried a bleary-eyed but grinning Jen Holland, known in the Seattle swing community as "Hep Jen." 

Most dancers brought several pairs of shoes to change when one pair got too sweaty or hot. Weary dancers soaked their feet, grabbed snacks and rested on air mattresses when they took their breaks. Some played card games from the dance floor, spreading the cards on the deejay's platform and breaking away every so often to twirl around. Others read books and ate while swaying. 

Salstrom said she and Klempner had to catch a plane to Los Angeles after the contest. 

"We're going to a swing workshop weekend," Salstrom said. "We start dancing tonight."

Dammit, I opted not to go to that out of fear that he'd be laying on 
the Cheez Whiz. Hmph!
Instead I went bar-hopping in the Mission and now I have a tummy ache 
to show for it.

i heard a rumor recently that the president wants to ban all gay marriages. i don't know if that is true or not, but it got me thinking about how it is still the way of the world to place value on marriages of convenience, as opposed to marriages based on love. also, i think that if this rumor 
is true that it has more of a basis in protecting economic interests as they currently are in the world, rather than protecting the moral standing of men and women. if all gay marriages were to just suddenly be validated, for example, then there would be a great cost to the military. army buddies 
would stop dating privately, and would openly marry and cost the government big bucks they aren't prepared to spill out, especially given the current world climate. everyone in the states would want 
to divorce their current spouses and go to be with the ones they truly love, and taxes would surely increase in the months ensuing. so think about it. you could also be stuck in a figure head position with your figure head spouse, or you could just go on living and loving and getting great tax breaks and acknowledgement from people who really do care. :)

opps... conintued

the UN must simultaneously hold trust and respect between dozens of nations 
at a time. It might just be the greatest task ever given to an organization in 
world history, and yet just because it seems impossible does that mean we 
should all just ignore the UN from now on? pretend it doesn't exist? Should one 
Nation rise above all others and police the rest of the world with it's own 
values? If the UN has failers in it's missions that means it needs more support. 
If we take the iniciative away from it then we're making it's job harder to do. 
We're taking their respect away. It's basically like saying Thanks to America 
the world is now saved! All you other weenie countries can kiss my ass! You 
will all do as we tell you to and always asume America has the perfect moral 
values! America is a big giant hero country and all you other countries are just 
rubbish, especially France. World peace, or die motha fuckas! muahahahhahaha

San Francisco Bay Guardian 2003 Best of the Bay Area awards.

Best Crusty Electronic Music Freaks


We can trace our conversion to rabid electronic-music fandom
to an afternoon in Golden Gate Park when we heard a thumpy-bump
noise coming from the direction of the Academy of Sciences.  A
little investigation revealed a crusty DJ crew set up in the
Music Concourse, surrounded by throngs of boogeying kids.  That
was SPAZ (stands for Semi-Permanent Autonomous Zone), the BPM
pioneers of the dreadlocked nation of travelers, tourheads,
and Rainbow Family devotees.  Over the years we always
encountered SPAZ DJs wherever the sounds were freshest . hard
breaks in a basement club, hippie grooves in an abandoned China
Basin warehouse, glitchy home-brew electro at a SomArts art
opening.  But SPAZ are more than a sound system.  The Spazheads'
warehouse, one of a transbay string of such for-real live-work
spaces, regularly hosts multimedia arts events as well as
brunches, DIY workshops, and political teach-ins.  Dedicated to
personal freedom, personal responsibility, noncommercial art,
barter economies, and grassroots democracy, SPAZ are coming
soon to a semiautonomous permanent zone near you.

safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."

"Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded.  It's 
a relationship between equals.  Only when we know our own darkness well can 
we be present with the darkness of others.  Compassion becomes real when we

why is it that, while you don't hesitate to employ, not only an
arsenal of ad homminem attacks, but countless red herrings and
slippery slope arguments yourself, as soon as someone gets
frustrated with you debate tactics are suddenly something you care
about?

No, no, no, it's not about being jellous of the American way of life.

The "liberal" media didn't say quagmire, the troops in Iraq said so (and
those who spoke out are getting punished for it), and General John Abizad
(new commanding General of Iraq) also said we are in a quagmire. 
Well they did actualy use the word Guerilla war. 
But quagmire/guerilla war, means the same thing... VIETNAM!
The only person who said we're not in a guerilla war or quadmire was
draft dodging Donald Rumsfeld.
So, the troops in Iraq and General Abizad say we are, 
and Donald Rumsfeld said were not.
Who am I to believe? 
Our solders in Iraq and General Abizad or 
Donald Rumsfeld who sits in a nice comfortable office in D.C.?

So again, it comes down to this,
who am I to believe?

What do you base the supposed "idiocy" of CNN and the BBC on?
That they don't see reality the way you want them to?

Let me see if I can understand your logic....
CNN and the BBC are wrong because their "liberal"
Fox News is right because it's on the right.
So, the logical conclusion is that because the BBC and CNN are wrong,
that proves they are idiots,
and because Fox News is on the right,
they proves that they are right. Right?
Ahhhh... gotcha!

Here's some interesting bit of information:
CNN uses military satellites to broadcast is coverage in the Middle East.
So, I guess the military are accomplices to "idiots" too!

Hey....speaking of re-building, 
when are we going to re-build America?


        <<<<<<< "The war on terror is going to be pennies on the dollar
compared to 
                                      ignoring the problem like Clinton
did." >>>>>>>>>>>>

 
Thats right!!!
Blame everyting on poor Bill! 
It's called passing the blame game.

The war on terror is not that simple.
It's about American foreign policy, 
and both Republicans and Democrats share the blame.

The terror attacks Bill Clinton expirenced as president was directed
toward the United States regardless who was president at the time.
When the buildings fell in Africa, the terrorists didn't give a hoot who
was President.
All they wanted to do was hit America.
Mr.Clinton just happen to be the one who was President at that time.
And they still would have done it, 
no matter who was president.
maybe even with more determination if Bush was President.

Who was President when 9/11 happened?
Did that stop them?
And now were being told they're after us again.
So much for the shock and awe effect of American might!

The only difference was Bill was smart enough not to be so trigger happy
as Bush is.
Even half senile Ronald Reagan was smart enough to realize the Middle
East was a quadmire, 
and had enough sense to get the hell out of Lebanon when Marines were
killed there back in '84.
You see, it doesn't matter how smart your weapons are,
If you are hated, some will get you sooner or latter.
Bush hasn't learned the Vietnam lesson yet.
One reason because his daddy fixed it so he wouldn't go.
If he did go, maybe he wouldn't act so much like a cowboy.



         <<<<<<  "I will not vote for anyone  that wants to be soft on
terror.  Ever. " >>>>>>>>>

I wouldn't vote for someone who bases his forgern policy on testosterone
instead of intelligence.

Here's one of the big problems with Bush's foreign policy.
Tuff, bad ass men just don't live in the U.S., and paticulary in Texas.
There's some real tuff dudes out there in the world, paticulary in the
Middle East, who can kick some serious American ass. 
I'd like to see some macho American cowboy type try to go toe to toe with
some of these terrorists.
These locos arn't afraid of us.

Presidet Bush said, "bring it on!"
and you know, they will.
Bush is going to learn the hard way,
and we will have to suffer because of it,
that Texas justice doesn't seem to be too impressive out there in the
real world.

Clint Eastwood movies are not a good foundation for foreign policy.



    <<<<<<<<  "I wish I could take by my votes for Clinton because he
cause the problems 
                        that we are seeing today."  >>>>>>>>>>>>>
 
Oh no here we go again, like a bad habbit,
It's someone else's fault.

Let's say this again,
It's not whose President,
It's about America. 



      <<<<<<<<<< "Because of his inaction, we are seeing nuclear
proliferation problems and a
                            growing terrorist threat. " >>>>>>>>>>>

Uh... excuse me, but under who's presidency is excellerated nucular
proliferation happening?
It starts with a "B" , not a "C"

Clinton almost had North Korea under control until George came into
office and became belligerent and started to act bad ass toward the North
Koreans.
Now were acting all bad ass toward Iran and pushing them in the nuclear
corner.
Can you understand why North Korea, maybe Iran too, wants to build, or
already has, nuclear weapons?
It's called self survival.

And if we dare attack North Korea,
Seoul will be destroyed,
Tokyo will be wiped out,
and Possibly San Francisco will be in ashes.
Oh, we'll nucke North Korea all right,
But what have we "liberated"?
A world wide economic catastrophy?
and thousands of square miles of nuclear waste land?
Not to mention all that nuclear fall out
falling all over the world?
 
Not a very bright foreign policy to me!



   "The only way to stop these issues is to  carry a big stick and not be
afraid to whack people with it."

Bush has, what I call a "corner the racoon and strike it" policy.
Anyone who deals with wild animals has enough sense to know not corner an
animal if your going to catch it.
A cornered animal will fight back.
You might kill it, but it will leave you pretty fucked up in the process.

The meaning of this is, if you hit people,
someone will hit you back.
America is not imune to the laws of karma.
Don't like that word?
Sounds too metaphysical/hippyish/new age to you?
Let's try another word, 
It's also called, "what goes around, comes around."

All we are doing is not addressing the real problem of terrorism.
We're just exaberating it more by acting like a street thug.
Fine for our American ego,
but sooner or latter, someone will find our Achilles's heel and bring us
down.
And like the saying goes about the giant in "Johnney And The Bean Stock"
story,
"the bigger they are, the harder they will fall."
America is the world's Golliath,
and someone will eventualy find a rock big enough to take us down.

If you want to live the thug life,
you need to realize that someone, someday will eventualy out thug you.
That's the law of the jungle.
So goes the thug life!

Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

You assume wrong fucknut.  I have no problems with gays, gay marriages,
or gays in the military.  Would you like to see the pics I took at pride
in SF in castro?    

I don't particularly care why they "hate us".  The ones that do are
idiots like you.  The rest of them like us and I get along great with
them.

I'm not going to bother to respond to the rest of your stuff because you
assume too much about me.  

For the record:
I am a centrist.  I vote for who is best.  I believe in smaller
government and states rights.  The ONLY thing the federal government
should specialize in is international intelligence and a federal army.
The rest should be left up to the state. Bottom line.. I believe in
issues, issues, issues.. not political parties.   

I belong to at centrist organization and our motto is:
http://www.centristcoalition.com/index.php?module=ContentExpress&func=di
splay&ceid=4&mid=-1

The Centrist Coalition is a gathering place for moderate Americans who
have a certain distinct vision of political leadership in our country.

We believe strong leadership involves a bold mix of views drawn partly
from the right and partly the left.

On the one hand, we embrace an economic agenda focused on growth and
fiscal responsibility. We believe in free trade, fair competition, and
limited government.

On the other hand, we embrace an inclusive social agenda that celebrates
the rich diversity of American life, and seeks to avoid imposing one
person's choices on another. We are pro-choice and pro-civil rights.

We endorse candidates with a bold mix of views consistent with this
vision of a prosperous and inclusive America.

The "liberal" media didn't say quagmire, the troops in Iraq said so (and
those who spoke out are getting punished for it), and General John
Abizad
(new commanding General of Iraq) also said we are in a quagmire. 
Well they did actualy use the word Guerilla war. 
But quagmire/guerilla war, means the same thing... VIETNAM!
The only person who said we're not in a guerilla war or quadmire was
draft dodging Donald Rumsfeld.
So, the troops in Iraq and General Abizad say we are, 
and Donald Rumsfeld said were not.
Who am I to believe? 
Our solders in Iraq and General Abizad or 
Donald Rumsfeld who sits in a nice comfortable office in D.C.?
