Primal Scream. Rave. Warfield. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

My last family reunion was more of a rave than this was.

	To P.S.'s credit, they did play rather well - and once I went up to the
balcony to watch them, it was pretty fun - but everything else was a disaster.
The Warfield, an old theatre with a standing-room-only pit in front, tables and
two bars on the first level, and a balcony above, has this amazing ability to
absolutely absorb all energy that a crowd might have. And this was plainly
obvious - for a show that was being promoted as and being billed as a "rave",
very few people were dancing at all, and I saw more "Nirvana" and "Siouxsie"
T-shirts there than I thought existed. The music was, well, BORING. It ranged
from uninventive backbeats to industrial/pop to the '89 remix of "State Farm"
by Yaz. The sound system was pretty weak, as there was a significant lack of
"bass" - I tried dancing, but after about 30 seconds I'd ask myself, "is this
really worth getting sweaty to?", answer myself in the negative, and stand
there with my arms folded.
	The band was interesting to watch - there were about 7 people on stage,
and they were fun to watch. I was surprised in how little of it seemed 
sequenced - they had two people on keyboards, a drummer, and two guitars, as
well as Bobby and the soul singer (what's her name? Denise Johnson?). Bobby was
obviously "Higher than the Sun" - a member of the audience tried handing him
a flower, and he spent about 3 minutes groping for it before he finally got
it. The light show was pretty good - you can't go wrong with Intellabeams.
They played just about everything off the Screamadelica album, as well as
a new B-side called "Screamadelica", into which they worked "We Are Family".
And when they played songs like "Loaded" or "Higher than the Sun", the
instrumentation was perfect. In "HTTS", the instrumental part right after
the first chorus was simply orgasmic. But other parts of the concert were
very slow, like the two acoustic tracks played in a row (Bobby singing a 
love song just doesn't do it for me....). 
	Almost worth the ticket for the band (especially if you really liked
them - you wouldn't have been too disappointed), but definitely not worth it
for the "rave", which was why I was going. And I missed Woopy Ball for this!

	On another note, did anyone go to the Toon Town/Digital Boy thing
last night? I found out about it at midnight, but was too tired (and angry)
to consider going. The flyer was cool - it has a flexidisc attached with a
Digital Boy song. It also mentioned that Barry Weaver and Doc Martin were
going to be there. Aaarrrgh! So, is ToonTown now considered above ground?

Yeah, I definitely wouldn't consider that show a rave, or anything approximating
one.  The poor sound system for the "dancing" was a real disappointment.  Primal
Scream was awesome though.  Basically, as, was mentioned, the whole Screamadelica
album plus "Screamadelica" which was a fab song.  The Warfield was not very crowded
either, which is kinda cool or kinda not, depending on your personality.
I think the rave crowd was definitely out at that night's events instead
of at Primal Scream.

Someone was handing out flyers for Prodigy next week.  Tix were available at Bass.
Should be rad, Prodigy is supposed to be jammin' live.

Should be heading to Whoopi Ball tonight, depends how the hangover goes.

Subject: Whoopi Ball -- review


Here's a quick mini review of the first night of the Whoopi Ball.  I doubt
anyone will actually read this before Monday, but what the heck....

I went with Ovid Jacob and Jon Drukman, who are both on this mailing list.
We arrived at 1 or so, and the big surprise was: PARKING WAS NO PROBLEM AT ALL!
You just drive into this fenced-in lot, park, and that's it.  We parked, stood 
in line for 30 or 45 minutes and then got in.  There were three warehouses.  
Two of them had dance floors.  Each dance floor was 1/4 the size of the Townsend
dance floor.  Plus there were various rooms to chill and hang.

For the first hour or so, the main dance floor was just fucking packed.  Way
too many people, lots of people barging through the dance floor to cross it.
(Bad layout, there was no other way to cross the dance floor.)  Anyway, at 3:30
the crowd started to thin a little, and DJ Rick Preston started.  This guy is
an excellent DJ.  He was right on the money in every way.  And it's refreshing
to have a little change from the usual Garth / Jeno thing.

The chill-out rooms were like no other I've ever been in.  Again, maybe it was
just the fact that it wasn't the same old Toontown / Gathering crowd, which
I've become accustomed to.  But I met some very cool people (no one from this
list, though).

Of course, the ideal time to be on the dance floor ended up being at 7 am or so,
when it was down to 50 or 60 people.  A DJ named Jessie was on.  This guy
was pretty amazing.  His mixing and musical selection were flawless.  He did
a looooong overlay of Rozalla's "Everybody's Free" over Return of the Living
Acid's "Get Funky" which absolutely made my head spin.

Somehow I missed the cartoons with Enrique (darn).  The breakfast buffet
consisted of donuts, Cheerios, milk and tea -- an excellent cure for a churning
stomach.

Alcohol: There wasn't any, so if you want it, you're out of luck.


THE LAST WORD:

The Whoopi Ball gets the big Twitch thumbs up.  Go!



Oh, I know people on this list aren't into the music review thing, but....

The best domestic 12" out right now is "Zigurrats of Cinnamon" by Anne Dudley
and Jaz Coleman.  It's basically classical Arabic music combined with elements
of Western pop (done very well).  The original LP mix is great.  I was
expecting the techno mixes to suck, but they do an excellent job of retaining
the basic feel of the original without sacrificing the qualities that make
good techno interesting.

Subject: Dr. Tim

Here's what you missed at the Troc -er, I mean 520 4th St. - last nite.
The Rhythm Society (meaining, I think, Preston, who has quit Toon Town in
a supposedly subterranean direction) put on a talk by Tim Leary as an opener 
for thr first of their weekly Friday night events.  Tim was, as I expected,
a mildly sepllbining huckster.  He wove together observations on the evolution
of media from oral to written word to printing to (he and a lot of computer
vendors claim) CD-ROM, presneting each a a mjor leap in humanity's quest
for the god within.  An engaging talk; he said a lot of semi-obvious stuff
 - consdier how psychedelic a rose window was to a medieval peasant - and
was generally a lovable old guy, pretnend / being senile, and aking the
audience to help him out.  Good video projections too.  And a spontaneous
round of applause when Bruce Eisner was spotted in the audience.  IMHO, that
guy is a bit of a ham.  

The rave which followed was no big deal; too much competition elsewhere perhaps.
The Leary crowd looked to be only 1/2 ravers, and was about 200 or so.  We 
left.   At 3 am I went back.  It was just like the same place the prior week.
samllish crowd, people were indivudally friendly but big rave  nrg was not
really in effect.  Plus the music was quite boring. De-corticated rhythm box
grindings.  Only good spot was "Voodoo Ray".  So, Tim knows what raves are
and why they tap into ancient human drives &c.  I'm glad I went.  But them
I'm glad I wen to see George Clinton do a mediocre show in '89.  Some people
matter even if the event is imperfect.  Sounds like PS was worth a miss.
Too bad I'm missing the Gathering tonite to work on my final project on 
databases.

just in case anybody didnt know... T 99 and Quadrophonia are the same people
and they are some of the best rap/techno people around
their stuff really blows me away, so it will be interesting to see if 
T 99 plays quadrophonia stuff or not... but anyhow...

the REAL reason i am posting is in outrage over what happened here in
LA a couple days ago
3 teen agers stole some nitrous oxide from a hospital and started
doing it in the cab of their pick-up truck
well they stole 3 tanks or so, and they kept the cab air tight
the nitrous became more prevalent than the oxygen and they suffocated
ALTHOUGH i do think that this is a horrible event,
the locals news have placed the blame of the death on nitrous oxide 
INSTEAD of the fact that they could have put any gas in the tanks and
considering the closed environment, it would have killed them jsut the same
BUT they just did a 'report' on the 'underground scene' here in LA
that really disgusted me
 they made it sound so much worse than it actually is,
and are being really stupid about the whole thing,
BUT i think this could be real bad news for Raves in the near future
so stay alert and dont let people be misinformed
(which i have to say, i _might_ be, but i learn everything from
watching the news, so i am as mis informed as the people who are
spreading the lies if i am)
ARG i hate talking head news people who dont think

	I was afraid the media would be attempting to link those deaths with
the "scene". Very unfortunate, it only means the cops will be cracking down
more and more, security's gonna get tighter, everyone will be more tense, etc.
One thing really worries me - they listed the names in a short blurb in the
Chronicle up here (front page!), and one of them was Michael Cook, age 23,
and I remember a DJ by that name down there, who was always doing shows with
Kool-Aid. Are they one and the same? If so, I could see that having a real
chilling effect on drug use in the rave scene...

Subject: Woopy Ball: The Mother of all Raves


K	This was fantastic. I'm so sorry I wasted $15 plus parking at Primal
Scream last night rather than be here all weekend. The Mother of All Raves 
would be a good nickname. Maybe Woodstock, the Next Generation....

	The location was immense. It must have taken me half an hour just 
to scope the whole place out, what with two large techno dance floors, a
huge "chill-out" ambient warehouse which resembled a cross between a
carnival and an airport terminal, the "ragamuffin" room (where I didn't stay
too long), and the central outdoor performance stage. The organizers put
_a_lot_ of effort into making it a fun location: in one techno room, they had
and incredible laser show (nothing beats drawing a circle with a laser on
a rotating mirror ball) and about ten industrial-strength fans blowing cool air
onto the dancers, along with the necessary psychedelic slide show; in the other
room there was a live drummer playing along to the DJ, as well as nice
hardwood floors which were a joy to dance on, and something which I could 
only descibe at "TV art", which was an artist playing around with a video
camera and a video mixing/effect board, at times aiming the camera at the
TV to produce all sorts of trippy images; but the ambient warehouse takes
the cake as being the most elaborate of the three. There were vendors selling
T-shirts, whistles, pendants, etc., a live ambient musician with his DX7 and
Macintosh, two terminals set up connected to 101 Online (I guess a BBS?),
all sorts of participatory art projects, and about 20 couches with weary
ravers recharging their batteries sprouled over them. Very different than
any other rave I've ever been to, much more elaborate than I expected. 

	The people were very into it, very friendly (Out of the blue two girls
walk up and kiss me in the ambient warehouse - that's friendly!). I saw a 
couple of people from the list, he-of-the-ren-and-stimpy T-shirt and he-of-the-
Curious George T-shirt, as well as a lot of people from my radio station and 
from other raves I've been to. A nice, very social atmosphere.

	The DJ's were great, too. They weren't afraid to play the more
popular stuff, like HR's "Dominator" (I heard it three times, actually, but 
all different mixes :), and they even went back a few years and played some
classic, really ripping acid-house. The segues were almost always flawless,
and they were obviously enjoying themselves, too.

	I stayed until 7. I would have stayed until 9 for breakfast but I
was both tired and famished. 

	I'm trying to think of how it could have been better, what they
should have done differently, and the only thing I can think of would be
more couches! :) Very well done. If anyone on the list has connections with
the organizers, tell them thanks, and hold another one real soon.


	Brian


p.s. - I have the new list of upcoming events ready. It's about 2K - should
I publish it to the list or just make it available on request? I could
make this a weekly thing, like every Wednesday I'll put up a list of all

Subject: Re:  Whoopi Ball -- review


The review continues --

Jon and I headed out for a second night of Whoopi-Ball-ing.  We got there at
2:00.  They had run out of parking, so we parked about 2 blocks away.  No big
deal.

We got in, and there were a lot more people than there had been Friday night.
To make things worse, there was one less chill-out room.  So there were more 
people in less space.  The dance floor was packed tight, and there was no room
to sit in any of the chill rooms.  We didn't see anyone we knew, and after an
hour or so we got sort of sick of it, so we headed back to my car, where we
vegged for about 90 minutes, listening to some tapes (a mix tape and the Human
Resource album, which is very good, by the way).

We headed back to the rave at 4:30, and it was still too crowded.  We did run
into Brian (founder of this list), who said that one of the reasons he had come
to the Whoopi Ball was the review I had posted the previous day.  (Sorry about
that.)

We left at 6:00.


THE FINAL WORD:

We should have stayed at home or gone to the Gathering.  (How was the Gathering?
Anyone go?)


Afterwards: Jon and I finely honed a new concept that may change the rave
scene forever.  (But then again, it might not.)  More details as we progress.

Mike -- maybe friday night was truly exceptional, or maybe you were
just burnt from friday to enjoy saturday. I went w/ my friend Dave
from Colorado and we had a ripping good time. Stayed from midnight
till breakfast @ 8AM. Kept the Lies Surging all night long! 

One person mentioned that they spent litle time in the raga room. I found
this to be a welcome change from the techno/acid rooms, and the DJs were
spining & mixing some seriously cool dub.

So who were the DJs in the room w/ the interactive video art displays? There
were at least three of them and the two male DJs were fucking fantabulous!

All in all, far more enjoyable than the Gathering rave I attended. 

SO... Please post more info on these more underground raves. 

PS: I accidentally hit upon my first raves while vacationing on the
Balearic island of Ibiza in Spain one summer in 88 -- I met up w/ this
drop-dead gorgeous spanish woman who introduced me to the "Amnesia"
club and other delights. It's interesting to see how far the scene has
come from Balearic Beat to England's Acid House, to the US rave scene.
The latter is very different from the former two! Course the Ibiza
rave scene was filled w/ much richer euro-trash....

hi y'all!
i agree with niels, this rave was good. i went with mike w. and john d. on fri.
and we had a great time. there WERE more people on sat. night, but the energy
was great. enrique and bagels for breakfast was excellent! i was dead tired
from dancing all night, yet i couldn't keep from moving. plus i had discovered
a neat thing : if u hold a container full of milk near the speaker, u can
really feel the bass in ur hand. it worked even better with those beach balls
they had floating around the technodrome. i tried the reggae room on sat. but
the sound system really sucked : it seem'd distorted or too loud. was that
just a temporary effect ?
see y'all

has anyone heard anything about 2 BIG but VERY commercial raves
goin on , 
one is called Circa 92, the olympic rave
its going to be a benefit for LACE down here in LA
and people form San Diego and S.F. get discount tix
its really commercial, ticketmaster is selling tix, BUT
the last one i went to like that still had NO2 tanks and actually
it was being passed out for free, so...

also on that is a mention of a 72 RAVE in LAS VEGAS
on the 4th of July weekend.
whether or not that is commercial

is that like normal groups, when one is playing/performing down here
they have a show also in S.F. a day before or after

in a couple weeks T 99, N Joi and Radioactive Goldfish
will ALL be performing at a rave called radioactive
which looks like the best rave to hit town in a long time
(It say Free lollipops, whistles, t-shirts, tapes AND free donuts at dawn)
(But then again fliers tend to lie/exagerate a LOT)
sooo i would guess that all three groups (?) will be performing
in the S.F. area around March 21st so that would be cool to check out

Rent a huge warehouse, a huge sound system, find a DJ with a stack of
techno 12"s or compilations (I recommend the Twitch Remix series,
they're quite cost-effective and great for mixing).  Buy lots of
phenylaline and caffeine and choline from your local health food store
and mix up some smart drinks.  Rent some lasers, lights, oil
projectors, strobes, and slide or film projectors.

Sensory overload!

Well, the smart bars out here generally serve the same stuff.  I gave
a sip of my "NRG" drink to a friend who said, "yup, tastes like
hyped-up Tang to me."

Never mind that stuff.  I'm totally converted to a techno-maniac rave
monster.  I'm going to sell everything I own so I can afford to dress
funny and do candy flips all the time.  YAAAAH!

BTW, it was great meeting Brian (from the list) and the 100's of
non-list people that were exceptionally friendly at the Woopy Ball
this weekend.  I had an absolutely amazing time.

As for whether or not the Woopy Ball is Woodstock: The Next
Generation, Mike Wertheim has postulated that the rave culture will
either become the hippy movement of the 90's, become a totally lame
commercial sell-out thing, or just continue as it is for a while.

I think my initial feeling is that it will be the hippy movement of
the 90's - the crowd at the Woopy Ball certainly proved that there is
no shortage of interest in it.  And if everyone there tells one more
person about it, and then they spread the word, well... look out.

I just wish there was a better people to floor space ratio at the WB
on Saturday PM/Sunday AM.  It was much easier to socialize and dance
on the Friday PM/Sunday AM thing.  Also, it looked to me like people
were burning out really early on Sunday.  It seems like there were
MANY more people crashed out at Sunday 6 AM vs Saturday 6 AM.

Then again, I was among that number, so I can't really criticize.

Also, moving the ragga DJ into the nice warm chill out room was a
mistake, in my book.  That other warehouse was too cold to relax
properly in.  But I'm just a cold wimp.  (Hey, that's why I left
Beantown to start with.)

The fact that they didn't have a lot of agua at Woopy Ball brings another

looking like it *might* (always the keyword in this case) be in a covered
parking garage.  I'm not sure if there are bathrooms, but since we are
allowing reentry this time, I don't really care.  Anyone been to a rave where
there wasn't an available bathroom?  How was it handled?

No idea.  But I know things are worse in LA, where raves are occasionally
broken up by the police.  I heard that at one LA rave that was broken up,
people started stealing things (like the lights and sound system) because
the people running the rave wouldn't refund their money.  This seems really
lame to me.  If the police break up a rave, it makes sense to spread out
the monetary loss among the ravers rather than have the people in charge
lose thousands of dollars.  Perhaps America is just too lame to have a cool
rave scene.

I remember two bad experiences with LA raves (well more, but two stand out
significantly).

	The weekend before coming up here I headed out with three people
(2 of whom had never been to a rave before) for Genesis, which by all
appearance looked to be awesome. We went to the map point in Hollywood
and paid $20 each, and then drove to the south-of-downtown warehouse.
When we arrived, there were cops driving up and down the street blaring
from their megaphones "Party's Over"... :(. I saw Barry Weaver standing
on a corner, telling people to come back in an hour, things would be cool
by then - that the organizers had all the permits and such, but the
cops were being assholes because they caught a minor on the street _outside_
the party drinking a Jack Daniels. Talk about weak! We waited until 2:30
(we had gotten there by 12:30 or 1), but still no luck. When I got
home I called the voice mailbox, and the guy on the other end blamed the
cops, told us the situation, and asked us not to take out our aggression
on the map point (a store on Melrose, actually). Hesaid tickets would
be honored at the next rave they put on, and he also said the organizers
lost $17,000 . He even broke down the costs - $1000 per DJ for 5 DJ's,
$2000 for the flyers, $2500 for the mailing, $2000 for the sound system,
$3000 for the lighting, etc.... Very cool, actually.

	The other bad experience was, I believe, over Thanksgiving,
when one was held at an ice rink in Culver City. I think this may have
been the one you mentioned, Mike, because when I got there at 11:45 I
had never seen more Raiders jackets in all my life, and as I walked up
to the huge line outside, suddenly people were running, scattering everywhere,
and one guy dove behind his car next to me. I asked him what was going on,
and he said the place got overcrowded and people were trying to get in, and
so of course when there's a group who doesn't get what they want, they
start firing. He said if I valued my life I should get down. And I did.
Afetr about half an hour of chaos I ran to my car, with my date, and
sped off. I heard later from some friends who had been inside that a riot
had broken out, that yes indeed some equipment was stolen, but several
cop cars showed up and _miraculously_ restored peace and let the show
go on. This was all after I had left, though. I don't think anyone was
killed, but there was so much chaos.... Urb blabbed on and on about it
for months. (URB, the magazine) I seem to attract this sort of thing;
I was also at the Cineplex in Universal City when "Boyz n the Hood" came
out, and there was shooting there over it. Quite an, er, experience...
	I shan't discuss the rave I went to where I had $500 of car stereo
equipment stolen....... another more pleasing aspect of raves up here in
the City of Love compared to the ones in LA :) (What, me LA-bashing? I
thought the day would never come...)

	I'd have to contend with the claim that the "best raves" are held in
So. Cal.  We all have different ideas about what constitutes a good "rave" - 
the ones in LA are certainly bigger, but I don't know that the spirit is 
still there. I went to a few when I was down over Christmas and Thanksgiving,
and they were a lot less fun than the raves before last summer. And what with
Avalon ghost-sponsoring some events (sorta like Bill Graham Presents promoting
Woopy Ball 8^), it became a really slick production. I've gotta take you
to a couple up here, Darren (to the others on the list - Darren and I have been friends for years), so you can see what I mean, because it's hard to explain.
I mean, how many people did you ever _meet_ at a rave, that you started a 
conversation with and exchanged phone numbers, etc.? I can't remember meeting
anyone, at least not forming friendships with them, they way I have up here.
It's a smaller community, but a lot friendlier. I've begun to notice that SF
is like this in general (gratuitous San Fransisco self-glorifying inserted :)
I still like the scene down there, god Mickey's Holy Water Adventure was intens,
but I like it up here a bit more. Come up and I'll show ya.

Your description sounds alot like the Gathering Rave in SF on Sat Mar 6.
The gathering seems to have a thing for the flowerlady, you see.

But, No I didn't go -- I was having even more fun at the Woopy Ball Rave in
Oakland. Totally mindblowing. (1) techno floor, (1) acidhouse floor, (1)
ragamuffin/dub room, (1) chill out room, lots of cybertoys, lasers,
videoart and freaky fucked-up people.  All spread out over 4-5 wherehouses
adjoined by a common outdoors area containing a stage and various live
music performances throughout the evening. I swear the cops didn't even
know this thing was going on. It woulda been a definite bust, IMHO.

Most incongruous thing -- From around 7-9AM, there was a blues band that
performed in the outdoors area as the ravers chilled out and took in the
warmth of the cloud-speckled california morning sun. The blues band sound
had to do battle with hard techno/acid sounds and whoops emanating from the
last dancefloor that was open, and it sounded pretty funny.  And how many
blues bands do you know that would be willing to perform at 7 in the
morning?

PS: There is a mailing list for the SF rave scene -- send a request
to sfraves-request@petrus.Berkeley.EDU

PPS: where does the term "rave" really come from. I can think of two very
old uses of "raver" that predate the balearic-beat/acid-house/rave scene:

	(1) David Bowie's "Drive-in Saturday" where he sings
		"it's a ??? for the ravers... it's a drive in saturday"
	(2) A Steel Pulse song (Sound System??) where I think the lyric goes

Ditto for Bob Carasik's comment.   They should have their own socalrave.
The Bay Area and Southern CA. do not mix.

Speaking of L.A. - Do the ravers there look like they're from 
the Beverly Hills 90210 show?

Count this as another vote against including southern California raves.  If
people want to hear about them, let 'em sign up for the socal list (if one
is set up).  The traffic on this list is pretty high already...

	Beverly Hills?  Hardly.  Mainly a lot of minorities, though.  Everyone
really gets into it though.  And I guess I shouldn't compare SF and LA raves
until I go to an SF one.  But it is fair to say that SF raves did spawn from
LA...

	You have to understand my position, though.  One, I don't believe a
list for socal raves exists as of now. Myself, a native of L.A., go to
Cal Poly SLO, which facilitates the driving home for a weekend rave.  But,
I am too far away to facilitate the mediating of a socal rave list.  Unless
someone else is willing to start one up?  Maybe someone in SB who knows
the INSOMNIAC clan who put on the Santa Barbara raves??

Here's some details about Stanford's first ever rave:

			Time vs. Body

Location: Enchanted Broccoli Forest (I'll post directions if anyone's
				     interested)

It's 9pm-7am and entrance is free.

There'll be a psychedelic light show, pay-as-you-go smart bar and
complimentary breakfast.

The DJ's haven't been confirmed yet but the person organizing it said
probably two rave regulars, Bernard Cabigon from The Edge and someone
who works for Twitch.

And most important, this event is sponsored by KZSU and EBF.

OK, this is in many parts now, but here's the directions:


>From 101, take the University Ave. exit. Go straight on University for
a long time which will turn into Palm Drive as you enter campus.
Turn left on Campus Drive. This is where it gets fuzzy. Follow Campus
around watching for when you cross Mayfield Ave. This is the last real
cross street before EBF. EBF is the 4th dorm/house on the right handside
of Campus Drive. If you get to an intersection with traffic light, you've
gone a little too far.

>From 280, take the Alpine Rd. exit. Follow it for a while. Turn right on
Junipero Serra Blvd. The second traffic light after that is Campus Drive
East. Turn left there. EBF is the second dorm/house on the left. If you
get to a stop sign, you've gone too far.

If you get lost on campus, your best bet is to stop at one of the you
are here maps at the entrances to campus.

Subject: Being polite on mailing lists

(or how to not overwhelm everyone with noise)

Account Status
--------------
If the volume is too high for you, or you otherwise want to change 
your account status, please send it to
sfraves-request@petrus.Berkeley.EDU rather than having to announce your
dissatisfaction to the group at large. This generally sounds like sour
grapes and is considered in poor taste.

"ME TOO"
--------
If someone is requesting for information that you want too, please
send them a private mail for your "ME TOO" rather than posting to the
whole mailing list. Generally the more "ME TOO"s a person sees the less
likely they are to go to the effort of responding to any of them. Also
whenever you request information it is generally considered proper to
compile what you receive and post a summary about two weeks later (Mostly
to placate all the "ME TOO"s you'll get).

When NOT to use the mailing list
--------------------------------
If you want to tell Belinda how great her new hairdo looks,
rather than mailing this to "sfraves" because you know she's on the
mailing list, send her private mail instead so as to not spoil the surprise for
the hundred (?) or so other people on the group. The same goes with
something you feel is inappropiate to the mailing list --send the
offending person mail about how you feel "Electric Eel Juggling" is not quite
right for sfraves privately rather than further annoying everyone
and showing yourself to be a public bore. Part of the fun of mailing
lists are the number of private discussions that they spawn, all
bubbling underneath the global distribution.

RAVE postings
-------------
When you actually know of a rave, or are advertising one yourself, please
title it "RAVE:<location>" so that it will stand out from the noise.
(Most people easily get 80 mail messages a day, of which they will actually
read 12. Welcome to the net.) 

The better the directions you include the more likely people are to risk
getting lost in high crime heavy industrial areas to come. Date, time, cover
and what ages are welcome are also considered polite, as is a phone number
since some people make printouts and hand them to (computerless) friends. 

Criticism, suggestions appreciated.

What does anybody know about the relationship between rave and

	I know there has been a lot of traffic recently, and about 5 people
have unsubscribed because of it. A few have suggested a digest format, but
I'm not to up on that idea. A better idea is this - I've set up a mail
alias, sfraves-calendar, and using that I'll send out a calender of upcoming
events every Sunday night. Everyone on the list is automatically also on
the alias, I won't be posting the calendar to the list anymore. If you want
to unsubscribe from the sfraves list but stay on the sfraves-calendar list,
send me mail as sfraves-request, and it shall be done. I personally 
read all the letters to sfraves-request (there's no automatic mail program
installed) so be explicit in saying what you want. I would still highly
recommend that people stay on the main list, as this is where all the
real issues about the rave scene will betalked about, but for those who
only check their mail occasionally, the calendar is probably ideal. I
was considering just posting the list of raves to ba.music or something,
sorta like "This week's list" of concerts and gigs that gets put up, but I
feel that's kinda impersonal and devalues the whole thing. Remember, the
calendar list is NOT a traditional mailing list, just an alias I use to
distribute info to everyone. Anyway, let me know. Please refrain from sending
mail about this to the list, just send it to me, bbehlen or sfraves-request.

	About the Prodigy show - it is indeed Sunday night/Monday morning,
at 1AM. Does anyone know his _real_ age? I was always under the impression
that he was 16 years old, but now I hear he's 20. Hmm....

	Also, about multiple messages - I don't know why that would be
happening, unless I have a few bad addresses on the list, and when you
send mail to the list the undeliverable mail gets returned to you (anyone
who's on other lists knows about this - I once posted a message to murmur,
the REM list, and got back 55 "MAILER_DAEMON - USER UNKNOWN" messages, 
sometimes as late as three weeks after I mailed it!!!!) So far I think
all the addresses here are cool, but if they aren't _please_ let me know.
Other than that, I don't know... compile them together and send them to
me, maybe my sysadmin would be able to tell from the bookkeeping at the
top of the messages.... 

	That's all. Keep me in touch. Oh, there's 115 people on the list
now. Huh? What's that in the background? ".....we are family....."

any of the original versions (except for 'little fluffy clouds')

this album reminded me a lot of enigma's "MCMXC a.d" and the art of noise's
"ambient collection" because the music is really relaxing and all the 
tracks run together.  This is great music to study to.  Really.  

the remix of "little fluffy clouds" is completely different from the
original (and includes more quotes from rickie lee jones!) but it's stilll 
the most danceable track on the album.

OHH NO!! Liam talked about how the rave/techno scene has gone overground.  The
music are all over the charts and he wishes that it will go back underground.

Is the rave scene here going overground too??  Last month, Entertainment Tonighthad a segment on raves.  Two weeks after that, KTVU news also had a segment
on raves and on that same week Chronicle's sunday paper wrote about raves.
Last week CNN and MTV ditto.  Also last month's SPIN and the march issue of

Musical/social trends seem to only have a lifetime of "newness" and
"undergroundness" for about a year or so.  I still take great satisfaction in
the fact that I listen to music that is unavailable to the general populace
and doesn't appear on radio stations for six months to a year.  You shouldn't
morn the death (or popular birth in some sense) of raves, you should find some
way to expand it or scrape up something new.

Raves WILL hit the pop market.  Rave culture WILL be exploited for big bux.
So what?  Wankers who cry over the death of punk should try listening to
something else.  A lot of music has a shelf life, a lot doesn't.  The one
thing that remains the same is there will ALWAYS be new groups, new music, and
new trends.  "Industrial" as it stands has been aboveground for a while now.
Practically every club here has an "industrial" night.  However, whenever I go
to one, I'm usually disappointed in the music they play.  Its all over a year
old, highly mainstream, and poorly DJ'd.  People are complaining about bad
raves more and more.  I went to one "rave" last week here where the guy told
me he wouldn't play Coil's "Snow" or any Eon because they were too industrial.
He'd obviously never heard Eon, or the "Snow".  Instead, he was content to
play New Order (including "Blue Monday") and KLF album cuts.  As they say,
excellence never goes out of style.

I really don't like the 'retro' style of raves, nor do I enjoy the black
leather of industrial.  I'd like to see a culture emerge from technology
fashion and cyberstyle.

Whew.. Listen to me ramble.

For anyone who doesn't know, Aptos is south of Santa Cruz (@6 miles?).
To get to Aptos High you take the Freedom Ave exit off of Highway 1 and
head back over the freeway (away from the ocean) and follow the signs.

Who cares. I mean, if ya'll are sooo concerened about being "underground"
why do you advertise your parties ( oh 'scuse me 'raves') and smart bars
and cyberstuff etc. etc. etc. Dig, styles become fashions become trends
become mainstream watered-down drivel. It happened to the Beats, the Hippies,
the Yippies, the Punx, etc. etc. And it's been happening to the Acid House/
Rave sceen since before (many of) y'all ever heard of Acid House. Shit,
the best "rave" I ever attended was at the I-BEAM when PTV played there 
alomost 2 years ago. And the whole scene was pretty much "dead" in 
England by then. I was in Italy 4 yrs ago, and all the trendy clothing
shops had Acid House garb in full force, (the coolest were/are the 70's
smiley face with the bullet hole/blood on the forhead), and pretty mainstream. 
I'm actually pretty surprised that the scene lasted as long as it did 
before attracting mainstream media attention in this country. My guess is 
that since it was so meshed with 'drug' culture that they woudn't dare touch it.
I personally think its great that the scene is getting pop. That more 
people are turning on to hard polyrhythmic beats and trance dancing is
a pretty fuckin great thing in a country with so much hate goin down.
In a time where young folks are figuring out their sexual identity
with the paranioa of AIDS, and fear/repression of society as a whole,
trancing out to psycho-sexual rhythm is probably a godsend.  Yeah, anyway,
blah, blah, blah right ? I just can't stand hearing whining about how
"our" scene is becoming "aboveground". That shit is just soooo cliquey,
it spurns comparison and alienation , and that is really the opposite of
what taking "E" and finding truth is all about. No? 
Actually, the fact (that it's getting so mainstream) kinda
bums me out, 'cause I like the more aggressive Acid House stuff, and
as the scene has been getting more mainstream, the intensity of the
music that gets played has been going down. On that note, since some of
y'all are connected with the DJ scene, maybe you can drop some science
on me about who are the more aggro DJ's out there. (MBM, PTV, etc).

peace,

Last April/May, I attended a rave in the basement of big-heart city in SF.
One of the songs the dj played was a nasty one w/ lyrics that went
"work that pussy".

w/r/t to raves going mainstream... well shit, whaddya expect! I'm surprised
it took over four years for raves to cross over from the acieeed scene in
the UK and the Balearic Beat scene in Ibiza....

Want something new? Make it less accessible! Noisier! Harsher! Harder! Nasty!

I don't know if there's any stopping rave culture from going mainstream.
It'll probably just catch a lot of crossover deadheads.

Of course, depends on if we're talking about rave culture or rave music.  I
think too much rave music is overly-accessible, too close to your standard
deeesco staple beats.

It's too bad that the "industrial dub" contingent hasn't made it across the
Atlantic in a big way -- it would make for ideal raving music for those
that like their beats harsh, strident, and funkeee (helps keep out the
riff-raff :-). Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a rave where they played
stuff like ca. 1986-1988 Tack>>Head, or Gary Clail, or even just have
Adrian Sherwood on the mix? (Dream on dream on...)

Another possibility is to go less industrial and more dubwise in a
reggae/raggamuffin stylee -- a big soundsystem party sounds like a good
basis for a rave, as long as the music is properly tweaky!

On the more world music tip, ... when are we going to hear DJs mixing in
Jah Wobble's Invaders o' the Heart, or Monsoon, or Sheila Chandra?

Whatever... I'm outta here for 10 days... seee yaaaaa.

Subject: Kundalini, Big Bux and Real Culture


I've just read the lates batch of sf-raves mailings, and saw references to
Kundalini, the loss of Rave culture to the Biz weenies, and the consequent
loss of _real_ rave experience once the bux start moving.  Seems to me that
the real rave experience (tribal movement, energy coming out of the ground
through my stomping feet, overwhelming sight/sound, the worx) can't be
duplicated by the fluff masters down at the mall no matter how hard they
try.  I agree with the post that said there is (i paraphrase) always a
demand for excellence.  I would add that real culture (and lets face it,
this kind of gig is a genuine sub-culture) can't be bought.  It has to be
lived.  Staying in touch with the small groups who actually give a shit
(like through this list - keep it up Brian :-) ) is one of the best ways to
stay fresh.  If the big biz groups want to do pay homage to king buk, let
'em.  It'll keep the fad heads away from the real thing.  Sorry for the
rant.  Steve.

Subject: aboveground "raves"

I might as well put my 2 cents out here. The one obvious thing I see
missing in this discussion is that as raves become aboveground and trendy
it will become more of an alcohol (read rowdy) crowd who doesn't really
care about the music but just wants to get fucked-up and be seen. The last
ToonTown I went to there were alot of shirts and ties who were standing
there with their arms folded. You could tell they really weren't into the
music at all. Fortunately by around 2:30 - 3:00 most of those types had
left. I myself don't like nightclubs for that very reason. I'm just not
into drunks and obnoxious meat market environments. Anyone remember the
disco's of the 70's? Yeachhhhh!!! When you get into environments like that
people are so uncaring about others. They push and shove and there's no
consideration for others.
 
Also I agree with the person who said that the music will become more
mainstream. I myself like hard core tekno/industrial stuff. I also like the
dub style stuff.

Welcome to the continuing cycle of under/above/under/above-

pigs. Yes, you will be able to get "Ravester Happy Meals" at  
McDonalds complete with choline-and-B1-based "McNutrient Shakes."

If it's in the Guardian, if it made MTV, it's over...

On the other hand, there will still be raves that DON'T get written  
up in the Datebook section of the Chronicle. People will continue to  
create interesting new environments for others to enjoy. People will  
dance. People will make good dance music -- call it Tekno or House or  
Acid or Post-industrial-dance-music or whatever the hell you want.

There's no reason we must stop having fun just because everyone else  
is too.

Cultures don't emerge, they are manufactured and supported. They are  
fed. If you'd like to see a "culture emerge from technology fashion  
and cyberstyle," then help create one!!!

I don't mean to be critical. I'm simply pointing out the fact   
mainstream success will only destroy the underground spirit that  
makes raves work at all if that spirit is abandoned.

Subject: Space Bass, The Prodigy, Sharon Finds Destiny

I started my first rave experience on a low note, I think -- I had
fun, but there are things I've got to change both with myself and
which ones I go to.

The Space Bass at Aptos HS was pretty dead at 11PM when I checked it
out.  I never went in -- could someone please review it?

I got to Sharon Finds Destiny at around 1AM, and the line was in a
weird shape.  I didn't feel like waiting in line at the moment, so ...

I tried The Prodigy.  I got there about 2:30AM, and it was fairly full
of people.  It didn't really feel all that fun to me, the people were
kind of old and boring, the set wasn't spectacular in my opinion, the
music didn't do anything, and it seemed disproportionately straight
for SF.

Finally, I came back to Sharon Finds Destiny, and got in at around
4AM.  I was the only person in line at the door when I got there, so
there must have been about the right amount of people inside.  There
were two floors and a bit of rest space.  The music was pretty good.
The light show IMHO wasn't nearly as wonderful as it could have been.
I was really impressed by the fact that there were so many young
people there -- it looked as if many minors (under 18) had made it out
there, which made me quite happy (I was once a minor, and today I'm
still under 21).  While I was there, I had lots of fun dancing, but
didn't really feel any sort of binding with anyone -- people weren't
really expressing feelings towards each other that much like I heard
happens at some raves.  One thing was really neat, even though I had
difficulty dealing with myself on this -- there was very little sexual
pressure if any at all.  It wasn't a place to pick up on anyone (as
far as I could tell), it was just a place to have fun dancing and
whatever else.  At 6AM the music wound down and the lights came on.

Club St. John had Eternity as an after-rave party thing.  They were
checking ID, so they wouldn't let me in (my 21st is tomorrow; typical
SJ), but it seemed like a sort of half and half crowd of regulars and
non-regulars (re: GLB and nonGLBish folk).

What all am I trying to say?  I dunno, just thought I'd sort of fill
in ... I'm looking forward to some funner experiences yet.

Here's some flyers I happened to get while there:

Subject: "industrial" music at raves


A few days ago someone said something about playing more aggressive "industrial"
music, like MBM and PTV (Meat Beat Manifesto and Psychic TV), at raves.  I
never hear any of the usual industrial stuff at raves, but some of the rave
DJs do play some pretty aggressive techno, and most it is a hell of a lot more
aggressive than "Psyche Out" or "Meet Every Situation Head On".  (Jon Drukman
once referred to this stuff as "music to castrate cats by".)  DJ Rick Preston
plays a lot of hard techno, so if you're into that kind of thing, be on the
lookout for him.

As far as playing actual industrial stuff at raves -- most people I know are
either completely burnt out on the genre or were never into it in the first
place.  I would probably enjoy such a thing if the DJ avoided all the really
overplayed stuff and concentrated on the older ZYX, Antler and Kaos stuff.
(Time to drag out those old Razormaid issues.)

started. they had some ok bands play live before that. THEN, there was a lot
of booz and hair and tunnel-bridge crowd. everybody was in their own space
and there was no sense of connection. it did not seem that many people were
tripping - not that it's necessary, but it does help. finnaly, by the time
the rave music was in full swing there were just a few people left - u see,
the booz had stopped, so many people had appearntly come just for that... -
so there were not enough people to HAVE a rave- what's the critical mass of
people for a rave ? 80 ? 100 ?  well, that's about all.
take care and rave on

Subject: Definitions


There are really no set definitions, as the music industry changes from day to
day with the advent of new technologies made available to artists and producers.
Below is a more humourous look at some of the genres you described, and then 
some.

Alternative : a genre of music that its makers pretend is distinct from any style, even though it really isnt; new wave music, renamed because new wave 
became old hat; music marketed to youths with bad skin, poor dating prospects,
and too much black clothing.

Fusion : any genre, but usually music sporting elements of jazz and rock, in
which disparate musical styles are combined to create a new entity that lovers
of said styles will hate; the aural equivalent of a Shirley Temple; music 
marketed to people who wouldn't know the difference if you swapped their
oatmeal for wallpaper paste.

Industrial : a genre of music that attempts to duplicate the sound of your head
being run through a printing press; alternative songs that are an alternative
to alternative songs; music marketed to people who feel like shit all the time,
and like it.

Pop : a genre of music that openly courts popularity, rather than putting on 
the air of artistic integrity, while secretly trying to suck your wallet dry;
songs that stick in your head like an aural fishook that will rip your brain
out of your skull if you don't sing along for a minimum of eight hours; music
marketed to everyone who eats, sleeps, or breathes.

Punk : a genre of music characterized by speed, brevity, and fans who see 
vomiting as an acceptable substitute for a handshake; songs that manage to be nw wave and alternative at the same times; music marketed to people who don't
enjoy bathing, gargling, or human interaction of any kind.

Rap : a genre of music characterized by danceable beats and spoken nursery
rhymes about penis size, pulling trains, ho's, bitches, and not touching
anything; songs about living in poverty written by musicians who wear gold
chains, drive expensive cars, and vote Republican; music marketed to people
who wouldn't blink at paying 200 bucks for a pair of tennis shoes.

Rock : a genre of music characterized by repetitive structures, spare
instrumentation, and lyrics about cars, babes, sex, and having sex in 
your car, with babes; a word that can be used in the place of every other
musical term except maybe opera, and sometimes even that one, too; music
marketed to people who actually like Steve Winwood, Journey, and Grand
Funk Railroad.

I hope this gives you a bit of perspective, if somewhat warped.

Rave Music:
First off, as far as I know, there is no such thing as "rave music."
You hear lots of different stuff at raves, but techno is usually the
dominant style.

Industrial:
I assume you mean Industrial Disco (or Industrial Dance) when you say
industrial.  I.D. usually has a very booming percussive attack and
growled/screamed vocals.  Think Skinny Puppy.  Industrial has very
little bearing on techno/

Techno:
This is the flavor of the month in dance clubs.  It's usually very
fast (125-140 bpm), very repetitive, and the better songs are
practically unlistenable outside of the dance floor environment.  The
kick drum is *always* four on the floor.  Think T.99 - Anasthasia (the
one with the opera sample playing three blind mice before it turns
into a huge festival of slamming beats and annoying opera samples).  4
Hero - "Mr Kirk's Nightmare" - really sounds lame until you put it
into a club setting, where the bass just feels like it's puncturing
your lungs.  The current trend in techno is to play a very simple
pattern of three or four notes using increasingly obnoxious sampled
sounds.  Screeches, screams, atonal mushes of noise - it's all fair
game as long as you play the same three or four note pattern that
everyone else uses.  I wish we had multimedia email - if you could
hear one bar, you'd know exactly what I'm talking about.

House:
There are so many different flavors of house that it's practically
meaningless to speak of "house music" anymore.  At the Woopy Ball they
advertised a "deep house" room which sounded basically like pop/soul
music with a more techno influence in the backing tracks.  Imagine
taking a Mariah Carey hit single and making the backing tracks more
technoid.

	I've revised the calendar of upcoming events, and I'll post it at the
end of this post. Someone mentioned that the phone number for Freedom was
wrong, so I changed it to the phone number for the Edge, which is where it'll
be (supposedly). I only transcribe the info I'm given.....

	Kinda coincidental - right now I have Radioactive Goldfish's "LSD
Is the Bomb" in the background, and the lyric could easily and justifiably
be changed to "Lunacy was a bomb". The live bands went on FAR too long for
myself and the 4 other people I went with who had never been to a "rave"
before (I had to keep telling them, this isn't a rave, not even close), the
drugs were MUCH more prevalent than at other events I've been to, and the
music upstairs, after they fixed the fuse they blew, was cheesy rap/KMEL house,
except for a span of about 15 minutes of good old acid-house. No techno to
be found anywhere. Was Scott Hardkiss there? I thought he was more of a rave
DJ than any of the music played there. No smart bar (so I didn't know where to 
meet you, ovid! %( ), except for a stand upstairs that was selling fruit
juices for $2 a glass for about half an hour. Ugh. The brain tuning tapes were
kinda neat, but they were shoved off into a far corner of the house. I think
one of my friends said it best when he said this wasn't a rave, it was a
co-op party (the co-ops here in Berkeley put on parties, and usually they're
boring, really smoky, trash all over the floor, and a mediocre to good band
playing in the living room...) Except here the music horrid. Well, not bad
if you like 70's funk, but nothing like what I WANTED to hear. $5 and a 
Friday night gone. Shoulda gone to Sharon.....

	I'm going home to LA this Thursday for Spring Break; I'll still have
net access down there (a friend at Caltech has almost 50 accounts. 50!!!),
so I'll be able to handle all the administrative stuff. I'm going to the
radioactivity rave down there, with N-Joi and Radioactive Goldfish and 
Human Resource playing. Should be cool, especially if the bands are as good
as N-Joi is on their "Live in Manchester" disc. I'll post a review.

OK, this is in many parts now, but here's the directions:


>From 101, take the University Ave. exit. Go straight on University for
a long time which will turn into Palm Drive as you enter campus.
Turn left on Campus Drive. This is where it gets fuzzy. Follow Campus
around watching for when you cross Mayfield Ave. This is the last real
cross street before EBF. EBF is the 4th dorm/house on the right handside
of Campus Drive. If you get to an intersection with traffic light, you've
gone a little too far.

>From 280, take the Alpine Rd. exit. Follow it for a while. Turn right on
Junipero Serra Blvd. The second traffic light after that is Campus Drive
East. Turn left there. EBF is the second dorm/house on the left. If you
get to a stop sign, you've gone too far.

If you get lost on campus, your best bet is to stop at one of the you
are here maps at the entrances to campus.

see ya there,

Subject: 18+ raves this weekend?


Hey club kids!  I've got a friend in visiting this week from Boston and I want
to show him the rave scene, but he's under 21.  Are there any 18+ raves going
on this weekend?  Preferably in San Francisco and preferably gay or mixed, but
anything cool would be great!

By the way, I tried out a new rave on Saturdays at 177 Townsend last weekend
(like, March 7).  It's called Carefree and it's aimed at the gay crowd, but it
was still mixed.  The music was good (house, acid jazz, some techno), but the
crowd never reached critical mass.  There was a lot of other stuff going on
that night, so I think the core SF rave crowd was spread pretty thin.  It's
being put on by some of the Toon Town kids and they're trying to keep it
underground to keep away the bridge and tunnel crowd.  (Bridge and Tunnel
Crowd:  noun.  1. members of suburban gangs and women with big hair who hear
about cool "in" clubs, descend upon them like the plague, and ruin it for
everyone else  2. the reason DV8 had to install a metal detector and hire
Cro-Magnon bouncers with no necks a few years ago  3. Toon Town on Friday
nights lately.)  I'll probably try it again this week or next and let y'all
know how it is progressing.

P.S.  Anyone know where the full moon rave is this week?

I was wondering that myself.  I went to Care Free (weekly thing at Townsend
on Saturday nights, put on by the Toon Town people).  I was disappointed
for two reasons: 1) The music was way lame -- very generic rave stuff with
no character whatsoever, and 2) The crowd was very small and wasn't really
into it.  Maybe this has to do with the lameness of the music.  I definitely
didn't recognize any of the usual hardcore ravers there, though -- the ones
that really get into the music and are on the dancefloor almost non-stop.
The one saving grace was the chill-out room, which was pretty cool.

Quite often I found myself thinking that I should leave and go to Sharon
Finds Destiny in Santa Clara, but I wasn't in driving condition, and the
drive would have been an hour long, so I reluctantly stayed at Care Free.

A friend of mine who went to Sharon Finds Destiny told me about it, though.
The music was good, but there was a fight, and one of my friends (a very 
peaceful person) got beat up pretty bad.  Lame.

The only recent AON stuff I've seen was on the Tekknophobia disc (see prior

On another note, I will also start giving capsule reviews of more singles/EPs
and Megamixes.  I have a couple that are good.

These are all getting compiled, BTW, for a 'zine I'll start distributing.  The
name I've got for it at this point is ROCC (Rave Over Chaos Culture).  Anyone
that is interested in submitting reviews, articles, interviews, let me know.
I will be distributing it via Email, from anon ftp at chsun1.uchicago.edu and
from several South Florida BBSes.  I will also make it FREQable on Fidonet
from my node (1:369/72).

Any comments, suggestions, or submission should be sent to brian@daccess.com
or to 1:369/72 (Fidonet), 50:5305/72 (Echonet).

ps - if you have "handles" or whatnot, let me know what they are, I will use

Some ravers posting here seem to think that the scene is somehow diminished
by "outsiders" -- tunnel and bridgers, Joe Lawyer and Jane Realestate -- who
come to raves.  I can't see it.  Isn't the scene inclusive enough to make
room for anyone who gets into the spirit? At least they're paying their $
and moving their bodies. If there were some communal commitment to an ideal -- "all you need is love," "turn on, tune in, drop out," -- anything! -- that
bound all ravers into a coherent community, I could understand the resentment
at being invaded by outsiders. But at this point, raving seems to be just a
name for going to goodtimes public oparties and dancing the night away stoned.
Or does someone else out there feel otherwise?

something tells me there's gonna be alot of replies to this one...

As I see it, the more people who come to raves and "get into the 
spirit", the better.  By getting into the spirit,  I mean
yes, moving their bodies, opening up to sensory overload, looking
people in the eye for a few milliseconds longer than usual, talking
to strangers regardless of gender, not scamming on women (fellas)
or acting too much like "I am a babe" (ladieez); in a word, treating
people the way we should treat each other anyway.  And btw, arthurc,
 "all you need
is love" is a great starting point!  The trouble with so-called
outsiders, and who among us was an outsider a few months ago?, isn't
new-ness, it's stoopid nightclub behavior, it's what rox referred
to as guys in shirts and ties standing around with their arms folded,
its' people all dressed up with no idea that they're supposed to not
be at the mall, it's alcohol behavior, it's even getting to be fights, too.
If the scene grows to fast it chokes on un-acculturated newcomers who
dilute it (8.0, anyone?).  If the scene doesn't grow, it dies.  If it
gets too exclusive, we're back to the doorman with the velvet rope
doing a coolness check, and I'm outta here.  I really hate the term
"birdge & tunnel people", it's a pretentious imported New York-ism, and
suggests that your address can somehow compensate for a shitty attitude.
Oh well, Social evolution is as bloody as the biological kind, I guess.

FLoating parties, little or no alcohol (all ages please!), 
publicity only via e-mail, cards, word of mouth, all help.  
Radio ads on live 105 don't.

Keep it entact!

Not if they're packing loaded weapons, and out to shoot eachother.  The
Palladium was playing quite a lot of house about 2 yrs ago, and there
was quite a bridge crowd.  They thought, "hey, this is really cool.  We're
pack all the time!"  until the gangs started to show up and they had one
month with two stabbings and a shooting.  That's when they decided to stick
to top 40/Live 105 type stuff.  As a consiquence, the Underground, at 9th
and Howard became a lot more popular.  No house music, but they did play
good alternative, and they were open 9 to 9.  Sadly the bar is now gone,
and nothing has sprung up to take it's place.

You haven't been reading too carefully.  I don't think anyone has said that
there's no room for outsiders.  It's just that raves are getting too big --
too many people in not enough space.  And a hell of a lot of the people are
the poseur club crowd who go out to look cool and to get drunk and to try to
get laid.  The term "bridge-and-tunnel" refers more to that outsider poseurish
attitude than to where a person actually lives.

Bob,
I totally agree with everything you said. I've been trying put into words
what is happening and have hit upon it piecemeal. You have said it all in a
nutshell. I've never liked going to clubs because of the alcohol/meat
market factor and thought I had found the perfect thing in going to raves,
where it's more like a private party but on a larger scale. It seems like
it started changing after this past New Year's ToonTown and all the
publicity. You're right about how we need to have more raves that are found
out about strictly by word-of-mouth (Email, cards, etc.).

I don't have it on tape but I did watch it.  As it dealt with raves, I
suppose it's worth posting a brief synopsis.  If you're not
interested, bail out now...


Brandon's girlfriend from San Francisco wants to go to an underground
party.  She's got a flyer from a rave called Egg.  You have to bring
an egg to a convenience store to get directions to the party.  So,
they get to the rave, and the girl (whose name I am really spacing on)
buys four hits of Euphoria.  She offers one to Brandon but he says
he's a good boy and doesn't do drugs.  So, she slips a hit in his
drink.  He starts digging it and acting really goofy.

Eventually, the people Brandon came with get bored and leave him and
his girlfriend.  Then the cops come to raid the party.  Fortunately,
Brandon's *other* friends who were looking for the party find it just
at this juncture and take Brandon and his girlfriend home.  Of course,
Brandon has to leave his swank car at the warehouse.

The next day, Brandon has a terrible headache (yeah right) and finding
his car stripped and vandalized doesn't make it any better.  He breaks
up with his girlfriend because she forced him to do drugs against his
will.  In the next episode, she tries to set fire to herself because
she's so grief-stricken at having lost Brandon.

The end.  Jason Priestly appears out of character to deliver an
anti-drug message and shows an 800 number for ratting on your friends
if you suspect they are having problems with drugs.  Lovely.

Overall, it was pretty dumb.  They didn't touch on any of the
important aspects of the rave culture, but who really expected them
to?  For one thing, the only way to really appreciate it is to
actually go to one with an open mind and good solid dancing shoes!

The little sermon at the end really bothered me as well, but that's
par for the course in Our Fascist Country.  Yee haw.

Good article in general.  I just want to play devil's advocate
for a minute though.  I have sympathy for the organizers: they spend a
lot of cash and they want people to come and have a good time, so they
need to advertise.  I have sympathy for the poor unfortunates out
there who are looking for a magic experience like a rave but have
nobody like us to tell them about it.  Radio ads on Live 105 reach a
lot of people, and that's good for the organizer's wallets (and the
prospects of them putting on future raves in even bigger warehouses
with more lights, lasers and PA wattage).  Meanwhile the poor shnooks
out there looking for a community like this one hear about it and
decide to give it a whirl.  They love it and they add to the general
level of background happiness.

Well, that's the scenario in a perfect world.  Unfortunately, it
doesn't seem to work that way in ours.  Jerks show up, the places get
too crowded, and what was once exciting, somewhat unique, and special
becomes boring and a pain.

Where can you draw the line?  When does advertising become a hindrance
rather than a help?

I have no answers, and I don't really think advertising on Live 105 is
a great idea, but that's just me being a snob.  Hell, I've got MY net
access and *I* know where to go to get flyers and what have you.  But
what if I didn't have the right friends and the right job?  What then?

Guess I'd just have to lump it.

Subject: Matrix question / tonight's full moon rave


	I believe Matrix the cat will be all ages - I think it'll be
at the Jack London Club, which isn't so much a club as just a _place_..
(you'd have to see it to understand). I;ve gone there twice, and I'm
18 (March 30th, everyone!! :), so there shouldn't be a problem. 
Call the number - if it's 21+ they'll tell you. Also, Lunacy was 
billed as being 21+, but they let me in (they should have kept me
out - like I said, it wasn't good at all)....

	Anyways, I've been debating about whether I should tell the
list about this, but since a few people have hinted about this, and 
because I don't see it as too much of a problem anymore, here's the
deal. Every month, on the night of a full moon (actually the night before
the day a calendar lists a full moon), there's a free rave on a beach
somewhere in the peninsula area. The trick is, the publicity is
entirely word of mouth - no flyers, no rave hotline, nothing. People
hear about these things from their friends, and they tell their
friends.... I happened to hear about it third party, and I asked a 
guy selling house tapes on Telegraph here in Berkeley if he had heard
of them, and he's pretty close to the DJ's who spin there, Garth and
Jeno. Last month was the first one I went to, and it was a LOT of fun.
A very simple setup - a small generator powering a single amp and two
PA speakers, a mixing table of course, a single strobe light, and one
of those oil-and-water projectors. The music didn't start until 1AM,
and by 2:30 or so about 300 people had showed up. I stayed till 5, and
most of the others were still there when I left. The music wasn't the
slamming over-the-top epic techno, which is more suited to hugte cavernous
warehouses in the center of a city, but was bouncier and housier;
still lots of fun to dance to. More like Genacide II's "Narra Mine"
than LA Style's JBID. . Best part is, it's free, and it's obvious
that evryone involved is just doing it out of a love for the music and
the people. You also don't get the "bridge and tunnel crowd" that
has been polluting ToonTown recently. ONly for the headstrong, as the
song says.... Anyways, they only announce where it's going to be
at about 7PM - I don't know when it's going to get to me, but the _minute_
I find out I'll post it to the list. I know a lot of people don't have
net access after they go home at night, and regretfully there's
nothing I can do about it. I'd set up my phone line with an answering
machine as an info node, but if I use my modem to access the net, there'd
be a problem there (not to mention keeping my roommate up all night :)
I was debating before whether to post info about this because I didn't
think the organizers want this to get very big; but after realizing that 
only about 10% of the people who hear about this (all 136 of you :) will
probably end up actually going, it shouldn't be a problem. Besides,
I wouldn't want to be kept in the dark about something this cool. Call
me the anti-snob.....
	Anyways, I should find out about it before 9PM, and I'll post
info to the net as soon as it's available. I'm so glad it's tonight
and not tomorrow night, seeing as how I have a Physics midterm and
a CS quiz on Thursday....
	Sorry about the megapost. See you all there! I'll be the one in
the green military jacket, jeans, and either white-and-flourescent
colored shirt or a blue tye-dye shirt. 5'10" with Blonde hair. Non-smoker. Likes

I live over the bridge.  Does that mean I suck? :-)    

Here's a good rule of thumb: If you hear an ad for a rave on Live 105, don't go.
If you see it in Datebook, or on a banner being pulled by an airplane, don't go.

Word of mouth or your local dance record store would seem to be the place to get
info.

By the way, for those who went, what was the crowd like at Sharon Meets Destiny?
I went to a couple Sharon raves in late '91 and they seemed to foot the bill
for the type of rave that most of the posting people would like to go to. 
The Gathering at the Stone did too.  Are these more or less above ground now?

Subject: The Attitude vs. Advertising


In response to a few really good posts - I must give my two cents.

I've been contemplating starting the total word of mouth / flyer oriented
raves here in Miami.  Currently, there are a couple "clubs" putting on rave
nights, but it doesn't really wash.  One, called Beyond Therapy, is an 18+
club disco hell, with an occasional techno-hit thrown in.  Not a zonefest
by any means.  Not even popsicles.

The second, called Energy, is closer, but still has alot of "hate" to it,
albeit the "housers" or gang types that just come in and taunt the ppl
flailing around in their MDA/LSD/THC induced states.  I dont like that at
all.  Although they have a huge laser array that was even better than the 
array they used that the Primus/Rush concert...that was huge.

Anyways - I've been thinking of having a "listening party" - start it off
as 20 friends or so, coming over, getting "enhanced" or whatnot, and break
out with a ton of Cyalume sticks, lava lamps, black lights, The Lyte (yes,
I bought one from Sharper Image - it is kool hooked into a NTSC vid signal),
and play really kool music for them.  Not even always "DJ" the music, but
create an environment.

there is also a place down here one can rent a Moonwalk.  It would fit in
this airport hanger I found, and that would be a fun thing to do as well.
Not high cost - just have everyone chip in basically.  That is my main
thrust for the start of it (minus the moonwalk, i got on a tangent) - get
a few core individuals into it, they tell a few of their friends, interest
is generated, you move to a bigger spot, get a few more toys - but all the
while, MEET everyone that walks in.  Someday, it could be a couple hundred
of your closest friends.

Or a couple thousand.

Or if it anything in my life works the way I'd like it to - the world.

The ToonTown thing seems to have gone downhill considerably.  The
best people seem to have moved on, from what I saw last Friday night.
The happening thing I found was the Rhythm Society benefit rave for
Barbara Imhoff (to repair one of her exquisite harps) at the
PM/AM (Trockadero) Club at 4th and Bryant. Maruga opened the evening with
his Nada Drum and Vince on a one-stringed instrument, then Vox Humana
joined them and filled the hall with voices.  Barbara Imhoff played
harp with voice accompaniment, then Tasti Box took the stage to lead
into the house music phase of the evening.  Though the audience was
small, they were most appreciative of the live sound.  Really special.
The acoustic drumming, voices, and harp added a real nice dimension
to the syncopated drum machine house music.  Looks like we're getting
back to the roots of music.  The house music that followed was
quite good.  Preston (formerly of ToonTown) and Brian Hughes 
(evangelist of Virtual reality, and head of the Renaissance Group)
are doing a great job of keeping the content and production level
at a premium level in my opinion.  Nice visuals too.

If you're going to have a benefit, don't you want the audience to be large?
If I was throowing a benefit, I would promote the hell out of it.  Flyers
are cheap.  I can't imagine they raised too much money.

I was there.  The show was good, but for the life of me I can't figure out
why they didn't try to get more people to come.

I had the same dilemma.  It's probably better to keep this strictly "word
of mouth" rather than "word of computer screen".  If for no other reason,
out of respect for the original concept, lest it turn into the next ToonTown.

Subject: techno reviews


Thanks to Brian and whomever else has been involved in the creation of
the sfraves mailing list.  It has provided an excellent forum for the
discussion of the rave "atmosphere" and for the dissemination of rave
information.

I want use this post to introduce myself (Hi! I'm Paul.  I used to spin a
mix of house, modern and techno at clubs in DC, now I'm not studying for
my winter quarter finals) and ask if there was group interest in discussing
music, reviewing the latest imports, etc.

To start things off, here are my current favorite techno tracks in no
particular order:  "Twilight Zone" by 2 Unlimited, "The Milkyway" by
2 Fabiola, a white label called by Digital Domain on Rabbit City Records
(132 bpm, heavy samples from Clivilles and Cole's "No Deeper Love", pretty
wicked), Capella "Take Me Away" (yes, I know that it is over 3 months old
now), and the Twitch classics by the Hypnotist and 4-Hero.

Bonus review:  Gridlock 4 from Seismic Sound (used to be Razormaid).
I just got my copy in the mail yesterday. If you thought that my list of
favorites was old and tired then you should definitely skip this issue.
Don't get me wrong, I love the work that Joseph and Chris have done.  The
edits are great.  I just wish that they had released it last fall.  The
most interesting tracks are:
    
    Capella "Everybody"   it's classic but their treatment is nice.  lots of
        fun samples dropped in.  if u don't have it, this is the mix to get.

    2 Unlimited "Get Ready for This"   they take parts of the 800 mix and
        add it to the orchestral mix. there is a bit of new production,
        but, overall, a good dj should have been using 2 copies of this
        to create a better structure back in October.

    Anticappella "2, 231"   not bad. they combine a techno mix from the
        domestic 12" with a house mix for good result.  but...

    Army of Lovers "Crucified"   the best mix available, but the song
        is almost a year old.  their version has the flavor of the white
        label '92 techno remix, but it it 123 bpm instead of 130 and it ends
        with the original vocal.  again, great work, but...
     
     Paris Red "Good Friends"   my favorite cut.  if your not familiar
         with the song, it basically house but the melodic vocals make
          it very accessible.  this remix has great energy.

The three other titles are by Deputies of Love (tough to describe, sort of 
hip-house, utterly forgettable), Zouk Machine (euro-disco, sung in French), 
and, surprisingly, Jessie Lee Davis (they give Get Up on This a '92 techno 
remix that has to be heard to be believed).

Anyway, hope that someone enjoyed this.

	This one was about twice as big as the last one, and just as fun. The
location was one of the best locations I've ever been to for a rave, a nice
secluded cove not far from SF facing the Pacific, far away from the highway
but not too much trouble to get to. I arrived around 12:15, and they were
still setting up the system, so the 75 or so people who were there started
building fires to keep warm. More and more people came - around 1 they got
the music starting, and warmed the crowd up with bouncy house until 
around 2, when the hard stuff kicked in. The DJ (who was he? The one from
the beginning until around 4) even delved into some classic '89 acid. I
thought I was listening to my Razormaid Acid Medleys disc! About 500 people
showed up, I would estimate, twice as many as last time. Around one they set
up some film loops projecting onto a side of a nearby cliff. Then around
4 the cops came down, shut the music off, and told everyone they were going
to start towing cars that were parked on the highway (most of us) or in the
parking lot. I left then, since my car was relatively close to where they
had parked the police cars, so I figured it would be one of the first to
go. Going back up I talked to one of the "pigs", actually he was quite polite,
and he said they had a permit to do this, but it was only valid during 
daylight hours, not at night, when the state park was closed. He also said
they were going to be towing since they figured there'd be a traffic jam in
the morning. Oh, they turned the music back on after the announcement, so I
don't know how many braved it out until the 'morn....
	Only problems - how many paid? We were one of the first groups there,
so we had to each pay the $5 "obligatory donation", as well as sign a waiver
or something (so of course I didn't use my real name :) What was all that
about?
	So how many from the list actually ended up going? I didn't 
recognize anyone from the desciptions they gave. We'll just hafta carpool
next time....

Hi Yolks,

I have been having lots fun reading the heated discussions surrounding
the SF rave scene.  Unfortunately, this is a somewhat vicarious interest
since I am recently migrated from SF to Austin, where the music scene is
flourishing, but it definitely 'aint House.  So, until we generate a
Hous scene (plans a'foot with other SF->Austin ravers), can anyone
recommend a good mail-order source of House tapes (Deep & Techno preferred)?

Scusez moi for corrupting the intent of 'sfraves'.

As a former Texan, I feel morally obliged to help you out. Call Ameba, a store
on Haight Street in San Francisco (tel.415-750-9368) or send them snail mail at 1732 Haight Street, S.F. My favorite house tape there is Jeno's *House Reality.*In fact, any mix by Jeno is good stuff.
Beliece it or not, even some of the chain stores carry decent techno. I got an 808 State tape at Tower Records! You'll just have to spend the time figuring out where they stash it (on store in Berkeley puts techno in with soul!)>

I'm not sure if this list can stand any more traffic, and I think that most
people on this list are more interested in going to raves than actually buying
the records.  For discussion of rave music, try subscribing to the DJ mailing

This is easily the best techno-acid track I have heard in a long time.

Well, Gridlock 4 was better than Gridlock 2 and 3, but that's not saying much.
Cycle 3 Sector 1, Gridlock 1 and Anniversary 6.5 were all great, but everything
Razormaid / Seismic Sound has released since then has been very sub-standard.

what da ya mean yua didn't see me at the full moon rave. i was on the dance
floor (umm, sandy dance floor) the whole time. it was absolutely incredible. i
drove for almost 2 hours to get there, arrived around 1:30 or so. ran into a 
lot of people that i knew, but alas, no one from the net.

the cops told me they were going to start towing at 4am, but then when the music
was shut off they said as long as there is no ticket on your car it won't be 
towed. i went up and checked (man, those were some serious stairs) , no ticket,
so i stayed until dawn. the strobes looked loke northern lights reflecting off
the ocean.

some people were camping and they said they beach was rented until midnight the
next day, did anyone stay? one other thing, i found the environment much better
than any of the raves that i've been to recently, you could really see wheree

Yeah, I went to the full moon party, and I'd give it the "Way Rulin'"
stamp of approval.  We got there at around 1-1:30, and paid the $5 and
ignored the "sign in" area, so I don't know what the deal was.  The
number of people there was amazing, given the time, location, and day
of the week; I didn't really expect to recognize anyone from the net
in the crowd in the dark, though.  A good crowd, too, not just a
good-sized crowd.  We were going to leave at around 5, but our car was
parked in.  We hung out for a little while by our car and didn't see
any tow trucks; it would have been pretty hard get enough tow truck
drivers to tow hundreds (or even a couple) of cars at 4 in the morning
all the way to where ever they would take them.  Anyway, since we were
parked in, we were pretty safe :-), and we ended up staying till 6:30
or so, along with probably more than half of the original people.

One of the people I went with had been to one of these last year at
Baker Beach in the city, and he said that at one point the cops came
to stop the party and tell people they couldn't park at the beach 
parking lot, but then they kind of hinted that if everyone parked up on
the streets, they wouldn't do anything, so people moved their cars
and kept partying.  So I guess there are some cool cops.

Yes, Seattle does have a sporadic rave scene, and anyone in the Seattle
area on the 21st of March has a chance of attending the Cat in the Hat
Strikes Back, featuring two music rooms, each with their own environment
(techno or funk/disco), according to the rather attractive flyer/invite
I got the other day.  They also promise a smart bar and a host of other
ravishiments.  The downside is that the invites are kinda scarce, and
these people are kind of strict on admission without invites.

Hmmm...I don't have the flyer with me here, but I'll post later with
the phone number for the location and info.

Stay tuned.

That was Garth.  Consistantly one of the best.  Watch for him at
Equinox this weekend (along with Jeno and Thomas).

We were gone before 3, but a friend of mine showed up after sunrise,
and said it was going full guns, with Marky Mark spinning.

I don't understand the bit about the "state park" being closed;
this was held at a private beach.  I guess ultimately that's why
it kept going.

The equinox was held at a south san francisco wherehouse on caroll.  We 
arrived and josh was spinning some fierce music.  He was outstanding.  The
location was ideal.  The heart of the industrial district.  Packed with
people.  Shaking from the sound system.

The crowd kept building as josh kept mixing.  Unfortunately, it was raining
so the roof vents remained closed.  Needless to say, it was quite warm
inside.  Jeno was up next.  He started out OK, but he never really seemed
to hit his stride.  Music choice was a little off.

At 5am, though, Thomas was up.  With a possessed look in his eye, he brought 
the shrinking crowd back to life.  People seemed to come out of no where.
We left around 6 and the party was still going strong.

THe bottom line: a trendous rave.  Ideal crowd (though maybe a little young).
Hot tunes from tonka sound, and a great location (even though the roof 
leaked and someone had to stand with an umbrella covering a turntable most
of the morning).  Don't miss their next production.

In-Reply-To: WRPYR:james@harry.apple.com's message of 03-20-92 12:37

hi james - thanks for the note.  the rhythm society is a loosely structured
group of people with a philosophy mainly of "fun" - infinite play, hedonic
engineering, global community.

we have observed that the best raves seem to be remarkably fun.  the atmosphere
appears to have a lot of community and very little judgement or "attitude".  we
wondered what one would be like if there were also an environment (or time)
when one could more easily meet fellow partiers, and what it would be like if
dancing to house were not the only activity.

so we have undertaken to enrich the rave scene a bit.  we are working with
preston, producer of WAX (which when it started was called PM-AM) friday
nights at 520 fourth st. near bryant in SF.  the general format is some kind of
event earlier in the evening (9 or 10), followed by preston's party.  it takes
a little while to clear away the chairs, which provides some quiet(er) social
time before the party.

special events so far have been an evening with Timothy Leary on 06 march, and
the benefit for Barbara Imhoff (Maruga, Vox Humana, Tasti Box) on 13 march.
the next event is set for 17 april - an evening with Robert Anton Wilson.

events will happen at irregular intervals, depending on ideas, availabilty of
people or groups, and how well received the earlier events are.  we welcome
suggestions and comments.

somebody noted that the earlier events have not been especially well publicized
and i agree.  it's hard to get the word out to people who will enjoy and add to
the event, without making it seem too commercial.  sfraves is probably a good
way, for one.  do you have any ideas?

i'm cc'ing brian so he can include the 17 april rhythm society "An Evening
with Robert Anton Wilson" on the upcoming sfraves calendar.  a few other folks
have asked questions about the rhythm society, so we'll send out a note to the
list in a few days (i'll be out of town for a while).

Well, I'm not sure how much there is to say, but I'm in mail-spewing mode, so...

Equinox was definitely one of the better raves I've been to.  The crowd was
about the right size for the warehouse it was in.  The DJs were great.  Garth
and Thomas spun some pretty excellent sets, though I missed most of Jeno's set.
The crowd was really into the music.  No bad vibes.

I guess there isn't much to say besides "It's got a beat a good beat I can
dance to it I'll give it a 38."  (1 point off for not having Intellibeams,
and one point off for poor air circulation.)

hmmmmm.... actually, this rave kinda sucked...

But then again, I tend for the hardcore rave... not the whistle blowing 
crap... that's really annoying... I think that should be outlawed...

The first DJ, if you could call him that, had about 30 records and had 
never heard of Lords Of Acid... (bad sign)... I think there were 2 whole 
songs that I was able to dance to... the rest were sad, poor remixes 
(although they were played in time and mixed well), with stupid honkey 
tonk piano riffs and lame, unstructured, shallow beats...

Everyone was doing X, as well as the 10 year old girls... looked pretty 
lame.

The warehouse was too small and looked extremely unprofessional... as if 
some kids rented some junk from a radio shack and decided to put on a 
party...

my girlfriend ask Thor, the doorman if we could bring in beer, and he 
said "ungh-yea". Then we heard different from some other kid, os we 
decided to not deal with this complete communication breakdown and deal 
with it in our own way..,. :->

So at about 2:30, it was packed, but everyone, although dancing and under 
the "influence", looked bored and unsure of themselves.. . probably 
thinking what I was... "should of gone to oakland..."

Next weekend should prove better with the LUST show on the 28th at Jack 
London... Myk and XKP ALWAYS prove to be rude and intense... completely 
the opposite of this equi-bore

Yes, it should be Robert Anton Wilson, the author.  And yes, it should be
very interesting.  The Rhythm Society's first speaker was Dr. Timothy Leary a
few weeks ago and, while Dr. Leary seems to be getting a wee bit senile, it was
a fun talk.  They had some cool live video effects and passed his microphone
through an effects generator, adding depth or tinniness, echoes, pitch changes.
It all added up to an "experience"  -- a great way to kick off the rave.

The April 17th WAX should be even better with Wilson.  The earlier WAXes had a
definite lack of people, but I think the word-of-mouth machine is working and
they've been getting bigger crowds.  And of course, the coolest light effect --
the white laser -- is even drawing people in.  If you haven't seen it, go out
of your way to check it out!

Share and enjoy,

This was around 2:30 am.  Damn!!  What made it worst was I live in South City

the so called "bridge and tunnel crowd" but they only play straight techno   
music. They did have a smart bar and an ambience room downstairs.  

Also, did anyone get the Toontown flyer with the UFO.  Joey Beltram, Moby and

Subject: Saucer party and final Gathering.

 On April 11 (not April 4) the final Gathering will be held
 (Tony is moving to Sweden to be with his girlfriend and is looking
forward to spreading some good energy there...) It will be held right
next door to the saucer ToonTown - the first ToonTown event in two months..
(as opposed to 8.0 and Carefree) I for one am looking forward to both events !

BTW - I went to equinoxe on Sat/Sun too - and had the best time I have
had *indoors* (wink) in weeks... No complaints here -although I would
have also appreciated better ventilation. As a former lightshow artist
( I used to do a lot of liquid oil visual effects- like the seminal 
basement ambient lounge at Big Heart City last winter/spring) I was tremendously
impressed by the effective / INEXPENSIVE low rent visuals.. Proof again
that it's the spirit that is most important to a successful rave, and not
strictly $$$ spent. Lets hear it for Jeno and friends for throwing
a very successful event-

Subject: Utopia Project #3 a.k.a. Matrix (The Cat)

For all interested parties, Matrix was weak. Markie Mark (no "Y" in his name, lest he be confused with the other Mark) was a no show, for he was engaged elsewhere. The rave room was made smaller by the presence of a screen (cloth sheet?), and the music generally sucked. The bar had a DJ who played much harder (translation - I liked it) music, but now there was no place to go except outside to escape from the music. Upstairs was packed. This was the first Utopia I went to, and also the last (thankfully it is also Utopia's last event). The high-school aged crowd didn't help much either.

Subject: I was wrong!


	Yes, yes, it is Robert Anton Wilson, at the Rhythm Society/WAX event
on Friday, April 17th. Sorry about the confusion. Also, when's the ToonTown
"UFO" event? And will the rooftop location mean 18+?

	Sorry to hear that Matrix the Cat was so bad. We interviewed the
promoters on Techno Attack last Friday, and they said they were going to
do things a little bit differently this time. They also said it was not
actually the third in the Utopia trilogy, but a "break" in the procession.
Also I've found that most techno DJ's start out the night with bouncy,
light soul, to get the people moving and warm, and then progress into harder
stuff around 2 or 3 AM. After that each DJ has his own style, either
fluctuating back and forth between the two or going over the edge for
hours. Garth does this at all the Full Moon Raves I've been to. Maybe
the DJ's at Matrix started out too bouncy or stayed too bouncy for too
long.....

	Finally, I was wondering what are the best stores around here for
techno/acid/etc. dance music. I've been to Record Rack, which I find low
on selection and high on price, Butch Wax (same thing), and Star Records,
which is actually rather decent. None of them have been as good as DMC
or Prime CUts down here, but I figure that's just a function of me not
trying as hard as I should to find 'em around SF and the Bay Area. Actually,
Leopold's in Berkeley has a really good vinyl selection, as well as decent
CD's, but you can't give them a spin before you buy (and NO ONE who works
there knows anything about the music). So... where to go? I'd like this
to be an open discussion, and I'll post synopsies of any private e-mail
I get. ("Prime Cuts down here" should read "Prime Cuts down in LA").

Kevin of the Utopia Project has used my business name on his flyers

I'm not surprised that Markie Mark was ano-show
 I wonder if he even had any arrangement with MM to play.

Hardcore... music that cuts with emotion and harsh sounds. Not pianos
with reverb and whistles blowing. Sounds that bring out adrenaline in
you, not the urge to 'blow' a whistle...

Not at this rave, that's for sure. Lords of Acid, although overplayed,
are way too intense for a rave like equinox...

Actually it was Vodka... but beer was the only thing Thor could understand.

If your at home in the weekend or you missed out on a rave, listen to
WILD 107 (a.k.a. KSOL 107.7) at FRI/SAT midnight.  They play live recordings
of raves.  Last week they played the Freedom Rave.  It's a cool station
because sometimes they will announce a rave but they will not tell you the
address because if you're a raver you will know where it is.  Also, one
of the D.J. didn't like the Freedom Rave because it was on the EDGE
nightclub (commercialism).  It's like having Bill Graham Presents promoting
a rave at the Warfield. They want the rave scene to stay underground.

BPM is a great record store for the try-before-buy policy and for consistently
having the latest stuff.  They also have a good selection of magazines
usually.  Star is good selection-wise, but they usually get the most
popular techno only.  BPM has a lot of obscure stuff.

The only gripe I have about BPM is limited shelf space.  By the time
I get there on the weekends, all the good stuff is usually sold out!

Star usually has a play copy of all the stuff in their new section, so you
can theoretically hear the stuff before you buy, but if the record has a 
defect (like a record I bought with two holes punched off-center) you
don't know until you get home.  Then the "Import- No refunds/exchanges" policy
bites you.

What's Butch Wax like?

Wild 107 is very respectable on weekend nights where the mix show throws down

and is it even regularly scheduled?  I really missed "the Saturday night mix show"
on MARS fm down in LA, but the wild 107 weekends are a pretty good replacement.

Alright you guys, let's not dis other's drugs (or each other).
Besides, almost EVERYTHING has a time and a place.
This goes for whatever drug (Alcohol, X, etc.) happens
to be your drug(s) of choice (including being sober and
smart drugs - and yes they are almost the same thing).

Also, in defense of smart drugs I have to say:  Dont believe
the Hype!  Don't listen to anyone who tells you that you'll
feel a "high" from smart drugs or that anything incredible
will happen.  That's not what they're for.  Most smart drugs
are healthy for you, especialy the ones you find at raves
because they are just nutrients (usualy amino acids, etc.)
and the way they are thought to work can be likened to an
oil change for your car. You might not feel the results, but
the working parts of the car (brain) will run smoother.  
This is especialy good for people on drugs because it 
enhances some highs and replenishes spent energy/nutrients.
I do think it would be cool if they were cheaper.  They do
seem like a rip off and I don't usualy buy them.  If they
were cheaper we could all buy them as refreshments (I like
the taste) regardless of what they might or might not do. |-)

Equinox took place just north of Candlestick Park on Carrol Street off of
Third in one of those narrow roll-up door with one window type of places.
It was fun but it got VERY hot and stuffy and there was really no place to
go and chill out. Also the water situation was dismal until the crowd
thinned out a little as there was only one sink to get it from. Truly a
"warehouse" party! The music was really good and I didn't leave until it
was over.

Yes!  Hosh Gurelli and a few others (one of the Techno DJs for KMEL goes
to Davis, too!) spin on the radio on Saturday nights.  From 10pm-4am.  
However, I think from 10pm-2am is all hip-hop, and then from 2am-end
is all house/techno stuff.  Pretty cool.  I listen to that all the time!

Check out this months issue of M. (The one with the girl in the
VR suit in that new VR game hitting the malls now).

There is an enlightening story on Smart Drugs... And after talking
to many doctor friends of mine, it is confirmed. Smart Drugs are
useless and dangerous. The M story basically meant dangerous by
as seeing as the only thing in smart drugs that gives you any
kind of HIGH, is caffine. So you have a lot of energy and are wired,
simulating 'feeling smarter'... (We've all had deadlines and sucked
down mud to stay awake and got those caffine highs already...)

Anyways, as a result of this, the author felt better for a bit, and
over-excersized as a result as well as other things and in the long
run (2-3 weeks later), got full body cramps and felt like shit.

I only wish there was a perfect drug... one that wouldn't fuck up your
involentary muscle control, mind or body... WAIT! I'VE FOUND IT!

Instructions: 1. Stay awake for at least 24 hours
              2. Start auditory hallucinations soon afterwards
              3. Drink a chocoloate (or favorite flavor of your choice)
                 malt/shake
              4. Go to the most busiest club and go insane.
                
                You will have such an endorphine/opiate rush, you'll
                most likely freak... Opium folks... natural... within 
                you...

And if that doesn't work, eat at Dennys... (lennys)
