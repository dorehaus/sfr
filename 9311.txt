I havn't seen the media reports  (having just woken up now at 3 pm after
the best Come-Unity ever..!!)
but I think its important to catch something here before it gets out of
hand.GHB is not
a "natural substance" or "healthy".. It definitely is a drug..made in some
cases in peoples kitchens.
Maybye it has been sold at raves,but it isn't in any "smart drinks" that I
know of, and shouldnt be.
GHB is a useful substance for studying it's effects on dopamine
receptors,but in the laboratory,not on the dance floor. It just goes to
show that combining drugs is a dangerous game.
Just say "Know".

For all the recent flap, overall I do think things are looking pretty
good. I've always found it really nice that geography pretty much
dissapears on the internet. You could talk with someone for an hour
and not realize they were, say, in New Zealand. Or they might be right
next door. Many preconceptions dissolve and people are just people. I
think this will really help the "real world" situation.  I predict
that the internet, more than any other invention, will help
precipitate global community. And we're a part of that. Exciting time
to be alive, eh?

Keep it alive,

	communion and communicate their deepest thoughts in a twinkle
	of an eye with all who care to listen, a world where even the 
	most mundane thought is respected and viewpoints considered
	a world where the party never stops and the music blasts the sensate

	everybody now visualize that boundless communicative world

...this whole "east vs. mid vs. west" thing is so _completely_ getting 
away from the point of raving.

Raving; you know - overcoming the knee-jerk type reflexes that make for 
stiff, unpleasant, unyielding interactions with other people, and 
dropping into that graceful, appreciative, open warmth that radiates 
from a phat groovin' grin.

When you first meet someone, are you immediately identified as some 
regional outgrowth?  No.  They see you for who you are, hear your 
laughter, see the vibe flowing down your spine and out your pores.  
They can be complete strangers and still you share a moment of 
connection, a spark.  And out of these gatherings form a community of 
people who, no matter where they are, can get together and have a good time.

This all starts from _you_ as a person, no matter _where_ you are from 
or where you are.  Can we knock off knocking each other off and get 
back to the business at hand?  Namely, making the world a better place 
by making our lives better by making it work?

I don't mean to seem condescending and mean no offense to anyone.  But 
I'd hate to see the full rich diversity that characterizes the list 
undermined by this kind of illusory division.  Thanks for the $0.98 change.

people say to combine posts, so

GHB has been sold at raves and on the street , etc in LA
Urb had something on it a few issues ago
(just a quick uneducational note)
i dont remember someone else mention ing it, but ive gotten 100 letters today
so i might have missed it
but GHB reacts VERY differently to different people
that is, an amount that causes pretty neat effects for you
may not be noticeable to another person
but another will be unconscious shortly after taking it
(the most common negative side affect being the tendency to
just plain fall asleep (or pass out depending on def.))

ObCoasts

You know, when Sue first posted stuff, i thought she was beign quite bitchy
and ridiculous, but now, its easy to see what exactly her point
and what Laura's points are...
and quite frankly im really amazed that there is a scene in SF
i really dont understand people who get egoitistical about how
little egos they have
or how biased you are against people who arent (according to you)
as unbiased as you

AND STOP TELLING LAURA NOT TO LOG OFF TO SFRAVES
PERSONAL MAIL WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE ESPECIALLY IF SHES NOT ON
(WHICH WHEN I CHECKED SHE WASNT (or i cant use grep for shit which is likely)

all id really like to say is that i really hope that everyone who gave
sue such a nice welcome feels damn proud of themselves for acting
like the people who tell me to leave america when i say i support
the rights of lesbians gays and bisexuals
cuz thats exactly what you're doing

shit, socal-raves may not get much traffic, but you know...
id think id actually rather have no people talking

Status: 

Hello, SFRavers!  This is my first post in an eon, and as it usually is when
an old friend worms out of the woodwork, it's because I want something.

The end of the semester quickly approacheth, and I have no concrete idea for
a final project for Music 158, Musical Applications of Computers here at
Cal.  I thought if I may I might rake your collective brains for ideas or
germs of ideas.

This class mainly has made use of MAX, a graphic object-oriented language
for MIDI manipulation.  (If you don't know what this is, read on anyway).
THe project can be pretty much anything, but let me tell you what I have at
my disposal.  MAX is awfully good at ranmdom processes of various sorts.  I
will have a CD-Rom or 2 or 3 at my disposal, and from MAX I can start and
stop the CD at any point I desire, on the fly (no I can't make it go
backwards or at variable speeds, damn).  There are also neural nets
available which I could teach to do interesting things.  I'm hoping to have
something that one can play with as it runs and is somewhat user-friendly,
as opposed to something that you just hit "start" and it does something cool.
I could also build some sort of tool to be used by composers or programmers.
I don't have access in this class to sequencers, only synthesizers (though I
guess I would if someone lent me one!)

Some ideas I'm playing with are things that will generate interesting chords
that are somewhat but not totally random and are based on some input.  Or
something easily programmable that will play complex rhythms for you so you
know what they sound like.  Or something that will teach small children or
people with little musical knowledge a bit about music.

Well, this is getting long-winded, sorry if you've made it this far but
don't really care.  But if you've got an idea, or better yet you've often
said, "damn, I wish I had a computer that would do such-and-such for me,"
then I would appreciate the help (and maybe you'd get a toy out of it, free!)
So please email me, and do email me directly as if it goes just to sfraves
it might get lost (and besides the rest of SFRaves probably doesn't care).

Thanx a whole bunch!

one last thing before i unsub to this list... 

i find it very disheartening to read this aggressive flaming constantly. 
over the few months i've been on here, the discussion seems to get most
lively, & antagonistic, about issues that involve putting ideas/people 
down...which seems to me the exact opposite of what we're trying to achieve
through the community tied into raving. It's rather sad ,actually, that 
so much of this talk about open-mindedess and so on was merely words...
this latest coastal thing was the perfect example.

whatever happened to the peace-loving/free-thinking/music-loving rave           mentality? 

and BTW, i would 10 times more rather read personal mesgs on this list than 
these constant biased, prejudiced, hateful posts that seem to have become the
life of this list.

i hate to say i've been disillusioned about what really underlies about the 
rave scene here...but now that i've experienced it a lot more, i find that
bigotry & false pretenses are still very much alive.

i regret that i feel this way, and maybe after some time i'll grow optimistic
about the scene and the list again....but until then...i'm afraid that i have
better things to do than keep hitting delete...

peace, love, & community to all...

 The average attendence of the South Bay lunch in Greer Park for the

decided to quit posting the South Bay lunch reminder , until interest

 I wonder how many public flame wars are initated and aggravated by 
personal email ? I haven't said anything controversial enough to 
result in replies that have hurt my feelings to any significant
degree ( or else I'm good at ignoring or paraphrasing the rougher
comments ). However , it seems that others here have recent email
in reply to a public posting of theirs - email that in tone and
content were too "uncool" for a public posting. 

 Of course , I usually do private email in reply to a post, if in
that email I am critizing the poster . However , I try to avoid
using a tone or style that I would feel embarassed about using
in a public post. 

 A good trick to use - if you're determined to make a posting or
an email to someone that has critical content in it , try to imagine
that the person is in the same room with you , instead of some remote
source of email , whose only presence is represented by characters
on a screen or on a page. If you find that you still have couth
problems , try to imagine that person is in the same room as you , 
with a loaded and functional firearm in their hand.

        Gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) sold in health food stores has
   recently caused outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness,
   central-nervous-system (CNS) depression, and seizures (Morbid Mortal
   Weekly Rep, 39:861, Nov 30, 1990).
        THE DRUG - GHB is an endogenous substance produced by the
   metabolism of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid.  The
   metabolite is itself neuroactive, increasing dopamine levels in the
   brain and acting on the endogenous opioid system (M Mamelak, Neurosci
   Biobehav Rev, 13:187, 1989).
   3 OF 5.
        SOURCES - GHB has been used experimentally in the USA for
   treatment of narcolepsy because it can induce a normal pattern of
   rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM sleep.  GHB is sold in health
   food stoes in the USA, usually as the sodium salt in tablets or as a
   powder, with instructions to take 1 tablet or 1/2 tablet to three
   teaspoons of the powder dissolved in water at bedtime.  The amount of
   GHB contained in these preparations is not known.  Names for the drug
   have included Sodium Oxybate, Sodium Oxybutyrate, Gamma
   Hydroxybutyrate Sodium, Gamm-OH, 4-Hydroxy Butyrate, Gamma Hydrate,
   and Somatomax PM.  It is promoted (illegally) for sleep, weight
   control, and for euphoric and anabolic effects.  GHB has been sold
   particularly to bodybuilders with the claim that stimulates growth
   hormone release.
   4 OF 5.
        CLINICAL EFFECTS - An oral dose of 10 mg/kg can cause amnesia
   and hypotonia; 20 to 30 mg/kg of GHB can produce somnolence within 15
   minutes.  Taking more than 50 mg/kg can result in abrupt
   unconsciousness and coma.  Patients who have taken 1/2 to 3 teaspoons
   have had symptoms varying from nausea, vomiting, dizziness,
   confusion, and drowsiness to depressed respiration and seizure-like
   activity.  Some patients have developed bradycardia and hypotension.
   No deaths have been reported.  Signs and symptoms subsided
   spontaneously within eight hours in most patients, although some
   complained of dizziness for as long as two weeks.  GHB apparently
   acts synergistically with alcohol to produce CNS and respiratory
   depression.  Naloxone (Narcan; and others) has not been effective as
   an antidote.
   5 OF 5.
        CONCLUSION - Gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) sold in health food
   stores as an aid to sleep and bodybuilding has caused severe illness,
   including seizures and coma.  No specific treatment is available, but
   all patients so far have recovered spontaneously.

        On August 7, 1990, the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Poison
   Control Center notified the regional office of the Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) and the California Department of Health Services
   of acute poisonings attributed to ingestion of gamma hydroxy butyrate
   (GHB), which recently has been illicitly marketed nationwide.
   Manifestations included gastrointestinal symptoms, central nervous
   system (CNS) and respiratory depression, and uncontrolled movements.
   Subsequent surveillance, based on contacts among poison-control
   centers, led to the recognition that similar poisonings had been
   independently identified in several states.  This report summarizes
   findings from the preliminary investigation of this problem.
   2 OF 12.
        From June 4 through November 28, 1990, at least 57 cases of
   illness attributed to GHB exposure have been reported from California
   (25 cases, 17 from the San Francisco area); Georgia (15, all from the
   greater Atlanta area); Florida (seven, six from the greater Tampa
   area); South Carolina (three); Minnesota (two); Arizona (two); and
   Ohio, Texas, and Virginia (one each).  Patients have presented with
   histories of ingesting 1/2 -3 teaspoons of GHB dissolved in water;
   ingestion is followed within 15-60 minutes by onset of one or more of
   the following: vomiting, drowsiness, hypnagogic state, hypotonia,
   and/or vertigo.  Loss of consciousness, irregular and depressed
   respiration, tremors, or myoclonus may follow.  Seizure-like
   activity, bradycardia, hypotension, and/or respiratory arrest have
   also been reported.  Spontaneous resolution occurs in 2-96 hours.
   The severity and duration of symptoms appear to depend on the dose of
   GHB and/or the presence of other CNS depressants, most frequently
   ethanol.  In 11 of 12 Georgia patients, four of five Florida
   patients, and three of four California patients for whom concurrent
   drug status was known, other psychoactive drugs--including ethanol,
   benzodiazepines, cannabis, and amphetamines--also had been used.
   3 OF 12.
        Although no deaths have been reported, most patients have
   required emergency room care; at least 11 were hospitalized, and nine
   required ventilator support or other intensive care.  Therapeutic
   efforts consisted of nonspecific supportive care.
   4 OF 12.
        On November 8, FDA issued an advisory warning that GHB use
   outside of FDA-approved physician-supervised protocols was unsafe and
   illicit and should stop *RF 1 *.  Persons who have used GHB and have
   symptoms should consult a physician.  Ill persons, physicians, and
   emergency room staff are encouraged to report suspected cases of
   GHB-related illness to their regional poison-control centers and
   state health departments.  FDA's investigation into the source(s) of
   this illicit distribution is ongoing.  Sale of GHB was banned by
   California on November 8 and by Florida on November 9.

   exemptions for investigational research protocols (e.g., treatment of
   narcolepsy).  In Europe, GHB has also been used as an anesthetic
   adjunct and experimentally to treat posthypoxic cerebral edema and
   ethanol withdrawal.  During controlled clinical use, the same dose of
   GHB sometimes caused different responses in different patients and
   different responses in the same person at different times (M.
   Mamelak, personal communication, 1990).
        GHB has been illegally marketed under a variety of names,
   including Gamma Hydroxybutyric Acid, Sodium Oxybate, Sodium
   Oxybutyrate, Gamma Hydroxybutyrate Sodium, Gamma-OH, 4-Hydroxy
   Butyrate, Gamma Hydrate, and Somatomax PM.  It is distributed as the
   sodium salt in powder or tablet form and is commonly dissolved in
   water.
   8 OF 12.
        GHB has been marketed illicitly to body builders since at least
   May 1990; it also has been promoted illicitly for weight control and
   as a sleep aid.  In addition, GHB has been illicitly touted as a
   "replacement" for L-tryptophan, which had been marketed as a food
   supplement but was recalled in November 1989 when the epidemic of
   eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was recognized *RF 2 *.
   9 OF 12.
        GHB allegedly produces a "high," which has led to its further
   use as an illicit drug.  Although the concurrent use of other drugs
   with similar toxicities may confuse the clinical, toxicologic, and
   epidemiologic presentation of this problem, the reported symptoms of
   GHB toxicity are the same as the known pharmacologic effects of the
   drug.  A causal association between use of GHB and these poisonings
   is also supported by the rapid onset of symptoms after ingestion of
   GHB, more severe and prolonged symptoms associated with larger doses
   of GHB, and occurrence of illness in persons who have not used other
   drugs.
   10 OF 12.
        GHB is produced by the body as a normal metabolite and is not a
   nutritional requirement.  In the brain, GHB increases dopamine
   levels, has effects through the endogenous opioid system, and
   probably has effects through other independent receptor-dependent
   mechanisms.  GHB is present in many peripheral sites, including the
   kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, and brown fat.  GHB is well absorbed
   orally, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is subsequently
   metabolized to carbon dioxide and water without active metabolites
   *RF 3,4 *.  Effects include amnesia and hypotonia from doses as low
   as 10 mg/kg, a normal sequence of REM and non-REM sleep from 20-30
   mg/kg doses (1-3 g per dose were used in U. S. narcolepsy studies *RF
   5 *), and anesthesia from doses of approximately 50 mg/kg.  In doses
   greater than 50 mg/kg, GHB decreases cardiac output and subsequently
   produces increasingly severe respiratory depression, seizure-like
   activity, and/or coma *RF 4,5 *.  Other effects suggest that, during
   hypoxia and other energy-limiting conditions, GHB may play a role in
   reducing energy-substrate demand and consumption and in preventing
   the production of free radicals *RF 4 *.
   11 OF 12.
        GHB acts synergistically with ethanol to produce CNS and
   respiratory depression; ethanol also increases the endogenous levels
   of GHB *RF 4 *.  GHB may potentiate the effects of narcotic
   analgesics and skeletal muscle relaxants and may be potentiated by
   the actions of benzodiazepines and neuroleptics *RF 5 *.  Although
   antagonism may occur with d-amphetamine, naloxone, haloperidol, and
   drugs used for absence seizures *RF 4 *, these experimental
   antagonists have not been assessed as possible treatments for GHB
   overdose.  Anecdotally, naloxone has not been effective in treating
   a limited number of GHB-related poisonings.
   12 OF 12.
        The focus of public education efforts should be that products
   such as GHB that are promoted for physiologic effects act on the body
   as drugs.  In this context, advertising terms such as "natural,"
   "organic," or "supplement" do not imply safety or legality.

AB The study of mechanisms of the epilepsies requires employment of
   animal models.  Choice of a model system depends upon several
   factors, including the question to be studied, the type of epilepsy
   to be modelled, familiarity and convenience.  Over 50 models are
   reviewed.  Major categories of models are those for simple partial
   seizures: topical convulsants, acute electrical stimulation,
   cortically implanted metals, cryogenic injury; for complex partial
   seizures: kainic acid, tetanus toxin, injections into area tempesta,
   kindling, rodent hippocampal slice, isolated cell preparations, human
   neurosurgical tissue; for generalized tonic-clonic seizures:
   genetically seizure-prone strains of mouse, rat, gerbil, fruitfly and
   baboon, maximal electroshock seizures, systemic chemical convulsants,
   metabolic derangements; and for generalized absence seizures:
   thalamic stimulation, bilateral cortical foci, systemic penicillin,
   gamma-hydroxy-butyrate, intraventricular opiates, genetic rat models.
   The lithium-pilocarpine, homocysteine and rapid repetitive
   stimulation models are most useful in studies of status epilepticus.
   Key findings learned from each of the models, the model's strengths
   and weaknesses are detailed.  Interpretation of findings from each of
   these models can be difficult.  Do results pertain to the epilepsies
   or to the particular model under study?  How important are species
   differences?  Which clinical seizure type is really being modelled?
   In a model are behavior or EEG findings only similar superficially to
   epilepsy, or are the mechanisms comparable?  The wealth of
   preparations available to model the epilepsies underscores the need
   for unifying themes, and for better understanding of basic mechanisms
   of the epilepsies.  Author-abstract. 332 Refs.

That's a pretty narrow-minded view, don't you think?

The top ten reasons to live on Mars:

10)	Closer to Jupiter
 9)	"Earth" tones are out
 8)	Less traffic
 7)	Easy to "get away from it all"
 6)	Smaller planet means better chance of meeting everybody
 5)	MRAVES mailing-list rules!

 3)	Horns on head keep your floppy hat from tipping over
 2)	Ray Bradbury writes for the local "Chronicle"
 1)	Hey, it sure beats Pluto.	

;)

Can we move on?
I don't mind the "Why I like living in X" posts, but the "Why living in X
sucks" posts really aren't helping anyone.  


Happy where I am-- hope you are, too

Subject: Time to take a break.
Status: 

I must admit, this is not an easy thing for me to do.  But it seems
like I've done everything else I can to try and foster a spirit on
here which would mirror the scene it reports on; a place where people
could come and express themselves, be themselves, and where the the
incredible power in acceptance would be exemplified, and diversity
would be appreciated.  While our expressed focus started on raves, it
became clear that by talking about these parties and meeting at them
we ourselves came to embody those tenents, those "rave ideals", as we
progressed into a real online virtual community, inspiring a dozen
other rave mailing lists around the world and setting the sparc for
DYI parties in SF and many other places.  But societies undergo
change, societies have biorhythms like other intelligent organisms,
and while we have felt the swings on the list many times, it seems
like there must come a time when cycles finish, when the circle has
turned its last degree and it's time to start anew, a fresh beginning.
That new beginning does not involve the casting away of the old, it
doesn't mean what came before was wrong, simply that times change and
new elemnts replace ones that disappear, and those old sometimes make
a return appearance, or they get incorporated into other new elements.

I feel SFRaves has reached the end of a cycle it began in March 92,
and it's time to start anew.  The basic concept of an email mailing
list devoted to discussion of the rave scene here is totally valid, as
it the movement we made towards community.  But we made such a
headlong rush I think we burned ourselves out and didn't stop to think
about a lot of things, and ended up taking for granted that which
allowed us to come together in the first place.  

I am not going to itemize any events which have led me to this.  I
don't think I can, nor do I think I need to.  We have all felt it in
one way or another.

Consider this a vacation.  In one week, SFRaves will be back up.
Everyone who was on it will still be on it.  During this interim I
think a little reflection on what your involvement with the mailing
list was like, and whether you were getting out of it as much as you
were putting in, and vice versa, would be appropriate.  There are many
of you who have been putting out montrous efforts, and please realize
I'm not doing this because of you, directly.  I want us to try and
focus our energies on what's REALLY important to us, to be a little
more pensive about what we are doing here.  We ARE doing important
and wonderful things.  But until we can act like a *community*, 
we'll be tripping over ourselves.  

It's time to start anew.

Brian.

Subject: WELCOME BACK
Status: 

        Okay... sorry about the delay in getting this up; I was gonna
do it this morning but wouldn't you know they changed the root
password on me :)

        My hope is that people used the time during the break to
meditate, to think about exactly what it is we're doing here, what we
hope to acheive, what exactly sfraves means to us.  At least I hope
it's calmed some nerves that seemed to be very frayed a week ago, and
given everyone a chance to catch up in their mail spools.

	I'm hopeful that people can see this as a fresh start; that we
can approach mail we receive from the list with less mental baggage,
less aptitude to interpret words in the worst possible way, and a more
open approach to communication with each other.  It is completely
within our power to create a community whose whole is greater than the
sum of its members, a community which empowers it members rather than
degrades them.  A community where free thought and expression are
promoted, and where members don't feel threatened by the words of
another.  

	These are nice words, of course, but they are more than just
lofty ideals.  The concepts of "peace, love, unity and respect" are
more than just words - they can be translated and incorporated into
EVERY thing you do.  That, to me, is what "raving" is all about -
about acceptance, about love of diversity, about giving people the
benefit of the doubt.  This is not irreconcilable with maintaining a
critical and rational mind, with exercising judgement upon what you
see; instead it's the realization that all viewpoints can be equally
valid.  

	So, here we are.  Starting fresh.  

	Understand that I took the action of halting the list
temporarily not out of anger towards any individuals, or because I
didn't like sfraves anymore, or I got bored, or something.  I did it
because I felt the "reset" button needed to be pushed.  There were
many positive things about sfraves before now, and I hope they will be
brought with us.  The people certainly are the same - that's why I
chose not to do something like unsubscribe everyone.  You're all
basically great people, each with the capacity to help make the 
community shine, as you have done in the past and will continue to do
in the future.  Now let's encourage everyone to shine.

	The list has NOT changed focus - it is still basically about
the rave scene in San Francisco.  But in many if not most of us,
raving has made a big difference in our lives, so thus a discussion
about raves is necessarily a dicussion about our lives.  Try and stay
focused, try to tie everything into the focus... but do not feel
afraid to talk about anything.  And the flipside is, respect the
mailboxes and the sentiments of the other people in the community.
It's very easy to stare at a computer screen and forget there are real
people behind those addresses.

	I want each person who reads this to evaluate what they've
done in the past here, and what they'd like to do in the future.  I
for one know that I have not been as active as I'd like, and I
definitely will be pushing more in-person group activities, (to make
it harder to forget that those email addresses represent real people
:)



	Thanks for all your patience, understanding, and support.

	Brian

SFRaves is back!  To celebrate, we have another strong weekend - Chez
Groove is another production from the folks who brought you Home.  
It features our own Jon D & Lee and  should be well worth our support.
Saturday brings us Wicked at 1015 Folsom, and Sunday is the big
Moby/Orbital/Aphex Twin show at the Galleria.

There's also some sort of benefit Friday night - it's mentioned on
the Your Sisters' House info line (765.7670), but the number given

were Susan, Tara, Pollywog, Simon...

A while back I had collected a few posts off of this list, suggesting
that there would be an SRL event in the Bay Area some time in early
November.

So, I was curious if any of you cats might know if this is still on
(or was ever on).

Of course I would love to know exactly where, when and how much, but
I'll take what I can get.

Please e-mail me directly (as well as the list if you like) if you
don't mind, I do keep all of the messages off this list, but because
of the volume it might be easy to miss a reply to this message.

      ...Thanks!      ....chris

And to anybody else who is listening....just a few words from your humble
local agitant:

I really haven't read the recent flame wars post.  I saw the first post
about e vs w and decided that the issue was a "dead horse" and I was going
to leave it alone.  I've lived on both coasts and both have benefits and
drawbacks.  Everyhwere in America is just about the same to me.  Some
places have a bit more than others, some have a bit less, but everything
considered, it's all about equal.  Thereofre responding to the initial post
was illogical.  It was nothing more than someone staing their opinion in a
strong way.  And therin lies the REAL issue.

There has been alot made of the "rave" scene.  How it embodied all of these
ideals and goals, and that it is/was a movement as well as a  living
organism.  The reality is the scene really never had these qualities to
begin with. These qualities were kinda hoisted onto the back of the scene
to make it seem as though it was something more than an off-your-face drug
party.  Well, as the E has worn off we are beginning to see what things are
really about.  In reality it is nothing more than a bunch of people getting
together and dancing to music.  With the introduction of good psychedelics
people made contact and solidified new relationships.  E just made these
bondings happen quicker.  Maybe too quick.

I have been "raving" for YEARS now, and the one constant in this scene is
that it is really like any other.  It has a whole lot of people from
different backgrounds who come together for the dance/music/socialization. 
This does not mean however that people stop being who they are so that they
can commune with others.  People tend to bring whatever baggage they have
with them.  The scene has lots of different folks who do not see eye to
eye, who have differing political agendas, who think completely different
than each other.  Just like real life.  Now all of a sudden there is this
talk of the "scene" changing/dying/mutating/whatevering when in fact it has
really done nothing but thin out.  

Many of us have been doing this for YEARS now and like everyhting else the
veneer wears off.  Let's face it, life was alot simpler when you did not
know the DJ's by face, when you did not know the promoter, when you did not
care about the venue, when drugs flowed freely and in high quantity.  The
children of the house scene have grown up.  They have eaten the forbidden
fruit and now know almost everything there is to know about parties.  So
much so, many of the party-goers are now party-producers.  All of this is a
maturing process, yet instead of accepting this "change" as such, many
still want the glory days of ignorance about parties and a blissful E
induced euphoria.  Well it ain't gonna happen, we're all out of the nest.

This scene is about getting together, taking drugs, dance-until-the-trance,
and getting home in one piece.  It has never tried to change the world, and
it has never tried to make a difference.  It has not voted for anyone
collectively, and it will never win the peace prize.  It's a PARTY dammit,
just a party.  And like all other events in life, this too will pass.  Many
just don't want to give it up for what it is.  The REAL issue here is what
you do with this info.  The REAL answer is: look around.  Look at how many
people you knew when you first started going out, and look at what you have
now-> FRIENDS!!!!

FRIENDS are the only thing that matters, cuz when this "scene" is gone that
is really all that will be left.  FRIENDS are one of the reasons many of us
even go out at all.  FRIENDS fight, and when friends get to know each other
real well the fighting can get passionate.  IMO that is really what has
been going on.  A group of people (for now SFRavers) who have gotten to
know each other pretty well expressing themselves as friends do.  We all
know that when we see each other the BS of virtual communication ceases and
we get very real, and very human with each other.  So don't take all of
this "insiders track", "21+", me vs you, DJ's are god, 150+ BPM sucks, east
vs west, homeless in SF, cab laws, and JSLee so seriously.  All that is
happening is people expressing themselves to others that they care about. 
If people did not care about each other they would not communicate at all. 
And even though these exchanges look ugly, it is nothing more than a group
of passionate individuals, who have grown up with the house scene,
expressing their inner thoughts to an audience of comrades.

So if you're looking for a group of people who all think alike, you will be
disappointed.  If you're looking for people to be heading for the same
destination, you will be disappointed.  If you're looking for people to
act/behave as you act you will be disappointed.

If you're looking for people who are a reflection of a society, yet try to
overcome their differences thru the dance, then you are in the right place.
 IF you're looking to engage in the exchange of ideas, you are in the right
place.  And most importantly if you're looking to make a few new friends,
you are in the right place.  Homogenaeity sucks, diversity in
thought/action/deed will always win.  Let us revel in our differences as
well as our time.  And most importantly let's move on!!!!

With peace,
JSLSFCA <-  The "insider" URB acronym.

JSLee BKA the "insider" wastes even more bandwidth:
---------------------------------------------------

I go out these days for three reasons.  Good music, good friends, and good
drugs.  I can have a good time without drugs, but why bother if they are
readily available :).  A party to me is just that, a party.  At one time my
partner (Jeff) and I were at serious odds.  He was really pissed about
something with me/him & the scene.  I said to him finally "Look man,
friendship is more important to me than some fucking party.  After all of
this is over, and it WILL end, the realtionships that will be left will be
the only thing that matters."  After our heated exchange we both came to
realize that we were all to close to the happenings of the "scene" and it
was affecting our realtionship.  We pulled back really hard, and stopped
going out for a while.  That seemed to do help things 500% between us. 
These days we hang out, still go out, crack-on, have a great time, laugh at
ourselves, and everyone else.  Hell if I can't have a good time at a party,
I might as well stay the fuck home ;).  In any case, we both realized what
the whole "scene" is about.  The party aspect is profit driven, greed & ego
enhanced.  The reason that most are involved with it is to make a living
doing something fun.  But often times, the "make a living" outweighs the
"fun" part.  The evidence of this is displayed by the lack of quality
parties/productions this past year. Greed, avarice, and ego have caused not
only a thinning of promoters, but a thining of the crowd the greedo's
milked for profits.  And everyone is an accomplice:

Promoters - Let $$$/ego get in the way of everything else.  Ripoffs of DJ's
was rampant.  The $$ didn't add up equally for everyone.  Thought they were
the sole reason the scene even existed.  In reality it was a cash cow, but
it had limited milk. Well, those udders are dry and everyone is scrambling
for the powdered substitute.

DJ's - Let $$$/ego get in the way of everything else.  Because of them
getting ripped off they raised thier rates (some are now > $700 for a
Sat.).  They even became deluded (like their promoter employers) that THEY
were the sole reason a party went off.  Also the DJ was elevated (by
promoters), to godlike status via the infamous flyer.

Staff - Let $ (usually they are the lo-ball on the $$$ end)/ego get in the
way of everything else.  Just because you work for so and so don't mean
jack outside the club.  The fact is if it weren't for schmoozing and
kissing up to a promo you would not be employed by them.  Besides, EVRYONE
pays for drinks.

Partiers - Kept up this grand illusion by supporting the > $10 events. 
Went to the massives, burned out quick, and now wonders "Where IS that
loving feeling?  Where did it go?".  Finds it difficult to get out the door
on a sat nite.

The reason why we have so much BS these days is that the promoters fostered
this illusion of some type of community movement and milked it.  Everyone
fell into line, then woke up to find the grand illusion.  This disillusion
has spilled over onto the list.  But people in general are feeling the way
many on the list feel.  Just a reflection of our "scene".  This too will
pass.

Look, go out, have a good time.  Spend time AWAY from parties, connect,
talk about something other than music/parties/dj's.  Take some drugs
sometime, relax.
Go to a party you respect, support events you like.  Don't diss the ones
you don't, just don't attend them.  And most of all, keep all lines open
for new things, and give everyone a second chance.  Life is too short to be
pissed for more than 5 minutes.

Later,
John <- the REAL me.

And remeber, insider or not, EVERYONE pays for drinks :)

John,

I pretty much agree with everything you've said.  I'd like to take issue
with one point though:

> There has been alot made of the "rave" scene.  How it embodied all of these
> ideals and goals, and that it is/was a movement as well as a  living
> organism. 

This may have never been totally true of the scene as a whole.  But many
will testify that there have been some parties where these ideals were
experienced (i.e. the sense of sharing, coming together while respecting
diversity, our connection with the universe, etc.).  It is only natural
expect that when such ideals are experienced in a microcosm, those who 
shared in the experience would remain hopeful that these ideals could 
somehow be perpetuated.  

We need (IMO) to realize that a idealism is not an all-or-nothing 
proposition.  Everytime someone reaches out to a stranger, the world 
becomes a slightly better place.  It's just a question of scale.  Raving 
increased the scale from isolated individual action, to isolated group 
actions.

> These qualities were kinda hoisted onto the back of the scene
> to make it seem as though it was something more than an off-your-face drug
> party.  

The fact that people found a safe, supportive environment to share the
experience of doing psychedelics is pretty significant IMO.  If positive
ideals are bandied around as part of the experience, well why not?  It's
so easy to be cynical, and though cynicism is more reality-based, I would 
say that it's good for some people in this world to have some idea of what
*could* be.  The experience of raving had made some ideals seem at least
remotely plausable on a larger scale.  I know it has helped me have
*some* hope for the future.

The danger is that when people wake up to reality, they become 
disillusioned that their ideals aren't being fully realized.  The key is 
to hope for a lot without expecting too much.  And patience.  Some aspects 
of raving, and some of the things that psychedelics have shown us, can give 
us an indication of the evolutionary, mind-expanding potential of human
consciousness.  
 
> This scene is about getting together, taking drugs, dance-until-the-trance,
> and getting home in one piece.  It has never tried to change the world, and
> it has never tried to make a difference.

The "scene" is just a bunch of individuals with overlapping interests. 
Individuals *have* changed the world, individuals *can* make a difference.
If some idealistic tweakers use raving as a vehicle to spread certain 
concepts (even with the aid of greed-driven promoters) it just means that
more individuals get to hear the messages.  It doesn't matter if 
you agree the message; the point is that communication is taking place 
an parts of people's brains are being stimulated in new ways.  Ways not
sanctioned by the staus quo.  In a world where people are trained to be
closeminded, even a crack in the door is a good thing, no matter what it
is that leaks through.  Declaring that a raves is *just* a drug party is 
like saying that war is *just* a gun shooting party.  Oversimplification 
is the first line of defense against openmindedness.

ADPCM would be much more suited for music i would think. I use this format
extensively and a 16 bit 16 KHz file compressed with ADPCM will take the same
space as your sample, brian. At 32KHz (would take twice the space) you'd
get the quality of the lowest recording mode of a DAT - quite good actually).

On IBM PC the PAS16, SB16ASP and GUS can play it directly, and the others, well
there is a decompressor so you can then play it on any other soundcard or even
the PC speaker. I know there is an ADPCM compressor/decompressor on Amiga too,
and the unix sources are also available, so you can add SGI (which has that
builtin anyway i think), Sun etc... The only unknown is the Mac. But the Unix
sources are not too hard to port (the GUS version is based on it). That way it
wouldn't take more space and all people who have 16 bit playback machines
could enjoy a better SNR.

If you want to check out a 22KHz 16 bit adpcm stereo file, get klfadpcm.zip
on archive.epas.utoronto.ca - the decompression program is included. It is
1 minute long, about 1 Mb in size. 44KHz files are also on the site in
file aonadpcm.zip and so-adpcm.zip (directory /pub/pc/ultrasound/submit).

Hey kids,

I know more than a few of you are curious about the Survival Research
Lab show discussed earlier last month, so this is what I know.  They
had planned to do the show at an old Ironworks in West Oakland on land
due to become a freeway someday.  (No they weren't planning to blow
the building up!)  The show was scheduled for November 20, but
apparently the access to the space was revoked about two weeks ago.

I helped with some of the preparations, but work appears to be
significantly slowed down, implying that they haven't found a new
space yet.  I'll let y'all know if they end up getting a space and a
firm date.  I'm actually going to be in Australia next week, so I'll
be bummed if they end up having it on the 20th.

And by the way, I've alredy joined the "ausrave" mailing list and have
people to show me around.  Expect a report on the Sydney rave scene in
a couple weeks!

Share and Enjoy,

Tim

Actually the're a little bit north of here, about 1.5 hours outside of
SF.  I forget which city.  I was supposed to interview Genesis last
year for Rhythmos, one of the many SF house scene publications that
couldn't get it's shit together.  At that time, Genesis was traveling
a lot, trying to drum up remixing jobs to pay the bills.

Well, PTV did do a show back in 1989-1990 in SF at-that-venue-on-haight-
street-that-used-to-do-concerts-and-now-is-a-dance-club-but-i-can't-remember-

it was somewhat ravelike.

Status: 

After returning from a few days (on business) in Toronto, I wanted to
provide you all with the latest information on the next party the Fluid
Groove Posse will be putting on:

              Open House
    Liquid Air comes to the 3rd Wave
  Saturday, November 20th from 4-8PM
  at the 3rd Wave Dance House Theater
  Located on 24th St at Mission in SF
   DJs include Jon D. and Lee An
    No smoking, no alcohol space
   Totally legal, bust free space
       Public Transit Accessible
     All Ages   Great Dance Floor
-----FREE----Donations Accepted-------


I've been working hard to acquire this space, and to bring Liquid Air into
the light of day.  This go round, I could only get the space starting at 
4PM.  If this is a successful party, we may be able to get better times of
day.  This space is the center of the trained dance community for the SF
Bay area--it's wonderful, and located in the sunny mission, on major MUNI
lines as well as right across from a BART station. We also have access to
a lounge and a chill out area.  And, since it's a free event, there's no
hassle with IDs or ins and outs. Also, we're closing up early enough that
you can easily make it to parties later in the evening.

If any of you can make donations to help cover our expenses, I'd surely
appreciate it.  This space costs $50/hour to rent.  I could also use a
couple of volunteers to help us set up and clean up.  We also need a 
volunteer to be present to let people in (no money taking, no turning
away, etc.--just letting them in).  If you can give us a donation or
help out, please send me personal email.

Also, be on the lookout for the new flyer for Liquid Air. Likely to be
a collector's item.

Thanks to everyone for supporting Liquid Air.  I hope that
you can come experience sound surrounding you like liquid air, 
in a  whole new space.

Well, I am glad things are up and running again.  I will probably see some of
you at Wicked; failing that, I will be a Boogie Buffet, probably sweating on
stage...

Anyway, I finally figured out how to get to the FTP site with Fetch and I got
some of the sounds and some of the pics and I can't seem to do anything with
them.  Running them through Binhex (finding that wasn't easy) did nothing.  Any
Mac users out there who know how to play the sounds and see the pics?

thanks a bunchola...hope people have fun at Chez Groove...ain't no way I can
make it tonight...zak will be there though....grins to anne..

The .au format used on Suns supports ADPCM.... you need to have
OpenWindows 3.0 installed to have suppport for it, though...

The fact that all the systems you mention support ADPCM compression
doesn't necessarily mean they use compatible file formats, of course.
The Sun .au format is based on the NeXT format, I believe.

But there are a number of PD tools for file format conversion, so
evebn if the file headers are different, it shouldn't be a major
problem...

The long-awaited, long-overdue, long-playing (over 70 minutes) Spun CD is now
available.  The title is "If You Turn On".  We're offering the same deal on
the Spun CD as we did with the Garth CD: $10 per CD if you buy it in person
from either me or Pete Reiter.  (Sorry, no mail order.)

By the way, this is a dual-purpose CD, as it also doubles as a Freaky Chakra
CD single.  (It features three of the four mixes from the Freaky Chakra 12".)

If you are unable to hook up with us, the CD will soon be available at these
fine stores...

Status: 

Hello (she says sheepishly).  I was going to wait a few more weeks before
sneaking back onto sfraves, but wouldn't you know it someone posted
something to ne-raves that caused me to write a huge essay that I feel
compelled to share with you all.  SO, I *first* re-subscribed, and now
I'm posting.

Some background:  on ne-raves some of us were talking about how we 
prefer smaller, intimate, invitation only parties, kind of like the acid
house parties of old were when they got started.  David (below) objected
mildly, and posted the exerpt below in ">"'s.  The rest is my addition
to the conversation.

I don't see how sitting around getting fucked up is going to change the
world.  And I think it was totally naieve of the "rave/house/whatever"
community to say it was.  You REALLY want to change the world?  Get people
to get along WITHOUT the drugs and the music.

The ORIGINAL parties were great because they were small and close-knit and
successful and people came to have fun.  The parties grew yet managed to
maintain that friendly atmosphere.  More and more new people were brought
in -- mostly friends of friends of friends of friends -- extending a web of
community.  Somewhere along the line, though, someone made a fundamental 
logical mistake and decided that because we were having so much fun getting 
tranced out with our friends, we could and should do it with everyone and we'd 
save the world.  As you can see, it hasn't happend yet.  How much world saving 
can you do when your tripping your buns off anyway?  Let's be real here.

The most we can do is get BACK to that original feeling of peace, 
intimacy, and fun, and then start extending the web again.  What will
save the world is the act of extending the web, one friend at a time, until
you can trace your way to anyone through a line of friends and friends 
of friends.  To me this is subtly yet significantly different from what is
being preached and proscribed today in the scene.  And THIS time we will
not let money or drugs get to be the dominant force.

Being handed flyers promising brilliant visuals and 14 hot DJs is not
what is going to make this happen.  Having more and more bigger and
bigger parties is not going to be what will make this happen.  Going to
raves where the profits are donated to Greepeace or Food Not Bombs is
nice, but it still is not going to make this happen (in fact, it's the
moral equivalent of those $1500-a-head-ritzy-society dinners rich people
go to all the time). Complaining that there is no scene where you live, or 
that the scene is dying, is not going to change things for the better either.  
If you CAN throw a party, no matter how small and simple, do it.  Then make 
the next one bigger. Then bigger.  This will inspire some of the people who 
came to your party to throw a party.  They'll reach out to more people.  And 
so on and so on until it gets to the point where you can go anywhere to a 
rave and be among friends -- not just because we SAID all ravers are
friendly and get along -- but because we BUILT our society up out of
friends and friends of friends until the web spread world-wide.

Anyway, THIS is what we mean when we say "keep it underground."  It's
not about being elitist, but rather the exact opposite:  it's about being
REAL and WARM about it -- building strength from the heart and then
happily inviting people to join -- ever notice how GOOD it feels to be
invited somewhere, and how welcome you are when you arrive?  That's what
we're aiming at here:  to make it REAL and HEARTFELT and to keep on spreading
it until EVERYONE has been invited.

There's a saying that if you know 6 people,  you can trace your way to
every other person in the world.  So get 6 friends at a rave . . . then 
have each of them get 6 (different and non-overlapping from the first 6)
and so on and so on until you can go to a rave that has 10,000 people on it
and every time you turn around you see someone who you might not KNOW, but
you recognize.  This won't happen overnight . . . and raves in the US
got too big too fast for this to have happened the first time around.  But
by taking it "back underground" we give ourselves a chance to start all
over again.

Laura

P.S. Peace, love, unity, and respect DO exist, but they are not "GIVENS,"
you have to generate and spread them yourselves.  LIVING this way is
difficult, and entails a LOT more than just smiling and going to raves and
saying "it's okay to disagree" all the time.  There's an element of deep
responsibility involved here, too.  And saying "you are a raver so I 
expect you to be automatically peaceful and happy is completely bullshit,
I've seen it happen, too . . . like if I want to be a "real" raver I
have to have some kind of lobotomy or something.  Okay, so I'm digressing
a lot, well, this is what I believe.  See you all in San Francisco/Richmond
VA/Cleveland OH/who knows where else.

the point, i think, is that if you can learn to be more open and
friendly while on drugs at a party, you might (note: MIGHT) just be
able to take some of that away with you and apply it in the Real World
[Real World (C) 1993 MTV]  if you can do that, you could be on the
road to changing the world (or at least a small part of it.)

In *THEORY* and in _some_ people's practice it does work that way . . .
but I've just seen too many kids who didn't really know what they were doing 
taking lots of acid or speed or even E and using raves as a place to "get
fucked up" rather than making some kind of overall mind-expanding experience
out of it.  There are some who go to parties every week and get wasted and 
although they might develop pleasant attitudes, they sort of lose focus on
the rest of the world and the whole rave-for-peace-thing degenerates into
going from party to party scoring E, K, and acid and not DOING anything
in between except buying Vic's, baggy jeans, and compact discs. *THIS* is
_not_ goign to save the world.

A friend of mine recently told me he just had 4 or 5 really really good E
trips, and he's so happy and full of energy now and hopeful that he doesn't
even WANT to take anything for a while, he just wants to ride out the
wonderful effects he's having.  This is someone who has CLEARLY gotten
the point.

Then there are other people who when they talk about their rave experiences
do nothing but catalogue what things they dosed on and how messed up they
felt.  This is the other extreme.  These are the people I wonder about and
worry about.  This group includes the bunch who gleefully goes up to cops
and says "yeah, everyone here is on acid" or some other equally distressing
statement.  Now, I *know* I am talking to the converted here, the "responsible
drug use discussion" has gone on around here several times.  It's just that I
get *MAD* every time I see the media go off about how raves are these dirty
drug-infested parties.  Part of that image is from the media always looking
for the sensational -- but I truly believe part of it comes from those people
who just gleefully bop around telling all and sundry about how many different
things they've done with whom when and where.

Yours for RESPONSIBLE and FUN use of psychoactives,

Laura

Status: 

And i agree with Laura's point :)

i have never tried drugs beyond a few puffs of pot once or twice (which
didn't really do much for me anyway, but i am told that i didn't inhale
properly -- perhaps i should email mr. president for pointers :) :)
i don't really have a problem at all with responsible drug use as many
of the people on this list have outlined, but i too run into the experience
of hearing people talking about their rave experiences purely from a drug
point of view -- 'i was at ______.. i did ___ hits of ___ and some ____
and topped it off with some ______ and ______.' call me a drug ignoramus
if you want, but this sounds so distressingly similar to the drunken
dorm party talk where people would talk about their parties from the
point of view of what they were wasted on .. 'Dude, i was at ______'s
the other night. me and my buddy ____ got so fucked up on __ beers and
then we had some wicked _____ and polished off a bottle of _____. i had
a great time.'

i am sure that some of you will object to this parallel, and i will be
the first to admit that i'd prefer to be with a bunch of druggies than
drunks any day. it's just that i choose not to really indulge in either,
and i can't relate to this kind of talk all that much.

any other straight-edge folks care to comment?

Status: 

OK, so I couldn't avoid the Psychic TV questions... 
C
About the rumors that Genesis & Paula (Alaura or Mistress Mix) are split.. 
I heard through the grapevine whilst in England that Paula left Gen.  I wonder 
who has Genesse & Caresse (their children) if it's true.

I didn't know Gen was on sfraves but I did have an email adress for him at
the well around here somewhere.  If you're not psychic enough, maybe I can
find it for you.   :P

Brian asked how _Cold Dark Matter_ was.  Ah, a rose by any other name...
This release is actually _Themes 1_ and extra record that accompanied their
first album called Force The Hand of Chance  (and yes, it's not spelled
_Force Thee Hand Ov Chance_).  Themes are a series of ambient albums and
the first being the best in my humble opinion.  Gen has taken to rereleasing
all the ambient stuff, like Kondole (which the Orb sampled on Ultraworld).
I was a bit pissed off to pay $25 for something I already have on another
name and immediately brought it back to Tower and told them it was a
marketing scam.  They gave me my money back regardless.   But I digress...
there are all sorts of instruments used from Tibetan tigh bones to cow bells.
 I must warn you though, some parts are quite dark or sinister sounding.
Laura & Susie would probably refer to this as "mind destroying ambient"
but other parts are soft & tribal & tranced out.  

If you're open minded and into ambient musick that isn't always fluffy,
check out Throbbing Gristle's soundtrack to Derek Jarman's experimental film,
_In The Shadow Of the Sun_ which is being rereleased on CD any day now.

While on the trivia:  did you know Gen wrote the first part of _Wild Palms_
that mini-series directed by Oliver Stone about virtual reality, drugs,
conspiracy theories, secret societies, etc.?  I never got to see it but I
hear the first half was much better than the ending.  Anyone tape it?

I'm not on sfraves so please send any replies to me.

(I would have included Dave's and Laura's posts but for the sake of

I don't think Laura's and Dave's views were irreconciliable - their
message was a variant of "think globally act locally", that by 
changing and improving our outlook on life and the way we treat others,
we can make our surroundings a little bit more livable, and maybe if
a large number did this, then a whole culture might become a bit
brighter, and if a critical mass of people did this then a chain
reaction could occur which would truely equal "changing the world".
I try and do my part :)

I pretty much agree with Laura.  The fact that not every raver sees the
house scene as a world-changing one sorta lends to the argument that it
isn't one, or at least not an organized, intentional, everyone works
towards that end one.  But, every time a new person is introduced to the
scene and then becomes a regular and incorporates the rave attitude into
their daily lives the world  becomes a slightly better place.  I think 
it's obvious to most of us that raving isn't the true answer to the 
worlds problems but I think we all agree it has contributed to the
goodness as both a TAZ and a "training ground" on how to be cool to 
fellow humans.

Does anyone want to look into the possibility of using this Burlingame site for
C4? Don't flame me for this but my uncle is the Chief of Police in Burlingame
so that might make things a whole lot easier if we wanted to throw something
there (in fact, I would be inclined to invite him to go...)

Just a thought...

(I would check the site out myself, but I'm all the way down here in L.A.
right now, you know...)

loitering.  That is, if a cop sees you do any of the following, you can be
arrested.

  Flee from a police officer.

  Transfer small objects or packages for money.

  Serve as a "lookout".

  Conceal any object or yourself.

and the real kicker...

  Be within 6' of a vehicle registered to a "known drug user."

i think it's great that you'd invite your uncle to attend!

one thought about police, reporters, legislators, etc. is that they would  
view & treat us differently if they really understood - through Direct  
Personal Experience - what our celebrations are all about.

there's been some discussion on this list about a first-timers guide:  advice  
on clothing (sweat-compatible, dance-friendly), shoes, earplugs,  
pharmacology, food intake beforehand, drinking lots of water, sleep cycles,  
choosing events to attend, etc.  i've tried to give this sort of information  
& advice to my first-timer friends, and to facilitate as best i can their  
having a truly Excellent, Ecstatic Experience.  with luck one of the more  
noteworthy events of their lives.

to really guide somebody into the experience well may take considerable time  
- spread over weeks or even months, if they're nervous or want to do some  
reading first.  however it seems to me this is a gift as rewarding to give as  
to receive.  and we get a huge bonus when we include people with wide spheres  
of influence like your uncle - their future actions affecting us may be taken  
with more respect, less fear, even encouragement and assistance.

background....

I LIKE TO PARTY EVERYWHERE!

first of all let us not lose sight that raving is EVERYWHERE on our small
planet call earth!  how dare we fight over east vs. west when there are
parties in aussieland, isreal, uk, etc! 

speaking generally....

raves do take on a bit of cultural flavor from whereever they are being
held...but also have a ton of similar basic elements...

a good party is a good party and a bad party is a bad party...no matter
where it is held

we all have personal preferences...(and for those of you who know me, know
my biases) 

i could easily make a list of traits of raves in each city and what makes
them different but it seems kinda worthless...

ahhh but the wonderful thing about the net is it is easier to communicate
between the many scenes...all over the world!  and damm i wish casper had
had the live video hookup they supposedly were going to have...(have any
of you ever been on vrave while vrave was at a party somewhere?) i think
this argument started with the wrong perception....

so if anyone wants to duke this out...send me email at the address
above...and i will have tons of pictures, audio and video tapes, flyers,
and stories to show that you can have fun anywhere! partyon....susie (:

The undergrounds I go to are often small, non-flyered, with info
spread by word-of-mouth.  And, of course, they're free.  But they are
almost *never* invitation only.  You won't be asked on the door "who
invited you?".  They're open to anyone who hears about them and wants
to turn up...

Personally, I'd be sad if invitation-only became the norm....

Hi Friends,

Just wanted to thank everyone for coming out and supporting Chez Groove;
there was definitely the strongest sfr presence that I've seen in a long
time -- really made a difference.

I thought the party went great: great music all night long starting with
Jamie, followed by a killer set by Dutch who we called in desperation as
Jamie and crew showed up very late and dripping with attitude :( Jon D. and
Lee shredded in true sfr form, followed by Tony and Doran who also shredded
although unfortunately to a very small crowd at that point. Fridays are a
bit jinxed I think, people just don't have that "go all night" energy; some
have to work, others are tired form the week etc. All in all we got 150
people.

One thing I really enjoyed was the visuals, Harold from LSD really does a
great job; he projected these amazing sci-fi/fantasy illustrations of
dragon women and demons, elfs sprites, etc. really cool. Breakfast in the
morning was also nice, an essential warm up to mopping an acre of floor :)

Thanks again to everyone
see ya soon
ethan

Last Thursday (11/11) was great! Djs were Charlotte, Susan, and

all night. Susan's trance set was out of this world--one of the
best sets I've heard at any event.

And the vibe was there too. Their new space at The Upper Room is just
about right for a YSH size event. It seems a "friendly" space too. And
it's nonsmoking, which I _really_ like. I hope things keep working out
with this space.

partygoers outside found out.  There were a couple dozen of LA's finest
outside and a police helicopter to complete the scene.  Am I mistaken
or does the LAPD have more paramilitary equipment than any other?

Anyway, I was fortunate enough to be around for the soundcheck that after-
noon.  I'm glad I got to hear the bands after all. . . Orbital sounded
fantastic!!  In charge of visuals for the party were three fellows who
go by the name of Area 17.  They were playing the most amazing graphics
I've ever seen!  I talked with them for a while, and they showed me their
equipment.  They basically use a 3DO, Philips CD-I player, and a Quaddra
to make realtime interactive video.  They are able to use the music to
actually create what goes up on the screen!  (You ever _think_ the
graphics are in tune with the music?  They are now!)  Fractal graphics,
video mixing, funky color effects on still frames, and about a hundred
other things you have to see. . .

Anyway, Mike, Mark and Brett can be reached at:
mdiehr@ucsd.edu
rudholm@aimla.com
If anyone on SFRaves is interested!

PS. Saw Orbital last night, they were incredible!  Their headlamps were
great, looked like two aliens with glowing eyes. . .

Hrm...

As far as people doing lots and lots of stuff in one night...it's their choice,
right?  I am not sure the parallel of doing various types of psychoactive drugs
and various types of alcohol works out correctly.  The different psycoactive
drugs work together differently (most people will agree that a candy flip is
different from "just" an e trip or "just" an acid trip) whereas with alcohol
you just keep getting drunker...I know, a Jaegermesiter drunk is different than
beer and red wine is different from everything else, but it's still drunk...

As some of you know, I live in Sacramento, and spend a whole lot of
time in San Francisco. I'm working on fixing that :), but until I do,
maybe someone can help me out.

I'm getting tired of looking for crash space. You have been
phenomenally nice about it, but constantly being on the asking side of
things is no way to be.

What I need is a reliable place to crash on weekends and the very
occasional long weekend. I don't need a room, just a couch and a
little shelf space for some towels and such. And a key.

I am hoping for something around $100 a month. It's negotiable though.
So perhaps if someone would like to knock a little rent off each month
without losing living space, perhaps we can help each other out.  I'm
very easy to get along with, don't smoke, and I don't leave messes or
dirty dishes :). I have a car, and I go to a lot of raves, so I might
be handy for a ride now and then.

If you think you might be interested, please drop me a line...

I for one, would love a swrave list as I know, would all the Texas

hiya all sorry about that but i have been having line noise

now on to bigger and better things...

well on thursday i went to ysh and it was wonderful!

friday was skavoovee...gosh it was amazing! i think ska is also another
form of music like techno that one can dance themselves in a frenzy and
have a friendly pleasant crowd! dammm for not being techno it sure was fast!
this show was at the warfield which had an artical from some audio
magazine featuring the warfield as the place to have a "rave"
it looks like the pictures was taken at one of the "many" techno raves
(concerts?) held there...and this is what the caption says...

"SOUND FOR RAVES by maria conforti

     Initally outlaw events, raves are crawling out from the underground
and moving into clubs and auditoriums.  Now these European-inspired, all
night techno blasts are proliferating in a kosher atmosphere--and that
could mean new business for sound professionals.
     'Recently, because of city ordinances, police, or whatever, most
[raves] have moved to permanent spaces, whether it's nightclubs or
auditoriums,' reports Mark Wayne, owner of Electronic Acoustic Research
(Pacheco, Calif).  'This spring has been very hard on the underground
portion--they fly-by-night, opportunistic promoters renting a wherehouse
are dying out pretty fast.'
     Although these events often are dj-only affairs, Wayne has serviced
'semi-live' raves that sport samplings keyboardists in additon to djs, and
has also miked acousitc...." {that is all the text had i cannot figure out
what magazine it is from or i would find the rest of the artical)

so the warfield thinks they are doing all night parties??? whatever

then after this i went to chez grooves...which has the coolest location
and was one killer party...

the next night i went to go see depeche mode...and i liked (no flames
please) there video/film/light show...but i was disappointed by the
blasphemous appearance of a live drum set on stage...how could a techno
pop band reject its roots of electronics....ahhhhh!!! i was too tired to
go to wicked (which i later heard that dave and martin were there at the bar!)
or to the aids benefit at 16th and harrison...

then i went to go see moby/orbital/aphex twin...it is cool...i had fun...i
had this tremendous dejavou strange vibe cuz the last time i had been the
galaria was in a tafita dress for my high school winterball...but after
overcomming that i just boogied away...thanx rocky for the use of your
laminate...i got to see moby's dat machine...and chat with mark from vapor
space (i hope he will come to dinner with laura and liz *from ysh* in nyc
and i told him to get on the net) i also saw an neraves sticker on one of
the instrument cases that rocky pointed out (wheeee) and the best part of
the evening was to dis on moby with some of the backstage roadies...(:(:
i then went with bob, jim and phred to the after party at freelon
street...the space is a little to cramped for me but...i sat and chatted
for a while...and met an old buddy who i haven't seen in a long time (so
please hit me the next time i post about all ravers not growing up in sf)

Subject: UK seen report #2 of 3
Status: 

So I was gonna stay for about 3 weeks but I ended up staying for 2 months.
The reason for this is I wanted to attend two SLACK parties.  I arrived
for my birthday and in time for the first SLACK.  If you're famialiar with
Bob and The Church of the Subgenius, then you'll understand how it got it's
name.  They usually occur on the full moon and have replaced the once a
month parties that the Tonka crew used to hold.  Most of the original Tonka
members (Jeno, Garth & Markie) are now in San Fransisco doing their thing
there.  This is all in a small town an hour south of London on the coast.
There are two colleges there so as you can imagine, the place is full of
students & slackers who do nothing but go to wicked parties.

When raves took off in England in the late eighties, they often happened
after a club in protest of closing times around 2 or 3.  Back in '91,
we sometimes didn't even go the club to hear the Tonka sound system.
Instead we would just wait until around 3 and meet up on the beach
when the sound system was set up and running.  After all it was free, not
so crowded & hot... and the DJs would be in fine form, the musick would
*really* kick in at the "afterparty" (notice the language, they don't use
the word "rave" much).  Anyway, this tradition stil holds strong & true.

At the first SLACK, the party started in a club with 3 floors.  On the
first 2 main floors, DJs Rob & Sara treated us to some very rare acid
house and classic house.  In the third floor, some DJs from the Positive
Soundz posse spun an ambient set that proved you don't need a lack of a
beat to have ambience!  Since the town is so small, the vibe is always
very intimate and friendly in a sincere way.  It seems like everyone is
dancing and probably everyone is because the musick is usually so good
and well done.  There was so much NEW musick and most people I met had decks.
Imagine the number of DJs!!!  At the last hour, we got into some slow yet
tranced out tracks.  "That was a good warm up," my friends were saying.
"You can't be tired yet" but I was still adjusting to a 5 hour time 
difference and jet lag from a 7 hour plane ride.  3 am there to me was
8 am!  "but we're only getting started!"  and they were right!

We went out onto the beach and set up a huge tent.  It was a little bit
cold with the sea air coming onto us but that didn't stop anyone.  There
were about 200 people there and the musick was pretty fluffy trance.
I wasn't getting into it because I'm used to hearing hard acid to get me
going.  For the SLACK posse tho, hard acid=hardcore and they don't like
hardcore.  The DJ to look out for is Darius.  There's talk about SLACK
going to San Fransisco sometime in April hopefully along with DiY and if
you get a chance to hear him, do it!  In the past, he's been the one to
play all the fluffy trance he used to call "progressive ambient" but now
he gets fed up with all his friends playing all that and he goes for a
deep tranced out electro/trippy set.  Lots of wind you up beats that get
you to jump onto the dance floor.  His mixing skills are impressive every
time I hear him.  I've never heard any DJ in my life be so creative and
successful at mixing 2 records together.  On top of that, his tracks are
rare & underground... "where does he find them?" I kept asking everyone.
If you have a copy of DiY's Hothouse EP, you might notice his name credited
first out of a few hundred names.  He used to be part of DiY and SugarLump.
After him was NYK from Positive Soundz and Charlotte and Felix who played 
everything from tranced out house to intelligent dance musick.  Needless to 
say my head was spinning but I had a wicked time.  

A week later, my best friend who worked for Laterna Magicka (a collective
who do "cinematic visuals" at parties) invited me up to check out SabreSonic.
If you're familiar with the Sabres of Paradise record label or if you've
ever heard of Andrew Weatherall, this is the corresponding club.  To make
a long story short, Andy was spinning at the all night afterparty which
we didn't go to.  At the club someone else replaced him and spun trance
that kept getting faster & deeper & harder eventually building up to some
wicked acid at the very end.  I met a few people and found them to be
very friendly... lots of smiles and a great vibe for what is supposed to be
a big, cold city.  When we came back from London, we were invited to the
Shark club where Alex Patterson of the Orb was spinning.  I was too tired
and uninterested in a name.... HYPE, HYPE, HYPE! and all that... but I hear
he spun a good house set.  A few days later we went to a small club in
town for a couple of hours which was OK and I later found out that Mr. C
of the Shamen was spinning.  I heard him spin the year before at the opening
of a club in Brixton which was great but a bit on the commercial side.

That weekend, we went into the countryside for a few dayz to chill out
and pick magick mushrooms!!!  I also ripped up my finger pretty bad on
a barbed wire fence so I was a bit bummed but several cups of mushroom
brew (made with hundreds in each!) and 14 stitches later... and I was
ready to go again!  stay tuned for the conclusion.

	"candyflip" *WHY* is the experience degraded so much by such a
name?

	Please don't take this as a flame-- the term is used widely,
so it's an indirected rant-- but "candyflip?" It makes the experience
seem trivial, almost banal.

	XL (my preferred term) is *not* a trivial experience, *not*
suited for the name "candyflip".

RAVE REPORT:

  I think I beat my old record for staying awake...   Anyway,  I'll
start off with YSH which was it's traditional family gathering of
great familiar people.   Held at the Upper Room on top of the
Burger King,  it was a very good venue,  and I hope they always
hold them there (Because of the strict non-smoking policy). I would 
venture to say that it is the most healtheyist places to dance as
a result,  although I'm sure the smokers might have different
feelings.

  Friday was Chez Groove,  put on my our own Ethan,   which was a
super great party.  Drinks were inexpensive,  food was free,  and
the music was really great.   I really like the venue as well,
and afterwards,   a free breakfast for those that stayed through
the end.

  Saturday,  was hot and wicked,   again the most gnarley and heavy
rave in the scene.   The 1015 Folsom space was really done up right,
as the chillout area was in the "Dark room" with lots of pillows
and a great place to chill out.    Ins and outs were allowed which
I am grateful for,  as I had plenty of opportunity to chill.
They had to close the chill out room early because they had to 
get the space ready for Boogie Buffet.    They kicked everyone out
in the morning,  but I wanted to continue dancing so I tripped over
to the End Up,  and hung out there till Boogie Opened up.   The
sound system at 1015 Folsom St has significantly improved,  and
they moved the speakers that were in the four slanted positions
close to the floor (Possibly to make more room).

   After daning all day long at the End Up,  I headed out for dinner
and wound up at the Galleria to hear Moby and Orbital.   The heavy fast
acid trance and hard-core really kept me going,  dispite the problem
I had with my left foot,  but the faster music just means I had to do less
"foot work" anyway.  Yow!! the energy was awsome.    I almost didn't go,
but at the last minute I somehow found the energy to go.   I'm sure glad
I did,  but dispite the sleep deprevation

   I fonally made it home... and slept for about 14 hours+.   Woke up
at 4 pm.   Still VERY GROGGY and sluggish,  so next few days will be
used to recover and try to find a job.

Yes!  I heard this was true on KQED radio last week.  I only vaguely
remember the whole story, but the bottom line is that this law was

Status: 

I already mentioned YSH and Chez Groove . . . and lemme tellya, c'est la
*groove* at Chez Groove.  I was musing about the possibility of that name
being used for a series of parties that explicitly aim for a more
experimental
or leading-edge DJ approach.  Being pretty familiar with Tony's stuff these
days, for example, I was impressed with the extra effort he put into pulling
some more ethereal/obscure stuff.  I think the scene could really use a
semi-regular event where the DJs go exploring beyond the normal bounds,
and attract even more folks open to different sounds and approaches in
addition to those who were groovin' on Friday . . .

The contrast with Wicked on Saturday couldn't have been greater, in my view.
I arrived in time to hear Garth take over, and I thought both he and Jeno
played it very safe for the young clubbers who dominated the crowd (my
forearms actually hurt from all the elbows . . . one thing you can always
tell with a crowd like that is their restlessness, and plowing through
the dance floor with no particular destination or purpose seems endemic
to the vibe at those times . . .)  By 'young' in this case I mean early-to-
mid-20s, but not the dressy-clubby types you run into at DV8 and similar
venues.  I don't want to harp on this, because I was generally having a
pretty good time, and Ten Fifteen is *home*, after all, but it got pretty
tiresome when the crowd didn't lighten up and tune in a little around
3 or 4 when that usually happens.  

But I will say that Thomas drew us all up out of our seats with a truly
funky inspired set -- he subbed for Markie, who I gather was back east
and unable to get back in time to meet the schedule.  If the crew at 
Folsom had pulled the cover off the skylights at 6 am instead of at the
end around 7:45 it would have been real magic.  

I'm definitely a little regretful I couldn't make it for Come/Unity --
it's clear that this Wicked was definitely a step below in quality/vibe.
On the other hand, I can sympathize with the dilemma faced by Garth and
Jeno in negotiating with a restless, unfocused crowd.  Having the downstairs
open helped keep the crush down at least early on, and the chill room also
helped, but I have to say it was the least ambient coolout zone I can 
remember in a while.

So, Friday night phred-the-critic was totally bushwhacked, being done in
by stellar back-to-back sets through the night, while Saturday just had
to be a bit of a letdown given the crowd -- but let's give Thomas
proper props for pulling through at the end.

I was reasonably entertained and impressed by the big blowout show at
the Design Center last night.  Both YAP and Vapour Space were more
interesting than I expected.  DJ Tim (Utah Saints) stole the honors
for a driving set (what the east-coasters would call 'slow trance' :)
running a peppy but danceable series of tracks.  Jeno never really
had time enough to get the momentum really going although he spun some
inna tribal stylee in contrast to the more usual fare of Wicked the
previous night.

Of the headliners, Aphex Twin left me basically cold.  I have great
respect for his technical know-how and sonic inventions, but except for
the digeridoo stuff it just doesn't reach me.  Your mileage may vary :)
Likewise, Moby-the-techno-rapper just struck me as being a waste of time
stage-wise, although clearly the crowd were into it.  I guess I've just
seen to many rock bands over the years to be much interested.  His
studio stuff is somewhat interesting but generally in the bpms above the
range I find danceable.  I have no problem with his intentions -- there
was a typed sheet at the t-shirt sales table with a page of his thoughts
on the problems of gun violence and cigarette smoking and other issues,
concluding with something to the effect that we're smart folks and can
be a part of change for the better -- something we'd all agree with.

That leaves Orbital, and though Susie described it to me as being as good
as their CD except with better sound, I give them a lot of credit for
pulling off a true live show (albeit with a ton of sequences and samples
instead of analogue instruments) and doing it with style and a sense of
fun.  They were never less than interesting and occasionally engrossing.
Good stuff!

The Design Center ain't my favorite place for an event, what with the
dullard Lyons rent-a-cops strutting around and the corporate decorative
motif.  But the sound was really good -- Shredder has done the place
quite a few times and it shows -- and I thought the lights were excellent
with lots of variety and just enough knock-yer-eyeballs-flat effects.

We checked out an afterparty in an interesting little garage space about
half a block from the Troc -- maybe we'll see more of that venue in the
near future.  

And now I'm back in Portland and faced with the uphill task of realigning
my brain with daily reality!

Looks like next weekend will be another good one . . . Seattle is my
destination, where if the sets Tony and Doran laid down at Chez Groove
are any indication, the Basics up there might be the Puget Sound Party
of the Year (DJs also include our pal Donald 'Dominator' Glaude, Jon
Williams and Spun!) . . 

thanks to all for a great weekend, especially Ethan, Bryce, JonD, Lee
and all those who helped with Chez Groooooooove!

Hold on chuckos the cab law was struck down but I think you STILL need to
have a license for 18+. 1015 and some other venues
don't have this yet (It cost more).

So by my calculation, that's about 80 hours without sleep.  John,
I know you're one healthy nut (I mean this in a good way), and my
understanding is that you do not rely very heavily on drugs for your
stamina.  How do you do it?  What does it feel like near the end?  Some
kind of endorphine/adrenaline trip?  Hallucinations?   I don't think 
I've ever gone beyond 48 hours sleep deprived.  Inquiring mad scientists
would like to know.

A recorder for a PC sound card for that format
A converter available for IBM, Apple, and source code for Unix

All freeware of course, which I'll make available on the site.

My review of Young American Primitive - 

We walked in while he was playing.  He was great!  A lot of energy, just
him on stage with two or three synths, sounded pretty much like his CD,
which is also great.  

My review of Vapour Space - 

He started with Grav Arch of 10, and I finally got to hear it on a BIG
system where its done true justice.  He played for about half an hour,
keeping it constantly segued and interesting.  Very qool.

My review of Aphex Twin - 

Slightly less enthralling than I though, but I had really high hopes
anyways so maybe they were unrealistic.  I just wish I could have seen
exactly HOW he was making those amazing sounds, but instead he was
curled up behind his equipment and extremely poorly lit.  Sigh.  I
guess it's meant to be danced to, not watched.  I totally tranced out
during one or two of the slower dubbier songs; the fast ones where
quite compelling but not eentirely danceable to me.  Oh well, the
crowd was VERY into it - probably the best reaction to hardcore I've
ever seen on that scale in SF.  I was certain a thrash pit would
start up, but amazingly one didn't.

My review of Orbital - 

Fantastic!  I thought I was gonna be bored by them, having seen them
before and liking their set before coz I could see everything going
on; this time I enjoyed it entirely.  They did rearrangements of a
lot of their music, made a lot of crowd-pleasing breaks, etc; it
was a LOT of fun.

My review of the location - 

The Galleria was a very unique site - I've never been to a rave there
and never had heard of one having been held there.  It was great!
It's basically the atrium to a four-level high-priced retail outlet;
and they let people on all the different floors, giving a really
amazing feeling.  Whoever did the lighting totally outdid themselves,
it was quite stimulating.  The sound system was top-notch too - and
they had speakers located all over the place, on every floor.  The
crowd was really great, too - strong presence from all the various
facets of the scene here.

My review of Moby - 

For sale: $25 takes the whole lot (shipping included within the US)

Moby: I Feel It 
Moby: Go! 
Moby: Next is the E 
Moby: Drop a Beat

Not that i really saw a concert...
but i got to see a good 10-20 min of sound check
so what the hell.. thats good enough for a review eh?

Vapour Space-
ever since i actually sat down and listened to his record
ive been blown away by it and love it more each time
so when we were just talking and this noise slowly creeps up
over the sound system and i realize what it was 
i was quite excited
this sound check was the most unbroken and sounded great
and i danced and was happy

Aphex-
got kicked out in the middle of it, but the first half was filled
with some of the most beautiful unearthly noises
and even when we were standing outside there was just
wonderful noise emenating form the buidling

Orbital-
This was the most broken up and there werent any even close to full songs
sounded pretty good and hearing chime was cool
and they kept screwing up on the keyboards hitting a wrong note
so maybe moby was right

Moby-
this is the sound check we wlked into and it was loud and mobyish
live guitar and drummer (congas) who was playing with and without the music
so im assuming they werent on DAT..
after a few songs, AHA came on and Moby got off the stage 
and stood at the back of the room watching and listening to his
soundcheck happen...
talk about Kodak moments

None of the interviews we have been planning on for weeks happened
and we didnt even get to talk to any of them except
Mark from Vap. Space, who is very nice 

Also got to talk to Tim and some of the others on the tour
cuz they werent allowed inside the venue either for quite awhile

in a very abstract way, it was funny

also, on the way to dinner (which was our downfall, had we stayed
we could have been locked inside instead :)
we passed by a sign that said I.D.M. Corp.  
(we also passed by aphex in his scraggly beard, but...)
dunno wha thte company does.. but it was there

I've tried to unload my "Drop a Beat" single several times.  Rasputin
Records in concord finally offered me $1 for it.  Good luck, though.

...or an act that puts things on DAT and puts on a boring show?

Maybe it was my state of mind at the time, but at times Moby actually
annoyed me.  I had friends visiting this weekend who are big Moby fans
and they were totally disappointed.  (They still love his music, but
won't see him live again).

Aphex Twin or Orbital are a big toss-up for my favorite part of the show.
I think Orbital's set was better but I really like the Aphex Twin and
the novelty of seeing him was pretty great.  Unfortunately there
wasn't all that much to see.  

I was really into Jeno's set but it was way too short.

It was great to run into a lot of friends there, and especially to
finally meet Fred, Pete, and Greg Earle.

Funny moment:  Greg had told me Dwayne Goettel was there, and since
one of my friends is a big Skinny Puppy fan I told him, a little
later.  So this guy overhears and says, "Really?  Dwayne's here?" with
this big smile on his face, and walks away laughing, just as I realize
he he looked just like Greg's description... :-)

Anyway, Great time, strange (but good) space, not enough sleep.  Thank
God I had yesterday off.

I think I can say that I built up an awsome amount of indurance over
the last few years after I got really serious about fixing my back
problem thats been plaiging me over the last 15 years.   The Doc
said that if I didn't deal with it,  I would not be able to walk
within 3 to 4 years,  so About 2 years
ago,  when I returned from living in the USSR and Eastern Europe
(Not a very healthey place to live,  by the way),  I was advised by 
my doctor to really do certain things (And avoid certain things) to
heal myself.   His assistant I did contracting work for,  couldn't
pay me for programming tasks,  and offerred to be my personal trainer
who specializes in Kinestheoilogy (Muscle testing and control),  and
not only did his stuff to me,  but showed me the secrets of how I can
learn to move my body in the most efficient way possible with little
or no impact pressure on my lower back.   The secret is getting strong
legs and re-learning through a disclipline similar to Feldencreis
(Scuse spelling).   I combined it with Thai-chi,  yoga,  Nautilus,
stairmaster,  virsaclimber,  and gravitron in the right amounts to
achive this efficiency.   I have also learned to "Patch around" my 
back trauma by building up the adjacent muscles in my butt,  inner 
theighs,  and over a long period of time,  have learnd to use those
adjacent muscles for stability and support.

I do admit that I spend 3 to 4 times more than anyone else maintaining
my body and physical condition,  especially in the hours leading up to
a rave(s).  Before going to raves,  I get myself into a trancey state
where I shut out all outside stimulus and work every muscle in my body
through slow movements and dynamic yoga type exercises to keep myself
flexable.   I find that flexability is the key to efficiency,  and
through rave dancing,  I can achieve this far above and beyond anything
I can do on a stairmaster,  or gym equipment.    Over a long period of 
time,  I have steadily increased my indurance, flexability, strength,
etc through raving.    But if you have seen me dance,  you would observe 
that I move and flex every possible motion (back arching,  bending, 
arm moving,  etc) in the way that is best for my body.   I have had 
other "ravers" train with me,  and I observe that their knees are
very weak and trashed,  and as an experiment,  while at the Moby/Orb show,
I tried to dance their style,  and it resulted is my knees getting very
sore as I tried to emulate the quick locking and un-locking of the knees
style of dancing.   So I strive to move in the most fluid way possible,
flexing and arching my back,  bending side to side,  working the arms,
etc.   I remember last March when I asked my trainer when I would be fit
to dance,   I recall him saying "show me a video tape of ravers",  so
I did,  and he pointed out to some individuals and said "If I ever catch
you dancing like this,  I'll have you for breakfast".   My trainer pushes
me far and above what I think my limit is,  but in a safe manner,  always
watching out for "Sloppyness" and loss of concentration.

I also admit that after staying awake for more than 80 hours (which
is only HALF the world record),  I feel totally drained to the point
that I feel like I'm moving through molassis.   Staying awake for
4 days without sleep is not that much harder than staying awake for
2 days,   cause after a while,   your body gets used to it.

After these long dance sessions,  I DON'T feel sore,
except when I do stupid things like trip and twist my ankle like
I did at Chez Groove.    Actually it was a wet spot on the floor
I didn't notice and screwed up my left foot.    I could still dance,
but my style was toned down a tad.   At Wicked there was little room
to move around and get "Airborn",  so it didn't change things.

At the Moby/Orb show,  was Hardcore,  and I use little "Foot work"
for that faster 160+ BPM stuff.   I was able to put ice on my ankle
at the Orb show,  which made a significant difference.

Lee says:  What does it feel like near the end? 

I feel a hot fire within myself,  and a total warm feeling that is
impossible to describe (Especially on LSD),   but it feels very good,
my temperature is very high,  I feel awsomely energetic even on the
4th day,   and only after about 4 -5 hours of "cooling down" will I
start feeling what one would consider "tired".   It is a completly
different feeling than anything else I have ever experienced,  and
feels totally wonderful.   After returning home from a rave,  I soak
in a hot bath with mineral salts until I can barely move,  then somehow
make it to bed.

So,  this week,  I plan on staying off my feet as much as possible
and message my foot to heal it as often as I can.   I find that if
I injure part of my body,  it is important to move it as soon as 
possible my flexing it through its normal motion.

Anyway,  that is my secret for what it's worth,  and I've always been
open and forthcoming by passing this knowledge on to others,  and am
thinking of establishing "Personal training" sessions for those willing
to pay me about $45 a session.  I've done this in the past,  and thinking
of starting it up again at least till I get another job.  I'm going through
a certification process with my trainer,  learning the fine points of
body maintenence.  When I train with a partner I put my "energy" into them
thus I feel somewhat drained,  so I cannot serve that many clients at
once.  I go through an extensive interview process with any potentual
paying clients,  to learn exactly what they need to work on.  Their
first session with me will leave them pretty drained of energy,  but
after a few days,  they will be somewhere between 5 to 10% stronger
after the first complete session,  which involves two "visits" about
2 to 3 days apart.

Nuff said...

Anybody out there remember lip-synch as an art form?  As I understand it,
the idea was that a man drag, would mime to recorded songs
by some camp goddess like Judy Garland or whoever.  The point is that 
lip-synchers' didn't *claim* to be singing, but they *were* portraying
characters.  And another idea - the honorable ancestry of house, born out
of gospel and disco  ( what is "soul music" anyway? ). Now consider Moby, 
his computerized, techno version of lip-synching and his weird Jesus posing.
I sort of thought he may have been making a point when he did that song
with a lot of diva-wailing ( "can you feel it" or some such ); that he was
in fact paying homage to thee roots of house.  Of course "pay homage to"
and "rip off" are 1st cousins.   And some gay-lib types regard lip-synch as
symptomatic of gay oppression.  But anyway, I don't totally condemn Moby, not
without some more information about his approach to his art.  After all, if Terence McKenna can be an entertaining nightclub performer who dabbles in shamanism,
I can accept Moby as an entertaining nightclub performer who dabbles in 
Christianity.  I mean, it's only rock'n'roll.  Let's not get too serious.
Anybody out there know more about Moby?  I'm just reacting here, but my 
main reaction was that his set was too short.

Subject: Orbital/Aphex - San Francisco review
Status: 

After spending a terrific night at "Wicked" in San Francisco, my friend Grant
and I crashed at my brother's house for a few hours.  When we got up, we
decided that we'd hit the Haight for some clothes and record shopping, then
try and meet up with Orbital down at the location.

Things were a bit dodgy as to how we were going to do the latter.  I'd heard
from Phil and Paul before the tour started, wondering why they weren't coming
to Salt Lake City.  The reason being the fact that throwing Moby and NASA on
the tour had complicated things beyond belief, along with a much higher price
tag.  Once the tour started, I heard briefly from the tour manager, Lane, but
nothing from the brothers.  I was wondering if they'd even recognize me again.
When I met Meat Beat the second time, they had no idea who I was.

Grant and I went into our first record shop on the Haight, "Reckless Records"
and thumbed around for decent used releases.  As I was pouring over one
section, I raised my head to see two bald men looking an old Ryuchi Sakamoto
record with much excitement.  I looked over in another corner of the shop to
see their sound tech thumbing through a pile of CDs, and Richard James and his
girlfriend going over another pile.  We had all landed in this shop at
virtually the same time.  I had entered the Twilight Zone.

I walked over to Phil and Paul and extended my hand.  At first they gave me
the "What the hell?" look, then smiles spread over their faces.  "What a wild
coincidence, what are you doing here?" Phil said.  "Well, its not that wild,
I'm in town to see you."  We all were a bit weirded out by the fact that it
was almost exactly one year ago when we first met.

We talked about the tour, Moby and the tour, Moby and the Internet, and a load
of other things.  Phil promised to put Grant and myself on the guest list.  He
also mentioned that Circa '93 had been cancelled and I was utterly shocked.
He said close to $90,000 had been lost on the show.  It made the measly $2500
I lost on the Communion Tour seem like a drop in the bucket.  We discussed the
fact that they were seriously unhappy over the fact that they couldn't get to
Salt Lake this time and the treatment I had been given by the agent.  Their
one request for this tour was that they get to Salt Lake, and that hadn't been
fulfilled.  Phil said that for the next tour, he was going to do all the
organizing himself, with weekend spots in different towns, allowing for a week
of sightseeing in the area.  I practically jumped up and down at this idea and
told them that I would love to show them the rest of Utah.

I recommended to Paul that they go hit "Recycle Records" because of the
quantity of old collectors items in there.  Grant wanted to go the other
direction so we could see some clothing shops.  So Grant and I parted ways
with Orbital and the rest, and said we'd meet up with them at the show.

After doing some more shopping, Grant and I were in Ameba looking at clothes
when Phil and Paul walked in again.  After accusing them of following us
around, we offered them a ride back to the hotel.  In the back of my mind, I
had images of us being hopelessly lost in San Francisco trying to find this
hotel.  Yet they happily accepted.  We visted another clothing shop together,
then went back to the car.  There was five minutes left before they had to be
back to the hotel, and I had no idea where I was going save for a direction
pointed to by a shop clerk.  After driving three blocks towards that area,
Grant found it on the map and we were able to continue on with more
confidence.  Of course, due to the *Zone* influence, the mixtape we were
playing in the car brought on "Naked and the Dead" at one point.  I jokingly
groaned that we should fast forward it when Phil stated, "Hey!  I know this
band!"  Amazingly enough, we got them to their hotel only five minutes after
they were supposed to be there.

When we arrived at the show later that night (after less luck finding the
venue as we had finding their hotel), we had no problems getting in.  Vapour
Space was playing at that point, but I only caught the tail end of his show.
It sounded very, very good.

Everything had been setup in the atrium of a design center.  It was almost
perfect, with two dozen Intellibeams, large hanging video screens, film loops
at the very top, and crystal clear sound without crushing speaker stacks.  It
was really a beautiful sight to see.  You could take an elevator behind the
stage up to any of the other four floors.  The glass windows allowed you to
look out over a pulsing audience as you ascended.  Scotto's light work was
impressive indeed.

Aphex took the stage next.  Rather, he sat the stage next, crouched back
behind a pile of equipment, as his dancer interpreted the sound for the
audience.  I became completely immersed in the performance.  Excepting a
wonderful interpretation of "Digideroo", I didn't recognize anything.  What I
did recognize was a sheer auditory assault of rhythm and noise.  It was simple
and worked well in a live situation.  I danced my bunz off and thought that
surely Orbital would have a tough time topping this, even though it was so
short (about 45 minutes).

As DJ Tim spun, I couldn't believe the simularity between what he likes to
play and what I like to play.  I thought I was the only person on the planet
who still played CJ Bolland's "Mindwar".  I recognized more favorites in his
set than any other DJ I've encountered.  As Grant and I were dancing, I
noticed Aphex's dancer near us.  I went over and introduced myself and asked
if he knew Ben Middleton.  He laughed and said that more people have said they
knew Ben than anyone else on this tour.  I told him that I was going to do the
Salt Lake show before it got blown out of proportion and he expressed the same
feelings towards the tour that Orbital gave me.  He mentioned that Richard's
new album was utterly "sick" and would be a true mindblower.  He told me that
the only reason Moby was on the tour was for name recognition, and I told him
that it definitely wasn't needed in Aphex's case.  He said they'd be back
around next year.

Orbital finally took the stage at around 11:45.  They started warming up the
audience and moving through "Impact" from the brown album.  Grant and I were
thrilled.  I noticed Aphex's dancer and another girl from the tour dancing
close to us and we all moved together in a wild sync as things built and
built.  Grant grabbed my shoulder and yeld in my ear, "Take out your
earplugs."  So I slowly...uncapped...my instruments.  Something I haven't done
at a concert for almost ten years.  "Lush" raged through my mind, body, and
soul with supreme clarity, but it wasn't loud enough to cause any pain.  There
was nothing, nothing better than this.  By the time they got to "Walk Now" I
was ready to shave my head.  When the final track, "Halcyon" came on, I was
ready to sell my soul.  I leaned towards Grant and said, "I should have lost
$5000 this time around."  It was so flawlessly executed by the Hartnolls that
it was one of the best moments in music I've ever witnessed.  To have seen Orb
exactly one month ago and now this was the most amazing fact to me.

When Moby came on, a half hour after Orbital's 90 minute show, I was looking
down on the stage from the fourth floor.  My raging high from hearing
Orbital's performance came crashing down as Moby kicked into a rap over "Ah".
Seeing Moby wail on an octapad while jerking around the stage with minimal
backing made me wonder what the point was.  At one time, his drummer was
softly drumming bongos while the taped backing raged over the soundsystem.
What the hell was that supposed to do?  There was about an estimated 10% of
the actual movements on stage that I could correlate to sounds coming out the
speakers.  When I saw Moby open for The Shamen almost two years ago, I was
floored.  Now I was almost physically ill.  Brian Behlendorf pointed out a fan
crushed against the stage holding up a crucifix for Moby and I felt like
puking "Exorcist stylee" from the fourth floor on his head.

I was seriously having heavy gastric pains in my stomach.  Partially due to
Moby's performance, but more due to the fact that I had dehydrated myself
during Orbital's performance.  Grant and I returned to the ground floor where
we talked with Garth for a bit, who was similarly disgusted, then we bought
t-shirts.  Grant looked at his newly purchased "See The Light" t-shirt, read
the disclaimer, "Do Not Expect A Rock Show" and then looked at the stage where
Moby was standing on a box, stage center, with his arms outstretched, doing
absolutely nothing during "Thousand".  We showed the shirt to Lane, the tour
manager who was standing near us at that point.  He breathed a deep, "Uh
oh..", then laughed.  Lane had been following the Internet fracas with Moby as
well.  When Moby dedicated "Next is the E" to, "Everyone with open minds,"
Lane turned to me and shouted, "THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU PETE!"  I hid my face in
my shirt and mocked cried, "I'm such an asshole, I'm sorry Moby."  Lane
laughed back at me.  It seemed that joking about the Internet fiasco was the
only highlight of Moby's show.

The lights came on, the audience started to clear out.  Grant pointed out a
certain bald head back behind the stage doing cleanup.  I snuck past security
to talk with Phil and congratulate him on the performance.  "Who died and made
you two guys God?" I asked.  He smiled and we talked about them coming back in
the spring.  I told them I would do whatever it took to get them in Utah again
and he said he would do the same.  More conversation ensued over everything
from pirate radio to John Peel, but then we had to go.  Phil encouraged Grant
and I to come to the afterparty for the show.  I said we would and promised
to meet him there.

When we got to the afterparty, Grant and I was so tired that we just sat in a
corner of the upper loft and fell asleep.  I saw Paul come up later with more
band members, but no Phil.  I wished they were playing some chill music rather
than more of the boom, boom, boom, since I was still feeling quite sick.  Yet,
we had no place to go until 4:45 when we would head to the airport.  I fell
asleep for a while.  When I woke up, I got Orbital's address from Paul and
he made me promise to take him snowboarding sometime.  He said Phil had
dropped by for a bit, but then grew tired and went back to the hotel.  I said
my goodbyes to him and pulled Grant off the dancefloor.

I must have been awake a grand total of three minutes on the plane.  I fell
asleep and woke up in Salt Lake City.  I had just experienced another
unbelievable weekend.

Shouts out to Greg Earle and his lovely wife, Andrea from Silent, Gianmarra,
and Howard.  I was really happy to have met so many more people this time than
ever before.

P.S. Phil made mention of a possible move to San Francisco.  Could be
interesting.

Subject: term moby
Status: 


:moby: /moh'bee/ [MIT: seems to have been in use among model
   railroad fans years ago.  Derived from Melville's `Moby Dick'
   (some say from `Moby Pickle').] 1. adj. Large, immense, complex,
   impressive.  "A Saturn V rocket is a truly moby frob."  "Some
   MIT undergrads pulled off a moby hack at the Harvard-Yale game."
   (See "{The Meaning of `Hack'}").  2. n. obs. The
   maximum address space of a machine (see below).  For a 680[234]0 or
   VAX or most modern 32-bit architectures, it is 4,294,967,296 8-bit
   bytes (4 gigabytes).  3. A title of address (never of third-person
   reference), usually used to show admiration, respect, and/or
   friendliness to a competent hacker.  "Greetings, moby Dave.  How's
   that address-book thing for the Mac going?"  4. adj. In
   backgammon, doubles on the dice, as in `moby sixes', `moby
   ones', etc.  Compare this with {bignum} (sense 3): double sixes
   are both bignums and moby sixes, but moby ones are not bignums (the
   use of `moby' to describe double ones is sarcastic).  Standard
   emphatic forms: `Moby foo', `moby win', `moby loss'.  `Foby
   moo': a spoonerism due to Richard Greenblatt.  5. The largest
   available unit of something which is available in discrete
   increments. Thus, ordering a "moby Coke" at your favorite
   fast-food joint is not just a request for a large Coke, it's an
   explicit request for the largest size they sell.

   This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to
   the MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge
   when it was installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical
   memory size for a timesharing system was 72 kilobytes).  Thus, a
   moby is classically 256K 36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or
   PDP-10 moby.  Back when address registers were narrow the term was
   more generally useful, because when a computer had virtual memory
   mapping, it might actually have more physical memory attached to it
   than any one program could access directly.  One could then say
   "This computer has 6 mobies" meaning that the ratio of physical
   memory to address space is 6, without having to say specifically
   how much memory there actually is.  That in turn implied that the
   computer could timeshare six `full-sized' programs without having
   to swap programs between memory and disk.

   Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces
   are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto
   a machine, so most systems have much *less* than one theoretical
   `native' moby of {core}.  Also, more modern memory-management
   techniques (esp. paging) make the `moby count' less significant.
   However, there is one series of widely-used chips for which the term
   could stand to be revived --- the Intel 8088 and 80286 with their
   incredibly {brain-damaged} segmented-memory designs.  On these, a
   `moby' would be the 1-megabyte address span of a segment/offset
   pair (by coincidence, a PDP-10 moby was exactly 1 megabyte of 9-bit
   bytes).

Hey y'all! 

     Before I say anything about possibly bogus parties,
I just want to say that I'm not affiliated with any promoters or
parties so this is not a malicious business tactic.

     Well, when I was at KZSU today, we talked to Spun and found out
that two parties scheduled for this week have put his name on
the fliers without talking to him.  These parties are Universal
Groove (on Thursday) and Energy (on Saturday).  Some of the DJs
scheduled to play at Universal Groove may cancel because they
are unhappy with this and other inconsiderateness of the promoters.
And considering that on Saturday, most of the DJs listed for Energy
are also listed for other parties on the same night it's very 
possible that, like Spun, they don't even know that their names 
are on the fliers.  

     Whether you choose to go to these events or not is your own
business.  If anyone has information to the contrary please 
correct me.  It just seems rude and unprofessional to use DJs' 
names as an advertisement without their knowledge.  And I'm sure I'm
not the only person to be disappointed when a favorite DJ doesn't 
show up.


Love,

Maiko

	After about 2 years of refusal I am finally reading the sfraves
mail list now. 

	Weird Blinking Lights Electronic Music Ensemble is available
for any parties requiring the highest quality all live real-time
ambient music for any room you deem appropriate. We've been doing this
stuff for a number of years in various forms- both visually and acoustically
(remember the big green clock counting down New Years at Psychadelic Apocalypse)
? And have relocated from our secret ocean/mountain location to San Francisco.
We currently maintain the Blue Cube House with the only dedicated carpeted
dance floor around- if you can stand the vertigo resulting from looking at it.
We had a small opening party and will be having more.

	So if you need that super analog extra fat sound for *your*
chill room email me- resonate@netcom.com and the Weird Blinking Lights
team of Sound Engineers will be happy to descend and fill your empty
acoustic space with the oscillations and resonance from the sci-fi minds
of our crew.

	Many of you have asked when our popular W.B.L.izers 1.0- the small
clear cubes with various combination so red,green,or yellow lights that you
can adjust the *speed* of- will be available for sale. They wont be but
we will be happy to tell you how to build your own. I've shined enough of
them in your faces that the sublimated addictive nature of them will probably
be forceful enough for you to learn the soldering kung-fu necessary to
build them.

	Weird Blinking Lights is also very very very close to releasing
our 75 minute 100% analog, 100% improvised, sampler-free, FM-synth free,
ambient compact disc. These will be on sale via the internet and most likely at
your local vendor of fine acoustic storage units.

	Brian B's nickname has now changed from "Jimmy" to "Mr.Tickleish".
	Please use this new nickname whenever you see him.

Could someone fill me in on said "internet fracas/fiasco" with Moby?

Did Moby go born-again? Is Moby on the internet?

Is there really a difference between "Christianity" and whatever
"religious/spiritual subcurrents" people have glommed onto in the rave

If so, sign me up for the opposite cuz I've got a Nietzche trigger finger!

	After about 2 years of refusal I am finally reading the sfraves
mail list now. 

	Weird Blinking Lights Electronic Music Ensemble is available
for any parties requiring the highest quality all live real-time
ambient music for any room you deem appropriate. We've been doing this
stuff for a number of years in various forms- both visually and acoustically
(remember the big green clock counting down New Years at Psychadelic Apocalypse)
? And have relocated from our secret ocean/mountain location to San Francisco.
We currently maintain the Blue Cube House with the only dedicated carpeted
dance floor around- if you can stand the vertigo resulting from looking at it.
We had a small opening party and will be having more.

	So if you need that super analog extra fat sound for *your*
chill room email me- resonate@netcom.com and the Weird Blinking Lights
team of Sound Engineers will be happy to descend and fill your empty
acoustic space with the oscillations and resonance from the sci-fi minds
of our crew.

	Many of you have asked when our popular W.B.L.izers 1.0- the small
clear cubes with various combination so red,green,or yellow lights that you
can adjust the *speed* of- will be available for sale. They wont be but
we will be happy to tell you how to build your own. I've shined enough of
them in your faces that the sublimated addictive nature of them will probably
be forceful enough for you to learn the soldering kung-fu necessary to
build them.

	Weird Blinking Lights is also very very very close to releasing
our 75 minute 100% analog, 100% improvised, sampler-free, FM-synth free,
ambient compact disc. These will be on sale via the internet and most likely at
your local vendor of fine acoustic storage units.

	Brian B's nickname has now changed from "Jimmy" to "Mr.Tickleish".
	Please use this new nickname whenever you see him.

>Could someone fill me in on said "internet fracas/fiasco" with Moby?

Oh dear, it's a long story, but since I had a hand in it (along with
Pete Ashdown, Brian Behlendorf, Joe Le Sense, and a cast of thousands)
I'll recap:

Moby got on to alt.rave twice through his friend DC-area promoter Michael
Meechum's account.  In both places Moby said many things about his
use of DAT during "live" performances and about his audience in general
that really teed a lot of us off.

To wit:

	people who like to criticise/analyise the music are anal
		retentive fucks (his words, not mine)

	it's okay for him to have parts of his so-called "live" performance 
		on DAT because so much can go wrong in a live setting
		(then there was a debate about how much actually was on DAT)

	ravers should be non-judgemental and open-minded (yet he called
		some of us anal retentive fucks?)

	people would rather see a good show (which he defined partly by
		saying he breaks a sweat on stage) than care about if
		the music is really produced live

There was more . . . but I don't remember it at this point.

>Did Moby go born-again? 

I thought he already was.

>Is Moby on the internet?

No, he just uses Meechum's account every so often to pontificate it seems.

>Is there really a difference between "Christianity" and whatever
>"religious/spiritual subcurrents" people have glommed onto in the rave
>scene? 

Maybe yes, maybe no, but that had little to do with the Moby flame wars.
They were basically about his use of DAT (and hey, I saw him beating on
an Octapad in NYC that had NO midi cables coming out of the back) and 
then later on about him being so condescending in his posts.

lets all face it. Moby is the Milli Vanilli of techno. he probably
doesn't even make his own music.

Hes probably a puppet of Kraftwerk who have been creating all of the
techno we hear anyways out of their underwater palace near the Galapagos
Islands.

They were going to name him "Bishop" and claim he was related to the
first rebel Anglican Bishop but the resemblence between his kin robotic
clone from Alan Dean Foster movies also had that name.

I didn't even stay to see him. I saw Aphex Twin and that was more than
enough. When I heard Aphex's set my body completely went haywire.
It was like having a seizure- which is really incredible since I've never

yes, I did attend.  It was a party put on by a friend of mine, Ellen and 
her brother.  It was a very friendly crowd;  many of them friends, and many
I have seen at other parties.

The space is actually pretty close to downtown Burlingame, yet fairly hidden
from the regular street crowd.  The police showed up around 3am and had us
close the door to the alley so that the little noise that was heard outside
would not be heard after that.  IMHO this could be a good place for approx
100~200 people.  Plenty of parking.

Status: 


Well, all I can say is I'm glad I left before he came on.

As far as AFX is concerned, his performance just reassured me of what
"true genius" really means in the modern world.  I can't believe he even
pulled off a coherent set, considering the state he was in.

I wanted to get a KALX legal station ID from him (where he says "This is
the Afx Twin, and you're listening to KALX...," etc...).  I first found
him crouched in a corner, and his first two utterances were: "I don't
think I can get up, I've lost my mind," and the declaration, "I don't have
a brain," which he repeated later.  I don't know how many different
substances were occupying his blood supply, but he got pretty excited when
his journalist friend mentioned Crystal Meth (I guess its hard to come by
in England.  

But anyway, I finally got him to say the name of the radio station, and
let him go off into the corner again, half-smiling.  Who knows, maybe the
drugs enhanced the performance...

All in all, he was a pretty charming guy, and after seeing him perform,
his music seems even more beautiful and mysterious than before.  And at
age 21???  Who knows what the future will pull from his mind...

Sure, Moby is a rock'n'roll performer who happens to market himself as
a christian.  Nothing wrong with that, but a lot of people who like 
techno and prefer raving to MTV don't care for rock performances, or 
selfrighteous spokespersons of oppressive institutions.  And I would 
say that the degree of seriousness with which Moby is disliked matches 
the degree of seriousness with which he represents himself.  In other
words, he asks for it.

Niels asks:

Yes.  One is relatively well defined and imposed via a self-appointed
authoritarian structure upon weak-willed followers who are continuously
brainwashed to remain emotionally dependant on the authority structure
that imposes it's rule on their minds.  The "religious/spiritual 
subcurrents" in the rave scene is more like an anarchic mosh pit of 
spiritual vaguaries and constructs that individuals can stage dive into, 
or gently flail around in, or observe from the sidelines, or ignore 
completely.  But as long as you're near it and feel the energy of the
music and surrounding people, you're a participant.

>If so, sign me up for the opposite cuz I've got a Nietzche trigger finger!

Hmm.  What is the opposite of spirituality?  Hedonism?  What is the opposite
of spirituality that accepts hedonism and alternative nonspiritual paths
under it's umbrella?  I don't know, but I'll see ya in church. :-)

Well, I'd say that the source for my disdain of Moby is the same as
the source of my disdain of U2, Consolidated, and other self-appointed
musical ethics professors.  I really get annoyed when a performer
becomes didactic and mixes it with their performance.  There's a point
when "music having a message" crosses the line into "message being
rammed down your throat, with music".  

One thing that compounds this is when I really LIKE the music (e.g.
consolidated).  I don't know why, though.

Interesting question.  The Cathars and other early pseudo-Christian
religions believed exactly that Hedonism (actually anything having
to do with the body) and Spirituality were incompatable.  Of course,
they were all killed by the Catholics in the Crusade of the
Albigensian (sp?) Heresy, so its a moot point anyway.

IMHO spirituality is just like any other controlled substance, fine in
moderation as long as you know when to stop and give yourself plenty
of time to chill out between doses.  :-)

See ya,

-Howard

produced by Digit and EFX; which was their biggest record to date.  They have
had 9 twelve inch singles, and highly recommended is the double LP/CD/cassette,

	In this modern antiquated day and age I will follow the need to
deconstruct everything we/i&i see.
	i was looking forward to seeing the NASA show to see exactly
what methods our fave bands would use to bring their studio technology
in front of the people. Here is what I observed:
	VapourSpace had: Roland SH-101, Roland JX-3P/PG300 Programmer,
			  TR909, Akai Sampler, Mackie 16 Channel mixer,
			  some processors and other stuff i couldn't see.
	His stuff was sequenced from a master clock source and he spent
	his time tweaking the sounds triggered from the sequencer- a very
	minimalist and efficient set. I was afforded the opportunity to
	listen to his set from the Sunday night NASA show on a later
	recorded medium and it was a very thinsounding set on tape- much
	better live- but then again wasn't engineered for a recording.
	I thought he was excellent and really knew how to deliver more
	analog for the money in an efficient way. He didn't have patch
	cables everywhere and could stand in front of everyone and tap his
	toes so people went nuts.

	AphexTwin: Sequential Circuits Studio 440, Korg Modular Performance
	Synth, Synthi, blonde shirtless human, Atari 1040ST, 
	and a few other synths.
	Richard "Tiny" James indeed did cause my entire existence to go into
	hyperactive mode from his skillful wall of analog sound. His setup
	was cable intensive and was very artfully designed.
	Essentially he ran his whole set from this Studio440. The Studio440
	is good old American Analog/Digital technology. It is a sampler,
	drum machine, and sequencer all combined. He had his sequences loaded
	into it reading/writing from a SCSI hard drive (mod available from
	WineCountry/SequentialCircuits) and was sending/modifying sounds
	with the other synths and home made stuff. The raspy cricket sound
	sound (a la Throbbing Gristle) was from his home made stuff. He 
	basically needed to do no more than tweak his analog controls and
	let his sequences roll to get his amazing sound. The blonde human
	really made the performance. He threw away all rules of what people
	are supposed to see on a stage and just let loose his energy.
	This establishes him as a genius of both composition and performance
	since both were used. He has home-modified some of the gear for fatter
	sound and routing- this a fun, cheap, and easy way to get great sounds
	since just about any action taken on routing on an analog synth sounds
	good. Most people just don't have the guts to open up and modify though.

	Orbital used standard emusic gear. I was not impressed.

	get lots of aerobic exercise (6 hour rollerblade sessions 2x per

	take lots of vitamins.

	dont be fooled by anything that is supposed to "give" you energy.
	all energy comes from within! you must develop yourself to a fine

	when you do sleep make sure you saturate your acoustic environment
	with lots of pink noise (smooth static from a radio, loud fan, etc)	
	so your mind and body don't get distracted by noises and wake up
	
	light is not a distractor for sleeping humans! but noise is!
	degrees of light are never a source of potential but approaching

	so blocking out little noises will make for better rest. i have a

But surely the music is the primary focus.  Using interesting

When I saw Orbital at the Brixton Academy leg of the Midi Circus tour,
they played a set mainly from their (just released) brown album, and

Re Strick's item on "used to be legal to listen to anything that passed

used to be the case.  I'm not sure if ECPA is what changed it, but.... there
is some hope of getting it changed back again...

Bill Clinton just signed a piece of legislation which restored a pre-1990
standard with regard to religious freedom, overturning a more authoritarian
standard prmulgated by the Supreme Court in the last couple of years. The
critical case involved Native American use of peyote, a sacramental cactus
which is also a controlled substance.  Anyway, if Clinton is backing efforts
to return to older and more libertarian standards in one area, it's worth a
try he'd go for it in another area as well.  He made a decent statement
about how religious freedom is vital to the 1st Amendment, is foundational
in our country, and so on; one could make the same case around a freedom to
*hear* which is the necessary corrolary to the freedom to speak.

I thought peyote already was legal if you're a member of any church
that uses it as a part of it's religion.  For example, I had a friend
a year ago that was a member of a church called the Church of North
American Peyote Users.

Yup, according to the SF Chron of yesterday, I think, Clinton
signed the bill which was passed 97-3 in the senate which changed
the way the courts can rule on questions of religious freedom.
Basically, it means that it's going to be easier for native
americans to be able to use peyote in religious ceremonies;
at least, easier to defend on First Amendment and common law
ground.

Not about FCC, but about Religeous Freedom Act.


	This act is only a precursor to true religeous freedom.  I don't
have all the details yet, but several important components stand out.
	1.  Though this act began as a case involving native rights to use 
sacramental substances, i.e. peyote, the act only overturns a firing.  It 
does not give even natives the right to use such substances.
	2.  When Clinton signed the bill, he said that true religeous
freedom kwould not be secured until the full upholding of Native American
rights were codified.  At present, peyote use is not guaranteed, and native
prisoners have few rights to Native ceremonies and sacraments.  This is an
astounding statement from the President, truly amazing support.
	3.  the beginnings of psychedelic religious freedom may not derive
from protection of Native rights, but it is a start.

	4.  Sacred sites is another issue that remains unprotected by the
Supreme Court.  Tribal worship at these sites is not guaranteed religion.


	Presently pending in the Senate (S. 1021) is Native American Free
Exercise of Religion Act (NAFERA.)  This bill has teeth.
	1.Protects sacred sites.
	2.  Protects use of peyote by Native American Church members in
Church ceremonies.
	3.  Gives prisoners the same rights as prisoners with "accepted"
religions.
	4.  Streamlines federal permitting for religious use of restricted
objects, such as eagle feathers.  (Also repatriates objects possessed by the
Federal gommint, such as bones.)
	5.  Restores the "compelling state interest" test (discarded by the
Supreme Court in the case that sparked yesterday's legislation) as the legal
standard for protecting Native religious freedom.

videotapes about this subject.  
	1.  The Peyote Road
	2.  Understanding AIRFA & NAFERA
	3.  Traditional Use of Peyote

	These tapes are EXCELLENT introductions to the subject, especially
for the uninitiated raver who wishes to further understand the indigenous
way of sacramental substances and all-nite drumming & prayers.

	NAFERA is the bill that must be passed if sacramental substances are
ever to become a legitimate part of this nation's culture.

I would think that if it could be established that NAC members have the

Bach used a standard organ.  I was not impressed.

Hey I am all for doing whatever it takes to get a ski-trip/party.

Just imagine skiing all day and then coming back to the lodge or cabin with a 
500 Watt  sound system booming.  Sounds good to me!!!

Lets start planing if there is enough interest. .

Hear hear! All this analogue + equipment snobbery is gross. Not that I
don't appreciate "analog resonate's" perspective, and I certainly do
enjoy reading his musician-oriented posts; however, I don't want to be
put down for my choice of equipment, and I'd rather let the music stand
on it's own merit than being prejudged for it's technical trendiness.

And re: "analogue resonate" derogatory comment about "FM synths".. I
can make perfectly interesting "analog" and resonant sounds on either
my Yamaha SY-77 or "my" Emulator IIIxp, using a combination of digital
resonant filters and FM, under real-time control of a breath
controller. Yes, it sounds different than a purely analog synth, and
that's good, because all those analog sounds are a bit too aesthetic
and old-hat for me. So I'd rather have the equipment I have AND and
analog synth, than just have an analog synth. 

Face it, all kinds of equipment can produce all kinds of interesting
sounds, so there's no need to make those of us that don't have some
trendy but outdated piece of equipment feel bad about our purchases.

PS: This all reminds me of those kids in high-school or junior-high that
would get huge boners cuz some lamo prog-rock band used a
TRIPLE-NECK-GUITAR or had a huge drum cage and a million drums and some
weird mechanical contraption allowing the drummer to swing around to
reach all the drums.

(perhaps we need a "spinal tap" for the techno generation, just to
show how stupid all this pretense can really get? Perhaps Moby
should volunteer for the leading role? Just imagine the plot elements:
greedy promoters that lie about dj billings; alien abductions; fashion
trendiness (I'm wearing more flannel than you!); etc.)

I don't know about the rest of you, but I was thinking about a Thanksgiving

not a big fan of turkey or Thanksgiving (except for seeing relatives) and their

It's probably much too short notice, but myself and a friend are thinking about
making a snowboarding trip and, of course, any SFRavers are certainly welcome
to come along.  Unless there is a lot of interest in which case it could be
official, but again, it's probably much too short notice.

Subject: This Week's SF Rave Guide!
Status: 


Sorry about any delay last week, the gatekeeper computer at Oracle was
'keeping' my outgoing mail till late Friday.

None of the parties on Friday night appear to be massives - so take your
pick based on DJs.  In addition to the two parties below, there's a good
selection of weeklies on Fridays.

Saturday, start the evening off at Liquid Air, a free party at the
3rd Wave, brought to you by the Fluid Groove posse.  Then you have some
choices.  A warning about Energy - they may not have booked what they
have advertised - apparently Spun had not been booked although he was
on their flyer.  Get Down... has a good lineup, as usual, but it's at
the infamous 16th and Harrison location.  Go Speed Raver appears to be
targeting the hardcore techno market, although it might not be 
hardcore like some of you know hardcore.  Rhythm at Townsend has been
getting good reviews.

The good news this week is that the law prohibiting 18-20 year-olds in
licensed "cabarets" appears to have been overturned, so if it has taken
effect, you youngsters :) won't be kicked out of the legal spaces at
2am.

New listings: Corduroy City after-school special, DRC spins at Dekadence,
	Mushroom Jazz moves to 1190 Folsom.
RIP: the Elmo line seems to have been disconnected, Pepper had its last
	go, Diverse City is on hold.

Help keep me up to date!  Any info is greatly appreciated.  Next week's
calendar will come out on Wednesday, because of Thanksgiving.

Just to continue the thread...

A girlfriend of mine turned me on to this stuff about 
10 years ago.  She would drink it mixed in only water. (Bleech)
It tastes kinda like clam juice to me.  I liked it mixed with
grapefruit juice - takes away the bite.

If you can get by the funky colour/taste, it is a wonderful
energy suplement.  Its moral, legal and non-fattening.  But wash
out your glasses/cups right away; if I remember right, dried on
Spirulina is a real drag.

	Imagine the amount of music *before* Bach that he had to work with.
Now imagine sitting down with no computer, no copier, no tools except your
own mind and composing a piece of music for over 100 different intstruments
*simultaneously* and making that music so amazing that people will listen
to it *forever*.

	Most techno I view as an ability to manipulate existing instruments
in creative ways- which is 50% of the sound. The remaining 50% is the
compositional skill. If a live band brings normal instruments onto a stage-
instruments that are easily controlled and do most of the work for the
musician- then I am not impressed by their ability to perform live.

	Bringing uncontrollable, harsh shounding, and rare instruments
onto a stage and generating sound enough to drive me into a frenzy is
very impressive.

	Essentially the instruments Orbital had can be found at any
Duran Duran, Michael Jackson, or Madonna show. 

	Aphex Twin however had stuff that I have never seen used on stage.
His Korg modular is the same synth shown in a Smiths video but besides that
his stuff was totatlly off the wall. Vapour Space also brought up neat stuff-
but his JX-3P is the driving sound behind Rick James.

	Many of you have asked how to generate good pink noise for
	sleeping. I can't even tell you how much of a difference
	it makes to sleep with pink noise. I will tell you the story
	of how I was addicted to it.

	when I was a child i used to wake up early saturday mornings
	to the sound of my parents wandering through the house. I was
	very upset at being woken up but i always knew there was salvation:
	my parents would eventually run a bath for my baby siblings- the
	sound of rushing water would flood my room through the wall
	and I would go back to sleep.
	I would do anyting to eliminate noise so i could sleep- as a child
	the only resources I had was a fan in my room, running water, or
	air conditioning.
	I would crave airplane rides and car rides and boat rides because
	the sound of engines would surround me and I could sleep.

	most of my life i used fans to make the sound but now have a dedicated
	stereo setup. heres how its done:

	tune you radio to NON-INTERMITTENT STATIC. it must be a solid 
	uninterrupted wall of static. no pops, clicks, or anything else
	are acceptable.

	turn DOWN the treble all the way
	turn UP the bass all the way
	turn ON loudness and any other bass enhancers
	turn OFF all midrange, peak enhancers, and stereo delay enhancers.
	if you have a graphic EQ: boost frequencies from 0-200HZ, suppress
	everything above 2500HZ, and leave everything else the same.
	
	turn volume to a level just below normal speaking volume.

	go to sleep

Status: 


	in my and only my opinion:

	FM synths are not acceptable as generators of sound. their
	sample creation rates and sonic control are simply far too
	primitive to make sounds pleasing to *my* ears. i am not
	a good judge of what sounds good and doesn't because I spend
	my working time and my non-working time dealing with sound so
	I have a very biased view.

	the resonance simulators or "digital resonance" are simply
	algorithms designed to simulate harmonics generated by the
	inaccuracies of a low-pass filter. As you know the imperfections
	of analog equipment cause a series of harmonics to be triggered
	causing that every pleasing sound that goes over my ears like
	melting wax.

	changes in filter and harmonics indicate "direction" to the ear
	hence created changes in sound that don't follow visual direction
	are a very pleasing sensation to listen to- no matter how often
	you indulge. like chocolate. but the fattness is sonic- not caloric.

	a digital synth can only weakly approximate these acoustic elements.

	the guy who developed analog synthesis works at the same place I do.
	he won't disagree at all. the whole nature of what he was doing was
	more of a mathematical exercise in music rather than a substitue
	for real instrumentation.

	but he rides a bicycle about 10 miles to and from work everyday
	so hes okay anyways.

They were intended to be given out at an Orb record release party we produced

could put them to good use.

"u.f.orb bits" features excerpts from u.f.orb. 5 edited tracks ranging in

Status: 


	ysh had a nice site this week, over by the troc,
	and i saw a shooting star outside!

	but sfpd had been by before this evening.  it was too
	loud, and YSH had been trying to accomodate, as far as
	i understand.  they showed up again, i was right inside
	the front door.  two officers came in the door, and 
	the following took place:

	cop: what is oging on here?

	ysh guy (patrick?  daniel?): it is a birthaday party for
		our friend, ****.

	cop:  it is too loud.  it's time to shut down.  who is 
		hosting this party?

	ysh:  the people who live here.

	cop:  who are they, i need to see them.

	ysh guy prepares to go find someone else, the cops (two of
	them, are now fully in the hallway about three feet in the
	door.  they are preparing to enter the house and end the 
	party, looking down the hallway very anxiously, almost
	hatefully.  cop takes a step further...

	ysh:  do you have a warrant?

	within the next second, with a jet black squeak of pure
	sfpd leather, cop half-pounds, half-hits ysh guy's chest,
	at about lapel level, and slams him against the wall,
	proceeding into the hallway and dissappearing down it.
	cop2, here the whole time, mumbles something right in the
	ysh guy's face, further intimidating him.  cop returns
	abot a minute lates, as like thre other patrol cars,
	both marked and unmarked, arrive.  cop tells fellow 
	cops to hang around, there's alot of people, wh should 
	count them, etc.  their attitude is one os snide violence
	the whole time.

	i am disgusted, no one ever gave them a hard time even
	after they began to totally (and violently) infringe
	upon citizen's rights, let alone was there *any* sort	
	of wrongdoing or bullshit on the ysh end *before* the 
	cop crap started.  i am disgusted.  sure it was most
	likely, in a court of law, an unliscenesed gathering, 
	devoid of proper fire exits, etc, but there is a process
	by which "law enforcment" and "the system" is supposed
	to use to ascertain this information.  supposedly this
	process is administered by "the people."  well folks, 
	here is just another little incident to further prove
	that this is a total police state and that "the system"
	only works for a select few.  when i appear to be an
	average law abiding white male on the street they will
	smile and seem like they are there to protect me.  if
	i appear to be a guy in a weird shirt staying up very 
	late at a house party then suddenly i am the enemy,
	a menace to society, and have no rights.

	so as i am the only wittness to this crap other than its
	direct victim, i am willing to file a report.  i do not 
	have the cops name, but i do know the number of his patrol
	car.   unghhhhhhhh i could just SCREAM. i feel like the only

	all of it, or else self-immolate myself on the steps of

	My first reaction is that you should sue the fucker's ass off.
I'd donate a bit of money. (I'm not all that rich, so it couldn't be
much.)
	Given that you're the only witness...

	So, they entered, after being asked for a warrant, without
one? I don't know the law here, and yes, as you stated, there probably
*were* violations [even though, as a libertarian/anarcho/capitalist, I
think those laws shouldn't exist] but is that a violation?
	There's the violence, but that won't do anything.

	Probably the most you could do is file a complaint against the
guy. Get his car number, as good a description of what he looks like
as possible. The more complaints the pigs get, about this one guy and
the dept. in general the worse they are, because they probably have to
make the number of complaints public and all that.

	The Cop striking you will be in serious trouble if brought to

	I hate cops. I hate people who want to become cops. I hate the

	Cops have to spend their days and nights dealing with really fucked

	This may have worked in 1955 but you *dont* get in a cops face 
	like that. This guy may have just had to bring some kid who got
	raped to a hospital and is in no mood for attitude probs.

	Here is the *proper* way to deal with cops when they come to your

	cop: "Whats going on here?"

	raver: "We are having a Birthday party for a friend. Would you like
		to come in?"

	cop: "Its too loud. Time to shut down."

	raver: "No problem officer"

	        concert deaf ravers are like smokers that

	raver: "Thanks for telling us that its too loud. Are you sure you
		don't want to come in and have something to eat?"

	cop: "No its allright. Make sure you keep it down."

	and then the cop goes away.

	this works just fine at serious punk gigs in peoples garages
	and will work even better at clean cut ravers events.

	if you say "do you have a warrant" you imply that you have something
	to hide. we have nothing to hide. if they do come in they will see
	a bunch of normal looking kids dancing to some records. they know
	the difference between things they need to spend time busting and
	things they don't. every time asking them to come in has worked for
	me at far far more sticky things than dance parties.

	Don't get in a cops face. They are underpaid and deal with horrible
	things and are usually assholes to begin with.

I agree its a very rare case where this will do any good at all.
But asking a policeman for a warrent does not imply thatyou have something
to hide as far as the law is concerned. I don't know what went on
or weather one would have been nessasary at YSH but in the US we are
as far as the law is concerned inocent untill proven guilty.

a very tough job but that doesn't justify taking there frustrations

You'd think that if society gives a guy a badge and a gun, he should
be just a little more well-adjusted than you or I.  He should be able
to leave that other incident behind and not take his frustrations out
on some clean-cut promoter, just because he's had a bad day on the
job.  I don't know about you, but the fact that the cop hit the guy
without even a slight provocation tells me that this cop wouldn't
hesitate to use other, more violent methods, with only a little
provocation.  

Just a few thoughts, don't take them personally.

But being innocent doesn't stop you from being arrested, locked in a

This is generally true.  It helps if you have another cluefull person to
go in AHEAD of the cops and tell anybody who is smoking grass or huffing
nitrous to put it away.  (Of course they know the smell but they don't
want to SEE anything)  If you MUST have nitrous at your parties, be sure
to blow up a bunch of heilum balloons so that you have an excuse for the
ppssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!

The thing about raving, is that I don't think it is ever intended to
be an activity that is in conflict with the world around it.  A rave
that succeeds is like a TAZ (Temporary Autonomous Zone) that survives
within the cracks of civilization, occuring at times & places that do
not overlap with the activities of everyone else.  If residences are
being disturbed, or cops on some beat get pissed off, than the TAZ
has lost it's autonomy and fulfills it's "Temporary" destiny.  This has
nothing to do with laws or justice. 

I also feel that "legal" raves can also be TAZ's if autonomy can be
achieved within the boundaries of the legally defined venue.  Let's
face it, the autonomy of a rave can never be absolute anyway.  All that
matters is that we *feel* free and uninhibited when it happens.  
Freedom cannot exist when in a state of conflict, and although conflict
can sometimes *lead* to a state of freedom, it often just leads to
more conflict.

Unfortunately, the cop had every legal right to do what he did. For
the cop, you see, was already in the building. I agree with postings
on here that the best thing to do is invite them in to stay and snack
awhile.  But if you're going to stiff it out with them, don't even let
them inside the door. Step outside the door, and lock it, and then
talk to them.

Once you consent to a cop being inside your space, you can't just
revoke it. Letting him in the door constituted consent for him to come
in and look around. It may not be what you intended, but that's the
way the judge will see it.

For those who are going to tough it out with cops, I strongly suggest
reading the NORML publication on how to deal with them. And keep an
attorney on hand. As they say, it's a lot easier to get forgiveness
than permission, and a lot of cops seem to work that way.

If you really want to press the case, mail a letter to the chief of
police and the mayor. You might at least put some pressure on SF
police to follow proper procedure, though by the letter of law, it was
followed here. (Perhaps with the exception of the use of force.)

Bummer. YSH was really taking off at about the time of the bust. It
*was* too loud though, to be in such close proximity people trying to
sleep. Nice space, a bit too much wattage for the close-by neighbors.

    Not everywhere in the US.  For parking tickets in SF the onus is now
    on the individual to prove their innocence.  They even have you pay
    the ticket before you get a chance to plead your case.

    Perhaps innocence and questionable doubt will become things of the

I'm sorry, but this has to be the stupidest argument for analog instruments
I've seen on the net yet.  To not like an artist just because he uses the same
instruments as another disliked artist is pure snobbery of the highest order.

I've been blown away by people using electric guitars, but I'm afraid they're
very common in most modern country bands.

It isn't 50% instruments 50% compositional skills.  It is 100% sound.  If
Orbital had drapes over all their equipment would you be crying because you
couldn't read the labels?

This is a smart way of dealing with the problem.
Presuming nobody's doing anything so blatantly illegal
at the party as to force the off-duty cop to arrest them,
an off duty cop is one of the best security guards you 
can have.  He's the best way of dealing with any police
that show up, if a fight breaks out he knows what to do
to stop it, and if there seems to be a problem with
violence having him there makes it a lot easier to
have real cops stop the problem without stopping the
whole party.

The second best way of handling police problems is have
someone who stays sober who knows how to deal with police
pretty well, and whose job it is to sit at the door and
handle problems there.  A simple smiling "Yes, sir, can I
help you?" defuses most irate officers.  If they want the
volume down, they probably have a good reason (someone complained),
so you turn it down.  It's not that hard to just work with
instead of in fear of any police that show up.

Hey, all you people in the Bay Area and beyond!

A couple of weeks ago, I experienced something truly mind-bending.  A
friend took me to a sonic environment in San Francisco call the Audium.
It's this way cool listening environment with 136 speakers, up to 8 tracks,
and this fellow plays way trippy analog synth music and samples and moves
the sound around and above and under you.  This was way cool stuff!

Anyway, we talked with this fellow afterwards, and he's really nice.  I 
was thinking that if we organized a group thing that we might even get
a discount on admission (though at $8 for a ticket, it's not so bad
even at full price).  There are performances every Friday and Saturday,
and it starts precisely at 8:30PM (he locks the doors after that). Seems
like the perfect pre-rave warm-up to me. I know he'd love to have a happy
crowd of people who just love sound in the audience.

What say, folks?

here is a bit of what I got of schiller's five media myths. 

Herbert I. Schiller - 5 Myths. There are mind managers in America that 
pull strings of the public. Pacify the public. Myth of Individism.
 
Mind Managers - Schiller
 
1. The Myths of Invidualism And Personal Choice = "Privatism" Ownership. 
Everyone has a right to own things. Comsumption. Appear to have choice. 
No choice in producing media. Not able to serve democracy. 
 
 
2. Myth of Neutrality. Doesn't believe gov't and private industry serves 
interest of people but rather capital.  Media coverage. State 
Organization are neutral and hold the ring in able to speak in a forum  
-> not. ... rather a fasade to serve capital. 
 
3.  The Myth of Unchanging Human Nature. Does not believe human nature is 
unchanging. Social circumstances -> interacting with others. Aggressive. 
Pacifies the public, and belive that they cannot do anything. 
 
 
4. The Myth of the Absence of Social Conflict. Failure to relate to 
economic rates of class. Dont own means of production. Examples of 
news-conflict. 
 
 
5.  The Myth of Media Pluralism. There seems to be lots of choices, but 
rather a small congolmeration of organizations that own the institutions. 
Example: debate over heath care.

I have the packet here.. See we are supposed to describe schiller's five 
points concerning the media myths adn then apply all of some 
systemactically to one of the media outputs:

(these topics are very broad)

-news (tv,radio or print)
-advertising (in any medium)
-images of the usa
-images of race
-images of gender
-music videos
-film

Techno musician tries to become a rock star and his act gets criticized
on alt.rave.  Rockstar defends himself with heavy hypocritical
attitude, gets criticized some more, then tries to end the conflict
with a final defensive, yet apologetic post.  Basically, it's the
crossover-artist-alienates-former-fans story.

 It's nice to know that this is still in existance - I went to it about
8 years ago , and I was impressed then. I wonder if they've improved the
technology since then?

 One thing , don't go to it AFTER listening to loud music , as there's
usually some subtle stuff happening that you may miss if your ears are

was goin and Markie had just got his set goin.  It was crowded

wanted to dance up there where there were fewer people.  I'm not sure who
spun (span =) ) before him but they played some very housey stuff that was
cool for a little while but he played to long IMVHO.  And DRC started off the
night with an ok set, though it didn't seem as good as other sets of
her's.  I just didn't catch that groove like I usually do with her.  Of
course she did open.
	Anyway, I'm not really sure what happened out front with the cops 
and all but I hope Daniel is ok and didn't have to spend time downtown.  I
don't see how they could have kept himor booked him.
	I wish people would stop bashing cops generally and just do it
specifically.  I know several nice cops personally, though, I too have had
bad experinces.  We must also keep in mind that they are doing their job! 
They are not making the laws, the people we elect are making the laws.  So
we must blame ourselves for all the shitty laws out there and we must do
something to change these!  If you can't beat them, join them.  Its much
easier to change from the inside than from the outside.  Become a
politician if you feel strongly about these topics, become cops.  We need
to do more than we are currently thats for sure.

of security guards is doing what Kurt mentioned
a couple of parties i've been at the security have gone off shift

and the whole nite their much friendlier adn know a lot of people
and dont mess..

another thing that i have mentioned before with cop dealings
is (if you have the time) to go on ride alongs with cops
talk to them, get to know them etc.
its just as effective if one of the cops coming to the door knows you
as if you were someone from their district
needless to say this is only useful is legality is questionable

Status: 

There will be a party called "dB" starting Friday Nov. 26.  The space is
really nice and it will be a good show. DJ's: Alfie-James-Josh-Markie &
Special Guests.  This will be one fat ass party, but space is limited. 
There will be more details later.
------

The SPUN CD.  I ran into Mike W. at Boogie (man, I was crackin' on!), and
got a chance to get the SPUN CD (these guys are so hardcore they were
dealing them outta the trunk...RIGHT ON!).  Overall, nice one!  The quality
is better than the Garth CD.  However, I do have some a minor peeve.

Putting out a CD is rough.  You get your set down on DAT, and from there it
is the waiting process (mastering/pressing etc.).  Meanwhile the music is
getting old.  I know the music becoming somewhat dated cannot be helped. 
But pleeze, 1-2 or 3 hits is just about all I want to hear, after that the
DJ should do his/her best to go the limit.  The Spun CD & the Garth CD have
hella hits, and that left me somewhat disappointed.  If a DJ is gonna spend
that much effort putting out a CD, s/he should not worry so much about the
least common denominator and familiarity (IMO), and should go for broke. 
Play some off the wall stuff.  Play like you would at your favorite party,
but just don't keep playing the same old hits and call it a NEW CD!

I would love to get a Wicked CD, taped (DAT) live at one of their parties. 
Keep on DAT taping the parties until the DJ gets to his best of best set. 
When you have the best set of a DJ to date, then THAT is what they should
want to press. I am looking forward to some CD's by Jeno & Markie.  I hope
that they stretch things a bit and do something original as well (not just
spinning, but some re-mixing, or some of their own compositions put in as
well).  Now that will be worth it's weight in gold IMO!

------
Sorry to hear YSH got shut down.  But that area (SOMA) is notorius for
residents making complaints (beleive it or not it is zoned
residential/business).

Hopefully there will be one next week.
------

The AUDIUM is great.  My wife DRAGGED me there, and the next thing I knew I
was loving it!  Great space, and it can be done (no dancing, just
listening).  I have started talking to some folks (notably Markie et. al.)
about doing something there. Good to see that others are interested as
well.

Met B. Ryan there too!

------- 
The CAB thang is NOT over.  The city can STILL file an appeal. No word yet
as to whether they will or not.  Keep your fingers crossed.
-------

Moby?  I really don't care to see techno LIVE (boring).  Dee-Lite tho can
put on a show!  The last thing I wanna see is some amped-up God Squad'er
banging and yelling to techno.  Just say no.

-------

Peace,
John

	Yes, they're doing their job, but it was a CHOICE they made to
pick that job. This is the US, where there is *some* freedom of
choice. They aren't being forced to enforce oppresive laws, they chose

	No need. Crypto will smash the state. There's no changing from
the outside or inside involved. It will merely dissolve, because it
will be unable to enforce any of its coercive laws.

Buzzwords aside, let's talk reality: (please note: I am definitely in the
  liberal camp- this is a reality check, though)
1. Government exists (conceptually) because "people" want it.  Really, this
   means that most people want some services and rules in society.  For
   example, imagine any of the following services, which the gov't provides
   (albeit not always well, but it's a hard job to please everyone):
 - roadways- well maintained, safe, standardized (ie. sign styles), reaching
             nearly anywhere you want to go, that are cheap to use, etc.
   (imagine what would happen if companies owned our freeways.  If you think
    it would be nirvana, just ask yourself how much cellular telephone
    access costs, and ask yourself how many people in this country can really
    afford it - your solutions don't count if they don't service the poor.
    We've tried that, and it's eventually ended in revolt, so that's not a
    solution).
 - defense- a million people carrying pistols won't secure this country against
            organized threats.  I'm not asking you to be as paramoid as the
            govt is, but don't you find it amazing that the World Trade Center
            bombing was one of the ONLY terrorist attacks ever successfully
            conducted against this country- a country almost universally hated
            elsewhere, with a very lax policy of entrance and exit and
            communication.  Try maintaining that record without some awesome
            intelligence... compare and contrast to the terrorism situation, 
            say, in Britain.
 - sharing- we all hate the way the big companies own broadcasting, but on
            the other hand, an anarchy would serve no one.  (clearly, this is
            one area where the net can help forge a better solution)
 - protection against organized crime and monopoly- only a centralized
            government stands a chance against monopolies, the mafia (which our
            govt is actually winning against, albeit very slowly- but as an
            ex-new yorker, it's simply amazing how far we've progressed), and
            other well-endowed, tightly organized conspiracies- which really
            do exist.  Just TRY and collect garbage in new york.  Just TRY to
            open a restaurant in Little Italy.
 - creating a hospitable environment in which to live- I've recently changed
            100% on drugs to a more Anti-war-against-drugs stance, but that
            doesn't mean that the crack problem is going to go away by
            legalization- we're talking about a substance which can addict
            on the first usage, which is cheap enough for your kids to buy
            with their allowances, and which is coercive enough to completely
            transform otherwise well-adjusted people.  Ask parents what it's
            like to raise children in slums- it's really hard to keep them
            alive, much less get them a decent education, etc.
            No neighborhood watch baloney is going to stop armed crack dealers
            without something a lot stronger backing them.  Unless, of course,
            the period of the Salem witch trials was an environment you
            care to live in, in which case this works fine.

The point is that to the greater masses, these points far outweigh the
  liberties and efficiencies that are lost in maintaining a centralized
  government.  And these same people are scared about your crypto-anarchy
  for the same reasons that you are excited about it.  And they are going
  to continue to legislate this matter into oblivion.  And their beliefs
  count just as much as yours.

What I would like to see is a drive to push civil liberties issues down to
  localities, and get the Supreme Court out of the abortion business.  If
  you then provide cheap inter-locality (ie. state) transportation, then
  people can live in the environment that best suits them, without giving
  up the benefits of a central government.

The problem is that (ie. anti-abortion activists) cross state boundaries
  and fight for their cause in areas outside their locality, which IMHO is
  obnoxious- if you don't live there, why should you worry how they live?

And then the parental thing comes back with but-if-transport-is-so-easy-then-
  how-can-i-stop-my-kids-from-going-to-<x>-where-they-practice-something-i-
  don't-believe-in?

And voila, welcome to the US, circa 1993^H4.

shirt. Quite a financial undertaking would be up for grabs, but i'm sure
something will work itself out.  one suggestion was to pay-in-advance.

well what do you think?

this message is being sent to NERaves, SERaves, MWRaves, DCRaves, SFRaves,
NWRaves and SoCalRaves (i thinks that's all of them!) so if the header is
correct a 'group reply' should send any replies to all the lists.

Doc Martin definitely isnt going to be there.. Markie, are you
aware of anything with this event? I'd love to see Deelite,
but - at the rate things are going..I'd be suprised if they show up..
Promoters should get called on this stuff.. If they really arent
coming..this is just plain evil..
People like this DESTROY THE SCENE.
Of course I might be wrong..and then I will gladly eat my words..

well it seems it would be the most stable and since that domain is HQ for
everything i cant think of any more appropiate.  anyway, if something
does happen im sure mail to the address could somehow be forwarded elsewhere.
it might be a good idea to have a PO box or something on the shirt so there
is a back-up and also a way for those not-in-the-know to find-out more, but
who is going to pay for the stamps?  however i cant imagine someone writing
all this shit down off some poor guy's shirt at a rave (excuse me could you 
just stand still for a minute? oh and by the way would you happen to have a
pen!).  really, the main point of the shirt it to recognize others who are
on the net.  it is only secondary that other people could discover the net
by spotting the shirt...

Yeah, I doubt the PO Box would fly.  Fax or voice might work, for
helping people get conneted: 800.NET.RAVE or something.  (I don't know
who would pay for the number--maybe 700 or 900 would be better)

The phone number just might be memorable enough that someone would
notice and be likely to call later.

I'm sure this will all seem far too commercial for many people's

Liquid Air @ Third Wave Dance Theatre 

 Finally! A rave that I could take shoes off at without worrying  
about industrial scraps , broken glass , spilled booze , or pebbles. 
The sound system was clean and loud, the space was clean and 
dancer friendly. The restrooms had showers ( which a sweat-soaked
couple used after the music stopped). 

 Weirdest thing was the large mirrors covering one wall - it was 
sometimes disconcerting to see myself bopping away.

 I'll let others make more detailed reports on DJs & the music - 
I thought the music/vibe combination peaked many times during the
3-plus hours of mixing. Sometimes the floor under the turntables
vibrated enough from some the dancing of nearby ravers to make
the records skip - maybe sandbags next time?

 Hard to tell who was "dancers" and who was "ravers". Most of the 
dancers who were at the place when we got started were students who
were already worn out from lessons , and had probably made other plans
for the evening. There was one guy in white cotten clothes who was 
checking things out for most of the evening , but I don't remember him
dancing too much.

 If the Liquid Air crew uses this space again , maybe they could make 
a special point of inviting the students , dancers , and management 
of the theatre to the event! Then you would have a large group of
"dancers" to interact with and maybe convert - although some "ravers"
might be enticed to take up "art" dancing after seeing what the "dancers"
can do!

Let me get this straight... the acts the promoter "advertised"
actually showed up, when the promoter never had contacted them?

in the bay area.  That man is more than ready for primetime.  I know that
I'll be booking him in the near future.  Anyways hung out with the SJ crowd
& smoked out.  I think that overall the SJ crowd is really diverse, and
nice, & overall good people.  Reminds me of my hometown.

Anyways James gets on the decks after Loren's brutality and really get
moving.  Overall a good set for that dark room!

'dB' is definitely going down.  But it will probably be the first & last
time we use that name.  The next parties will be called 'Good Housekeeping'
& 'Bug'.  So stay tuned as we move around the city (and change our name).

The info line for 'dB' is 337-4988 (415).  The location will be given later

It is definitely a subject worth much discussion.

Anyhow, if anyone could send me info on perhaps how to sign up for
such an e-zine or as a matter of fact, any info on where I might might
some intersting literature (other than FTP techno.stanford.edu) I would
greatly appreciate it. ;)

Thanks in Advance.

no, the bill signed last into law last week (H.R. 1308, S. 578) does not  
directly make peyote-taking, or any drug-taking, legal for anyone.  the  
situation is more complex and subtle than that.  (some states already permit  
the Native American Church to use peyote.)

my take is that the new law, described below, doesn't offer anything on the  
face to make it easier to claim exemption from drug laws for religiously  
inspired use than it was before 1990.  several churches/religions (Leary's  
League for Spiritual Discovery, Kleps' Neo-American Church, etc.) tried and  
failed.  in his 1966(?) congressional testimony, Kleps touched on the racial  
discrimination inherent in permitting only the Native American Church to use  
psychedelics.  it seems likely that such a claim must have made it into some  
of the court cases, and they failed anyway.  (anyone know?).

nonetheless it may be time for another test case of some sort.  why should  
the constitutional protections covering psychedelic religious practice be  
dependent upon one's ethnicity, or the age of one's spiritual practice?  in  
our current political, legislative, and judicial climate, the chance of  
reversing the policy established in prior cases seems slim.  perhaps though  
steps can be taken to maximize it.  one, substantiate your claim that your  
drug-taking is a spiritual/religious practice.  it may help if your specific  
practice is shared in by others.  two, since the state may claim a compelling  
interest in protecting individuals from death or serious injury, document the  
steps taken to ritualize your practice and ensure the safety of participants.   
other ideas?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're interested in the RFRA, you can get a copy of H.R. 1308 and Report  
103-88 from the House Documents Room, 202 225-3456, and S. 578 and Report  
103-111 from the Senate Documents Room, 202 224-7860.  


Here's some history, much of it (and all of the quoted material) from H.R.  
103-88:

There have been many state-level and federal court cases regarding the rights  
of Native American Indians (the Native American Church) to take peyote, and  
also cases regarding other churches/religions that wished to use drugs as  
sacrament.  The claim has generally been that the various drug control laws  
interfere with free exercise of religion protected under the first amendment.

"In Sherbert v. Verner [1963], the Supreme Court stated the principle that a  
neutral law that burdens the free exercise of religion may only be upheld if  
the government can demonstrate that such law is justified by a compelling  
governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of achieving that  
interest.  For many years and with very few exceptions, the Supreme Court  
employed the compelling governmental interest test."

Note that various attempts to use psychedelics in spiritual practice failed  
in the courts even when this test was employed.  The Native American Church  
succeeded, though with restrictions & hassles.  A case developed regarding  
two members of the NAC who were fired (from a private drug/alcohol rehab  
facility) and denied unemployment when they admitted taking peyote.  The case  
(Smith) went through the courts and was reviewed twice by the Supreme Court.   
In the second review, the court focused on the level of scrutiny applicable  
when a law of general applicability allegedly infringes upon and individual's  
rights under the Free Exercise Clause.

"In an opinion written by Justice Scalia, the Court determined that the Free  
Exercise Clause of the First Amendment does not absolve any person of the  
duty to adhere to a law which incidentally forbids or requires the  
performance of an act that a person's religion requires of forbids, if that  
law is not specifically directed to religious practice. [...] According to  
the Smith majority, the only decisions in which it held 'that the First  
Amendment bar[red] application of a neutral, generally applicable law to  
religiously motivated action involved ... the Free Exercise Clause in  
conjunction with other constitutional protections.'  The Court maintained  
that the case did not present such a 'hybrid' situation, only a free exercise  
claim unconnected with any other constitutional right."

IMPACT OF THE SMITH DECISION

"The effect of the Smith decision has been to subject religious practices  
forbidden by laws of general applicability to the lowest level of scrutiny  
employed by the courts.  Because the 'rational relationship test' only  
requires that a law must be rationally related to a legitimate state  
interest, the Smith decision has created a climate in which the free exercise  
of religion is continually in jeopardy..."

RFRA SUMMARY AND PURPOSE

"H.R. 1308, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, responds to the  
Supreme court's decision in Employment Division, Department of Human  
Resources of Oregon v. Smith by creating a statutory right requiring that the  
compelling governmental interest test be applied in cases in which the free  
exercise of religion has been burdened by a law of general applicability."

"The bill restores the compelling governmental interest test previously  
applicable to First Amendment Free Exercise cases by requiring proof of a  
compelling justification in order to burden religious exercise."

"It is the Committee's expectation that the courts will look to free exercise  
of religion cases decided prior to Smith for guidance in determining whether  
or not religious exercise has been burdened and the least restrictive means  
have been employed in furthering a compelling governmental interest. [...]   
This bill is not a codification of any prior free exercise decision but  
rather the restoration of the legal standard that was applied in those  
decisions."

"In terms of the specific issue addressed in Smith, this bill would not  
mandate that all states permit the ceremonial use of peyote, but it would  
subject any such prohibition to the aforesaid balancing test."

ADDITIONAL VIEWS...

"The amendments to Sections 2, 3, and 5 make clear that the purpose of [this]  
statute is to 'turn the clock back' to the day before Smith was decided.  In  
interpreting the statue, courts are not to look exclusively to the compelling  
state interest test as applied in Sherbert and Yoder, but to all prior  
'Federal court cases.'  The government's action or regulation need not be  
'essential' to a compelling state interest, but merely should 'further' a  
compelling government interest."

A failed amendment to the bill "would have set forth statutory standards for  
determining whether a government's stated interest was 'compelling' rather  
than allowing unlimited judicial discretion."

Instructions for International Interactive Genetic
Art

How to Participate

In order to take part in this interactive art piece, you must voice your opinion. After
20 people have voted, the votes will be tallied and the results will be used by a genetic
algorithm to create new pieces of art.

To vote for a given picture, click on the button to its right. Choose a number between
0 and 9 (0 if you dislike the picture a lot, 9 if you like it a lot). When the pictures have
been scored as you want, click on the "criticise" button and your vote will be tallied.

Once a new set of pictures has been generated, please feel free to vote again.

Note that you don't have to clear your image cache to view the new pictures, since
they have a unique name on every generation.

Interface problems

If you are running a sufficiently advanced WWW browser (such as NCSA Mosaic
2.0), the art exhibit should look somewhat like :




By clicking and drag on the buttons next to the pictures you will raise a menu of
numbers that you can use to change the value for your vote for that picture. The
"criticise" button is at the end of the last line before the pictures. It will not appear on
insufficiently advanced WWW browsers.

If the pictures on your display have a string of numbers next to them, instead of a
button, you are probably running an old www browser. Please do visit the piece again
after you have upgraded to NCSA Mosaic 2.0, or a similarly advanced version of the
browsers for emacs, windows, macs or amigas.

Description

This program uses genetic algorithms to create art (or, at least, pretty pictures). The
votes are used to determine the "fitness" of the pictures in the current generation. The
more fit pictures will be more likely to be used in the creation of the next generation
of pictures.

This work was inspired by the art of Karl Sims (Sims 1991) and the extension of his
work by Baluja, Pomerleau, and Jochem (Baluja et al. 1993).

Acknowlegements

Thanks to the guy who suggested the generation number, but doesn't have a valid
email address, the good people at NCSA and cern who wrote mosiac, and to the
frenzied voters at cmu, without whom the bugs in earlier versions would not have
become apparent nearly as quickly.

I was thinking along these lines also. Make sure the design is kool
and then add an e-mail address only if it doesn't subtract from the
overall appeal. When people say "Hey - thats a cool shirt - where did
you get it?" - Then you explain the net stuff.

One though was that you could have a design on the front, which was
either list specific, or had some all-encompassing name (if the lists
can agree on one).

Then, on the back, you could have a list of all the rave lists
word-wide (not necessarily including email addresses), kind of tour
dates style....

I like this Idea!  I want to proffer the name:

		CyberTribe 

	which I think someone in ne-raves came up
	with.  I think it expresses the unification of all of our
	respective e-list planetwide. It's a name that can be

 This is a great idea! An info email address on the back as well 
would be a nice addition , but I like the "tour shirt" concept.
Also - it would be neat to actually try to travel to each region
represented by the tabulated lists - like a rave pilgrimage . Every
time you travelled to a specific region and met with the net ravers
there , you'd check off the approriate email list on your shirt!

Actually, I thought Idol handled himself quite well on the Internet.
He took a lot of shit, and gave some back, directly with his own
account.  Instead of copping Moby Dick's holier-than-though attitude,
Idol took on a less pretentious I'm-having-fun-so-tough-shit approach
in justifying his selfmarketing techniques.  Anyway, Idol was always
a sellout to the corporate rock trip, while Moby, for some reason,
insists on cloaking himself with some raver and christian ideals that
only make him sound like a victim of massive selfdelusion.

I've actually exchanged e-mail with William Broad (B. Idol), and tried
to explain to him why he should become a raver.  If there's enough
interest, I'll post our little exchange to the list.

I think the only writing on the front of the t-shirt should be
"CyberTribe" (not too bothered about case).  I personally think it's
rather geeky to go splashing an email address across the front of the
t-shirt.... (ie i probably wouldn't buy one...)

Well (wheeze, koff), Andria and I flew up to Seattle to do the do up in Seattle
and had a great time.  I had never been there before, and I was happy to
finally see what it was like.  Damn cold, that's for sure!  
The party went pretty well, I thought.  Only about 350 people at the peak,
maybe 400, though I couldn't be too sure.  Interesting sort of warehouse space,
used for bands to practice in (in fact, one band did practice in one closed
room right near the ambient room)...the owners were jerks and were a little
antagonistic (okay, well, threatening to beat up Doran, Tony, Jon Williams and
Josh ALL AT ONCE and then saying "and from the looks of it, it woudn't be too
hard" MIGHT be a joke--it was funny, Doran actually laughed after the dude said
that because "I thought it was a really funny line" and the guy went
nutso)...but the party itself went well.  The music was brilliant.  Spun
dominated Donald glaude (I thought he was a little too techno-ish (lots of
bleeps) which i do not like all that much, to be honest) and then Doran went
crazy, Tony was awesome, and Josh was great (apparently--I had fallen asleep in
the ambient room; 10AM flights will do that to you).  It was a fun time, if
cold.  
And rainy.
And cold.  But I liked it, even though I complained (for humour!) a lot.  I
hope the people in Seattle had a good time; I know a lot more people could have
showed up; pity they missed such a good party.  

Well, gotta go--meetings...

Subject: Liquid Air @ the 3rd Wave!
Status: 

This party really went down beautifully. There were maybe 30-40 people
at the most, more than I really expected, but that's all it really
needed. There was a fabulous vibe there, people looking at each other,
smiling. Most of us were dancing. Exactly what I want out of a party :).

The DJ's all put on solid sets. Thanks to all of them. Jon, as usual,
was brilliant.

I really like the 3rd wave. It's a space that really "feels good". The
floor gives just the very slightest bit, and is smooth, making it
possible to dance in bare feet comfortably. There's a mirror running
all along one wall; it's really weird to see one's self dance for the
first time. I never realized I was moving around that much :). One
other wall is all windows, which have a decent 2nd story view of the
mission. There are two bathrooms and a sink in the hall where one can
get water. A lounge off to the side provides a nice chillout space.
It's all non-smoking, good for those of us who like to breathe.

The 3rd wave could support about 150 people, great for small-medium
parties like Liquid Air or YSH.

Thanks to Bryce and Ethan and Bob and all the helpers and to all the
people who donated at the end.

Finally, I'd like to say how much fun I had helping out with this
party. Some parts, like getting two %#@&& subwoofer cabinets up two
*$*(@( flights of @*&&$& *$*### stairs weren't so fun. But most of it
was, and it gave me a tremendous feeling inside to be an enabler - to
be able to help make it happen for other people. It's just an awesome
feeling. Try it sometime :).

I *thought* I was going back out that night but was too exhausted. Did
anyone go to Rhythm? How was it?

Sean

PS - After hearing complaint after complaint (sometimes my own) about
expensive events this summer, we now have a wonderful *free* event. I
really hope people start telling their friends about it. And the vibe
is a lot better than most of the Wickeds and Get Downs and other
packed events I've been to.

It depends on what one means by prescription drug. Some drugs require
a prescription in both countries. Others, like nootropics, are legal
to own in the US, but can't be sold. You can legally cross the border
from Mexico to US with these drugs if they are in "personal"

Subject: Billy Idol - future raver?
Status: 

Background: When Idol came out with an album called "Cyberpunk", folks
on alt.cyberpunk were very distressed that their precious term was
being appropriated as a marketing tool.  It was also determined that
Idol getting an account on the Well was just another facet of this
marketing conspiracy.  Idol eventually defended himself on alt.cyberpunk,
obviously having a good laugh at all the attention.  He explained what
it was he liked about the cyberpunk ethic, but eventually resorted to
telling his detractors, in the cyberpunk spirit, to go fuck themselves.
Somewhere amongst his posts he also spoke about how he wanted the world 
to be a better place for his 5 yr old son.  Reports that Idol was 
answering all of his email prompted me to spit out the following, and 
his meager content-free response followed a few days later.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Billy,
 
I've been through the punk and more recently cyberpunk/industrial phases
of music/culture, and would like to extend this opportunity to share with
you a culture that takes the best aspects of these cultures and applies
them in a newer, positive, and revolutionary way.  You may have heard about
raving, but if your source of info has mainly been the media, then you may
not understand the significance of this culture and how it relates to you.
 
Raving, mostly known for all night wild dancing to techno music with
altered states of consciousness, is certainly fun.  But the ethics associated
with it may some day lead to a better world for you and your child.  Like
punk, ravers espouse the we-are-all-equal and anyone-can-make-music ethic.
The best techno records today are being made by nameless geeks with
samplers & synths in their bedrooms.  At raves, there are no stars or heros
to follow.  We are the show, we are what's happening, sharing in the
sensory overload and the celebratory experience of being alive as we dance
to the fundamental forces of electrons and tribal rhythms.
 
You see, it doesn't matter if someone follows the President, a rock star
or a baseball player.  The whole mindset of looking up to powers outside
of ourselves is what keeps people weak and unable to take control of their
lives.  People need to follow themselves and the natural laws
of Earth and nature.  I don't want to preach like some deluded idealist,
since we all currently have to deal with things as they are.  Both of us
earn livings working for the dominant corporate power structures, and I
have raver friends who are parents as well.  I just wanted you to know that 
raving might appeal to the punk and cyberpunk aesthetic you seem to enjoy, 
minus the nihilistic anger, self-defeatism and power-seeking egos.
 
Although I have never been much of a fan of your music or projected image,
you have earned my respect by interacting on the Internet where we are all
pretty much equal.  This demonstrates to some extent your willingness to
step down from your celebrity throne and share yourself with the less famous
but no less special people of the world.
 
If you are ever in San Francisco and would like to completely shed your
identity and rave for a night, I'm sure my wife and I can show you a good
time.  The only condition would be the abandonment of ego and status, other
than what will come naturally from the ecstatic state of dancing with the
Universe.

Oh, they did!  But I don't think it's reasonable to suggest that we can do
  without a _national_ defense.  I do believe that there are things we can
  do to make it more efficient, of course.

In a crypto-anarchy (whatever that really means), the lack of a central
  government makes it impossible to expect such a service.

Status: 

Seattle Rave report
===================

Well,   it was a touch and go situation when I got to where the bus
was sopposed to pick us up.    It turned out that Martin couldn't be
reached to iron out all the money situation and stuff,  so the Green
Tortious was just standing my for more than an hour as Steve and
Mike were trying to reach Martin.

Then,  Steve came back from the bank of payphones with a long face and
I knew that the bus wasn't going to Seattle.    For a while,  people
were just standing around in total dis-belief that the trip was off.

Then a bunch of us asked "How much money do they need",  and I said
"I can contribute $300 immediatly,  anyone else?".    Steve's
eyes lit up and he immediatly got out his notebook to calculate
how much money we would need to pull this off.    It turned out that
we could collect $1500 immediatly,   but another person said they
had to go to Concord to get the other $500,   but the Green Tortious
wasn't willing to wait,  so when we all came back from the ATM machines,
the bus had already left.  BUMMER!!.

We had other options,  such as car-pooling,  but I couldn't find anyone
with a valid drivers license willing to share in the driving,  and after
partying at YSH till it got busted,   I wasn't willing to risk the drive.

Others talked about renting U-Haul trucks,  so we headed back to the bank
of payphones to call around for said item.

One of the riders then tried to contact the Green Tortious lines again,
and was able to reach one of the high ranking managers to assure him
that we had the $2000 in cash to get the bus moving.   By that time,
Martin had been reached,  and had contacted the Green Tortious lines
and finally got things squared away,  especially when Martin assured
them that we had $1500 in cash waiting for them.    This was done in the
nick of time,  as the GT (Green Tortious) lines were about to close,
so a few of us drove by their office to assure them that we had the
money,  then about 45 minutes later,  the bus arrived to take us to
Seattle.

The GT had a good sound system,  and we were dancing in the isles,
and partying all the way up.    There were about 18 of us initially,
but we also picked up some people from Sacramento area on the way up.
Total was 27 people including 3 from the Green Tortious staff.

Before going,  I had Emailed to SFRaves that we wanted to get together
with the NW-raves people who had set up a pre-party called the "PreFunct"
party,  which was really neat.   Hats off to all those NW-ravers for
being such wonderful hosts for our SF contingent.

The BASICS party was small to our standards,  as about 350-400 people
attended,   but the sound system was great,  the space was really cool
(temperature wise) and others complained about it being TOO cool,  but
for me,  it was just about right,    but I still had to go out to keep
cool in the 35 degree temperature.   WOW!!  weather up there was COLD
and MISERABLE,  and it partially snowed later the next day.  The SF
DJ's spun their usual dynamic sets that kept the dance floor crowded,
if not the cooler temperatures.   Finding water was a problem,  as they
had NO tap water available.    

The space was an industrial area and used for band practice space,  so
noise wasn't much of a problem.

All in All,  it was a WONDERFUL trip,  especially the Green Tortious
bus which was like a "pillow on wheels".   Everyone had adequate crash
space on the bus,   which made the 22 hour trip a big long "chill out"
party.    Lots of us brought our DJ'ed tapes,  so there was no lack of
good funkey tunes to groove on,  and plenty of herb for all.

Thanx again to Martin who promptly returned our money at the end of the
trip.  And sorry for those people last Friday who didn't wait long enough
for the promoters to organize the bus trip.

I am back,  fully rested,  and recovered from an awsome weekend of raving.

Cheers

Every four years, like clockwork, a few months before the election, they 
would increase
the number of affiliates that the big networks could directly own.

Is it any wonder that they always got such good media coverage?

Status: 


<whew>  Now that was a lot of fun, compressed into one short 18 hour span.

We set up my loft space for a small, welcoming preFunk, projecting 
visual input from a 486 and a couple of vhs decks against the far wall 
of the floorspace.  The mixer and platters were set up at one end, 
wired through a pair of Bose 501s from antiquity.  From early Friday 
evening all the way through Saturday afternoon, Cap'n Crunch called 
periodically to give us updates on the magnitude of the SFRavers bus 
trip, exacting details to the moment. Saturday afternoon at 3:00pm 
(though the arrival window had been passed around as 9:00pm), the first 
people started showing up.  Ian arrived with a couple of crates of 
records and helped me set up the turntable platform, Pat & Renee came 
down with stacks & mixer in tow  (thanks a _ton_ !)  Jess/Ben/Chris 
from Portland :) helped Glenn/Tony & Beth/moi to shuttle the newly 
arrived SFRavers from the NAF to my place, and suddenly there were 
almost three dozen people from all over kicking it and mixing together. 
 Tony, Nathan and Ian waxed eloquently for us, and Mike brought a tape 
of his visuals from SF and popped them in :) and everybody chilled with 
my cats, occasionally fetching them back from the stairwell (until at 
one point I even had one extra cat from who knows where wandering 
through the space).  Showers and zzZZzz were had by some of the 
travellers, and in general, we kicked it as a warm little group 40 
strong until after midnight, the departure point for...

...BASICS...

I didn't get there until about 2:00 (missing Donald's set under a load 
of logistics) and upon entering and looking around the place I realized 
that it was a small crowd, which suprised me.  With Donovan's kewl 
lightshow cutting through drifting foghaze & carefully placed blackUVs 
glowing on the grooving crowd, Spun was delivering on a wicked, 
circling mix and the crowd was _in  it_.   Later on Tony broke in with 
some phat, head-whacking music and started the crowd on their ascent 
yet again.

The most significant problems were in the chill room, which was chilly 
indeed as one rollup door was open to the night.  There was another, 
more closed room that Monty had used there before (at Shaft?) that 
would have been better.  THEN somebody had set up the DJ for the chill 
room in a way that intentionally _completely _ blocked access to the 
bathroom, the only source for water in the building, leaving us to the 
mercies of PortaPotties and the usual $1 bottled water.  That whole 
thing could have been done better, but either the visiting promoters 
didn't know what the space layout could have been or somebody up here 
didn't suggest an alternative.  Whatever.

Jon Williams, Josh and Doran continued to feed us phatness.   All in 
all, the party went off to our great enjoyment, to the consistently 
great line-up and cuts that _Basics_ has become well known for.  At 
about 5AM though, the crowd began to thin out noticeably which was a 
real shame because the mixing and music just continued to get better 
and better.  I suppose the afterhours which started early drew a number 
of people to its dark and cozy warmth.  I arrived there (the Velvet 
Elvis Arts Lounge/Theater) at about 9:00 after Basics and after a run 
back to my space-turned-crash pad.   We settled in for some 
decompression for about an hour or so and got back out onto their 
dancefloor, interestingly integrated with the set for the last show 
they had done (Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?)  Funky set, funky 
place.  I found various members of the SFRaver crowd there, and 
exchanged well wishes and hugs another last time before they vanished 
off into the coming down rain (a rather harsh front from Alaska).

Great weekend.  Thanks to all the SF crowd that came up!  Captain 
Crunch contributed endless hours of fascinating detail in his 
inimitable, unique fashion, and added a definite spin to the event.  
Thanks again for your perspective, CC.  We really enjoyed having you 
all up here as a wonderful crowd to have good times with; hope you come 
up again and drop us a line, don't be strangers!  And thanks to 
everyone who contributed their enormous help in hosting the SFRavers 
and more, for all of your beautiful energy.  Let's do this again!

Peace.

Thanks to everyone who came out to the latest instantiation of Liquid Air!
After a night of seeing/experiencing the dark side of raving, Liquid Air
really made me appreciate what a beacon of light the SFR crew really is!

Thanks to everyone who contributed time, money, or both.  We still haven't
broken even financially, but we will. Meanwhile, it's not a big problem,
since that's not our main focus (thankfully!).  Thanks to the 3rd Wave:
every person I talked with at the party *loved* the space.  I'll be
speaking with one of the owners tomorrow night, and hopefully will be
able to negotiate our return engagement.  Thanks to the DJs for turning
out solid, body moving sets: Tamotsu, who came on just a few days notice,
Lee An, and Jon Drukman.  Major props to Ethan and Sound Vision: that
sound system keeps getting better and better.  And thanks to everyone
who came for treating the space well: clean up was really easy. And an
extra special thanks to Sean, Larry, and Bob for helping us setup and
teardown: couldn't have done it without you three!

A special high point for me was when four newbies came to their first
rave: my two roommates, a workmate, and a good friend.  Daytime finally
brought rave to their lives!  I was also very pleased when 4-5 people
came on up: they had heard the music while passing by and stopped in to
check it out.

It's a real pleasure to help organize Liquid Air.  I look forward to many
happy returns!

Status: 

Friends:

The 5kW generator I purchased for our use at renegades is lost.  I must,
sadly, revoke my offer for its use since it's not in my control anymore.
I hope to have a benefit to raise money for a replacement sometime in
the future.

Meantime, if any of you attend an outdoor party (or a warehouse party)
that uses a generator, please be on the lookout for mine.  It is a 5kW
GenerAC brand generator with a fire engine red motor and black generator,
black tubular frame, wheels and a pull bar.  It has 4 outlets, one of which
has a receptacle for a three prong circular plug.  On top is a plastic 5
gallon gas tank.  The motor was manufactured by the Tecumseh Company.
I am not suggesting it was stolen (though it may have been).  I'm simply
interested in locating it and finding out what came to pass.  Oh, and
it has a provision for an electric start, though there was no battery
attached when it was lost. Also, as many of you may recall, it's quite
noisy :)  About 4 heavy duty extension cords and a gas tank were lost,
too.

I will continue to post this announcement every 6 weeks until next June.

	You should check out the graphic they used for their stickers for

Subject: Energizer: the rave from hell!
Status: 

Friday night, I lived through the rave from hell: Energizer.  I really can't
express in words the nastiness that I saw happen: it was all just too
awful.  This event was promoted by two fellows name Farouk and Sean (not
our Sean...didn't catch this one's last name, but I know where he lives!).
The evening started out reasonably enough.  I was told to have the generator
ready at 7PM, and the truck would come by to load it up.  They were only 
about 20 minutes late, which wasn't too bad.  Things went downhill from
there.

I learned that this was to be a break-in.  However, the promoters hadn't
even secured a bolt-cutter, and spent a good hour and a half casting about
in search of one.  Missed clue number one.  I was then persuaded to
separate from the generator to take one of the promoters to a copy shop
so he could print up tickets to give out at the map point.  Missed clue
number two.  The map point turned out to be Ameba, which calmed my nerves
a bit...after all, Ameba is an OK place, right? 

So, I take to promoter to the site.  No truck.  No sound system. No people.
Tons o cops.  I was getting a very bad feeling.  So, eventually, we find
a pay phone and try to contact the folks at Ameba to find out where every-
thing is, to no apparent avail.  After much screaming, interpersonal
nastiness, greed, and backstabbing, the event is finally called off.

We wander about a bit more, just to check things out.  We finally find
the truck.  I make for the back....no generator.  Truck driver says he
left it at the site with the sound system.  I check out the site extra
double quick...no sound system, no generator, no people.  I come back 
to find a swarm of people surrounding the truck, all very angry and wanting
their money back.  Promoter cowers in my car, feigning ignorance of the
goings on.  Very, very nasty!  I was very tempted to boot him out of
my car and set the crowd on him, but didn't want to see violence, so sat
and decided to watch what happened.  I also determined not to let the 
promoter and truck out of my site.  Truck loads up the back with angry
crowd, and ferries them to 7th and Townsend.  They get out and start 
climbing on the truck, attempting to get in to the driver and no doubt
do bodily harm.  They climb off and disperse when the police cruise by.
Truck proceeds to its home base.  Followed by four cars on the freeway.
Things are looking very bad.  Promoter still disclaims all knowledge of 
the event to these people.  Other promoter pulls up.  I make it very
clear that I want my generator and I want it now.  Promoters make lots
of noises how they have no idea where it is.  Truck driver makes lots
of noises he knows nothing about it, and further volunteers that he is
not involved in any of the games that people are playing.  I knew then
that someone had ripped me off.  I have no idea who, since all of these
people are liars through and through.  At best, someone was seriously
negligent.  I also knew I'd never get the generator or compensation for
it.  Bad feelings all around.

We then head off to the Oasis, because the other party involved in all 
this (TAZ) was supposed to show up there at some point.  Daniel turned
out to be there, which was a good thing, because I finally felt like
there was someone who I could trust around me.  We waited around and talked
and waited.  Eventually, the TAZ people showed up.  Erin, the apparent 
leader and someone who I had talked to on the phone about the generator
vis a vis capacity, wan't talk with me....gives me the brush off.  
Eventually, I am told that the TAZ people arrived at the site, set up,
the generator arrived, they tried to start it, couldn't, people weren't
showing up, and so they packed up.  And left the generator in the middle
of the field at 24th and Illinois.  "Not our problem."

At dawn, Daniel and I went back to 24th street to see if I had missed it 
during my search the night before.  We did find a mostly empty gas can.
No sign of generator or power cords.  No tracks. Nothing. (We did find
some cool found objects, though!).  Sigh.

I saw people be truly nasty to each other that night.  I saw people 
screaming at each other.  I saw near-abuse of women.  I experienced
massive paranoia and mistrust of everyone around me.  I saw naked greed
and disregard of others, selfishness run rampant.  It was awful.  Daniel
was the only person who was kind and helpful.  I don't think I would have
made it through the night without him.

My advice to SFRavers: be very cautious when dealing with TAZ, Farouk, and
an asian fellow named Sean. Farouk may be going to LA shortly.  Also be
wary of Josh of Planet 6.  If an event line uses the number 415-487-8383,
stay away.  Tell others if you can.  These people are irresponsible at
best, outright dangerous at worst.

Interesting; how did I get on this list...?  

Drug taking & religion: some cultures have established sacramental uses;
e.g. wine at Christian communion; tobacco, psilocybe mushrooms, and peyote
in various Native American and shamanic practices... 

...beyond that, all religions deal in altered states of consciousness; I
think the Western bias against using plants etc to induce same is the result
of a kind of dualism which tries to reject the idea that Mind is so
intimately related to Body (i.e. neurochemistry), despite the prevalence of
a materialist-monist paradigm in academic psychology and related fields.
Strange contradiction, that.

But anyway, correct sacramental use of plants etc. needs to be sharply
distinguished from casual uses; if nothing else, there are real risks
involved, which can be managed within a disciplined context.  

As for me, my body can't handle those things anymore...

Subject: My Trip Down Under (long)
Status: 

Wow.  Just got back from my trip to Auckland and Sydney yesterday.
Jet lag seems to be doing OK, fortunately the time zone shift is not
nearly as much as you think it would be after a 14 hour (nonstop!)
flight!  Hope y'all had fun in SF while I was away (sorry to hear
about the generator, tho').  Had a great time, partially thanks to
ausraver Simon Rumble, friend of Bob Jesse, and ausraver/ne-raver
Grant McHerron, friend of Laura of ne-raves fame!  Met and hung with
sfraves fave DJ Phil Smart and danced to Oz's version of SF Funk.  Saw
Madonna's Girlie Show.  Read on for more details!

First stop was Auckland, New Zealand, home of sheep, rocks, and
surfers.  Being there on a Tuesday and Wednesday evenings probably
wasn't the best time to explore night life, but I was still impressed
with the town.  Reminded me a lot of Seattle, sans sheep and ravers,
of course.  The town was plastered with signs for "Women's Night Out
II," a Chippendales-type event I gather.  And a friend pointed out
Auckland's best Friday night gay disco, but alas, I missed it, too.  I
did pick up a couple flyers for rave-looking events (Aqua-Booty,
Sundays, DJs Slip Matt and Bar Zeb; and Carnival, various nights, DJ
Justin Robertson).  So much for the Kiwis.  On to Sydney.

Sydney was a wonderful city -- I really felt at home.  I joined the
ausrave list after noticing Michael Dagn's post of a weekly schedule
for Australian raves on alt.raves.  A quick query to the list turned
up Simon and Grant with offers to show me around.  First night there,
Thursday, did a quick reconnoiter of the hip parts of town, guided by
Michael's list and my Spartacus International Gay Guide.  A quick walk
from the hotel to Darlinghust and Oxford street led me to the cool
shops, bars, and clubs to pick up flyers and newspapers.  Started my
dancing evening at DCM (Don't Cry Mama) a gay disco where they played
way too much Madonna, since her show was the next night.  Got tired of
that fairly quickly and stopped by Deep Thought, a new weekly at 77
William St.

Advertised as acid trance night, it didn't measure up on my first
visit.  Got there around 1:30ish.  Small space, similar to Zanzibar
with the entrance at the wrong end.  Only a handful of people dancing,
but kewl visuals -- more people sitting than dancing.  Music was fast
for my SF-based preference.  Don't know who the DJ was, but I talked
to a couple people at the door and met Michael Dagn, creator of the
Aussie list.

Not to be constrained by my own "too much Madonna at DCM" critique,
Friday I bought a ticket to her Girlie Show from the hotel's doorman
who ominously had an extra.  (I'd only asked the bellboy what he
thought my chances were for getting a ticket, in order to be able to
tell my Madonna-fan friends that they were sold out.  But instead, he
said the doorman had one.  It was a sign, an omen, I decided, so I
bought it and went!)  Had a fun time.  Too bad she isn't planning any
shows in the US!  After the show, went to a couple bars near Oxford
Street with some people I met at the show, since the rave scene didn't
seem to be doing much that night.

Saturday made plans to meet Grant and Simon at L'Otel in Darlinghust
for brunch and met a handful of other Aussies with them.  After
discussing the scenes in our respective stomping grounds, admiring
Grant's new brand (do I smell barbecue?), and drying out from the
sudden downpour, we made plans to meet up later for Cream ("rising to
the top"), again at 77 William St. instead of the big rave Insight.
Cream was described to be San Francisco Funk, so I was interested in
finding out just what that was!  :-)

After lunch, Simon took me on a tour of all the best record shops
where we got tickets for Cream (about $7 USD, as opposed to Insight
which was about $23 USD) and I bought an album from Aussie techno band
Vision Four 5 called "Texture."  It's even autographed!  The music
runs the gamut from hard techno to mellow vocal ambient.  It's really
great!  Also bought a mix tape from DJ Abel.  First listen gives a
thumbs up.  Thanks for the tour Simon!

After dinner with the Madonna concert friends, met up with Simon and
Grant already at Cream at around 11:30.  First DJ was Kid Dolphin
whose SF Funk sounded a lot like hard techno to me!  While the techno
was going off, introduced myself to DJ Phil Smart, who Simon had pointed
out to me earlier.  We hung for about 20 minutes before it was his
turn to go on.  

Many of you probably remember Phil from quite a handful of raves he's
played at here in SF over the past year or so.  He originally came
from LA before moving to Sydney 6 years ago, I think he said.  Phil
quickly took over the floor and brought the hard techno down a bit
more mellow and I had a great time dancing with Grant and Simon.

Lot's of energy in the smallish crowd, although there were probably
300 people there when I left, which made the place feel full and
happening but not crowded.  Met a cute boy named Scott doing E and
snorting Vicks (some things never change, no?).  Phil's groove was on,
but I had to leave fairly early (2:00ish) to move on to meet other
friends from dinner back on Oxford St.  I didn't relish leaving such a
fun party, but I figured it was my last night and I wanted to see as
much as I could in Sydney.  Unfortunately the rest of the evening was
less memorable, although it did involve a stop at at the local Micky
D's.  By then the jet lag had set in and I made a run for the hotel.

All in all it was a great trip.  Thanks Uncle Larry!  (Inside joke for
all the Oracle-ravers.)  Since summer is just getting underway, there
are a handful of outdoor parties planned, including what looks to be a
big hit -- Happy Valley 3, 90 minutes out from Sidney.  The saddle-
stitched 24-page flyer is awesome but doesn't have that greedy, slimey
look and feel you'd expect from a group putting that much money into a
rave.

Other impressions of the scene in Australia remind me of the scene in
SF about a year and a half ago.  Raves were getting big enough to
support a handful of big productions, some good, some bad, but rather
positive on the whole.  Although most of the ravers I talked to
expressed distress at how the scene is going dieing.  Sound
familiar?  Odd coincidence was that the day I joined ausrave was the
day Brian stopped sfraves.  I hadn't had a chance to read Brian's
message, but I didn't notice that it had stopped for at least two
days, because all the messages on ausrave sounded like they could have
been written here!  Tee hee.

Anyway, a hearty recommendation to visit the scene in Sydney if you
ever have the chance.  Lovely, just lovely!

Share and Enjoy,

Tim

Actually, I've been thinking a little more about what I said before,
namely I wouldn't like the email address on the front.

Actually, It might be quite cool to have "CyberTribe", and then below
it, in smaller type "cybertribe@techno.stanford.edu".

But having the e-mail address as the sole text is no good, because it
won't mean anything to someone who's not e-mail literate... (i guess
that's why i called it geeky...)

I mean, if you just see this (fairly long, and not very memorable)
string of words with some weird punctuation between them, what are you
gonna make of it....?  You're certainly not gonna know that the *name*
of our little group is Cybertribe, rather than this long unmomorable
string...

Also, the e-mail address should certainly be in much smaller type than
"CyberTribe"... we don't want to overly stress the stanford
connection..... that might be a strong argument for relegating the
email address to the back, since non e-mail people might otherwise get
the imp[ression that this is just some stanford thing, instead of a
world-wide thing....

I understand your feelings but "Tribe" doesn`t symbolize that to me.

For me it is a symbol of extended family where even-though you may not
be closely related , you are taken care of and loved and looked out
for.  Imagine what it would be like if the whole world considered
themselve one "Tribe". I suppose some tribes are patriarchial but me
thinks you have fallen victim to the very thing you wrail against.  If
you look deeper, you will find that some, (but not all) tribal
societies were in MANY ways far advanced over "Western Civilization",
not in the use of technology but definitely in the social realm.  To me
CyberTribe symbolizes the hope and promise of what some of us have
experienced when we go to acid house parties.

Hey I checked it out! It's kool!
I definitely think it should be considered, it would look great on a black
XXL T.  why don't you work on it a bit and post several of the designs you
come up with.

I really regret my original mail suggesting I wouldn't buy the t-shirt
if it has the e-mail address splashed accross the front...

This thread seems to have degenerated from

  "wouldn't it be cool if we did ...."

to

  "i refuse to buy the t-shirt if ...."

Apologies if i'm responsible for this rather negative attitude.  I
will, of course judge the completed design as a whole, and might very
well decide to buy it, even if some aspects of the design aren't 100%
to my liking....

For what it's worth, we've had one objection to "cyber" and one to
"tribe", but also a number of votes in favour of "cybertribe".  

I'd be disappointed if we dropped the name "CyberTribe", I really like
it....  (but i'd probably still buy the t-shirt, even if it didn't say
cybertribe.... :-)

I understand your feelings but "Tribe" doesn`t symbolize that to me.

For me it is a symbol of extended family where even-though you may not
be closely related , you are taken care of and loved and looked out
for.  Imagine what it would be like if the whole world considered
themselve one "Tribe". I suppose some tribes are patriarchial but me
thinks you have fallen victim to the very thing you wrail against.  If
you look deeper, you will find that some, (but not all) tribal
societies were in MANY ways far advanced over "Western Civilization",
not in the use of technology but definitely in the social realm.  To me
CyberTribe symbolizes the hope and promise of what some of us have
experienced when we go to acid house parties.


%%%%%% I agree with Geoff!
       I vote for a "CyberTribe" logo!

That was my first reaction. Now I really don't think it would be a
good idea, as it would put undue attention on YSH. And I think it
would do a whole lot more good for the world if YSH were to continue
than if we stuck it to the police.

Since he has impartial witnesses, he stands an excellent chance of
having the charges dismissed. All things considered, it could have
been a whole lot worse.

Your Sisters House went weekly for six whole months without having a
party shut down. For a renegade party, that may be the best record in
San Francisco :). I think we should count our blessings, be glad that
YSH will continue, and offer Daniel and YSH whatever support we can.

And it disturbed me greatly.  However, I felt committed (somewhat against
my will) at that point.  When no one could produce bolt cutters,
the site was moved to 24th & Illinois.  Obviously, no one had to vandalize
that site.

I haven't talked with the folks at Ameba yet (Mark, are you listening?).
It was reported to me that the promoters put a message on their machine
that they would return the money of anyone who produced a ticket.  I called
their number...no such message.  

Also, I should point out that, to my 
knowledge, Ameba was only being used as the location for the map point, and
that no one from Ameba was taking money.  To my knowledge, Ameba is not
directly involved with these folks, and is innocently besmirched by
association.  I have no idea who has the money, though I suspect it was
in Sean's hands.

Status: 

The '91 OED's first reference on "tribe" is:

1. a group of (esp. primitive) families or communities, linked by social,
   economic, religious, or blood ties, and usu. having a common
   culture and dialect, and a recognized leader.

We could be said to be primitive, yes, in our choice of music;
repetitive, tribal beats designed to speak to our hindbrain, to get us
dancing, to make the inside outside, to get us to lose our egos and
express ourselves with our bodies, to help us reach altered states, to
help us access our subconscious, and sometimes even to merely
entertain :).

When I think of a tribe, I think of a very large extended family. A
community with a special cohesiveness.

Cyber is generally recognized to mean "computer-electronic". It
represents the medium which enables us. With it we have attained a
remarkable level of community despite great distance and diversity.
Sometimes, cyber has a rebellious connotation, and I think that's okay
too. In a way we are rebelling--rebelling from old ways, from
separateness, from ego, from destructive energy.

I think "Cybertribe" is a brilliant name, embodying both aspects of
the culture we have created. I'd like to see it in stylistic
"spraypaint" in large letters across the front of a shirt. If I can
find an airbrush artist, I think I'll have a prototype made :).

Probably not.  I've been involved in several T-Shirt creations with
large groups of people (I play ultimate).  The best decision method,
IMHO, is to come up with a several concepts from the group, and then
make a ballot posting that would allow everyone on the list to vote in
order of preference for each candidate.

So if we came up with five concepts, the ballot could look like this:

[ ]  CyberTribe:	<brief description>
[ ]  VirtualVibe:	"
[ ]  ElectricGibe:	"
[ ]  HyperJibe:		"
[ ]  Hard2Describe:	"

Each subscriber could then put their preference (1-5) in the brackets and
then email it back to the T-shirt coordinator.  There is PD software that
can count up the votes.

Of course, we are short on concepts right now - how about a few more ?

Flame on:

Cyber--from the Greek, meaning to steer. Originally, a "cybernaut" was
a pilot (a ship-steerer, "naut-" as in "nautical"). Pilot now comes to
mean, pre-eminently, something one does on a plane, but that's how
words change, since people don't travel by boat that much anymore
(though Mark Twain was perfectly aware of "pilot" as meaning
boat-steerer, since that's what he did for a living, for a while).

Tribe--from the Latin, originally meaning a third part of the people,
then applied to other groups of people, their social organization
aside. For the matriarchally-inclined, it is thought, though I don't
believe a word of it, that the patriarchal Greeks invaded the
matriarchal pre-Greek ... what? Tribes. What the hell else was there,
then. Groups of people.

I don't give a damn about the T-shirt. I do give a damn that first I
had to include this new list I found myself on in my cc: parsing, then
in my To: parsing, and now in my Apparently-To: parsing, so as not to
be deluged with tons of mail in my inbox.

And since this is a flame, I don't give a damn who doesn't like
etymology. It works for me.

Flame off--and pardon the bandwidth, dammit. :-)

Despite the fact that "Cyber" is overhyped and overused, and
"tribe" has certain negative connotations, the fact is that
"CyberTribe" has been used over and over again in direct reference
to the Ne-Raves group, and occasionally in reference to the entire
raving internetworked community.

IHMO anything else would be artificially brought down to our
electronic community out of the blue.

Anyway, I dislike the idea of "licensed official" products from our

than philosophy ;)

Hello All,

	First off, i must apologize for not recalling the name of the person
who first raised the objection to the use of the word "Cybertribe" in reference
to what we are (my mail box is rapidly filling :).

I absolutely love the name "cybertribe" -- it's catchy and it's meaningful, and
it was coined by someone in our group. i don't see it as being 'cheezy' or
whatever, and i certainly don't see any negative connotations in the word
'tribe'. if i may wax philosophical for a moment, i believe that's the way
human beings were meant to live -- small communal self-supporting parties that
govern themselves and exist for each other's common good. but that's just my
opinion. it certainly sounds better than 'cybercorp' :) [ follow-ups via
vrave channel 33, please :) ]

anyway, another point about discussion and people getting irritated about the
traffic -- this is an important move we're taking here. if the mail bothers
you, just delete it please. it's not like this thread is not-rave-related or
something.

love you all,

about $8, and shows may be Friday & Saturday at 8:30 p.m.

415-552-CLUB Three Babes and a Bus
	This is the only regularly-scheduled mobile party that makes the
rounds of San Francisco nightclubs.  There's a party atmosphere on the bus and
they stop at about four clubs for about 40 minutes.  Special tours can be
arranged for groups.  Cost is about $30/person, which works out to about what
the cover charge would be for the clubs.  Price includes round-trip ride,
priority entryance, and the party atmosphere.  :-)  Regular tours are Friday
and Saturday--reservations required.  I had lots of fun dancing; I went on the
tour twice, and both times were different sets of clubs.

This sounds incredible!  Where in SF does this guy have his "Audium"?  If you get a group of people t ogo up I would definately want to go.  If not cn you still
give me this guys address and telephone #, because this is simething that I 
would definately want to check out.

One more question.  About how long do his performances last?

Well!

I've received an overwhelmingly positive response to my post concerning
a visit to the Audium.  I'm not holding information back from you all:
I just don't have the specifics with me as I post this message.  I do
have all that at home, and I will post specifics tomorrow.  I will also
call them up and request a group rate (possibly even a performance
specifically for SFRavers...they're nice people, they might do that).
Some of you may want to visit before we can all get together for our
joint expedition, which is why I'll post the general information.  However,
to reduce confusion in the minds of the Audium people, I'd prefer if we
had only one person discussing the group visit with them (otherwise, they'll
think there are hundreds of people clamoring).  And for now, I guess that
means me.  OK?  

Wow! I knew this would catch your ears!

I like the idea of T-shirts but have to agree with the comments that 
cyber is overused.  Also, I don't personally care for the word since 
it conjures up an image of cold technology rather that warm, happy 
ravers :-)  Maybe a better idea is to have a color T-shirt (I prefer 
long sleeves) with some nice looking artwork on it with all the 
list addresses worked into the design.

Hi everybodeeeeee!
I was interested in the Richi Hawtin / Andy  / Jonah party on Friday night
but when I called Gaia Mantra ( record store sponsoring event ) I got a
disconnected number.  Turns out theire REAL number , which is 
not what 411 tells you.  I went by in person.  The story from them is:
All ticket advance only, $8 at Gaia Mantra, 511 Valencia.
The party is to be smallish and friendly  ( what, no lasers?-;).
Ina and outs OK, backpacks OK.  Location in SF, to be announced Friday.
Their phone message says they close at 9pm.   So there you have it.
Now who knows more about dB club that night?

Hi all!

(1)  Anyone in SF:  come on out to Your Sisters' House tomorrow night!  It

        that much.  Also, anyone interested in those tapes of that .AU

        about obtaining copies.

(2)  The shi*t mail is isane.  I've unsubscribed from ne-raves and sfraves
        until I get back from San Francisco.  So, if there is anything
        you expect me to find out about via reading the lists, you'll have
        to either let it slide or email me at laura@soda.berkeley.edu .
	I have to say, it is IMPOSSIBLE to do anything in committee when
	the committee consists of about 500 people.  It saddens me to see
	that something that was meant to bring the lists together has
	served to piss a lot of people (myself included) off.

(3)  The mail site for Technopolis was having trouble earlier this week, so
        I haven't been able to receive any incoming mail since midday
        on Monday.  This has been fixed, but now I'm out of my office and so
        can't put out Technopolis until I return on Tuesday.  I'll explain
        the full sordid details in the next issue of Technoplis -- I'm sorry

Okay, I don't like doing crosspostings, and I know you are tired of the

I am going to start working on the 'official' Net Ravers shirt project.  
I will not be in charge of production or ordering, I am simply going to 
organize the people who really want to be involved in the project (at 
whatever level), put comments, ideas and such together and distribute it to 
the people who care to be involved.  Before I move on with the project 
(and at some later date) I will post what we are considering going 
forward with.  Anyhow..

Whoever is still interested in working on the project, get in touch with 
me.  I will try to arrange an ftp site for submissions, talk to those 
involved on how to go about production, design and distribution, and 
generally manage the project.  Email me directly at anarchy@eng.umd.edu 
with the word "shirt" someplace in your subject line.

Subject: About ComeUniverse
Status: 

I have nothing to do with the ComeUniverse address.  I just want to
share what I remember about it and clear up the misunderstanding.

None of our individual names are on this "mailing list".  The address
is a reflector which bounces mail sent to it to all of the regional
rave mailing lists, and apparently also to FNORD-L.  The purpose of
the address was to be able to *occasionally* send announcements to all
the mailing lists when appropriate --for example, when trying to get
input for a cyber(cough)zine or whatever.

The ComeUniverse address used to be public, that is, its existence was
made known to most people on the mailing lists.  However, after it was
abused, it was made semi-private, so the average jane wouldn't be
tempted to use the address to spark a discussion across all the mailing
lists, flooding everyone's mailboxes with unwanted chatter.

Apparently after it was used recently, people figured out it was a way
to reach a lot of technoheads, and they kept using it.

Well, STOP it.

Mike

dear ComeUniverse,  
    by sending 5 to 8 copies of each post, you have successful overloaded 
and ticked a lot of us off.  this unrequested violotion has resulted in 
turning people away from our groups, this upsets me the most.  
   to all you who get this unwanted junk mail which is unasked for, it 
might be useless to talk to the ComeUnivere creators, you can try to 
e-mail the system adm.  his name is Geoff White at geoffw@internex.net.  
if ComeUniverse won't listen to us maybe some pressure from the system 
adm. might help.  as for me ComeUniverse, please unsubscribe me and 
remember how you have interupted our lives(i had 50 messages in four 
hours and only 8 of them where different).  thank you.
        peace out. ben sunshine sims.

ps. i sorry to those who will get 8 copies of this post.

Leo,

So tell me exactly who is in charge of this mailing list which I know  
nothing about, and which I did not ask to be on.  I would love to get in  
touch with them.

And why should I have to put up with your "yelling"?  You only got five  
copies of my message because either:

a) You actually *asked* to be on the ComeUniverse@nexsys.net list (and you  
deserve this) :-|

	-or-

b) You're in the same boat as me and have someone else to blame for your  
inconvenience, in which case you might follow your own advice and complain  
to someone other than me.

Either way, I don't think I am going to feel guilty...

I didn't have your address until you gave it to me, you know!

Brian

Subject:      Vrave Badges
Status: 


Hello all...

WEll, V-rave badge production is up again...those of you who have been waiting
for your badge for the last 2 months will get it and i am also including a
free Meddling Kids badge as a little gift for being so patient with me :)

Okay, the badge itself consists of:
FRONT:  Early 80's style graffiti lettering saying V-RAVE.  The letters are
resting on a spiderweb-like net with several orbs here and there.

Back:  Funky 3-d textured background upon which rests letters drawn in the
style of Vaughn Bode saying "ADDICT" with a mushroom-like arrow pointing down
to the person's handle and email address.  Underneath this in courier font is
the address for vrave and under that is the slogan "GET CAUGHT IN THE NET"
                Both the front and the back are copletely hand drawn.
Colors available for the front have been reduced to your choice of white,
orange or yellow.  Backs are white with greyscale for all colors.

Cost is $4 per badge and includes a long ball chain.  Badges are of course,
laminated.

To order, send $4 cash, money order or check, your name, mailing address,
and what you want on the badge (name and handle and email address ONLY)
to:

     Meddling Kids
     89 Home Ave
     Providence, RI 02908


NO ORDERS BY EMAIL WILL BE ACCEPTED!!!!


I am also offering the meddling kids badge for those who are interested...

It is a pop-art logo knockoff.  It has a blue border around the edge, and a
field of red stars across the whole front.  Resting on this field of stars in
the center, is the McDonalds arches, in blue.  Underneath that, in black,
it says, "Meddling Kids" in McDonald's script.  Oh, and the background is white
.  I'm offering these also at $4 each and they do come with a ball chain.


That's it for now...

Stay fresh, kids!

  I don't think it's particularly useful in view of the confusion it
has caused with people thinking it was a new mailing list.  I meant to
ask people sooner, could we all please NOT use the ComeUniverse alias
and instead include all the american rave lists in the To: or cc:
lines.  It may be a bit more work, but it would cause much less
confusion and save the 40 some odd posts of "take me off this list."
(not to mention be much happier with people's mail filters).

  If you think all the addresses are too much to type the find out how
to make a personal mail alias or when you reply to a message just
include all the addresses in the To: or cc: lines.

OB T-Shirt talk:

  My personal feeling is that we shouldn't try to come up with a
collective name for all the lists, because few of us would identify
with an all encompassing name.  Why not drop the addresses and just
put NE-Raves, MW-Raves, SFRaves, SoCal-Raves, DCRaves, SERaves,
NW-Raves and what ever other mailing list names we want to include.  

  These are the names people recognize and they're the groups we
belong to.  Screw the melting pot we are more a tossed salad.
(forgive the analogy).

Subject: Audium Details
Status: 

I chatted with one of the owner/performers from the Audium this 
morning.  He offered us two alternatives:

1.  Commission a command performance for $200
2.  Attend a regular evening at $7 per person (with reservations)

He mentioned that a "command" performance would be nice, since we could
have an extended period to chat, view the space, look at the equipment,
etc.  That implies, however, that we need about 25 people guaranteed to
show up, or else it will cost more than if we had visited during a regular
performance (though it may be worth the extra).

Note that regular performances are $8 per person, and begin promptly at
8:30PM on Fridays and Saturdays.  Each performance lasts between 60 and
90 minutes, with a 10 minute break.

If we commissioned a performance, it would be best to have it in the
evening.  Other than a Friday or Saturday.

Personally, I would really dig a chance to have these folks' complete
attention.  But, I leave the matter up to you.  Please send me private
email indicating your preference.  I will post the summary to the list.
Also, if you could indicate one or more preferred dates, that would be
helpful. And, tell me how many people would attend, including yourself.

Also, FYI, though this has been posted elsewhere, the address is 1616
Bush at Franklin.  The phone number is 415-771-1616.  They are in the
SF phone book, too.

Thanks!

Subject: The Thanksgiving SF Rave Guide!
Status: 


A mighty Thanksgiving weekend is coming up - start by giving thanks to
the Your Sisters' House sisters, for their perseverence and half-year
of great parties, and to Food Not Bombs, for their dedication to
feeding the homeless despite persecution and prosecution from Frank
Jordan's Matrix program.  (plus our SFR sisters Laura and Tamara are
spinning! :)

Friday, jslee presents dB, with a great DJ lineup; also, Ritchie Hawtin
is in from Detroit - he's supposed to be worth catching.  The other
parties could be kool too; if I wasn't going to be out-of-town, I'd have a
tough time deciding where to go! 

On Saturday, Organic looks to be the massive it promises, while Origin
may be more intimate.  But don't get too tired, 'cause there's more
partying to be done Sunday night... :)


Looking ahead: combined Groove Kitchen/Wicked/Basics on December 11th!

Some of my friends ordered this and tried it.  The bottom line is
that it's pretty much worthless.  Nobody got off, and most people
didn't even feel anything.  It's basically a scam; if the drug was
any good then it wouldn't be legal, would it?

I dunno.  Try taking 8 sudafed, quaff some robitussen DM, and maybe
throw in a couple dexatrim and let us know how normal you feel :-) :-)

  I don't know if people have been following the media,

My feeling on Cloud 9 is that its some sort of gimmick
designed to skew Congressional opinion re: pending legislation.
The promotional literature leads me to beleive that something is definitely
amiss..don't you think? (full page ads promoting C9 as a "legal
herbal Ecstasy"  - ugh....)  Either these people are insane or worse..

Hi everyone!

After listening to my Exist Dance comp for about the 100th time, I
have to agree with Mike W. that it's probably the best techno/house
album out this year... 

BUT, I'd like someone to prove me wrong.  There's two albums in
particular I'm interested in... First, I heard Black Dog has another
disc out, and also I heard something about a (new?) Drum Club album.
Does anyone have either/both of these?  Both of their past work is
(IMHO) incredible.

Of course, don't limit yourself to these if you have another fave...
fer example, Trance 3 is VERY good as well...

Thanks,
-H-

I publish an e-zine once a week (a few pages worth) on the rave scene of
eastern Canada, with emphasis on Montreal. Sometimes it's once every two weeks.
If you are interested i can add you to the distribution list.

It is called Raving Up North, btw.

Subject: Unknown Turkeyday Story
Status: 


Yo ravesters.  Here's a tale to tell around the turkey table...true.

When the Puritans landed at Pilgrim Rock, they were greeted by Squanto, who
showed them how to plant corn w/ fish heads.  We learned that in
kindergarden.  But they forgot to tell us that Squanto, a Wampanoag, greeted
the Pilgrims in english, for he had been to London twice before they
arrived. 

"Yo Pilgrims, Big Ben still running? Where'd you get them rave hats?"

Squanto had been kidnaped by Spanish slavers, escaped to England, and
returned as an experienced navigator.  The second time he jumped ship near
Nova Scotia and walked back to massachusetts.  His village had already been 
wiped out by white-brought disease, so he followed his native tradition of
adoption, adopting the Pilgrims into his village, where he and others from
the area showed them how to survive.

Amazing, but true.
Happy Squanto Day

Subject: UK 'seen' report 3 of 3
Status: 

Hope you all had a pleasant Thanksgiving.  Sorry this took a while to finish.

In the 'clubs' section of this month's i-D magazine, they recommend the SLACK 
parties I reviewed in my last UK scene report and mention how they have 
replaced the TONKA parties that happened once a month until earlier this year.  
I did however neglect to mention the organizer for SLACK.  Her name is Debbie 
and although she lives in Sussex, she is no stranger to San Fransisco.  She is 
also a DJ and calls the parties she helps throw "Mindflower."  You'll find her 
hanging out with the 'WICKED' crew or Genesis P'Orridge (of Psychic TV) & Co. 
when she's in town.  She has long fire-red dreadlocks, is tall, skinny and 
very friendly.  If you see her, give her a big hug for me.  

The last SLACK party I went to, on Halloween, was a bit of a fiasco at first.  
They decided to use a warehouse that has been used for parties in the past.  
Unfortunately, after days of decorating, the police arrived hours before the 
party started and weren't letting it happen.  They knew what was going on and 
didn't want the noise to disturb the nearby homes all night.  So many people 
had dressed up in costumes and had been so looking forward to this night.  I 
mean, these are the kind of parties that when they end you start anticipating 
the next one!  Eventually word went around town to meet at the home 3 SLACK 
DJs.  At the last minute, we decided to break into what used to be a 
department store.  Hundreds of people showed up and everyone helped set up and
decorate.  There was so much space and the party kicked off!  What was funny 
is that we were in the middle of the shopping district on one of the busiest 
streets.  From outside, you couldn't see inside because of the 'whitewash' on 
the glass but you could see flashing lights, lots of commotion and *loud* 
musick!  Ironically, the cops didn't bother us here.  I guess nobody lives in 
the middle of the shopping area so we weren't bothering anyone.  :)

Rob came on first and played over an hour of old styley acid house.  I don't 
know how Rob found some of these extra rare tracks but they are a real treat 
to hear.  Why listen to seventies disco when you still have late eighties acid 
to catch up on???  After him was Felix and a guest DJ who carried on for 4 
hours!  They went into a tribal/funky frenzy that seemed to go on for ages!  
While some people lost the vibe others were lost in the trance.  When the sun 
came up, Darius took the decks.  Whenever he gets on, the sounds start to 
change slowly not abruptly.  His set builds and gets deeper and phatter and a 
rich tranced out electricity takes over.  His set is marked with crescendos 
that make you climax on the dance floor!  Needless to say, this was the 
redeeming quality of the night that gave me something to leave England with.  
I didn't stay after this but I hear it went on until midday when most people 
left and the musick eventually became ambient.

Unfortunately, I arrived in September when the free outdoor parties end because 
it gets colder and rainer.  This year, I happened to chance upon 4 times the
normal amount of rainfall which hasn't been experienced since the seventies!
So instead we did more indoor things like all night clubs.  A club I frequented 
last year, Turnmills, has 2 nights worth checking out if not just for the 
musick.  The first is late Friday night.  After SabreSonic ends, the crowd 
makes its way here until the early morning.  This was England's first legal all 
night club and was listed as the best club in the country for ages.  The venue 
is awkward as it's a cafe upstairs and a restaurant downstairs which turns into 
a pretty big dancefloor.  On Saturdays *was* a mixed gay night called TRADE.  
It opened up at 3 am and closed at 12pm the next day!  When I went regularly 
last year, the musick would build and get faster and harder until around 6 am 
when it would be ripping through your mind hard trance and hard acid working 
into some mental-ass hardcore!  For it's time, this was considered very 
progessive for a gay club where you normally hear hours and hours of house 
musick which is phat but doesn't really go anywhere.  It would get scorching 
hot (it was also known as 'the Inferno' to some) and very crowded featuring 
everyone from pumped up muscle men with hardly any clothes on to extravagent 
drag queens with their make up running and having a wicked time. It ended 
this year due to a change in the London club scene.  It was considered trendy 
to go to Garage at Heaven first and end up at Trade.  A new club called 'DTPM' 
opened which plays mostly trance and opens at midday on Sunday, right after 
Trade ends, and closes at night from where you could go back to Turnmills' 
other club 'FF' until 5 am.  'FF' is a brilliant club that plays more trance 
which gets a bit harder towards the end.  The two best DJs here were Smokin' Jo 
and Mrs. Wood:  both female!  Mrs. Wood used to spin the very mental hard 
trance set but ever since the birth of her child, she now spins progessive 
house/trance at Garage.  BTW, 'FF' is the name of a small thin magazine that 
has such a sinister sense of controversial humour.  'FF' stands for 'fist fuck.'
Just to give you an idea of their bad taste, at last year's gay pride parade, 
the 'FF' crew made a parody of the shooting of JFK with a drag Jackie O and an 
overly-bloody-brain-all-over-the-place queer JFK.  To make a long review short, 
I went to Trade's third year anniversary & closing party which played all of 
last year's classics all night & day long.  I had forgotten how fast and hard 
the musick used to get so much so that I had to run upstairs every few hours to 
relax, drink LOTS of water and give my body a rest.  Even Caroline, that man 
who everyone thinks is a woman because now she is and did the vocals on 'The 
Age Of Love,' was dancing next to us all night (more like falling all over us) 
which gave us a good chuckle.  Anyway, the end of that clubnight marks the end 
of an era.  We danced until 1:30pm and had a wicked time.  We were going to 
check out DTPM *and* FF but we spent all our money and as we were crawling out 
of the club, we realized that the most we could do was spend the rest of the 
weekend at chill outs trying to recover our collective sanity.

Before I left, I passed up on going to see Sven Vath for free at the Zap (a 
club on the beach across the street from where I was staying) but decided 
against it.  First of all, I realized that people from all over would be 
coming to see him and that the vibe wouldn't be as intimate.  At Jelly Jam 
records (owned by Luke Slater) I heard a tape of Vath spinning that didn't 
appeal too much to me at the time and I found out about an underground party 
the DJs of the shop were having called Abberration.  Next to SLACK, this is 
probably the best thing happening in all of Sussex!  It was held in the 
upstairs of a pub where Tony & Kevin spun mostly house and some tracks I 
recognized as being on DJAX.  There was an afterparty at someone's house 
afterwards that everyone was welcome to.  There I heard the most amazing 
funky, tranced out tribal and hard house I've ever heard.  I also appreciated 
the riches of partying with a small number of people for hours & hours and 
after that, going to chill out parties that last the rest of the day.  

As usual, my time in England was wicked and very much needed.  Next stop, San 
Fransisco by next year!  or bust.  :)

   I am curious as to the best rave to go to on Saturday.    There is
Origin and Organic on the calander this Sat evening.   Which is the
recommended thing to go to this weekend.    Organic looks like a
pretty good line up,   and I hope the venue is reasonable.

   Also learned that YSH was cancelled this week.  Whotta bummer!!
guess it's Universal Groove this evening.    Not sure I want to go
yet,  but am thinking about it.    Any comments on this Sat evening.

   I DO plan on checking out Tribal Funk this Friday evening phore
shore!!   I heard the promoter is new,  and talked to "Flash" one of
the promoters who has been putting in a lot of work into it.   I like
the venue,   but it's to be in the E Bay somewhere,  so check it in
the calander.

Cheers
Happy Turkey day!!

Heard a lot about Cloud 9 from some folks I know in Portland.  It is
purely legal, basically an herbal mixture.  A couple of 'em might make
you feel a little dizzy or whatever, but it's not the type of high
the ads shout about.  The costs are ridiculous.  Looks like a get-rich-
quick scheme for the promoter.  

I have no direct experience with the stuff, just repeating what I've
heard from a reliable source.

                        dB, the intesity of sound INFO

dB will start promptly @ 10:00 p.m. until 4:00 a.m. ALL are invited.

Due to the nature of our location there are a few restrictions, but we have
made accomodations to offset any inconvenience:

We can only have 140 people in the space at any time. If you leave we will
allow another person to come in (this is only fair), if we've reached our
max point.

There are no-in's & outs until very late in the party, so bring a backpack,
and whatever goodies you'll need for the duration (gotta keep the crowd
outside very low). Please bring your own water, juice, whatever.  Please do
NOT bring alcohol.

Although this party is indoors, we will have plenty of ventilation (since I
hate cig smoke).

other info:

dB, Good Housekeeping, & Bug are a serires of performances we are doing as
an artistic, creative collective.  Therefore we are asking a $5 donation
before 2 a.m. and $3 thereafter.  This is a very intimate affair (thus the
low max number of people), and want to present people with an alternative
to the "scene". There is no guest list.  

We are ACTIVELY looking for vocalists, musicians (sax, trumpet, flute, any
wind instrument), rappers, and those who are spoken word artists.  Please
have them leave a msg on the vox mail with contact information.

Age limit(s): none.  We are trying to reach those who will appreciate what
we do, and take things to the next level.

For location information please call the vioce mail #: 415-337-4988

Tonite: James, Josh, & Markie. (Alfie had a previous engagement).

Look forward to seeing you there!

Subject: RE: YSH bust/what's goin' down!


Hello,
	This is Daniel from YSH. As you already know the party was very kickin'
until the Stupid Fucks Playing Detective (S.F.P.D.)arrived. After all the fuckhooplah went down,and I was released from the big house I was stuck with a court
date for Dec. 2nd at Juvenille hall with charges of obstructing the law,carrying
teargas(actually it was an over the counter brand of pepper spray availabe at 
any hardware store),these were my charges I was told about.  But, After having a friend of mine who is a D.A. look up the three numbers on my citation there
is another charge,tresspassing.  As it stands now, the case won't stand thanks to all the support and to character refferences from many respectable people and
the organizations,including a letter from the county and city of S.F. telling 
me that I am to receieve an award on The seventh of December for "being a 
positive role model to youth today". So, they really don't have a case.




The great news is that YSH has not been brought up and won't be. Also, there is a civil suit being filed against the S.F.P.D. and the Seargent Bosshard who threw me on the wall and then before taking me to the station went 12 blocks out of
his way for coffee and donuts,No Joke! We're trying to get him for assault and battery, I still have no feeling in my right thumb and index finger.




So this is going to make cops thing next time before  hassling a private party full of people not causing any harm to the world, HOPEFUllY!


                                          Peace and Love,
                                                       the Acid HOouse Baby


P.S.- YSH is not slowing down one bit even after  last weeks incident. This week we have a Special Harvest Thang with kickin music(Laura from NYC is a must see)
call the info line for details. Happy Thanksgiving,I'm off to malibu for Thanksgiving,see ya when I get back.

I have a friend who spent a decent amount of time talking to someone who
deals Cloud 9.  The dealer would not say what was in it, but based on
what my friend knows about various herbs and what the dealer said, my
friend guesses that the main component in Cloud 9 is ephedra.  That's
right, Mau Haung (or however you spell it).  As Chris Beaumont can tell
you, this isn't a very thrilling substance (although some people, myself
included, have used it successfully as a tea for it's thermogenetic ??
[i.e. promoting fat-burning] properties).

In any event, it's probably not worth the money unless you get off taking
psuedafed.

The dealer also said that they had spent a lot of time and effort researching
and forumlating the combination of herbs that goes into Cloud 9, so they
weren't about to tell people what was in it or else they'd lose their trade
secrets.

I ask you, do you REALLY want to take something that no one really knows 
what (or if) it does, and what it is?  Well, I don't.

Yours for responsible psychoactive use,

Status: 


10 out of 9 psychics recommend that we all take advantage of this great
opportunity to tap into the current -pun intended- energy of change available
to us now.  There are 5 planets whose relative positions are lending us
tremendous support for CHANGE & MANIFESTATION.  A simple but powerful action
you can take is to make two lists.  One list is everything you want IN your
life, the other list is everything you want OUT of your life.  Be clear about
what is important to you, be mindful of karmic law (what we ask for is for
the good of all, harming none) and remember to include positive images (such
as picturing the closing of the hole in the ozone layer or a world full of 
people who connect in their hearts like ravers on X) as you burn the two
lists, sending the energy out into the universe to manifest.  The power
building since the new moon, along with the planetary punch and eclipse
make this full moon one of potent power and promise.  

by the way, you don't have to believe in magick to feel its effects!

this is my first time on...thanks to Comet for access to this and other
magickal realms...    anyone wanting a tarot reading, find me

It's unregulated, untested, and we don't even pretend to tell you
what's in it.

It kinda reminds me of that scene in Repo Man where Emelio Estevez is
eating something gnarly from a plain white can labelled "FOOD".

Maybe they should put these "herbs" in a plain white bottle and label
it "DRUGS". First "brominated cathinine", now this.

Rave reports
============


YOUR SISTERS HOUSE (Thursday)
------------------

  Was cancelled,  and no reason was given on the info line.    Bummer!!
I was looking forward to the harvest party.   So I boogied over to
Bizerkeley to Universal Groove at Thunder bay.    Carlos wasn't spinning
that evening,  and for some reason the energy wasn't quite right,  although
there was a few long sets,  but for the most part,  the sets were short with
frequent breaks.

  I really like that space,   as there are ins and outs allowed,  and its
very cool inside.    A different sort of crowd,   mostly University students
but not many SF people were there.  I did see Sean Casey and Gregore there,
and a few other familiar faces.


TRIBAL FUNK (Friday)
--------------------

  A "new kid" on the block in the rave scene just held a most wonderful
rave in Walnut Creek last Friday evening.    The $10 admission before
midnight with a can of food for the needy was well worth the cost for
a rave that was attended by about 2000 Contra-costa ravers.  

  Didn't see much of the SF crowd,  but some made the long drive to
attend.   The Darwin Chamber was really cooking with some fast trance
and hardcore,  but the sets were fairly short.   Carlos did his usual
funkey scratching without the helocopter effects (Which is good,  because
people are going for more change).

  It was held at the Walnut Creek armory next to the police station,  and
dispite the close proximity to the "Pig pen",  there were no problems
I detected.    The back area opened up to the outside,  so people could
chill out where the weather was very cool.   It was quite strange to see
army folks mixed up with ravers although I didn't observe any of the army
folks dancing.    Lyons did the security,   and no reported incidences.

  The space was very big,   non-smoking area (which I really appreciated),
and I really enjoyed the abundance of dancing.    As usual,  towards the
end when the wimps finally cleared the dance floor,  I had plenty of
room to move around and got totally crazy.    My left foot is now completly
healed and gave me no problem.

  I heard DJ Utopia for the very first time but didn't get much of a chance
to talk with him to get more background info,  but I did hear him mention
that he was from the Redding area.   He started to DJ about a year ago.
He came in from the promoters end of things.   He DJ's every Thursday
evening at a club called the "Zoo",  so if you're in the Redding area
check him out.   He like the DJ scene and often plays for free. 

   He started out a tad slow at first, but gradually the "Housey" sound 
started to emerge and he kept it steady througout his set until one of 
the tone arms on the turn table must have cought some dust and skipped 
across the record.    Bummer!!   But towards the end,  I was one of the 
few people left dancing.   After that,  I headed back to Mill Valley to 
chill out for a while and try to get some sleep, but was only able to 
catch a short 1 - 2 hour nap,  but it was just what I needed for Organic.

ORGANIC (Sat night)
-------------------

  The Origin rave was cancelled and the info line gave out the Organic
info number.    It was held at the "Troc" 520 4th St.   As usual,  the
people at the Troc were giving all kinds of excuses of why they wouldn't
turn on the air conditioner,  so with no ins and outs,  I spend most of my
dancing time next to the door,  getting in everyones way while I was
chilling out.   The sound system was much improved towards the beginning,
but the front speaker still had that obnoxious rattle and low freq 
distortion.   The fee was $10 before 11 pm w/ can of food for the needy,
but I was able to catch Martin while waiting in line,  and he quietly
wisked me and my friend in for free.

BOOGIE BUFFET
-------------

  One of my favorite Sunday Morning haunts,  as well as the EndUp.   But
due to the rain,  I stayed mostly at Boogie Buffet.

  Anyway,  it was yet another ravingful weekend for me,  and I'm glad my
foot is much better after Starchild stepped on it while in the bus coming
back from Seattle.

   By the way,  I assume the FMR was cancelled,  but I sure got a lot of
calls from people asking about it.   If anyone went,  would appreciate
a report.

   Also,  I would like to atend a rave on the 17th of Dec in Austin.   Does
anyone know of any events scheduled at that time?

Thanx all...

But to be fair, I doubt that any of the ravers enlisted into the army.

You are very lucky that the army didn't take you into custody.
If the energy of Captain Crunch fell into the wrong hands, the 
world would be in big trouble.

Did he give you any cans of food on the way out?

Gee, my head hurts.  I think I'll get Starchild to step on it.

YEs the new Black Dog is mighty good.  I think that it is better than their
'Bytes' album on WARP.  I did not like that album that much at all, and most
people I know agree with me on that.  But their new album is definately worth 
buying for any record collection.  As for Drum Club I have heard nothing. .

Why do you think they call it "Drum Club"?  Would you expect anything
different?  =)

Sounds like it could be great to mix with, though!

the Drum Club's album "everything is now" is actually some very nice
mellow dance music.  most of the stuff i've heard of theirs hasn't
been all that heavy on the percussion, actually.  they got their name
from a club that the two members DJ'd at.

I find most of the releases from the Drum Club uninspiring. They tend
towards two poles--tweeked out wierdness, which is cool, but then the
tracks are usually sucking the big one in the rhythm department, which is,
unfortunately, what you need to make people dance. On the other end, they
also do bland house numbers, like the latest release, that sounds
generically "progressive" and boring--even Darren Emerson/Underworld
couldn't salvage it in the remix.  I just can't picture myself or other
people moving to that type of music. The only exception, IMHO, is the
remix of the Psychic Warriors ov Gaia's "Exit 23" that was released early
this year. It's strange, hypnotic AND kicks ass on a good sound system. 

My $2/100.

Subject: new CD: "California Dreaming"
Status: 


A new CD that showcases various techno/trance/ambient artists from California
has been released on FFRR Records (in both the US and the UK).  This CD has
major label distribution, so just about any record store should be able to
order it.


Various Artists - "California Dreaming"
FFRR Records (catalog number: 697-124-002-2)

 1  6:49 Tranquility Bass - "Cantamilla" (Exist Dance Records)
 2 12:02 Elements of Trance - "A Taste of Your Own Medicine" (C-Level Records)
 3  8:24 Hawke - "3 Nudes Having Sax on Acid" (Hardkiss Music)
 4  5:28 Island Universe - "Energize" (Trip & Spin Records)
 5  5:00 Aquatherium - "Feelin' Real Good" (TCX Records)
 6  9:41 Single Cell Orchestra - "Transmit Liberation" (Zoe Magik Records)
 7  6:14 Young American Primitive - "The Reality of Nature" (Zoe Magik Records)
 8  7:35 Up Above the World - "Straight Up Caffeine" (Exist Dance Records)
 9  8:38 Daisy Glow - "Theme From Daisy Glow" (Zoe Magik Records)
10  5:28 The Ultraviolet Catastrophe - "Funk You Very Much" (Hardkiss Music)


Factoids:

Track 7 is the original version of "Nature", which was remixed by Jim Hopkins
for Twitch Volume 6 and Twitch CD #4.  Track 8 is the original version of
"Unleashed in the East", which was remixed by The Ultraviolet Catastrophe
for Twitch Volume 11 and Twitch CD #8.  Track 10 is a remix of "Trip Harder",
which was originally released as a Twitch 12" single and on Twitch CD #6.


Review:

I can't be very objective about this compilation because I and my associates
were involved with too many of the tracks on it.  All I will say is that if
you like the current Twitch releases, you will probably like this compilation,
too.

Here is a review of this CD that was printed in Issue #7 of XLR8R magazine...

    For a taste of Exist Dance and other California beat generators,
    you are advised to look out for the "California Dreaming" compilation,
    out now on FFRR Records, and said to document "a vibrant kaleidoscope
    of dance music born of a federation of young Westcoast talent, blending
    the stoned sensibilities that electrified the wild ride of the 60's
    with the most advanced technology coming out of the Silicon Valley
    in the 90's."  Contributions vary, from the quality inspired sounds
    of Tranquility Bass, Single Cell Orchestra, Up Above the World, and
    Ultraviolet Catastrophe, to the slightly lame energy of Hawke, Daisy
    Glow, and Young American Primitive.  Overall a fine compilation that
    may be a little over-hyped, "California Dreaming" is so far the best
    of the west, churning out a unique fusion of ambient psychedelia and
    techno intensity.

comfortably filled the 41 Freelon St. space with people who knew what
it's all about.  Alex took right up to the edge with spacey-trancey
sounds rarely heard at larger parties before Richie kicked in with his
own higher-bpm brew.  Jonah took over and brought things to an ambient
close about 6 am.  Good, not overloud sound, more visuals than I
thought the space could handle, a carpeted chill area upstairs, free
water, in-n-outs OK, and the highest smile-back quotient since the
Floppy parties.  Big eyes all round. Yowsa.

	I haven't been impressed enough with the Drum Club to plunk down
for any of theirs.  They do a rad enough remix on Ege Bam Yasi's
'Variations' but their track on 'Trance Europe Express' is downright weak.
 I've flipped through their album at KALX, and it has a coupla spacey
beatless parts that I can get into.  Their music strikes me as a confused
attempt to please too many people.  Of course, that's got to be my own
biggest shortcoming when it comes to buying records, next to my bad habit
of sleeping on classics when it seems like they're going to blow up and get
played to death.  Anybody want to put me to work?  Will dj for djing's
sake alone!
	Black Dog's 'Temple of Transparent Balls' sounds rad indeed.  All
the excellent and tricky percussion of 'Bytes', but minus the startrekky
melodies.
	PWOG's 'Psychick Rhythms' is fierce!  The sounds on it are total
electro (the congas sound like presets from a Dr. Rhythm 550), but the 
effect is full and deep body trance, far more authentic and moving than 
any of the shameless world music pillaging that gets labeled tribal these
days.
	'Madreporic Plate' is definitely the disk to get, of Aphex Twin's
latest two.  The dance mixes are dancier, and the experimental ones are
way the fuck out.  One is pure tones, and the other is a xylophonic insect
rampage.
	Hi-Ryze's single on Brain records is right on the money.  Their
beats are punchy and crisp, and have this way of catching and tripping over
themselves before landing in exactly the right place, and the synths are
nerdy and fun in the raddest of ways.
	'Veggie Grooves' is one Lee An hipped me to.  This is the weirdest
dance record I've heard in ages.  Not one of these tracks will sit still
and do what it's s'posed to.  A mutant concoction of disco, house,
stand-up bass, and sinister bleep noodlings.
	The 'Duck/Philth' single on SubConscious is another strange one --
sounds off at 33 or 45.  I like it on 33 -- there's a lot going on, and
you can sort it out better from there.  Anyhow, I heard Skinny Puppy's
Cevin Key was going by the name Duck.  Anybody got the skinny on this?
	Tune me in on KALX 90.7fm Sat/Sun 1-3:30 AM if you want to hear some
of these -- it's usually good driving around music, between sound systems.

i had a very different impression.  the space was definitely nice, no
question.  but the music really bored me.  minimal acid trance is ok
but i can't take it for more than 20 mins at a time.  and richie's
fast stuff got monotonous pretty quick.  i left before jonah came on.

as for the smile-back, this is probably my biggest difference in
perception... i thought the crowd was completely unfriendly (except
for the sfravers, of course.)  never have i felt more alone in a room
full of people.  not only no smile-back, but not even any eye contact.

There's a store here in Sacramento having a sale. They have a Gemini
PMX 2000 for $300 and a Numark PM1145 (i think) for $350. How do they
compare in durability and sound quality? Which ones do the DJs like?

Please let me know, as I'm probably going to get one of these.

I don't know anything about these particular models, but in general
Numark products are superior to Gemini products for both durability and
sound quality.

hi folx,
well, i did go to this and had a really good time. saw bob c and couple
other sfravers. the musick was hard trance/tekno. liked the selection,
taking us on higher planes, bringing us down, then up again. the place was
pretty well illuminated, anice departure from the usual dark, cavernous
rooms i 've been to lately. there were also some pictures on the walls of
'2001,' organisms growing and some tekno-logical type thingies, appearently
from japan. very stimulating in the context. the crowd was small and friendly.
all in all a good party. my only complaint was that it ended early, at 5:30.

I disagree with regards to the Drum Club.  I think their album is
definitly one of the best of '93, all great tracks no filler, much
better than than the new Black Dog album IMO.  The sound system
remixes they put out recently aren't the greatest but they're still
pretty good, and the mixes they did for Psychick Warriors and Lush are
wonderfull.  It might not be your cup of tea, but you should definitly
give the album a second listen.

I have a Numark 1760 which I like: simple, straightforward controls, heavy
duty, high quality electronics. However, it does have a couple of drawbacks
which are really bugging me lately:
 * No Monitor (booth) out/level; requires tweeeking at amp (no fun)
 * Insufficient Headphone amping (can't here what you're cueing :()

A friend has a nifty Gemini, don't know the model number, that solves both
of the above problems in addition to having left/right (separate) EQs and
an 8bit, 8 second sampler. Durability, and grade of parts would be my only
questions, however I've used it and liked it; kinda wishing I had one...

Anyway, that's my $.02  :)

see ya

I was wondering if anyone was going to go to the Survival Research Labs 
on Wednesday at the Paradise Lounge.

For those that do not know about SRL.

It is a group of people that build full sized auto-mated cyborgs.  Or what 
ever you want to call them.  But they buid fully sized remote control creatures.
These creatures are fully equiped with flame throwers, bombs, and other
destructive devices. What they usually do is get a wherhouse or junk yard and
have the cyborgs fight and destroy each other.  From what I hear they put on
really live shows.  

My friend told me that they are permnantly from doing shows in Holland.  He said
that last time the did a show in Amstredam there was so much energy generated
from the show that there was a riot afterwards.  

Unfortunately there is not going to be a live show, but they are going to show 
video's of past performances.  Afterward there is going to be DJ's and dancing.
I think that this is a preview for a future live show somewhere in the Bay Area.

I have been unable to find a ride as of yet.  I live in Berkeley and if anyone
is going or plans to go please call me if you have space in your automobile.

Status: 

I would have to argee with you that the energy at the Nov 26 was very good.
Most of the people who attended were truly happy and energetic at heart.  I
don't think that there were that many people who were fucked on mind altering 
drugs.  Instead there were people who could smile naturally.  People who could 
smoke a spliff or drink a brew and still dance and give off great amounts of 
enrgy.  People who were there for the music and could appreciate the music.

The reason the event was so underpublicized was because they did not want 
1000 people showing up and overcrowding the wherhouse.  I think they also 
wanted to keep the crowd tight and gather a group of realy positive people.  
Rather than gathering mulltitudes of people who were just there to be fucked up
Really good party overall. . 

Oh by the way it was Jonah's party and not Gaia Mantra's.  GM just sold tickets
for him.

Those paintings of sea-anenomes, psychedelic faces, and other trippy stuff were
not from Japan but from the painter Iona Scott.  She also did the metallic 
sculpture that was hanging from the ceiling over the dance floor.  She is a goodartist.  Her work is always on display at Gaia Mantra records( as long as it is not being used at a party)
 
I agree full force with you.  My two thumbs up to Jonah.

and we should not underestimate how much of it is being converted to
C02 by the Captain's metabolism.  Scientists might also want to consider

			December 15th, TASTE Presents:
		R&S, Global Cuts, Astralwerks Recording Artist

			      C A P R I C O R N

			Plus DJ Reese from Astralwerks
		    and DJ Abraxis from Fierce Ruling Diva
	    XDZebra will more than likely put in an appearance :-)

			 $10 at Playscool 346 W 600 S
		     For more details phone 801-461-3375
				       
There is also an afterhours going on at Playschool every Friday and Saturday,
from 12:00 midnight to usually around sixish a.m.ish.  The cost is $5.  I DJ
Fridays 12:00 to 2:00 and Saturdays 3:00 to 6:00.  However, there is some
speculation in my own mind as to how much longer I will do this.  It is
starting to seriously burn me out and I want my Saturdays and Sundays (DAYS)
back instead of on my back.

Mechanized will be having a rave on the 18th.  Their store number is
801-595-1347.  It will feature Mark E. Quark (par usual) and DJ Mechanized in
the main room.  I'll probably be working the ambient room with Snuffy.  I
believe the cost for this is $10 as well.

Another promoter is bringing in Carlos sometime this month, but the guy is a
bit of a goofball.  His raves usually tend to be of the hunter-gatherer T99/2
Unlimited type.

Finally, "Mountain Raves" mailing list will be online soon.  I hope I can get
the software installed within the next day or so.  However, I'm busy promoting
"Black Market Flowers/Gnome" (normal concert, not rave related) for this
Friday, as well as the Capricorn show, so no guarantees.

	Well, for all you folks out there who want to risk

	The DJs will be 
	TONY,GARTH,SIMON,JENO
	$5.00 (an absolute bargan)

	I'm not sure what time the doors open but if you get there by
	midnight that should be good enough.  You might want to do like
	Lee and set your clock to wake up at around 2 am and go then.
	In any event, most of the evening is mainly a warm-up for what
	happens between 4 and 6 a.m. so you should really try to last
	that long or you might miss the experience that you hear so
	many people raving (pun intended :-) about.

	This party is put on by Malachy, the person who was injured in
	a car accident last year.  He was at the last party, wheel-chair
	and all, and the Vibe was incredible.  His parties have always 
	renewed my faith in the Scene. The smile ratio should be high.

YOHIMBE BARK

Family: Rubiaceae
Genus: Corynanthe
Species: yohimbe

Usage: 6-10 teaspoons of shaved bark are boiled 10 minutes in 1 pt. water,
strained and sipped slowly.  Addition of 500 mg of vitamin C per cup makes it
take effect more quickly and potently (probably by forming easily assimilated
ascorbates of the alkaloids).  Bark can also be smoked.  Yohimbine
hydrochloride, a refined powder version, can also be snuffed.  Also available
at many health/herb stores is a liquid extract.

Effects: Called "the most potent aphrodisiac known" and "the only true
aphrodisiac".  Whether aphrodisiacs exist outside of mythology or not is a
topic for debate, as is the definition of "aphrodisiac".  Anyway, first
effects after 30 minutes (sooner with vitamin C) consist of warm, pleasant
spinal shivers, followed by psychic stimulation, heightening of emotional and
sexual feelings, mild perceptual changes without hallucinations, sometimes
spontaneous erections.  Some experience nausea during first 30 minutes.
Sexual activity is especially pleasurable.  According
to one source "Bantu orgies have been known to last over a week" [Ed: don't
they get hungry?].  Total experience lasts 2-4 hours, however, several
experiences lasting up to 24 hours have been reported.  Aftereffects include
pleasant, relaxed feelings with no hangover, but difficulty sleeping for
a few hours (probably largely due to the increased mental activity).

Since they sell the stuff in health food stores and I'm not sure what it's
legitimate uses are, I'm willing to admit that I've tried it.  My experience
was worth repeating.  This of course constitutes no endorsement on my part of
illegal or legal drugs or of the use of yohimbe for any reason at all.

I ground about 7 teaspoons of shaved bark in a spice grinder (fresh grinding
seems to help with release of the active ingredients) and then boiled it in a
pint of water for about 10 minutes.  The stuff absorbs a lot of water.  Also,
when freshly ground, you get some FINE FINE FINE particles.  It took me a good
15 minutes to filter the stuff out through coffee filters (had to use a bunch
of filters cuz it clogged them up so bad).  The resulting brew was one of the
top three worst things I've ever tasted in my life (the other two being
calamus root and an abortive attempt at a kava kava concoction).  It tasted
kind of like bile.  You can kill the taste if you put enough honey in the tea,
but the aftertaste never goes away.  As soon as you swallow it creeps up your
throat; really gross.  The fact that the stuff should be sipped slowly makes
this even worse.  I would recommend finding a REAL strong chaser, like pure
lemon juice or maybe a mint leaf--something that obliterates all other taste
in your mouth when you eat/drink/chew it, yet is tolerably pleasant tasting.
I would swig/chew this chaser after every sip of yohimbe tea.

WARNING: Do NOT use alcohol in combination with yohimbe or anything related to
yohimbe.  The active ingredients in yohimbe are MAO inhibitors and combining
them with alcohol can be dangerous. [see MAO Inhibitors above]

Anyway, I took the tea with vitamin C.  About 20 minutes after I got done
drinking it I felt some mild nausea (more in my throat than in my stomach),
some mellow trippy effects (just mostly weird thoughts and vivid mental
images--nothing near a hallucination, no LSD-like mind racing), also had some
speedy effects (like being on 500 mg of caffeine--jitters, etc) and
started getting a little "pressure" in the groinal region.  To make a long
story short, the nausea was a bummer, and sex was incredible.  Yohimbe
completely changes the meaning of the word "orgasm" for men, anyway.  I have
no idea what a woman's reaction to it would be.

The sexual effects lasted about 4 hours (only cuz I was getting tired :^); the
speedy effects decreased earlier than that, but I couldn't sleep at all that
night (even when I was ready to), and I'm sure it was because of the yohimbe.

I also recently tried the yohimbe extract that they sell in health food
stores.  The stuff costs about $7/oz.  It comes in one ounce bottles with
screw-on eye-dropper  caps.  Recommended dose on the bottle is 3-20 drops up
to three times a day.  First time I tried it I took 35 drops with absolutely
no effects.  Recently, I took 100 drops mixed in orange juice.  The stuff is
tasteless in minute quantities, but at 100 drops/~8 oz. of OJ, it added a
mildly bitter taste.  Not too bad, tho--1000x better than the tea.  Anyway, it
didn't do anything, so I took another 50 drops, then another 50, and still no
effects whatsoever.  I wonder if the extract is even active.

I would advise yohimbe experimenters to use the tea form, and start out with 4
or five teaspoons of fresh ground bark, as the effects of 7 teaspoons were
quite pronounced in me, and I am a 200 lb. male with a high tolerance for
everything.

History: <unknown>

Interaction precautions: MAO inhibitor.

Active Constituents: Yohimbine, yohimbiline, ajmaline. (Note that yohimBE is
the plant; yohimBINE is one of the chemical principles found in the plant.)

Yohimbine is the primary alkaloid found in yohimbine bark.  It is an
alpha-2-adrenergic antagonist.  It blocks presynaptic inhibitory
synapses, meaning that it tends to increase central and peripheral
adrenergic activity.  It tends to cause nervousness and increases blood
pressure.  It also seems to be effective in some cases of impotence.

I've noticed that when I receive e-mail from the list, such as the one
included below, that I do *NOT* receive the e-mail address of the originator.
Needless to say, this causes a bit of a delay before I can respond directly to
a poster.  :/  Do many of you have this problem?  I wonder why I don't see it.

Anyway, see you all at Come-Unity tonight!  *HUG*

I hope to meet you, John Speakman, next week, since I'll be at DECUS, too!

Status: 

  Yohimbe is one of the most pleasurable plant
substances around..but I have to comment that combining
it with MDMA (or any stimulant,even mild ones like ephedra.)
would be potentially dangerous due to the fact that yohimbe is
a MAO inhibitor.. (blocks the breakdown of toxic monoamines like
those produced by ripened cheeses,red wine,stimulants and other
substances..) just an (important) datapoint..
Ask your doctor!

	Ooh.. gotta be careful 'bout those MAOI's. I don't know about
2C-B, but I think that Yohimbine is a MAOI. MAOI+MDMA == heart attack.
Not fun.

"Aptly dedicated to the Roland TB303, the drum machine that led a 
revolution, this compilation CD is filled with the bubbling, squeaking 
noise of hybrid acid vibrations: quite literally the current soundtrack
to urban Western existance...it is devilishly tempting.  The 
outstanding tracks are the more intense and haunting ones by DTS and
303 Terrorists like 'Tremendous' or 'Synthetic.'  Sharp and burning,
electronic trance with wonderful little noise.
