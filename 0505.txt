Hi Sfraves friend--

Thanks for your reply to my inquiry on Geoff White; following the now 
out-of-date info in the sfr list on him leads nowhere. Somehow after 
re-checking that, I accidentally erased the rest of your message. 
Please re-send because I think you had another tip. Thanks in advance 
for any help you can render!

saying that having not having red eyes (due to allergies or any

important if you have red eyes from simple hay fever or any other

What's scary is the fact that often I have red eyes because of my hard
contacts, and also the fact that one of my eyes is often more dilated
then the other naturally (yeah something is going on in my brain). Maybe
I should just skate everywhere.

Next month, Infinity will convert a poorly performing station in San Franci=

 distributed via the Internet to listeners' iPods and other digital music

Subject: [sfraves] your weekend party reviews???

ok folks, i know you went out this weekend.  let's hear your reviews!

friday, i was at mighty for Thrust with Lee Coombs.  saw lots of
friends so the company was fantastic.  my set kinda blew chunks and to
make up for that, i enthusiastically began drinking any cup or bottle
that was handed to me.  had to leave a tad early because i was
fuckered.  but good times!  saw lots of folks i haven't seen in
awhile.

saturday, made the trek down to socal.  me and aaron did a tag set at
a rave and tore the bejesus out of it.  one of the best sets i've ever
played with aaron.  had a blast!  this was uber-rave.  like rave-on
raver!

Subject: [sfraves] Eklektic Hektic Review... Oooh Shit man

OK... so Saturday was fun!!!  I had a nice walk 2 the bus stop in Hercules
& had alota think out loud moments.. although this time I didn't pretend I
was the Validvictorian of my High School class & gave the speech during
graduation...

So I got 2 the City & hung out w/ Phil (
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/sf/profiles/sfr.php?cmd=show_profile&userid=53)
who had a pre EK Pizza party @ his pad in like SOMA/ China Basin pad... oh
yeah!!!  YUMMY Pizza!

OK.. now EK was fuckin' sick!!  Like I got there early.. MikeyJ was on the
decks in the back... Rizzo (I thnink) fka J Rock was in the front... like
the front was like all mash up w/ all the DJs they had pretty much or it
seemed like i dunno... I can honestly that well.. when Lexxus was up
there, he was fuckin' Rockin' it like crazy w/ his Breaks set.. actually..
I think until he popped up.. the breaks room was kinda mellow 4 the most
part until he hopped on.. well.. IMHO... then after him... LIke Donna
Matrix, Ms Throwdown, oh gosh... Felix (well.. I think I saw him spin or
just early on in the night), but yeah.. ooh wow.. it was Awesome in the
Front room & I did find myself in there dancing alot!!!  But oooh...
Yeah.. Lexxus was Dope!  I kinda left like 15 mintues b4 the club closed
down & Lexxus did get back on the decks & spun the theme song 2 A-Team
over a nice fat yummy beat!!!  Wow!!!

In the Jungle room.. oooh my gosh... OK... yeah... MikeyJ really got
things off on the right beat & well.. honestly ( & please don't tell the
other DJs) but my fave sets that night were Soundboy & Ivry!!  Heeeeello
2day.. those were the 2 sets I did happen 2 like well.. dance most of
thier like entire sets!!  Ooooooooh...

I mean.. there was a period of time when i walked around the corner from
Cat Club 2 like get some air & I endedup @ another bar.. I was ther 4 like
an hour or a lil' longer.. but yeah man.. I got bought like a few drinks @
that bar by random dudes... then like when i left.. I realized that i was
in a gay biker bar.. then realized i made out w/ 5 guys 1 get 10 free
drinks!  Yeah...  I was kinda toasted when I got 2 the biker bar & well..
slightly sloshed when I left.. but man.. they were soooooooo nice!  Come 2
think of it.. I'm lucky there was no roofie slipping in 1 of those drinks
when i was @ the gay biker bar, ya know?

But yeah.. it was an amazing fuckin' time.. Heeeeeeello 2Day.. I'm still
HIGH from that night still.. fuckin' A man.. Ya know.. it was just a
Groovy fuckin' night!!  Awesome fuckin' Vibe, hung out w/ the Jungle fam..
Groovy Fuckin'  Music aaaaaaaaaaall night loooooong!!!  I Loved It!!!

I dunno man.. all i could say is that if U never been, then well... I
don't wanna seem 2 exclusive about it, but ya know.. it's bonkers fuckin'
wild mad Love the whole night!!!  SEriously man.. oh... it's like just 1
of those fuckin' parties that charged me up man... WOW!!!

How was the SFR/ SF Dance thingie @ Club 6???  Man.. I meant 2 stop by &
hang out w/ Jacob 4 a while.. miss that guy!

Wednesday, MAY 4th, 2005

DimSum and XLR8R present:
THE ANDREA PARKER TOUR 
 
DJ and Live Sets From:

Andrea Parker (!K7, MoWax, Beggers Banquet, Touchin Bass)
Mochipet (DimSum, Tigerbeat6, Bpitchcontrol)
Forest Green (DimSum, SisterSF)
Sindri (DimSum, Imputor?)
Samira (SisterSF)

Club Six
60 6th St. (between Market/Mission), SF 
9pm, $10

Andrea Parker, known for her electro mixes and sublime
productions on !K7, MoWax, and Beggers Banquet is
headed stateside to support her own imprint Touchin
Bass!

Parker has contributed to several experimental
electronic releases through out her career including
remixes for Depeche Mode, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and
Tipper.

Miss Parkers DJ style is uncompromising and crosses
all boundaries. Shes supported Radiohead on the US
part of their Kid A tour, experimented live on stage
with avant-garde supremos : Bang On A Can (Philip
Glass and Steve Reich) and provided more than a little
entertainment at parties for director Roman Polanski
and fashion house; Gucci.

Her popularity as a DJ was confirmed by the high sales
of her mix for !K7s DJ Kicks series which showcased
the variety of her musical tastes; shes not afraid to
fuse hip hop pioneers like Man Parish with electronic
pushers Gescom.

Subject: [sfraves] I had a crazy dream last night that I went to a rave

It was in a pretty small dark room with black lights and neon on the
walls. The DJ sucked and didn't even seem to care about mixing or what
feeling the song created.

There were only about thirty ravers there and we all ate pizza at the
start of the party.

Some dude hooked me up with some pills, which I took and were lousy.
Everyone at the party was happy, tripping hard and I was the only one
feeling depressed.

Me and my friend left the party early because the music just wasn't good
and we didn't feel like dancing. But after we left we found out that a
good DJ showed up and things went crazy.

Geeze what a nightmare.

Two things this dream made me realize:

1. I have hidden fears about feeling like I miss out on stuff
2. Hidden fears that I am unable to be happy, unless the situation is
perfect.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Cubik & Origami LIVE @ SCOUT in SF this Wednesday! (tomorrow night!)

Hey all, my friend Matt (Cubik) and I will be playing a crazy
guitar-bass-decks-electonics-fx downtempo set this Wednesday (and every
Wednesday for a while) at our home label Wide Hive's new weekly, SCOUT.


We will play live from 9-10, and Variable Unit (all-star
hip-hop/jazz/funk live band) will play from 10-12, backing up some of
the best local MCs that have signed up for a chance at the mic!

The shows will all be recorded on audiophile equipment and the best
will be culled and released on CD later this year as "The Best Of
SCOUT".

Come to the Red Devil Lounge - 1695 Polk Street, San Francisco,
tomorrow night for some serious soul funk and downtempo bump.

Check out http://widehive.com/scout.html for the details!

Cheers,

Hey, Vitaly (of VORG fame) runs that joint. Wonder if we're ever going to 
get the sfraves.com domain back now that raving is dead and he stopped 
making money off it.

Perhaps not, it points to klubin.com now.

~sigh~

  CONFERENCE

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

May 3, 2005
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

DOW RELEASES "ACCEPTABLE RISK" PROGRAM AT BANKING CONFERENCE
"Risk Calculator" helps ensure sound business practice

When government is made to take the back seat in regulatory matters,
corporations must rely on their own judgment to determine what is, and
what isn't, acceptable where human lives are at risk.

Doing this has until now been more of an art than a science. With
Acceptable Risk, business finally has a risk standard of its own,
reflecting its values and allowing us to reliably factor human and
environmental casualties into business decisions in accordance with
the soundest of economic principles.

Last Thursday in London, Dow representative Erastus Hamm unveiled
Acceptable Risk, the Acceptable Risk Calculator, and the Acceptable
Risk mascot--a life-sized golden skeleton named Gilda--to an audience
of about 70 banking professionals, including some from Dow's largest
investors. Many of the bankers in attendance excitedly signed up for
licenses for the Calculator, which helps businesses scientifically
determine the point where casualties start to cut into profit, while
suggesting the best regions on earth to locate dangerous ventures.

Hamm told the bankers how Acceptable Risk would have applied to some
famous "skeletons in the closet" of big business: IBM's WWII sale of
technology to the Nazis for use in identifying Jews; Dow's production
of napalm and Agent Orange for use in Vietnam; and the plight of
Dursban, a Dow pesticide whose main ingredient came out of Nazi nerve
agent research, was tested on student volunteers as recently as 1998,
and was finally banned two years later.

Each of these cases entailed heavy casualties, Hamm noted, and yet
each was immensely profitable and therefore consistent with sound
business practice. Hamm said the case of the Bhopal gas disaster of
1984 was slightly more complicated--but so long as so-called "socially
responsible" investor groups do not get away with forcing Dow to spend
too much time on the matter at the May 12 AGM and elsewhere, that case
could end up being a "golden skeleton" too.

Please visit http://www.dowethics.com/risk/ to try out the Acceptable
Risk Calculator for yourself, and for text, photos and video of the
London announcement.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] raving in southern cal / candie kids alive and kicking

Southern cali is alive and thriving. I was at Xara Dulzura the weekend before 
last. I had fun laptop DJing at the Xaruba Cafe where I setup a small 
soundsystem. A highlight for me was segueing from me DJing with live drummers, 
to the drummers taking over, and me beat matching to them (or attempting to). It 
erupted into a cool live looping of afro-house drum-beats in a jam session with 
a bunch of drummers, mandolin, and sax player. People got some serious dancing 
going on. Met cool people. Even got some very inspiring positive feedback online 
and on tribe.

Heard and met great DJ's including LA's Wolfie and San Diego's Jack-Tripper.
Mutaytor (see mutaytor.com) put on an a massive live show. I was well blown away.

All in all, I actually find what little I've seen of the so-cal scene to be more 
"plurry" without being pretentious about being so. Then again, I am way way sick 
of the bay area and most of the people there (NOT YOU OF COURSE!!) so this may
have something to do with it. :-/ It's nice to see a fresh place, look upon
things with fresh eyes, and see beautiful valleys, mountains, people, art and
music. There was even a passover seder, where at the end, two crazily 
face-painted, beautiful stiltwalkers came up on the circle and said "we're 
passing over!" then gave a big cheer to the woman leading the seder, Athena. The 
whole experience  was amazing. Best passover seder I've been to. Nice communal 
food sharing all weekend.

http://www.podcollective.com/fora/viewtopic.php?p=4571#4571

As you can see from the pix above, there were no candy kids whatsoever (I'm in 
the collection above twice, and I'm far too old to be candy).
Candy is for the unimaginative. This event just had lots of people in
costumes.  There's a difference. Candy kids are kids. Fortunately, I didn't
feel particularly geriatric at Xara.

It felt kinda  like a weekend campout party at Camp & Sons, but with more 
people, more stages, more audience participation, and more live music.

Subject: [sfraves] ATTN: Downtempo / Ambient DJS

Hey everyone this year for the Stilldream Campout 5 year Anniversary we are 
adding a chill tent/ area with ambient / downtempo djs.  Its going to be 
hosted by Funky Baby.  Now since we are just gettin ready to go to print 
with the main flyer, and would love to get any djs that would want to play 
on the flyer i need to know asap.  I know this is short notice but it all 
came together pretty much yesterday.

I know theres a lot of them on this list so lemme know if your interested.

Please email your contact (phone number preferable) would be good since of 
the short time to get ahold everybody on here.  I think we have room for 
about 10 more Downtempo Djs.

Hope to hear from some of you soon.

troy --

thanks for the info on 'a scanner, darkly'.  i'd definitely call that a
synchronicity!  i was just finishing up prometheus rising last night and there
was a part in there where they were all laughing about a book that talks about
this lodge called "toot and come in" and they realized that also could be
pronounced "tutenkhamen".  well his wife in the next room just happened to be
watching a show on the mummy.  coincedence?  for me and my friends, they happen
to often to be merely such.

Synchronicity reveals the meaningful connections between the subjective and
objective world.

nothing professional. I'm probably going the craigslist route, so I

Jessi:
 
I've had really good luck with a Cannon ELF series. For about $300, it's small, has kickass resolution, and with a 512 MB video card you can get some pretty long video clips w. sound. Pretty sure they have even bigger ones now. I'm sure other peeps on here might have some better recomendations, but there's mine.

peace

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

A wicked selectah in many genres, tonight he aims in a mostly techno=20
direction with friendly fire and funky ricochets all over the map.

In that order.  Techno with soul is the special this evening, melting your=

Subject: [sfraves] DJ AM - deejay to the stars???

DJ hired to play SFMOMA party says it's about tunes, not his L.A. glitz
- Aidin Vaziri, Chronicle Pop Music Critic
Tuesday, May 3, 2005

Click to View

Yes, we know Adam Michael Goldstein is the soon-to-be-husband of
Nicole Richie. And, sure, he used to play with Crazy Town and Papa
Roach, two of the more dubious bands not just in recent memory but of
the whole past century. But it's his record collection that reassures
us that the 32-year-old Philadelphia native who goes by the
professional name DJ AM is the right guy to rock the Post-Modern Party
after the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's Modern Ball on
Wednesday.

Surveying the stacks of vinyl crowding the walls and floors of his Los
Angeles home, he estimates over the phone that there must be something
like 7, 000 discs in there, ranging from Wu-Tang Clan's "Enter the
Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" to Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road." Of
course, he could make room for a few more but then where would he put
the 600 designer sneakers he owns?

Between his four regular weekly gigs -- two in Hollywood, two at the
Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas -- and the wedding planning, it's lucky
Goldstein made time at all for the San Francisco event. Having served
as Hollywood's unofficial celebrity DJ since 1993, when he held a
residency at the popular star lair Dragonfly, he contends that now the
perfect night doesn't entail playing Killers records for the likes of
Brad Pitt and Lindsay Lohan but loading up on rented videos and
microwave popcorn.

"Home with my fiancee, relaxing and watching movies in bed," Goldstein
says. "That's my favorite thing."

He says he hasn't been starstruck since Ben Stiller approached him on
the decks nearly five years ago. "At first I was sure he was going to
complain about the music, from the look on his face," Goldstein says.
"But he said, 'Are you busy in the next few weeks? You're amazing and
I would love for you to come play at my wedding in Hawaii.' That
happened at Kate Hudson's birthday party."

Since then he's worked at the bar mitzvah of Steven Spielberg's son,
Nicki Hilton's runway show and the birthday parties of everyone from
Tom Cruise to Melissa Etheridge. In March alone, he packed in a dinner
party for Jessica Alba, "The Ring Two" movie premiere and a Hugo Boss
fashion show at the Beverly Hills Hotel, to name a few.

"I'm just really lucky that I happen to live in Hollywood," Goldstein
says. "I've been hired for a lot of jobs just because of my location."

He also deserves credit for his complete disregard of genres. On any
given night, he's likely to mix up records by the Jackson Five, Oasis,
Ciara, George Michael, System of a Down, anything goes. "I'm all over
the map," he says. He recently replaced his traditional DJ setup with
a computer program called Serrata that allows him to travel with his
entire record collection on just two pieces of vinyl and a laptop
computer, which really cracks things open.

Starbucks has approached Goldstein about marketing a DJ AM mix CD that
would be available exclusively at the coffee shops. He's also looking
to move into production in the future. And the whole tabloid thing?

"It is what it is," Goldstein says. "It has nothing to do with me as a pers=
on."
Post-Modern Party: 9 p.m. to midnight Wednesday. With DJ AM, DJ Spooky
and DJ Angola spinning at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 151
Third St., San Francisco. Tickets $125. (415) 618-3263 or
sfmoma.org/modernball. The Modern Ball and the Modern Ball gala dinner
are sold out.

If *X* is greater than the cost of a recall, we recall the cars and no one=

gets hurt.

If *X* is less than the cost of a recall, then we don't do a recall."

Fight Club, page 30, 1996

Why people picked up on 'the first rule of Fight Club is that...,' instead=

of this passage is beyond me, since it's the heart of the story.

whatthefuckever.

On a personal note, the most money I ever made in my life, for no work to=

wonder which side of the issue they were on?

kinda why i don't do that

She got them lifetime pensions from the West German government and she=20

people who lived through that experience were accounted for.

It wasn't until the 1990's that pressure was put on the Swiss banking syste=

to release the assets that were stolen from the Jews.

In other words, they just ran the clock out on the Survivors.

Nice, huh?

And my Libertarian friends wonder why I take a dim view of their trust in=

holy shit dude. I've seen those pictures already. that is EXTREMELY
cool. apart from anything else I've been trying to figure out whether
that happened here or in Europe.

the green transparent kick drum, I fucking creamed my panties when I
saw that shit.

must admit there's a ton of fuzzy clothing and all that.

DJ Bam teaches Tai Chi?

I googled Wade-Giles, that was weird.

I don't understand Mandarin, though. all the really good kung fu
movies are in Cantonese. the ones in Mandarin tend to be kind of
pretentious (Crouching Tiger etc.).

Dulzura, CA. Inland from San Diego, near the Mexican border. Gorgeous 
landscapes. It looks almost like it could be a foreign country.

Yes. That's me. I was happy to find four or five pictures of me snapped by three 
different photographers. Of course, I had the "honey" of having a bunch of 
beautiful women bellydancing in front of me, so I tended to be in a lot of 
background shots: http://nielsmayer.com/npm_xara_2005_3.jpg (Shayde is so amazing!).

I need to glue the midi crossfader I built ontop of my audio interface box so it 
actually looks like i'm DJing and not just twiddling invisible knobs and 
clicking keys on my computer. Being a geek is so uncool!

Did I ever tell you guys about the time I setup my "rig" in the wrong tent at 
burning man... so like I'm being a total dork wiring my shit together and kind 
of realizing the vibe was a little strange for music. For one, there was no 
soundsystem. For two, there were people having sex. I eventually figured out
I was in the wrong dome, tore all my shit down. Turned out the system I was 
scheduled to play on kept playing at full volume outdoors all night ... so
i setup outside, and rocked out, trying not to think about the guy doing the 
bucking bronco ride (hand in the air and all) on some hot chick right in front 
of me just moments before...

cool - you're in the clear, sort of.  if you bought it in
berkeley, one of the returns guys is a real asshole.  make sure
to clean it real well, no dust and the like.  

one time, i returned a record because it was bowl shaped, too. 
he told me, "records are for listening to, not for DJing". 
dumbass.  obviously, they're for salad bowls.

Subject: [sfraves] Hugger Mugger was HOT!!!!!

So like I had 2 go 2 school 4 what I thought was gonna be a productive
night was work completed by my group... what ended up happening was me on
a computer in lab making myslef a tshirt on tshirt.com then reading an
email from 1 of my group mates couldn't make it & therefore all my group
mates FLAKED!!!! >:O  So yeah... I was kinda pissed off & well... worked
on my shirt somemore @ school...

OK... so I walked over 2 LIT & 2 my surprise almost as soon as i have a
seat @ the bar... MS. HEIDI & MR ERIC walk in & Hello 2day.... me & Heidi
have this totally mondo super fuckin' Awesome Groovy Hug of 2 married
people who like just won the fuckin' Lotto happy hug dealie!!  YAY!!  Love
U Girl!!   LoL.. It was also Dope hangin' out w/ Eric & we gave each other
a mondo hug!

OK.. funny, really funny, kinda weird thing happened while @ Hooger
Mooger... so like Eric, Heidi & I were like mondo talking, then this guy
from across the bar kinda like came up 2 me & started scopin' my rings..
hmmm.. ok.. so that part wasn't weird.. but then he said 2 me, "Wow, I
never met a thick asain like you b4, you're so HOT, your earings & rings
are so HOT, oh mygosh, your hair is so HOT, Wow, you're beauty mark on
your face it so HOT" & well.. he did that thing where like well... let's
just say no random person ever ever EVER in my whole life @ a bar like
started rubbing body parts on my knee like this dude, his name was Venice
like Italy, LA Venice, did... LOLOLOLOLMAO Hello 2day man.. he hella threw
himself @ me & I was just like soooooooooooooo trippin'.... Heidi,
Sweetie, U can back me up 'cause U were there 4 the whole thing!!

So Weird...

So yeah... like Andy & Orange show up & well... I dunno... I didn't wanna
bge rude, so I like switched hangin' out w/ Andy & Orange then headed back
2 Venice, Heidi, & Eric.... LOLOLOLMAO  I mean... like 4 the most part...
Venice was a Groovy lil' flamey queenie boy & I was totally flattered @
some1 actually throwing themself @ me. but it was just weird how that was
like happening.. esp after hearing that a girl I know wants 2 screw me &
has been thinking about it 4 over a year now or something like that... 
HELLO 2DAY.. I tell U SFRavers... this is all fact.. no fiction in this
story!!!!

So I only got 2 check out the 1st DJ... Scott Edmunds was it?... like
totally played this set that I dunno... parts of it sounded like booty-ish
kinda house, but not really, he did throw in some bad ass Electro @ 1
point, & there was this Groovy Oriental chordy sounding song that i was
diggin' alot!!

Oh yeah.. so after Venice left w/ this other couple he made friends
with... all we kept sayin' in the bar was how HOT everything was!!  AndyW
is HOT is his tie!!  The bartenders boobs I took a picture of was HOT!!!
Orange was HOT in it HOT jersey!  It was a Really Hot time there man!!

I left like around 10:45 & well.. i felt bad I couldn't catch or Groovy 2
the rest of the sets.. but I"m sure fFlood's set was Dope & if I know my
Andy.. he spun a really Awesome, techno-ie diversified set 'cause I think
it was him who told me once he wants 2 keep every1 guessin' when he's on
the decks!!  But yeah.. I'm sure his set was HOT!

i'm not even going to try to find out who said this, because i think it's
stupid.  you might like it though.  i don't know.  roll the dice.

i decided to go to google today and type in "famous raver quotes" in my search. 
what i expected was to find a bunch of quotes from osby or geri dahl or
something like that.  what i got was a bunch of people with the last name raver
and a site that promotes that card game magic:  the gathering.

lovely.  thanks for coming out.  get ready to roll your eyes.

cool - you're in the clear, sort of.  if you bought it in
berkeley, one of the returns guys is a real asshole.  make sure
to clean it real well, no dust and the like.  

one time, i returned a record because it was bowl shaped, too. 
he told me, "records are for listening to, not for DJing". 
dumbass.  obviously, they're for salad bowls.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  KENT STATE 35 YEARS AGO

--=====================_12595411==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

35 years ago National Guard troops killed four Vietnam War protestors on 
the <http://www.may4.org/>Kent State campus in Ohio.

This post is not about the Vietnam War, nor is it about the brave men and 
women who fight in wars. It is about the brave men and women who never step 
on the "battlefield" yet play an important role in ending wars.

During war time, we see at least two types of Patriotism arise. We have the 
patriots who go off to fight the war. And, we have the patriots who oppose 
the war. Both types of patriots exhibit courage and love of country. But, 
there are rarely parades and medals for the latter.

In the Vietnam era, there is no question that the protests helped bring a 
close to the conflict. Today is a day to remember those who died doing just 
that and a day to remember the lessons of those events.

Since we are in wartime again, its possible we'll see additional protests 
if Iraq drags out or other unforeseen events occur. When we see those 
protests, we'll need to keep in mind that most involved will be law abiding 
patriots demonstrating their love of country and their support for the 
troops in order to get them out of a dangerous situation. We'll also need 
to remember the right to voice that type of patriotism.

During this war, we've had our share of squelching of dissent. We don't 
need to detail that here. But, luckily, we haven't had anyone killed for 
dissent. In order to keep the worst from happening we need to look back and 
remember those patriots who died that May 5 in Ohio for simply showing love 
of country and for helping to bring our troops home from a dangerous situation.

I have to admit I didn't realize this anniversary until I heard this Crosby 
Stills Nash and Young song on the radio today:

Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'.
We're finally on our own.
This summer I hear the drummin'.
Four dead in Ohio.

Gotta get down to it.
Soldiers are cutting us down.
Should have been done long ago.
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

Gotta get down to it.
Soldiers are cutting us down.
Should have been done long ago.
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'.
We're finally on our own.
This summer I hear the drummin'.
Four dead in Ohio.
Four dead in Ohio.
Four dead in Ohio.
Four dead in Ohio.
Four dead in Ohio.
Four dead in Ohio.
Four dead in Ohio.
Four dead in Ohio.
Four dead in Ohio

..................

Legend has it that as soon as Neil Young heard the news from Ohio he 
grabbed his guitar and started to write the song. Young played the song for 
David Crosby and said they should consider recording it at a later time. 
Crosby insisted they record it right away. So, they called Stephen Stills 
and Graham Nash and told them to book studio time and they were on their 
way to LA to record this new song.

The band released it right away, even though their label was already 
pushing their recently released single "Teach the Children." The song meant 
so much to the band that they didn't care that it would take away from the 
marketing of the current hit. To CSNY, the hits never mattered as much as 
the message. Like much of the music of the day, it spoke directly to an 
important issue and took it head on. Its a great song. But, I hope we 
remember the lessons from those who died and hope another song like this 
never has to be written again.

Here are the names of those who died at Kent State, so that they may not be 
forgotten:

ALISON KRAUSE

death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think

Subject: RE: [sfraves] amoeba breaks records -- ripoff alert

haha.. i prize mine too.. I have every release on
white, both jump and resource.. even a refined or
two.. HAHA come to think of it, I have a *signed* copy
of the RESO 001. (Ya'll know chris is a real live
superstar, right?) Label copies of almost all as well
as most of the CJAX remixes for other labels ;) A full
crate or so dedicated to Resource and affiliates..

Thats it, I'm havin' a sale...

UNLEASH YOUR INNER KRAKEN

When they've had enough rum, the old-timers tell 
the tale of the last voyage of the Jiggletech, 
a noble submarine. Weighing anchor, she drifted from 
port and set out in search of the Other World, an 
undersea grotto of kinky pyramids and giant pearls.

Fearing the pleasures this might unleash, a squadron
of black helicopters intercepted the vessel on the
horizon's edge. The good ship dove for the ocean floor
as depth charges rained down from the sky! Relentless 
sonic pressures pounded her hull with each detonation,
discharging waves of unending acoustical force. 
Her hatches battened, her bulkheads sealed, 
the Jiggletech drifted deeper.

deposited its catch on the sandy sea bottom.

Having jaws but no gills, the submarine's divers
ventured curiously out through the hatch, snorkles 
in hand, masks and tanks at the ready. What they 
found was no inky abyss; all around them were
Nereids, Neptunes and shape-shifting sea-nymphs -- 
a deep water garden of coral and bubbles, 
beautifully lit by the phosphorescence of the 
benevolent squid.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  he Connection Between Hip Hop, New Wave and Punk

Something to Ponder Over:
The Connection Between Hip Hop, New Wave and Punk
by Davey D

This past Monday, Spinderella of Salt-N-Pepa, Mike Shinoda of Linkin
Park and myself among others, participated in a panel discussion at
UCLA that focused on the business workings and current state of Hip
Hop.  Before we launched into Q&A from the audience all of were asked
'What CD we were listening to in our ride?'  The audience seemed a bit
surprised when I mentioned that in my CD deck was the 1981 album
'JuJu' by new wave/punk act Siouxsie & the Banshees.  Songs like
'Spellbound, 'Monitor' and 'Into the Light' brought back fond
memories.  More importantly the whole early new wave/punk scene was a
very much apart of my early Hip Hop experience.

For those who wish to walk down memory lane, how could we forget when
New Wave/Punk acts like Thomas Dolby, Tom Tom Club, The Clash,
Blondie, The Thompson Twins, The Police, Depeche Mode, Human League,
Tears for Fears and David Bowie to name a few were regularly heard
within Hip Hop circles especially in many of our 'hoods'.  No offense
to Run DMC, who are often sighted as the first Hip Hop group to merge
Rock and Rap, when we really go back and look at what was happening in
the late 70s early 80s, we'll find that there was an often under
reported important conversation and cultural exchange that was taking
place with hardcore b-boys from the South Bronx and the
disenfranchised rebellious New Wave Punk kids in downtown Manhattan on
the Lower Eastside and in the Village.

It really began when acts like Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash
who were just starting to record records were starting to be invited
to perform at some key downtown spots like the Mudclub or the Roxy
which was frequented by punk/new wave kids.  The parallels between the
hardcore Hip Hoppers from the Bronx and the Rebellious Punk Kids soon
became obvious.  Both groups had reacted organically to a stale,
formulaic music industry that was serving the public watered down
disco and arena rock.  The Blacks and Puerto Ricans in the Bronx
embraced the classic James Brown Soul and Funk music of Sly and the
Family Stone and developed Hip Hop, while their Lower Eastside white
counterparts got into the British import punk and new wave.

People like Bambaataa, Fab 5 Freddy, Debby Harry of Blondie and
British new Wave icon Malcolm McClaren would wind up being key figures
in Hip Hop's first cross cultural exchange.  The B-Boys from the Bronx
would get nice gigs at the Punk/New Wave spots while the punk crowd
would literally be granted safe passage to Bronx River or the PAL up
in the Bronx.  It's important to note that this was not a natural
occurrence which has often been erroneously stated, especially with
the white kids coming up to the Bronx.  It was a deliberate attempt on
the parts of folks who had mutual respect and vision to build with one
another.

When you look back into time you'll find that both the early Hip Hop
and Punk/New Wave groups equally influenced each other.  This
admiration was reflected in Blondie's pivotal song 'Rapture' where
lead singer Debby Harry after being escorted up to a B-Boy party at
the PAL club where Grandmaster Flash was playing gave props to Fab 5
Freddy as well as Flash who blew her away.

Soon after you had people like Malcolm McClaren teaming up with 5%
cats like the World Famous Supreme Team who did radio to do songs like
Buffalo Gals (which was named after a London clothing store-not the
size of woman's butts), 'Hey DJ' and 'Hobo Scratch'.  History will
show that others like the punk rock group known as the Beastie Boys
would start to embrace rap and put out songs like Cookiepuss and go on
to become Hip Hop's first meaningful white act.  Pioneering groups
like the Cold Crush Brothers would release songs like 'Punk Rock Rap'
while Flash and his crew did songs like new wave influenced songs like
'Scorpio'.  Bambaataa himself would go onto to form a group called
Time Zone and would record a huge song called 'World Destruction' with
punk icon Johnny Rotten.


The whole time this was happening between the years 1979-1984, you saw
the musical walls of segregation come down as artists from both genres
would become familiar to both audiences.  In other words during the
early 80s you would hear Thomas Dolby's 'Blinded Me With Science',
David Bowie's 'Let's Dance', Devo's 'Let It Whip' or Tom Tom Club's
'Genius of Love' not only being played on urban radio, but also at
popular Hip Hop night spots where playing them would help set off the
party.

It was amazing to hear the types of early reactions to last year's
Mobb Deep hit song 'Got It Twisted'.  First, many younger folks had no
idea that they had sampled the main riff that gave the song its entire
flavor from Dolby's 'Blinded Me with Science'.  When it was revealed,
the reaction ranged from 'Who in the heck is Thomas Dolby'?  to 'Wow,
Mobb Deep is so adventurous, groundbreaking and experimental for going
there and sampling a rock act.  For some the Thomas Dolby connection
was strange for others who fondly remember those early days, what Mobb
Deep did was a natural fit.  More importantly we need to remember that
it was Thomas Dolby who actually stepped up and produced Whodini's
first record 'Magic Wand'.

In fact we need to also shout out folks like Trevor Horn and Rick
Rubin who stepped over from the world of New Wave and Punk and got
down on the production tip within Hip Hop.

We also need to keep in mind that these few examples I mentioned are
just around the early Hip Hop scene in New York.  If you go back and
look at what was happening 300 miles away in California you will find
similar exchanges between the early emerging Hip Hop community and the
new wave punk sects.  In places like Los Angeles where racial
segregation is more pronounced and ethnic groups are really removed
from one another, to see the early Ska and punk scenes make their way
to early Hip Hop clubs and eventually see it reflected in the music
with folks coming from places like South central is significant.  If
anyone remembers back in the days when KDAY was jumping off in LA,
then you know it was not usual to hear a Thompson Twins song or a
Clash song being mixed and cut up by the famed Mixmasters at that
time.  It was not out of place to go to an Uncle Jamm's Army set at
the old Coliseum and here some of those aforementioned new wave
groups.  And of course Hip Hop was not out of place in those New Wave
Punk clubs.

Today in the age of music industry consolidation and corporate radio
owning multiple stations in a market has resulted in what is best
described as music segregation.  Industry proponents would argue and
say its niche marketing, but really it isn't.  You have a group of
'experts' who sit around a table and devise elaborate marketing plans
which run along the lines of station X owned by company A will go
after Latino women 18-34 and will play a particular style of music
with very little room for deviation.  Station Y, also owned by that
same company will go after older white men 25-54 and will also embrace
a particular music genre.

This process goes all the way down the line until there are no more
stations for the company to play with.  The end results are a series
of unintended consequences, some of which I touched upon in a previous
column where I asked 'When is Old School Too Old to Play' as well as
what I would call increased music segregation.  Sure we can look at
recent examples like Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit doing songs with
Method Man or the upcoming Coachella Music Festival or a Warp Tour
where there will be a healthy dose of rock and rap acts.  However, the
cultural exchange seems to be very one sided at best and contrived and
forced at worse.

It's one sided in the sense that you have rock oriented outlets with a
predominantly white audience embracing Hip Hop.  Yes, you can tune
into a radio station like KROQ and hear rap alongside the usual rock
offerings and lastly we have all the mash up projects, with the most
noticeable being Collision Course with Linkin Park and Jay-Z.
However, you will not see similar attempts in many urban outlets that
target African American audiences.  Yes believe it or not groups like
Linkin Park as popular as they are are still relatively unknown in
many Black circles where BET and commercial radio are the main
conduits to things outside the community.  I'm not sure what needs to
be done to change that or if it even needs to be changed.

I guess I just yearn for the days when the Hip Hop and Punk and New
Wave communities were known to each other and me, a Black kid from the
Boogie Down Bronx, mentioning I like Siouxsie & the Banshees or the
Split Endz is not met with shock and surprise because I defy a
stereotype but with approvals or moans because everyone in the room
has strong opinions about my choice of groups.

http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=29&art_id=qw1115096583506B216&set_id=1

British police have moved to swiftly shut down a pirate radio station
after pilots complained that thumping dance music was drowning out
instructions from air traffic controllers as they landed at a nearby
airport, a report said on Tuesday.

Pilots landing passenger jets at Birmingham airport in central England
reported hearing loud bursts of "garage", a cutting-edged form of
dance music characterised by frantic beats and prominent, repetitive
baselines.

Ah that's too bad.  I live a couple of minutes from
the beach and its nice right now, despite the forecast
of showers, and it is supposed to be clear again
tomorrow.  I guess the sand will still be wet from the
rain.

I was just talking with a friend last night, and he's
got an inverter for his car so we can power a system
down on the beach.  We're planning to head down there
and make some noise in the next couple of weeks.

I <3 beach parties. I'll be going to one this weekend if someone would 
like to join in. It's a private beach - lots of fun, good people, good 
beats (13 djs) - much love.

That's right, that's right, it's time for another dose of funk-infused,
live-instrument-ladled house action at Folded tonight.  Not only do we
have Matt Craske, recent SF transplant and head of Offset Music, (one
very fine house label!) the inimitable Andrew Phelan and I:van on the
decks, we've got DJF playing live sax and, er, origami on the
bass-o-mo-phone as always.

Come get crazy, drink some vodka drinks on the cheap (show up early),
get loose, and free your funky caboose (all night long)!

And as for love of the scene and the music and energy... there are people 
here who have started record labels, released tunes, taught others what 
they know, thrown parties, done sound, promoted, acted as calendar or list 
owner, thanklessly done lights or visuals, etc for years.  We're better 
off with osby of course (I am after all his big bro), but there are almost 
as many ways we can contribute as there are people in this whole thing.

This thread is SO HOT!

Yeah, everyone does their little part, that's for sure.

I wish it were that way out here in god's ashtray. No knowledge is
passed on, which is probably the biggest complaint I have. Everyone
acts as though it's a secret society out here, and you've gotta know
the secret handshake to throw a rave.

God I miss being back in the bay area.

I'm spinning from sometime around 11 to 12ish or so (I always allow for late 
starts/endings to sets - just happens that way alot).

A heaping helping of funkdified breaks and beats will be on the menu, so 
come early and feed me liquor, or throw stuff at me - whatever works.

School board bans band from performing 'Louie Louie'

May 5, 2005, 7:21 AM

BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- A pop culture controversy that has simmered 
for decades came to a head when a middle school marching band was told not 
to perform "Louie Louie."

Benton Harbor Superintendent Paula Dawning cited the song's allegedly 
raunchy lyrics in ordering the McCord Middle School band not to perform it 
in Saturday's Grand Floral Parade, held as part of the Blossomtime Festival.

In a letter sent home with McCord students, Dawning said "Louie Louie" was 
not appropriate for Benton Harbor students to play while representing the 
district -- even though the marching band wasn't going to sing it.

Band members and parents complained to the Board of Education at its 
Tuesday meeting that it was too late to learn another song, The 
Herald-Palladium of St. Joseph reported.

"It's very stressful for us to try to come up with new songs for the band," 
eighth-grader Laurice Martin told the board. "We're trying to learn the 
songs from last year, but some of us weren't in the band last year."

Dawning said that if a majority of parents supports their children playing 
the song, she will reconsider her decision.

"It was not that I knew at the beginning and said nothing," Dawning said. 
"I normally count on the staff to make reliable decisions. I found out 
because a parent called, concerned about the song being played."

"Louie Louie," written by Richard Berry in 1956, is one of the most 
recorded songs in history. The best-known, most notorious version was a hit 
in 1963 for the Kingsmen; the FBI spent two years investigating the lyrics 
before declaring they not only were not obscene but also were 
"unintelligible at any speed."

Antipiracy Rule for Broadcasts Is Struck Down
By STEPHEN LABATON

WASHINGTON, May 6 - A federal appeals court handed a major setback to
Hollywood and the television networks on Friday when it struck down an
antipiracy regulation requiring computer and television makers to use
new technology that would make it difficult for consumers to copy and
distribute digital programs.

The unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel, in an important case at
the intersection of intellectual property and technology, was a
stinging rebuke for the Federal Communications Commission. The court
said the commission exceeded its authority when it approved the rules
in 2003.

It was a significant victory for libraries, consumer groups and civil
liberties organizations. They had maintained that the regulation, known
as the broadcast flag rule, would stifle innovation in technology and
make it more difficult for consumers and users of library services to
circulate material legitimately.

Although an appeal is possible, lawyers involved in the case said the
fight would shift in the near term to Congress, which is already
weighing legislation. Hollywood executives and their lobbyists warned
that if the rule was not resurrected by Congress, studios and
broadcasters would sharply limit the digital programming available over
the airwaves, focusing instead on channels limited to cable and
satellite services, where they have other means to control what can be
copied.

The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling soon in another closely
watched case involving digital rights and intellectual property,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios v. Grokster Ltd. In that case, the court is
considering whether the online services that enable copyright songs and
movies to be shared freely over the Internet can be held liable
themselves for copyright infringement.

The rule at issue in Friday's decision would have required
manufacturers to install special technology in new computers and
televisions that would enable them to recognize a "broadcast flag" -
specially embedded computer bits in the programs created by the studios
and the networks. The new equipment would then restrict redistribution
and reuse of the programs.

For years, the movie studios and television networks urged the
commission to adopt the rule, citing the recording industry's
experience with companies like Napster and saying restrictions on
copying and distributing programs by consumers were essential to the
transition from analog to digital television. They maintained that
without the imposition of the broadcast flag, shows would be copied and
then transmitted limitlessly through the Internet, much the way music
is.

But the critics said that the studios and networks were unduly alarmist
and that the new rule, which was to have taken effect July 1, would
prevent consumers from copying and using programs for legitimate
reasons.

Research librarians submitted affidavits in the case contending that
the broadcast flag rule would make it impossible to distribute
broadcast clips and other research material over the Internet to
researchers and students.

Critics also maintained that the commission had overreached and had
moved to regulate the Internet more tightly, ridiculing the agency in
the aftermath of the rulemaking as the "federal computer commission."

The rule was challenged from the moment it was issued in November 2003.
The case was filed last year in the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia, the usual venue for challenging commission
rules.

The outcome of the case was signaled during oral arguments in February,
when the judges aggressively questioned F.C.C. lawyers about whether
the agency had exceeded its authority by setting technical standards
having nothing directly to do with broadcasting transmissions.

"You've gone too far," said Judge Harry T. Edwards during the oral
arguments, as he pressed a government lawyer to justify how the agency
could possibly set standards governing computers and the Internet. "Are
washing machines next?"

But the breadth of Judge Edwards's opinion was more than many lawyers
had expected.

"In this case, all relevant materials concerning the F.C.C.'s
jurisdiction - including the words of the Communications Act of 1934,
its legislative history, subsequent legislation, relevant case law, and
commission practice - confirm that the F.C.C. has no authority to
regulate consumer electronic devices that can be used for receipt of
wire or radio communication when those devices are not engaged in the
process of radio or wire transmission," Judge Edwards wrote.

"And the agency's strained and implausible interpretations of the
definitional provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 do not lend
credence to its position. As the Supreme Court has reminded us,
Congress 'does not ... hide elephants in mouse holes.' "His opinion, in
American Library Association v. Federal Communications Commission, was
joined by Judges David B. Sentelle and Judith W. Rogers.

David Fiske, the commission's top spokesman, said that the agency did
not have a comment about the decision and that the government had not
decided whether it would seek an appeal either to the full Court of
Appeals or to the Supreme Court. Some lawyers said it was unlikely that
the Supreme Court would consider the matter as the case did not satisfy
the criteria for such review.

The broadcast flag rule was adopted at the urging of Michael K. Powell
when he was commission chairman. It was supported by Kevin J. Martin, a
commissioner at the time who became chairman this year.

In recent weeks each side in the lawsuit has been talking to lawmakers
in anticipation of the ruling.

"Without a broadcast flag, consumers may lose access to the very best
programming offered on local television," said Edward O. Fritts,
chairman and chief executive of the National Association of
Broadcasters. "This remedy is designed to protect against unauthorized
indiscriminate redistribution of programming over the Internet."

Dan Glickman, president of the Motion Picture Association of America,
offered similar warnings. "If the broadcast flag cannot be used,
program providers will have to weigh whether the risk of theft is too
great over free, off-air broadcasting and could limit such high-quality
programming to only cable, satellite and other more secure delivery
systems," he said. "It is important to remember that this decision is
only about the F.C.C.'s jurisdiction, not the merits of the broadcast
flag itself."

But Gigi B. Sohn, president of Public Knowledge, a digital rights
advocacy group that led the fight against the broadcast flag rule,
warned that intervention by Congress could create a new set of problems
for consumers and innovators.

"If Congress starts to go down the road of giving the F.C.C. broad
power over new applications and technologies, who knows what comes
next?" Ms. Sohn said. "This case is about the future of technology."

Government officials and industry executives report that digital
television has slowly been gaining in popularity. Nearly 1,500
stations, or about 90 percent of the total, now broadcast some digital
programs. Industry executives project sales this year of about 15
million television sets able to receive digital programs, about half of
all sets sold. Indeed, some sets already being sold are equipped for a
broadcast flag.

Cable televisions now have the ability to sell digital programs to as
many as 90 million homes, and about 300 hours of digital programming is
available each day in many markets.

i think that's his house.  i'd totally understand if that was
the case, because i wouldn't want flyering to be done at my
house for one of my parties.  you'd find flyers all over the
place for months afterward.

i used to promote as well, but i never understood why
club/parties would let me in for free.  i suppose it was "club
courtesy", as the club or party i was promoting for would let
them in for free to promote their event.  but it seemed funny -
let someone in to litter up their venue, for free.

by the way, $15 is pretty pricey for a UG, IMHO.  i'd have just
done the cars outside.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] RE: 5/6 doublethinnk - thanx Modified!

it's an underground venue and I wouldn't want them to get in trouble for 
flyers on cars or outside.  I didn't know it was his house and I think it's 
a bit crazy to charge fifteen bucks at 2am for all local talent when there 
are only two hours left in the party.  We actually weren't there to party in 
the first place; we came from the city to drop off some flyers, shake some 
hands, and promote a couple of up coming events.  If he didn't want flyers 
in, he could have at least been polite about it.  He came from a rather 
harsh angle and basically told us to piss off.  I believe the reason most 
people let you into their parties to promote is to keep the cycle of parties 
and promotion active.  If you let promoters in and they spread the word 
about up coming events, it's more likely that events are going to do well 
and it perpetuates a more active scene.  Maybe I was bit harsh in my first 
post saying he was a dick, but I can't think of a better way to describe his 
attitude.  On another note, we've never had a problem coming into the venue 
before to promote, so it seemed a little odd and out of place that we were 
turned away at the door.  In any case, water under the bridge as far as I'm 
concerned.
Eat Fresh,
Joey Frisco

I had a bomb ass time. The D&B was rockin and the happycore was hoppin.=20
Is it just me, though, or has cloudskipper lost his touch? Maybe he
was just as drunk as I was, but I think that dude's seriously lost his
'flow'. No real consistency -- no building from one track to the next,
no 'peaks' in the music.. just kinda went.

Hey and um. Sorry for puking on your patio guys. Highlife + hard
alcohol =3D meh. :(

Tiesto offering truly tedious

By YURI WUENSCH, SPECIAL TO THE EDMONTON SUN

Last year, I missed my window of opportunity to critically lambaste 
Tiesto's In Concert DVD (out now on Blackhole Recordings), a deplorable 
display of unchecked ego and poor filmmaking. However, thanks to In Concert 
2, a virtual copycat of the first, my vitriol for the world's No. 1 DJ has 
an outlet.

The world of electronic dance is, inexplicably and to the best of my 
knowledge, the only genre of music to boast annual polls to determine which 
DJ is No. 1. For the last few years, Tiesto has been tops, the reigning 
king of trance and, in turn, the dance world. It's hard to dismiss trance's 
popularity - the 70,000 people that turned up for Tiesto's shows in Arnhem, 
Holland, and Hasselt, Belgium, last fall testify to it.

Tiesto also has the distinction of being the first and only DJ to have ever 
played the opening ceremonies of the Olympics.

You know this after watching In Concert 2 because, not unlike the first 
DVD, the house announcer tells the audience so, along with facts about 
Tiesto's mind-boggling record sales and other bits of egomania.

The In Concert 2 show sees Tiesto employing an elevated UFO-like stage, the 
same one used in the first concert DVD. As a visual element, it's an 
admittedly inspiring piece of hardware complemented by pyrotechnics and 
intricate light displays.

But as high up as Tiesto is on that pedestal, he's that much further 
removed from his audience. In his defence, it's probably something of an 
occupational hazard. To accommodate such a large crowd, certain performance 
concessions likely had to be made.

Still, it's hard not to see what's lost as a result. Good DJs will read and 
respond to the crowd, the interplay between the two being integral to 
dance's dynamics. But In Concert 2 is just Tiesto as deified spectacle 
rather than audience co-conspirator.

At larger rave-styled events, the crowd often becomes the show, anyway. The 
best parties boast costumed characters and a colour parade that is all but 
ignored on In Concert 2.

The camera never strays far from Tiesto, only briefly interspersing shots 
of the crowd or the occasional buxom European lass as an afterthought. No 
matter how many camera angles you employ, a grinning Dutchman behind the 
decks will get old real fast.

The direction of the concert is equally tedious, a hodgepodge of jump cuts, 
bad edits and flash over substance. There's never a correlation between 
what's happening musically and how the video plays out.

The lack of continuity is compounded by the preponderance of stock shots - 
I think I saw the same hands pointing skyward a dozen times. If the imagery 
had been synced to the beats, it might have been more tolerable. As it 
wasn't, I found myself simply listening to In Concert 2 because watching it 
gave me a headache.

I was more impressed with Tiesto's skills as a DJ on this particular 
outing, but only marginally so. Produced in Dolby 5.1, the music is crisp 
and clean and you can actually hear him working the mix, or at least 
attempting to. I don't mind hearing a DJ struggle with a mix if only 
because it at least shows they're trying. However, when you bring the mix 
full-stop, as Tiesto does on a couple of occasions, it's either because of 
a complete lack of technical ability, showboating or both.

Even with the mix's inconsistencies, there are still some killer pumping 
trance tracks. In particular, the three Tiesto tunes remixed by DJ Montana 
are monsters, especially Breda 8pm.

When trance doesn't fall prey to a patterned structure of big peaks and 
teetering breakdowns, instead keeping things punchy and rolling, the appeal 
is undeniable. However, Tiesto unerringly gives the beats breathers and 
those lulls stymie the mix's flow.

There are also some live vocal performances mixed in as part of the show, 
featuring Matt Hales from Aqualung and a large choir-like ensemble of girls 
known as the Children of Orpheus. They're decent enough, though the way 
they're presented had me thinking less trance and more Lord of the Dance.

While I obviously have no love for either the first or second concert DVDs, 
I do honestly hold hope for a third. Or maybe you just had to be there. 
Still, I do think the potential is there for DVDs like this to be done better.

Nah, Chris is a kick ass DJ.  Last week at HHJJ he tore that shit up.  
Probably had an off night or got spoiled with free beer before the set.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE: 5/6 doublethinnk - thanx Modified!

#1 - I live in that warehouse.  Flyers were never a problem at our
first few events there.  However, the last 2 parties it has gotten a
lot worse.  The flyering issue has come up on this mailing list before
and has/is talked about by many promoters.  It's just not cool to have
to cleanup peoples' flyers, period.

#2 - Modified has only printed one flyer.  That flyer was put out
almost two years ago.

#3 - I very rarely get into parties for free unless I am doing sound,
helping to setup/cleanup, or DJing.  I make it a point to pay other
events I go to.  Perhaps if promoters set a standard by paying to get
into all the events they show up to in order to "drop off some flyers,
shake some hands, and promote a couple of up coming events" it would
help the scene "to keep the cycle of parties and promotion active."

#4 - Modified events on average, pull about 100-150 people right now @
my place.  New Years was the only party we would have walked away with
more then a couple hundred bucks in our pockets.  What happened at New
Years?  We gave out full refunds at the door as the PD kicked everyone
out.  How often does that happen?  How big of a dick does that make
me?
=09Myself and a couple of others have been barely breaking even or
sometimes taking losses since Modified started.  It was our hope we
could build a name and earn peoples trust in order to do something
other then renegades.
=09How much do you think rent is on a warehouse?  Lets do some quick
math.  We had roughly 120 paying people Friday night.  That's $1800 @
the door.  By the time you minus rent, decor (we watered down and
repainted over half of the space), new lighting, patrolled parking and
all those last minute stupid things you never think about (zip ties,
string, broken/stolen needles, etc.) maybe you can understand the $15
cost.  Perhaps we should lower ticket price and pack 500 people in
there?
=09Those first few $3-$5 parties we did set a standard.  A standard that
just isn't financially viable outside of what we were doing before.=20
Let's face reality - it takes money to throw parties.  If people want
a place to party where they aren't going to be hassled like they are
at other spaces, aren't going to be packed like cattle into the venue,
and can generally expect a good time, then they have to be willing to
pay a cover that will at least pay for the party.

#5  We don't search (maybe we should start) - people get flyers in

Joey -  I apologize if I came off as an asshole.  I did not intend to.
 Parties are a bit stressful for promoters last time a checked.  if it
really was such a big deal to you, I invite you and the other two
other people I am assuming also wanted to get in  - free of charge -
to come to my next show and flyer for your event.  All I ask is that
you stay after to clean up.

my beef with that venue is the lack of bathrooms.  what's up with that?

ONE bathroom (which was non-functioning by the middle of the event - 
big surprise) is NOT enough for that place.  i'm guessing that the 
kiddies don't know any better, so i will speak up on their behalf here.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  Come down to Folded tonight!!

Thanks to everyone who came down on Friday, it was our best night in quite
a while, lots of dancing and smiles and familiar faces.  :)

I found out after the fact that there was a problem with the drink
promotion (they gave out crappy mixed drink shots instead of vouchers and
left early on top of that), sorry to anyone that came down for cheap vodka
and got stuck with the regular price, hit me up next month and I'll buy
you a drink.

a. no hard feelings.  i got a smirnoff uber deluxe illuminated coke 
mirror.  not that i touch the stuff (coke*, I do touch smirnoff).  but 
it's the most fabulously 70s thing i have ever seen.  and the fizzy cheap 
little shot things were fine.  small, and fizzy.  i actually ran into one 
of the major SFLoveParade planners who was there with her parents, and she 
talked her non-drinking mom into having one (the fizzy little shot, not 
the coke mirror)... so there's an upside.

b. that bartender wants to kill me.  he can sense when I've decided to buy 
my last drink, and insists on buying me one a few minutes later.  funny 
guy.  what was that, a red headed slut?

c. while i'm not a huge fan of sax + keys + house (spending time in san 
jose, you get 6000% your USRDA of that stuff at the hands of one Harry Who 
:P) but that was some cool shit to see go down live.

d. george was having so much fun he didn't get to pee.  which is all good 
except that means i didn't get to play bass (as NewStyleSound LLC's second 
string bassist).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE: 5/6 doublethinnk - thanx Modified!

Well, honestly... if you would have ever come to one of our (DTS) events, 
and wanted to promote an upcoming party, we would have shaken your hand and 
invited you (and usually one other promoter per party) into the space to do 
your thing (we had three people for two parties).  It's just the edicate and 
respect we show for other crews and promoters that are trying to throw 
parties and do positive things for the scene.  A lot of other crews that I 
am indirectly involved with have the same two promoter or promoter +1 
policy.  It actually seems to be the standard, especially with the crews 
that post on bayraves, evolic, dts, hcftp, etc...  I understand that you are 
trying to do something different without posting on some of these resources, 
but I don't understand that you don't show the same respect and courtesy to 
others that they would show to you or any other crew trying to come up and 
do right.  Especially after we talked to you at the door and explained that 
you were welcome to promote at our parties and informed you that we only 
wanted to walk through.  It seemed like you were basically telling us that 
you didn't give a fuck about anyone other than your crew and how you did 
that night.  It came across like this, "I don't want to clean up your 
flyers; I don't pass flyers out at your party; why should I help you promote 
your party or perpetuate the scene if I don't print flyers and hand them out 
at your parties; you're here and there are two hours left in the party, so, 
I'm gonna charge you as much as I can even though I know that you're only 
gonna be here for a few minutes; actually, in the end guys, go fuck 
yourselves because I don't care about anyone other than modified 
productions."  It just sucks when people monkey wrench instead of oil the 
metaphorical rave machine.  It really doesn't benefit anyone to be a an 
asshole, if you were that stressed about money for your party, you should 
have said so instead of coming across like the nazi supervisor of the food 
line at a concentration camp.  In anycase, no hard feelings really, I just 
think that it was a shitty decision on your part and that you were a dick 
for whatever reason (evidently you don't think that you should help other 
crews out).  Like I said in my last post, it's all water under the bridge to 
me.  Best of luck in future endeavors.
Cordially,

Subject: [sfraves] Saturday Night Adventure!!

The night started out pretty mellow... I wasn't really planning on doing
more than mellow really (well.. mellow IMO.. Hello 2day)

I mean.. ok.. so like it was a small lil' thingie @ GregJ's pad & ooh.. so
fun!!  Then... well.. I was suppose 2 go 2 Reverb @ Sno Drift 'cause i was
like GL & stuff & I wanted 2 C some Homies I ain't seenin a while... but
ummm.. lol.. didn't make it there unfortunately... Sorry B.. reallly
wanted 2 hang w/ U Homie! =\

Instead.. a crew of us wented to the ummm Taurus (sp) party in SOMA 'cause
there was this GL thing that we were on or soemthing... unfortunately..
that didn't pan out either 'cause by the time we got there.. it was max
capcity.... Oh Well... la la la la la la la...

Fortunately... Anu was right down the alley way from the Taurus shindig &
well.. although I been hella wanting 2 say HI 2 all the people who were @
the Art Gallery like Ripple, Wish, or like Odeed who i ain't seen or talk
2 in a while... my home 4 the night was Anu.. WOW... YAY.. Hello 2day...
saw like sooo many of my Jungle Fam there & I was soooo fuckin' Happy &
felt soo much Love there, honestly... it was So Dope!  LoL.. 1st person I
ran in2 was long lost just moved back 2 Cali from Hicksville 1 of my Fave
Jungle DJs & my DNB Big Bro Kryptyk =)  YAY!!  Awesome.. we caught up,
talked.. then some1 started like 2 pretend strangle my neck from behind..
YAY!!!  It was MC Child!!  So Dope!

Ummmmmm.. Method ONe was on the decks & was spinning "the History of DNB"
& I guess when i got there.. he was around the 97-98 era of Jungle...
LoL.. yeah.. I'm so bullshitting my ass off right now like i know what i'm
talkin' about.. but yeah man.. that set was fuckin' SICK!!!  I Loved it!! 
MC DUH was n the Mic switching off w/ Child.. LoL.. it was Dope!!  I
mean.. the crowd was Sick & feelin' it & yeah... I guess U can say the set
was totally anthematic (if that's a word).. o h Gosh man... it was So
Dope!  Then.. @ the end of his set.. he busted out fuckin' New Order..
LOL.. in honor of Coachella...

OK.. but that wasn't it.. I mean.. I was on a quest 2 eventually get a
ride hime... that didn't pan out... so a bunch of us from Anu decided 2
check out this Rave in Potrero Hills & well.. it was kinda eeeh.... like
it felt like a bunch of clubbers 2gehter in a basement & I dunno.. i
didn't really get a Ravey kinda vibe.. but none the less.. it was a Sick
lil Undergounrd!!  I had so much fun!!!  Wow!!  LoL.. I even had a 8 foot
long snake wrapped around me @ 1 point during the party.. LOLOLMAO..

Hope y'all had a Groovy Weekend! =)

DJ Spooky Raps About Remixing

By Katie Dean

Story location: http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,67261,00.html

02:00 AM May. 09, 2005 PT

DJ Spooky relies heavily on sampling in his work as a DJ and musician. So 
it shouldn't be a surprise that his new book and CD sample audio recordings 
of some of literature's great remixers: writers whose work "sampled" other 
people's material.

DJ Spooky, whose real name is Paul D. Miller, is an artist, musician and 
writer at the forefront of using technology to remix art and culture.

Now, he's sharing his ideas about art, music, sampling and remixing in his 
first book, Rhythm Science. The book comes with a CD of tracks that mixes 
music with literary works by the likes of James Joyce and Gertrude Stein.

Creative Commons guru Lawrence Lessig calls the book "the story of how 
freedom would build better science and art."

In addition to his writing, Miller has a new album out this spring with 
rapper Chuck D and Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo.

He's also been an advocate for peer-to-peer software, filing an amicus 
brief in the landmark MGM Studios v. Grokster case, because he believes 
peer-to-peer can be used to foster collaboration between artists. It also 
leads to greater creativity by exposing listeners to a diverse mix of music.

Miller stopped by the Wired News office for a chat about his book, his new 
album and his thoughts on sampling culture and copyright.

Wired News: Why did you decide to write a book? What message do you want to 
convey?

Paul D. Miller: I think so many issues right now around sampling and 
digital media in general are kind of at a crossroads.... I was fascinated 
with these issues, but at the same time I felt that there hadn't been a 
book by a DJ about the whole DJ process. It's not just playing records ... 
it's about record players, crowds (and) social environments. So the book 
was a snapshot of that -- a screensaver so to speak -- of how you can have 
this kind of technologically conditioned social culture. And as a 
practicing artist I realized there hadn't been that many books, in fact 
none, written by other DJs. It's always a critic or something.

WN: Do you ever run into problems with copyright when sampling music?

Miller: I sample all sorts of stuff. The strategy, of course, is to make it 
unrecognizable. That means sampling has to be a kind of shredder -- the 
equivalent of when you throw away your credit card bill and put it through. 
I throw away certain recorded sounds and shred them so they are 
unrecognizable in the same way you would trace someone's credit identity. 
They do come after you for both cases.

WN: There was a recent case of NWA using a snippet of George Clinton's 
music, and a court ruled that even though the sample was unrecognizable, 
NWA still had to secure rights to use it.

Miller: That means they didn't change it enough. Basic rule of thumb: ... 
you don't want to get sued.

It's a nightmare. There (are) lawyers. There are websites who filter 
through all records -- everything. People are paid to just listen to music 
at this point and listen for samples....

In the same way a lot of people involved with internet hacking culture will 
hack your site and then call you up and say "By the way, we have security 
services we'd like to offer you," you might get a little phone call saying, 
"There is a sample on your record that we heard, and we'd be more than 
happy to clear it for you." Of course implying that if you don't, the next 
phone call will be to the people you sampled.

It's a paradoxical world. On one hand, sampling is a homage to your 
favorite records and favorite sounds, but you have to pay through the nose 
if you feel like doing that.

So for my current book, Rhythm Science, what I did was find audio companion 
material that was based on writers whose works I really enjoyed: Gertrude 
Stein, James Joyce, Kurt Schwitters, even people like Patti Smith, and then 
remix that in a way that everything was cleared and crisp. It was no problem.

WN: You cleared it legally.

Miller: Yeah.

WN: Why did you choose those readings in particular?

Miller: They were authors whose work I felt reflected a lot of the issues 
with sampling.

Take for example James Joyce. He would take motifs from posters in the city 
streets when he was walking and have a notepad and write them down, and 
they would appear in his book. He would sample stuff from advertising, from 
other authors, from magazine articles.

Or Gertrude Stein, because she had this repetitive style of speaking and 
her writing reflected that; Antonin Artaud, because he was involved with a 
lot of theater scripting.

To me, with hip-hop and electronic music, you are looking at sound as a 
kind of theater, where samples are almost like voices that you can take 
from a script.... Pretty much everybody on (the record) was involved in 
some way, shape or form with creating a critique of literature and how 
stories were told.

WN: Do you think there should be some kind of sampling license?

Miller: Yeah, I think we need to find a good middle ground. I think it's 
slowly evolving. I'm a huge fan of the Creative Commons scene because they 
are giving people some of the tools necessary to get some sanity into the 
system.

WN: There's an argument that sampling isn't really music; music is playing 
an instrument and composing. How do you respond to that?

Miller: (Sampling) is an inheritor of folk culture where a lot of people 
would know the same songs, but each person would make their own version. 
That's what happened with blues, that's what happened with jazz, but those 
were much more refined patterns of folk culture.

But if you look at gypsy music, for example, or Rai music out of the 
northeast part of the Middle East, or India, there are so many different 
traditions that have somehow managed to become part of (the) recording 
process. If you look at Indian classical music, so many records are 
parallel to one another, but that's because they're a folk culture.

And also they didn't have the same kind of copyright laws, so people would 
record different versions of the same thing, no problem, that was part of 
the culture.

But with sampling, it implies a personalization of that. You're not only 
participating in a culture with all your peers and friends -- again 
peer-to-peer networks, that's the pun -- but you're able to make your own 
versions, send that to friends in that part of literally the entire network 
culture that we live in right now.

WN: In addition to the book, you've completed a new album with Chuck D and 
Dave Lombardo from Slayer. Tell us about it.

Miller: The record is called Drums of Death. It's a sense of humor about, 
kind of, heavy metal meets hip-hop.... Right now it seems much more like 
everything has become so compartmentalized. It's sort of the playlist 
mentality where you have this genre like hip-hop, rock.... Everything is 
put in its little genre and that's it.

I want to make a genre that's a blur -- where your iPod is malfunctioning, 
and next thing you know your hip-hop is in the rock section of your 
playlist, and your rock has gone over to your dub section, and your reggae 
section is mixed into your jazz and your classical music is sprinkled over 
everything.

So thinking about that was a kind of a fun way of jumping back in ... like 
getting Chuck D to rhyme more like his old-school style. And the guys from 
Slayer, the drummer Dave Lombardo is amazing, it was really fun working 
with him. That's the only person that was live. I had to fly out to L.A. 
and we recorded him in his garage outside of L.A.

WN: And Chuck D?

Miller: He sent me (the music) files.

WN: What happened with Flava Flav?

Miller: It didn't fit. It wasn't the right project.... He is better for 
reality TV at this point. But again, that's nothing negative, it's just ... 
I felt like I wanted to evoke a certain kind of Public Enemy....

(We used) a classic sort of '70s big synthesizer (vocorder) that you run 
voices through. We ended up making a synthetic voice to replace Flav that 
kind of evoked the same kind of call and response. So Chuck D does his 
thing and instead of going back and forth (with Flava Flav), it goes to the 
computer.

WN: You also downloaded a Muslim prayer to use in "The B-Side Wins Again," 
right? What else have you found online?

Miller: Oh yeah, the call to prayer. That's a scratching on "B-Side Wins 
Again." I just have a hair of it. You can get everything (online) from U.S. 
soldiers rapping -- have you heard about the Baghdad raps?

If you just do a quick Google search, there are people uploading video 
clips of themselves rhyming about being in Baghdad, and there are bombs 
going off. But there are also people making audio recordings of the war and 
putting them online.

At this point in the game you can find all sorts of stuff online. One of my 
favorite websites for experimental music and sound peeps is called UbuWeb, 
and they have MP3s that are also shareware of historical recordings by 
artists too. I try as much as possible to support a lot of different things.

"It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the 
world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those 
years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a 
world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite 
and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination 
practiced in past centuries ..."

No no no no no no no no no no no no

Look at:
EAW
Community
Mackie even
Meyer (haha!)
EV
McCauley
etc

For home monitors, look for some of those Mackie SRMs.. they sound
fine.

I don't much care for JBLs of any stripe, and the EONs everybody's got
even less....  But they're cheap used and I've heard them sound
half-decent before.

But no Peavey.  Peavey actually translates in audioese to: "CRAP!". 
It's sort of a swear word, actually.

"Jesus christ, I just dropped that amp rack on my foot!  PEAVEY!!!"

Subject: [sfraves] [NRR] Can anyone help me ID this game?

I know this is totally random, but i was just sitting here at work and this 
image of this game i used to play way back in the day popped into my head 
and i can't for the life of me remember what the name of it was.

I think it was a Sierra game, but i could be wrong it did have similar 
graphics as....say...police quest III which is why i think it might be a 
Sierra game.

Anyway, it was like a life simulation game, where you picked your dude and 
you had some money, and you had to get an apartment, and get a job, and go 
to school and earn a degree and shit like that.  It was like a top down 
kinda view, of a map of the "city" where it had differant places like a 
McDonalds looking place, and a school and you could get a job at mcdonalds 
until you got enough of a education to get a better job.  When you'd go from 
location to location, you'd see a little marble like thing rolling around to 
the next location.

I know this is a weird random memory, but the name of this game is bugging 
the hell out of me.  I've spent nearly an entire day here at work just 
trying to find the name of it, but so far no luck, so i figured i try the 
next best thing.  YOU GUYS!!!

So please someone out there...you have to know what i'm talking about, and 
if so please let me know so i can put my mind at ease.

Buck Murdock

DIRTY

9th and Folsom, SF
FREE b4 10:30 & only $5 after that

featuring:
Reid Speed (Breakbeat Science) L.A.
- special breaks and electro set

Drum'n'bass and two-step DJ Reid Speed started DJing her senior year
in high school, two years after she entered New York City's dance
music community. Formally known as Reid Margolis, Speed started
playing out just short of a year after she began spinning. Her local
career swiftly took off, as she was soon playing at a large handful of
local parties and received her first rotating residency, all within
two years. Her affiliation with Stuck on Earth promotions began when
founder, Chris Kausch, caught her at a local event. In April of 1998,
her knowledge and experience landed her a job at DJ Dara's record
store, Breakbeat Science. Working in the well-known store exposed
Speed to many promoters and artists and gave her an avenue to further
her DJing. The job also lead to her residency at DJ Seoul's Direct
Drive nights. She has worked on productions with FS (of Ming & FS) and
her first mix CD, Reeespect, was released through Stuck on Earth in
early 2001.

PLEASE READ WITH CAUTION THIS IS A NOTE WITH LOTS OF ME BITCHING, (I AM

YOU PROCEED, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK, IF THIS CAUSES A FLAME WAR FOR ANY 
REASON, PLEASE SEND ALL EMAILS TO

IF YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME FOR DISCUSSION ON FORGIVENESS, 
LOVE AND RANDOM ACTS OF ME SHOWING MY BUTT TO NICE PEOPLE, PLEASE EMAIL ME 
AT LALALALA@STILLCANTHEARYOU.COM
I WILL CONSIDER THIS TO BE SOMEWHAT EDUCATIONAL SIMULATION TO WHAT IT WOULD 
BE LIKE IF YOU WERE ANNA NICHOL SMITH'S DINNER.  IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU DID 
NOT GET ANYTHING GOOD FROM THIS EMAIL, PLEASE READ THIS NEXT SENTENCE OVER 
AND OVER:
"DESPITE PREVIOUS THOUGHT, RICHARD SIMMONS DOES, IN FACT, LOVE YOU VERY, 
VERY MUCH!"
.
(ENTER)  <--CLICK ON THIS
I bet you a hundred bux  nuthin happenned  huh?
pretty cool eh...okay, here we go...hold on...
to simply put it, I was very dissapointed with this party I went to last 
night
I hereby call this "review of the asshole party from hell, owned/ran and 
secured by assholes and put on by people who treated me like an asshole  
because I tried to help out my fellow friends and joyful, warm UGSF 
community from getting ripped off, apparently, I had bad timing?  
Humanitarians are bad mmmmkaay.  Still processing that one.   "DO unto 
others as others would have done unto you"  So I wanted to bring it to your 
attention that Christ was lying to all of us, it is just propaganda...found 
out last ngith and am pretty bummed, we have all been fooled.
     okay...so some of you may be thinking what "what the hell is up with 
this guy?"  "who gives him the right ?" "Is he on crack?"  "lots of run -on 
sentences that don't make too much sense right now" "where do you think he 
got that really cool re-entry stamp that doesn't work?"  "Is he single?"  
(if you asked if I was single, give yourself one point.  Points will be 
tallied at end of rant for the "Re-Entry Stamp Contest"
here is where we began....I used to be Kathy Lee Gifford's best friend-naw, 
just kidding, now seriously..
I started partying summer of '96 and consistently went to parties every 
weekend for several years. (ouch) I have been a promoter of parties up in 
Humboldt County (humboldt Rave Collective) as well as dj and drinker of fine 
wine and fernet..  I am friend to many and usually end up being one of the 
rare persons who walks around at parties to make sure "people are okay." you 
may have recognized me at a party, just keep an eye out for a guy who says 
"hey!, how are you doing, are you okay?"  And the ones who aren't, Whack 'em 
  ever so slightly on the back of their heads with a book on "forgiveness.") 
    You can find one of these books under your grandmothers's collection of 
National Geographic mags in the bathroom.  trust me . Usually, they are 
fine,(suspected Rick Jame's types)   which you will find out very quickly... 
anyhoo, I digress like Martha Stewart's ankle bracelet....
   Last night, my friends and I went to the Taurus party on purpose, a 
location that resembled an old gallery similar to "True Love" party from 
back in the day, that means "a long time ago"
okay...this may start a big thing on the list, whatever, I am a size queen 
and proud...I am very pissed off and extremely dissapointed with how the 
Taurus party went last night.  The door guy stopped us as there was a long 
line at the entrance to the party, we waited patiently for 15 minutes or so 
before entry, not a problem at all.line behind us grew more and more.  The 
music was great, wonderful I started to see many familiar faces from both 
Santa Cruz and SF from what I could see while waiting and watching 30 or so 
peeps zip right on in with their "reentry stamps."
   These were real, authentic ink stamps in which the door guy, or dude/girl 
stamps the inside of your right wrist for the soul purpose of you being able 
to  "RE-ENTER"
RULE NUMBER .5: IF YOU ARE THROWING A PARTY AND YOU HAVE RE-ENTRY STAMPS, I 
WOULD PUSH THE WONDERFUL IDEA OF ACTUALLY LETTING YOUR GUESTS 
"RE-ENTER"---trust me, I know, this seems simple...but as I learned last 
night, it really is not.  I will explain later.
   We were finally let in at 11:30pm with our "re-entry stamps"  I was 
stoked.  The space was nice, not decorated at all.  Seemed very last 
minute-ish  White walls, lots of room inside for all the people outside 
waiting inline to come on in.  Nope.  The rave hula hooopers were going 
crazy taking up all the space...grrrr.  I wanted to *crop dust them. We 
settled outside to have a smoke, chilled a bit.  I got up to go take a wee 
wee in the potty and alittle on my right shoe (of course, like duh)  as I 
walked to the bathrooms (which were located at the entrance way next to one 
of the few, very creative decorations that said "Free re-entry stamps that 
don't work, unless you pay 10-20$$ more at the door")   I did not think 
anything of it, I was just happy to have my re-entry stamp...ya know, in 
case I had to find someone, or maybe take someone safely to their car so 
they can avoid being killed by a meanie muni driver who has never had the 
priveledge to ever get a real re-entry stamp that did not work. I heard they 
were no longer letting people inside the party this was around 12:15am
Interesting.  I thought, "good god if they had been to any of the old school 
harmony parties/Lepidoptera parties, they would have had a cornary or 
35...when the locations were sooo slammed full that walking anywhere, you 
could not help to avoid stepping on hands, faces, lotion, candy bracelets, 
or your boyfriend.  I did not understand, maybe there were regulations with 
space owner that I could not figure out.
  Friend and I were waiting on a couple of others to get inside, was not 
sure if it was going to happen.  I was concerned, we had no cells to 
communicate.

I go back to the front to see if I could see my buddies in line, not there, 
then I hear that people who were being let in were being charged 
20-30$$$$$$$ a piece instead OF  THE ADVERTISED 10$
that was stated on the flyer and in local calenders.
HUH? WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?  I figured people were being charged extra as an 
"I am waiting inline inconvenience fee" (if they had the nerve to charge 
extra, I really was not putting it past them)  I was pretty upset, as were 
many others who had just been waiiting up to a half hour for a party with no 
decorations, one bathroom, and one sound area.  If the music had not been 
great, I thing I would have staged an "anti-plur riot" which involves lots 
of farting and quickly moving thru the crowd, waiting for a small and secret 
uproar.

After finding out the shit that was being done by the staff at the front, I 
went to find the promoter (yay, proactivity)  I ran into Little John and 
asked if he new who I could speak with and he pointed to a gentleman.  "go 
talk to him"
  Alrighty....anyone who has ever known me, knows that my intent is about 
99% good always unless I am dealing with an ex boyfriend.  I aproached the 
tall, sweaty guy, who was previously djing, I introduced myself and told him 
what I was hearring and seeing from the door.  I let him know that the last 
bunch of peeps were charged over the advertised price by the guy at the 
door.  He totally snapped at me.  what the fuck do you expect me to do?!?!" 
the spaceowner is a bitch,I really dont have time for this shit"

                                                        ummmm, whoa
                                                               dude, 
breathe...
   I mean, really...
                                  Downward dog...
stretch, breathe,
  I tried to find a new way to approach him, more diplomaticaly than before, 
He was just really pissed off.  Apparently his evenning was not going the 
way he wanted.  Due to the owner being a *hagatha biotch.  I wish he would 
have pointed me in her direction so  my lil elfen friends could attack her 
and take her make up off with keebler crackers and stuff. .  Grrrrrr.  Where 
was my big rubber "PLUR" stamp when I needed it, it would have fit perfectly 
right in the center of his forehead.

RULE NUMBER 1 WHEN PROMOTOTING/THROWING PARTIES:  IF YOU ARE GOING TO THROW 
A PARTY, YOU MUST TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SO OR DONT FUCKING DO IT!!!
pretty please

RULE NUMBER 1.5 DONT BE MEAN TO PEOPLE WHO TRY TO HELP YOU
(i THINK THAT MAY EVEN BE IN THE BIBLE, OR A COOKBOOK i SAW ONCE)

RULE NUMBER 2: PEOPLE WHO BRING HULAS TO INDOOR 150MAX CAPACITY PARTIES 
BETTER BE  AS SPECTACULAR AS MOTHER THERESA IN A THONG BEKINI PLUS CHARGE 
FOR 3 EXTRA TICKETS, EVEN THOUGH THE HULAS TAKE UP ROOM FOR TEN.

   You will only jeopardize yourself and the people who may be dumb enough 
to actually attend. I found my friend who was djing and talked to her about 
what was going on...apparently she knows the promoter very well.
"you are kidding!", she pulls the guy away from his relaxed converstaion 
with his friend after he had just yelled at me for "not having time"   I 
wanted to give him a hula hoop if he was going to stand there But then 
again, who really wants to talk to someone like me if they are making 4 
months worth in rent for the evenning by ripping other's off.*
  Thank god for miss "M" ladies out there, I love ya, really I do.
Smoke/processing time-I go outside to chill, hearing more people talking 
about that $$ at the door factor, still, other friends were not there yet 
who we were supposed to meet.  It was now around 1:30 or so...
On top of everything, there was a very nice boy, flirting with me, then 
telling me how I should live my life in regards to smoking and drinking.  I 
was certain it was my mom fucking with me.
nope.  It wasn't my mom, I asked him what her middle name was and he told me 
  it was "george"  He continued to say that people who drink whiskey are 
drunks....sorry dude, my AA sponsor says otherwise (bad joke)

RULE NUMBER ONE IN DATING/FLIRTING:  DONT TELL PEOPLE THEY SUCK BEFORE YOU 
EVEN FUCK!!!
---it really wont help you get laid, I swear! (but did you notice how nice 
and manipulative he was from the get go? very similar to someone wanting you 
to eat their fingertip chilli special..or something
RULE NUMBER 2: IF YOU CAN RECOGNIZE AN OLD FREAKY KARMIC RELATIONSHIP WITHIN 
THE FIRST 5 MINUTES WHILE YOU ARE ALREADY KINDA STRESSED/WORRIED, WALK AWAY, 
COME BACK AND REINTRODUCE YOURSELVES IN THE NEXT LIFE WHEN THINGS ARE 
HOPEFULLY MORE CALM, AND YOU NO LONGER SMOKE CIGGIES.

I started ponderring the idea that maybe I was the one causing all this 
trouble...In a situation where there is all sorts of BS, oh, fuck 
it...BULLSHIT.  So you can kind of say I was being sensitive, but it really 
hurt my feelings...partying up here for sooo long, then they (not knowing 
who "they" actually are) charge that much while keeping the crowd soo 
thinned, I think they planted the hula hoopers like cage dancers in a sleeze 
club.  And there was still a huge crowd out in front from what I could see, 
apparently Osby was even spotted by the Crocodile Hunter knawing on a rubber 
tire.  So there were tuns of peeps that did not get in, Aaron Jae was having 
a bitch of a time too...it was just over all kinda sucky that there was all 
this going on.  It really ruined it.  I let it get to me because I am very 
opinionated with the politcal aspects of parties.  I love parties.  I love 
people who go to them.  Whatmad eme mad most of all is knowing that I REALLY 
do try everyday to go out of my way to help others have a good time.  A good 
time in a good honest fashion with good love and food, and stuffs.  Since 
when do we fuck humanitarian type folks? Are they good lays or wonderful 
scapegoats for the Gargamels of life?
I will be praying for forgiveness, hitting myself in the back of the head 
with that forgiveness book from grandma's for years to come as it is as 
diddapointing as if I were shaped like an oscar meyer weiner or something 
that is weirder looking...just for being a humanitarian typa guy who got a 
real "re-entry stamp.

RULE NUMBER 4ISH: IF YOU ARE PROMOTING A PARTY/ORGANIZER OF A PARTY, TALK 
WITH THE MANAGER/HAGATHA BIOTCH OF THE LOCATION AND GET EVERYTHING IN 
WRITING AHEAD OF TIME SO YOU DONT GET FUCKED, SO THEY DONT GET FUCKED, AND 
SO WE DONT GET FUCKED.  AT LEAST MAKE SURE THERE IS LUBE IF YOU CANT WORK 
SHIT OUT...CUZ IN THE END THERE JUST MIGHT BE SHIT, OH WAIT, ENEMA, WRONG 
NOUN, LUBE IS IF YOU ARE LIKE ALL DRY AND STUFF....DUH
WHERE DID MY BEER GO?
IS THIS STILL RECORDING?


Unfair. To me, others who paid that money, unfair to the people who charged 
it, especially if they thought that was an okay thing to do.  Be forewarned, 
you may meet a person in the next life who tries hitting on you then tells 
you that you are fucked up...see the irony?

I THINK RULE NUMBER 3: KARMA IS A BITCH AND i WANT TO SLAP HER

Okay, nearring the climax here folks...love that word, I digress.  and 
squeeze my nipple . After all this, I went outside to get my buddy to head 
out I told him to meet me out front.  He was a little bit out of it.  I get 
to the front, passing people still waiting in line for the hula hooper space 
taker-uppers to stop so they can come in and play as well..I went out the 
front door and the security guy states "NO RE-ENTRY, ONCE YER OUT YER OUT!"  
I showed him my stamp, he really could give a rats ass, actually, now that I 
think of it, I probably would have had an easier time getting back in if I 
did give him a rat's ass (like attracts like)  I told him that my friend was 
supposed to come out side and I was looking for him because he was a little 
"drunk"
   Security guy says this "WELL YOUR FRIEND SHOULDN"T HAVE COME TO THIS 
PARTY IF HE WAS DRUNK!"
-----okay, here when it gets good......
My thoughts:  1. did he just tell me my friend should not have come to the 
party  drunk?  Partying sober is fine, I dont have a problem with the other 
side of it either.  But if you go to a party, watch yourself, dont go 
overboard...there are people who keeps their eyes open for that usually  =)
                    2. This guy apparently did not realize they were selling 
booze inside, I guess it is pretty easy to look the other way when you are 
working security at an unpermitted space for a minimal wage
                   3.They have had people in and out all night
                    4 and most importantly my friend was not inside, not in 
front and really, all I wanted to do was find him, make sure he was alive 
and go to bed.  It is okay to make sure people are okay in certain places 
right?  Good, I dont hear any disagreements there...

   I was soooo pissed off, I told the guy I was going back in to look one 
more time and he was not wanting to let me...
you wanna hear what happens when you piss off the nice guy?  I went up to 
him, pretty close too  (I am so proud of myself for standing up for my 
friend and I by the way:P )  "If you really want to go there Sir, that is 
your name?  You just got out of college, okay understood.  Let me point out 
you the fact that you are a security guy WORKING A FUCKING RAVE in 
SF...usually that means there  unfortunatley will be a few peeps durring the 
evenning that need assistence, you should know this.  I have a fucking stamp 
on my wrist, I need to find my buddy, this aint bullshit. I am concerned and 
I am actually surprised that you aren't considerring your working conditions 
"
  so I looked in the yellow pages for a "re-entry stamp repair shop, cause 
mine obviously was not working, or was that the idea from the beginning so 
they can make more bling?  I have no idea.

    A big part of me writing this is not to bash anyone really, I want 
people to know that there are certain arenas within throwing parties that do 
need to be checked, marked, and really well-planned out.  Dont hire your old 
college friends who have no concept of what responsibilities are when 
working parties, unpermitted or not...
   Promoters: kind of like running a business aint it?  you want to make 
people feel safe, cared for, respected while at the same time, having the 
time of their lives.  Really, put effort into this, it is worth it.  The 
downside of poor planning can turn up a lot of shit, fines, injuries, and 
others...if you have people in the front doing security.  I would love it if 
I were to never have to deal with these certain lame-o security guys again.  
I have no idea what company they were with or if that was even the case.  
Maybe someone could be proactive and teach them a little compassion and 
possibly care for the work they do.  But dammit, if someone is sick, (which 
was not really the case) I want to know that there are others than friends 
who will at least, lemme reiderrate that AT LEAST let you back 
inside/outside so you can find them, so they can be cared for.
   I am also kicking myself in the butt because I threw that receipt away 
for my "re-entry stamp"  I was wanting to return it and get my $$ back.  I 
hope all others had a great and safe evenning.  I will not be back at that 
location ever agian, happily

>real re-entry stamps that don't work, are in fact really cool and effective 
>if used at proper locations.
>Anna Nichol's dinner must, in fact, be very very tasty..."Trim Spa 
>Babeeeeeeee"
*an old waiter trick of farting as you rush on by.  With hula hoopers its 
different, they seem to not notice because they have the hula protective 
barrier which becomes stronger as their drugs kick in...then they really 
can't smell it.  So what you do is ask to borrow the hula hoop to "try," 
then fart really quick and hand it back to them, then run away.  Make sure 
you are wearring a mask to hide your identity.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: EGR Records/Catharsis (hard techno/powernoise/electrotech)

Greets,

This upcoming week and a half contains 3 separate events in San Francisco 
featuring EGR Records artists Catharsis & Nadon... A summary is at the top 
followed by more in depth information on each event:

-----------

Tuesday evening 5/10  --  Catharsis vs Nadon @ HuggerMugger; hard 
techno/powernoise; midnight to 2am

Saturday 5/14 -- Catharsis @ Spin This!; various edgy goodness; rotation 
between DJs all evening.

Thursday 5/19 -- Catharsis @ Future; electotech/electroclash  11:45pm to 1am

-----------

If you had to choose only one I'd recommend the Future event as it is the 
opening night for this club and I'll be doing a different style than my 
usual for this event.. Definitely more approachable than hard 
techno/powernoise, but still aggressively mixed from vinyl!

Subject: [sfraves] Paris hilton, being dumb...

http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/05/film.paris.hilton.ap/index.htm=
l

Here's a few snippets that I personally enjoyed:

Q: Do you read blogs?

HILTON: What's that?

Q: Um, they're these things on the Internet where people write about
news and stuff.

HILTON: No, I don't really read anything on the Internet except my AOL
mail. I don't like people who sit on computers all day long and write
about people they don't know anything about.

Q: Paris, you just described my job.

(Her publicist, Rob Shuter, laughs.)

Q: What did you want to be when you were a little girl?

HILTON: A veterinarian, but then I realized I could just buy a bunch of ani=
mals.




Q: So what could you possibly do on "Simple Life 4"?

HILTON: Go to Maui.

Q: Why?

HILTON: They want to sex it up, have us more in swimsuits and stuff.

Q: But what would you do?

HILTON: I don't know. We could work as lifeguards or work in a hotel
or something.

Q: "Baywatch" tried that and it didn't work.

HILTON: Tried what?

Q: They went from the United States to Hawaii, which I guess is
technically the United States. Anyway, it didn't work. [Editor's note:
Hawaii, of course, is one of the United States.)

HILTON: (Silence.)

Yes, 'tis true.  The owner is 70, son doesn't want anything to do with the 
business, so he's looking for a buyer or, perhaps, someone to manage the 
place.  Hear it nets $2MM a year.

Subject: [sfraves] my first rave experience--tell me yours?

hi. i live in s.f. and on my 24th birthday (april 9th) friends took me
to my first rave ("stark raving mad") and i wrote about my experience
when i got home. that's what i've pasted below. i'm posting here
because i don't know anyone in the rave community, but i'm hoping to
meet some of you, maybe at an upcoming party? that's odd for me to
say, 'cause i'm anti-social--no, i used to be--but since that party
and another one, i'm feeling a newfound connectedness. at first i
ascribed it to the pill--and yeah, the pill deserves some credit--but
long after it wore off, the craving for community lingered.

- Bobby

----------------------------------------------------------

4.10.2005

i'm sitting here with a soggy towel stuffed into the back of my mouth.
not a proper mouthpiece, but better than the plastic bottle cap i spat
out after my molars mashed it down to a gnarled disc. my chew toy
before that was the mangled mess of what used to be a pen cap, and for
a while i even grinded down on a wad of bubble wrap.

jaw tension: a side effect of the pill jason set in my palm around van
ness and sutter, after we stepped off the 38 bus. a couple blocks
later, at the side of an office building, a nondescript guy guarding a
nondescript door whispered "shhhhh" and glanced down the sidewalk
before letting us in the basement. i sidestepped through sweaty
strangers and sat against a wall in a room painted with daycare-bright
gorillas and parrots. next to me two girls bit each other's lips,
their teeth glowing green under the black lights. another girl by the
turntables swung a fluorescent mesh of light trails all around her
body.

i raked my fingernails over my arm, but nothing.

in my usual role of detached observant i stuck to the wall and watched
djs flick lighters to see knobs on their equipment. i tend to walk
through real life as disembodied eyes and ears, forgetting i'm in the
office, the car, the restaurant. until someone addresses me. then i
twitch and say, "i was--i'm sorry--i was somewhere else." as a kid i
wouldn't even go into my mother's office unless she promised not to
introduce me to anyone. now, still, as i walk the stairs to my own
job, i incant, "remember to say good morning, remember to say good
morning." and i'm just as aloof at home, grinning when i walk into a
silent apartment, roommates gone or locked away. sometimes,
though--and this is sometimes--i counter my artful avoidance with a
calculated trip to the kitchen for apple juice. to flash my face, say
hi, ask some questions.

but i like my roommates, i like my coworkers. that's the hardest part
to explain. i like the bustle and clamor of a packed subway car--until
i recognize someone and walk toward the other end. this is why i have
a closet full of hooded sweatshirts.

tell me how to tactfully rephrase this sentiment: "i like you, all of
you, i really do, and i appreciate the invitation--that's actually my
favorite restaurant in the city--but if i go, if i go and the
conversation turns to me and you ask me how maryland's climate
compares to california's, i will--and this does not reflect on any of
you--i will shove a gun in my mouth midsentence. not to die, not to be
away from you, but to be alone."

maryland actually gets really hot, a lot hotter than here in the
summer, but the winters--click, bang.

so there's the backstory of my intractable reclusiveness, meaning that
i descended into this underground party as a silent spy, like one of
the little robots sent down to collect tea cup fragments from
titanic's hull. i kept my back to the jungle mural and sifted details:
fire-orange vinyl purses, knee-high striped socks, "this is my rave
shirt."

for what felt like an hour i turned over a water bottle until a warm
glow from my feet crept up my ankles and spread through my calves,
while a soft vapor gauze clung to my arms, wrapping in moist layers.
simple sensations, like a sudden awareness of friction between the air
and my forearms, triggered my hands to carve slices through the
humidity, automatic as a reflex, controllable but not chosen, not any
more than i decided to dilate my pupils or sweat through my shirt.

someone handed me a flyer i already had. i handed it back. "no," she
forced, "fan your face with it."

the heat: another detail. all night you can watch pink bodies press
against the grills of industrial fans without considering your own
meltdown. thirst, i must have traded that sensation for a
hyper-sensitivity to bass reverberations. on the girl's tip i pushed
forward to the water counter alongside other red-faced kids who had
overheated in unventilated rooms. i chugged another bottle, popped the
fresh cap in my mouth and dropped a dollar in the tip jar for all the
human effort that crafted this sub-world, all the hands that wired
speakers, ran projectors, built massage tables and taped up prints of
optical illusions.

the free exchange of air: another detail. the beauty of breathing.
that we swap our atmosphere indiscriminately, that no null space
exists between us and, and, and, that's it: the connectedness of all
things. imagine how faces would blur into a common form if you thumbed
through a stack of polaroid headshots. i had a vision of my own image
fusing between and permeating throughout those layers, into that shaky
composite of eyebrows and nostrils. i headed for a dark corner to
crouch in and scribble a sloppy essay on my brilliant theories of
oneness--particles, man, particles--but on the way i remembered that i
was brainstorming with the same genius that inspired a lot of these
people to wear orange socks.

someone passed out another flyer. the words blurred, focused, blurred.
"we're not here to preach about how good it was 'back in the day,'"
the photocopied handwriting said. "we're not trying to bring back the
'old' vibe. it's time to appreciate all that we have right here in our
scene, make ourselves better and move forward."

i sat on the floor, my back to a girl in a white plastic chair.
kneading my neck, she asked, "is your jaw sore? you must have a good
pill."

another girl's hands upturned mine to the neon-netted ceiling. "relax
them. no, relax them."

another detail: the ineffable sense of togetherness in this gauntlet
of loving limbs. she bent each finger, snapping the joints apart with
a deftness i envied.

i yelled in some guy's ear, "this is my first time."

"first time?" he said, pulling a bright beaded bracelet off his wrist.
he slipped it over mine. "here."

I haven't heard them myself, and generally am not really down with much
newer Alesis stuff, but I've read many good reviews about those

scored consistantly high.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] RE: 5/6 doublethinnk - thanx Modified!

I have to agree with chris on this issue. As being a past promoter/DJ/Party 
bank roller etc..

It is more a "Privilege" to get into a party for free. alot of times guys 
like to "Front" and say look at me getting into all these parties for free 
im a "Somebody" etc.. I had the courtesey of calling promoters in advanced 
and asking to get on a list. If they said they could not because of budget 
etc.. I would gladly pay, cause anyone that has been on the receiving end of 
doing an event knows how pricey it can be when you have your balls on the 
line. And yes partys are very stressful most promoters know this. I for one 
sure do.

So moral to my rant. Call promoter in advance so you don't get your feelings 
hurt at the door. Be willing to pay if the promoter needs the $$

But I have say it does suck having to pay 10-15 bucks per party if you have 
10 you need to hit up that night. So advice follow rule number 1. 
hehehehe...

just my thoughts,

Macadio

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE: 5/6 doublethinnk - thanx Modified!

I don't usually post on here...but i can't even believe that someone woudl 
complain about not getting into an event for free to flyer when the venue 
allowed no flyers.  And personally, i would give attitude if someone asked 
more than once.  But thats just me.

In my opinion, promoters in general need to calm down and get off their high 
horses.  Throwing a party does not automatically allow you to be admitted 
into every event for free.

That being said...the party was amazing, the bathroom situation was a breath 
of fresh air (metaphorically) cause there was never a wait.  The sound and 
talent amazing, the crowd....well lets say the rave trash was filtered out.

Being one of the people that happened to be there, I have to say I
couldn't possibly agree with you any more Joey. I think what people
fail to realize is that we are upset about the lack of respect that
Element showed us. And I'm not saying respect because we were
promoting, but respect as people. For me at least I show every
promoter that I'm on good terms with such a level of respect the cant
help but show it in return. When that respect is not returned I feel
sort of slapped in the face. But beyond that Element came off as quite
the jerk. I have worked with him on two separate shows in the past.
Both times I treated him with the utmost respect, so I hope in the
future it gets returned.

Like Joe said it's water under the bridge, no hard feelings. We are
all adults here so there is no need to beat a dead horse.

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the 
world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those 
years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a 
world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite 
and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination 
practiced in past centuries ..."
- David Rockefeller, Bilderberg club permanent member, 1991

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Does that include the revenue from selling the videos
from the "hidden" camera over the toilet in the
bathroom?

I like the End Up but that always struck me as a bit
over the top.

i'll be really surprised if i can actually get this message out to you all
today.  my web hosting company decided to "upgrade" my webmail software.  horde
is great if you have a DSL line or T1 connection, but it's the pits when your

I don't know what to say to that.

The mental image of crackheads running around the streets with swords
and silk uniforms is kinda scary.

First kiss indeed.  That's a good analogy.  But this
bit worried me:

"i pushed forward to the water counter alongside other
red-faced kids who had overheated in unventilated
rooms."

Ventilation is your friend.  Stay cool, drink water.  

Promoters need to think more about temperature in
selcting venues IMO.

Peace,

peter

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the 
world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those 
years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a 
world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite 
and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination 
practiced in past centuries ..."
- David Rockefeller, Bilderberg club permanent member, 1991

LOL.  The only videos I ever saw were from the old Townsend venue.  Lots of 
serendipitous action in those stalls.

Every "world class" city needs some venues that are "over the top," or the

Hey, I've been voluntold by one of my business associates to start
looking for talent for Earth Dance 2005 out here in Arizona.

I've got my personal list of DJs I'd like to see out here. Who would
you all recommend as a trance and DnB headliner to represent the 415

You are not allowed to camp on the beaches in santa cruz county but there
are some nearby state parks along the beaches that have campgrounds.
Look up New Brighton or Manresa State Beaches on Google

"also the ambient mafia"

looks like boomerang AND fidget will be there!  fuck yeah. it just 
ain't the mafia if they're not both in attendance.


<cue harp arpeggio flashback music>

i'll never get over the time i had these two super-cute girls come up 
to me at a party and go "we just LOVE the music you play.  we heard you 
last week at the party at Cyborganic."

at this point, i'm thinking i'm pretty hot shit, and remembering my set 
from the previous weekend, which was better than usual - i'd only been 
spinning for a year...

then they drop the bomb: "and your name is SO cute! Boomerang Fidget!  
how did you come up with that?"

that bastard.

You didn't just make something up?  "I used to be on
the  school boomerang team when I lived down under..."

Once when I was at the Club Christine in Puerto
Vallarta this guy in the bathroom thought I was Danny
Tenaglia.  I think this isn't a compliment.

Peace,

Peter

Phillip and Matt,

I won't be making it to the fasion show because I'm playin' at Digga Beat.  
I'll be playin all new hardstyle with a bunch of white labels that none of 
y'all have heard before.  It's gonna be fat like albert with better hair.  
In anycase, I recommend Digga Beat, but if you find something more your 
style or choose to go to the fasion show, have a blast.

Cha cha cheers,
Joey Frisco

The Digga Beat 3 info is below (you can see the flyer and a bit more info 
here http://www.brproductions.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=18069&hl=digga

Toronto. In 2002 he hooked up with the Goodfellaz and has never looked back. 
E.N.D. has been riping up crowds not only as a DJ but as one of the top

artists perform. Welcome back two of the best dj's in the bay area trance 
scene! The return of Pistachio & Anonymous!

Subject: [sfraves] Oracle Gathering: Journey of the Shaman

Any SFRaves Community members planning on attending Oracle Gathering: 
Journey of the Shaman? (This is out of state = plan on a carpool?)

Journey of the Shaman
June 3rd-5th, 2005
Lake Bronson Family Nudist Park
Sultan, WA

  We invite you to join us on our next journey, a 3-day/2-night festival, 
in Sultan, Washington. Navigate your way no matter what your path. Enjoy 
the beautiful setting by setting up camp near a spring-fed lake and 
waterfall, green trees, and blue sky - Gaia! Dance by day or night, 
participate in educational/artistic workshops, and support community 
artisans. Find commonalities with others through the language of dance and 
music. Grow as a community as we explore the inner/outer realms using as a 
tool the concept of shamanism.

Do you have a family? Don't stay at home; bring everyone! This is a 
kid-friendly event, open to children of all ages.

Thanks for the map. Did you take a look at the Gallary Photos from 2004? 
Looks like there are plenty of presales tickets available and 
opportunities to volunteer and help out. http://www.earthdance.org/sf

thanks to my friend richard for forwarding this who is not on the list but
that's ok we don't want the whole world on the list anyway ... anyway ...
we used to terrorize the manager at SF computerware together.  it was
great!

They keep talking about drafting a Constitution for Iraq. Why don't
we just give them ours? It was written by a lot of really smart guys,
it's worked for over 200 years and we're not using it anymore.

Subject: [sfraves] help!

Alrighty, I hope this works. Good morning everyone. I'm trying to figure out 
how this whole mailing list thingy works, plus i'm a little inept w/ comps 
so it's a tad challenging. Anyway, I just joined, and am hoping some kind 
person out there might be able to give me a heads up on what's been going on 
recently. I must admit, last event I attended was cyberfest 03 but then I 
got preggers and after that into the land of mommydom I went. Anyway, now 
that the little tyke is a bit biger I'm hoping to get back into the swing of 
things, so to speak.

-sincerely
   very confused   ;)

One of the most well known and respected house events
has been The Velvet Shop created by Mark Johns and M3.
To date, The Velvet Shop has been the most successful
underground platform of the South Bay. Over the past

Subject: [sfraves] DJ RypTide

I've got a friend coming to visit in July (21st-24th) who is a kick-ass  
psytrance DJ. Does anyone know of anything going on that weekend where  
they might be looking to book a psytrance DJ?

His latest mix is up here:

http://www.ryptide.com/music/mixed/RypTide_-_Vernacular_-_02202005.mp3

And he's got a track list and another mix here:

And while you're at it, book me too. :-)

Subject: [sfraves] New draconian drug war bill in congress

A new bill with extremely stiff mandatory drug sentencing is being
proposed in the House. I encourage you to call your local rep or just
send an email by going to
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=26179&ms=Sensen0505-aa

Info from the Drug Policy Action Network's site.

_________________
H.R. 1528, Defending America's Most Vulnerable: Safe Access to Drug
Treatment and Child Protection Act of 2005, is one of the worse drug
war bills that Congress has ever considered.

Among other things, HR 1528:

--Virtually eliminates the ability of federal judges to give sentences
below the minimum sentence recommended by federal sentencing
guidelines, essentially creating a mandatory minimum sentence for
every federal offense (including both drug and non-drug offenses).

--Expands the federal "three strikes and you're out" law to include
new offenses, including mandating life imprisonment (with no
possibility of parole) for anyone convicted a third time under the
RAVE Act.

--Mandates a 10-year minimum sentence for anyone 21 or older that
gives marijuana or others drugs to someone under 18 (i.e. a 21 year
old college students gives a joint to his 17-year old brother). A
second offense would be life in prison.

--Expands what is considered to be a "drug-free" school zone to
include almost any place in an urban area, and increases penalties for
selling or distributing drugs in that area. (The result will be
enhanced penalties for people in inner cities, while people in rural
and suburban areas get less time for the same offense).

--Mandates a 5-year minimum sentence for any person that commits a
drug trafficking offense near the presence of a person under 18 or in
a place where such person resides for any period of time. The sentence
is 10 years if they are parent. (I.e. a mother that sells her neighbor
a joint will get a 10-year minimum sentence, even if her kids were at
school at the time).

--Creates a new offense for persons who witness or learn about certain
drug offenses that fail to report the drug offender to the police
within 24 hours or fail to provide full assistance to the police in
tracking and prosecuting the offender. Offenses that would get someone
a 2-year minimum sentence, including failing to report a neighbor that
is storing or selling drugs when that neighbor has kids, failing to
report anyone that gives a joint to someone under the age of 21, and
failing to report a college student that is selling marijuana on a
college campus.

--Mandates a 5-year minimum sentence for any person that offers,
solicits, encourages, or induces a person enrolled in drug treatment,
or previously enrolled in drug treatment, to purchase, possess or
receive drugs.

The full text of H.R. 1528 can be viewed by going to
http://thomas.loc.gov/ , entering "HR1528" in the search box, checking
the "enter bill number" circle under the search box, and clicking
"search".

smoek. drink jack danielz be merikan. kekeke'

Notice repeated fed busts of bay area compassionate care spots.

This is patently unconstitutional- this is akin to forcing somebody to
give testimony.  Unfortunately, even if it wouldn't stand up in court,
it is a scare tactic that seems targeted to pit friends against
friends, neighbors against neighbors- and in today's climate of fear,
it just might work...

Fuckers.  I can't believe this shit.

Best thing to always do, regardless of what laws are,
or are not passed is to know your rights.  Empower
yourself and others so the Cops, Feds or whoever do
not trick or mislead you into giving more info than
required.  ALWAYS speak to an attorney before saying
anything to a cop/fed.  Always.

I've been so fed up with these types of laws...they
are beyond reason or logic.  The laws are only
devloped to make a politician look good to "moral"
(and I use the term loosly) voter.  Makes me want to
go into politics and say "ENOUGH".

A PROPOSAL FOR A SYSTEM TO REPLACE ORDINARY RECORD MERCHANDISING
- copyright 1983 by Frank Zappa -

Ordinary phonograph record merchandising as it exists today is a
stupid process which concerns itself essentially with pieces of
plastic, wrapped in pieces of cardboard.

These objects, in quantity, are heavy and expensive to ship.  The
manufacturing process is complicated and crude.  Quality control for
the stamping of the discs is an exercise in futility.  The system is
subject to pilferage (as, in some instances, pressing 'over-runs' have
been initiated, with the quantity pressed above the amount of the
legitimate order removed from the premises and sold on the black
market).

Dissatisfied customers routinely return records because they are
warped and will not play.

Large numbers of people are employed in the field of 'record
promotion' . . . these salaries are, for the most part, a waste of
money.

New digital technology may eventually solve the warpage problem and
provide the consumer with better quality sound in the form of Compact
Discs [C.D.'s].  They are smaller, contain more music, and would,
presumably cost less to ship . . . but, they are much more expensive
to buy and manufacture.  To reproduce them, the consumer needs to
purchase a digital device to replace his old hi-fi equipment (in the
$700 price range).

The bulk of the promotional effort at every record company today is
expended on "NEW MATERIAL" . . . the latest and the greatest of
whatever the cocaine-tweezed A&R Brass has decided to inflict on
everybody.  More often than not, these 'aesthetic decisions' result in
mountains of useless vinyl/cardboard artifacts which cannot be sold at
any price, and are therefore returned for disposal and recycling.
These mistakes are expensive.

Put aside momentarily the current method of operation and think what
is being wasted in terms of GREAT CATALOG ITEMS, squeezed out of the
market place because of limited rack space in retail outlets, and the
insatiable desire of quota-conscious company reps to fill every
available niche with THIS WEEK'S NEW RELEASES.

Every major record company has vaults full of (and perpetual rights
to) great recording by major artists in many categories which might
still provide enjoyment to music consumers if they were made available
in the right way.  MUSIC CONSUMERS LIKE TO CONSUME MUSIC . . . NOT
PIECES OF VINYL WRAPPED IN PIECES OF CARDBOARD.

It is our proposal to take advantage of the POSITIVE ASPECTS of a
NEGATIVE TREND afflicting the record industry today: HOME TAPING via
cassette of material released on vinyl.

First of all, we must realize that the taping of albums is not
motivated by 'stinginess' alone . . . if a consumer makes a home tape
from a disc, that copy will probably sound better than a commercially
manufactured high-speed dupe cassette, legitimately released by the
company.

People today enjoy music more than ever before, and, they like to take
it with them wherever they go.  THEY CAN HEAR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
GOOD AUDIO AND BAD AUDIO . . . THEY CARE ABOUT THAT DIFFERENCE, AND
THEY ARE WILLING TO GO TO SOME TROUBLE AND EXPENSE TO HAVE HIGH
QUALITY 'PORTABLE AUDIO' TO USE AS 'WALLPAPER FOR THEIR LIFESTYLE'.

THE ANSWERS TO PERPLEXING QUESTIONS

presenting: "Q.C.I."

We propose to acquire the rights to digitally duplicate and store THE
BEST of every record company's difficult-to-move Quality Catalog Items
[Q.C.I.], store them in a central processing location, and have them
accessible by phone or cable TV, directly patchable into the user's
home taping appliances, with the option of direct digital-to-digital
transfer to F-1 (SONY consumer level digital tape encoder), Beta
Hi-Fi, or ordinary analog cassette (requiring the installation of a
rentable D-A converter in the phone itself . . . the main chip is
about $12).

All accounting for royalty payments, billing to the customer, etc.
would be automatic, built into the initial software for the system.

The consumer has the option of subscribing to one or more Interest
Categories, charged at a monthly rate, without regard for the quantity
of music he or she decides to tape.

Providing material in such quantity at a reduced cost could actually
diminish the desire to duplicate and store it, since it would be
available any time day or night.

Monthly listings could be provided by catalog, reducing the on-line
storage requirements of the computer.  The entire service would be
accessed by phone, even if the local reception is via TV cable.

The advantage of the TV cable is: on those channels where nothing ever
seems to happen (there's about 70 of them in L.A.), a visualization of
the original cover art, including song lyrics, technical data, etc.,
could be displayed while the transmission is in progress, giving the
project an electronic whiff of the original point-of-purchase
merchandising built into the album when it was 'an album', since there
are many consumers who like to fondle & fetish the packaging while the
music is being played.  In this situation, Fondlement & Fetishism
Potential [F.F.P.] is supplied, without the cost of shipping tons of
cardboard around.

We require a LARGE quantity of money and the services of a team of
mega-hackers to write the software for this system.  Most of the
hardware devices are, even as you read this, available as
off-the-shelf items, just waiting to be plugged into each other so
they can put an end to "THE RECORD BUSINESS" as we now know it.

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the 
world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those 
years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a 
world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite 
and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination 
practiced in past centuries ..."
- David Rockefeller, Bilderberg club permanent member, 1991

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the 
world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those 
years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a 
world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite 
and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination 
practiced in past centuries ..."
- David Rockefeller, Bilderberg club permanent member, 1991

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] Mix reviews (sorta)

Ok - so after my last request, some folks were kind enough to send me some 
mix cd's. The least I can do is attempt to review 'em...

1. Mojo Jones - Acid Rock: I posted a link to this yesterday actually, if 
you slept on it, you're a lamer and a half. This mix is pure fucking acidy 
yumminess. Mainly 4x4, but with enough breaks thrown in to make me pop wood 
like whoa. This mix is the epitome of dance music, and quite honestly the 
best mix I've heard this year. Sound too good to be true? NO - so stop 
wondering if I'm full of shit or not and ask me for the link, lol.

2. Hyjinx - And then there were Breaks... : Ok - so he didn't send me the 
cd, I nabbed it when I spun before him the other night at the Modified party 
that everyone was crying about (which was fun godammit). The mixing isn't 
always perfect, but the slips are never too obnoxious, and the energy, track 
selection, and arrangement more than make up for any loose mixing. The kid 
is on point live, so this is at least a good representation of what he can 
do...

3. DJ Pistachio - ???: I missed a cd title - sue me! This is a pretty 
rockin' house mix. It leans towards the progressive side of things without 
ever getting droll or too "Ministry Of Sound". It's prog house on the more 
housey tip. Good arrangement, great tracks, fun mix overall. Made me bump in 
my car seat, so you know it wasn't bad.

4. Chuck G - ???: So I forgot the name of this mix too, I blame the herbalz. 
Well ,I probably shoulda warned Chuck that I'm NOT a huge fan of what I call 
"Bad Boy Bill" house. Disco house, Chicago Hard House, whatever the kids are 
calling it these days - I typically don't like it. That being said, this mix 
wasn't all that bad. Nothing I'd rock continuously, but it had a decent 
flavor for what it was. The mixing sounded pretty decent to me. I can't say 
that I gave it the closest listen - but it got played all the way through 
without being taken out and crushed, so it wasn't too shabby!

So - thanks for all the mixes thus far folks - SEND ME MORE!!!!!

On a similar note - I found an old mix of mine from like 2 years ago that 
for some reason I never released. It's actually pretty rockin', so be on the 
lookout for that sometime soon (when I stop being lazy and find someone to 
host it on their site, lol).

ez.

That's not all, he also anticipated the Age of Scrutiny we live in today,=

This is from the opening of Joe's Garage, 1979:

There's more, but I'm sure you get the picture.

Hey Everybody,

What's up?  Just wanted to inform ppl...there's a new weekly Progressive
House / Trance event in SF called "Crush".  It happens every Wednesday
night at Underground SF, 9am till 2am.  There's no cover, they have a
great sound system, and the DJs are pretty good.  I went there last week
and had a blast.  You guys should check it out!  Here's the flyer someone
sent me:

I have my latest mix up on the jcthedj.com site (I had thought I already
had it set up in January and was telling people, but it turns out I
hadn't. :) )  There still are older ones there too.  A lower bitrate
version of the latest one is also available at waxdj.com here:
http://waxdj.com/play.php?band_id=45&song_id=235&mode=song_hifi

If you want a CD copy, drop me a line.

Zappa is one of my few heros, and was one of the last true musical and 
cultural geniuses (IMHO).

I'm not surprised he "predicted" any of this shit. The mofo was in tune with 
life on the whole. Read his autobiography sometime....pure genius.

R.I.P. FRANK ZAPPA!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] monday mornings are laaaazzzzyyyyy

I got real high and watched my friend buy super expensive gear. I have 
learned that Ultrasone headphones are the absolute shit. Um...other than 
that, my weekend was nice and quiet. With all the parties that are popping 
up, I needed a restful weekend to start storing energy for what's ahead...

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Mon)

what is life like when you've got 10,000 windows open, a couple of them
work related, one of them sort of permanently attached to your webmail,
one of them fine tuning your amazon wish list, back to webmail, check your
wells fargo real quick, add some stuff up, maybe do a little CD shopping
while you're at it?

would that be a description of me, or a description of about 3/4 of the
list, slowly widdling a little bit of their life away to some company, 8
or 10 hours at a time?

remember, your skills are on your side.  time is not.  use them both
wisely and to your advantage!

But at my back I always hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: SQUISH!

I was doing a search on "tomato worms" and this is what came up...I had no 
idea this was even a part of life for some....
life gets better and better...
Danny P

I guess

by G.A. Pearson
Department of Entomology, Box 7626
North Carolina State University
Raleigh, NC 27695-7626.


For the past two years, I've been working on a project documenting insect 
tatoos, scarification, and other forms of body art involving insects 
(Pearson 1995). In the course of this investigation, I've met some highly 
interesting people not usually encountered on the average State University 
campus. Somehow, through a strange series of events that probably don't bear 
any further examination, I came in contact with Jeff Vilencia, publisher of 
The American Journal of The Crush Freaks. Vilencia describes the crush 
fetish as a variant of giantessophilism:

"The feeling is that of letting go, powerless, helpless, tiny, small, and 
buglike. Wanting to see a female crush something with her foot, longing to 
be a helpless insect as you squirm around under her foot sole as she 
squishes your body into grease."
Insects become a fetish object for the crush freak, who wishes to be an 
insect ground underfoot. Witnessing or imagining the act of a woman crushing 
an insect is sexually arousing. The bigger the foot the better; shoe size 9 
and up are preferred. (My puny size 6 feet made me feel safe enough to 
discuss his obsession with Vilencia.)

The AJCF has 500 subscribers, mostly in America but also a few from around 
the world. Inside is Vilencia's collection of letters from fellow crush 
fetishists, book reviews, and miscellaneous crush erotica. Two other 
magazines cater to crush freaks: Squish! and In Step, a foot fetish 
magazine.

There is a flourishing industry in underground videotapes, some of which are 
highly produced numbers that have been exhibited at film festivals. A 
casting call for one of Vilencia's "crush" films is reproduced in Figure 1. 
Amazingly, Vilencia seems to have been inundated by hopeful actresses 
willing to trample for film fame, some of whom even bought their own bugs 
and snails to the audition. The films themselves are enough to make an 
entomologist weep:


"Squish Playhouse #3: Starring Debbie The Crush Queen And Co-Starring Dozens 
of Crickets and Mealworms."

"Squish Playhouse #5: Featuring a Special Guest Victim -- A Tarantula 
Spider!!!"
The other victims in Playhouse #5 are live pinkies (baby mice). Well, were 
live pinkies.

Vilencia sent me a copy of his award winning video "Smush!" and I watched it 
with a few entomological friends. It didn't do much for us besides gross us 
out. That is also the reaction of the actress in the film, as she mashes 
earthworms to death, first in bare feet and then in black pumps, grinning 
maniacally. "Eewwww, I'm stepping on yewwwww..." she squeals in an 
artificially-engineered baby-doll voice. The disgust of the stomper 
heightens the excitement of the crush freak, according to Vilencia. Crush 
freaks watch the film and -- I have to say it -- mastur-bait. The film won 
an award at the Toronto Film Festival, where a few animal rights activists 
wanted to know "When does cruelty to earthworms become art?"

Audio tapes are also offered. One entitled "A Housewife's Guide to Squishing 
Bugs" has the following blurb:


"Spiders, Ants, Silverfish ,Cockroaches, Snails, Slugs, and Fat Tomato Worms 
are no match for this angry housewife with her sexy size 10 feet! Follow her 
from kitchen to garden as she steps on her victims with no mercy! You will 
want to be the next insect under her foot!"
A "crush mistress," Ms. J, is a professional dominatrix, making specialized 
videos and tapes for different clients. In an interview in the AJCF she 
says:


"50% of the people who write to me are into the "Crush" fetish. But of the 
people who have maintained an ongoing relationship with me, probably only 
15%. (are actually crush freaks)"
When asked if she feels any remorse squishing the bugs, she laughs and says:


"None, none! There's no remorse 'cause they're little bugs, I mean, what is 
their use?" ... I mean, I can appreciate life being sacred, but bugs have no 
minds you know, and no feelings..."
Interviewer: Is there anything you won't step on?
"As far as bugs go, I do not step on the little spindly-legged spiders, 
cause they're my friends. But when it comes to bugs, I mean they're just 
icky little creatures si I can't think why they shouldn't be stepped on!"
Another woman named Kathy in Utah offers audio and videotapes to crush 
freaks. One called "Teacher's Pet" is described as:


"A tall stiletto-heeled teacher keeps two students after school for bringing 
their pet beetle to class. To teach them a lesson, she steps on the beetle 
and crushes it right in front of them..."
This particular tape echoes Vilencia's theory of how crush fetishism 
develops:


"When it comes to the crush, several things come to mind... including the 
Oedipus complex, because certainly we have seen our mothers kill insects and 
other people kill insects, and I think that the gigantess imagery that seems 
to be predominant in more people than one would imagine, also come from 
childhood. Somewhere there was a sexual connection from seeing all the women 
in heels and hose while very small ourselves..."
Some of the books reviewed by the AJCF are rather surprising: Kafka's 
Metamorphosis is to be expected, but the rest of the reviews were general 
interest entomology books. Bug Busters (1991) and Bugs, Slugs, and Other 
Things (1991) were reviewed, complete with page numbers to bug crushing 
references. Vilencia has also edited and republished foot-fetish excerpts of 
R. Von Ebbling's Psychopathia Sexualis, an 1886 treatise.

Clearly, I just don't get the whole crush predilection. However, there seems 
to be very few crush freaks, so I don't think the invertebrate world is in 
great danger. Crush fetishists represent a fascinating example of the human 
ability to eroticize just about any activity: in this case, one of interest 
to entomologists.

The next time you stomp a bug, better look around -- Jeff and his friends 
might be watching:


"I think its completely harmless, because it's a fantasy and we can't really 
experience this (being crushed underfoot). We can do it only in our minds 
and I think it's probably one of the more safer things. As far as people who 
are into crushing insects or seeing it done, I don't see anything more wrong 
with that than going into a supermarket and going into the Raid section, 
because human beings hate insects."

Acknowledgements

I thank Jeff Vilencia, editor of The American Journal of The Crush Freaks 
for his free sharing of materials on the crush fetish and fascinating 
conversations. My use of the term "crush freak" is mot meant to disparage; 
it is used by fetishists as a self-description.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: SQUISH!

Lovely- I remember a couple years ago I saw a brief clip of some  
attractive girl stepping on crabs in a pan- and I thought "WTF is this?   
Are people really in to this?  *Why* was this video made?"
I couldn't tell if it had any sexual connotation to it or if it was just  
some random video, but apparently it's the former.
I suspect that in addition to the gigantism hook, it also triggers the  
same things as the girls-stepping/sitting-on-balloons thing...

God bless the Internet (TM)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sunset....

Was there with my wife, two youngest kids, two
strollers, and my daughter.  We had a great time! 
Bennet loved the hula hoops.  We will be back for the
next SF sunset for sure and maybe even Marin depending
on the complexities...  

Someone took a picture of my son (he's 2) dancing with
a girl in a furry pink outfit.  If anyone out there is
the photographer (I think you were wearing a blue and
white striped shirt) I'd sure like to get a copy of
the the shot.  This capped of a great day for him as
he had already gotten his first phone number from a
girl that morning at Starbucks.

And hi to Brandon (not the same one from this list I'm
guessing though) who was digging on my family.  

Peace,

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] WR: Friday night: 1015

So it was Dope... like OK... 1st off.. it wasn't like totally packed
house, but there were hella people there..

Music was Sick.... I mean.. the VIP Lounge was Jungle the whole night,
hosted by Groundscore, Nice Nice Nice.... I Loved all the sets,, they wre
Dope... All the MCs, MC Duh, Lindzee, Colonel, but on 4 real though, the
set that did it 4 me was Qzen... I mean.. she spun my fave kinda Jungle &
it was like the hard dubby shit.,.... I Loved it!!

Andy Weatherall was Sick.. I remember he closed out the main room... like
I do remember he spun alota old school breaks.. like musically i mean....
those records coulda came like last year.. LoL... but it was Dope.... I
left the Jungle room a few times 'cuase oooh.. i couldn't get enough of it
man... Danced so hard on the floor!

The same thing w/ Keith Tennis Wood.. Like i remember being in the smoking
alley like havin' a cig & looking @ the dance floor then this song came
on.. lke this almost proggy beat that was just so yummy!!!  I ran through
2 other rooms & 3 stair ways 2 get down there.. ooh my gosh... I was
dangin s hard.. YUM!!!

I met them later after the main rom closed down & we were like hangin' out
w/ the promoters & stuff.. LoL.. OK.. so like in 20 minutes, Andrew
Weatherhall like explained to me the evolution of Elecronic Music circa
1988 - Present while incorporating the origins of the rave scene, the
clubs the did them in, the people involved, & the drugs people did.. LoL..
it was a Dope conversatoin... LoL.. he even said that I was on his
Guestlist like whenever i end up in London & it's a Sat Night... LMAO....
How funny!!!

Diplo went on in the front room @ around 3AM I guess.. he was late & I
didn't know he was there... so i kinda missed his set... but in the front
room.. there was this Dj who played 80s muzic & missed it w/ house...  it
was Sick.. Aha & Pat Benitar!!  eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehyayaya!!!

It was just a really fun time man... I danced sooooooo much that night.. i
swear i lost 10 pounds!

Oh yeah.. it was also CooL.. there was an art installation thingie @ teh
club was pretty Dope.. like there was this toilet paper thing in the VIP
room, along w/ a TV video thingie of a nipple & a mouth.. then there was
porn...I called the basement like the inside of the body 'cause there was
like red blod cell shapes hangin' from the ceiling...

It was a very Groovy Night!  Wish i saw more of U there =)  Next time!

Subject: [sfraves] Weekend in Review....FnF, Sunset, Cocomo

yo.
so saturday night was filled with work at the jazz joint, came back to the 
house to pick up my good buddy Jessee and housemade bud Mindy (hi babe) and 
headed over to FnF.  I was nervous about how loud ethe music was outside but 
also very excited  ;)
Showed up durring the end of Micron's set (you go Gurl)  Mad respect to Dom 
who made me want to...well, um....
anyways, the music was great, I only had a little time to play around before 
working the door shift.  Sorry if I was totally annoying with checking 
stamps...I would have much rather made out with everyone there...trust me. 
AndyW, thanks for the "meanguy lessons" and for being you.  It was great 
re-introducing myself to sooo many people I have met before sooo many times.
The lighting was amazing!!!
The vibe was off the hook!
Very diverse crowd, but everyone was super chill and lovely...so many old 
friends I have not seen in a while...
I love you all  :)
Thanks Phillip for coming out too, that was a lovely morning surprise...Oh, 
and who ever drank the last of my whiskey...you owe me ;)
Glad to be a part of FnF  always...
  soooo, we get home around 9:30isham sleep for an hour, friends showed up 
and woke us all and we headed out to Sunset.
There  was one guy on the dancefloor when we arrived, got rockstar parking 
and got to watch my friends lil boy (3 yrs old) do some breakdancing...was 
awesome Love ya Tai!
It was great being there so early and just seeing the place fill 
up..glorious, wonderful house as always, damn I was tired.  but could not 
stop shaking my ass.  BAM and I are going to start a company, if anyone is 
interested in 'Assjam' drop me a line, or you can ask him for details which 
I am sure he would love.  I was the guy  with the  shirt that said "Trust 
me, I am a doctor" with squished strawberries all over my ass...don't ask...
Great to see quite a few peeps from FnF out there, Erik Giling, thanks for 
the wine :)
Bam, my "horsie lips" are only for you baby Eesiad, very lovely to meet you 
darlin...

around 6:30, we headed to Cocomo for the benefit...
Music music music, loved the outside area much better than inside  and they 
closed it down much earlier than I expected.  EllenFerrato rocked it, Much 
respect to all the peeps who helped organize this amazing line up of dj's, I 
was thoroughly impressed.
4th wind came with shots of tequila (thank god!)  I was able to 
maintain...then all my good ol' pal's from Teatro Zinzanni showed up and fed 
me more booze...
all of a sudden I can't remember much more...all I know is that we all live 
in a very special place and I hope no one takes it for granted.  The 
community in SF is amazing...I am very greatful of all of yuz..."and I am 
not just saying that because of the drugs"  didn't do any, yay!
I saw some, then I stepped on them, because they tried attacking my 
feet...that didn't do shit, they just got pissed and busted out the 
accordian and playing "its a small world after all"
so I went home and finally got some rest.
lots of wondeful memories to dwell on...I had better do it quick cause they 
only last about a day or two  ;)

Be well everyone...
Danny

>>probably don't bear any further examination, I came in contact with  Jeff 
>>Vilencia, publisher of The American Journal of The Crush Freaks.  Vilencia 
>>describes the crush fetish as a variant of giantessophilism:
>>
>>"The feeling is that of letting go, powerless, helpless, tiny, small,  and 
>>buglike. Wanting to see a female crush something with her foot,  longing 
>>to be a helpless insect as you squirm around under her foot sole  as she 
>>squishes your body into grease."
>>Insects become a fetish object for the crush freak, who wishes to be an  
>>insect ground underfoot. Witnessing or imagining the act of a woman  
>>crushing an insect is sexually arousing. The bigger the foot the better;  
>>shoe size 9 and up are preferred. (My puny size 6 feet made me feel safe  
>>enough to discuss his obsession with Vilencia.)
>>
>>The AJCF has 500 subscribers, mostly in America but also a few from  
>>around the world. Inside is Vilencia's collection of letters from fellow  
>>crush fetishists, book reviews, and miscellaneous crush erotica. Two  
>>other magazines cater to crush freaks: Squish! and In Step, a foot  fetish 
>>magazine.
>>
>>There is a flourishing industry in underground videotapes, some of which  
>>are highly produced numbers that have been exhibited at film festivals.  A 
>>casting call for one of Vilencia's "crush" films is reproduced in  Figure 
>>1. Amazingly, Vilencia seems to have been inundated by hopeful  actresses 
>>willing to trample for film fame, some of whom even bought  their own bugs 
>>and snails to the audition. The films themselves are  enough to make an 
>>entomologist weep:
>>
>>
>>"Squish Playhouse #3: Starring Debbie The Crush Queen And Co-Starring  
>>Dozens of Crickets and Mealworms."
>>
>>"Squish Playhouse #5: Featuring a Special Guest Victim -- A Tarantula  
>>Spider!!!"
>>The other victims in Playhouse #5 are live pinkies (baby mice). Well,  
>>were live pinkies.
>>
>>Vilencia sent me a copy of his award winning video "Smush!" and I  watched 
>>it with a few entomological friends. It didn't do much for us  besides 
>>gross us out. That is also the reaction of the actress in the  film, as 
>>she mashes earthworms to death, first in bare feet and then in  black 
>>pumps, grinning maniacally. "Eewwww, I'm stepping on yewwwww..."  she 
>>squeals in an artificially-engineered baby-doll voice. The disgust  of the 
>>stomper heightens the excitement of the crush freak, according to  
>>Vilencia. Crush freaks watch the film and -- I have to say it --  
>>mastur-bait. The film won an award at the Toronto Film Festival, where a  
>>few animal rights activists wanted to know "When does cruelty to  
>>earthworms become art?"
>>
>>Audio tapes are also offered. One entitled "A Housewife's Guide to  
>>Squishing Bugs" has the following blurb:
>>
>>
>>"Spiders, Ants, Silverfish ,Cockroaches, Snails, Slugs, and Fat Tomato  
>>Worms are no match for this angry housewife with her sexy size 10 feet!  
>>Follow her from kitchen to garden as she steps on her victims with no  
>>mercy! You will want to be the next insect under her foot!"
>>A "crush mistress," Ms. J, is a professional dominatrix, making  
>>specialized videos and tapes for different clients. In an interview in  
>>the AJCF she says:
>>
>>
>>"50% of the people who write to me are into the "Crush" fetish. But of  
>>the people who have maintained an ongoing relationship with me, probably  
>>only 15%. (are actually crush freaks)"
>>When asked if she feels any remorse squishing the bugs, she laughs and  
>>says:
>>
>>
>>"None, none! There's no remorse 'cause they're little bugs, I mean, what  
>>is their use?" ... I mean, I can appreciate life being sacred, but bugs  
>>have no minds you know, and no feelings..."
>>Interviewer: Is there anything you won't step on?
>>"As far as bugs go, I do not step on the little spindly-legged spiders,  
>>cause they're my friends. But when it comes to bugs, I mean they're just  
>>icky little creatures si I can't think why they shouldn't be stepped on!"
>>Another woman named Kathy in Utah offers audio and videotapes to crush  
>>freaks. One called "Teacher's Pet" is described as:
>>
>>
>>"A tall stiletto-heeled teacher keeps two students after school for  
>>bringing their pet beetle to class. To teach them a lesson, she steps on  
>>the beetle and crushes it right in front of them..."
>>This particular tape echoes Vilencia's theory of how crush fetishism  
>>develops:
>>
>>
>>"When it comes to the crush, several things come to mind... including  the 
>>Oedipus complex, because certainly we have seen our mothers kill  insects 
>>and other people kill insects, and I think that the gigantess  imagery 
>>that seems to be predominant in more people than one would  imagine, also 
>>come from childhood. Somewhere there was a sexual  connection from seeing 
>>all the women in heels and hose while very small  ourselves..."
>>Some of the books reviewed by the AJCF are rather surprising: Kafka's  
>>Metamorphosis is to be expected, but the rest of the reviews were  general 
>>interest entomology books. Bug Busters (1991) and Bugs, Slugs,  and Other 
>>Things (1991) were reviewed, complete with page numbers to bug  crushing 
>>references. Vilencia has also edited and republished  foot-fetish excerpts 
>>of R. Von Ebbling's Psychopathia Sexualis, an 1886  treatise.
>>
>>Clearly, I just don't get the whole crush predilection. However, there  
>>seems to be very few crush freaks, so I don't think the invertebrate  
>>world is in great danger. Crush fetishists represent a fascinating  
>>example of the human ability to eroticize just about any activity: in  
>>this case, one of interest to entomologists.
>>
>>The next time you stomp a bug, better look around -- Jeff and his  friends

>>
>>
>>"I think its completely harmless, because it's a fantasy and we can't  
>>really experience this (being crushed underfoot). We can do it only in  
>>our minds and I think it's probably one of the more safer things. As far  
>>as people who are into crushing insects or seeing it done, I don't see  
>>anything more wrong with that than going into a supermarket and going  
>>into the Raid section, because human beings hate insects."

There were actually quite a lot of families there. 
That's always nice to see.  And I was NOT the oldest

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: martial arts performance this friday

ok, so this is not rave related.  but my school is doing a large
martial arts performance this friday night at Stanford University.=20
all the info is below.

in addition to our students and my coaches performing some kick ass
wushu and taiji and running around with swords and flying across the
stage...we have a few special guests.

one is Tu Chin-Sheng who practices iron crotch qigong (no joke).  he
is rumored to be able to pull a car with his penis.  no, i'm not
joking.  google his name.

the other is Chiu Chi Ling, a hung ga kungfu master who many of you
will know as "the tailor" in the recent movie, "Kungfu Hustle" with
Stephen Chow.

to get an idea of what wushu is like, here's a little ditty i put
together last year:
7mb version - http://www.jiayo.com/downloads/jiayo_lo.mov
20mb version - http://www.jiayo.com/downloads/jiayo_hi.mov

Tickets are $20 for adults, $10 for kids and Stanford students.

The flyer:

Night of Wushu -- a Chinese Martial Arts benefit with all profits

You ever see "Spiritual Boxing?"  It's about hard Qi Gong.  They play it on 
the wall at butter sometimes.  In anycase, you oughtta check it out; I can 
get you a copy if you haven't seen it.

Tonite~The Mayo Grande Finale~Skylark

It is so very bittersweet....

Fours years of troubleshooting sound, backstage nightcaps, wednesday 
morning illin, birthdays, crying in our beers, scandalous flyers, chonky's 
emails, making out in the backroom, crackheads, pancho villa, late night 
visits to cable car pizza, shitty mixers, friends, smiles, laughs, bitchin 
bartenders, and hell...we've even had a few couples have their very first 
dates at skylark (lest you doubt our romantic side) ~and that's just the 
stuff I CAN REMEMBER....

goddamn this party sucked/was the coolest. It makes my heart heavy to 
think that I will be watching Family Feud Reruns on Tuesdays nights from 
now on-but alas-we are pulling the plug while we're still cool-or 
well-that's what we're telling ourselves ;-) Major major props to Chonky T 
for all his freakin hysterical emails, Greg the bartender-who if he didn't 
leave, I may have not have survived another year of Tuesdays, Chad our 
original barmaid, J-fi for coming back and saving me from all the 
testosterone, Tonic, for stepping in and stepping up to alleviate some of 
my psychoness from Chonky, and Matt for being our latest and greatest 
resident. And all you guys-thanks for being great friends. we will be back 
you can count on it.

I think I saw that movie playing once at Butter -- while Bam was 
playing. Never mind having fun after that, it was all about WTF ARE THEY 
DOING IN THIS MOVIE -- all conversation and dancing stopped. Might as 
well just owned the damn thing and watched it at my house. If its the 
same one, its an amazing piece of film.

Court Rules Woman Not Liable in Sex Suit
- By MICHAEL KUNZELMAN, Associated Press Writer
Tuesday, May 17, 2005

(05-17) 15:21 PDT BOSTON, (AP) --

A woman isn't legally responsible for injuries her boyfriend suffered
while they were having consensual sex more than a decade ago, a state
appeals court ruled Monday.

The man, identified only as John Doe in court papers, filed suit
against the woman in 1997, claiming she was negligent when she
suddenly changed positions, landed awkwardly on him and fractured his
penis.

The man underwent emergency surgery in September 1994, "endured a
painful and lengthy recovery" and has suffered from sexual dysfunction
that hasn't responded to medication or counseling, the appeals court
said.

Although the woman may have exposed her boyfriend to "some risk of
harm," the three-judge panel said her conduct during the sexual
encounter wasn't "wanton or reckless" and can't support a lawsuit.

The man's lawsuit already has been thrown out by judges in Salem
District Court and Essex Superior Court.

The appeals court upheld those rulings while noting that its ruling
doesn't apply to cases where someone has negligently infected a
partner with a sexually transmitted disease.

"There are no comprehensive legal rules to regulate consensual sexual
behavior," Justice Joseph Trainor wrote. "In the absence of a
consensus of community values or customs defining normal consensual
conduct, a jury or judge cannot be expected to resolve a claim that
certain consensual sexual conduct is undertaken without reasonable
care."

The man's attorney, John Greenwood, said he is likely to appeal
Monday's ruling to the state's highest court.

"It's a case that hasn't been seen before in Massachusetts," he said.

Greenwood argued that consensual sex doesn't mean "anything goes. ...
The fact that some behavior was agreed to by the parties doesn't mean
all behavior was agreed to by the parties."

The woman's attorney didn't immediately return a telephone call Monday.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Tue)

i ponder posting something profound yet i also dare to tempt fate.  ever
do that?  reading these investing books can make you depressed.  if only i
balanced my checkbook perfectly when i was 20.  when, oh, when is time not
on my side?

then, i say, forget it.  i'm the self-appointed quote of the day guy, the
washed up dj who learned how to write on an internet mailing list laughing
about "coke vs. pepsi" threads (how bout a dr. pepper, young paddywan?)
enough!  i'm going to invent my own quote for once!

and i invite you do the same.  just send it to me privately, and whether i
like it or not i'll post it to the list on one of my quotes.  nothing
derogatory against michael the red stickman (well, try to be nice),
please.

if time is not on your side, just make more!

When does the music start and when does it end?  I'm interested in dropping 
by with a friend if the timing is right.

Subject: [sfraves] BOOYAH!

AMERICANS ARE WIMPS!!!

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1616578_1,00.html

"I have met Saddam Hussein exactly the same number of times as Donald
Rumsfeld met him. The difference is Donald Rumsfeld met him to sell
him guns and to give him maps the better to target those guns. I met
him to try and bring about an end to sanctions, suffering and war, and
on the second of the two occasions, I met him to try and persuade him
to let Dr Hans Blix and the United Nations weapons inspectors back
into the country - a rather better use of two meetings with Saddam
Hussein than your own Secretary of State for Defence made of his.

I was an opponent of Saddam Hussein when British and American
governments and businessmen were selling him guns and gas. I used to
demonstrate outside the Iraqi embassy when British and American
officials were going in and doing commerce."

WATCH THIS SHIT ON CNN AND SEE THOSE PUSSY-ASS SCUMBAG CRIMINALS IN
WASHINGTON GET THEIR ASSES REAMED!!!!

I have NEVER been prouder to be British.

Americans are wimps, I'm sorry folks, I'm American too, but I'm less
American than most of you, and I'm damn lucky to be so, because
Americans are WIMPS. You get owned by the corporations every fucking
day and you never do a damn thing to stop it. You never do a damn
thing but wring your fucking hands and whine. Your Democratic Party is
a joke, the whole point is to divert attention and make it seem as if
you're putting up a fight.

THIS is how politics is done. Somebody slings a lie at you, you call
him on his bullshit.

It's that simple.

BOOYAH!!!

You gotta watch this shit on CNN. Anybody who's ever felt any anger
against the US government, tune in to CNN and check out the look on
this British man's face, listen to the tone of this British man's
voice, and let a real man show you how easy it is to make criminal
Washington sleazebags look like the worthless, piddling scum that they
are.

Best thing I've read in a long time, I wish I had the
ability to speak as compelling as that man.  My
kingdom to have heard that in person.  Unfortunately,
thats also the most patriotic thing I've read in a
while.  Most people are terrified to appear
"un-American"....that was as American as you get. 
Damn.

Wow - 7.5 miles in 1.5 hours, congrats!

That *IS* a lot for one weekend after Great America :)

being confused is wonderful, it does not mean that your not THINKing, it
just means your thinking out side the box of your group mates.
you eventually  think on the same page as them  but what fun is that!

is rumored to be able to pull a car with his penis. no, i'm not
joking. google his name.

the other is Chiu Chi Ling, a hung ga kungfu master who many of you
will know as "the tailor" in the recent movie, "Kungfu Hustle" with
Stephen Chow.

to get an idea of what wushu is like, here's a little ditty i put
together last year:

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Bad Joke - don't mind my poor taste!

A little boy comes home from school and tells his father that his homework 
assignment is to find out the difference between "potentially" and 
"realistically". "Easy," says his father. "First, ask Mom if she'd sleep 
with the mailman for a million dollars." The boy runs off, then comes back 
and says, "She said yes." "Now go ask your sister the same question." 
advises the father. Again the boy runs off, and again he comes back and 
says, "She said yes." "So, potentially, we're sitting on two million 
dollars," replies the father. "But realistically, we're living with a pair 
of whores."

=)

Everyone who doesn't have one should bug Redstickman for a copy of his 
"Black Sunrise" cd.

DO EET!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BOOYAH!

see it on CNN, it's amazing. I don't know what you mean by patriotic
tho. maybe my outburst? kz the guy who actually said that stuff is
from the United Kingdom.

the whole "un-American" thing is just this horrible evil intimidation
tactic. it's really offensive, if you think about it. Bush slashed
veterans' benefits the year he invaded Afghanistan, but you know when
someone says "support the troops" they're not really talking about
supporting the troops at all. they could give a fuck about the troops.
I want a bumper sticker that says "Support the troops? Elect a
veteran, you fucking hypocrites."

--=====================_13221912==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed



This year, San Francisco will be the international host city for World
Environment Day (June 1st - June 5th). As the United Nation's official "Earth
Day," World Environment Day has been celebrated worldwide since 1972, but this
is the first time that a city in North America has served as host. San
Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom will be joined by more than 60 mayors from major
cities around the world to participate in five extraordinary days of events
focusing on green cities.

World Environment Day represents a unique opportunity to revitalize our
commitment to protecting our global environment, while learning about exciting
efforts taking place around the world in support of this goal.

NRDC has been actively involved in preparations for World Environment Day and
is organizing a series of special events for online activists like you. Come
hear cutting-edge discussions with NRDC staff and outside experts on some of
the greatest challenges facing the Bay area and cities around the world. 
Take a
tour of our state-of-the-environmental-art office in San Francisco to see the
technologies we now have in place to combat climate change and reduce 
pollution
and waste.

Below is the schedule of NRDC events. Space is extremely limited, so if you 
are
interested in attending any of the workshops or office tours listed, please
email Joyce Yeung at 
<http://by10fd.bay10.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin//cgi-bin/compose?curmbox=F000000001&a=57c11ec15dd4610b06975956e53ae8b0&mailto=1&to=biogemsinfo@nrdc.org&msg=MSG1116450128.4&start=4318530&len=4427&src=&type=x>biogemsinfo@nrdc.org 
no later than Monday, May 23rd.

with Walt Reid, the executive director of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the 
world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those 
years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a 
world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite 
and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination 
practiced in past centuries ..."
- David Rockefeller, Bilderberg club permanent member, 1991

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

Israeli MDMA/PTSD study begins approval process

Dr. Moshe Kotler, Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Tel Aviv
University, Sackler School of Medicine, and former chief psychiatrist of the
Israeli Defense Forces, submitted the protocol for our Israeli MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy pilot study to a local ethics committee (called an
Institutional Review Board (IRB) in the US)--the first step in the approval
process.  This study is to take place at Beer Yaakov Mental Health Center
and will administer MDMA to people suffering from treatment-resistant
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to war or terrorism. Dr. Rael
Strous, psychiatrist at Beer Yaakov Mental Health Center, is coordinating
the protocol review process.

If passed by the local IRB, it will be submitted to a national IRB, an extra
step that does not exist for studies in the US. Once it is passed by the
local and national IRBs it will need to be approved by the Ministry of
Health, the equivalent to the US FDA. The protocol will also be submitted to
the FDA for review, to ensure that the data gathered will be reviewed by FDA
as well as by the Israeli Ministry of Health. We're still months away from
starting the study, but it's looking quite hopeful. MAPS met with
representatives of the Ministry of Health and the Israeli Anti-Drug
Authority during a trip to Israel in March. Officials from both agencies
said they think in principle that the study should take place, with formal
review of the protocol still required.

MAPS-produced psychedelic emergency video on the way

As part of MAPS¹ educational mission, we have created a pilot instructional
video about how to deal with difficult psychedelic experiences, to be shown
as part of a Unitarian Universalist drug education course for young people.
This pilot video was made possible by a grant from the Unitarian
Universalists for Drug Policy Reform (UUDPR). While the target audience for
this video is high school students, it is applicable for anyone who may
encounter people who use psychedelics. The video, which illustrates a party
scene where a young man becomes overwhelmed by his psychedelic experience
and two concerned partygoers step in to help, is being produced by MAPS
staffer Jagdeep Davies, with narration by Rick Doblin. The video was
pilot-tested at one Unitarian congregation and with the feedback received we
will refine the video. When completed, we will reproduce it on DVD and VHS
to distribute from our website to parents, schools, and psychedelic users.
If you are interested in sponsoring the development of the psychedelic
emergency video, please contact: jag@maps.org

Latest MDMA Literature Review posted to our website

MAPS staffer Ilsa Jerome has completed and posted the latest MDMA Literature
Review update <http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/litupdate3> to our website.
It contains papers found between March 2004 and January 2005 and focuses on
issues relevant to estimating the risks and benefits of clinical trials with
MDMA. Sections include clinical trials, studies in ecstasy users and
non-human animal and in-vitro studies. This is the third update to the
comprehensive literature review.

Ilsa writes: ³This year neither clinical trials nor studies in ecstasy users
produced any "novel" results, though several studies in ecstasy users
suggest that psychological problems are more closely associated with drug
use generally, and are not uniquely related to use of any one drug, and more
findings of impaired visual memory in ecstasy users rather than in verbal
memory. Findings from a study and a conference report of ecstasy users in
naturalistic settings are intriguing  as well. This year's crop of non-human
animal studies are where the most interesting findings are, from findings
concerning different measures of serotonin function to findings of long-term
effects in young rats, and a nine-study opus on the neurochemistry behind
immunological changes produced by MDMA.²

You can check out the newest update on the website, with links up on the
MDMA page. You can view it in HTML
(http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/litupdate3) or as a PDF
(http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/protocol/litupdate3.pdf). For those who
want to scroll down through the entire document in HTML without relying on
a navigational bar, we also have a version that allows this

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Revenge of the Sith..

Take heart.  there is always Clone Wars
http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/promos/200503_starwars/

which, is some ways is better than the movies, at least ep I and II

it's done by the folks that make samurai jack.

clone wars vol. 21- is on the web.  you have to rent/buy vol. 1-20.

WTMF?!?!?!?

My reaction is the same as Mr Copperpot's there... and I *know* he's seen  
some shit... I had to pause and reflect with my eyes closed.

And I thought just the squirming and bouncing on the exercise equipment  
was strange... I'm a changed man after viewing that.
Apparently when you are that fast and that strong, there is little room  
left for any semblance of mental stability.

This kind of crotch enhancement is expensive, I see.  I can actually lift 
the front end of a car with my erect member -- no need of a jack for my 
friends.

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the 
world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those 
years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a 
world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite 
and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination 
practiced in past centuries ..."
- David Rockefeller, Bilderberg club permanent member, 1991

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] Space Weapons.... the new WMDs





As reported in yesterday's New York Times the military and the White House 
are discussing a renewed push for space-based weapons. Addressing the House 
yesterday, Kucinich called this "astronomical arrogance" and questioned the 
morality of such an initiative while pointing out the incredible cost of 
space-based weapons. Read the floor speech.

This morning Dennis Kucinich announced legislation, H.R. 2420 - which has 28 
co-sponsors so far - to counter space-based weapons programs. Watch for more 
information on how you can help gain passage of this legislation at 
http://www.kucinich.us.

I have a hardon for the War Of The Worlds remake - even if lame ass Tom 
Cruise is the star.

And Fantastic Four - yes.

The new Batman looks ok too - could be violent. Too bad Christian Bale is

Subject: RE: [sfraves] anyone attending STARSCAPE 2005 (east coast)?

I have been to many Starscapes. It is the ONE party in the DC/Bmore area 
that I would go to no matter what the lineup. Lonnie Fisher and Ultraworld 
productions (as well as Scott Henry & Feelgood) have been doing this for 
years. The locale is tight, the ravers come out in droves, and the music is 
almost always on point all around.

I highly recommend it.

What's wrong with space-based weapons?
I can't think of a better place in terms of global reach and resistance to  
attack...

That's one reason- and well- presumably once space-based weapons systems  
were in place and proven effective, the planet-based weapons would no  
longer be needed-
So space-based weapons are a good way to decrease the number of weapons on  
the planet!
And this is fucking NRR!

Doesn't sound like such a bad idea to me with Korea up to no good.
Only a matter of time before someone tosses a warhead our way
and It would be comforting to know there would be an alternative
other than retaliation. i.e. WW3...

The reality of space based weapons is that they will not be WMDs
unless we put nukes on them. Anything else we can lift into space
will be many orders of magnitude too little energy to be remotely
called a WMD, and I do not think that is what they are talking about
here.

Subject: [sfraves] interesting.... DJ SCRATCHING PERFORMANCE TECHNIQUES: ANALYSIS AND
 SYNTHESIS

http://www.speech.kth.se/~hansen/files/HansenBresin_Scratching_Smac03.pdf

DJ SCRATCHING PERFORMANCE TECHNIQUES: ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS
Kjetil Falkenberg Hansen and Roberto Bresin
Department of Speech Music and Hearing (TMH)
Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)
{hansen,bresin}@speech.kth.se
ABSTRACT
Scratching is a popular way of making music, turning the DJ into
a musician. Normally scratching is done using a vinyl record, a
turntable and a mixer. Vinyl manipulation is built up by a number
of specialized techniques that have been analysed in a previous
study. The present study has two main objectives. First is to better
understand and model turntable scratching as performed by DJs.
Second is to design a gesture controller for physical sound models,
i.e. models of friction sounds. We attached sensors to a DJ
equipment set-up. Then a DJ was asked to perform typical scratch
gestures both isolated and in a musical context, i.e. as in a real
performance. He also was asked to play with different emotions:
sad, angry, happy and fearful. A model of the techniques used by
the DJ was built based on the analysis of the collected data. The
implementation of the model has been done in pd. The Radio Baton,
with specially adapted gesture controllers, has been used for
controlling the model. The system has been played by professional
DJs in concerts.

The conscience of the world is so guilty that it always assumes that
people who investigate heresies must be heretics; just as if a doctor who
studies leprosy must be a leper. Indeed, it is only recently that science
has been allowed to study anything without reproach.

Isn't our submarine-based nuclear arsenal enough?

We can lob 140 hydrogen bombs onto any point on the planet in 10 minutes.
And thats just from a single submarine.

Submarines are totally hidden from the enemy, nobody knows where they are.

Maybe we should spend that money to balance our budget instead.  

How will space-based weapons help in a war like Iraq?

Once we start putting weapons in space, our enemies will use brute-force
means to destroy them.  The easiest way is simply filling space with an 
orbit of high-speed pellets... a cloud of space junk that will destroy 
anything in orbit.  This could very easily prevent us from ever
putting anything into orbit again.  Essentially locking us on our
planet, ending space exploration for enternity.

Still think space-based weapons are a good idea?

The cost of defeating a missle defense will always be 1/10th the price
of the defense system.

Look, there is still no technology available that will allow a missle
defense to deal with a cloud of decoy weapons.

The cost of all this will spiral out of control.  We are already 400 billion
in debt each year.  Where will all this money come from?  Do you want
to raise taxes to pay for it?  I mean, if you come up with the money to
build it, I *might* think about supporting it.  But don't support weapons
systems unless you find a way to pay for them.

oh, but we NEED these weapons systems to keep control of the cheap  
energy supply that fuels our totally unsustainable way of life.

and what's $400 billion, really? it's such an abstraction. i want my  
big mac and 4,500 sq ft tract house.

too much moksha in one set could be dangerous!

actually, tom will be just returning from a trip that evening and i
wanted him to have time to go home and shower before he came to the
party.  so i switched spots with him so that you all don't have to
smell his stinky BO!

hope to see some of you folks there!

Good news! KZSU is now in the radio list in itunes. Just open itunes,
click the 'Radio' source in the left column, and open either the

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Skate!

Ever since I became sober I've been skating again. I suck my tongue in
remembrance of... oh wait, that was a Bjork song.

Anyway. Just wanted to know if any ravers/clubbers out there also skate
(as in Skateboard, not fairybooting)

Skating is a lot like raving to me, especially when it is done to good
music. It makes me up. Especially when I have a good day and land
tricks. As with raving it has its ups and downs and it's associated
risks.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Skate!

 I too skate a bit, i just picked it back up after a roughly 20 year
break.  I never was one to do tricks or anything, just kinda putted
around, and i've found picking it back up, was a little tough at
first, i still can't do any tricks, my legs are too retarded or
something, i can barely ollie still, but i'm working on it.  I havent
been as diligent about getting out and riding, but i plan on getting
back into it shortly, after moving and all that calms down and i got
some time to kill.

Fairybooting....that kicks ass.  I havent heard that term before, but
i'm gonna make it my new favorite term...hehehe.
It reminds me of that GutterMouth song, Do the Hustle.  if you've
heard it you know what i'm talking about and if not, here's the
lyrics:

Hey, how did everybody get in my room?

It's saturday another perfect day
until I hit the boardwalk headed towards the pier
"You're fucking gay!"
"Fuck you! Outta my way!"
50,000 jackoffs on rollerblades
Greased up dolphin shorts
Wrist guards so it won't hurt
Your mediocre girlfriend hits a parked car! Yea!
So until the day you learn to surf or skate;
College jackoff faggot, Sportin Oakley shades!

On rollerblades! Yea!
Crash helmets to be safe!
On rollerblades! Yea!
Crash helmets to be safe!

Whoopie! It's fun to skate!
I'll do a figure 8
Watch me do a circle
going backwards down the stairs
Oh gee! This is fun!
Looks like I better run
14 guys on skateboards wanna ollie off my head!
Yea!

This sport is so extreme
You roller disco queens
Go and do the hustle at the roller wonderland
She blades to shrink her thighs
So she can justify
2 all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions,
on a sesame seed bun!

Neat! Neat! I really think its neat!
I'm stealing every trick from every
skateboarder i meet
Neat! Neat! I really think its neat!
You stupid faggot roller bladers!!

Roller Wonderland!
Cum-guzzlin Fruitcakes!
I hope you break your hands!
Roller Wonderland!
Cum-guzzlin Fruitcakes!
I hope you break your fucking neck!!

YOU STUPID ROLLER SKATER GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY!!!

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the 
world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those 
years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a 
world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite 
and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination 
practiced in past centuries ..."
- David Rockefeller, Bilderberg club permanent member, 1991

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

I saw Ken Ishii at WMC a few years back and he was
fantastic.

Highly recommended!

i agree. ultraworld parties hold a very special place
in my heart... too many beautiful moments to name
here. don't even know who will be there this year but
i was thinking of flying back for it... though for me
it would be an opportunity to hook up with many old
friends it is definitely a party worth going to
regardless of your ties to the dc/bmore scene.
specially if you are cravin a massive... miss the
thanksgiving parties at the armory especially...

who you are) going to be anywhere on the east coast
that week and can get to it GO! GO! GO! not only is
ultraworld one of the best at throwing massives (in my
very biased opinion) but the line-up fuckin rocks!!! 
armistead park can be hard to find' get to if you
don't know where you're goign though, so make sure you
get good directions. wish i could give them to you but
every time i went we got lost and found it...

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Tonight, Digga Beat III...

What's up y'all, tonight I'll be playin' at Digga Beat 3 at 10PM.  Y'all 
should stop by and dance with us.  The rest of the info is below.

See ya there,
Joey Frisco (DTS, Nocturnalism Ent.)

==========================================================
***Update: 5th room added... check timeslots below for more info.


Digga Beat III

Room 1

E.N.D (Goodfellaz Crew, Pitched Up Recordings, Happyhardcore.com- Toronto, 
Canada)
Coming from Totonto, E.N.D is one of the most clever dj's to grace the 
decks. His style is not only unique but unmatched by any other dj in 
Toronto. In 2002 he hooked up with the Goodfellaz and has never looked back. 
E.N.D. has been riping up crowds not only as a DJ but as one of the top 
featured MC's on the east coast. As you would any of the Pitched up Crew 
expect nothing else but the best from this sure crowd pleaser.
No Left Turn & Joshua (LiquidVinyl/KFA)
GO-ZANIA (HCFTP)
MollyMush (HCFTP/RAVE N' BEATS USA)
SideShow (HCFTP/DTS)
Hi-C (NU VISION)
Dj Elixir (NU VISION/ djelixir.com

Room 2

Pistachio vs. Anonymous (www.djpistachio.com)

So, if I "swing through" with my flyers for my upcoming event, do I get
to skip out on the $15 cover and still get one of your free CDs?

Subject: [sfraves] political spam - Tell your friends: Please sign emergency
  petition to save our courts


If the far right (not the Bush admin; they are the point man for all of 
this) gets ahold of the courts,
I am afraid it will be the beginning of the end.  I don't usually send spam 
like this out, but this is important
enough I feel.  It's not very easy to roll back changes in the law (only 
now has a 1779 law banning American Indians
from the city of Boston been repealed) and the law, or rather the thought 
and view of reality behind the law, shapes
society and how it operates.

But then again, when 1/4 or 1/3 of high school seniors think the government 
has some right in banning free speech....
the changes happening in society may already be taking hold....

<sigh>

Hi!

I just signed MoveOn PAC's emergency petition to stop the "nuclear option" 
the far right wing's plan to seize absolute power to stack our courts - and 
I hope you will sign too.

Starting Monday, the petition will be delivered straight to Congress every 
three hours until the final vote, and many of our comments will be read 
aloud on the Senate floor.

Please find out more and sign right now at:

http://www.moveonpac.org/nuclear

Thanks!

It was an awesome night... the turnout was pretty low when I left but a lot 
of people were showing up saying that they were stuck in bridge traffic for 
an hour and a half or so...  anyway, I'm a friend is going to host the mix 
later today and I'll post the link when it's available.

Man - that really works? I'ma go to record stores and grab stacks of fliers 
and start going to all the parties I wanna go to under the guise of being a

So I suppose you would actually have to WANT to go to a party like "Digga
What III".  Do parties that cater to 16 yr. olds even have booze anyway?
Maybe wine coolers and bud light stolen from their parents fridges..hehe.

;)

PS:  But if it works...and the party is nice.  Lemme know!!  =)

Once again - surely I jest, lol.

I'm not a rabid anti-candy kid, but I also don't really get into those kinds 
of parties. Just not my scene. Gimme a rough warehouse with techno & breaks 
- that's my jam.

thomas kent played a damn tasty breaks set last night.

AND there was some pretty impressive mixing going on in the jungle room 
- "pour some sugar on me" dropped into the set was a personal favorite. 
i'd rather hear a DJ go out on a limb and have a less-than-flawless 
set, than hear drum-tight mixes and minimal creativity.

happycore is happycore, as far as i'm concerned, but there WAS some 
good music there, and good people.  get off yer damn high horses

Hmmm.  Same mentality as the people who feel we've got to kill the

Hi SFravers,
I am sorry that I missed the 5-year anniversary party, but I am writing to everyone (especially the DJs) to thank you for the music (short list follows). If your name is on this list, rest assured that your sounds have been playing around various campfires in the US West. I even had fun brandishing some glowsticks while chillin' to this music.

I have been on a memorable journey and now I re-subscribed to say a few words. More on that later. Don't worry, I won't exceed my posting limit per day.

For now, I must say that while traveling I have enjoyed ALL of the music captured on hand-burned and commercially-produced CDs by artists such as:

AC Slater (60 Minutes of Uplifting Happy Hardcore)
Alex Van Dune (FIX)
Amber (CityDweller: Acid Trance Lives Underground)
Andrew Phelan (1984: Chapter 2, San Francisco)
Andy W 
the Candle (In a Dark Place)
Canton (Live @ the creamery Pt II 12/2/2000, Oakland CA)
Denise (theundergroundurbansound)
DJ Andy M (Lavarat--Progressive Psychedelia/Psytrance)
DJ Burn (Salvador, 10/2001)
DJ Cantos (Cantos)
DJ Jack Triumph (progression)
DJ Kir Kryyn (Beyond Good and Evil)
DJ Fuckwork (Phase 1: Live at Ascension)
DJ Mollymush (Here I Go & Summer Lovin')
DJ Tsar (Untold)
Doc Martin (fabric 10)
Ganymede (Harvesting the Space Lotus)
Hypnomatic
Jonah (Jonah presents Temple of the Drums)
Justin Hale (3 weeks)
Kevin James (Acid Reflex)
MC Boomerang (Jan '04 Rap & DJ Overdubs)
No Left Turn (Bad Reception 2)
Shawn Allen (DUBTECH)
ShezTek (Hit Me, Beat Me, Break Me)

If I missed you, forgive me because I still have a lot of stuff in storage. I am so thankful for the variety of EDM. Whatever happens, the music will never leave me.

Wait through the tedious intro sequence and then click

Subject: Re: [sfraves] political spam - Tell your friends: Please sign emergency petition to save our courts

personally, I believe that taking the government from one corrupt
group, and giving it to one that's just as equally corrupt, solves
nothing, in the long run.

Instead, Perhaps we should fix our broken system, supported and
created by both democrats, and republicans, than bitching about one
side or another.

Irony in this situation, is that the groups with the most tax breaks,
are those in the salary range of senators, house members, and other
politicians.

No matter who you vote into office,no matter what party is in control,
no matter what laws you lobby for, or what you try to change,
understand that the system is still broken.

Democrat or republican, their ultimate goals are still to stay on top.

WW3.

WW3 will start in China -- not the Middle East. Japan has been
forbidden by international law to build weapons ever since WW2 but
China will obtain more military power after the US invades Korea.
China will successfully invade Taiwan, and US-occupied Korea will not
be able to stop them. At this point, the prohibition on Japanese
weapons manufacture will end. This'll be about 2010, 2015. The
Americans will initiate it, thinking they can use the Japanese to
control China, and in the end they will sorely regret it.

The Japanese will nearly instantaneously adapt their robotics
technologies to military purposes. Not only will mecha armor suits be
a reality, they'll also make giant robot dragons. These giant robot
dragons will be completely unnecessary, tactically speaking, because
in practical terms they'll have the same functionality as helicopters,
but the Japanese will build them anyway. (Count on it.)

The psychological effect will be absolutely terrifying. The war will
begin when Japan invades China. Japan will not make significant
inroads in China, and will not be able to control the territory it
claims -- if island nations could take over continental empires
effectively, both the British and the Japanese would have done it many
many times, but the very idea is absolutely ludicrous -- but the
Japanese will do it anyway. Their real goal will be to get far enough
inland for their dragons to attack Chinese who don't realize that the
dragons are robots. The psychological effect, again, will be
absolutely terrifying, more so in this case. This will in fact be the
entire purpose of World War 3 -- terrifying ignorant Chinese peasants
-- but only the ruling classes of China and Japan will realize this,
and neither of those groups of people will admit it.

Unfortunately, the rest of the world will believe the Japanese to have
turned into completely insane, murderous lunatics, and all sorts of
hell will break loose. What's really interesting about this war is
that it may be the first "World War" where the Americans enter the
fray too soon, and also the first where they lose. America's goal will
be to prevent the conflict from spiralling out of hand, but in their
excessive desire for power and control, they'll mistake a border
skirmish in an aeons-old rivalry for a serious act of war, primarily
because of all the dragons setting peasants on fire, which, when it
appears on CNN for the first time, will pretty much be enough to get
anybody worked up. (Also, the President will be another Bush, and
entering wars impetuously to distract the people from bad economic
policy at home is already a tradition in that dynasty.)

Entering Asia in military force, the Americans will leave their
occupied territories unprotected. Never imagining how much more
important self-rule is to the Arab peoples than material wealth,
they'll attempt to set up the usual puppet governments, but the minute
American military resources are focused on Asia, those puppet
governments will topple. Arabs will set oil fields on fire from
Afghanistan to Egypt, and between that and the robot dragons, the
Americans will think the whole world has gone insane. Violent
opposition to American corporations and puppet governments serving
American interests will also erupt in Central and South America,
particularly in Argentina and Colombia, to a large extent inspired by
the ferocity of the Arabs. In Argentina the government will collapse
completely; in Colombia the cocaine cartels will declare their leader
king and demand recognition in the United Nations.

At this point the Americans will resort to the bomb. They will say
it's the second time they've had to use the bomb on the Japanese, and
that it's the Japanese's fault. What they won't anticipate will be the
Japanese response.

Soon after, the moon is destroyed, and that's when things get really
out of hand. The Zeta Reticulans retaliate in 2032, and Trogdor is
first seen on Earth in 2035.

Afghanistan to Egypt, and between that and the robot dragons, the
Americans will think the whole world has gone insane. Violent
opposition to American corporations and puppet governments serving
American interests will also erupt in Central and South America,
particularly in Argentina and Colombia, to a large extent inspired by
the ferocity of the Arabs. In Argentina the government will collapse
completely; in Colombia the cocaine cartels will declare their leader
king and demand recognition in the United Nations.

At this point the Americans will resort to the bomb. They will say
it's the second time they've had to use the bomb on the Japanese, and
that it's the Japanese's fault. What they won't anticipate will be the
Japanese response.

Soon after, the moon is destroyed, and that's when things get really
out of hand. The Zeta Reticulans retaliate in 2032, and Trogdor is
first seen on Earth in 2035.

Greetings SFR,
 
Anyone here know any wholesalers or distributors for the aforementioned goods?
 
I'm primarily looking for metal & glass pipes by the lot, zig zags & blunt wraps by the case, and grinders. I hold a CA seller's permit, and would like to buy by in bulk.
 
Much Obliged,
 
Chuck

You can get most old school boards still these days. There are a lot of
reissues and at the skatepark I frequent, about 10% of the guys ride
them.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Skate!

Oh god- "throwbacks"-

I dunno about the rest of you- but I just can't ride a shortboard anymore-
You fogeys need to switch to longboards-
Get a nice flexy Sector-9 and some Exskate trucks- some big cushy wheels-  
and start cruisin...

I dunno if it's still around but the NCDSA was the spot back in 97- the  
domain is dead so I'm guessing it is no longer.
On full-moon nights the cinnabar hills golf course still occasionally  
calls...

The people rejoiced, and there was much burnination.

Trogdor was soon joined by the GlcNAc alliance and through their combined  
powers, nothing escaped their wrath.

Hi everyone. It's time for another monthly installment of Secret Psychedeli=
ca. Tonight will be one special night. Not only is it a full-moon, but musi=
cally, things have changed up for tonight. We'll still have psychedelic tra=
nce brought to you by local heroes, Obu, Epsilon, Pikasso, and Michael Liu,=
 however, the main room will be set up for breaks! Another surprise is that=
 an original Secret Society member will be in the house. (Here's a little e=
xplaination - Secret Psychedelica was born from a multi-genre weekly called=
 Secret Society. There were about five people putting it all together but w=
e had since ended the weekly and only Secret Psychedelica, the psytrance th=
emed night, kept going.) Tonight, we'll be welcoming home Secret Society's =
original tech-house resident, Gabriel Black, and his awesome Summit Soundsy=
stem. And not a moment to soon as our special guest for tonight is Breakbea=
t Science DJ and Rockstar Energy drink spokesmodel, Reid Speed. The combine=
d forces of her mixing skills and track selection as well as the crystal cl=
ean Summit Soundsystem are sure make a big impact in the halls Secret Psych=

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Live Mix from Future (Electrotech/clash/techno)

Greets,

I just want to get the word out about Future (www.futuresf.com) a new club 
night featuring electrotech/clash, synthpop, future pop.. The opening night 
was quite fun and I recorded my live mix from the evening and you can find 
it at the link below.. Some new tunes that I believe this scene might be 
interested in hearing:
http://www.egregious.net/comps/live_mix_5_19_05/

Do check out the club when it occurs next.. :) I'm also gathering that this 
mix will interest a lot more people on this list than say my more favored 
hard techno / powernoise interests. So, post your comments.. I'd like to 
hear them as I usually receive silence (on the dance floor unfortunately 
and off) when I'm doing hard techno.

Subject: [sfraves] The Great God Om, otherwise known as Lucky


So this isn't music related in any way shape or form, but yesterday I came 
across a turtle in the middle of the road, and no one in any of the houses 
on that street claimed him. As far as I can tell he's a land turtle w/ a 
nasty disposition. Does anyone have any hints on what to do with him? So far 
he's resigned himself to giving me evil glares ( I didn't know turtles could 
do that) from inside an aquarium.

you could call the East Bay Vivarium and tell them what sort of  
critter you found.  they should be able to help you figure out what  
to do with him.

Thanks. I did get some sort of food with calcium& stuff. Being a cat person 
the idea of what to do with a reptile was totaly alien. Yes, I fear that a 
younger brother has gotten quite attached, so the evil glares are sure to 
continue. Again, thanx for the help, Lord knows I kneed all I can get.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Secret Psychedelica v5.5>Monday, May 23rd (fwd)

This was awesome!

Reid Speed took a copy of my record! Although I don't know if she'll
ever actually listen to it. And whoever said she was cute was not
lying at all. She's like Bubbles with headphones! She does the New
York head-askew thing, it's like this kind of obnoxious gesture, but
when she does it, it's **demure**. I never in a million years would
have imagined it was even possible to do that gesture demurely. She
smiles like an angel, I want to put her in an evening dress with
ruffles and buy her diamonds and a trained swan.

And Terry let me pilot the mighty Viberation Graphics armada. Jesus,
what a night out! Actually it'd be more truthful to say that Terry
showed me how to push three buttons and then he ran away and hid
somewhere. I'm not even kidding, I scanned the entire room several
times, Inspector Gadget couldn't have found him. So I was sort of
like...uh...well I'll push those three buttons **really**
**quickly!!** Like -- to the beat!

That was like the most amazing night out I've had all year.

It might actually be the only night out I've had all year. Hmm.

Anyway. Wow.

Saw Li, and Alex, who I haven't seen in years, and finally officially
met Aaron Jae, and saw Scott Scosol, whose real name I forgot (sorry!)
and met some people, and then I was like "hey Reid Speed here's a
record" and she was like "is it breaks?" and I was like "uh..."

God that was awesome. Except I wish I'd given her a better record. I
need to make more records now. Which means I have to get a job. FUCK!

Oh well.

Anyway yeah that hella rocked.

Subject: [sfraves] [NRR] Gear for Sale

Hey everyone, I just wanted to post this out to all of you first.

I have some DJ Equipment that I want to get rid of.

1 - DJ Coffin (holds 19" mixer) and Stand
1 - Cerwin Vega 12" Monitor and Stand
(http://store.salestores.com/cevev1122way.html) a few years old, but
rarely ever used.
1 - 1.5 ft. Single Bulb Black Light
1 - 4 ft. Dual Bulb Black Light
1 - Red DJ Spot light
1 - Strobe light
1 - QSC PLX-2402 Amp
(http://www.qscaudio.com/products/amps/plx/plx.htm) Been used at a lot
of parties, but still works.  The left channel cut out on it once, but
i tapped the amp and it came back and hasn't had a problem since.

I don't want this in my house anymore, so first person with cash takes
the whole shebang...she bang...she bang...oh god why did i get that
going in my head again....

I'll let it all go for $200, OBO.

attempts to expand controversial provisions set to expire this year.

Senate Intelligence Committee Examines Controversial Patriot Act Expansion=
=20
Bill; Closed Door Vote to Be Held This Week

May 24, 2005

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact: Media@dcaclu.org

WASHINGTON - The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence met today to=20
consider legislation that would reauthorize - and expand - the Patriot=20
Act. The American Civil Liberties Union denounced attempts to expand,=20
rather than critically review and reform, the controversial provisions set=
=20
to expire at the end of the year. A proposal to make the law=92s most=20
controversial provisions permanent, and to expand it by allowing FBI=20
agents issue their own search orders with no advance court approval, will=
=20
likely be voted on in secret Thursday.

"Now is the time to bring the Patriot Act in line with the Constitution -=
=20
not expand it," said Lisa Graves, ACLU Senior Counsel for Legislative=20
Strategy. "Concerned citizens from across the political spectrum have=20
spoken out against the Patriot Act=92s secrecy: many provisions are=20
implemented secretly, and the government has kept secret key information=20
on how these extraordinary powers are being used. Now, some lawmakers are=
=20
trying to keep debate and votes on legislation to reauthorize and expand=20
the Patriot Act secret as well."

The bill would grant so-called "administrative subpoena" authority to the=
=20
FBI, letting the bureau write and approve its own search orders for any=20
tangible thing it deems relevant to an intelligence investigation without=
=20
approval. This power would let agents seize personal records from medical=
=20
facilities, libraries, hotels, gun dealers, banks and any other business,=
=20
without having to appear before a judge, and without any evidence that the=
=20
people whose records are swept in are involved in any criminal activity.

The proposal would also give the FBI broad new powers to track people=92s=
=20
mail in intelligence inquiries. It would force postal workers to disclose=
=20
the name, address and other information appearing on envelopes delivered=20
to or from people designated by the FBI, without any meaningful=20
protections.

The bill would permit secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act=20
searches and surveillance for the sole purpose of criminal prosecution for=
=20
certain crimes, such as terrorism and espionage, allowing searches to=20
proceed without following the requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the=
=20
Constitution. FISA searches were designed to be used a tool in=20
intelligence gathering investigations, so they are held to lower=20
evidentiary standards than criminal investigations.

Without limits on how the powers can be used, the proposed legislation=20
creates the very real possibility that FISA will now be used to conduct=20
searches and seizures in criminal investigations without probable cause=20
that a crime has been committed, the ACLU said. In other words, it will=20
let law enforcement do an end run around the Constitution.

The ACLU also noted that the proposed legislation would remove the one=20
safeguard in place against using FISA warrants recklessly. Currently, FISA=
=20
warrants cannot be issued against Americans when the investigation is=20
"conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first=20
amendment to the Constitution." The proposed legislation would amend that=
=20
limited protection so that FISA records searches can be conducted solely=20
based on First Amendment activities so long as the investigation as a=20
whole is not based solely on constitutionally protected activity.

"Protecting America also means protecting our Constitution," Graves said.=
=20
"If adopted, these broad new powers would sidestep time-honored checks and=
=20
balances. Lawmakers should hold an open process, and reject this reckless=
=20
disregard for the Fourth Amendment, which protects the liberty and privacy=
=20
of all Americans."

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Sly and Lazy Slave on An Epiphany Of Sound tomorrow

Tomorrow I'll have two san francisco djs bringing different takes on sub
fueled electronica and rhythmics.

So get ready for an illin' back-to-back versus battle that will leave
you in a total manic state. Be sure to take plenty of beta-stoppers, cuz
LAZY SLAVE will be spinning an all-school reunion of breaks that'll
leave you comin' up short on your next pop quiz.

Just when you thought it was safe to go back in, SLY will rock ya
two-time with some dubby electrical-shock house that'll totally
short-circuit what little you had left for a brain. Be prepared with
sturdy rubber shoes!

They've promised to bring me rosicrucian pool party polkas : illektro,
chunk-house, fonk, and porntempo (and, no, I'm not trying to compete
with Howard Stern.)  I'll be holding them to their promise (if it's at
all possible!)  So you must listen in: 90.1 FM over the air and
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu online from 9a-Noon pacific time.

Ram ram!

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOMAO   Oh my goodness man... Hello 2Day... it was
sooooooooooo much fun last Saturday & ya know.. i really didn't feel bad
about any of the other events that I mised out on that night 'vcause it
was all about getting DIRTY on Sat night!!!

Opening set w/ Mista Bam & Jauncy was sick... I'd probably describe their
tag set as just a sown home funky SF breaks set that blew me away... Aaron
Jae (now known as Poppa Jae since they got Mama Jamaica hangin' on the
wall every event) & MOD spun this Dope Dope Dope Future Breaks set that
made me feel like a Britney Soears dancer graduated 2 a Janet Jackson
Dancer while I grabbed floor... Ms. Audio Angel graced the set w/ her
Awesome Singing.. YUM!!!  Reid Speed was Sick.. this weas the 1st time i
ever heard her spin Breaks like in the whole 4 years i've known her.... it
was fun catchin up & talkin' 2 her about eeeeeeverything!@!!  WowWW!!!!

Donna Matrix was sick as always w/ her set... she spun alot wait.. I'm
conufzed... OK.. these was a nice yummy set of Acid Breaks but it was
wither during like Reid's sset, Ms Mtraix's set... or Ripple's set... buyt
yeah... Donna spun alota wicked, Evil, DiRtY tracks.. LOVED IT!!!  Love U
Donna!!!

OK.. this was the set I been waiting 4 the whole night.. 'cause like
Ripple & I have well.. there's a thread 4 this on Groundscore about
this... but like i was sayin'g how Reid Speed spins 2 Step (& I didn't
really hear any in her set that night) so Ripple said that he'd bring some
new 2Step records he just got 7 I'm like sooooooooo mondo hello 2Day happy
2 Say that a good portion of the 2nd part of his set was 2 Step & I
LOOOOOOOOOOOOVED IT!!!  OOH YEAH!!!

Then closing out the night was Influence & Sheztek... WOW!!!  Like they
got totally funky.. infact.. i heard this 1 track that Sheztek put in a
demo like 2-3 years ago & I fuckin' LOVED it!!!

It was Groovy.. the vibe was Sick as usual w/ the following the the Evil
Break following has!!!  It was a Dope night & hoestly... I can say 1 of
the mondo highlights of this night was hanignin out w/ Ranger again/...
Dude... I hella missed ya man 7 u did get taller U fucker!!!  Lol :P  Love
U Ranger!!  Oh yeah.. Samira was hella looking 4 when she popped up BTW...

OK... I'M HERE @  school right now tryin'2 attempt 2 do my homework since
i don't have a computer @ my home currently (mm motherboard decided 2 go
kaput on me) & after a few more thingies online.. I shuld be good... so la

I heard a story once about Aphrodite.  Seems he was spinning at
the WMC one year.  Some tranny club put him on the bill because
they thought he was *HERMaphrodite*.

I wish I was there for that show.

UNLEASH YOUR INNER KRAKEN

When they've had enough rum, the old-timers sing
the tale of the last voyage of the Jiggletech,
a noble submarine. Weighing anchor, she drifted from
port and set out in search of the Other World, an
undersea grotto of kinky pyramids and giant pearls.

  Dom (FnF)

Fearing the pleasures this might unleash, a squadron
of black helicopters intercepted the vessel at the
horizon's edge. The good ship dove for the ocean floor
as depth charges rained down from the sky! Relentless
sonic pressures pounded her hull with each detonation,
discharging waves of unending acoustical force.
Her hatches battened, her bulkheads sealed,
the Jiggletech drifted deeper.

Beyond the reach of sunlight, the Jiggletech
found herself embraced by the coiling tentacles
of a radiant squid. Gently, this leviathan
deposited its catch on the sandy sea bottom.

  Mr. Band live

Having jaws but no gills, the submarine's divers
ventured curiously out through the hatch, snorkles
in hand, masks and tanks at the ready. What they
found was no inky abyss; all around them were
Nereids, Neptunes and shape-shifting sea-nymphs --
a deep water garden of coral and bubbles,
beautifully lit by the phosphorescence of the
benevolent squid.

I need them mostly for home dj'ing recording maybe

Actually that other guy, when he posted about her being cute etc., I
wrote a whole rant about that, it kind of went like this:

What?!
A female DJ and all you can talk about is her looks!?
Imagine if YOU  were DJing and the only thing the girls you could say
about YOU was that you were incredibly hot!
Wouldn't that suck?
Oh wait. That wouldn't suck at all. OK, fine.

Then I was like, feh, whatever.

Dude, Osby, next time you talk to Reid Speed, you gotta be like this:

"so, like, hello 2day, I know this guy, and he's like this mondo
studmuffin and all the ladies adore him and he's rich and he drives
two Ferraris at the same time and he's like the best musician in the
world and he can fly, he has superpowers from Martians, and you should
like totally have sex with him like immediately because he's so cool
all the ladies love him."

I mean like that, but like throw in some more "hello 2days" and some
"LOLs" and "WwoowowWOWO"s and "like"s and things so she can tell it's
really you and not just some bullshit that I told you to say.

Subject: [sfraves] Crush tonight?

Hey,

Is anyone going to Crush tonight (euro-trance)?  I went last week and had a great
time...looking to meet up there with other sfraves folks.  The venue is Underground
SF in Lower Haight.  I plan on getting there around 10pm.

Also...it's 21+ and no cover. (sorry kiddies!)

Give me a holler.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Crush tonight?

this is not a crack on this event nor the fans of this event, but...

i always found it odd that people would want to heard eurotrance at a
small, weekly event.  to me, the sound doesn't translate well to that
kind of venue.  trance to me always seemed more fit for a bigger
sound.  progressive house....yes, that works for a small, weekly
event.  eurotrance?  not so sure that's a good fit.  but then i'mm not
a big fan of eurotrance so i really don't know what i'm talking about.

and yes, folks.  there is good trance.  let's say it together.  "there
is good trance."

Perhaps the label "euro-trance" is throwing ppl off?

Think:
* Armin Van Buuren
* Markus Schulz
* Tiesto
* Ferry Corsten

That's the kind of music you can expect. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Crush tonight?

Tiesto - there was a remix of Flight 643 that i kinda liked, but it
was breaky.  and his remix of Innocente was nice and pretty and
proggy.

Ferry Corsten - a little too foo foo for me.  and then he went all
breaky with Punk and then electroey with Rock your Body

Markus Schulz - i think of progressive house and not so much trance

Armin Van Buren - trance

but i'll still ask the same question again:  do people want to hear
trance at a small, weekly, 21+ venue?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Crush tonight?



>and yes, folks.  there is good trance.  let's say it together.  "there
is good trance."<

Well, yes, there IS good trance.  It was made over 10 years ago before it
was dubbed "trance" and just happened to be a derivative of early techno and
house.  The first half of Cowboy Records catalogue...some  early stuff on
Warp like RAC, Rhythm Invention and the like.  A record from the early 90's
called "Transient Truth".  The artists name is slipping my memory right now.
Damn that shit was good!  I used to play a shit ton of it...and consider
some of the tracks to be some of my all time favs.  Makes the foo-foo crap
balls people call trance now-a-days look like...well...foo-foo crap balls.
I liked it better when it was all just underground dance music.


>ps.  $10 says chris jackson is going to respond to this thread<

Sooooo.  Anybody take the bet and lose some cash to B??


hehehe,

chris

ONE DOVE 
or more specific 
One Dove/Transient Truth/JBO/1992/UK

worth a small mint now as far as vinyl goes..  I got
rid of mine years ago, then searched a bit and luckily
found another. I think there are a couple copies at In
House in Simon's consignment bin for any of you
'classics' collectors... :)

Well - Rennie Pilgrem did remixes of Ferry Corstens tracks. He's about the 
only "trance" dj nowadays that I can semi tolerate.

The rest of that lofty arpeggiated fluff crap can burn in the deepest of 
hells.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Crush tonight?

The early platipus records were really good.

i like the german "trance" that Sandra Collins used to play. (prolly still
does)

i like progressive that some people call trance that doesn't have any
hoovers or drum build ups or girls singing remakes of songs that were
terrible in the first place.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Crush tonight?

Am I the only one that started crying when I read the words Euro-trance in
relation to what used to be The Top?  Tonight used to be teh best of the
house muzak for years running there.  If there's one good thing I think
that's been happening out here, it's that crap big room "trance" is dying
a slow death, it's not getting nearly the support it once was, and the psy
scene, amongst others, seems to be on the up.

interesting  concept. I'm just wondering if anyone's played with this at  all.


 
No experience, but last I talked to the Vestax rep it was 10k.
Worth it if you DJ a lot and produce your own cuts.  Fun toy.

Subject: [sfraves] JULY 30!!!! IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE!!!!!!!!

Reliable people have been telling me it's true since last week. But it 
really only sunk in this morning, when the song came up randomly on my 
iPod. Ever since it's been damn near impossible to keep this big silly 
shit-eating grin off my face. I keep breaking out in laughter, and 
people keep wondering why,

I've already broken out my beads and bought fifteen yards of elastic.



Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no country
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as one

It only takes 20 years for a liberal to become a conservative
without changing a single idea. In an evolving universe,
who stands still moves backwards.

"jaded raver"?  i'm laughing.  really. :-)

without changing a single idea. In an evolving universe,
who stands still moves backwards.

Hey y'all - if I forgot to do so (which I am quite sure I did), a 
huuuuuuuuuuuuge thank you to Li and the Hugger-Mugger crew for allowing me 
to sleaze up their decks Tuesday night.

Much props and all that shizzle.

That's a damn fine spot - I think more EDM events should be held there. Like 
- bangin' weekendy ones.

That's my opinion and me likes it.

BREAKS.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Crush tonight?

I know i might get a lil flamed for this one...but i'll say it anyway.
 As far as trance goes, i definatly like the old trance, from the
early 90's.  It was still very danceable and very moving, with out
being all foo foo and lame.

I used to hate trance because it all sounded the same and didnt really
make me wanna dance or move or take me to another place (which is what
i thought something called trance should do) it should put you in a
trance of some sort and i just never felt that way with all the crap i
was hearing.

This is where the flames will begin, but i'll say it anyway.  Keoki's
old mixes, were what got me to realise that there was good
trance....at one point in time.  If you havent checked em out yet you
really should.  His Journey's By Dj mix is awesome.

1.OMYCRON - Whaler
2.POWER CIRCLES - Garden of peace
3.MOMENTUM - Technoriental
4.LAZONBY - Sacred Cycles
5.SHI-TAKE - Don't look back in anger
6.TRANSONIC - Sonic
7.MIKE INK - Vinyl countdown
8.E-RECTION - Colonisation of space
9.THE MIGHTY DUB CATS - Keep on truckin
10.THE SPIRIT - The Spirit
11.COOL JACK - Try the feeling
12.DIGGER - Soweto
13.BEATMISTRESS WITH XPANDO - Jazz 303
14.THE SHERMANIANS - All the way live
15.VAN BASTEN - Magnetic King

That is what i feel trance should be like.  It's very listenable, and
makes you wanna dance, and it takes your mind on a journey, with out
being all foo foo.

Some people would probably call it progressive house, but progressive
house used to be a totally differant beast in of itself.  Not this
lame crap like they have now.  Good Progressive house to me would best
be displayed on CD's like

The Stress Compilation 1 and 2 (http://www.discogs.com/release/111176
and http://www.discogs.com/release/261224)

The first one was mixed by (and some of you will proabably say some
shit about it, but they're fuckin spot on awesome mixes and tracks)
Sasha and Dave Seaman.  The 2nd one was mixed by Kimball Collins and
Steve Loria (I dont think the Steve Loria mixes are all that great but
the tracks are awesome) If you havent heard those mixes i suggest you
check them out as well, that's what progressive house should be, not
the crap that gets produced now a days, cause it's definatly more
trance then it is house.  Stress Records put out some of the best
progressive house to date.  My old roommate nick had tons of Stress
records, they're a bit harder to mix, cause they change up a lot more
and don't follow the same basic boring format as most dance music
today, you actually had to be a skilled DJ in order to mix this stuff
flawlessly, had to know that some things went on the 16 beat, and some
on the 8 rather then the standard 32 count like most all other
records.  In any case though it is some of the best driving, pumping
dancing music ever, and it's too bad it all had to evolve into what it
is now.  They just don't make tracks like that anymore.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Crush tonight?

As much as it pains me to say it nowadays, I've always been a fan of the 
Sasha & Digweed "Northern Exposure" series (especially the East Coast 
edition). That to me was "trance" that took you somewhere. Yea - some of it 
was fluffy, but it wasn't as lofty and cheesey as anything post '99 (IMHO). 
It was more relaxed and vibey. In fact, I find it has more in common with 
downtempo/ambient than it does anything else. And of course, for some reason 
lots of people call Underworld "trance", and I love them.

So it seems most of us actually LIKE the older trance...maybe I ought to dig 
out my old trance vinyl and make a cd. I'm partial to the breaky stuff (a la 
Miro "Paradise" {Creeping Farmatronic mix}) - so it would be stuff of that 
ilk.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] JULY 30!!!! IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE!!!!!!!!

Skills and UNITY will be throwing a party on July 30th called "Imagine 2000=
."

Jason and Tom did the booking for the lineup and Duckie from Unity
will be doing most of the creative work (from what i was told).

I think it'll be a fun party.  Yes, dog on the candy scene but the
fact of the matter is that UNITY parties went way fucking off.  Some
of the happiest crowds and balls out energetic raves I've been to.

My only issue with the party is that the lineup is completely
trance/nrg.  And the way I remember the UNITY parties being was a mix
of genres from trance to house to breaks to happy hardcore.  To me, a
party with all trance/nrg doesn't reflect the spirit of UNITY in a
musical sense.  But I talked to Duckie about it and it's all gravy
baby.

Yes, I might be going to this party.  And I honestly think some of you
old folks might be able to appreciate the fact that the crowd at this
party will be bouncing, smiling and being genuinely friendly towards
one another.  And that's a good thing.

The northern exposure series, to me, epitomizes
trance.  It was what I first cut my teeth on when
entering the scene.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Crush tonight?

Alot of complainers on this list....

I realize not everyone is into trance, especially in the US.  Hundreds of thousands
of ppl in Europe still love it though and follow it closely, so I think it deserves
some merit.  ("But Europeans are idiots" ...)

I don't notice any rise in psytrance.  I think breaks and deep house are on the rise
though.

What's wrong with adding some musical diversity to this city?

"My taste in music is the standard for good music."  Please stop sucking your own
cock.  Thank you.

Subject: [sfraves] Trance

figured it's kinda unfair for us to hijack someone's BSP about an
event.  not cool for the promoters and not cool for the people that
plan to attend.

so, let's talk about trance!

progressive house, old school, foo foo, psy, melodic, euro, uplifting,
atmospheric.

trance in yo' pants sucka!

John is referring, I believe, to the "Imagine"=20
parties that were given by a not-for profit=20
collective. Wonderful, magical events for=20
massive-sized parties.  I always had a memorable=20
time at them:  awesome vibe and beautiful people.

Aside from Moksha Tribe, the Imagine people were=20
the only not-for profit party givers in the=20
community:  all their profits went to local youth=20
charities.  IMHO this affects the vibe.  Those=20
who are in it for the love and the other create=20
the genuine TAZ experience.

So if there is to be another Imagine I highly recommend it.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] JULY 30!!!! IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE!!!!!!!!

this then begs the question:  is this party going to be the same  
deal, with all profits donated to youth charities?  i think that is  
an excellent motive for throwing a party, and would definitely  
support that.

an all trance/nrg lineup would kinda suck though.  it's always nice  
to have some variety, and a chill room.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Crush tonight?

There is still a lot of good prog house being produced. Granted I have not 
bought any records in about a year but im pretty sure that there are still 
good producers making good chit mang!

examples: Bill Hamel Good prog house, Chris fortier Deeper but ok prog 
house. Listen to his Bedrock 3 album and tell me that is "Trance" it is 
straight up deep house.. mixed with some progressive stuff.
Funny that you mention the defunct stress records and how prog house sucks. 
Cause one of the guys that either started the label or use to record alot of 
tracks on it,and  is a prog house producer that I happen to like. His name 
is escaping me right now but he did Mindwarp 1 and II on stress. I have to 
check the records when I get home for his name.

But then there are alot of producers that make "Prog house" that tend to be 
on the trancy side at times example: Austin leeds, Markus Schultz the guys 
over at lost language label etc..

Just depends on who you listen to in each genre..

PS: I can do a mix of nothing but techno loops and drum fills that would put 
you in a "Trance" so to speak but I would not consider it trance music.. it 
is hard banging loopy techno.

So the lesson for the day... Just because it puts you in a trance DOES NOT 
make it trance music

so im a smart ass :-)

yeah, it's a bona fide plur fest in here.

:-p


whatever. she's hot. I can't help being a guy. who are you to be
giving me shit? do I owe you something from a previous life? are you
my mother? wtf?

besides, if I'd said she's a great DJ, you'd have kept quiet with your
negative ass, and some other motherfucker would have been all like
talking shit about her DJ skills. there's always some negative
timewaster talking shit.

the woman is gorgeous. her DJing is a huge part of that. what makes
her hot isn't just the way she looks, I mean I'd seen pictures of her
etc., but it's the way she moves her head, the vibe she has, that's
some excellent shit, and if you're just like throwing weird anti-sex
guilt shit at me then you can kiss my ass. I don't give a fuck. I mean
that. I'm not even angry. I'm laughing right now. what are you wasting
my time with this for? don't you know that everybody DIES? I'm not
spending another second on this conversation while the sun is shining
and the world is full of light.

by the lineup, it seems like the party is gonna be in the greater sacramento 
area (not excluding grass valley, etc...)  Out of curiousity (without giving 
away the local of your UG, of course), is this correct?
-jf

PS - the only reason I ask, is because it looks crackin', but I have to plan 
ahead to travel 9 gazillion light years to a fiesta.

--============_-1094979451==_ma============
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Tell Congress To Oppose Sensenbrenner's HR 1528

H.R. 1528, Defending America's Most Vulnerable: Safe Access to Drug 
Treatment and Child Protection Act of 2005, is one of the worst drug 
war bills that Congress has ever considered.

Among other things, HR 1528:

--Virtually eliminates the ability of federal judges to give 
sentences below the minimum sentence recommended by federal 
sentencing guidelines, essentially creating a mandatory minimum 
sentence for every federal offense (including both drug and non-drug 
offenses).

--Expands the federal "three strikes and you're out" law to include 
new offenses, including mandating life imprisonment (with no 
possibility of parole) for anyone convicted a third time under the 
RAVE Act.

--Mandates a 10-year minimum sentence for anyone 21 or older that 
gives marijuana or others drugs to someone under 18 (i.e. a 21 year 
old college students gives a joint to his 17-year old brother). A 
second offense would be life in prison.

--Expands what is considered to be a "drug-free" school zone to 
include almost any place in an urban area, and increases penalties 
for selling or distributing drugs in that area. (The result will be 
enhanced penalties for people in inner cities, while people in rural 
and suburban areas get less time for the same offense).

--Mandates a 5-year minimum sentence for any person that commits a 
drug trafficking offense near the presence of a person under 18 or in 
a place where such person resides for any period of time. The 
sentence is 10 years if they are parent. (I.e. a mother that sells 
her neighbor a joint will get a 10-year minimum sentence, even if her 
kids were at school at the time).

--Creates a new offense for persons who witness or learn about 
certain drug offenses that fail to report the drug offender to the 
police within 24 hours or fail to provide full assistance to the 
police in tracking and prosecuting the offender. Offenses that would 
get someone a 2-year minimum sentence, including failing to report a 
neighbor that is storing or selling drugs when that neighbor has 
kids, failing to report anyone that gives a joint to someone under 
the age of 21, and failing to report a college student that is 
selling marijuana on a college campus.

--Mandates a 5-year minimum sentence for any person that offers, 
solicits, encourages, or induces a person enrolled in drug treatment, 
or previously enrolled in drug treatment, to purchase, possess or 
receive drugs.

--Makes it a federal crime to provide "drug paraphernalia" to anyone. 
While the goal is to make it a crime - punishable by up to three 
years in prison - to give someone a bong as a birthday present, it 
would also make it a federal crime to provide someone with sterile 
syringes (except where it is explicitly authorized by local or state

whatever. she's hot. I can't help being a guy. who are you to be

my mother? wtf?

besides, if I'd said she's a great DJ, you'd have kept quiet with your
negative ass, and some other motherfucker would have been all like
talking shit about her DJ skills. there's always some negative
timewaster talking shit.

the woman is gorgeous. her DJing is a huge part of that. what makes
her hot isn't just the way she looks, I mean I'd seen pictures of her
etc., but it's the way she moves her head, the vibe she has, that's
some excellent shit, and if you're just like throwing weird anti-sex
guilt shit at me then you can kiss my ass. I don't give a fuck. I mean
that. I'm not even angry. I'm laughing right now. what are you wasting
my time with this for? don't you know that everybody DIES? I'm not
spending another second on this conversation while the sun is shining

though it's not my party (i'mm just a guy who plays records!), i was
told that it would be in the bay area.  definitely not sacramento.

maybe in a place that shares it's initials with a soft drink that was
developed in georgia and is owned by Cadberry Schwepps.  but maybe
that was a rumor!

Subject: [sfraves] Trance

--0-251856406-1117150400=:32166
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I remember when I first heard the term "trance," it referred more to a style of mixing. The tracks in a trance mix were really all progressive house. Eventually, labels  started producing tracks that were trance inducing by themselves. Platipus and TIP are two labels that definitely produced "trance" tracks. At some point, the term "trance" came to represent a very distinct high enery sound. Tracks that today are called "trance" usually don't put me in a trance at all, and the way is which they are usually mixed in not trance inducing at all. It seems like the term/genre has really mutated. 
 
I know the style I played in the mid to late nineties was called trance, but I always just thought of it as high energy. I feel the style I play these days is much closer to what was originally called "trance."
 
thoughts and comments, please...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Trance

I agree with you on that point carlos it is true.. Epic or melodic trance of 
this day and age exactly as you state does not put you in a trance. It 
sounds more like a movie soundtrack to me. Hell half of the big "Trance" 
anthems are from movies. (I.E Titanic,Never ending story,Star wars, Imagine  
etc)

Trance to me are guys like: Chris Liebing.. He encompasses a true producer 
this guy has made so many solid tracks in so many different genre's it's not 
funny. 777 alpha wave, old Sven Vath and some of the harthouse catalogue. 
But guys like that really blur the lines so you can't really put it in a 
category ya dig!

ironically all I said to her was that she was a great DJ and would she
listen to my record. but hey, wtf, why not. she'll probably appreciate
it more than this list seems to! jesus. what I can't believe is that
people got so worked up about this but nobody even noticed when I said
I could smash buildings with my penis. I mean doesn't that seem kind

"Godzilla" was actually a movie about my cock? that didn't provoke any
kind of reaction at all? I can say my scrotum gives new meaning to the
term "wrecking ball" and nobody gives a shit, but I say Reid Speed is
hot, which is OBVIOUSLY TRUE, and it's this big deal?

I wonder about you people...

well, i've heard stories about your enormous cock, so that whole
godzilla thing didn't really phase me.  that's why i didn't respond.

if you'd like us to talk about your penis, why didn't you just say so?

Dude.  Eurotrance.  I think it's definition is something like "music that
sucks its own cock".  I've never heard anyone mention it as an actual
genre, just as a general phrase to describe the worst possible trance out
there spanning the cheesiest picks from different sub genres of trance.

Subject: [sfraves] A History of Hyperreal and the Beginning of SFRaves

a cobbled-together history of hyperreal
written by mike brown in december 2000
originally for publication in iron feather journal and on hyperreal.org. 
contact hyperreal for permission to reproduce elsewhere.

brian behlendorf is a southern california native who fell into the los 
angeles rave scene during his high school years. at the time, the only 
raves in the usa were in l.a., san francisco, and new york.

in 1991 he started college at u.c. berkeley and gained access to their 
computing facilities. in march of 1992, he started an online mailing list 
for the san francisco rave community: sfraves. it was a huge success. says 
brian,

     "When I moved, the only parties I could easily find up here were in 
over-21 clubs. Yet I had heard about ToonTown and Wicked and other crews, 
so out of desperation thought that starting an Internet mailing list would 
be a way to find other people who knew. Turns out that was a good idea - 
SFRaves started March 6th 1992, and that weekend I went to a party I found 
out about through the list, called the Woopy Ball. Later that year, 
August, the SFRaves list itself threw a party called "Connection" on a 
beach in Santa Cruz - that led to more parties and more use of email to 
find other ravers and coordinate underground parties."

i have to explain something here. in 1992 the only rave mailing list 
besides sfraves was ne-raves, which was hosted at m.i.t. ...someone had 
already created the alt.rave usenet newsgroup, and the uk-dance mailing 
list existed as well but wasn't focused on a rave scene. so these were 
about the only places online where people could get information about the 
scene.

longtime hyperreal contributor dan "danFREELove" philpott adds:

     "In '92 there were at least three rave lists on the east coast. UMD 
Raves (University of Maryland) was active due to the scene blowing up in 
DC. The list was really just a way to find out about parties and organize 
road trips. It went under quickly after DC Raves started up and absorbed 
most of the conversation. So DC, UMD and NE Raves were operating but only 
DC and NE survived.

     "As for LA, SF and NY having a lock on rave in the US at that time. DC 
actually was the first place on the east coast with raves. DC's 
Catastrophic parties predated (and influenced) the Storm parties in NY. 
The Storm parties are what inspired NERaves into exis-dance. NY always had 
a wikked club scene but from what I remember the rave scene hit LA first, 
then DC, then NY."

the majority of people with internet access back then were college 
students involved in computer-oriented studies, employees of well-funded 
technology companies like at&t, and a smattering of u.s. government and 
military agencies. consumer-oriented services like compuserve, genie, 
prodigy and aol, as well as most dialup bbs 'networks' were not on the 
internet, or had very limited gateways for mail and news that no one knew 
about. there was no spam, and since you weren't interacting with a true 
cross-section of the general public, the entire net had a different 
character than it does today, socially.

to be a part of the internet at that time was a big deal, because 
everybody who could contribute something to it was able to do so and be 
heard, and their contributions were more often than not of significant 
value. it was easy to concentrate and filter information into very 
valuable outlets like mailing lists, newsgroups, and ftp-accessible 
repositories.

and at the same time, it wasn't a big deal, because no one foresaw that it 
would become what it is today. we were just into it because we had access 
to it, usually on someone else's tab, and it allowed us to connect and 
exchange ideas with people whose interaction and ideas we valued. there 
was a lot of signal in a very small number of places, and hardly any noise 
except what we generated ourselves. definitely a different internet than 
today.

so as the rave scene started to blow up nationwide, we'd tell each other 
online about the flyers we found and the records we bought and the parties 
we went to. you'd have people in the midwest who were driving 9-12 hours 
to get to raves in new york and d.c., and to hang out with the friends we 
made through these online forums. the same thing was going on in 
california and all over the northeast. a lot of information sharing was 
going on in this subculture's subculture. 'netravers' or 'cybertribe' is 
what we called ourselves.

at the same time that brian started the sfraves mailing list, he was able 
to make available an anonymous ftp space where would put various files 
related to the scene. this was at soda.berkeley.edu and later 
haas.berkeley.edu. it contained the sfraves list archives, gifs of various 
people on the list, drug information, flyers, and other interesting text 
files about raving. he (i think it was him) also set up gary grossman's 
telnet-based 'unix-cb' chat server, and dubbed it 'vrave' -- the virtual 
rave.

this was the beginning of hyperreal. early-mid 1992.

in one sense it was this tangible, static thing, a deliberately assembled 
collection of information about raves, music and drugs. there were very 
few places online where this kind of subject matter could be found, so it 
was very important. in another sense, especially through the mailing list, 
it was something less tangible; it was active service for a certain small 
segment of a relatively small community of people. it was simultaneously 
providing services for and more importantly, helping build and strengthen 
that community. it was a conduit, a filter, and a magnet for information 
centered around certain memes.

in 1993, berkeley wanted their machines back, so everything moved to 
sfraves.stanford.edu, aka techno.stanford.edu, thanks to someone at 
stanford who was into the scene and donated the facilities. it was there 
that brian was able to give out accounts to some friends and add more 
non-sfraves specific content like audio files (30 second .au-format 
clips), discographies, etc.

among the new contributors were people who improved the vrave code, 
including brian's new long-distance girlfriend, laura la gassa, one of the 
ne-ravers whose hoboken, nj apartment had hosted more than a few pre- and 
post- rave netraver gatherings. laura and brian met on vrave in april 
1993. laura moved to san francisco in 1994 and they eventually wed in 
september 1995.

also getting an account was lamont granquist, a university of washington 
student who was building up a collection of faqs and informative posts 
that were coming across the alt.drugs newsgroup at the time. this was 
before there was a rec.drugs hierarchy. lamont started a massive archive 
of recreational drug information, much of it anecdotal but with some 
scholarly references too. this part of hyperreal was and continues to be 
very popular.

brian gave me an account, too. i was on about a dozen mailing lists (you 
could do that back then; there wasn't that much traffic) and i read every 
post on the newsgroups. i wanted to archive as much information as i 
could, especially discographies and music reviews that people would post, 
and i wanted to reorganize what brian had already collected. i focused on 
the music but helped with everything. aside from the music related files i 
also had an archive of image & audio conversion and eye candy software.

there were a handful of others helping with other rave, drug and music 
related sections. we had archives for several regional rave lists, and 
there were accounts associated with those. the idm mailing list started in 
1994 on techno.stanford. rob campanell was producing a techno video show 
for the u network (a syndicated college tv network), and he had various 
files up related to that. there were sections on nootropics and smart 
drinks. and there were some e-zines that people had put together that we 
were archiving.

brian set up a gopher server on techno.stanford. this opened up a whole 
new world of possibilities. gopher is dead now, but at the time, it was a 
great interface. rather than just opening up a filesystem and letting 
people wander around and having to view README and 00-INDEX.TXT files to 
see what they were looking at, one could selectively index the filesystem, 
causing nice navigable menus to appear in people's gopher clients. as i 
got more familiar with the server's capabilities, we started adding text 
around the menus, and when i got a hold of mosaic, i found out that the 
gopher server we were using (john franks' gn) also had http service. if 
you gauge hyperreal's entry onto the 'web' as being the day the archive 
started http service, then it was sometime in 1993.

this archive didn't really have a name. it was just 'the ftp server at 
soda.berkeley.edu' or 'brian behlendorf's techno/rave archive' for the 
longest time. when i got into configuring the gopher server and setting up 
all the indexes, i registered the site in some central directory as 'the 
techno and rave resources at techno.stanford.edu'.

in the fall of 1993, while still attending berkeley, brian started working 
at wired magazine, where he set up www.wired.com, with articles from back 
issues of the magazine and other fun stuff. that was one of the first 
non-academic/research web sites online. a quote he gave me when he was at 
wired: "the people who run this company know a lot about magazines and 
nothing about about the internet."

in 1994 things really started taking off with the web. isps were starting 
to offer affordable internet access to the general public en masse. the 
consumer networks got connected to the net. it was disconcerting in some 
ways but it was my first inkling that something bigger was going on. i was 
still downplaying it, content to just help take care of the archives, but 
brian was all over it, co-leading the apache web server project, 
predicting (accurately) things to come, evangelizing, prophesizing, 
espousing terms like community building and collaborative filtering.

in july of 1994, brian bought his own pc so he could move all the content 
off of the stanford site and have more control over the servers. it was 
also simultaneously a home for a new project he was involved in: a set of 
patches for the ncsa http server ('a patchy web server' ...get it?)

the pc, a pentium 90, went under his desk at wired, was hooked up to their 
lan and was given a public ip address. he chose a domain name for it in 
honor one of his favorite techno tracks at the time: 'hyperreal' by the 
shamen. (specifically, the jack dangers remix of that song). the machine 
name, taz, was a reference to hakim bey's entry on every cyberpunk's 
essential reading list: 'T.A.Z. - the Temporary Autonomous Zone, 
Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism'.

brian wanted hyperreal to be a place where all the people who were 
contributing could have free reign over their projects, and for it to be a 
home for these projects that people couldn't put elsewhere. the subject 
matter had to meet with his approval, of course, but that just meant that 
it had to have something to do with raves, electronic music, and altered 
states of consciousness. another rule was that there could not be any 
banner ads or commercial activity on the site. this was partly due to the 
fact that wired didn't want other people using its network for commercial 
activity, but also because we just didn't want it. netscape had turned the 
web browser into a billboard, and for all the ways that was good in 
fueling the growth of the web, it was also obviously not something that we 
wanted hyperreal to be dependent upon.

said brian for a yahoo! internet life article,

     "What I was always into building was platforms - places where people 
can get together and build web sites about anything that they typically 
wouldn't be able to, and not have to worry as much about the boring tech 
side of things. Now, these days, anyone can set up a web page at Geocities 
or a mailing list at OneList, but Hyperreal continues to be a big 'group 
publishing experiment'. The purpose has evolved, but it's still about 
giving people a platform to speak from, to show off, to organize, and to 
inform, without having to worry about banner ads or other forms of 
corporate infiltration. We'll stay true to our roots until we're forced 
off the air.

     [...]

     People don't really need free web space or free lists anymore, so 
actually it's been easier to focus on supporting the really unique content 
or ideas that people want to sponsor. Just as it was in '94, the mission 
continues to be to create a reference site for this community, and I think 
we're doing that pretty well."

this volunteer-based approach has of course had its downside. projects are 
often started and then abandoned in a half-finished state. content gets 
stale because people have personal lives to get on with. it's not so much 
a community as it is a loosely organized carnival of sorts, a bunch of 
side shows competing for attention. brian and i and various graphic 
designers have made a number of attempts over the years to reign in the 
content as all being 'part of hyperreal', creating centralized indexes to 
lead visitors to the individual projects, but we've gone about as far as 
we can with this approach. the nature of the web is changing. everybody 
has their own domain name. there is no need to distinguish between 
resources just based on where they are hosted. hyperreal is not supposed 
to be about hording information. it's hard, though, because people want to 
go to 'hyperreal the web site' and can't really handle finding 'hyperreal 
the arbitrary collection of commonly-themed volunteer-run projects'. and 
it is becoming ever more arbitrary all the time.

back to the story. brian set up hotwired.com in the fall of 1994. it was 
the first ad-supported web site, and also the first user-based web site. 
around this time he dropped out of college. he went on to cofound the web 
presence / e-marketing provider organic online in san francisco, 
eventually settling in as cto of that company until leaving to start 
o'reilly's collab.net in 1998. all along, he was involved in the apache 
project, mainly as a facilitator and as a sysadmin for the project's home 
server, which was, as i mentioned, actually taz.hyperreal.org.

although hyperreal appears very stagnant, people and their projects 
quietly come and go all the time. the indexes to the web-accessible 
content are sporadically updated projects, themselves. lamont abandoned 
the drug archives after a couple years of inactivity and allowed its 
content to be merged into the erowid.org site, which we had been quietly 
hosting all along. some projects like they eye candy were retired 
semi-permanently, others like the music reviews and automated rave 
calendar are just on ice for a while. vrave had to be taken down due to 
abuse in 1998, but it might come back again someday. new projects are 
getting off the ground and others are collecting dust. everything is in 
motion, and there's always something new. it just isn't highly polished 
and could still stand to be better organized. says brian,

     "Very few other sites are as volunteer-focused as ours; most rely on 
some form of revenue, even if it's just ad banners. But even ad banners 
can really get in the way of trying to make a message. I think the most 
important thing is that we don't really care about being the #1 site for 
this or that - we just want to put out the truth, as we see it.

     Hyperreal, all told, is pretty big, as archives go, though it could 
certainly be formatted much more nicely, we admit. It's a lot like a city 
- some central planning, but most of the character comes from serendipity, 
finding the cool stuff amidst the mass of just so-so stuff. And hey, if 
you don't like a certain section, and want to help, just speak up!"

i would add that lots of people speak up, but there's not a lot of 
follow-through :) i should also mention that in addition to brian and 
myself and all the other volunteers, helping behind the scenes have been 
several people like andrew bennett and eric mccormick, whose contributions 
have been invaluable.

the rest of hyperreal's history from 1994 to the present has been pretty 
much the same story. brian contributes the hardware, the bandwidth, the 
vision, the mission, and he executes & delegates the primary sysadmin 
duties. other volunteers bring in their own projects -- web sites, mailing 
lists or whatever -- and some occasionally make donations, at their 
expense, toward hardware upgrades. hyperreal is currently a pair of boxes 
sitting in a rack space at a major backbone provider in san jose. who 
knows what it will be, physically, or virtually, next year. there is very 
little expense involved with running hyperreal, other than time, and no 
financial income associated with it.

in the mean time, the internet has gone mainstream, raves have gone 
mainstream, we're all working i.t. jobs or have started our own technology 
and design companies, and we've somehow become 'old school' in more ways 
than one. through it all, we are, each of the volunteers individually, 
dedicated to certain ideas and ideals that are compatible with each other 
to some degree, and this compatible commitment and enthusiasm manifest as 
the projects that are collectively known as hyperreal. hyperreal, or 
something like it, is the natural result of human interaction, and it will 
continue to exist in some form or another for quite some time to come.

Technical English

Hold on there, kids! Here's a handy idiot's guide to help you 
navigate the niggling nuances of electronic music lingo


Everyone knows that electronic music jargon is blatantly ridiculous 
and impossible to understand. Admit it, we all have to pretend to 
know what the next big thing is talking about when we hear, "I 
thought that knarzy rockno was the deepest shit when I heard it last 
November, but now it sounds just like IDM from '99 played at 120 
BPMs."

What's that shit really mean, you ask? Well, here's the translation: 
"That German stuff that sounded so good last year now sounds like old 
progressive rock played too fast."

Part of the reason for this glossary is to demystify and clarify some 
of the insidery language of electronica. A few definitions are 
obvious and quite literal, while others are, well, totally fucked up. 
But that's part of the fun. Remember, this is a "music culture" meant 
to be experienced and not necessarily understood. So chill and enjoy 
this alphabetized glossary that any beat-soused musical tourist or 
burb-dwelling, beer-slurping sports fan can use. Just clip out and 
save.


Abstract: Music that contains layers of sounds and beats so erratic 
that shaking ass cheeks to it might be impossible. But you can try. 
This is an umbrella term under which a number of different styles 
(see "ambient," "broken beat" and "IDM" below) can be contained.

Acid: A complex word that's rooted in layers of slang. In terms of 
dance culture, it began not with LSD research studies in the 1950s 
and Timothy Learyisms of the 1960s, but with a way that club-dazed 
Brits needed to define the far-out sounds of Chicago in the mid-'80s. 
In short: Acid was the sound of suburban American rave culture in the 
early 1990s.

Ambient:Music with no beats or minimal beats. Gigantic whooshes of 
sound or practically no sound at all. Perfect music as a backdrop for 
thinking, feeling, schtupping, spliffing, reading or doing nothing.

Bass: In Detroit, bass historically refers to the music created by 
'80s Miami-based stars like 2 Live Crew, who provided the 
woofer-destroying building blocks (and, you'll note, fetching 
derriere imagery) for Detroit's street-friendly dance scene. People 
new to the sonic energy of electronic dance music are often put off 
by the crunchiness and distortion of the bass. Either you wrap your 
mind and your ass around it, or you don't.

Booty: Also known as ghetto-tech or ghetto-funk. A Detroit invention 
that combines elements of house, techno, bass, hip hop and electro 
with glorious strip club inelegance. A musical genre keen-eyed on 
asses of Detroit women. Pure, politically incorrect joy that the 
Dutch, French and Germans have a better intuition for than most 
uptight Americans.

Broken beat: It's simple: Imagine hip-hop beats falling down stairs. 
It's been the sound of Detroit's Woodbridge neighborhood for the last 
five years.

BPM: Beats Per Minute. Also: how fast your heart races when you're 
slamming on the dance floor.

DEMF: Detroit Electronic Music Festival, 2000-2002. The name of the 
festival for the first three years under the direction of Carol 
Marvin and (for the first two years) artistic director Carl Craig. 
The third year, though mired in scene drama, was planned by a strong 
committee of longtime Detroit producers and DJs.

Disco: When you hear this often-maligned genre during the festival, 
it won't be the Bee Gees. It'll more likely be a track like "You Make 
Me Feel (Mighty Real)" from the late black transvestite vocalist 
Sylvester, or extended jams by Motown's Ashford and Simpson. It's 
stuff that really made the "disco sucks" rock fascists nervous.

DJ: The disc jockey as selector, the person who chooses what record 
comes next, and sets the emotional temperature of the club space. DJs 
are, for better or for worse, the kings and queens of the scene.

Downtempo: Slowing the music down to normal breathing levels. Sexier 
than dancing to head-hammering techno. Chilling it down without 
getting all ambient.

Drum 'n' bass:Like the sound of a roaring freight train, often with 
what appears to be chaotic snare and bass drum programming and 
sampled or live vocals. Fans of D 'n' B are devoted, and spread out 
all over the planet. Large scenes still flourish in parts of the 
United States and Europe.

East Grand: As in The Boulevard. Home to the world's most famed 
techno emporium, Submerge Records.

East Side: Roughly, Detroit east of Woodward Avenue. Home of the 
rave-converted Packard Plant and seemingly every other abandoned 
factory in Detroit. Musically, the East Side is considered to be the 
home of electro lovers (see below). No, we're not talking Clinton 
Township or Lakeside Mall here.

Electro: The itchy, twitchy electrical outlet of dance music, filled 
with sounds pioneered in the early '80s by such groups as Kraftwerk 
and Cybotron. A versatile style: Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys and 
the Human League are electro; so are Detroit's Adult., Ectomorph and 
booty DJs like Assault and Godfather.

Fuse-In: Part metaphor, part contractual obligation, the name merely 
extends the six-year melodrama more commonly known as "The Festival."

Hip hop: At the beginning of Detroit's techno culture in the early 
'80s, hip hop was just one sound among many (electro, progressive, 
funk, disco, new wave) that could be used to turn a party out. Twenty 
years later, the difference in the various speeds of the styles and 
differences of culture may seem too significant to overcome. But just 
watch the Fuse-In crowd find common ground when Mos Def hits the 
stage.

House: The sound of Chicago, the heartbeat of New York, the call of 
the urban diva: a clear influence on Detroit techno and variations on 
electronic dance music developed in Europe. House is an outgrowth of 
disco; you can hear the syncopated beats and gorgeous melodic 
structures nurtured in the 1970s in almost every track. And its 
variation, deep house: House music built on smoother, rounder melodic 
tones and a less frenetic pace than its source.

IDM: Intelligent Dance Music. Rarely on the beat and less pop than 
the sounds your refrigerator makes, IDM is the elitist cousin of 
techno that makes for difficult dancing but far easier chin 
scratching.

Ital-Disco: A combination of acid house, techno and electro developed 
in Italy 25 years ago, and for years a part of DJ sets by Derrick 
May, Carl Craig and Stacey Pullen.

Jefferson Avenue: The street to bang on in the summer on the way to 
Belle Isle. The corner of East Grand Boulevard and Jefferson was the 
site of the, er, fuse that lit the 1943 riots, but now is home to a 
Starbucks financed by Magic Johnson. Mythologized by DJ Assault as 
the nasty-ass strip where you go to see "ass 'n' titties" bounce.

Knarz: Crazy, Germanized techno that improbably combines elements of 
rock music and the baroque. The sound is dark and druggy, and works 
best in the basement of a factory between 4 a.m. and sunrise. Best 
practitioner scheduled for Fuse-In: Berliner Peter Grummich (who also 
records for Ann Arbor's Spectral Sounds).

Minimal: Stripping dance music down to bare essentials. It could be 
house or techno played fast or slow, intended for the club or for 
listening on headphones. See UK-based Web site ubercoolische.com for 
a cheeky soap opera starring main practitioners Richie Hawtin, Magda 
and Ricardo Villalobos.

Movement: The name of the festival for years four and five, run by 
Derrick May and his Transmat record label. Though powerful and 
exciting at times, the most lasting image is of May tooling around in 
a golf cart with a bucket begging for money.

MusicoLogical: The name of Kevin Saunderson's new production company. 
He says it's a combination of reason and sound. We say, as we're sure 
you do, "Huh?"

Producer: Another name for an artist who makes music, producing 
tracks with analog equipment or digitally with computer software. Not 
all producers of electronic music are DJs and many DJs are not 
producers. Both producers and DJs rarely play "live" (that is, create 
new music as they're performing) thereby making many of Fuse-In's 
live acts special enough not to be missed.

Rockno: A combo style that fuses rock, techno, electro and other 
influences. Who does it? See Pan/Tone, who is not on the festival 
lineup but will play one of the many afterparties (see afterparty 
rundown, online only at www.metrotimes.com).

Tha D: Detroit, Big D, Motown, The Motor City, Techno City, 
Technopolis. Got it?

The shit: An ear-bending musical experience so unimpeachable that 
true descriptive words escape you.

Techno: Beats played in 4/4 time. Melodies that sound like they were 
created in outer space. The music can come in wildly different 
variations, and be remixed into infinity. The sound that the entire 
world associates with Detroit.

Trance: The sound most reviled and snubbed by Detroit techno purists. 
It's considered too commercial and far too stylized for many hardcore 
technophiles. But the sound is creeping into European techno and 
house records, and goddamn if it doesn't sound good when used for 
escapist purposes. The Brits and Germans are calling this development 
acid-trance or neo-trance.

West side: Detroit's neighborhoods west of Woodward. Home of Buy-Rite 
records and all of those boojie blacks who "invented" techno. Not 
Canton Township or Novi. No way, mister.

Subject: [sfraves] SFRaves BBQ 

Who here is interested in planning a BBQ for SFRaves ?

BBQS are easy to organize, cheap on the funds/cost, can be hosted in a park or 
in someone's Backyard, can be all ages, and can have music.

This is an opportunity for us to join together in person and get to know one 
another.

Any takers?

Summer's here... Perfect for an indoor / outdoor by day or night with 
other delights. The sfr party is still in the works - let's do it :)
Question is, where, how many, what kind of parties do you want to throw?

If this is regarding the SFRaves 13 Year Anniversary or beyond - 
There's a planning list for that discussion: To subscribe Email

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A History of Hyperreal and the Beginning of SFRaves

hey, I kinda complained about this already on LJ, but:

..........at the time, the only
..........raves in the usa were in l.a., san francisco, and new york.

that is like extremely false. what about Chicago? what about Detroit?
Chicago and Detroit didn't have any raves in the late 80s and early
90s? I think they did, actually.

sometimes it kinda rubs you the wrong way how you can invent shit
elsewhere in the country only to find out years later that somebody in
San Francisco thinks they're the only reason you've even heard of it.
:-P

(not that I invented anything myself, but you know what I mean. I hope!)

     I thought thats what this scene is for.  No need to swear and curse at someone because they made a comment about your comment on a certain persons looks.  If you thought she was hot you should of kept it to yourself. It's not like your going to be moving to New York or something to be with her anyway.  You didn't even really talk to her.  Your written opinion of this particular female seemed broad and biased.  It, however, is your opinion like this is mine, if you comment on it, I am not going to reply to the whole group showing what a asshole I can be because I didn't like your moral.  The point is SHUT UP ABOUT IT.  This group is about the Love, Peace, and mostly the Music.  If I am wrong here, let me know so I can leave.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Peace, Love, And Music

Reid actually lives in LA now.  I know, because I actually did have a
long conversation with her on Saturday.  And she IS a good DJ.  She
mixes fast and clean.  Even after a drink spilled all over her record
bag and she was obviously not happy about that (who would be?) and the
monitor cut out for a few minutes,  she didn't miss a beat and
continued to rock the house.  I think it's also apparent that lots of
people find her attractive, including her boyfriend who accompanied
her this weekend.  We hope to work together to bring some solid breaks
talent out to the west coast.

I think the list is pretty open to all kinds of conversation and
comments.  Including comments about Giles gargantuan penis and
Andrew's distaste for music labeled as "euro."  As long as there's
some kind of balance, we should be alright.  Right?

Yay for sfraves!  6 years on the list and I'm still not totally
disgusted with you people!  I <3 you all!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfr party

I enjoy good trance in small doses.  It's not really my thing so much, but
good music is good music and I understand how some people can get really
into it.  Back when I started DJing I bought both house and acid/psy/goa
trance, but house took over pretty quickly for me, I just felt it more.  I
spun an oldschool/acid set at one of the alter ego parties thrown by
people on this list a few years ago, even have some old breaks and jungle
records sitting around I used to fiddle with. Bad trance is just some of
the most painful music on earth for me, that's all.

HAHAHAHA i remember that party it was the AEC party that ryan put
together for my 25th b-day.  I remember you being there and i remember
seeing you on the decks but for the life of me i couldnt remember what
the hell you played or even how good it was.  Judging by your house
mixing skills i can only assume it sucked ass, but thatnkfully i was
drunk enough to not remember so i think i had a good time.

Yeah you're good at that.  Crazy night out in the field in the

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Fri)

well, another week has flown by in the delta quadrant.  it seems like just
yesterday that dianne feinstein was the mayor of san francisco and was
talking about overhauling the cable car system.  remember that?

perhaps you remember (or were at) the 50th anniversary of the golden gate
bridge, when so many people piled on the bridge it created a human
gridlock and they thought the bridge might collapse.

if not that, perhaps you remember earth day 1990 in the marina.  devo got
rained out?

and, of course, everyone remembers october 17, 1989, 5:04 PM.

where were you?

--

At the pre-emptory request of a large majority of the citizens of these
United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope,
and now for the past nine years and ten months of San Francisco,
California, declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U.S., and in
virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct
the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in
the Musical Hall of this city on the 1st day of February next, then and
there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may
ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring, and thereby
cause confidence to exist, both at home and abroad, in our stability and
integrity.


- Letter to the editors of various newspapers by Joshua A. Norton,
September 17, 1859

Subject: [sfraves] Re: The Big (and Small) Ones - Was: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the
 Day (Fri)

On October 17, 1989, 5:04 PM I was in my bedroom - first the Quake sounded 
like thunder, then it packed the punch and I headed for the doorway's 
awning, only to hear glass shatter everywhere. Later I saw the A's game 
footage on the news, coupled with the Embarcadero Freeway collapse, the 
Bay Bridge car fall/collapse; among countless other things. Loma Prieta 
kicked butt. Checking the usgs.gov site @ for the probability of an 
earthquake hitting us locally - the data comes from SC / EC: NSF + USGS 
center http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/step/

SF is in between the 1/10000 and 1/100000 range

Here are some of the recent events in Northern CA (there are 50 of them)

   Recent Earthquake Activity in the USA

1) 
Magnitude 1.0 - SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CALIFORNIA

The magnitude 1.0 event has been located in the SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, 
CALIFORNIA. The hypocentral depth was estimated to be 3 km ( 2 miles). 
(This is a computer-generated message -- this event has not yet been

2005 May 22 13:42:19 UTC

heh

Have a good one

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A History of Hyperreal and the Beginning of SFRaves

My 1st rave was in '92 in DC, and before that I was going to rave events at 
clubs in Baltimore, and there was definately rave-like music being played in 
DC in the late 80's already, so whoever said that shit is a knucklehead.

I've always luvved psy. :-) But you're not the only one sad about the
Top, I saw Mike Bee today -- he used to run a nice dolphin jungle
night there, and made a damn nice dolphin jungle record at around the
same time -- and while he wasn't actually crying about it, per se, he
definitely wasn't thrilled about it either.

Fun times, though. I have awesome pics from that party, including Michael  
sporting the red stickman outfit one last time, dancing on top of the tractor. :

The film industry: Technologically challenged

Posted: May 28, 2005 1:00 a.m. Eastern

(c) 2005 WorldNetDaily.com

Wednesday night, May 18, I was sitting in line at a
theater in Dallas, Texas, reading a book. Like
thousands of people around the country, I was waiting
for the latest, and of course the last, Star Wars
episode, "Revenge of the Sith." I have to say it's
amusing to see diehard sci-fi geeks having light-saber
duels in the middle of a theater.
=20
As I and others waited in line for the midnight
showing, a group named "ViSA" uploaded a leaked version
of Star Wars III to newsgroups earlier that day. The
film was soon copied countless times and spread across
the net on peer-to-peer networks. It's everywhere. So
widespread on the Net this film and others like it have
become that you could close your browser now, get on
IRC, a BitTorrent client, or a P2P client like KaZaA,
and download it almost immediately.
=20
Needless to say, the Motion Picture Association of
America isn't too pleased. As much as you hear about
the Recording Industry Association of America suing
file- sharers for freeloading copyrighted music, you
hear about the MPAA getting servers shut down and legal
action taken against facilitators of copyright
infringement. Of course, this really isn't new. Both
industries declared war on so-called "piracy" long ago,
and Internet "piracy" came to the forefront of the
national debate nearly six years ago when Napster
became widespread.
=20
Yet, like the culture war, the war of the copyright has
waged on, and the MPAA is doing all it can to stop
release groups like "ViSA" from uploading copies to the
Internet. Capitalizing on the hyped release of Star
Wars III, MPAA President Dan Glickman stated in a press
release:
=20
   There is no better example of how theft dims the
   magic of the movies for everyone than this report
   today regarding BitTorrent providing users with
   illegal copies of "Revenge of the Sith." The
   unfortunate fact is this type of theft happens on a
   regular basis on peer-to-peer networks all over the
   world.  Fans have been lined up for days to see
   "Revenge of the Sith." To preserve the quality of
   movies for fans like these and so many others, we
   must stop these Internet thieves from illegally
   trading valuable copyrighted materials online.
=20
There are a lot of things about this type of rhetoric
that bother me and should bother you as well. This sort
of talk from special-interest groups causes politicians
to pass invasive and messy legislation like the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. Organizations like the MPAA
have declared war on some of greatest fans of
filmmaking; they stifle creativity; and their campaigns
have left a lot of collateral damage. I'm not claiming
that copyright infringement is legally or even
ethically OK, but the reality is the distribution model
of major studios has barely changed since its
inception, and it seems to have left consumers wanting.
=20
Specifically, Dan Glickman is wrong in the way he
characterizes BitTorrent. According to his own words,
BitTorrent is responsible for providing users with
illegal copies of films. However, BitTorrent is merely
a client that when given instructions through a
.torrent file, connects multiple IP addresses to one
another so that each computer can share random
fragments of a file which are then reassembled on each
receiving computer. In other words, a protocol can't be
illegal. As I type these words, I'm downloading a
relatively large file through BitTorrent that is
perfectly legal. However, according to Dan Glickman,
BitTorrent should be shutdown completely. It's like
shutting down the United States Postal Service for
distributing anthrax.
=20
This isn't some sort of isolated nitpicking either.
Since the beginning of the copyright war on the
Internet, the recording and movie industries have used
a destructive shotgun approach to fighting the
infringers. We're in an age of mass media and
information distribution, but unfortunately the MPAA
continues to fight the tide instead of offering a
viable alternative that takes advantage of new
technology.

- glowstick lightshow
- grate music (although i don't remember any of it)
- glowstick lightshow
- binary finary!!
- glowstick lightshow
- having to pee a lot
- glowstick lightshow
- glowstick lightshow
- glowstick lightshow
- snuck in the backside of the house so not to wake mom and dad

good times, good times!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfr party

I don't think stacey will forget that evening when Tyler body slammed
her into the pavement. Tyler was shiiiit faced for that AEC party. Too
bad it was so foggy that night. The first AEC party with the tractor
was the shit. Nothing beats scooter making out with a girl in the
tractor cab for ours and stickman passing out on top of his car and
denting the thing.

Pictures from the first outdoor...

Such good times. I need to introduce Poland to outdoor parties. The
concept is foreign to them and I have a whole summer in Krakow to do
it.

Oh - bla bla bla update... Working in Krakow getting a new bar//club
underneath Nathan's Villa Hostel open and running smoothly this
summer. Under construction with a completion date of the end of June.
Anyone that's out traveling this summer and cruises through Krakow -
find me there//stay in the hostel. Best one in Krakow! Other than that
I'm all over the place when I have free time and doing contract work.
If not that I'm out partying in their clubs which are fucking amazing.
Oh yeah and they're FREE. Good house//electro scene.

cheers...

Subject: [sfraves] On-line record stores - House

Hi. I'm looking for on-line record stores that
specialize in deep, electro, tech, and tribal house.
I'm already familiar with dancerecords.com and
satellite.  Any other kickass places on-line with good
shipping rates and turnover time?
Thanks for any help; much appreciated.


Amanda.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: An Epiphany of Sound tomorrow (Wed) from 9a-noon

We've got an interesting show planned for you tomorrow.  We'll begin
with an interview of the author/editor of Light And Liberty, a
collection of writings from Thomas Jefferson.  Then we'll be bringing
back Koroma and JJ Islas.  Koroma will be celebrating the release of his
new CD "Written Between the Lines".  So listen in and work up a sweat.

90.1 FM in the bay area, and online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal
to true happiness.
