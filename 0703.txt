SAMMY DEE  (of Pantytec, Schneider & Radecki, Half Hawaii)

With a career in electronic music spanning nearly two decades, Sammy Dee
(aka Mario Radecki) has built and solidified a reputation for himself as an
innovator of eclectic, off kilter sounds. He began to DJ in Kassel in the
late eighties, soon after returning to his hometown of Berlin, hosting
residencies at Tresor and Ostgut. A particular night, which made Ostgut's
Panorama bar famous, is Get Perlonized, one of the most consistently
successful club nights in Europe.  Along with co-organizer, Pantytec
production partner and Perlon label founder Zip, they put together a
showcase for the unique sounds of Perlon that would unknowingly influence
many worldwide. Complementing Zip, Sammy's unique sets of minimal house and
techno have always proved to be one of the foundations of the night.  When
Sammy is on the decks there is no doubt why he is recognized as one of the
key veterans and icons of the electronic music scene. Currently on the
production side, both a new solo project and a collaboration with Bruno
Pronsato are crystallizing. A departure from his co-productions with Zip,
Guido Schneider, and Baby Ford, you will just have to keep your ears tuned.

ALEX UNDER (aka Friendly People, Dolly La Parton, of Musica Charlista)

The deepest meaning of 'collage', defined by Max Ernst, is the general
application of Arthur Rimabaud's 'delirium': "I accustomed myself to simple
hallucination; I saw quite deliberately a mosque instead of a factory, a
drummer's school conducted byangels, carriages on the highways of the sky, =
a
salon at the bottom of a lake: monsters, mysteries, a vaudeville poster
raising horrors before my eyes."  We could describe collage as an alchemic
compound of two or more heterogeneous elements, derivate by their unexpecte=
d
approximation generated deliberately by the search of systematic confusion
and distorted perception.

That's Alex Under's musical universe. Based in Madrid, this producer is the
'CMYK' label manager. He is also one of the men behind 'Apnea' and
'Bemysheep', and one of the founders of Net28 (the net behind these labels
and others like 'CyclicalTracks' and 'Pulpa'). Alex Under confirmed himself
as the new reality of the best international techno, sometimes being minima=
l
and deep, sometimes hard and aggressive, but always original. He creates a
sonic collage combining techno, trance and house elements while he
constructs complex rhythms that arise from the dancefloor, taking the
listeners to a higher level where emotions, depth, mind & body blend in a
unique equation. Alex Under will intrigue beyond your perception.

Subject: [sfraves] Free couch plus chairs

Throwin it out here before craigslist-

In downtown SJ
One sofa plus 1 matching recliner, plus one non-matching recliner.
Each end of the sofa also reclines, and there's a fold-out console in  
the middle.
The sofa and matching chair are in decent shape- the brown chair has  
been hardly used.

Color swatches here- the couch and chair are off-white with bits of  
color.

The other chair is light brown:

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

I just wanted to state for the record that I shortened the title from  
Quote of the Day to QOD because it's just shorter and I figure it's  
easier to read.  One thing I hate is emails with too long of a subject  
line.  So now I just feel like a veritable spring chicken!  And I'm  
hosting Bueller's bachelor party tomorrow in my roach infested  
apartment.  Wish us luck!

Twenty-Seven year old Guy Hatfield is a man with a mission. Heralded as the 
new Breakbeat leader of the pack and the hardest workingman in the UK dance 
scene, he continues to turn heads and push boundaries to great acclaim.

Hypers pioneering Y3K compilation albums secured his name in the dance 
scene as one to watch and spawned many copycat Breakbeat albums. Guy went on 
to surpass expectations with his world-renowned Bedrock Breaks CDs and can 
lay claim to the biggest selling full price Breakbeat comps to date.

Hypers unique DJ sets, sliding between genres, have earned him the respect 
of fellow pioneers, Paul Oakenfold, John Digweed, Timo Maas and BT (who 
lists him as one of his favourite DJs). Through shear hard work and over 
the last few years Guy has also achieved one of his main aims in taking 
Breakbeat from a backroom stalwart to a main room attraction blowing away 
many larger (and higher paid) jocks worldwide who commit to a more limited 
sound.

He regularly is asked to guest mix on BBC Radio 1 for DJs Annie 
Nightingale, Seb Fontaine and Fergie. Hyper frequently tours Stateside where 
he is considered as one of the (if not THE) scenes leading lights. He is a 
popular and frequent guest at the US largest clubs Spundae and Buzz. All 
this activity and profile lead to Hyper being chosen as the support DJ for 
Breakbeats biggest band, The Crystal Method on tour in the USA in spring 
04.

In the studio Guy has been writing his much anticipated debut artist album. 
Recent releases on Timo Maas label 4:20 Recordings have proven a successful 
teaser of what1s to come. Guys production style contains the strong 
elements and main room crossover one has come to expect from his dance floor 
filling remixes. He has built on the notoriety of his mix (now a Breakbeat 
anthem) of 2001's biggest track 'Addicted To Bass', and other charting acts 
Filter and Joy Kitikonti. Hypers popular remix of Terminalhead was also 
chosen for a Radio 1 TV ad campaign.

Recently Guy has also collaborated with some of his favourite producers 
General Midi, Uberzone, Rui Da Silva and John Ross (one time production 
partner of both Sasha and BT), the results are groundbreaking.

Some genuinely great club remixes and productions have naturally attracted 
the attention of major labels and artist seeking to find a credible remixer 
for use on their artist forthcoming releases. Hyper first major label remix 
came for Pink Trouble and God Is A DJ, remixed to such a high standard 
that Pink herself has asked that he be considered for remix duty on all her 
future singles. Also this year Hyper has remixed Sugababes, Paul Van Dyk, 
Sarah McLauchlane, The Crystal Method and BT.

Hyper also runs his own successful breaks label Kilowatt. Artists signed to 
the label include Terminalhead, Stir Fry, Flatliners, General Midi, False 
Prophet and MobileGazer  singles available now.

The promotion company Waxworks he set up is still the biggest in Breaks 
after 7 years. Guy is also DJ Magazines specialist breakbeat reviewer.

Hyper is one of THE best technical DJs in Breakbeat, expect much more from 
him and expect your expectations to be surpassed.

For once, the Universe works out in my favor.

Pretty fucking awesome birthday present, if I do say myself, and I do.

This is even better than oil being discovered in Saudi Arabia on this

Subject: [sfraves] renting gear in Washington, D.C.?

Anyone have experience renting gear in Washington D.C. and have 
anyone to recommend?

Gear in this case is as defined two Technics 1200s and any
of the following (or similar):
Pioneer DJM-600 or better
Allen and Heath X-One 92 or better
Rane MP2016a/XP2016a

If they have lighting rental that's not crazy expensive or
consumes massive amounts of power, that would be helpful
too.

Thanks.

You might have better luck posting this question to dcraves.

http://hyperreal.org/raves/dc/

I'm pretty sure you won't have trouble finding what you need, though.

Yeah...it was all right.  MSTRKRFT opened though and hurt my ears.  One of
the worst sets of music I have ever experienced.  Just loud noise, no flow
at all...there were moments where it sounded like it would go off, but it
never did.  the vibe was ruined, Digweed was cool, but didn't go on until
1:30...I left around 2:30 though because I couldn't take the crowd anymore
(normally I don't care about those things, but for some reason, things were
just not right for me there).

OK ppl, a friend sent this to me. *I do not mean any harm by any of this* I thought it was hilarious and want to share it with you =)
   
  
 
        San Francisco    From Encyclopedia Dramatica  
         
The San Francisco skyline. Notice the unique archtecture people believe makes us targets for TERRORISM!


  San Fransico is famous for its gay and being the center of California's homosexual loving status. It's expensive, full of yuppies, goths, and wannabe artists. Burning Man started here, as if that were anything to be proud of. San Francisco also holds one of the largest LSD supplies. 
  It's pretty, but has the same problems as Los Angeles: nice exterior, but not much depth. At least the air is breathable. 
  San Francisco is home to the Golden Gate Bridge, which is the most popular bridge in the world. That is, if you want to jump off a bridge and kill yourself. Remember that when you're planning your next trip and/or suicide. If you want to see the most famous bridge in the world, you are on the wrong side of the country, as the Brooklyn Bridge is in New York. 
  [edit]
  Areas of San Francisco   San Francisco is usually somewhat over-extended to include the entire San Francisco Gay Area, which encompasses at least three distinct areas: 
  

San Francisco Proper: The city of San Francisco is culturally and artistically amazing, especially when you consider the small size of the city. This is probably due to all the gay there. Like any major urban area, the city is full of hipsters, but the ones in SF are especially annoying because they think because the city is artistic they must be too. Overall though, San Francisco is cultured and a nice place to hang out. Despite what hepkitten may tell you, Brisbane is not a part of San Francisco.          
In this park, you too can take this photo, just like in postcards! YAY!


  The South Bay: Roughly extending from Redwood City down to San Jose, the South Bay is a cultural wasteland and a large suburb to San Francisco. Except for the $1,000,000 you'll pay for a home, there's nothing to distinguish any of the South Bay from the suburbs of any other major city. Note that this area also includes what is sometimes referred to as the Peninsula, to some people, to others the Peninsula is a separate region. The Peninsula is most of San Mateo County. It extends roughly down to the area below Palo Alto. 
  The East Bay: Oakland and the surrounding area is much like San Francisco proper, except a bit more suburban, a bit cheaper, and with a bit more murder. Oakland is also the home of the Black Panthers. Berkeley is famous for being home to all the bitter liberals that have been pissed off since Nixon was elected. While Oakland is sometimes jealous of San Francisco, the East Bay has a surprising amount of arts, culture, and fun without ever having to cross the bridge to San Francisco. Also, the East Bay has a great view of beautiful San Francisco, while San Francisco has a view of Oakland. Also also, Beast in Pig Latin is East Bay, so it must be cool. 
  Fisherman's Wharf: The northern waterfront area of San Francisco from Ghirardelli Square or Van Ness Street, ass pirates descend from ships and rape young boys like Catholic priests. The villagers live in constant fear of the local pirate population. The intro video of ABC's Full House features Fisherman's Wharf, with scenes of Bob Faget. 
  The North Bay: Also known as Marin county, the richest per-capita county in America, or "utter shit." The North Bay is the only part of the Bay Area with no BART, primarily because they care more about property values and keeping out "undesirable influences" than the integrity of the community. The people who live in Marin are either ex-hippies with a lot of money (usually from real estate) who want to fuck over black people without having to deal with them, their entitled children, or (most recently) successful members of Generation X who are only seen in public pregnant, with a stroller, and a latte from Starbucks. Unless you're willing to put down $30 for a 75 minute folk show starting at 6:30, there's nothing to do within the county limits but crystal meth or psychosis. Every teenager who grew up in Marin wants to move to Europe. 
  The Coastside: To the south of San Francisco proper, even below South San Francisco, lies Pacifica. The coastside extends from there all the way down to an interesting hybrid hippie/hickville called Half Moon Bay. Don't be fooled though: the city of Half Moon Bay and all the little minor towns to the north of it are unbearably dull and the only decent thing to ever come from there was a fuckload of meth. Pacifica, which has a closer proximity to the actual city, is less dull and has more blacks. Actually, most KKK meetings have more blacks than Half Moon Bay does. 
  The Clubs: San Fransisco is notorious for the amount of titty-bars, and strip clubs that could be seen by just driving a couple city blocks. Most of them being ran by jews, attract many a thousand. In certain areas of "the city", such as the Castro District, California's asshole, as /b/ is the internet's asshole, there can be found many gay bars. These are usually peaceful, but make great targets for terrorism, or a public display of hatred.

Heh...  nope.  No white zombie mixes.  ;)

You're welcome!

Ya, that was me back there in the corner seeing what I could output.  We're 
gonna make sur eto have a sub next time.  The gal that hooked us up with 
sound wasn't expecting me to push the subsonic ranges.

First set was pretty much all power noize.  Lots of the new Terrorfakt with 
a little This Morn Omina thrown in (tribal noize).  Second set was more 
gothic, Skinny puppy stuff with Helium Vola and other stuff.

I don't write anything down or preplan much.  I sorta watch what mike is 
doing on stage and try to match it up with whatever comes to mind, thats' 
why the sudden flip to a little Lords of Acid.

I agree that MSTRKRFT was disappointing and technically flawed (they need to
learn to beatmatch).  Definitely killed the vibe somewhat, and the crowd
seemed like there were a good number of people there for MSTRKRFT that
didn't know what Digweed is about.

Digweed played dark and techy, the kind of set that really sucks you in.
The first two hours seemed deliberate, the last hour he went nuts on the
filters and effects and playing crazy stuff.  I loved every minute of it,
stayed until the end.  He dropped Saints & Sinners - Pushin Too Hard, the
new Valentino Kazyani remix of Nathan Fake - Outhouse, and Apollo 440 -
Liquid Cool as far as classics that I recognized.  Also some good stuff off
of his new Transitions CD and recent transitions sets.  All in all, maybe
not the most perfect Digweed night but the music still beat the pants off of
almost anything else (if you ignored mstrkrft).

I agree, typically the crowd at ruby is better after the bar closes.  But
everytime I go there, without fail, I have all sorts of creepy guys trying
to grab me from behind while I'm dancing and 'claim' me.  It just is
unpleasant.  I have had many wonderful experiences there though (such as
Sasha right after Thanksgiving).

For whatever reason, MSTRKRFT killed my roll...and by the time Digweed was
getting going, I just needed a break from it all.  I wish I could have stuck
it out, but when the vibe isn't right, I choose to leave so I don't drag
anybody down with me.  So, my friend Keith (DJ Deckard) invited a few over
to his and he played some yummy electro for us!

It was our first time at the location, so it was a bit crazy to get going, 
started late, etc.  In the end it worke dout great.  The lighting came 
through, made a few needed changes during the break.  Had two intense 40 
minute performances...   Lots of space at the location, which was a welcome 
change from teh usual hole in teh walls we've performed in.

Subject: [sfraves] WR: Danny's Going Away Shingdig Adventure

So I got to the City around like ummmm... 7:30ish & got off Civic Center/
8th street from BART & actually had this mondo pleasant & musical walk to
Transfer (Thanks to my ipod).. i fuckin' swear man.. i either felt like i
was in a music video or like well.. i practiced my model walk down the cat
walk a few times :)  Got to Transfer & slowly people started slowly
showing up.. HELLO 2DAY.. I swear man.. Heeeeella People from the Rave
Retirement Home came out to play!!  I swear man.. there were sooo many old
skool FnFers out & about!  Even Fuckin' Terrac, who disappeared last year,
showed up & was apparently visiting for the weekend 'cause fucker lives in
Oregan now & didn't tell anyone he moved!  But yeah.. it was Dope seeing
sooo many people & i swear man.. if it was a warehouse, lol, yeah... it
was just a Dope reunion!

Music was alright!!  It's started out w/ alota proggy house/ breaks to
some yummy Electro-ie kinda Grooves to "glitch"ie music to house... No
Techno :(  Oh Well!  But it was fun just dancing w/ everyone who was
there!!  I honestly spent alota time outside socializing & reconnecting w/
people!  Fave sets that night were definetly Mizz Calamity Jane's & DRC's
sets.. i swear man.. i was like hella drunk @ the beginning 'cause an old
Homie bought me strong drinks  & I swear I didn't see/ hear Forest Spin   
:(   There was oooh.. Nikita who closed was Dope too!! :)  Oh yeah..
Scotty Hampton (if some of you remember) came out to party!

So when Transfer closed, we all migrated to the old Cloud Factory house in
the Castro & partied somemore!!  We were there for like almost an hour
just kickin' it well, I ate like mini cup cakes, cheese, chips/ dip, &
oooh.. Pocky Sticks!!!  Actually.. there was like 2 unopened boxes that
the hostess bought for the party that no one touched & gave to me to take
home!!  I even met this Austrailian dude/ foreign exchange student who
lives there!  He was fun!!

Oh yeah... so like alota people who were @ Transfer like went home or
other events that night... so there was actually like 15-20 of us left...
so after we left the CF house, we went to check out that Jeno/ GArth
warehouse shindig in the Mission.. as soon as we got there, like from the
looks of what was outside, Limos, people dressed up like it was Sound
FActory, etc, yeah... total Froo Froo crowd.. someone in the crew spoke w/
the promoter 'cause we tried to get like group discount to get in, but
no... $20 each person.. so we said fuck it & left!!  I mean.. the music
did sound alright, but man... i was fiending sooooooooooo hard for more
breaks or some jungle & wasn't too much in the mood for more house tbh! 
Also, alota people in our Danny ontourage were broke like me (shut up), so
yeah, we tried thinking of other ways of free entertainment!

We almost went to End Up, but didn't... then we went to this Speak Easy in
the Mission as well, but that was closed.  So we ended up giong to someone
Dude's house in the the Haight & kicked it for like 2 hours i guess...
lol.. more people came & met up w/ us there...  LoL.. oh oh ohohoho h oh
oh wait.. the most fuckin' trippy part of the early morn...

So we were still in the Mission.. walkin' back from the closed speak easy
& this Limo was like coming down the rode... Danny flagged it down & w/in
15 mintues, we were on this hella early morning ride to the Haight in a
fuckin' Limo!!  Heeeeeeello 2Daaay!!  So fun!!!  Oh my gosh man.. that was
Awesome!!  It was totally mondo my 1st time in a Limo & it was perfect!!!

OK.... so it was around like 6:45 now & we all packed up & went to Shadow
Lounge for their Sunday Morning party!  Well.. it was interesting 'cause
like i mean... between 3 DJs who were like ummmm... totally tagging, I
only like 1 of the DJs who dropped proper yummy music for my traste that
early in the morning!!  I mean.. he totally got off on alota breaks &
electro & some proggy this n that when the other 2 DJs, while i was there,
only played like house.. lol

Ooh yeah... so i was talkin' to the bouncer & man... i swear.. i Love
talkin' to bouncers 'cause I found out alota stuff about the club he
normally bounces @ ummmm.. Clash or Flash or whatever.. but yeah... lol...
Hello 2Day... he told me alota Yummy tidbits about that vlub & Tommy Lee
who's a montly "resident" @ that club!  LoL.. all he does is stand behind
the DJ & throws his hands... LOLOLOLMAO!!!  Anywaze, yeah... the group was
now down to like 12 people & we all danced, laughed, lounged on the sofas,
drank, took pictures!!  I mean.. it was a really good way to like get up
the energy again to take bart home!!!

So around 15 past 8AM.. me & Scotty headed over to BART & went home!!  But
I'm tellin' ya man... it was a fucki'n FUN ASS NIGHT!!!  YAAAAY!!!

ok.. I promise to cath up on all my WRs & stuff this week!!  I know, I
know,.. i'm hella laggin'...

Love All U RaverS!

The venue was about 3 blocks from my house. In Santa Clara of all 
places?!? Especially in that particular area, who woulda thunkit?

I saw this thread too late, otherwise I would've checked it out. Nice to 
not have to travel to the city for something off-the-beaten path like 
this.

I liked the space.  Very versitle.  I thik the south bay peeps were in 
agreement with you about gettig a show in their area and not having to 
travel for 45 minutes each way.  Personally I hadn't been down south in a 
long time, and forgotten how nice the weather is.

For those on tribe...

you know, i took a break from star trek for like the past year and  
due to just traveling and stuff i missed most of the original airings  
of enterprise.  right now they're on scifi monday nights from 7-11.   
i like the show but i think they lost people by doing a prequel  
rather than continuing along another show either 24th century based  
or maybe even an anthology based series which i think would have been  
the best, that way you have different actors and situations.  plus  
captain kirk commanding the enterprise for 20 years with the same  
crew isn't realistic.  but there's some fun episodes and all in all  
it's a fun show.  check it out for sure.

Is anyone else getting hyped up about Star Trek XI? 
The whole Abrams/Kurtzman/Lindelof thing has me
thinking this might actually be a good movie!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [NRR] star trek (was: (nrr) QOD (Tue))

I'm a huge trekker, even formed the Star Trek Club back in HS (its still
going and now called the Sci-Fi club).

Yes ST XI should be interesting, hopefully they will do better than the
nextgen movies (my fav is still #6). It will be out by xmas08:

http://www.trektoday.com/news/270207_02.shtml

There are still casting rumors floating about (refer to link at the end of
the article) but if they are true it does worry me a bit.

Gary Sinise as Bones, Adrien Brody as Spock and Matt Damon as Kirk? The
first two arent so bad, but Matt Damon as Kirk? Yikes! That boy cant act his
way out of a nutsack! Oh wait, nor could Shatner...maybe it is a good match.

I was a big fan of Enterprise, the show was awesome around the third season
(like most of the other trek series). Was very sorry to see it go. Most
people would argue differently but DS9 is still my favorite series, go
Defiant!

change, inner inspiration, provide a platform for different artistic 
vehicles, cutting edge dance music, and high octane fun.

For our anniVersary party, we'll be bringing together all the elements that 
have flaVored our eVents over the years. An all out line up of local and 
international talent, fashion show of local designers pushing the future 
edge, a variety of performance and dance from members of the community, and 
lots of other goodies you won't want to miss!"

Last night I went to my local English-esque pub and had dinner.  I  
really like the pub thing, I probably drink too much but oh well.  I  
try to walk more for the exercise.  Finished watching my Star Trek  
episode that I fell asleep on last night, how dare me.  Then, TV OFF!   
I set my internet radio tuner (Real Player) to listen to Jeff Rense,  
how double dare me.  And I fell asleep and didn't consciously hear  
anything.  So last night I probably sleep walked to the nearest white  
supremacy meeting.  Part of me now wonders if I could somehow combine  
this all, the pub, the Star Trek, the evil white power radio shows,  
and maybe Colgate toothpaste would jump in and save the day somehow.   
I don't know, I'll maybe work on that.

I never turn off the TV.  It wards away evil spirits.

Hybrid is an amazing live show, I highly suggest checking this out if you
can even though it's at Ruby Skye.  I probably can't go because of friday
class, but I want to hear about it from someone!

recruit and vocalist Charlotte James along with the full band and special
guests.

psychedelia."

10th March '07 - Avalon, Los Angeles - www.avalonhollywood.com

14th March '07 - Gothic, Denver - www.gothictheatre.com
15th March '07 - 930 Club, D.C. - www.930.com

Hope to see you there,

Mike and Chris

It's only $10, and it's the all-live Hybrid - them, Pornos For Pyros 
members, Quivver (I think) on vox, etc.

Gonna be sick if you can go.

Yep. Talk to me. Back when Sasha was cutting edge...
Also check out his mix of Orbital's "Midnight" from

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Track of the Day and hello again...


Agreed - but during that tour he played "rock star" at Buzz in DC, making 
the promoters who booked him for a 2am set, and he waited till 4 or so 
before going on. Wouldn't leave his hotel room until "he felt like it". The 
only saving grace from that night was James Zabiela's set, which DESTROYED.

James Z is ten times better a DJ anyway, so it wasn't horrible - but if I 
ever see Mr.Sasha in public, I'll kickfuck his ass.

Desperately seeking this track.

I heard a track played by General Midi for a XMAS mix
on Ibreaks.co.uk that goes "...give people what they
want...give em what they need..." It's a wicked
nu-school breaks mix.
I have to find it.... anyone know what it's called or
who it's by, label anything?
Thanks you any help much appreciated!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Track of the Day

you know this track really stands the test of time, and i just  
realized this track passes the stand alone test (i just made that up  
what do all you hot wings think).

it always fools me, too, because i think it's another song.  when i  
hear epic, dope ass, whatever the hell you want to call it, tracks  
like this, it really lifts my spirits, helps me forget about personal/ 
world problems, or rather makes them all seem insignificant.

maybe if i had this one in my stack the other night at this bachelor  
party everyone wouldn't have made a bee line for the door.  egads.   
well please, keep em coming philip.

Oddly enough, nobody posted anything at all, on this past Sunday, so 
Happy belated 15th Birthday SFRaves! :-P

Now I don't feel so bad about only Osby acknowledging mine from the day 
before. :-D

BTW, I'm using Firefox and the archive unzipped instantly instead of 
having to go through the two/three step process that I've had to 
manually go through in the past, which means that it might be easier for 
google spiders to do their magic. Just thought I'd pass that one along.

PLUR, bitches,

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Catharsis on An Epiphany Of Sound Thur. morning

So, Catharsis will be dropping by KZSU Stanford radio this Thur., March 8th for 
the last half of Epiphany of Sound. Which means he plans on starting up at 
around 10:30am and going until noon.  Since the show starts at 9a, I'll start 
with either a live mix myself, or an appropriate pre-recorded mix.  (Time will 
tell.)

As for Catharsis, he's planning a fresh set of hard techno & hardcore.
He's also said he's barely had time to check out the new records, so I'm 
expecting that the universe will guide things on a really fun path.  (We all 
know how that energy flows!)

If you're in the SF Bay Area, you can tune into KZSU at 90.1 FM.  And if you 
can't tune in over the air for whatever reason, we're streaming at 
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu (may I suggest the AAC stream?? ;) )

Anyway, hope to have you listening tomorrow!

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: Aloha!!

so I made it out here to kona, on the big island.  I am loving it, except 
there are lots of roosters where i am. (pretty fucking annoying) Definately 
not the type of cock I was looking for :P
I wanted to say thanks to everyone who came to say goodbye last saturday.  I 
had a blast!
I hope you are all doing well.  I just realized I got here in time for the 
Kona BrewFestival and Rebirth, Ka Pilina, Hawaii's version of Burning 
Man...I think I am going to volunteer.  Why the hell not??
Be well everyone!!

Rebirth 2007 (an official Burning Man Regional event), is a 4 day 
interactive art festival in the jungles of Puna including a 20' phoenix, 
fire spinners, luau, performance, music, installations, and much more. Come 
prepared to camp for 4 days, express your creativity, and make connections. 
This event is a nonprofit gathering of artists, no one is making money, and

yourself here: regionals.burningman.com/netwo....html.

Tickets for Rebirth 2007 are $35 (100 available online and 100 are for sale

an outlet on an island near you) while supplies last. Discounts available 
for volunteers, artists, performers, and some low-income tickets, see 
website for details.

We are looking for volunteers to help the event run smoothly and there are a 
lot of different jobs we need to do. We really need the help of some 
passionate people, if you are interested in really helping out and 
participating by volunteering then go to our website for all of the details. 
We are also looking for groups to form themecamps to help make the event one 
of the brightest expressions of interactive art outside of Burning Man, see 
the site for more details. We are giving out at least $1,000 in art grants 
go to kapilina.org/kapilina/artgrants.html for all the info and an 
application. The art grant cycle is now open and closes March 15th.

I might actually be wrong on this one, but i always thought this was
Dupree's - Brass Disc, i have a DJ Dan mix with this track on it, and when i
started looking around for it, that's what i was told.  maybe that's why
i've had such a hard time finding what i was looking for.

this time, you are wrong.  This is definitely "Dr. Love"

Dan used to drop the vocal from "Brass Disk" ("tell the DJ to put the  
brass disk on...") over this track, so that's probably what you're  
hearing in the mix.

list or just make it available on request? I could make this a weekly  
thing, like every Wednesday I'll put up a list of all
the announced events coming up or something.....")

Roxanna Stieber (who drove a lot of us Santa Cruz posse up to  weekly  
raves)

Geoff White (the big guy who finessed so many encounters with the law  
and otherwise was a great Danger Ranger)

Robert Jesse (who passed out The Rhythm Society flyers and had  
special events, years before the St. John's Divine Rhythm Society  
that he helped found)

Michael Wertheim (and his great Twitch Remix series)

Chris Beaumont (of nutrient/smart  drug memories)

And others I got to know who were also shining parts of the scene:
Niels Mayer
Ovid Jacob
Jon Drukman
Jonathan Steuer
ulmo (Brad Allen)
Preston
Derek Chung

Then there are the mostly local DJs and music makers that I spotted  
in messages here:
DJ Spun
Harry Who?
Mr Tim
Jeno
Garth
Markie Mark
Thomas
Scott Hardkiss
Ernie Munson
Noel
Rick Preston

And those wonderful early '90s references in the scene:
Map points
Smart drinks/bars
Intellex and Renew-You
X
Anubis Warpus in Santa Cruz
BPM
word-of-mouth beach raves
the original Ameba and Hose Wares

And the parties:
ToonTown
Mr. Floppy's Funhouse
The Gathering
Rave Called Sharon
The upcoming Psychic TV party at the Townsend the coming November

Great  stuff!
Happy 15th all!
Will

Subject: New royalty threatens internet radio

You may have heard, but once again internet radio is facing huge additional
royalties for broadcasting music. These royalties are in addition to the
ones that we pay to ASCAP and BMI, and are a royalty that is only paid by
internet broadcasters. Over-the-air (AM/FM) broadcasters are explicitly
exempt from this royalty; it only applies to internet broadcasters and
subscription music services.

In the past, we paid royalties based on a percentage of our revenues, in our
case 10% of our revenue. But the new royalties don't allow that percentage
of revenue factor, and instead charge us for each song we play times the
number of people listening.  This works out to about $8 per average
concurrent listener per month.  In 2006, we averaged over 6000 average
concurrent listeners per month, and the royalties we will have to pay for
2006 is about $628,000, over 4 times the amount of money we brought in.

And these rates go up drastically each year, until 2010, where they
are 2.5times their initial rate: by then we will have to pay over $1
million
dollars a year in royalties if we want to stay on the air.

So you can see that this puts us in an impossible position. And to make it
even worse, the rates are retroactive to 2006.

It doesn't seem fair that a small radio service like SomaFM has to pay all
these additional royalties, when over-the-air stations who reach much larger
audiences are exempted from paying them.

If you are in the USA, we would appreciate it if you could sign this online
petition which will be presented to members of Congress.

It's important for us to let Congress know that independent internet radio
is about to be forced out of business.

We need to keep our existing "percentage of revenue" royalty rate structure,
or better yet, have Congress extend the exemption to internet radio stations
as well as terrestrial (over-the-air) stations.

       http://www.petitiononline.com/SIR2007r/petition.html

Thanks for all of your support for SomaFM in the past. We will do what we
need to do to keep SomaFM on the air and broadcasting.  We love you!

There are actually some drugs and substances that may increase mental
performance.  Piracetam is one of the most proven.  It is perscription
here in the US, but available in Mexico, or by mail order.  Another one
legal here is Argenine Pyroglutimate.  If you mix these with some other
brain-vitimans like DMAE and Choline, you can sort of feel an affect.  
Sort of like being more awake, but not like caffiene.  There is a multi-
vitamian called "Deep Thought" that is loaded with DMAE and other substances
that is qutie effective.

Very few "smart bars" actually put any of these substances in their drinks.
There was a crew in San Deigo that actually made true, powerful smart drink
with these things.  Maybe some in SF?

I dabbled in all this years ago, but then decided at my age I can't
really improve my mental performance much.  I will wait until I am old
and my brain starts to slow down.  That is where most of the research on
these drugs seem to have promise.

Some of the combinations I messed with made my dreams go insanely vivid.
I think it was the DMAE.

There were crews in the early DC/Baltimore scene that used these sorts of 
things in their smart drinks too...but really, they just tasted yummy in the 
middle of raving your face off.

I rememeber back in the late 80's there was a drink that used to get 
spammed on live105 called "FastBlast" that was Caffine with some stuff in 
it to countact the crash and headache.  Maybe a little asprin in it.

Mondo 2000 use dto talk a lot about Smart Drugs a lot.  If I had my full 
library I could pull out the emcyclopedia they did and find out what all 
they talked about, but Choline was a big one.  I know DHEA is another, as 
well as 5-HTP and Meletonin.  The whole basis is to provide the base chems 
your brain need sto break down into the various aminos that it'll burn 
through.

Basically like taking on glucose while going through heavy physical 
exertion.  It won't make you stronger, but it'll provide fuel that your 
body needs.  Same goes for he smart drugs, that for the most part the just 
fill up your proverbial gas tank.  If you use up the chems or not is 
another story.  I agree with teh mindset that it's better to have a little 
exces syour don't need instead of lacking when you need it.

Same can't be said for complex carbs.  ;)

Me too, that's why I chopped it there, though I must admit seeing that 
filled me with a very bittersweet feeling, seeing as how it actually did 
get organically gigantic, for a minute, and then our government, feeling 
completely threatened by this movement, went out of its way to destroy 
rave the way it did.

Things could be so different now, but they're not.

As far as "Smart Drinks" go, at the time Brian sent out that first email 
I was a straightedge, (second worst decision of my adult life next to 
enlisting in the Marine Corps), stockbroker trainee working on Wall 
Street, less than two weeks away from passing my Series 7 & 63 NASD 
Registered Representative Licensing Test, in March of 1992, which means 
that rave was one of the furthest things away from my mind. At the time, 
the way I dressed was pretty close to Ed Norton in 'fight club' instead 
of the slackerish looking person I am today.

As it turns out, one of the very first IPOs I worked on was for a small 
Canadian company that was one of DNA Lounge's very first suppliers of 
Smart Drinks, something I didn't find out until years later.

Unfortunately the name of the company escapes me and using google is 
turning out to be an exercise in futility.

There used to be smart drinks at DNA in the early
90s... excellent business before the bar would open at
6. They had a menu with a few of the mental
performance type substances, you could choose like
jamba juice.

Also, Mr. Curb was the man of Smart Drinks in SF. Used
to see his booth everywhere... Not sure what he put in
his drinks, but they were the best IMHO. I tried to
emulate as best I could when I ran a couple smart bars
for Moksha Tribe parties. Seemed like they kept the
crew ripping thru setup and stryke! Most folks i think
ended up hocked up and jitttttterrrryyy.... 

good times.

When I first began going to events in Tucson there was some guy who was mak=
ing smart drinks. It seemed such a science. Later it seemed like more peopl=
e just made fruit smoothies and the art died off. I would love to see a tru=
e resurgence of smart drinks. I am not a chemical user but with my poor die=
t the smart drinks always seemed to give me a good boost.=20

i went to the full moon gathering down in southern california, actually. Saw
Mr. Annand, Acid Circus performing live (sooo awesome), dj Brian, Chadwick,
and a very very funky set from Treavor. It was a good time - not too cold at
night, a light breeze during the day, and lots of sunshine and beautiful
people.

I'll miss California.

I'd give a review of the full moon up here.... but I think it'd come off as
biased since I helped put on the party!  I can say, we were very glad with
how it turned out.  Always awesome to look up at the sky and know there's
others across the country partying it up under the same moon-

i went to the full moon gathering down in southern california, actually. Saw
Mr. Annand, Acid Circus performing live (sooo awesome), dj Brian, Chadwick,

people.

I'll miss California.

No idea yet.  But however it sorts out, I'm sure we'll devise a way to 
respond to it as best as we can.

If it means less streams, it means less streams.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: [dcraves] Yes it is RR: Jean Baudrillard, dead at 77

FWIW It should be noted that _Simulacra_ is a straight up work of
philosophy, and one translated from french at that.  I found it
required quite a commitment to read, sometimes going over pages two
and three times to grok Baudrillad;s (necessarily) invented
nomenclature - hyperreality, etc.  One of my personal disappointments
is that I have yet to make it all the way through.


(By way of comparison, I thought nieztche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra was
pretty readable, although it is, like camus's stuff, basically a
story.)

We used to make a fruit smoothy-type drink and add stimulants like  
Guarana, Gotu Kola, Ginsengs, green tea and the like with a bit of

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: [dcraves] Yes it is RR: Jean Baudrillard, dead
 at 77

There was a class I took in college about Post Modernism; we read lots 
of art philosophers, one of the ones we studied extensively was 
Baudrillard. That class was some of the most densest reading I have ever 
done. Those, with the discussions, became one of the most rewarding 
classes I ever took in college. I kept all of the papers and notes.

Simulcra is worth-while reading.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

I believe this is the first X-Rated Quote of the Day in History.  I
don't know, I could be wrong.  Maybe our little buddies at Google
could auto-gzip a few archives and let us know.

Another note before I go to this quote, I just discovered this guy, my
friend Dan called me from Chicago to tell me about this website, and I
guess he felt it so important that he called me back 15 minutes later
to make sure I read some of the stories.  But anyway, I'm sure all of
you already know who this guy is, because I'm pretty slow on the uptake.

--

I asked the only girl in the place other than Jez if I could feel her
tits. She said sure, and I gave them a good slapping. It was awesome.
She loved it because she thought I was gay and thus safe, and I loved
it because I am straight and she had great tits. Everybody wins!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - Tonal: Shamrock Green w/ Justin Long next Friday!!!

Friday, March 16th

11 PM 'til very late
Rock It Science, Prismatic Tracks, Crush Collective, and sfhousemusic.com
present:

Tonal: Shamrock Green

Raw SF Warehouse Location: call 888-482-9281 or 415-412-0406, or visit
prismatictracks.com or sfhousemusic.com the day of for directions 
$10 before midnight, $15 after
$5 discount for dressing UP in Shamrock Green (at door person's
discretion--make some serious effort people!)
 
Before you have time to stop talking about how incredibly intimate, vibey,
and fantastically dressed up the crowd at Fire Engine Red was, not to
mention Miles Maeda's set, we are proud to annouce Tonal: Shamrock Green!
Yes, as if you needed another excuse to get wasted this is St. Patty's Day
weekend.  Get ready for the next throwdown in this series of sick new color
themed parties brought to you by some of the hottest crews in the
underground house scene. Tonal parties continue showcase talent flown in
from out of town as well as some of your favorite local house jocks. We look
forward to continuing to bring you high quality events, so strap on your
dancing shoes, bring everybody you know and get ready to move it! 
 
DJ's:
 
Justin Long (Dotbleep, No Assembly Firm, Chicago)
 
We are incredibly excited to have one of the sickest dj's we've ever seen
ready to rip the decks to shreds for this one!  Justin beats the dancefloor
up like few others, tearing through jackin' chicago beats, acid house, techy
glitchy dirty madness, and anything else that will make you lose your mind
and stomp your feet.  His label Dotbleep consistently puts out some of the
hottest tracks around, and his remix and production work with Dan X under
the moniker No Assembly Firm routinely works dancefloors into a frenzy.  If
you've missed Justin's sets at Stompy or the Endup we are not quite sure
what you've been thinking.  Get ready for a serious treat live and direct
from the Windy City!  www.myspace.com/dj_justinlong

Deron Delgado (Stompy, Good Family)
 
DJ, Producer, Label boss, and part of a growing internet empire (stompy.com)
pushing funky, pumping tunes into the cd decks of dj's across the globe,
Deron Delgado is a huge part of the dance music community in San Francisco
and beyond.  Deron's dj sets always seem to have the perfect blend of hot
tracks that have yet to even hit the shelves, today's best cuts, and just
the right sprinkling of dancefloor classics all mixed to perfection.  We are
honored to have Deron closing the night out proper for us.
www.myspace.com/derondelgado
 
Andrew Phelan (Prismatic, Drop Music, So Sound) vs. Eric Sharp (Rock It
Science)

What happens when you take 2 talented local SF dj's and put them on the
decks together warming it up for one of their favorite dj's in the world?
Make sure you get your ass on the dancefloor to find out.  Andrew and Eric
both have crates that stretch far into the vaults of house music and you can
be sure that they will be digging deep to Tonally turn up the heat for this
one.  Work it out! 
 
Andrew Kelsey (Blue Collar Entertainment)

A veteran of SF's underground scene (some of you geezers may remember The
Fool), Andrew Kelsey has since graduated to building one of the fastest
growing booking agencies in the US, Blue Collar Entertainment.  Mr. Kelsey
has a nose for finding great dj's, which can probably be attributed to the
fact that he is a great dj himself.  We wish that Andrew spent a little bit
more time getting himself behind the decks, so we had to jump at the chance
to get him to rock it for you.  Get here early in time for the man to open
things up in high style!

I was talking more about the original sobe stuff like Zen Tea, Elixer, 
Power, Blizzard, etc etc.  Mostly flavored corn syrup with some herbals in 
them like kava kava, St Johns Wort, etc.

My favorite of course was when some of the companies trie dto claim not to 
have cafine, but were using Gurana instead.  ;)

Cozumel is an island that's supposed to have some of the best diving in 
the world. Playa Del Carmen is a smallish town on the mainland nearby, 
I've been there a couple of times. Also Tulum a little bit further down 
the coast is supposed to be great. Mayan ruins and stuff.

ah yes - Playa Del Carmen.  Araya and I spent a week there a few  
years ago.  We didn't make it out to Cozumel. Maybe next time.

If you do find yourself in PDC, be sure to check out Cavernas Chak  
Tun - incredible limestone caves with an underground lake you can  
swim in.  this was one of the highlights of our trip. bring bug  
repellant!

Personally I wouldn't stay in Cozumel unless you wouldn't get  
restless spending an entire vacation in the city of Monterey (I  
would).  I think Playa or Akumel are better choices if you want to  
explore all the pyramids, I rented a car for about $300 a week, that  
included the Mexican insurance.  If you do that, I think the most fun  
way to do it is drive on the back roads, sure they're potholed but  
you get to see how the locals live, pretty much like they did a  
thousand years ago except they have lights in their grass huts and  
they sell beautiful art.

Before my last trip there I purchased a wonderful book called The  
Yucatan by Antoinette May, it's a great all around tour book and  
tells you her opinion on the best places to stay and eat and see in  
the entire region, so if you do decide to stay in Cozumel that's a  
good book to help you decide.

If you can make it out to the Balakanche Caves, it's a very sacred  
Mayan site.

i just came back from playa del carmen and tulum.  we stayed near playa for=
 half of the time and in tulum the other half.
that worked out well since playa is a lot more touristy and active, while t=
ulum is a quiter, lie on the beach type of place.=20
tulum has a range of lodging options, from bare bones huts for ~$30/night t=
o nicer cabana hotels for ~150/night to a few nicer small hotels.
in tulum we stayed at zamas(zamas.com) which was pretty nice, but if you se=
arch around online you can find all kinds of places to stay.
the ruins in tulum are pretty cool because they sit on a cliff overlooking =
an amazing beach and ocean.
there's also numerous cenotes(underwater rivers/lakes) in the tulum area.

i have a few of our photos on flickr - http://www.flickr.com/photos/9333679=
3@N00/sets/72157594556445642/

email me if you want any more info on the area.

yep, you heard right....

i feel kinda weirded out by it since we always did it in april but starting this year thanks to mr. bush we need to change our clocks.
hopefully this energy act works..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/b.html

When we change our clocks

Beginning in 2007, most of the United States begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m. on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time on the first Sunday in November. In the U.S., each time zone switches at a different time.


Spring forward, Fall back

During DST, clocks are turned forward an hour, effectively moving an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening.


Date change in 2007

On August 8, 2005, President George W. Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This Act changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the U.S. Beginning in 2007, DST will begin on the second Sunday in March and end the first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.


When in the morning?

In the U.S., clocks change at 2:00 a.m. local time. In spring, clocks spring forward from 1:59 a.m. to 3:00 a.m.; in fall, clocks fall back from 1:59 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. In the EU, clocks change at 1:00 a.m. Universal Time. In spring, clocks spring forward from 12:59 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.; in fall, clocks fall back from 1:59 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.

In the U.S., restaurants and bars have various closing policies. In many states, liquor cannot be served after 2:00 a.m. But at 2:00 a.m. in the fall, the time switches back one hour. So, can they serve alcohol for that additional hour in October? The official answer is that the bars do not stop serving liquor at 2:00 a.m., but actually at 1:59 a.m. So, they have already stopped serving when the time changes from Daylight Saving Time into Standard Time. In practice, however, many establishments stay open an extra hour in the fall.
In the U.S., 2:00 a.m. was originally chosen as the changeover time because it was practical and minimized disruption. Most people were at home and this was the time when the fewest trains were running. It is late enough to minimally affect bars and restaurants, and it prevents the day from switching to yesterday, which would be confusing. It is early enough that the entire continental U.S. switches by daybreak, and the changeover occurs before most early shift workers and early churchgoers are affected.

Some U.S. areas

For the U.S. and its territories, Daylight Saving Time is NOT observed in Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Arizona. The Navajo Nation participates in the Daylight Saving Time policy, even in Arizona, due to its large size and location in three states.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

I am a bit slow on the uptake like I said, so I just recently  
discovered that site Digg, I submitted an article and if anyone wants  
to check it out here's the link:

http://digg.com/environment/Scientists_threatened_for_climate_denial

I don't care if you digg or bury it, it's got 67 diggs so far, pretty  
cool I think.

Have a sunny day from Hawaii to the Azorres!

Subject: [sfraves] sfraves calendar

I've been lurking this mailing list for the past few months and I've 
been wondering:
So is the actual calendar listing part of sfraves pretty much dead or is 
it just in hiatus?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: headaches on E

I never notice a huge diff. between pressies and capsules, other than 
feeling slightly more worn out, I would guess it being due to adulterants in 
pressies.

That being said, since I've seen you mention that you're supposed to be on 
ainti-depressants, and knowing E can mess with your brain chemistry, I'd say 
maybe you lay off pills altogether for a while.

Also, if you have done a good deal of it in the past, you may need a solid 
year or so off of doing them in order to let your brain really have a good 
recovery from the damage it does. Sounds like you're really getting nasty e 
hangover, and that means it's time to ease back big time.

I'm guessing its probably the other shit in that pill that messed with you.
I've had some pills that really jacked me up before. Most likely a DXM/MDMA
combo. I got bad seritonin syndrome with a bad headache, my arms went numb,
and my hand and arm locked up like a lobster claw and I couldn't move it. It
freaked me out.

There's a review in the latest Electronic Musician of a book that  
sounds right up many alleys in this group. "Handmade Electronic  
Music:  The Art Of Hardware Hacking" by Nicolas Collins. Sort of a  
DIY for cicuit benders.

fighting for."  -Paulo Coelho

nope not my meds...i dont take anti-depressants since they fuel my manic episodes...and i was on lithium & depokate..but i'm off it...for awhile...

so i'm not mixing my meds with other drugs..

and i have laid off the pills for awhile...i just started doing them again...
maybe your right,,, maybe a year or so..

thanks for your info

feeling slightly more worn out, I would guess it being due to adulterants in 
pressies.

That being said, since I've seen you mention that you're supposed to be on 
ainti-depressants, and knowing E can mess with your brain chemistry, I'd say 
maybe you lay off pills altogether for a while.

Also, if you have done a good deal of it in the past, you may need a solid 
year or so off of doing them in order to let your brain really have a good 
recovery from the damage it does. Sounds like you're really getting nasty e 
hangover, and that means it's time to ease back big time.

Subject: [sfraves] BT studio robbed again!!

Haven't seen any mention of this on any boards im on as of late. I guess not 
many really care about BT. Not a big trance fan by any means. But it has to 
be said BT is a freakin genius the way he works and stuff that he puts out 
especially as of late. Binary Universe and Emotinal technology very good 
albums and DVD/Video. So it just seems weird that a person that is a 
somewhat Millionaire or pretty damn close I would assume. Has gotten his 
studio robbed twice in what the last 4 or 5 years.

Coincidence or just bad luck? I dunno you be the judge. I would think his 
studio is in a nice area of hollywood, would have a tight ass security 
system. Would want to fly his stuff with some super dooper insurance when 
transporting your gear. I did not hear where it got taken from but it just 
seems like he can't seem to catch a break.


your thoughts?

Mac

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: headaches on E

Not saying they're inerfering with meds, I'm saying that since you are 
SUPPOSED to be on meds, maybe that means your particular brain chemistry 
can't properly handle things that deplete seratonin. If your seratonin is 
already out of whack, using up what's available can't be good for you. I'd 
say take a nice long break from them altogether.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BT studio robbed again!!

I say the idiot needs some real security on his house/studio, or just plain 
needs to get rid of the people around him that are facilitating this.

Big name folks don't just get robbed repeatedly without doing SOMETHING that 
invites it. Maybe he associates with idiots, or he's being stubborn and not 
getting state of the art, super high tech security.

this is what, the third time he's been robbed?

I say "BT - GET A FUCKING CLUE!"

Subject: [sfraves] FS: one Technics 1200 - $300 o.b.o

one turntable, in excellent condition.  no playa use, only moderate  
use at home.  it's super dark grey (and no it's *not* a 1210).   
Grundorf flight case included  http://www.grundorf.com/casesnracks/ 
index.htm

i'm keeping one for digitizing my vinyl, and i don't really have need  
for a pair. i haven't used both decks at the same time for almost a  
year now.

$300; offers considered

Get a v-twin, way more fun to ride in the city.  All the bikes you 
mentioned are balls out performance dialed for redline racing bikes... and 
to be honest you'll never get to ride em right.

I live in a household where I've got an sv650s and my roomies got a ducati 
monster and we both love em.  The low end grunt and torque make for a way 
better riding experience at speeds that won't put you in handcuffs.

Subject: [sfraves] And now, for a funny trip down memory lane...


For those of you who might think I was always jaded... here's an old 
backup of my website I found covering the dates 1997-1998, complete with 
my old DJ calendar & reviews section (this was a genuinely interesting 
time in the SF scene, and many of our list's DJs saw a meteoric rise in 
popularity as house [and to a lesser degree breaks] became almost purely 
club music & massive music for a while and a host of energetic new crews 
filled the void throwing illegal parties).

http://saturn5.com/andy/old/author.htm

A funny walk down memory lane, from when I first started playing out at 
parties (i'd been doing house parties a bit before that).  And maybe, just 
maybe had a more positive outlook.

Anyway, had to come to grips with this being ten years old, and there was 
enough funny shit in there that I thought I'd post it for old times' 
sake... some of the first Viberation events, Tom & Stacy parties, the 
Harmony 5 year bust, some SoCal desert events, SFR list goings on, the 
legendary Static, good stuff!

I'll see if I can find a copy of an old set to go with it... but there you 
have it for now.

Enjoy!

I've a friend of a friend that does travel packages to Belize that 
turned me onto it.

If it comes down to it, i.e. Ghouliani gets s/elected, it's one of the 
places I'm seriously considering ex-patting to, with the main caveat 
being the literacy rate among the locals.

Chief selling point, Belize will never invade another country, nor be 
invaded.

I'm curious why you think Belize would never invade or be invaded?
Usually those two things are mutually exclusive.

Quick- Mexico declares war on Britain, what does Belize do?

Sound far-fetched?
Ever hear of the Falklands?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] It's about fucking time

If it's an issue for you, then I'd suggest starting with Patti Smith's 
'Horses' and 'Easter' and once your ears have gotten tuned, you can then 
work your way up to the sounds of records being scratched on turntables 
as being a valid form of artistic expression in this milieu.

It'll be another 5 years before the Beastie Boys are eligible, and lord 
knows what it's going to take for NWA to get their props, bet you won't 
be bitching then.

:-P

This is what we walk around saying all day around here, for what I'm  
not sure, probably saw it on one of those Mark Fiore cartoons or the  
like.  Other stupid stuff too, like "chu pantalones es so tight, I can  
see your jalapenos."  It never gets old.  But I guess that's where I'm  
kind of like a 5 year old.  Tell the poopie joke again, please.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] It's about fucking time

FUCK YEAH.

Punk rock, bitches.

Tonight was only the second time in my life I got to see her live, 
(missed this show http://tinyurl.com/27j7g5 of hers back last October, 
as did everyone else out on the sidewalk), but the first time I saw her, 
in May of 1979, at the Palladium, (today an NYU dormitory with a plaque 
outside commemorating its history, very sad), it was like being shot out 
of a motherfucking cannon.

Tonight was no different.

But then again, what can you expect from a chick that blew away Jimi 
Hendrix on the first note of the first song she ever released to the 
world at large?

BTW, trivia question.

I had a list of 4 White Americans that got to use the *N* word with 
impunity, (if anybody was gonna say anything tonight it would have been 
Mr.Sharpton, and he didn't), and I had Mark Twain, Quentin Tarantino, 
and Patti Smith, all who got a pass on 'artistic license', but I can't

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Bikes - FS: 900rr basket case

the man speaks the truth.

with that, since we're on the topic of bikes, if anyone is interested in a 
basket-case '95 CBR900 with 17' wheel conversion and Metzler R2 tires with 
about 600mi on them - they've about 4yr old but protected from the sun 
entire time - i've got one to get ride of.

now all the fairing is broken and in a box, the tank is smashed, and the 
block got a small punch through in the same place they all do during a 
wreck... at the oil sensor hole - jbweld is how we all fix them.  otherwise, 
engine is race-ready- gps-verified 168mph top speed - D&D slip-on, 520 chain 
conversion, pedal relocators (so you don't drag the pegs with the 
cat-on-velcro Metzlers when your draggin' a knee through The Carousel ;)

it's yours for $600 firm, which is about the value of the 17" 600 wheel 
conversion alone.  will not part out 'cause i need this bitch gone. 
obviously a salvaged title but fully legit to register if you want to put in 
the time and have a badass rat bike for next to no money.

this used to be the bike:

The sad thing about Belize is that a bad hurricane could completely wipe
it out.  Or if the sea levels rise, it will be the first to disappear.

Are you implying that Myspace has slick layouts?  Every myspace page I have
ever seen looks like my computer threw up.

I have some old rave-related ramblings at my 10-year old web page too..

TB, that might as well be a Neneh Cherry, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets 
or Shamen video.

Ok, found a set I put out from back then (there's a weird turn down in the 
volume a bit into it... like I answered a phone call or something, it just 
annoys me cause it's out of phrase and kinda sudden)... but it's what I 
was playing peak hour back then.  That set is called "stoopid" (cut in my 
home studio on three decks circa late 98 on a PMC-17).

Also, in a couple minutes there should be the set that's had me sorta 
bouncing all morning), from Poznan, Poland - Marcin Czubala (think of 
him as eastern europe's answer to Niel Landstrum).  This is just my kinda 
techno, dorky and fun all at the same time.  Think this set is about two 
years old, so it doesn't fit in with the retro vibe but I just liked it 
too much to not share.

so trance that samples classical music is also classical?

Hell No.

Another example:  Ram Jam remade Lead Belly Ledbetter's "Black 
Betty."  The original was a folk song.  The remake was a rock song.

Just because rock is sampled, the end product is not necessarily rock.

RockNroll is more a concept than a specific style/genre. It's an attitude, 
or at least, it started off that way. The fusion of rhythm & blues and 
'tude. Guess where the rhythm & blues came from  black folks. Guess who 
started hip-hop...

You can't stretch your mind far enough to conceptualize that?

I can't stretch my mind in any fashion to make wrong into 
right.  Rock and Roll is a specific music genre, and has defining 
characteristics like any other genre.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] It's about fucking time

I didn't respond to you for a reason- but come on man-

Oh ok- so Rock and Roll is just a concept- and thus- any random  
Jungle track, because of its use of the R&B amen break, as well as  
its attitude, is thus Rock?
Are you listening to yourself?

Take step a back- art involves innovation.
Art involves taking the old and creating the new.
Art by its very nature is derivative.
Even the earliest cave painters painted only what they had already  
seen roaming the savannah.

Led Zeppelin, my #1 group anywhere, was entirely influenced by the  
R&B at the time-
Does that make them any less worthy in my mind?
Hell no- I mean- Pink Floyd is #2, but... Led Zeppelin released what-  
6 albums?
And there are only 3-4 songs on *all* of them that I dislike?
IMO they were surely better than anyone they got any inspiration from.

The key to enjoying art is to take it for what it is, not what  
inspired it.

Oh and just for the record- do you know where the term "rap" comes from?
Blondie - Rapture.
Yes- *gasp* a blonde white girl was actually the first true rapper.
All other rappers before her had simply talked over other people's  
songs.
She met Fab 5 Freddie, then was the first to talk over her *own*  
music- and things took off from there.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] It's about fucking time

Most of modern music is a trickle down (in one form or another) from 
rockNroll. So in an abstract way, yea, even Jungle could be considered it's 
own form of rock. I've heard more than one person mention it being the 
"heavy metal" of EDM.  There must be SOME reason people can make that 
connection.

But since you argue with me any time I say anything, it's not as if you 
letting me in on a little Blondie trivia (that any music fan worth his/her 
salt would already know) makes a whole fuck of a lotta difference. So climb 
on outta yer Chevy pickup truck, and turn off the "Big & Rich" for long 
enough to hear what me and a whole fuckload of other people are 
sayin'....the point is, enough people in this country have determined that 
hip-hop is worthy of being inducted into the "rockNroll" hall of fame, 
whether or not you agree.

Booya.

And just for the record - the fact that you think Led Zeppelin (whom I like, 
don't get me wrong) is BETTER than the people they took inspiration 
from...is well...questionable at best. I suppose you prefer Clapton solo 
moreso than The Cream.

Now climb on back up into yer Chevy, put yer Travis Tritt tape back on, 
salute your bust of Dubya, and move along.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees

Hi there,
      Well, I absolutely agreed with the following, including Led Zep  
being one of the greatest rock and roll groups of all time.
      That is, until the assertation that the word "Rap" comes from  
Blondie. First of all, I disagree that a true rapper is one that raps  
over their own music vs. someone else's, but even if we accept this  
as a premise, your argument just does not pass muster. Rapper's  
Delight was released in 1979, Rapture was released in 1980 and  
Blondie was certainly not the first person to talk over their own  
music. To begin with, Rapper's Delight is done with all live  
musicians and doesn't have a single sample on it.
       To go back further, Hip Hop is widely recognized as having  
been created by Kool Herc, who was heavily influenced by the Jamaican  
soundsystems of his youth, James Brown, and most importantly the Last  
Poets. The Last Poets most definitely rapped over their own music.  
You could even argue that songs like "Love is Strange" by Mickey &  
Sylvia were predecessors of Rap Music. Coincidentally, Sylvia  
Robinson was also the owner of Sugarhill Records, the label that put  
out Rapper's Delight.
      Trying to say that we get the term "rap" from Blondie is just  
plain wrong and really takes away from the rest of your argument.  
It's also insulting to the richness of black culture going back to  
rapping and proto-rapping in Blues, Jazz, and even earlier black music.


Re:
I didn't respond to you for a reason- but come on man-

Oh ok- so Rock and Roll is just a concept- and thus- any random
Jungle track, because of its use of the R&B amen break, as well as
its attitude, is thus Rock?
Are you listening to yourself?

Take step a back- art involves innovation.
Art involves taking the old and creating the new.
Art by its very nature is derivative.
Even the earliest cave painters painted only what they had already
seen roaming the savannah.

Led Zeppelin, my #1 group anywhere, was entirely influenced by the
R&B at the time-
Does that make them any less worthy in my mind?
Hell no- I mean- Pink Floyd is #2, but... Led Zeppelin released what-
6 albums?
And there are only 3-4 songs on *all* of them that I dislike?
IMO they were surely better than anyone they got any inspiration from.

The key to enjoying art is to take it for what it is, not what
inspired it.

Oh and just for the record- do you know where the term "rap" comes from?
Blondie - Rapture.
Yes- *gasp* a blonde white girl was actually the first true rapper.
All other rappers before her had simply talked over other people's
songs.
She met Fab 5 Freddie, then was the first to talk over her *own*
music- and things took off from there.

Whoopsie, looks like saturn5 was pointing to the wrong htdocs after the 
last move. Caught with our underwear peeking out, kinda :-)

Fixed, now correctly points to our poor and neglected 10 year old site.

Hrmm, wonder if anyone dug deep enough through the folders to find all of 
Ryan's nekkid pics :-)

Subject: [sfraves] Track of the Day

When I was a wee lad (1981-1983) living in San Diego, the DJ at the  
local roller rink used to play electro breaks. I remember first  
hearing  "Jam On It", "Planet Rock", and this track there:

Twilight 22 - "Electric Kingdom"
   http://unsafe.nebcorp.com/~st_indigo/tunes/Electric_Kingdom.mp3

Roller skating, video games in the arcade, and electro breaks made up  
most of my summer breaks as a kid.  not bad.

enjoy!

Huh- I had thought that the music in Rapper's Delight was just a  
couple sections of Good Times.

But I see now this appears to be up for debate, with some of the  
sounds being claimed to have been replayed live by their own band or  
something.

Ah well- not really core to the point I was trying to make, and I  
shouldn't have included it in the first place :)

I have some Howlin Wolf, Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, 
Son House, Skip James (and list goes on) that I think would blow Led 
Zeppelin off the stage.  In fact, when I first dropped the Robert Johnson 
boxed set in my cd player, I kept snapping out of my listening spot on the 
couch to bug out about *yet another* blatant ripoff (and NEVER with 
credit).  Squeeze that wallet till the juice runs down my leg....

Especially when you consider Led Zeps *severely* mastubatory egocentric 
stage antics and chemical self indulgence at the expense of their ability 
to realize they're on stage and getting paid to kick ass... I hold the 
people in the paragraph above in higher regard.

Add to the the incredible work prior to or being done in parallel to Led 
Zep's first couple albums (namely 13th Floor Elevators, Budgie, Black 
Sabbath, Cream and Jimi with both Band of Gypsies and the Experience)... 
and a lot of the thunder of those first opening strains of Communication 
Breakdown start to not sound so amazing (and mind you, hearing that first 
Zep album loud after being totally musically repressed changed my life as 
a teen).  In any case, the first two Zep albums are essential.  The first 
Peel sessions are incredible.  But almost every live boot I ever heard of 
them sounds like SHIT, and I'm not talking wow/flutter, crowd noise or bad 
acoustics.  By contrast, Skip James recorded almost everything we have of 
him today in a two day stint... one day on piano, one day on guitar in a 
studio... the story is almost too much like the "come and sing into a can" 
bit from O' Brother Where Art Thou.

Rock and Roll is a sound.  It was originally derived from blues, r&b, and 
has grown to absorb everything in it's path.  But I honestly don't think 
most of the prototype hip hop should be considered rock.  At the time hip 
hop came around, rock was dead.  Boston, Foghat, Triumph, Asia, and other 
shit like that were clogging up the channel and not letting in anything.  
I feel honestly weird about Patty Smith in there as well.  It's like 
getting a high five from the enemy you started out wanting to destroy.

Before the mp3 "revolution" stuck it to the man, the punk and hip hop 
undercurrents did (and they did it without fucking the artists... 
creativity won, listeners won, and we got Alternative Tentacles and Def 
Jam in the deal).

I'll shut up now.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR More Re: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees

Fair enough, it is based on Good Times by Chic, but the melody was  
slightly changed and the music was played entirely live by sessions  
musicians at the insistence of Sylvia Robinson. So, as you say, up  
for debate. There is an even earlier song - Christmas Rappin' by  
Kurtis Blow that was also played using live instruments and came out  
well before Blondie's Rapture. Again, I agreed with most of your  
points, just took umbrage with the idea that the term "rap"originated  
with Blondie.

Re:
Huh- I had thought that the music in Rapper's Delight was just a  
couple sections of Good Times.

But I see now this appears to be up for debate, with some of the  
sounds being claimed to have been replayed live by their own band or  
something.

Ah well- not really core to the point I was trying to make, and I  
shouldn't have included it in the first place :)

Re:
Hi there,
      Well, I absolutely agreed with the following, including Led Zep  
being one of the greatest rock and roll groups of all time.
      That is, until the assertation that the word "Rap" comes from  
Blondie. First of all, I disagree that a true rapper is one that raps  
over their own music vs. someone else's, but even if we accept this  
as a premise, your argument just does not pass muster. Rapper's  
Delight was released in 1979, Rapture was released in 1980 and  
Blondie was certainly not the first person to talk over their own  
music. To begin with, Rapper's Delight is done with all live  
musicians and doesn't have a single sample on it.
       To go back further, Hip Hop is widely recognized as having  
been created by Kool Herc, who was heavily influenced by the Jamaican  
soundsystems of his youth, James Brown, and most importantly the Last  
Poets. The Last Poets most definitely rapped over their own music.  
You could even argue that songs like "Love is Strange" by Mickey &  
Sylvia were predecessors of Rap Music. Coincidentally, Sylvia  
Robinson was also the owner of Sugarhill Records, the label that put  
out Rapper's Delight.
      Trying to say that we get the term "rap" from Blondie is just  
plain wrong and really takes away from the rest of your argument.  
It's also insulting to the richness of black culture going back to  
rapping and proto-rapping in Blues, Jazz, and even earlier black music.

Re:
I didn't respond to you for a reason- but come on man-

Oh ok- so Rock and Roll is just a concept- and thus- any random
Jungle track, because of its use of the R&B amen break, as well as
its attitude, is thus Rock?
Are you listening to yourself?

Take step a back- art involves innovation.
Art involves taking the old and creating the new.
Art by its very nature is derivative.
Even the earliest cave painters painted only what they had already
seen roaming the savannah.

Led Zeppelin, my #1 group anywhere, was entirely influenced by the
R&B at the time-
Does that make them any less worthy in my mind?
Hell no- I mean- Pink Floyd is #2, but... Led Zeppelin released what-
6 albums?
And there are only 3-4 songs on *all* of them that I dislike?
IMO they were surely better than anyone they got any inspiration from.

The key to enjoying art is to take it for what it is, not what
inspired it.

Oh and just for the record- do you know where the term "rap" comes from?
Blondie - Rapture.
Yes- *gasp* a blonde white girl was actually the first true rapper.
All other rappers before her had simply talked over other people's
songs.
She met Fab 5 Freddie, then was the first to talk over her *own*
music- and things took off from there.

Actually, Rapper's Delight is based on "good times" by Chic, which 
also inspired "another one bites the dust" by Queen.

man, these decks look in sorry shape.  I was thinking down the road =20
I'd want to have a really grand DJ console.

hey SFR,

recent events in the world of bay area parties have started the wheels turning in my little brain. this list is full of partiers old school and new, so i'm hoping to get a good variety of opinions on what is acceptable in the party scene and what is not.

what do you guys think of parties that get busted or otherwise end prematurely? are there instances when this is forgivable, even expected? or do you feel that organizers, promoters, etc. have a responsibility to their attendees to make sure a party lives up to all it advertised? there was a big bash this past weekend in oakland with a ton of talent and mass hype, and it was meant to last until who knows when... sort of a "party til you drop" environment. big fun. unfortunately the party was busted by the cops, and i think music ended around midnight-ish and patrons were booted from the space by 2am. reactions have mostly fallen into one of two categories:

1) hey, it's an underground party, sometimes they get busted. shit happens in the ug scene - people try really hard to put together something awesome, but given the nature of these kind of parties, sometimes things go awry. 

2) the event organizers owe all these party people something. they paid $15 at the door for a certain kind of party experience and they did not get it. if a party is going to be pumped up this much, it should be properly permitted, etc.

so what do you guys think? if you were at a party that was meant to go until, let's say, 6am, would you be upset if it were shut down at 2am instead? what about 4am? does it make a difference if there was a cover charge or not? when it comes to throwing parties outside of fully permitted, squeaky clean club venues, what exactly do party organizers owe the people who come out to have a good time and support the event?

all opinions welcome...

love,
mo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] busted parties: forgivable?

I have been to many many parties over the past 10 years that have been 
closed early. I think this is a fairly complicated issue and not very 
simple to judge from the outside. I think when are party is closed 
early, everyone suffers. I suppose it is possible that the promoters 
could still be making out from ticket sales but that varies a lot from 
event to event and I do not think it is the norm.

I think promoters who consistently do the 'right thing' are the ones I 
will support and return to their parties. Doing the 'right thing' could 
vary from booking talent I like, to creating a nice atmosphere, finding 
an interesting new venue, to throwing a free party after one of theirs 
got shut down early.

Generally, after a party gets shut down, I am rarely upset at the 
promoters. I am upset at the unfortunate stuation, but at no one in 
particular. I am sure one factor of this is that I don't believe I have 
ever paid more that $15-20 for a party that has been shut down. If a 
party I paid something like $40-50 for was shut down I think i might 
have more of a reason to complain. However, I think this is indicative 
of the legal legitimacy of the event. I feel like the more I pay for an 
event the more I should be able to expect that it is going to be ran in 
a legal way and I am going to stand a higher chance of getting my monies 
worth.

That's my $.02...

SIN out!

I heard there were quite a few busts over the weekend.... from the zapas
party to the dustfish massive both in oakland, to few other outdoor
renegades in SF as well.  If you've been partying for at least a year, you
should be familiar with the local crews, what type of parties they put on,
etc etc.  My thoughts are as follows, parties cost money, sometimes a big
heap of money.  Sometimes what happens is out of the promoters hands, other
times they're engaged in questionable practices in promoting/throwing
parties, and will go so far as false advertising (ie, saying an event it
permitted until 6am when it's not).  However, the party people need to use
some common sense.  When I saw the size of the Dustfish Massive, I knew
there was no way this could fly under the nose of the OPD.  When was the
last time Oakland had a fully permitted party in a HUGE warehouse???  My
experience with parties has been good crews will always try to do some type
of makeup party-  it may not be as large or have the talen the original
party did- but they know they owe something to all their loyal attendees who
make their events profitable.  On the flipside-  a lot of crews do not fall
in this category- which is partially why I'm pretty picky about the few
parties I do make it out to now.  A little research and common sense will
make your partying experience that much better... but in the world of
electronic music-  busts are inevitable.  You're gonna have to learn to cope
with it at some point.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] busted parties: forgivable?

The big questions I ask, that determine whether or not I don't mind the 
bust, or whether or not I sort of "blame" the promoters are:

1. How blatant were they about promotions? If it's a UG, there have to be 
safety measures taken to insure promotions don't go out (en masse) to the 
"wrong" people. (i.e. irresponsible kids, cops, etc.)

2. How covert were they at the venue? Are kids milling about all over the 
sidewalk? Are shuttles in use? Are security good about getting people in off 
the street?

3. How obnoxiously loud is the music from the street? Can you hear the 
system from blocks away? If so - are there people living nearby?

Basically, if the promoters have no sense of stealthiness, then I hold them 
far more responsible. If they just have a bunch of dumb ass kids there that 
are being over the top and excessively noticeable, then, even though I think 
the promoters should be a bit more selective about WHO they promote to, 
ultimately the attendees have to show SOME respect and responsibility.

Finally, if the promoters did a massively piss poor job with 
security/organizing the event/being cautious, etc. - then they just suck. 
(that "massive" that was supposed to happen last summer in Sacramento - 
Sacramento Summer Music Festival - comes to mind in regards to huge fuck 
ups)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Bikes


LOL risotto...

I ride an 02 Gixxer 6 and it is nice a lil on the heavy side when compared 
to the newer bikes (I.E R1,new Gixxer, Truimph etc..) but it is still a 
decent bike to have. Lots of power im getting mine geared down for better 
low end. (I.E 520 Chain conversion) im going one down in the front and one 
up in the back. Vortex and D.I.D gold chain stylie!!  like andy said the 
SV650 is a freakin solid bike cheap and from what I hear fun to ride. I 
might get one as a track bike. You can normally pick uup a SV at fremont 
cycle salvage for about 3k in good condition. Matter of fact I just saw 3 
posted on there site the other day. (www.fremontcyclesalvage.com)

as far as im concerned the Italian or "European" bikes for that matter are 
far to over rated. They are expensive, sound like shit (Ducati 776 ,9 series 
etc) and that is the only name people seem to know when people talk to me 
about bikes Ducati this and that.. or aprilia etc..

But none of those bikes are winning the AMA's or Grand Prix's now are 
they!!!

Who are running the top bikes Suzuki, Honda,Yamaha  But then again im sure 
the top riders could win on just about any bike  ;-)

Enough of my seneless ramblings..

If you want "Looks" you can't beat an R1 or R6 they are just Tits when it 
comes to design
you got $$ buy a CBR 600RR expensive but a solid ride.
You like snazzy colors get a Kawasaki ZX6RR (07 model is super tits and fun 
to ride)
You want the lady's to drool you get the "Gixxer"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] busted parties: forgivable?

$10 adv tix and the fact that ****** is a legendary Burning Man crew that 
has given far more to the scene in more substantial ways than could be 
captures in a single billing.. so if one goes arwy they will always come 
through with a second round.  I talked with the organizer and he said that 
there was a call routing failure with the city that is comonly used to 
intercept the call before it goes to switchboard for events that you have 
notified them of in advance.  The call routing failure was that they failed 
to notify and that seemed a little foolish given the size of the event.  
Anyone know anything about this?

I have been to many many parties over the past 10 years that have been 
closed early. I think this is a fairly complicated issue and not very simple 
to judge from the outside. I think when are party is closed early, everyone 
suffers. I suppose it is possible that the promoters could still be making 
out from ticket sales but that varies a lot from event to event and I do not 
think it is the norm.

I think promoters who consistently do the 'right thing' are the ones I will 
support and return to their parties. Doing the 'right thing' could vary from 
booking talent I like, to creating a nice atmosphere, finding an interesting 
new venue, to throwing a free party after one of theirs got shut down early.

Generally, after a party gets shut down, I am rarely upset at the promoters. 
I am upset at the unfortunate stuation, but at no one in particular. I am 
sure one factor of this is that I don't believe I have ever paid more that 
$15-20 for a party that has been shut down. If a party I paid something like 
$40-50 for was shut down I think i might have more of a reason to complain. 
However, I think this is indicative of the legal legitimacy of the event. I 
feel like the more I pay for an event the more I should be able to expect 
that it is going to be ran in a legal way and I am going to stand a higher 
chance of getting my monies worth.

That's my $.02...

SIN out!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Tonal - Shamrock Green w/ Justin Long this Friday!

Friday, March 16th

11 PM 'til very late
Rock It Science, Prismatic Tracks, Crush Collective, and sfhousemusic.com
present:

Tonal: Shamrock Green

Raw SF Warehouse Location: call 888-482-9281 or 415-412-0406, or visit
prismatictracks.com or sfhousemusic.com the day of for directions $10 before
midnight, $15 after
$5 discount for dressing UP in Shamrock Green (at door person's
discretion--make some serious effort people!)
 
Before you have time to stop talking about how incredibly intimate, vibey,
and fantastically dressed up the crowd at Fire Engine Red was, not to
mention Miles Maeda's set, we are proud to annouce Tonal: Shamrock Green!
Yes, as if you needed another excuse to get wasted this is St. Patty's Day
weekend.  Get ready for the next throwdown in this series of sick new color
themed parties brought to you by some of the hottest crews in the
underground house scene. Tonal parties continue showcase talent flown in
from out of town as well as some of your favorite local house jocks. We look
forward to continuing to bring you high quality events, so strap on your
dancing shoes, bring everybody you know and get ready to move it! 
 
DJ's:
 
Justin Long (Dotbleep, No Assembly Firm, Chicago)
 
We are incredibly excited to have one of the sickest dj's we've ever seen
ready to rip the decks to shreds for this one!  Justin beats the dancefloor
up like few others, tearing through jackin' chicago beats, acid house, techy
glitchy dirty madness, and anything else that will make you lose your mind
and stomp your feet.  His label Dotbleep consistently puts out some of the
hottest tracks around, and his remix and production work with Dan X under
the moniker No Assembly Firm routinely works dancefloors into a frenzy.  If
you've missed Justin's sets at Stompy or the Endup we are not quite sure
what you've been thinking.  Get ready for a serious treat live and direct
from the Windy City!  www.myspace.com/dj_justinlong

Deron Delgado (Stompy, Good Family)
 
DJ, Producer, Label boss, and part of a growing internet empire (stompy.com)
pushing funky, pumping tunes into the cd decks of dj's across the globe,
Deron Delgado is a huge part of the dance music community in San Francisco
and beyond.  Deron's dj sets always seem to have the perfect blend of hot
tracks that have yet to even hit the shelves, today's best cuts, and just
the right sprinkling of dancefloor classics all mixed to perfection.  We are
honored to have Deron closing the night out proper for us.
www.myspace.com/derondelgado
 
Andrew Phelan (Prismatic, Drop Music, So Sound) vs. Eric Sharp (Rock It
Science)

What happens when you take 2 talented local SF dj's and put them on the
decks together warming it up for one of their favorite dj's in the world?
Make sure you get your ass on the dancefloor to find out.  Andrew and Eric
both have crates that stretch far into the vaults of house music and you can
be sure that they will be digging deep to Tonally turn up the heat for this
one.  Work it out! 
 
Andrew Kelsey (Blue Collar Entertainment)

A veteran of SF's underground scene (some of you geezers may remember The
Fool), Andrew Kelsey has since graduated to building one of the fastest
growing booking agencies in the US, Blue Collar Entertainment.  Mr. Kelsey
has a nose for finding great dj's, which can probably be attributed to the
fact that he is a great dj himself.  We wish that Andrew spent a little bit
more time getting himself behind the decks, so we had to jump at the chance
to get him to rock it for you.  Get here early in time for the man to open
things up in high style!

I heard on ravelinks there's a new crop of crews that are resorting to
weekly renegades at some old backup outdoor spots (like 24th &
Illinois, Daly City stables and marshs off Cargo). Using color flyers even
advertising multiple "stages", and also charging at the "door" by their
"security"?? I'm guessing the lack of (or complacency to look for) UG
spaces is prompting this.

I'm reading it's commonplace for people to bring guns and jack kids. Last
I heard at 24 & Illinois someone fired off an assault rifle and poured 
gasoline on the street an lit it on fire.

The ravelinks kids think these parties are the coolest shit since sliced
bread, and compare them to the movie Groove.

I'm frightened and disturbed by this, hopefully someone will pinch me and
I'll wake up.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] busted parties: forgivable?

well, it sounds like from this synopsis the smaller, more experienced  
crews should just keep doing what they've been doing for years now,  
keep them small and relatively unadvertised.  sfraves perhaps being  
one of the more low key hookup points.  the smart ravelinks kids will  
come around and realize that's not really what a rave is all about.   
didn't we go through this in '96 when hard trance became the median  
to which one judged/was judged by and deep house was suddenly  
considered as downtempo?  i'm not really trying to judge genres here,  
don't get me wrong, i'm just trying to compare some of the attitudes  
i'm hearing about, including those zombie raves with what i saw  
firsthand back then.

Or hopefully Darwinism will win out and those assault rifle bullets will 
take out some shady promoters and retarded "party kids".

Sorry to be so cynical, but my tolerance for ignorant folks who have no 
regard for others' personal safety or well being is just low right now. And 
sheisty ass "promoters" who charge at a renegade? WTF?? Seriously, I hope 
the cops bust every one of these types of "events" so we can get rid of some 
of the hoodlum element that seems to be growing since "thizzing" has become 
popular with the ghetto set.

I think the reason these spots are gettin blown up is there accessibility.
I don't think the stables has experience this to the same point, as it would
require moving equipment with manpower- more than a few yards too.  IMHO,
I've been a strong advocate of straying away from these locations this
year.  We're blessed to have so many beautiful outdoor spots within an
hour's drive of SF- and I am quite thankful most of em you can't simply just
drive your truck up to and drop your equipment off.  Although it gets
progressively harder to throw outdoor renegades as the years passes...
However, forgotten treatusures suddenly rear there head again.  We were able
to pull off a full moon last month at one of the nicer beaches in santa cruz
county.... of course... sound wasn't up til 3:30am  ;)  I always thought a
longer drive, to a remote and unknown area was part of the adventure of
going to a party-  however, a few younger people I've spoken with this see
this as a reason to avoid such a party!  Bullocks!

further underscoring your point, Ben.  only those who *really want to  
be there* will show up.  you might end up with a smaller crowd, but  
it will likely be a better crowd.

Exactly.... not just recent gunplay at some of these events, which isn't a
surprise given their proximity to some of the more dangerous projects in
SF... but from what I've heard, fights have become pretty much commonplace
at the Rankin/280 spot, and have heard several accounts of people being
tasered at another party there.   All the more reason I am for parties
outside of SF at this point in time.

Damn, that place is still being used?  Shows how out of touch I am.

I'm not sure about the "parties out of SF" thing, though.  Except for  
a couple at that place in Sunnyvale and some at peoples' houses, I've  
pretty much been unwilling to LEAVE San Francisco for parties for  
something like more than a year.  Ever since that party Spam threw at  
the crackhouse, where a bunch of the local thugs rushed the door,  
stole the cash box, shot the place up, and broke into a bunch of  
peoples' cars; I and most of the friends that i party with these days  
have been of the opinion that we're done with that side of the bridge.

First off, it depends on who we're talking about forgiving.

Though I'm less inclined to mouth off about it these days, I'm still  
of the opinion that the pigs busting a party in the first place is  
pretty much always unforgivable.  As far as I'm concerned, so long as  
there is no violence going on, going out to a party falls under the  
first amendment: "the right of the people peaceably to assemble".   
Period.  End of discussion.  And unless there *IS* violence at a  
party, and they are responding to that violence, any cop that has any  
part in busting a party, or even showing its face at one, is  
undeserving of its badge, job, and American citizenship; and should  
have all three immediately and permanently revoked.  They want to be  
a bunch of petty, two-bit thugs lording it over the people instead of  
"serving and protecting" them; they should go do it in some third- 
world dictatorship, where their kind belongs.

But that is probably a bit too naively idealistic for reality.  So,  
working within the system we're stuck with, and as to wether or not  
promoters should be forgiven, it depends on a lot.

Sometimes, events are well and truly out of a promoter's control:

Once, I was at a party that had to shut down at 11pm-ish because a  
gas line burst in the next building over, making the risk that the  
venue could be "blown up" quite literal.  I don't think anybody could  
fault the promoter in the slightest for shutting things down.   
Actual, imminent, real danger of getting burninated == no complaint  
about going home early.

At one fully-permitted, ending-at-2am, and-so-on, party that was  
nevertheless getting busted; as we were filing out of the building, I  
found myself briefly standing behind the promoter, with his permit in  
hand, as the pig was bitching him out.  The exact words the issued  
forth from its mouth were: "I don't care if you have a permit or not;  
we don't want you people in our town.".  I'm not really sure there's  
much you can fault the promoter with if he's gone through all the  
hoops to have his event be permitted and legal, but the cops decide  
to go all Judge Dredd on him... except that maybe he have to have a  
lawyer on hand at the party if he ever tries to throw anything in  
livermore again.

The bulk of the time, though, promoters have at least some control in  
these things.  And a big part of wether a busted party is forgivable  
is wether the promoter was honest about the risks or not in the first  
place:

when there's no imminent danger to life and limb, and the pigs aren't  
doing the "My word *IS* the law!" thing; if a party is promoted as:  
"Fully secured and permitted venue." or similar, and/or costs >= $20;  
it damn well BETTER start not a minute later than the time listed on  
the flyer/BSP, end not a minute sooner, and have every single DJ  
advertised.  It's basic ethics and integrity... you deliver what you  
promise.

On the other hand, if a promoter wants to do things underground  
style, skip the permits, and rely on his wits and his attendees  
discretion and responsibility; I'm fine with that.  But he needs to  
let everyone know that's the case, and charge appropriately.  Having  
a free outdoor or $5 party at a loft somewhere busted is a whole lot  
more forgivable than anything I've dropped $20 or more on.

Then there are those parties when you walk in the door, have a look  
around, and know within the first five minutes that its getting  
busted.  Thats when you just go to the bathroom ('cuz you won't get  
the chance when everybody's being herded out), and start making a  
betting pool about how exactly WHEN the filth will show up.  When a  
party is that obviously poorly put together, it's obvious that the  
promoter was the FIRST one to know how fucked things are, but just  
didn't care and threw it anyway to extract as much money as he could  
before things got shut down.  That's pretty much unforgivable.

The promoters' response to a bust makes a big difference too:

I know that some people here like to hate on them, but one of my  
favorite crews used to be Happy Kids.  At one time, I'd been to more  
Happy Kids' parties than those of any other promoter.  Three of them  
were busted; but I kept coming back because of the stand-up way Marty  
handled things.  In all three cases, he was on the phone immediately  
trying to throw together an afterparty, and anyone who wasn't quite  
ready to drive yet was welcome to stick around and "help clean up".   
In one, your ticket stub was good to get you in to his next party, in  
another it was good for you AND a friend.  And in two of the three  
busts I was there for, about an hour after the pigs had left, he  
turned the music back on, updated the infoline to tell everyone to  
come back to the original venue, and we partied till dawn.   
Regardless of their other faults, *THAT* is how a promoter who cares  
handles busts; and if he were to start throwing parties regularly  
again (Though I actually hope, for his sake, that he doesn't.) I'd  
happily be first in line.

I'm aiming at Japan myself.

I just found out that I didn't get into JET this year, though.  I was  
all emo about it for a while before I remembered that there are a  
half-dozen private language schools that were my fallback plan from  
the very beginning.  Plus, the plan was to turn JET down and go  
private anyway, were I to get accepted but placed in the middle of  
bumfuck nowhere instead of a real city.  So next on the list are ECC  
(Top of my list of the private schools.  But they operate on an odd  
schedule and don't interview applicants until the fall.) , Amity, and  
AEON...

Never say never, but Japan is extraordinarily unlikely to invade or  
be invaded anytime soon.  Plus it has the advantages over anything  
south of the border of better food, a cooler language, good music,  
much better nerd toys, some of the largest and safest cities in the  
world, and a good club and rave scene.

Hell.  I hate "pimped out" myspace pages with a passion.  Bad

I must have the most boring myspace in the universe... just the very

Subject: [sfraves] New mix up. 

Hey Guys,

I just finished a new mix and thought I would post the link for those that 
listen to and like house music. It's geared a bit more towards the younger 
rave crowd. (I.E Pumping disco, electro tinged house) the mixing is average 
nothing to write home about, but I think the track selection is solid. I 
don't have the track list off hand but if you want a copy of it email me and 
I can shoot that over to ya.

1 hour download or stream ya'll know the deal.

If you mean "fun" being defined as sending a whole party to an underground 
that Harmony was throwing after their party got busted the same night, 
sure.

Nothing like working door, and telling countless doe-eyed huggy revelers 
that we can't let anybody else in (it was "Harmony Full" which means 
putting 1000 heads in a 600 person space).  At the dance studio.  And 
they're all dressed like rainbow bright and don't have the common sense to 
leave when we can't let them in.  So it's this mob of like 250 people all 
huddled around.  At the corner of 20-something and Mission.

Happy Kids sure had energy, but I wouldn't label them one of the more 
organized or conscious collectives in the scene till later in their 
parties.  I'd venture to say that a lot of what we learned from our peers 
(like Harmony and Happy Kids) resulted in some of the "rules" that made 
Viberation kinda different (fanatical dedication to under-capacity ticket 
sales, responsible methods like mappoints and womo/hand to hand promotion, 
open budgets, etc).  All that said, HK was where I ultimately met some of 
my favorite folks in the scene.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

I just talked to a friend who recently went to study in China for a  
month, this person told me firsthand stuff I don't even want to think  
about right now, much less share.  Maybe I will someday.  For me, it  
puts our threads about parties being busted into perspective.  Feel  
lucky.  Sorry to depress you, that's not really my goal.  When you're  
dancing this weekend, please have a moment of silence for the people  
that have it a lot worse than we do and think thoughts they will see  
freedom in their lifetimes.

Have a nice weekend.  - DF

Well, I don't know about flash (I hope it finds its way off the web)
but the whole point of writing (x)html pages with css is to make the
content legible with our without the fancy styling.

Building web pages with that in mind gives you a better chance of your
page rendering in any future browsers, as well as todays stripped down
cell phone browsers and screen readers.

But it's fukwork friday so enough of that talk ;) and yeah I
appreciate a good throwback in web design too!

Hi there,
Well, I absolutely agreed with the following, including Led Zep 
being one of the greatest rock and roll groups of all time.
That is, until the assertation that the word "Rap" comes from 
Blondie. First of all, I disagree that a true rapper is one that raps 
over their own music vs. someone else's, but even if we accept this 
as a premise, your argument just does not pass muster. Rapper's 
Delight was released in 1979, Rapture was released in 1980 and 
Blondie was certainly not the first person to talk over their own 
music. To begin with, Rapper's Delight is done with all live 
musicians and doesn't have a single sample on it.
To go back further, Hip Hop is widely recognized as having 
been created by Kool Herc, who was heavily influenced by the Jamaican 
soundsystems of his youth, James Brown, and most importantly the Last 
Poets. The Last Poets most definitely rapped over their own music. 
You could even argue that songs like "Love is Strange" by Mickey & 
Sylvia were predecessors of Rap Music. Coincidentally, Sylvia 
Robinson was also the owner of Sugarhill Records, the label that put 
out Rapper's Delight.
Trying to say that we get the term "rap" from Blondie is just 
plain wrong and really takes away from the rest of your argument. 
It's also insulting to the richness of black culture going back to 
rapping and proto-rapping in Blues, Jazz, and even earlier black music.

And there are only 3-4 songs on *all* of them that I dislike?
IMO they were surely better than anyone they got any inspiration from.

The key to enjoying art is to take it for what it is, not what

Oh and just for the record- do you know where the term "rap" comes from?
Blondie - Rapture.
Yes- *gasp* a blonde white girl was actually the first true rapper.
All other rappers before her had simply talked over other people's
songs.
She met Fab 5 Freddie, then was the first to talk over her *own*
music- and things took off from there.

For the record the term rap was coined by James Brown, in several of his songs he says "Can I rap for ya", one song imperticular was "talking loud and saying nothing", isn't ironic, don't ya think.

Subject: [Dancecult-l] Fwd: MTV-U Fulbright Fellowships for Junior U.S.
Scholars

 

 

 

 

Dear Colleagues,

 

The State Department in partnership with MTV-U is offering Fulbright
fellowships for junior scholars who are US citizens and who are working in
the area of 'culture and music.' In particular the program seeks to fund
projects that use the "power of music as a global force for mutual
understanding." The fellowship has only just been announced and has a very
short deadline: applications are due March 29. I've pasted the call below
and I've attached it as well.

 

Best,

 

Carol 

 

FULBRIGHT-MTVU FELLOWSHIPS

Deadline for applications: March 29, 2007

 

About the Program

Fulbright-mtvU Fellowships, administered by the Institute of International
Education, are for U.S. students to conduct research abroad for one academic
year on study projects of their own design around an aspect of international
musical culture.  For its pilot year (2007-2008), up to 4 Fellowships will
be awarded to outstanding U.S. students nationwide.  In addition to
proposing unique projects on "the power of music" as a global force for
mutual understanding, applicants must submit an outreach plan describing how
they intend to share their activities with their peers during their
Fulbright year.

 

Eligibility

Applicants must be U.S. citizens at the time of application.  Applicants
must have completed a bachelor's degree by the beginning date of the award;
in the performing arts, four years of professional experience may substitute
for the degree.  Preference will be given to recent college/university
graduates.  Applicants must apply to conduct their project in a country
where there is an active U.S. Fulbright Student Program, as listed on
us.fulbrightonline.org.  Applicants must meet all potential host country
requirements, including those related to language and program start dates.
Applications are encouraged for all world regions.

 

Eligible Fields of Study:

Applicants should submit proposals around an aspect of international
contemporary or popular music as a cultural force for expression.
Preference will be given to creative projects that are conveyed in a dynamic
fashion and that are accompanied by a feasible action plan to inform peer
groups via mtvU's various media platforms (broadcast, online and print)
regarding the Fellow's activities in the host country throughout the term of
the grant.  Applicants are encouraged to consider a range of documentary
modes (e.g., blogs, vlogs, photo diaries, news segments) to share their
experiences and findings. Applicants are also encouraged to consider all
aspects of "the power of music" in developing their project proposals.
Along with the study of music in a specific cultural context or
ethnomusicology, proposals will be considered in other music-related fields
including, for example, music and social activism; music in learning; music
and the community, and musical performance.

 

Award Benefits:

The fellowship will provide the following benefits:

Round-trip transportation to the host country

Maintenance for the academic year, based on living costs in the host country

Book and research allowances (Fellows whose projects require extensive
research funding, materials, or equipment must obtain funding from other
sources for such purposes.)

Supplemental health and accident insurance coverage

Foreign language or cultural orientation courses, where appropriate

Media resources (e.g., camera and Internet uplink for students to send
dispatches to mtvU)

 

Additional Information/Application Materials
In addition to the activities proposed for the Fellowship, Fellows may be
asked to participate in special programs, conferences, and/or promotional
activities developed or suggested by the U.S. Department of State, mtvU, the
Institute of International Education, and/or Fulbright Commissions.

 

The deadline for applications is March 29, 2007.

 

For additional information and application materials, please visit
us.fulbrightonline.org.

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid them.
But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles for your dreams
than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're fighting for."  -Paulo
Coelho  

 

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap of
empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another person. ln
those transparent moments we know other people's joys and sorrows, and we
care about their concerns as if they were our own."  -Fritz Williams 

 

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone, but it
worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

Subject: [sfraves] More Re: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees

James Brown certainly uses the word rap frequently, although he uses  
it in the sense of "to talk informally." If I'm not incorrect he says  
"rap to you" not "rap for you." As far as I can remember he uses it  
to mean his little spoken word asides that he makes during his songs.  
These usually don't rhyme. This usage of the word rap is well  
documented in black slang going back to the thirties with the  
earliest recorded usage being 1929. The American Heritage Dictionary  
states that no less than Winston Churchill uses the term in 1933.
WC - the first B-Boy. ;)

Re:  Fair enough, it is based on Good Times by Chic, but the melody was
slightly changed and the music was played entirely live by sessions
musicians at the insistence of Sylvia Robinson. So, as you say, up
for debate. There is an even earlier song - Christmas Rappin' by
Kurtis Blow that was also played using live instruments and came out
well before Blondie's Rapture. Again, I agreed with most of your
points, just took umbrage with the idea that the term "rap"originated
with Blondie.

Re:
Huh- I had thought that the music in Rapper's Delight was just a
couple sections of Good Times.

But I see now this appears to be up for debate, with some of the
sounds being claimed to have been replayed live by their own band or
something.

Ah well- not really core to the point I was trying to make, and I
shouldn't have included it in the first place :)

Re:
Hi there,
Well, I absolutely agreed with the following, including Led Zep
being one of the greatest rock and roll groups of all time.
That is, until the assertation that the word "Rap" comes from
Blondie. First of all, I disagree that a true rapper is one that raps
over their own music vs. someone else's, but even if we accept this
as a premise, your argument just does not pass muster. Rapper's
Delight was released in 1979, Rapture was released in 1980 and
Blondie was certainly not the first person to talk over their own
music. To begin with, Rapper's Delight is done with all live
musicians and doesn't have a single sample on it.
To go back further, Hip Hop is widely recognized as having
been created by Kool Herc, who was heavily influenced by the Jamaican
soundsystems of his youth, James Brown, and most importantly the Last
Poets. The Last Poets most definitely rapped over their own music.
You could even argue that songs like "Love is Strange" by Mickey &
Sylvia were predecessors of Rap Music. Coincidentally, Sylvia
Robinson was also the owner of Sugarhill Records, the label that put
out Rapper's Delight.
Trying to say that we get the term "rap" from Blondie is just
plain wrong and really takes away from the rest of your argument.
It's also insulting to the richness of black culture going back to
rapping and proto-rapping in Blues, Jazz, and even earlier black music.

Re:
I didn't respond to you for a reason- but come on man-

Oh ok- so Rock and Roll is just a concept- and thus- any random
Jungle track, because of its use of the R&B amen break, as well as
its attitude, is thus Rock?
Are you listening to yourself?

Take step a back- art involves innovation.
Art involves taking the old and creating the new.
Art by its very nature is derivative.
Even the earliest cave painters painted only what they had already
seen roaming the savannah.

Led Zeppelin, my #1 group anywhere, was entirely influenced by the
R&B at the time-
Does that make them any less worthy in my mind?
Hell no- I mean- Pink Floyd is #2, but... Led Zeppelin released what-
6 albums?
And there are only 3-4 songs on *all* of them that I dislike?
IMO they were surely better than anyone they got any inspiration from.

The key to enjoying art is to take it for what it is, not what
inspired it.

Oh and just for the record- do you know where the term "rap" comes from?
Blondie - Rapture.
Yes- *gasp* a blonde white girl was actually the first true rapper.
All other rappers before her had simply talked over other people's
songs.
She met Fab 5 Freddie, then was the first to talk over her *own*
music- and things took off from there.

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid them.
But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles for your dreams
than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're fighting for."  -Paulo
Coelho  

 

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap of
empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another person. ln
those transparent moments we know other people's joys and sorrows, and we
care about their concerns as if they were our own."  -Fritz Williams 

 

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone, but it
worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

So I did something I've never really done before, I went through every  
record I own, well only half the collection so far, and made 2 piles.   
One stays, one is for the doghouse, (or ebay or whatever.)   
Unbelievalby, the piles are nearly 50/50 right now.  Very refreshing.   
Someone came over my house and says he loves house music and likes  
some guy named Mark, Farina I think it is?  Anyone heard of him?

Mommy doesn't just have cookies in one hand.  She's got a gun in the
other, and she's going to tell you what to do when you take those
cookies.

Subject: [sfraves] Another mixx by me, Taurus Trap

Here is another mix I just did over the weekend. I was feeling these tracks 
so I figured I would record them. No real flow just solid music.


Give it a download and tell me what ya think.

Genere: Progressive House.

I was pissed that Pandameat never showed.  I heard somethin' about his 
suitcase didn't make it pass airport security *shrug*

Oh, so what was that track that Wrecked'em Rectum dropped after Wronghole 
slipped and fell off the edge of the podium ?  I couldn't understand the 
words.  It almost sounded like a sample of front 242 with some chanting "tit 
for tat, shit for shat..." or something.  Where can I find that track ?

There's an excellent slide show that describes in a nutshell the North  
American Union that I think you all need to watch.  Seriously.  I'm  
not that smart, but even I can understand all the relationships and  
implications when I watch it.

Have a good one!

You know, if Hitler says it's raining outside, guess what?  It's
raining!  I mean, I don't like him, I don't like the Ku Klux Klan, I
don't like any of these racist organizations, but if they make a
legitamite statement, it's still a true statement.  You know, it's
just like when you're a child and your parents tell you something and
you want verification on everything, well you know what?  They were
right the first time!  You don't have to look for verification.  I
don't care who you are, if you've got a mind, if you've got eyes, if
you're an American, you can see what's going on in this country.  Your
race matters not.

Stevian rocks it!

I have a mix he did which includes both a track by Primus (Tommy the Cat) and one by Crazy Penis...

He's a genius!  Or at least a real creative DJ...

Peace,

Peter

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid  
them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles  
for your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're  
fighting for."  -Paulo Coelho

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap  
of empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another  
person. ln those transparent moments we know other people's joys and  
sorrows, and we care about their concerns as if they were our own."  - 
Fritz Williams

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone,  
but it worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

Subject: [sfraves] Pet Food Scandal

--=====================_343948687==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I presume that I was not alone in making the sad discovery
that the pet food recommended by our vet was, potentially,
capable of killing our much loved pet.

WTF

Did anyone have ANY idea that SO MANY supposedly
DIFFERENT pet foods both BRANDS and VARIETIES
were ALL MANUFACTURED BY THE SAME COMPANY !!!!!
And that they were ALL subject to recall - this has to make you
wonder about how "SPECIAL" the formulations we PAY EXTRA for
really are - it also has to make you wonder about the
PREMIUM paid for particular NAME BRANDS - "Science Diet" my . . . . .

Along with the revelation that  80% of the pet food
fed to our trusting pals came from only ONE supply stream -
came the realization that the potential poisoning was part of the manufacturing
process for 5 MONTHS before being detected.
Let me guess - whatever agency or procedure was responsible
for the monitoring of that particular concern were eliminated
or greatly reduced by recent "budget cuts" or forgotten legislation.

I don't know about you, but it has me REALLY QUESTIONING
what i really know and understand about my own food chain
and how much I can really trust those entrusted with MY SAFETY.

Lets put this into perspective:

"I've read that there are about 60 million cats and 75 million
dogs<http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pets_ownership>in
the
U.S. Do you know how many cats and dogs have apparently died from bad food?
Ten. Wait. About 10. Maybe 8 or 11 or who knows. Does anyone really know?
Anyway, if my math is correct, that would be about 0.000007 percent of the
total cat and dog population. I've read several figures, but the American
Humane Association says that 9.6 million cats and dogs are killed in
shelters every year. So you tell me where the mysterious uproar should
direct its attention - 10 or 10 million?" -Blair
Lovern<http://www.pegasusnews.com/staff/blair-lovern/>

http://www.pegasusnews.com/news/2007/mar/19/tainted-pet-food-stories-are-getting-crazy/

But I do share your sentiment about human food protection. 1 human dead from
bad food is too many.

Have a great day!

I swore, I rented it on a friday night because it had an emsemble=20

name sounded funny and and it actually mentioned "unusually funny" on the=

box tagline. Picked up a pizza and watched it with some friends.

That movie was not funny, at all. It was gross. My friends are mad at me=20
now.

Subject: [sfraves] Good News for Today: Its a less violent world...

Partially inspired by "Pet Food Scandal"

"In sixteenth-century Paris, a popular form
of entertainment was cat-burning, in which a cat was hoisted in a sling
on a stage and slowly lowered into a fire. According to historian
Norman Davies, "[T]he spectators, including kings and queens, shrieked
with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted,
and finally carbonized." Today, such sadism would be unthinkable in
most of the world. This change in sensibilities is just one example of
perhaps the most important and most underappreciated trend in the human
saga: Violence has been in decline over long stretches of history, and
today we are probably living in the most peaceful moment of our
species' time on earth."

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: lorazepam...

I was in a minor car accident today and the Dr. prescribed me lorazepam as a muscle relaxer.  So far I'd say it is entirely worthless.

Anyone have any experience with this shit?  Its not doing much for me.  The Aleve seems to have a stronger effect.

Peace,

Peter

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: lorazepam...

I took that during my dad's bought with cancer...benzodiazepine, It helped 
my family a lot with getting sleep and feeling mellow.  I had no idea it was 
a muscle relaxer.
this is what Wiki says...
"Lorazepam (first marketed under the brand names Ativan® and Temesta®) is a 
benzodiazepine type drug. As a benzodiazepine, lorazepam possesses all five 
principal benzodiazepine actions (sedative/hypnotic, muscle relaxant, 
anxiolytic, amnestic and anticonvulsant), but to different extents. 
Lorazepam also has found use as an adjunct anti-nausea drug. Lorazepam is a 
potent drug and its unique pharmacological properties underlie both its 
drawbacks and its advantages."

Another thing that I have taken is GABA, works well with muscle stuffs for 
me.  GHB actually affects GABA in your system, hence the HGH production in 
your body...kinda crazy...dont take it before bed, makes you do weird shit 
in your sleep!!!

or you can chew on some white willow bark :)
I hope you feel better!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Pet Food Scandal


http://www.thehonestkitchen.com/index.shtml

This is who I get my pet food from.  I saw a noticeable difference with the 
doggie when we adpoted her and switched her over.  Previously she was on 
Pedagee (shite!).

Elevated stable energy.  Normal sleep patterns.  BM's became regular and 
rock solid (carpet accidents arn't anything to trip on).  She trimmed down 
to a perfect weight for her size.  Her coat became soft and healthy.  No 
shedding or other annoyances.  She's VERY happy now.

This stuff is great because you can mix up a little or a lot.  You can make 
it soupy or super thick.  I've even mixed in some dry food to give her 
something more to crunch on.  It'll also keep for a very long time, and in 
a pinch, it's 100% human grade so you can eat it too.  ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: lorazepam...

My wife has had cancer... twice.

She was prescribed lorazapam, but it turned out that it was nothing that 
a little pot brownie couldn't fix -- just way more expensive. 
Interestingly enough, one of the other drugs she was also prescribed was 
Thorazine which is... get this... a hiccup suppressant. After I did some 
research it turns out that Thorazine is what they also give to people 
when they're having a bad LSD trip. What the connection is between 
hiccups and LSD I don't think I will never know.

In 1978, it was determined I had experienced sufficient trauma to
carry out my first trial run operation.  An enormous quantity of
cocaine had been flown in ... and I was to deliver it into the
neighboring state of Arkansas.  By that time, Bill Clinton's drug
operation was in full swing.  He was governor of Arkansas, and I
delivered it to a remote airport in Wachata Forest, which I've since
identified as Minna Airport.  I also delivered a little packet of
information and a small quantity of cocaine, a personal stash from J.
Bennett Johnson to Bill Clinton.  I delivered it to Bill Clinton, and
he cut out two lines of the coke, and he *did* inhale.  That certainly
wasn't the only time I saw Bill Clinton doing cocaine.

Not to ruin the positive news, but unfortunately these types of acts still
occur in countries and cultures that have not gone through reformation and
enlightenment. Groups of people that still circumcise women, stone them for
getting raped, and do not allow them education. Another practice of killing
BORN babies if they are girls also comes to mind and holding dog fights,
cock fights, and animal torture for entertainment. So the human race still
has a long way to go. But, hey, we are doing WAY better then 100 years ago.

I suggest if you want Ativan to "do something", wash it down with a shot or 
two of scotch. You'll get all the effects you need, lol.

Absolutely.  Suffering is myriad and pervasive and perhaps will always be.  On the other hand, we can take action to reduce and maybe even eliminate at least some suffering.  See my friend Robert Daoust's blog  http://aboutsuffering.blogspot.com/ for example.

My question is, despite the continuing suffering in the world, is there reason to be optimistic or will we always spend our lives in the shadow of the lengthy list of "things to be afraid of" which these days with our modern technology we constantly hear about from the media and each other.  

Just this week on the Fox show 24, terrorists attempt to nuke San Francisco.  And the recent local news told me about a fatal shooting and a deadly house fire.  Someone set me an email about how vitamins might really be bad for you.  

The woman that caused my car accident yesterday was so afraid she'd be blamed for a situation which she had obviously caused herself that she was out of control scraming and sobbing and she acted in the most aggressive and bizarre manner.  She was insane with fear.

Yes, I could focus on those fears or I could go sit outside in my garden.

Peace,

Peter

Not to ruin the positive news, but unfortunately these types of acts still occur in countries and cultures that have not gone through reformation and enlightenment. Groups of people that still circumcise women, stone them for getting raped, and do not allow them education. Another practice of killing BORN babies if they are girls also comes to mind and holding dog fights, cock fights, and animal torture for entertainment. So the human race still has a long way to go. But, hey, we are doing WAY better then 100 years ago.

Partially inspired by "Pet Food Scandal"

"In sixteenth-century Paris, a popular form

of entertainment was cat-burning, in which a cat was hoisted in a sling
on a stage and slowly lowered into a fire. According to historian
Norman Davies, "[T]he spectators, including kings and queens, shrieked

with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted,
and finally carbonized." Today, such sadism would be unthinkable in
most of the world. This change in sensibilities is just one example of

perhaps the most important and most underappreciated trend in the human
saga: Violence has been in decline over long stretches of history, and
today we are probably living in the most peaceful moment of our
species' time on earth."

Subject: [sfraves] Searching for a tune "..i've been thinking too much about you...constantly thinking about you.."???

Hi
I heard this awesome track on breaksfm.com today.
beautiful female vocal deep, jazzy, reminds of Nina
Simone a little.
This is the only phrase I caught :
"..i've been thinking too much about you...constantly
thinking about you.."

Anyone know this track ? 
Thanks

He's the lead singer from a 1980's synth-pop band

Oh yes, the good ol' Mena connection.  Similar reports have connected good
ol Jeb and G.W. Bush to personal shipments of cocaine to them back in their

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Thu)

Minor correction via WikiQUote:

"Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase
a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor
Safety."

This statement was used as a motto on the title page
of An Historical Review of the Constitution and
Government of Pennsylvania. (1759) which was
attributed to Franklin in the edition of 1812, but in
a letter of September 27, 1760 to David Hume, he
states that he published this book and denies that he
wrote it, other than a few remarks that were credited
to the Pennsylvania Assembly, in which he served. The
phrase itself was first used in a letter from that
Assembly dated November 11, 1755 to the Governor of
Pennsylvania. An article on the origins of this
statement here includes a scan that indicates the
original typography of the 1759 document, which uses
an archaic form of "s": "Tho&#383;e who would give up
Essential Liberty to purcha&#383;e a little Temporary
Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
Researchers now believe that a fellow diplomat by the
name of Richard Jackson is the primary author of the
book. With the information thus far available the
issue of authorship of the statement is not yet
definitely resolved, but the evidence indicates it was
very likely Franklin, who in the Poor Richard's
Almanack of 1738 is known to have written a similar
proverb: "Sell not virtue to purchase wealth, nor
Liberty to purchase power."
          
Many paraphrased variants derived from this saying
have arisen and have usually been incorrectly
attributed to Franklin:

"They that can give up essential liberty to purchase a
little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor
safety."
                  
"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a
little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor
safety."
                  
"Those Who Sacrifice Liberty For Security Deserve
Neither"
                  
"He who would trade liberty for some temporary
security, deserves neither liberty nor security"
                  
"He who sacrifices freedom for security deserves
neither"
                  
"People willing to trade their freedom for temporary
security deserve neither and will lose both."
                  
"If we restrict liberty to attain security we will
lose them both."
                  
"Any society that would give up a little liberty to
gain a little security will deserve neither and lose
both."
                  
"He who gives up freedom for safety deserves neither"

I downloaded a bunch of Depeche Mode recently to relive my youth, but
I had to swear off of it.. those damn tunes are just too catchy.  i can't
get them out of my head.  But yeah, I didn't even know who that was.  I
only know Martin Gore.

I really hope he names his dishes after their songs.  perhaps a Just
Can't Get Enough buffet?

Okay, yeah, that was stupid.  But I am hitting "Send" anyway.

Man, I was a huge Depeche Mode fan back in the late 80's. But now I can't
seem to get into their songs anymore. Maybe I just listened them out, but
the only album I still like is Violator. Someone really needs to do some
sort of remix using the arpeggio in "Waiting for the night". It would have
a "Boards of Canada" feel to it that could make a great chill out track.

Although I was a huge DM fan, New Order took the cake. I was obsessed with
New Order and still am although less. Funny how most of their songs were
about substances and I never even touched that stuff until much later on in
my life. But then again, music for me has never been about the lyrics, its
all about melody and chord progressions that create feelings. Music does
that. Certain progressions trigger strong feelings from euphoria (New Order
- Ceremony) to nausea (most 80's pop songs).

Not to be pedantic, but music is ephemeral and most meaningful. That is why
I'm here, in more ways then one.

They're almost through reissuing remastered versions of their whole 
catalog:

http://remasters.depechemode.com/

CD, LP, SACD, and DVD in 5.1 surround. If I had a surround system I'd 
definitely check out at least one of the 5.1 releases.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Pet Food Scandal

As in:

You build a little sealed enclosure filled with shallow drainable  
trays and a bug-zapper grate over a narrow slit..
You have a pipe going in to the top with a sealable opening.
Catch some flies and put them inside.
Every time you or your dog takes a shit, smush it up and throw it in  
to the pipe along with some water, then close it back up.
You now have a fly farm.
The flies will buzz around and upon hitting the grate, will fall out  
the opening in to your pond, where you have a bunch of Tilapia ready  
to eat them.

Another variant is to have a secure compost pile where you throw all  
your food scraps, and populate it with worms.
Then you feed the worms to the catfish in the barrels right next to  
the worm farm.

You and your dog now live on fish.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

Is it Friday already?

So I was in a ratty 7-Eleven getting gas yesterday and I don't know if =20
I've told you guys this but pretty much starting after I read that =20
book "Spychips" all about RFID and shit, I pay cash for everything =20
that's not bills or a big ticket item in which case I'll use a credit =20
card, anyway, so I go to pay cash in this gas station, 7-eleven thing, =20
and there's this weird girl in there wearing gas mask insert glasses, =20
a nascar jacket and had a dont mess with texas flag on her truck, or =20
something, anyway, the female version of tacky redneck from hell, =20
she's taking forever telling her story of what kind of glasses she's =20
wearing, I'm hoping sometime I can pay my money and start pumping, and =20
then this lady from the Pizza Hut (she was wearing the uniform) next =20
door starts talking to me, she says in a really loud, manly voice

"HI, HOW YOU DOING?"

and I replied, "fine."

then she said "well I'm just gettin my caffeine fix," holding up a =20
tiny bottle of some kind of jolt caffeine in a vial type of crap they =20
sell at the counter.

so I said really loudly, "WELL YEA THAT'S GOOD, YEA!" with my right =20
hand at my hip and nodding.  i do that a lot these days, we kind of =20
mock this other guy we work with and i guess it's kind of like an =20
inside joke but it's generic enough where you guys might get it and it =20
was just kind of funny because it was a show stopper in the 7-eleven.  =20
well everyone went silent for just a minute and kind of stared at me =20
and cocked their heads about 3 degrees, not as much as a cocker =20
spaniel but definitely noticeable.

the conversation was over after that, unfortunately the gas pump =20
wasn't working, they switched me to another pump, and when i went back =20
in to get my change, it took like 10 minutes.  so 30 minutes later =20
i've got a full tank.  i guess the price of being anonymous in a world =20
of talking big brother cameras and forced HPV vaccines.

this was all on the way to my anger management class.  more on that =20
later.  have a nice weekend.  DF out

for the amount of fish required to feed me and my dog, I don't think 
worms (or flies) can be raised quickly enough.  Energy cannot be 
created or destroyed; recycling is grate, but there has to be other 
sources in the cycle.

The Specialty? It's called "Spanish taster": Stripped
chicken fried on the windscreen with Christmas Island
potatoes, Clean tomatoes, Pimpfed peppers and a
romaine lettuce called "My Secret garden" with some
Blue Dress-ing that will have you Breathing in Fumes.
Not forgetting your dessert called The Sweetest
Perfection. You may try Flies From The Windscreen as a
starter. I'd recommend them tomorrow, But Not Tonight.
Instead of that, you could try Dave's Dirty Sticky
Cider or have absolutely Nothing...

Lillian will be the head waitress. A Two Minute
Warning will sound before closing, at which point
guests will be required to Leave in Silence.
Service is included, because Everything Counts...

Yes.. I am sick, I just can't get enough.

ah, but there ARE other energy sources in the cycle.  don't forget  
sunlight, and air, and water... those are all energy input sources.  
the trick is to create a closed loop system that catches and stores  
all those inputs.

read up on Permaculture design for more techniques.

Philip, if I pooped in your composter, your worms would get sick or high.

And really, wind, hydroelectric, gas, coal, oil, are all solar energy.  
The biggest problem we get into is not that we use oil or anything like 
that, it's the amount we use.  And it's tough to stop.  Most people love 
thier cars.  I love class A tube guitar amps.  Other people love their 
TVs.  All this goes on with us not even thinking about the cost.  If we 
had to ride exercise bikes to generate that power, we'd give up a lot of 
stuff fast.  And we be healthier.

has an extremely unique style that carried over a lot of very innovative

Feh, all this cruft took me back tho when Richard Blade was the morning DJ 
at KROQ, Rodney used to take us into the weekends.  If it ever got too 
wonky, I'd switch up to KUCI which was playing the best punk ever (exposed 
me to vandals, dri, suicidal tendencies, dead kennedys, all that crap).  
I used to give a shit about radio.  Life in a pre Clear Channel world.

I know part of it is just nostalgia, but I don't see 14 year olds boinging 
around to Smashmouth, My Chemical Romance or Britney even close to the 
same thing.

So as a funny side note, I was asked last minute to accompany a friend of 
mine to last weeks My Chemical Romance show in Oakland (someone had 
purchased their kid tickets and then they couldn't go).  I'd seen their 
videos, they were postured, overdressed, and their latest release is 
supposed to be this "rock opera" concept kinda thing.  I figured, it would 
be funny, I'd take BART and just get super stoned.  Except when I got 
there, I realized the kids in the row behind us were there with their 
parents.  And I realized that by my actions I was determining this kid's 
future ability to attend rock shows through their parents perception.  So 
I stayed mostly sober as a judge (had a couple $8 beers...).

And we watched this band that was somewhere between Queen, NIN and like a 
junior version of the New York Dolls.  And yeah, it was horrible.  But the 
songs were about rebellion and self awarenesss, the fists came in the air, 
kids sang along at the top of their lungs with the words they knew by 
heart, the girls screamed, and I guess it was almost like the real thing.  
If the band don't know they're bullshit, and the kids don't know they're 
bullshit, then I guess it's not bullshit after all.

See, in all honesty, I think this is why some people are opposed to 
environementalists.

They think that protecting the environement is a slippery slope to giving
up all modern convience and pooping outside in holes.

Subject: [sfraves] self-sustainability was Re: [sfraves] Pet Food Scandal

neither worms not flies take energy (for livelihood, flies do fly) 
from the sun, the air,. or from water.  I'd need something else to 
feed them, and so many, I might as well have cattle.  I'm not saying 
recycling is bad, or that we shouldn't do all we can, just that 
cutting myself and my pets from the food grid is nearly impossible, 
in an urban environment, as it is now.

I think its too bad they don't show any of the after
products.  Scooping the "brown gold" from the
composter and spreading it in yoiur garden is half the
fun, no?

And they should show the benefits to your flower and
vegetable gardens!  Giant melons!  Huge Cantelopes!

Hmm, maybe that was different product.

   (Pass along if you can!)   Adam, also known as Atom Weaver, or DJ Oracle, of Omniscient Records designed a really amazing bluetooth headset for girls/women. When you wear it it appears as a flower worn in your hair/behind your ear, with the microphone suggestive of a blossoming twig extending from the bloom, across your cheek, to your mouth. The flowers are also interchangeable to match your outfit day-to-day.   There's nothing out there like it. In fact, I haven't really seen any bluetooth headsets that are specifically marketed toward women, other than those merely splashing pink paint on a previous design. They can do better than that and Adam did! :)   Anyway, his school is having a competition and if he wins, he gets a $20,000 scholarship *AND* his design will go into production with Motorola, which means you can get one yourself.   Please vote for Adam's "The Bloom" (link: http://www.nxzen.com/designcontest/view.php?p=3 ) for his sake--- and mine. Haha. I'm dying to get one, especially with the new California law that restricts cell phone calls while driving to hands-free devices only. We all (...well, us girls...) need this!   SO VOTE! :D Adam's is much more innovative than the other designs. He really deserves to win this. Help him out!   http://www.nxzen.com/designcontest/view.php?p=3   Thanks for the support! 
 Heart, Alida

9-11 / Charlie Sheen One Year Anniversary / HR 1022 Gun Ban Bill /  
NAU Slideshow / On Ron Paul for President / Mix	

Mix Track Listing - mix starts at about 17 minutes in and is 45  
minutes long.  BTW speaking of last week's shoddy mix this week ...  
well let's just say it's a good thing to listen to what I'm putting  
out.  I don't know that any DJ can be totally satisfied with what  
they record but hey it's all a learning experience.

If you haven't yet seen this movie, do so.  Truly scary.  One thing that 
woman in this clip should be reminded of is that the "under god" phrase 
wasn't added to the pledge of allegiance until the 1950's.

City Police Spied Broadly Before G.O.P. Convention

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/nyregion/25infiltrate.html

From=20Albuquerque to Montreal, San Francisco to Miami, undercover New
York police officers attended meetings of political groups, posing as
sympathizers or fellow activists, the records show.

They made friends, shared meals, swapped e-mail messages and then
filed daily reports with the department's Intelligence Division. Other
investigators mined Internet sites and chat rooms...

These included members of street theater companies, church groups and
antiwar organizations, as well as environmentalists and people opposed
to the death penalty, globalization and other government policies.
Three New York City elected officials were cited in the reports.

In at least some cases, intelligence on what appeared to be lawful
activity was shared with police departments in other cities. A police
report on an organization of artists called Bands Against Bush noted
that the group was planning concerts on Oct. 11, 2003, in New York,
Washington, Seattle, San Francisco and Boston. Between musical sets,
the report said, there would be political speeches and videos.

"Activists are showing a well-organized network made up of anti-Bush
sentiment; the mixing of music and political rhetoric indicates
sophisticated organizing skills with a specific agenda," said the
report, dated Oct. 9, 2003. "Police departments in above listed areas
have been contacted regarding this event."

Police records indicate that in addition to sharing information with
other police departments, New York undercover officers were active
themselves in at least 15 places outside New York =97 including
California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Montreal, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee,
Texas and Washington, D.C. =97 and in Europe...

The Bands Against Bush site doesn't seem to be up, but here is what it
looked liked in Nov. of 2004

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: My Sat Night/ Sun Morn Adventure

OK.. so i'm kinda warming up here in my absence of my WRs.. ';cause I
looked @ my photo album & realized i hadn't been really posting them & I
seriously feel like i been commiting sin.. so for refresher WR, I'm gonna
talk about what i did this past weekend...

So alota y'all know that I been keeping house pretty much for the past 2
weeks by myself 'cause Mops & Pops went on a 2 week cruise through South
America... & like well.. i was kinda broke until like this past
Friday/Saturday & was pretty much in hell  'cause I didn't have money for
bart & couldn't make it out to where i need to in the previous days i
needed to be & stuff, Hello 2day...

Well... I figured like, "Well... i should walk to the gas station & take
care of my nic & caffine fits".. so i did!  Some of y'all who brought me
home know how far the gas staation is from my pad, so yeah.. it was a nice
2 1/2 mile walk :)

So i had ipod w/ me & took a brisk walk in the early late night/ early
morn... got to the gas station & there were these drunk people hangin out
outside.. after i got my stuff, the drunk girl came up & spoke to me.. her
name is dara & she was this model for hot tropic nights or something..
lol... & she was drunk, so drunk!  She told me about how her & her pose
went bar hopping all over the East Bay from Walnut Creek to Berk & ended
up @ her house in Hercules, then her & drunk dude friend w/ cool piercings
went to the gas station to keep Ben, the worker dude, company!

Anywaze.. so she ended up taking me back to her pad where there were more
drunk people!  Drunk dude guy w/ the cool peircings, actually
http://www.myspace.com/sk4v3ng3r  is his myspace, his GF was in the Family
room swirling around in circles to punk music, dara's bf was in the
kitchen drinking & laughing @ the magnets, & this other girl was there
making puking sounds, but couldn't yak... but yeah.. it was fun getting to
know these people!!  LoL... Dara & i talked alot about like going out,
DJs, & like music... so yeah.. she wants to hang out al next weekend w/ me
'cause i told her where i;ll be going, Evil Breaks & RAW in Sac, & yeah..
so i found a new party hopper to cause mayhem w/ me!

So yeah.... after a few vodka shots, well.. a lot of vodka shots & alot
more talk... all the Drunkie were sleepie & I took that as my que to head
out!  So i actually walked home & the walk was like sooo much longer than
from the gas station... but it was nice tbh!

LoL.. so yeah... that was kinda random & fun!!  But yeah... while i was
gone, my Mom called & left a message on the answering machine saying they
docked in Fla & were boarding a bus to go Miami airpot... LoL... so i
kinda freaked out 'cause well.. there was still a lil more cleaning in the
house i needed to do... didn't get to sleep 'til 9:30AM ('cause I wanted
to watch the Fairly Odd Parents movie on Nick ;)  BUt yeah... that was my
Weekend pretty much!!!

So anywaze... i shall see some of you throughout the week then on the
weekend!!!  I got al whoel lot to catch up on postingwise & a few
CandyFly/ Osby adventures!  Love U all!!!

If you, or anyone you know is looking for more sound reinforcement, please
pass this info along to them  :)    Most of the equipment listed below is
fairly new, we don't have any set prices, but we'll consider any reasonable
offer.

2 Yorkville LS1208P 18" hornloaded subwoofers.  Some minor scratches,
purchased new in spring 2006, have only been used at 3 parties.  These bad
boys kick and run perfect with the QSX plx-3602 putting out 3600 watts of
bass. Please note, these speakers have the heavy duty paint/lacqeur and not
the carpet.  They retail at just under $1000/each.  If you went to last
years 3 year anniversary, you've heard them run at about half their
potential.  For the price, you wont find a sub that puts out this much
bass!  If you need speakon speaker cables, we have these too.

QSC plx-3602    This badboy puts out a whopping 3600 watts in bridge mono
and weighs in at an amazing 22lb.  Has only been used at 3 parties to power
the LS1208's above.  Will consider a package deal with the yorkville
LS1208's.  The PLX-3602 sells for $1200 at guitar center.  purchased new
spring 2006

1 Yorkville LS700PB  powered subwoofer.  Two 10" woofers pack a powerful
punch in this compact powered sub.  Very portable, and weighs in at only
90lb and puts out 700watts.  Retails for $840.  purchased new spring 2006

Subject: [sfraves] UR in SF, Saturday, March 23, DJ S2 from Underground Resistance + Jonah Sharp w/ Mr. Projectile

for those who know...

Saturday, March 31, 2007, 10pm till 4am

downtown SF

Bassaholics Anonymous, Peoplemuver and Subversive
Soundz, present:

UR in SF

Santiago Salazar
(Underground Resistance, Los Hermanos, Galaxy 2
Galaxy, Planet E)
FIRST BAY AREA APPEARANCE!

Jonah Sharp with Mr Projectile
(Reflective) (Semisexual)
LIVE HARDWARE TECHNO SET!

Support from:

James Bass
(Bassaholics Anonymous)

Tomkat
(Subversive Soundz)

ADMISSION:	$10 at the door, $8 in advance

Limited Presale tix available at
bassaholicsanonymous.com

Santiago Salazar, aka DJ S2,is a core member of the
Underground Resistance 'family' of Detroit electronic
artists. Underground Resistance,  also known as UR,
has been on the cutting edge of techno, electro, and
funk representing the Detroit sound the world over.
The Underground  Resistance roster has included such
known fugitives as Jeff Mills, Robert Hood, Dj Rolando
and Mike Banks. Santiago is a core member of the
Galaxy 2 Galaxy and Los Hermanos live UR bands, and
has mixed and edited several UR 12 inches.
His production alias S2 has added a new direction to
the classic UR catalog described as experiments in
acid-funk and creative sampling.  Currently, as  Ican,
Salazar has been releasing quality dance music on Carl
Craig's Planet E label.

Techno innovator Jonah Sharp has recorded several
albums and EPs as Spacetime Continuum and played an
important role in the 90's in consolidating the global
experimental ambient and techno scene through his
Reflective Records imprint.  While his work has been
split over a number of different project headings
(Emit Ecaps, Alien Community, Reagenz, Electro
Harmonix, and others), his most consistently visible
work has been as Spacetime Continuum, most of which
was released by Astralwerks in the US.  He has
performed live electronic music all over the world
including a slot at the very first Detroit Electronic
Music Festival in 2000 curated by Carl Craig and on
Mount Fuji in front of 18,000 people during an insane
torrential rain storm. He has done many fantastic club
nights and is fondly remembered for dropping an "Ass
Bomb" monthly at club 6, bringing out much great
Detroit music.

Mr. Projectile, otherwise known as Matt Arnold,  is an
innovative fusionist of irreverent IDM syncopation.
His work has been released on mass imprints like !K7,
as well as buried labels like Topscore, in addition to
Merck, Toytronic, and his own Semisexual. Mr.
Projectile's live shows summon loft, anti-gravity and
height. For those who have ever pondered the word
"Dance" in Intelligent Dance Music, we challenge you
to witness the sheer brilliance of Mr. Projectile.

Jonah Sharp and Mr. Projectile will be playing a live
all hardware gear set.  Those who heard their set at
1015 last month say it is not to be missed.

James Bass was born inside a bassbin at Castlemorton
Free festival then taken, adopted really by Cuban
parents and sent to the finest socialist education in
the world.  Somehow he ended up washed ashore in San
Francisco at a Reclaim the Streets party dropping mad
leftist booty.  He has been dropping beats on the bay
for the last several years under the name Sexaholic
BassBot, but has stepped into his own as the son of
Bass, respect.

Tomkat, born under a black sun, was orphaned at birth
and was adopted and raised by an alley cat on Albion
Street.  He began his dj career in a truck container
somewhere in Oakland at an early FnF party, and has
played everywhere from radical soup kitchens to the
middle of the street outside the metreon.

Santiago Salazar, aka DJ S2,is a core member of the
Underground Resistance 'family' of Detroit electronic
artists. Underground Resistance,  also known as UR,
has been on the cutting edge of techno, electro, and
funk representing the Detroit sound the world over.
The Underground  Resistance roster has included such
known fugitives as Jeff Mills, Robert Hood, Dj Rolando
and Mike Banks. Santiago is a core member of the
Galaxy 2 Galaxy and Los Hermanos live UR bands, and
has mixed and edited several UR 12 inches.
His production alias S2 has added a new direction to
the classic UR catalog described as experiments in
acid-funk and creative sampling.  Currently, as  Ican,
Salazar has been releasing quality dance music on Carl
Craig's Planet E label.

Techno innovator Jonah Sharp has recorded several
albums and EPs as Spacetime Continuum and played an
important role in the 90's in consolidating the global
experimental ambient and techno scene through his
Reflective Records imprint.  While his work has been
split over a number of different project headings
(Emit Ecaps, Alien Community, Reagenz, Electro
Harmonix, and others), his most consistently visible
work has been as Spacetime Continuum, most of which
was released by Astralwerks in the US.  He has
performed live electronic music all over the world
including a slot at the very first Detroit Electronic
Music Festival in 2000 curated by Carl Craig and on
Mount Fuji in front of 18,000 people during an insane
torrential rain storm. He has done many fantastic club
nights and is fondly remembered for dropping an "Ass
Bomb" monthly at club 6, bringing out much great
Detroit music.

Mr. Projectile, otherwise known as Matt Arnold,  is an
innovative fusionist of irreverent IDM syncopation.
His work has been released on mass imprints like !K7,
as well as buried labels like Topscore, in addition to
Merck, Toytronic, and his own Semisexual. Mr.
Projectile's live shows summon loft, anti-gravity and
height. For those who have ever pondered the word
"Dance" in Intelligent Dance Music, we challenge you
to witness the sheer brilliance of Mr. Projectile.

Jonah Sharp and Mr. Projectile will be playing a live
all hardware gear set.  Those who heard their set at
1015 last month say it is not to be missed.

James Bass was born inside a bassbin at Castlemorton
Free festival then taken, adopted really by Cuban
parents and sent to the finest socialist education in
the world.  Somehow he ended up washed ashore in San
Francisco at a Reclaim the Streets party dropping mad
leftist booty.  He has been dropping beats on the bay
for the last several years under the name Sexaholic
BassBot, but has stepped into his own as the son of
Bass, respect.

Tomkat, born under a black sun, was orphaned at birth
and was adopted and raised by an alley cat on Albion
Street.  He began his dj career in a truck container
somewhere in Oakland at an early FnF party, and has
played everywhere from radical soup kitchens to the
middle of the street outside the metreon.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Alameda late night event cancelled

Alameda torpedoes 'lust, libation' party

Chip Johnson

Tuesday, March 27, 2007

It was to be a night of "lust, libation and laughter," according to
the promoter's Web site, a first-ever Spring Shwing in an old Navy
hangar in Alameda.

Think Exotic Erotic Ball. The same folks who have staged the wildly
popular Halloween-time bash in San Francisco were setting up a
six-hour party planned for this Saturday.

But three weeks ago, it all went poof, like Cinderella's ball.
Partygoers will have to settle for March Madness highlights instead.

On March 9, Alameda city officials notified John Walker, who leases
the space from the city, that the event license had been denied and
the party was canceled.

"The event you have proposed would involve adult entertainment, last
until 3 a.m., include serving alcohol and be open to the members of
the general public through ticket sales over the Internet," wrote City
Manager Debra Kurita, who also serves as executive director of the
Alameda Reuse and Redevelopment Authority.

In other words, the event -- which promised to include "erotic
burlesque, exotic dance, circus sideshows, playful interactive fun,
plus fantasy, fetish and all-out naughtiness" -- was just a bit too
lusty for the East Bay's island city.

The city manager went on to say in her letter that "it is not
generally the policy of the ARRA to lease or license buildings or
space for large evening events open to the general public, especially
those that include the serving of alcohol, live or amplified music or
live entertainment."

The only exceptions to the city's rule have been parties aboard the
Hornet, a decommissioned aircraft carrier at the former base, that
include alcohol and live music and, in some cases, go on well beyond
midnight. The flight deck can accommodate up to 3,000 people.

"That entity has its own use permit and the ARRA has no authority over
them," Lisa Goldman, a deputy city manager, offered Monday.

But the city's decision to reject the Spring Shwing has spawned
finger-pointing from Walker and event promoter Howard Mauskopf -- and
niggling suspicions that the adult theme and promise of scant costumes
played a role in the outcome of this one.

Still, just about every other sentence in city officials' explanations
of the decision in recent days has included the phrase "nothing to do
with content."

Walker, a veteran promoter who goes back to the early days of Bill
Graham-sponsored events, says the confusion is easy enough to explain.

"He (Mauskopf) marketed the show on the Internet before I had a chance
to make a presentation to the city -- or call my landlord, and a few
other people," Walker said Monday. He said he was not provided with
information to answer obvious questions about security, parking -- or
ticket sales.

"I had nothing to propose to them. Ticket sales? I don't know.
Security, parking, I got nothing from them," Walker added.

In a phone interview Monday from Los Angeles, Mauskopf said he
believed he had entered into a contractual agreement with Walker and
expects to be compensated for his expenses. He said Walker has
received a signed contract from him, but has not yet returned it with
his signature.

"Contract law and John are not in sync," Mauskopf said. Walker
disputes the assertion.

Whether a contract exists could well become a legal matter, but city
officials said they learned of the dance when it was advertised via
the Internet.

"They never applied for anything, and we heard tickets were being sold
on the Internet and that's when we got involved," Goldman said. If so,
organizers would have learned that the cards were pretty much stacked
against them from the start.

The proposed dance would have violated a city policy that requires
quiet hours at the base between 12:30 a.m. and 5 a.m. Police received
a license request for the site in mid-March and although they didn't
have adequate time to investigate thoroughly, a cursory review raised
concerns, Lt. Art Fuentes said Monday.

"We looked at what they were proposing, we saw the Internet ads, and
when we spoke with the promoter he could not give us an estimate on
the size of the event," Fuentes said. "We did some checking with other
(police) agencies and discovered that events like this usually require
large police staffing, and there has been a history of tailgate
parties, public drunkenness and sexual assaults."

Alameda is known for a lot of things, but being San Francisco's sister
city isn't one of them. It's described by some of its own residents as
a stodgy, old-fashioned place with a Midwestern atmosphere, not to
mention some lingering conservative political leanings. And they seem
to like it that way.

That's all right, because not every city in the Bay Area has to become
a miniature version of the city by the bay. Not all people who live
outside San Francisco aspire to live there or take their cues from the
latest fashion or cultural trend born there.

And it seems unlikely that a potentially wild event like a Spring
Shwing would fit in a city that sees itself as a small-town enclave
surrounded by an urban skyline.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Alameda late night event cancelled

Having lived in Alameda the majority of my life, I can attest that the 
"content" did not have anything to do with the permit being denied.  No 
event, wether the Hookers Ball, or the HHHH club veggie-feed dinner and show 
would be permitted to go until 3am in Alameda.  Selling hard alchohol ?  It 
better be over by 10pm and then only if it's the annual Elk's Lodge 
fundraiser dance.

Nope, this is a sleepy, sleepy town and they like it that way.  If you think 
they objected to the event because of the content, you are surely right, but 
don't think this is singling out just this event.  Anything racier than the 
current showing of Beauty & The Beast at the old Alameda Theatre would get a 
sneer eye by the government officials and base re-use committee.

I've spent probably 70 cumulative hours writing letters and speaking with 
officials over the phone just to get the reuse commity to allow a grassroots 
low-speed driving event to held there - with zero progress.  Again, the 
annual 50's car show down park street with only Beer & Wine sales, all over 
by 4PM is more this towns speed.

It's part of the charm as well as the frustration with living here.

While growing up I thought "oh, these old farts will die off eventually" but 
I now realize that the only people who stay in Alameda are those hopeful few 
like me who like it's sleepiness and central location and enjoy driving 
across a short bridge or two for my excitment, and those who never want it 
to change.  You can guess the latter are the ones who will forever man the 
stations of the Alameda local government.

Bottomline is this was stereotypical behavior of Alameda and shouldn't be 
considered an issue relating to the "adult" orientation.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Alameda late night event cancelled

Interestingly, when parties had outdoor sound systems
at Home Base, the OPD would often get noise complaints
from the island. We actually had to turn off the
outside sound system we were running at Mega Buzz one
year due to the noise complaints...

As a funny aside... We never had an outside sound
system at our parties at Home Base. But, we succeeded
in getting the most noise complaints from Alameda...
from the RIDICULOUS sound systems INSIDE. Ahhhhh...
the good ole days, when during sound-check, you could
stand in the middle of the room, and watch your
clothes twitch and dance because of the massive amount
of air moving around due to the BASS...

Glory days Eric.
(the following is pure fiction)

I miss dropping the needle on a fresh out of the mailbox test pressing and 
inching up a fader connected to a semi and a half worth of sound gear in 
front of several thousand people.  <Jon Stewart> On weed. </Jon Stewart>

My favorite was how Thunder and Lightning and sometimes JK used to set up 
their stages, with a seperate rise for the DJ to stand on so you could 
dance your ass off while DJing and not cause record skip.  :)

I miss MP-24s with the dip in the crossfader and no EQ per channel and 
headphone cues that could fry an egg.

I miss monitors that took two people to lift.

I miss cutting out a record and hearing a warehouse full of people's feet 
pogoing on dusty concrete for a second.

I miss running into people I'd only seen in magazines or record stores 
trying to get Stacy or Vlad to pay me.

I miss crew laminates.

I miss a whole chill room cooing along in bliss to a melody from my first 
chill room live PA.

I miss the jog I used to take around Jack London Square first couple times 
I played at 2nd and Jax to take the nerves off.

I miss prop making parties in my back yard.

I miss the way it sounded when a DJ I didn't know dropped one of my tracks 
on a big system.

I miss thinking about how much wood you need to build a frame for a giant 
mylar covered ufo.

I miss having a paper macheie mushroom in the front yard of Cupertino 
Heights (the old house) for months.

I miss being able to go all weekend and still somehow wake up for work on 
monday.

I miss ridiculous Rainbow Brite lookalikes grabbing my wrist to adorn me 
with candy while I play some scorching evil shit.

I miss hearing a new record on a big sound system and going to the store 
on monday after work and seeing if they had another copy cause I just 
loved it that much loud.

I miss my brown NeverWorry hoodie.

I miss the records they stole.

I miss being in the checkout line at Home Depot as they ring up $2100 in 
extension cords, staple guns, steel cable & turnbuckles, fire 
extinguishers, zip ties, tools and day glo flag twine... wearing JNCOs and 
sunglasses and paying cash.

I miss reviews where people would go on about what a great time they had, 
and how it was ridiculously cheap and obviously done for the love.

I love calling up and asking for "two of the biggest trucks you got for a 
class C licence".

I love getting my gear home and realizing some guy I have 15 records from 
just played on those turntables and that mixer *right there*.

I miss getting a contract rider from a DJ that said "Overnight 
Accomodations: Prepaid single occupancy hotel preferred, but couch (no 
scabies, no fleas) is acceptable".

I miss the sound of a room full of people that couldn't think of leaving 
early cheering as we open up the side doors of the armory to let the 
sunrise in.

I miss the morbid humor of cleanup by a posse of jaded people who are 
beyond exhaustion.

I miss the look on everybody's face when you'd bring cold non-shwaggy beer 
to a particularly hot warehouse setup.

I don't miss shady dealers, hypocritical promoters, sellout bitch DJs, 
groupies who just don't listen, people who had a narrow mind to any 
deviation from their agenda, kids with saucers for pupils and varying 
symptoms of malnutrition, dehydration and mental distress all over their 
faces.  I don't miss kicking people out, turning kids away, inter promoter 
political shibby, and fire marshalls who want grease.  I don't miss $3 
water or a total doublespeak when people throwing parties called 
"MegaBuzzOnE" claimed to not allow drugs in or even throw raves (it's a 
festival... of OnE-ness I guess).  I don't miss city officials lying about 
permits processes, or what they are and are not ok with.  I don't miss the 
acts, I don't miss the hype, I don't miss all the people who had so much 
to say when they were just wearing furry overalls a couple months before 
(yes, myself included).  I don't miss having to work with people who were 
all love and smiles and you couldn't trust for a second.  I didn't like 
Vlad sometimes, but sometimes I disliked his detractors even more.  I 
didn't like being told that this door must be kept unlocked by one person 
that can shut your party down, and must be locked by another with the same 
abilities.  I didn't like how massives would tear collectives apart and 
force them to pick less and less people who could be trusted with so much.  
I didn't like the point in time after you'd paid so much money out that 
you couldn't not throw the party.  I didn't like investors.  I didn't like 
weird messages on the voicemail threatening us.  I didn't like having to 
watch my gear like a hawk when I'd play live.  I don't miss the people 
that used this list for promotion but couldn't tell the truth about the 
same parties they were promoting.  I didn't like being handed a backpack 
and being told cops are here, act like you paid to get in.  I never liked 
having to explain to a cop what was going on here, when they knew and I 
knew and it was a funny little sparring match.  I never liked the radical 
difference between what we were held accountable for, and what we actually 
had control over.  I never liked paramedics taking away that kid.  Never 
was a big fan of how a couple of the local clubs would slam raves for 
being unsafe and illegal.  Never did like Maritime Hall (although the 
little Filipino karaoke across the street was THE PRE-SHOW BOMB).  Always 
thought it was funny that one of the people who argued most with me on the 
list would call me up and share party ideas to see what I thought.  I 
don't miss making a buck or two remastering and even editing other DJs 
"for promotional use" mixtapes (yeah, nice "skills" there).  I didn't like 
competing in an artistic circle for bookings with people who faked a lot 
of shit.  I never liked having to feel like a criminal because I wanted to 
throw a party that went after some peoples' bedtime.  Always felt weird 
about how a lot of the people who had the spotlight often didn't seem to 
love the music the way some of us did.  Never did feel right how some DJs 
changed their minds about what genre they felt like sharing while behind a 
cash register.  Never did like hoochies on flyers.  Never liked how 
massive promoters would shit on undergrounds, and to a lesser degree vice 
versa.  Never liked velvet ropes, vips, and people who got waved through.  
Never liked how often I'd see torches at afterparties.  Never did believe 
that Mars believed in the 8th frequency as much as he wanted others to.  
Never did like that sticky shit all over every single cable in the place 
by morning.  Never did like the fact that to do what you felt was right 
past a certain scale, you almost had to be in bed with the people who you 
felt did it wrong.  I didn't like it when DJ tapes and massive presales 
outsold records at my local record shop.  I don't miss seeing some of my 
friends go crazy, go deaf, or just go.  I didn't like seeing expensive 
water being sold at a party I volunteer crewed at.  Never liked seeing a 
pile of huge flyers on top of a storm drain.  Never liked the fact that if 
you couldn't afford to lose every penny you put into a party, you always 
ended up having to compromise somehow sooner or later.

Those were incredible times, we did amazing things, I never wanted it to 
end.  And I'm glad it did.

  I think it was your house, Andy, that we were making those Stonehenge repliclas at for the Harmony 5 Year. Ah, good times. That party was going to be the best ever and ended up being such a bummer.
   
  And that black stuff that got all over everything at warehouse parties...we used to call it rave funk. Blecth!

Glory days implies that I, like the character from
"Daized and Confused," sit around hoping beyond hope
that some day I will return to high school football
and throw the winning touchdown for the State
Championship. If this is how you see me Andy, you are
sadly mistaken. Although, from your editorialized
responses to many of my posts, I don't think it is
very un-clear, that for some reason, you don't like
me. I'll reply to that, and the rest, privately.

Glory, Gig-swapping, editing, 300K flyers, taking
credit for others accomplishments, paying people
shitty, doing $300K parties for $100K, investors, not
out-doing yourself at every opportunity: Those were
all things I forsook. Rumors, want, greed,
manipulation, envy, and jealousy may have colored me
otherwise. But, the rants of Harry Who? and anyone
else do not a person make. I sleep well knowing how I
treated and paid people, how far out-done each event
we ever did was, how seriously we took our REAL
mantras, and how gross the other side of the scene
was.

Like I said, the good-ole days. A time to remember
fondly. A time to remember as you wish. The PAST. But
for me, certainly not THE GLORY DAYS.

Erm, nope.  Read me totally wrong.  The "glory days" comment was my email 
equivalent of a knowing smile, "raising my beer can" if you will before 
waxing nostalgic myself.

I honestly figured maybe you and a handful of people would get this (there 
aren't that many people on this list who have DJed on big guns to 1000+ 
people, were involved with large parties in the late 90s, dealt with 
Homebase or 85th and Baldwin, etc).

At no point did I even come close to mentioning Harry Who, I never singled 
you out.  As for liking or not liking you... we've talked, never felt like 
you thought much of me but we had some good friends in common and that's a 
long way down the road from dislike.

I posted what I did because I didn't want to see people gush over how 
great the massives were without at least a semblance of the price.  They 
were a very two sided beast that ate too much and shat too much to 
possibly survive without a constant flow of new faces to feed it 
enthusiasm and $20s... while at the same time something of incredible 
power and occasionally even beauty.  I said what I said, in what I felt 
were clear words.  I'm glad I was there, but it didn't seem like it could 
go on like that for long.  Some promoters managed to sustain some degree 
of integrity through it (I'll go so far as to cite you and Martin), but 
most didn't.

peace

Well I LIKE YOU BOTH & think YOU BOTH made COUNTLESS contributions to the scene we all cherish(ed). Living in Stockton during the late 90's before I moved out to the Bay, I was forced to look up to you guys because you BOTH gave me a good reason to flee from a small world not many people know how to get out of. . . So thanks. THANK YOU ALL ON SFR FOR THAT MATTER.

And while we're at it:

THANK YOU BUZZLINE. THANK YOU SF, OAKLAND, RICHMOND, SANTA CRUZ, SANTA ROSA, AND EVEN SAN JOSE. THANK YOU FTT, HARMONY, SKILLS, SPACE CHILDREN, CLOUD FACTORY, AND CLOCKWORK (DOWN THE LINE), JUST TO NAME A FEW. . .

Pack that in your pipes & smoke it, toke it, or choke it what have you.

BTW, Andy, I miss & don't miss the same shit you do. Seriously, you spoke for many. And props where due, Eric, I meant it when I said awhile back that one of your sets I saw @ Quest was of the highest caliber I've ever seen. 

peace

chuck

Erm, nope.  Read me totally wrong.  The "glory days" comment was my email 
equivalent of a knowing smile, "raising my beer can" if you will before 
waxing nostalgic myself.

I honestly figured maybe you and a handful of people would get this (there 
aren't that many people on this list who have DJed on big guns to 1000+ 
people, were involved with large parties in the late 90s, dealt with 
Homebase or 85th and Baldwin, etc).

At no point did I even come close to mentioning Harry Who, I never singled 
you out.  As for liking or not liking you... we've talked, never felt like 
you thought much of me but we had some good friends in common and that's a 
long way down the road from dislike.

I posted what I did because I didn't want to see people gush over how 
great the massives were without at least a semblance of the price.  They 
were a very two sided beast that ate too much and shat too much to 
possibly survive without a constant flow of new faces to feed it 
enthusiasm and $20s... while at the same time something of incredible 
power and occasionally even beauty.  I said what I said, in what I felt 
were clear words.  I'm glad I was there, but it didn't seem like it could 
go on like that for long.  Some promoters managed to sustain some degree 
of integrity through it (I'll go so far as to cite you and Martin), but 
most didn't.

peace

with style......


Our Headliners:

Deekline w/MC Ivory - UK
(Botchit & Scarper/Rat Records/Hardcore Beats)

Deekline started collecting records as a youngster, inspired by funk
and electro, before becoming interested in hardcore and jungle. His
first release was the immense "Don't Smoke (Da Reefer)", a bass-heavy,
two-stepping beat monster with the catchiest vocal line ever =96 it was
the first record put out on the newly-formed Rat Records, an imprint
which still continues to churn out top-quality releases at the
forefront of breaks and booty bass.

Further tracks with legends like Arthur Baker and Rennie Pilgrem and
other groundbreaking producers like Donna Dee and Freq Nasty sealed
Deekline's reputation as a leading light in the UK dance music scene =96
a reputation helped along by the chart success of "Don't Smoke", which
went to number 11 in the charts, and which led to Wu Tang Clan-member
and twisted genius Ol' Dirty Bastard asking for an official remix of
his track "Want Your Money".

At the same time, Deekline was livening up breaks in the UK, shaking
up the sedentary nu-skool scene and twisting out the fattest basslines
in the club nights he put together - Breakbeat Connection and Thursday
Night Throwdown, both of which are still among the best and most
exciting nights out to be had in the capital.

Subject: [sfraves] Access Virus A for sale.

Hey Gear nuts,

I just ran across my ol access virus A that I had in a box in my garage and 
since I don't use it anymore I figured I might as well sell it. Asking price 
$300 which seems about average compared to ebay,craigs etc.. Only thing is, 
you have to come to the san jose area to pick it up. No dropoffs at your 
crib etc.

My digital camera is on the frits so no pics sorry :-( but the condition is 
good barely used all knobs still stiff and no paint "Fades" or 
"discoloration's" of any kind.

If interested hit me up.

Macadio

I've got you covered homie; gold tips, length & all.  CATCH: I'm in San Jose. . . If you can pick them up, they're yours for the week. I'll be up " *in the city* " next weekend and can pick them up then.

peace

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Sunset Season Opener

Sunset is usually held in Marin County at Stafford
Lake in Novato and sometimes in SF at various
locations...

http://www.co.marin.ca.us/depts/PK/Main/pos/pdstaffordlke.cfm

starts at 11AM and goes until 7PM.

Rule reminders from the Pacific Sound crew:

They don't allow pets in the park and if you bring one
you won't be admitted.  Don't bring Fido.

The sherrif is going to be out there looking for drunk
drivers so designate a driver.  This always a good
idea anyway.

The park is a protected watershed so absolutely no
peeing in the bushes!  They have extra porta-poddies
this year, but I advise you to pee early and often to
avoid the lines ;)

Finally, smoking isn't allowed in Marin parks, but I
gather they don't intend to enforce this too much. 
Smoking in designated areas only.  Not sure how
they'll be designated tho!

As has been the case for at least a couple of years
the rangers are not sure they'll let the party
continue at this location if a lot of people are
breaking the rules, leaving trash, etc.  

Pix from last year's opener:

Peace,

Peter

P.S. Last time I saw Tony Hewitt spin was at the bar
Blue in Miami during WMC 2001!

Subject: [sfraves] thanks from Evil Breaks

super huge thanks to all of you that came out last night. it was a
really warm, fuzzy feeling to see all of you. the past 3 years of Evil
Breaks has been an incredible experience: emotionally, physically and
psychologically (i swear i've lost my mind a few times).

our anniversary party was our chance to give something back to you.
thank you all so much for your loving support of our little crew.

lots of photos:

Mission Arts & Performance Project=20
Introduces
The Image and The Real

A RFCL Production


You are invited to enter an experimental space where creation will be =
taken
out of the hands of the elite few
and restored to the community.=20
Join us in the hospitality of L's Caf=E9 as we weave music and imagery,=20
improvised theatrics and sound into a seamless tapestry.

Where is the line between creator and created; observer and observed?

Within this unique gathering you will be asked to cross the line
and become an active element within a living work of art.

The music of Kyron sets the stage,
opening a chamber of childlike discovery, and prelinguistic expression.

You will be ushered in and invited to play by strange apparitions,
your guides in this twilight space between the Image and the Real.


This event is free and open to the public. Pay with your Presence.


Saturday, April 7th
Time 7pm-10pm
At L's Cafe
2871 24th St, San Francisco, 94110
