Subject: Sea-Monkey Love Castle review

Full blown, balls to the wall, we had our "zenith rave" planned for October
10th, when we managed to find a four story building (with basement) in
downtown Salt Lake City.  The "Sea-Monkey Love Castle" was easily our biggest
rave yet, and probably our biggest rave ever.

A friend who owns a clothing shop connected us with the guy who supposedly was
a co-owner of this building.  We managed to strike a reasonable deal and
started to plan things.  Two flyers were sent out, a week after each other.
The first was rather vague and required some thought, but the second was the
standard glitz.  The building required a lot of work.  There was not only an
entire rotten side that needed to be blocked off, but a ton of trash and
garbage that needed to be hauled out.  A lot of painting was required too, but
since it was an old paint company, we had plenty of that lying around.

The basement would be given to two DJ friends of mine.  They had done a techno
club back in February, and even though they had given me the shaft, I didn't
do the same for them.  I rented the sound and the lights, and they just had to
decide what to do with it.  The found a guy who did some rather fantastic
graffiti art with some spray cans.  I had never seen anything like it.  Really
psychedlic images.  Then they had just two lights and a fog machine.  The
minimalistic feeling of the basement really worked well.  Too bad their sound
didn't.  After about an hour of running during the night, the midrange and
highs got really muddy.  I had been down there earlier to check things, and
there was no way they had blown the speakers, but still they were screwed up
somehow.  Thankfully, the guy who did our computer video had some extra
speakers that we were able to replace the bad ones with.

The first floor was fairly empty.  It just required some blocking off and
opening of the rear entry for the main entry.  We also painted the loading
dock where people would come in blue and orange with white stripes.  It looked
100% improved.  I didn't put the large room to any sort of use, but some guys
did later in the night.  They did sort of an acapella chorus that certainly
took me by surprise.

The second floor was the ambient floor.  We cleaned it out, painted it, and
brought in old couches and furniture that we scavenged from "big trash day"
that was happening in a posh section of town.   For lighting, we took several
broken television sets and placed them around the level.  The smartbar and
concessions were also setup on this level as well.  One black light was all
that was needed to finish this off.  In addition, I invited a friend who had
sort of a percussion ensemble art band to come and play.  They did so most of
the night, but nobody really seemed to get off on it.

Third floor was the paint floor.  120 feet of black paper was purchased and we
covered a wall with it.  In the end, people painted all over the black paper
and everywhere else.  We had to repaint the walls when we were done.

Top floor was my floor.  Everything was cleared out and I setup the DJ booth
using an old white door and several display blocks.  For lighting, I used two
helicopters, the laser, and a fantastic liquid light projector.  While we were
working on the building a week before, a friend who does video dances
expressed interest in doing something for us.  Using two 25" monitors on the
top floor, then putting his projection TV on the ambient floor, by running
about 50 feet of cable down the outside of the building, we were able to come
up with a rather impressive video setup.  He then used the mindlight from my
Amiga and the Video Toaster on his Amiga to do some mindblowing effects.  For
the first part of the evening, people would stroll into the mostly empty
floor, ignore the music and just gape at the monitors.  He also mixed in live
video from the dance itself, as well as running around with a camera through
the whole building, then mixing that in as well.  Out of all the work we did,
the video received the most comments.

Eric Pederson (DJ Spaul) from California drove in to see what we were doing as
well as spin a few sets.  What is up with you folks out there?  Use this guy!
He went over like a star here and did some really fine work.  In addition to
Eric, a friend who has a radio show on public radio did a short industrial set
that went over well.  I also let my neighbor who used to DJ in Arizona spin
for a while.  He did some really great booming slow songs.  It was nice to be
able to run around and enjoy the rave for myself rather than being locked in
the booth all night long.  It was also nice to be able to meet, and (ahem)
dance with a certain female.

The cops did arrive.  At about 4:00 AM, the Marriot across the street
complained and they came in.  Due to some smooth talking via my friend Dan,
they just told us to turn down the volume a bit.  Of course we were threatened
with jail if they had to return, but we were more than happy to obliged with
the volume.  What was amazing was the fact that they toured the whole building
before leaving.  There were bottles and cans strewn EVERYWHERE.  I guess they
can't do anything if they come for one reason and find another.

As for the person we rented from, he turned out to be a complete asshole.  He
guest listed a dozen people, then invited another 20 from the bar across the
street.  We found out later that he was down at another place telling people
there was a rave going on his building and people could get in for free.  Our
guest list consisted of about seven people.  It was like the landlord inviting
people to stay at your house, then being rude to your friends.  But he wasn't
the landlord!  We found out mid-day that the real owner didn't even know what
was going on and we were risking him finding out.  This guy was only the
tenant.  If the landlord did find out (and he did find out after the fact)
then we would have been shut down, out about a thousand dollars.  We got our
revenge in the end though, we shafted the asshole his percentage and took
everyone to dinner on it.

Another hitch with the building was the fact that there wasn't any plumbing or
power.  I had to rent portable toilets as well as a mutherfcking HUGE 60KW
generator.  Needless to say, we had more than enough power, but people still
pissed in dark corners.  There were also several rushes on the door.  We
estimated about 50 people (including the 30 due to the asshole) got in for
free.  There was a lot of "licking the stamp" trick as well.  Next time I want
to put collars on people's necks to indicate the fact that they have paid.  I
was down at the door for a brief period helping out, when a guy walked by me.
I grabbed his arm and said "let me see your stamp".  He said, "I've already
been stamped, I'm in the band."  I told him there wasn't any band and he
turned around and walked out.  What I saw was minor in comparison to what
everyone else had to deal with.

John's and his mother's car had their car windows broken by people throwing
bottles out of the top of the building.  Other than that, there weren't any
incidents.  One guy got paint all over his clothes by accident and blamed us.
We gave him $20, then he grabbed another $20 from the cash box and left.

All in all, it was a fantastic rave.  People are still praising it.  One
comment a friend heard a record store on Monday was from someone who had been
living in LA for the past year.  He said he had gone to a lot of raves then,
but he had never seen anything like what we had pulled off.  Needless to say,
I felt 20 feet tall at that point.  It was also very satisfying to see not
only the employees, but the owner of the half-million dollar "new club in
town" show up and join in the dancing multitude on the floor.  Even though it
was such a success, I don't ever want to use that building again.  I don't
know if I'll ever do anything on the same scale either.  Of course, I'll
probably feel different the next time someone brings me a five story building
on a platter.

The latest from the frontlines: a guy just asked me if I had heard about this
new show on Fox called -you'll never guess- RAVE... Supposedly this is some kind
of show at Midnight on the weekends that is supposed to be a Soul Train type 
thing (although I doubt if any soul is involved here) with dancers showing off
their latest 'rave moves'. Next cooption victim, please nurse - We already took
care of rap and that pesky 'Seattle scene'. 
I'll have to go over to someone's house with a TV to see this latest travesty,
perhaps an SFraves watching party - oh lord have mercy what has become of this

Subject: Re: FMR and a FMR casualty


I've got Red Cross Wilderness / Advanced First Aid certification, 
a kit, and will be at the next FMR if possible.  BTW, putting any
"burn ointment" on a burn victim, especially a dirty 3rd degree burn,
is a definite nono.  If you've got clean water, wash it off,
but NEVER put anything but water or sterile bandages on burns 8-)

Some quick suggestions for the organizers, which I'm happy to
discuss in more detail off the list:
1) Have at least one person there a designated medic.  You might want to
	let them in free, as discussed here.
2) Make sure there's a PA system available in case an announcement
	has to be made.  Make sure all the DJs are willing to stop for a sec
	in that case.  If one isn't, rethink ever inviting them...
3) Have communications.  Either have someone with a cellular phone
	there or find a ham radio type willing to show up.  The
	communications delay of driving into town in an emergency is
	sometimes fatal.
4) Think about having some "security" people designated, more from the
	"helping ravers" viewpoint than anything else.  One medic can't
	control someone dancing around on a bad trip hurting themselves,
	and you can't always count on bystanders being able to help.
	Besides, it looks good to cops if you have someone who's doing
	"security" 8-)

Having someone there with an in-car first aid kit is a good idea.
Anyone who's planning on being there with one should contact the organizers
or the medic when they get there so that the right people know who to ask for
if it's needed.  

minor note: someone earlier said that the Red Cross Wilderness advanced
course was more oriented at outdoors situations than the normal advanced
course areas.  In reality, the wilderness course I took covered the entire
normal advanced first aid course as well as wilderness situations and
equipment.  It's more, not different 8-)

I've listened to the KZSU (90.1) Tuesday techno show a couple of times
now, and it's been pretty good.  This week they had Spun and a few
weeks ago they had Rick Preston.  I guess it's noon to 3; they also
give away tickets to the BIG raves that you probably wouldn't want
to pay to go to (read: Sharon).  But they also said they would have
tickets for Basics in one of the upcoming shows.  You have to answer
questions that SFRavers probably know the answer to, like "where
was the last full moon rave" :) .  

If any of you SFRavers who work at KZSU are able to get advance notice
of who's DJing this show each week, can you post it?  Thanks.

sorry about the jokes but i see one main problem with the notion of this conference
thing. I am proud of reading SF_Raves becasue it is a not for profit body. What bounds
us is the fact that we like the idea of raves not the killing we can make in one night.
so, do you think other promoters believe in this? Hah. I am afraid not. Do you think that
those promoters would give a shit about anybody being DOSED. It goes without saying that
Geoff and Brian have done what they have because of something other than profits.

Lets face it.
There are two scence that out there. One is the mega-bucks big business rave and the other
is more like Alternity/Connections. Which scene are we trying to protect and save? 

Listen, why not ease on the structure and make it a casual get together to share experiences.
to talk about and plan other Connections or enhancements to SF_Raves. to give some form to
Alternity.

Or just make a rave conference for those looking for a career in promoting raves and making
lots of money. I just don't see the two aspects going together very well.

I'm not sure that anyone treats raves as an ultimate solution to anything.

I have found that in raving, and in my life, seriousness and funness can
exist side by side.  At the fringes of knowledge, I have found a lot of paradox
and absurdity.  What I like about raves is that it brings together things
from a wide range of human culture.  For me, raving is a celebration of life, 
of existence, and all the contradictions that go with it.

No one is forcing you to focus the part of raving that connects some people
to areas of "academic" knowledge.  When the psychedelic image on the screen
shows factals superimposed on top of a photograph of a galaxy, look the other
way.

Sure, why not?  If raving can be used by some as a tool toward understanding
various belief systems, what's the problem?  You sound almost paranoid about
people having their minds opened through raving.

I see.  You'd travel across the country for a fun party with the smiley
buttons and Dr. Seuss fashions, but if it involves any kind of quest for
knowledge you'll just stay home and watch cartoons.  Well, each to their
own.  I know that ignorance can be bliss, but the search for knowledge *can* 
be fun.  In my book, the more ways to have fun, the better.

OK.  But haven't you noticed that many of the images ravers seem to get
off on have some very obvious links to science and other aspects of
culture that go beyond the partying motif of raving?  As far as I can
remember, the tie-in between raving and science, technology and exotic
culture has always been there, even if only tenuously.

> I believe it shouldn't be used as a tool for PUSHING a belief system.

I agree completely.  Nothing should be pushed.

> What
> you seem to believe is that "new age" beliefs and raves go hand in hand.

Well no.  I simply believe that the exploration of consciousness and raves
go hand in hand.  If this includes checking out "new age" concepts for
some people, fine.  Personally, I find the bulk of "new age" philosophy
not to be very worthwhile.

I have no problem enjoying a rave as a simple party.  In fact, there can
be a lot of pretentiousness with people who attempt to overdo the
intellectual angle.  Nevertheless, most raves I enjoy create an atmosphere
of openmindedness which *can* (i.e. doesn't have to) lead to some interesting
mental explorations.

>Your use of character attack is rather pathetic.

What I attack is your a belief system that seems to propose limitations
on what the rave experience should be for some of us.  I have never
been to a rave where I felt that any concept was ever "pushed" on anyone.
I'm not even sure what it is you're so concerned about. 
 
> In this case though, there should be more escapism and euphoria, instead of

If you'd open your eyes a little, you'd see that science, belief systems,
etc. can be euphoric and escapist for some people.  We're all doing the
same thing, only differently. :-)

  You may not be alone, but there's definitely a crowd on the other side of
the fence.  According to Vitamin B's survey, a very substantial number of
SFR people have edu. tags to their logon names.
  Pete, I've read your reviews and I know you care a lot about raves and
the music scene.  But why be so exclusive?  Why constrict a movement so
clearly dedicated to openness? If a bunch of my fellow jugglers showed up
at a rave and started passing balls and clubs, would you tell them it's
"inappropriate"? Would you shut the door on Joe Lawyer and Jane Realestate
just because they came to a rave to boogie down? Why keep out the profs
and students who are trying to fit the rave scene into he rest of their lives
too?

Subject: Conference

Excuse my cynicism, but aren't we going overboard here?  I'm afraid that I
view this "rave conference" on the same level as attempting to hold a "punk
consortium" in 1980.

I was interviewed recently for a local newspaper.  The reporter kept trying to
get me to connect universal conciousness with raves.  I don't see it.  Why do
I do raves?  Why do I go to raves?  It's fairly simple.  They're fun.  This
business of treating raves as the ultimate solution to all our problems
borders on the ridiculous.  Ravers are a small percentage of the population,
and even a smaller percentage of ravers have changed their attitude about
society due to raves.  On top of that, adding this layer of seriousness
destroys what I like best about raves.  The fact that they're almost comical.
After seven years of watching people dress in black, it is a relief to see
someone dressed in stripes wearing a cat in the hat hat.

Putting this on the level of a hacker conference does not justify it.  Hacking
in a sense, is an academic pursuit, a quest for knowledge.  The day that raves
become academic is the day I look for something else to do.

Also, connecting raving with any sort of new age activity makes me want to
barf.  Why not connect it with Muslim, Christian, or Buddhist tradition?  It's
on the same level.

Now, if you were to attempt to organize a rave with the same people, inviting
people from all over the country to come, then you'd have something.  Several
promoters around the country have attempted to arrange a "Woodstock"
situation, but I haven't been tempted to travel to any of them.  If you could
not only get the best DJs, but the best bands (there are a few who put on good
live performances), then I'd travel from coast to coast to get there.

I believe it shouldn't be used as a tool for PUSHING a belief system.  What
you seem to believe is that "new age" beliefs and raves go hand in hand.  I'm
not paranoid about people opening their minds.  I'm disgusted with people
pushing their belief systems as a logical extension of rave culture.  As for
"new age" opening your mind, I won't even go into that, suffice to say that I
hold that culture lower than any religion.

Am I alone in the belief that raves shouldn't involve academics?  If Timothy
Leary was lecturing before a rave, I'd arrive late.  Do you degrade a rave as

Has anyone noticed that at raves in the SF area these days, there are fewer and
fewer people wearing 'carnival' clothes that a good portion used to wear until 
as late as about 6 months ago.  I would say there's way more people at raves,
even the smaller ones, wearing black these days.  The clothes people are 
wearing these days seem to be more 'stylish trendy' rather than the comical 
costumes a lot of ravers were wearing a while back.  What happened?  I'm not
disapproving of this (even though personally, I liked the carnival clothes 
better), I'm just making an observation.

	is one senseless death for someone falling or having a heart attack

	As far as hacking is concerned, well to me and many other old

	sacrificed our "academic" careers for "Hacking".

	Ask yourself this, would you trust your life to a surgeon that

In defense of the conference:

	The point is not to make it academic, but to try and preserve the
scene here.  You've been on the list sionce day one, Pete:  you've read all
the stories about raves getting busted, about promoters who care more for
the greenback than the heart, and other things.  If the promoters don't
start communicating and understand that their actions CAN result in a
complete crackdown on raves a la UK 1991, then the scene here is bound to
fall.  It's not a crisi situation yet; but we want to help make sure that
itm doesn't become one.  I would probably have said the same thing as  you
before the charity event last month... but that event was the first one where
so many different promoters came together, and at the planning meeting talk
did turn to the future, about wanting to make sure that parties are done
_right_, that the "image" of raves in the public eye is good, or at least
not bad.  You're right, it is just about having fun, and the day it stops
being fun I'll quit.  But I can't help but feel that something could be
accomplished by bringing the promoters together and trying to form bridges.
We're not going to say that promoters shouldn
't compete against each other, that 
they shouldn't do this for a living.  They gotta put bread on their tables,
I'm fully aware of that, and if they put on a good event they deserve to get
paid for it.  But when promoters flaunt the police and fuck with the raver,
then things go downhill.  

	Maybe our ego has gotten the better of us.  So we throw one good event
and we think we're promoter-gods, you might think.  Maybe we are getting in
over our heads.  But Geoff has talked with a few other promoters, and this
idea of having an get-together for promoters rang true with them too.  I mean,
it can't hurt.

Here is a prime example of what can be done with a little political pressure.
Of course if you are 18 you can go to Iraq and get shot at, maybe killed.
Go to adult jail if you do something wrong but you can't dance after 2:30

THIS IS BULLSHIT!!1

Luckily there is one more think that an 18 year old can do... VOTE.

Call up your supervisor if you live in SF.  Call the mayors office.

Tell them you vote and you want this law repealed or you won't vote
for them anymore and furthermore if they are not interested, maybe you'll find
the candidate that is interested and that you'll register all of your raver friends and have them vote for someone who will repeal this law.

This being an election year, we CAN definately make a difference at the local 
level.

I think Pete is seeing something in the conference that i am not

Miscommunication is the greatest of evils in society today.

Just a thought on this conference thing.
In LA all the promoters got together once and from the sounds of
it, they all agreed to support each other and not try to get
each other busted by the cops (as has been done, there was a war
between two promoters where each would call in the cops on the others
event, another time one group accused another of kidnapping someone
and over the same event, a guy ended up with a bullet hole in his front
door...)
BUT i also have the feeling that they made agreements like
base pricing for raves and other stuff,
how often they would hold them and
a ton of other ways to rip off people
like is done in other businesses

just make sure that this doesnt happen, 
i know its not your goal to have this happen
but if you got everyone together, it could
spend more time on finding ways to lobby against
the people who make permits impossible or too fucking expensive to get

This isn't what I was trying to state.  I welcome everyone and anyone to the
raves I throw.  I encourage and am encouraged by people who do their own thing
at them.  I guess I was just a little put off by the suggested "agenda" for
the conference.  Having so many how-to's makes it seem almost like a Amway
festival and not a get-together.  Thowing in "Getting In Tune With Your
Chakra" makes me wonder what the point behind the entire conference is anyway.

I'd like to see a promoter/DJ/whatever get-together, but much more informally.
A day of swapping stories, tips, and phone numbers, then a night of raving.  I
went to a rave in Colorado and the best part was the fact that I got into
simple contact with the other promoters.  The best part of one of my
California trips was meeting Brian, the rave we went to was a real loss.
Renting a ranch, having seminars, and spending three days together is a big
yawner for me.  You must admit there is an incredible overtone of seriousness
towards the conference.

"WE MUST DO THIS IF THE SCENE IS TO SURVIVE!"  The only way you'll get the
police to cooperate is if you get licenses, then have your token rent-a-cop
standing around.  As Thrash once said, "How can you have a rave with cops?"
I've been extremely lucky to not have any problems with the police (well, at
least not major problems).  However, even if I did have a problem, it wouldn't
stop me from throwing another one.  The greater dangers to raves are
commercialism and public acceptance.  It's happened in LA and is starting to
happen in San Francisco by all accounts.  The better raves are deeper
underground and smaller.  I'd rather throw one in a tiny basement for 20
people than cooperate with the radio stations to throw one for 5000.

I kinda like the idea of a conference, but would swing more towards a more 
casual get to know everyone type more than a structured conference with
workshops and all that stuff.  I attended the SPEW II conference in LA in
February, and had a great time because rather than having workshops, we 
performances by various attendies in one room (which could be anything), and
tables for all the attendies to sell merchandise and stuff to make a little 
bit of money to cover the costs of traveling to LA, we sold some t-shirts, 
we didn't cover our costs, but we had a great time, swaped t-shirts with 
others and got to know everyone.  This lasted most of the day were we could 
walk around talk, get to know people from other people, take pictures, and 
just have a great time.  In the evenings they had some thrash bands performing 
and just a little too much slam dancing, the opening ceremonie was actually 
a rave with some live performances, and the closing was video presentations 
by attendies.  When ever I visit other cities I usually always run into someone
that was at that conference.  Everyone had a great time because it was so 
casual and easy to get to know people.  I really like the idea, I just don't 
like structure, keep it simple, and keep it fun.

Pete please don't tell me about risks, I've been on the wrong end of a 9mm
more than once in my life.  With the other end weilded by both sides of the
law.  All I'm saying is that IF WE DON'T start to have some awareness at
these things someone is going to die or get hurt.  How would you feel if
someone died at a rave that you threw because you hesitated to call 911
or whatever.  Note that the agenda was marked "sample".  If you feel
so strongly about this maybe you should hold a discussion about the dangers
of all theis New Age crap at raves or something.

Or something, whatever, or something.  The point I'm trying to make is that I
would really like to attend this thing, but right now it sounds rather
staunchy and boring.  In short, bag the damn lectures and just have a
get-together.  In a recent issue of "Street Sounds" they were talking about
the CMJ panel on raves.  Nothing was accomplished and it ended in shouting
matches.  How are you going to eliminate animosity between the people who are
in it for the scene and the people who are in it for the green?  You stated
that the agenda was just a "suggestion" yet my suggestions for making the
"conference" more desirable to attend are either ridiculed or thrown out.

For what it's worth, I am certified in first aid. 
(Winter emergency care technician), I will have CPR and BLS(2 men + infant CPR)
by this winter. I can deal with broken limbs and stabilizing certain 
medical emergencies. I don't guarantee that I have any supplies with
me at a rave, but I will volunteer if I am in the position to help.

No individual raver should be more afraid of injury at a rave than at
anywhere else, hopefully.

No rave organizer should ignore the fact that they're going to have
a whole hell of a lot of people there.

What's normal for an individual is irresponsible for an organizer.
If you're providing music, lights, and space to dance, you ought
to make it as safe as possible also.  It's not that hard.

Sounds like a recipe for a wasted opportunity.  Having an agenda at
least will focus peoples attention on various topics.

The planning meeting for the Bandshell Charity Rave had maybe 25
participants, and was informally organized.  It kept breaking down
into lots of small conversations and only a few basic issues were
addressed.  With 100 people you're bound to have nothing but chaos
without some kind of plan.

> How are you going to eliminate animosity between the people who are

You might not eliminate the animosity, but by establishing communication
you might just get some people thinking in slightly different directions.

Geoff's point about the people from Utah complaining made me realize
something.  Your conference is probably better directed towards people central
to San Francisco.  When you mentioned the hacker conference, I had a picture
of invitations going out to people all over, but apparently that isn't what
you want.  It is just something for the locals to come together to address
problems that are getting bigger.  That's OK by me, more power to you.
Whenever I want to have a promoter conference in this area, I climb into a
closet.

However, if you ever think of having a conference for people around the
country.  THINK FUN!  PLEASE!  A lot of people wouldn't have a whole lot to
listen to if you address specified topics about local problems.  I'd just like
to be able to come to San Francisco sometime to meet everyone.  Last time I
tried, but was unable to find the Golden Gate Park rave.  Next time, I hope it
will be more solid.

Hold on, this Utahn didn't object to the conference, I was just throwing in 
my opinion that it should be a more get-to-know-everyone thing with a little
bit less structure than I saw in the first post.  I even said I liked the 
idea.  
 
I've only really hosted one mini-rave where only about 100-200 people showed up
all through the night, it was free so people came and went as they wanted to, 
since this was our first and only, I'd love to get together with other rave
promoters to get ideas about doing things, unfortunately the laws here in Utah 
are just WAY different from everywhere else so it makes things a bit tricky to 
figure out.  But I think it would be great to have this to exchange ideas and 
stuff, I don't get to talk to rave promoters very often because Salt Lake just 
isn't the hotbed of raves in this country.

I think Geoff's original idea was for the conference to focus on the
Bay Area community -- a comprehensive national conference would have
to be on a much larger scale and doesn't seem very practical at the

I think a few promoters from other areas (Utah, LA, Texas) would be
more than welcome, though, just so we don't get too parochial  ;^)

Subject: Re: Conference (LONG MESSAGE)


Pete,

I know you must be sick of hearing from people on this subject but I thought I'd
just send you note to give you my opinion anyway since it may help to understand
why others are interested in this stuff.

I personally have been going to the parties for about a year and a half, since
they first started in the Bay Area. I have seen many changes and watched many
people come to the scene to have fun and then find something they were not
conciously looking for. I say conciously because I believe even if we do not
conciously look for something our subconcious often knows better and makes us do
certain things to find or learn things we need to live. 

The idea of going out and having fun is very important to all of us. In order to 
learn about ourselves we need to enjoy the things we do or we stop doing them.
For many of the people at the parties the start of thier party careers has been
a search of release from everyday pressures and stresses whether that be work or
school. What we find when we get there is that through drugs and/or dancing there
is a state of conciousness that we achieve that allows us greater access to who
we really are. There are many ways of expressing this concept in words, e.g. we
could say people find thier soul or spirit. 

However it is not important we find words to express this only that we
experience it. The experience we find is one of release from conflicts caused by
the concious mind being out of step with our bodies and our spirit. For many of
the people who find this they associate the experience with the drugs. Many have
been burned out by trying to further the experience by trying to take more drugs
and finally just getting too tired to continue. 

Why do these people continue on to this point? I think that this is due
to the search within us all to feel alive and thus find happiness and the
glimpse we are given of this destination when at the parties. My belief is that 
in order to get further into the experience i.e. intensify it as a method for 
finding oneself, so reduce stress and conflict in ones life and thus
find happiness we must practice concentrated forms of the experiences we find 
during the dance (e.g. meditation, body energy awareness). For many of the
people who go to parties I don't think they know what options in this direction
lie open to them so it is useful to provide at least some of the more influencial
members of the community some access or at least an introduction to this 
knowledge so that they may pass it on.

None of this has anything to do with religion as we percieve it in the west,
i.e. the orthodox forms of religion and yet it has everything. Finding oneself
is truly the vision of all religions and spiritual practices. However orthodox
religion has perverted the mission in order to achieve its own ends. That is why
the rave movement has grown to such an extent. The people of the west are
searching for a way to find peace and happiness. That we may give them other
way's to make their experiences better or least set some minds thinking in that
direction can, IHMO, only be for the better. 

While I agree that many of the subjects on the conference list are esoteric and
nothing to do with parties, in order to keep it alive we must help all the
people continue to grow and not get so heavily reliant on drugs that they
either stop having a good time or have to stop going out. Maybe this is not the 
best method but I think at least it is a step in the right direction and may 
even help a few. 

Love and Peace,

Richard

p.s. I'm sure if you have better ideas of how to make the changes required they 
would be gratefully recieved. Please take into account whereas when you live in 
Utah there are parties every weekend that here in San Francisco there is often no
need to go home on the weekends or much during the week since you can party 24
hours a day for days at a time, and people often do.

p.p.s. please excuse if this is a little confusing but this is a difficult set
of ideas to convey and I am not the worlds greatest writer.

<< this is from a thread that Brian and I carried from another group >>

Brian,

By the way, why aren't you out raving? Or are you on your way?

Going to GOS(tm)(c)(patent pending) tomorrow night?

I heard you were at the Lighthouse last weekend. True? I was there,
too. It was my second rave and much better than my first. Raves are
really cool.  I had gone out in the City a few times dancing during the
80's, it was really a drag. A lot of attitudes. But raves are
different. I come in dressed in "normal" clothes -- shorts and a
t-shirt -- and people accept me. It is really a great celebration of
diversity and tolerance. I don't know what you think of the Image
article that came out earlier this year, but I think it mentioned that
for some, ~"raves are a microcosm of what the world could be like."

I guess I share that opinion. Granted, raves won't change the world
overnight. But when we are older, we'll have some among us in the power
structures of government, industry, and media. And just as today's
environmental debates have their roots in Earth Day '70, celebrated
mostly by college students, hopefully we will bring tolerance, peace
and respect to the table as one of the issues.

What do you think?

the last pop-rai comp i got was on either earthworks or mango.
you can usually get them at bargain 1.99 sales. (unfortunately)
most pop-rai is produced on the same 16 track mixer, giving it a
distinctive underproduced _avor, although i heard the big pop-rai
studio is upgrading to 24 tracks.

Subject: An aborted Basics


	Talk about a rollercoaster.  After 5 hours of brilliant mixing
by Tony and Josh and Garth, Garth plays "Looks Like We're Shy One Horse"
by Colourbox, a kewl reggae-techno-dubby song (on 4AD, too!  And from 7
years ago!)  And he then puts on a record of a speech (no music) from MLK's
last speech, during which everyone stops dancing, holds hands/shoulders/
etc., faces Garth, (the anticipation in the room, just the pure AURA, was
incredible) and then he lays down some incredibly happy house song which
blows everyone sky high.  Two minutes later... KONK.  The lights are still
on, but no power to the DJ stand, the amps, nothing.  Techies start 
scrambling over themselves looking for power cables that may have been
kicked loose, etc.  I checked to see if I myself hadn't knocked something
loose (I was behind the DJ area).  The techies follow the cable outside the
door, and then come running back in to tell something to Martin, the 
organizer, who stands on top of the amp box and yells out, "They'll let
us have two more songs!" to which everyone cheers, but people are still 
confused.  It's only 4:30.  And who are they?

	As I found out later from various sources, the police found out
about it (it was held in a warehouse in Fremont, no residences within a
mile..hm!) and even though the space was paid for and legal, the cops were
going to shut it down.  So Martin pulled out his trump card, the fact that
he was using off-duty policemen for security.  The police who came to shut 
it down said well, okay, you can go on till 5, but everyone must leave by
then.  Ah well, I guess 4 hours of dancing is better than none.

	As for the place: it was a YADW (Yet Another Dusty Warehouse),
big yes, but... well, I would at least have had someone sweep the place
out or something.  The visuals were decent; there was this one flourescent
painting above the DJ stand which was probably the most beautiful work
of art I've ever seen at raves.  It was a portrait of a male body arching
towards the heaven, sorta in a crucifix pose but looking more like he
was flying.  While the body was very clear, the background was a wash of
flourescent paint, all falling into lines going in the same direction as
the body.  Gorgeous.

	The people were, as always, very friendly. ;)

	Which is more than I could say for Generation of Sound.

	Oh, I guess I should talk about that one.

	Yes, I went to GOS, primarily to see the film they were hyping the
hell out of (and secondly to see/hear Doc Martin, a favorite of mine from
LA).  Both wishes were shot.  They didn't show the film, at least not before
I left at 3:30, and Doc was nowhere to been seen.  I asked someone wearing
a GOS staff badge: "So, when's Doc Martin coming on?" "Who?" *sigh*.  It was
at DV8, so the crowd at the event (which was in the upper two floors for
those who know the place) was about half dress-up-to-dance types, half
"Look ma, I got me a JIVE t-shirt" types, and another half "d00d!  I hear
there's something called a rave tonight!  And they w0n't be carding!".
Again, *sigh*.  I'm not trying to judge people on their exteriors;  I
interacted with about two dozen in the 3 hours I was there.  Only a few 
were of that *mindset*, you know?  I saw a few people there that I recognized.
The one redeemable thing about the event was they had Hyperdelic Video images
being shown on a big-screen TV, and they were probably the best visuals I
have EVER seen HDV do.  Truely masterpieces.  But not worth the $25.  
DEFINITELY not.


	Well, I should end this post soon seeing as how I'm at work and I've
got a line of people waiting on me.  I'm appending a flyer that I picked up
at Basics.  It's the text on the front side; the back side lists about 100
ways to help converse natural resources and care for the Earth, ending with
"We all have a responsibility to the earth.  Learn to love it and treat it
right".  I happen to really like the text - while it's not the whole story,
it puts into words a lot of what I feel and I KNOW others feel when events
fly the way they should...

	Brian

p.s. - Garth has been playing this one song for the past month or two, that
samples to sound of the transporters in Star Trek, has a real rumbling 
bassline, and in the middle is completely beatless, and throughout is a 
female voice WHISPERING "I'm so hot" or "I'm so high".  I HAVE to get that
one.  I looked at the label as he was playing it, but it just had this
purple flower/lotus design and nothing more.



		HOUSE MUSIC and PLANETARY HEALING

	When used with positive intention, Group Energy has the
potential to help restore the Plan of Love on Earth.  If you have
been exploring House parties, or have found a home in them, you
will, of course, be aware of the intoxicating Energy levels reached
sometimes, both personally and collectively.  It os possible to
understand better the Energy we tap into and take it a step further.
There are many preliminary ingredients to becoming spiritually
aware, and even more to be able to focus and channel Energy.  Those
aspects can be discussed another time.  For now, this is what can
be done for that moment:  OPEN YOUR HEART!!!
	When you open your heart, and trust the whole group you
dance with; when you feel love with everyone, and they return it, a
higher vibration can be reached.  This happens when a crowd is
deep into the vibe of House.  What we have here, when the crowd
is open, is the power to access some extremely beneficial Energies,
and _focus_ them instead of _losing_ them.  Down through the ages
this knowledge has been available to the few who have been able
to recognize it; it seems the House Nation has tapped in.
	In the true use of rhythmic movement, the effect is to align
the physical, mental, and emotional bodies with the Oneness of All
that Is. And this lining up, when coupled with intense aspirations
of love and high desire, "results in a downflow of Force from
above.  This causes a vivification of the [three bodies] and definite
illumination.  When an entire concourse of people is thus animated
by a single high desire, when their auras blend and form one
united channel for the downflow, the effect is tremendously
intensified and can be WORLD WIDE IN ITS RADIUS." [Alice A.
Bailey, 1919].
	Help push the consciousness another level into Enlightenment.  
It's up to each of us at the party (rave) to make it happen.  Don't 
put out negative energy and feelings.  leave the old ways behind.  
Throw yourself into the winds of transformation and sow the seeds
for a new world -- one where the human family is together again.
When people respect and care for each other as a community-organism.
It's up to us to spread the vibe.
			Spread the Peace!
		    You do make a difference!

	believe in the "Presidential" election, tthere are a lot of
	regional and local initiatives, and people that need your

Subject: weekend update

friday: didn't do anything.  jeff and i started on the next
ultraviolet catastrophe record.  you guys are gonna like it.  or else.

saturday: basics.  brian described it pretty well.  i didn't think the
warehouse was that dusty - it wasn't anywhere near as awful as the one
in livermore that vision was held at, for instance.  musicwise, tony
really surprised me - i haven't been that impressed by him and i was
sure the only reason he kept getting gigs was because of his
connections.  however, this time he really made me revise my opinion.
in fact, i think his was the best set of the evening!  (of course,
anybody who plays meat beat manifesto's "helter skelter" wins brownie
points with me.  he also played the *other* side of the uvc record,
which was a nice surprise.)  in contrast, josh and garth did not
inspire me.  i kept wanting some serious energy building bugging out
music but instead it was more low key and trance oriented.

then at 5 AM, the rave was stopped.  we weren't happy with that, so we
decided to hit the after party at DNA - i think it's called "afterlife."

this was quite a fun little after-rave.  i was chilling out in the
couch room when i heard the uvc track come on, so i summoned up the
energy to go investigate.  dutch introduced me to dj dan who praised
the record to the skies (and caused me to blush furiously).  dan then
proceeded to perform the absolute best mix out i've heard - he started
cutting into the record with the "mama say mama saw mama macoosa"
chant, during the screaming bit, and then when it went into the
industrial part, he switched over completely, but kicked the uvc
record back to the beginning of the screaming bit and did the whole
thing over again!  very very cool.

anyway, dutch and dan both did fine jobs although it didn't motivate
me terribly.  i was also beginning to feel fatigued.  Harry Who came
on next and bored me into a near coma with some lame disco, house and
a preponderance of the hellish Wailing Diva Syndrome.  some might call
it soulful, but i just cannot stand it.  harry was on for entirely too
long.

next up was dj shawn.  he started out with the "if y'all really like
to rock the funky beats" bit from public enemy's "nation of millions"
record and then slammed into some unbelievably funky shit.  shawn is
from hayward and apparently doesn't get too many gigs around the city,
which is a shame because the set he played sunday morning instantly
popped him into my "top 3 reasons to quit what i'm doing and go dance"
list.  it was funky, hard and he did some amazing live scratching.
let me tell you guys, if you get a chance to check out shawn - GO.

while shawn was dazzling us i saw a familiar face - dj rick preston
was carting his crates in.  we said hello, and then rick played a
dynamite set, featuring a killer energy building hat trick - "cry
freedom" into "mighty ming" into UVC!  the dancers were spazzing, and
sweat was flying.  a damn fine show.  around noon we started to feel
tired and grimy so we took off to clean up and consider options for
later in the afternoon.  we heard of a rave at a fort in marin and
someone said the park was on, but after getting back to the apartment
and showering we realized we were utterly pooped so we retired to bed
for some well deserved rest.

  For anyone who wants a really fun and interesting thing to do on Sunday

..you won't beleive I'm saying this..
I heartily recommend the One Mind Temple's CHURCH SERVICE...

I went this Sunday with a friend who goes regularly...and I have never
had such a good time in a church in my life..
The jazz music and the singing were incredible.. and the spirit was
so real.. There was a feeling of beauty in this small,mostly black
congregation that was hard to describe... They worship to jazz music
(they beleive John Coltrane was a saint..) and after their service...
I have to agree.. 

This is an experience not to be missed.. But please respect their
space and don't go unless you can respect their church energy..
pretty traditional Christian,(but with a STRONG emphasis on the MUSIC.)

They're on Divisidero near Oak...in SF..

Again,please respect their space.....if you do go..
These are really nice people..

For those on the list with children..this is a really nice place to
bring your kids..

I got to the Castro street fair late on Sunday and danced like a maniac for one

It seemed like EVERY single song he played was a former popular house song in

 Certainly, I know what to do, and when I am Vice President -- and
 I will be -- there will be contingency plans under different sets of
 situations and I tell you what, I'm not going to go out and hold a news
 conference about it. I'm going to put it in a safe and keep it there! Does
 that answer your question?

                    would do if he assumed the Presidency,1988

 handler stories because I'm the handler ... I'm Doctor Spin.

Subject: Death at the End Up


I talked to someone who was there.
They said that the man apparently had a Heart Attack.
The EMT's got there pretty quickly but could not
resussitate him.

As I have said, this is why we need to have people educated in
things like CPR and first aid.  I was in a class at Foothill once
when an older man began to vomit and keel over.  A guy yelled heart attack and
IMMEDIATELY went to work on the man, clearing his air passage, checking his
breathing, (which had stopped) and performing CPR, the CPR guys buddy
had already run out of the room to call the paramedics.  The kid kept
the CPR up and after about a minute (which seemed to last an eternity)
the older man gasped and started to cough.  The kid told him to ly still
by this time the EMTs had arrived and took over.  They thanked to guy
who did the CPR and later we found out that the older man "made it".
He came back several weeks near the end of the class to that the
two young men who the doctors said unquestionabley save his life.

This is why we need to build community and start to train people or
have people trained in CPR at raves.

I've sent for the schedual from the red cross on cpr and first aid
and will myself be taking the course ASAP.  I want to encourage
others out there to do this as well, the courses seem to only
cost $24 - $60 and take about 8 hours.

I'll post the info, when I get it.

Subject: being back

well i was in NYC for a brief vacation with the parents and their
free food. the rave thingy back home - and i only made it to three,
seems pretty small in comparison. am i wrong? there looked like an
amazing one out in brooklyn somewhere, but alas i came back here too
soon. Raving in b]klyn.... what a strange idea: a bbq, case of
mickeys, a volleyball and broken net, and everybody]s alphabet aunts
- you know aunt b, aunt z, etc.. @ least in my family. but i went to
this tiny zanzibar type place that was raving hard one night - i
think the mix was by the same guy who mixes it up at vinylmania. it
was exciting to see someone with only two slide projectors waving
his hands in front of them to make special effects. i have a soft
spot for lowcore, like the crest pump.... people in ny do dance
different, more on a deelite trip than a all my muscles twitch in
rhythm trip. i went to a nasa rave (i think they]re out here now, at
least in la) and this dj put in a rave mix of some eazy listening
tune, just like 808 states lift, but more cheesy with schmaltz
guitar. does anyone know anything about it? then he played beat it
by michael jackson (rave mix). the joke got over quick, but moby
took over and saved things...

Cool World: it was nice to rave back in sf, but the early djs were a
bit of a waste, they let these long beatless intros just hang around
building up reverb noise off the wharehouse walls. by 4am the smell
of excrement by the porto-johns was out of control. i tried the
smart toast because i]m a loser.... the jam was funny, but i was so
thirsty.

here]s a natural rave supplement: rocket fuel herbal extract. give
it a whirl, you]ll notice the effects.

then i checked it at the end-up and grabbed the 8:00am cal train
back to the burbs. that]s a great train: where the all night
alcoholics, urban ravers, and granola environmentalists and weekend
work gladiators all hang around and stare at each other.

it not as much fun as the 2:30am number 1 train going up town from
christopher st in nyc, but then again, few things are.
peace
hopefully i]ll meet some of you this weekend....
im doing an acid jazz dancehall show on 90.1fm if you can get it
sundays 9pm-11pm if you]re interested. hope to hear from you.

Hey, JAMMs, check out the single _Don't wanna know bout evil_ by the

of John Martin's song.  I bumped into this in the recycled rack at Reckless
on Haight (they have the most amazing stuff!).  I've been listening and
dancing to this for about 3 hours now (since I got home).

Recommended: tracks 2 & 3, the Rumble and Tumble mixes.  Track 1 is the 7"
Wireless road mix (their name) and is kind of pop-ish.  This is good stuff!

There's a rave party this Friday in, yes lo and behold, San Jose.  Yet,
I don't know who's throwing it, who the DJs are, and where the thing is.
But...I have the number here, and better yet, it will be an underground 
thing.  Meaning mum or potentially none may be the operative word.  Funnier
yet, the imfo line is actually the home phone of some individual.  Says
call after six.  Anyway, I'm intrigued because one, its an underground party
and after it gets bust, if and when but probably more when than if, they
plan to move the thing to Taco Bell, yes home of the bean burrito and soft
taco.  Someone is on cohorts with the manager there so it's a go.  Remind
any exiled new yorkers of Michael Aligs parties at McDonalds?  Anyhow
it's a bit of a gambit, but underground raves usually have a strong, if
not eclectic, rave crowd fueling it.  If any sfravers want to brave 101
this friday email me with a number where I can reach you, and or leave
details (phone machine, work etc.).  I 

don't anticipate many wanting to
try this, but if I get a good response I'll just post details Fri instead.

Those of you in the working world, may find your employers will
offer this course to you free, or pay for you to take it -- ask around.
If they don't, encourage them to do it.

Heh.. That is the train that I had to catch every night uptown to 125th when
I was in NY in August.. It gets even better as the hour gets later. I remember
stepping out on 125 at 3:30 am and some dude was walking up the street with
a blanket draped around his neck flipping a butterfly knife around. Too far
gone, eh?

For an extra 4 hours, you can get it upgraded to 2 person CPR, which
is a lot less tiring than basic CPR, if you have a partner available.
Regular CPR is 15:2 compression/respiration and 2 persons is 5:1.
After 15 compressions, you need air yourself.

Subject: HDV @ GOS: Help!

I've been a bit behind in keeping up with the list, so I only just came
across Brian's review of Generation of Sound, in which it was written:

>The one redeemable thing about the event was they had Hyperdelic Video images
>being shown on a big-screen TV, and they were probably the best visuals I
>have EVER seen HDV do.  Truely masterpieces.  But not worth the $25.  
>DEFINITELY not.

Indeed, this screening was not worth even $25 to the good folks at
Hyperdelic Video. The tapes that were shown were bootlegs. HDV licensed
neither DV8 nor GOS to show their tapes, and neither Andy nor Dave of
Hyperdelic was on hand to do live mixing, as is their custom at all paid
performances.

This has been a recurring problem at DV8. Apparrently, a few months ago,
HDV played once at Gamma (held upstairs at DV8). At that time, a couple of
their videotapes mysteriously disappeared. Since then, on a number of
different occasions, I have seen raves held at DV8 use the HDV name on
flyers. I have attended one of these events (Juice, a few months back) to
check it out. I took notes on the particular videos shown, and the mighty
men of HDV identified the tapes as the ones missing since their Gamma
appearance.

Bootleg city. IMNSFHO, this is stealing, plain and simple.

The HDV folks have kindly allowed us to use their videos for Connection,
and will certainly do so again in the future. I'd appreciate it if you all
would do them a favor in return:

When you see what appears to be Hyperdelic video at an event, look for the
table where the video is being mixed (there should always be one of the
performance is legit). Introduce yourself to the person mixing (most likely
Andy or Dave), and check out their setup. If you suspect that they may be
bogus, please take some notes on the video you saw (yeah, I know, it's
hard: "thousands of oozing pulsating eyeballs, flowing in and out of a
field of rotating multicolored fractals and swirling animated spaceships")
and let me know about it. I'll pass the word on to them (they're not on the
net). That way the HDV folks can at least figure out which of their tapes
have been ripped off, and how many times their stuff has been shown without
their knowledge.

BTW, there is only one commercially released Hyperdelic video, entitled
_E-Mission_. You'd know it if you saw it. Even this tape is not sold for
public exhibition. This means that anytime you see HDV without Andy or Dave
present, they are being ripped off.

Thanks in advance-

	Great!  Yes, all systems are go from this end - Alternity went well
enough that I think Alternity 2 will be fun too.  I think this time it might
not hurt to do a small amount of flyering - just the name and phone #, maybe
the DJ's.  We had about 175 people there, but I think the place could definitely
hold about 100 or so more...  

	As for the DJ's - Eric was fantastic last time so I think he should come
back, I know God's Personal DJ was having turntable trouble that night and that
normally he's great, so he's invited back... and what would you all say to
getting a third DJ who is more current in the scene, like Moonpup or Carlos
or someone?  I _know_ I could find someone - probably not Garth or Jeno or
Spun, etc., but reasonably big.  Big enough to draw name recognition....

by when I see him during the week.  If requested.  Pasta is another
South Bay DJ that has done some sporatic work at raves.  His mixing skills
are excellent and his sound is an eclectic breed of underground acid, trance
and what not.  Recommended.  I see Pasta from time to time, I could run
it by him if the need arises.

The US "house" and senate have passed an omnibus appropriations bill
which includes a one year moratorium on the FDA's proposed restrictions
on nutritional supplements such as megavitamin, herbs, and smart drinks.

The hatch amendment provides for the FDA's regs to be proposed by the 
sec'y of HHS in June 93 with implementation delayed until 12-31-93.
In addition the  GAO is to study how the FDA allocates its resources
in the area of dietary supplements and the OTA is to study how other
countries deal with them.  These "studies" are clearly designed to have
a chilling effect on FDA complicity with  the pharmaceutical corps and
AMA's desire to further control what we may or may not put in our bodies.

This is a small victory in the defense of personal liberties, due to
the lobbying power of the supplements industry.  If only there were a
similarly well-heeled lobby to support the removal of some other stuff
from the infamous Schedule I !-)

The idea behind Alternity is to keep it simple, keep it home-made, etc.  If
the WBL'rs want to come do something, we can probably negotiate - Chris got

Subject: Promised land promoters - sound legit?


In compiling the rave calendar tonight, sinceI was _severly_ short on flyers,
I've been going through and calling all the numbers on Derek's phone list.  I
called the Creation number, and this is basically what they said:  (remember,
Creation was one of the groups involved in the Promised Land rave a few weeks
ago)

We apologize for the event getting shut down around four.  We worked with the
Oakland police on the event, we had EMT's we had off-duty policemen, we
had special security working, we had all the right sound permits, and then at
four they decided to come out and yank us.  Not only did we have to shut the
music off, we had to clear everyone out too.  We are looking into seeing if
we can do anything legally about that right now... but the fact is that cops
don't like these events, and are trying to shut us down with little or no
reason.  There's a lot that has to be done legally, with all the promoters
getting together to fight this.  Now if you guys want to help, you know, you
have a comment you want to make or you feel you can help us in this, leave
us your name and your number.  We need to fight this together.

(the above is paraphrased greatlt, because I just can't type that fast! ;)

So anyways, it looks like they may have been somewhat legit to begin with.
I mean, at least they have a clue as to what they _should_ be doing, whether
or not they actually did it.

Just fyi.

I screwed up the last time Isent this and it only got out to a cuple of 
people so if this a repeat, my apologies...

in regarding the shootings I was talking about earlier...
      
        There was a Kool-Aid rave or some rave that used Mr Kool Aid in the
flier and it was held in Oakland at the Floppy House, apparently.  Now,
I found out about this after the fact, but apparently three poeple got
shot at this party.  In fact, the vibe was so bad that Jeno stoppped spinning,
picked up his records and just left.  Bad stuff.
        I had also gone to the Jama Rave and while I was in there, I found
out that someone had gotten shot while people were waiting to get in.  This
was in San Francisco at the concourse...really just too horrible for words.

        What is happening, as we probably are all noticing, is that the cool
young toughs, the gangsters (I used "cool" very bitterly here) are hearing about

these huge parties where lots of girls are on ecstasy therefore (to them) they
are just waiting to get together with people.  My friend actually heard some
guys talking like this at (yuk) Cool World, and she told them to fuck off.  She's fantastic...

	Anyway, we know what's happening....the bad locals are interested
in the scene now and hopefully they will dorp off as they get disenchanted with
the price, the vibe, or whatever.  Hopefully we can all just keep doing our
own thing until the people who don't understand learn, or just leave.

	Hi,

	Well I subscribed to this mailing list out of interest, being
	several thousand miles away kind of excludes me from all the

	Over the months I've seen a few British DJ's advertised as

Subject: A PIT (!!!) at a RAVE?  You gotta be kidding!

Just thought you all might be interested in a report on a weekend of
LA raves 2 weeks ago with a group of 10 SF ravers.  Man, were we disappointed.

The Friday night rave (forgot the name) was held in the Mayan Theater
near 9th and Hill streets (?) downtown, an old theater done up like a
Mayan ruin  What an amazing place!  As you walked in, with the fog,
black lights, and lasers, it strikes you almost like a scene out of
Bladerunner.  The atmosphere was none too friendly, though, more like
a dance club, with absolutely no communication, virtually even no glances
exchanged between ravers.  MAN what we could do with a place like that
in SF!

OK, wait, it gets better (worse).  Grape Ape II, the next night, advertised
heavily even here in SF, was a mess.  It was held at these warehouses
where they filmed part of Terminator II, but get this:
  -a 90 minute line to get in
  -no water bottles allowed inside
  -no FLYERS allowed inside (we're talking the flyers you were just handed
      outside, much less other promoters doing flyering!) causing the
      entire parking lot to be TRASHED
  -the WORST mixing I think I've ever heard, of mostly the hardest
      core techno you could imagine, and yes,
  -a MOSH PIT (slamdancing) broke out amongst some jocks whose main
      purpose seemed to be knocking over as many people as possible!

If we hadn't been so disgusted we mighta fallen over laughing.  The one
good spot, highly recommended for anyone doing the LA scene, is the
mobile underground Sunday morning party called SketchPad where we
actually met good people, and heard good tunes and mixing. 

Almost all our attempts at communication with others were snubbed wherever
we went.  I know it may not be a fair sample of the LA scence, since
Grape Ape was a huge commercial rave, but you have NO IDEA how good we
have it amongst the crowd here in SF until you try it elsewhere!  

Help keep this scene alive, PLEASE!

 The kind of cramps I'm talking about are "The" Cramps, who will be playing
at Slim's at 333 11th St. in SF. I've always wanted to see the Cramps on
Halloween, and for some reason, they often play SF on the Halloween weekend.
It'll be a nice contrast - the Cramps, then off to a costume rave for the rest
of the night! 
 Anybody else in SFRaves Cramping on Halloween?

 This Saturday looks like it's going to be a musical smorgasborg for me! I'm
going to the Shoreline Native American benefit concert ( which has a second
show on Sunday ). I'm going to see Carlos Santana, Mickey Hart and his special
ensemble ( composed of Steve Miller, D'Cuckoo, and others ), and John Lee 
Hooker doing a duo with Ry Cooder. [ I'll probably hit the snack bar during
suspected girlfriend-beater Jackson Browne's set ].

 Then, if I can find it - off to FMR! I'll probably have to go all the way 
home to my modem to find out where it'll be, given that it'll probably be
announced at the last minute again.

Subject:      Non-Drug Induced States via computer
To: "(no name)" <NASS@suwatson.bitnet>

Hello,
  I'm starting to work on my senior thesis for art.  I'm interested in
"non-drug-induced tripping" or states of well-being.  I've been looking
into
the use of such things by rotating mandlebrot/fractal color patterns (looks
like tie-dye patterns) and also by the effects of stereoscopic (3-d,
crosseyed
view, etc) images.  There are other ways to go about this kind of stuff
(I think that Timothy Leary is getting involved with it)  Since I don't do
drugs, it's hard to know if I'm approaching the same results, although
things
can still be "funky" to me.
An example of this effect of "pseudo-tripping":
  Once at the Limelight, in NYC I was sitting in a small side dance room.
There weren't too many people in there, this light was shining off a
mirrored
disco ball and created hundreds of little lights on the floor moving
around.
If I followed the lights around it was alright, but when I stared at one
spot on the floor, it felt like I was flying and spinning around.  If
effects
like these are combined with stereo sound (oscillating between speakers..
to cause a rotating effect) total disorientation of the user/viewer will
occur.
Do you know of any publications (books, magazine articles, etc) that deal
with this sort of thing?  Any information will be appreciated.
 - Thanks

hi y'all!
the idea of ignoring this development is a mistake, imho. if i recall
i was reading in a book by simon frazer (?!) on the dance scene in england,
a similar development there just about killed the rave scene there
 once the drug-pushers came in . i think more serious checking of people
at the door and 'security' might be warranted. hope i am not that paranoid.

How to produce Liquid Oil projections..
______________________________________
A widely available overhead projector may be used to project kinetic
liquid projections.. :ambient effect..
Use a overhead projector with bottom lighting,preferably with a quartz-halogen
lamp.Put a dimmer on the main power,and if you can,add a supplemetal fan to
insure
adequate ventilation.Mask off the edges of the stage,place the dishes (old
glass clockfaces) on top (a small one in a larger one) and add the water
and oil based dyes,usually just to the space between the two dishes.
For oil dye,I use Keystone anilyne dyes, and for water,I use photo retouching
colors..91% alcohol can be added to the water solutions to enable the water
based liquids to become darker as they evaporate.
Then you're ready to go, turn up the dimmer slightly and focus.Mask off
the edges of the screen area,remembering to cover the edges of the
screen-area as much as possible...Move the top plate in rythm to the
music...It's all in the wrist   :)

Subject: Underground Unearthed

I got a tremendous, positive response to this friday's jose suare underground.
Hence, I'll just post the imfo here.  A couple of considerations: I really
respect someone willing to use their own phone number to promote a rave.
I called last evening and got the response I had anticipated, TV mildly
humming, male voice, curt, pleasant, to the point: "Call back Friday after
six"  So basically that's the speel.  Sometimes I call rave numbers for
amusement.  To hear who's spinning and what background music they're using.
I'd recommend only calling this number if you really intend to come down.
To keep phone traffic low, commit yourself before the call and just ask
Where to go.  *Great*  I hope to see some sfravers there.  If you see me,
I'll be wearing a black paisley bandanna, a v-neck t-shirt and jeans, come
say hi.  The rave will be called Mind Riot and the phone number is:
(408) 998-2712.  Beyond that, if there's anything odd about the details,
a place unfamiliar to sfravers, I'll post again Friday.  Otherwise, peace!

Subject: hey

I have heard alot about the rave system here on the net from a great friend
(who has also done me the favor of forwarding some samples of the mail that
\gets sent here) and I would love to become a part of this process of
spreading the peace virtually.

I discovered raves this summer and ended up going to about 12 of them.  They
\are great as long as the attitude stays away, which seems to be an increasing
problem.  Is it me, or are more and more raves getting busted?  I guess it
comes with the commercialism of the scene.  I talked to a guy from England
and he said the raves are "a national pastime" over there, with raves reaching
enormous sizes -- 30000 people or so.  If this is the destiny of Bay Area
raves, it is too bad.  The vibes are best at the small raves since none of
the meatheads (= nonravers) show up.

So I guess my main interest in the ravenet is to be in contact with the diehard,
the faithful.  Together we can keep the scene peaceful and fun for all those
who who want it.

Talk later.

I was thinking of checking out Milk, but I'm open to suggestions.
I'm new here, so I'd appreciate it if someone could show me around.

one of the reasons I wanted to move to this area. You guys don't know

NO!  This mailing list is *not* secure.  Moreover, it is now big
enough that it would certainly draw the attention of the heat if
pharmaceutically salacious information started to pass through with
regularity.  It's fine to post info on the dangers X or LSD
(although y'all really should be reading alt.drugs regularly) or
compare asking prices, but when the discourse starts to get
specific about trafficking then we'll end up not only with people
in jail but also with more unwanted attention to Internet from the law.

Maybe the last twelve years have made me overly paranoid (although
Hunter Thompson says this is impossible), but when I see this kind
of seemingly innocuous request it makes me think the DEA is
starting to troll for dopers electronically.

Why sure.  I operate a large meth lab just south of Concord.  Due to the
large proceeds I've generated from forcing gradeschool children to push
crank and coke on their classmates, I can offer a substantial discount
on x and acid (although I'm planning on dosing the state legislature right
before the election so get your acid while you can!)
	For a list of mind-bending things I offer, send me $20 and mail
$20 to the Church of the SubGenius, POB 140306, Dallas, TX 75214.  Tell them

I've been in contact with a person in Finland recently over the net.  It
started with me sending him some diffraction glasses.  He stated that PWOG
played a rave there recently and were fabulous.  He also mentioned the jar of

Hey all, 

Went out scouting for anything ravey last night, but didn't find anything
(went past 55 Natoma, Townsend, King St Garage, Big Heart City, 1015 Folsom,
the Underground, the End-Up, Atlantis, the Top), maybe we should organize
something for Thursdays.  Didn't make it to Zanzibar, looks like that might
be the only thing happening.  

Anyway, I did see info on the PTV thing in the Guardian:

"Exile and Exhilaration: An Interactive Discourse by Genesis and Alaura
	P-Orridge"

In the '60s, Genesis gained notoriety as part of the London-based kinetic
performance troupe "The Exploding Galaxy"; more recently his madcap mayhem
found an outlet fronting the industrial music machine Throbbing Gristle;
currently he leads the techno collective Psychic TV.  Genesis has also
been conducting psychic research with good old Timothy Leary these days
Help both halves of the performance artist couple explore and explode
fairy tales of the '90s at Speak and Tell Gallery with good-humored 
anarchy in a neo-dadaist vein.  To jumpstart your cerebellum, Alaura
will erect "aural Land Escapes," while Hyperdelic Video of Tokyo unleashes
"retinal stimulation."  Unless the open-ended Happening turns into an 
encounter group/postgraduate seminar, it promises to be a blast for
everyone but fascistic control freaks.  8pm, Speak and Tell Gallery,

It would seem in a lot of cases that it's one of the few (if not only)
socially acceptable forms of physical male bonding outside of organized sports.
(No sexism intended but the vast majority of participants are male.)  It's 
a shame there are so few outlets for this kind of stuff but there it is.
Btw, the participants in slamming/moshing tend to be younger.  This is due to a 
greater interest in bonding at a younger age and a higher level of 
energy (it's a lot of work!).  I hope talking about this from a sociological
perspective doesn't make people feel awkward. 

Personally, I love it and do it at the slightest opportunity.  But it doesn't
seem compatible with technorave in its current form.  Technoindustrial, 
however, is a different story....

I really hope people are honest and frank and willing to
appear on camera.  It's about time that people started to come
out of the closet regarding their use of hallucinogens.  I use
the closet metaphor because we who do choose to use are
currently mirroring the attitudes and actions of gays before
the rise of the gay rights movement.  Then, the few gays who
were willing to be out and talk openly about themselves for
the press were too easily marginalized, and those who would
only talk incognito just exacerbated the perception of secrecy,
reinforcing the idea that homosexuality was wrong.  It's only
been in the last ten years that large numbers of "average"
gays have come out of the closet that the gay community has
started to be mainstreamed in majority public perception.
It's only as people realize that their favorite aunt or the
milkman they've known for years is gay that they've realized
that they can't reconcile gay stereotypes with reality.

Really, the only way for any group to be perceptually
mainstreamed is to achieve the "guy next door" standard.  That
is, when Joe Public realizes that the guy next door could be a
such and such (black, gay, LSD user) then he can no longer
shunt them off into some ghetto.  He's forced to address and 
rationalize the reality instead of relying on stereotypes.
Then and only then will any characteristic or pattern of
behavior become accepted.

So someone's got to be the guy next door who happens to be an
LSD user.  All the people who are now pillars of the community
who have used LSD and don't regret it have got to come out and
admit it.  The profile of the average LSD user is
significantly above societal norms in most categories: LSD
users tend to be better educated, earn more money, have more
community stature, etc.  If the general public was forced to recognize
this, they would be forced to abandon their stereotypes about
LSD-crazed Deadhead hippies.  Only when majority opinion goes
through this process will we get reasonable legal handling of
LSD.

  hi y'all!
it is true that slamming is a form of physical contact to show affection (?)
between men (mostly). but what is wrong with hugging or dancing together or
touching - holding hands, whatever ? it would  be challenging since the men
might be thought gay, even if they are not. it requies overcoming homophobia
among the straights, which is more work, but i think is very rewarding since
it opens one up for closer friendships wiht other men.

Er... no.  This is NOT what sfraves is about.  We are not a "one-stop-shop-and-

The basic consensus of people here, I think, is that you shouldn't buy drugs
at a rave, (the dealers could be a narc, the stuff can be cut with anything)
you should try to get it from people you _know_.

In regards to the moshing and slamdancing at the raves...

I have got in a couple of fun sort of dance circles where one will go out,
spin his stuff, and then another would continue on in the dancing.  While
the moshing and hardcore slamming is cool for some people, I tend to notice
guys start to get really into friendship after their first couple of raves,
at least that's what happened to my friends and I...
we went to our first rave and figured it out, you know?  That people at
base(bass?)-level want to be close to each other, and would rather hug
than snub.  We have experienced a new consciousness, and we love life
much harder than ever before.  What the raves have done for all of u
s is let us focus one again on the joys of being a community, and have
helped us to banish all the concepts of racial and sexual prejudice...

My attitude towards people who exist in the day has changed a lot, and I
find myself accepting people much easier...

so what has this to do with the moshing?  Well, to each their own.  Some
people find it easier to smash into their friend than to hold them and
thank them for being such a good friend...maybe after than initial 
slam burst, they can sit together and enjoy the vibe that is so intrinsically linked to our bay area rave community.

Sorry about the sermonsing, but I haven't gone out in over 2 weeks, and I
am going nutso..

if you go to the underground party down here, I might be there with
my trademark blinking red light, dancing a storm

and a "raver" with a floppy hat talking about smart drinks
and a short clip of an "actual rave" and the "raver" talked
about setting up drinks booth and how it's similar to the 60s,
and that it has its own "hard drugs".
The emphasis was whelther "smart drugs" were "drugs" and
whelther the manufacturer had made medical claims.
It was pretty innocuous, the raver was honest and to

I am still interested in INFORMATION on the EFFECTS of the aforementioned

many people may or may not do at raves, I would like to hear it.

(And I agree that, if one were to try to buy such things, it would be wise to
do so from someone who one knows well.  Thank goodness _I_ don't have to

actually I think there is some sexism involved.  I've been at clubs
where the stage-steroided-droids stood by calmly while "the boys"
crashed up on stage and leapt into an accommodating pit, but when
"a girl" wants to do it, nope, too bad, the "guards" don't permit
it.  I've observed this double standard on a few occasions.  which 
means the only times I've been able to jump into a pit were when
I got past the gorillas so fucking fast that no one in the pit saw
me coming and I landed on my ass.

personally, I love it too, but most ravers seem pretty unreceptive 
toward "horse play."  for example, at connection, I was practicing 
( embarrassingly bad ) martial arts w/ two consenting adults, and there
were numerous disapproving glances, not to mention comments.  I felt that 
I was being told by the monitor to quit running in the hallway.

uh, where does technoindustrial happen ?

I think it's usually affectionate.  obviously things can get 
out of hand.  for example, when weapons are involved.  also,
various intoxicants can prevent you from realizing you're getting
hurt and / or you're hurting someone else.  most people would
probably agree this is usually bad.

I think there's a lack of real industrial places right now
(Ah, for the days of the old Underground...).  Drug #6 on
thursday nights does a gothic/industrial mix that's too
heavy on the goth for me.  I was at Terminator at Big Heart
City (the Friday night of Alternity), where they do a
metal/industrial mix.  The place surprised me a bit: I went
there as a joke (a friend of mine was telling me it was
straight out of Wayne's World), but I liked it more than I
thought I would.  They played very little traditional metal,
and lots of hard industrial dance stuff, and a lot of people
did start moshing, which was cool... 

what was not cool was getting slammed into someone's head
and splitting my lip and bleeding for the next half hour.  I
could've easily lost some teeth.  

When it happened, I was worried about possibly hurting the
person I hit, then about stopping the bleeding and so on,
but the more I think about it, the more I'm certain that
someone came up behind me from outside of the pit, and
slammed me back against the flow on purpose, i.e. there are
people there who hang out on the *outside* of the mosh pit,
and do their best to hurt the people who are slamming.

I love slamming and never had a problem getting into the pit,
I stopped after I had been crunched too many times by suburban
teenage white boys whose concept of slamming is running real hard
and jump with your shoulder first into a crowd. Sometimes, they keep
their arms up and hit you with the elbows. It gets pretty
violet when the people are drunk and don't have a clue how hard
they are doing this. (BTW, the bad ones are in South Bay)
When it's a good pit, it's great, once I saw A Split Second,
and it's the most fun slamming, the bass player was stage diving,
I was pushed up the stage, but too chicken to dive.
Cynthia, if you want to practice martial arts, come hang out with
me, I'd love to spar.
Industrial is fun too, I love the crash cage, with good vibes
it's safer with everyone wielding lead pipes that in a slam pit
in Palo Alto seeing Mojo Nixon.
Off to see Motorhead tonight, I'll tell you about the pit tomorrow.

Subject: Connection (Out of the Closet)

Doc--
I know you're sincere, so I'd like to see us go through
some of your "cognitive spaghetti" with you.  While
there are some comparisons to be made with the various
liberation movements of the past 30 years (civil rights,
women's, gays), there are more contrasts and contradictions
between them on the one hand and drug consciousness/
education on the other hand.  Obviously, sfraves is too
limited a forum for each one of us to persue this in great
depth, but as an educator intimately concerned about
both these areas (I am one of the founders of Triangle
Speakers, a Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Education Project
in the Santa Cruz area that has spoken with thousands
of students and their teachers and parents in the last
two years) I know the differences: the lesbian next door
and the LSD user next door are NOT the same phenomena
to deal with--witness our recent forum here on 48 Hours.

As a raver and lifelong participant in the alternitive
culture scene I'd like to see people like Kath;een and
48 Hours more interested in things like searching out
the recondite but out-there positive answers to Rodney
King's question in the areas of raves and sexuality and
alternitive life styles and psychedelics, but it's
not going to happen simplistically or through wishful
thinking on our part.  It's going to take work,
clarity, dedication, andd organization--four of the                         
main ingredients it took us to begin to come out of
our closets in Santa Cruz to fight the deaths, self-
destruction, isolation, and pall of negativity to
start Triangle Speakers.  I'd like to work with
you and others to begin to do the same thing with
psychedelic awareness.  But while some of the needs
are the same, the situation is very different!

 This is mostly a posting about the FMR this morning...

 Prior to the FMR, I was at Shoreline Amphitheatre for a benefit concert for
various indigenous peoples groups. I got to see Carlos Santana, Steve Miller,
and Ry Cooder playing together w/ Santana's band (Very good!). The act I was
come to see was Mickey Hart (one of the Grateful Dead drummer's), playing 
with the female electronic percussion band D'Cuckoo - surprise players were
Kitaro on keyboards and Steve Miller and Santana on guitar - t'was great!

 { I noticed that going to raves has affected my rock-spacy dancing style -
I'm incorporating the rave blade-hand wave-jab arm motions into my 
repertoire of dance moves! }

 As for the FMR itself -

 I got the location of the FMR due to the kind efforts of the Normals and Paul
Thomas ( thanks!). I got to it at about 12:45. I had to park about a 1/2 
mile down Bonny Doon Road - that's were the first good parking spots were
by 12:45 AM! Brian was helping to warn the folks parking on HW1 about the
possiblity of getting a ticket and/or towed.

 My poor guess at the crowd size would be at least 200/300 persons. A fairly
good natured bunch, considering that the sound system hadn't arrived yet - 
it showed up at around 1:30AM. BUT - No mixer! The music really didn't start 
playing until about 3:45.

 Everything went very well after that. Many SFRavers were there, so I hope
there will be other postings reviewing the quality of the music/mixing,
and the sound quality in general. I had a great time, despite the occasional
nap to recharge the batteries.

 ( PS - I heard of two incidents, one guy and one gal, needing help after
   ingesting psychoactives and geting into a bad headspace. Any clarifica-
   -tion? Also, could music have helped them? )

 I'm getting sleepy again - Good Night/Morning !

			Larry "Leaves Raves Early So He Can Be The
					First To Post About 'Em" Ching

 PPS - For those of you who come real early to a Bonny Boone event, and park
on Bonny Doone Road - some of the first 50 yards or more of the road is no
parking anytime - I saw a bunch of tickets this morning, as I was marching
to my truck. Those "No Parking" signs are hard to see at night!

Subject: Bonny Doon FMR - whatta smash!


  By the consensus of several people, somewhere between 1200 and 1500 people
gathered on the beach at Bonny Doon last night/this morning and had the time
of their lives.  True, parking became a NIGHTMARE (becoming a major revenue
source for the local sherriff's and the local tow truck companies), and sound
troubles meant the sound didn't start until 4:15 (!!!), but beyond that and
a medical emergency that I'll allow Andrei Cogan to elaborate on, it was 
truely a wonderful experience.  
  I got to the beach at about 11:30; already the parking lot in front was full,
which was bad since my self-designated job was to tell people _not_ to park
there.  I was moderately successful at that - but by about 2 parking along
Bonny Doon road became an impossibility and many people refused to park there,
preferring instead to get a $20 ticket (then again, think about it - the party
was free, so splitting $20 among two or three people in the car is less than
one would pay for an average rave).  I could tell by the cars that pulled up
which ones were there for the *Full*Moon*Rave* and which ones were there
because they heard there was gonna be some bitchen' party there with hot babes
on X.  I tried to steer the latter away, simply by saying it was going to be
a dry party. ;)  But to my surprise, most of the cars knew to park on BD road.
Wow.
  The scene on the beach was slightly tense as people waited to get the sound
system going.  I could just imagine if this were a hip-hop concert or heavy
metal concert, with sound problems lasting two hours - how would that kind
of crowd react?  Fortunately, I only heard of one minor fight; and I guess the
sound problems convinced the unfaithful that it wasn't happening, so a number 
of them left.
  But when the music came on.... oh, boy, when the music came on.... the 
energy was THERE!  Like a man starving of thirst coming in from the desert,
the dancers attacked the music with a vengence.  
  For all my worries about the rumor mill bringing in the wrong type of crowd,
the crowd last night was wonderful, very open and friendly... and the wide 
open spaces of Bonny Doon allowed for people to distance themselves from the 
music and talk, which is starting to be my favorite activity at raves these
days, almost beating out getting lost in the music.  And there were SO MANY
SFRAVERS THERE!  JEEZ!  ;)  I was very happy to meet all of you: cspot, slugs,
everyone.
  And the police... beyond calling in the fire department and medics for the
medical emergency, all they did was hang around in front, ticket cars, tow the
ones that were blocking access, and leave.  I think with Connection we really
established a reputation, as ravers, of being somewhat trustworthy as far as
what happens on the beach itself.  I mean, I was hanging around up on the 
ridge for the majority of the time they were there, and they didn't even 
bother to come up and see what was going on, despite the fact that there must
have been ~600 cars total in front of the beach, up the road, in Davenport,
etc...  Amazing.
  And the best part is - we left the place immaculate.  Better than when we
arrived.  People got the hint when someone brought out the trash bags, and
when I left around noontime, all the trash was in bags waiting to be taken 
over the ridge to the road.  When I left there were about 200 people still
there, many of whom probably stayed to day there, just chilling on the beach.
I would have done so if I didn't have to come into work today. 
  As for the future of Bonny Doon:  Malachy agreed that there shouldn't be 
another one there for a while, just to let things cool down with Santa Cruz
a bit, also because if it becomes regular there it would get out of hand and
finding new locations is a trademark of the FMR's anyways.  Maybe in a few
months we can return, maybe this time doing a combination of the shuttles
and parking on BD road.  
  As a parting note, I want to say hats off to Carl Wescott, eyethink@cse.ucsc.
edu, for initially suggesting Bonny Doon as a site for raves back in... May?
It's a perfect site, and someone ever tries to stage a Woodstock for raves,
I think we found our place!

Subject: First Aid and raves


Well, there IS a solution, the Red Cross offers first aid courses
at a varity of levels for very little money.

The courses Offered which are related to Us are:

	STANDARD FIRST AID
	This course includes Adult CPR skills and first aid
	skills including the Secondary Survey, First Aid for
	Bleeding, Shock, Burns, Diabetic Emergencies and more.
	Upon successful completion the student will receive an
	Adult CPR and a Standard First Aid certificate.  (Meets
	most OSHA requirements for first aid training)
	Time: 9 hours Fee: $35.00

	STANDARD FIRST AID PROGRESSION COURSE
	This course is for individuals who hold a current Adult CPR
	certificate or another American Red Cross or American Heart
	Association Certificate that includes Adult CPR.  This course
	is essentially the second-half of the Standard First Aid course.
	Time: 5 hours Fee: $24.00

	CPR: BASIC LIFE SUPPORT FOR THE PROFESSIONAL RESCUER
	This is the course for anyone who has a duty to respond!
	It includes the skills taught in Community CPR and teaches
	you how  to perform 2-Rescuer CPR, how to use the pocket
	resuscitation mask and airway management techniques (i.e.
	Mounth-to-Nose, Modified Jaw Thrust.)
	Time:12 hours Fee: $45.00

	COMMUNITY CPR
	Community CPR instruction is thhe program that teaches skills
	in rescue  breathing, first aid for choking and CPR for adults,
	children and infants.  This is a nine-hour course and you must
	attend all sessions in order to receive certification.
	Time: 9 hours Fee: $35.00

	ADVANCED FIRST AID/ ADVANCED WILDERNESS FIRST AID
	For those who have a special interest in first aid, (e.g., you
	want to become an EMT, you are part of an emergency response
	team at work)   This is a 60-hour, intensive, hands-on course.
	The Wilderness First Aid course emphasizes emergenciies that
	occur while in the wilderness and utilizes materials thatt are
	accessible to hikers,, campers and backpackers.
	Time: 60 hours Fee: $65.00


Call your local red cross chapter for a schedule of dates and times.
I myself am signed up for the first two Sandard First Aid courses,
after I complete these classes, I'll take BASIC LIFE SUPPORT...
This will take me till the end of the year to complete.  After I'm
done with these, if I feel that I really want to do this, I'll take
the ADVANCED course.  I want to encourage as many of you out there
as possible to take at least a basic CPR or STANDARD FIRST AID course.
If we are going to continue to have raves in places like Bonny Dune
which are remote and secluded we need to be ready for emergencies.
The authorities will also look more favorably on us if they see us
behaving like a community and taking some responsibility.  One of the
things that worries me about some (but most certainly NOT all) of the 
British ravers that I have encountered, is that they want to have fun
and feel like they have a right to come to a site and have a rave, they
get riled at the authorities for shutting them down, but they don't want
to clean up after themselves or take precautions to assure that people can
be safe at a rave. 

Maybe as an incentive, ravers who have RED Cross First aid traing can get a discount of of the price and EMTs, MDs or others with verifiable First Aid
credentials could be admitted for free.  This cost the promoters almost
Nothing, what  they get is immediate recognition of who has Emergency Training
they know exactly how many of these people they have  on site and they get coverage for free.  What they may need to invest in is a complete first aid kit
which most likely cost about $200.

geoff's idea is a really good one.  I used to live in Alaska and do some

having been able to help the badly thrashed a couple of times, I now realize
just how thin the margin is between having an Xstatically good time and
being on death's doorstep.  People with good first aid skills make any large
gathering a lot more likely to come off without tragic consequences.  Good

Just an update,
	If you take CPR:BASIC LIFE SUPPORT...
	followed by the STANDARD FIRST AID PROGRESSION...

	Then you have a full compliment of life saving skills.

	STANDARD FIRST AID is a good ONE COURSE solution in that
	you learn ADULT CPR and basic first  aid.

	IF you already know CPR take STANDARD FIRST AID PROGRESSION.


	CPR:BLS teaches you how to do 2-person CPR and CPR on infants
	and children.

I complete agree: it is very goth.  If you went with what people

reasonable amount of industrial albeit on the commercial side.
They're always saying, however, that we'll play what you guys want.
Maybe we need to tell them what we want.  As far as other industrial places,
Terminator and Krash Klub are also alternatives (the latter being

I also agree.  Some people get out of hand (I got pretty bashed at
Front Line Assembly).  There is afterall a mosh etiquette:  keep the arms
from swinging (I've seen a guy who thought he was a helicopter), don't raise 
your feet up (where someone can get kicked) especially if you're wearing 
boots, etc.  Also, if you're 230 pounds and/or 6 feet tall, take it easy.  
I find that there is only maybe one or two that get out of
hand and you can tell they are inexperienced.  If they get too
obnoxious, I tend to "help" them with their problem.  Likewise,
you or a burly friend can also "help" them.

CHP Clears parking lot that wasn't

Those people who partied along the ocean at Bonny Doon Road and
Highway 1 north of Santa Cruz on Saturday night needed a good
night's sleep to deal with what they found when they woke up
Sunday.   [woke up?  are they kidding? ;^)  -Carl]

Their cars were gone.

In their zeal to celebrate, it appears they had made a 
fundamental miscalculation.

"They didn't park their cars along the road," a California 
Highway Patrol officer explained.  "They parked *in* the
road."

The CHP had at least 8 cars towed from the site early Sunday,
removing a bottleneck in Bonny Doon to through traffic.
Officers didn`t know if the revelers had been drinking,
and didn't seem to concerned about it Sunday - after all,
nobody was driving anywhere.

That's the article in its entirety.  Seems like the local

        The situation was dealt with as reasonably as could have been dealt
with. We assumed that the guy was just having a particularly bad trip, and
had some minor burns. The idea was to just keep him down, keep him from
hurting himself any further, and anyone else in the process, and then see
how serious his problems were when the sun came up. Then, he grabbed
randomly at some guy who was walking by. That guy coincidentally was a
naval medical technician, who told us that what he had were third degree
burns on his hands and feet. We eventually got enough people together to
haul him up to the highway, and then I found a cop who was ticketing some
of the cars at the head of BD road and got him to call the paramedics.
After he was hauled away to the hospital, Jesse (one of Malachi's friends)
and I went to the hospital to see how he was doing. He was tired and
scared, but in reasonably decent shape.

        Suggestions for the future:

        (a) Yes, have some sort of EMT person on hand if at all possible. I
know Doc comes to a lot of raves, but realistically we should have at least
a first-aid kit or something at EVERY rave.

        (b) some way of coordinating in case of emergencies such as this. 

        I would say that, given the information we had at the time, what we
did was as much as we COULD do. It was only the sheer and utter luck of
Jason (the burned guy) grabbing at a guy with medical training that we
realized just how serious his condition was. Furthermore, it was equally
lucky that there was a Santa Cruz county sheriff ticketing cars there at
the time. Without him to call in the paramedics, I doubt that we could have
either flagged down a CHP or found someone with a car phone in time.

        Additionally, the people in charge of the sound were very reluctant
to get any word out over the speakers at all. I tried once around 4:30, and
then again around 5:30 to get them to ask for Jason's sister, so we could
let her know that her brother was in the hospital. They refused, however,
claiming that they had no microphones. I explained that you COULD do it by
speaking into the headphones, but they refused, claiming that it was still
impossible. Nonetheless, at around 11:00 in the morning, Brian finally
managed to get access to the headphones/speakers. And we STILL weren't able
to contact his sister, which means that, for all we know, he's STILL in the
hospital in Santa Cruz.

Subject: FMR and an FMR casualty

        This is the second time typing this, since soda died for
approximately an hour and a half part way through the first time, but here
goes...

	Brian and I got to the beach early, around 9:30 or so, to check
things out. Forrest and some friends of his were there, as well as several
groups of local people with bonfires, tents, etc. I'm sure things quickly
got interesting for them... The fog was in, and was so thick you couldn't
see the moon at times, by FMRs have gone on in more inclement conditions, so
we left the beach for a while, got in touch with Malachi, and told him it
was a "GO."

	We got there for the second time around 11:45 or so, and by then
there were quite a few ravers parked semi-properly and milling around,
waiting for something to happen. While Brian was in the parking lot telling
people where to park, I was on the ridge, making sure that everyone found
their way down safely, and having anyone who'd parked within sight of the
road move, although apparently quite a few people chose to ignore that
request.

	We heard from Malachi that the music was supposed to arrive around 1
or so, but people were getting more and more annoyed as time went on,
although they were understanding. I also noticed quite a few non-ravers
there, as well as a LOT more alcohol than at either of the previous raves at
Bonny Doon. (typical raver comments: When's the music starting, who's
spinning, etc.; an actual comment from a non-raver: Dude, I think we can
score some acid).

	About the time the music was starting, someone came up to me and
said that there was a guy dancing naked in one of the fires. I went over,
and saw that people had finally subdued him. Will Penna, non-sfraver Eric
Lee and several others had covered the guy with a blanket and were trying to
talk him down from what was apparently a bad reaction to some substance, the
identity of which was never ascertained.

	From what I later found out, the guy (whose name we found out was
Jason) had stripped off most of his clothes (he was down to nothing but a
tee-shirt by the time I got to him) and was jumping in and out of a couple
of campfires and had also jumped into the ocean (thanks to a friend of Will
Penna's for pulling him out). He sustained some burns in the process, the
seriousness of which we were not to find out until later.

	Eric, Will, a friend of Malachi's name Jesse, several other people
and I spent the next hour or two to try to talk him down from whatever "up"
he was on. We really weren't qualified to diagnose his burns, so we just
sorta assumed they weren't bad, and that it was more important to just keep
him warm and safe. Someone had a blanket on him, and I scrounged up a
sleeping bag. Unfortunately, he wasn't the most cooperative sort at the
time. He would get out of the bag, complain he was cold, get back in, and
then get really paranoid and hop back out. He also mumbled on and off about
Jesus and about fires, but we eventually got his name and tried to get the
DJs to stop the music temporarily (it had barely started by the time this
entire situation happened) and ask for his sister. They refused, claiming
that it was impossible for them (see my gripes post for further details).

	After a while, Jason got up and started walk er... staggering
towards one of the fires, calling everyone around him assholes, and just
being seriously paranoid. Then, in a sudden fit of lucidity, he grabbed at a
guy who was passing by and asked him for help. Turns out this guy was an
off-duty naval medical technician, who immediately diagnosed the burns as
3rd-degree, in other words, SERIOUS.

	Well, I scrounged up about 2-3 big guys, and then the six of us (me,
Jesse, the naval guy (whose name I never got), a friend of Will Penna's, and
one or two other guys) carried Jason off the beach and down to to parking
lot. Once he was down on the highway (not the most fun experience - he was
heavy, going up that sandy slope), I ran off to try to flag down a highway
patrolman or state trooper or something in order to get the paramedics.
Fortunately, one Santa Cruz County sheriff was at the head of Bonny Doon,
ticketing all of the most poorly cars.

[me]  Officer, we need to call the paramedics - someone fell into a campfire
and has 3rd degree burns all over his hands and feet. We have him at the
north end of the parking lot.

[him] Grrr... Is this what they call a rave?

[me] (thinking quickly) Uh, I really don't know - all I heard was that there was going to be
dancing and music at Bonny Doon, so I went. Look, we really need the
paramedics.

[him] No one knows ANYTHING around here, do they. Where are you from.

[me]  Uh, San Jose (about 5 years ago).

[him] That's where everyone seems to be from. And they'll probably leave the
beach an utter mess.

	He seemed VERY displeased at the situation, but more concerned with
punk kids from San Jose messing up his beach than the burn victim, but he
reassured me that the paramedics would be on their way. After about 5-10
minutes, some volunteer paramedics from Davenport came, as well as two more
cars of Santa Cruz PD. The identified himself as a naval med technician to
the paramedics and then briefed them on the situation.

	Soon, everyone that had carried Jason from the beach other than
Jesse and myself left, leaving Jason in the hands of the paramedics. They
cleaned his wounds off and wrapped them in sterile solution. Jason, when
asked, told them that he'd been drinking a little bit, I honestly don't
believe him, and I don't think the para's did, either. There ensued a short
debate by the medical experts as whether to carry Jason by ambulance to
Dominican Hospital (which was about 12 miles away) or to evacuate him by
helicopter to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, which has a special burn
clinic. Finally, they decided that the chopper would take too long, so they
packed him away into an ambulance and headed off to Dominican. At this
point, Jesse and I went back to the beach, he to get his car keys, me to get
some ID in case they needed it at the hospital.

Brian writes:
> He did say he was candyflipping

	No! That's not true! Someone was speculating that that was the case,
but that was never confirmed. He never told anyone what he was on, and I was
with him almost nonstop from the time he was pulled out of the fire until
the ambulance left.

	When we got back to the parking lot, the ambulance had come back,
and they'd called in the chopper. They were about to set up an LZ right in
the middle of Highway 1, but the pilot came in to about 2 miles away and
then decided that the fog was coming back in too quickly, so he left. The
ambulance then headed off to Dominican.

	Jesse and I went to the hospital, where we found Jason in the
emergency room, his hands and feet dipped in saline. The doctors told us
that he'd be all right. We left after we were sure that they had his name
and address, and we left to find his sister.

	Unfortunately, we never did find the sister. I looked around for
about an hour or so, again tried to get the DJs to page her, and then gave
up and went to sleep. I woke up to the sounds beautiful sounds of techno in
the sunlight, and the next day was just gorgeous. I danced for about a half
hour or so and then left to try to find Jason's sister. Brian FINALLY
convinced to DJs to get a message out over the speakers, but no one showed
up. Presumably, she'd already left, assuming that Jason had gone home with
someone else. They DID have his name and address at the hospital, though, so
they presumably can get in touch with his parents.

	Brian and I left around 12:30 or so, each carrying out a bag of
trash, and the beach was just immaculate by then, probably cleaner than it
was when we got there.


	A few observations.

o	There were a lot more non-ravers than I'd seen at Bonny Doon before,
but they all seemed to like it. Some I talked to seemed shocked that the
music was starting that late, but I'm sure they enjoyed it. One group had
been camping on the beach since noon Saturday to celebrate one woman's
birthday. I'm sure they got an interesting surprise gift from us...

o	I also noticed a lot more alcohol than at other raves, which had me
worried for a while. Fortunately, it never really got out of hand, and all
the cans and bottles were cleaned up by the time we left.

o	I wish that Malachi would have had someone at the beach a little
earlier. We were there to stay by 11:45 or so, but there were already about
a hundred people there. By the time he showed up with the sound system
around 2:15, there were AT LEAST 300 people. Had Brian and I not been there
directing traffic, the entire event would probably been busted up because of
the police noticing all of the cars.

o	The crowd was HUGE - the largest ever at an FMR, according to
Malachi. Streams of cars from both directions were coming by and heading up
for the rave. For a while, two out of three cars on Highway 1 pulling up
Bonny Doon road. Geoff White counted 450 cars on that road, and, added to
the 100 or so cars parked in the lot and on the highway, as well as in a
couple of places north of the beach and in Davenport, confirms the estimates
of 1200-1500 people.

o	As griped before in my previous posting, I'd like to see someone
with medical training at raves, as well as someone easily visible and known
to have a portable phone. Had the sheriff not been there ticketing cars, I
doubt we could have flagged on down, since there really weren't any to be
seen the rest of the night. If not for him, we would probably have had to
wait for a while for someone to get a car and drive him to the hospital
ourselves.

	The hospital he was taken to is called Dominican Hospital, at the
Soquel Drive exit of Highway one. Special thanks have to go to Will Penna
and his friend, Jesse, Eric Lee, the naval med guy and everyone else who
helped and whose names I either forgot or never got in the first place.

 The "gal" I mentioned originally was probably Jason - I guess I misheard the
gender when Brian was describing the candyflip incident to me. So, only one 
person was actually in a bad way, instead of two.

medical emergencies are concerned, I don't care if Garth is playing
the best set he has ever played in his life and my trip is out by the
fourth world orbiting proxima centauri, if someone is hurt, they need to 
stop the music and announce for an EMT!  This is rediculous. Althouigh in all

     Well the Jason story was pretty well told.  I was actually the one who
started the Jason "rescue" operation (Will Penna's friend BTW).  We were sitting
at a campfire with some folks when Jason appeared and jumped into the fire.  A
couple minutes later I decided to go after him and he led me into the ocean
(which left me soaking wet the rest of the night.).  Will had come along at this
point and we went back to the campfire and after a little while Jason came back
but remained relatively calm then all of a sudden went for the campfire again.
     That was it, I moved Jason away and made a project of keeping him away from
fires and people. He was completely out of his mind at times. I was able to find
out from him that he was 19 years old and had candy flipped and had never
dropped anything before.  Well acid and ecstasy can have a very synergistic
effect on each other when taken together and then figure in the fact that he had
no tolerance for either and probably didn't know much about these drugs or he
wouldn't have done this.  He went through the roof and lost the people he came
with.
     Will cought up with us again and we used his blanket to cover Jason and
another guy from a clothing store in S.F. showed up to help and Jesse (I think
it was showed up.).  Eventually Andrei made it over with Brian right behind. 
Andrei went and got a sleeping bag for Jason (that was your bag wasn't it
Brian?).  Brian took off and we continued trying to manage Jason.  Some of the
new commers seemed to think I was too impatient with Jason until they let him
get away and try to get into another fire and hurl various obscenities to people
along the way.  Eventually,  Jason started comming around alittle bit and began
to feel his burns and seemed to start understanding that he had to stay away
from fires.  Oh ya, and it's probably worth mentioning that at one point with
all the good intentioned help, we had one guy waving his hands around Jason (I
guess he was massaging Jason's aura or something), someone else trying to reason
with him and talk him through it and me just physically restraining him when
necessary.  Kind of exemplifies my argument against leaving these situations up
to whoever happens to be around to volunteer.  Makes it hard to concert an
effort.  
     Yes, Jason started comming around a little and and wanted to be near the
music so we all started heading that direction.  Andrei and someone went on up
ahead or someplace for a moment and Jason and I ran into a guy who thought we
were pretty strange.  I told him what was going on and he said he was a doctor. 
I gave him my flashlight and he looked Jason over and said to get him to the
hospital.  This guy saw that we needed help and pitched in and basically
directed the carry Jason out to the parking lot effort.  When we set Jason down
on a car hood I told Jason to tell the police/medical officials that he had to
much to drink and fell in a campfire.  Someone else chimmed in with "ya, tell em
you drank tequilla, the'll believe that".  The doctor/technician told him to
tell them exactly what he took, that he wouldn't get busted.  I'm glad to hear
he didn't, I don't think handing over a kid wacked out on drugs with burns on
his body to the police in the parkinglot is a good calling card.
     Obviously there are many lessons to be learned here.  First aid and
communication systems are standard with any public affair.  I've even been on
10k runs through the woods were they had water and a four wheel drive to get
someone out if they collapsed.  Drugs aren't the only concern.  You have
diabetics and epilleptics and people who fall off cliffs, etc.  
     The Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic provided rock medicine at large psy-
chedelic concerts for many years by cycling health care professionals and
interns through a volunteer program of some sort.  They may be able to offer
some advice on how to get started, or even want to pull their old booth out of
mothballs and go around again.  Just a suggestion, a place to start.    
     The bottom line here is a lot of people go to raves looking for a socially 
concious/empathetic kind of situation.  Perhaps the promoters could get in step.
Bla, bla, bla, bla!

Subject: motorhead/pit

This will be my last post on the subject.

When Motorhead came on, I was right at the edges of the stage, second row
of standing people. Lemmy was 5ft away from me. It was great, the only
problem is everyone thought so too, a pit started right behind me before
the the band even showed up and got pretty bad (the whole center of the
floor). Some big guys slammed and pushed their way up close. Then some
idiots tired to climb over the crowd's heads to get to the front. I only
lasted 2 songs before I was pushed somewhere else. The pit got pretty
big and I kept getting pushed to the edge of it, and every now and then
someone behind would push me into the pit. It was an oven in there but I
had to keep my heavy bike jacket on for safety. The pit itself seemed to
move counterclockwise, all topless men and very energetic.
The after party at Big Heart City was OK , but compare to a rave it's
a washout. I did smile to a few people that looked surprised and smiled back.
There were a few people in rave clothes there amongst the black leathers.
An array of beautiful bikes were parked outside.
The band was so-so. Upstairs they played Ministry and I had
to get into the pit (no band to watch), it was fun and whenever someone
fell, he/she would get picked up. It was hard work to keep up, but fun.
It's much safer at the center of a pit than at the edge, where someone
flys out out of control.
Was going to go to a rave afterwards, but sleep took over.
Now a mellow pit in a rave would be mega-fun!!

I was at the FMR and saw the ambulance after the fact.
I am also certified in First Aid (WEC), but trying to find me or anyone

Maybe the designated medic or security can wear a blinking hat or badge

wait - i haven]t posted about fmr for a few days.... but now im
confused.... i didn]t post because i was pretty upset and only
recently sorted out the way i felt. so i]m sitting by this fire and
see what seems to be a dead body lying so many feet away. i lookj
closer and it just seems to be someone passed out. of course we all
know its jason. so jason gets up and begins ranting. i]ve heard from
someone else this is the guy who throws himself in fires. and so
this bunch of x-heads sits there watching him. finally he makes a
move and i get up and block him. everyone]s still sitting. my friend
stands up, he doesn]t know much about the scene or the drugs so he]s
waiting for me to make the next call. people are hanging mindlessly
and i]m pissed off that groups as a whole have the mentality of
sheep. i keep sort of shoulder checking him to a stationary
position, wandering what to do. finally i ask someon - i think it
well i just ask if anyone has a blanket. so people get up and
someone sort of gives me one... now i]m pissed people couldn]t get
it together to get this person a blanket when the problem was in
earlier stages. so then i ask, i think its paul to watch him for a
minute and my friend and i go gte andre who we met earlier carrying
 speakers. by this point i]ve competely lost touch with the group i
was with, so andre and i still think its paul and eric the fashion
guy are taking care of him..... i check back later, feeling guilty i
didn]t stay and they tell me his name is jason, and asked me to try
and find people who knew him. i didn]t, and then my ride wanted to
take off. i convinced them to stay a while longer and by the time we
left i saw all the emergency vehicles outside.

i]m still the crowd mostly reacted with indifference. people had
been spotting him all night, and they did nothing...

also i felt very spoiled that my going out and having fun can get
upwards of 30 state employees on the move at 4:00am... what a waste
they could be out dealing with accidents that couldn]t have been
avoided. i]m far from anti-drugs but since the time i started
drinking drinking with my high-school faculty in morning before
classes to the time i freaked out and escaped palo alto law
enforcement in the process i focused on the environment i was toying
around with. we]re not all mature enough to know how any drug will
affect us on any given episode, but we should be fucking responsible
enough to deal with these situations as they occur, and do our damn
best not to waste other people]s time and resources on them. there
are many areas that wouldn]t be able to get the paramedics and the
problems would have much more servere. i]m sure we all know stories.

at this point i feel most people i]ve seen taking drugs are like
kids in a candy store, flaunting their middle-class status and the
safety net that implies with little or no understandiung of the shit
that happens to support their leisure time. granted, we all know
someone who grows their own mushrooms, whatever - but that]s not the
larger issue of of the devicisveness drug industries create and the
violence they]re responsible for.

yes, most drugs should be legal.... but we should do more to make
sure we know how to keep what we]re doing contained and safe, and
act out a positioned ritual of status and boredom turned commodity

Just heard from a friend that today's episode of "Days of our Lives" had a
rave setting, complete with questions about "have you taken the X I gave
you?  No, you'll have a much better time with it!"  
  As a relatively new raver, and as someone who is older than the norm
(that's a statistical reference, not a judgment :) ), I'm really appalled
that the scene has gotten so, er, a, mainstream.  Don't want to be
exclusive, cuz I luv the way I've been welcomed despite (because of) being a
lawyer and such st, but this is really getting out of control.  Only upside,
maybe more people will get into the real spirit of raving.  Sadly, the
perspective of age leads me to the conclusion that such is not the case, but
I am convinced that it's up to us to keep the real scene alive.
Sorry about the parentheticals -- bad habits from dropping footnotes like
guano to fertilize legal arguments.

i diddnt want to ghet on the subject, but someone did mention
the sound problems at fmr...

in the hour and a half that i was there before the sound started
going, i stoppeed by the booth a few times to see what was going on
i really think they had no clue what was going on, and i make my living
as an electrician/light/sound tech.  they we're running zip-cords all
over the place, for gods sake!  i really wanted to ask them if they needed
help, but a) i knew they would have told me to piss off and b) i would have
wanted to tear all their stuff down and start over properly and organized.
they diddnt even have a *light* to see with, even though their g
jennie was pumping out power for hours.

but, even with their lateness and disorganization, people had fun 
doing lots of drugs in the meantime, and it was a nice effect when
the music finally started.  and when it started, i immediately got the
killer place at the giant fire i had been drooling over.

Wow, the messages about FMR are amazing..I was talking to a

her about what time the music started, the parking tickets, 
the fires, the cold, and Jason...this is great..

The fox show should be abhorrent.

I caught that Sharon alert....I will just assume right now that the
sharon raves have decreased in fun value...it's wednesday, folks,

meet some of you all...still gotta figure out how toget a pin made...

Also, I have gotten in the habit of buying rave Cd collections..I know,
it sounds awful, but I mean, I need the music to wake up and work to...
I was wondering if any of you had any suggestions.  I have gone to BPM
in the city, but I can't afford it...any suggestions are appreciated.
I got a really cool (fairly new) Garth tape, which is a fiiiine tribal

Like I said, this one scares me.  Please don't take this personally, but
it is a hell of a lot more important for the medical personnel (sure, not
necessarily the police, though...) to know
EXACTLY what has been ingested by someone needing medical attention than
it is to worry about what impression they might get of a rave.

Chances are, someone in critical need will be given some fairly potent
drugs; drug interaction is serious business especially where amphetamines
(X), depressants (alcohol), and opiates/synthetic opiates are concerned.

>From what I have seen in helping others in need, (especially in this city)
they won't try to bust anyone knowing that they are more likely to
get accurate information if people aren't burdened with the choice of
helping save someone's health/life, or their freedom.
The relevance of what someone has ingested is one for the medical
personnel to judge, not us, as is the severity of someone's injuries.
I respect fully the desire to keep unnecessary medical help from over-
reacting to someone's condition, but if that person at the FMR had
lost use of his feet because people delayed medical help hoping he'd
be OK, it'd be tragic no?

Subject: Sensory Overload

I think one of the things I (sometimes) attempt to achieve at a rave,
in a trance, is sensory overload.  Or perhaps to get into a trance.
The rave setting provides the visuals and lights/strobes for sight,
the intensity and volume of the music for hearing, and the dancing
and feeeeel of the bass for touch.  (OK, no jokes about Blo-Pops for
taste.)  Plus, one could imagine what might be present to assist in achieving
mental overload.  The combination is, for me, a spiritual state;  a
state in which normal left-brain thinking is completely squelched,
a feeling of intense internalized power and amazement.

I love pits, good aggressive, non-violent ones.  Rather than being
`bonding' or `affection' necessarily, although those can be there,
it is for me one of the ultimate sensory overloads for touch/physical
sensation/pain to slamdance.  The other elements are present - punk
provides one of the ultimate auditory overloads.  The humans thrashing
around me is an intense visual overload.  I have achieved similar
mental states at punk shows, although shorter and sometimes marred
by worrying for my physical safety.

I'd recommend one for any student of the mind.

===========================================================
"WAX or the discovery of television among the bees" (85:00)

Since that time, the film version has successfully opened in New
York. If you want the reviews, a description, etc. I have a 62k
text file I can send you. Write me at :

I made the film, and now I have to get it shown (i.e. I am self-

To warm you up, here's a bunch of quotes:

William Gibson (author, Neuromancer, Count Zero, etc.) on WAX:

"Winningly strange video narrative from a singular talent.
Authentically peculiar. Like something from the network vaults of
an alternate universe."

Larry McCaffery (editor, "Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook
on Cyberpunk and Postmodern Fiction", Duke University Press):

"WAX strikes me as a truly major accomplishment, intellectually
rich, verbally inventive, visually stunning, and -- perhaps most
remarkable of all -- as emotionally resonant as any film I've
come across in recent years."

Brooks Landon (author, "Aesthetics of Ambivalence: Rethinking SF
Film in the Age of Electronic (Re)Production", Greenwood Press)

"WAX is like no movie you have ever seen. Call it postmodern,
postcyberpunk... or post cinema, the point is this 85 minute
celebration of the possibilities of "electronic cinema" may well
indicate the future direction of SF film, if not "film" itself.

William T. Vollman (author, "You Bright and Risen Angels", "The
Iceshirt", "The Rainbow Stories", all Penguin/Viking Press)

"I admire your dark and paranoid visions in all of their
intergalactic complexity."

Timothy Leary

"WAX is a treat for the eyeballs, a delight for the receptor
sites, a brilliant illumination for our left brains and our right
brains!"


Here are the screenings:

Subject: hey!

This is an idea that I'm sure is not too original.. but I thought I'd make it
official by sending it to you ravers out there.

How about one or a group of us getting together to make up some nice t-shirts
for SFRavers.  I think that with the diverstiy of people reading the postings,
we could come up with several people that have the capital and resources to
get some made up.  Most people affiliated with fraternities or sororities
probably know of a place that will screen the shirts without having to order
thousands of them.  Besides, - if the design is good enough, we may be able
to sell them to others that do not read the postings.

Kick the idea around.... I'd take the initiative myself, but it's not really
practical seeing that I'm in Pennsylvania.

We could have a "contest" for the design - leaving the decision to a vote from
all interested and it would be nice to run into people wearing the shirts at
raves.

Send your opinions to SFRAVES.

BTW - after reading the postings about the Jason incident... I was really
happy to hear that peopl out there do care for others.  After all - it
would have been much easier to just not pay any attention to the guy and go
on.  Instead - a few people cared eonugh to get this guy medical attention
and make sure he was ok.  Three cheers to all those involved.

	For the benefit of those who haven't been here long, I'll recap the
SFRaves logo and button history....

	Around April we thought it would be cool if we could identify ourselves
to each other at raves by wearing something - I came up with a design and had
about 50 buttons made of it.  And then at the picnic we held in May, Jai
Gosine brought a button-making machine and people who were there were able to
custom-make buttons based upon that first design (it was basically a happy
face, with X's for eyes, a smile, and a big "SFR" across the front).  People
wore (and are still wearing) those, and LOTS of connections were made.

	Around the end of July people were jonesing for more buttons, so
I sat down and thought of a new design.  I wanted something based upon the
letters "SFR" and somewhat, er, striking.  So I came up with something 
looking like a cross in the middle of a nuclear cloud.  Something like
this:

	******************************************************
      **			   *			      **
     *				   *				*
     *		    *******************************		*
     *				   *		    		*
      **			   *			      **
	*********		   *		      ********
		 **		   *		    **
		   *		   *		   *
		   *		   *		   *
		 **		   *		    **
    *************		   *		      ************

	(It looked a lot better in PostScript, of course, in a much nicer
font)  I wanted something simple enough that graffiti artists could spray
paint it on walls at warehouses. ;)  

	Well, as can be guessed, a firestorm of debate erupted over the
cross in the middle.  The middle ground we arrived at was that if you
didn't like it, you could simply blot out the left arm of the cross.
It's not like we're getting letterhead made or anything. ;)

	But I REALLY like the symmetry of my design, and the double-entendre.

	We had trouble getting the button machine again, so no new buttons
have been made with this design yet.  However, Joe Brenner (doom@leland.
stanford.edu) has been making T-shirts with these designs on them, for
about the cost of the shirts and paints, by spraypainting through a 
cardboard stencil.  I'm sure he can make them with or without the cross
imagery.

	I'll try and get some buttons made, because they're really a GREAT
way to identify other SFRavers at events without having to ask everyone you
see, "Are you on e-mail too?", etc.  If every SFRaver at the FMR had worn
a button, you wouldn't have been able to glance in any direction without seeing
one. ;)

	So anyways, I'll look into making more buttons.  If you have a design
you think is cool, share!  You can post it in uuencoded GIF format, or just
about any format, and I'll try and read it.  Both the old one and the current
one are on the FTP site, and I can mail them to all interested parties.
If you want to design another one, keep it simple, keep it "ravey", etc.
It must be about 2 1/4 inches around for the button machine.




	Here here with the message of thanx to the FMR angels!  Although I
called Andrei a hero today and he took it as an insult. ;)  I'm agnostic,
but every time we hold an event on Bonny Doon so _many_ lucky things happen
that I can't help but think SOMETHING was "watching over us"....

I forgot to tell you guys/gals but this jarred my memory.  My girlfriend
saw this same thing on one of the soaps (I think it was the same one) about
a month ago.  This new girl with a semi-regular male character is in a bar, 
conversation ensues to the effect of "I know where there's some real action.
I know where there's a rave party."  They go to some wharehouse area, start
to proceed in,  and are stopped at a doorway by the bouncer who says "where
do you think your going?"  "Where going in to the rave party"  "No your not
- you don't look cool"  "Were cool"  "How cool are you?" (as he pulls out
drugs) "What's that?" "It's ecstacy - Here, take some" "Oh, no.  I'm not
taking it" (says semi-regular male character).  Just then the undercover
officer who has been watching this from behind some cheesey prop (oil
barrels or something) comes out and arrests everybody.


Anyway, sorry to have to post bad news.  Enjoy the rest of your day.

I just caught up on sfraves mail of the last few days, and want to add
one final comment/impression of the FMR last Saturday.  When I arrived
at BD Beach, just before the sound started (I was over-the-hill at/near
Shoreline Ampitheatre til past 2 am), I was struck by the strong sense
of a medieval scene.  The dark huddled forms, gathered around the
fires, the distant drumming, and the moon behind the rolling fog...

Also, re the sunrise that someone mentioned (was it Paul
T?):  I went up on the railroad tracks before sunrise (saw Geoff
there too) to check it out.  The moon was right above the ocean
when I looked down past the ravers and the beach, and, turning
around, the other 270 degrees of mountains and sky were filled
with some very nice colors.  It was indeed spectacular.

Here some recent techno/dance cd's I've liked:

Yeah, the ratings are pretty worthless - hopefully the popular 
kaos theories or best of technos can useful benchmarks.  My
current favorite is the Trance collection.  I got it at BPM -
for about $27 (?!?)  Way too expensive.  The big advantage of 
BPM (other than the largest selection around - especially in
vinyl) is that you can listen to new cd's or vinyl before you 
buy them.  Other than that I've shopped at Tower (Mt. View), 
Reckless (Haight), CD World (Palo Alto - their separate techno 
section has dried up lately, though...) Is there anyplace like 
BPM for cd's?  (which is funny considering that they have less 
than 100 cd titles hanging around...)

supposedly you cant get busted for anythign you say to paramedics
or doctors or anything like that if you arent under arrest before
you go in,
you also cant be arrested while you are too zoned to understand
them reading your rights to you... 
but im not sure what the laws really are,
i know at least one person said he was a lawyer, but not knowing
what kind... if anyone _KNOWS_ (as in, has read the actual law, not heard 
about it or seen it on tv or something) what the actual laws on this 
are, it would be helpful.. 
also if you know how well these laws are enforced, it would
be nice too 
(doesnt do any good if they legally cant arrest you but do anyhow...
unless you get a good lawyer, you may be screwed)

BUT, i would say its probably better to be arrested than die,
so telling the people giving you medical assistance what you did
is a good idea
plus there are lots of drugs that can counter the reactions
of things and help you come down a lot faster than you would
hard to give you those drugs if they dont know exactly whats wrong

one other note is that a friend of mine really pumped a ton of stuff
into is body (acid, X, pot, valium, ludes (?), etc...)
and wasnt feeling too well, after he threw up blood, we called the paramedics
and both them and a cop showed up
he told them everything he took with the cop right there
and he is not in jail right now (nor anything like court or whatever)
so theres one case that seemed to work

one thing i did notice from that, though, is that paramedics
tend to be assholes to people on drugs, instead of working
with them, they work against them

i understand, because they deal with people on stuff like PCP and heroin
who arent as understanding about things as people on acid or whatever
so try to stay with someone and work with them, so they dont have
to get all this shit from the paramedics
(they had trouble getting my friend on the stretcher-thing
cuz they were trying to force him on,  one of his friends
just said 'Isaac, get on the stretcher, it'll feel really good'
and he got on)

When I was taking the WEC, there were students and instructors who are 
EMTs, and they have been burnt on calls with raving maniacs, so they
always wait for the cops to show up first before they go in. One guy
in the class is a cop, and he says that they always wait for the
ambulance to show up before they go in because they may scare the
people inside (being a cop and all that) and they don't know enough
 first aid to help them (also the lawsuit issue).
When someone call 911, you really don't know what is going on besides
the sketchy info on the phone.
One EMT guy had to deal with a gunman and had to walk around with
his shorts off (gunman ordered him), while trying to help someone else
who's hurt. I don't remember the details, it was some sordid domestic
sqabble or something.
The cop was just there as protection, be honest to the paramedics
when you are sick enough to need them.

Subject: Logo's Stenciled, Cheap


Look's like it's about time I summarize the Doom Low Tech
SFR T-Shirt business here.  The way I've been trying to do
it, you give me a shirt (or something) and for around $3
(new low price!) I use a stencil and spray paint to put one
of Brian's logos on it.  Lately I've just been making a few
shirts from scratch (too many people keep saying "Damn I
forgot my shirt!").  I'll probably be offering them to
people at the next Alternity for less than $10.

The shirts really do work... people do come up to me and
introduce themselves, and personally I never seem to notice
the buttons (too small).

Anyway, I think Brian's logo looks more like this: 



                   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  
                 **              *               **
                *                *                  *
               *     * * * * * * * * * * * * *       *
                *                *                  * 
                 **              *               **   
                    ***          *           ***      
                        **       *        **          
                          *      *      *             
                           *     *     *              
                          *      *      *             
                        **       *       **           
                * * * **         *         ** * * *   
                                 *     
                                 *

(The size is around 9 inches square.)

I don't mind doing modifications of this stencil with
masking tape, e.g. turning the cross into a conventional F
(or maybe shortening it a bit so it looks like a plus sign).

For colors to choose from, I've got Red, Blue, Yellow, 
Black and now I've got Flourescent Red and Flourescent
Green paint, too.  

If anyone wants to mess with this themselves, just ask me
and I'll tell you what I know about how to do it.  And if
anyone wants to mess with silk-screening or whatever, by all
means be my guest...

Subject: here's what I got

hey you lawless denizens,

I just got off the phone after interviewing a close personal
friend who is a ( my ) public defender and keeps copies of the penal
/ vehicle / health&safety codes at her very competent fingertips.
she went to a really good law school and knows her shit.  for
those of you who don't know, I'm a lawyer, but you couldn't pay
me to practice.

I was taking notes quickly, as both she and I were under time
constraints.  but here's what I got.

section 11550 of either the health&safety or penal code of california
law ( she was actually doing this off the top of her head ) governs
the "under the influence of a controlled substance" situation.
if you are in violation of this section, it's a ninety day sentence
which can be plea-bargained down.  but, the thing is, you CAN get busted 
for being high.  another section of the penal code--647--makes it
so that you can be busted if you're "drunk in public" or "drugged
in public" and unable to care for yourself.  in this situation,
well, let me use her words:

"I have had clients who have called for an ambulance from their home 
because they were in an overdose situation.  the ambulance comes.  so do
the cops.  as soon as they are lucid enough to understand language, they 
get read their rights and arrested."  "also, they may ask you for a 
urine test to 'validate your innocence' -- you're under no obligation
to oblige, and probably shouldn't since such a test will pick up
amphetamine-related ( and do any of us know really what the x is 
being cut with these days ) and of course urine will reveal cocaine.
it probably won't show acid, though if it's been cut with something 
speed-like ( can you "cut" acid ? -- I'm not exactly sophisticated in 
these matters ;^) the urine will reveal it.  also, if the ecstasy is
pure, a urine test may prove in your favor, since they don't
screen for ecstasy, but you need to be *sure* it's pure before
you volunteer any urine."

hope this makes sense.  and any lawyers who can clarify or correct,
please jump in.  I feel personally involved in this discussion because
there was a time long in my past when my friends managed to get me to
medics and keep me away from the police.  thank you cheryl.  

if you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me directly,
though I'll probably reply w/ my standard "uh, if I wanted to be
doing legal research, I'd be getting money for it ..."

I'd like to thank the sfravers and others who have a clue about 
medical emergencies.

I'd also like to comment on tonight's political debate.  I dislike
the use of sfraves for political discussion since I generally assume
your ideas don't match mine.  on the other hand, when the candidates
were asked "what about health care" all they could fucking think of
was $$$ and they all said "uh, cut costs, uh whatever" and it didn't
seem to occur to ANY of them that maybe if we started teaching people
how NOT to get sick, we'd be ahead of the game.

flames, snide remarks, sarcasm ?  I live for it.

Subject: more public defender anecdotes

so this friend of mine, who's way a trip in herself
( she used to live in new york, was once approached
by a gaggle of gangsters calling her "olive oyl" till
she *barked* at them for so long they finally left her
alone ) anyway, she's the public defender in my life

( actually, I have a couple )

and she gets this client, right ?  he's an eighteen year
old rave "filmmaker" who got busted for having less
than an ounce of marijuana and one ( count 'em, one )
hit of acid in his duffel bag after getting pulled over
for some reason ( let's face it, he was tripping ).

anyways, he can't remember enough about what happened
to enable my friend to discern whether it was an illegal
search, but instead, is *quite* intent on doing pr for 
the rave thing about which he is very egotistically convinced
that my friend, who is forty and one of The Cool People, has
never "heard" of, despite the fact that she's been around them
for A Real Long Time Now.  so he's so intent on "explaining" 
"the philosophy"  of raves and all to her, an Original Ravester,
that he doesn't realize that,

a)  she is not on the same side as the cops
b)  she's probably taken way more drugs than he's dreamt about
c)  she's probably way ahead of him when it comes to protecting
    his interests in general

so she explains the facts to him, and he's so caught up in
the "glamour" of his "rave/film/making" lifestyle that she's
forced to hit him over the head with just an occasional harsh
comment ( hey, she's a friend of MINE ).  so she's like,
"well, you can get 'diversion' which means you have to be 
clean for a year and show up once a month somewhere" and he's
like "no way, gotta go to europe to work on my 'rave film'" so
she's like, "well, you can go to court, but, uh, you really don't
remember what happened, and the cops DO, and you might not win,
which means at best ninety days picking up trash on the highway"
and he's like "what ?!"  I might have to pick up fucking trash ?

so can you tell this boy was spoiled as a child or what.

one more remark.  as part of the "diversion process" the
"diverted" one has to attend "educational" eg !drugs classes,
and this dude was like, "uh, instead, I'd like to make an
educational film about raves to provide to the hayward police",
and my friend the lawyer says, "so you want to *snitch* on rave
attendees then" and he's like "no way man I want to show the police
what raves are *really* like, really" and she's like ( forgive the
valley girl lingo, please, old habits die hard ) "well, the police
are interested in one thing, and don't you forget it:  the police
want to bust people, and that's what they get paid for.  if you
make a film to give to the police they will use it to try to bust
people.  your romantic notions are charming in their absurdity.
and no one, repeat NO ONE is gonna tailor a diversion program to
suit YOUR ravish ideals."

so she left him with some thoughts to ponder.
if any of you know this guy, I apologize for mocking him,
but get a fucking clue.  my attitude is, for those of you
still bothering to read, if you know how to manipulate the
police to your advantage, go for it.  otherwise, skip it.

Regarding being under the influence of drugs, it is legal to be under

which are illegal both ways.

Like I said, I've seen 3 such situations, all involving very serious

  Just because it's chemical name contains the word *amphetamine* DOES NOT mean
it is an amphetamine!  This is one of the BIGGEST misconceptions about X.
The key word in that chemical name is METHamphetamine, which is an extra methyl
group (right chem majors?).  This makes it a *different* substance, which
could or could not show up on an _amphetamine_ test.

  I could be full of shit on this one, but everything I've read on alt.drugs
leads me to believe that X is not an amphetamine, it's a METHamphetamine which
is why it's soo different from any other amphetamines out there...

I know we're getting off the rave subject a bit, but supposedly Abbie
Hoffman's last book, "Steal this Urine Sample" has a wealth of information on
drug tests and the like.  I've never read it, but the information that was
passed on to me from friends includes:

      * MDMA shows up as *cocaine* on urine tests for a couple of weeks
      * a penicillin substitute (E-mycin?) also shows up as cocaine, so
	you can tell them you took E-mycin and they'll ignore the results
	or ask you to come back again later after not taking E-mycin. 
	Similarly, Advil shows up as marajuana.  And poppy seeds as opium.
	(Watch out for those poppy seed bagels -- you could end up in jail!)

My roommate is a pyschiatry resident at SF General.  He often has to deal with
people coming in on some drug or another.  He says that if the person is not
cooperating they take blood and urine samples to figure out what the hell they
are on.  This information is never reported to the cops and the cops never
subpoena the records.  He says that it's a good idea to tell them exactly what
you took so that they don't lock you up in the pysch ward if they can't figure
it out.  And there are drugs they can use that act as antidotes to some of the
more popular psychoactive drugs.

OK, I am a chemist (big fanfare).  MDMA (which stands for 
3,4-MethyleneDioxy-(N)-Methyl Amphetamine) is a chemical related to
MDA, Methamphetamine, and amphetamine.  It is more similar to MDA, in that
the biggest difference between them and amphetamine is the methylenedioxy group
(-O-CH2-O-) attached to the phenyl ring of the amphetamine molecule, which is
a group common to a number of naturally-occurring chemicals such as
piperonal, safrole (a flavoring agent in root beer, and a component of 
sassafras oil), and myristycin (a chemical in nutmeg).
	They are all closely related to amphetamine.  For those analogy buffs 
out there,
MDA:amphetamine::MDMA:methamphetamine

I believe the standard method for testing urine is to pass the sample through
a Gas Chromatograph and to measure elution times.  Briefly, a GC works by
forcing a sample (via gas pressure) through a series of inert, "sticky" 
"capillaries" [<-- very oversimplified] called a column.  Different chemicals,
by the nature of the various functional groups which make up the chemicals,
take relatively more or less time to pass through the column.  They are 
detected as they leave the column.  The amount of each chemical in a given 
mixture is thus determined by measuring the relative amounts after they are
separated by the column.

	Now, if this is the only method used AND they aren't testing for 
MDMA specifically, then it may not show up on the test because MDMA will
have a different elution time than amphetamine.
	HOWEVER, better labs use a linked GC-MS (Mass Spectrometer).  A mass 
spectrometer takes each fraction eluted from the GC and analyzes it by breaking
the chemical down into different groups and analyzing the relative masses of
these groups to get more information about the chemical.  This would definantly
give a positive test for MDMA because it would really be no problem to 
recognize the parts of the MDMA molecule similar to amphetamine using a
MS.

There are other tests (UV spec, IR spec, nuclear magnetic resonance) which
could be used but I'm pretty sure that GC and GCMS are the two they use
in practice.

The bottom line:  If you have to take a urine test, it's not worth taking
the chance that they won't test for MDMA.  Also, if you need medical help, 
definantly tell them if you've on something, because drug interactions can
kill you.  It would be better to risk being busted.

And with about 1/1000th the people. ;)

I was musing over this recently - so far there hasn't been an event
for our scene comparable to Woodstock for the 60's scene.  There's been
lots and lots of smaller events that I will always remember and tell my 
grandkids about, but there hasn't yet been one, big, huge, week-long
rave with a million people where babies were born and a four-hour movie
was filmed and _everyone_ who is anyone was there.  Most of me says this

Yet the raves that happened in English countryside with 20K people and very
little publicity would have seemed very attractive to me.  I think we're
confusing size with promoter greediness.

I think it will eventually happen.  If not here in the states, then in Europe.
I'd think it would be cool to have a Ravestock in Moscow, or Romania, or
Prague.  I would easily charge my plane ticket if I knew this was happening
next summer.

No, but I think a gathering with all the best DJs and bands would be exciting.
Getting people to participate is another question, but once you have something
like that rolling, people would flock to it.  The Orb would probably play at
the drop of a hat, every one else would be questionable.  What other bands/DJs
would you like to see there?  Aphex Twin, Moby, Orbital, GTO, and Lords of
Acid would probably be musts, but I think a tremendous power could come from
the unknowns.

I think it was just a concert.  Assigning any sort of culture zenith or
spiritual relevance to Woodstock is a stretch.  In the film you'll recall the
promoter talking about how much money he was losing.  It was definitely, from
the start, a money making venture.  If there was to be a Ravestock somewhere
in the world, it would have to start with telling MTV to fuck off.

  Have to disagree somewhat wih Pete Ashdown, who says that Woodstock was "just
a concert."  It was more than that. To those of us in or on the edge of the
hippie scene, Woodstock was both a vindication of our values and a kind of
ending exclamation point to the movement.  The hippies tended to form real
communities, and not just virtual communities like the Internet (no disrespect
intended).  Steve Gaskin's Farm, which is still going strong in Tennessee, is yet another manifestation of this drive for real community.  Woodstock was the most public manifestation of that community.
  I frankly don't see that kind of internal coherence to the rave community, in
spite of the individual commitment of people like Pete or Brian.  Ravers seem tobe loners who come together, dance, then go home to their other concerns.  If there are raver communes like Morningstar Ranch, Drop City, or The Farm, then I
haven't heard of them.  
  Your thoughts....?

Yes, I suppose this is a major difference.  However, what percentage of the
half-million attendees to Woodstock went back to their communes?  I admit that
I am too young to understand any of the 60's movement, so all I can judge by
is what I saw in the film.

> I frankly don't see that kind of internal coherence to the rave community,

You are correct sir!  :-)  However, I think that the virtual community DOES
count for something.  Communes of the Woodstock variety tend to shy away from
technology and the future where ravers embrace it.  Do you think that
Woodstock was responsible for the communes, or was it just the
anti-establishment feelings of the time?  The "Acid Test" parties were more
similar to raves than Woodstock was, but nothing really came out of them
(IMHO).

Subject: Woodstock or Ravewood? Was(Re:FM)

Well, I was 12 or 13 when woodstock happened.  I was not aware of the
"scene" until I became part of the cultural "shock wave" that spread-out
in Space/Time after woodstock.  What I remember as a 12 year old was hearing
about it on the news.  I remember my feelings clearly, I thought, no felt
something really beautiful and profound had taken place, I didn't quite know
what it was at the time, but I remember feeling a sense of Hope.

I believe the rave scen, if it is to survive will most likely have a cosmic
event like that.  I we all just get in the floww, it cab happen.
We need to operate in small interconnected groups.  Our strength is in
our ability to erxhibit "decentralized  C3I".  To the extent that we
organize and keep our energy clear, we can "open the space" for a woodstock
like event to happen.  You can always plan an event like Woodstock, but
as we all know, the energy, people, organizers and other potential
synchronistic behaviors must be in concert in order for the event to be
wonderful.  I think Brian and I felt some of the awsome energy of knowing that
your taking part in something that 1500 people that you don't know are comming
to.  It's no longer cozy. It becomes more like steering a tanker then like
driving a speed boat.  But wouldn't Bonny Dune be the perfect place?

Subject: ravestock/woodstock


I really don't know that much about Woodstock, other than what I've read or seenor what I've been told, but the general idea t 
hat I had about it was that it was a huge coming-together of people, music, and
nature that kind-of ended up as a gin
giant (sorry this keyboard suck
s like i 
I said  I keep pressing return instead of backspace!!)
ANYWAY
it ended up as a giant love-fest (so I hear), a culmination of the feelings of
the age and a community of common attitudes (so I hear).  Aren't all raves 
this sort of thing anyway?  Just a lot smaller.  What triggered me to think
that FMR was like Woodstock was the fact that it was a bigger, but still
"community" rave, and it was outdoors on the beach and so on....
Like just about everyone else, I avoid big raves, and was really shocked bu
the number of people at FMR---I think it's not big raves that suck, it's
big _commercial_ (ie someone says "hey let's make bucks on the stupid ravers)
raves that suck.  20,000 people could show up, but if it's spontaneous (ie not
hugely advertised-posters fliers announcements on KMEL) and people come with theright attitude (community, love, sharing etc) it could be terrific, like what happened in England.  What a rush--knowing that 19,999 other people are _with_
you, sharing the same experience.
HOWEVER
the day the
the day these things start to happen we'll know that the end is k
near, like t
what happened in England.  Woodstock was the culmination and essentially the
end of that era--Ravestock would probably be the end of ours.
Give it a couple of years--I bet it happens...and what will come next?

By the way, has anybody read "THE IMAGINAL RAVE"--it's a pamphlet put out by
the happy family people (I think) about this kind of stuff--kind of inspiring
kind of out-there, definately interesting.  

ANYWAY, I'll stop babbling now--just wanted to clarify myself.

Keep up the energy and the love...

It's just harder to get caught on them if your smart.  A cop would have
to have probable cause to test you for these or any other substance but

I hope your right Cynthia, but I would strongly encourage anyone
to hire a lawyer if you can beg, borrow, or steal the money for
one.  It DOES make a difference.  In jail they call Public
Deffenders:  Public Pretenders.  I once learned about them the
hard way.  Some of them, I'm sure, are carring people and will
work for you but I wouldn't take the chance on getting one of
them.  It sucks but hiring a lawyer is a formality that shows
the court that your on a different level from the start.  Then,
you have a force on your side who has been bought with your money
and does your bidding.  A lawyer and an assistant DA are at opposition
and haggle for your sentence.  A public deffender and an assitand DA
(who have lunch together) decide your sentence together in a very 
routine manner.  Again, it sucks but it's buying the system.

Utah raves, dude!  SMLC was easily as good or better than most of the raves
I've seen in SF or LA.  Pete really knows how to throw a party.  The space
was excellent (reminded me a lot of a warehouse Mr. Floppy's) and the
crowd was great.  It was a mix of hardcore ravers and clubbers checking
out the scene.  At the beginning of the night it was mostly the clubbers
wandering around, some dancing, some tripping on the video.  Once it got
going the hardcore crowd was dominating the dance floor with their hands
in the air and the sweat flowing.  I found that the Utah ravers love
the hardcore stuff the best - give em 138bpm acid and they eat it up
like candy.  Definitely different from the SF scene now.  Pete rocked
on the Denon while keeping a handle on the whole event.  I was getting
tired just watching him do everything.  The ambient/chill floors were
perfect for kicking and 'njoing.  It was a shame that the cops came
when they did because the energy could have kept it going all morning.

Hi Gang!
Let the world's second oldest raver have a stab
at this.  A lot of good things have already been
said: that Woodstock was "more than just a concert,"
that it was both"a vindication of our values and a
kind of ending exclamation point to the movement;"that the
"Acid Test" parties were more similar to raves than
Woodstock was; that, like raves, much of the concern
of Woodstockers was "to lose your concerns for a while,
not throw them away completely;" and, that mostly,
as Geoff says, it was "something really beautiful and
profound (that) had taken place," a "cosmic event"
where  "the energy, people, organizers and other syn-
chronistic behaviors (were) in concert in order for the
event to be wonderful."  Ithink a lot of us felt some of
that "awesome energy" in those 1500 or so at Bonny Doon.

And rather than "Ravestock," why not Bonny Doon?
Just as Woodstock was east coast with all that that
orientation implies, this generation's will probably be
a Bonny Doon with all that a Pacific Rim orientation
suggests.  It is not only fun to contemplate but
impossible to predict because what will be will be,
and the experience of being here now and participating
in this is the important thing itself! Yes, it feels
like IT is coming...virtual communes, future orientation,                     
all the other"differences" are largely signs of this
generation, not real differences at all.

I've really enjoyed this discussion!  Keep it alive!

Woodstock, we have a new energy and a much more inclusive frame of mind than

I heard (sorry Geoff) someone claim to have inside info that
the folks at DV-8 *are* paying off the cops, but are getting
busted anyway.  He thought that maybe the DV-8 crowd don't
really want to stay open passed 4AM or so... they collect
your money, *and* get to go home early when the cops show-up
on cue.  So my guess would be Juice was busted at around
4AM...  anyone know for sure?

"Ravestock": if analogies/comparisions give you ideas, I
guess they can't be all bad, but I'd personally like to get
away from this neo-hippie business.  Don't be afraid to be
something new.

By the way, the beach wasn't exactly "spotless" after the
last Full Moon.  They hadn't brought very many plastic bags
with them, so when they broke on the trip up the hill people
tended to just abandon them.  There were several ruptured
bags still on the beach when I finally left at 3 PM or so.
So that's one more good thing to bring to raves: garbage
bags.

My fast-talking friend Steve volunteered to work phones at KPFA/B, 
a public radio station here in Berkeley for a couple nights and
then approached the program manager about doing a house/techno
show. The really funny part is that although Steve has a lot of
enthusiasm and charisma, he's never touched a turntable or mixer
in his life.  He makes tapes off of CD's and the radio constantly
and wants to be a DJ but like a lot of us just doesn't have the
funds or connections for equipment.  He impressed her by coming in
and pulling out a walkman with tiny fold-up speakers and his rough
tape and playing stuff for her as well as spewing a lot of BS.
She had never heard techno before and seemed mildly ammused.
Believe it or not, she gave him a tenative O.K. with time slot and
other details to be arranged next week or so after he submits a
paper about himself, which I'm helping him with, and a good tape,
which I'm hoping that one you DJ's on the net might help him with
(Brian, Jon, Eric, anyone else?).  The cool part is that he'll 
need show material for however long the show lasts and anyone
interested in DJing sets on the air or showcasing new mixes or
house/techno songs or whatever is more than welcom too - anytime. 
I'd really like to see this used as an SFR resource.  Brian (and
others):  Do you think this station is small and cool enough for 
you to read the weekly rave list on the air like you used to do for
Techno Attack on KALX?  All comments and suggestions would be
greatly appreciated.  The net via me is Steve's only resource and
he needs help so we could pretty much do whatever we want on this
show.  We could have some fun with this.

I have no problem with the rave guide being read on the air: but if we can 
control it, I think that the person announcing should make sure and announce
only those larger raves, the ones with flyers everywhere, rather than the
smaller cooler ones.  I'd like to see a show on the air, definitely; right now

While KPFA/KPFB is definitely kool, it is definitely not small enough.
The station is rebroadcast all over the place: Fresno, Stockton(?),
etc.  I'm still not clear on whether KPFB carries all the material
from KPFA, but they definitly carry alot of the same material.
Furthermore, KPFA has a strong signal that reaches all the SF bay
area, San Hose (sic), etc. 

So yeah, I guess it won't be a problem if big raves are annouced --
you'll just be acting as an public-broadcasting advertising arm for
Sharon, Destiny, Gathering, Feel-x, etc. At the same time, I wouldn't
want to see "small" underground events like
wicked/fmr/alternity/come-unity getting any more crowded then they
already are.

Subject: Woodstock/Altamont


 ( I've just come home after a long drive from Sacramento, so maybe my 
mood is affected by fatigue. Also, I might ramble some... )

WARNING: MAJOR BUMMER STUFF AHEAD!



 I've just finished catching up to the recent three day's worth of 
postings - I've got some mixed feelings about the Woodstock/Ravestock
thread. On one hand, I admire and am attracted to all the idealism 
and optimism that a lot of SFRavers have re: raves ; but, there is the
fact that the Woodstock/hippie/Aquarius "spirit" did not spread out into 
the general population to any dramatic degree ( Dan Quayle, for example 
). 

 Also, I suspect that the majority of those who where born at the time 
of Woodstock, and who are now in their early twenties, are pretty tired 
of hearing the whole Woodstock/New Age/hippie/Baby Boomer spiel. In 
fact, one of the things I like about raves is that the music is 
radically free from the blues rock/country rock/folk rock/jazz rock/*** 
rock that has dominated "alternative" AND middle-of-the-road music for 
the last five years. Techno & house are truly the music of modern youth, 
something they can call their own [ influences of the previous "avant-
garde" notwithstanding ]. 

 If the late 60's can/should teach us anything, it's that a sea change 
in the mass public opinion cannot be affected by people who the mass 
public cannot identify with. Yes, there were a lot of hippies in the 
late 60's and early 70's, but the silent/moral/"just folks" majority was 
never truly accepting of them except as entertainers. Eventually, I 
think that a lot of the original hippies either took on the protective 
coloration of the mass herd, or moved to protective, tolerant 
enclaves/reservations like San Francisco and Berkeley in Calif., Santa 
Fe in New Mexico, etc.

 The word 'Woodstock' always reminds me of its evil twin, 'Altamont'. 
For those who know about Woodstock from the movie and the nostalgic 
hype, try seeing the Rolling Stone film "Gimme Shelter", which deals 
with the 1969 tour of the USA. The first half of the film has some great 
concert footage, but the final half of the film focuses on the 
disasterous Altamont Motor Speedway concert. Among the bands playing 
that day where the Jefferson Airplane, Santana, and the Rolling Stones. 
The Hell's Angels had been hired to do security, which role they 
concert is notorious for is the Angels killing a man who aimed a gun at 
the stage during the Rolling Stones set. 

 The Altamont concert had been on again/off again for days - the 
Altamont site was announced one day before the concert ( sound like some 
raves of the recent past? ). Also, by the end of 1969, the rise of Nixon 
and the assasinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, among 
other events, had created a subconscious desperation that, I think, was 
just waiting for a triggering event to be manifested. ( What would 
happen if Clinton got shot by a "lone gunman" before the election? ). 
Let me use some quotes from some reviews of both the Altmont concert 
itself, and the film "Gimme Shelter":

 "And there is something ominous and swarming about this gathering.' 
There is too much of something;' wrote Micharl Lydon in Ramparts, 'is it 
the people, the dope, the tension? Maybe it is the wanting, the 
concentration, not just of flesh, but of unfilled desire, of hope for ( 
or is it fear of ) deliverance ...' "

 "The crowd that milled around ... was hardly unusual for a rock 
festival. Straight and stoned, drunk and floating freaks, mingled with 
college kids and super beings in their other wordly robes - people who 
seem to exist only for this kind of event." [ With an updating of 
terminology, that could describe the last Full Moon Rave crowd! ]

 "Everthing is very schizophrenic. Nude chicks and guys slither over the 
sides of the platform, only to get booted, trampled, and lacerated with 
pool cues. Their hair and faces matted with blood they simpllyclimb up 
again. It's as if they wanted to be clobbered." 

[ Above quotes from "Altamont" by David Dalton, from the book "Rolling 
Stones", edited by David Dalton, Amsco Music Publishing Company, 1972 ]


 "...from Woodstock West to the seventh circle of our own Aquarian 
inferno."

 "We blew it at Altamont, 'Gimme Shelter' lets us watch ourselves 
blowing it, and makes us understand how and why."

 "...It's all there: the fear, the freak-outs, the selfishness. People's 
faces are terrible; one can hardly bear to look. The aura of psychic 
distress that characterized Altamont ... is perfectly captured on film."

 "... the fighting continues to break out. Girls cry, people dance, all 
the catch-phrases of the flower children are sent out over the PA, but 
the fighting continues to break out."

 " More seriously, the ending of the film suggests a weird ideological 
angle. The final shots show people walking towards [Altamont] - a 
flashback to early morning. Is the implication that we must return to 
Altamont again and again? If that's the case, [the film] has no 
justification at all. The only possible reason for making the film, or 
seeing it, is to learn from it so Altamont doesn't happen again."


[ Above quotes from "Gimme Shelter" by Michael Goodwin, first published 
in Rolling Stone, 1970 ]


-------


 So, "What the hell's Larry's point, anyway?". Let me see if I can 
figure it out, at 2:45AM Sunday morning -


 If a "Ravestock" is to happen, what can be done/anticipated that will 
prevent another Altamont from happening? And, what can be done if the 
audience brings expectations & desires to the event that is beyond the 
control of the promoters? Is "professionalism" ( a la Bill Graham 
Presents ) antithetical to the budding idealism of many ravers? 

 Of course, the modern generation may not be as idealistic as their
forebearers ( and therefore do not have as far to fall if things get
dark ). 

 So, wadda you guys think?

-------

 Goodnight/morning - pleasant dreams!

Subject: SHARON

Well, This was my first SHARON in a while.  What can I say?
It was _very_ different from ComeUnity and Wicked which is what
I've been used to lately.  A lot of first time ravers and a good
dose of attitude.  It was funny, cause when I ran into M-P-ter and Chris
we all were shocked to see eachother there and figured that everyone would
be a destiny.  Well I all defense, It is our/my  job to channel The Light
wether it be at Sharon or something special like the FMR.  I realezed
that I could send the same energy at SHARON as I could send at
FMR and why shouldn't I ?  So I began to do that and the whole scene
changed for me (although it was about 4 am by this time and all the rowdies
had gone home).  I don't know If I'll go to future Sharons I really
don't want to spend $20 anymore when I can go to great rave like ComeUnity
Wicked and FMR for just $5-$10.

The Space that Sharonm got was absolutely awsome.  I kept thinking what
we could have done with a space like that and the money that Sharon
put into it.  I did a _small_ and very selective amount of flyering
at SHARON for Alternity2, just a few sorta new people that I have seen at the last FMR and ComeUnity.

Due to circumstances completely within my own control, I didn't make it out
to a rave this weekend.  How were they?  Inquiring minds want to know!
Also please post any new flyers you get... I did get to cruise Haight
yesterday but came up dreadfully short of anything new.

Oh, and the great news is:  Moonpup said he'd DJ at Alternity 2 for us!
Hoo-ray!  The date has been confirmed for the 30th, the night before
Halloween.  So far all we're up against is Basics (but as I said before,
if it's in a warehouse again I wouldn't go anyways. ;)  As before, it'll
be $5, or free if you bring a floor fan.  I've been a little behind in
planning this due to school and Other (tm) forces, but it's definitely
happening.

Oh yeah, one last comment about Haight Street - I couldn't turn in any
direction without seeing someone wearing a "Jive Fresh" ski cap or a
Sjobeck jacket or baggy pants.  Yes, rave fashion has become king on
Haight.  *sigh*.

For those of you who didn't get out (ie. Brian)--Destiny rocked/grooved/raved it all 
it all night long--reminded me a lot of the Basics at the Stone last month.
Cool space, unbelievable spinning (Garth is my personal shaman I've decided)
intense energy.  Very hot, cuz the warehouse was small, low roofed--I like
it hot, because it heightens the intensity and increases the energy...something
about 1000 sweaty bodies grooved to the same beat.  Don't know about Sharon,
but a lot of people showed up at Destiny saying that the Sharon thing didn't
happen (cops showed up and closed it off ??? so I hear)--definately think
that Destiny was the place to be this weekend.....myself, I think I've 
permanently lost my hearing by gluing myself to the speakers for four hours--
didn't climb down until five in the morning.
But hey, that's my humble opinion...anyone disagree???
I realized today that I couldn't remember the last _bad_ rave I went to--
what a great feeling!!
Keep the energy and the love....see you all next weekend!!!

Subject: Re: Woodstock/Altamont

Larry (Cassandra)--
Indeed your thoughtful response showsthis aspect of
your persona! I've shied from the Woodstock/Ravestock
name, preferring a Woodstock/Bonny Doon analogy pre-
cisely because while there a re interesting comparisons
there are important contrasts, too. Your point--which
coincides with what a lot of us have seen--about the music,
and that being parallel to other aspects of the current
culture scene, i.e., techno/shamen, future/past,
inclusive/broader based, etc.--shows more a new paradigm
than a repetition of a 60s retromodel.  The only part
of your article that I have some reservations about is the          
following:

If the late 60's can/should teach us anything, it's that a
sea change 
in the mass public opinion cannot be affected by people who
the mass 
public cannot identify with. Yes, there were a lot of
hippies in the 
late 60's and early 70's, but the silent/moral/"just folks"
majority was 
never truly accepting of them except as entertainers.
Eventually, I 
think that a lot of the original hippies either took on the
protective 
coloration of the mass herd, or moved to protective,
tolerant 
enclaves/reservations like San Francisco and Berkeley in
Calif., Santa 
Fe in New Mexico, etc.

(Sorry it didn't print entirely correctly!)
I think you're ignoring the aspect of cultural growth
and influence; you account largely for those who opted
out in one way or another, but not for those who con-
tinued to develop the consciousness that the 60s had 
taught them...and there are millions of them. I've 
personally kept in contact with about 35 members of
the Elk Grove (CA) High School class of '65, admittedly
a rather precious microcosm of that larger group, but
others have done similar, albeit more formal studies,
showing that "no man is an island," inessence, that
there has been a contiguous political, social, psyche-
delic culture and inheritance.  My 20 years teaching
at Santa Cruz High School (and what a cultural contrast
that is to the Sacramento Valley town I tought in from
1960-70 it is!) further reinforces this awareness.  Yhe
sons and daughters of 60s parents--no matter what the
orientation of those parents--have inherited a history they
may not be able to articulate verbally, but their con-
ceptualizations--whether it be choice, the environment,
political rejection of the tweedledee-tweedledum of
Demorepubpolitik, of acceptance of matters of race, sexual
orientation, lifestyle, you name it--are almost light
years ahead of those of the generation before them.  When
I attended the 20 and 25 year reunions of classes from the
Sacramento Valley that impression was only reinforced 
more, not negated.

None of this is to say that we can take anything for granted.
There were some of us going to Altamont that had grave
reservations about the Hells Angels monitoring it, even
though there had been some good experiwences with them
and the hip working together.  Many of us sensed this
was to be the underbelly because of the timing, the ominous
national events in the air, the groundless, mindless
comparisons to Woodstock.  After all Monterey Pop had
happened not far away, just three years earlier.  The
quotes you cited show the prescience that a lot of
people had about it, of its place in the cycle.  My
point is mainly that we haven't come to a parallel of
the Woodstock awareness yet--and that things like the Rave
Conference and chats like this are necessary preamble to
that, whatever that is gonna be!

I'm glad I went to destiny last nite:  the music was TOTALLY hot, super
visuals, great space for a rave.  I love the idea of having a rave in a
totally random generic office park - plenty of parking, and I can't imagine
that anyone felt unsafe out there!  My only complaint and it's major, was the
crowd.  I felt that the crowd was really clique-ish;  it was really
hard to make any sort of connection with people.  I went by myself, and
I guess I just can't go by myself anymore until I know some more people
(read: get to know some SFRavers as more than just email addresses).
I felt that people went in couples or small groups and had absolutely
no interest in looking out to other people.  Fortunately, I did talk to a
few people that didn't fit that mold.  I particularly enjoyed talking with the 
people who set up the ambient space.  But, other than those few cases, I felt
that most of the crowd was only interested in looking cool.  I went to
Lighthouse in Santa Cruz a few weeks ago, and for some reason I didn't get that
same feeling about the crowd. Hmmm.  By the way, could someone else who 
was there post the order the DJs were in?  This was the first time I have
heard Josh Jeno and Garth.
See ya later

The idea of being on KPFA is very exciting ... I work rite near the
little Cal station that Brian had his program on & I had trouble
picking it up; KPFA is heard all over N California (at least as far as
Santa Rosa & the Sierras), & is also fed thru many of the local cable

people will get to hear music they have never heard before.  But
announcing events over it may not be the best idea.

Remember KPFA is primarily a strong voice of the political Left and
does tend to be the champion of many "alternative" lifestyles.
We should use their 50,000 watts to educate folks out there.

Well, Destiny RULED.  I had a great time...the DJs were awesome,
the energy was clean, and the people (I met) were really cool.

If any of you SFRavers were there, I was the guy with the blinking 
red light, tripping people out...

Jeno played until around 6 in the morning, and Garth went on right
after him. Jeno was outtasight, really.  The space was a great space, not
too big, but not too small.  There were just enough things too look at and
people to visit to make the whole thing worth the $15 "donation."  good parking.
I like having car in a well-lit place...makes everyone feel better.  I 
was there until 6:30 or so, and it was great, at the end of my stint, with
everyone standing, wving their arms, yelling...there was this guy with the 
air horn who was hilarious.  I found the crowd really cool, actually.  I always
like getting little gifts..some guy had some first aid ice packs....fanTASTIC.

I haven't been able to get to a rave since the awful groove-a-thon...
I heard from (sorry) a friend that Sharon was busted as well...but I don't
know for sure.  I am closer to Destiny, and it was a beautiful time.  This
was my first party not San Francisco-oriented, if you know what I mean.  
After living at home all summer, I got really used to the SF scene, but
there were lots of poeple from the City there last night.

I don't know, I like the indoor spaces right now because it just is gettting
too coooold these days...this was the second best indorr space I was in...I 
really liked the Mysterious Salad location months ago...HUGE space, no one
to fill it up, unfortunately.

I hoped I danced with some of you all last night, if not..I will see you
at Alternity 2 (and then maybe Basics?? I don't know...)
Hope you all had a great weekend..have a short week...

-- clothing was interesting, at least I thought
-- BEAN BAGS ( more later )
-- no glass on the floor ( for those of you who

-- way way too crowded.  I personally don't like to crash
   into others UNintentionally and I don't like them crashing
   into me when I'm concentrating on the music.  this couldn't
   be avoided at wicked, I don't care how fucking graceful you

of people who were affected by the ideas of woodstock is very
very much larger than the number of people who attended.

ALso, the concept of woodstock has become a popular cultural
symbol.   To date, I don't think that Raves have become that,
which is not to say they won't.  But rather that it is very hard
to judge what trends are important socially and culturally until
a few years down the road.  

I think that comparing the FMR rave to woodstock may be
a fair comparison based on the experience of people who attended
but not in the sense of the FMR influencing the mass media
and mainstream america.

Just a thought.

Destiny was far and away the best rave I have ever been to, and for one reason:

The Crowd.

All of you there were so awesome!  The feeling of peace and brotherhood was
amazing.  I was so happy to just walk around with my friend Mike (blinker guy)
and just say "what's up" to everyone around.  There were no hang-ups or
attitudes present.  Man, what a goddamn good time.

I hope that Sharon went well for all of you who went.  


Keep the peace.

Yeah, I disagree -- I thought it was really really really really good. And
it was still kicking pretty hard even at 8AM... AND "only" $15.00 ... (such
a bahgain!)

I too really got into the "heat" experience this time. Unlike Wicked, which
was overwhelmingly hot and stuffy, there was air at this party -- people
working the party would open the side doors for long enough to let some air
in without losing the heat of the moment. Yeah... it somehow becomes easier
to dance and stay awake when you can be oxygenated.

(Here's a scene I'd like to have seen at Wicked:
 "hey duuuude, try some of this... psssshhhshshsht (baloon fills)... it's
  the new thang you know -- oxygen... try it.. it's like, you know, like
  totally a trip, maaaan")

I also liked the fact that this was pretty small (1000?) for a big rave.
There were a lot of people, but not overwhelmingly so (unlike the last
gathering).

And the sound was good too, aided by the relatively low ceiling, a decent
speaker set-up, and enough nonreflective surfaces & people to keep the
reverberations down.. As usual, Josh/Jeno/Garth did a fine job...

FYI, they played the (1) ultraviolet catastrophe single again, (2) that
song with the "i'm so high" lady and star-trek transporter samples, (3) the
song with the Chaka Khan and Rufus "You Got the Love" guitar sample, and
(4) the swamp-boogie-hoe-down harmonica song (at least twice), etc.

I didn't see a whole lot of sfravers (that i knew) other than Jon D, Mike W
and their friends and band-mates.

PS: zanzibar (SF) w/ josh spinning was pretty fun on Friday from 11-2.
Does Josh always spin there on Fridays?

	I dunno.  Maybe I'm a little utopian, but part of the "rave philosophy"
in my book is to try and reach out to people.  Not to say that I have to
co-opt myself to their way of acting, but that trying to shield others
from taking part in what gives me so much strikes me as a tad, er, for
lack of a gentler phrase, hypocritical.  I mean, I agree about keeping
announcements of raves OFF the radio would be a Good Thing (tm), but only
because if lots of people attend these the odds of it getting broken up 
greatly increase.  

	I wouldn't use the reason that the majority of the listeners
out in radio-land who would be listening are people who I _wouldn't_
want at a rave.

	Now I know that sentence is a grammatical nightmare, but think
about it.  We cannot isolate ourselves from society simply because we
don't trust them to "get it".  I mean, I didn't "get it" until my first
FMR - but I wouldn't put it beyond the reach of anyone.  The recent
discussion about Ravestock vs. Altamont only clarifies this - we must
start incorporating others into who we are and what we are doing if we
want to ensure the health of the scene and make sure we don't follow in
the footsteps of so many other failed "movements".

	I think we can do this without compromising who _we_ are.  

	I mean, if the scene is going to be about running from the cops,
then we'll die.  No doubt about it.  If our scene is all about taking
drugs, then we'll die.  Again, no doubt about it.  

	If our scene is about opening our hearts, about recognizing our
fragile existence on this earth, about realizing that we are a single
race of humans rather than a gaggle of separate identities, and if we are
able to communicate that effectively to the public, then we won't die.
I don't mean we have to proselytize the world into becoming super-eco-aware,
we don't have to clamp down and make sure everyone's "politically correct".
I'm talking about a fundamental shift in the way people think and interact
with others.  It happened to me.  I'm sure it's happened to many if not 
most of the people here.  And it happens to people when they go to a full
moon rave or another equally good event.  The incident at the full moon
rave with the burn victim is an example of this.  

	Whoa, I just got glassy-eyed there for a second.  Excuse me.

	Okay, back to earth.  Phew.  

	How possible do you think it would be to use this radio slot to
help educate the public about what raves REALLY are, what they REALLY 
mean to us?  I mean, Techno Attack (my old radio show, actually I just
helped out, it was Billy Jam's show) started out like that but then it
degenerated into "Lets-see-how-many-passes-we-can-give-out-to-ToonTown"
et al.  I mean, I would talk to Billy about how wonderful such-and-such
rave was because it was the crowd who made it great, and I could just
see him getting lost on the concept.  *sigh*.  We have to think of ways
to present our ideas without being dismissed as neo-hippies wacked out
on "peace pills" with no concept of the driving forces of modern society.
How can we do this?

  Where is this written?  I have to dissagree here, because MY views were
changed radically when I was first clued in to what raves were really about.
I have to qualify this with my background though.  I was fortunate enough to 
have agnostic parents who believed that openess to ideas was the top-priority
for civilized (whatever that means) existance.  They taught me about 
agnosticism, shino-ism, buddism, judism, catholacism, atheism, etc..., and
let me choose.  (needless to say, I chose agnosticism).  Where is this
going?, I don't know, but I just think the human race deserves a little more
credit than was given here.

Is this really the case, though?  I`ve been wondering lately.  
Baggy clothes, etc. are definetly most prominent in the hip-hop
scene, which doesn't always mean originated from, although in this
case probably did.  I've seen this style in the skate scene for
quite some time now, probably almost as long ago as the hip-hop 
scene, but not as apparent because I don't see as many skaters as
hip-hoppers and I'm also wondering if this style, and to what 
extent, is/was at European raves.  These things are often hard to
trace but I'm wondering if this is parallel style evolution or
who copied who and about when.  What about floppy hats and other
rave styles?  Did these come with raves from Europe or are some
of these U.S./West coast/San Francisco contributions?  I can't
remember his/your name but I'm interested in hearing about past
and current rave dress style from our English list-member.

Well, I'm not the fashion god, but I thing the saggin' look originated in
either Chicago, or New York.  It's influences are primarily American in origin.
As for European fashion, I once had the luck to talk to the next door neighbor
of Liam Howlett (this is a funny story...  We met at a pre-press place I
used to work at, which had nothing to do with raves at all.  Well, he had his
walkman with him, and he was playing this band called "Orbital" (this was
about 2.5 years ago).  Well, I kept saying "you mean the Orb right?", and
he kept saying, in his wonderfull cokney (sp?) accent "No friend, this is
OOOOOrbital")...  Anyway, we got onto the subject of fashion (I also wondered
where the floppy hats came from), and he said the dominate fashion in London,
and France were the jeans w/ wide black belt, white t-shirt, and a black
baseball cap.  The floppy revolution was just starting in Europe according to
him.  I guess this means floppy rave fashion is a U.S. native.

Oh, don't be such a nit.

I wasn't expecting this rave to be very good at all, but I ended up having
a pretty good time.  I thought the music was good but not mindblowing --
Spun was kind of weak, but Josh and Jeno did pretty energetic sets.  I wasn't
all that impressed with the space itself (I find werehouses a tad boring),
and the sound system reached new heights in thuddy mediocrity, but I found
the crowd to be extremely friendly and full of energy.  And I saw quite a 
few people that I hadn't seen in a while.

Well, as geoffw has said, we went to Sharon this weekend.  Why?  We wanted
to go to Half Moon Bay [which rewarded us by being incredibly beautiful] and
not Milpitas.  We knew for sure that Sharon would be outdoors, had heard
Destiny would but it didn't say on the recording and we didn't want to risk
another damn warehouse party.  We were an intrepid party of seven, with two
first time ravers along.  We took a tent [thanks, Chauncey!] and camped.  Also, this party was advertised as "Hard Core II" and I'd like to point out that we
were the last ravers to leave.  Heh, heh.  Here is our review.


cost           - $20

# of bathrooms - 0 [at least it was outside.  I'll go out on a limb and say I'd
		 rather have the free water than porta-sans at an outdoor rave
		 since the porta-sans get so disgusting anyway and free water
		 is an excellent thing.  BOTH would be too much to ask I guess

location       - outdoors, beautiful, Half Moon Bay

water	       - FREE!  they had an Alhambra dispenser and plenty of bottles

cops           - no cops _in_ the rave.  cops showed up outside and prevented
                 cars from entering after a point, but people hiked in

duration       - we left at about 9am, and the DJ was still spinning

chill area     - there was a very steep hill you could climb with an 
                 unbelievable view of the countryside and the pacific. 
                 no music [other than the main dance floor]

sound          - all right.  the speakers could have been bigger, and 
                 some moron kept kicking out some cord, but no real problems

DJs            - all good except for the ragga DJ who was disappointing.  the 
                 last DJ was _really_ good, wish we knew his name.  he was
                 seen skating on the half-pipe before he went on 

extras         - no fire-eaters, belly dancers, or big tent.  there was a
                 half-pipe set up with skaters on it all night long.  anyone
                 who brought a board could skate.  there was also a ride called
                 the gravitron which was kind of like a human gyroscope.  you
		 got in and you were inside a ring w/in 2 other rings, all 
		 attached so that you could rotate in any direction.  this
		 looked scary but fun.  some people didn't want to get out and
		 were whipping around in time with the techno.  we were too
		 chickenshit to try.

vending		- t-shirts, suckers, espresso, smart drinks, necklaces  

vibe		- fun, especially after the drinking crowd tired out and left
		  [isn't it always so].  more skaters and hip-hoppers than is
		  usual on the Jeno/Garth circuit.  It was cool to party with
		  a different crowd, and make links between two circles of the
		  rave community.

Maybe it's just my imagination, but Frankie Bones, Joey Beltram, people
like that, who have been in the "business" for a long time, enjoy
spreading (using?) their pull and ego as thin as possible.

Around here, the nickname for frankie bones is "frankie "EGO" bones"

I enjoy what he spins, I've got nothing against him, but some people
here feel he's pushing it too far.

Joey Beltram on the other hand , is just a genius when it comes to remixing and mixing.. 
But even stil, he's been swallowed by the corporate world, and now remixes
for elektra records and artista...

I waited a little while to comment on the techno radio show until
I got an idea of where the conversation was going, so I wll now 
put in my 2 cents (nonsense?)...

anyway, I think that having a techno show is fine and dandy, but I am 
somehow against announcing raves, big or small.  I would rather have
radio listeners call in and ask what was going on than have it announced
all over...something just irks me these days about seeing fliers in Tower
Records and tix given out from KMEL and such...I can't wait tillall that
stuff is over.

About the ravestock:
I thought I read (in TIME, of all the godforsaken sources) that someone was
planning a week-long rave reminscent of the 60s festival..somewhere on
the east coast.

Now, I don't know.  I love 'em small, but it would be neat to have large
screens hooked up via satellite to our sisters and brothers all over
the country and the world.  having 30,000 ravers would be intense, but,
shit, that's a helluva lot of people, and the problems would seem (to me)
incredible, organizing, secturity, booths, all the stuff...wowch.

So I love the scene right now the way it is.  A big rave probably wouldn't
 draw a lot of people...I mean, who went to that obnoxious MAJESTY or
the Promised Land?  I mean, those were large productions....with way toom
many thigns that would go wrong...I went to Basics instead, I think...
or something smaller..

Like the Caspar rave...that looks just too big..something like 18
Deejays...shit.  What's the POINT?  I mean, I went through my toontown phase
and quickly dropped it.  

Ravestock, I think, sounds cool, but could be very disappointing.

And I don't know if I want the entire country to feel the repurcussions
of it all right now...we have a good message and a cool spirit and a wonderful
sense of community, but I am not sure if it would come out the way we 
wanted it to, especially with MTV around...

Oh, I watched the opening title to a show called "RAVE" on A&E on Sunday...
it is a hip music show, supposedly.  Funny how many poeple/dancers on the
opening sequence were "Ravish"...ever watch that club EMPTV (MTV)? 
scary.

Okay, so I've heard about Caspar but have yet to see the flier.  Can
someone send me the vital stats so as to make the rave calendar complete?
I _know_ it'lll be overblown, but I still want to know who's "slated"
to appear.  And any other rave fliers you may have picked up this weekend..
even just a phone # would be k-e-w-l.

Subject: Shamanarchy in the U.K

O.K. Brothers & Sisters,
	Here is something I picked up in Ameba.
Rave On.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


		Shamanarchy in the U.K.
		   evolution^ & Friends

If you think Britain gave House to the planet and then got "clubbed
to death" by sharp managers, shallow DJs and uptight authorities

		   YOUR WRONG!!!

	That only drove the Rave Spirit UNDERGROUND where it was radicalized,
politicalized and has been growing ever since in thousands of squats,
festy/rave free parties and clubs.  It's bigger and more alive today and is hatching a peoplepower Movement that  will _Shake the World!_


	Across a re-emerging pagan Britian, underground anarchist armies
	   regularly deliver illegal dance music to the people against all odds

	Unpaid guerilla-rave networks of mad jhad dance fanatics and sound
terrorist activate ituitively intricate strategies by fone fax'n foot to
outwit the lawbreaking efforts of government agencies spending millions of
taxpayers money to stamp out unlicensed dancing and get everybody back into the
pubs before the anarchic spirit of dancing with fellow beings under open
skies in tangy pagan groves sends them barefoot mad and unemployable -
as well as unemployed and living in cardboard boxes as many of them already are.
	When we start asking why they do it, we come face to face with deeper questions like: Can anyone 'own' land, especially 'common land'?
What the Hell has become of the noble Albion dream of a golden flowering of civilization which still lurks in each of our hearts?
What went wrong?  Is it changing fast enough?  And what more can I do?

	As the depression in the dominator system deepens into final collapse
	the cooperative free festy/rave/squatter/new new age/techno tribal
	traveller crossover counterculture will become dominant

	Since the '80s Hippies the underground have been saying that the only hope for the dog-eat-dog Western culture before it destroyed itself and the planet was an invention that would enable every single individual in it, one by one, to escape the materialist made dream in their heads by getting back in touch with their hearts and bodies.
	In the '90s every High Street in the land of Britain boasts exactly such a facility, a club retailing SHAMANIC TRIBAL DANCING SIX NIGHTS A WEEK
to large groups of the youth of Western culture.  A whole generation is
getting out of its collective fucking head... and back into its body!
	That's Step One.  But then you have to realize that "You can't
have a perfect club in an imperfect society:  You have to change society."
And thats when the wild shamanic energy of Rave gets radicalized by meeting
Hippy/Punk and comes of age just in time to transform the culture.  No current cultural phenomenon but the scene has the mass eyes-open energy to spread this
consciousness craze globally among the youth before the planet is destroyed!
	And now such shamanic workshops are mushrooming across the planet!
	As the recession deepens throughout the decade, the cooperative free
festy/rave/squatter/new new age/techno traveller tribal crossover counterculture scenes are the real green shoots in the Communal Economy  which
will grow unstoppably into the new dominant goddess-worshipping techno-tipi dwelling eco-culture that will inherit a clensed planet.


	The System is disintegrating everywhere you look.
		Right On!  Up the Evolution!

	The Old Age Control System abandons more physical & psychic territory to the spirit of SHAMANARCHY every day.  The Centre is a lifethreat to itself as much as to everything else and cannot hold.

Supply us with the technology and the facilities and sweep the streets - we can handle the rest!

	The Music Biz corrupted Rock n' Roll into MILLIONAIREBELS in thousand dollar rags & perms _playing revolutionaries for teenage pubescents_  Punk turned out to be mostly just the second childhood death throes of Rock'nRoll
after all.  But the best stayed true and were still on the road when House came along.
	House is different, we all feel that.  This time we won't be fooled - we don't have time!  If Rock'nRoll was the rebellious trumpet that blew down the walls and left the New City of Albion open to us, the people, House is the background music in our headphones, synthesizing the triumphantly shining shamanarchic new new rave culture as peoplepower re-enters to inherit and assume command.

There's a club here that does this.  They have a dentist's chair and someone
dispensing oxygen from a tank for bux.  Supposedly just gives you a head rush.

You have a very good point about our message not coming out the way we want
it to - it is so easy for the press to twist things to fit their agenda,
especially the "latest bizarre craze from California"  I think it is
impossible to plan an event like Woodstock - it just has to happen.  WS
itself was supposed to be a much smaller event, but it just took off.  I
think we need to first work on our community here, get real strong an dtight
and then worry about taking it on the road.  We need to connect with the
ravers in other place who are thinking about community.  [The last Urb has
some real positive stuff - the one with "Vote" on the cover]  We can't avoid
the media, but why encourage it until we are ready.

I think that -M has a great point here. I don't think that we'll be able to
plan for the rave sequel to Weedstock; it will happen when it's ready to
happen.  Something like an FMR that just explodes on its own into a mass
gathering of unity and love.  All the more reason that we must learn to care
for each other when raving (and at other times) so that we will be prepared
for the inevitable.  Just my two cents here.

Don't forget to VOTE on November 3d!!

Subject: Woodstock and what it was

not that i was around woodstock, nor have i really
done any real research about it, BUT...

my impression is, Woodstock was supposed to be a concert
just like a bunch of other concerts that were going
around, kinda like the lollapalooza's of today
with a bunch of big name acts performing
Woodstock was so special because of a couple things
the biggest of those was media coverage
for all we know, this could have happened 
every weekend and the news media just ignored it
(not likely.. but maybe everyone was just to drunk
and stoned to remember)

the second thing that made woodstock so special
was that it wasnt planned (or if it was, they did
a good job of covering it up)
woodstock was a normal concert, with tickets and everything
suppose to raise money for the farm
the big problem happened when there was no
real security to keep out people or at least keep them from ripping down 
the fence...

if you want the difference between woodstock and altamont
look at how each was planned...
one was planned, and the other just happened

(woodstock was planned as far as the bands go, 
but what happened wasnt)

basically all that i am saying is that you cant plan
a ravestock or it wont be one
you cant call it a ravestock, cuz then the lousy
name will stick and it will seem planned

if everyone's energy is flowing in the same direction
then something like this could happen
but it has to _happen_
ya know?

(not leaving a name cuz i think i have a somewhat distinguishable
writing style, so that its possible to tell who wrote it
i mean besides looking at the header)

with the dj's mixxing it nicely between harder stuff at 3, 4 and mellower
things towards the morn.
then, yesterday i went to hear/see/reprogramm my brain with tl and ptv.
genesis had announced that they'd doing the sound here last week and
hyperdelic vidoe did the visuals - i think they do some/many of the ptv
shows as well. tl did his speech/reprogramming thang with alaura and gen
doing the music, and these really interesting collages projected on a screen
behind  leary. he talked about himself a bit - BIG surprise :) - about how
techonlogy will help us take more control of our own lives and to think
for ourselves - 'but what should we think, master ?' asks the crowd. well,
after about 1 1/2 hours there was a 'dialogue' period, most of it interesting,

..gimme a break man..what's with you attitude?..the show has nothing to do with
rave per se..it has to do with various aspects of the cutting edge of popular
culture..so we may well see an episode on raves..but last week's was called
"Shamrock and roll" and was about Irish rock (U2, Sinead, etc.)..just b/c the
opening sequence has some dancers using current dance moves u call it
"ravish"??? Methinks u are developing an attitude that everyone everywhere is

***STAY TUNED FOR CLINCHER AT THE BOTTOM***


	Okay, I'm jonesing to meet people again... and there have been a lot
of new people on the list (we're holding steady at around 255 right now) so
I'm opening my apartment to everyone on Friday, from 11:30am until 2pm or
so.  The party can move outside if it gets too big.  Here's your chance to
meet other SFRavers (so you don't have to ask everyone at every rave you go 
to that oh-so-embarrassing question, "Do you have e-mail?" ;)  I can't afford
to feed everyone, but I will provide sodas and OJ.  And some basic visuals...
as well as music, of course.  ;)  Bring rave tapes if you have them, or even
12"'s if you feel like mixing (I have turntables).   Oh yeah, directions!

(Those of you who live in Berkeley should be able to tell from these directions
where I am)

Take the 24 west from the 580 freeway (consult one of the Thomas Bros if this
is unclear) and exit at Claremont.  Make a left, and make another left at
College after a mile or so.  Stay on College for another mile, until you
hit Dwight, where you take a right.  Make another right at Warring.  On the
left you will see Clark Kerr.  About 50 yards after the first stop sign is
a driveway on the left - go into the driveway and up to the back end of the
parking lot.  Walk up between the two L-shaped buildings, and you will be
facing my building, building 17.  I am on the left hand side of 17, suite
103.  

The parking lot there is officially only for people with permits, but they
usually don't check around lunchtime.  If you want to play it safe, you can
park on the side streets for 2 hours, or when you arrive I can direct you
to the "secret" parking lot where I keep my car.  ;)

I can handle a large amount in my apartment, and if it gets bigger, there
are two big grassy areas just outside my place we can move speakers and
stuff to.  No problemo.

*************************************************************************

Oh yeah, here's the clincher.  I managed to borrow a button making machine
(MANY thanks to arthur chandler, arthurc@sfsuvax1.sfsu.edu) so you will
have the opportunity not only to make your buttons in person, but also
customize them (can someone bring maybe paints and/or markers and/or
glitter, etc?)  I will have a bunch of both the first and second designs
printed up.  I have enough backings to make about 75, and hopefully
before I return the machine will be able to make more...


I'd like to see as many people as possible from Berkeley show up, (classes?
We don't need no steenkin classes) seeing as I have met less than half
of you.  If anyone wants to bring any cool "trip toy" they're welcome to.

See you all there!

Would this perhaps be "fraser clarke" -- the guy that did "War N'
Peace" by Fraser Clarke 'v' the Irresistible Force on Give Peace a
Dance Volume 1? 

Sounds like the kind of stuff he says... what with the lyrics to that
song mentioning stuff like "we mutant dancing planet lovers, being of
sound mind and sexy body say -- yes to planet, no to war, we're
turning on to who we are... cold war's over, putting the old warriors
out to clover ... new generation is taking over... as we grab the
power, an age of peace is ours"....  "that's why we mutant dancing
goddess-worshiping techno-pagan mind-expanded heart-open evolutionary
planet lovers being of sound mind and sexy body say you're right, the
time is right to join the fight for the earth..." (etc etc etc). 

Yeah, I know this song too well because i've been (trying) to add a
mambo rhythm loop to it.  (Just for the hell of it... I'm playing with
my new Emu Emulator IIIxp sampler...)

Yes, I know it's amazing -- preachy but meaningful lyrics in a rave
song.  Next thing you know, it'll be Crosby Stills Nash & Young all
over again (not!). Ok everybody sing along... "teach your children
well so they can become...  young republicans and stockbrokers..."

Did they ever rebroadcast the show on disco featuring members of
Dee-Lite (including Lady Kier), Baby Ford, various rave DJs and hosted
by the ever-talented, witty and beautiful and gorgeous and wonderful
Anne Magnuson of the band Bongwater... 

This was discussed a while back on this list. The problem was that the
sound went out after 15 minutes, so I only got to videotape the
pictures. 

I believe they did go into rave, house and hip-hop culture in that
show -- showing the offshoots of disco culture; in general, however,
RAVE isn't a show about raves.

Subject: my trip to Sharon


[warning: this post is long]
TAX here 

Since there was no in-depth review of Sharon, I guess I'll post.  But just to 
see what my point of view is, I tell u that I promised myself about three 
Sharons ago that that was my last Sharon.  I again promised myself that 
at this Sharon even though I didn't pay.

The night started when a raving friend, Andreas was visiting me from Bezerkley
and he wanted to go out.  I was tired from Wicked on Friday night plus 
taking a short "journey" on Saturday eve.  I was thinking Destiny would be 
better cause I've got something against Sharons, but I decided to drive him 
to Sharon and drop him off and then head home and collapse (half hour drive 
each way).  Anyway, we got sidetracked by an enjoyable party that some friends 
were having (they spootted us from the roof) as we were heading to the car.  
45 min later, we finally get going, and half hour later, we've almost reached 
the Sharon location and it's about 2am when we see A LOT of cars heading the 
wrong way.  Uh oh, I think, it's been busted.  Well, I drove to the location 
anyway but just by chance I drove up the wrong road.  (It turns out the cops
were turning people away at correct road that led up to the ranch, saying that
they busted the party but they were lying.  I guess Haleem must have had all 
the permits cause they didn't bust the party itself.  Have you noticed how the
cops can still disrupt a rave by 'busting' the entrance to the rave even if 
they can't bust the rave itself?)

So here we were on the wrong road which has no cops on it.  A tow truck whizzes
by at around 2:30am so we suspected they are towing even on this road.  I hid 
my car in a safe spot and we went off wandering.  We knew that we were close 
cause we could see the lazers bouncing off the low lying clouds which was a 
fantastic sight and we could hear a faint bass beat.  Then a cop car pulls up
with this young raver girl sitting beside the cop driver telling us 
that the party is over, that we should just go home.  We look at eachother 
with puzzled looks.  We then hopped down a steep ravine beside this dirt 
road so the cop wouldn't see us when he turned around.  We couldn't believe 
what this raver girl was doing.  Who was she working for?  Well we worked our 
way down this ravine in pitch darkness and there were steep 5 ft. drops at 
times and it was starting to get real gnarly.  We just kept going down, down,
for about 45 min to where the dirt walls were towering on either side of us
up about 30-40 feet.  We finally decided we didn't want to go any further 
because there could be poison oak all around us for all we knew.  We only had
8 matches total to light our way which we used only when we lowered ourselves 
some more and our feet didn't touch any ground and we were down to 3 matches. 
(Turns out I did come in contact with some poison oak)

We climbed back up to the dirt road and wrote off that incredible effort.  So
an hour later, we were exactly where we started.  We decided this time to walk
down a dirt road.  As we walked past a ranch, a man comes our way with a 
flashlight and tells us to get off his land.  He gets into a large pickup truck
and says he's gonna block off access to his ranch (which is not the rave ranch)
by parking it on this wooden bridge.  So he directs us to go the same road we
just walked up but he's driving behind us at about 2 miles an hour with his 
large pickup truck with his high beams on.  About half way, I turned around and
walked up to his truck so I could ask him if he could give us a lift, but 
before I reached his truck, he dashes out of it and runs to the back of the 
truck and opens the back.  I'm sensing that this man is acting really,
really strange/paranoid so we decide to leave him alone.  We arrived back to 
where we were about 20 min ago when we ran into a group of 5 young ravers from
Half Moon Bay.  After enumerating all our options, we all decided to sneak by 
the rancher's truck and walk down a dirt road.  We managed to get by his truck,
we didn't know where the rancher was at this point, but we didn't care.  The 
boundaries of different ranches along this dirt road were marked off by fences 
so when got past the fence to the next ranch we all let out a sigh of relief.

Then we saw these car headlights in the distance, like about 200yards away but 
we could also see the rave by now.  I must say the setup for this Sharon was
incredible.  Lights, projections, lazers, and other stands we could discern
from our distance.  Then the stationary headlights starting moving in our 
direction very slowly.  We kept walking down this dirt road but about 2 minutes
later, we all realized at the same time that the headlights belonged to a cop
car who was slowly moving our way.  He could definitely see our figures moving
in the distance where his headlights were shining.  So we all jumped into the
shallow ditch beside the road and hugged the bottom.  No one made a noise and
my heart was pounding as I'm sure the others' were too.  The cop car turned on 
his bright spotlight and slowly passed us with his spotlight but he missed us.
Then he realized he went too far so he backed up still with his spotlight on 
and then he went back and forth again but he didn't see us.  Once we realized 
that he gave up looking for us and drove back down, we ran out of the ditch
like wild animals into the neighboring grassland.

We finally got to Sharon which was a great disappointment for the amount of 
effort put into getting there.  The music was great, the setup was great, with
little stands.  It was outdoors, the lazers were very interesting against the
clouds, the human gyroscope was there.  I estimated there to be about 600 
people and Andreas estimated 1000.  My problem with this crowd was that there
was no energy in it.  The people who were dancing were not energized at all.
Those who were not dancing were not open or friendly either.  Someone's got to
tell them about the rave mentality, about letting go of your guard.  But then
I wasn't really surprised because the other Sharons I've promised myself I 
wouldn't go to but ended up going to anyway (when it wasn't busted before it 
started) were a lot like this too.  I personally suspect that someone must have
something against Haleem and is going thru trouble to get his raves busted.

We left after about 40min and called it a night.  More adventures of about the
same intensity were going to be experienced the next day but that's another
story for another time.

I don't feel it is necessary to pounce on someone who is expressing himself
on this board.  This will only stifle those on this board who may be
reluctant to post if there are potential hostilities,  I am discouraged
to see someone label with attitude here.  Remember it is those outside
this small community that are eager to stamp down and choke this

in our approach, it is the *idea* not the person that we find disagreement

obviously misinterpreted my post...I was merely following up on various

_realize_ the show was about Irish rock bands and popular culture, and
I thought it was itner
interesting that they would call the show "rave."  I then noted it was 
notable that the opening sequences had a lot ofpeople dancng in
Girbaud jeans (not uncommon at all dance places, ioncluding raves)
and merely noted that....I wasn't aware that I had a particular attitude
about anything in particular, except maybe to people with bad attitudes...

My friend Mike Matel is the person who painted this.  He has always
been a Struggling Artist, and lately has been struggling to
a great extent.  I have seen his other work, and some of it
is unbelievable.  His latest stuff is very much in the spirit of
raves; he is definitely one who thinks and acts on the best parts of
this scene.

I was so sad to discover that he recently sold one of his better
canvasses (often large - this one was maybe 3ft by 4ft) for less than
he should have just so he could feed himself....

Anyways, sob stories behind, he is doing some other work --
murals and paintings, some at raves; if you have any contacts for him or
I'm sure if you were interested in seeing some of his other artwork
he would love to show them off, call him (Mike Matel) at 510-689-5697
and tell him I referred you.

Subject: Commercialism at its worst

It finanally happened.  After almost a year of being the only game in town
someone else decided to throw a rave.  Coincidentally, one of the people
involved was the same person who we rented a space from for our first rave
in February.  So I looked forward to this one with a bit of anxiety and
trepidation, wondering how they would try bend the scene into their own
blatant commercialism.  Their flyer was rather sucky in comparison.  Eleven
different font styles and every cliche in the book.  The wording of the lines
seemed strangely familiar "40,000 Watts of Turbo Generated Space Bass",
"Journey Beyond The Ultrabeat" and a few other lines that were scratching my
memory.  One day I was looking at my flyer collection on the wall and I saw
why it was so familiar.  The "Outlands" rave flyer, which John and I had
traveled to Colorado for, was their obvious source.  They had copied their
lines WORD for WORD.  So much for originality.

I arrived at the Fairgrounds a few minutes after they opened to a mostly empty
hall.  They had an enormous sound system, about eight times bigger than what
we normally use.  In that empty hall, it just echoed and sounded terrible.
The lights were constant, no shifting to the beat, just going on full tilt all
night long.  I had a brought a stack of flyers for "Taste" with the phone
number, as well as an advertisement for a radio show I'd be doing in a couple
of weeks.  I was handing them out to the few people in there when a 250 lb man
in the ugliest warm-up suit I'd ever seen came up to me.  I'd just met the
promoter.  I told him who I was and he hadn't even heard of us, which in fact
was a complement, for I've always insisted on being the underground, not just
labeling ourselves as such.  He kind of laughed when I told him that I'd been
doing raves here since February, "Hit and miss?" he commented.  "No, hit and
hit, I'm afraid."  He then mentioned how he hoped a lot of people would show
up, after all the hall's capacity was 1000.  Then he disappeared.

The first DJ was the same person who I had rented our first place from.  Back
in February, we had a good discussion about house and techno, me being
surprised at his knowledge of it.  He mentioned he was in a record pool.  I'd
never heard him DJ until this night.  It seemed that his record pool was
rather terrible.  "Who shot JFK", "Free Your Body", all the Quadraphonia
tripe, "Sesame's Treat", and yes, of course, "James Brown is Dead" were
played, not once, but usually twice for emphasis.  The only thing I heard him
spin that I remotely enjoyed was Two Blind Mice's "Bomb Scare", it was
remarkable that he even had it.  He ended his set with Nine Inch Nails' "Down
In It".  There was no mixing to be found.  Several times he left the audience
just standing there, waiting for the track to fade out or in.  Yeeeeeuuck.

I began to think that the second DJ was a savior.  Fairly competant mixing
when he started off with some great trance.  Then I noticed that he had been
fiddling with the CD player the whole time while a turntable spun.  It was a
mix disc.  Then he kicked in with the usual, "Sesame's Treat", "Everybody's
Free", etc. etc. etc.  Another yawner was underway.  I didn't stay much
longer.

The promoter had been running around all night, making sure that nobody had
snuck anything in.  I saw him take a beer can from a friend.  The concessions
were the standard fairground staff.  $1 candy bars, $2 cokes.  Each door had a
security guard.  This was above-ground as you could get.  Really sickening
atmosphere, with very few of the hardcore.  One of them laughed to me as he
labeled it, "Highschool Rave".  It really wasn't much better than any of the
dances I had gone to back then.  After leaving, I just hoped I could put
everything in the back of my head, thinking that they had lost enough money on
this one never to attempt another farce.

Then last night (Tuesday) he called.  The promoter was very interested in what
I had to say about his "rave".  He had given me his card after I had left with
the statement, "Let's keep in touch so we don't conflict with each other's
dates!"  His card was for a DJ service, "Weddings, Birthdays, Parties", then
with a list of things he played "30's - 90's, Hip Hop, Soul."  Another
hardcore raver told me that he had gone to a wedding where this guy had DJ'd.
They had brought him some techno CDs and he REFUSED to play them.  Apparently
his mind had changed in the past few months when he realized what a "cash cow"
was to be had.  I was polite to him over the phone, even though most of the
time I felt like telling him to fuck off.  He mentioned that he had been in
contact with "rave promoters in New York" then he mentioned the fact that they
had thrown a rave for "5000 people", it was obvious that he was talking about
Storm.  THEN HE MENTIONED ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY COULD BE MADE FROM A SHOW OF
THAT SIZE.  Good God I was getting angry.  Yet for some reason, I find it
really hard to be rude to strangers, no matter how insulting they are.  I kept
a lid on it.  Yet I told him that I had lost more money than I had made on
raves, because the money wasn't important to me.  I wasn't doing it to get
rich.  I was doing it because I enjoyed the scene and people appreciated my
efforts.  Understandably, he had a hard time fathoming it.

He asked me if there was anything I didn't like about his "rave".  I said that
the sound system was nice and big, but terrible for that size of hall.  He
explained that if there has been a larger crowd (about 200 people showed up)
then it wouldn't have been a problem.  He said that they had printed up 3000
flyers for this and the next one would have 10,000, so obviously "more people
would show up."  Our standard amount of flyers is 200, the majority of them
going to the mailing list.  I told him that the music was rather mainstream,
old, and didn't do anything for me.  It was then that he told me that the guys
in New York shops were going to be sending him lots of music to play.  All of
the latest techno from GERMANY.  It was apparent that this guy didn't have a
clue.  Then he invited me to DJ for him.  I took great pleasure in telling him
that his dances were too mainstream and I'd rather not.  Once again he
emphasized that we should keep in touch so we didn't conflict with each other.
Then he told me the date of their next "rave", the 21st of November, same
stinking location.

Suddenly I knew when our next rave was going to happen.

Subject: Have I got a deal for you!

While piddling around the pad late last Friday night I was listening to
KMEL (so shoot me) and they were giving away Eon's new LP. I almost never
call in but I figured what the hey, it's 2:00 am, and I know the answer to
the question. So of course, I get through and win blah, de blah.

But now I'm also on the guest list (+1) for Jack's House this Friday the 23rd.

This is a bit of a poser, since I have no transportation.

So if anybody in the East Bay would like to give a rave lurker a ride to
and from this rave in exchange for free admit send me some e-mail.

So now you're thinking, this has got to be a terrible rave. It was pubbed
on KMEL no less. Well, I called the info line they gave me and the claim is
that The Hardkisses, Spun, and LA's John Williams will be doing the honors
with Eon to make an appearance.

So now you're thinking, jeez this Crossjam guy must be a hoser. He was
stuck at home last Friday for chrissakes. I'll probably have to leave the
jam at 1 am or something.

I'm perfectly willing to stay as long as you like (I'm talking 6 am is no
problem, noon the next day I'd have to think about) and if I don't outdance
you I'll give you your money back.

And to top it all off, you get to meet me!!

So if this deal seems appealing, drop me some e-mail. I'm not an sfraves
subscriber so *don't* respond to the list. If I have multiple offers, I'll
probably give priority to proximity to Berkeley or something like that.

No smilies for the humor impaired.

"Assassin" is a homonym with "hashishin", one who smokes hash or ganja. It's
a kind of slang used in Morocco and environs. But the meaning seems to go
beyond what we might call "stoner" or "drug-user" to imply membership in a
sort of spiritual brotherhood.

Brion Gysin's novel "The Process" contains writings about this Brotherhood
of Assassins. Powerful words about transcendence through music, dance, and
drugs. And cultural dislocation. And Present Time/hello, yes hello. In part
fiction/ part autobiography/ but the act of writing the fiction changes the
biography, you see?

I'm certain that the Orb are floating along on this particular stream of
ideas; "Assassin" contains samples of thee Master Musicians of Joujouka,
trance music of Assassins, of a culture that long ago made what we call Rave 
a part of itself in an enduring way.

If there is a future for Rave in Present Time, it is in such a way, toward
a spiritual siblinghood (can anyone think of a better word?) which can weather
any cultural changes, and hopefully cause some. A seperate, smaller, more
focused culture which consolidates its energy through ritual. And thus has
greater energy to affect change.

I'm branching this off to SFRaves as well cos it seems to relate to 
ongoing discussion there.

9.  Each has their own sense of fashion, but neither is mandatory.
8.  To outsiders, both camps are considered freaks.  Parents keep their

6.  Who says hackers don't use drugs?  Caffeine! Caffeine! Caffeine!
5.  Mom wouldn't approve.  Then again, she might be one too.
4.  It's very possible to LOSE yourself into either one for DAYS on end.
3.  Both activities tend to make people thinner (and less healthy)
2.  Ever been to a hacker convention?  We have a lot to learn!

isn't that "the jack that house built" by farley "jackmaster" funk?
we're borrowing a few "history of house" box sets that total around
20 records.  i'll have a peek through them to see if i can't find the
track in question.  from memory...

in the beginning there was jack, and jack had a groove, and from his
groove came the groove of all grooves.  one day while viciously throwing
down on the spot, jack boldly declared "let there be house" and house
music was born.  i am the seed, i am the creator...

oops, i ran out of steam.  there's more stuff about how this is my house,
but i am not selfish, and this is our house, and our house music, blah blah
blah...

The coolest sticker I saw was a cut-up of the VW "FAHRVERGNUGEN" (sp?)

Subject: Lyrics to Jack's House



hiya.  I'm a new SFRaver (in fact, I'm a new raver period.  I just got into 
raving about two months ago when I moved here fresh from a fairly isolated ski
town in the Rockies of Colorado), so I thought I'd quickly introduce myself
before I get to the point of this letter.  My name (if you didn't get it from
the header) is Leah, but I have a few silly nicknames (which, if you are
actually interested in knowing, you're welcome to ask about).  You may have
seen me in the past few weeks.  I'm the one grooving with the brown hair that
goes past her behind.....

Anyway, let's get to the point.  I read the letters that were sent regarding
the speech about "the House that Jack built."  I just happened to have it on
a tape of my friend mixing, so I listened to it and wrote all (or should I say
most, as I couldn't understand some) of the words down.  If you have any 
additions, changes, corrections, etc. I hope you make them because I (and
obviously a lot of other people) would love to have a complete set of the
words.  Okay, here goes....


"In the beginning, there was Jack, and Jack had a groove.  And from this
groove came the groove of all grooves.  And while one day viciously
throwing down on the spot (his box?), Jack boldy declared, "Let there
be HOUSE!" and house music was born.  I am the seed (you see?), I am 
the creator, and this is my house.  And, in my house there is ONLY house
music.  But, I am not so selfish because once you enter my house it then
becomes OUR house and OUR house music.  And, you see, no one man owns
house because house music is a universal language spoken and understood
by all.  You see, house is a feeling that no one can understand really
unless you're deep into the vibe of house.  House is an uncontrolable
desire to jack you body.  And, as I told you before, this is our house
and our house music.  And in every house, you understand, there's the 
people.  And, in this house, the people is Jack (?).  There's some of
you who might wonder who is Jack and what is it that Jack does.  Jack
is the one who gives you the power to jack your body.  Jack is the one
who gives you the power to lose state (?).  Jack is the one who gives
you the key to the wiggly worm.  Jack is the one who learns you how to 
walk your body.  Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all 
Jacks together to one house.  You may be black, you may be white, you may
be Jew or Gentile.  Don't make a difference in OUR House.  And this is
______ (fresh, house, what?!?!?)."

Tah-daah.  Well, there you go.  And, for everyone who's going to lunch on
Friday, I'll see you there.......

Good god, do you fools realize what you are talking about!! This is the one
and only 'Can U Feel It' by the legendary Fingers.. "Back in the days" they
used to put this track on acapella right at the peak of the night and everyone
would gather in a circle and hold hands high to the stars and groove on the
vibe... Then of course, the beat would get dropped in and the house was
slammin... I know some SF dj's used to do this, even... Anyway, if you ever
see this 12" probably on Trax or another Chicago old school label, grab it -
it is priceless for the acapella alone! The regular version is on the 
'In the key of E' compilation, and probably a few more for that matter..

For you P-Funk fans out there:

Is Jack perhaps a distant cousin of the legendary Mr. Wiggles? If so,
what's the connection? (for the uninitiated: go out and buy yourselves a
copy of Parliament's _Motor-Booty_Affair_ (Casablanca, 1978) and check out
track #1. It's out on CD. While you're there, get _Mothership_Connection_
as well!)

Subject: Consolidated


I saw Consolidated for the first time last night at a 'Rock the Choice'
concert at the Kennel Club in San Francisco... 'Rock the Choice' indicates
a pro-choice movement, btw... I had been wanting to see this band for
a while now because I keep hearing conflicting reports of their music (of
which I don't own any) and their live shows...

In a nutshell, I was really dissapointed with the show... For those who
are not familiar with Consolidated they are a three member band (drums, 
keyboards and bass, lead vocals guitar and drum pad)... In addition to the
music, on stage they have a number of televison sets upon which are being 
played interesting videos which are supposed to go along with the song...

My complaints:
1) The music gets really tedious... They are good musicians, i.e. they play
a nice tight set and all, but during an hour and a half show, all but about
15 minutes sounded exactly the same... One of the high points was when they
did a really techno edged number and the lead singer imitated the Kraftwerk
robot while playing his drumpad...

2) They are really heavy handed in their attempts at preaching their version
of political correctness, and to me it gets really old, really fast... They 
are anti-guns, anti-meat eating, anti-fascism, anti-military, anti-female abuse...
Now of course I can't and won't argue against alot of this, because I agree
with all but the anti-guns and anti-meat eating, but jesus I wish that they 
would get down off their pedestal...

3) The Yeastie Girlz showed up and did 'You Suck' towards the end of the show
and I was not impressed... Right before they came out, the video screen showed
each of them talking individually about something which obviously bothered them
quite a bit... The first was complaining about how "men" don't like/know how to
deal with tampons, she then proceeded to play 'iron man' by black sabbath on
a tampon applicator... That was interesting... The third one went off on a tirade
about how she is tired of 1) faking orgasms and 2) dealing with men who come and
then roll over and go to sleep... These two points have been gnawing at me for
some time now because I keep hearing the same comments from women all over the
place (not women that I sleep with, btw  8) )... All I can think is 1) why the 
fuck would you bother to fake an orgasm anyway, and 2) have you ever just elbowed
the guy in the ribs and said 'Hey, don't go to sleep, I'm not finished yet' ? If 
you are a woman who is doing 1) and not doing 2) then I fail to have any sympathy
for you...

Good points about the show:
1) The videos were interesting and well put together... Since the band wasn't
all that interesting to watch (i.e. they weren't really doing anything) you 
could always check out the videos and be entertained... My favorite was George
and Barbara applauding interspersed with bombs exploding and tanks firing and
planes shooting, etc...  My next favorite was the one where they slit a cows
throat open and you got to see the blood gush out on to the floor... Neato!

2) Since it was a benefit show, for a good cause (i.e. pro-choice), you could
feel good about wasting the money that you spent...

Well, both Ministry and Test Department have done songs called "New World
Order" that sample Bush in a straightforward way.  (Both are fairly lame,
IMHO.  And I like both bands, too.)

There are two other songs -- "Bushwhack" by Tone Def and "Read My Lips"
by 1000 Points of Light (actually Was Not Was) -- that take Bush samples
and chop the sentences up so that they say new things.  For example, the
sentences:

"The CIA will continue to support the Nicaraguan Freedom Fighters."
"We will not tolerate South American drug trafficking."
"We must fight to protect the civil liberties of the citizens of Kuwait."
"As president, I hope to server the best interests of the American people."

can be rearranged to form:

"The CIA will not tolerate the civil liberities of the American people."

Hear hear. Consolidated is one of the most pathetic bands I've ever seen.
So godamned formulaic -- add 1 cup industrial, melt a teaspoon of
polyunsaturated rap, add some cliche multimedia cutups because it's cool
and artsy, and drown in a stiflingly heavy sauce of PC blather...

I think one of the reasons why I'm beginning to like techno/tribal more and
more is because you don't have to listen to people's stupid lyrics. If I
want meaningful words, I'll read Sylvia Plath, Dylan Thomas, or Lawrence
Ferlinghetti or TS Elliot or... and be done with it.

Meanwhile, Consolidated is not telling me anything I haven't heard a
thousand times before, from more eloquent and erudite sources... On the
lyrical-meaningfulness scale, they rank right up there with "i think I
shall never see a poem as beautiful as a tree" (or however it goes). I
guess if you're an illiterate fool, Consolidated might be a good "Readers
Digest" for left-wing progressive thought... (FYI, I'm leftist myself, but
i'll take my ideology as solid nourishment, not as Gerberized mealy-mouthed
predigested PC spew).

There was a review of their latest album in the SF Guardian a few weeks ago
that summed them up -- wish I had it here to quote it word-for-word because
it is one of the most perfect slag reviews I've read in a long time. (Easy
work, given the source material for review).  Basically, these guys are so
full of white-male self-doubt and guilt for being chromosomally related to
all that is wrong with the world that they come off as whining, pathetic,
pretentious fools.

Their songs certainly don't come from the heart -- there's a sort of
clinical, passive, third person view of what they are saying. They come off
more like politicians spouting rhetoric than artists -- like a left-wing
Joseph Goebbels... For all I know, these guys torture puppies while
masturbating and watching porno videos, then they go on stage to cleanse
themselves of their sins, and the sins of their western dominator bretheren
(how very western/christian of them!). It ranks right up there with monks
bonkin' themselves over the heads with 2x4's while singin' Gregorian
chants.

Obviously a major fucking issue. What're we supposed to do, pretend it's a
tea bag and steep it in hot water? Get all nekkid and besmeared with mud
and whirl them about our heads in a shamanistic earth-godess-mother worship
ritual before tripping the light fantastic and Aardvarking our way to
ecstacy?

It's like that old "men's movement" joke: :-)
	Q: How can you tell if a woman has had an orgasm?
	A: Who cares!

  .......

Well, at least they didn't have an open mike session at the end where a
bunch of co-opy kawlich students whined incredibly inane drivel for hours
on end.  "Even though my mommy bought me a BMW for high school graduation,
i truly feel unity with my opressed sisters throughout the world... and let
me just say that meat and penises are bad bad bad, and men are bad bad
nasty nasty icky and yucky, and there's some kind of consiracy going on
somewhere where they're doing nasty bad horribly pooty icky things."  (this
really happened at the last consolidated show at the Edge in Palo Alto -- i
had to leave because i could taste vomit ready to spew forth.)

PS: for the humor impaired -- sprinkle with :-)'s to taste.

Lighten up, Niels.  Consolidated is always good for a laugh.  They aren't
all that bad live, UNLESS you're expecting some big philosophical revelation.  
Really, no one will hear anything new at a Consolidated show.  They're very
didactic.  So what?  I've always looked at their shows as a sort of liberal
pissed-off aggro-angst slamfest (even though they won't let anyone slam :).
Sure it's stupid. So what.  They've carved out their own little niche in
psuedo-alternative/pc music and it's fun to see them go at it.

They've even got a couple of funny songs. Check out 'Dysfunctional Relationship'Its' one of my faves when I'm getting philosophical.   And who else would
put out an 'Adorno mix' of anything?  

But I think they wear thin in mere minutes.  Gender self-hatred is much
more edifying when acted out instead of ranted.  I got it, 
"Entertainment Through Pain"!  Naw, been done.

I saw them do the 'Yeastie Girls'bit at a Writer's Union spoken-word evening in July devoted to 'Sex'.  It was a bunch
of mostly interesting raps and stories.  It was supposed to be the first of
a monthly series, the next two were to be 'Drugs' and 'Repression' .  

The point of this post:  Anybody know what happend to this performance 
series?  Was the first one a one-off?  Inquiring ears want to know.

Subject: Re: Lyrics to Jack's House

May Jack have mercy on you blasphemers! The song that you are referring to
is old school Chicago House by none other than the legendary Fingers. I
believe that the 12" came out on Trax records, and is virtually priceless
due to the inclusion of the acapella, which used to be played at EVERY house
function.. Ya know the peak of the evening, when you and everyone else are
just as out of your heads as you're going to be, and the DJ throws on that
HYPE break (it used to be Elevations by Expansions or vice versa, now I 
don't know what the peak break is anymore..) anyway, what 'they' used to do
is throw on the acapella of that song, at which point everyone in the house
would stop dancing and gather in a huge circle and hold hands then raise 
the hands to the stars... THEN, the DJ would drop the fattest beat in his/
her crate and the whole circle would just start jumping like mad.. Quite
an amazing feeling - I wish that they still did it - that track is the perfect
anthem for the house generation/vibe. I can't even describe the feeling of
everyone in the house having cut loose their bullshit games and just riding
the vibe of love and sharing - the energy of several hundred people coming 
together as one and rejoicing is something that we rarely get a chance to
experience in this day and age (now you know what my idea of a good rave is)
which is what is so special about the house movement/techno nation..

Word has it that some of the deep house
dj's in NYC still religiously play that track, and religiously is an apt word
indeed. Oh yeah, the track is "Can you Feel It" and can be found on the
"In the Key of E" comp as well as the Trax records Fingers, Inc. double album
If you find the original 12", consider yourself blessed (although it must have
been bootlegged by now). I'll post some more info that I have archived
around here somewhere as soon as I locate it. And now for the corrected
version (props to Leah for typing the whole thing in and getting it DAMN
near perfect!):

**FLAME ON**

I've tried to contain myself, and have done so successfully for a long
time. But I know I'm not the only one who feels that posting three
four-line messages about happenings at the Stanford Coffee House in a
five-minute period is out of place on sfraves.

I'm a Stanford student and I don't give a shit about these events; I can't
imagine that the other 259 people on the list, of whom fewer that 20% are
at Stanford, could care about it either. If you want to post this shit
somewhere, please start a local newsgroup for it (su.rave), or put in on
alt.rave.

I don't mind pressing "d" for the occasional bogus message. But bursts of
three or more utterly bogus messages on a fairly regular basis seems to me
to be a bit on the inconsiderate side. And I'm being polite.

**FLAME OFF**

I don't want to start a flame fest. But I'd like to be able to stay on
sfraves without going insane.

Damn, sorry for those who went to DNA (including me). It was only a record

Gee Jonathan, whassup?

I too am intererested in getting postings about the SU Coffee house
events (they're actually in the quadrangle outside the coffee house in
the commons between tressidder/coffee-house/snack-shop).  I just wish
they had regular events like that back when I was a student... 

I went to the last event and had a good time. I like dancing to
hip-hop, raggamuffin, deep-house, acid-jazz just as much as I like
dancing to techno/rave music. 

I think Pat's postings are just as topical as postings about Timothy
Leary, Psychic TV, Crash Worship, Consolidated :-), CCRMA concerts,
etc. Hey, this list is about finding/discussing good music/events,
locating friendly gathering of like-minded techno-pagans, dancing like
a maniac, and having fun, no? I think the events Pat is putting on
qualify in every way:
	(1) They're Bay Area events (not everyone lives in SF);
	(2) They're free (it's not like pat is using the list for
			  free advertising to fill his pockets w/ green);
	(3) They're dance-music related events.

Yes, i guess it would have been nicer for Pat to post all his text in
one message. But since Pat is posting from forsythe.stanford.edu, i
conjecture that it may be difficult for him to accomplish major feats
of editing on that braindead system: I believe forsythe.stanford.edu
is either an IBM Mainframe running MVS (make-vomit-system) or a DEC
mainframe running VMS (vomit-making-system). 

(Is this at all true, Pat?)

PS: Alas, since i'm working at home today, I won't be able to make
tonight's event. Otherwise, they're very convenient for me since the
coffee house is about 1.5 miles from work in Palo Alto.

here's what I think, hey you asked.

I really like sfraves and I like about 95%
of the people I've met through sfraves.  I'm
generally interested in what they're up to and
I'm generally jacked into the net about 95%
of my conscious waking time.  not to mention 
those unconscious moments when I'm sleep-key-boarding
through the net.  so to quote the famous drukman,
" no such thing as too much mail "

( hope god doesn't get pissy over the   
  way I freely sample his personal dj )

so I say, let it all hang out.  though I usually
find mr. steuer << sp ? to be a reasonable person.

granted, there are more appropriate places for
some of the posts ( like one I'm tempted to supply
re natural language processing ) ( but won't ) and
sfraves is a fast way to reach people who are likely
to share your interests.  and, I'll repeat what I've
said before:  not everyone has access to rn.
believe it or not.

> including non-linear harmonic balance

I prefer the linear thing personally since that's what music is

Somewhere past 1AM I tune into Child 107.7 and hear Scott Hardkiss working
a great set.  Of course, any recording is disturbed by this hauntingly
inflated voice giving me the SID over and over again.  The promoters for
the Halloween Caspar rave come on the air plugging the bjesus out of the
three-room-one-roof extravaganza coming up.  They also make a pitch for
the Tower records Carlos/Dutch "Pull My Finger" ordeal for tonight. That
number is 415-281-0586.  Interestingly enough, the promoters mention the
cost: $20 (for Caspar).  __________your comments here.  Too much in my
opinion.  The holidays are becomming the rave promoters mecca much in the
same sense they are for the film industry.  The big gunners (Sharon, Caspar
Graveyard Shift) drop these epic parties on a no-longer unsuspecting public
the minute school shuts down and a holiday is called.  What's next: "Free
World: Columbus Raves"  No doubt XMAS will have in store a few intresting
raves.  All the better to find smaller more spirited gatherings.  FMR,
Alternity, and if big, Basics which delivers.  Can anyone recall such a

First, an apology.

My flameoid posting on Friday was out of line. I was in a really pissy
mood, and responded without really thinking about what I was saying until
it was too late. There's no excuse, so I won't try to invent one. Pat,
sorry for being a shit; the rest of you, sorry for wasting your time.

If I'm already on your virtual shitlist, stop reading now. The rest of this
message is one of those metacommentaries that many people seem to hate. I
don't know why, either, because they help our shared virtual space. But
anyway...

I absolutely agree that people should be free to post whatever they want to
here, as long as they think it may be of interest to some reasonable number
of others (i.e. would not be better suited to email), relates in some way
to raves or rave culture, and is not otheriwse objectionable in some way
(yes, I know I just broke this rule...).

But please - one post per subject! If you don't know how to use your editor
(and I know forsythe.stanford.edu / MVS / Wylbur suck the giant hairy
wazoo), then please learn it, or get an account on a machine you *can*
learn to use (Pat - you can get free account on leland.stanford.edu - a
UNIX machine - ask at Sweet Hall), or edit your messages on a PC and ship
'em up. I can think of few good reasons to post 3 four-line messages in 5
minutes...

I have it confirmed from a source at the Warfield that the Shamen will be 
performing there live on November 7 from 9pm-4am... well, sounds really 
like
a rave-type thing like Primal Scream was, and I don't know if the Shamen
will be performing live or DJing... nor do I know the price.  But
the date is confirmed and I've already got my complimentary ticket... 
call Bass or the Warfield for ticket prices and a date for when they
go on sale, because I don't know.

gotta go, this call is expensive.

too many other sfravers there that I know -- just Eric Lacy, Niels and Joel.

Anyway, my review in a nutshell --

Wicked was easily the best rave I've been to in a while.  We got there at about
1 while someone (Thomas?) was spinning some pretty good melodic house-y stuff.
The crowd was *very* into it, and we knew within five minutes of being inside
that this was going to be a fun party.  The sound system was phenominal --
amazingly loud and amazingly clean.  Jeno spun a very good power set.  Then 
this DJ with a blonde wig came on.  It was Markie Mark, who played an incredible
set of fierce pounding acid house and techno.  Both Jeno and Markie Mark were
spot on in every way -- mixing style, musical selection and energy level.  Fab.

Then Garth came on.  He started out playing some good stuff, but his mixes were
sloppy, and I started to get annoyed.  Then for the rest of the rave he played 
this real trashy disco-y stuff that I absolutely hated.  Yuck yuck yuck.

Personals:

dit -- where were you?
cynthia -- too bad we weren't able to get together at the rave to discuss
	the ambiguities of the English language

This seems extremely unlikely.  I know certain sfravers have been discussing
the notion of having a rave on Alcatraz, so maybe someone is just high and
got confused.  But ya never know, stranger things have been known to hap-
pen.

P.S. The Berkeley SFRavers lunch and subsequent trip to SF were so much fun
I forgot that I was supposed to sing in Hertz Hall that night.  Ooops.
well, I'm sure the other singers covered nicely for me.

What can I say?
Wicked was the most delicious final course
to a weekend of hard core raving  for me that started at Freedom Harvest.

It was all the things that I love about this type of rave.
The sound system was loud but clean, sort of right on the edge between
pleasure and pain (I do wear ear plugs these days).  The crowd was great,
I saw lots of folks from FREEDOM HARVEST the night before.  Every DJ played
an absolutely killer set.  
It was HOT (but not as hot as the last wicked in this location), STEAMY,LOUD,
INTENSE and _VERY_ SEXY.  In short, WICKED is as good an adjactive as I can think of to describe this rave.  I loved it.  I think its the heat that
keeps the "cool" crowd from comming to this, you can't last long here if:

	1. Your afraid to sweat.
	2. You can't stand hot temperatures.
	3. You drink a lot of alcohol.
	4. You can't tolerate gender/race/sex mixing.
	5. You can't tolerate lots of smoke.

About 3 am, they did there usual tradmark thing of filling the place with fog.
I used to not like this but now I'm kinda into it.  I can imagine what this
place would look like if someone from the christian right smuggled
a video camera in and showed the footage to Pat Robinson.

Unfortunately, the end was marred by a less than stellar performance by the SFPD.

After WICKED let out, ravers were congregating and cooling out in the sunshine outside.  Some folks were dancing to car stereos others were munching food
or smoking cigaretts.  There was one car with a Tank of something.
When, all of a sudden, here comes a crusier who pulls up with his lights on.  Most people didn't respond too quickly just thinking that he was here to make sure the road stayed open so trucks could make deliveries and stuff.  Well this cop gets out with a huge flashlight/club and starts yelling at people that they need to disperse right away or risk getting arrested and that the wagons are on the way.  He Then begins to verbally abuse a bunch of people and starts to say
stupid shit like "If you guys want shotguns, we got shotguns!" Was this guy
from the moon or what? I must say  that in best raver form, the crowd sensed
that this insecure, ego-tripping cop was not worth the energy of a confrontation, so most people just gave him dirty looks and got in their cars
and left.  I didn't think it was an appropriate time to "talk" to him as
I was comming down from a wonderful ExperiencE and  wasn't
prepared to be arrested and have my person or car searched.  I tried to
get close enough to see his badge number but couldn't.  His crusier
number was 040 though.  There really was no excuse for this type  of behavior,
all he had to say was that "the party's over - time to clear the streets
so deliveries can be made" Everyone would have complied.  Is there some
way that we can make a formal complaint/statement so that this type of
behavior is discouraged.  If this had been a drinking crowd, his windshild would have been broken in two seconds flat.  I don't want to see this stuff
escalate into a big thing.  Someone needs to talk to the SFPD, if this is
the shape of things to come.

Anyway, everyone went to DNA later, I had previous commitments so I had to leave.
How was it?

I'll post about freedom harvest in anther letter.

		THE CHOICE OF AA NEW GENERAATION -- HOUSE
		-----------------------------------------

	In case you have been wondering what is going on with the House
Movement in Britain, here  is a taste courtesy of Evolution Magazine, Britain, May  1992. (See reverse side)

	Oh, yes, and remember, since the passing of the Bright Nill in 19990,
dancing to House Music in natural  outdoor settings is a criminal offense.
Organizing such an event can put you in prision.  This has forced House into the  cogs of the western econimic machine, empowering  and giving the monopoly to the nightclub/alcohol industry.

	Many people have sacrificed a great deal, even gone to jail so we can
have our House Music and so that it can be enjoyed on a global level as it is today.  Don't let them down.  Let's not trivialize and take for granted this truly libeerating movement.  House is a chance for personal and planetary
transformation, and  here in the U.S. we still have our freedom of expression
[so far -ed] -- USE IT!

	We are not here to just escape the world.  We are here to UNITE!

	This is our new form of expression; a movement that includes everyone.
But wait-- it's not going to happen on its own.  No one is going to do it for
you.  This is your place; your House Movement.  It is reflected through you--
how you conduct  yourself-- it is constantly being shaped by your actions and
no one else's; both at the party and in the rest of your life.

	It is this generation that is left to pick up the pieces and construct
a post-nuclear, peace=keeping society that is mapping a course of regeneration rather than  annihilation.  What sort of people are we?  The House Movement is helping re-establish solid foundations for a friendlier, conscious, more
caring world.

My first outdoor nightime beach rave.  I have now concluded that 
the 1 - 1.5 hour drive down the coast is worth it for this type of 
happening.

The music, people, site, energy etc. was incredibly beautiful.
The sky was remarkably clear, and the missing moon allowed the
stars to do show us the full sparkle, shimmer and shooting thing.
We got there at around 2:30 and it was still going strong when
we left at around 8:30.  We would have stayed forever
except that my wife's diabetic condition required a more
prudent course of action.  We'll be better prepared next time.

What also made this rave extra special was that it was my younger
brother's (visiting from LA) first rave.  Words can only provide
a cheap description of what this experience was for him.  I suppose I 
might as well use the starting-to-get-tired-but-still-useful-cliche:
He "got" it.

One of a million little stories from that nite:
Shortly after we arrived, my friend decided to hike back to the
car to put his jacket away.   I ran into him a little later by the
music dancing like a totally deranged maniac.  He told me (somewhat
hysterically) that the cops were in the parking lot and 
were about to close the whole thing down.  Apparently he was 
attempting to compress an entire night of dancing into the few 
remaining minutes.  Me, I looked around at all the tripped-out 
people (i.e. everyone) and decided that there was no way 
anyone would go through so much trouble to close down something
this beautiful.  It was a mind-protecting rationalization that
prved to be correct. 

Looking forward to Alternity2, and if things go right, ComeUnity.

The Shamen and the Utah Saints will be performing live, and Jeno will be
DJ-ing.  I've heard that the show is pretty decent if you're into live
techno.  The cost is $20.

After reading the message about wicked's wicked police dealie, 
I am sure there is a way to make a complaint.  I was pulled over
for speeding (which I wasn't (of course!)) and the CHP officer was
veryveryvery very rude and mean, and she treated me like a drunk driver
even though Ihadn't drunk anything at all...so I called and talked to her
commanding officer (is that the right term?) and he said that he would
file it and talk to her.  Apparently this is not the first time for her,
and he sounded really cool (which was really terrifying. I mean, I have
never really talked to a really cool CHP guy) about it....I still had
to pay for the ticket though.  I am sure if you called the cop station
and asked if you could make a complaint (very nicely, of course) and said
here is my information, he was in 040 at this time at this location, they
would grudgingly send you some form or something...

I didn't make it too wicked, but I am glad it went well...I actually went
to a pocket rave in some FRATERNITY house's bassment area and danced
with abuot 15 other ravers who were equally as shocked as I was to have
 such a good time..this guy named brendan spun and so did this guy named
steven (eric>) but it was great..they went to spin at Harvest later that
night...

oh well..rambling on.

have a good week, all.

Well, Wicked was awesome! The music was the best I've heard in months
(maybe even years!). The place was packed when we arrived at 2 a.m. 
(before I set my watch back), and so was the street outside. The doorman
was a dick however; he wouldn't let me bring in a sealed plastic bottle
of water. 

I still like the old (translation: small) Wickeds of about 1 year ago
that were held at the Jessie Street location. There was almost never a
line, and if there were one, it was only 3 or 4 people long. I haven't
been back to Come Unity in over a year because I fear that it is like
a Tuesday night version of the current Wicked.

All in all though, this last Wicked was great.

sorry, i accidentally ended my last message too soon.  it was me,

i'm not sure what it was called, but there was a rave on Saturday
in Fremont (alternity?) where bands and djs played, and it was only
$5.  i couldn't make it, but my friends eric and mike and Valeria
were there, and just before Valeria could play - up went the warehouse
doors with a multitude of cops on the side...seems a hateful gang had
trashed every car (just about) in the other parking lot, and freaked up the
bouncer so he had to get taken to the hospital.  Lucky for my friends,
they parked far away, but it seemed like the violence was aimed at 
the ravers and got a lot of them.

three weeks ago...

it's about two o'clock or so on a Friday nite and I hear that there is
a free rave under the bridge in San Jose.  Sure enough there it was, 
small, but definitely a rave...then some racial tension ensues, and one
guy gets his head cut open by a bottle.  Thank God the cops got to THAT
one...someone could have died.

my point in this post is that i've gotten the feeling and it's growing
lately that rave advertisement is too overground, and sadly, not
everyone gets it.  too often (twice is too often) people are getting
hurt because the "wrong people" find out.  DISCLAIMER:  before you say
"no kind of people are the wrong kind of people at a rave" think about
the cops.  they're definitely not welkome, cos they're going to break
up the party.  any comments on this (IMHO) relevant topic?

EAST BAY REPORT

'Rave' Party TUrns Violent In Newark

	A secret "rave" party in a Newark warehouse erupted into fighting,
three stabbings, two beatings and car-window smashing early yesterday.

	The Saturday night party at Bay Cities Bumper Service at 8261
Enterprise Drive drew about 500 people who here "jammed into a warehouse,
virtually wall-to-wall," said Newark police Sergeant Lance Morrison. The
event did not have the required police permit and had all the trappings of a
"rave" - intensely loud techno-beat music accompanied by the drug Ectasy for
an all-night high. [Where do they get this? The police said NOTHING about
any drugs at the scene...]

	But, Morrison said, "This turned out to be the antithesis of a rave.
... It turned into gang-violence stuff." [Sounds like this Morrison guy more
or less knows what he's talking about, in contrast to the reporter.]

	Around 11:30 p.m., Bay Cities Bumper owner Peter Arde called the
police, who arrived to find "blood on the walls" from fights witnesses said
were started by gang member, Morrison said. Many left to find that their car
windows had been smashed.

	Among the injured was Marcos Miranda, a 19-year-old from San Jose,
who was stabbed in the arm and needed 22 stiches at Eden Hospital in
Hayward. A 16-year-old from San Jose was stabbed in the hand and was taken
to Washington Hospital in Fremont.

	Lugo Ininiguez, a 28-year-old Newark man, was severely beaten with
fist blows to the face. A juvenile has been arrested for the assault.

	Two other incidents - a stabbing and a beating that resulted in head
injuries - occurred down the street from the warehouse shortly after
midnight. The victims were taken to Eden Hospital.

	All the victims were treated and released, Morrison said. The
stabbing and beating cases are under investigation. Anyone with information
is asked (510) 793-1400. [sic]

	Morrison said Arde would be billed "a couple of thousand dollars"
for the police and fire response to the melee. "I don't think he's going to
rave about that." [groan...]

Does anyone know what was going on at the rave (?) that the
Chron reported on today that apparently had some gang
violence occur, which was held last night in Newark?

No good details were in the short article, except that it
was held at an existing club and run by the club's normal
owner.

One good thing: Newark PD officer who was commenting about
it mentioned that "while it had the trappings of a rave,
apparently some gang members came in and were starting 
fights, sort of the antithesis of a rave" or something
to that effect.  Apparently an officer who actually

Subject: Freedom Harvest & HouseNation


	By the end of this weekend, there was no longer any doubt in my mind
that the rave/house scene is definately a Movement.  Those of you who
disagree are welcome to do so, but I won't argue this point with you.
It's not important to me to try to "convert" you to my mode of thought, I do
think, however if you find the right experience, that you will find this
to be true.  Freedom Harvest was definately one of the best raves that I have
ever been to.  Maybe this is because I could enjoy it and not have to
"work" like when we throw Connection or the last couple of FMRs.  The spot
was wonderful and indeed beautiful.  I estimate that we had about 1500
people.  I didn't count cars this time but I can imagine that we had a lot.
Each DJ played wonderful music, the weather was warm and gentle, the sky was
very dark (close to new moon) and clear with a good view of the milkyway
and several shooting stars. (The night sky, in my opinion is the best
possible Visual you could ever have).  I definately think we all got into
that space of no-time or Eternity.  I started to get a little scared when
it was 6:45 and the sky was still black with a million stars abalze,
this rave seemed to go on forever, for a moment I though we had gone through
some form of time tunnel or something.  But, as always, the morning did come.
It was so wonderful to look around and see everyones faces and watch the sky 
turn blue and color come back to the world.

	Freedom Harvest was the perfect rave for me, well almost.
A couple of incidents involving people having a little too much fun with
certain substances did bring me down in the morning.  We had to "rescue"
a raver who was dosed and passed out on an off-shore rock as the tide was 
comming in. (Am I the only one who calls and finds out the high and low
tide times when we have beach events?) He was suffering from hypothermia
and had to be taken to the hospital.  Another person had to be taken to the
hospital for basically tweaking too much.  I went to the hospital with them
and saw the guy on the rock as well, both were released and are well.

	This brings me to the next point.  The last experiences have left me
with the feeling that if we don't do something as a community to look after
people at these events someone will most certainly die.  I'm VERY serious
when I say this and I'm not being paranoid.  WE NEED TO WAKE THE FUCK UP
and realize that our parents are not with us and that if we don't want the
authorities at our events or policing us WE NEED TO DO IT OURSELVES.
I'm not talking about goons with flashlights, but I am talking about looking
out for ravers who have taken too much or are asleep when the tide comes in and stuff like that.  It doesn't take much effort and NO NOONE ELSE WILL DO IT IF YOU DON'T.  We all want to have fun but I feel like I don't want to come to these things anymore if I have to be the only one who is looking out and making
sure people don't kill themselves.  All we need is a death at one of these things for the authorities to come down on us and it won't be then acting faschistic
that causes it.  It will be us and our immature behavior.  If we are a community
we need to start acting like one.  Would you let your younger brother pass
out on an off shore rock and say "OH, he's allright!".  What good is all of this
family talk if we don't put it in practice.

	I think we need to have people trained in first-aid, CPR and basic 
psychological skills needed to deal with people who are freaking out on
psychedelics.  We need more that one person who can do this at a rave.  These
people (who I call Keepers as in the Keeper of the House :) would also space 
around and watch the "space" and make sure that everyone was OK, that noone
was passedout and in need of assistance, (sometime you just go up and say 
"are you all right?")  You can still dance and have fun and your state can
mostlikely be altered (but probibly should not be blasted) but you need to be able to function in an emergency or at least get someone who can.
These folks could wear some form of armband or other designator.  I'm
going to talk to the Roc Med people about this. I'm serious we need to think about doing this ASAP, before something bad happens.

Yeah -- I was stumped about their cup/bottle policy too.  They wouldn't let you
bring in cups or bottles from the outside, and they wouldn't let you take out
cups or bottles from the inside.  I figure it's one of those matter/antimatter
things, where if a cup from the inside came into contact with a cup from the
outside, there would be a violent explosion and the rave would get busted.

I think your post, geoff, was excellent and I would like
immediately to volunteer to assume a "psycho-counseling"
role at any rave in the future and I think you're absolutely
right--we're not with our parents and I wouldn't take my
children to a rave.  also, if we could have a designated 
place to report some "troublesome" behavior that may be
cool since I saw some at the fmr but didn't know who to 
tell and basically removed myself from that area of the
beach

did I mention I'm a survivalist yet ?

now of course you must consider whether you'd want to
be psycho-counseled by ME but that's another issue 

and as an aside my life was saved at a grateful dead show by
an angel and I find it rather amusing to read all this
"it was the best rave ever" cuz it kinda sounds like
"it was the best CHINA CAT ever, really, uh, what was I saying"
and this is not at all intended to be a flame thing since I like
the grateful dead and I like raves it just all starts to sound
familiar once you have to start dying the grey outta your hair

so can anyone tell which particular sfraver's writing style I'm
trying to mimic in my e-mail-mimic-0-mania-modeP ?  thanks,
I'd appreciate it if you let me know if you recognize it

the whole idea about having people help is a great idea and should be

a ball, but even if they are freaking out, I really just don't know what
to do (other than talking to them, reminding them that it will be over or
whatever, that they can be in control, etc) but I am not sure if that's even
a good way to go about it.  When my friend got in trouble using hydroponic
pot, she just needed me to talk to her to give her a foundation to fall back
on...that was fine until she started fainting...

Wicked:
The music flowed perfectly all night.  Each DJ played a great set especially
Garth and his disco at the end (IMHO)!
When I saw Thomas in the parking lot after he spun he seemed pretty drunk,
can anyone tell me how is set at pure was? (since he usually doesn't do such
a good job in that state of mind).
BTW, The police car took off as the doorman started writing the license
plate number down and I believe either he or the owner of townsend sent
in a complaint.

DNA:
Carlos and graeme (la paix) both played great sets, but simon (the townsend
bartender simon not to be confused with the uk's simon) didn't quite do such
a good job.  The songs he played were great but they didn't fit together at
all, but hopefully with some more practice he'll get there. (not to also

I thought I might post this again. In the light of what has been happening.

BTW, I'm signed up for Combined Community & BLS at the SF red cross
chapter Nov 17,19,and 24 6 - 10 pm  (BLS-32146) $55.00
Their number is 202-0600

They are offering the first aid progression on Dec 10.
Advanced First Aid (which deals with what to do if the EMT won't get there 
in 3 mins. starts February 2 - March 11  Tue  & Thur 6 - 10pm $70.00

Let me know if any of you ravers out there are into taking any of these
classes with me.  We could make it sort of a community thing, even go out
after class or whatever.  Oh, this listing is for Palo Alto, The SF or
Berkeley Chapter will have similar classes but the price, times, duration
etc may vary.

Rave On.

----- Begin Included Message -----

Well, there IS a solution, the Red Cross offers first aid courses
at a varity of levels for very little money.

The courses Offered which are related to Us are:

	STANDARD FIRST AID
	This course includes Adult CPR skills and first aid
	skills including the Secondary Survey, First Aid for
	Bleeding, Shock, Burns, Diabetic Emergencies and more.
	Upon successful completion the student will receive an
	Adult CPR and a Standard First Aid certificate.  (Meets
	most OSHA requirements for first aid training)
	Time: 9 hours Fee: $35.00

	STANDARD FIRST AID PROGRESSION COURSE
	This course is for individuals who hold a current Adult CPR
	certificate or another American Red Cross or American Heart
	Association Certificate that includes Adult CPR.  This course
	is essentially the second-half of the Standard First Aid course.
	Time: 5 hours Fee: $24.00

	CPR: BASIC LIFE SUPPORT FOR THE PROFESSIONAL RESCUER
	This is the course for anyone who has a duty to respond!
	It includes the skills taught in Community CPR and teaches
	you how  to perform 2-Rescuer CPR, how to use the pocket
	resuscitation mask and airway management techniques (i.e.
	Mounth-to-Nose, Modified Jaw Thrust.)
	Time:12 hours Fee: $45.00

	COMMUNITY CPR
	Community CPR instruction is thhe program that teaches skills
	in rescue  breathing, first aid for choking and CPR for adults,
	children and infants.  This is a nine-hour course and you must
	attend all sessions in order to receive certification.
	Time: 9 hours Fee: $35.00

	ADVANCED FIRST AID/ ADVANCED WILDERNESS FIRST AID
	For those who have a special interest in first aid, (e.g., you
	want to become an EMT, you are part of an emergency response
	team at work)   This is a 60-hour, intensive, hands-on course.
	The Wilderness First Aid course emphasizes emergenciies that
	occur while in the wilderness and utilizes materials thatt are
	accessible to hikers,, campers and backpackers.
	Time: 60 hours Fee: $65.00


Call your local red cross chapter for a schedule of dates and times.
I want to encourage as many of you out there
as possible to take at least a basic CPR or STANDARD FIRST AID course.
If we are going to continue to have raves in places like Bonny Dune
which are remote and secluded we need to be ready for emergencies.
The authorities will also look more favorably on us if they see us
behaving like a community and taking some responsibility.  One of the
things that worries me about some (but most certainly NOT all) of the 
British ravers that I have encountered, is that they want to have fun
and feel like they have a right to come to a site and have a rave, they
get riled at the authorities for shutting them down, but they don't want
to clean up after themselves or take precautions to assure that people can
be safe at a rave. 

Maybe as an incentive, ravers who have RED Cross First aid traing can get a discount of the price and EMTs, MDs or others with verifiable First Aid
credentials could be admitted for free.  This cost the promoters almost
Nothing, what  they get is immediate recognition of who has Emergency Training
they know exactly how many of these people they have  on site and they get coverage for free.  What they may need to invest in is a complete first aid kit
which most likely cost about $200.

is the promotional/hype arm of a remix service called DMC.  they're

lot of qool stuph.  since it only comes out once a month, they also
publish mixmag update - a weekly offering for DJs featuring a few
articles, charts and reviews of the latest releases.  on with the
review...


Mixmag Update 15 october 1992 issue 256

The Ultraviolet Catastrophe
The Trip
(Twitch)

Not being sure whether to even touch a record called "The Trip," we
donned our psychedelia-proof gloves and proceeded with caution only to
find a dated, rigid, Euro sounding plodder.  However, the B-side's
"Trip Harder" is a different matter, opening up with a serious
freestyle beat (sampling Kool and the Gang's "Jungle Boogie"), the
track progresses through rolling hi-hats, tribal samples and a manic
timbale section into an underplayed synthline.  This is heightened by
more tribal samples, analogue swirls and topped off by a "Le Blanc"
style beat that crashes in.  This is not music for the techno
puritans, but it is well programmed, it is funky, and in a time where
too many are content to sit back on their laurels and repeat the same
old formula this is a welcome breath of fresh air.

> In Mountain View (in front of the Tower Records/Bay City Roasters
> FREE FREE FREE
> 7 - 11 pm.

and I went by there for the hell of it.  Sound system was
really quiet, and there wasn't much more than half dozen
people dancing.  Plenty of the usual high school cool people
hanging around, though, and Carlos and Dutch WERE really
spinning. 

It turns out that this was a promotional gig for Casper.
They were passing out what has to be the all time most
expensive rave flyer: it was printed on the sleeve of a
twelve inch single by Aquatherium, autographed by B.
McCarthy and Mark G! on the spot.  Side "E" is a cut called
"Casper", very lame generic techno with stupid clips from
the "Casper the Friendly Ghost" cartoon.  Side "X" isn't too
bad though, with a couple of more interesting cuts on it:
"B-Zone", which is kind of strange and murky and "Power",
which is more tribalesque.

(I was just thinking, wouldn't it be cool if the Casper
promoters lost their shirts?  It isn't impossible: Halloween
is a pretty big weekend, personally I know about two private
parties I'd like to go to, I'd really like to do Castro
Street for once, and if I was going to spend bucks I'd
probably go to Exotic Erotic, and even if I wasn't doing all
of that there'd be the usual Stanford things to do, like
dancing on Leland Stanford Jr.'s tomb....  So maybe the
Hollywood blockbuster syndrome is about to run it's course,
and Casper will scare away some of the big money boys.  Oh,
well, a nice fantasy anyway.)  

Anyway, one odd little thing at this Tower records affair:
admist all the usual glitzy fliers being given away, there
was a small stack of little pink cards that say "Alternity"
on them.... I looked around and didn't see anyone I knew.
Where did these things come from?  

I get the feeling that Alternity 2 isn't going to be quite
as relaxed as the first one was...

Since we are doing a _little_ bit of promotion this time, rather 
than purely word-of-mouth like last, there will be people there
who _don't_ have e-mail accounts.  But we do know that 48 hours

Bad idea, you don't know what else they may be on if they were really freaking 
out.  For instance if they had gotten really drunk before doing the tab of acid
valium would be a BAD BAD thing (maybe fatal).

Yes, I generally agree, but I still think this is a good idea.  As I said, a
last resort (I thought I made it clear, but maybe not enough).  I am well
aware of some of the possible nasty effects of mixing drugs (through experience
as well as literature). 

The point is that when someone is really freaking or hysterical the wise use of
vallium (or possibly MJ) can be beneficial.  Of course, administering something
like this to someone you don't know is probably the real problem.  I wouldn't
want someone to be liable.

Actually, there are a couple of guys who are CPR certified and are currently
going to raves.  You might have seen Doc (he's tall, goatee, etc and often
wears an earset thingy or whatever it's called) at various raves; I know he
was at Vision.  I've talked to him a lot, and he seems very serious about
making sure there is always at least one certified CPR person at every rave.
I don't know if he has enough people, but he tries.  Unfortunately, a lot of
promoters don't really care if he's there or not.  Some promoters, like Mike
and Josh of Juice, haven't been overwhelmingly excited about working with him
(I think.  At least, they weren't at Cosmofuckedupgrooveathon).  Since Mike 
and Josh are my friends, I'll keep my opinions about that and Juice in general

et al. were very much a part of the Haight Scene.  Are the rave artists ravers, or do they just turn them out for their employers?

getting in touch with the Office of Civilian Complaints.  It's evidently
headed by a very competent person who is interested in bettering

I'm with howard on this one
I've been "aware" of the drug scene for quite some time now
I've witnessed "unfortunate experiences"
I don't thinking mixing anything in with anything else
is a good idea 
I don't think anyone who's being cared for dies from lsd overdose
and I think the best way to handle a bad situation is to go
into it prepared with a "survival kit" of toys / food /

I disagree again.  from my experiences with niacin it just
makes you really flushed and may increase you pulse.  I
personally would not want this if I were in a bad situation.
it would just make me more paranoid than I already am.

I think putting someone who needs help in the hands of
someone who's been there before is the best solution,
not putting any more chemicals into their system unless
doctors are administering the chemicals.

it can be an interesting experience to talk people down
you certainly get a brain-dump from them

only take so much stress.  I think we need to put energy into maintaining
and improving the scene.  A strong scene will be able to take care of
itself.  One of the best things about raves is that there is no center, they
are very anarchic.  But if we don't want a central authority, we need to all
take on part of the responsibility.  We can't just say "Oh, someone will
take care of it," we need to get up and start in ourselves.  For example, I
am really disturbed by the recent drug casualties we've seen.  It bothers me
that they are handed over to 911.  We need something like Rock Med [Rave

Subject: rave the vote! // Pure // Wicked


Hey, I cast the first stone today.... I unexpectedly got a ballot
shoved in my face while visiting SF City hall -- I was trying to get
an absentee ballot but they said it would be best to vote now...

What a relief. See ya, Bush! See ya Quayle! Sayonara suckers! You're
outta here! Looking forward to Clinton/Gore presidency w/ Perot as
adviser and Mario Cuomo on the supreme court. 

			--------------------

I'm glad Pure sucked, on the other hand, Wicked woulda been
really crowded without Pure. It was pretty obvious that Pure would suck
when i saw a huge poster for it -- not in the hip-Haight -- but in the
unhip Clement St restaurant-area.

			--------------------

I enjoyed Wicked, but not nearly as much as the previous weekend's rave in
fremont nor the previous mini-wicked. My evening was marred by a run-in
with a real asshole (yet another drunken scotsman -- YADS)... i was dancing
w/ a new-found friend and YADS comes up and asks me "mind if I dance w/
your girlfriend" and I give him a "whatever"-look while recalling scenes in
black and white movies where sailors about to go off to war would ask to
cut in on a dance... but this was a friggin' rave, not a big-band dance!

Anyways... before i had a chance to reply he hauls her out to the center of
the dancefloor and they're doing the techno-tarantella-a-deux.... not being
one to consciously participate in any mating rituals, I decide to go chill
outside...  later, me and my friend meet up again -- "what an psychopath"
she says -- so we're dancing and having fun, and YADS comes up again and
asks "is <...> your girlfriend"...  she flinches, but I respond truthfully
"no, we're just friends" ... she gives me a very disappointed look, and
kicks me in the shin lightly as he forcibly hauls her out on the dancefloor
for more awkard-looking techno-tarantella-a-deux (turned out she lied her
way out of the last one and claimed I was her boyfriend). this time, she
breaks away and I see YADS hit her in the back of the head as she's walking
away.  I had to go up, say "that was really uncool dude" shook my head with
pity, and walked away (he looked like the fighting type -- never mess with
YADS).

That happening, plus all the people that decided they needed to rev their
engines and peel out in the parking lot upon departure made me realize
there were more uncool elements at this rave than any other "underground"
event i've ever been to.... Why do people need to confront bystandars with
the sad-sounding wails of long-dead dinosaurs?

I really was hoping the asshole contingent would go to Pure, so we could
have fun! (actually, I had a good enough time... i just like bitching when
shit happens).

In this case, 911 was called because the people could not talk to the person
and the person was speechless.  He was shivering and no-one knew what to do.
If you don't know the situation then I think we should dial 911.  Better
busted than dead.  If we could have taken this person's vitals.
(Pulse, Blood Pressure, Temperature,etc.) we could have made a better call.
So far Roc Med has not returned my call. I'll call again.

preserving the knowledge of the past.  Only now is that technically feasible
on a scale that allows all to participate.  

This doesn't even bring into account the music technologies like sampling,
the sound reproduction technologies like subsonic bass, the laser and video

the words "Bending Space & Time 10/10" and "Mind + Taste = Boom" in greek

  Just a word about using niacin to calm people..
Niacin suppresses tryptophan pyyrolase, the enzyme that removes dietary
TRP from the system.(preventing it from being metabolized into serotonin.)
..
Serotonergicity (calming) might also be helped
by taking supplemetal B6 and carbohydrate (fruit juice..?)along with the
niacin (Disclaimer:I'm not trying to suggest anything here..)
Ravers might try this before going to sleep after a long rave..
I do it and find it works for me..The niacin flush goes away if you take
it every day, in my experience.

Not unless the safety monitors is a full-fledged doctor, in my book.  I
think the ONLY chemical that non-doctors should be administering to people
at raves is WATER and possibly FRUITS.  If you don't know what particular
cornucopia of substances people are on, giving them _anything_ else is
too risky.  I know people who've taken not only X and LSD at the same time
(probably the only safe combination) but also speed, hard liquor, and
even vivarin, all at once!  Very bad, because in any case where you combine
drugs the whole is usually greater than the sum of its parts. When you
combine stimulants and depressants they wage a war within your head - 
which is what I think happened to our friend at Bonny Doon.  At that
point, what people need most is to be consoled, rehydrated, and made
to feel *secure*.  That's what our role as ravers should be, when we're
looking out for others.  And if we're lucky enough to have taken extensive
first aid classes and feel confident in our abilities to administer it,
then by all means do so.  But don't put a flashlight to a freaker's eyes,
say, "ooo look! They're dilated!" and inject him with something.  Yow, that
gives me the willies.

In general, 90% of everything is unoriginal crap.  And 90% of the rave flyers
I've seen are clones of each other, using the same ideas (collage) and the
same technology (Photoshop) in the same way every time.  The other 10% --
the Peace flyers, the Basics business cards, those tiny Come Unity squares --
were interesting, though, mainly because they were very simple and low-tech

I saw a flyer for an interesting, kinda different sort of rave
and am passing on the info.  It's a NUDE RAVE happening this
Thursday Oct 29 at 150 Folsom in SF.  $15 au naturel, $20 attired
to get in.  It's put on by FAN (Fags Au Naturel).  Did I 
mention it's a queer event?

Talk about intense...a bunch of NEKKID people swaying to the
boogety beat.

i most definitely second the idea of having people trained in CPR, etc. at
raves.  i'm sure that you get some sort of certification when you complete
you complete your training.  it could be a new trend in promoting raves.
if you're certified, you get in free.  you could be issued a speshuhl
glow-in-the-dark badge, so anyone would recognize them. (it CAN be hard
to find someone at a rave :)

just an opinion...

Subject: Re: slag technology? (LONG MESSAGE)


I agree on much of your note about technology but can't agree with some of your
concluding statements about technology being neutral. I can see that technology
is used for certain ends and that it can be used for both good and bad
applications. However many of the technologies we are creating are not neutral
but supportive of the culture we have created for ourselves. 

I am including a section of a book by Jerry Mander called "IN THE ABSENCE OF THE 
SACRED: THE FAILURE OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE INDIAN NATIONS". 
Copyright 1991 by Jerry Mander. Distributed by Sierra Club Books.  

This is mainly about computers but the introduction is his arguments against 
the neutrality of technology. I am not saying that I agree with everything he 
has to say but he does make some very good points and obviously one should read
more of his book before dismissing his arguments. Anyway for anyone interested 
here goes.

>From Chapter 3: FANTASY AND REALITY

The Assumption That Technology is Neutral

No notion more completely confirms our technological somnambulism than the
idea that technology contains no inherent political bias.  From the political
Right and Left, from the corporate world and the world of community activism,
one hears the same homily: "The problem is not with technology itself, but
with how we use it, and who controls it."  This idea would be merely
preposterous if it were not so widely accepted, and so dangerous.  In
believing this, however, we allow technology to develop without analyzing its
actual bias.  And then we are surprised when certain technologies turn out to
be useful or beneficial only for certain segments of society.
   A prime example is nuclear energy, which cannot possibly move society in a
democratic direction, but _will_ move society in an autocratic direction.
Because it is so expensive and so dangerous, nuclear energy must be under the
direct control of centralized financial, governmental, and military
institutions...
   The existence of nuclear energy, and nuclear weaponry, in turn requires
the existence of what Ralph Nader has called a new "priesthood" -- a
technical and military elite capable of guarding nuclear waste products for
the approximately 250,000 years that they remain dangerous.  So if some
future society, tiring of the present path, should determine to move away
from a centralized technological society and toward, say, an agrarian
society, it would be impossible.  The technical elite would need to remain,
if only to deal with the various wastes left behind.  So it is fair to say
that nuclear technology _inherently_ steers society toward greater political
and financial centralization, and greater militarization.
   Solar energy, on the other hand, is intrinsically biased _toward_
democratic use.  It is buildable and operable by small groups, even by
families.  It does not require centralized control.  It is most cost
effective at a small scale of operation, a reason why big power companies
oppose it.  And solar energy requires no thousand-year commitment from
society.
   So, where nuclear energy requires centralized control, solar energy
functions best in a decentralized form.  These attributes are inherent to the
technologies and reflect the ideological bias of each...
   ... Each new technology invariably steers society in _some_ social and
political direction, by its very nature...
   As stated earlier, the idea that technology is neutral is itself not
neutral, since it blinds us to the ultimate direction in which we are
heading, and directly serves the promoters of the centralized technological
pathway...
   ... the idea of value-free technology confirms a formidable pro-technology
mind-set.  This, in turn, blinds us to the negative evidence at hand that
technotopia has already failed and will only create more problems in the
future.


>From Chapter 4:  SEVEN NEGATIVE POINTS ABOUT COMPUTERS

   Without computers, the megatechnological age simply would not happen.
Computers are basic to every new technical innovation, whether in
communications, the military, genetics, transportation, automation, or
multinational corporate activity.
   Because of this universality of applications and implications, computers
have been celebrated more than any technology since electricity.  Education,
corporate leaders, presiden tial candidates, futurists, and the media sing a
unified chorus of praise.
   The situation is ludicrous.  Computer technology has sprung us headlong
into an entirely new existence, one that will permanently affect our lives
and the lives of our children.  ..  yet there is no meaningful debate about
it, no ferment, no critical analysis of the consequences...
   Even environmentalists have failed to maintain the usual skepticism about
corporate claims, accepting the apparent short-run benefits of computers
without grasping that computers actually steer society in a direction that
_contradicts_ environmental goals.
   And writers!  I must have been asked two dozen times how I can say that
computers are negative when they are so useful to writers...  Unfortunately,
the major question about computers is not whether they serve your or your
organization or your business well.  I wish it were so simple to just take
this personal view.  We must look at the totality of how computers affect
society, and life on Earth.  We need to dredge each dimension of their impact
and put it all together into one picture before we can judge their existence
as beneficial or harmful...

1.  POLLUTION AND HEALTH

Since its birth, the microelectronics industry has enjoyed a reputation as
something apart from, better than, and cleaner than the old smokestack
industries...

This reputation is not deserved.  Computers are not the "free lunch" they
were promised to be.  Health and environmental problems are visible in the
communities in which the machines are built, among the workers who build
them, and among the people who use them on the job.

* * *

Computer manufacturing employs millions of gallons of acids and solvents that
are eventually disposed of at toxic dumps.  In communities where computers
are manufactured, serious problems have arisen.  In Silicon Valley,
California, for example, high concentrations of trichloroethylene, (a solvent
that the EPA has called carcinogenic) have seeped into the drinking water...
   ... According to attorney Ted Smith of the Silicon Valley Toxics
Coalition, "Workers and the general population are being exposed to the most
deadly chemicals that have ever been synthesized."
   ...There have been medical reports for many years about complaints such as
fatigue, eye strain, migraines, cataracts, and, among pregnant women who use
VDTs (video display terminals), miscarriages, birth defects, premature
births, and infant deaths.  At first it was not believed that computers could
have such effects...
   ... but it has now been shown that people are far more sensitive to
radiation than previously believed, and that causal relationships are
beginning to emerge...

2.  EMPLOYMENT.

At the 1940 World's Fair, American industry promised that computers and
automation would eliminate toil, and thus free us to pursue higher goals.  In
the 1980s industry said computers would open new careers and new kinds of
industry and would ease the burden of office workers.  In reality, these
claims are just advertising pitches attuned to the popular concerns of the
moment...
   ... The utopian vision of a work-free society, in which machines do most
of the work while all the humans relax, could only be realized if the
economic benefits of automation and computerization were somehow shared by
the workers.  It would take a revolution to make this happen.  For in
capitalist society, the benefits are disproportionately allotted to the
people who own the machines.  Computers allow them to get the same job done
with fewer pesky humans demanding increased wages, job safety, and health
insurance...
   ...Diana Roose, who is research director of the National Association of
Working Women (9 to 5), told me: "Since the introduction of the computer into
office work, job design for secretaries has changed in negative ways...The
jobs are dead ended, and because the human connection is eliminated, jobs are
less secure.  Some people are calling office work the electronic assembly
line."

3.  QUANTIFICATION AND CONCEPTUAL CHANGE

   The July 1984 issue of _New Age Journal_ featured a story by R. H. Ring
called "The Computerized Forest," which lamented the conceptual changes among
U. S. Forest Service worker s who are now asked to do their jobs mainly via
computers.  The entire forest system, says Ring, has been divided into
"management units" containing "habitat capacity" models and " maximum
sustainable yield" computations, all of which reduce the needs of species,
and the workers' understanding of them, to quantified formulas.
   ... the objective was to more efficiently account for forest _resources_
-- trees, animals, water, minerals -- and to better develop them as part of
commodity society.  A former head of the Forest Service, John Crowell... said
candidly that he favored "thinking of the world in terms of 'commodities'
rather than 'amenities.'"  So now the Flathead Forest in Montana has a
planned "output" of 200 grizzly bears.  And old-growth forest is called
"accumulated capital."
   ... the end result is passionless: a net loss in intimacy with, caring
for, and love of nature.

* * * 

   ... Computer fever is sweeping through the educational establishment...
The long-run potential for the computer industry of having every kid computer
trained is obvious.
   ... Computers are replacing teachers and teaching functions.  And they are
changing the content of the information learned in schools, from the more
subtle information that goes with the traditional teacher-student
relationship, to the more hard-edged, data-based objective content that goes
with the machine-user relationship....
   ... Computer advocates say teachers are often too busy to be that
"personal."  Computers are also infinitely patient, never tiring of working
with slow learners.  And when completing, say, repetitive drills in math or
science, the machine can advance students to new levels and keep the process
going, even when there may not be a teacher on the same floor of the
building.
   ... The questions are these: What sort of person does this educational
process produce?  And what sort of knowledge is attained?  Marian Kester,
writing in the Toronto Globe, pu t it this way: "If children are separated
from their parents by hours of TV, from their playmates by video games, and
from their teachers by teaching machines, where are they supposed to learn to
be human?"
   ... I worry that the increased use of computers in education will produce
three results:
   First of all... objective, linear knowledge will begin to dominate while
other, more subtle forms will recede.  Like the wilderness, which has
disappeared from the landscape and from our minds, many ways of thinking will
also disappear.
   Second, as computers replace teachers, the certainty of computer programs
will replace the subtlety of student-teacher interaction.  I am not saying
that all teachers are better than computers for all subjects at all times.
It's just that something goes on among humans that is definitely not present
in human-machine relationships.
   Third, replacing teachers with computers will create an ominous uniformity
of knowledge.  Corporations already provide a vast amount of "educational
materials" to schools; when they also provide the computer programs that kids
interact with, especially in the absence of a mitigating human presence, they
pave the way to an officially sanctioned, unified field of knowledge.  That
field will be narrower than present (though perhaps deeper in a few areas,
such as science), and it will be consistent with corporate values.

4.  SURVEILLANCE

In terms of everyday life, the greatest danger of computers may be the level
of surveillance they make possible.  Computers have enabled the major
institutions of our society -- corporations, government agencies, the
police, the military -- to keep records well beyond what was previously
possible.  New York Times reporter David Burnham's splendid book _The Rise
of the Computer State_ covers this subject thoroughly...
   Burnham offers the example of TRW Corporation, which holds in its
computers the credit records of 120 million Americans.  These reveal where
you bank, how much money you have, w hat your income is, how much you owe,
what you own, where you shop, how much you spend, who your dependents are,
whether or not you have a criminal record, how well you pay bills, where you
work and live, your telephone number, your social security number, and the
names of the rest of your family.
   The medical Information Bureau has files on about 20 million Americans.
Metromail, a direct-mail ad agency, has files on about 74 million Americans.
AT&T has a similar number.  ..
   ... The federal government is not to be outdone by the private sector.
Every year government officials collect about four billion separate records
about the people of the United States-- an average of seventeen records per
person.  Most of these files are held by the FBI, CIA, and NSA, which share
interlocking networks with local police and private security agencies.  You
and your organization are surely included.
   What's more, only one or two remaining laws restrict these police and
government agency networks from interlocking their data with your social
security file, your phone number, your zip code, your IRS records, your
employer, your bank accounts, your insurance, and all the private records now
held by corporations.  And soon, the interlock will be able to include your
own dear home computer, the one that makes you "free."
   Thus far, civil libertarians have held the line against meshing all these
identification systems into one omniscient central computer file.  But these
are the years that people get elected for trashing the ACLU.


5. THE RATE OF ACCELERATION

... In our society, speed is celebrated as if it were a virtue in itself.
And yet as far as most human beings are concerned, the acceleration of the
information cycle has only inundated us with an unprecedented amount of
data, most of which is unusable in any practical sense.  The true result has
been an increase in human anxiety, as we try to keep up with the growing
stream of information.  Our nervous systems experience the acceleration more
than our intellects do.  It's as if we're all caught at a socially approved
video game, where the information on the screen comes faster and faster as
we try earnestly to keep up.
   Video games are in fact a great example of this...
   ... A skillful video-game player stimulates the computer program to go
faster, and as the cycle (computer program to nervous system to hands to
machine to computer program) speeds up, the player and the machine become
connected in one fluid cycle; aspects of each other.  Over time, and with
practice, the abilities of the human being develop to approximate the
computer program.  Evolution is furthered by this sort of interaction, but
this is a notably new form of evolutionary process.  Where evolution once
described an interaction b etween humans and nature, evolution now takes
place between humans and human artifacts.  We coevolve with an environment
_we_ have created; we coevolve with our machines, with ourselves. It's a
kind of in-breeding that confirms that nature is irrelevant to us.
   Video games.  Television. Computers....  They are all part of an
acceleration process that spins our lives faster and faster, making it seem
more exciting when it actually is only hyperactive.

6.  CENTRALIZATION

   ... computers have the look of small-scale democratic technology.  People
have them at home and find them empowering for themselves and their
organizations.  They are helpful in many ways an offer considerable personal
control...
   Small social and political groups find computers valuable for information
storage, networking, processing mailing lists, preparing clean copy,
maintaining membership lists, keeping accounts, and so on.  Yet all this begs
the question.  The real issue is not whether computers can benefit you or
your group; the question is who benefits most from the existence of computers
in society?  The answer suggests that, for all of their small scale benefits,
the largest institutions have far mo re to gain, and they know it.
   The computer invasion was not engineered by a group of high-minded
technological do-gooders determined to further democracy.  Though computers
were first invented in the 1920s, it was the American and British military
that first put them to serious use, as guidance systems for missiles during
World War II.  Two decades later, IBM converted that technology to
big-business uses.  It wasn't until the 1970s that Atari and Apple launched
the campaigns to put a computer into every home and schoolroom.  Do-gooders
didn't hit a plastic key until the mid-1970s, when the military and the large
corporations had already integrated them deeply into their operations, with
great benefit and greater geographical reach for centralized operations.
   Computer technology is an intrinsic part of an advanced technical
infrastructure; computers could only have emerged from a society already very
far down a technical pathway.  They are very costly to manufacture... and
some of their optimum uses, such as high-speed computation and satellite
mapping of resources, are so costly that they are only available to the
largest institutions.
   Computers serve the economies of scale in the same way as other recently
developed technologies, such as satellite communications, mechanical
agriculture, robotics, pesticides.
 The larger the enterprise, the more computers it can afford... As a result,
larger businesses gain a comparative advantage.  Though small businesses
benefit from using computers, larger institutions benefit far more, since the
scale and complexity and reach of operations that computers facilitate
require much greater financial resources.
   Consider the role of computers for international banks and conglomerates.
Moving money instantaneously from one market to another, feeding development
here and there, the multinational institutions today could simply not operate
as they do without computers in a satellite linkup.  Computers have enabled
these institutions to suddenly expand into a dimension never before possible.
They are beyond multinational now; they are truly global.  The accelerated
pace at which forests are felled in Indonesia and Borneo, oceans are mined in
the Pacific, and dams are built throughout the world, reflects the increased
ability of corporations to operate from a central management and still
influence daily activities in all corners of the planet.
   It is profoundly naive for people who work to prevent planetary
devastation to speak of the computer as if it were neutral; as if it were
useful for decentralization as it is to centralized development interests.
Large institutions that seek the latter benefit far more than the do-gooders
who plan to use computers for a high-tech jiujitsu.  It is only
misunderstanding the big picture, and a certain conceit, that allows us to
think any other way.  Environmentalists, bioregionalists, and other
progressive activists would be better off realizing that for all the little
benefits they offer us, computers set our movements back.  We ought to begin
dealing with them as an urgent environmental and political issue in
themselves.

7.  WORST CASE SCENARIO - AUTOMATIC COMPUTER WARFARE

   It was possible to annihilate the world before the invention of computers,
but it was far more difficult and much less likely.  The invention of the
computer instantly changed the speed at which war could be waged, the scale
of its impact, and the quantity of destruction.
   Computer technology has already produced an unprecedented degree of
military centralization.  Generals sitting in an underground war room
somewhere outside of Washington can, in one moment, observe the position and
readiness of all U.S. military hardware...
   ... In fact, managing warfare now resembles playing a giant video game --
following electronic blips on a massive screen -- abstract, cerebral, removed
from direct involvement.
 One could argue that this manner of waging war makes war more likely, since
it separates humans from the consequences of their actions, unlike ground
action, where you put bayonets through people's bodies and watched them
bleed.
   When enemy forces are reduced to blips on a video screen, impossible to
verify by direct observation, there is a far greater chance of error.  In one
eighteen-month period ending June 30, 1980, U.S. strategic forces experience
151 "false alarms," five of which were significant enough put our forces on
"alert" status.  In several of the cases, the "alert" as in response to
flights of birds.  In one case, it was the rising moon.
   This problem of computer error in a military context is one of the main
concerns of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), a group
of Silicon Valley corporate executives, programmers, and engineers who are
concerned about the military potentials of computers.
   According to CPSR, "In all but the simplest programs, hidden design flaws
can persist, sometimes for years, even though the system appears to work
perfectly. . . . There exist no known methods for eliminating this
uncertainty in complex computer programs. . . . No amount of testing under
simulated conditions can replace the the testing that comes from embedding
the system in the actual environment for which it was designed [in this case,
nuclear war]. . . . "
   CPSR argues that computer error can only be mitigated by human
intervention.  What makes the current military-computer collaboration so
terrifying is that the computers have reduced the time available for
decision-making to the point where it is now virtually automatic; humans are
nearly out of the loop. ...



CAN WE BLAME COMPUTERS?

The big question is this: Is it fair to blame computers for any or all of the
above scenarios?  Most people, even those who see the relationship between
computers and increased destructive potential, consider the computers
themselves to be harmless.  Value free. Neutral.  "People invent the
machines," is the common wisdom.  "People program them, people push the
buttons."
   And yet, it is a simple fact that if there were no computers, the process
of waging war would be much more drawn out, with a lot more time for human
beings to change their minds or seek alternatives.  It is only because
computers _do_ exist that a virtually automatic, instant worldwide war,
involving total annihilation, even enters the realm of possibility.  So, can
we say that computers are to blame?
   It is also a fact that if computers somehow totally disappeared, the world
would be instantly safer.  Even if atom bombs continued to exist, they would
no longer have effective delivery systems.  Pakistan could still drop an
atomic bomb on India, but the presently envisioned, all-out nuclear war,
which quite possibly extinguish the human species, would be impossible.

* * * 

I know that this is a difficult position to accept.  Critics call it throwing
the baby out with the bath water.  Just because computers are integral to
modern systems of nuclear annihilation, does that mean we must rid ourselves
of computers?  I am not sure, but I think so.
   This society upholds a fierce technological idealism.  We believe we can
get the best from a given technology without falling into the worst-case
scenarios of the sort described above.  We maintain this idealism despite the
fact that we have no evidence of technology ever being used at an optimal
level, or even being sensibly controlled...  Most technologies are actually
deployed in the manner that is most useful to the institutions that gain from
their use; this may have nothing to do with public or planetary good...
   Of all possible beneficiaries, the military benefits most from computers.
Computers mean more to the military that they ever will to you and me, or to
educators, or even to corporations and banks, although they run a close
second.  And of all the world-altering implications of computers, the
military-computer collaboration is the most potentially devastating.
   The possibility of computer-directed, instantaneous, worldwide holocaust
is not theoretical.  Every military in the world has attached itself to
computers, and all military strategies are computer based.  The programs are
written, the computers are ready to act.  In the face of this reality, to
speak of computers helping you to edit your copy or run your little business
seems a bit absurd.

oops.  i mistyped, what i meant to say was "chlorpromazine."  of
course, they recommend intramuscular injections.  ouch.

what with all the disinformation and misinformation flying around, i
thought you all might like to see the original prospectus published
by the Sandoz corporation when they were selling lsd under the trade
name delysid as a mental therapy medication...

	Delysid (LSD 25)
	D-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate

    Sugar-coated tablets containing 0.025 mg. (25 microg.)  Ampoules
    of 1 ml. containing 0.1 mg. (100 microg.) for oral administration

    The solution may also be injected s.c. or i.v. The effect is
    identical with that of oral administration but sets in more
    rapidly.

	PROPERTIES

    The administration of very small doses of Delysid (1/2-2
    microg./kg. body weight) results in transitory disturbances of
    affect, hallucinations, depersonalization, reliving of repressed
    memories, and mild neurovegetative symptoms. The effect sets in
    after 30 to 90 minutes and generally lasts 5 to 12 hours. However,
    intermittent disturbances of affect may occasionally persist for
    several days.

	METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION

    For oral administration the contents of 1 ampoule of Delysid are
    diluted with distilled water, a 1% solution of tartaric acid or
    halogen-free tap water.

    The absorption of the solution is somewhat more rapid and more
    constant than that of the tablets.

    Ampoules which have not been opened, which have been protected
    against light and stored in a cool place are stable for an
    unlimited period. Ampoules which have been opened or diluted
    solutions retain their effectiveness for 1 to 2 days, if stored in
    a refrigerator.

	INDICATIONS AND DOSAGE

    a) Analytical psychotherapy, to elicit release of repressed
       material and provide mental relaxation, particularly in anxiety
       states and obsessional neuroses.

       The initial dose is 25 microg. (1/4 of an ampoule or 1 tablet).
       This dose is increased at each treatment by 25 microg. until
       the optimum dose (usually between 50 and 200 microg.) is found.
       The individual treatments are best given at intervals of one
       week.

    b) Experimental studies on the nature of psychoses: By taking
       Delysid himself, the psychiatrist is able to gain an insight
       into the world of ideas and sensations of mental patients.
       Delysid can also be used to induce model psychoses of short
       duration in normal subjects, thus facilitating studies on the
       pathogenesis of mental disease.

       In normal subjects, doses of 25 to 75 microg. are generally
       sufficient to produce a hallucinatory psychosis (on an average
       1 microg./kg. body weight). In certain forms of psychosis and
       in chronic alcoholism, higher doses are necessary (2 to 4
       microg./kg.  body weight).


	PRECAUTIONS

    Pathological mental conditions may be intensified by Delysid.

Well, the Mac does crash -- as a result of a fairly bogus OS running fairly
bogus applications.  But I could say the same thing about other computers I
use daily.  There's a real scary bug in the NCR SVR4 C compiler's optimizer
that causes if-then statements to evaluate their conditions incorrectly.

Yeah, all you have to do is use the handy C compiler that comes with your Mac,

II'm NOT saying we shouldn't call 911.  Like I said it shouldn't have goten
to taht point in the first place.  You, geoffw, are the LAST person I'm
addressing with this - you have consistantly worked to make the scene safe
while others just dance or worse, stand there and stare.  I'd have probably
done the same thing in those situations.  I'm not criticizing the past, I'm
addressing the future.  We can't let things like this keep happening or as
you pointed out, someone will die.  Then there will be no going back.


Also - yesterday I talked to someone from HEAR [a nonprofit which gives free
hearing tests and hands out earplugs etc]  Their main focus has been rock
concerts, especially Metal, but they are aware of the rave scene and
interested, but have no contact.  I'm planning to pick up some earplugs from
them soon [hopefully Satuurday] to give out.

   Yea, but have you ever had a serious niacin flush?  I ended up
getting a good dose of niacin by accident one time (My mom was taking
it to reduce blood pressure), and I was tortured by the flush for
hours (It feels like itching powder).  Aspirin does help reduce the
effects of the flush tho.
   If niacin is taken every day in increasing amounts up to the full
dose (?), then the flush does go away.

Maybe niacin (and aspirin to reduce the flush) might not be a bad
thing to keep around tho.


   On another note, Somebody mentioned the Mondo "Users Guide," but
nobody mentioned what is in the back of the book.  In the Directory
("The Shopping Mall") under House Music they list "Rave Bulletin
Board: sfraves@soda.berkeley.edu".  To bad they didn't get the
"-request" part in there.
   As for the rest of the book, is it just me, or does it seem like if
you've read most of the 7 issues of Mondo, that you've already read
the book.  Luckily I didn't buy it, but I really didn't see any new
info.  Sure it's organized and maybe a good reference, but they could
have updated or expanded on some of the stuff.   Hardly a word is
mentioned about current Techno/house music.  While there are pages on
Hip-Hop and Industrial (Not entirely accurate at that).

Niacin is one of the B vitamins.  A few grams are required to cool out, but
this much straight niacin will make the capillaries in your skin expand,
causing itching and flushing.  The niacinimide form does not have this side
effect.

Subject: Giving people on bad trips medicine


	Two reasons why we shouldn't (and nobody really should...) give
someone who's having a really bad trip _anything_:

	1) It's health threatening (After the Adv. First Aid course,
	60+ hours total, and a wife who's an amateur pharmacologist
	and drug effects person, I _still_ don't feel comfortable
	with diagnosing somemone's actual drug problem even if
	they tell me what they thought they had).  The wrong "cure"
	can be very, very bad.  You want to kill someone by accident?

	2) It's illegal.  Administering any medication to anyone under
	any circumstance requires at least an EMT to be legal.  You can
	give someone some medicine and suggest that they take it, but they
	have to be the one to take it.

	The way I look at it, there are two levels of drug problem reactions.
The first level is mild psychological reaction, i.e. "bad trip" or whatever
you want to call it.  This is best dealt with by talking to someone,
calming them down, etc.  An extreme psychological reaction or any
physical reaction means get them professional help, fast.  While the
drugs the rave scene are into are less likely to end up in the second
category, if someone _does_ end up that bad off, you're deluding yourselves
if you think you can help.  I know I can't, and I've got more medical
background than most of you.  I've talked people down before, but I've
also called 911.  Know when to do that.

Just a warning - if you have to take niacin to come down off of whatever drug
youare on - becareful... because some people can have very serious reactions to
an OD on niacin - more serious than a bad trip.  If you have to use
it - check with a doctor or something.

DOn't know if niacinimide has the same effect.

Good point! Although I "use" the state0of-the-art graphics hardware/software
for a living, I don't depend on it. The Mac should only be used as
an extention of our traditional design tools. Remember! It's a tool.
The problem with all the rave flyers is the designers are letting the
tools design the flyers for them.

	Okay, from the looks of things here it seems that what could
really be useful is some sort of pamphlet, written by an MD or someone
Who Knows What's Up (tm), that could be handed out at raves to teach people
what they would need to do in a situation like the ones we've seen.  The
flyer shouldn't attempt to be the final authority on what to do, but it
should give some reasonable guidelines.  I think it should emphasize 
talking someone down rather than giving them a chemical, and that calling
911 is ULTIMATELY the best thing to do even if the tripper is paranoid 
about it.  It could even give guideline about what sort of vitamins to
carry, the DANGERS and myths about other chemicals, etc.  The goal would
be to give the AVERAGE raver some concepts of what they should do when
they see someone passed out on the floor or swimming in the ocean.  Even
if there were an army of MD's at an event, they can't be everywhere
noticing everyone.  Part, if not the root, of the house vibe is caring 
for others - this flyer would give them the power of knowing that what 
they're doing is the Right Thing when they are faced with that sort of
situation.  

	Also, I've been reading alt.drugs for several months now, and I
think the consensus there is that chlorpromazine (sp?), whose brand name
is Thorazine, is not something to give someone dosed on LSD, even
though that's what Sandoz suggested.  Supposedly the tranquilizer creates
a vegetative state which could hasve very bad psychological consequences.
(I believe Lamont G basically says it's exactly the WRONG thing to give
someone on a bad trip).

0   Introduction to the FAQ

	Raves are, if anything, the ultimate subjective experience.  Your
perception of how well or how badly a rave "goes off" is based at least
70% on your state of mind (and depending on the circumstances, 100%).  
Therefore, it's impossible to create an FAQ which is entirely objective.
I'll do my best.  I am MORE than happy to incorporate other's suggestions
into the FAQ, to include dissenting opinions and statements, within reason.
This file is not the be-all and end-all of rave culture; many of the topics
here will simply be introductions to the subject and point to the little
rave FTP site I've created at soda.berkeley.edu under /pub/sfraves (named
for and housing the archive of the sfraves mailing list, a description of
which will follow).  There's simply TONS of stuff there.  And for the rest
of the document, whenever I refer to "the ftp site", I mean soda.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1   What is a "rave"?

	The term "rave" has been overused almost to the point of losing
its meaning.  The word has always meant (according to webster:)

>1. rave \'ra-v\ vb [ME raven] 1a: to talk irrationally in or as if in 
>   delirium 1b: to declaim wildly 1c: to talk with extreme enthusiasm 2: to 
>   move or advance violently : STORM : to utter in madness or frenzy - rav.er 
>   
>2. rave n often attrib  1: an act or instance or raving 2: an extravagantly 
>   favorable criticism

	In current practice, a "rave" usually refers to a party, usually
all night long, open to the general public, where loud "techno" music is
mostly played and many people partake in a number of different chemicals,
though the latter is far from necessary.  The number of people at the
event is unimportant; it can range from 50 people to 25,000 people.  The
cost of attendance is also unimportant - there have been good raves and bad 
raves at both ends of the cost spectrum (though in practice, the higher the
price, the more commercial the event, and the lower the quality).  At a
rave, the DJ is king - he controls the psychic voyages of the dancers through
his choice in hard-to-find music and his skill in manipulating that music,
sometimes working with just a set of beats and samples, into a tapestry of
mindbending music.  A large part of the concept of raves is built upon 
sensory overload - a barrage of audio and very often visual stimuli are
brought together to elevate people into an altered state of physical or
psychological existence.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5 The "House Vibe"

	The actual concept of raves is not new - it is as old as time itself.
As the base level, raves are very comparable to American Indian religious
ceremonies, i.e. pow-wows, and also to the concept of the Shaman in Eskimo
and Siberian society - where music is the key towards pulling oneself into a
unique emotional and psychological state, a state in which one experiences
washes of sensations and visions, not delusions, but visions.  Sounds very
hokey in print, but I'm sure MANY of you out there know what I'm talking
about.  The hypnotisizng effect of techno music coupled with the seemless
transitions and themic progressions of rave DJ's as the night progresses
can be QUITE intoxicating, resulting in what could be closely compared to a 
religious experience.  Music in general has always been able to sweep
people off their feet, but what distinguishes raves are the concept of
the _shared_ experience; a feeling of unity often arises, and people are
open and friendly to one another.  There is a loss of that "attitude"
that is omnipresent in normal clubs and even in life in general.  People
are celebrated for who they are, not what they aren't.  There are many
better ways to explain the above, and more than a few can be found at the
FTP site.

For a better, blow-by-blow description of what an actual rave is like,
please check the FTP site under the media/ directory, and get "image" - 
it's an article that appeared in the SF Examiner in February 1992, and
is perhaps one of the most comprehensive surveys of the rave scene ever
to appear in print.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2   What is "techno music"

	Opinions on this vary greatly, but there are a few ways to
distinguish techno from other types of music.  Overall, techno is
denoted by its slavish devotion to _the_beat_, the use of rhythm as
a hypnotic tool.  It is also distinguished by being primarily, and
in most cases entirely, created by electronic means.  It is also
noted for its lack of vocals in most cases.  Techno also usually
falls in the realm of 115-160BPM.  There are of course exceptions 
to every one of these rules, but these guidelines seem to survive the
"what about..." test most of the time.

	There has also been a significant use of samples in techno
songs, samples lifted in huge blocks and contributing a large share
to a song's popularity.  This can be both bad ("Theme to Seseme Street"
in Smart E's "Seseme's Treet") to good (Star Trek transporters sampled
in Eden Transmission's "I'm So High", giving YOU that transporting
feeling) to great (Tears for Fears sampled in Orbital's "Moebius").
This sampling has generated much controversy, and it is the opinion
of the author and many others that sampling is okay as long as the
sample is not the whole song; "Seseme's Treet" might be an okay song, 
but if you take away the sample (which was lifted verbatim from the
TV show), you don't have much of a song left.

	Techno music has matured rapidly into several different types.

a. House

	House music is where it all began, when Chicago DJ's started
playing around with their Kraftwerk 12"'s with their soul records, and
a brand new object called a DRUM MACHINE which they discovered they
could use in their set.  The steady and clean sound of the house rhythm
coupled with uplifting soul vocals gave "house parties" an incredible
energy.  Please see "jackshouse" on the ftp site for a good example of
the mindset of this time...  house music is still around, in fact it
is still the dominant sound in San Francisco.  House also uses more
piano riffs and generally sounds "happier" than most other forms of
techno.

Good Sampler:  House Hallucinations Pump Up the World Vol. 1


b. Acid-House

	Acid-house developed when the Roland 303 and similar drum machines
came out producing the "funky worm" - that VERY distinctive sound (see any
"Acid Mix" of any song) that just *sounds* liquid (sorry, that's the best
way I can describe it).  The sound and the style is linked to use of LSD,
but many people (myself included) claim to feel many of the same sensations
while listening to acid-house music. 

Good Sample:  Maurice - This is Acid (Rhythm Stick remix)


c. Hardcore

	The energy building in these parties started getting stronger, and
people found comfort in faster, harder-pounding rhythms.  As the "rave"
progressed from small outdoor setup and small indoor clubs to warehouses,
the hardcore sound started appealing to a greater number.  The best way
I've heard hardcore described is Metallica on E - take away their guitars
and real drums and replace it with synths and drum machines.  Hardcore is
designed to get your body moving by activating your adrenalin (like punk) 
rather than endorphins(?) (like house).  Hardcore has brought a lot of the
metal-crowd into dance music, and also reconciled dance parties with the
industrial crowd as well.

Good Sample:  LA Style - James Brown Is Dead (okay, I KNOW this is the
	most played-out song in the WORLD, but the rhythm and energy is
	undeniable)
	Also check out: Aphex Twin - Digeridoo


d. Breakbeat

	Breakbeat is symbolized by the use of sped-up hip-hop beat samples.
Very often reggae tunes and influence are brought in, to good effect too
since most reggae is around 65-80bpm and most breakbeat techno about twice
that.  Breakbeat is very effective at getting the crowd moving, but its
hypnotic effects are somewhat less.

Good Sample: Most of anything on Risin' High records.


e. Ambient

	The genre is much better described in Mike Brown's Ambient FAQ
available from the ftp site.  Basically ambient (or ambient house) is
designed to lull your mind through more soothing rhythms and samples.
Sorta like new age music with an beat.  

Good Sample: _Anything_ by the Orb.


f. Trance

	Very similar to both ambient and acid-house, trance is softer on
the ears and body than most techno, but still keeps you dancing (unlike
most ambient, where the effects are more profound if you SIT DOWN and 
listen).  It's designed to try and take you, literally, into another
world.  

Samples speak louder than words: Eden Transmission - "I'm So High" on
	Exist-Dance.  GET IT NOW.


g. Tribal

	Tribal is denoted by exactly that - rhythm patterns and sounds 
which closely mimic Third-World and Native American and other "World
Music" styles.  The connection between modern-day raving and ancient
musical and cultural rituals is thus established, and the dancer can
be transported to a more primal self (in theory).

Good samples: Studio X - Los Kings Del Mambo
	      808 State - Repo Reaper	


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3   DJing

	The art of DJing has come full swing in the world of the rave,
where the DJ has replaced the live musician as the focal point for an event.
The DJ is now regarded at the "conducter" of his "orchestra" of two 
turntables and a mixer (and maybe a sampler, but that's not necessary).
The orchestra's "instruments" are the slabs of vinyl (or aluminum & plastic,
in Pete Ashdown's case) that carry the basic grooves and melodies, and it's
up to the DJ to ensure that the orchestra plays all their instruments in
perfect sync and with a measure of continuity.  The DJ must *know* his
music, know where the breaks are, know the keys, know the BPM's, to make
his/her set come out as perfect as possible.  Anyone who says DJ'ing is
just spinning records has never tried to do so.  DJs often develop a
following, and the level of devotion among some is something unseen since
the Beatles.  (Basically, if you have Garth playing at your event in San
Francisco, you can ensure 2000 people will be there, even with VERY minimal 
flyering - the same holds for Barry Weaver or Doc Martin in LA, or Adam X
on the East Coast)

	Right now information on how to mix is vaporware - if someone would
like to contribute something I'd be glad to add it.  All I can say is that
DJ'ing is one of those things that cannot be taught, it can only be learned
by doing, by sitting in front of a pair of turntables for a few months and
getting a feel for a pair of 1200's and a mixer, and knowing your records
well enough to know where the breaks are, which ones are fast and which are
slow, etc.  Develop a style.  Don't worry about doing fancy hip-hop 
transformations at first (and hardly anyone does that anymore, anyways)
Work on beatmatching - a well beat-matched 90-second segue will always
sound better than a stop-one-start-the-other mix.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4   Drugs/Smart drinks

	Currently vaporware... waiting for submissions (as I am truely
ignorant)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5   The visuals

	Visual effects are one of the most important parts of the rave,
but not always essential.  Sometimes the best parties have only a strobe
light, if even that much.  On the other end of the spectrum are the 
200-ft wide, screens drenched with projection, the 10-watt green lasers
bouncing off the disco balls giving the effect of laser rain, the miles
of flourescent tubing, the computer graphics which can blow your mind
away... it's a very large part of the "mindfuck" factor of raves.  

	Live visuals have been used since the 60's at concerts, using
overhead projectors and oil-and-water setups.  Those are sometimes still
used - and rotating color wheels in front of the projection beam can 
really add to the overall "trippyness".

	Strobes - $19.99 at yer local Radio Shack.  Cheap, but effective.
"Mind Machines" are seldom much more than small strobes with varying 
speeds that you wear inside glasses - but the effect of stroboscopic
light near the refresh speed (or half your refresh speed, or a quarter,
etc) of your eye can be quite hallucinatory.

	Computer graphics - there are a couple of programs available
as freeware over the net that would be right at home at a rave.  One is
called Fractint, available at the usual big MS-DOS archives, that draws
fractals and can color-cycle them.  VERY trippy.  A less-well known
feature of Fractint is the ability to take ANY GIF and color-cycle it,
which is DEFINITELY trippy (try a rose). Another one is called
"Acid Warp", available at the FTP site, which is less user-controllable
but very pleasant nonetheless.  Both run solely on DOS machines - if
anyone is aware of freeware autonomous graphics programs for the Mac
or Amiga, let me know.  The "big guys" all seem to really like Amigas - 
I see Digital Media truck them out at every rave I go to.  Various
companies have sprung up developing "mindfuck" videos for raves - one
amongst them being Hyperdelic Video.  They combine everything from 
cartoons to computer graphics to video feedback, and edit them together
in a frantic pace, often at 135 bpm so as to closely match the music.
Sometimes they will bring in a live mixing board and edit the videos
real-time.  Advances in projection technology have also helped bring 
the imagery to remote locations - a new single-tube projector from Sharp
is extremely compact and lightweight and can be set up outside, just 
about anywhere.

	If you are looking to arrange your own visuals for an event,
I suggest you make ANOTHER trip to Radio Shack and pick up "The Mind's
Eye", a fantastic collage of computer graphics, in the $25 range.
Absolutely incredible looking.

Hey... I LIKE that song!

Why is Live 105 playing techno at all???  Most of the DJ's flick raves a bunch 
of crap ('Yeah, I went to ALL the raves, but I got tired of listening to the 
same song for 6 hrs' --- Big Rick Stewart (tm)  'Me too, after I got tired of
all that ecstacy' --- morning geek, don't remember his name)

They also play the EXACT SAME SET of mixed songs a few times a week... so
much for 'live' 105.  Stella gets pretty old.

There was an article on the front page of today's Chronicle about raves...it
wasn't all that bad.  

Well, back to work...

-Howard

p.s.  Is it just me or are the only people who call MDMA ecstacy anymore 
the press?  It was all over the chron article a couple of days ago...

Subject: ???

The one thing that I haven't seen mentioned in all of the drug antidote/cross-reaction
talk is that drug allergies are just as dangerous and just as common.  Consider this
my vote against administering drugs to people.  I think it's interesting conversation
when taken out of the context of giving these drugs to others.  Maybe people that are
into it enough can make there own little "come down kits" but it seems like the type
of people with the knowledge and forsight to do something like this would be the type
of people to be less likely to have to use it.

Anyone out there know what "Trance Formation" (at Atlantis) or
Juice (at DV8) might be like?  the Trance Formation phone msg
advertises massage; do these promoters tend to deliver or is
it just the usual 50,000 boomin' watts o' shiatsu power;
mind-melting doormen for your body, mind, & soul....? 
None of the DJ's sound familiar, but in my case that doesn't mean much.

Well, I suppose I can guess about Juice,
but I thought Fri night at Atlantis was called "Torpedo"
and was not especially. a rave.

Because their demographics tell them that they should pick one big techno hit
and overplay it to death, and that beyond that they should stick to overplaying
REM clones and Jesus and the Mary Chain wannabes.  (And the DJs don't have much
to do with selecting the music, so their opinions aren't worth a whole lot.)

Live 105 has trademarked the phrase "modern rock".  (Really, I'm not making
this up).

OK, I got a flyer on this one...  and they are advertising FREE BEER!!!!
I'm sorry, I just can't see that as a good thing at a rave.  Fog Zone is
totally wierd... they have 2 hardkisses, one moonpup and one bones and 
infinite free beer.  I may go just to see what it's like to have a bunch

(unfortunately I only have a radio in the kitchen)--
That _fucking rad_ song (you could turn the sun to purple, you could make
the sea turn turtle, but you know you could never make me love you more...
etc/etc.) that they spin, in a Bop-dance version.  AAaack!  First Messiah,

The drugs weren't played up too much, the guy seemed to have talked to a lot

BUT
i wish it hadn't been on the front page--why do we need any more publicity like that?   it's articles like that that tend to cause bad things (ie. the Newark

that was the guy who chatted w/ a bunch of us during the summer.
nice guy - but only heard the answers he wanted to shape... granted,
most are like that, and at the very least he's rave positive (which
is actualy a lot). anyway, front page is fine w/ me - but i really
don't think as a group we're going anywhere. and i think the 60's
were hyped. if you look at all those woodstock fotos, where are the
more than occassional images of races hangin together? - it was
until recently, that motown (a rather parallel development as
hippies and woodstock) achieved cross-over status. the whole big
chill thing was a myth that they or the people from the coors
commercials sat around appreciating african-american music or that
african-americans were going out of there way to appreciate cream.
this is, of course, a generalization - but one i feel is more
directly linked to the times than peace and love. i went to rock the

                            DREAM MUSIC
                           La Monte Young

In Dream Music there is a radical departure from European and even much
Eastern music in that the basis of musical relationship is entirely
harmony.  Not European harmony as textbooks have outlined it, but the
intervallic proportions and acoustical consequences of the particular
ratios which sound concomitantly in the overtone series when any simple
fundamental is produced.  Melody does not exist at all (The Disappearance
of Melody) unless one is forced to hear the movement from group to group
of various simultaneously sounded frequencies derived from the overtone
series as melodic because of previous musical conditioning.  Even before the
first human moved sucessively from one frequency to another (melody if you
like) a pattern for this movement, that is the relationship of the second
frequency was already predetermined (harmonically) by the overtone structure
of the fundamental of the first sound.  And in the life of the Tortoise the
drone is the first sound.  It lasts forever and cannot have begun but is 
taken up again from time to time until it lasts forever as continuous sound
in Dream Houses where many musicians and students will live and execute a
musical work.  Dream Houses will allow music which, after a year, ten years,
a hundred years or more of constant sound, would not only be a real living
organism with a life and tradition all its own but one with a capacity to
propel itself by its own momentum.  This music may play without stopping
for a thousand years, just as the Tortoise has continued for millions of
years past, and perhaps only after the Tortoise has again continued for as
many million years as all of the Tortoises in the past will it be able to 
sleep and dream of the next order of tortoises to come and of ancient tigers
with black fur and omens the 189/98 whirlwind in the Ancestral Lake Region
only now that our species has had this much time to hear music that lasted
so long because we have just come out of a long quiet period and we are just
remembering how long sounds can last and only now becoming civilized enough
again that we want to hear sounds continuously.  It will become easier as 
we move further into this period of sound.  We will become more attached to 
sound.  We will be able to have precisely the right sounds in every 
dreamroom playroom and workroom, further reinforcing the integral proportions
resonating through structure (re: earlier Architectural Music), Dream Houses
(shrines, etc.) at which performers, students, and listeners may visit even
from long distances away or at which they may spend long periods of
Dreamtime weaving the ageless quotients of the Tortoise in the tapestry of
Eternal Music.

That's an odd way of putting it.  The Detroit pioneers (May, Saunderson,
Atkins) freely acknowledge having been influenced by Kraftwerk,
whose work predated them by at least 7 years (mid 70's vs. '82).

Then in the '79 - '81 era there was what I'd consider a _movement_
stemming from a mixture of Kraftwerk and post-punk; the early
Mute label (remember the original Warm Leatherette?), Yello, stuff
like Thomas Leer/Robert Rental ,etc.  And how about Throbbing Gristle?

Oh, heavens, this looks like it's going to be a _long_ thread.  Ok, I'll try
to be nice.

First, I'm not saying that everyone should stop saying techno because it's
technorave.  If it's called techno, it's called techno.  Particularly
since it is typically used in some limited context, I think we can communicate
just fine.

My main point is that techno comes from somewhere.  It was not invented in this
scene, nor is it particularly new.  One can easily get the impression from 
the omission of this fact that the contrary is true.  Not only is it 
responsible to acknowledge origins/sources, but other people may want to 
explore the related types of music that they might not otherwise ever 
hear about. 

It's like when you've been going to a cool nightspot for years, let's say, 
and the yuppies move in.  The first thing they say is, "there's this new
place..." (like they've just discovered it).  The second thing is that 
they start giving attitude to the old-timers because "they don't belong in 
our place."

		 'Rave' Parties Turn to Social Issues
		     (Psychedelic goes political)

By Dan Levy and T. Christian Miller, Chronicle Staff Writers

	In a cattle pasture an hour north of San Francisco recently, 2000
teenagers and young adults thrashed about in bone-chilling early-morning air
to pulsating lasers, psychedelic lights, and pounding music whose refrain
asked, "Are you ready for a brand new world?"
	The question is one of many indications that "raves" -- dance parties
mixing psychedelic images, fast-paced music, complex light shows, and a drug
called Ecstasy -- are developing a social and political outlook as they spread
across the country.
	"There is potential for a great, great movement to come out of this 
with political force," said Joel Breton, a 19-year-old who has thrown some of
the biggest raves in the Bay Area, including one in June that drew nearly 
6,000 people.  "It's beyond a nightclub.  It's more of a way of thinking and
a belief system."
	"(Raves) are about everyone being equal -- gays, lesbians, bisexuals,
blacks, whites, hispanics," said Kyle Edwards, a 23-year-old promoter who threw
a rave in August at the Concourse Exhibition Center in San Francisco.  "You can
act any way you want, dance any way you want, or dress any way you want."
	In warehouses and at water slides, in fields and forest clearings, 
three to six raves boom into the night on any given weekend in San Francisco,
Los Angeles, or New York.  A crowd of 5,000 ravers furiously pumping lithe
limbs in time to 160-beat-per-minute music is not unusual.
	Now, rather than simply throwing huge parties, many rave leaders are 
finding ways to channel that energy into something socially constructive. Some
believe that they are on the verge of a counterculture era akin to the '60s.
	There are signs that the rave movement may be heading in that
direction:
	[] A "Rave for Choice" next month in San Francisco will donate proceeds
to local abortion clinics and a national pro-choice women's group.
	[] In August, about 500 people in Boulder, Colorado attended a "Rave
for the Rainforest" benefit in the downtown Marquee club.
	[] Raves to benefit AIDS education programs have raised a total of 
$75,000 in Detroit and New York.
	[] A new San Francisco rave club called "Unleash the Queen" is designed
to combat homophobia in an election year in which gay and lesbian rights have 
become a divisive issue.
	"I have a vision where I see half a million people dancing underneath
an anti-nuclear demonstration banner," said a British-born organizer who 
manufactures rave scenes in San Francisco. [ed. - huh?]
	Like other music-fashion movements, raves started in England and were
imported to America. Since their arrival three years ago, raves have spawned 
a culture complete with rave music, rave fashion, and a philosophy reminiscent
of the hippie era.

	Comparision With Hippies

	To some observers, the hippie comparison is valid but incomplete.
"Ravers aren't as naive as the hippies," said a New York record executive
Nancy ebber, who said the rave culture reminds her of the punk movement of
the 1980's. "Punks wanted to change the world too, but they were much more
aggressive."
	But comparisons between the rave culture and hippies are inevitable.
Like hippies, ravers are young, toy with psychedelic drugs and have distinctive
fashions and music.  To some ravers, wearing costumes featuring Dr. Seuss 
cartoon characters and Swedish girl-feminist Pippi Longstocking make a 
connection to their early youth.
	Others intensify the experience by popping tablets of an amphetamine
called Ecstasy, raver's drug of choice.  Ecstasy's fans say it helps remove
social inhibitions and boosts tactile perceptions.  It does not, they say,
promote violent behavior.
	Timothy Leary, the LSD guru who urged young America to "tune in,
turn on, drop out," has turned his eye toward raves and the surrounding 
culture and a new youth movement.
	Raves "are trying to capture the spirit of the 60's" said the 71-
year-old Leary, who has thrown three or four raves himself in the Los Angeles
area.  "They're high-tech hippies."

	Style and Technology

	The two eras have a similar message of peace love, and communion with
all people.  But ravers spread it with a style and technology that mixes 
cutting-edge computer software with images as diverse as Mayan calendars, 
floral prints, and Cat in the Hat.
	Information about rave spreads by telephone, computer networks, and 
graphically complex flyers.  Rave flyers from San Diego pop up in Boulder,
Colo.  A raver in Brandywine, Md. can connect with one in Springfield, Mo.
simply by logging on to an electronic mail system.
	Raves are happening even in smaller cities in Boca Raton, Fla.  In
Kansas City, Mo., a hardware store owner who has added the latest German
record imports to his nuts-and-bolts stock is planning to throw a rave in his
store for regular customers from small towns in Missouri and Kansas.
	Until now, raves have been largely social events, gatherings where
anyone and anything is accepted.  Not everyone is eager to see them take a
political turn.

	Near Spiritual Experience

	To some ravers, politics represents an unwelcome intrusion.  They say
the real core of raves is a near spiritual experience created by hundreds of
people all listening, dancing, and sweating to the same high-energy music.
	"Some people find (enlightenment) through religion or church or 
philosophy," said Mike Regan, Edwards' partner.  "We are coming to that point
... through the dance"
	And they are doing it, they say, in a peaceful and positive way. "How
many other places do you get so many people together without fighting?" asked
20-year-old rave organizer Jason Emole.
	(Last weekend, police in Newark broke up a rowdy warehouse rave 
attended by about 500 people.  There were no arrests, but police said two
people were beaten and three people stabbed.)
	Others say debates about politics versus spirituality miss the point.
They are more interested in having a good time than levitating the Pentagon.
	"(Raves) are everybody having fun dancing together," said 19-year-old
Modesto resident Tina Medieros, standing in line at a recent rave in San 
Francisco with a belled jester's cap on her head.  "I think politics should
stay out of it."

	A Lucrative Business

	Some think that raves are just another fad that will fade as they
become too commercial.  At $20 a ticket, raves are a lucrative business that
can bring in $100,000 a night while costing $20,000 to $30,000 to throw.
Many rave fashion and music store owners are in business to expand the market
for trendy clothing, not to promote ideas of world peace and racial harmony.
	"I think they're going to get so large, they're going to collapse
under their own weight," said Rye Digre, an organizer of the Higgledy Piggledy
raves in San Francisco.
	But a man who calls himself "Mr. Floppy," promoter of some of Oakland's
biggest raves, is encouraged by the swelling numbers.  He said his vision is a
crowd of 50,000 ravers in Oakland Coliseum as part of a "global education."
	"There has to be a focus," said Christie Every, a promoter of the 
pro-choice rave who has also planned a series of Bay Area rock club dates tied
to the theme of voter registration.  "The whole mind-set is really powerful but
it's untapped."
	And Moby, a New-York based rave performer who is one of the best-known
disc jockeys on the scene right now, wants the rave culture to become more than
throbbing music and a sea of bodies.
	"There is a degree of social consciousness already, but it's a more
ambiguous thing," he said. "I'd just like to see it become a little more active
like it was in the late 60's."

I have a room of people over here that disagree.  Based on what do you make 
this assertion?  Also, in what year did this word and/or genre appear in your
opinion?  Do you refer to the coining of the term, of the genre, or both?
What characteristics of the genre do you believe are relevant to the genre 
as it exists today?  In other words, what makes it more significant as a 
source than, let's say, John Cage in the '50s?  

I'm not trying to give the third degree, but if you have something to teach
I'm very willing to learn.  Besides, we have to give Brian material.  ;-)

Oh, goodness I think this is way off.  Ministry is about as techno as
my big toe.  Further, I hardly believe they are even industrial.  Metal
maybe--with a few extra points for distorted vocals.  I don't blame you
for labelling them as such, many people mostly familiar with the mainstream
groups think so. I believe technoindustrial would better be described by 
Front Line Assembly, Contagion, Bigod 20.

I agree.  But how do you tell people what it sounds like without a label??  
"Oh, I can't give it a label.  Trust me, you'll like it."  I suppose
you can use what the band uses (if anything), come up with a neat compound
word/label or list bands with a similar name.  Labels provide a neat 
shorthand.

But that's beside the point.  The point of my original mail was not about
labels as much as it was about origins....

Oh Christ, is that paragraph flamebait or what.
Jon is likely more than just 'mostly familiar with the mainstream groups'.

Plus, if you consider some Cabaret Voltaire industrial, then you'd 
better be prepared to accept some Ministry as industrial (though not their 
latest speed-metal stuff) since 'Twitch' and 'Code' sound virtually the same.

mcg@netcom.com (MykL G) mentions the early-mid-80's Kraftwerk/Techno
"derivatives" such as Yello, Warm Leatherette, Throbbing Gristle, etc. 

Don't forget the mid-late-80's "Balearic Beat" movement in Europe,
esp.  on the Balearic Island of Ibiza, Spain -- I was in Ibiza for a
week in the summer of 1988 (went to my first raves there!) and alot of
what they were playing were souped up Yello and Kraftwerk remixes and
other forms of technified Euro-disco. There was a definite
cross-polination between "Balearic Beat" and Eeeenglish Acid House
music at the time (Balearic Beat came first, but by '88, Ibizans were
getting alot of English stuff as well). 

PS: SF Raves are alot more fun than Ibizan raves, in my opinion (and
the music is better too, esp. the tribal stuff). On the other hand, It
was damn fun dancing all night in 70-80-degree-F nighttime weather
under open white canvas canopies illuminated by lotsa lasers and
lights...  and in the morning when it was all sAid and donE, you got
to chill out by swimming in tropically warm crystal-blue waters while
watching the already-searing morning sun reflect off of the arid
hillsides covered with a bric-a-brac of ancient whitewashed buildings
jutting haphazardly into the sky. (-: this ad paid for by the ibizan
tourist bureau... :-)

A couple notes here:
  1.  I got turned away at the door.  It wasn't an all-ages event, and
I'm only 19, but, geez - lighten up.....I've never been turned away
from something like this before....
  2.  At the club there were flyers all over the ground, and they
advertised in a paper called WestWord all over the place - a lot more
than should've been necessary.  Nice waste of resources.
  3.  Since I never got in I couldn't see if they were using styrofoam
cups, but, I wouldn't doubt it considering the atittude that
pervailed...

The Marquee is  agreat club - probly the best in the Denver/Boulder
area - the only one that is serious about raves and techno every
night, other than a club called Club X which is run by the largest
rave promoters here in CO (Poor Boy productions), but, IMHO the
MArquee was not doing this out of social conscience - they made a lot
of money out of the whole thing (ticket prices jacked a *lot*, I heard
drinks were a rip and a lot of people went home to get bottled water
and snuck it in, shirts (from what I've heard) were $20+
short-sleeve)...

fine.  i'd put something in the FAQ along the lines of - "the music
heard at raves is commonly lumped under the collective name `techno'
although it bears little or no resemblance to the classic `techno'
(sometimes known as `detroit techno') made in the late 70's - early
80's.  every DJ has his or her own unique style and just because you
hear something at a rave doesn't mean it is `techno' music.  abolish
music labeling now!"

i don't know where i read it originally - i think it was in Music
Technology's 1987 "house music" issue.  my memory is spotty but i
think it had saunderson and atkins on the cover.  maybe.  it
definitely interviewed m/a/r/r/s, bomb the bass and coldcut.  while
the spotlight was on "house" there was definitely a smaller side
article on techno (call it detroit techno if it makes you feel
better.)

i have no idea what john cage has to do with it.  i've never heard any
of his stuff labeled techno.  musique concrete is usually applied to
cage.

and if you're so interested in where current rave music came from,
michael gold is quite right - you have to consider house music,
detroit techno and the acid house scene.  industrial disco has had a
small influence - more on the hardcore techno stuff (what a lot of
people are currently calling "nosebleed techno"). if you're more into
the trancy sounds, you have to consider the berlin electronic crew -
tangerine dream, klaus schulze and the rest.

[begin weirdo digression]

it was very amusing to read in mixmag update that the ultraviolet
catastrophe sampled kool and the gang and had a "leblanc-style" beat.
i can say with authority that we did NOT sample K&TG and the
"leblanc-style" beat would more properly be termed a "dangers-style
beat" since we were (or at least I was) thinking more of meat beat
manifesto than tackhead.

i could list off all the influences that mike, jeff and i took to
heart when we went to create the UVC but what point would it serve?
jeff, for instance, is heavily into the 4AD/gothic sound.  should we
call our music "gothic techno"?  i think not.  where music comes from
is interesting in a historical sense but when you're out there
dancing, do you care if it was born from detroit influences or a bunch
of pale angsters from england?  i mean, my parents are cool, but
please consider me as a separate person, not as the product of their
genetics.

kindly don't patronize me, sir.  you are showing your age.  have you
never heard "twitch"?  it's one of the all time classic industrial
dance records.  ministry's history does not begin with "the land of
rape and honey."

labels are a good starting point but nothing more.  in writing
reviews, i always wind up characterizing the various components of a
song.  unless the song is so formulaic that you can sum it up in one
word, of course.  my current favorite track, "voodoo fire," starts out
as a fast, dark acid jam and switches into tribal halfway through.
"tribal acid" doesn't really do it justice, somehow...  i'll play it
tonight and then YOU can tell me what it should be labeled as.

thanks for your support howard.  i've been in the music reviewing game
since i was a 10th grader so i tend to overreact when people go on
about labeling and such.

"twitch" and "code" sound the same because they were both produced by
adrian sherwood around 1985-1986.

cabvol's initial sound was nothing like "code" and similarly, ministry
started off doing cold wave/electrofunk before selling out and
becoming howard jones clones for one record.  weird, eh?

Inside the human brain 
exists a vast network of uncharted
territory
concealed by the subconscious
a complex array of 
images
sounds
sights
feelings
emotions
thoughts
questions
answers
to which we are oblivious from day to day
locked behind the doors of reality
the key
is in a hyperreal state
a trance
an experience
a voyage
a resolution of all things physical
 a trip
induced by factors and environments
within the bounds
of our own control
from day to day
to act not with the body
but the mind
relaxation
meditation
imagination
to release all conscious thought
and traverse the expanse of
theory
contemplation
fantasy
an alternate reality
always present
but never confronted
to see the world in a different
shade of thought
where nothing is unreasonable
impossible
unreachable
unsolvable
and for one brief moment
to realize
that everything in the world
is all in your head.

There is 
one area of concern that desperately needs to be addressed in this issue. So
many "undergrou
nd" D.J.s and publications compromise the integrity of our scene by
supporting the commercial tunes in order to gain acceptance from the many, or
produce music on the commercial tip in order to get a deal. The ravers connot
keep up with the fast flow of new music from the underground without
direction from 
the D.J.'s and publications. 
 We do everything possible to make sure we're up to date. that means lots of
last minute long nights in front of the computer before we hit the streets.
What would be the point of this publication if we charted records that were 6
months old or previously released on another label? (Attention labels: please
send information and test pressings before they are released!) The rave marks
a beautiful time in the history of the world. We are one-whoever we
are,.where ever we are. Always remember the music brought us together. The
music crossed the lines of race, gender, distance, language and hate. We love
the scene and we want it to grow, thats why we have to protect the
underground and keep the vibe alive.

I read your commentary in U1S. All I have to say is this DETROIT? QUIET? Not
only is Detroit active, we are radio active and rest assured our fallout is
coming your way. We at UNDERCURRENT REC have just released our maiden project
Q BIK MUZ in June. Not only that, we have something else for your ass... our
Q BIK MUZ Can You Feel It featuring BRIDGETTE GRACE to be released with the
quickness. Feel safe in assuming that this new release is going straight for
the jugular vein of those big bird-butt sniffing-kermit the frog-ball
licking-crayola crayon eating-techno baby wanna-bees. Furthermore, SUBURBAN
BASE could never produce REAL techno music....hardcore or oth
erwise because it takes HEART along with the ART. Not only is it a state of
mind, it's a state of affairs; henceforth a lifestyle and attitude.
Translated means: how can one claim Detroit is dead, without the wear withall
guts & balls to cross our city limits? KMS is working, UR is working, ACACIA
is working, 430 WEST is working, JUAN ATKINS is working, we are working & the
list goes on & on. It will all probably hit like a series of scud missles.
Anyway, to make a long story short, not only are we not d
ead, we aren't ever sleeping. Even if we were sleeping, we could produce a
better record than that primary regression set to wax. Suburban Base in the
name of true techno-go back to the drawing bo
ard...oh! Excuse me, the blackboard. I've seen better artistic endeavors in a
kindergarten finger
 paint session. You need to be fortified with alot more than E
vitamins....This Ain't School House Rock!
This just lets me know that we in Detroit as a whole, need to make more noise
about what we are 
doing. So our techno brethen, don't let the opposition make you lose faith in
what keeps us together.
Sincerely, Kelly@UnderCurrent Records DETROIT< MICHIGAN

DEAR UOS,
First off, thank you for taking 
the time and effort to put out your magazine. Second, the reason I'm writing
is due to the letter from Suburban Base in #6.
I met the guys from SB at the ill fated techno panel at NMS and I found them 
to be really nice, cool people. I can't quite fault them for their negative
impression of NY rave
 culture because what was on display on that panel was shameful. All this
talk of "I was doing this 
first" or "I do it better" is in my opinion, out of place in a culture that
is ideally about mutual respect and peace and coming together. We all know
how positive and wonderful rave culture can be, so then why is so much energy
spent in dissing and degrading other people? There is room for everyone 
here, and no one looks better by making someone else look bad.
I'm sorry that the guys from 
SB were so meanspirited in their letter, but instead of bashing back at them
let's do what we can to
 make our scene worthy of thier respect and admiration.
Personally, I'd like to see all of this talk of past raves and old records
put aside because, what we should be about is the future & forward thinking.
Once the glorification of the old replaces the celebration of the new, we
might as well all pack it i
n & go to a Beach Boys concert. I'd also like to see a little more
experimentation on the part of the DJs. I was at the last STORM and the
energy was great but, at times the music got samey & dull.
 Hardcore techno is great but, so is ragga, piano, trance & even straight
forward house. Don'
t be afraid to broaden your horizons.
Finally, respect to everyone who's sincere, we don't need any more techno
mercenaries. Stop fighting & start smiling.       MOBY


Since the inception of the NY rave scene (early 1991) several attempts to
cash in have been made; thanks to FRANKIE BONES, ADAM X, JIMMY CRASH & REPETE
the scene has literally exploded here in NY. These DJs have played and
supported the bes
t in underground dance music & culture. They understand the music & it's
surrounding scene.
Commercialism seems to be the scenes primary foe, and as a DJ, I refuse to
play commercial music. Although one may argue that through commercialism the
scene will be exposed to more people and hence support i
t's growth, one must also realize that commercialism exploits and drains the
scene. That is through commercialization, the scene becomes flooded, becoming
a trend to many new and uninformed persons, thereby endangering the scenes
conceptual ideology.
What ever happened to keeping it underground? When I say u
nderground, I don't neccessarily mean hidden away word of mouth outlaw
parties, although I do agree this is underground. Large, publicized events
can maintain an underground mentality if they are promoted and organized
properly. This  would involve the music they feature, and thier being
presented to
 people who understand and appreciate the scene's intended environment.
As far as cashing in on the scene, there is nothing wrong with making money,
as long as you give people what they paid for. 
If commercial events are where you are at, that's fine (I respect your
opinions and judgements as I have my own beliefs), but techno and raving are
underground concepts not intended for commercialization. Techno and raving
were meant to provide an alternative to the whole commercial aspect of dance
culture, presenting a peaceful environment and encouraging positive
interaction.
Commercialization has already turned the scene into a fasion statement. The
commercial scene is frequented by people more concerned with
 style-who's the first to sport the latest rave gear-and socializing than
with the quality of the music. Commercializing the scene with trendy clothes
and novelty records killed the scene 
in the UK; let's not let it happen to our scene. Some will argue that techno
is not the only music that should be played at a rave. I agree & have no
problem with breakbeats being played, as long as th
ey're not commercial. I still spin house and take a look at what San
Fransisco is doing, supporting mainly deep, acid, and tribal house. As far as
breakbeats are concerned, if more records were like th
e PROPHECY and (Lenny D) ENGLISH MUFFIN. I wouldn't mind playing or hearing
an entire breakbeat s
et. However, having to play "happy" commercial records to create a "happy"
atmosphere di
splays narrow mindedness.
No doubt that a commercial event may have a great vibe that put's smiles o
n everyone's faces, but a re-evaluation must occur. True, commercial music
may be more accessible and therefore effective, but underground music will
always provide insight into the future. People usually prefer to be in a
familiar environment, but progression is a direct result of change and
development. Although commercial novelty records are a sure way to excite a
young crowd, this scene far exceeds that kind of mentality. If nobody is bold
enough to support the underground, our scene will become one big stalemate,
therefore preventing the growth of true rave culture. For the future of our
scene please be receptive and open to new ideas. The least that can be done
is to give the ravers the ultimate experience and not some trendy, cool place
to be, friendly night out.
PEACE, JAMES CHRISTIAN 

DEAR HEATHER,
Thanks for the magazine I enjoyed reading it. Here are some flyers of events
that have gone past & some future events also. As you can see, the majority
of them have to do with the Hardcore BreakBeat/Ragga style. Techno events are
few & far between such as LOST and CODE RED. 
Thanks again for the zine-keep it coming.
NU
R, MIDDLESEX ENGLAND
PS From reading Suburban Base' letter to U1S, you can tell how much of a clue
they have. (ie; NONE!)

STORM R*** last Saturday was excellent! Keep up the good work. Here is my
 address in London if you ever drop by. I'm back in NY next summer.
LOVE & PEACE   REX    LAMBETH,LONDON UK

Thank you so much for the support. There are so many out there trying to
knock each other down that your attitude is refreshing. I hope you feel the
same about me & my boys.
TAKE CARE    SPIKE @ PLANE
T X-NJ

I was in attendance at the last STORM event (SEPT 19, 1992) and had a pretty
amazing time. All who were involved should be proud, it was a great
you-know-what. However I saw something that 
I really need to share with you and anyone else who might read this because
it's been bothering me ever since I got back to BOSTON. When I was in line
someone rushed in between me and the person in front of me, bent down and did
something near the fence. At first I thought he was looking for something
(lost keys, money he had dropped, whatever) and then he dashed off toward the
front of the line. I was curious as to what he was looking for and asked the
girl in front of me if she knew what it was. She mo
tioned toward the bottom of the fence and said, "he wasn't looking for
anything, he just
 wanted to put this through the fence" What she was referring to was A
FUCKING CROWBAR! This asshole realized that you folks had metal detectors,
and tried to pass his crowbar through the fence so that he could come around
and pick it up later after getting in. What the FUCK do you think he was
going to do with the thing once he got in? Stir up his smart drink? DOUBTFUL!
Anyway, I stuck my hand through the fence, grabbed the crowbar, pulled it
back through the fence and hid it in a bush. All night I was really bummed
out about that shit. What the HELL is going on? I thought these things were
supposed to be about PEACE, and everybody getting along. How many people were
actually successful in getting those wak items i
n?
Maybe this is an isolated incident, or maybe I'm just a NAIVE FUCK from
BOSTON. But eithe
r way it's something that has been bothering me and I needed to let you guys
know it happened. I'll see you at the QUEST in PROVIDENCE.
SINCERELY, BOSTON BILL        MASS

more reviews

PAT KRIMSON-FEEL IT REMIXES (2 TUFF, BELGIUM)
Three mixes of FEEL IT. My favorite is the APOCALYPSE MIX which starts out
with tribal percussion and high hats. Clocking in at around 130 bpms the
bassline creeps in under warped claps and strings. Intelligent techno by PAT
KRIMSON formerly of HYPP & KRIMSON who were responsible for such classics as
POWER PLANT. YOUR DESTINATION on the B-side is hardc
ore rave Belgium style. What I'd like to know is why the masters HYPP
(TRANSFORMER 2, 2 FABI
OLA) and KRIMSON aren't working together anymore.   HH

WINK (US)
JOSH WINK, a DJ from the Philadelphia area took it upon himself to put out
his own record. Only 900 pressed. The A-side has a very tribal feel but
clocks in at 148 bpms pitch down to -6 for maximum trance results. B-side
first cut is hardcore techno from 160 - 194 bpms very well produced but has
familiar drum patterns ripped off from MICROBOTS CHIP 2, an original acid
line and high pitched samples from THE TELLURIANS NAVIGATOR REMIX played
backwards. Side B second cut is straight up acid at 160 bpms, with sick
warped out vocal samples. The labels on this record have an original picture
but borrow the style from the old school TRANSMAT labels. If a
ny labels in Europe are interested, ring Josh on (215) 569-1227   HH

TWO FACE (EUROTRAX RECORDS, NETHERLANDS)
Killer 2 track piece from a new label called EUROTRAX, a division of NBS.
This is one of my favorites of the month. First track, SUBWAY WORLD is the
best. Lots of drum beats. Sounds like DJAX style. I recommend it.      COUSIN
SAL

DECADE (HOTTRAX, ITALY)
Out of italy comes this 4 tracker that
 is awsome. Blends elements of hardcore and acid. Great.  Sal

LA BELLA "ESPANIA" (RAVE 55, BELGIUM)
RAVE 55 is one of the best labels to come out with slamming stuff. And this
piece prove
s it GET IT!  SAL

SONIK EXPANDER  (STD, FRANCE)
Very good 2 track piece from France. 1st song E JUMP will get any dance floor
jumping. Side B TANGO LOCO has a cool piano in it mixed with a good keyboa
rd sample. Very good. SAL
GENLOG EP  VOL 1  (MUSIC MAN, BELGIUM)
This is super slamming. Will please everyone. MOCK MOON starts off like a
trance all of a sudden hardcore erupts> Side B gives you three kil
ler acid tracks that will put you in a frenzy. I love it.                   
COUSIN SAL

 DEFCON 1 (HITHOUSE RECORDS, BELGIUM
The hardest piece ever to come out on HITHOUSE. This is hardcore 100% 
gaurenteed. Play it at loud volume.                     SAL

CIRCUIT BREAKER (PROBE, US)
This 3 track piece will no doubt crack your cranium. Spasmatic, rigortating,
chronical, convulsional seizures will occur due to the effect of brain
meltdown and termination of all your neurons. 101% of annihilating, hard
core death. The best domestic record I ever heard.  SAL

EUROMASTERS "ALLES NAAR DE KL-T
E" (ROTTERDAM)
No words can describe this creation. All I can say is the best Techno song on
the bes
t Techno label. A must have.                            SAL

INTERACTIVE "ELAVATION" (WHI
TE LABEL)
My favorite song up to date by INTERACTIVE.  SAL

FINAL FRONTIER (UR, U.S.)
Out of Detroit
 comes this 3 track record with 2 tracks on side A that's acid trance style
and 1 track on side B th
at has Tribal elements.     SAL

TRANCEPORTER (SPACEMATE RECORDS, GERMANY)
SPACEMATE is a unique record label with under a dozen releases and in my
opinion already has made it strong in the Techno scene. This to me is one of
the best trance records to come out in a long time. This 3-track record
proves that 
you don't need acid or E or any other shit drug to get spaced out. Listen to
this record and
 find out how a natural pure trance high feels like.                         
             SAL 

FRA
NKIE BONES "SHOW THEM WE COULD DO THIS" (WHITE LABEL, U.S.)
FRANKIE BONES the one and only tr
ue promoter of techno in America and president of "STORM RAVE" organization
comes out with this 
kicking piece. It's kind of a tribal hardcore with killer guitar riffs that
kick you in the fa
ce. Definitely a floor stomper.                        SAL

ACID RAIN EP ( SHOCKWAVE RECORDS, U.S.)
This 7-track piece is pure sulphuric acid all the way. Your brain cells will
deteriorate after exposu
re to this acid kaos they would have to place your brain in formaldehyde in
order to save what's 
left of it.                           SAL

LEO ANIBALDI (ACV, ITALY)
In my opinion LEO ANIBALDI is a master of Techno. I love his style. Pick any
of his works and see for yourself. This piece is fantastic. Flip over to the
B-side for an attack called RITMICIOA and a chemical reaction will detonate
in your br
ain. You'll secrete brain fluid out your fucking ears. And if you really want
to go mental p
ick up his " RIDERS OF THE FUTER EP". Pure Acid! I can't wait 'til his
upcoming album co
mes out. Awesome.  SAL

DJ BOUNTY HUNTER (BONZAI RECORDS, BELGIUM)
This piece is fantastic. 3 tra
cks of non-stop hardcore. 1st song "BOUNTY HUNTER" is unbelievable. Both
tracks on side-B have n
on stop drum beats that will energize you. A must have.      SAL

Continued on page 23.
GENERAL N
OISE (ROTTERDAM)
ROTTERDAM is the purveyor of hardcore. Listen to a track called "DRUGS" and
see what I mean. ROTTERDAM RECORDS rule!!               SAL

LORDS OF ACID-I MUST INCREASE MY BUST (CAROLINE, US)
Very commercial even for the LORDS. Fortunately, there are 3 mixes by RICHIE
HAWTIN(+8). He drops all of the cheesy vocals and gets down to business. The
DISTORTION mix is great to mix with the new 
CIRCUIT BREAKER but, be sure to have the channel volume way up because it's
pressed low compared to the PROBE pressings. Also includes MNO RMX. I bet you
will just run out and buy one of those new pump up bras after hearing this.. 
                   HH

GHETTO TECH 1 (GHETTO TECH, US)
A new subsidiary of UR. Hardcore, analog gabber with 303s running rampant.
There is definitely not a bug in their disc
 drive. Get it!  HH


TODD BLACK-DESIRE (WARRIOR RECORDS, UK)
Go to the second cut on either
 side for underground tribal breakbeats.  HH

SNOWFLAKE-BACK TO BASIX (WARRIOR RECORDS, UK)
4 mix
es. From vocal to underground acid, this will please all of the people, all
of the time.   HH

BIODE
GRADABLE EP ELEKTRON (PURE BASS RECORDS, UK)
Familiar UK bassline over hard kick & breakbeat with "En
ergy Flash" acid line. 6 mixes, my favorites are the instrumental and the
bonus beats.  HH


ANARCH E-PUNK ROCK EP (HALLUCINATE MUSIC, US)
The Straightedge mix of HARDCORE MOTHERFUCKA is hardcore but, who ever did
this record is NOT straightedge! Punk rock brought to a new level. You can
stop cir
cle dancing now.  HH

Around the Globe with Adam X

hardcore to blow you out the door.
On PCPs label DANCE ECSTASY 2001 comes the new NASTY DEJANGO EP entitled EY
FUKKAST which is purely for the hardcore brainstrong. With 5 tracks of
mayhem, PCP proves to be my favorite producer out of Germany. Also on PCP is
the "5"E.P. Very acidy and trancey not to fast either. We are still waiting
patiently for the release of FRANKFURT TRAX VOL 3 a double LP produced by PCP
and various other artists from Frankfurt. I heard a promo of this and it is
!@##$%^$ wicked!!!!!!!!!!!! Force Inc is on a mad spree of hot releases this

-TRANSFORMATION produced by RESISTSANCE D. Soothing female hum over a trancey
analogue synth that enevelopes to the point where your brain melts like hot
wax on a new label entitled ETERNITY. ADAM & EVE Rec from somewhere out there
in Germany is quickly becoming cult in Bklyn. Their 4th release is entitled
THE ROOTS EP. RACING CAR on the A side is acid hardcore kaos. I blew 10
copies out the door of my record shop in 10 minutes. This is a must!
SPACEMATE RECORDINGS out of Cologne Germany release MATE, a 4 cut EP of
tribal trance rhyyhms. If you like Wonka Beats, then this is for you.
Over to Italy ACV records is also becoming cult with ANIBALDI and ARMANI. The
techno sound of Rome is back with LEO ANIBALDI-POSESSION E.P. This is pure
mind bending hardcore acid. On a scale of 1 to 10 this gets a 100!!!!!!!!!!
The original sound of the Chicago underground is back with ROBERT
ARMANI-MUZIK E.P. featuring a RMX of the cult Chicago stomper CIRCUS BELLS
from 1990. I must have somekind of esp because I had a vibe that there was
going to be a remix of this track by Robert himself. On Hot Trax comes a hard
acid 4 cut E.P. entitled DECADE........ The homocidal DJ from Brooklyn, LENNY
D is back with fierce hardcore remixes of COSMO TRASH-TRASHMAN. These RMXS

from 280/17/880 interchange in san jose:
take  880 south to Camden Ave, the second exit past 280.
Exit to the right and turn left on Camden.   Camden will fork in a
mile or two (RIGHT after Leigh Ave); stay to the right.  Continue 
a mile or two after said fork to Blossom Hill Road.  Cross Blossom
Hill Road and go about 1/2 mile (no lights), then take a right on
Vista Loop.  This will be the last right before the light at Hicks.  
Proceed up Vista Loop until you reach the stop sign.  Stop and look
to your left, straight up a driveway that disappears between two
houses.  Turn left and cruise on up!


Stop by on your way to Lighthouse II!  Maybe I'll go with you!

I know... what else was there to do in High School?  :)

That's one reason... This was also around the time that Peter Hope and Richard
Kirk got together and put out a release on Wax Trax, so a lot of the Wax Trax 
sound and the CV sound probably intermingled.  Also, all those darn Belgians 
had a lot of influence on Alain Jourgensen around then.  I believe Richard 23 
is credited on Twitch, plus the Nature of Love single, if my memory serves me.
He also thanks 'The RevCo gang in Brussels'.  :)

That's an understatement, although Microphonies is similar (and a great album).

The history of Alain Jourgensen's career is interesting... he wasn't always the
loser he is now.  The first stuff they really did (the 'Cold life' single)
was really different from their first album (except for one track which formed the bassline for 'I wanted to tell her').  A.J. claims that the first album was
'The worst piece of shit created by man' due to overproduction by the folx at 
Arista.  This is easy to believe.  It's good for a laugh to play some recent 
Ministry and then throw on their first album... Like going from 'So What' 
("I ONLY KILL ...TO KNOW I'M ALIVE!!!!") to a sappy love song like 
'I should have known better'.  IMHO their best stuff is on Twitch.

What this has to to with rave music I don't know.

Subject: Origins and musings

In my honest opinion, searching for the origin isn't what is important.  I've
bought a lot of Detroit techno on recommendation and it has never really
tooted my horn.  Saying that Detroit or Kraftwerk or anything is where a sound
originates from is as bad as labeling the music under a category.  Are we to
assume that every producer of dance music today drew inspiration from
Cybertron and Derrick May?  Personally, I'd be rather offended if someone
stated that my "sound" was inspired by Kraftwerk.  I'd like to think that the
better musicians out there are inspired by their hearts and minds and not by
anyone else.

Jon expressed some amusement over a reviewer's attempts at identifying samples
in "The Trip".  Trying to identify inspiration is probably even more sketchy.
In short, who cares?

On the FAQ, chuck the roots.  Let that debate continue on alt.rave for all it
is worth (not a lot).

There was an enormous "save the robots" rave in Paris this past summer,

in Paris is not as communal as say the bay area, clubs are really the
nucleus of the movement and the music is deeper.  I'd recommend checking
out the legendary les bains, where stories of drugged drinks once abounded
back when.  They still practice the selective door policy, and as far
as I know, probably one of the few remaining cities doing so.  After
the Vertigo(?) incident in LA (lawsuit citing discrimination in door

I completely agree.  I was referring to the Ministry of the last few
years.  The last three albums for sure (off the top of my head; maybe 
more).  I think they were but aren't any more.  IMHO.

i'm gunn-a jump in here; hope i'm invited:)

i have to agree with the 'the term and sub-culture "techno" began in the
late 70s and was characterized by bands like Kraftwerk, Cab Voltaire,
early Depeche, the Normal, maybe even OMD, etc' line of thinking.
obviously, if a flyer says techo by spun on it now-a-days (my gramma
uses that word, hee, hee) it means rave/house/techno and not Kraftwerk,
etc.  in fact, i really don't get the connection. q8I   but (IMHO)
computer music, bleeps and blip bloop stuff, was probably called techno
in the first place because it was done on a computer, sequenced and
programmed, which at at the time was TECHNOlogically superior to the
rest of the stuff like jam and clash and journey and whatever else was
happening there.

i don't know if this is worth a flame-fest (could be fun though. :)
this same thread has probably happened a million timez on other lists,
maybe even this one before...it's like asking why are we here?

>It seems I fried my eyes looking at the strobe too much.

At the last rave I went to there was a little booth off to one side selling 
something or other, and I noticed one of the "black lights" they had was 
a bit peculiar. I looked closer and noticed the entire envelope was 
clear as a drinking glass, such that you could see the filaments. I 
realized they were using a a quartz envelope short-wave ultraviolet 
lamp, like the kind used for sterilizing water, goggles (to prevent 
transimission of pink-eye in woodshop for example) and erasing 
EPROMS. They had this thing shining right into the eyes of anyone 
milling around the booth. 

I tried to tell the girl tending the booth that it was definitely a 
hazard (all devices which use these have means to ensure none of the uv leaks 
out) but she just beamed me a big rave smile and said "Oh, the guy that made 
that for us knows a loooottt about electronics so I'm sssuuurre it's OK". 

I told her she should shut it off. She wouldn't. What a shit. 

I'm sure she thought of herself as a real peacefull little flower poised for 
the new age. As far as I was concerned she was Dow chemical personified.

Quite wrong, actually.  If you recall, we were sitting there with a 4-minute
track that ended with that "ah ah ah ah" part, so I said: "Hey, maybe there's
something else on that Die Warsau CD to sample."  We listened to the intros
to all of the tracks and narrowed the selection down to two of them.  We loaded
the first one into the sampler and used it.  That Die Warsau drum loop is what 
the reviewer referred to as the LeBlanc-style beat, and we (at least I) had no 
preconceptions about wanting it to sound like Meat Beat.  We just stole a 
convenient drum loop (because the CD was justing sitting there in the studio,
begging to be sampled), and it worked.

Well, Robbie Hardkiss is supposed to be one of the featured DJs at

And they are making a big stink about how everything is confirmed and
they give the numbers for people to call and check.

Tuesday night to buy my LIGHTHOUSEII ticket, and the salesclerk didn't know
they still had tickets for sale! It's a good thing I had called earlier that 
day - he looked around and found the envelope with the tickets, to his

 I remember when Underground Records didn't want to carry used CDs, because
the owner (Pat?) didn't like CDs. I guess they changed their mind since then.

Subject: My Cramped Weekend


CRAMPS/LIGHTHOUSE2/DANCING

CRAMPS : Great show, if you're interested in seeing a Wild Fool in action on
Halloween - that fool being Lux Interior, the singer for the Cramps. While 
everyone else in the band was in pointy-hatted witches costumes, he was in
black lace lingerie. They played a lot of their old stuff, and new.

 This was the first time I've ever spent an extended time ( 3 songs ) in the
mosh pit! Quite a humid situation - an instant temperature gradient of 10
degrees whether you're in the action or outside it. A very friendly crowd
for the Cramps - people helping those who fall, or dive from the stage. I only
saw one possible altercation, but it got patched over quickly. There was one
hockey-masked Jason guy who was trying to nudge/push people on the periphery
into the action, but even he knocked it off eventually.

 I noticed that there were some similarities between my first mosh experience
and rave dancing - both involve using the body to achieved an altered state
of mind. Maybe it's the extremes of body contact - in one case, lots and lots
of body contact, and the other, zero body contact.


LIGHTHOUSE2 : Very nice! A strange venue, but it actually worked out OK, 
as each dance floor had it's own environment of volume and floor space, so
that people could choose what felt most appropriate at the time. Nice
animations and slides. Not too many strobes.

 I got to L2 late (4AM), as I had to drive home to San Jose after the Cramps
concert to shower & change clothes. Also, since I am suffering under a cold, 
I took a nap in one of the dance areas, and missed the changeover of DJs 
from Carlos to ? .

 Hello to the SFRavers I saw there - the Normals, "the guy who's almost always
with them", Brian, Paul T., Craig, and the others. Also, Will Penna looked 
like he's recovered nicely from the operation - he danced more than I did!
( If I met you there, please send me an email message [ larryc@netcom.com ],
as I am trying to match names to faces. Usually, remembering names is difficult
for me, and in the acoustic environment of a rave, darn near impossible for
me to hear someone's name right anyway! I was the asian guy with the rose 
wreath in his hair, and a big sun/moon tshirt. ).

DANCING : There was a guy leaning against the wall, who I struck up a conver-
sation with. He wanted to know "How do you dance to this type of music?". I
told him it would be easier to close his eyes, and try to move to the music.
I also reassured him that there was no required dance style for "this music".

 What kind of instructions have you other people given to first-timers? Maybe
we could put together a little booklet for sale at supermarket checkout stands:
"Hot New RAVE Dances, 10 Easy Lessons!" :-) Sell 'em right next to the diet 
books!

Subject: Caspar/Sharon


Well, Brian, it's a good thing you didn't go back to Caspar/Sharon.  You know
all those drunks?  They didn't leave.  Caspar/Sharon was, for me, the worst
night I have ever had in the scene (Cosmo ranks a close second).  

I was invited to go out with some of my friends, and since they are fun and
were going to Sharon, I decided to join them.  Our ride was incredibly late,   
so we didn't go to the Castro =(.  In the car I was informed that Casper and
Sharon had combined, and I had an instant baaaaad feeling.  Well, we got to
the place and found an ENORMOUS line that stretched all the way down one wall
and around the other corner.  Since my friends had been working for Sharon
and since we didn't want to wait in the line, we snuck up close to the front
and managed to get in a little faster.  Once we got into the line it started
to get very difficult to keep a positive attitude.  So many people were drunk
and/or drinking, everyone was pushing and shoving, and security was freaking
out.  We got through the gate (I was able to snake through the crowd quite 
well) and my friends went to the guest list line and I went to the line for
those waiting to experience extortion at its finest.  At this time, the cost
was $25.  When I got through the door, I waited for my friends instead of 
paying right away.  Good thinking.  Somehow, they got an extra bracelet and I
got in free.  I'm very glad because I am quite low on funds and because I
would have been very angry had I spent $25 on that night.  Anyway, I saw a lot
of people I know at the door.  That was the last time I saw most of them for
the night.

Finally we were inside.  And what, my friends, do you think I saw?
Pandemonium.  Lots of people.  And all the drunks who had slobbered and snorted
and fallen on me in line.  Plus their friends.  My friends and I clutched each
other as we weaved through the crowd, designated a home base, and then split
up.  I decided to check out the crowd and the place, and see if anyone I knew
was there.  There were three different rooms with three different sound systems
and three different dj's all at once.  There was pretty good energy, but since
it and everyone were so spread out, it sort of dissipated.  There was a lot of
attitude.

Immediately.  The sooner the better.  You should definitely find out
from Steve her name and phone number.

Each of us should use one of two strategies, as applies.  Either:

1)  Hi, I've been a subscriber to KPFA for n years, and I would
very much like to see a program devoted to techno and house.

or:

2)  Hi, I'm not currently a subscriber, but would definitely pledge
to become one if you scheduled a program devoted to techno and house.

You get the idea.  After 30 or 40 calls, Steve's as good as on the
air.  Those folks know fund-raising potential when they see it.
Plus, they deserve the money anyway...

In terms of precedents, they had a program callled Maximum Rock and
Roll for many, many years, representing the Bay Area punk/hardcore scene.
They eventually lost the program (just a few months ago) because they
weren't bringing in enough members.  I think we can demonstrate that
ravers far outnumber punks at this moment in history.  And, don't forget,
We Are Phuture....
