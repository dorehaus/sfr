I hate to post song ids, but I really want to know this one!
Its a song on Buck's mix tape (which I highly recommend!), probably called
"House Nation".  Its got a really laid back feeling, there is a guy saying
"House nation, under a groove" along with some other stuff.  Any info
would be helpful. :)
Thanks in advance,

Just got back from hauling things back from Penelope's Web.  If anyone
is heading out to the site through the City, I'm in Pacific Heights.
We just came down 101 through Marin and it looks like a clear night
all the way to the ocean.  I really don't want to miss this one!
I also have the directions.  Please email asap or call me at 415/567-5517

It's almost 2 AM.  Idrove to the FMR site, which is in Marin some 40 miles
from my house.  No one there at 1:00, and I thought about my cozy bed, the
long sleepless weekend of partying...time for rest!  What am I doing here?!
So I headed home.  I did notice the caravans of ravers on route around 1:30.

the party should fly, it is way out in the middle of nowhere...really nice
location...  (I did hang around in the parking lot for about an
hour...before I headed home)  Look forward to hearing everyone's report..

Dr. Shoenfeld has been around for a *long* time as a hardheaded debunker of 
anti-drug propaganda.  He is also active in the Drugs conference on the

I just returned to work after a wonderful weekend at Penelope's Web.  
The drive was very well worth it.  One cannot describe how beautiful 
it was on the land that the Promoters rented. Of course there were 
only about 25 or so people that showed up (not exact head count), 
but those of us that did make the drive were treated to a wonderful 
retreat.  The music was really good, and although I didn't dance 
as much as I would have liked, it really didn't matter.  
Betsy and I got up there around 9 or so ,(Thanks for driving Besty), and it 
was just starting to get dark.  I really did not know what to expect, 
but was pleasantly surprised. There were working toilets, out in 
the middle of the field (closed in of course), a real shower, and 
an outdoor kitchen, from which we were served a great dinner of beans 
and rice, and breakfast of Pancakes, both banana wheat berry, and 
regular, eggs, coffee, and fresh fruit.  The space was so beautiful, 
it is almost impossible to describe but i will try. The man who owned 
the land, I was told, owned about 400 or so acres.  (I am sure Bob 
will have a better description later)  The dancing area, was this 
huge circle, that was off on its own.  Up from that to the left was 
the garden and the kitchen.  The garden was gorgeous.  It had little 
sitting areas, a lily pond, benches, and a grassy area right in the middle 
of the garden to lie down and look at the sun or the stars.  There 
was even a mudbath for all of the guests.  The tents were set up 
all around the area.  The space was large enough that you could get 
far away from the music. Speaking of music, the DJ's did a great 
job.  They spun from about 9pm Saturday night till about 3 Sunday 
afternoon.  By that time everyone was either in the mudbath, or on 
their was to the river.  I was at the river.  It was really refreshing 
considering it was so hot in Willits.  Bob even brought his dog Genni, 
who he jumped off of the rope swing into the river with.  She seemed 
to be enjoying that because she climbed up the mountain just to be 
with Bob. 
When we got back from the river Sunday afternoon, everyone was just 
lying on the grass in the garden.  It was quite warm up there but 
not unbearable.  When we reluctantly left at about 5 pm, the YSH 
promoters were trying to think of a way to have the FMR at that space, 
that night.  I don't know how that turned out.  
To everyone that did go, It was great to meet you. 
To everyone that didn't go, you really missed out on a wonderful 
time.  Even though it didn't turn out quite as expected, it was a 
wonderful retreat out of the city.  You could actually walk around 
by yourself for miles literally, and not be bothered by another living 
soul.  If I could have, I would have liked to stay a week or so.  
It was so relaxing out there, even with the music playing.  
Thank you to Melissa, who worked so hard getting it togther, and 
who fed us the whole weekend. Thank you to everyone else who 
put this together.  Hopefully they will be able to put together another 
one, and have a bigger turn out.  It may have been a long drive, 
but it was worth it ten times over. Where else could you just spend 
20 dollars to listen and dance to great music, and have a weekend get away 
all in one?

Mission Rock on Friday night was pretty damn cool.  Anyone over 21
should go to this party!  I wasn't too thrilled with the music, for
the most part (heavy on the disco revival), but occasionally it got
good and the crowd was pretty nice.  Cheap cover, nice location
looking over the bay - you gotta love it.

---

They say "you can never go home again."  I don't know why they say
that, but they do.  This weeks BASICS REUNION sort of brought the
point home for me.

Last summer, there was a series of parties called BASICS - the concept
was very simple: no flash, no gimmicks, just "the basics": good music,
simple light shows, and a crowd of excellent friendly people.  By and
large, these all came off spectacularly well, despite some dodgy
locations.  The vibe was always spectacular and I looked forward to
each new Basics as a "must attend" proposition.

As you can imagine, I was pretty thrilled at the thought of a Basics
Reunion.  I was doubly thrilled when the location turned out to be
less than 5 mins from my new house in San Francisco!

Maybe it was my high expectations, but I thought the party itself was
pretty weak.  We got there early to ease the parking situation and
also because we wanted to make sure we heard Spun, who told me that he
would be on fairly early.

The building was some sort of auditorium or hall on a military base,
up on a hill near the ocean.  Didn't look like much from the outside,
but that doesn't mean anything.

I walked in expecting to hear a pristine sound system, but finding a
rather boomy and ringy one.  Disappointment #2 was Spun's set -
apparently there were some technical problems with the turntables, and
Spun only played for 45 minutes.  The music afterwards was pretty
generic and unexciting, so I checked out the chill space.  This was
behind the building, in a nice open air space.  They had another DJ
setup out there.  Throughout the course of the evening, the music
outside was consistently more entertaining than the music inside.

As for the crowd, I was disappointed yet again.  True, I did see some
familiar faces from last summer's Basics, but not as many as I would
have thought.  The new faces seemed to be attached to rather young
bodies, and somewhat clueless attitudes.  My friend commented that it
seemed like the 18 year olds had been reading Time magazine and
decided how to "rave" based on that.  They acted friendly because they
heard that that's what you're supposed to do.  It seemed rather fake.

As the main room began to fill up, it became unbearably hot.  Strange,
given that the site was right near the ocean.  I guess there was
little or no ventilation.  Probably a good thing, then, that they
instituted a "No Smoking Inside" policy.  They were also providing
free water until they ran out of cups.  Due to this, I spent most of
my time outside.  This was much better, as the fresh air felt really
good.  And even though it seemed like everyone outside had a cigarette
in hand, the ample natural airflow made sure that it wasn't too hard
to breathe.

So, despite all the misgivings and disappointments, I had a really
good time.  Mainly due to the presence of some of my good friends.  I
did a lot of business actually, talking to DJs, promoters & other
musicians.  This occasionally became quite surreal as I was not
exactly in my right mind for most of the party.

It made me think hard about future parties.  I don't think I will be
going to very many Big Events any more.  I don't think the scene is as
strong as it was last summer (and despite was john s lee says, last
summer was *fantastic* from my point of view).  I guess I'll be
sticking to the smaller, cheaper, more intimate parties.

See you next week at Mission Rock!

Howdy all-
I am kinda new to the list, and have questions for those who might know-
First the background.

A friend and I were working on some music when we were in school back east.
 We had access to a blinding assortment of wonderful gear- A beautiful
souped up Mac with well designed MIDI interfaces(you could actually use
them!), several nice keyboards, sampling machines, coupla mixers,
sequencers, basically everything you could dream of for making music.  We
put off doing most of what we wanted to do, and then ran out of money.  So
we moved here (SF).  Now, we really would like to get back into this, but
have nothing except a couple of kinda puny macs, and nothing else.

Now for the questions-
does anyone know where we could come by some equipment?  This being a
decent MIDI keyboard (I could probably wire up an interface if I had to)
and maybe a sampling machine.  A Moog would be great, too.  We cannot
afford to buy, but can they be rented anywhere in the area?  We would
really like to do to DAT, but an old 8-track would work, too.  Is there a
place for us?

Thanks for any info- and If we manage to get anything going, I'll keep
everyone up to date on our project.

This is probably best handled through email.
Thanks-
jamie


My company doesn't have anything to do with my opinions, nor do I
if they might cause trouble for me at some point in the future.

Very few people, maybe 20, showed up. The YSH people lost a lot of
money on this.

I feel really badly about YSH losing money. They work so hard and put
on a good friendly event every Thursday for only $5. It seems unjust
that they're the ones losing money and not the moneygrubbing
confiscating uncaring for their patrons--for only $20--promoters.

I'm going to make an extra donation at the YSH door next time because
I believe in their cause and because they've treated everyone so well
every time I've been there.

                                -----
				
I wish everyone could have shown up, for it was an incredibly
beautiful site. Vivian described it better than I could. Read her
post. I was pleasantly surprised to find they had facilities such as
a nice shower (ahhhh) and kitchen.

We had a great time. Having a small number of people meant that you
got to know everyone. The atmosphere was really supportive and
friendly. The mud bath was fun :). I got some really great pictures
there of blissfully mud-covered ravers :) :). I didn't go down and
dance wearing just mud, but some people did. Sounds fun :).

If they ever hold an event there again, GO! Bring camping stuff, and
you will have the time of your life. This place is remote and
beautiful and 100% guaranteed atomic bomb bustproof. You can walk for
miles and see only nature. When they turn off the music, the forest is
so quiet you can hear your heartbeat.

It's well worth the drive. I hope they do it again, and make it a
Friday-Saturday-Sunday event. If they do, I'll go, and I can probably
provide rides for people.

I went to this also, but when I walked up to the doors and the line
I had a bad feeling about it. So I stuck my head in to see what I
could hoping that the music would sound better than it did outside.
It sounded the same. And I DID NOT like the music. It had no groove
to it just straight forward BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!! The crowd was
as Jon Drukman put it young and on the fake side. I really wanted
to go see Spun as well but after hearing Jon's review and Spun being
on for only 45min. well I didn't miss anything. I never went in. 
I just didn't feel the vibe there and also didn't feel like paying
$15 bucks. So me and my friend went to go check out Good times I think
thats the name and well....No offense but the majority of the crowd
was gay males and my friend and I didn't feel comfortable so we left
to go back to sanjose. It was a long night of driving and being bored.

Thats my weekend review.  :(

I don't think I will be trying any large events at all anymore.
This was my first large event in about 10 months and it just
wasn't a good feeling.

I would venture to say that this was the ravelist indoor social event of the year.

That's interesting because I had a long talk with the sound system guy
at Penelope's Web (can't remember his name (hi)). He's a purist and
really knows his stuff. I've always been an audiophile*, and found his
talk quite interesting. There's a lot of really bad sound system
people out there, and he talked about the priciples of room acoustics,
turntable isolation, etc. Attention to detail makes a big difference
in sound (often, one can sound better for far less money), and
apparently that was a big factor at Basics.

PW sounded really good and I was amazed at how well that funky Herbie
Hancock piece sounded. It's just about the only dance music I've heard
before on a really good stereo, so this was a chance to compare. Not
bad at all.

I couldn't help but wonder how much better Unity might have sounded
had they used him as a consultant.

* My philosophy for designing a room is first you design the acoustics
  and stereo speaker placement, then you worry about everything else.

Hi all!

     Anyone ever been to the Sound Factory (the club) in SF?  I went there
friday night and it was really cool (is it new?).  They played music that was 
better than most raves I've been to in the last year.  This place had raging 
Techno that never dropped below 130-140 bpm, laser/wall shows that were very 
well done (not as dramatic as the wherehouse raves of a couple years ago 
though), and a crowd that was completely devoid of seedy, ganglike, or 
teeny-booper types (people there just trying to get laid) -  which made for a 
very friendly and coordial crowd.  The place is very well ventilated and has 
several rooms of different kinds of  rave-y music.  I found that when a room I 
was in started getting a little to "house-y" for me (the DJ often housed up a 
set a bit to let people cool down) I'd go to another room where techno was 
creating a hard-core vibe.  The sound system was also quite good - although all 
rooms did not have sound systems of equal capibilities.  The largest room had 
speakers that, when next to, blurred my vision when the base hit (constant 
blurred vision) - I would strongly recommend ear-plugs if going to this place.

     Oh, another observation I had.  I would say close to 50-75% of the people
there weren't on anything (excluding alcohol, which I believe was sold inside)
which made for a very interesting mix of people.  People had no trouble dancing
to 130-140 bpm music - they just had to rest more often.

     I don't know what the hours of this place are, but I believe they don't
open till 12:00 a.m. - I have no idea when they close.  I stayed until
about 3:30 a.m. and it was still happening.  Price is $10.

     I think the alure of this place for me, was that the music played
reminded me of the music Garth, Jeno and Munson used to play before their
names become popular and the music they played changed.

     Anyway, that's my $.02.  This was the first time I've ever been to this
place, so I don't know if this was a fluke or the norm as far as music and
crowd.  But I'll definately be checking it out again...


                                       Jon.

Well, as for most anyone who went to the previous Basics parties, I was looking
forward to the Basics reunion.  During the course of those parties I met alot
of people and made some good friends, many of whom I have seen only sporadically
since then.  It seemed that people who went to Basics parties didn't really go
to other parties at all.  So when we got to Basics Reunion, it was with great 
pleasure since many of those people were there.  I spent the first 3 hours or so
just socializing and having a great time!

Arounf 5:)
00

Around 5:00 Pete and I went on a walk to the store, and when I returned I went in
and caught the last 45 minutes or so of garth's set, which was pretty good and 
hard.  The other DJs were mostly weak, except for Tony, who played a nice Tony
set.  There is another Basics coming, this time with Jon Williams (I think)
so the music should be better next time.

All in all a great time, with lots of friendly people.  Go to the next one.


Mission Rock is very cool to go to, so check it out.  Jon's review is entirely
accurate as far as I'm concerned.  Great outdoor dancing and lots of chill space
out near the docks.  

How was the FMR?

Bye
Zak

is it in a old 3 story building near/under some freeway interchange?  when
i went (a while ago, like Nov92), they had some funkish stuff on the bottom
floor, house-ish/disco on the second, and 'hard-core' on the third.  90% of
the people were just standing around checking everybody else out, lots of
pseudo-scene types.  the laser setup on the top floor was cool but the
sound system really sucked.  i talked to the dj for a bit, can't his name,
he thought that the l.a. crowd liked hard-core more than the s.f. crowd :)
anyway, the floor was pretty sparse most of the time, he was playing pretty
cool 120+bpm stuff with no breaks.  was tres funny when mobs of people
rushed on when he played 'dominator' by human resource, remember that one
;^)

maybe i went on the wrong night, sunday?

It was a long trip, but well worth it!  It actually was about 3 hours to the
map point.  From there, shuttle vans ferried everyone about 15 miles of
mostly-dirt roads to the site.

The site is beyond beautiful.  It's up in the mountains about 15 miles from
Willets, and miles from any other habitation.  There was a cleared area
for dancing, a huge garden, and lots of forest around it all.  (Also
facilities such as a kitchen, from which food came forth on several
occasions).  There was plenty of space to set up tents (of course, I
didn't actually end up *using* my tent after setting it up -- sleep,
what's that??)

This was an all-night-and-most-of-the-next-day event.
The music was great and I don't think I ever danced so much so long before.
The light show was provided mostly by the nearly-full moon and the stars. 
The vibe was of a different order from the usual, it was mingling with the
natural splendor of the place and flowing all about us in a mind-blowing
way.  

Rebecca's set in the middle of the night
caused me to dissolve into a sea of colors.

For chill-out, there was the forest, the garden, and the mud-bath!
I'd never tried that before, but it was just what I needed.

To Melissa, Bob, and everyone else who made this happen:
THANK YOU!!

                                    &Andy

Yeah it was fun. Well as fun as is possible when my mind/body is as
thrashed as it was. And I got to hear some of that haudcoah. Turns out
I have some of it on compilations, just didn't know that was what it
was called. I can dance to it... for about 5 minutes. I like the SF
housey stuff a lot more.

Just wanted to say that I loved Penelope's Web; really enjoyed myself.
With just a small number of people we had a real sense of community, and
responsibility between us.  I think we all felt that each of us were in
some part responsible for making the event work.  As Sean said, with just
a few people, we got to know more people than we would normally.

Thanks to all the friendly people I spoke to, and to those who just
radiated energy and good will.  Hello to everyone I met, I'm not sure
which people are on sfraves and which aren't.  All day Sunday was
great: mudbaths, lounging in the shade...

Music really picked up in the middle of the night, when I heard the end of
Rebecca's set and I liked Thomas' stuff too, and we also had a new starter
Arzo.

The site was beautiful, which was described perfectly by Vivian, who I
think was one of the two girls who gave us a ride down in their pick-up
(thanks), sorry if I'm wrong on this.  Even driving down the road was
beautiful.  We lay in the back of the pick-up, and stared at the sky.
There were a few wispy clouds in the sky, and we turned back and forward
and streaks of clouds spun and danced (all without chemical inducement I
might add!).

Well done Bob, Melissa and all who helped out.  I've never made it to
YSH yet, but now that I've seen the energy that the YSH people put into
these things, I'm definatley going on Thursday.  Overall it was a really
positive experience.

Louis

Does the audio spectrum card handle
-MIDI in
-at least 16bit stereo out?


My company doesn't have anything to do with my opinions, nor do I
if they might cause trouble for me at some point in the future.

I'm not sure, I believe so... Any software you use that you don't
write yourself (and hopefully the stuff you do write yourself) should
use the MIDI manager anyway so it doesn't really matter whether or not
the card does, unless it uses some poorly written SW.  MIDI interfaces
are (relatively) cheap.

Yes.

On the synth side, the all-time bargain has to be the Kawai series of Midi
  boxes (also available with keyboards)

You can get a box with tons of sounds (orchestra, synth, percussion) for 
  about $250.

They're available everywhere (even at Guitar center)

My favorite Muzak Bahgan has to be either an Ensoniq ESQ-1 (for its
general quality and ease of programming) or a Korg DW-8000 (for its
nice buzzy sounds or its cool goofy arpeggiator :-)

Both can be had for around $400.

(and to think I spent $1300 on my ESQ-1 in 1989...)

Guitar effects boxes are also great, especially if they have MIDI in.

The ART SGE is a pretty good deal.

well, here's my thoughts:

i'll let what other people have wrote speak for itself as far as the
site is concerned.  basically (no hype here) it's the most beautiful
spot i think any event will ever be held in.  i would drive up there
every other weekend just to hang out, if i had the option.  the site
itself is quite large, and is totally bordered by land owned by the
same person and his friends.  the music didn't disturb or disrupt
anyone, which was really great, even though the sound system ran for
about 20 hours full tilt non stop.

it really ** is ** a 3 hour drive to the site.  i spent 2 hrs 40 mins
on the road in a really battered pickup, with 2 stops, to get to the
map/shuttle point.  others reported 2 hrs 10 mins and also times
closer to 3 hrs.  willets is 125 miles north of the golden gate.  101
narrows down to one lane in willets, but 99% of the drive to the
shuttle point is 3 or 2 lane highway.  the shuttle point is 15 miles /
25 minutes from the site. 

the event could have started friday night, but traffic up there is bad
leaving the city friday afternoon, and we didn't want people driving
late in the night on friday.  personally i think the saturday start
time and sunday end times were pretty much perfect.

fyi, your sister's house took NO financial interest in this event
whatsoever.  one nation productions took 100% of the financial risk,
and lost $1100.  we're not sure what we are going to do about the $$
lost... one financial partner lost their rent money :-( so we're
dealing with that.  (sean, and others, if you feel moved to donate,
that's cool, but you should give the $$ to me or Melissa or Jamie or
Rene' or Peace, not to YSH.  please don't consider this a grovel for
funds, we just really appreciated you taking the time to come up and
be with us and enjoy the space with us.)  a few YSH people were
individually involved with the event, and they really hooked us up
with their DJs, which was insanely cool and VERY appreciated.

things offered to all guests:

food (rice and beans for dinner, pancakes and eggs for breakfast)
grill (if people brought their own stuff)
unlimited water
camping space (either near other people or away from others)
outdoor toilet and shower facilities
mud bath / pit (this was a LOT of fun)
impromptu side trip to the river to swim on Sunday
18 hours of music from 9 PM until 3 PM and the system sounded great!
  (Harry from Primary Sound did an incredible job for an outdoor setup)
many excellent DJs who were inspired by the site
a beautiful garden / ultimate chill space
lotsa trees an' plants an' leaves an' shit
visuals by mothers nature and earth
absolutely 100% all natural pure bust-free vibe

i REALLY want to see another event up there, but we need support and
help to make it happen.  to be honest, we lost enough money that we're
financially incapable of throwing another event there --- even if we
KNEW that we could break even, we can't put the funds together to make
it happen.

after adding everything up, and figuring out where we could cut
corners, we could throw another event for 100 people for roughly $1200
in costs.  the biggest cost is renting passenger vans to shuttle
people from the map point --- which is essential as a) it's easy to
get lost in the mountains b) the roads are horrible and you wouldn't
want to drive your car up there if you could help it and c) parking is
VERY limited and discouraged by the land owner.

i'd like to see the next event be another net.rave, with help from
SFRaves, Your Sister's House and One Nation Productions.  i'd also
like to see the work at the site shared -- having everyone volunteer
to work a couple of hours doing something (security, cooking food,
hanging out at the shuttle point, set up / break down, et al) so that
all of us can enjoy the event.

i personally thought that the women DJs did a phenomenal job, but if
people would be into it, we could easily get some "name" DJs to the
event -- Carlos, Dutch and Tony all expressed interest in spinning at
Penelope's Web.

i also personally loved interacting with nature, and didn't need any
visuals to get off.  however, we could easily add visuals to the mix.

the big caveat in all of this is that we'd need some serious
committment from people to make it happen.

so, in the grand net.tradition, straw poll time.  the tenative working
name for this event is RENEWAL.  (Brian, howzabout Connection III?)
the working date is saturday august 28th.  this event would be very
similar to penelope's web in terms of structure and what would be
provided.  the tenative cost per person is $12 advance, $15 at the
shuttle point.  transport up and back from SF would probably be
available for roughly $8 (advance only, used to cover additional van
rental costs).  the event would only be promoted on the net and
through your sister's house.

please send email to 'renewal-yes%groovy@us.oracle.com' if you would
definitely go to this event.  indicate if you would be interested in
advance ticket(s) and how many.  also indicate if you would be
interested in the van pool.

please send email to 'renewal-no%groovy@us.oracle.com' if you would
not go and would like to explain why (with the idea that maybe we can
make the event better for everyone by 'fixing' the problem(s)).

to make things clear, any 'profits' would go to one nation productions
to either a) continue to defray the debt from penelope's web or b) act
as seed money for future events, possibly including a free golden gate
park rave.

if there's a good response to renewal-yes, this thing will happen.

(i'm going to get you all to go up there and have a fantastic time if
i have to drag each one of you up there on my back!)

Bob

Subject: More about Sound Factory...
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Hello again!

    I got so many replies to my original posting about the Sound factory, that
I figured I might as well have follow-up posting.

    There are a few things you need to keep in mind about this place (little
things that I noticed):

1) I don't know which nights to go are best.  The guy I went with recommended
   Friday nights - which is when I went.

2) This place doesn't really start to fill up until around 2 a.m. - I guess
   that's when other places close, or people get their second wind, or
   something.  When I got there around 1-1:30 a.m. Saturday morning there was
   a fair amount of empty dance space, but when I left at ~3:30 a.m. it was
   pretty crowded.

3) At about 2:30 a.m. the music was cranked up to the point where I could
   feel my innerds vibrating when near the speaker.  Before that point, though,
   the music was moderately loud (couldn't really "feel" the music).

4) There are multiple floors at this place (at least 2).  I don't know much
   about the other floor(s) - I went (more like *ran*) upstairs when I heard
   the faster, more driving music - thus ignoring the music elsewhere. 

I've only been there once, so I don't know what the norm is for this place,
but there must be other people out there who have been to this place recently
and can add some more input.

                        Hope this helps...

                                  Jon.

Can both the MediaVision and ProAudioSpectrum16 be used with a mac?  How
do they compare with the Audiomedia and with each other?  I've been
trying to find a way to get 16 bit sampling on the mac for under $700.

my brain isnt together so i know im goign to miss something
but i really ewant to post something whiel my short term memory might possibly exist still

well i got in sf around 4 and hung out at casa de uvc
listening to some good music til we headed over to leahs "smalL" *AHEM*
little bbq which aside from me being unconscoius and not wnating to move much
was a very fun time

from there every headed off to home and later to point reyes where the 
moon shining over the water of the ocean is probably a sight that will stick
in my mind til a few years after im dead
although there were some problems it looked like one hell of a party
until it was made not so by at least 2 ranger trucks, 4 chp cars and 
one county sherriff

but i would like to definitely thank brian for picking a beautiful sight
that was quite enjoyable while it lasted
(id also liek to thank him for dragging me there and back)

(quick side note, NEVER, NEVER decide that it would be cute to 
lay out a sleepign bag in the back of a truck, jeep, blazer, etc
and lie down for a bit at rave where you actually plan on getting up)

anyhow.. when things got moved to the berkeley marina it was great
i dont know what gg park is like, but as far as a san diego sunday in teh park
type deal.. a monday at the marina was wonderful
if i left with the ne-raves zoo after that, the trip would have been more than 
worth it
i would REALLY REALLY like to thank who ever foudn that location
because they made one hell of  party go off, albeit a few hours
late, but one hell of a party nonetheless
it was beautiful, even though my body was screaming at me to stop dancing
i was much too happy and the music just filled me and made me work
my body into some unhealthy physical but spiritually fulfilled state

i dont think im going home quite yet, but if i did
it would be worth the plane ticket up and back

 ,
dana

  I've been reading all these negative posts regarding Basics, so I just
had to post my opinion which is completely different. I hung out most of 
the time near the dj booth. Actually just a little bit back as I don't
like to be out in front of the dancers but completely surrounded by them.
I had a fantastic time and so did my sister. The people that were around
me most of the night were very friendly and fun to dance with. There was
omly one person who "bugged me". I was sitting on the floor behind the
dj booth chilling out and this guy kept sticking his face in my face and
making bug eyes at me and saying wierd stuff like "Do you practice Voodoo?"
I was sitting there minding my own business and trancing out on the music
with my eyes closed and I would feel his presence and open my eyes and he
was right in my face. Really bothered me. Then my sister saw what was 
going on and told him to bug off, that I just wanted to be left alone and
chill. That was the only negative thing I can say about the night. Sure
it WAS hot but actually sometimes I really enjoy being hot and sweaty and
dancing, dancing, dancing. Maybe the sound system wasn't as good as other
Basics but I still had a great time and saw alot of familiar faces.
And... I didn't think the music was that bad. Especially early in the 
morning. The energy was incredible. Maybe people that didn't have as good
of a time didn't hang out in the right place.

Well, here's my $0.02 worth:

I had a really good time at Basics.  Due to some timing considerations
(a child who had to go to sleep), Ethan, Pete and I headed out
to Basics fairly early, like around 10:30 or so.  I was mystified by
the location directions, since I'm fairly familiar with the area, and
had never noticed a suitable location near the SF zoo, but we followed
the directions, and I found myself at a National Guard Armory.  Sirens
were going off in my head, since I had been to a very unpleasant party
at an armory in San Mateo (it shall remain nameless).  But, I was with
friends, and there was Brian directing parking, so I let go my fears,
and decided to go with it.  We got flyered by a 5 year old (very nice little
boy).  We also talked with someone who said, "Man, I don't think this
party is gonna happen.  It's empty."  To which Pete said, "It's early,
you know.  They'll come."

When I got inside, ye olde sound system was booming away, and the place
was EMPTY, and i mean _E_M_P_T_Y_. Imagine a huge cavern with maybe 20
people total.  Wowzee.  I knew what the guy was saying.  It seemed like
it would be really hard to fill up the space.  But, I was still with
friends, and let it go.  We spent a lot of time exploring the nooks and 
crannies, and finally happened on the chill out area, which was outside,
a much smaller space, and definitely not so fiercely empty.  We spent
a lot of time shuttling in and out, till finally when we came back in
once, the place had really gotten a sizable crowd (maybe 150), and i
started feeling a vibe of some sort.  The music started picking up, and
so did I, so I danced for a while, and then went out for another chill.
This time, when I went back out and came back in, it was really swinging,
and there were people everywhere.

I left for a little while with a friend (they were being friendly at the
door I guess), and getting back in was no problem - it must have been 
around 2:30, 3:00, i guess.  Markie was doing a sonic bass set, which i
wasn't really into, so i went out to the chill area, and socialized (heavily)
and then Fluid caught me up and brought me to the SFR posse.  The chill
DJ was playing some fine dancy tunes, and people were grooving, and I
was meeting all you fine net.ravers, and had a fine time.

I went back in to find Ethan and Pete, and caught up with them, and all
was more fun.  The morning ambient set in the chill area was really pleasant.

All in all, it was really unusual for me to do a rave from start to near-
finish (i left around 7), to see the party build and crescendo and diminish.
I wasn't overly happy with the sound system--there was a nasty echo off a
very flat rear wall that was exactly 1/3 beat behind the main stacks, that 
constantly jarred me, especially since it was augmenting the hi frequencies.
The visuals were pretty good, though i did hear a few complaints about the
ants.  I liked the laser on the main mural, and wanted to have seen more
of it, and earlier in the evening.  Overall, i thought that security was
pretty mellow.  It was nothing compared to the presence i felt at LA
ToGather or the nameless San Mateo rave mentioned above.

It would have been nice to have had a larger chill area, and with a view.
Normally, I get really claustrophobic/uncomfortable in large crowds, but
I was OK with this one.  I did spend a fair amount of time beaming rays
from my luv phaser at the crowd, and got a lot of smile back from those
who noticed.  I also appreciated the no smoking policy in the main room, 
which was, for the most part, observed.  I was mildly annoyed at all the
litter, but, ah well.  I made a coupla sweeps through the crowd picking
up stuff from the floor.  

One suggestion for future raves is ash cans.  I know many don't want
to acknowledge it, but many ravers (myself included) do smoke tobacco,
and we'd all be much better off placing as many ash cans as trash cans.
Less litter for all concerned in the long run.  There was one, tiny little
ashtray in the chill area, which was quickly filled with litter.  Not
enough for that many people.  

Not the best rave in my life, but I had a good time, met lots of friends, 
and made some new ones.  I'd go to another Basics.

     My attorney and I were doing a little night fishing off
the Capitola wharf when we decided we should check out
Basics. So we head to Taqueria Vayarta and go back  to his
place to clean up. When I emerged form the shower I found
him half way through a bottle of Scotch and well into a
container of Tylenol-4. I said 'I thought we were going
raving.' And he mumbled something about an upset stomach.
I'll bet. So I haul my ass up to city leaving my attorney at
a motel in Pacifica to drool on his vegetarian burrito -
this being 2:30am or there abouts. Smooth ride, no traffic,
up hill, into Basics Reunion.
     This was a bad place to be alone. It was so big that I
am sure cool people lurked about but I could not distinguish
who they were. Saw some friends who I've had a bit of a
'falling out with.' Not a good scene. I will spare the
details but what entailed can scarcely be described as an
experience promoting unity, family, etc. But what can one
do? For personal reasons Basics sucked hard core. That is to
say, if you can imagine a thirsty chimpanzee, an unflushed
toilet,  a large unrefrigerated pickle, and a sexually
frustrated film maker named Barney, you will get some sense
of my experience at Basics. That is to say I left with a bad
taste in my mouth...

        Before I make my post about the long, long LONG weekend for me,
I want to say that when you post reviews of raves, you really should
try and refrain from bringing outside influences to play.  I mean, sure,
it can definitely have an effect on your experience, but it's not fair to
the people putting on the party nor to the people who didn't get to go
but wanted to hear how it was.  It's like someone reviewing a movie and
dissing it because the popcorn in the lobby was stale.

	I could go on but you get the idea.

	I ran across a great quote from one of the people who
	has helped to contribute to the modern version of the 
	experience we assign to the word, rave...

	The more knowledge we acquire, the more mystery we find...  A
	human being is part of the whole, called by us the Universe; a
	part limited in time and space.  He experiences himself, his
	thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest-- a
	kind of optical illusion of his consciousness.  This delusion
	is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal
	desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.  Our
	task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our
	circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the
	whole of nature in its beauty.  Nobody is able to achieve this
	completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself
	a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.

	that's true. I was just a little upset at the time. I'll try to
vent elsewhere in the future. I guess my point was that though there was
nothing wrong with the party - i did not have the experience i wanted to 
have... which I found really upsetting because I generally have the opposite
experience at a rave... no offense to anyone involved in producing Basics.
I had fun when I was dancing. Its just that my subjective experience 
tainted the whole thing - and too an extent that I felt compelled to
mention it in my post. I didn't notice the sheer absurdity and subjectivity
of my review because a group of people that
usually contributed to the positive aspects of raving became a negative
part of the experience. I had to say something somewhere. Wrong place. 
Sorry if I pissed any of you off that helped produce Basics - the voice
of disillusionment can sometimes be loud an inappropiate,  or maybe that's
just me...sorry...

        Well, if any of you felt that Sunday night was a total bomb, I
don't blame you.  I would feel pretty shafted too if I drove out an 
hour and a half risking my life on twisty mountain roads only to be
talked down to by a Park Ranger in a funny hat.  

        Well, here's the story.

        I hadn't had any time over the past couple weeks to go site
hunting - in fact I really strongly felt the full moon should be at
Bonny Doon, since there were so many people in from out of town and
even though it's old hat to us, at least it's a reliable place.  The
Full Moon Massive people decided otherwise - they wanted a new fresh 
space, which I guess I could understand.  I didn't have any I had
confidence in, so I offered to go driving Saturday to find one.  They
suggested I look around Point Reyes, which also corresponded to two
suggestions I had gotten earlier in the week.  I also decided to
scour the coast up the 1 fwy in hopes of something nice, but 6 hours
later I finally found a place I felt confidence in - North Beach and
South Beach.  North Beach in particular was so far remote from any
inhabitants that we could successfully argue that we weren't bothering 
anyone - most of the other beaches had park residences right next to 
them, so they were definitely off limits.  Here was a site that had 
everything - bathrooms, water, soft clean sand, and enough parking.

	I came home that night and drove directly to Cindy's for about
20 minutes for dinner, and then straight to Basics to work the parking
lot.  I finally figured my job was done around 2, and I spent the next 
two hours dancing and chilling and such, and went and went to sleep in
my car.  Despite the short amount of time, I liked it - it had lots of
FREE WATER for you agua-terrorists, a decent chill area, etc - though
the turntables seemed very unsteady and it was really stiflingly hot.
Production wise, it was as good as any basics I've been to.  Crowd wise
it could have been better... but oh well, we have Cyberfest to thank for
a recent infusion of newbies (this could be a good thing).

	So I went home, slept for a few hours, then went back to the
city to show the site to the full moon people.  We didn't get back until
late, so I went right to Leah's for the wonderful bbq she planned 
(thanks poopy =)  Anyways... I had planned to get some sleep before going
out but no dice.  We finally left Berkeley around 1:30 - I wasn't
worried about parking as the site was very remote and had marked spaces.
About one hour later (I drive faster than I should on mountain roads - 
ask dana :)  we arrived to an almost full parking lot and tons of people
sitting around their cars blasting bad techno.  The sound arrives around
3:30, still no sign of park rangers so I figure in half an hour we'll
be unstoppable.  Everyone from the East Coast who was visiting had made it
and we were helping take the equipment down to the beach when the bomb 
dropped.

	"Three turntables?  I thought I was bringing the *3rd* turntable!"

	Oh mother of god.  The usual suspects who bring spare turntables
had just assumed by chance that they wouldn't be needed this time around.
Round trip to SF and back was *3* hours.  Garth jumped in his car and was 
off to grab his - meanwhile the sound system setup was stalled while they
debated what to do.  The issue was kinda forced when a park ranger truck
pulled into the parking lot, turned around, left, and returned with two of
his buddies.  It was decided that the sound system for the night would 
consist of 4 huge speaker cabinets, thousands of watts of  power... and
a Sony Walkman.  People were persuaded to move down to the beach while
the cops made a feeble attempt to ask people to leave.  They were soon 
joined by Highway Patrol officers (why?  the closest highway was 18 miles
away!) and Marin County Sherriffs.  After about 45 minutes of checking
out the scene and talking to young ravers who told them everyone here was
tripping (thanks guys! you helped a lot!) the cops came down to the beach
in their customary phalanx and shut off the amplifiers.  It was merciful 
in a way, as the sound system was really flaky..... after about 20 minutes 
of jeers a la "we pay your taxes!", the sound system was dismantled and
the party moved to Berkeley Marina.

After the long and bitter drive home I needed nothing other than a soft
bed and solace of mind, so I gave my keys to Jo and Dana... they ended up
going to the Marina and having a great time.  I felt really really bad 
about the whole situation, feeling stupid for offering a site on National
Park Service land, even though I firmly believe had the second turntable 
been there the vibe would have overwhelmed the police.  I felt a lot better
when the ne-raves zoo came by to say hello around 2pm before leaving for LA.
They had gone right to the Marina and stayed the whole time - and said it
was packed there, people were jamming, the music was good, and in the end
they said they had a great time despite the long drive.  That's what I
cared about the most, was that the out of towners and new people saw a
true full moon happen, and that they ended up happy....

So, that's that.

FYI, we offered the site in Willets to the Wicked posse.  It would
have been 100% bust free and beautiful and all that, but way out of
town and would have involved having people donate $$ to defray shuttle
van and land rental costs (probably $5 per head would have done it).

The last three FMRs have involved less than 2 hours of music starting
at anywhere between 2 AM and 4 AM.  I've stopped worrying about going
to them, even though they are VERY cool when they go off.  I'd
actually rather pay $20 for a night of entertainment knowing that it's
going to happen and last for the night, than have it be free and
really flaky.

Of course, all IMHO.

Hey, friends,

Went to JazzUp last night @ the Oasis, and I must
report that it was a very good time.  

They've got it going in the Egyptian room with
the DJ in that hangout den on the side.  Cozy.
Comfie...warm, happy, and fuzzy....puuurfect.
The music was right on too.  Mellow, but definitely
dance-able.  A nice change from the power-House.

Free snacks (fruit/cheeze/crackers) and friendly 
people pushed it over the top.  A good way to
make coming down from the weekend easier/bearable/
FUN.  

thathat's all
Ravi

I've heard lots of random bitching about fmr rel to it's bustation.  Imho,
  it was pretty damned good.  Consider:
  - the incredibly beautiful ocean.
  - the perfect lighting.
  - perfect weather- right temp, nice breeze, etc.
  - catching the first glimpses of sunrise...

Some questions:
1) Is it really impossible to get a valid permit? (or I am nuts?  I
  honestly don't know how it works out here...)
2) Is it me, or was it the case that they only busted us when the fireworks
  started going off?

Later days,
adam

ps. thanks to everyone who I met for an awesome time!  and thanks to suzi
  and to mau for the rides.

Sorry, but I disagree.  While some of us can be amazingly profound and
grand with our totally objective and all-encompassing observations (;-)
most, if not all of our experiences are tainted by our subjective
viewpoints.  I think it's good to share these veiwpoints with each other.
It was quite clear that your review was greatly influenced by your personal
situation, and I'm sure most of us are intelligent enought to take that
into account.  IMO, sfraves is the right place to share our personal
perspectives on any rave experience.

First to start off on the weekend. Basics was just okay. I liked Unity
better. The visuals at Unity were better and the people were cool. Basics
was cool in some occasions, but I admit the music wasn;t up to par. The
chill out music was better. It was cool seeing everyone Susie (where is my
koosh ball), Fluid, Kreig, Fran, Brian, Bryce, Danarchy, Dan, Derek Chung,
Patrick (Plui) and his friends, Microwiz (Greg) and his friend, Ovid,
Nick, etc. It was nice meeting Steve S. I am sorry that Brian Sassone
didn't come to the FMR or Basics or Unity. I hope you feel better!
Dan, Plui, Guy, and Jason left around 6 am. We (dan and I) dropped off Pat
and his friends off at  the hotel and we went home. I was sooo tired, but
I only got 2 hours sleep because I had to go pick up Doug at the airport.
Inhuman and the WunderVan crew were still here and they were geting ready
for Leah's bbq. I realized that I almost forgot to pick up Mike W. at the
airport. So I rushed into the car, picked up mike, went back tp my place
to pick up two more people and went to Leah's. I would like to mention the
oh so wonderful parking job that someone did in front of Leah's (ya know
you you are:)   It was nice to see everyone at the party. There were lots
of people.Even a couple of people who just came from Penelope's Web appeared.
any way a couple people went back to my place to rest up and we went to
the FMR. It was weird that all of a sudden 10 car were lined up behind us.
The worst thing was the car ahead of us was REALLY SLOW!. That is when I
fell asleep. I admit the space was great! The weather was perfect! Too bad
they didn;t let us stay
for the sunrise. I must admit though, there are a lot of people going to
the FMR's, at least the first space. It looked like over 1200 people maybe
even more. Hmm. Brian, did you count cars this time? 
Anyway I fell asleep again in the car. I woke up once and awhile to give
directions to person who was driving. I was bummed that I didn't see all
the ravers in the car pool lane though. I remeber waking up and we were
parked pretty close up to the site, but I fell back sleep. I am glad
everyone had fun. I had fun sleeping:) I should get more sleep:)

Seems like the last 3 FMRs happened in places too far away and too
hassle-full for someone like me to want to attend. and then to rub salt
into the wound, they end up relocating to Candlestick or the Berkeley
Marina. 

Is there any way someone lazy like me could find out that the FMR has
been moved to the marina/candlestick? (e.g. a voice mail box?) That
way, I could wake up bright and early in the morning, make that 10-20
minute drive, and avoid the late-night hassle-fests that FMRs have
become. Suggestions? Or has the FMR been relegated to those hardcore
enough to put up with all the bullshit?

I don't know  -- perhaps I'm spoiled -- the FMRs last summer up near
Pinole (Cummings Skyway Exit off of 80 North) are the way FMRs should
be... They started early, ran all night, attracted little or no police
attention, had vibe galore, drew critical mass, the music rocked, and
were generally about as perfect as a rave can get.

If FMRs nowadays were started earlier (1-2AM) and in reasonable
locations, there'd be a good chance of generating that instantaneous 
critical mass that may make the cops just decide that it would be too
much of a hassle to break up. Also, I would imagine that if cops came
across hundreds of people in a huge dancing ritual, they might think
that less criminal activity is occuring, as compared to hundreds of
people sitting in their cars with stereos blasting, drinking 40's and
doing drugs while waiting for the FMR to happen.

	Arg. No, its cool. I'm selling my modem. I need money. It's a Dual
Standard and I'm getting a lot for it. So, I will be offline for a little
while. But I want to meet ALL of you. I've probably met some people here
before unwittingly... So, I live in Santa Cruz so it's kinda hard for me
to go the lunch. But I very well might head up to it. And I will be at
YSH unless something dreadful happens to me between now and then... So, as
things work I'm sure I'll meet more of you. 

	addendum
	--------

	This list is a very good thing. It and the people are on it are
one of things that got me interested in raving and finding out more about it.
Raving has changed my life in ways that are both wonderful and indescribable.
Thankyou Brian for running sfraves, and keep running it. Thank you all for
giving me much interesting stuff to read. So as I say farwell electronicly,
maybe I will continue to meet some of you in person.

After enjoying a fine evening of socializing and dining at Leah's BBQ in
Berkeley (many thanks to Leah for hosting this HOT event!!!), I and the three
Canadian guys (eh?) journeyed to Cindy's place to chill for a while.  The
Twin Peaks locale provided us with a spectacular view of the Bay as well as
an observation platform for the big fire down in the Mission.  A couple of
B-Movies also served as momentary diversions.

About 1:30 a.m. we took off (eh?) for the Point Reyes site, following a car
with Cindy, Danarchy, and Dan's friend (Rich?).  Thanks to an enormous detour
off Highway 1 in the City (Cindy, do you *really* know your way around? :) ),
we doubled, if not tripled, our time just getting to the GG Bridge.  Was this
an omen?

Not!  As soon as we got out of the city lights and into Marin, we started
looking up in the sky; these guys were psyched for the FMR, and it quickly
rubbed-off on me!  For the longest time it was just Cindy 's car, my car, and
this other car full of ravers (in reverse order) driving along the twisting
and turning road.  Then as we came close to the site, a bunch of cars started
backing-up behind us (not MY fault, I was following that OTHER car).  At a
particular crest of a hill, we looked back and saw this big, long line of
headlights behind us.  It looked like a brilliant snake winding through the
dark mountains!  Whoa!!

There must have been several "snakes" moving through the mountains that
night; once we arrived at about 3:15, it appeared that others came in similar
caravans.  While Cindy and Dan napped in their car (sleepy heads!), we caught
up with Brian, Fluid, Fran, Susie, Sarah, Greg, Ben and his friend John, and
others (sorry, I'm still learning everyone's names).  The parking lot scene
reminded me of the last FMR: lots of people hanging around cars with their
stereos pounding, others cruising around,...the psshht of the nitrous tanks. 
This time however, the pounding of the waves replaced the firecracker
explosions--creating a much mellower vibe.  Around 4 the park rangers arrived
in two trucks, saying "The park is closed.  Get in your cars and leave
immediately!"  Of course, no one heeded their order.  Even more hilarious
were a group of about eight people who were wildly dancing to music from
their car stereo right in front the park rangers' headlights--they just kept
going!!

I, Sarah, and John decided to go down to the beach a short while later and
saw that the sound system was up and running.  The volume was not as loud as
the last FMR, and only half the folks were dancing at that point; the others
were standing around or sitting at fires.  As soon as everyone figured-out
that it was finally happening, the vibe picked-up and everyone got into it. 
I'm guessing that peak number of people down on the beach was a little under
the population at the last FMR.  (Did anyone ever get an official count at
that one?)

Apparently (someone correct me if I'm wrong) the party got off to a late
start because the equipment van was held up in search of a turntable.  I
guess they never found it, since they only had one at the site!  So, this led
to some breaks in the music, but everyone seemed to wait patiently until they
flopped-on another piece of vinyl and cranked up the volume.  The sheriffs
eventually showed up (I counted three cars in the lot), and some authority
caused the music to cease around 5 a.m.  The crowd was rather rebellious
(somebody yelled out something about power in numbers), but the dj's didn't
want to make any waves (pun intended) so they moved the party to the Berkeley
Marina.

By that time, the sun was dawning.  People slowly broke up, but many remained
around fires and others (myself included) stood there watching the changing
colors in the sky.  Cindy's car and my car left about the same time (my group
decided to call it a morning, so someone else will have to report on the
Berkeley happenings).  The winding drive back was very ambient, with views of
the fog over the lagoon and the now-visible forests...and an occasional raver
car pulled over for a "relief" stop (didn't they see the restrooms at the
beach?).  We also had fun waving to all the early morning workers that were
waiting at the bus stops.  I guess they got even with me:  after dropping-off
those guys from the North in SF,  I wasenveloped by traffic on my way home to
Sunnyvale.

Overall, it was sweet.  Thanks to all for a memorable experience!

Yeah, tell me about it ...  I was driving up with Monica and John and we
did the same damn thing!  And we were coming from the Tenderloin, so we
easily could have gone the other way ...  there were even signs all over
Geary saying "ROUTE 1 DETOUR ROUTE 1 DETOUR ROUTE 1 DETOUR" but of course
I ignored them ...  and to top it off we got lost again at that tricky
Rte. 1 / Sir Francis Drake interchange.  We were in front of a whole line
of cars and naturally they all followed us as we got lost going the
wrong way on Bear Valley Rd ...

But the terrain was just indescribably beautiful, both at Pt. Reyes
and coming back (we took Rte. 1 all the way to 101).  If only it had
lasted longer at Pt. Reyes ...

I had a strange encounter at the Marina; as I was walking back to my
car, I passed a guy (non-raver it seemed) lying there on the grass,
and as I walked by, he said "fuck you" to me, for no particular reason.
Normally I would have just ignored him, but I was really tired and
my brain wasn't working too well, so I said "fuck you too" and kept
walking.  He jumped up and trailed after me about 20 ft. behind for
quite awhile, saying "You wanna say that again?  Come back and say it
to my face!  I'll fucking kick your ass in!"  Thankfully I had enough
presence of mind to not freak out too much and keep walking and ignore
him.

I kinda agree with Lee on the subjective experience trip.  If someone so
blatantly aknowledges the reasons for their positive or negative experience
than the rest of us can take that into account.

I've noticed a sharp increase in this sort of behavior in tha last
month or so. Whole gobs of babblers make loud proclamations from bus
stops. Insane people walking into record shops randomly harrassing
customers, then leaving.

But then again, I have been working a lot lately which means I haven't
been out much...so perhaps i just haven't noticed the way reality
really is.

Anyways, "Thela Hun Ginjeet" is an anagram for "Heat in the Jungle" and
I was thinking, this is a dangerous place....

I *just* missed catching Cin on vrave after returning from Penelope's --
I mean literally by 3 minutes or something.  Hoping beyond hope to catch
a ride, but I guess it was not to be.  I'm still waiting to get to a
fullblown FMR and ride the whole wave.  Also didn't make it to leah's
(sean's car was full), but it's just as well because we had to take care
of business cleaning up at Penelope's . . . *speaking* of which . . .
hey, we missed you net.ravers a *lot* up there!  As you've heard, thopse
of us who went up are lobbying hard to fix that by bringing everyone
together at the same site.  I'll have a longer post laying out my
conception of it later, but I just thought I'd throw that in!

Anyway, looks like overall it was a good weekend for almost everyone.

Hi gang! it's that time again! time to order a vrave badge of course!

Okay, the design on the front is early 80s subway grafitti saying "V-RAVE".
and the whole word is resting on a spiderweb-like net which has been shaded
with microdot shading.  There is paint dripping down the letters and there are
a few orbs resting on the net.
The back design features a funky 3-d texture in the background.  The word
"addict" drawn in the style of the phunky dead cartoonist Vaughn Bode and
a mushroom-like arrow draw your attention down to your name or userid in a
Raster font. Underneath your name is the address for VRAVE and underneath that
it says "Get caught in the net."  Both the front and the back are hand drawn
designs.

Included is a split ring and a 30" ball chain.

Colors for the front are (choose one):

White  Yellow  Orange  Salmon

The backs of the badge are gray scaled.

To get your badge, email me your color preference, what you would like on the
back, and your postal address.

Then, *MAIL* me $4 cash check or money order at this address:

Meddling Kids c/o JP3
89 Home Ave.
Prov, RI 02908

and I will send you the badge asap. :)

Anyone interested in any other badges Meddling Kids makes or if you want to
just chat, email me, okay?

Stay fresh, kids!

JP3 aka Speed Racer aka Joe

Oh, and please feel free to forward this info to any lists or people i may have
missed!  thanks!! :)

Yeah, I didn't mean to sound like you should consider yourself the Siskel and
Ebert of raves when you go out to dance.  All I meant to imply was that we
should try to avoid "the rave sucked because I was so tired and the drugs
weren't kicking in" conundrum.  Raves are the ultimate subjective experience,
so true, you can't pull your state of mind out of the picture - but try and
be careful when pinpointing the reasons behind your state of mind, is all I
ask....

I think the biggest factor was that they hadn't seen it - I know
I probably wouldn't have done it either, not because I don't trust 
the people involved, but just because I want to see a place before I
think about bringing several hundred people to it (especially that
far away).

Had they arrived earlier and had both turntables, and had someone gone
up to talk to the police from the moment they arrived, I think the Pt. Reyes
party would have stayed.  For the 2 1/2 hours of music at Pt. Richmond
last month I was insanely happy.... I dunno, there's something about
free parties that's more than simply being $20 richer.  :)

   Being from the east coast and visiting san francisco i just wanted
to say something about the FMR that just happened on sunday.

   It was one of the most amazing experiences. I got in sunday morning
(thanx cindy for the pickup) and that night after a gettogether at
leah's off to the FMR location about 50 north of s.f.

  it was located on this beach in the middle of nowhere. drove up in
the wundervan and got  to the location. it was an amazing spot, 
on a beach, a full moon in the nightsky. but was even more amazing
were all the cars, and cars, and cars!!
  there mustve been over 1500 people there and they had all found out
by word-of-mouth just like four hours beforehand.
  The whole time we were at the location i just sat there amazed to
see all these people there. It is just impossible for something like
this to happen out on the east coast, but here in san francisco
it was happining.
  the first location though got busted, and there wasnt music cause
there was only one t-table. but after the rangers came to try and 
bust it, a mix tape was put on to try and get people dancing but
the rangers busted it by pulling the plug from the speaker. 
  Someone yelled "Were taxpayers. were your bosses" The officer
replied "We want a raise."  :)
  so with the first place busted it was moved to the berkeley marina,
directly across the bay from san  francisco. The music went on there
with Markie Mark playing an interesting set (up and down) for like
three hours then garth with an excellent set. It was beautiful.
the people were great and it had been a LONG time since i have felt
a vibe like was present during the FMR. people there most improtantly
to dance to the music. Its been a while since ive felt anything like
that on the e-coast. (perhaps dante's relevation in nyc last dec.is 
the closest vibe to it (i think it was relevation :))
  but all i can really say is WOW!!! the FMR was a great experience.
to all sfravers thanks for letting me just expereience a little of 
the vibe out here.

peace

(I must admit I feel awkward about posting this, so if I offend anyone
please blame it on Brian B. because he suggested it :-) )

Anyway, I've talked to a bunch of you over email and vrave, and so a lot
of you know I am coming out for a visit at the end of August.  I'm really
excited about meeting as many of you as possible, so come to Your Sister's
House on *AUGUST 26th*.  I spoke to Liz on the phone today, and I am going
to be spinning there that night.  So just look for the short unfamiliar
blonde in a flowered dress (my usual indoor dance outfit).  I'll be either 
behind the tables putting down some German acid trax, or you can just find
Brian and I'll be about 2 inches away from wherever he happens to be :-) .

Looking forward to putting REAL people with all those email addresses and
vrave handles,

Love and community,

Laura

Getting this party together was a nightmare - the place it was  
finally held in was the 6th space for the party.  The first five had  
said yes and then backed out, the final backing out occuring on  
saturday at 11:30...So it wound up in a loft off of miluwakee ave,  
where the "el" train tracks were right against the building, at the  
exact same hieght as the space (third floor), which actually caused  
a neat effect (the train shook the back part of the building as it  
went by, and it sent flashes of electronic sparks through the  
windows (i.e. CTA provided lighting without even knowing! :)   
Anyways on with the review - off with the bullshit....The Space was  
one small intamite dance floor, wi th the dj's in front, a viper  
laser (supplied by Acid Boy, Todd P.! Thanks!) coming over their  
heads, another viper facing the dj's, and a film loop.  

For once - everything seemed to go perfect - the sound was set up  
and ready by 10, phil had shown up to start spining, their was a  
group of people waiting to get in, the lights were up, wounderful - 

I'll leave most of the description of the party out because I was  
busy and didn't have much time to watch things: but everyone I  
talked to said that the party was great - and I could defientally  
feel the energy level of the party even from outside the building -  
This one girl came up to me in the morning (I had seen her at every  
party since december but had never spoke with her) with a big ass  
grin on her face, hugged me, said this was the best party I ever  
went to and then left - It was one of those kind of evenings - as I  
walked around I didn't see anyone who looked dissapointed or unhappy  
- there was the flow in the room - it was happening - and I am proud  
of those Chicagoians for coming together to form such a great spirit  
at an event.  My favorite part of the evening was at about 3:30 to  
4:00 (the party went to 6) I don't know who was DJing because I got  
so caught up in this moment - just before this there was almost  
noone on the dance floor - I went outside for a bit to check on  
security, etc... and I get back and everyone in the party was up and  
bumping (about 80) at 4 in the moring the whole party just exploded  
- everyone was grining and I got a chance to get out there and have  
fun for a half hour - it was an amazing feeling.  I am very happy  
about the way things turned out - I'd like to thank you all for your  
comments, suggestions, and support - hopefully things are starting  
to come together in Chicago.

I would like to thank everyone for their comments about my post -  
they all touched me very deeply - thank you.  


Let me tell a little story - 


When I first started going to raves, I loved the music and the  
atmosphere, the vibe, etc, everything - but at first I felt  
disconnected from that - I could feel, but I could not touch - I felt  
like an outsider that even though people were friendly - and I could  
see the vibe - that I wasn't apart of it - that it was seperate from  
me and I had no Idea how to get in touch with that flow.  Maybe this  
was because the first 3 parties I ever went to I went with 3 people  
who also had never gone to any parties - we stumbled onto the scene  
by accident - but that is another story for another day - Anyways, at  
every party I danced all night long - but I never met anybody - and  
even though I could feel the energy, flow, and vibe - I still felt  
seperated from it - because I really wasn't a part of it - it was me  
alone in a vast pile of energy (and in fact the third party I ever  
went to I hadn't slept in three days (I've been plauged with insomnia  
alot in this life) and I was so dead and tired but when I got to the  
party about 11:00 I started dancing - and danced non-stop until 8am)  
and I could draw energy from it - but I felt like I was disconnected  
from it - its a hard feeling to describe - I was but I wasn't -  
anyways, the fourth time I went to a party, I wasn't feeling very  
good about myself that day - and this girl gretchen must of noticed -  
but she smiled at me, said hi - and then walked away - it wasn't much  
that little gesture made me start to feel a part of everything -  
after that I started meeting people - helping create the vibe etc,  
etc, and eventually throwing parties - the point of this whole little  
splurge is that I don't know if I would be going to parties right now  
if it word for those two letters one cold december night, I've given  
up alot for the rave scene - I stayed in chicago this summer just for  
the rave scene - I haven't seen my parents or my friends from home  
since march because of all of this; but the experience has been worth  
it - raves have change the way I view the world, the way I live my  
life, the way I communicate to other people, the way I think, the way  
I see, the way I treat others - i.e. every aspect of my life - I'm  
not sure I would have experienced these changes - which have truly  
benefited my life (I am alot more satisfyed with myself, and alot  
happier now than ever before) - without gretchen - and now I hope I  
can enable others to experince these things too.

--Kurt

P.S.  I would like to thank Mike, Jen, Damian, Todd, and Mike for  
coming out this weekend - always nice to see some other net.ravers

I've read Kurt's messages and they really did touch me.  Unfortunatly, my
experience was somewhat different.  I mean, music has always been the most
important thing in my life.  I'm a singer/performer and have been since I
was about 4.  My first rave was before I even knew what techno was.  I
went to Masquerave with a group of my friends [or at least they were then]
from MUDs, and a group I didn't know.  The thing that clinched going was
Tedwards@wam who described how his technopagan beliefs came to be in the
rave itself and such....with my Wiccan past that was very appealing and
I went.  It was the most amazing, most religious experience I've ever had!
I must have tranced for about 2 entire hours! The people were all so close
together that it was like one single unit throbbing to this inner beat and
I wasn't one person anymore I was the rhythm....and the beat...and the
lights...and I was lifted and spun and I was in heaven.  Afterwords, we
walked out into the world....the real one....and I was empty, I'm sure you
all [those of you who've read this far] know what I'm trying to say.  The
music carried me...the beat was my heartbeat [Hence why I say "Rhythm
becomes Heartbeat"] and without the beat and the msuci I was empty,
without a heart or a soul.  This feeling lasted about 3 hours.  What's my
point in telling you that?  Well, now it's different.  I don't enjoy them
as much as I did.  Now it's who's spinning and who'll be there, and don't
forget your badge, they'll confiscate your highlighter, police will keep
you in custody if you have an athsma attack.....I mean....it just doesn't
feel as free to me.  Well, at the time I was in love....[with the scene I
mean] and then came Defcon 1.....well, I won't go over that, but after
Defcon, I ddin't rave until Sunshine.....a 7 month break.  Sunshine
brought me back, thanx to Doug, Susie and all the Ne and DC ravers, it was
one of the most amazing experiences.  It got me back...and here I
am....raving around.....but I've lost some of it...I;'ve lost the fear and
excitement.  Expand in Balto. brought me back to my normal high for awhile.
That was the first time I heard Scott Hardkiss play!!!!!!!!  He started
with a slow tribal beat and brought it and me higher and higher till we
climaxed together and the word trance couldn't even describe my state.....
I want to find that again.  That high, that surge and love and feeling of
completness.  And that's my story...okay, so it was a little longer than I
had hoped.  I hope no one's upset with that.  And there's my story.

		See ya in heaven,

			Melanie

many.

I hope to see you all there!

as you must be right nearby ...

According to some pals, Recycled is gonna be at the CONCOURSE tonight,
apparently it's someone's birthday or something.  It's supposed to be
rocking...I went to Housing Project last week and it was very sparsely
attended, ostensibly 'cuz Recycled was so dope.  

I won't be there, though (sigh)...went to FreeLife and the new Progress, both
hopping somewhat weeklies down here in San Jose.  Actually freeLife is
fantastic...every other Monday at FX, and  Progress is going off-- 
Djs are Julius and Rick Preston with the following guests:
August 10th - Harry Who
August 17th - Carlos
August 24th - Spun
August 31st - Shon

It's a cool time.  If you are in the South Bay, support these events!  The
scene down here is small, but good and tight.    Oh for the calendar..
Progress  - (408) 236-2284, (415) 267-6971
FreeLife - Every other monday at FX on first street
Both in downtown San Jose.
Okay, enough promotion.  

Basics went off, by the way.  Great party.  Cool space.  the next one should be
rocking as well.  

See everyone at Groove Kitchen!

Hello Folks!

 The next World Science Fiction convention , commonly called Worldcon , 
is coming to San Francisco on the Labor Day weekend . The name of this 
year's Worldcon is ConFrancisco. I've been trying to arrange a special 
birds-of-a-feather meeting with the ConFrancisco committee , and it 
looks like my efforts have succeeded!

 My meeting is set for Sept. 3rd , Friday afternoon, from 3PM to 5PM. 
The meeting is meant for people who are both "fen"  and ravers! ( The 
term "fen" means fans of science fiction and fantasy ). I want it be an 
opportunity for folks from all over the world to compare the experiences 
of raving and SF&F fandom . " Can fen dance to techno/house ? Can ravers 
read anything more complex than party flyers ? "

 I am also arranging for sound system support , and I'll probably be 
able to play music from cassettes and CDs , to give the attendees an 
idea of the type of music that our local DJs put out.

 => Where I need help from my fellow SFRavers - I would like to show 
videotapes and slides of local raves , and would appreciate the loan of 
same from anybody on the mail list. I already have the Connection II and 
the FMR videotapes - are there any available from the Richmond Civic 
Center events ? Also , for completeness sake , Toon Town or Cyberfest?

	I'm rather interested in making it to YSH tomorrow, and maybe
meeting a few sfravers while I'm there..
	If someone from the south bay (I'm staying in Los Gatos) would
be willing to lend me a ride to/from the event, I'd appreciate it greatly.
I'd be able to throw in some dollars for gas & the like, etc.
	Either mail me with a phone number or call 408-358-2007
tomorrow.. (I may be out.. in that case please leave a message [the
answering machine says Bob Cain.. that's the friend with whom I'm
leeching couch-space])
	Thanks greatly!

	Peace, Love, & raves,

Wow, it is a very small world.  I have been fairly actively involved in SF
Fandom  (the kingdom of fans, or fens) since 1978 and know many of the
committee folks who are putting on this event.  I have already offered to be
the liaison to the House Movement (rave scene) in San Francisco, and plan to
do that by being a guide...  It appears that great minds think alike.  :)  I
will be attending the convention and would like to work with you on this
panel/topic...   P.S.  I contacted the committee about 'somehow turning
science fiction fans on to parties' many months ago...  this is far out!

Well I decided to make a stupid post to sfraves, because I cannot sleep
and I am bored. Sorry for the junk mail. Doug and I were at BPM today when
we saw Jeno. Yay he smiled!!!! It was nice. He should it more often or
maybe he should dance., but not the Garth.. Well I spent lots of money on 
records. I am poor. I am really looking for Air Liquid on vinyl still.:(.
And Doug got that "raise your hands" song in my head, which is X-Press 2
London Express. :P Anyway I am still looking for old cool records that are
hard to find now:P Someday I will find them.:I

Ohmigod!

A lot of SF conventions I've been to have a dance of some sorts, but I
was never able to get into the music. But OH WOW! next time I am
bringing my favorite mix tape! They'll love it! Oh wow I just can't
wait to do this :). A lot of conventioneers have never heard house
music. Oooo oooo.

        Reply to:   RE>> M U S I C !!!

greetings, all.

speaking of music . . . just talked to my rep at Formula in New York a couple
days ago:  she's sent me two new releases -- the new Orbital and an ffrr (full
frequency range recordings) compilation tape (we're rockin' the Wired warehouse
with 'em even as i write).

also, Orbital is just winding up a UK tour called "Midi-Circus," and are
planning a similar tour in the US with other artists within the same
ambient/house circles.  keep your eyes and ears peeled; the Midi-Circus ship
should be landing on our continent sometime in the second or third week of
august.

also, before i sign off, a "heads up" on a few more releases soon to be out: 
U96, "Replugged" -- September; VapourSpace, "Gravitational Arch of 10" --
September; One Dove, (not sure of the title yet) -- October.

don't know if we'll be able to break away from impending deadlines long enough
to check YSH tonight, but do some raving for us in case we can't make it.  (if
we do show up, i'll be the one with long dark purple hair and really short
bangs.)  L8R!

peace,

Well I'm finally home again after my west coast excursion.  Just wanted to
say thanks to all the sfravers for their friendliness and hospitality
(esp. Leah & Cindy for lodging).  You all have a terrific scene out there
and a terrific city in general.  Don't take it for granted!  :)

Just a brief review of all the events I went to so you can see an
east-coaster's perspective on things:

Ben & Dan met me, Kreig, and Jason at the airport in LA and we drove
straight to SF,hoping to catch some of Unity.  It took us a hell of a
long time (11 hours), because we were in the overloaded Wundervan which
couldn't seem to get above 50-55 mph.  We finally got to Unity around
6am.  It was worth it!  We danced for an hour or so until it ended.  I
wish we could have gotten there earlier, but getting in for free was also
nice.

Next was Tilt-A-Whirl on Monday night.  This was a fiasco from the
beginning.  We parked in the vague vicinity of the address hoping to find
it by foot.  We immediately ran into another group of people also trying
to find it.  Someone from the group came up to us and said "I'm tripping
hardcore man, but I think I know where it is.  Follow me!"  With a
reasonable amount of trepidation, we followed behind him.  He lead us all
over the place and finally to the club where Tilt-A-Whirl was.  It turned
out it was two blocks from our car and we had gone in this big U-shaped
path.  :)  When we finally did get inside there were only like ten people
there, maybe two of which were dancing.  Damn.  The DJ was playing some
mediocre house music.  One of the two people dancing was this guy who
looked like the lead singer of the Spin Doctors doing the I'm-on-acid
shuffle.  We danced for a little bit and then the second DJ came on.  The
BPM dropped by about 20 as he put on some real old school electro Beat
Street Electric Avenue type music.  This completely cleared the
dancefloor except for the Spin Doctors guy.  Then about five minutes into
the set the Spin Doctors guy GOES CRAZY!  He starts break-dancing,
spinning on his shoulders and stuff.  It was hilarious and incredible,
because he was the last guy there who anyone would expect to start
breakdancing.  We eventually left when it was clear that this wasn't where
it was at that night.

We spent the next couple of days and nights exploring San Francisco and
Berkeley.  Finally on Thursday night we headed to Your Sister's House.  I
was really looking forward to this because I'd heard so much about it.  We
got there around 9:30, in time for some of the discussion.  I like the
concept of having a round-table discussion before raving, but this just
sort of exceeded my hokeyness-meter.  People were taking themselves a
*little* too seriously.  One woman said "What were doing right here, we
could be executed for it!  It's treason!  The government is violently
afraid of this kind of discussion!"  Nevertheless, it was interesting and
any kind of discussion is a step in the right direction.  Once the music
got going and more people came, the party got moving.  It was a lot of fun
and the music was great.  It just goes to show you don't need to be Jeno
or Garth to totally move a crowd.  The last DJ spun a really good hard
acid set, too!  I was entirely surprised.  I had left my love for that
kind of music on the east coast, thinking I wouldn't need it in SF.  But
everyone was digging it (including me).  The night would have been perfect
had things not ended so badly for us: The Wundervan got broken into.  They
took Dan's banjo & traveller's checks & his vinyl 70's-style jacket.  It
was such a weird thief.  He didn't even take my backpack or the camera
which was right next to the traveller's checks.

On Saturday we headed to Basics.  When we first got there, things felt
real strange.  I couldn't really get into it.  I kept wandering around
from place to place, feeling like Carlos Casteneda trying to find "his
spot."  Finally after the place started to clear out a bit, I got into
Markie's set a bit and started moving.  When Tony came on, he set me into
a frenzy.  After maybe ten minutes of Tony's set, I started getting this
sharp pain in my toes.  I stopped dancing and set down and took off my
shoes to see what it was.  I had these two big blisters, one on each of my
middle toes.  And they had already popped.  Ouch.  I was really upset
because I really wanted to dance to Tony's incredible set.  I wandered
around and eventually found some gaffer's tape and bound up my toes.  It
felt much better and I kept on dancing.  Yay!  After that, I didn't want
to rest even though the outdoor chill space was way cool.  We finally left
sometime in the morning.  It was cool how they gave away free fruit in the
morning, too.  A fun party, once things got going.

I slept most of the day Sunday, in preparation for the FMR, our last night
in San Francisco.  First was Leah's lovely barbeque, though.  After that,
with the Wundervan loaded to capacity, we headed up to the FMR site.  It
was a beautiful drive.  We finally got there around 3:00, I think.  You
know the rest of the story with that site.  It was still an incredibly
beautiful site and just being there with all these other people was fun
enough, even if there wasn't any music.  We got lost on the way back to
Berkeley and didn't get to the Marina until 8:30 (a three hour drive).
Once things finally got moving, we danced and danced.  Markie spun a long
long set.  Three hours.  Wow.  It had its ups and downs, but we were all
happy when Garth finally came on.  We left around 2pm, but the party was
still going strong, with joggers occaisionally wandering by to dance.  It
was a fun last day in SF.

The 12 hour drive back down to LA was awful.  It was hot as hell and the
Wundervan's heating was broken so we couldn't shut off the heat.  Ugh!  We
finally made it to Joachim's around 3.  (Thanks Joachim!)

All in all, it was a very fun trip.  Thanks to all those who made it so.
I think my next ticket will be one-way.  Give me a couple years...

Hi everybody!

Tonight again, Your Sisters' House is the main attraction.  I'm not
sure about Friday, maybe Mission Rock is your best bet again.  
Corduroy City is new, don't know how it went last week.  I think
Francesco on KZSU Tuesday said there would be a Gathering on Friday,
but there's no message on the Gathering line (415.267.4800).

Saturday, Groove Kitchen returns with a strong lineup of underrated
DJs, the Fridge opens at Big Heart City, and Where the Wild Things Are
could be fun too, but avoid it if it's at 16th & Harrison :) ...

Hi Kyle,

Well, looks like this has evolved and mutated into FreeVibe!!! :-) It's
free, lot's of people in the community will contributing their time and
energy.  This will be a dress rehearsal for the next FMR. I've done up the
flyers and we're gonna do it Saturday, Aug. 7.   The info line is 726-8077.
We're in the process of setting up the logistics.  So far, we have Pete
Ashdown, Donald Glaude (aka Dominator aka Steve Austin), Brad Shaw,
Dervish, on the DJ line up.  If you want to spin or know anyone else let me
know.  

Tigger

I cross posted to sfraves cuz I thought that you sfravers might be
interested in seeing what kind of trouble Pete's getting himself into up
here in the great north west!  :-)   Peace y'all!!  Also, hi and hugz to
Wigli Boy (Greg), Renee, and Pat Lui, who are all in the Bay Area!!!

I'm not a lawyer (although i play one on tv), but seattle cops have never
really liked the "rave" scene as you probably know.  The city would
probably do anything they can to stop us once they saw a soundsystem being
set up with a bunch of people around.
Like it or not, this is going to be a renegade party like the last one! 
The best we can do is look for a spot where cops won't find us & neighbors
won't complain. btw- where is the Garcia concert?  IMHO, i don't think
there will be tons of people in the parking lot ready to dance around to
some tunes.
If your willing to drive about 20 minutes east of Seattle, I know of a
spot that would work pretty good- it was one we were considering for the
fmr a month and a half ago.  what day is this scheduled for?  
hope this turns out good!

	From looking at the media of the tapes (nice music,so far, as
I'm listening to it right now..) I noticed that it's black, thus it's
not a normal bias tape. But the case doesn't have the indicator on it
so a deck which auto-detects high bias based on the indicator (such as
the one it's playing on right now) will assume the tape is normal bias
and sound quality apparently suffers. (I haven't had time to compare
with a manual-switch deck, as I just picked upthe tapes today.)
	While this doesn't really matter to *me* as my own deck
doesn't auto-detect, (my own deck really sucks and doesn't even do
dolby decoding or bias adjustment.) is it possible to make the holes
with human tools? I've never tried it.. (for obvious reasons..) Maybe
someone knows how?
	(Nice tapes, even still.)

	Peace,

they are BASF Chrome + (cobalt) tape.  they are professionally
duplicated.  as is the case with many high quality pro-dup tapes,
(starting with "The Police -- Synchronicity" way back in the mid 80s,
the first major release on chrome tape) the tape is specially
formulated to playback as normal bias.  I.E. the lack of tape type
keyholes on the top is 100% correct.  (recording over storebought
tapes is always dumb, they aren't meant to be recorded on home
equipment, regardless of setting.)

for future reference, there are a few very dark type I tapes out
there, notably some Fuji and Denon formulations... so that's not a
reliable indicator generally.

imho and from my experience selling the tapes, the sound quality
should be very high, if not, you've probably got dirty heads on the
deck.  clean and demagnetize the deck before you go punching holes in
the tape shells :-)

	I like the sound quality.. (But I don't have very fine ears,
so the only way for me to really tell if sound quality if suffering is
to compare with higher quality.)

What is the deal with the Come/Unity tapes?  I like them a lot, but they 
are obviously of lower quality than the C2 tapes.  Also, I can hear 
people cheering and stuff on them.  Were these recorded via a mic rather 
than a line out?

On the sampler synth side, the all-time bargain has to be the Gravis Ultrasound
PC soundcard... I'm currently writing a program that will run on an XT and over
with just a floppy (no monitor, no keyboard, just a Gravis) (total cost about
200$) and will make the XT+GUS run like a 32 channel sampler synth with full
sysex control. It will be comparable to an EPS-16+ with no effects (except
for reverb, chorus, flanger and echo) and will emulate the MT-32, SCC1, will
be General Midi and will accept new patches (with new samples) thru floppy or
thru sysex up to the 1Mb the GUS has. The program will be around 40$.

Some of the new console machines coming out this fall will have a
quantum leap in the rendering capability available in the sub-$1000
gear market.  I can't say much about the others, but the 3DO (plug,
plug) will be a great low-end machine for trippy visuals.  It's a
prime machine for video-audio linked color organ effects because
the DSP lets you sample the audio waveform continuously. I'm
already hacking up a math functions module that phases zonked
patterns, and it would be extremely easy to master audio tracks on
CD with this kind of display software matched to it.

Look forward to true VJ's (not MTV mannequins), pixel jocks scratching
trance visuals to match the mix the DJ is laying down.  Better yet,
be one.

Correct, but it doesn't matter, because *bias* is only used when
you're recording...

  Sameer> and sound quality apparently suffers. 

NO!  Because the deck will correctly play back at 120us equaliztaion.
Equaliztion essentially selects the frequency-response curve, which
should be the same for record and playback.  You should play the tape
back as an ordinary (type I) tape.  If you play it back as a Type II,
you'll select 70us bias, and lose high-frequency response.


  Sameer> is it possible to make the holes with human tools?


NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! 

Don't do this to your C2 tapes!  (Unless you intend to record over them!)

Gee, isn't anyone going to The Fridge with Simon, Jeno & Thomas?
I'm sure Groove Kitchen will be fun, but 174 King St. hasn't been
very friendly to us for some time now, and Together (the Fridge 
contingent on Tuesday nites) has been getting fantastic 
reviews.  Anyway, everyone have fun no matter what you do, and if
you want to make a donation toward the SFRaves GG Park party, I'll
probably be at The Fridge, and then maybe the tail end of Boogie Buffet
on Sunday.

 Literary Freeware -- Not for Commercial Use

 Speeches by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling
 National Academy of Sciences
 Convocation on Technology and Education
 Washington D. C.,  May 10, 1993

 BRUCE STERLING:

      Hello ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you for having the
 two of us here  and giving us a license to dream in public.

      The future is unwritten.  There are best-case
 scenarios.  There are worst-case scenarios.  Both of them
 are great fun to write about if you're a science fiction
 novelist, but neither of them ever happen in the real world.
 What happens in the real world is always a sideways-case
 scenario.

      World-changing marvels to us, are only wallpaper to our
 children.

      Cyberspace is the funhouse mirror of our own society.
 Cyberspace reflects our values and our faults, sometimes in
 terrifying exaggeration.  Cyberspace is a mirror you can
 edit.  It's a mirror you can fold into packets and send
 across continents  at the speed of light.   It's a mirror
 you can share with other people, a place where you can
 discover community.   But it's also a mirror in the classic sense
 of smoke-and-mirrors -- a place where you might be robbed
 or cheated or decieved, a place where you can be promised
 a rainbow but given a mouthful of ashes.

      I know something important about cyberspace.  It
 doesn't matter who you are today -- if you don't show up in
 that mirror in the next century, you're just not going to
 matter very much.  Our kids matter.  They matter a lot.  Our
 kids have to show up in the mirror.

      Today, we have certain primitive media for kids.
 Movies, television, videos.  In terms of their sensory
 intensity, these are like roller-coaster rides.  Kids love
 roller coasters, for natural reasons.  But roller coasters
 only go around and around in circles.  Kids need media that
 they can go places with.  They need the virtual equivalent
 of a kid's bicycle.  Training wheels for cyberspace.
 Simple, easy machines.  Self-propelled.  And free.   Kids
 need places where they can talk to each other, talk back and
 forth naturally.  They need media that they can fingerpaint
 with, where they can jump up and down and breathe hard,
 where they don't have to worry about Mr. Science showing up
 in his mandarin white labcoat to scold them for doing things
 not in the rulebook.  Kids need  a medium of their own.  A
 medium that does not involve a determined attempt by cynical
 adult merchandisers to wrench the last nickel and quarter
 from their small vulnerable hands.


      That would be a lovely scenario.   I don't really
 expect that, though.   On the contrary, in the future I
 expect the commercial sector to target little children with
 their full enormous range of on-line demographic databases
 and privacy-shattering customer-service profiles.  These
 people will be armed and ready and lavishly financed and
 there every day, peering at our children through a
 cyberspace one-way mirror.    Am I naive to expect better
 from the networks in our schools?  I hope not.  I trust not.
 Because schools are supposed to be educating our children,
 civilizing our children, not auctioning them off to the
 highest bidder.

      We need to make some conscious decisions to  reinvent
 our information technology as if the future mattered.  As if
 our children were human beings, human citizens, not raw
 blobs of potential revenue-generating machinery.   We have
 an opportunity to create media that would match the splendid
 ambitions of Franklin with his public libraries and his mail
 system, and Jefferson  and Madison with their determination
 to arm democracy with the power knowledge gives.  We could
 offer children, yes even poor children in poor districts, a
 real  opportunity to control the screen, for once.

      You don't have to worry much about the hardware.  The
 hardware is ephemeral.  The glass boxes should no longer
 impress you.  We've shipped our images inside glass boxes
 for fifty years, but that's a historical accident, a relic.
 The glass boxes that we recognize as computers won't last
 much longer.  Already the boxes are becoming flat screens.
 In the future, computers will mutate beyond recognition.
 Computers won't be intimidating, wire-festooned, high-rise
 bit-factories swallowing your entire desk.  They will tuck
 under your arm, into your valise, into your kid's backpack.
 After that, they'll fit onto your face, plug into your ear.
 And after that --  they'll simply melt.  They'll become
 fabric.  What does a computer really need?  Not glass boxes
 - -- it needs thread -- power wiring, glass fiber-optic,
 cellular antennas, microcircuitry.  These are woven things.
 Fabric and air and electrons and light.   Magic
 handkerchiefs with instant global access.   You'll wear them
 around your neck.  You'll make tents from them if you want.
 They will be everywhere, throwaway.  Like denim.  Like
 paper.  Like a child's kite.

      This is coming a lot faster than anyone realizes.
 There's a revolution in global telephony coming that will
 have such brutal, industry-crushing speed and power that it
 will make even the computer industry blanch.  Analog
 is dying everywhere. Everyone with wire and antenna is going
 into the business of moving bits.


      You are the schools.  You too need to move bits, but
 you need to move them to your own purposes.  You need to
 look deep into the mirror of cyberspace, and you need to
 recognize your own face there.   Not the face you're told
 that you need.   Your own face.  Your undistorted face.  You
 can't out-tech the techies.  You can't  out-glamorize
 Hollywood.  That's not your life, that's not
 your values, that's not your purpose.  You're not supposed
 to pump colored images against the eyeballs of our children,
 or download data into their skulls.  You are supposed to
 pass the torch of culture to the coming generation.   If you
 don't do that, who will?  If you don't prevail for the sake
 of our children, who will?

       It can be done!   It can be done if you keep your wits
 about you and you're not hypnotized by smoke and mirrors.
 The computer revolution, the media revolution, is not going
 to stop during the lifetime of anyone in this room.   There
 are innovations coming, and coming *fast,* that will make
 the hottest tech exposition you see here seem as quaint as
 gaslamps and Victorian magic-lanterns.   Every machine you
 see here will be trucked out and buried in a landfill, and
 never spoken of again, within a dozen years.  That so-called
 cutting-edge hardware here will crumble just the way old fax-
 paper crumbles.  The values are what matters.  The values
 are the only things that last, the only things that *can*
 last.  Hack the hardware, not the Constitution.   Hold on
 tight to what matters, and just hack the rest.

      I used to think that cyberspace was fifty years away.
 What I thought was fifty years away, was only ten years
 away.  And what I thought was ten years away -- it was
 already here.  I just wasn't aware of it yet.

      Let me give you a truly lovely, joyful example of the
 sideways-case scenario.

      The Internet.  The Internet we make so much of today --
 the global Internet which has helped scholars so much, where
 free speech is flourishing as never before in history -- the
 Internet was a Cold War military project.  It was designed
 for purposes of military communication in a United States
 devastated by a Soviet nuclear strike.  Originally, the
 Internet was a post-apocalypse command grid.

      And look at it now.  No one really planned it this way.
 Its users made the Internet that way, because they had the
 courage to use the network to support their own values, to
 bend the technology to their own purposes.  To serve their
 own liberty.  Their own convenience, their own amusement,
 even their own idle pleasure.  When I look at the Internet -
 - - that paragon of cyberspace today -- I see something
 astounding and delightful.  It's as if some grim fallout
 shelter had burst open and a full-scale Mardi Gras parade
 had come out.   Ladies and gentlemen, I take such enormous
 pleasure in this that it's hard to remain properly
 skeptical.  I hope that in some small way I can help you to
 share my deep joy and pleasure in the potential of networks,
 my  joy and pleasure in the fact that the future is
 unwritten.

 WILLIAM GIBSON:

      Mr. Sterling and I have been invited here to dream in
 public.  Dreaming in public is an important part of our job
 description, as science writers, but there are bad dreams as
 well as good dreams.  We're dreamers, you see, but we're
 also realists, of a sort.

      Realistically speaking, I look at the proposals being
 made here and I marvel.  A system that in some cases isn't
 able to teach basic evolution, a system bedevilled by the
 religious agendas of textbook censors, now proposes to throw
 itself open to a barrage of ultrahighbandwidth information
 from a world of Serbian race-hatred, Moslem fundamentalism,
 and Chinese Mao Zedong thought.  A system that has managed
 to remain largely unchanged since the 19th Century now
 proposes to jack in, bravely bringing itself on-line in an
 attempt to meet the challenges of the 21st.  I applaud your
 courage in this.   I see green shoots attempting to break
 through the sterilized earth.

      I believe that the national adventure you now propose
 is of quite extraordinary importance.  Historians of the
 future -- provided good dreams prevail -- will view this as
 having been far more crucial to the survival of democracy in
 the United States than rural electrification or the space
 program.

      But many of America's bad dreams, our sorriest future
 scenarios, stem from a single and terrible fact:  there
 currently exists in this nation a vast and disenfranchised
 underclass, drawn, most shamefully, along racial lines, and
 permanent feature of the American landscape.

      What you propose here, ladies and gentlemen, may well
 represent nothing less than this nation's last and best
 hope of providing something like a level socio-economic
 playing field for a true majority of its citizens.

      In that light, let me make three modest proposals.

      In my own best-case scenario, every elementary and high
 school teacher in the United States of America will have
 unlimited and absolutely cost-free professional access to
 long-distance telephone service.  The provision of this
 service could be made, by law, a basic operation requirement
 for all telephone companies.  Of course, this would also
 apply to cable television.

      By the same token, every teacher in everyy American
 public school will be provided, by the manufacturer, on
 demand, and at no cost, with copies of any piece of software
 whatever -- assuming that said software's manufacturer would
 wish their product to be commercially available in the
 United States.

      What would this really cost us, as a society?  Nothing.
 It would only mean a so-called loss of potential revenue for
 some of the planet's fattest and best-fed corporations.  In
 bringing computer and network literacy to the teachers of
 our children, it would pay for itself in wonderful and
 wonderfully unimaginable ways.  Where is the R&D support for
 teaching?  Where is the tech support for our children's
 teachers?  Why shouldn't we give our teachers a license to
 obtain software, all software, any software, for nothing?

      Does anyone demand a licensing fee, each time a child
 is taught the alphabet?

      Any corporation that genuinely wishes to invest in this
 country's future should step forward now and offer services
 and software.  Having thrived under democracy, in a free
 market, the time has come for these corporations to
 demonstrate an enlightened self-interest, by acting to
 assure the survival of democracy and the free market -- and
 incidentally, by assuring that virtually the entire populace
 of the United States will become computer-literate potential
 consumers within a single generation.

      Stop devouring your children's future in order to meet
 your next quarterly report.

      My third and final proposal has to do more directly
 with the levelling of that playing field.  I propose that
 neither of my two previous proposals should apply in any way
 to private education.

      Thank you.

I too am wondering why the quality of the Unity tapes is so low.  Apparently
they were recorded with DAT, but there must've been a mic hooked up, since the
crowd noise is so jacked up at times.  Although the music on the tapes is
really quite good, overall I'm pretty disappointed with the tapes' quality.


Negative thoughts aside, hope to catch some of you at either Mission Rock or 
Groove Kitchen this weekend.

they recorded to a multi-track deck, with a stereo pair direct from
the mixing board and a stereo mic setup to catch the crowd ambience.
i haven't heard the tapes yet but i think the idea of having crowd
ambience is pretty stupid.

i'll be at both, most likely!

So like after some sporadic dancing, see, I find a nice spot for
chilling, and this cat jumps right into my lap like he owns it,
stretches luxuriously, and looks at me with the expression: "Well?"

What can I say? I'm a mortal man. I pet the cat.

Susie drops by, and then we're really chillin', oozing through the
floor, just soaking up the good vibes, humans and cat, vibe and purr,
all going well.

There must be some law of nature that says the minute a cat falls
asleep in your lap, some disruptive force must come along that makes
you get up, spoiling the moment. In this case, that disruptive force
was Jan Cooley.

She started spinning this really high energy house set, which got
better and better. Before you know it, toes were tapping and heads
were nodding. Susie and I looked each other and I think we shared the
same thought: Sitting here during this music is criminal.

Wow! The dance floor was really moving. People were hopping and
jumping and jamming and grooving. What a vibe!

And then she played THE SONG. I heard it about 6 weeks ago during a
rave, and it's been going off and on in my head ever since. I've been
wanting to dance to it so badly! (I'll sing it for you sometime, maybe
you can tell me what it is.)

She played it! And I went off like a rocket, pushing the throttles to
the wall and jamming as hard as my body could go (I think I scared
Susie, party on :)). And everyone else was going wild too! Oh wow that
was so much fun.

And it didn't end there, Jan just kept on jammin with more and more
energy. She nearly killed me. I was begging for mercy :). What a set!
I had to take my shirt off or suffer a complete meltdown.

It was a good night. I got lots of smiles from people I didn't even
know, there was a great vibe, and of course you were there.

YSH has been and continues to be my favorite night of the week. For $5
one gets a really friendly event, a great vibe, and a chance to hear
women DJs spin a good variety of music.

I get up at 7:30am, work a 9 hour day, drive from Sacramento to SF, go
to YSH, drive back to Davis, get two hours sleep, and go back to work.
And every Friday morning I wonder to myself "Am I crazy?......" for
maybe 2 seconds :). Crazy is sitting at home wondering how much fun I
would've had if I'd gone.

"Well, son, a funny thing about regret is..."

Sean


PS - Nice meeting you S... S... the guy whose name I can't pronounce
right :). Hope to see you at the next event!

One of my tapes has some outright dropouts. I don't know if I did it,
or if it was something else, but all the music literally drops out for
seconds at a time.

If there's any choice in the matter for future tapes, I'd use the C2
tape "process". They do sound a lot better.

Just in case any of you have forgotten what a complete asshole Sen.
Jesse Helms is, let me repost the following from 8/5/93 SF examiner
(actually an AP story) of an exchange between Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun
and Sen. Jesse Helms.

"When Helms stepped into the elevator, she [Moseley-Braun] said "he saw
me standing there, and he started to sing 'I wish I was in the land of
cotton ...'  And he looked at Senator Hatch and said, "I'm going to
make her cry. I'm going to sing 'Dixie' until she cries."

"And I looked at him and said, "Sentator Helms, your singing would make
me cry if you sang 'Rock of Ages,'" said Moseley-Braun, an Illinois
Democrat and the Senate's only black.

 ...

Helms' press aide Eric Lundgren said, "It was a good natured
exchange... they all got a good chuckle out of it"....

 ...

Paul Smith, Hatch's press secretary, said the senator heard the
exchange and added, "They were kidding each other. it wasn't mean." The
aide acknowledged that singing "Dixie" to a black person could be
considered offensive, "unless you know Helms."

 ...

Last month Moseley-Braun succesfully led a fight on the Senate floor to
defeat an amendment to renew the United Daughters of the Confederacy's
patent on the Confederate flag insignia.

(I wish that shit-fer-brains Helms would just die, I really do!)

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

...
A few nights ago I was hanging out at a friend of mine's house.. a woman
who recently moved here from New York.We started talking about music and she
mentioned to me that her sister sings house music .. little did I know..

She put on a tape of her,
and I was absolutely amazed to hear the most
incredible voice..
This girl's 24 year old sister was incredible.. a wailing diva type with
a voice much like (and on a similar talent level to..) Lady Miss Kier of
Deelite.
I was floored..Although I'm not an expert on music..I know a good voice when 
I hear it..I couldn't beleive it when my friend said that her sister hasn't
ever been
successful in getting herself on plastic..(Evidently she's been approaching 
major record labels...not small independents..) So my thought in posting to
the music experts here on the list..was to ask if anyone knew any small record
labels which publish the classic house style of music..(beautiful female
vocals.. voice used as an instrument..) Maybye 
she just isn't sending her demo to the right kind of people..
Any ideas pop into mind?

	Yeah! Hope they don't think there are too few people, or too many,
	or too whatever else, as they did with Aurgasm 3 weeks ago :-(

	BTW: I really liked Aurgasm last week. It was in a very small
	wharehouse and there wern't soo many people (never more than 20
	people). The music was almost ambient and trance. The visuals were
	great (3 slide projectors directed on the walls and on the floor).
	And there was this big space with a black light and brush and colors
	and almost everybody left his sign (who painted sfraves@soda.... ? 
	I didn't meet you).
	So, I was not in the mood for a big rave and for a night of loudy
	hard/house/etc. music, and I really enjoyed to be there.

	And, hi everybody I meet yesterday at YSH (I don't list everyone,
	I know I can't beat your 20, Ben :-)
	Really good Rebecca's set: something different from the standard.
	And gourgeus Shoban's set: standard trance, but very high standard.
	Lucky me she played only for an hour / an hour and half, otherwise
	today I wouldn't be here to write this.

	Then, I had to leave at the beginning of Jan Cooley set, because I
	had to be at work quit early today (I was thinking the weekend started
	on thursday night, but...)


	So, see ya around this weekend (and than I will have a 2 weeks
	vacation - 2 weeks w/out YSH: how can I survive ? :-)

This is kind of personal, but you're all my friends, and my
experience might be of some benefit to others.

Over the last couple of weeks, I've developed quite a large
rash on my back and shoulders.  I went to the Doctor, and it turned
out to be a fungus, like athlete's foot, most likely resulting
from:

- spending too much time in sweaty shirts. (the heat wave didn't help)
- not showering immediately after sweating all night. (crashing instead)
- Depressed immune system. (lot's of work-related stress lately)
- Significant amount of body hair (nuff said)

It's no big deal and not terribly contagious (my wife Janie with whom
I've been in occasional physical contact with doesn't have it), but I'd 
be more comfortable if people refrained from hugging me this week.

The cure?  Soaking myself in Selsen Blue Shampoo has already been 
helping, but my doctor has prescribed a quicker cure.  What I'm 
supposed to do is eat a couple of pills and then within one 
hour, engage in some kind of strenuous sweat-inducing activity and *not* 
take a shower for at least 8 hours.  I assured her that I was capable
of doing this.  The medication is supposed to kill the fungus through 
my sweat.  If necessary, I have to repeat this in one week.

So basically, it looks like I am under doctor's orders to rave hard 
this weekend!  

As an aside, I got to meet my primary care physician for the first 
time yesterday.  She's with the Bayfair Women's Medical group in
SF.  What a place; entirely run by women, the doctors, receptionists -
with a truly warm and caring vibe - it was like the Medical Office 
version of Your Sister's House!  If only they could do something
about that waiting room music.

Also, my doctor views MDMA usage as a "lifestyle" choice and has 
patients who have used it over a long period of time.  Some of them
developed cases of depression due to fried serotonin receptors,
but her current view was that the stuff was no worse than doing 
alchohol or tobacco.

well, I produced the C2 tapes, and didn't produce the C/U tapes, so
that's obviously why they are inferior :-)

but seriously folks, the C/U tapes are on normal bias tape, so they
don't have as wide of a frequency range.  i also find that they
especially don't have a good bottom (bass) --- probably due to
aesthetic judgements made in the mastering process.  (also, i suspect
a compressor / limiter was somewhere in the signal path before the
recording equipment.)

C/U was recorded live to 8 track digital, with 2 tracks used for mics
and 2 tracks from the mixer line out.  in production, some of the
crowd noise was intentionally mixed in with the music.  i think it's a
pretty cool effect, lots of energy on the tape, but i personally
prefer straight mixing board tapes.

just a few notes to explain why they are what they are.  i try to make
it clear to people that the C/U tapes don't sound as good as the C2
tapes, but it's kind of hard to do that without coming off sounding
pompous.

Bring me your defective tapes, and if I can verify that there's a
problem, I'll exchange it for a new one.  (If I'm out, I can get you a
new one within a few days / at the next South Bay lunch or YSH.)

I've listened to one set all the way through, and it didn't have any
dropouts, and I've also listened to the DAT cassette production
masters, and they are fine.  It sounds to me like the duplication
house might have hit a bad spool of tape.

re: "C2 process" well, every tape I do is on chrome tape, and every
bin loop and DAT production master is verified by me before the tapes
are duplicated.  Chrome = better sound and verification = less chance
of quality problems.  "Better tapes --- you have my word on it!"  (sez

there is a prescription anorexic called fenfluramine taken by millions
of people around the world.  i've read that the same animal study 
methodology that shows mdma to be neurotoxic at "high" doses (higher
than moderate human recreational doses, adjusted for body weight) also
shows fenfluramine to be *more* neurotoxic on a dose equivalent basis,
and by [approx?] the same mechanism of action.  the same source says
there are no adverse neurological or behavioral effects reported to be
linked with human fenfluramine use as commonly prescribed.

one might conclude that fenfluramine, in its ordinarily prescribed
anorexic doses, is pretty safe, and that mdma, used in moderation, is
therefore at least as safe.

i would be very interested to hear if your neurologist friend has
contrary data on fenfluramine, or can explain how the conclusion above
might not be warranted by the evidence at hand.

I went to YSH last night and I had a blast.

The DJs were good, all of them. Rebecca and Jane (Jan?) were especially
good, but all of them were outstanding last night. They spun hard, they
spun loud, they spun frenetic and kinetic, get up off your ass kinda music.
And the vibe never stopped.

I ran into a few people I met out there (Hi, Susie, Louis!) and a few I
didn't (Hi, Monica, Starchild!). Seems that YSH has become the default SFR
hangout now. Yeah!

For the five bucks, you get it all. Being an unemployed Starving College
Student (tm), five bucks means something, and the YSH experience squeezes
every drop of entertainment and warmth it can out of every penny.

A definite three thumbs up!

A friend of mine and I did just what you describe at an event last
weekend called "SHARE."  We had 3DO (development box), CD-I
(model 180, development box), PC (Y/C video out SVGA), and a
Powerlink Presenter equipped Duo210 (which has video out), and
Hi8 tape of stuff including old movies and such.  We mixed material
with a Panasonic mixer that has the wonderful capability to mix
non-genlocked sources.  One of my favorite effects is to make a
B/W movie very high contrast and then AND mix it with a pattern
(fractal, interference pattern, whatever) so that people in a scene
appear to be walking about wearing fractal clothes and have fractal
faces!  Quite neat.  We had two SHARP 400 video projectors that were
brilliant (literally and figuratively.)  We got many rave compliments
and some people wanted to hire us.  We did the show as a favor for
a friend and we had lots of fun.

I agree with William, the 3DO machine's "cell engine" is
wonderful.  Some people in attendance with an understanding of
computer graphics were incredulous when we told them that we were
calculating images in real-time.

Hey folks,

LAst week at Corduroy City was pretty great.  Main sound system, with an
ambient system downstairs; a corduroy chill room; and great music.

This week offers John Howard, Neon Leon, and Robbie Hardkiss, with Ernie
Munson and Mark Farina playing ambient in the basement.

$5 for 11pm - 6 am makes it a pretty great deal, and a nifty post-Mission
rock alternative!

SFRavers please check in at the computer and say hi!

	Tony

Before I start I wanted to say that I did not enjoi Basics too much.  There
were lots of people there but the whole scene was confused.  I did think
that Markie was especially great that eveneing (as always), Josh was good,
Tony was good,  Garth is Garth, Doran's set was a bit too uh...well I'll
leave it at that.

I was good seeing BB working the parking lot, with a smile and friendly
demeanor no less.

In any case I thought the DJ's were good, sound system bad, and the people?
 Well it's what I have come to expect from a massive.  I do predict one
thing about the upcoming Universe clown fest.  This will be confusion taken
to new heights.  If you thought Cyberfest was ugly, or that Basics was
clueless it will only be amplified ten-fold when that thing gets going. 
It's not a dis of their crew cuz I don't know 'em.  It's just a fact of
this area that's all.  I do think that they will make alot of money, and
some new people may be brought into the scene.  But that will not prevent
many lost and clueless souls from attending, and leaving even more confused
than when they entered.  I dunno if I'm going.  If I'm compe'd I'll go, if
not I'll report from the sidelines.

Ok, now that I've said all that...I have seen that many have mentioned
video tapes of the parties you have attended.  When these posts were goin
on I completely forgot that I have a few of those tapes here at home.  But
I cannot give out copies :(  BUT there is an alternative.  Nitty Gritty
Productions has just about EVERY party that has gone on in the Bay Area
since this scene began.  They have FMM (Full Moon Massives), Wicked,
Gathering, Basics, Toon Town, Sharon, Funky Techno, Vortex, Equinox, Let
Freedom Rave, ALL the New Years Parties, Let Freedom Rave, Get Down Get
Wicked, Wax, Groove Kitchen, Love American Style, the Sacramento Parties,
the Chico Parties and many others.  The music on the tapes are from the
parties themselves, as well as special soundtracks done by Garth, Josh,
Surge, and others.

The FMM's are NOT available yet.  He is still working out something with
the crew.  But all the others are avaialble on VHS tape.  If you are
interested (I will not give the number out on the net) please mail me and
I'll make the connection between you and Nitty Gritty.  BTW, I receive no
profit from this venture, hell I already have the tapes I wanted (since
they used my digitial mixer to make most of the tapes).  The tapes are of
the highest quality, and the tapes are in stereo (I beleive).  Let me know
if any of you are interested.  And they are priced right too!

Groove Kitchen looks like the party to go to tonight.  He has a great
lineup!  The King St. space is one of the better spaces in the city.  I
hope he can keep the security from roving around like streiod-thugs and
just have them man the doors.  There will be a good crowd there (400-600)
so it should be a good event (Preston has YET to throw a bad one).  It's
21+ :)  so bring your ID.

Peace over and out.

Subject: promotion!
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

 Since there's a lot of extra people in town..I was thinking
I'd do a repeat of last year's sale on Intellex.
(please excuse the blatant self promotion..but since this is only
for list people,I thought it had general interest..)
Basically,I'm offering to sell each person responding within the next few days
one bottle of intellex at a trial price (basically the case-lot price..)
of $26.00 instead of the $35.00 it usually is..
Theres a xcharge for shipping and possibly local taxes..(if you live in CA.)
($6.00 and 8.25% respectively) but its still significant savings..
This is for 83 servings of an excellent choline supplement..
coincentrated and ideal for mixing with juice..  This offer wont be 
done again for awhile..I hope people dont mind me posting here..
-Chris.

Well, on my first day back east from an amazing trip that I hoped would
never end, here are a few reflections. Basically, inhuman summed it up
with "my next ticket to SanFran will be one way". What you people have
other there is amazing and it seems a lot of you take it for granted.
Though the scene is older than ours, it seemed, to me a least, so much
more fresh and alive than our own. Though many sf-ravers seemed
dissapointed with Basics, it was an incredible experience for myself. To
see 1500+ people dancing is not unheard of here, but to see that 1000+ of
those people still dancing, shouting, and screaming with enthusiasm at 7:30
the next morning is. Thoughts of the DC/Balt morning cross my mind - 80+
people in a huge warehouse with a few more lying comatose on the floor.
There was so much energy out there that at times I was just overwhelmed,
the FMR being a prime example of that. The location went out over the
phones arond 10 or so, then 4 hours later, around 1500 people had gathered
on a beach, 50 miles north of SanFrancisco - all this on a Sunday night!
then after being busted around 4:30, the party relocated to Berkeley
marina...another 50 mile drive. There the party went on and was still
going strong with 300+ people at 2pm Monday afternoon. It is truely a
beautiful place. 

Thanks for everyone who made this trip so special - brian, joachim, cindy,
leah, inhuman and the wundervan posse, and everybody else we came in touch
with.  

much love.

	That would be funny. Hehe. If the DEA realized that.

	Er, it already is, brother.

wow
feels wierd to be home
when i felt very much at home all of last week
while i was up in SF
for that i really thank brian and leah for giving me a place
to crash and tam for picking me up and tam and jo and ingrid and brian 
and whoever else for driving me around
thanks to YSH for a great party
and everyone else for making it greater by being able to meet you

to re-cap the week in the post FMR section
i slept and ate and laid around a lot
actually didnt eat that much so it was mostly sleeping and laying around

but seriously.. had tons of fun with leahx2 and jo and microwiz
and then leahx2 and jo and alpha
and then leah and jo
justwandering around telegraph or haight
and watching everyone log in everyday at leahs
played Dactyl Nightmares at Dwight Cafe with greg who quite toasted me
although i nailed him in the back mighty good
and many other things that were quite to much wonderful to try to compact
into one little whodingit

one notable thing of this week is how small the world felt
aside from meeting everyone who was out from the east coast
and all these people from sf (and im quite sorry i didnt
meet more people at YSH who i guess were there)
but also going into a piercing place and opening a magazine
to see the woman who has done my pierces being featured in there
to going into amoeba clothing and seeing all this jewelry
that looks really familiar adn it turns out a friend of mine made
to running into a friend from high school at YSH and to find out
that hes on sfraves and been reading my psots
to running into Brad Bakers (of B.B.'s X-FX) in LAX on the way home
to i dont know how many other things that just amde it seemed like
there realyl are only 547 people in the world and ive almost
met them all

well even if i dont meet teh rest, the ones who i ahve
seem quite wonderful enough to keep me ecstaticly happy for now

 ,
dana

I, too, remember reading this is one of my big LEXIS/NEXUS searches on 
MDMA.  I can dig up the proper references if someone wants them; I know 
all the printouts are lying around my room somewhere...

Just to recap the madness:

-- Fenfluramine, legal, more nuerotoxic than MDMA
-- MDMA, illegal, less nuerotoxic than fenfluramine

well here i was thinking life would be simple for once:  some positive  
leading email indicators showing lots of sfravers heading to groove kitchen  
saturday, GK in a space i like, DJ lineup much to my taste, lots of friends  
planning to go.  a no-brainer:  i'm going to GK saturday night.

then this option appears - an outdoor renegade also with cool sponsorship and  
DJ talent.  *sigh* - a tough choice.

i may check out the renegade early, but i think i'm going to follow through  
on my earlier plans to make GK home for the night.  looking forward to  
reports on what i'll have missed!

Haven't had much time to get online since I returned from my California
trip to Portland.  I've been busy busy busy -- in Sacramento earlier
in the week, took the train back to Richmond Thursday evening, BARTed
to the City and dropped off my stuff at my friend's apartment, then
headed over to the Lost & Found Saloon in North Beach where I saw my
old friend Doug Jay playing blues harp with his band the Chevrolets!
I hadn't talked to Doug since 1979 when he was playing with a band
called the Allstars from Charlottesville, so that was really great.
If you like the blues, catch his band if you can but you'll have to
move quick since he's going to Austria in September for a couple of
months to join the premiere blues band there :)

I then headed over to YSH, which I haven't attended since the 24th St
Beach night (I'd be there every week if I could, believe me!).  It was
good to see Brian and Peace holding forth in the back entrance, and
I saw quite a few of the Penelope's krewe as the evening went on as
well.  Upstairs the TAZ space was set up in funky, comfortable disarray.
This rave felt like a *party*, or maybe this was a party that felt like
a *rave*!  It was busy but not overcrowded, and when I arrived the
floor had plenty of low-key dancing action.  

I wandered back to the chill area in front with this *classic* view
of Market St. below -- the Psychedelic Shop across the street in the
old Wells Fargo building (we moved literally a ton of bank record
boxes in the basement of that building for a birthday party I went to
there a while ago!), and the cop shop on the far corner.  

All of a sudden Jan Cooley came on laying down this phaaaaat phunky house
set and THINGS REALLY CLICKED!  I hadn't heard Jan spin before so this 
turned out to be a real pleasure -- she's got a great smooth style and
a way of giving some of the more popular mixes a more interesting setting
than they usually get.  The room suddenly seemed to *cohere* and for
about 20 minutes I had one of those really fine well-aligned resonating
'xperiences I associate with my best times in this scene.

Thursday nights definitely have mixed blessings.  On the one hand, the
crowd were very relaxed, not into the Friday Frenzy or the Over The
Edge Saturday Surge.  But there was also a relatively low level of
interactivity until later in the evening.  Yet I had the feeling that
this was one of those fabled moments where a lot of elements that
define the good side of the scene came together.  The lack of commercial
focus for YSH upholds the relaxed/intense feeling that I really like best.
And it holds those feelings for more than a few moments at a time. 
Like many others, I'm feeling quite annoyed by the commercial scene and
more inclined than ever to go with the smaller parties where the music
and dancing and socializing are the focus, not stylin' and the promoter-
security-DJ triangle that defines much of the mainstream (while giving
appropriate props to the GK and Boogie Buffet krewes and others who
do quite well in the more 'commercial' context).

The only drawback to Thursday night was the time factor.  I had a plane
to catch *early* in the morning, so I was weighing the prospect of an
early exit and a couple of hours sleep against the fine vibes of YSH.
Well, YSH and Jan Cooley won out, I'm happy to say.  I left around 4:15
and caught my flight with a bit of a perma-grin that maybe the other
passengers noted -- but how could I explain to them what the sources of
my contentments were?!

it's noon on sunday and i've just woken up after returning from ethan
& co's renegade party down at 3rd & 24th.  i got there at 3.30 and
found the crowd disappointingly thin on the ground, but big smiles and
hugs to those who had the stamina to brave the chill ocean winds!

this is a nice space and looks like it could be home to some great
independent parties in the future.  i certainly enjoyed it more than
groove kitchen, which i thought was a crowded and sweaty vibeless
affair with subpar music (although i'm sure it improved after i left,
as rick preston and jon williams had yet to come on...)

anyway, good to see the familiar faces that made it down to the
water's edge.  with a little planning and some more advance notice,
i'm sure future events will be ten times as good.

and now, lunch.

Groove Kitchen

(Subjective review alert!) :) :) :)

I thought Groove Kitchen was way too crowded, and had really poor
ventilation. The smoke was the worst I've experienced in my
approximately 20 events. No ins-n-outs, and the only cool space was
being harassed by the security. I'll probably not visit that space
again.

The music was good, with pretty conventional house. The sound was too
loud for my tastes. If I'd have had my earplugs, I'd have put them in,
and parked right in front of the speakers. The vibe was pretty thick
(with the smoke, really thick, does everyone have to foul other
people's air?).

So it was a real relief to get back to...

The Renegade

At which Jon played some good funky house. By then though my body was
pretty much thrashed, but it felt good to be out there with you guys.

Let me know if you do it again :). My # is 916-757-1373. I have no
real computer access after business hours M-F.

dana...

You put it much better than i could ever have...
This past week was more than i could have ever hoped for- because of the 
people i've met, the friends ive made, the amazing time i had both at 
the berkeley  marina on monday & at YSH...

There is something about SF ravers that makes one feel naturally accepted and
welcomed - there is little if any attitude that ive encountered.
Everyone is there for the music, exuding a warm feeling of love and 
friendliness... it's like nothing ive ever encountered before or thought i 
could ever find in people.

I am overwhelmed with a sense of child-like wonder at how many 
different people i have met (from both coasts) & the fact that even my cynical
self has been won over...

i find myself infected with the same feeling of friendliness & happiness...

i especially want to thank brian b. for introducing me into this new world of
music, and thank leah for being so wonderful to me while i was staying there.

hello to everyone i've met recently & to all those i hope to meet in the near
future....

Hi gang, it's been a while since I've been to a rave (July FMR?), but
stopped by the 24th St. Renegade for a couple of hours on Saturday
night and had a fun time chatting and dancing around.  Definitely a
cool space.  I do love the outdoors sites.  In fact, I can't remember
the last time I went to an indoors rave.  Must have been something
last summer in the basement of the Fashion Center?  Definitely looking
forward to the planned (cross-yer-fingers) GGP rave in October and the
possible Renweal in Willets later this month.

After jookin' for a while at the renegade, headed over to Rhythm at
around 2:00, which was listed in the calendar but wasn't a rave.  It
was the opening night of a new gay dance club.  It was at 177
Townsend, which was cool to revisit.  Lots of memories of the big
Toontowns and Care*Free's early days.  Cool space.  There were a lot
of people, but as club openings go, I've been to better ones.  

Jon Williams was spinning when I got there (must have been right
before his set at Groove Kitchen) and his mix didn't do much for me.
It was a lot of mild, droning techno.  Not quite trance and not quite
house.  Just boring.  After an hour or so he must have started warming
up (or I warmed up to his mix) and danced for a while.  All in all, a
pleasant evening.

Share and Enjoy,

Tim

Went up to Mission Rock last Friday with some newbies (who
were much impressed with the place) and I thought Jon
Williams' set there was pretty good.  Interesting enough to
set the mood and get you moving, but not *too* interesting
(as in, "What the hell is he doing now?").

It seems funny to me that Mission Rock isn't more of an
sfraves hangout.  It's cheap, outdoors on the bay, the
music is good, and the mix of people is all right, but I
only got to say hello to Derek there (and I saw Jon Drukman
around, but somehow we kept missing each other).  

I guess it's annoying that it's 21+, but at least the people
on the door don't seem to be too obnoxious...

Anyway, I was wondering what happened with the Gathering
party at the Berkeley Marina that night.  Anybody make it
over there?  They were announcing on the phone message that
Nitrous wouldn't be tolerated.  How did that work out?

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


Hi,  I think I'm the first casualty of the faschist regeme formed by the
piggishness of the club owners.   Let me explain...

I thought that me and my friend should check out "Where the wild things
are" at One Step Beyond.    A few of my friends then met me in the parking 
lot and told me that things weren't happening that made it worth the steep 
$20 admission,  and also reported that the usual faschist sceme of NO WATER 
ALLOWED,  unless you are willing to pay the steep pricees they charge,  
so we collectivly agreed to check out GK.

So we drive all the way into SF from Santa Clara to the King St club.
When we get there,  we had to wait in line for more than an hour to get
in,  while the goons were taking their time carding everyone.   Ha Ha!!
Even *I* got carded (And I'm 50 yrs old).

Once in,  I figured that I could find a place where I could escape from
the cigerett smoke.   After scouting around,  I was appalled to learn that
the chill out area was HOTTER than the dancing area.

In fact,   I worked up a sweat just WALKING through that area (Yukk!!).
But I did find a cooler area to chill out in the front hallway,   but
about 3 am or so,  the goons kicked out everyone and forced them back into
the main area which was very hot,  smokey and steamy.

I stayed by that doorway as much as possible,  but that big black goon
in the main entrance hallway must have had it in for me,   because everytime
I opened the door to stick my head into the hallway,   he threatoned to kick
me out if I did that again.

Eventually,  I found a stairway down into one of the other exit doors where
it was partially opened and I could get a gasp of fresh air.    But it opened
to the outside area,  and immediatly,  a goon from outside saw me as I stuck
my head out,   came in and then bolted the door shut so I could only get a
crack of fresh air.    It was better than nothing,   but I don't think it
was worth the effort to attend.

Eventually,  I started to feel whoozy and slightly sick,  and asked the goon
for permission to breath fresh air because of my nausia,  and he said "get
back in there,  or I'll kick you out"  (This was another goon).

After the party,  and the usual visit to the Boogie Buffet,  on the way back,
I really started to get sick,   and my rashes exploded to the point where I
have
to now visit the doctor and get more anti-tobacco medication.   This is going
to
cost me about $500 in medical expenses,  and a few days from my new job.

So,  I ask others that attended if they ALSO experienced any ill-effects of the
stuffyness caused by the goons of King st.  And if they did,  to please contact
me via phone (510) 745-0702 (Message only).   This is because I am
investigating
the possibilities of a class-action lawsuit charging in-humian treatment on the
part of the Kink St goons.   I will NOT name any of the promoters of the event,
as I KNOW it is NOT their fault.

I know Preston the promoter of the GK,   and it's NOT his fault,  and that he
had to go by their rules which he ALSO thinks they suck.   Preston is a great
guy,
and really had done a LOT to provide us with good raving.

I am not sure yet whether or not I will start this lawsuit,   but that depends
on
the rest of you raver folks,  and whether or not anyone else can claim any ill-
effects from being there and can DOCUMENT them to the point where the court
can accept them as legitimate medical problems.

So,  I ask the group... If you,  or your non-sfrave rave friend has experienced
any ill-effects to please contact me.    

Please remember,   I will ONLY do this if OTHERS have experienced any
ducumentable
ill-effects.    I SURE cam prove my problems...

Sean,  I also saw your posting about YOUR discomfort as well.   And I urge you
to
also consider joining me.    

Perhaps if I instigate this lawsuit,  and make a big media situation out of it,
then other club owners may get the idea that PEOPLE NEED WATER and AIR.   It is
a basic fundimental human need,   and NO club ownder should deprive one of
these
basic fundumental needs.

One more thing,   When I start talking to the media about how great raves are,
and all the GOOD things about raves,   I am certainly going to mention the
faschist
attitudes of certain club owners,  and if I'm allowed to name them,   I'll also
do that...

I remain...
Cap'n Crunch

OH!! One more thing,  I'm going to need the name of the King St owner and mailing
address so I can write them an official complaint letter on our behalf...

If anyone can provide me with that,   I would appreciate it..

Hey, doom! Hey, all!

No, I didn't go to the Gathering renegade, but a friend of mine did. So,
this will be a vicarious report (take it with a grain o' salt?).

According to my friend- it got broken up; I don't know when.

Also, she said that two really negative incidents occured- one, 
a personal experience; the other, more general.

She accidently (physically) bumped into another woman at the party,
and said, "Oh, I'm sorry," smile 'n all...

To which the woman replied, "You better be sorry, bitch." (feel that vibe!)

Additionally, some sort of fight broke out; something like five 
men kicking and beating another man who was already down (curled into 
a ball on the ground). Apparently, nobody intervened due to fear and/or
numbers and/or the possibility of guns.

Me? I spent all weekend at work to meet a deadline tomorrow. The most
exciting thing that happened was when I accidently set off the alarm in
our office-
'twas the music for the weekend. And, yep, my renegade got busted :)

Back to the grind-

We had great fun a Ethan's party Sat. nite.  Great music, great people;
it was like a family gathering, except that I was with people who I 
actually like.  Finally got to meet Sean, Giamma, Bryce, Ben & Jessica
Wing and some really friendly non-sfravers.  And of course it was fun 
to mix it up with the other sfravers who came.  We danced, we chilled, 
we talked, we ate - the Universe is now a better place then it was...

Stopped by Ethan's and Bob's renegade rave at the end of 24th later in 
the evening, which seemed to be gaining momentum.  It was a nice scene,
friendly people, good music, crisp sound, easily accessible outdoor 
site.  The 2 strobe lights were a nice effect. 

I was under doctors orders to sweat hard, so I went to The Fridge.  The
basement of Big Heart City is hot, although the 10 or so fans did help a
bit.  Ran into Steve Saede(sp?) dancing like a maniac.  The sound system
was mediocre, but adequete, and there was a lot of room to chill.  7$ 
seemed fair for this venue on a Sat. night.  In a pinch, this place
will do depending on how long you can last without oxygen.  I
basically stayed for Simon's set, who tore the place up with Carlos
cheerleading nearby. 

It looks like I'm cured of my Raver's Rash, thanks to the anti-fungal
weed-killer that surged from my pores that night.  Now I won't have to
explain to the people commenting on my weird dance moves for the last
few weeks that I was only trying to to scratch the itch in the middle
of my back.

After Simon, I figured that breathing would kind of fun, so I
woke Janie, picked her up, and shot back over to 24th St.  The crowd
had thinned out, but we hung out for a bit of Jon's set, which was excellent
BTW.  Big name DJs?  We don't need no big name DJs.  It was kinda chilly,
so we decided to call it a night, and then decided to see if we could
get in cheaply for the tail end of GK.  But Janie, who turned 35 this
week didn't have her ID, and the securty goons were adamant about it.  I was 
told that it didn't matter how old they thought she was, that their license
would be jeapordized if a cop found her inside without ID.  I guess this
means that my 66 yr old dad wouldn't  be allowed in without ID.  It is
a strange world that decides that a beuracratically sanctioned peice of
paper/plastic is more meaningful than the Truth.  Oh well.  I was too tired
to beat up the entire Groove Kitchen Security Force so we went went home.

Why don't be just BOYCOTT 174 King ST !!!  It's unventilated,
and the staff are rude and there are other places to go.
The venue SUCKS !! It's not Preston's fault, it's not
Wicked's fault, it's not Aurgasm's fault,  the list goes on, but
I for one avoid the place.   I doubt that a lawsuit will be 
very useful, "no-ins-&-outs" is unfortunately common club policy,
and you can always leave if you don't like it ( sayeth the owners,
and, mornlikely, the law ).

Anybody go to the Fridge???

When the air's that bad, they've got to be violating some law. Some
sort of air quality standards? Rules against carcinogens? An OSHA
violation?

Something's got to give. It's bad enough that the club had no
ventilation. It's worse that security was hassling people for trying
only to get some fresh air.

How much more money does it take to put decent ventilation into a
club?

What was the name of the place again? I'm starting a list.

well, Groove Kitchen was like most other Groove Kitchens that I had been to
in the past, in that the vibe was weak until about 4 am.  Until that point,
the place was extremely crowded and hot, and the DJs (Gavan and Mark Farina) 
being somewhat boring.  Mark Farina played Erotic City (unmixed!) by Prince at
one point  (hmm....).

Jon Williams came on and really tore it up.  He is such a great DJ, really.
All the reviews of his music that have been posted here are accurate.  Then
Rick preston came on.  For those of you who know Rick and see him frequently,
his set would've amazed you.  He came on after Jon Williams had finished up his

set with some really good acid house, and proceeded to play the most intense,
driving acid set I've ever heard.  He was jamming so hard, it was unbelievable!
Rick really is the most underrated DJ around, in my opinion.  He is always good,
and now has shown to have some of hte greatest high-energy acid music around.
I hope to catch him more at bigger events in the hopes of hearing that music again.  Mind blowing!

Kudos to the renegade for going off.  I would've gone over there but I really
wanted to hea rRick that night, since he had told us that we would probably be
"surprised" by his set.  More renegades!

Who's going to Festivahl?

 as some of you remember, a few weeks ago the aurgasm party at
king st. was close down byt THE CLUB OWNERS for lack of $ from alcohol sales.
it caught both the aurgasm people and the ravers by totial surprise when they
(literally) pulled the plug at 2 am on july 24th , i think. this may be
another data point for you, cc .it sounds terrible what happened to you, cc
and am sorry to hear you had to go to a doctor. maybe uinderground renegades

I'll agree with you on that one.  The one thought that kept on running
through my head during my three hour stay at Groove Kitchen was: "Christ
it's hot in here.  Some fresh air would be nice..."  So Pete and I left
at 3 or so.

However, the weekend wasn't a total waste.  We ended up going to San Jose,
and we checked out a very cool after party held at a cafe/laundromatte
called Lattes & Laundry.  There were about 50 people there, and the DJs
were Tara, Wool and Spun.  (I had never heard Tara or Wool before.)  Tara
started out at 6:30 am.  With the exception of her opening song (the disco
classic "Copcabana") her set was pretty damn cool -- happy, funky, housy
stuff, which was perfect for the vibe that was going down.  Wool came on
at about 8:30 and failed to impress me.  We left at 9:00, and the party
was still going strong when we left.  (Spun had yet to play.)

Overall, a fun little party that blew Groove Kitchen away.

Subject: THE LIST: Spaces with gotchas.
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Here's the paltry beginnings of my list. Please help me flesh this out
by listing any spaces that have bad conditions, unreasonable
restrictions, or age limits.

This does not reflect upon the promoters of an event at these spaces.
It is intended to give people some advance information before they go.
If this list reaches some reliastic volume, I'll start printing it out
and leaving it at raves as a public service :).

I might build this up as a table, and list all sites that we hear of
so that we can list the good ones in a separate section.

Note that I am currently boycotting 174 King St. and One Step Beyond.


(Name?) 174 King St., SF
	21+. No ventilation. NO COOL AREAS. Very rude staff. No
	re-entry. Small.

One Step Beyond, (Address?), Santa Clara
	Age limit? NO WATER. NO BACKPACKS. Rude staff. No re-entry.

(Name?), 6th & Folsom, SF, current site of Boogie Buffet.
	Age limit? NO WATER.

Richmond Civic Center, (Address?), Richmond
	No re-entry. Continuous police presence.

Sean

PS - It seems that some of these measures are intended to prevent the
kinds of problems associated with drunken crowds. They don't apply to
raver crowds, who have different needs, specifically a cooldown area,
and plenty of water. I wonder if some spaceowner education might help?

Every party I've been to there has provided free water - it's called
1015 Folsom (that's the name of the club itself), and when Come-Unitys
were there it was simply an incredible place, with lots of chill-out
rooms and such.  Also, I remember they were applying for a permit to
have 18+ parties, but I dunno where that has gone.

The no-reentry is a problem, but the police presence has never bothered
me; for the most part they've been friendly, and I no of no drug busts or
anything even when it was OBVIOUS stuff was being used.....

p.s. - I'll post about the Gathering more later (would have done it this
weekend but instead spent this weekend installed gcc-2.4.5 and wu-ftp-2.1b
and other fun fun packages), but basically, it got shut down at Berkeley
Marina around 4:30 and moved to a site just south of the Oakland Airport,
and shut down there around 7:15... but nonetheless was a lot of fun...

Hmm okay I was confused. The one time I went to Boogie Buffet, they
refused to let me take in my water bottle, even if it was empty. I
consider this an unreasonable restriction. Besides, it costs them
less, and cuts down on waste if I bring my own.

That's 1015 Folsom.

I went to B.B. yesterday (my first time). There were pitchers of water
and and paper cups available throughout the day. The bar is quite
expensive -- at one point I got charged $5.00 for an irish coffee, even
though I had paid $8.50 for both an irish coffee and a bloody mary
earlier in the morning. (No, I wasn't "drinking"... just buying the
occasional drink for myself and others.).

This was my first Boogie Buffet and I was impressed. I didn't
particularly like the crowd (a few too many "look at me" clubland
adonis/venus-types) but the vibe was pretty good nonetheless. The DJs
easily played some of the best  music I've heard in a long time. I
loved the slow/funky "disco/boogie/dub/ragga/funk" stuff being played
in the "sunlight" room, and they were tweaking good techno/trance in
the "dark" room. I was expecially impressed by the mixing in the
"sunlight" room -- this wasn't your usual
mix-in-a-song-play-it-for-a-while-and-then- mix-the-next-song. It was
much more of a "performance" with lots of quick mixing back and forth,
between beats and tunes, the laying on of effects, and  other cool
stuff.  I tend to know some of the older "rare groove" "reggae" "disco"
stuff that DJ's might play -- but not this time -- the music was as if
beamed in straight from Saturn.

Anybody know who the DJ's were? I suspect/heard it was Thomas in the
"sunlight" room, but i was unable to locate the "man behind the
curtain" because it was too crowded over by where the DJ was and
because I had passed beyond the doors of perception :-).

And the music in the "daylight" room was definitely "jazzy funky
boogie", not techno. This was actually a very nice change. I could
easily introduce some of my rock-n-roll/reggae/deadhead/anti-rave
friends to this kind of music and they'd feel right at home. 

The soundsystem in the "daylight" room was positively jurassic,
massive, large and in charge -- massive dinosaurs of bass rumbling
through the space. The music played there had a lot of horns in it and
they sounded great too (which is something a lot of disco sound systems
can't do properly). Easily one of the best soundsystems I've heard in a
long time.  It was loud, clean, and my ears did not ring afterwards,
even though I wasn't wearing earplugs. Combined w/ the excellent DJing,
the experience was nearly magical. Great stuff, I will return.

PS: I had planned on checking out Groove Kitchen, but ended up falling
asleep, waking up at 5:30AM, and heading over to Ethan's renegade. We
then proceeded to Boogie Buffet, arriving around 7AM, and we stayed
till closing. Given the reports on Groove Kitchen, I'm really glad I gave
it a miss.

The perseid meteor shower happens every year around this time and is
supposed to be the best in 130 years this year.  It is supposed to
peak on Wednesday, 11-August.  Best viewed by looking to the east.

Is it possible that somebody is planning a little outdoor celebration
of this event???

    That's why I didn't end up going anywhere this weekend,
    (That plus the fact that I couldn't get on the net on Saturday &&!!??%@@
    so I didn't find out about the renegade @ 3rd & 24th)  

>   (Name?) 174 King St., SF
>           21+. No ventilation. NO COOL AREAS. Very rude staff. No
>           re-entry. Small.

    Last time I was there was for the truncated Aurgasm.
    No way, not even for Groove Kitchen.

>   One Step Beyond, (Address?), Santa Clara
>           Age limit? NO WATER. NO BACKPACKS. Rude staff. No re-entry.

    I was expecting to go to Where the Wild Things Are, but not when I
    figured out that   1400 Martin St, Santa Clara == One Step Beyond
    (I think the WtWTA promoters know that we know about that place,
    their recording never gave the name of the place at all, just
    directions to get there)

    That renegade would have been just the thing, too bad I didn't know
    about it until now.

*******************************************************
Telecommunications Infrastructure Act of 1993 (S. 1086)
*******************************************************

Introduced by Senators Danforth and Inouye on June 9, 1993
First hearing scheduled: July 14, 9:30 AM

A Summary by the Electronic Frontier Foundation

The Senate Communications Subcommittee is now in the process of 
considering legislation that would eliminate the legal monopoly that 
local telephone companies have on local phone service, allow any 
communications provider to offer local phone service, and allow local 
telephone companies to compete fully in the cable television market.  
The legislation's goal is to promote increased investment in the 
nation's telecommunications infrastructure.

The bill proposes many significant policy changes, chief among 
which is a very rapid move toward deregulating the local telephone 
companies' monopoly on local telephone service.  The policies proposed 
are laid out in broad concepts, leaving the Federal Communications 
Commission to wrestle with the actual implementation of the policies.

LOCAL EXCHANGE COMPETITION

One year after the bill is enacted, any company would be allowed 
to offer local telephone service.  Potential new entrants that would be 
allowed in the local exchange market under this bill include cable 
television companies, wireless service providers, and even Bell 
companies outside their current local exchange monopoly areas.  Any 
State laws that would preserve the current telephone company monopoly 
or limit the entry of competitors are pre-empted by the bill.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER OBLIGATIONS

Any company that offers telecommunications service or is 
interconnected with the local exchange carrier's network has several 
obligations under this bill.  The definition of telecommunications 
service is somewhat vague, but it certainly includes voice telephone 
service, interactive data services used to carry information services, 
and possibly one-way video services such as those currently provided by 
cable television companies.  Carriers' obligations include:

1. Interconnection

All carriers that either provide telecommunications service or are 
interconnected with a carrier that provides telecommunications 
service must allow other carriers to interconnect with their network 
for the purpose of providing telecommunications or information services 
to users of either network.  Network operators must provide 
interconnection under nondiscriminatory terms, on an unbundled basis.  
Operators must also supply all necessary technical information to enable 
others to interconnect and interoperate from one network to another.

2. Universal Service

All providers of telecommunications service must contribute to the 
"preservation and advancement of universal service."  States, in 
cooperation with the FCC, are responsible to make regulations that 
establish the mechanism for supporting universal service in the newly 
competitive telephone market.  The bill does provide, however, that any 
universal service support should be given directly to "individuals and 
entities that cannot afford the cost" of telecommunications service.  
Subsidy for users' communications equipment is also allowed.

3. Number Portability

The FCC will establish regulations the provide for "portable" 
numbers from all carriers as soon as possible.  Thus, a customer could 
switch telecommunications providers without having to change telephone 
numbers.  The administration of the numbering system would be removed 
from Bellcore and placed with an "impartial entity."

INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RURAL AREAS AND NONCOMPETITIVE MARKETS

The bill recognizes that in a competitive market environment, 
rural and "noncompetitive markets" may not enjoy the level of investment 
necessary for providing advanced telecommunications services.  The 
minimum level of service desired in the bill is that which would 
"provide subscribers with sufficient network capacity to access to 
information services that provide a combination of voice, data, image, 
and video; and are available at nondiscriminatory rates that are based 
on the reasonably identifiable costs of providing such services."  It is 
not clear that such services would be interactive.  State regulators would 
be given the primary responsibility to ensure that carriers have an 
incentive to provide high-quality services to all areas.  If this 
approach fails, the FCC is empowered to take action to have necessary 
service delivered to these areas.

NETWORK STANDARDS AND PLANNING

All segments of the communications industry are encouraged to work 
together to set voluntary standards for interconnection and 
interoperability.  If the FCC determines that standards development is 
not succeeding or is proceeding too slowly, it may set incentives or 
deadlines for work to be completed.  The FCC may also impose mandatory 
standards if the voluntary process fails.  

The FCC and the States are required to ensure that advanced 
telecommunications services are designed to be accessible to people with 
disabilities.

TELEPHONE COMPANY ENTRY INTO CABLE TELEVISION MARKET

The current ban preventing local telephone companies from entering 
the cable television market is lifted, in part.  Local phone companies 
will be allowed, under the bill, to provide cable television service 
within their serving area, if the service is provided by a 
separate subsidiary and the phone company does not break any laws 
regarding improper cross-subsidization between phone service and cable 
services.  By the same token, cable companies that provide 
telecommunications service must do so through separate subsidiaries and 
obey laws regarding cross-subsidization.  Phone companies are still not 
allowed to purchase more than 5 percent interest in any cable system 
that provides services within the phone companies' service regions.

CHANGES IN LONG DISTANCE RESTRICTIONS

The restrictions on local phone companies against providing long 
distance (InterLATA) telecommunications service are lifted, in part, by 
the bill, to enable local phone companies to function more easily in the 
cable television and cellular phone markets.  Bell companies would be 
allowed to operate wireline and satellite links for the purposes of 
distributing cable television signals over long distances.  Some 
relaxation of the InterLATA restriction is also allowed to enable Bell 
companies to carry cellular phone calls from one region to another, and 
to hand off calls from one cellular system to another.  

INFORMATION SERVICES SAFEGUARDS

Bell companies that provide information services must do so 
through a separate subsidiary in order to prevent cross-subsidies that 
would be unfair to consumers of basic phone service and to information 
service competitors.  The separate subsidiary must maintain separate 
books and records, only engage in arms-length transactions with the Bell 
company, and follow other regulations that the FCC issues regarding 
accounting, tariffing, and business practices.

PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER TRANSACTION INFORMATION

Telecommunications carriers are prohibited from disclosing 
information about individual customers unless there is an affirmative, 
written request to do so by that customer.  Carriers must, however, make 
any information (Customer Proprietary Network Information) that is 
disclosed available equally to their affiliates and all competitors who 
request the information.  Customer Proprietary Network Information 
includes quantity, type, and technical characteristics of 
telecommunications service used by a customer, as well as information 
contained in bills received by the customer.

I think the boycott idea is the best one I've heard yet,   but won't that
hurt those fine promoters like Preston?    Anyway,  I am now in communication
with an attorney on the WELL who is checking on it for me,   and I'll let
everyone know if he thinks any laws are violated.   If so,  he would be
willing to write a letter to the King St (And any other place) people.

I suppose I can snailmail it to 174 King st,  and address it "Attention
Manager (or owner)" in some legal and official letterhead.  I'll keep Ya
all posted,  and I think everyone for such GREAT support,  as we all gotta
stick together on these issues...

I am thinking of openieng a topic in the WELL Legal conference on the subject.

I'll report and re-post the resulte.

I want to thank Jon and all the DJs who came down and spun... Jon's
set was INCREDIBLE! and made me very happy!

This thing went off really nicely.  The only negative was that we only
had 40-50 people there at any one point, just shy of critical mass.
The sound was great and we basically started on time -- 11:30 pm --
and we went until 6:30 am with absolutely no problems.

I'm looking forward to more of these events... and rest assured, the
word will be out earlier next time.

Yowsa!

To Legal Conf:

Hi,  I have a question about some possible legal violations that I think
are taking place.

First,  some background...  I like to go out dancing at raves and nightclubs
on weekends.   These clubs often practice faschist ideas like not allowing
us to bring in our OWN water.   For instance in "One Step Beyond" in Santa
Clara,
they don't allow us to bring in our own water,  thus forcing us to purchase
water they provide (At a very high price of $4 per bottle).    I cannot drink
Santa Clara Tap water because of the high bacteria content,  which causes
serious stomach problems for me.

Not only that,  I am allergic to tobacco smoke,  and often have to leave
and go outside for fresh air,   and most of these clubs don't allow us to 
leave.

One such place is 174 King St - Which s run by the most faschist group of
goons in the city.    Last weekend,  they wouldn't even allow me to stand
next to the door to get fresh air,  and I couldn't leave the place,  because
I had a ride there with a friend.

When I explained my medical problem,  the laughed and said "Just leave...",
and on the Nets,  everyone has been complaining about these practices of
depriving us of our most basic rights to water and air.

Most people go to these to dance,  and exert a lot of energy and all need
water,  and most cannot afford to purchase it at those inflated prices.
Not to mention some people on Extacey and Acid and other drugs which the
depravation of water can cause serious health problems.

We think there are certain laws that they are breaking by not providing us
with our basic needs,  or not allowing us to leave and to return.   If so,
we would be most interested in knowing if there are laws they are breaking,
and what we can do about it.   Are there any public health codes they are
breaking?  If so,  who do we file our complaints with?

Also,  I would like to take the responses and send them to our Raves group
on the Internet and ask those that respond for permission to re-post to that
mailing list as appropriate.

Thanx... On behalf of us folks that like to dance to Techno House music,
live peacefully,  and have a good time...

They do allow you to leave.  They simply want to charge you to re-enter.
I don't see why this is against the law.

No, you could leave.   Then you could have walked home or called a cab.  The
club is not legally obligated to let you back in just because your ride is 
still inside.

Mentioning drugs is not going to go over well with the audience you're 
addressing.

I was gonna view the shower with some friends but now I too wonder if 
anything is going on that night.  Meteor showers are best viewed after
midnight because the earth's rotation is then rotating into the meteor
field head on so to speak.  I've been watching this shower for about
8 years now and it's never been that exciting.  I hope this year pays
off like it's supposed to.

If nothing is going on anyone is welcome to join us.  I was going to go
to the Berkeley or Oakland hills, which are dark enough believe it or not
but if it's overcast, I'll go to Briones or Diablo, both should be out of
the SF-Marin-Berkeley fog belt.

Ok, so nobody liked Groove Kitchen, but were you really surprised? I have never
been to 174 King St. when it wasn't really hot and crowded. And it is always
vibeless until well after 3:00 a.m. This is because the clubby crowds clued 
into it as a space where events were frequently held and it became a sort of
regular spot during a night of bar hopping. The only unpleasant surprise for
me that evening was the lack of ins and outs. That is usually the saving grace
of events held there. It surprises me to hear bitching about the things that 
are always true about that space. Not that they don't deserve to be bitched
about, but if you can't deal with that stuff, why did you go there?

On a brighter note, San Jose is becoming the center for a number of truly
happening events. Every other Monday, Rick Preston and Harry Who host a party
called Free Life at the F/X which is consistently cool and they've just
started a new party called Progress which is held every Tuesday night at a
place called Club Oz. Thursday nights there is Deep Space, which is consistently
wonderful and there is also an Acid Jazz night at the Ajax lounge which gets
going early enough that you can go to it before Deep Space. 

The afterparty for Where the Wild Things Are was a really cool little event.
Good music, which was well suited to the time, venue and crowd. The people
were happy and friendly. And there was an espresso bar (every afterparty
should have one). It was a fun place to hang out.

Did anybody read the article "Cintra Wilson's Fantastic Space Odyssey"
in Sunday's SF Examiner Image section?  It's not real serious, but it
gives the impression that ravers are big believers in UFOs.  The only
link I had perceived before was the ToonTown "UFO's Are Real" rave over
a year ago.

But the writer talks to Ernie Munson (the DJ), Nick Philip (from
Anarchic Adjustment), Steve Mitchell (a raver), and Matt (a rave flyer
designer).  Each are portrayed as big believers in UFO's and aliens,
then they tie those beliefs to the sort of spacey/psychedelic/
spiritual weirdo beliefs about love and communication and energy that
we ravers have ;)  (Matt is portrayed as a bit paranoid, though).

It's too long for me to type in, but if you don't have Sunday's paper,
someone you know probably does (if you live around here).

One quick excerpt:

  	Ernie told me that there are a lot of souls that were 
	originally from another planet whose sole purpose of
  	reincarnating into human form on Earth is to spread
  	the message that the kingdom of heaven is within us,
  	and that we are all gods and goddesses linked together
  	in a fabulous expansion of the overall mind of goodness.
  	He said that I was probably one of these reincarnated
  	aliens, sent to expose this information through my 
  	writing.  I thought that sounded pretty bitching.


Someone should write a letter to the editor about luv phasers :) :)

You are misinformed.  It most certainly does.
Promoter choose spaces where there event can go off, better than getting
busted.  By saying that the space sucks you doom a promoter bgecause of a
logical choice he/she has made, and also the potential of damaging thier
livelihood.  Check it.

You have been misinformed.  There is no question about the age limit it is
21+ only.  They have plenty of water.  Free if you know the promoter. $0.50
deposti for a glass.  This is for the environment since many are wasteful
with their empty cups. Plus the cups costs the club money.  People are less
wasteful when it costs them. Check it.

You havebeen misinformed.  There is re-entry.  And the police presence is

You have been misinformed.  The reason that they allow the parties to go
off there is that they are educated to the fact that they can make bank by
letting in 13+ into this space, charge bucks, and make out like bandits. 
They are quite aware about money, and how to make it.  As for problems, the
only probs. at Richmond are the hillbillies that tend to appear.  Czech it.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok Sean and others...that does it! 8-{ !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First I wanna say to whoever threw that so-called ug (underground) at 24 & 3rd:
weak (so weak I give it a small 'w').  That space is NOT at all new...the
first late train was thrown there WAAAAAAAY back.  Get original pleeeeze.

Next about boycotting spaces...whatever.  So far the only places to have
parties that will suit many of you will be outdoor freebies.  Good luck in
finding them, and good luck keeping them from getting busted.

As for the constant and annoying complaints about smoking...tough!  Look
you're in a CLUB, people smoke, always have!  If it's not cig's it's pot,
if it's not that it's the fog machine...sheesh...Here is the solution...If
you know it's gonna be in a club, DO NOT GO!  As a matter of fact if it's
going to be in SF DON'T GO!  This will help all of the minions with rashes,
sore achy eyes, and the breathing impaired.  No it's not that I'm
insensitive but I hate to hear people complain especially when they damn
well know what to expect!  Have ANY of you ever gone to a CLUB here in SF
that was smoke free??!!??  Didn't think so...as for the TAZ space, like
soooo many others, it will NOT last.  The one thing the cops know is when a
party is getting big, and YSH @ that loc is no exception!  Time will tell. 
And god help it if it moves into a club where, god forbid, SMOKERS of all
sorts will be there!

Yeah yeah yeah, I know that we ALL (I do NOT smoke) deserve to party in a
place with more ventilation (I wish they had more at the above spaces), but
at a rave, a true UG rave, a true warehouse rave, smoke whether by smoke
machine or pot, is used to make the effect.  My best times were spent here
in THIS city in sweaty warehouse's, sweaty clubs, with people going off! 
This is the REAL SF!  No room for the weak, timid, or environmentally
aware.  Either you're there to party and sweat, or you're there for
nothing.  Either you're there for the drugs, or you're there for nothing. 
Either your there for the infamous BASS that MAKES house HOUSE, or you're
there for nothing!  

I know that King St. is rather opressive, but it is because of underage
fucks, & non id carrying assholes getting into trouble that has caused that
place to become Stalag 19!  And this is true of many places, who at one
time were VERY COOL about people getting in, that must protect themselves
from a selfish few who only care about themselves and not others.  Look, I
know that there have been certain people in this group who are NOT 21
somehow sneaking into clubs (either under the guise of "working", or just
sticking around until the club opens) and just melding in.  This is self
centered and stupid since the place can easily get busted for such an
offense.  This ruins it for the people who are there legitimately!  There
are spaces for people who are 21-.  These are most clubs in SF before 2:30
a.m. , DV8 & the Stone.  Those are your choices.  So if you're 21-- either
go to those clubs(DV8 & Stone"d"), go to ones that allow you in until 2:30,
or wait for a massive that are usually all ages!  It's that simple.  Or you
can get politcially active, but seems to me that there has been more talk
than action of late.

Now about other clubs...Sean you bagged on Boogie Buffet.  I take personal
offense at this since P is a very good friend of mine, and has done one
helluva good job with that space.  It is a club for 21+ period.  Why?
(Besides zoning & licensing)  Well maybe the people who are 21+ do NOT want
to be around people 21--.  No reason needs to be given, but that seems to
have escaped many people's attention.  People go to Wicked, and don't go to
the Gathering for those reasons alone.  It's not right or wrong, everyone
has preferences.  The thing I love about most of P's gigs are the ONE thing
that most of these other parties everyone talks about lacks...DIVERSITY! Go
to a Gathering I am hard pressed to find Asian's (in numbers),
Latino's/Chicano's/La Raza (in numbers), and most glaringly
African-American's (in ANY numbers).  You go to a Boogie or a Groove and
you will see a multitude of colors, people's, and lifestyles!  Not just a
bunch of white kids waiting for the second coming of Jesus to appear on the
dancefloor!  Most of the 21+ clubs are like that.  Just a bit more diverse
than the average so-called "rave"!  Wicked is the same thing...I see a few
Brothers there (although the crowd has changed over the years from the
old-skool->new-school they still have a vibe thang going on...and as much
as I don't like the changes in Wicked, those dudes THROW DOWN (21+ sorry,
and you won't get the same vibe at Get Down)!

As for Richmond Center.  One of the only places 21-- can go all night,
smoke out and have a good time.  The presence remains outdoors..when there
is not a presence people get hurt.  This has been proven time and time
again.  Why, if the cops are being cool and staying outdoors is this a
problem I duuno.  I rahter they check outside than lurk inside.  Believe me
they have helped make situations better at parties at times, not worse
(besides if you have off duty cops, and you wax them your party won't get
busted).  I hardly ever worry about cops, I worry about the testosterone
laden rednecks that have been showing up to parties of late.  Those fucks
get drunk, and fight over their Daisy Dukes lookin' girlfriend just becuase
some guy said 'hello'.  Happens quite often at Gatherings...check it (as
well as the first benefit for Malachy! ohhh what a vibe :(    )!  

All of this talk about lawsuits (in an already too letiginous society), and
boycotts (how far the right wing has gotten), and bullshit about a club
being 21+ is doing one thing to the scene, KILLING IT!  Much like Gays have
pulled away from the "rave" scene because of the general unfriendly nature
of hillbilly het's, the same thing is happening here.  It is occuring along
age lines this time, and cultural lines, and who does whatever non-pc
thing-of-the-day line.  Pesonally I'm sick of it.  Instead of being more
inclusive many sound like the right winger's trying to make something their
exclusive domain, for their ideas and their kind.  Well that's fine...maybe
with enough filtering things will get back to normal...no more ug's, no
more parties, no more "raves".  Just a bunch of letiginous homogenous
hippies celebrating trees, and trying to save some fucking whale, while the
children of Hunter's Point, Potrero Hill, and the Mission District continue
thier cannibalism whilst you watch and wonder "why don't they dance?"!

So look, the UG has been here sooo strong that it never left.  Just like
the old days you gotta know someone to go!  This exclusivity I like!  Why? 
Becuase they're held in H.Point, The Mission, under the moon, with people
of MANY colors dancing and grooving to each other.  They are there to
party, crack on, joke around, and have a good time, no fighting or rednecks
allowed.  THAT is a RAVE.  Anything else is a mere imitation and pales in
comparison!  So sue away, stay away, gripe away, walk away....the party
WILL continue.  The choice is ALWAYS yours!  

My personal review:
GK- Seen better, Mark Farina fucked it up!
Boogie - Getting uglier with their exotic dancer preview, but many, many
fine points that make it THE afterhours in SF.
Fridge - Didn't go but heard good things.
Renegade - Many have asked "How'd they have it there with all those ---s in
the ---d?"  Heard some good things about it, way to go!  Hopefully onto a
more original venue, but ya gotta start somewhere!
Wild Things - Didn't go, haven't heard.


Disclaimer to Sean Casey:
Sean this was NOT a personal attack on you whatsoever.  Your's was just the
last straw in a string of staws I've seen posted since Sat.  You have been
generally objective in the past, but I had no other choice but to react
when I read "Boycott 'em all, and let god sort them out" rhetoric. 
Whatever...I ain't mad at you directly...sorry you have had such a bad time
at those clubs but they are what they are and they make no illusions about
it.  Know b4 you go!

Ummm can I ask how did you get in if it's 21+?  I remember somewhere that
you stated that you were 21--, unless things have changed (like a
birthday), when were YOU at 1015?  Now if you were 21-- then you were there
illegally.  Say it ain't so.  And if it is true that you were 21-- then you
could have caused the party to get shut down...hmmmmm

No re-entry is never a problem.  You just don't leave then the problem of

I see, now we have a big black goon. Everywhere else he just calls them
goons, but he had to make a point about this particular security agent
being black.  What gives?  What is the purpose of this classification?  Are
we to imagine Mike Tyson or some other "big black goon". Hmmm...so much for

Have you ever thought that mutual respect for another person might have

let people congregate outside in the halls, which IS a fire hazard (the
Fire Marshall checks there nightly).  Consider others.  Check it.

Let's see...since you went into the club at your own recognizance, and
since you knew about the environ (you have posted previously that you hated
smoky clubs and complained once about GK before) then who is responsible
for your illness.  You could have left (but NOT re-entered) and saved
yourself the pain and ache, but you chose to be $10 headstrong and suffered
the consequences.  Now you blame the "goons" (I guess the black ones as
well as the whatever ones) for not letting you stay in the hall where it
creates a fire hazard (SF Muni codes). And because of all this you want to
sue?!?  Can you say "frivilous lawsuit"..can you say "laughed out of the
courtroom".  Can you say "can't find a lawyer for my case".  Can you say
"Check it.".  Check it.

Yes I have.  I took too many E's and drank 1 beer to many.  I had to drop
acid to get me going again.  After that my stomach got upset so I smoked
out.  Danced my ass off for 3 days.  Man, THAT was ILL!  Check it.

The OWNER of King St.  Is a kind man who I think is bed ridden with an
illness.  He has given back to the community (primarily gay/lesbian) by
providing one of the best spaces in SF for that community to have parties. 
He has also been open to the Rave community (check Toon-Town) and other
events that have been all inclusive of people regardless of their race,
creed, or sexual orientation (Toon-Town remains as one of the MOST
intergrated parties EVER here in SF).  A guy with a heart who has opened
the King ST. garage for all to enjoy.  Yeah, sue him...he deserves it after
all he's done!

Check it!

    That's interesting.
    Perhaps the owner needs to be informed of how some of his employees
    have been running the place.  I'm particularly thinking of the
    untimely shutdown of Aurgasm last month.  If the *owner* is bed-ridden
    then he didn't shut down that party, but somebody working for him did.
    That is a reasonable thing to complain about, I think.  Smoke is
    to be expected in a club, no ins-and-outs is at least something they
    tell you about when you come in, but shutting down the party at
    2:30 when it's supposed to go until dawn isn't right.  I was psyched
    for what Aurgasm was trying to do there, and wanted do it all night.
    Some folks took the train from the South Bay to that party,
    assuming that it would be running again by the time the party ended.

    I don't think suing anybody will solve anything, it will just make
    it harder for us to get spaces to have our parties in.

    Perhaps if somebody *knows* the owner of King Street, they should
    talk to him.

John and Crunch both have good points, but:
1) John will have a better time with promoters and security than most people
because he is in the promoter end of the scene and therefore knows a lot
of them and understands why security exists.  Since an above-ground business
must NOT deny entrance to people on any grounds but imminent danger (or
risk lawsuits), you get all kinds, many of which look for trouble.  If you're
going to make bucks, you need theirs too, so you're stuck underground
if you want to restrict your circle to a small known scene.
2) CC (and many others on the consumer side) will note that a lot of things
obviously suck.  (Liquor->age limit, curfew, high rent, public land that
isn't really public, AntiSomeDrug laws, etc.)  So obviously it's the fault
of the people putting on the event, or the people who own the space.

I find myself agreeing a bit more with John here (!) in that GK might have
been a crummy place that night, but a lawsuit?  Seems like the problems are
mostly due to archaic fire codes and crummy ventilation.  OK, I won't go
there.  Most of the problems on the list above are due to legal bullshit
and not promoters: if it was easier to throw events that were more like
a rave, we'd see more, and people would stop going to the crummy places.
We can either throw more renegades, or agitate for change.  Hey, in San
Jose no one can do anything after 2 AM.  And you think SF is rough...

Still, comments like "ins and outs if you know the promoter" don't help
the people who, as John noted, are paying for it, and annoying security
can be a problem.  Hey -- if I can't bring in water I turn around and
leave.

I'd love everything to be as great as PW was, but they lost a ton of money.
I hope events like that are more what we want so that next time something
similar happens it'll be able to happen again.  Maybe people all just
want beer and attitude: I hope not.

So what am I saying?  I dunno.  Do what you gotta do.  // g

It's funny that King street seems to be creating lots of bytes in the matrix...
In Montreal, King and Prince street have always been the center of heated
discussions here... There are 2 garages converted to "made for warehouse
parties". The guy who owns these places makes more money than most clubs,
charging 3000$ a night to promoters for renting the place... however, it has
never been busted except on new years day because they didn't have permits, and
even if the security is like a state pen, the parties (dont say the r word)
are always succesfull.

Anyway, just a little note... As for charging for water, and no going out, i'm
affraid it's universal... Please let the good old days return...

It's true, King St. seems to have fallen into very shoddy management
practices since the spring.  I had some great times there last winter
though.  Over-crowding caused by over-marketing multiplied by Security
Trips equals bad times.  None of those three elements are necessary --
King St. can be completely cool as anyone who saw the Hardkisses or
Doc or any number of other folks spin there last winter can attest.

All right now, John.  I rarely get angry because I don't believe in
doing so without a good cause; but this message is just too much.
From your previous postings I've thought you a pretty cool guy and
wanted to meet you personally; but now I'm starting to wonder what
sort of fucked-up attitude trip you're on.  If you want to contribute
useful information and viewpoints, then I welcome your input
wholeheartedly; but if all you want to do is prove how much better
and more well connected you are than everyone else, then please go
away.

In article <9308100336.AA00359@netcom.netcom.com> you write:

|You have been misinformed.  The whole space is cool. 21+ is VERY cool :)

I seriously don't understand the way you continually harp on how great
21+ is.  Get it into your head -- 21+ is an ARBITRARY division coming
out of a stupid legal system that likes to oversimplify things.  There
is no sudden jump in coolness that happens when someone turns 21.  There
are plenty of cool 17 year olds, and plenty of fucked-up 25 year olds.
Everyone goes at their own pace.

|You have been misinformed.  OSB has no age limit and there's no question
|about it.  Nice staff, & re-entry if you know the promoter. Check it.

You also mention below about "if you know the promoter".  Don't you
realize -- NOT EVERYONE KNOWS THE PROMOTER?  Why must everything be
so elitist?  Furthermore, this attitude is very hypocritical when
compared to the rest of your message:

1) Isn't "knowing the promoter" akin to getting around the law?  If
you're so keen on lambasting 21-- people for trying to get around the
silly 21+ laws, and others who might invite the wrath of the fire
marshals, shouldn't you flame yourself for getting around the no
ins/outs and no-free-water policies?   For that matter, shouldn't
you be reporting your underground parties to the police, since they're
obviously illegal?  Either rules are meant to be followed or they aren't;
you can't go both ways.

2) Furthermore, realize that your elitist "I'm in, you're not" attitude
is exactly akin to the old "I'm white, you're not."  Think about this
before ragging any more on white hets just because of their skin color
and sexual preference.

|You have been misinformed.  There is no question about the age limit it is
|21+ only.  They have plenty of water.  Free if you know the promoter. $0.50

Man, what *is* your problem?  Besides the fact that not all of us have the
exquisite privilege of attending your cherished Late Trains, why is it
"weak with a small 'w'" to call a party "underground" merely because the
space was used before?  Nobody is denying that the space was used before;
YSH was there about 6 weeks ago.  (perhaps you didn't know that because
you're too "in" to go to YSH?)  If you're going to get so worked up about
not finding a totally unused space, then why are you going to such lengths
to defend the heavily used King St. space?

Your criticism of John Draper for saying "big black goons" has no validity
at all if you start resorting to the same kind of mudslinging that he
did.

|I know that King St. is rather opressive, but it is because of underage

|place to become Stalag 19!  And this is true of many places, who at one

|from a selfish few who only care about themselves and not others.

"selfish few who only care about themselves and not others" -- indeed so,
Mr. 21+ Elitist.

|There

|a.m. , DV8 & the Stone.  Those are your choices.  So if you're 21-- either
|go to those clubs(DV8 & Stone"d"), go to ones that allow you in until 2:30,
|or wait for a massive that are usually all ages!  It's that simple.

I suppose if I'm under 21 then I better just go away and hide myself
under a rock until I "come of age" and cease to be the vermin I once was.

|(besides if you have off duty cops, and you wax them your party won't get
|busted)

Man, let me say this again.  If you're not gonna follow the law, then
you sure as hell better not complain about others who don't do so either.

|Instead of being more
|inclusive many sound like the right winger's trying to make something their
|exclusive domain, for their ideas and their kind.

Mr. "I'm inclusive of you [as long as you know the right people]" speaks
again.

|So look, the UG has been here sooo strong that it never left.  Just like
|the old days you gotta know someone to go!  This exclusivity I like!  Why? 
|Becuase they're held in H.Point, The Mission, under the moon, with people
|of MANY colors dancing and grooving to each other.

Answer me, is raving about inclusivity, friendliness and good vibes, or
is it about having the right suitably oppressed color of skin and holding
it in the right suitably oppressed part of town?  I think getting more
diversity is a very good thing to do, but there's something wrong when age,
skin color, sexual preference, etc.  becomes a politically correct litmus
test (sorry to throw these overused political terms into the discussion)
determining whether a party is good or not.  If racial diversity is your
sole or primary determinant of good vibe, then that's fine with me, but you
need to preface your remarks with a big IMHO rather than stating them as the
out-and-out word of God, esp. seeing as so many people on this list clearly
disagree with you.

Have to agree with you here ...  I was about to leave Groove Kitchen at
about 3 or 3:30 when all of a sudden I noticed that the music was REAL
real good and the people were dancing hard, and I threw myself into the
dance!  I ended up staying till 5 or so.

there were a lot of real good looking people, which is always nice :),
but so many of them projected such negative energy ...  there were pockets
of good vibe here and there, esp. on the dance floor itself, but all the

You have been misinformed Ben.  I am not on an attitude trip.  The
information is useful.  crunch wants to sue the world because HE took it
upon himself to go a club knowing the environ.  Talking about lawsuits is
BULLSHIT.  Blaming promoters is BULLSHIT.  A hit list of SPACES is
BULLSHIT.  I have an opinion as well about these situation.  Crunch has
some good points, but he gets lost in the letigeny of revenge...and WORSE
yet for something he could have easily avioded by staying HOME!  So if I'm
an asshole for defending my friends club then I'm an asshole.  But I will
not sit by while many nice spaces are skewered by people for what I see as
ridiculous reasons.  21+!, I and MANY others like them (ever seen Wicked
not have a vibe or people not go because it's 21--. If so I ASSURE you that
THEY are in the minority).  The thing lacking here is perspective.  You and
others make these GRAND assumptions about spaces, and people.  You ASSUME
that becuase YOU want 21-- to mingle with 21+ that the 21+ want the same. 
Not a safe asumtion.  There is a REASON why many of the crowd that goes to
Wicked, GK, and other generally 21+ events stay away from all ages.  And
they have a right to do so without having to explain themselves.  So yeah,
21+ is great.  21-- going into a club for 21+ is a no-no and is
disingenuine with the concerns of others who are legitimately there.  If
you cannot deal with someone who has viewpoints opposite of your then YOU
are the one who is intolerant.  Check it.

You have been misinformed.  I said NOTHING in my post about coolness, and
as arbitrary as the age thang is you are still denying that people want to
hang around people within their own age groups at times.  You and other
thought police are making this a crime, or something that is evil.  Oh
well, so much for many ideas, and many ways (read pluralistic society where
people are free to associte with their peers).  I find that you and others
have a very narrow view of what is good for the community.  Here is what is
good Ben.  Parties.  That sums it up.  Toon-Town was 21+, and it was a
GREAT party.  GK is the same way(21+).  The Gathering & Basics are great
parties.  They are 21-- generally although all are welcome.  The idea here
Mr. Homogenous is DIVERSITY.  ALL clubs should be a little different and
should cater to different tastes.  I see this as a good thing, catering to
many, you see it as a bad thing.  One day you will wake up and accept
divergent views and accept the differences in peoples tastes as something
wonderful.  Until then I'll wait until you see the light of it all.  As for
everyone going at their own pace.  EXACTLY!  Their own place and their own
space.  Good concept, why not respect it. Check it.

You have been misinformed.  How is knowing the promoter akin to getting
around the law.  There is NO LAW that says no in-out's.  There are PLENTY
of laws against loitering and creating a nuisance. That is WHY there are no
in-out's Ben.  As for labasting 21-- for getting into 21+ clubs, you are
right.  They do NOT belong there and should be taken out of the club, lest
the people who have paid under proper pretense be kicked out due to someone
21-- selfish and childish behaviour.  What underground are you talking
about, furthermore WHAT reporting?  I did not say ANYTHING about reporting
these infringements upon the rights of 21+ to enjoy a club without it being
busted because of some 21--.  I just said they don't belong.  You are
engaging in hypebole.  And I won't have that at all.  Check it.

You have been misinformed. Look, I as a promoter have certain rights and
responsibilities.  I am responsible for providing you a nice space, good
sound, and safety.  Because I have decided to enter the world of "raves"
and becuase I beleive in what they represent am more than willing to spend
tens of THOUSANDS of dollars in that quest.  The idea, one killer party. 
The return $<3000> short.  THAT my friend is conviction.  This affords me
certain priviledges with others who do the same.  Most of my firends do NOT
throw parties.  But I am more than happy to share my privs with others
because THAT'S what this is all about, SHARING.  As for me ragging on white
het's I am now certain you cannot read.  I know my spelling needs help
but....I ragged on steriod hillbilly het's who have cuased plenty of fights
on this scene.  I've seen em and broekn these suburbanites up.  I have also
ragged on the homogeneous nature of raves.  And they (primarily the 21--)
are primarily full of white kids.  There is nothing wrong with this at all.
 I just prefer to be in a party that is waaaay more mixed.  But I guess
that does not sit well with you huh?  I guess Crunch's statement of "big
black goon" is more in line with your train of thought.  Man, that pretty
much says it all about how you twist and distort the obvious for the sake
of some misguided ideal.  Diversity is great, anything less is a farce. No
more hillbilly parties with a bunch of okies unless there are plenty of
carmel bits & chocolate chips.  Check it.

You have been misinformed.  I said weak in the beginning then gave PROPS to
them for doing a rene.  As for the Late Train that is NOT my party.  I have
been to a few of them but they occur on nights that I usually have to work.
 It is this "idea' that that space was sooooo cool and soooo new when it
has been broken in, and done before.  So much so the kops are well aware of
it.  Keep having stuff there and it will get busted, sound equip.
confiscated and other harsh shit.  Look, I beleive that UG's no matter what
are GREAT.  Could give a fuck who throws them, as long as they go off.  I
have gone to 2 FMM's, and don't like 'em.  But because they try ot have
them in diff locations and keep the party mobile I have little to say. 
They are doing more to keep the UG scene alive than anyone else.  In the
post I said NOTHING about the quality of the party, just that the space
itslef was weak, used, and done.  But becuase you are looking for a problem
you found one.  I am getting worked up about the only-way-is-our-way
attitude that you and others have.  You dislike the space, you dislike the
promoter, you dislike the culture, you dislike almost everything, Yet how
unwilling you are to spend thousands of your own dollars to make a diff. 
This is the hypocracy.

As for the constant bashing of my connections and me being a promoter. 
There are many on this board who are comped at parties while  YOU have to
spend $15-$20 to attend.  They don't talk about it.  I do.  Why?  Becuase I
don't beleive in secrets and other BS.  There are MANY facests to this
culture that you and others are unaware.  I am giving you my perspective as
a person who for most of the time has PAID to get into events, and STILL
PAY (yep, I may get comped, and have 3 on the list, but I will throw down
$45-$60 to get them in.  I am not rich by any means, but I ALWAYS pay.  One
way or another I pay!  When have YOU done that).  As for the "if you know
the promoter"  you're all cuaght up in making a point that you lost the
joke.  Not all that uncommon, but the thing is, read carefully now, "1015
has FREE water.  There is no 0.50 charge!"  (during Sunday morn) Maybe if
you went to events there you might have found this out.  Stop the hype.

Check it.

You have been misinformed.  What mudslinging.  The fact is if you know
about the space and don't like it stay home.  Don't go if you know that its
gonna be smoked out etc.  In other words be RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN
ACTIONS.  How this is mudslinging escapes me.  Your constant hyperbole does
not however so I advise you to check it.

You are misinformed.  The licensing says 21+.  The fact people go there is
due to them NOT wanting to mix with 21--.  This is wrong in your eyes.  In
mine it has always been ok for people to freely associtate with their
peers.  This is called FREEDOM.  Maybe if you understood the concept a bit
better you would have less complaints about people not attending 21--
events.  Oh yeah, there has been at LEAST 1 GK closed due to a 21-- being
present.  Wicked was closed becuase of overcrowding OUTSIDE and well as all
the hallways blocekd with people inside.  A fire hazard sir.  But you could
give a fuck about that and the people who are in such a fire trap.  That is
why that "black goon" told Mr. Draper to get in or get out.  For the safety
of many he denied 1 person an exclusive privvy.  Man  what a concept.
Breathe-in breathe-out, blink. Check it.

You have been misinformed.  I said the one thing I like that other parties
lack is diversity.  But somehow in that hyped-up mind of your you have
twisted that around to make it seem as though THAT is a bad thing.  Well
let's lay it out.  What IS bad is the homogeneous nature of raves of late. 
I don't like it.  Moreso than smokers that shit burns me up.  I do not like
it that gays/lesbians who FOUNDED the fucking house scene have been going
to their own clubs becuase "raves" became the mecca of horny aggro het's. 
I like it when I see people of ALL backgrounds grooving together.  That is
MY criteria, and MANY share it.  But you don't.  As long as there is music
and your buddies there that's all you need.  Well ok, to each his own.  But
I respect that concept, whereas you do not.  If anyone can be called a pc
elitist it is you.  You have a very narrow view of what makes/breaks this
scene.  If the scene can accomodate the many interests and tastes of the
community then it will thrive.  That has NOT been happening.  The more
homogenoues it has gotten the quicker it has withered.  Diversity is
strength and fueling that diversity is a big job.  It just takes the right
people, the right vibe, the right 'tude to do it.  And I am all about that.

Maybe if you were not so concerned with the class schtick
(promoter/partier) you would understand that they are all the same.  People
who throw these gigs for you to enjoy have done so for many reasons, but
most of all the people who have been doing it for 2-3 years beleive in what
they do. We don't sit around and decide who is in or out, most of the
converstaion have been on raising the quality of parties and giving people
even MORE for their money.  You can't say that about LA.  Most of the
people who throw decent parties are the same people who used to pay to get
into parties.  They decided that they wanted something different so they
did it themselves.  And now you have the Gathering, Sharon, Basics,
Foundation, Vortex, Origin, YSH, Together, WIcked, FMM, and others.  You
have lost sight of this.  I am not an elitist pig or whatever
label-of-the-day you want to call me.  I could care less what you call me. 
People get compe'd for a variety of reasons.  Personally I think it's
funny, and NEVER take the shit seriously.  Thats why I say things like "if
you know the promoter"  becuase in essence that will have very little to do
with having a good time.  Either the party is good or it's bad.  All those
promoter privies are just that.  And they exist like any other support
mechanism and are there, for people who do a certain thing, to provide a
small break for them.  Hell if a person has spent $5000 putting on a show
why should they not get a little from a friend who has done the same thing
and understands the headache and joy that goes with doing a party.  So we
comp each other.  Is that so bad?  You mean if a friend of yours wanted a
favor from you you would not do it?  If an SFR needed help you would not
provide it?  I guess that I was mistaken in thinking that I could share
some things with you.  Oh well...stay myopic, it's easier that way. Check
it.

Crunch has not a leg to stand on...should'nt have gone.  And that shit
about a "big black goon" is still BS, but ben thinks this is ok so...

Nope I will not make the call.  I have been to both and each have had their
good points and bad points.  I'll leave it at that since each have their
own vibe and are caterign to diff tastes.  Diversity, even in parties, is
ALWAYS a good thing.

You have been misinformed.  You are comparing apples to oranges.  Drugs are
a LOW-PRIORITY item on SFPD list of no-no's.  Underage drinking, due to
current hysteria, is on the A-list.  Facts of life.  So I deal within that
realm. 21-- stay out of 21+ clubs.  What's the problem?  Oh yes I said
nothing about obeying the law, just that others (like the cops) will
enforce it.  John S. Lee or no.  Not much choice for now Roy. (BTW - in the
past in SF you could go(21--) to 174 no problem, but things have changed
since they have been busted before). Check it.

On a brighter note, San Jose is becoming the center for a number of truly
happening events. Every other Monday, Rick Preston and Harry Who host a party
called Free Life at the F/X which is consistently cool and they've just
started a new party called Progress which is held every Tuesday night at a
place called Club Oz. 


***Ya! I'm going to that tonight! Is anybody else going?
   I've never went to Club OZ before, but what the hay
   it's worth a try. Plus I saw DJ Julius Papp's name
   on an earlier post of this place, and he is one of my
   favorite. He plays good acid jazz, hip hop stuff. I
   hope he is there tonight!!! Anyways if anyone is going
   e-mail me back so we can meet up in there or something!

I decided this paragraph was especially insidious since it asks me to leave
so I'll reply. Look, I have many complaints about parties.  And many gripes
against promoters and others.  Do you know what I do?  TAKE ACTION (or in
my case INACTION).  I do NOT like massives.  I don't complain about them. 
I may comment on what I think they will be (usually correct), but that's
it.  Since I don't like them I STAY AWAY from them.  I don't go, after
stating I dislike them, then re-appear here to aire the obvious discontent
I have with my actions.  THIS IS THE HYPOCRACY.  I go to VERY few 21--
events, but I won't bag em.  I don't go to Sharon's or the Gatherings
(except for a few) because the crowd and vibe does not suit me.  But I
don't bag 'em.  And when I do go I know exactly what to expect, not becuase
I know the promoter or some "inside track".  Plain and simple I've been to
the party before and I know what to expect.  So when I see people complain,
and bitch, and complain, and bitch about things they have already made
apparent it pisses me off!  So since you have decided that the things I say
are of little use, tell me what is?  Tell me EXACTLY what you want to hear,
and how you want to hear it.  Of course I will not oblige BUT since you
only want certain kinds of info please STATE for the record what this info
is.  If I can't take it I will treat it like I treat parties, and stay
silent (aka stay away bka go away).  But please be sure to enforce it
equally lest you be given the title hypocrite.  But I DO want to know what
you, the god of the list with his own "inside track", deem acceptable and
not.  I am morbidly curious.  I am curious of why I can't say "diversity"
and Crunch can say "black goon", I am curious.  I am curious as to why I
can't say that I like or even love 21+ while others can state otherwise.  I
am curious why you can't read veiled sarcasm, yet read so clearly the words
of others. I am curios as to why others can debate and state their case yet
when I state mine I am labeled, stamped, filed, indexed, briefed,
de-breifed, and numbered.  Yes I am curious.  But like I said, if you lay
down the law (since you're the man in charge here), and I don't like it I
will bow out, no problem.  I await your answer. Until then...

First off, thanks to Glen, Rick, and Tim for pulling this thing together and
doing a great job.

I packed my Denon, my Biamp, and ~300 CDs in a large shipping box that was
BARELY under Delta's maximum weight (70 pounds).  I actually had to throw
about 100 CDs in my clothes bag in order to level things out.  Then when I got
to the airport, the ticket agent didn't even bother to weigh it.

Upon arrival in Seattle, I called Glen and Mike to see what the status was.  I
then went hiking in the Northern Cascades (great views, bad bugs) on Thursday
and Friday afternoon.  When I got back, I gave Glen another call and he was
very excited about the situation.  He'd contacted a local promoter about it,
and 10,000 watts of sound had been arranged along with a generator.  I had
brought up a small quantity of vinyl as well, and Glen stated there would be
turntables there.

When Gretchen and I arrived at the gate, there was one car waiting and nobody
else there.  The gate was locked.  Soon the sound van arrived and a bit of
discussion ensued.  Someone stated that maybe they were up at the site and
they'd come down periodically.  I volunteered to hike up there (about a mile
and a half) to find out.  I jumped the fence and started the trek.  About a
half mile in, I noticed lights coming up the road.  The gate had been opened
and everyone had been let in.

We arrived at the quarry to find nobody there.  It was a great spot, secluded,
large, interesting, with one catch.  Trespassing big-time.  It was government
property and the promoter had cut a lock and replaced it with his own to let
everyone in.  Despite this news, the sound guys started setting up and soon I
had patched in my mixer and CD player.  No turntables were in sight.

Things kicked off for a small crowd of 20 at the time.  I wondered how many
more people would show up during the night.  About after an hour of playing,
around 80 people had arrived and were gathered around a nearby campfire.  Only
a few people were dancing, about ten, but they were ripping it hard.  I had
the equipment on Gretchen's 4-Runner tailgate, with my back to the crowd.  It
was like flying blind, I periodically had to turn around to see what was going
on.

More than few people wandered up to see what was going on with the drastically
different setup.  A few people asked me about how the Denon worked and I
showed them, but more just gaped at the stacks of CDs I'd lugged 800 miles.
Some other DJs had turned up and they had brought a coffin with 1200's.  I
plugged them into one of my tape inputs and they were ready to be fired off.
Meanwhile they got blitzed out of their minds.  I talked to one who was really
friendly, I can't remember his name, but he stated his big claim to fame was
the fact that he had DJ'd for "Rave Called Sharon" (ugh).  At about 2:00 I
quit and slid things over to the other mixer.

Over the course of the night DJ's kept showing up in hoards.  What
disappointed me was the extreme attitude most of these guys carried.  Very few
of them danced, and most just hung around the tables in a circle.  There were
mixed talents, but there were two guys in particular who played really well.
Too bad I have no idea who they were.

People still didn't dance in force until about the middle of the third DJ.
This was about 3:30, and the only thing I can attribute it to was the hardcore
showing up later.  My set was all over the place and nothing really seemed to
spark any fires.  With the exception of one ambient/trance DJ, the other guys
just played fairly straightforward house.

At 6:00, Gretchen and I really needed to leave.  We had a full schedule
planned for Sunday, and sleeping through half of it really didn't facilitate
that fact.  My equipment was still being used, albeit just as a pass-through.
I managed to convince Tim that I could hot-swap the stuff off with just a
minimal break in sound.  We did so, but then I was informed that I couldn't
get out of the quarry.  The guy with the key had disappeared.  I didn't know
if I was being bullshitted, so I bullshitted right back.  I told them I needed
to be at the airport, ASAP.  It wasn't making me very happy that all of a
sudden this had turned into a lock-in early in the morning without warning.
Gretchen calmed me down and we agreed that we would stay until 8:00 when they
would unlock the gate.  I started to fall asleep in her truck until then.

Suddenly the call came to shut everything down.  I was mostly packed up, so we
closed the truck up and got out.  On the way out, we saw the police on the way
in.  I have no idea what happened to the promoters, but I feared for the
worst.  They were blatently trespassing, no bones about it.  If they managed
to pack everything up in time, I'd imagine they would have gotten out safely,
but the amount of time it took to unload made me realize that it was going to
take a while to pack up.

All in all, it was a good time.  Gretchen is a rave newbie and she danced hard
all night.  We took a short nap inside her truck and it was really weird to
wake up and see video being projected on a rock wall outside the truck.  I was
pleased to meet Arias, Glen, and Rick.  I wish you folks could be down here
this weekend for the desert show.

My response to John Lee's comments...

I am only describing the particular individual,  don't care about color...
Didn't mean to implicate anything,  and sorry I came across that way.

Then they should at least put in some fans to keep the place ventilated,
then nobody will ever HAVE to go into the hallways to get a gasp of fresh air.

>Now I do have sympathy, but you know about clubs.  They have smoke.  You

Smoke I can deal with as long as I can ocassionally go outside and breath 
deeply to flush out my lungs and inhale my medication.   Naturally I am
even deprived of THAT action.    

>Let's see...since you went into the club at your own recognizance, and
>since you knew about the environ (you have posted previously that you hated
>smoky clubs and complained once about GK before) then who is responsible
>for your illness.

This is NOT the point,  other people also have complained of ill-effects of
being cooped up in a smokey atmosphere.   I am not the ONLY one complaining.
For instance,  at the earlier Wickid raves held over at the Sound Factory
was completly acceptable for me, dispite the failure of the air conditioner,
because I coule always go into another part more ventilated.   Also the goons
were a lot more reasonable.

>The OWNER of King St.  Is a kind man who I think is bed ridden with an
>illness.  He has given back to the community (primarily gay/lesbian) by

If THATS the case,  then perhaps someone who knows the owner should inform 
him of these conditions,  as I'm sure he is pashionate and would understand
and do something about it if he knew about it.   In that case,   I would NEVER
target someone like that.   

By the way,  I've been seeing a lot of duplicate mail messages.   Is there
something wrong with the Mailserve?

Sean says,  in response to the bad places list...:

Then sometimes the promoters don't know in advance how the club owners 
set up security or policy until the partys start.

>As for the constant and annoying complaints about smoking...tough!  Look
>you're in a CLUB, people smoke, always have!

I have no problem dealing with smoke,  I can always get away from it,  as long
as I can get some fresh air from outside or near a well ventilated fan.   Why
do you think there is so much anti-smoking attitude in other places besides
clubs?   It's because second hand smoke IS DEFINATELY HARMFUL.    I can so
a pretty good job of avoiding it,  as long as I'm not deprived of an
opportunity
to get away from it and fill my lungs with real air once in a while.   Again,
I expect smoke,  and DO know how to deal with it.

Geoff White says...

>As far as I'm concerned the lesson here should be ...
>THAT WE NEED TO GET OUR PARTIES OUT OF THE FUCKIN ALCOHOL RIDDEN,
>MAFIA RUN, POLICE PAYOFF CLUBS and back into nature or at least on
>private land where we can do these things right.

Right on dude...!!

Anyway,  I have replied to SOME but not all responses here,  and apologize
for all the disruptions I have caused and extra net bandwidth.   I am just
making a point that SOME club security folks have NO compassion for ones
health.   I hope that other people can agree with me on that subject.

I remain...  and still want to rave on...

Cheers

There were three goons. A white male, a black male, and a female. Is
referring to the black one a racist statement?

Maybe I'm taking this personally, but the idea ** wasn't ** to have
the dopest newest space, the idea was to have the thing happen and go

Ah.  Didn't see this paragraph.  Non-busted outdoor freebies?  Sounds
like "Welcome Home" to me... oh, but yeah, that was "weak with a

Personally, i don't care what age the people i'm partying with are...
I think the rave scene over in SF must be pretty different from ours
if the 21+ crowd actually go out of their way to avoid all-ages
parties....  But then, over here, the rave scene is viewed primarily
as a young person's scene...

  John> You are misinformed.  The licensing says 21+.  The fact people
  John> go there is due to them NOT wanting to mix with 21--.

Well, as i say, i find this really weird.  If that's what they want,
then it's their right; but personally i prefer diversity....  young
and old partying together....


I have to say, i do wonder whether most of the party goers at 21+
events actually care that they're 21+.... but then I don't know the SF
scene, so i dare say you're probably right...

Of course, with the drinking age being 18 in the UK, there's no such
thing as a 21+ club here (at least not that i've ever heard of) so i
guess it's not surprizing that the idea seems pretty alien to me....

Hi all,

For any of you who might be interested, synergy is now the proud borrower
of public airtime.  Our new bi-weekly show debuts this Wednesday at 6:00
p.m. and will be called synergy presents.  Format is still under
consideration, but will most likely involve local interviews and
commentary (not necessarily rave-related) mixed with trippy, drippy graphics.
Our first show, this Wednesday, is titled "abstract expression" and is a
completely ambient ride into the digital fluid.

I'd love to hear feedback.

Enjoy,

Tony

All of this about "if you know the producer" really turns me off...

If it's not the right way for everybody, no questions asked,
you're running things wrong and I'm not gonna come back.
People shouldn't have to be the in the right circle
to be treated right, John.

Hi Folx--
 
After several months of just virtually lurking
in the background, deleting 30 or 40 messages
at a time, reading some with great interest
(like the latest brouhaha over "faschist" club
owners), and chatting with but a few of you, here
I am again!
 
I've been planning for some time to tweak my
career a bit--and I've finally had the opportunity!
I've chosen to teach at an alternativehigh school
our district has, called The Ark, with 120 students
and six teachers.  I'm really excited about this,
but what does it have to do with raving, you ask.
Well, I've already gotten together with chris, the
sysop of our local cruzio! network with plans for
setting up email opportunities for young people,
telecommunicating between schools and newsgroups
out there.  Some parts of the country have more things
going in this area than we seem to (the latest WIRED
has a good article about schools doing this).  So--
if any of you out there are interested in helping in
any way--even tips and info--I'd gladly welcome it!
 
I saw some of you at the last rave I attended--the
July 4 Freedom in 3D with Tim Leary and virtual
reality machines; I saw some more folx at at South
Bay Luncha couple weeks later.  I'm planning on coming
up to YSHthis Thursday, so I hope to see even more!
My keyboarding is as bad as ever, but my dancin' feet
are eager to hit the floor!
 
World's Rip Van Winkle raver,
Will

Hi All,

Well,  hopefully I can provide a semi-lucid account of the events from my
end.  The site we picked was government public use land about a 1/2 mile
from an abandoned Nike missile base.  The base itself would have been ideal
save for the fact that there were residentials about 500 yards from it, so
we went to the rock and clay quarry further up the road.  

We got to the site about 11pm and had everyone involved set up.  Pete did
an EXCELLENT job with the music.  He was very conscientious about playing a
range of tunes and tried very hard to get the groove going.  I cannot
express my gratitude enough to Pete for being a part of this.  Very BIG
kudos to Timothy of Tuff productions who helped organize the sound and
almost everything else!   

Unfortunately, people had some difficulty adjusting to the surroundings as
it was very different from anything that has been seen and done up here. 
It did get better in time though.  :-)

I must reiterate the newness of the scene and the high degree of inbreeding
inherent in the Seattle scene. My whole purpose in initiating events like
FreeVibe is to break the old school patterns established and hopefully
stimulate the growth of a more open, freer vibe (pun totally intended :-) 
).  It wasn't very long ago that a majority of the dj's that played on
Saturday night would have laughed at the idea of doing a free show.  I
think that they're now beginning to see that non-profit cooperative efforts
are essential to their art and their livelihoods.  Yes, there were
definitely attitudes.  But I think that in time and by example, we can show
people that some of the best things in life are definitely free.

I think that the dj's Pete liked and referred to were Donald Glaude (heavy
set with dreads) and Hebegebe (also heavy set, brown hair, goatee). 
Without exception a couple of the most talented dj's here in the North
West, not to mention the coolest I've had the pleasure to work with. 
Special props go to Dervish (Nathan) who spun some really wicked tribal
trance mixes.

Kollaps of PlayDoh visuals brought some new video work worthy of a gallery
show.  It was all very trippy analog video feedback that was projected on
one of the quarry walls.  A friend of mine, Jeffrey, went up in front of
the projection and did a shadow dance to the music and visuals that had
people clapping and cheering.  It was very beautiful!

There were many memorable things that happened that night.  However, this
mail is getting too long already!  But the main thing for me, is that a
group of very dedicated people with GREAT hearts, threw their talents and
energy into an event that was free of charge and done for the love of the
vibe.  It WORKED people, and it ROCKED!!!  We've thrown a rock into the
pond the vibrations are just beginning to spread.  We had over a hundred
people grooving and vibing to 10K watts of butt pumping sound in nature's
glory from 12am to 7am!  

Thanks to a sentry system and some very nice park employees, we had plenty
of warning before the forces of Babylon came to impose their will.  I was
in one of the last cars out of the site as cruisers came speeding into the
area.  We just smiled and waved our goodbyes!  :-) 

Thanks again to EVERYONE who who contributed and to everyone who had
partaken of the event. Love to you all!
Peace!

Tigger

To: Glenn Fajardo,USA

First off, thanks to Glen, Rick, and Tim for pulling this thing together
and
doing a great job.

I packed my Denon, my Biamp, and ~300 CDs in a large shipping box that was
BARELY under Delta's maximum weight (70 pounds).  I actually had to throw
about 100 CDs in my clothes bag in order to level things out.  Then when I
got
to the airport, the ticket agent didn't even bother to weigh it.

Upon arrival in Seattle, I called Glen and Mike to see what the status was.
 I
then went hiking in the Northern Cascades (great views, bad bugs) on
Thursday
and Friday afternoon.  When I got back, I gave Glen another call and he was
very excited about the situation.  He'd contacted a local promoter about
it,
and 10,000 watts of sound had been arranged along with a generator.  I had
brought up a small quantity of vinyl as well, and Glen stated there would
be
turntables there.

When Gretchen and I arrived at the gate, there was one car waiting and
nobody
else there.  The gate was locked.  Soon the sound van arrived and a bit of
discussion ensued.  Someone stated that maybe they were up at the site and
they'd come down periodically.  I volunteered to hike up there (about a
mile
and a half) to find out.  I jumped the fence and started the trek.  About a
half mile in, I noticed lights coming up the road.  The gate had been
opened
and everyone had been let in.

We arrived at the quarry to find nobody there.  It was a great spot,
secluded,
large, interesting, with one catch.  Trespassing big-time.  It was
government
property and the promoter had cut a lock and replaced it with his own to
let
everyone in.  Despite this news, the sound guys started setting up and soon
I
had patched in my mixer and CD player.  No turntables were in sight.

Things kicked off for a small crowd of 20 at the time.  I wondered how many
more people would show up during the night.  About after an hour of
playing,
around 80 people had arrived and were gathered around a nearby campfire. 
Only
a few people were dancing, about ten, but they were ripping it hard.  I had
the equipment on Gretchen's 4-Runner tailgate, with my back to the crowd. 
It
was like flying blind, I periodically had to turn around to see what was
going
on.

More than few people wandered up to see what was going on with the
drastically
different setup.  A few people asked me about how the Denon worked and I
showed them, but more just gaped at the stacks of CDs I'd lugged 800 miles.
Some other DJs had turned up and they had brought a coffin with 1200's.  I
plugged them into one of my tape inputs and they were ready to be fired
off.
Meanwhile they got blitzed out of their minds.  I talked to one who was
really
friendly, I can't remember his name, but he stated his big claim to fame
was
the fact that he had DJ'd for "Rave Called Sharon" (ugh).  At about 2:00 I
quit and slid things over to the other mixer.

Over the course of the night DJ's kept showing up in hoards.  What
disappointed me was the extreme attitude most of these guys carried.  Very
few
of them danced, and most just hung around the tables in a circle.  There
were
mixed talents, but there were two guys in particular who played really
well.
Too bad I have no idea who they were.

People still didn't dance in force until about the middle of the third DJ.
This was about 3:30, and the only thing I can attribute it to was the
hardcore
showing up later.  My set was all over the place and nothing really seemed
to
spark any fires.  With the exception of one ambient/trance DJ, the other
guys
just played fairly straightforward house.

At 6:00, Gretchen and I really needed to leave.  We had a full schedule
planned for Sunday, and sleeping through half of it really didn't
facilitate
that fact.  My equipment was still being used, albeit just as a
pass-through.
I managed to convince Tim that I could hot-swap the stuff off with just a
minimal break in sound.  We did so, but then I was informed that I couldn't
get out of the quarry.  The guy with the key had disappeared.  I didn't
know
if I was being bullshitted, so I bullshitted right back.  I told them I
needed
to be at the airport, ASAP.  It wasn't making me very happy that all of a
sudden this had turned into a lock-in early in the morning without warning.
Gretchen calmed me down and we agreed that we would stay until 8:00 when
they
would unlock the gate.  I started to fall asleep in her truck until then.

Suddenly the call came to shut everything down.  I was mostly packed up, so
we
closed the truck up and got out.  On the way out, we saw the police on the
way
in.  I have no idea what happened to the promoters, but I feared for the
worst.  They were blatently trespassing, no bones about it.  If they
managed
to pack everything up in time, I'd imagine they would have gotten out
safely,
but the amount of time it took to unload made me realize that it was going
to
take a while to pack up.

All in all, it was a good time.  Gretchen is a rave newbie and she danced
hard
all night.  We took a short nap inside her truck and it was really weird to
wake up and see video being projected on a rock wall outside the truck.  I
was
pleased to meet Arias, Glen, and Rick.  I wish you folks could be down here
this weekend for the desert show.

Yaaaawwwwnnnnnn, can we talk about raves rather than just getting into flame
wars? Every space has its plusses and minuses which is unique to the space.
Every promoter has their plusses and minuses which is unique to them. Every
raver has their own unique headspace on a particular night. Add it all up and
roll the dice and maybe the raver will enjoy themselves and maybe not.

90% of whether you enjoy yourselves or not is in your own head, so make it a
quest to discover that mental state where you always have fun. If you're at
a party and not enjoying yourself, leave. If it's too expensive to sample
parties that way, go to cheap or free ones. If you still can't enjoy yourself
stay home.

So, make your own fun. This mystical quality called "Vibe" which we are always
talking about as the ultimate standard of rave quality is entirely dependent
on the attendees of the party. It has little to do with space or promoters or
how good the music/sound/visuals are. If you go to a rave and just wait for it
to happen, it never will.

It seems to me that if people are so MISINFORMED about things they quote
directly from your posts and then comment on, then *perhaps* you are not 
expressing yourself clearly. 

I think I liked the ne-raves' "hardcore is evil" wars better.  Where's

    They don't have to be free, but I really like them outdoors.
    So do lots of other people.
    (So where were all of you weekend-before-last for Penelope's Web???)
    Indoors, most often you find that...

    That's a big part of the problem.  "Clubs", a.k.a. bars, are not really
    designed for raves.  What would it take to create more spaces that are?

    YSH is great and I hope that they can keep it going for a LONG time!
    If not there, then somewhere else.

    I don't understand.  Are those the only two 21-- clubs in the city?
    Are you saying that even those will throw you out at 2:30am if you
    are under 21?  (I'm almost 21*2, btw).

>   (zoning & licensing)

    What kind of zoning/licensing is required for 21--?  You seem to have
    some expertise in this area, and this would be useful information.

Hullooo...
I just returned from a Fantastic Voyage to SF.  Since there have been many 
reviews of the events we (me Chris and Guy - Team Canada) attended, I won't get 
into details. A few standout memories tho: 

-Basics- the pictures of all the army Officers on the wall right when you walk 
 in (if they could talk!). 
-The Basics floor-gropers near the water booth.
-The drive to Point Reyes (thanks Rob - energyman!) and the long steam of 
 headlights (like the last scene in 'Field of Dreams').
-Passing out in Leah's bedroom during the BBQ (finally- sleep).
-Tam in th GeEK hat :) 
-the fmr: We're listening to a walkman?!?!!'
-krieg(sp?) and doug zim. in the parking lot, with the 2-fisting nitrous 
 raverette... one balloon for each hand! 
-that beautiful... utterly stunning site- full points to Brian! Dana summed 
 it up "a sight that will stick in my mind til a few years after im dead"
-and of course meeting so many net.ravers... i just get the warm fuzzies! 

extra special mahalos to cin (and jeno) for her hospitality. and for showing
me and Doug around SF, what a beautiful city... *sigh* 

I ended up in Concord Wed and I *sadly* didnt make it to YSH... but im currently
workin on a SF boondoggle in October for the seybold conference :)

Again, thanks to all for your hospitality. Chris, Guy and I had a great time
and please please please let me know if/when any of you have northwest 
travel plans.

Well I think an individual CAN pick and choose their laws, but they must
be willing to suffer the consequences of their actions.  Raves are evolving
from a gray market fringe activity (check out the "happenings" around
New York City in 1965.  The point is if you are trying to promote in a way
that you 
	
1) are not willing to wind up in Jail
2) wanting to have some sense of security at your parties.
3) Want to throw them in San Francisco and not some place like sonoma.

You have to play by the rules.  Even when I talk to the police at undergrounds,
It gives you alot more barganing power, if there aren't people swilling
beer, lighting up pipes, and filling nitrous baloons. If they don't see it,
then they can only cite you for the park being closed.   If i can
say to them, hey walk around, we have nothing to hide, then it escalates
up to wheather they are bust us cause we're dangerous or wheather to let it
go like "the current college prank" like streaking in the seventies.
A club is a bussiness, it has to make a profit or at least break even to be
even available for parties. They came down on 174 , well , let's just say
that I`ve been to some really grEAt parties there in my time. And the Door
was one of trhe coolest around.  They most likely got in trouble.
The bottom line is it's hard for a cop to go into a crowd and single people
out and force them to take a drug test, they can't do that... yet... So
they can't shut you down for "drug use" unless they see it going on or
they make a bust for the sale of a drug.  If they make a bust for the sale,
they can hassle the club about having adequate security to keep out the drug
dealers, no backpacks... they're loaded with ecstasy:), no wather bottles,
their loaded with Liquid LSD...

 THIS IS WHY WE GOTTA MOVE OUR PARTIES OUTTA THE CLUBS!!

Yes It's true, if you want to dot your i"s and cross your t"s you should
not have underage people in your club, the cops can hassle you and give you
a fine, fines cost money.  It`s also in your best interest to discourage all
forms of consumption of controlled substances, because some stupid kid will
smuggle in a beer or sell a joint or a hit to an undercover cop and really
make some people upset. Oh and make sure that the girls are not allowed to 
use the men's room, she might "make" some fucking asshole rape her.

WE GOTTA HAVE PARTIES OUT OF THE CLUBS!

The creative freedom that the club environment provides is getting to limiting.
We need to cultivate relationships where we can set up a better quality
of Temporary Autonomous Zone the the club venu provides.  

Check it.

I applaud you Ben for your message to John. His whole attitude was

were his own opinions, but it was his attitude that he was putting 
forth.  "Check It". If I read that one more time, I was going to 
scream.  Anyway you put it better than I could.

    It seems to draw from at least 2 generations out here.  I haven't
    really seen much of a division by age, except that imposed by the law
    where alcohol is served.  I'm a little confused on that point as well,
    as most of the concert venues serve beer, and they have no problem
    letting underage folks in, but they can't serve them alcohol.  Usually
    you have to get a wristband or get your hand stamped after they look
    at your ID.  Yet clubs don't even let you in the door if you are underage.
    What determines which set of rules apply to a venue?

>     John> You are misinformed.  The licensing says 21+.  The fact people

    I think it's 'in spite of' rather than 'due to'.  As you said, there
    aren't many 21-- places to go to, so it's not too surprising that
    most of the 21+ go to 21+ places.

    This is a very Puritanical country, and that takes precedence over
    Constitutional rights such as freedom of religion and freedom to
    peacefully assemble.

JSL -- Ok, so you're continuing to run with you're capitalist schtick
of siding with those in positions of power/money/control -- that's your
choice. However, if you're gonna run with capitalism, then you better
do it right. One aspect of capitalism in the service/entertainment
industry is that THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. This seems to be a
forgotten aspect of "service" of late (whether the service is a
restaurant, theatre, concert venue, or rave).

Nowadays, instead of competition for the best value, service, or
whatever, we're  seeing the increasing attitude on the part of the
promoters -- "we're here, we're doing it, we're rich, so we must be
right, fuck off, and you can leave if you don't like it (and no, we're
not giving your money back you little worm!)." As if by their 
well-connected, know-it-all hipsterness, they become entitled to our
money.

Well, to those kinds of promoters, I proclaim a loud "fuck you" right
back at them. And better than that, I'll be happy to slander them (or
see them slandered) on public mailing lists, newspapers, magazines,
radio, or what have you. They DESERVE to lose money for their rudeness,
mistakes, bad business practices, and bad customer relations. They
don't deserve respect if they don't respect the customer. I couldn't
give a flying fuck if they lose money because we're boycotting --
that's the risk they take in running an enterprise. If they don't want
that risk (or the upside rewards), then they should go out and get a
real job. Or learn how to run their business properly.

The jist of my argument is that If you're going to play in a free
market, then people have the right to be informed of problems without
fear of censorship/flames/whatever. The CUSTOMER NEEDS TO REMEMBER THAT
THEY ARE ALWAYS RIGHT. The  promoter/venue/bouncers are there to serve,
and in the process of doing that, if they make some money, then more
power to them.

Some customers are sheep and will take whatever they get. However, the
people on sfraves are not sheep. We're here to learn, build community,
look out for each other, and inform each other.  So people should feel
free to discuss bad venues, asshole promoters, and any of the scam
artists that have become part of the scene. We have a right as
prospective customers to inform each other of problems so that we can
avoid getting ripped-off by greedy capitalist promoter-skum (tm). If
our "boycott" causes a promoter to lose business and $$$ then so be it
(earning money is no-one's god given right -- check it!).

But some promoters are acting like they're doing us some big favor by
charging us $15.00 to lock us in an unventilated room, with smegma-pit
bathrooms, idiot fascist (note spelling) bouncers, no water policy, no
fresh air policy, nothing. Fuck them. Smart people will take into
consideration a negative review of a promoter/venue/event and vote with
their feet.

So lets let the discussion continue without getting at each others
throats. These are all opinions after all! We all have a right to learn
and become wise. 

In conclusion,  I, for one, will never set foot in One Step Beyond, and
will resist attending any Wicked/Groove-Kitchen events at 174 King St.
I tell these opinions to all-and-sundry in the hope that promoters LOSE
when they choose those venues. Organize and revolt -- It's the only way
for the powerless to not get screwed by the greedy. If enough of us
follow suit, then our consumer-advocacy will have worked.

Sorry, I forgot to mention that the show is on Viacom--should be Channel 51.
I'm not sure if it will make it outside of S.F. or not.

I agree that San Jose is getting better for dancing. I have always 
enjoyed Fresh Fridays at FX, but I can now enjoy dancing during the 
week.  
Free Life on Monday nights is a great place to continue the weekend.

I am sad that I missed the party Saturday night at Latte and Laundry.  
I was there the Friday night before till 5 and it was really mellow, 
but the music was good.  I am going to go to Progress tonite and 
check that out. I agree it should be good to night with Julius Papp 
spinning.  I also recommend Thursday nights at AJAX for Acid Jazz 
with Harry Who.  You cannot really dance, but the music is great 
to listen to.  You could always go to Oasis on Thursday nights, but 
in my opinion it is only good every once in awhile. Wednesday at 
Toons used to be great however that has been over for awhile now. 
Does anyone else know of anything going on in SJ on Wednesdays?
 
There are finally alternatives to driving to San Francisco, we just 
have to get the 2am law lifted.  

See you at Progress tonite,

JSLee, while in the past you have been merely annoying, the above
shows just how far your head is rammed up yer butt.  What the hell do
you know better than Ethan and crew about throwing parties?  

Vortex wasn't all that great, IMHO.  Check it.

Ethan is a great guy.  Why flick your crap at his attempts to have a
fun little party?

Your "Get out and walk in the promoters shoes" bullshit really pisses
me off, as the members of sfraves HAVE thrown some really great parties.
The first Connection is probably one of THE BEST events I've been to.


Rival that and maybe I'd accept your condecending tone.  Otherwise,
go away.

Hi everybody.

If anybody has a used EPS they want to sell, or knows someone who does,
please let me know.  I have a Mac and want to get myself a fairly
economical MIDI setup so I can make more beautiful music than is possible
with just a guitar!

Also mail me if you think my choice of a 1st keyboard/MIDI instrument
is a terribly errant choice.

Lotsa Luv, Jessica Wing

One of the factors for 21- venues that serve alcohol is that they also
serve food.  In fact I think that that may be THE factor.  Berkeley Square,
a full-on bar here in town, is 21- and I think that's how they do it.

I was gone from Thursday to Monday night in Morgan Hill. I had to be in a
wedding. I was sick for a bit, danced to music under 100 bpms, was
subjected to my aunt stressed out (my cousin was getting married), saw a
funny reception skit, saw the old volleyball gang and family, missed the
Gathering, missed the regenade party, thought I lost Jeno (the cat), anf
forgot the food my mom made me. That I did before Thursday, I basically I
hung out with Doug from the east coast and Patrick (plui). Doug made to
his plane today.

Nope, just that I found it rather suspicious that is all.  I know the Capn.
 I just thought that the classification was illogical and useless.  A goon
is a goon is a goon.  Thats all the relevant info we need to know.

I just didn't like the classification John.  Didn't see the need or the
logic.  But I know you and know that your are a great guy with plenty of
enthusiasm for the scene!  As for your other gripes, I still hold by my
word.  I do agree that MORE should be done in venues to make sure that air
circulates, and most importantly REPLENISHED!  But since this is not the
case I do beleive in let the buyer beware.  In any case....

The problem John is that EVERYONE wants to do that.  And until the fire
codes are changed it is difficult for them to make any exceptions.  I DO
wish things were different, but for now they are not.  Clubs are for the
headstrong, sometimes brain stupid, sometimes workout-crazed!  In any case
once again, know the environ and let the buyer beware.  It IS not so
strange that the Sound Factory would have beeter ventialtion.  The King St.
garage is JUST that, a GARAGE (read TRUE HOUSE).  Sound Factory used to be
some type of indorr raquetball court, and  they seemed to have placed a
greater deal on ventilation as well.  If other clubs would follow suit then
EVERYONE would be a bit more comfortable.

I disagree, but what else is new.  If you know about the environ then you

You are misinformed.  YES THEY DO!  And the promoter is RESPONSIBLE for
making sure that security not only operates to keep the interest of the
club in mind, but the interest of the RENTER (read PROMOTER).  So I see it
as a promoters responsibility to talk to security ahead of time.  When we
had our gig at OSB we did talk to security.  They did not do their usual
(shining flashlight on girls asses, harassing people).  FOr OSB they were
LAX.  Yeah I know they didn't let people in with bags, but some did get in.
 It depended on the persons attitude who came to the door.  Plenty had
backpacks, plenty did not.  But they left people the hell alone when they
got there.  Why?  Because we talked to them and told them EXACTLY what we
wanted!  If more promoters did this instead of relegating THEIR
responsibility of providing people a safe, ggod time, then we would have
less complaints about security.  Check it.

You are misinformed.  According to my statistics I am the number one
asshole and irritant on the list.  If anyone has caused a disturbance it is
me.  But I am by no means sorry for stating my opinion(s).  And stand by
every word.  As for security I agree.

I am not going to start this out with "misinformed" :)  In any case I do
understand why you did it I just did not agree and stated why.  The flame

This is NOT a flame format.  I am stating my opinions in the usual
vociferous manner.  There need not be sugar coating on things I STRONGLY
disagree with, and I wont do it.  If you slam a club when I know the
promoter has only the best intentions then I reserve my right to reply in
defense of my friend(s).  If others can state that so and so's suck, then I
should be able to do the same (read opposite).  It seems as though there is
a double standard and if THAT is what is required to get along here then I
will NOT post, or get along.  You have interpreted my actions as negative,
I have intepreted them as constructive.  We just differ in our ways and
means of communicating.  I know I come off strong but that is my manner.  I
am an individual and will remain such.  No need to check it though as you
are well aware of this fact ;)


>I ask that you come to YSH sometime and meet some of us. You'll get

I see that YSH is the latest and greatest of late (esp for SFR's).  In any
case the reaon why I have not attended is that when I was keeping up with
it (and beleive me I was WELL informed of it's presence through the usual
"inside track" channels) I did not care for the DJ lineup. But notice I
never slammed the party.  Just didn't go and stopped following it.  But I
am curious as to what it has evolved into.  I will check it out as soon as
I know the DJ lineup again, and find someone I would like to hear.  I have
heard most of the female Dj's EXCEPT for SHOBAHN.  I am curious about her
style, and am looking forward to hearing her at YSH in the VERY near
future!  Your invitation is accepted, and THANK YOU!


OK (some) SFR's:
Me thinks it's time..."inside track" is a joke.  That's why I say it
because it is the ultimate in pretense.  "If you know the promoter", man
HOW OBVIOUS.  This is another inside track spoof that I use to make a point
that it's pointless to know the promoter in MANY circumstances.  Lighten
up!  Yeah I get pissed, and blow off plenty of steam but I do keep a sense
of humor about everyhting.  Even the things many take WAY to seriously. 
But I will defend my friends if I think they are slammed in ANY forum and
at ANY time, and as far as I am concerned when you attack them for holding
it in a space you cannot attend, or with envrions you hate, but still
attend then I will defend them, mercilessly but with honor!

That is a JOKE.  "ins and outs if you know the promoter" is the biggest
laugh!  Since during the party the promoter is usually busy making sure
that all is well.  S/he usually has little time to escort his/her many
friends in/out of the door.  So usually if there are no in's/out's only the
people actually "working" + the promoter get the privvy.  All others (even
yours truly) has a difficult time.  That is UNLESS I have worked with the
guard before and have at least echanged names with the person.  But at 174,
who gives a shit.  One time I went to my car to get some bud.  I told the
sec guard SABER that I'd be back.  She said "cool".  I tried to get back in
but she had changed posts.  I had to wait for her to get back so that they
would let me in.  In the meanwhile your "true insider" was outside, blocked
by some big overly handsome thug who stood right in front of me (the sucker
was tall, about 6'5"). But I had to wait, and was eventually let back in. 
I stayed in after that!  Even "insiders" get shit treatment at "174".  But
I do LOVE THAT SPACE! (this is no joke I really do!).

Maybe if many of you were not so emotional about my babbling on and just
spent some time thinking about the logic of the various situations that I
mentioned you would find the joke.  But you're soo caught up in being
"righteous" and "musketeerish" that you miss the obvious.  I must say
though that the end of the post where I said "that does it" was no laughing
matter and I stand by every word.  Musketeer or no. No need to check it. 
You have been informed (this is NOT directed at you SDTrap, just thought
I'd throw it in).

Hmmm...I think the warehouse concept is nice.  I have even come to like
(from afar) outdoor parties.  I think both, when done right have their
benefits.  I think outdoors is a bit of a problem though.  MOST "ravers"
leave tons of shit on the site.  It usually takes a coordinated effort to
make sure that people have a place to put their empty bottles, plastic bags
, and nitrous containers so that they leave the "mother" the way she was
before they got there.  I'm all about that.  Anything less is a farce.

Agreed.  I like the fact that some women involved in the scene from WAAAAAY
back, and some newcomers (I hate that stoopid net word newbie) have set out
on their own course!  This scene is male dominated and for now unfocused,
except for a few.  It is always good to see fresh blood, new faces, and
most importantly new ideas spring forth from the community.  Plus some of
the women involved I know personally and they are really great people, and
that does LOTS for the vibe.

No those two go all night.  Most others have license for 21-- (read 18+),
but HAVE to kick you out at 2:30.  Weakness in the SF extreme!

Well the cab laws in screwed but it works SOMETHING like this.  You can
have events 18+ IF you have a WORKING kitchen.  You have a completely
different category of venue and the laws change just as radically.  That's
it in a nutshell.  The place can go all night, and sell beer from opening
till 2 am, the close the booze then, then re-open @ 6am!  OSB does this! 
And BTW King St. is applying for their license so that the back room will
have such facilities so 18+ will be able to attend (if not all ages!).  But
when I talked to the woman in charge (no names here for the letiginous
ones, and as an "insider" she calls me whenever she has a space btw) she
said that she has to make plenty ventialltion and some changes.  The actual
owner, is down with this idea so stay tuned!

You are misinformed.  I not only have clues but actual ANSWERS to your

As for who cares EIM, YOU DO!  It was your caring that made you reply, and
it is your caring that will now transform you into a 4 legged beast of

Not to mention freedom to Check It!  This place is rather repressive, but
repression is the American way.  You, in many ways, are forced into camps
of thought.  And if you don't follow that camp's line you are an outcast, a
rebel, a troublemaker.  The funny thing is Americans have never been up
front about their duality, much less in dealing with it.  But when we do
WATCH OUT!  You're gonna see a nations of 250+ million confused people rise
up mightily, and the battle cry of this Great Republic will be "huh?"

You are misinformed.  I do not know you.  I have not seen you, and by all
accounts never touched you.  But I am curious as to exactly which nerve or
series of nerves I set off?  I think that your problem (now I am acting as
a prophet and "insider" wise man) is no E.  My advice...find a party, enter
it, find a vibe, or a very large BASS bin, and dance.  Oops I forgot, DOSE!

Here is some meteor shower info that I thought might be of interest.  From
what I understand predicting when and if the shower turns into a storm is
pretty uncertain and if it is real strong and hits a little late it would be 
a shame to miss it.

The most intense storms are supposed to "give you a sense of the earth's
motion through the solar system" which I thought was pretty rave related ;)

 SKY & TELESCOPE NEWS BULLETIN -- AUGUST 7, 1993

 Skywatchers around the world are eagerly awaiting the night of August
 11-12, when they might witness one of the best meteor showers of the
 20th century. This week's spectacle will feature the Perseids, which
 occur every year around August 11th or 12th and last for several days.
 The Perseid shower usually produces up to one naked-eye meteor per
 minute if you're at a dark location far from city lights. But this year
 may be different. SKY & TELESCOPE magazine predicts that the shower
 could greatly intensify for an hour or so sometime late on August 11th
 or early on the 12th, to produce a meteor every few seconds. With luck,
 the shower could even turn into a "meteor storm" of several shooting
 stars per second. 

 Here's why: the Perseids are tiny, sand-grain- to pea-sized bits of
 rocky debris that were shed long ago by Comet Swift-Tuttle. Over the
 centuries, the comet's crumbly remains have spread debris all along its
 130-year-long orbit. The Earth plows through this meteor stream every
 August, and they strike our atmosphere at 37 miles per second.
 Astronomers believe the comet is accompanied by a dense ribbon of
 rubble within the larger, well-known stream. Indeed, in 1991 and 1992
 we apparently sliced through its leading portions, because the shower
 briefly got much more active. This year, Earth is most likely to go
 through the dense ribbon of meteoroids during late Wednesday afternoon
 North American time. If so, it will be daylight and we won't see
 anything. But at that time Europe and western Asia will be in darkness
 and facing the oncoming meteors, so expectations for a spectacular
 display are high in those parts of the world. But for all we know, it
 could happen at any time of night. 

 Meteor watching is easy! If the sky is clear, bring a comfortable,
 tilt-back lawn chair to a dark site that has an open view of the
 heavens in any direction. Lie back and give your eyes at least 15
 minutes to adapt to the dark. Faint meteors are tiny, quick streaks.
 Brighter ones may sail across the heavens for several seconds and leave
 a trail of glowing smoke. Don't forget, Perseids appear *anywhere in
 the sky.* But if you trace their direction of flight backward far
 enough across the stars, you cross the shower's radiant in the
 constellation Perseus. The radiant is near the north- northeast horizon
 right after dusk, higher in the northeast by midnight, and nearly
 overhead by the first light of dawn. 

 Some press reports have mistakenly suggested that somehow astronomers
 goofed, and that the Perseids won't be so stunning this year after all.
 It's true that two meteor scientists recently predicted that the Earth
 will plow through the densest stretch of the narrow rubble ribbon in
 1994. But even they admit that this year's storm should be spectacular.
 Much more on the Perseids is in the August issue of SKY & TELESCOPE. 
 

    -------------------------------------------------------

Info from Bob Stachnik at NASA HQ concerning the meteor shower:

   As suggested by the following, the peak year for Perseid meteor storm
activity MAY not be 1993, but 1994. 1993 is still predicted to be a year of
very high activity. It is clear that this still-hypothetical storm is not well
understood. The "storm" is generating an associated storm of predictions.

   Note that next week's predicted heavy meteor activity is due to material
ejected from Swift-Tuttle during its 1862 passage.

Even more Perseids in store for 1994

Astronomers are excitedly anticipating an exceptional display from the
Perseid meteor shower on the night of 11-12 August. But this may not be
the only opportunity to see spectacular Perseids. According to the very
latest calculations by Dr Zidian Wu and Professor Iwan Williams of Queen
Mary and Westfield College in London, the Earth will plough through
the thickest part of the dust cloud giving rise to the Perseids in 1994
rather than 1993.  Their results will be published in the Monthly Notices of
the Royal Astronomical Society later in the year.

A meteor stream in space is created by dust grains ejected from a parent 
comet - in the case of the Perseids, Comet Swift-Tuttle. This comet's most 
recent return to the Earth's vicinity was in 1992. It takes about 130 years to 
orbit the Sun and was last seen in 1862. Dust ejected at the 1862 return will 
still be in a clump near to the comet because it has not had time to spread 
out around the cometary orbit. Since the comet is now relatively close to 
Earth, we are encountering an increasing number of meteors. 

Wu and Williams have computed the actual motion through space of 
hundreds of typical dust particles ejected from Comet Swift-Tuttle at its 
1862 return. They have found that the Earth started to encounter the new 
dust during the mid 1980s. This ties in with increased numbers of meteors 
seen over the last few years, a few hours before the expected peak of the 
shower. But significantly, they predict that the maximum rate will be in 
1994, not 1993.

'This does not mean that you should not go out and look in 1993', Professor
Williams said. 'There will certainly be a spectacular display. But it does mean
that if you miss 1993, there is no need to give up. 1994 should have an even
higher rate'. The only disadvantage in 1994 will be more moonlight because the
Moon's phase will be approaching first quarter.
	With their calculations, Wu and Williams show that the Perseid 
meteoroids would not pass close enough to the Earth to create a meteor 
shower if it were not for the gravitational pull of the planets deflecting 
them from their original paths as they sweep round the Sun in their 
elongated elliptical orbits. For that reason the dust ejected at the 1992 
return will not produce visible meteors until the next return of the
comet in about 130 yearsU time.

The most intense part of the Perseid display is likely to be quite short - 
an hour or less - because the dust cloud responsible is quite compact and 
the Earth will travel through it quickly. Exactly when it will occur is 
difficult to predict but the best guesses are somewhere between  10. 00 p.m. 
on 11 August and 1.30 a.m. on 12 August, Universal Time. (Universal 
Time is equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time. On British Summer Time it 
will be 11.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.). This means that the shower is likely to be 
seen best from western Asia and Europe.

Just a suggestion regarding the intense flaming of recent days...If we are
having really hardcore disagreements or are really pissed off at one
another, let's swap phone numbers and work things out in real time, without
the cloak of the bbs.....It's all about 'listening with the mind, speaking
from the heart, and acting from spirit' communication and sometimes we need
to connect beyond the keyboard (in between partiees where we often times do
interact) to work things out....peace though music and dance  --Mau

That sucks!  When I talked to (I believe) Melissa she said that it would be
a cooperative of sevral promoters for a good cause.  When we first talked I
was doing my party and was concetrating on IT that evening.  All I can say
is promotion, promotion, promotion.  All it needed was that, since all else
was there.  I saw VERY few flyers handed out, and most of the word on the
street had no mention of the party.  I will talk to whoever and see if I
can be more active in the next venture.  Since I live 2 blocks from Haight
and know some of the store owners and some other folks we can get really
strong promotion from SF -> SJ.  I also know a few people in Sac...in any
case I would like to contact whoever about PW and help out (if I can). 
Leave me e-mail with the details. 

The one thing I have noticed from all the hitting parties is that they are
talked about!  There were very few people you would talk to this weekend
that did not mention GK.  That's becuase his promotion is a machine, and
everyone likes what he does.  With a new party the hardest part is getting
everyone's enthusiasm up.  But really all that's required is that the
people promoting, and the people throwing it are hyped to do it, and it
WILL go off!  People catch that fell/vibe and when you're into it they are
into it!   I am sure that it will be better next time...

Ok, So in some way somehow this can be taken as a racial slur.
Fine.
But I , being the semiintelligent, Walking on 2 feet human being did not see this as a racial slur, and I think anyone who has 1/2 a brain could read into it and see that it was not. I certianly didnt see it as a slur, and I think it took more thinking to
make it into one than it owuld have taken to just read it as what it was. 
Also, Its my personal feeling that most people on this list are slightly above using racial slurs anyway. If Im worng, go spank yourself with some wet pasta.

PC Belongs on your desk, not in your mindset.

Im not accusing anyone here at all, but I get a little tired of people who read things looking for the racial slur and making noise aobut it. Im NOT NOT NOT NOT accusing the poster who made the ovservation of doing this, but lets face it, it happens in

What I think we are experiencing here is a bunch of us folks who have
not had a good, blow-the-crud-out-of-the-tubes, over-the-top,
rip-roaring, vibe-to-the-max wing ding in quite some time.

Well, I got news for us.  One's coming along, sooner or later.
In this situation, I counsel patience and enthusiasm in equal measure.
Oh yeah, and here, take this C II tape and these headphones, put 'em
on for a while and call me in the morning :)

% Anyway, just a little note... As for charging for water, and no going out, i'm
% affraid it's universal... Please let the good old days return...

I do my raves (here in Okla City) in clubs for the usual reasons, and
require the owner to provide access to water.  The first time, they sold it
anyway and I didn't find out until the next day.  Now I make 'em put it in
the contract.  If they gripe about cost of cups and the bar tender not
getting paid to fill 'em, I'll offer to buy the cups myself, so long as
people are allowed to take them in the bathroom.  Or hand out free cups at
the smart drink bar.  We also allow no-fee re-entry (we provide security
and control the door, so it's our choice, not the club's).

Can't these things be negotiated in SF?

Yeah.  A friend of mine went in to a local dance music record shop
(which shall remain nameless) and asked to listen to a record.  The
salesman refused, on the grounds that he hated "that techno shit".
When my friend tried to reason with him, saying that he'd buy the
record if it was the one he was looking for, the salesman explained
that they made enough money without him, so they really didn't need
his custom!  Some service industry....  (Fortunately this isn't the
norm...)

I HAVE read the whole thread, and there is a SMILEY after my comments about 
the other flame war.  I find your posts arrogant and obnoxious (YOU might not 
be arrogant and obnoxious by the way, but the way you *express* yourself here 
on sfraves comes across that way to me).  Why do you even THINK you can 
comment on what my grasp of myself is when I certainly have not posted enough

I *think* my last posting (about John Lee not being able to comment on 
what my grasp of myself is) was a reply to private mail that I put on the 
list-at-large.  I always edit TO lines before I send, and I think in this 
case I was reacting so quickly that I didn't verify that it was private
mail before I went to fix up the TO line.  There might be a reason for this 
negligent error of mine, but there is certainly no excuse for it.

So, John, if I had reposted mail that was private from you to me, I apologize 
for that act.

If you want to kick me off of sfraves for this Brian, I'll understand.

Besides having no ethics Laura (That was PRIVATE mail to YOU) you really
need to be informed:
Look, you wanted to cast your two cents.  Now you're caught up in it.  This
whole thing started because a few people decided to bag on a friend of
mines choice of space.  Next we have stupid lawsuits because someone took
it upon himself to go into a place inhospiible to his health.  I replied in
defense of my friends venue and character.  Which in my estimation was
assasinated.  I am done with this stupid tit-for-tat, esp with a few of you
who are overly sensisitive about the most inane things.  When I, note "I",
criticize a "space" (3rd & 24th), I get the wrath of the people on this
list who are personal friends with the people who thre that event.  This
does not bother me, but when many of you invoked my wrath because of the
same thing "I" am the "asshole".  I really could care less what you call me
or what you think about me, since ONLY a very few know me.  So what we have
here is a group of people with a religious bent.  Unknwon rules of conduct
that do not allow for the slightest disagreement/dissent.  Ways of thought
are carefully controlled and monitored to promote this perspective
throughout this list.  Oh yes, gripe about the evil promoter since he's
trying to fuck you.  Oh yes, gripe about the space that has age
prohibitions, because they are ashholes who care only about money.  All
that I have heard on this list is a bunch of whiney self-centered,
duplicitious people who have a definite poltical agenda.  It is no suprise
why people think what they do about SFR's...oh well.  I have managed to
talk to a few of you off-line, and have found you to be GREAT people with a
GREAT sense of humor about everything.  I have met Brian B. and even though
we have had OUR back-and-forth. I do admire his spirit, and willingness to
make a diff.  I have met Bob R. and have found him , in our brief
encounter, to be a nice guy.  I do not need to namedrop sice it serves no
purupose.  But I have found that those I have met are quite nice and good
people.  

I can say only one thing.  Personal attacks will get a reply.  Attack my
friends and I will jump out of the woodwork and defend them with vigor.  So
here is the solution honey, leave me alone and you won't have to deal with
me.  Leave my friends alone and you won't have to deal with me.  Transgress
these rules and incur my wrath, just as I have incurred many of the
people's here on the list.  So you and your buddies can keep your
sophomoric political agenda since it allows for no dissent.  I have no need
or want to deal with people who want only a one way communication of ideas.
 So I am ready to engage in discourse privately with those individuals with
the intellect,integrity, and humor required in any human communication.  So
make your hit list, but be sure that none of my friends are on it.  Bag a
promoter, but make sure he/she is not MY pal.  Do nothing about making
things right and gripe, cry, bitch, complain.  Yawwwn...nothing will change
unless you take it to the next level.  But keep bangin those hardheads
aainst that brick wall and you will eventually stop  since it feels good to
do so.

I am done, can we move on.  This has become inane, stupid, boring, and
childish.  Poke me with a fork, I'm done.

I would be very curious to know what the name of the politcal party is here
on the list?  Can I vote for it in the next election?  I already know the
agenda and am curious as to whether it will be on the next ballot?  Somehow
I doubt it since to do that requires action, not words.

Are we finished yet?  I know I am ;)

Make a difference, make a change.  Be apart of it or step back...

John

P.S.  SInce it is clear I will defend myself I am done for now with the
personal tit-for-tat.  Save it so that we may all save bandwidth.  You know
how damn wordy I am so why, why, WHY in god's name reply?  Talk about
masochism ;)

Please, please.... if someone says something that offends you, respond

concise and civil.  I know it's hard, and i've been guilty in the past
of carrying on discussions on the list that should have been taken

And please don't reply to this message on the list.... it isn't worth

Aplogy accepted and I aplogogize for the act of calling you "unethical". 
As for banishment from the list I do beleive that at this stage I have
many, many, MANY more points than you!  So you'll have to wait your turn to
be kicked off ;)  For some strange reason me thinks they will no longer
tolerate my dissent from the current poltical line.  But there is plenty of
room here (my future loc) in the thought gulag! ;)

Late...& peace

re me waiting in line beind you to get kicked off sfraves:
Oh I don't know . . . if you add in my negative karma points from 
ne-raves I'll catch up to you soon enough.

And as for expressing your "raveolitically-incorrect" views, you 
should keep expressing them even if it does piss everyone off.  
The "be happy or die" thing about ravers is even more annoying than 
the most obnoxious of posts you could ever cook up.  It's up to you 
how "in-yer-face" you're going to be about it all, it might even be 
your desire to incite near-violence, I don't know you well enough yet 
to determine that.

Yeah, I like Mission Rock a whole lot, too.  I wasn't there last week, but
I've been there just about every week before that.  Sometimes the music
isn't quite as good as it could be, but for the most part the people are
friendly and we have a good time anyway.  The only problem I have with the
place is that when they close the bar and all the drunks file out and try to
interact.  It's kind of sad to watch.

would you mind passing that along?

and what do you think is the political agenda of the list,
you mentioned that it was obvious several times,
but i think for the most part i've missed it,
maybe im just too wrapped up in it to notice

and it sounds like a good idea to mean to start a political party...
anyone know how many sigs it takes to get a spot on a ballot?

John, 
I sincerely hope you are joking. If not your cocky attitude has got 
to go.  This scene is all about being happy and friendly and non 
judgemental..  
You are right you do not know me, and if your attitude it truly as you post, I would not want to meet you.  No I do not need to dose or do drugs to be in a positive state of mind.  I don't think I have any 
problem that you need to figure  out.  I do not post that 
much either, but when someone starts going off, it does set off a 
nerve.  Again if you had read my message carefully, I did not say 
anything against the information you were trying to put across, I 
did not like the way you came across with that information.<Check 
it>? what kind of cocky remark is that. It is getting really old 
let me tell you that.,  
However I should not let my feathers get too ruffled because maybe you were just playing devil's advocate.  I know you have inflamed enough people on the net as it is.  I however just don't see your attitude meshing with the vibe, so to speak.   

That is all I will post about this issue, now lets move on to something 
more positive, PLEASE!!!

And I guess you'll defend your friends if they are wrong too. But then
again I can fully expect that kind of "my country right or wrong" attitude
from a proud citizen of the new roman empire (your words, not mine).

> You know if others played by your

Actually, I'd like to think it was closer to Ralph Nader. Meanwhile, as far
as I can tell, you're just a little George Bush -- defending your greedy
buddies-in-business regardless of whether it's right or wrong.  Just
another scum-sucking plutocrat.

> As
> for the money, they ARE entitled to it IF you lay it in their palm.

And I'm entitled to a refund if the place is not up to standards of
lowest-common-denominator decency. And if they don't give it, I see no
reason why not to threaten with a lawsuit (as in John Draper's case), or
threaten to call the cops, fire dept, state-board-of-health (for the
smega-pit bathroom) or whatnot, or just bitch about it to all and sundry.
If they're assholes, I have no problem being an asshole right back. They
show me respect, then I'll give them respect. It's that simple.

Here's a short list of events where positive respect has been given in the
past: Groove Kitchen (only when not at 174 King St), The Gathering, Unity,
Come/Unity, Let Freedom Rave, Full Moon Massive, Together, Deep Faith, Your
Sister's House, Mother Earth Sound System, Connection, etc.

> You are misinformed.  The boycott will not be effective as new ranks will

Effective to whom? Will it prevent a group of people from being abused by a
greedy promoter and a bad venue? If we watch out for each other and inform
each other of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the scene, then that's all
the effectiveness I need.

Will a boycott change anything? Well, lets say 5 people call me on Saturday
night to ask what's happening that evening. I tell them to avoid XXXXXX
since it would be a crowded gangster-laden attitude-hellhole (because of
the location, not because of the promoter).  So maybe 5 less people show
up. I&Others spread the word on the list and maybe 20 people won't show up,
and those twenty people will pass the word on to their 5 friends... Suddenly,
the promoter is getting something like 100 less people.  That's $1500 which
is somewhat significant. 

> rather you
> shoudltry to change things by at least talking to them and airing your
> greivances.  That's what the promoters meeting should've been all about. 

I'm not a promoter, my voice would not be heard nor heeded as I'm not
running on that glorious inside track that you've taken. Besides, I'm just
a consumer, not a promoter, so I have better things to do with my time.

Lets say that I'm an amateur restaurant reviewer. I go to a restaurant, I
get a bad meal, I slag the restaurant in my review. That's the way things
go. I don't go into the kitchen and show the cook how to cook, nor show the
waiter how to waiter. By the fact that I've paid them my hard earned money,
I expect them to do the job right. Otherwise, I would have stayed home and
cooked for myself.

In other words, I have a right to an opinion. Just as you have a right
to yours. The media in which our opinions are carried is democratic
enough that people can decide for themselves whether an opinion has merit.
Shouting matches and ad-hominem attacks are unecessary...

Spoken like the true plutocrat that you are. Stop it with your insulting
"let em eat cake" attitude -- most of us aren't that chummy with the
promoters to be able to trade anything other than greenbacks. I don't even
know why you're trying to waste my time with such a pathetically weak
argument to defend whatever system is being used by the rave scene. The non-
underground rave scene is basically the same as the SF Club scene, and it
is run by greed and greed alone.  I will fight against that and slander
promoters/venues that are acting greedy by not providing the customer with
appropriate value for their money.

And while you're defending your buddies in power, you throw in a couple of
personal insults for good measure. Such persuasive force of argument!

Yeah, but if enough of us stay home, the party will be relegated to the
gangster-types that have discovered raves (and 174 King St.). They can run
around scamming on underwear-girlz and pick fights all they want as long as
we're nowhere near.  Meanwhile we'll be off doing something better and more
interesting.

> He loses a griper who has done nothing to make a diff.  Oh well

Put up and shut up, right? You're sounding more and more like George Bush
(or is that Rush Limbaugh) every second. And what causes a rave
attendee to "make a difference?" -- sheepishly putting up with any
of the bullshit that gets thrown our way for our $15.00 entry fee? 
Being so whacked out on X that you can't judge whether you've been had?

If you're the standard by which I'm supposed to be clueful, then I'm very
happy to be clueless, thank you very much.

I went to progress last night and walked in 
while my friend was spinning(julius papp).
This place is pretty cool for being a club!
You walk in and there was a little room with
a movie projector with some strange stuff going
on. Then you walk thru that and there is the
main room witch is pretty big it had stairs
leading somewhere but it was blocked off. There
was the bar then the dance floor. The dj was
elevated in a half circle enclosure towards the back
of the main room over looking the danceing area and
bar. There was to slide projections on two big walls
and good lighting efx! The sound system was pretty
kicking but what do I know! The music was better than
any Deep Space encounter at Oasis!!! As you walk thru the
main room there was a little area behind the slide projections
with a couch right behind the screen and an elevated couch thing
with tall little round tables so's you can sit and sip! I like
this place just for the fact that it has places to sit ;).
There were only maybe 40 people there, but I left early do to
tiredness. By the way this place was 100% well ventilated! Not
alot of smoke to bother you people who get bothered easily. Plus
they have pitchers of water there with cups no charge. You get in
free from 9 to 10p.m.. Definitely something to support here in 
San Jose! I think I saw Vivian but I was not sure do to lights
going on and off, but if that was you HELLO!!!  ;)
Sorry about the spelling errors, nobodys perfect!

Greetings!
After spending the last two hours sifting thru 275 + posts with more
arriving during my reading time. I feel like we may have lost something
here. What is the purpose of this list? Is it for these ongoing flame wars?
When I read these posts from all of you out there. I am touched by what
you people say. All of this negativity is a sheer downer, which is the
exact opposite of what I want. I want to be uplifted and get high off what
you have to say!!! There is no reason for violence to come between us...
   
     We here are not all wanting to be Captain Kirk's just waiting for the
chance to say. "FIRE!!!!"

So take a step back from your computer and think to yourself... 
Do I really want to go out and hurt other peoples feelings???

I know from all of these flames my feelings have been scorched.
Live Long and Prosper... (couldn't help it 8^)

I wish everyone would stop arguing with JSL.  Not because I agree with him,
I don't, but because he always has to have the last word and I must have
received 20 messages from him today.

You are misinformed.  I sent 18 defensive messages today.  Check it.
Is that right John?  Looking forward to your correction.

Hey, anybody out there have news about Elizabet(h)?

Is the new soul among us yet?

Also- as per SJ; things are looking up, up up down here!
I guess people in SJ finally got tired of being in their cars.
(I know I did.)People who used to commute, now throw things locally. 

To add to the SJ list- there's a small party called Revolutionary
every other Wednesday at Upstairs Records.  not tonight- next week.
I don't have a # (don't try the record store, I'm not sure they know
about it). I think it's either $3 or $5 and gets going pretty late
(after 12? 1? 2?). I don't know if it's all ages or not, either.

Give it a go-

Jocelyn

p.s. no more THE LIST posts; if you have more to say on that topic, (I know
I do, HONEY :) here's what I recommend: send the post to which you want to 
reply to yourself- do this at least twice. Then write your response and 
send it to yourself. Then read all of the posts at one sitting (there 
should beat least three now.) Then delete all of the posts 
and move on... -> up! or just think of something else to post to the list:
take the above posting as an example :)

Review #35 Contents:
Bjork: Debut
System 7: Sinbad/Quest
Ultramarine: Kingdom
TC 1993: Harmony
Fierce Ruling Diva: Get Funky With Me
Ace The Space: 1 Gun - 2 Gun - 3 Gun - Roar!
Amorphous Androgynous: Tales of Ephidrina


Bjork: Debut
Elektra: 961468-2
1  109  04:11 Human Behavior
2  116  04:52 Crying
3   68  04:43 Venus As A Boy
4  124  03:21 There's More To Life Than This
5       04:34 Like Someone In Love
6  119  03:57 Big Time Sensuality
7  105  05:24 One Day
8  105  03:55 Aeroplane
9   87  04:55 Come To Me
10 120  04:59 Violently Happy
11      03:33 The Anchor Song

Comments: Bjork, otherwise known as the lead vocal for The Sugarcubes brings
out a quirky, dancy, fun solo album.  With strong backing production from
Nellee Hooper, this release has some serious thumpers with a few returns to
the 'cubes sound.  "Human Behavior" is the first single of the album.  It uses
these fab sounding kettle drums to give sort of a 60's "Walking Boots" air
about it.  "There's More To Life Than This" is produced to sound like it is
being done in a club, with Bjork singing to you at the table, then in the
bathrooms.  The backing is clubby, but the front is a definite message to the
club kids.  "Big Time Sensuality" is also on the housey side, but then we are
treated to an Orbalistic endeavor with a moving bass and gurgling baby
sounds.  Tracks like "Aeroplane" and "The Anchor Song" return to what we know
as the mixed pallette that Bjork normally sings.

Summary: 7/10.  Bjork's voice is fabulous and works well with a dancey track,
but her experimental ventures are a bit hard to swallow with casual listening.


System 7: Sinbad/Quest
Weird and Unconventional/Big Life: BFLD 8
1  130  03:51 Sinbad (Bandit Edit)
2  125  08:32 Quest (Moody Boys Interpretation)
3  130  05:53 Sinbad (7th Voyage of Sinbad)
4  125  06:44 Quest (Moon Mix)

Comments: "Sinbad" is my favorite track from the System 7 "777" album, and
this single is much nicer than the previous single, "7:7 Expansion".  The only
notable mix of "Sinbad" is the second "7th Voyage of Sinbad" which expands it
into a lighter, yet deeper version with analog overtures and watery samples,
but still retains the driving drum line.  "Quest" is a delicious new track
that glistens like bright moonlight itself.  The first "Moody Boys
Interpretation" is interesting, but not as stunning as the "Moon Mix" which is
really the best song on this single.

Summary: 9/10.  Nice remix of "Sinbad", but the real stunner is the final
version of "Quest".  System 7 is producing better ambient house than anyone
right now.


Ultramarine: Kingdom
Blanco Y Negro: NEG65CD
1  110  04:54 Kingdom
2  124  07:27 Goldcrest
3  110  07:15 Kingdom (Extended Mix)

Comments: A highly awaited new single from the distinct Ultramarine.  This
time with a medieval tinge that lifts its lyrics from an 1848 folk song.  The
pan flute fits into Ultramarine's light sound and gives "Kingdom", of all
things, a sort of Jethro Tull feel.  "Goldcrest" is an instrumental with weird
vocal samples stirred in.  The entire single uses the trademark Ultramarine
analog dive instrument, but is a definite progression for the band.

Summary: 7/10.  Good feel to "Kingdom" and a nice extension as well as a
decent bonus track.  However, it leaves me a little empty.  I'm sure the new
album will more than satisfy.


TC 1993: Harmony
VC Records/Union Recordings: UCRCD20
1  130  09:06 The Big Bump Symphony
2  130  04:55 The F.P.I Funky Mix
3  130  08:36 The Martian Mix
4  130  04:15 The Train Mix
5  130  08:19 The Blue Bullet Dub
6  130  04:18 The Harmony Mix

Comments: There are very few house releases that I groove on anymore, but TC
can always be counted on.  True to form, "Harmony" grooves hard with multiple
well-done remixes.  Although I didn't like it as much as "Funky Guitar" and
"Berry", this does make for some great dancing.  The remixes are all of a wide
variety, and aside from the final "Harmony Mix" stick well to the original
theme.  I just wish TC would put out more than one release a year.

Summary: 8/10.  If you like house, you'll love this.  If you don't but have an
affection for funky rhythms, check it out as well.


Fierce Ruling Diva: Get Funky With Me
The Medicine Label: 9 40828-2
1  133  03:47 Get Funky With Me (Get Funky Radio Mix)
2  130  05:31 Get Funky With Me (You Better Take This)
3  140  04:49 Get Funky With Me (House Music)
4  130  05:28 Get Funky With Me (Love Your Enemies)
5  165  05:09 Get Funky With Me (How Funky Eurotrash 165 BPM)
6  125  04:47 Get Funky With Me (Love Your Enemies Sound Factory Garage Mix)
7  135  05:05 Get Funky With Me (Gimme Your Body Seriously Club-Minded Mix)
8  140  07:11 Get Funky With Me (You Better Take This Synthetic Voodoo Mix)

Comments:  I originally received this on white label a few months back and I
really only liked the "Love Your Enemies" mix enough to play it.  Since then,
they've added a few new mixes that are fairly decent, but I still like both of
the "Love Your Enemies" mixes better than anything else.  The "Eurotrash"
remix is hard and fast, and is somewhat of a joke.  Juan Atkins contributed
the "Synthetic Voodoo Mix" and it is quite boring.  The original "Radio Mix"
is just that, FRD slathered up in radio form, bleagh, too bad.  The remaining
mixes, "You Better Take This", "House Music", and "Gimme Your Body" are a cut
above average, but not too far above average.

Summary: 5/10.  Peppy single for FRD, but by no means as good as their
previous releases.  Medicine is a subsidiary of Elektra, could this be FRD for
the unwashed masses?


Ace The Space: 1 Gun - 2 Gun - 3 Gun - Roar!
Dance Pool/Sony: DAN 659526 2
1  140  03:39 1 Gun - 2 Gun - 3 Gun - Roar!
2  144  03:54 Go Voodoo!
3  109  04:21 Your Special Attraction

Comments: I picked this up because of the Dance Ecstacy 2001 production, and
the fact that they mention Frankfurt Trax 4 on the label.  I haven't received
FFT4 yet, but I'm anxiously awaiting it, so I thought this would tide me
over.  Wrong.  The worst kind of hardcore, chipmunk techno with the Hoover
vacuum running in overdrive.  The sad part is, the use of a military march
chant is a good idea, it was just executed poorly.  "Go Voodoo!" is the same,
but this time Alvin raps.  "Your Special Attraction" holds a bit of merit in a
hip-hoppy Altern8 form, but really isn't worth the cost of this import.

Summary: 2/10.  I wish I could have found a Lenny Dee EP instead.


Amorphous Androgynous: Tales of Ephidrina
Astralwerks/Caroline: ASW 6101 0777 7 88238 2 7
1  129  07:22 Liquid Insects
2  121  04:17 Swab
3  115  04:39 Mountain Goat
4  120  05:38 In Mind
5  146  08:17 Ephidrena
6  140  07:20 Auto Pimp
7  116  04:04 Fat Cat
8  113  05:28 Pod Room

Comments: In the process of creating a new Future Sound of London record,
Dougans and Cockbain found that they had so much material that they decided to
put out this album under the "Amorphous Androgynous" name.  What is amazing
about this fact is that if this is the "leftovers" the next FSoL album will be
ungodly.  "Tales of Ephidrina" is damn fine music, not just for the pounding
danceability of "Swab" or the beauty of "Mountain Goat" but for the FSoL
innovation and originality is in strong form here.  Only one track sags, "Pod
Room", which begins to sound like a power-plant gone awry with its repeated
buzz line.  It eventually makes good with a sweeping orchestral sparkling
closure.  Astralwerks is a new division of Caroline and this is their first
release.  The production is stellar and far beyond the original Jumpin' and
Pumpin' mush.  Astralwerks has a bright future if they keep it up with this
quality.

Summary: 9/10.  Once again, D&C twist our ears, minds, and souls with
fantastic music of another form.  $14 for this music, a nicely printed booklet
with cool art, and clean production is a bargain beyond reason.

Hello All, 
 
   I talked to Elizabeth on Monday and she actually had a lot of energy. She is hoping to go any day now.  I visited her last week and she was looking good. 
She has promised to call me as soon as she has the baby and gets back to 
normal, so to speak.  I am sure she would love to receive a call from 
other sfravers. Also she is going to be getting her modem installed 
pretty soon, so you can send her email. 
as soon as I hear any new news, I will pass it along.

I am sure that most everyone on sfraves is pretty distraught at the tone
of the postings for the last few days.  I'm not going to point any fingers
lest I gotta point one at myself, but let's just say that we're in a
spiraling loop of overheated rhetoric, ego and Serious Attitude.

There's really no need for it, as 10 seconds of serious consideration
shows. 

We've got a great group of people here and plenty of room for discussion
and even vociferous disagreement while maintaining respect.  How else
do we learn unless we're exposed to each other's views and experiences
which of necessity differ from our own?

I don't want to be didactic about this.  Online discussion is a fragile
environment and we've gotta promote the vibe here just as at any gathering.

Peace and respect aren't just slogans.  They mean *serious attention* to
one's relationships with others.  It's not about winning, it's about living.

We don't have to overlook our disagreements.  But what Carlos said to me
several weeks ago stands as a crucial point: "You've got to be *positive*!"
(You can just see him standing there with his arms outstretched making this
statement :)

I don't like the feeling of being preachy so I'm gonna cut this now.
It's up to each of us to steer a positive course.  

Peace out  . . .

Well, Progress down here in San Jose is a good weekly event with the usual
San Jose kickin' DJs:  Julius, Harry Who, and Rick Preston.  The San Jose
scene really has some great DJs (don't forget Spun) for a town that won't
let dancing go on after 2am.  There aren't as many choices as in SF, but 
the community here is tighter, I feel.  It is great to see the same faces
everywhere.

So check out:

Mondays - every other monday is Free Life at FX
Tuesdays -  every tuesday is Progress at Oz in the pavillion
Wednesdays - somethhing abovr  a record store (?)
Thursdays - every thurs. is Deep Space with Spun, Rick Preston, Harry, guests
Fridays -  FX again.

See ya there.

Subject: SFRaves social agenda
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


If there is a sociopolitical or philosophical culture on SFRaves it is
certainly unintentioned.  We are a pretty diverse bunch, but any group
of people will have some basic things in common, and repeated interactions
within the group will usually reinforce such things, resulting in a 
*somewhat* common outlook.  What follows are *my* subjective observations 
of what we seem to have in common on SFRaves which someone might percieve 
as contributing toward a sociopolitical "agenda" of sorts.  I do not at 
all suggest that anyone *should* adhere to any of it.  For that matter,
since I don't personally know most of the people on SFRaves, take this
as an overgeneralized guess about our shared backgrounds. 

1. Raving: The act of raving causes us to focus on music, dance,
a group vibe, altered states of consciousness, shared sensory
stimulation, and certain kinds of technology among other things.  
Many of these things typically take us out of our selves, i.e. we 
experience AND VALUE the loss of our egos to some extent.  Of course 
we still have egos, but most of us know how to transcend them for 
the sake of fostering a Oneness amongst us.  Many of us have learned
that what any one of us has to say is not necessarily more important
or *right* than some other point of view.  The world is an imperfect 
place, so often we tend to let things we disike slide and focus on what
brings us together, like music, dance, love, humor, etc.  

2. Living in the SF BAy Area: The history of SF (i.e. the psychedelic
60's) and the cultural diversity here has affected most of us who live 
here.  The large gay population here is especially important becuase it 
underscores an openmindedness toward alternative lifestyles.  From this 
comes the idea of mutual respect and the realization that it's OK to be 
different, unless what makes someone different is their intolerance toward 
others.  The Bay Area also tends to lean politically toward the left and 
seems to be more environmentally conscious than other parts of the country.

3. Network Access: People with experience being online understand that
this mode of communication requires a certain amount of etiquette in
order to work.  A lot can be lost in a mishmosh of hurried words.
Bandwidth is a shared and limited resource and rules are difficult
to create  and enforce without restricting everyone's freedom to 
express themselves, so there is a certain amount of care and self-policing 
that we tend to expect from each other.  On the net, mutual respect is
often measured by how well the basic elements of net etiquette are followed, 
but at the same time, we value the freedom of the anarchic spirit here, 
and so the inevitable occasional digressions and "abuses" are quickly
forgiven.

Just would like to respond to John's post, hopefully this flaming
will settle down.

1) I don't think I ever said that you weren't entitled to you opinions,
   but rather that you should state them as such instead of acting as
   if they're the absolute truth.  Most people, I would gather, don't
   agree with your ideas about 21+ vs. under-21, nor are they quite so
   bothered about going to raves with mostly hets in them.

2) At various points in your message to me you implied (perhaps
   unintentionally) that I was racist and narrow-minded.  When I first
   wrote my post, I had a feeling you might take offense to some of
   the things I wrote, because they were the sort of things that I
   *know* from personal experience will trip some people's PC sensors.
   I was in fact merely trying to point out that ragging on white
   people is just as bad as ragging on black people, or ragging on
   any such class of people, Serbs and hillbillies included.

3) Many people perceive your attitude as "aggro" whether or not you
   intend it this way, so keep this in mind when you post.  I don't
   think anyone has any desire to censor you or prevent you from
   saying what you want, but some people (I in particular!) would
   prefer that you say it in a slightly nicer way.

Let's get past this, please ...

Oops sometimes things are a matter of timing. Laura, I wasn't
referring to you in my "please don't post my email" message. I was
referring to JSL, who had taken a personal email of mine (the one that
says come to YSH and meet us) and reposted it to this list without
asking me.

Nothing but smooches for you :).

I'll be in SF Friday night with a friend from out of town. I was wondering
if, bu some act of hospitality, anyone has some room on the floor for the

We might not need it, but I'd like to have a contingency if the plans we've
made fall through.

We're housetrained and everything, too! Can't beat that, eh?

If you find yourself in the Walnut Creek area on Thursday nights,
check out a weekly that's been going for a while now.  Eclipse
(weak name) is a mixed club at 2520 Camino Diablo in W.C.  Look for
the Diablo Magazine sign.  Music and DJ's are decent (a few weeks ago
Carlos was there).  Open til 4, 18+, minimal redneck presence so
far.

Subject: Accentuate the POSITIVE ;)
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

After all this discussion my mind was set ablaze with your 
many comments and ideas (oh yes, there were PLENTY amongst 
the flames of thought).

It is obvious that there must be a change.  All of us are 
tired of the same old club(s), and the same BS that goes 
along with it.  Tired of the disingenuine promoter who 
promises the world but delivers a grain of sand.  So with 
this in mind I began to think of how, as a collective, we as 
a group can make a change for the better.  Dig this:

1.  Start a local rag (magazine) that documents the many 
aspects of the scene.
    Don't just dismiss this as another URB (which is based 
in LA and has not a clue about what is happening here).  A 
mag that is small, free and objective/subjective can do alot 
to stimulate thought, discourse, and action.  It can also 
serve as a very powerful communications medium that helps 
people locate, and dive into the UG we create.  It should 
cover ALL aspects of the scene, from the gay/lesbian vibe to 
the present house culture.  It should act as a catalyst to 
bring the MANY houses together in unity to accomplish the 
one thing we all want to do, enjoy life (read killa party).  
This can also help new people (DJ's) get broken into the 
scene, creating more variety for the community.  It can also 
help to prop up the resurgence of UG's here in SF!  It can 
also act as a means to discover new talent in the area 
(musicians/DJ's making music/video/high tech [ala Synergy & 
Nitty Gritty]), as well as new movements that are related to 
house.  It can be funded by adverts from the local shops who 
have benefited greatly from our common house culture.

2. Support the local UG's and promote it's growth!  You want 
to send a message to promoters, club owners etc. Then 
support venues and locations that are not the conventional!  
Support the DJ's who spin at these places.  And more 
importantly GET INVOLVED!  Either by word of mouth promotion 
of such events, or doing one yourself!
There are sooo many things that have not been tried.  Why 
not a "New Moon" party.  Why not something really chill 
during Perseid tonight with just some chill ambient music 
while watching the "shooting stars", then later shutting it 
off for nature's perfect sound system.  How about a boat 
party on a Friday...man, so many possibilites for those who 
want to make a difference!  For those who want to make a 
change!

3.  I have harped about diversity and there are ways of 
accomplishing this.  Allowing different types of music to 
play at different times.  And the themes of such parties 
would change.  Why not some soul, garage, tribal, funk.  Why 
not some acid jazz, break beat, acid.  Why not some...you 
get the idea.  Mix it up, and you'll get a variety of 
people.  Keep shit the same and things stay the same.  
Different DJ's and not just the conventional lineup is great 
too (this is what we have done with Vortex and it works 
great).  Which brings me to my next subject...new talent.

4.  There is plenty of talent here in the bay area.  Lots of 
DJ's, and lots of people with ideas.  Everyone should have a 
chance if it adds to the overall vibe.  New DJ's have it the 
toughest since they are caught in a catch 22.  I say this, 
if you can match beats, and are into it, then you should be 
given a break.  This could occur at UG's where people are 
more open to new talent, and new talent has a chance to do 
what it needs to do to become better, PLAYING IN FRONT OF A 
LIVE AUDIENCE.  Not everything has to be UG, but if you're 
gonna be all inclusive regardless of age then this is one of 
the few possibilities.

5.  With all of this there should be several goals in the 
movement.  I have plenty of ideas as to what they should be 
but I have been told about my bandwidth so I'll only present 
one.  I think that the IDEA of a promoter making $$$ is not 
a bad idea, I think it is more how they do it.  I think the 
goal should be $10 parties if massive, and less if they 
occur during the week.  No party should be over $10, unless 
it is a special event (where I would think that $15 is 
adequate).   By forcing the price down all production costs 
go down.  DJ prices drop, equip. prices drop, and the venue 
price drops.   This is attainable and worthwhile.

6.  Get ACTIVE.  There is little that can be done without 
massive action.  If you are dissatisfied with the current 
laws then there is the power of the vote that can be wielded 
with great strength.  There are more 18-30 year olds in the 
city than other populations.  Therefore the politicians will 
take notice if you have first registered SF ravers, and have 
them sign a petition.  This double whammy will attract  not 
only the attention of the politicians (who YOU NEED in order 
to change current legislation), but of the media.  It would 
be nice to have a discussion on KQED about the scene, what 
it's about and the implications of the scene on society.  It 
could also bring to light the hypocrisy of current laws, 
thus facilitating the changes we all want to see.


Well that's just about it.  There is alot more that can be 
done, and I have provided at least some ideas for action.  I 
have already begun a few of the steps myself, and am moving 
forward with like minded individuals I have met a parties 
and here on the list  There are some things that I am not 
interested in pursuing at this time since my time is quite 
limited (although I find PLENTY of time to reply to the 
voluminous ruminations that occur here on the list ;) ) so I 
direct my energy where it will have the greatest 
impact/result (read I am doing 2-5!).  We each have a golden 
opportunity.  It is now up to the individual to either make 
an impact OR stand on the sidelines.  Active participation 
or do nothing.  The choice is always yours.


From the prophet on high, or rather
from the prophet who is high,
John

It is not important.

It has become obvious that any discussion must lie within certain
parameters.  I will not comply, so instead of being frustrated by this
religious and political bent, it is best for me to observe, and
laugh...nuff said.

At this stage I would mind.  Since there is so much duplicity and hyperbole
from people who have yet to do shit, any criticism without firm and proper
action is IMO useless.  The masturbation session is over, and I am tired of
seeing a bunch of circle jerks (you my friend are not one of them...peace).
 Nuff said.

Simply put.  SFRaves.  Love it or die.  Death is my preference.  I hate
stagnation and bitching. Nuff said.

>
>and what do you think is the political agenda of the list,

Ben Wing was supposed to make that very point clear to me, but I guess he's
formulating it now ;)  In any case it is obvious.  And beleive it or not,
the non-vociferous SFRavers that I have talked to know it to be true as
well.  So I am not alone.  Like all things this place has it's politics and
it's clique, and it's line.  All quite nice actually, if you like to remain
inactive.  I have chosen not to be.  Therefore since I do not fit the
required mold, either in speech, or in thought I have decided that instead
of participating fully it would be best to watch the circus, as MANY on
this list spend cash at shitty parties, bag on spaces/promoters/whatever,
and air their collective wamsuttas.  It is best sometimes to observe, and
this will be my course of action.  Nuff said.

>dana

No need.  Others have started it for you.  And the votes are counted in
bitch cycles, whine cycles, and most of all inaction.  Nuff said.

Nuff Said.

Well I have decided to use up a bit more bandwidth here.  I will keep it as
brief as possible. So if you can bear with me for a moment.

I was told a day ago that I should "ignore those people" and "you know how
they are", but I didn't and was glad to accpet the consequences of not
doing so. 

The reason...I saw someone post the umpteenth message about ripoff
promoter, and boycotting this or that.

Before that I posted a message about the "insiders guide" which offended
many even though a discliamer of humor was posted at the end, old news.

Before that it was 21+, 21--.  Whatever they were they were not BORING
discussions (this was not what I wanted, I wanted discourse, dialogue, and
action but that has YET to materialize).

I have been called out becuase of the "way" I say things, and "how" I come
off. My attitude needs constant adjusting, and I've been told "I'm not with
the 'vibe'".  Very few address the content since they have such a hard time
in the manner in which it is presented.  This I cannot help.

Throught all of this I have kept my sense of humor, and have tried to let
each of you know that even though I am a "promoter" (another inane
self-bestowed title) I like to bandy it about as well with people who, I
was told, are a group of fun beings with great ideas.  Well I am a bit
disappointed, but aren't we all.

And throughout all of this I have tried, in my own "annoying" and
"obnoxious" way to get you all invovled so that your many ideas could make
a difference in a scene that is in a serious state of transition.  Into
what?  Who knows, even I as a prophet can't tell that.  But all that seems
to have been said is "lawsuit", and "club hit-lists" all under the guise of
making things better for the, uh, "consumer" (which is YOU, the people who
make/break this scene).  Nope not one time has anyone said, "hey let's take
this to the promoters, to the DJ's, let's have a small public forum, let's
take it to the next level".  And the excuses have ranged from "all we are
are partiers, they won't listen" to "fuck the rules, fuck this, and fuck
that, fuck THEM".  I thought it was about UNITY.  I thought it was about
change.  Well those things come when you work very hard to ensure that the
idea is transformed from thought to action.  When it remains within this
realm of ether it becomes electronic-mastubatory fodder whose purpose is
wasted in the hand of internet mailers.  In each post I have always added a
bit of "yuck, yuck" humor.  I assumed that you all at one stage or another
were involved with the throwing of C2 or other parties that mostly SFR's go
to (I know you all attend many events, but c2 is most prominent in my mind
as a SFR event), and therefore got these tepid attempts at humor.  I
miscalculated.  In any event the one thing I have always stressed, when I
was not bagging like we all do at times, was that we all should take an
ACTIVE part in making this scene work. Become active an create the changes
you want to see.  Hit-lists, and bagging on this-and-that without action is
IMO useless.  And it takes so little effort to change things...at first. 
The larger part of which is organization, and getting things going, along
with changing peoples perception.  It can happen, all it needs is you and
your ideas!

Hey, I know I pissed many of you off, but you pissed me off.  Things
happen...it's part of humanity. The real diff is once we realize that, can
we move on?  And can we GROW from the experience?  This is the true test of
Homo Nova.

I have tried earnestly to get some action going with a few of you.  Getting
a petition for 18+ all nighters, but was BAGGED on becuase it did not
include 18--.  Starting UG's like Late Train (btw there will be one next
Monday, check Pepper at DDD on haight.  It's called "Late-Train - The
Caboose is Loose!", and are the funniest parties you can ever attend (if
you can.  They start around 1-3 and are very chaotic, that is until the
music starts :)> ), and doing your own thang (but as usual was bagged
becuase I would not give details since that would be premature). In any
case we are both (SFR collective sans a few) guilty of jumping the gun and
being (I gotta say it!) misinformed (ahhhhhh :), about each other (talk
about virtual).  In any case I hoped that some of you would take action to
change things, but I guess some things cannot be rushed or changed.

In any case I have decided (whilst driving on 280 s going to work in SJ
from SF eeech, and overlooking the scenery with hawks, buzzards, and
greenery) to stop posting anything here on SFR.  The reason, we just can't
seem to communicate.  We talk AT each other, and as a result get the worse
that each has to offer.  I do not like the "rave till grave" philosphy, or
"peace, love, & harmony" (sounds like the Return of the Archons [orig Start
Trek]) since there is very little peace, and very little harmony in our
world.  I also do not beleive in it wholly becuase this scene IMO (over the
past 2-3 years) has become so homogenoues that it, for me, has lost alot of
the magic and lustre it once had.  I do not see SFR promoting diversity or
change.  And I see the willingness of others to do little more than
complain (which IS their right!) about something they can HELP (man, it's
like seeing suffering, and saying "fuckin' homeless", "fuckin' this/that",
"bad neighborhood" without reaching out to help.  This is sick and banal.
Most of all NOT HUMAN!).  In a scene that depends upon the energy of others
putting in as well as giving back, this list to me at times seemed one
sided.  But as I said when we talk AT each other alot of nuances are lost. 
In any case I have been asked by many to leave (not by BB mind you). And I
see no need to be in a place that does not want me, or in a place where I
cannot make a difference in the positive. I am also tired of explaining
every word I say to people who are totally literate.  I do think that there
is a line of thought that runs through the list that I do not care for or
care to be a part of.  Hell, unity is great if we can unite in diversity of
culture/mind/deed, this does not seem to be the case here.

So with that I do hope that at some point many of you with very fine points
present your case to the promoters (they NEED it, esp now)/dj's/venues so
that the changes you want are enacted.  I do hope that change occurs and at
some time we may talk TO each other when we are ready (man, it's like SFR
is a being...I guess it is in a way huh?  comrpised of many parts...not
bad), and by that time we can work together to change the things we BOTH
dislike.  Until that time I'll just watch what happens on the list.  And
like the village I will subscribe to "A still toungue makes a happy life"
philosphy. My happiness begins now.

Peace.
John

P.S.  The things you think about when you drive!  BCNU :)

One other thing.  I do follow my own words.  I am hooking up with a couple
of people I've met here and making some nice and overdue changes...anything
is possible, even amongst newly made friends!

i'm planning a get-together in GG Park in about a week or so, of not more
than 20 people approx, but ive heard that there is a very limited number
of people that can have a picnic/party (w/ music of course) without a permit 
(something ridiculous like 5), so essentially my question is where & how 
do i go about obtaining this permit, if indeed i need one?


[please reply to this by private e-mail to vampyre@uclink.berkeley.edu since
this is not all that directly rave-related - and enough bandwidth has been 
wasted recently as it is...though i acknowledge that i'm just as guilty for
this post 8-)...]

thanx,
jo

Simon always blows me away.  He's one of the few consistent Djs I have
come across.  He seems to do well in regular weeklies; Together, AfterLife,
and now Fridge.  I enjoyed Jeno's set despite the reviews I've heard off-
line.  As for Thomas... I thouroughly enjoyed that night and feel bad for
those who trekked to Groove Kitchen.  I used to really dig that event;  Oh
well, the scene changes and different actors come and go;  me, I go.

John S. Lee and everybody else, too:

I just came back from the most spirtually-charged               
dance-concert that I have participated in in a long                  
time--and it was a no-booze 16+ crowd at the Catalyst
in Sanity Cruise.  And suddenly I knew why I was on
sfraves and in sfraves with you-all.  I knew what
John S. Lee and Geoff White and Brian B. and all of
us are abot--for one together tight timeless moment,
crunched in space into the craziest little blue and
red and black box I could ever imagine.  And I thought
yes, imagine...that's what we're all about here,
Warriors and Magicians and LoversandKvetchers...it
may be fucken hard but it's the only thing we have.

And thenI knew why I was going to YSH this Thursday
night and why I'm glad I've never unsubscribed and why             
even with all our misunderstandings and disunderstandings
and I-hate-you-yes-I-understand-yous...why we're still
such a long way from wha we can imagine together!  What
I hate and fear and anger most about is all inside me just
as much as what I love and welcome and am most 
vulnerable about!  It's not me vs. you.  That game is
over.  It's not us vs. them.  That way leads only to death.

Thank you, John Draper and John S. Lee you are me and I
am thee.  Let's see what we can be!

World's second most out there raver,
Will

I tuned in to Viacom's Channel 51 at 6:00pm and was treated to
a 1/2 hr of really nice ambient visuals & music (mostly if not
all Eno).  The style of the patterns was very fluid; lava lamp
video overlayed with flowing digital landscapes, some fractal
images and some nice geometric kaleidoscope type patterns that
pulsated and were continuously treated with vivid washes of color.  
Very psychedelic and stimulating, yet totally soothing.  Great stuff; 
I taped the whole show for my own psychedelic library.

I only have 2 very minor nitpicks:  1. There were some occasional
sudden discontinuities in the color changes rather than the gradual
changes that characterized most of the 1/2 hour.  2. The music had
silence between songs where I would have preferred some overlap
in the mix.

Great Job Tony!  But then, I've always liked Synergy's stuff.

For what it's worth, i found jslee's signal ratio very high during the

perceived attitude that they threw the baby out with the bathwater,
missing some very perceptive insights into the scene.  and people forgot
that he was reacting not to someone's opinions, but threats of lawsuits
(frivilous, and ridiculous from someone who should know better....
peace and love, my ass) and boycotts.

but as far as what one reads or deletes, Internet might do well to adopt
a standard WELL caveat.  YMMV...your mileage may vary, everyone's
interpretation will likely be different.  YMMV.

At least there's a scene in which to experience growth pains.

best,
alpha-10

The problem is that the promoters of PW didn't really want that much 
publicity.  I didn't think that they wanted that many people there.  
At least not everyone of your GK, Basics, etc etc raver.  Not that there 
is anything wrong with them, but  a basic harmony with nature was 
trying to be achieved. They just didn't want anyone to drop there 
trash everywhere and not respect their Mother.  I agree there needed 
to be more people there, but I don't think leaving flyers everywhere 
would achieve the ultimate goal of these particular promoters. 
Not to put you down or anything John, because I know you have all 
good intentions in mind. However I think a more careful way of promoting 
this party would be better.  

This is my opinion and only my opinion.  I hope in my short paragraph 
I have not offended anyone. If so please tell me nicely I don't want 
to be flamed. :-0

Fetish

Universal Groove
Tbursdays

I used to go to Tilt-A-Whirl, and Fetish is promoted by the same guy, so it
should kick ass. I dunno anything about UG, but the flyer is cool.

I believe Mona (of YSH and Aurgasm) is doing just that.  Her first

Also, Sara and Kelly, from NRSHA:  (<- umlaut fell off the side), the
bay area's, um, premeire all woman hardcore breakbeat techno band
(don't ask), have a zine.  It's not very good (like NRSHA:), but at
least they are trying.

Geoff, I believe, has something in the works, and Pat Dote had one a
while back.

I just remembered that Brian was working on some kind of publication;
I may have got my wires crossed (sorry Geoff).

Also, Sara and Kelly may be better (musically) by now;  What I heard
was a tape Gunther had from last year.  And their 'zine is a lot
better now than the first one.  (Still kinda thin in the info area,
but better).  

They go to the promoters mettings, some of the regulars there are sure
to have seen their 'zines.

Didn't want to sound like I was slamming them;  they have a lot of
motivation.

  As I have stated before, it wasn't the information you were conveying, it was the way it was being put forth.  And I do apologize for saying I would never want to meet you, that was mean of me. However as I said you did ruffle my feathers.  I do agree that everyone has gone overboard on this whole thing.  It is a good thing that everyone has differing opinions, but when we are just 
sitting around yelling at eachother nothing gets accomplished right?  
I think we should be working together not against eachother.  We 
are a more  mellow group as a whole. I have read the flames on other 
newsgroups and they are all downright rude.  I applaud everyone for 
the majority for not getting completely out of hand, and resorting 
to petty name calling.  I hope we will be able to get over this.

well for you to say you will be silent is going to the other extreme.  
You can state your opinions fairly but everyone should remember this 
is a free forum of expression. You don't need to be mean and put 
down others just to get your point across.

I am done with this idea as well.

Hmmm...I don't have a lot of events for this weekend.  I don't really
have a solid handle on how LoveStock will be; it sounds like it'll be
in a cool location, but the crowd could be cool or could be more in
the Cyberfest direction.  I think if you go with friends, you can have
a good time.  Origin might be fun too - seems to be put on by the
Foundation people, for what that's worth...

Otherwise, you're left with the weeklies, but that's not so bad, since
there now seems to be at least a couple good choices every night (!) :)

How do you all feel about digital audio and computers?

The reason I ask this is that I write programs that deal with digital audio
and MIDI and I want to write a program that would basically give the DJ the
same capabilities that you currently have with turntables and a mixer plus
the ability to add other things to the mix like live percussion, lighting
control, digital video control and all the other cool things you can do with
computers that are near impossible with out them.

What I'd like to know is this:  if such a system existed, would you consider
using it?  And if so, what features would you like to see in the program.
Also, if you think this idea sucks I'd like to know why.

This is not a marketing survey. This is just an idea I've been toying with
for a while.

I'm a musician who likes to use new and unusual performance techniques and
listening to a good DJ is everybit as rewarding as listening to a more
traditional performance.

Thanks for the help

A funny thing happened to me this morning.  I was being driven to the
train station so I could go to work at about 7:30 a.m. and I saw a bunch
of ravers standing outside some space down near there!  It is so funny...
I am so used to coming out of raves in the morning, feeling superior
to all the fools driving by who got up that early to commute to slavery,
and now for once I was on the other side!  I don't know what event it
was, but for a Wednesday night event to last all the way through to
the morning is pretty good...

I work in audio/video/telecomm integration (multimedia/vr/audiotex/videotex),
so i use it all the time... You should post this to bpm, the internet DJ's
list... (bpm-request@andrew.cmu.edu to sub), it is probably more appropriate
there than here.

A few radio stations use the Roland DJ-?? sampler. Personally i use 2 Gravis
Ultrasound and a Roland controller. I see it as a complement to a dual CD
player (or turntables for most djs), but i can make megamix easily with that,
live and without touching a mixer or turntable or cd (once i have all my samples
ready). I have not toyed with SMPTE time code for video control, nor used a
MIDI light controller, but these are all off the shelf components...

> What I'd like to know is this:  if such a system existed, would you consider

Well, i dont see the difference from what i'm using (or could buy at the local
musician shop...)

  And if so, what features would you like to see in the program.
> Also, if you think this idea sucks I'd like to know why.

I dont think it's a bad idea, but maybe you could explain a bit... all that is
needed is already available... unless i misunderstood you!

If you want to impress a lot of people, use a powerglove and "fake" scratching
with it and a sampler... pretty cool... I'm now working on the windows part,
because i want to integrate this with all the cool tools in windows (rave,
patch controller etc...).

I'll take one of these! Might even help work on it if the software is
free and it is written for a suitably open platform (e.g. unix).

I've been wanting to do this kind of stuff for a long time, and it now
seems like I might have the chance.

I will be getting an SGI Indy in the near future and will be working on
"multimedia" group-work (or play) environments on that platform. (Niels
finally decides to get deunemployed...). I would be glad to share
whatever bits of non-proprietary code I develop in return for the same
from you all.

For "play" I'm definitely going to need digital video/audio editing
that go beyond the basic stuff provided with the system... The sorts of
things that might be fun to experiment with, include the following
audio wet dreams: 

* applying functions to the colormap (of video or graphics) based on
the real-time spectrum of the incoming audio signals... Yer digimaniac
update of the 70's-something-been-hanging-out-at-radio-shack-too-much-
light-organ.

* beat-match assistant -- plots a crude map which helps visualize the
rhythmic structure of a pre-recorded digitized sample of music (as a 3D
surface with x,y a function of spectral analysis, z time). "Beat
matching" could occur by placing the visualization of the rhythmic
structures "on" top of each other, with 3D cues helping people align
the structures.

--------------------

Aside from that, you can also get a variety of mac or PC-based
hard-disk recording systems that may help do some of the digital
audio/video editing.

Has anybody heard about Digidesign's Session 8 -- it's an 8 channel
direct-to-disk, recording, mixing, DSP, and random access editing, with
a supposedly "full" (whatever that means) MIDI implementation. $3995.00
list (plus your PC w/ Windows 3.1), includes SCSI controller....

How good are the "low end" audio hardware and software for the PC?
(e.g. Microsoft's Windows Sound System, Sound Blaster 16ASP, Media 
Vision Pro Audio Spectrum 16). Any recommended random access editing
systems for such a platform?

I recently got comps to Lovestock (i'm such an insider!) but a bunch of
things have come up this weekend which may make full attendance impossible.

So I'm wondering if anybody involved or knowledgeable could share the
DJ schedule and also the Concert Schedule. I'd like to check Brown
Fellinis, 10 Bass T, Inka Inka and Dub Tribe. (don't know about the
others, recs on any of the other bands?).

First a little about me and what I do.  Technically, I'm a programmer with
OSC.  We make Deck.  For those not familiar with us, Deck is the original
(and still the best :) 4 track digital audio workstation on the Mac.  I
write user interfaces among other things.  I'm also a musician interested in
alternative performance mediums including audience participation.

What I envision in this program is an open ended environment for controlling
and manipulating sound and other stuff (video, lights, coffee makers, etc).
The question is not whether it can be done, cause it can.  The question is,
what would it look like?  Since a lot of techno is basically sound that's
been looped, I've taken this as my starting point.  I envision an interface
that lets the user put together looped material in real time.  What medium
the sound is on is beside the point, though the first incarnation will most
likely be something that resembles the program Upbeat but will include
machine control and digital audio.  The technical side of all this has
already been written.  We have an audio engine that's more than capable to
do the task.

I want this program to be more than just a mixing and playback of someone
else's music (which is the current method of the DJ), but to be a full
performance environment with all the bells and whistles (including power
glove support).

You all sound interested, so I'm actually going to try to throw something
together that I can share.  What I need to know is what essential user
interface elements need to be in the program to make it useful and
productive.

I've been toying with idea to create a mixxing juke box. The user would pick
the song they'd like to hear and the MJB would process the BPM of the song
picked (song header file) versus the song playing and mix them based upon a 
mixxing algorythm (what a great name for the thing). Does anyone have any ideas 
for the algothrthm to mix two digital signals. Let me know.

I've been thinking bout Digital mixing for a while,  and yes!!  I think
it's possible to do it.  I discussed this with Amit last evening,  who
is a digital music and audio programmer,   and the idea intregues
me greatly.

While at YSH last night,  ai discussed it with a few other psople
and while dancing,   I think I came up with an algorithm for
doing it,   but it depends on sonstant "boom boom" to exist,
but that can be used to lock a time base.

Programmically,  it's certainly possible.

Cheers

If anyone wants to discuss this with me,  feel free,  and I'll be
going to the LoveStock this weekend,  so look for me there..

seems like a good way to do it is generate a sound-envelope function
(which should make the "boom boom" pretty prominent) and use a phase
locked loop to adjust the source speed to match up a source of known
BPM. PLL's tend to require a pretty clean signal, but one can "damp"
the output of the phase comparator s.t. it won't come out of lock as
easily. The downside to that being that it may take a long time to
acquire lock.... (Furthermore, PLL's make it easy to perform frequency
multiplication, perhaps useful for chipmunk breakbeat fans.)

However, don't most DJ's "beat match" off the high-hats? What happens
if the "boom boom" is actually BASS? In jazzy/funky domains, BASS tends
to SWING, which makes algorithmic beat matching difficult.

I personally still like the 3D visualization approach I mentioned in my
previous post better. For one, it will allow you do do interesting
things like putting the beat exactly 180 degrees out of phase for
interesting effect. It also provides easier correlation between how a
song sounds and the visualized "sound structures" which one aligns
using graphics ops.

Whatever happenned to the digital opcode outputs that were gonna be
used on CD players?  I know a few CDs were released with some primitive
graphics synced to the music that took advantage of this, although
some kind of an adapter was needed.  Anyway, If MIDI timecode could
be recorded with CDs and transmitted this way, CDs could be synced
with sequencers, SMPTE (video), lights, theatre props, etc. without
much in the way of of new software/hardware development.  Leaves
vinyl out of the picture, though.

Has anybody heard about Digidesign's Session 8 -- it's an 8 channel
direct-to-disk, recording, mixing, DSP, and random access editing, with
a supposedly "full" (whatever that means) MIDI implementation. $3995.00
list (plus your PC w/ Windows 3.1), includes SCSI controller....

How good are the "low end" audio hardware and software for the PC?
(e.g. Microsoft's Windows Sound System, Sound Blaster 16ASP, Media
Vision Pro Audio Spectrum 16). Any recommended random access editing
systems for such a platform?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ya, I've heard of it.  And dreamt of finding $3995.00 and buying it.

The "low end" stuff isn't really digital audio, per se.  I have the Sound
Blaster 16ASP and it's real fun to play with but there's not much you
can do with it in terms of making or contributing to music.  It has good
sound for games, it let's you spice up your environment by assigning sound
effects to system calls (porky pig saying bdi bdi bdi that's all folks when
I shut down windows), and currently I'm having lots of fun with the recorder
and editor by tweaking and looping samples, etc. until I get a "real"
sampler that I can control via midi.  It's good practice though, and I can
start planning and arranging music until I get a midi controler, sequencer,
and a sampler (I already have a keyboard and a couple of drum machines).

Oh, by the way.  There is a new direct-to-disk recorder/midi interface (I
think) that is about to or just came out.  It only has 2 channels digital
audio but it's only around $600.00.  It's called the TAP 10 and Roland
makes it.  Check it. ;-)

WWWhhhhhhhhheeeeeewwwwwwwwwuuuuuugggggghhhhhhhh.........


I dunno how to spell it, but I think that's right. Anyway, it's supposed to
be a long, audible sigh of contentment, satisfaction, happiness in general,
and muscles that will definitely hurt later.

I couldn't believe it. I had the best time of my life. I know I said that
LAST week as well, but it WAS the best time.

The DJs were GREAT! I couldn't believe that every song spoke to me, call me
back from the boring, cold chill area and back into the
carbohydrate-sapping heat of the dance floor. Usually, there's at least one
set or so that I can't dance to, music that I don't particularly like...
Nope, not here.

I ran into a shitload of people again. Heya, Monikat, Susie, Louis, Amit.
(Special thanx to Susie for un-tensing Sean.) As before, met new ones
(*waves*) like Ben and Howard.

I missed Oz and that pissed me off. I looked around a bit, but I s'pose it
was doomed from the beginning. A guy in a green shirt... Hmm, that
certainly narrows it right down. *smirk*

heheheheh

A few of my friends were teasing me a bit about my conduct with a potted
plant. At the very beginning of the party, around ten or so, I was feeling
very nice and not altogether normal, which is fine. I started rubbing up
against the plant like a cat, just rubbing my face against the leaves and
touching the pot and stuff. I looked up and said to a friend "I can't
believe I'm standing here with my head in a plant." It seems a few people
noticed and remarked. Odd.

Anyway, what I said last week about YSH is ditto for this week. Kickass
location, lotsa room, and the same old YSH stuff, which is fine.

It occured to me last night (at a rave) why Christians are so against rave
and dance in general, despite it's blatant and frequent use as an adjunct
to worship: What is there that Heaven could offer in the future that isn't
here right now (at a rave)? All the temptations of Hell and glories of
Heaven could be nothing compared to the experience of Rave.

Me too...  I've been thinking about an interface box for the Denon
(cause I don't want to design out a whole CD player too), that basically
serves as a database and alternate UI to the player.  For each CD/track
you will be able to store BPM, and break and cue points.  It's a pain
to find cue points on the Denon.  This device would let you store
your favorite cue points so when you want to mix in, it's all a matter of
finiding the cue point you want from the database (or by hand if you
want) and then auto-adjust the pitch of the incoming based on the
BPM of the incoming and outgoing CDs.  Fine tuning, etc. would still
be done by hand on the existing Denon UI.  For outgoing CDs the
interface could be used to locate an out-break, then setup a countdown timer 
that lets you know when the break is coming up so you can cue the
incoming source, either automatically (if it's a CD) or just as a reference.
Of course, in the deluxe model, the database would actually store
the actual audio of breaks so that you can preview whole mixes in
the phones while stuff is playing.  Eventually it would be nice if you
could store at least a set's worth of songs on a hard drive and forget
crating records and CDs along altogether.  The DJ would just come
with his hard drive.

Since it's too much of a pain to determine the beats from analyzing
the signal, why not just tap in the beat like you would on a computer
BPM counter?  There would be a beat tap-in feature on my interface
as well.  You would use it to BPM your CDs for the database, and you
could use it on-the-fly to BPM CDs that aren't in your database, 
or to BPM records that are playing so you can mix them out with the
auto-mix feature.

Since all these features are decidedly unmacho, they would only be
a supplement to the existing Denon (or whoever) UI for doing mixing
by hand, of course!  It seems like a basic version of the interface
I describe could be done today.  There's plenty more gee-whiz stuff
that can be added in the future.

Denon politely said "forget it" when i asked them for the specs of the mini din
interface a few months back...

Tell me then why you would even need a DJ? A lot of remote stations that cant
afford staff are fully automated... you just need 1 person to do the playlists,
and the rest is full auto... Now if you do the same thing for beat on beat,
then all you need is somebody to program a playlist. Heck why even bother? You
can just buy mixed tapes! ... Seriously, it is a consideration...

There is a german CD player with pitch that shows the bpm and can adjust the
second bpm to match. Then all you need to do is press play at approx the good
time (it is synced to the bpm clock). But if you want to do a good bpm
counter not just based on the volume, then you gotta use ffts (fast fourier
transforms), and for that you will surely need a DSP. You can get several cards
with DSP like the Turtle Beach Multisound (the SB16ASP cannot do ffts so it's
of no use) that you could program (it's a 56001 like in the NeXT and SGI).
There have been a few papers written on that subject... check at your cs
library... BTW, on a 486 you could do a few points fft, but the processing left
would be limited to just indicating the values, nothing else...

Check out in a DJ mag from about a year ago, they talk about the german cd
player... no database for cuepoints, but aided beat matching.

 In my opinion , one working definition of heaven is " A place where I
will feel better than I could possibly feel in my mortal life " 
[ That's just one of many ideas of a heaven ] . So , if the most intense
experience you have on earth is raves , then heaven will be like the
best ever rave you've been to , except much more so. Since you won't have
a mortal body anymore , this is possible without being physically or
psychicly fatal. You will truly be in "... thee infinite beat".

	  flyers would look like? :-)

caliban@soda.berkeley.edu sez:
        as far as looped techno goes, i have always envisioned
        a huge board covered with switches that turn the loops
        on and off... a board that people in the crowd could
        take turns switching.  truly interactice!  the switches
        would control the loops, or track numbers (in the case
        of master trax and other such sequencing software...)

yup that's right along the lines i was thinking.  At our last CD release
party (for Poke in the Ear II) we wired all sorts of triggering mechanisms
(piezo elements, motion detectors, light detectors, etc) to trigger all
sorts of stuff (sound, video, lights, etc).  This is I concept I'm going to
keep in the program.  So the DJ becomes more of a tour guide through the
mindscape...

I've been toying with idea to create a mixxing juke box. The user would pick

picked (song header file) versus the song playing and mix them based upon a
mixxing algorythm (what a great name for the thing). Does anyone have any
ideas
for the algothrthm to mix two digital signals. Let me know.

The DSP engineer at OSC, who also wrote the EPS operating system among other
things, has a real time time compression algorithm  that sounds absolutely
incredible.  His code is currently owned by Dyaxis, but it is based on a
publicly available algorithm (I'm not sure where it's published, but I'll
ask if anyone cares).  It would of course be an integral part of my program.

Hmmmm. This frightens me a little bit.  One of the best qualities of a
good DJ is his/her ability to feel a crowd and work off their collective
energy.  I love watching a DJ start to mix in a song, think of something
better, go scrambling through the crate, slap it on just in the nick of
time-- the crowd roars-- energy surge.  I'd hate to go to a pre-programmed
rave.  Just my $0.02.

well john, I've already have at my disposal perhaps the best digital audio
mixing engine on the mac, as well as a real time time compression algorithm
that sounds incredible.  You're absolutely right about it being possible.
the only concern I have is how much equipment (DSPs, scsi accelerators,
memory) I'm going to have to purloin to do it.

lxfogel@srv.pacbell.com sez:

Whatever happenned to the digital opcode outputs that were gonna be
used on CD players?  I know a few CDs were released with some primitive
graphics synced to the music that took advantage of this, although
some kind of an adapter was needed.  Anyway, If MIDI timecode could
be recorded with CDs and transmitted this way, CDs could be synced
with sequencers, SMPTE (video), lights, theatre props, etc. without
much in the way of of new software/hardware development.  Leaves
vinyl out of the picture, though.

syncing CDs is even easier than you thing.  Just use a CD-ROM drive that
supports direct cueing from the computer (just about all of them can do
that).  This is the basis of one of Macromedias presentation programs.  I
think it's Action! but I'm not sure

I've got a friend going down to LA this weekend.  Any reccomendations?
He would also really like to know the name(s) of any visual companies that
are specifically working with computers/video.  Any info would be great.

BTW, synergy will be in Seattle on Saturday night-- still don't
know the name of the party, but I will find out.  Anyone up there who is
interested drop me a note and maybe we can meet at the show, etc...

Thanks,


Tony

Boy there was lots of energy there last night! What a vibe!

I was feeling pretty crappy though. Really bad day at work. Software
broken everywhere. Got yelled at on the phone for turning in a report
late. Drank milk earlier that day (stupid), so I got to feel my guts
churning in pain all night.

People worked so hard to make me feel better. God, Susie, if your
essence could be bottled, kings would fight for it. Thank you so much.

Well I hope soon I can give back all that positive energy.

Oh yeah! The Penelope's Web pictures are in. If you haven't seen them
yet, seek me out. There are some really neat pictures in there :).
Everybody that's seen pictures of the site is frothing to go spend a
weekend there. It is... as beautiful as Bob and Vivian said it was :),
but check out the pictures...

Till next time. Love!

Sean

I posted this on alt.rave last week, sorry I forgot about sfraves until it was
too late, but anyway.  This is tomorrow.  With the remnants of the meteor
shower, the new moon, and the perfect skies we have right now it should be
just as spectacular as Solstice was.  I sent out flyers to our mailing list
and there is quite a bit of excitement going around about it now.  Anyway, on
with the show:

Yeah.... I took a 24 track tape of theirs into the studio last week
and worked with it. I liked what I heard....before and after :)

LoveCrock/Festervahl somewhere near Modesto.  I'd consider checking
it out for a day if I had any idea how much $ it would cost me.

    I don't see this as something that would replace the DJ, more as
    something that would allow the DJ to push the envelope still further.
    They could control more sounds at once, or handle more complicated
    rhythms.  It could and should permit more improvisation, not less.

Hi,

I'll be in Calif between 8/17 and 8/31--a batch of time near San  
Francisco and a batch of time in the LA area.  I would appreciate  
your suggestions for cool record stores, clubs, any hotlines and a  
copy of the rave-o-matic that covers these dates.  I have places to  
stay in LA, Davis-Sacto area, but none in the City.  If anyone has  
crash space available in the City following a rave or a late club  
night, I'd appreciate it and would do the same for you in the Boston  
area.

Yes, I know its short notice, but its been a dog of a few weeks in  
this lab...and the next thing I know its a few days before....

Oh yeah while I'm playing with bandwidth...Hi to all the UCD Ravers;  
I'm an Aggie from way back.  Are there any interesting things going  
on in the Davis area these days.  While I was on sf-raves, I noticed  
a few UCD addresses  :)  Hi to Susie !partyon.  We met at Yellow!

Thanks alot!!!,

hey all,

 while this is not necessarily pertinent to the primary subject matter of
sfraves & funky-music,  there are enough people of conscience on both lists
 that I thought I'd pass this on.  Take a minute, if you will and reflect
 on what has passed and perhaps what we can do to change things... my
 sincere apologies to those who want to hear about nothing but music; I'm
 sympathetic, but sometimes it's good to take a wider perspective.

------------------------


Friday August 13, 1993 marks the 23rd anniversary of the bloody
Watts riots.  It's still about RACE, not about crime, not about 
Hate.  Mor jails, more police and the criminalization of poverty
is a formula for domestic chaos and heighten Race/Class polarization.  
Cut the bull Bill and Janet; get tough on urban neglect.

sent to me via socal-raves, even though it had sfraves in the address...(i.e
it may have been addressed to BOTH lists, socal being the one that got it to

Just got back from this one...It was pleanty o' neeto...I had the greatest time
Carlos is a GOD! He was as charming and creative on the table and one of the
friendliest people I have ever met...coolness...
Alonzo was also way up there in Deity stature...this the second (or third?)
event where he was in control of my physical and mental states...
The people were very cool...I saw almost no alcohol there, and everyone was
totally all-smiles...
But, gee...I really can't think....I am going on my 26 waking hour...I think 
that some rest would be very good for me now...so, g' night ya'll, and perhaps
I'll see you tonight...
Merry Xmas

Just got back from a Friday night on the campgronds outside Madesto, its
beautiful a huge space with big river in the backyard so to speak. Saw
Alphie. Jeno, John Williams spin terrific sets on a crispy clean sound
system to 50 people tops. It was like haveing them spinning just fer you
way good fun. But there's not many people  (saw Amit) so mabey they'll
drp the price. the site is worth the drive for sure.

Glad to hear this went off.  I was at the map point (which strangely enough
was in the parking lot of Denny's in Santa Cruz) for about an hour between
12:30 and 1:30 and they had yet to find a site.  Apparently the original 
site was private property and had not been properly cleared with the land
owner.  The backup site (somewhere on the beach just north of Davenport --
possibly Greyhound Rock?) got busted as they were setting up.  (So much for
"100% Bust Free" :)

Seemed like a good group of people and more then the promoters really 
expected.  They also had a dozen or so cases of free bottled water :)
Where and when did it finally go off?

this announcement is from the Summer 1993 MAPS Newsletter (see below for info  
about MAPS).  please feel free to redistribute - especially to anyone you  
know who might be willing to participate in this MDMA research in Los  
Angeles.  beyond the value of the scientific information the study will  
yield, there is another reason to volunteer:  having ample numbers of willing  
subjects will be a needed sign to other researchers and funding organizations  
(the "Powers") that psychedelic explorers are interested enough in the  
scientific truth about psychedelics to support research in this area. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
              "Normal" Volunteers Needed for MDMA Research

         No spinal taps but, sadly, no MDMA either.  Subjects who
           volunteer for this study will be given preference to
          participate in subsequent studies in which MDMA may be
                              administered.

   Investigators at Harbor Hospital-UCLA Medical Center are interested in  
studying subjects with a history of past use of MDMA and/or LSD for possible  
evidence of MDMA neurotoxicity.  This study is a very important investigation  
of the possible risks of MDMA.  Data from this study will provide important  
evidence to compare to data from studies also being undertaken at Harbor  
Hospital-UCLA Medical Center in which small amounts of MDMA will be given to  
six medical professionals.

  This study is formally known as a "challenge test."  Subjects will be  
administered either the drug fenfluramine or placebo in a randomized  
double-blind procedure and their blood will be sampled for evidence of the  
functioning of their neuro-hormone system, principally serotonin.   
Psychiatric interviews will also be conducted.

   The challenge test takes between four to six hours and requires that  
subjects have a small needle inserted into an arm vein for about 4 hours.   
Small amounts of blood will be drawn intermittently throughout the challenge  
test.  Subjects will need to participate in two tests, separated by about two  
to four weeks.  Subjects must abstain from all drug use during the interim  
period.  Subjects may volunteer to participate on weekends or weekdays,  
whichever is more convenient.

   Three groups of volunteers are required with each group to consist of  
20-30 subjects.

   Group 1... people who have used MDMA at least 3-4 times.
   Group 2... people who have used LSD, but not MDMA.
   Group 3... people who have virtually no history of non-medical drug use
              other than alcohol or tobacco or caffeine.

   Anyone interested in possible participation in this research investigation  
of the long-term effects of MDMA should call Carla at (310) 222-1663.

   Volunteering for this study as an excellent way to help MDMA research.

After much preparation (H) Mike and I headed off for this event with high
hopes.  We had been to the site before when we had gone to the most recent
Sharon, and had loved the place.  We got there at around 1:30, and asked the
guy at the entry gate how many people there were inside.  "About 600."

There were 40-50 people, tops.

So what did we do, now that we had paid the 30 bucks EACH to get in?  We 
walked around a little, checked out the stars, made friends in a circle of
trees, set up our tent, chilled a little.  We then realized that the 
evening would be lame, so we went to sleep in the hopes that maybe more
people would sho up by the time we awoke.

After trying to sleep with house music playing quite loud nearby, we awoke to
find FEWER cars arounf than before.  We were very pissed.  The promoters 
looked bummed.  As we were getting up, we heard some familiar sounding music,
sounded like Rick Preston, so we went over to check it out.  There was Rcik
finishing up his set at 9:30am.  Said hi, he looked tired, he wasn't 
EVEN gonna get paid with such a low turnout, so we bought him a mocha for
the ride home.  He's gonna be at ORIGIN tonight, and he is incredibly good,
so go check him out if you can.

We couldn't really bear the thought of hanging out in the heat, listening 
to 12 hours more music before tonight, so we cut our losses and left dor
home.  I don't expect that that many people will show up tonight, so
be wary if you plan to attend.  It's not as thoug we didn't have a good
time, but I wish we hadn't spent that much money to do it.

Maybe we will see some of y'all at Origin tonight.  Take care, everyone.

Does anyone out there know anything about Universe other than the date?  
The phone number mentioned in the calendar does not go through... The 
reason I am so anxious is that I am considering a drive down to SF for it 
and I would like to know the lineup so I can decide whether to go to 
Universe or wait until Midi Circus comes... ps.  This is a rather large 
decision for me as I am pretty poor and a good 3 days drive away from SF 
(Spokane, Washington.)  Any info of either Universe or Midi Circus would 
be appreciated.

Has anyone ever considered putting together a CD of techno by people on 
the Net?  I have seen that there are quite a few musicians hanging around 
here and vrave, and many of us have been exchanging tapes for a while... 
I have only been on sfraves for 2-3 months, so I don't know if this has 
been discussed into the ground already.  But if it hasn't, what do you 
think of this idea?  How would we get the money together to press it?  
Where would it be available?  Is it even worth it?

There is a project being put together on the Analogue Heaven list
(analog-request@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu).  I don't think it will end up
being a CD, but it will feature music created by net people.  Is anybody
here on sfraves contributing?

 I thought Taylor808 was putting out a cd of people on the net as well??
I remember him asking for DAT copies of people's music awhile back ago.

Report from LoveStock...

I'm back from a continious raving weekend,   danced from Friday evening
all the way until they shut off the sound system at around 10:30 on Sunday
Morning,   no sleep since then.   Late Sat evening,   I get reports that
some dickwad farmer called the pigs and forced the sound system down
Drats!!  I really wanted to hear Carlos with the sound
system intact....  I did meet and talk with him...   Great dude...

 (I treid to sleep during the quiet time,  but stayed awake to look at the
metior showers.    which was greatly enhanced by the electrical brain
enhancements).    At around 7 am,   the sound system went on again,
and I slowly made my way to the dance area for one final fling.

>It was like haveing them spinning just fer you
>way good fun. But there's not many people  (saw Amit) so mabey they'll
>drp the price. the site is worth the drive for sure.

Yea!!   It was totally bare,  few people showed up Friday evening,  but
having a DJ all to myself was also GREAT!!   Most of the time,  I was the
ONLY dude out there dancing.   WOW!! What gives??   Everyone wimp out Fri
nite?    (probably went to another rave I bet!).

The area was totally awsome.   It was right by the Stanaslaus (Scuse spelling)
river.    They had some lights mounted on the bank of the river,   shining
out over the low hanging fog.    It was the eeriest thing I ever saw,  and
definately enhanced my visual input.

All in All,  dipite the very small group of people that showed up,    it was
the best rave I've been to all summer (Squeaked by Penelape's web a scosh).

We just Gotta have more of these big all weekend long events.    Well,  at
least I can use one per weekend.  :-)  No tobacco smoke problems,  faschist
bouncers,   and plenty of chill out opportunities.   Hats off for Johnny Vegas
for putting this on.

Rave on dudz...

Cheers

Now all we gotta do is figure out a way to have them without the promoters
going broke!  I'm a little disappointed in the turn out for these things,
it seems like people WANT to go to smokey, gritty warehouses al the time,
with mean bouncers and over zealous police sargents.

Hey everyone.      

  Well it has been almost a week since i finished my pilgrimage to
the promise land. upon touching the holy soil of the sacred land
i realized at that moment what i had been searching for was
now there in front of my eyes. It was indeed San Francisco.

  I got the chance to check out the sf scene thanks to a free
ticket and the prodding of raving buddy susie kameny. 
  i was skeptical, but in the end sf surpassed all expectations.
  the first night was the FMR  which still blows my mind that
1500+ people by word of mouth found out about the event and made
it to the location. And after it was busted it was moved to the
berkeley marina where it continued till 5pm!!

  but the fmr was just a taste. On Thursday night was the club
Your Sisters House. some people dis the discussion before-hand,
but the talk about sex and drugs actually was educative and
fascinating for me; and it let you know a little bit more about
the people you were dancing with and who they are rather then just
any person. the musice was good there and a special treat was the 
person drumming along to the beat of the music. :)

  the most special event i went to was on friday night, the
gathering. it was amazing! the first location was at the marina,
and was great music+vibe were good, but it was then busted and
moved to another location. i helped move the sound system and 
people would just come up and start talking and everyone was on
the friendly tip. THe vibe there was incredible!! i really do not
think i have ever experienced anything similar. 
  most people were out there dancing and feeling the music and vibe.
compared to many east coast events ive been to it has been a LONG
time since anything comparable.
  just being able to check out the sf scene and seeing how well it
works and has evolved, and comparing it to siimilar scenes along
the east coast and its not hard to see why there are few events out
here and many in san francisco. the people have their shit together.
there is a really commited amount of people who go to these events.
heck its just incredible!

  not to mention san francisco and the surrounding area is amazing!
special thanks to cindy k. and brian b. for being such wonderful,
helpful and tolerant hosts and putting up with any imposition that
i caused. thanks to tafor being ggreat and making it and helping me
gget around the city.
  t was ggreat to finally meat people who i had only knew over
the computer: plui(pat) jerry(tarbaby), bryan(now i know who you
are),myklg, twitch, derek, leah, ccat, dana, and many other people.
  its great to actually get away from the computer and be with people
for real!
 
  and wow to the city of san francisco, its beautiful fogg, its
people,
its wonderful sights, beautiful view, amazing cafes, fine
record stores. and truly special scene that you are all lucky to have!

maybe i can join you out there next year :) !!

cindy and brian thank you for views, drives, clam chowder, neat
dancing locations and cable car rides!!!

sorry to people who received this letter three times. i apologize!

peace and love to all

Although it sounded really neat, and I even had 2 comp tickets, I still
blew this thing off when I found out how far away it was....

Perhaps that's the problem.

	I think it's the distancethat's the prblem, aswell. But what
can we do about it? The reason theseplaces are so *wonderful* is
BECAUSE they are far away from civilization, the lights of the city,
the pigs of the city, etc.I don't see any way of fixing the
distanceproblem. (Unlessthereare places close to the city which have a
wonderful atmosphere.. I'm new here so I wouldn't know of such a site,
but I have a feeling that it woudln't exist.)

I think part of the problem is the *inane* tradition of not "revealing*
the location until a few hours before.  Thats' fine & ncessary for an underground
but when you're asking people to travel it's important to know if it's gonna
be 2 hrs away or 6.  And silly claims by promoters that, par exemple, 
a party in Livermore is "20 minutes from the Bay Bridge" also contriubte
to the credibility problem that IMHO is killing off at least the big end
of the rave biz ( yes, a mixed curse ).

    I would have gone to Lovestock, but I had other commitments last weekend.
    I *did* go to Penelope's Web (much farther away), and I will go to the
    next one, whenever.

    The distance, itself, isn't the problem.  *Driving* the distance is.
    For something like Lovestock, they might have gotten a much better
    turnout if they had allocated some of the $30/head to a shuttle bus.

    Sell tickets, discounted, in advance, and perhaps include transportation
    in the price.

Also, not disclosing the cost doesn't help much either.  I know of
one case in which some people arrived at LoveStock and were told that 
it was $30.  They turned around, walked away, and were beckoned back to 
be let in for $25.  Then there are the advertised "100% Bust Free" spaces 
that get busted, and of course, it takes more than a few weeks to
forget total fiascos like the last IMagiNation.

There was a time, not too long ago, that ravers were much more willing
to roll with the punches, 'cause there was this feeling that the promoters
were in it with us, and if things got fucked up, there was a sense that
at least the right intentions were there.  Free weekly GG Park raves
and $5 monthly ComeUnity parties helped foster this sense of a
nonexploitative community.   Whether or not promoters these days are in 
it *just* for the money is not the issue.  The issue is simply one of
perception.  Ravers are not a bunch of dumb sheep, and after feeling 
misled a few times they'll either start throwing smaller parties 
themselves, or just go with some friends to the vibe-diminished, 
but somewhat conveniant & dependable clubs that happen to play house 
music.  Either way, if promoters don't buy into the original "vibe"
that started raving, there really won't be much of a need for them.

Bob has a point there. I'm far more likely to go to a camping event
given 4-5 days notice of its location.

See you at Willits :).

Exactly how far away was this event? I personally have a hard time going to
events that are so far away because I am always concerned about driving home
safely...

This mail _should_ go through this time...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok...shoot...my message didn't go through...oh well...see if I can remember this
Yeah...it finally happened, at twoish, we got to this beautiful meadow surrounded by a happy forest out in the middle of nowhere...
somewhere north of Santa Cruz...helped set up, and Carlos started 
spinning (Carlos IS GOD) at around 2:30+...and within two minutes,
everywone was dancing...I found the crowd mighty-o friendly, and all happy
smiles... I saw very little alcohol at all...and I had no problem trading
my happy lemon heads for some happy gummy bears or suckers...yum-yum...
...there was a good 150-200 
ravers the whole time...I found myself lacking in dance energy, so I kicked back
in the Ambience forest (Set up by...damn, can't remember...whoever they
were, they were fun
had a palm and a very acurate tarot card reading...came back, bounced
away to Alonzo a while (Alonzo is the shit<--that's good) and I don't know
who else...cops came at 6:30...
Overall, I had a great time...the crowd was very positive, the music was
bone stoping intense, the new-new location was beautiful, and the candy was
dandy...
Oh yeah...it was FREE, an not ten dollars like it said on the flyers...the DJ's decided not to charge after they found the final location...
Best thing was tho, it was small...and not comercial at all...low key raves
are the best...they make you feel rebelious once again...and you remember
what _underground_ means again...screw Cyberfest's...
But...anyways...rambleramble...
HAVE FUN AND MERRY XMAS!

Ya, likewise did anyone see the article in the Image section of the Sunday
Chronicle?  It's about raving and E.T.'s and it's done by (can't remember
her name) the girl who does some of the work on MTV's Liquid TV.  It's very
Mondoish for the Chronicle.  Has Ernie Munson shredding the slopes of reality,
too.

Hey All,

Well, it's been a while since I had a weekend fun enough
to merit a report...

Checked out Cord. City on Friday night.  Hot, good
energy, good visuals, free water, 18+, & ok music.
Saturday, I was hi-jacked by some friends and ended
up at The Fridge.  Good music!

Weird thing about this weekend was that on both 
nights, I only ran into one person that I knew,
and recognized very few people.  Seems like there's
definitely a new wave. <** Had a conversation about 
this with a friend who said that although he had a 
great time at Cord. City, he's never going back 
because he wouldn't want to ruin it for them (newbies).
A very good point, I'd say. **>

So, Sunday, I spent the day hanging out...basically 
putting off sleep as long as possible, something that
I *always* hate myself for on Mondays.  :)

And tonight...Pepper or JazzUp?

Ravi

Well, Like is said if your worried that you won't make it back to Boogie Buffet
or that its too far to drive, (tell me how one can view the milky way, or see
wild hares from anyplace south of market) then outdoor rural raves are not
for you.

I personally am tired of coming out of a rave in the morning and picking
black soot out of my nose and wondering what my lungs must look like.

I only know one thing and that's certain, after a night of hyperventilating
at a place like bonny dune, my lungs feel GREAT!!

********************Attention Earthlings************************

Keep your eyes and ears open for Mother Earth Sound System #5, at an
outdoor East Bay location Labor Day weekend.  

This time (we promise), the exact directions will be on the net at least 2
days before the party.

And as always, we can be reached by phone [Scott @ 510.549.6230 or Whit @
549.6240] and on the net.  

And as always, if you'd like to help us out in any way, please get in
touch with us (we could use contributions to our zine, generator loan, and
of course, a wealthy patron ;-).

And as always, we appreciate it when you tell your friends about our
events, chloroform them, hog-tie them and drag them kicking and twitching onto
our grassy dancefloor.

Enuff respect to gag the pope and more peace than 20 doves pooping on your
front lawn (:-)))))))))

Yea!  No doubt,  that certainly cuts down on the number of people that
can make it,   but on the other hand,  getting there is half the fun.

Hmmm!  I thought I was going to be really sore for dancing all weekend,
but today I don't feel sore at all.   Just stiff from sleeping 14 hours
of continious sleep.   Taking the phome off the hook can do wonders
when one needs to sleep.   Geel GREAT!  And ready to do it again
whenever...

And later in the SAME article I said:
Renegade - Many have asked "How'd they have it there with all those ---s in
the ---d?"  Heard some good things about it, way to go!  Hopefully onto a
more original venue, but ya gotta start somewhere!

I did not know the name of the party but this passage at the end of my
article was near the end.  I should have mentioned the addr (3 & 24) so
that it was clear to you and other Bob.

I know that it is VERY difficult to find new spaces, ESP here in SF.  I
just don't like it when everyone thinks it's the latest and baddest when
others had blazed that trail before.  I admire ANYONE for pulling a one-off
in a parking lot, in a park, marina whatever.  It takes a special person to
throw a party even knowing the the cops are right around the corner. 
Whenever someone throws a renegade I am quite happy that they had the GUTS
to make a diff.  Thus the PROPS at the end!  Information is given.

Peace out :)
John

You are misinformed.  I bagged on the space, not the party.  Maybe if you
read the entire message you would see the PROPS at the end.  But alas
myopia set in and.....


>Vortex wasn't all that great, IMHO.  Check it.

You are misinformed.  You use the word singularly when there were actually
5 parties.  Which one was not all that great?  In any case that's fine. 
The mojority had a good time, sorry you didn't.  We have a STEADY 500+ who
attend (a smaller party IMO), and we are always asked to do more.  So
although I don't like to hear that you didn't have a good time, and will
invite you back again, I am happy that others did.  Nice slam though. 
Thanks for thinking about me.  Check it.

You are misinformed.  Didn't bag the party just the space.  Let's see if I
say read the bottom of that post, or if I say..., or maybe I should repeat
myself 20 times...aw forget it.  You'll only read the first line which will
say: Check it.

You are misinformed.  I have mentioned NOTHING about C2 becuase I never
went (or to C1, or to Cx).  I have read that you all had a good time and
trust that information.  Your opinion remains your own, but I am glad to
see anyone have a good time at any party!

>
>Rival that and maybe I'd accept your condecending tone.  Otherwise,

You are misinformed.  Foolish person.  I throw parties for one reason and
one reason only.  I throw them for myself.  I, note "I", want to have a
good time at my party and since that takes precedence I take great care in
location, venue, and all apsects of production.  By ensuring that it meets
my and my partners satisfaction we are pleased.  Others throw parties for
all type of innocuous reasons.  And as a result they lose focus.  If you
try to please yourself, while keeping in mind that others will see your
handiwork, and look at what was done and say "would I pay $10-$15 to be
here?" and answer in the affirmative then you can't go wrong.  When the
formula is "hey this costs us this much therefore we have to charge xx" or
the focus becomes let's add $3000 of special efx so we cna sharge more, or
we gotta give the people waht they want oinstead of being TRUE to yourself
then you MAY make alot of money, but there will be no vibe.  I think, (as
well as the 500+), that the V has that vibe.  The proof in all this is that
although we have not made money, for the most part broken even, and will
continue to do more.  People have always asked us when the next one is. 
People have wanted to work with us since we put everything we have into a
party (not just money, but spirit), and it shows.  But oh well.  We have
also learned there are some you just can't please.  But such is life.  You
are now informed. Oh yeah, the one thing that is OLD and done with is the
competition aspect.  That shit has been gone, but like a Serb you keep
bringin up old ways.  There is new cooperation.  And I would nevert try to
"top" C2, since that is not a standard I choose to base anything on.  I try
to top myself and my own expectations.  This is far more difficult than
beating someone else down.  Try it, you'll be a much better person for it. 
Trust me for I am the prophet and "ultimate insider"!

Check that!

You are misinformed.  I am defending my friends.  And I will determine what
is right for me.  But I do appreciate your concern for my judgement and
will show such appreciation (not!).  You know if others played by your

You are misinformed.  I have seen most of this attitude from a few SFR's,
not necessarily promoters.  But promoters, SFR's, and everyone is guilty at
least one time (if not more) in their life of thinking that their way is
right.  And it just ges bandided about.  Everyone gets a chance, and
usually there is a little truth in what many say.  Just call it chaos.  As
for the money, they ARE entitled to it IF you lay it in their palm.

You are misinformed.  The boycott will not be effective as new ranks will
be there to replace you and your voice will be diminished.  rather you
shoudltry to change things by at least talking to them and airing your
greivances.  That's what the promoters meeting should've been all about. 
But instead of facing the opposition and engaging in meaningful dialog, you
would rather hyperbole.  Not effective, and you shout into the wind
spitting in your own face.  But if that is effective to you...then I better
check it.

You are misinformed.  The rave scene operates much more on a barter system
than anything else.  Yes there is money exchanged, but there are also
plenty of non-monetary favors (like "I'll lend you my projector if you give
me 2 video tapes" or "get me and my 2 friends in free-of-charge [foc] and
I'll loan you...").  So the capitalist model you constantly rail against
hardly applies to the rave scene.  Same with clubs since there are many
non-monetary favors exchanged, and deals made.  Now you are informed. 
Check it.

>(earning money is no-one's god given right -- check it!).

You are correct.  And I as a promoter have every right to challenge
anything I see as slanderous or unfair to any of my promoter friends, or dj
friends, or helper friends.  Blood is way thicker than water or concept. 
Threats are illogical, and payment is usually expensive. Check it.

You are misinformed.  They are doing you a favor.  Think of it.  If you
weren't at a rave you'd be in the streets causing trouble, robbing, looting
and other nonsense.  Keeping you locked up is the secret plan we all have. 
And if you stay home our mission has been accomplished.  Remeber the
Promoter's are always out to get you so watch your back, and your wallet,
your water, your woman/man, your dancing shoes, and your state of mind.

You are misinformed.  The party goes on even if you stay home.  And the
only person to lose out is the promoter.  He loses a person who is clueless
as to what's what, he loses major negative energy that causes trouble at
parties.  He loses a griper who has done nothing to make a diff.  Oh well
you are correct. the promoter does lose, in the positive.  Check THAT!

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Has anybody heard about Digidesign's Session 8 -- it's an 8 channel
direct-to-disk, recording, mixing, DSP, and random access editing, with
a supposedly "full" (whatever that means) MIDI implementation. $3995.00
list (plus your PC w/ Windows 3.1), includes SCSI controller....

How good are the "low end" audio hardware and software for the PC?
(e.g. Microsoft's Windows Sound System, Sound Blaster 16ASP, Media
Vision Pro Audio Spectrum 16). Any recommended random access editing
systems for such a platform?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ya, I've heard of it.  And dreamt of finding $3995.00 and buying it.

The "low end" stuff isn't really digital audio, per se.  I have the Sound
Blaster 16ASP and it's real fun to play with but there's not much you
can do with it in terms of making or contributing to music.  It has good
sound for games, it let's you spice up your environment by assigning sound
effects to system calls (porky pig saying bdi bdi bdi that's all folks when
I shut down windows, etc.), and currently I'm having lots of fun with the
recorder and editor by tweaking and looping samples, etc. until I get a "real"sampler that I can control via midi.  It's good practice though, and I can
start planning and arranging music until I get a midi controler, sequencer,
and a sampler (I already have a keyboard and a couple of drum machines).

Oh, by the way.  There is a new direct-to-disk recorder/midi interface (I
think) that is about to or just came out.  It only has 2 channels digital
audio but it's also only around $600.00.  It's called the TAP 10 and Roland
makes it.  Check it. ;-)

Cintra Wilson is one of the top young playwrites in town, has had many
successful shows, has performed as an actress and with large puppets of her
own creation, has driven a used meter maid enclosed bike around town, and
seduced the Spoonman as Cobra Woman during Cobra Lounge theater jams.

This was all before MTV.  There is a life beyond raving.  Any show of hers
is worth price of admission.

I've got a really neat idea for a T-shirt, and I was wondering if
someone might be able to help me out. I need someone who can drive a
computer graphics program to help me do a proof. I'll then take that
to a silkscreener (anybody know one?) and have the shirt printed or
have them show me how to do it.

This is just a one time deal.

I also have a really good vrave design in my head that would make a
good shirt. If I'm happy with the first project, maybe I'll think
about doing the latter (non-profit -- profiting from starving college
students is evil).

I talked to Mats and we looked for the paper that he used as a basis for his
time compression code.  We couldn't find it, but he said it was in the
Computer Music Journal about 2 years ago masquerading under a title that was
about granular synthesis.

Sorry I couldn't find the issue or the title, but I'll keep looking.

Oops.  I think the point was that he didn't feel that
he had the optimism/enthusiasm/energy/*innocence* to
make a positive contribution to the party. 

The opinion I've heard most on the net is that the older
generation needs to show the younger generation what it's 
all about.  

Now, I'm starting to wonder why?  Isn't discovery and 
self-discovery the most beautiful part of it all?  How
can the scene change if the older generation (which I
believe is set in its ways and opinions) exerts its
influence (just by being at a party) and "steers" 
the experience of the younger ones?  In a way this
seems like a disservice to me.

Of course, I'm not going to stop going to parties--
maybe I'll try to go with the flow a bit more.

Clearer now?

Mark October 3rd, Sunday on your calenders.

We've just been approved to put on a party for members,
friends and family of SFRaves.  The permit will be for 
300-500 people, with amplified sound from 1-5 pm.  I was
able to talk the park officials into waiving the requirement
to provide portable toilets, so the total cost to us will
be $300 for the park permit plus $35 for the SFPD sound permit
plus whatever a generator costs.  Ethan (nrg) will be providing
the sound system for free.  This will be a free event by SFRaves
for ourselves and the community.  The following people have
already donated money:

Larry Ching, Arthur Chandler, Derek Chung, Ravi Gadhia,
Eric Pederson, Ti Fred, Tim Hyland, Bob Jesse for a total of
$180.

Send your contributions to:
Lee Fogel
2444 Van Ness Ave.  Apt. 2
San Francisco, Ca. 94109

I'll probably be going to Ananda in Friday if you want to give in person.  
Thanks to everyone for your support.  This is gonna be great!

         TRAVELLERS

Everyone has heard of the
rise of facism and the far
right in Germany and France,
but for me the real danger
is in Britain. The conserva-
tive party are not publicly
facist, but their policies
in the past are nothing com-
pared to what they are now
trying to do. Their refusal
to join the social chapter
is well known (and is a good
example of their contempt
for their own people and the
rest of Europe). What is not
so well known is that their
treatment of political oppo-
sition and minorities in
Britain. A good example of
their undemocratic methods
is their treatment of the
travelling people and the
festival movement. Many peo-
ple have heard how the po-
lice attacked and destroyed
a convoy of travellers going
to Stonehenge in 1985. This
was not the only attack;
there were at least two
other major assaults on
groups of travellers at
about that time. The media
was instructed not to report
those. Since then, there
have been many such inci-
dents, including one violent
police attack on a Spiral
Tribe rave last year. The
conservative government are
now trying to pass laws to
make the gypsy and travel-
ling lifestyle illegal (this
is against the European De-
claration of Human Rights).
They are also trying to des-
troy the free festival move-
ment, to make squatting il-
legal, to prevent people
taking direct action against
fox hunting, and to make it
illegal to busk or beg for
money.
These new laws have a pur-
pose, to destroy the alter-
native movement of Britain.
I believe that if they are
allowed to do so, other Eu-
ropean governments will try
to do the same. I think it
is important that you are
informed of what is really
happening in Britain, and
that you take some action to
help prevent it. For exam-
ple, write to your EEC elec-
ted representative, and ask
them to exclude Britain from
the EEC.

I have a really good idea for a T-shirt, and I need a little graphics
help. If someone is decent at driving graphics software, I need help
making a couple of reasonably simple designs.

Anyone know a good silkscreener? Or someone with a shop that will show
me how to do it?

I also have an awesome idea for a vrave shirt. If the first shirt (not
vrave) turns out, maybe I'll put down the vrave design and make some
shirts for the Vravers.

    Then some of us in the older generation have found all
    of this rather recently and are still figuring it out.

    I first experienced the Vibe at Grateful Dead concerts, and
    continue to do so every chance I get.  Other musicians (too few)
    work intentionally with it as well -- I am always on the lookout...

    Raves run at a much higher energy level and the music never stops
    and rarely slows down.
    Everyone is there to dance, very few will just sit and listen.
    I dance for hours and feel more alive/awake/energized when I leave
    than when I went in.

    Periodically, someone on rec.music.gdead posts something of the form
    "What are we going to do when the Dead can't tour anymore?"
    I know what I'm going to do (am already doing)...



    [It seems like almost everyone I talked to when I was at Penelope's Web
    is planning to see the Dead in Oregon this weekend.  Interesting.

    Those concerts are in the afternoon, by the way.
    Parking lots are open *all night*.  hmmmmmmmm...
    Camping OK.  Lots of extra tickets on the net.
    (I'll be taking the train up there a day early)

Subject: Precautionary Measures to Avoid Hantavirus Illness
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 93 10:42:52 -0700

 INFORMATIONAL BULLETIN
 PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES
 TO AVOID HANTAVIRUS ILLNESS

 We have recently been notified by the California Department of Health
 Services that precautionary measures should be taken to avoid exposure
 to the acute flu-like virus known as the hantavirus.  The disease is
 also known as the Four Corners Respiratory Disease or the Adult
 Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  There have been two fatal cases
 in California.  One California case appeared to be acquired in the
 Mammoth Lakes (Mono County) area in July, 1993, while the other appeared
 to have been acquired in the Santa Barbara area in September, 1992.
 Thus far, per the Orange County Health Care Agency, there have not been
 any confirmed cases in Orange County and it is unlikely that urban areas
 will be affected.  However, basic precautions should be taken by
 vacationers or other individuals who travel to potentially affected
 wilderness areas.  Persons who may handle deer mice or other wild
 rodents or are exposed to their wilderness habitats could be at risk.

 This notice provides information for the prevention of hantavirus
 infection and establishes precautions for handling materials infected
 with the virus or working in an environment potentially infected with
 the virus.  The agent has been associated almost exclusively with
 deer mice(genus Peromyscus) but can potentially affect other rodents.
 The agent is transmissible via contact through the respiratory route
 with urine, feces, and dust from the rodents or their habitats. Human
 to human contact does not seem to occur.  The hantavirus causes an acute
 illness characterized in its most severe form by fever, headache, muscle
 aches, breathing difficulty, bleeding, kidney failure, and shock.  Since
 May of this year, it reportedly has claimed the lives of 16 persons
 nationwide, including the two cases in California.  The respective local
 health agencies and the state are conducting surveillance and control
 efforts.  The Mammoth Lakes area case involved a 27 year-old female UCSD
 wildlife biology graduate student and the Santa Barbara County case
 involved a 50-year old male ranch hand who trapped rodents.  Only these
 two isolated cases are known to have occurred in California, and there
 is no evidence of widespread disease activity.

 Simple precautions can reduce the risk of exposure to the hantavirus;

 1.  Avoid contact with deer mice and other wild rodents whether dead
 or alive.  Do not camp on, or otherwise disrupt, their burrows.  Avoid
 breathing dust from soil around rodent burrows, which is likely to
 contain dried rodent excreta.

 2.  Store food in secure containers so that rodents are not attracted
 to the food by its smell nor able to contaminate the food.

 3.  Rodents that carry bacteria and viruses that can infect humans may
 not appear ill themselves.  To be safe, never handle or try to pet any
 wild animal. If dead animals are observed, notify county health, park,
 or Forest Service officials, who will arrange safe collection.  On
 campus, notify Facilities Management at extension 5444.

 4.  Individuals who rent or own cabins in wilderness areas or occupy
 cabins on university business should take appropriate precautions.
 These include ventilating for thirty minutes by opening all doors and
 windows prior to occupancy.  Do not sleep directly on the ground or on
 cabin floors or occupy structures where there is evidence of heavy
 rodent infestations.  Rodent excreta should be cleaned up with caution.
 Do not perform any dry sweeping operations.  Prior to clean-up, the
 contaminated area and any dead animals should be soaked in a phenol
 disinfectant (e.g. Lysol) or a solution of 1 part household bleach to
 4 parts water.  Rubber gloves should be worn, and dead animals should be
 double-bagged in plastic for safe disposal.  Consult EH&S for more
 details on preventative measures.

 5.  As indicated earlier, there have not been any confirmed cases in
 Orange County, and urban areas are unlikely to be affected.  However,
 the campus is taking a conservative approach to illness prevention.
 In addition to issuing these guidelines, EH&S staff are contacting key
 campus administrators and other individuals who are being given special
 instructions regarding illness prevention as it relates to this virus.
 If you believe that your work or responsibilities could place you or
 your colleagues at risk, or you know of others who could be at risk,
 please contact EH&S.

 6.  On campus, buildings that have been unoccupied for some time, or
 are infrequently occupied, should be inspected by professional vector
 control personnel prior to occupancy.  This includes sheds and other
 structures that may have heavy rodent infestations.  Consult EH&S for
 further details.

 7.  Any campus research laboratory colonies of wild rodents should be
 screened for evidence of exposure to this agent.

 8.  Researchers or others who work with Peromyscus in wildlife settings,
 such as people who set traps, open burrows, or perform other activities
 that may expose them to aerosols of urine, feces, or contaminated dust
 should wear coveralls, gloves, and a fitted respirator with a HEPA
 filter.  They should wear eye protection, such as goggles or a face
 shield if the respirator does not cover their eyes.

     In addition, researchers and others who work with Peromyscus in
 wildlife settings and have experienced flu-like symptoms in the last
 two months should see a physician.  If the symptoms are confirmed by
 the physician to be associated with this virus, please also contact
 EH&S.  When applicable, the physician has access to a special treatment
 of intravenous ribavirin available through the California Department
 of Health (510)540-2566 or Center for Disease Control (404)639-3311.
 Physicians who suspect hantavirus infection are being asked by the
 California Department of Health to call these telephone numbers.

 For further information or if you have any questions contact John Chan
 or Rebecca Lally, EH&S, at extension 7101.

Yeah, the Castro St. Fair is one of the better city fairs.
From past experiences, it becomes jam packed after 12.  I
suggest to anyone who hasn't been to the C. St. Fair to
check it out in the morning and then come over to Marx
Meadows.  But we really do have to cut the music at 5, so
don't be late.

speaking of new finds, maybe some of you would like to know about an album i  
recently stumbled across:  babel by D*NOTE.  it's a strange and delightful  
mix of house beats, hip hop, rap, rock, spoken voice samples and other  
sounds.  creative intros & interludes - classical, choral, swing.  decidedly  
jazzy in parts (could swear i heard some Kind of Blue riffs).  other parts  
have the clash and sonic layering style of Consolidated or the later Beastie  
Boys album.  way cool art, i think.

    Seems like I got stiff and sore last week from *NOT* dancing.
    Shook the cobwebs out last weekend.
    No raves, but Neville Brothers and Jerry Garcia Band on Saturday
    and Duran Duran on Sunday did the job.  I feel much better now.

I used to have a theory about this that as key members died, and after an
appropriate mourning period, they would be replaced and the member with
the most seniority would become the key man and they Grateful Dead would
go on for ever.  Jerry replaced Pig pen, Bobby will replace Jerry, etc.

My point is that raves go on any time, anywhere, as long as people want
to have them,  not being dependent on a particular group of musicians
to keep them going.

	Yea, and perhaps even more important, raves last longer than
2 sets, so you're not left wandering around all wide-eyed just when
things were getting really interesting.....

	Although I still find the dead more "spiritually uplifting" or
whatever.

Well I went to Progress last night, and there were
more people there then last week. When I got there
Rick P. was doing a pretty good set, but towards the
end he played some really good grooves. Then came
Carlos whom I have not seen for awhile. I went over
and talked to him for awhile, he was in his usual
happy fully charged and ready to go mood! He said he
hasn't been in the area for awhile, but he was glad 
to be there last night. He played a most killer set!!!
My friend who has never heard him couldn't keep his
jaw from hitting the ground. Carlos was doing all
sorts of stuff with the mixer, tweeking knobs, scratching,
slowing down the record etc. I love watching him he's
such the performer. Anyway I left before Julius came
on do to work at 7am. It wasn't that bad of a crowd. It
seemed to have more people on the sidelines than dancing,
but hey I wasn't complaining, at one point I had the whole
floor to my self with Carlos spinning the killer music.
Oh ya! Yes, he did play salsa like usual and like usual
I loved it!

A glimpse into the plastiscene ball reveals dead Dead key-members
(DDKM) pumped full of formaldehyde, propped up on stage, and turned
into MIDI-controlled-audio-animatronic-players-of-instruments
(MCAAPOI); controlled by a massive neural net which had been trained by
watching thousand of videos and DAT soundboards of concerts.

A new front-seating area would be added where audience members that had
paid dearly for tickets would be able to control DDKM's via MIDI-ball;
The results often are crazed hurky-jerky dance moves by the DDKM,
somehow strangely organic in a surrealist sort of way. Meanwhile,
band-members rush to keep up with their dead companion's motions and
notes. Overall, this will add a new sense of interactivity to the
concert experience!

Actually, mine sees a new subculture-integrating marketing strategy
developing, with a supergroup, The Greatful Dead Kennedys (with Bobby K.
backup singing!) emerging after they are all preserved (and the rights
(rites?) to thier images piad for, of course.)  The resulting tunes, like
Touch of Nazi Punk and Tennessee Vomit  go megaplatinum.
(Sorry- long day at work)

  OFFICE MEMO         Is the scene dying?                   Date:  8/18/93
This "virtual community" works best when the members talk together and discuss
a topic as a group, instead of waging in odd flame wars and stuff like that. 
(Why do so many of you hate nitrus?  That stuff is just straight up fun, I
think.)

But my real point.  After last weekend's series of fiascoes, I come back to a
thought that I have pondered/"figured out" during the last couple of parties,
even the so-called "good ones" like Unity and Basics.  

Is the scene dying? 

Everyone probably agrees that last year was a lot better than this year, as far
as quality of parties goes and the crowd.  Most of you know me, I ove going to
these things.  I try to have a good time, and I try to be a positive experience
to everyone I meet.  But lately, things have just been plain SLOW.  The crowds
are more insular, and the parties lacking...something.  Of course, there are
exceptions, but they are few and far between.  The last just ripping time I had
was the last Vision and the Basics Finale.  Those parties went OFF.  I had a
proper time at Unity, but it was like the last Come/Unity party (IMHO), the
props were there, but the people just weren't into it as much.  Lasers are
cool, but nothing replaces a truly good vibe (remember that Channeling in the
Stone?  GOOD time!).

I will remark no further.  I merely want to start a thread so there can be some
really good positive discussion on what is going on, how people feel the scene
is progressing, and what can be done, if anything, to rejuvenate the house
scene in northern california.

I think Lee's efforts for the Park party are going to really pay off (check's
in the mail, good sir!), and I think there ARE some good exceptions to this
dreary downfall--FreeLife in San Jose has one of the best vibes and is
consistently one of the best parties around.  Period.

Okay.  Go off, friends.

Mike

[Sameer asked me to type in a Penelope's Web site description for some
people he knows. I figured I might as well post it. -Sean]

The Penelope's Web site is as perfect a site as I have ever seen for a
rave.  It is a beautiful retreat set in wooded hills at about 2500
feet elevation.  It's about 20 minutes east from Willits, CA, about
10-15 miles down a mostly gravel road.

The site is about 400 (!!!) acres of forest with the occasional open
field.  There is privacy should one wish to wander off and be alone or
to be alone with someone.  There are no neighbors nearby, no highways,
and no airplanes overhead.  One hears and sees only the mother earth.
There will be great music, but if one wishes, silence is only a 15
minute walk away.

Running water is available at several places.  There is a shower, two
bathrooms, a kitchen, a beautiful deck made with homemade fired brick,
and a lawn with shade trees overhead.  A large vegetable and flower
garden provides food for the 4 residents.  Power is supplied by solar
cells and batteries.  Up on the hill there is a mud pit--a great way
to cool off on a hot day.

At the first Penelope's Web, the hosts were very friendly and
hospitable in the finest sense.  I was surprised when I wandered back
down in the morning to find hot coffee (!), whole-grain pancakes, and
an amazing shared-comraderie-friendliness awaiting.

The landowner, I am told, is a hippy type :) who wanted to get away
from it all a while back.  He's sympathetic to the cause, and is fully
informed as to what his land is being used for.  Two of the residents
there participated in the first Penelope's Web. As a matter of fact, I
have this fantastic picture of one of them in the mud-pit with the
rest of us.

I couldn't imagine a better site and better promoters.  It is
beautiful, isolated, has facilities, is perfect for camping, is as
bustproof as it ever gets, and it just *feels* good.

Given the chance, I think I'd live there.

Sean

========

Because of the incredible nature of the site, a few restrictions--as I
understand them--have to apply:

The event needs to be around 300 people.  More than, say, 500 would be
injurious to the site.  Therefore interesting arrangements for tickets
have to be made.

The woods are dry this time of year, and the fire hazard is very high.
We don't want a tragedy, so smoking is allowed only in the large
central gravelled area.

There is only parking on-site for about 10 cars and it's fragile at
that.  Plus, the road narrows long before it gets to the site.
Parking on-site just isn't feasible (perhaps this is a good thing).
Instead, people will be ferried there in buses.  Probably 20-seaters.

Seriously, I wouldn't agree at all. I've been witness to a lot of
wonderful super-friendly vibes and some really wonderful events since
my arrival in CA this March.

The last couple of weekends, I admit, were a little slow. And we had
our share of fiascos. But that hasn't deterred lots of smaller
parties. And some of the bigger parties have went off well, too.

I think as long as there are people who want good events, and putting
on a good event isn't too expensive, that there will be good events.

Just have a little patience for the slow spots. And if someone wants
to do an event, help out! Contribute to the positive energy. That's
the best investment I think you could make. NRG's party was _really_
small, but a heck of a lot of fun for me. If he wants to do it again,
I'll be there! And I'll probably drag some more people along :).

Well ,after a rave-less period , I'm going to try to hit two events
this weekend - Ananda and Culture . By coincidence , both say that they 
are outside events - should be nice for the lungs!
 
 I especially want to go to Ananda to hear Goa Gil again , and I want 
to go to Culture as a "support the South Bay/Santa Cruz" kinda thing , 
although it'll probably end up at Candlestick  :-) :-) ....
 
 Has anybody heard anything especially good/bad about these upcoming
events?

I don't know how to say this, so I'm just going to say it.

I feel very much like a traitor, but I think I've been properly
supportive in enough situations that it's clear I don't "bug out"
lightly.

I haven't talked to Melissa, but I tried reaching her yesterday.  I do
need to talk to her still, so these comments are preliminary.

I feel like I need to post, though, because there's been a good bit of
discussion here about the event on the 28th at Willits (PW II?) and I
think it's important to talk about it.

Last I heard, Walter, the landowner, decided he needed $500 minimum or
$10 per person, whichever is greater, for us to use the land.  Melissa
agreed to this.  I think it's outrageous, given that we haven't thrown
a successful event up there yet.

As a "rave consumer" I would have a hard time getting excited about an
event where I would need to drive 3 hours one way and pay $30 (the
estimated charge per person according to Melissa's last message on my
answering machine Sunday).

Now, I'm sure that there are those who went to the first event who
would be willing -- camping is like $8 a night at state grounds, and
this includes food and tunes and the site is gorgeous and all that --
but I'm just generally against $30 events.

I'm also a little bit tweaked by the fact that we need some SERIOUS
promotion --- even underground promotion takes time and effort.  With
the green light from Walter only on last Sunday, there was less than
two weeks to the event, with lots of details still to be ironed out.

I could see this happening, even at $30 if need be (if that can be
justified), but only if we put this together well in advance.  I think
we'd need a really strong DJ lineup with lots of participation from
everyone.  I think we'd need a really good sound system.  I think we'd
need to rethink our approach to the van shuttles.  I think we'd want
to / need to sell advance tickets.

Maybe I'm just being a fuddy-duddy, but I think this event needs more
time to develop and happen properly... and if Melissa wants to go
ahead with this event, that's fine, and I support her 100% and hope
she does well with it and I hope that everyone who missed the first
event goes.  But I'm not going to be involved, and I will be
contacting Melissa and trying to get her to reschedule this in
September or hold off until the spring, when we can have one with
enough lead time to make it really viable.

Email about PW in general should still go to the list, but if you have
personal comments to me, please send them to me and off of the list.
Thanks.

Bob

Sigh, $30 is just too much. This really bums me out. As much as I've
tooted my horn over this, it's really against my common sense to spend
over $20 at a rave. A lot of people I know just can't justify throwing
$30 of food money at a rave, no matter how good.

Well, I hope they can work something out. I'll talk to Melissa and
express my concerns. And I was going to take some vacation time, too.

Sigh.

This is a really important point.  The promoter, Melissa, was very
concerned about the land on which it was held.  She much preferred
a too small turnout with really good people than a much too large one
with people who might not have had the right respect in mind for the
property.  She was very worried before the party about the number
of people who might show up.

It would probably be wise to refrain from dropping fliers "from
SF -> SJ" without checking with her first.  Instead, tell everyone
you know who are good people about the event and about the incredible
site.  Convince them that this may be one of the most beautiful
locations for a rave they may ever see....

I'll try to get more info on what in terms of other promotion
she feels comfortable with.

Drugs will kill any scene.....In febuaray of this year - Moby paid a visit to  
Chicago and said to a local promoter "Come the end of august, your scene will be  
dead, its killing itself with drugs"  and he was right - completely right - In  
Chicago the rave scene is dead - drugs (expessially N2O) have killed  
it...fourtunatley something new is arising here - what it is...I can't say yet -  
and where it will go I can't say either - but it revolves around disco, house, and  
the dark - no lights just energy in complete blackness....I've only been to one  
party like this - you walk in the door and you can't see.....just music.....but you  
can feel the people dancing - all embracing with their hearts the folks imediatley  
near them.....no drugs....

Nitrous kills things - if you have 200 at a party and the tank arives and 75 people  
do ballons and wander around like zombies the party is OVER - the vibe is lost for  
ever right their ---- one peice of advice for all of you in SF don't let N2o  
destroy your scene......kill it before it kills you

  How many people on here have the DMX (Digital Music Express)
service?   I finally moved to an area that offers it.   There
is a channel that specializes in Techno House, trance,  but
very little generic disco.   For instance,   last night,  the
following set was played (And fairly well mixed - Sometimes :-)

Song title		Artist/Musician		Album title
----------		---------------		-----------

Dance your ass off	RTZ Belgium		Rave Dawn
Can you feel it		CLS			This is strictly rythm
Domything		Sub-Urban Soul		Declaration of..
Bass			Madd People		Madd People
Let the Beat Control	Eddy S.			Rave-ology


Anyway!!  This is whats offered on OUR dance channel on DMX.   
I am not familiar with any of the titles of Techno House stuff,
nor do I actually care,   but DMX offers this other neat thing..

You can punch in "View",  and all the song info displays on the
remote control...  Title,  Artist,  Composer,  Album,  Weeks on
chart,  Position last week,  and position this week.  Through
this,   I was able to write down some of this stuff so others can
get an idea of what it offers.

I'll see some of you folks this Thursday at YSH....My body feels
like it's ready to be moved again....

PS:  I would like to me on the TIX list for the rave up at Willits
whenever it happens...

See Ya!!

Okay, then. New rave vs. Heaven thought:

Heaven (hev' en) n.- 1. Christian afterlife. (bleh!) 2. A bustproof rave
that never ends, has a cool chill area, free water, and all your friends,
offering free acid and X at the door so you can enjoy the kickass spins of
the YSH DJs even more than you ever thought possible.

Our Friend Mike asks:  
> Is the scene dying?

No.  It seems to be evolving and churning a bit.  The more dependable raves 
like Groove Kitchen, Basics, FMM, etc. are pretty much mainstream affairs.  
A lot of people who would normally go to clubs are going to these now.  
This summer, there's been a big push for these multi-day megaparties or 
camping trip/spiritual retreats that seem to be flopping (more or less)
for a variety for reasons.  Tiny Renegade raves are becoming more frequent, 
but so far only exist at the intimate sub-critical mass level of energy.  

But despite not always fitting into some of our more idealized vision of 
the "perfect" rave,  lot's of people seem to be having fun at all of
them.  

I still think there are maybe some good alternatives out there.  
Non-namebrand parties, like Harmony, perhaps Ananda and Fluid, the 
attempted Xochipilli, etc. with lesser known DJs are the ones that might 
continue to attract people who respond less to hype and are more interested 
in giving energy and spirit at a party where each individual can have an 
impact and share in a sense of special togetherness referred to as the 
"vibe".

But let's face it, for many of us, raving isn't so new anymore.  Staying up
all night, driving hours and spending lots of $ for something we've done
many times before may not be worth the risk of a possible letdown.  So 
many of us have become pickier and less willing to take risks.  It'd
be a shame if such people stop going out alltogether, because I think
that with a little foresight, like-minded groups of people will find
the parties that suit their needs.  

The "scene" will continue to evolve, with or without us.  But for those
of us who have gotten a lot out of raving, it would be self-defeating if
we didn't throw our enery into *some* aspect of the scene, whether it's
attending smaller (and growing) renegade parties, or showing up at the 
commercial raves after 4am.  We still have plenty of choices to explore.

I agree with Mike's last comment:
"--FreeLife in San Jose has one of the best vibes and is
consistently one of the best parties around.  Period."

FreeLife is really great.  I cannot believe that they can go off 
past 2 am also. I was there till 2:30 last Monday, and they were 
still going.  The people are all really cool, and there isn't the 
attitude that is there on Friday nights.

	I have the Postscript of our psuedologo (actually

	Any body know where I can get T sirts made with that kool

Mike Romo ponders:
(Why do so many of you hate nitrus?  That stuff is just straight up fun, I
think.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of my faves too, but the reason people have a problem with it and I tend to
agree is that it detracts from the vibe when there are groups of people huddled
around doing balloons.  Kinda anti-social.  If you were to approach one of these
groups or even an individual with a baloon to socialize with, they'd look at you
like you were trying to mooch some nitrous and act generaly suspicious of you.
Then when your kind of anoyed about this, you keep hearing shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhht
to remind you of the presense of the drug that's causing this behaviour.  Then when
you look over to see the source of the noise you see a non-raver who is just there
to make money off of everybody by selling way over priced balloons.  Anyway, the point
is that it's not the drug but the behaviour that surrounds it.

people like to dance to house music, I think this fundamental reality has
established itself.  When I look towards this scene I look towards the music,
and house music is becomming, let's face it, de regeur in most club venues,
which I think is a good thing.  I had a fre
iendly to wonderful time when I first
got involved in this scene and I have no regrets and I'm not going out trying
to relive those experiences - they're gone, and for me, outside of seeing good
friends, they're not so novel.  I mean I love the music but my body put the
brakes on, seeing the sun come up, sure its cool and beautiful, but frankly
when I'm going over 101, it out and out sucks.  Let the scene change, if the
old ingredients don't work, why the hell are we expected to go out and fuel
because this whole thing was originally done for us?
If the scene doesn't want to constantly evolve and change itself, pardon
me on this - like David Bowie, it will grow tired for those who really found
a  whole lot of heart and belief in this.

A FOAF tells me that house.techno.phuture music sounds and feels really
great with NO2, but you have to approach it with a conscious decision
not to let 'nitrous greed' rule the experience.  This FOAF tells me that
if one finds it in oneself to share a balloon that it's almost like moving
to a strange social attractor rather than being isolated in that island
space . . . a very rewarding experience, or so I've heard . . .

Well if you think it is, I think you need to start a new "scene".  Find
something bigger, better, stranger and share it with people.  The completely
dark party sounds interesting, but I think that interactive parties with
more integration of the audience into what is happening in the music and in
the visuals are the real future.  We put on a party like this at our last CD
release and it went off pretty well.  The general feeling of the crowd was
that they had a great time and had all sorts of neat toys to play with.

OK, this weekend features a few low-key events which have a lot of
potential, and a big event which could be cool too...Ananda and All
Gods Children both look like interesting semi-undergrounds and Culture
is for those of you who want to support new talent.

Get Down/Wicked is almost a who's who of local DJs - so everyone should
find something they like there.  I've heard it is supposed to be at
the Richmond Civic Center, so it's pretty close and bust-free.

The weekly list is still pretty healthy, so everyone should have 
something to do all week...and looking ahead, there are plenty of
opportunities for all of you to keep the scene alive!  :)

>   people like to dance to house music,

    I like to dance to just about anything, if it's fast and wierd enough.
    If it's just on the edge of being impossible to dance to, that's best of all.

>   I think this fundamental reality has established itself.
>   When I look towards this scene I look towards the music,
>   and house music is becomming, let's face it, de regeur in most club venues,

    Possibly this scene has outgrown clubs, or at least parts of it have.
    (Not so much in terms of size, but in terms of what we can do there)

>   I love the music but my body put the brakes on,

    That's the strangest part of this.  My body seems to be telling me
    that dancing is fine and lots of dancing is better.  (One must sleep
    some time, though).

>   seeing the sun come up, sure its cool and beautiful...
>   when I'm going over 101, it out and out sucks.  Let the scene change...

    The scene will change, but getting home will still be a challenge.
    Of course, if we do it in the woods, we might not be going home
    over 101.

>   If the scene doesn't want to constantly evolve and change itself...

    I hope that house music continues to be a collage of many different kinds
    of music, though the mix may (and must) change.  The report from Chicago
    suggested that there it was all disco.  I couldn't listen to that for
    very long (or all-any-one-thing for very long, for that matter).

A FOAF tells me that house.techno.phuture music sounds and feels really
great with NO2, but you have to approach it with a conscious decision
not to let 'nitrous greed' rule the experience.  This FOAF tells me that
if one finds it in oneself to share a balloon that it's almost like moving
to a strange social attractor rather than being isolated in that island
space . . . a very rewarding experience, or so I've heard . . .

Ya, I do this all the time ;-).  At home though.  Put some computer on acid
jam, or space music, or Enya or something trippy and it's hella-fun.  You
get so out there somtimes that you start to come down and remember that you
are actualy an inteligence.  Then you remember that you have a body.  Then
you remember your identity.  Then you remember where you are.  Then you
remember what you just did.  Then you do it again.

	Its not all disco yet.....its a mixture of disco, house, and trance - 

     however, disco is now what hardcore was a year ago....a year ago everyone
     had a huge grin on their face during the hardcore sets - now everyone has
     their huge grin during the disco sets - the two forms of music evoke the 

     same reaction.....disco has a deep groove to it though, and soul - 

     something that hardcore (IMHO) lacks......House/disco/trance evokes deep
     rooted emotions and thats something that a dying scene needs - is emotion..

Well if you think it is, I think you need to start a new "scene".  Find
something bigger, better, stranger and share it with people.  The completely
dark party sounds interesting, but I think that interactive parties with
more integration of the audience into what is happening in the music and in
the visuals are the real future.  We put on a party like this at our last CD
release and it went off pretty well.  The general feeling of the crowd was
that they had a great time and had all sorts of neat toys to play with.

Sorry About two posts.....What it all boils down to is this...the party is what 

the people make of it....If they think they will have a shitty time then,
it will be - essentially you get from a party what you put into it....and
I think for alot of us, we expect things now - instead of throwing our hearts
into a party we want to walk into a vibe - not create it - because we know 

what it is, where in the past we did't and that allowed us to add to it because
we wrapped our selves in creating it - not just using it...or something.....

I agree.  I think that this scene has many, many more miles left in it
before it becomes another "statistic".  Yes, there are the more commercial
ventures, but for the most part the people who go to these events
(commercial/ug/weekly/whatnot) are still into it.  And as long as THAT
remians constant (people being into it) it will thrive in one way or
another.

Last year, up until this summer was the GRAND experiment.  Many people
(myslef included), made a consious decision to keep the party to a bare
minimum.  For instance, black light/strobe/visuals.  But some people took
this to the extreme (one black light/one strobe/paintings or slides <that
we've all seen at least 100 times>), and then charged $15 for such a show. 
What once was novel, now became a ripoff (at least IMHO).  Well, rest
assured, the scene does not allow for anyone to stagnate, at least for
long!  Witness this past year if you need proof positive.  

As for vibe, hell, there is as much there as there was in the beginning. 
The difference is the type of vibe.  The smiles are for the most part (I
know, I know, YSH not included :), gone except for the very few, but that
does not mean that people don't like it when they go out.  I think that
people are just more into themselves right now, more than anything....and
when it gets a little colder, things will warm up again.  I also believe
that availablilty of drugs has alot to do with it.  Speed is fucking
rampant, yet E is definitely on the decline (not in terms of want, but in
terms of usage).  I think that as people go towards more organics (like
shrooms) thing will be a bit better.  But I still say that as soon as E
gets back to last years pricing ($10-$20) people will get "normal".  Not
that drugs fuel the scene, but in many way they do (contradiction, no?).

Went to boogie buffet this weekend (twice, by no choice of my own since I
love to be with my kid in the morning when he's rarin' to go!)....I spent
my usual $20 on drinks & left.  Came BACK at 2:30 (had to give a projector,
2 dj's, and Sharon a ride to SJ), and MAN that place was PUMPED.  Now you
talk about smiling MF's!  These people were sweating (it was warm in there)
and fucking going off like there was no tomorrow!  Very cool, and the , uh,
smile factor was high.  Hell, when you're 21+, no party is suiting your
taste, you tend to make the best of it.  But the boogie is still worth most
10-7 a.m. events for sheer banality!
(I have kidded P that it is the home of the exotic dancer revue - this past
weeks dancers were not to be found <except for banana girl>, but keep your
eyes peeled, cuz' they will be back!;)

As for this weekend....ugh!  I will probably go to get down, get ugly since
Markie is gonna spin!  And I havent heard Jeno in a while so I'm lookin
forward to it (for those reasons only, mind you)!  Should be OK since I'll
be tripping, and I like the Richmond space.  Plenty of spaces to hide, and
get high, get ugly.  This weekend will be cracker jack catch-up time.

So how was Your Sisters House?  I didn't go when I heard the advice to
dress warmly (I pretty much guessed where it would be, and a glance
outside didn't look too promising at the time).  I broke my promise
to myself (again) of never missing one. :-(

Had a great time playing old ported apple ][ games on my Mac until 1 am
or so though :-)

(Might and Magic is kinda cool with the Earthbeat comp playing as
background music.  OK I know.  I'm a geek. :-)

Yep, you pretty much guessed the site, which is one of my favorites. Vacant
weedy land by the SF Bay with views of sinister half-used industrial buildings,
and no residents for 100s of yards in any direction.  This time the party was
on a concreate pad which I guess was the floor of a now-demolished building.
Pretty friendly group of people (100 increasing to 200 by the time I left),
 a dozen or so sfraveulars that I know of, not
that I yam one.  The sound system, tho, was too quiet and seemed to get quieter
over time.  I got there a bit past 12, and the first dj (Chrstine ?)was pretty amateurish, choosing songs kind of haphazardly.
and doing bad yet lingering mixes.  The second dj ( Darcy? : Shoban was schedule to be 3rd ) started playing some pretty decent hard trance, I got my nocturnal
aerobics in and left about 2:30.   The 45 minutes of music I heard made up
for the earlier technical flaws and left me feeling pretty satisfied.  I much
prefer outdoors anymore, and the cyberpunk landscape was the shit.

	*i* had a wonderful time! Yes, the cvold was annoying, but all
that really meant was that I couldn't lay down to rest, for then I
would feel cold. I just had to keep on dancing!! I met some wonderful
new people, sfravers, non-sfravers, and I *also* met someone who knows
a friend of mine in *COnnecticut*!@!!!!

I think the location just rocked even tho' the cold was a bit annoying --
it was down a block or so from the previous spot, and the entrance was
through a hole torn in a metal fence.  The street we parked on (if you
could call it a street) had huge piles of freeway dividers and crane
sections and stuff in it, and once you went through the fence you had
to walk for (the equivalent of) two blocks or so through barren, open, 
weedy, gravelly terrain to a concrete space in the middle of the open air,
no buildings *period* for quite a ways around.  To top it off, right as
we got there, there was AC/DC blasting super-loud from a nearby building!
:-) Compared to that noise, there was essentially no evidence of a rave
going on, just a few people hanging out by the hole in the fence.

Yo...

	Does anyone know how good the SoundBlaster 16 ASP and Wave Blaster
boards are for the PC compatibles?  I've put them on order and I'm going
to start to make some music with them, but I'm wondering if I'm going to
have to end up buying software to write the music with or does it come
with some good bundled stuff already?  How does the board sound?  Is the
quality good?  Does it have the "advanced sound processing" like it says
it does, or is it just a gimmik?  Anyone with info let me know....

If you realy want to make "real" music (not computer game music) don't by the
Sound Blaster.  I have one and music is not realy it's intended purpose.  For
about the same price investigate the Roland SCC1, any computer-music store
will probably tell you the same thing.  It's a midi controller that you use
with sequencing software (another $75-$300) to control midi devices and it's
built-in synth has 128 or so voices AND 6 drum sets, including the 808 set.
Also check out the $600 or so Roland TAP 10, which has 2 channels digital
audio.  Or wait, supposedly cheaper and neater things are comming out for the
PC, to make it close to equal with the MAC for music making, but we'll see.

I fail to see the point, Mark. You tell him not to buy a sb16asp+waveblaster
which has an EMU general midi chipset (in the optional waveblaster) cause
music is not the purpose, and then you say go buy an SCC-1, which is almost
the same thing! (a rom wavetable synth)

In his case he wants to make rap music. You dont have any interesting booms and
scratches on the SCC. Also you cannot put new samples or breakbeats on it.
You also cannot use the SCC for techno, trance, hardcore, house, dance,
disco, acid or whatever in these genre cause the included instruments are
General Midi, so you only have for lead synths: square, sawtooth, calliope,
chiff, charang, voice, fifths and bass+lead. For that, you need a sampler
synth card. See below.

> Also check out the $600 or so Roland TAP 10, which has 2 channels digital
> audio.

I would suggest a Gravis Ultrasound with 1Mb, the 16 bit recording daughter-
board and an effect processor. The base Gravis comes with 256Kb RAM and for
about 25$ more you can get it to 1Mb, briging cost to 125+25=150$. The 16 bit
recording board is < 150$. So you still have 300$ to reach the TAP10 and with
that you can buy a great fx processor. It also *includes* Midisoft recording
session for windows and Powerchords for windows (great for techno and rap).

The GUS has 32 pannable channels playable simultaneously of digital wavetable
from a RAM storage plus can play back digital audio from PC memory or hard
disk. It has >85dB SNR, and a frequency response pretty close to flat. It has
much better bass than the SB16. It gives me great flexibility along with my
analog synths and i have 40 Mb of instruments sampled with pro gear that i use
with that, including samples of TR303, TR808, TR909, some analogs, breakbeats
(RunDMC, Rob Base etc...) and also have real instruments, like great piano and
guitars etc... It also supports GM.

> Or wait, supposedly cheaper and neater things are comming out for the

Well, on the MAC you have multi track recorders, but on the IBM too... but
for MIDI sample based music, i cant think of another product short of a
sampler keyboard (the GUS uses the same chip as in the Ensoniq EPS-16+) that
can be used for this purpose, except the GUS.

	The music is stagnating, for one. The releases this year, while
enjoyable, haven't been as innovative as years past, like last year when the
last new style (progressive) of house/techno appeared. Secondly, illegal raves
don't seem to stand much of a chance agaunst the cops these days. The police
have clearly mastered the "MO" (modus operandi, for you non-techies) of rave
promoters. That's why I'm at home tonight, typing this message, instead of
travelling to Cincinnati for Portal, which was supposed to be the first Net
"all-night, electronic music dance w/o alcohol" in the Midwest (2nd in the
nation after Connection?). Four of the last four raves in Cincy have been
busted, which contributed to Portal's cancellation. Lastly, the raves are
still mostly stuck at the level of mere spectacles, like Roman Bacchanalia,
over and over. Since everyone knows about raves, attending one says less and
less about the participants (i.i. you don't need a high UQ, underground
quotient :), to rave).
 
	"All night dancing to electronic music w/o alcohol" (in a friendly
environment and with stimulating aesthetics, I might add) will hopefully and
probably continue in some form though. I just hope that people (maybe WE, on
the Net) can take a small part of the whole scene to a higher level. For
example, it would be great if we could hold a half-day conference on
networking, ... the whole computer underground, followed by "all-night dancing
to electronic music w/o alcohol" that's friendly/stimulating, etc.
 
	To let you know where I'm coming from, the best event I've attended
was thrown by the Black Student Union here on the Univ.of Wis.-Madison campus
in '87. The music, IMHO, wasn't as good as today's finest house, it was basic
and early acid Chicago-style, direct from the windy city. But the event was
amazing for the following reasons: 1. the event was thrown by the BSU, so
attending the event meant that most participants probably supported the
organization-thus a shared perspective/cause; 2. the cost was affordable
(<$10); 3. the venue was completely legal, secure; 4. participants could leave
and return at will (and chat in the QUIET lobby); 5. there was a diverse mix
of people, not just white ravers dressed in the same rave fashions.
 
	Until more of these conditions are met by upcoming raves, I am
curtailing my raving to zero, saving my $$ for YSH and SFRaves gatherings for
when I'm back in SF. Thanks for reading. Please feel free to criticize/give
feedback.

Well get down, get stoopid, get ugly met all of my wildest expectations,
and then some...

The music was by far the ONE to "get down" to!  The sound system in the
main room was quite good, and they did an excellent job of filling that
space up with hella sound.  I was there for the end of Spuns set and
listened primarily  to Josh, who , played a great hard-morning set.  Fuck
the torpedoes, full speed ahead!

But that's when I began to notice the floor was slowly beginning to fill up
again (Spun did CLEAR that floor pretty well), and I noticed that the
stoopid factor had begun to rise in direct proportion to the number of
people returning to the dance floor.  The crowd was a bit young for my
tastes, too eager (the guys esp.) to take off the shirts.  Reminded me of a
high school dance, without the "high" ;)  Nitrous factor was RAMPANT, since
I saw very little E inspired motion, I resigned myself to watching people
get realllly stoopid to the point of passing out, lots of stoopid
tweakers...but this was only the beginning.  Once again, it met ALL my
expectations.

The place was arranged to maximize the sound dispersion.  You all know the
Richmond Center.  In the two hallways they had two seperate sound systems. 
In the foyer, or the usual entrance, they had the Wicked show stoppers. 
And the Main room was the big hall.  I thought that putting the DJ's in a
space (the halls) where there is hella traffick, killed any energy they
might have built up!  The Wicked posse was doing their damdest playing some
of the best music I'd heard them play in a long time....that's when get
ugly got started. Ok, get this, some dude @ 6:30 a.m JUMPS UP ON THE
TURNTABLES AND STARTS SWINGING AT THOMAS!!! :( :( :(  It took the whole
Wicked posse to subdue this asshole and expel him from the hall.  They had
to lock the doors to prevent his sorry ass from coming back in.  @ 7:00
a.m. the party ended.  As I left I saw 6 cop cars, and 5 cops holding some
guy down.  The guy was yelling "I own the world! I am the Earth, I love the
ground!  I am the ground!"  and I quote further "NO!,NO!,NO! I am the
ground, you cannot harm me!  I won the world!  I am the Earth!...."  As I
looked onto this haphazard stoopidity incarnate, he spewed forth gobs, and
gobs of spit, from his mouth, and nose.  Suffice it to say it took about 5
of Richmonds multi-ethnic 285lb gorilla-types to subdue our beloved
asshole.  Come to find out, yes, it is the same guy who was "ejected"
earlier.  They had to use hella clubs to get him down, and they were
waiting for the ambulance to arrive.  It was obvious this asshole, like
sooo many others, forgot NOT to mix his drugs!  He was sooo fucking high, I
doubt it was LSD, probably dust.  Yes indeed, this party EXCEEDED all my
expectations! Could that be the end of Richmond events....only the city
council of Richmond will know...

All in all, an ok (note little "o") party.  Lots of first timers who forgot
what they came there for in the first place.  Lots of 21--, so it should
have satisfied all those folks who never get to go anywhere due to some
stupid curfew, cab laws, whatever. The people, although young (and I doooo
mean young) were friendly enough, not much 'tude.  They were all earnestly
trying to have a good time.  The ulglyness of it all still haunts me (and I
was/am on major psychotropics). So much so I am changing my signature to
reflect how in tune I am with my surroundings;)  I wish assholes did not
show up to events.  I also wish they could control their drug intake.  I
also wish N20 would disappear along with speed since I think that both of
those are MAJOR scenekillers.

Of course I did go to boogie afterwards, caught a cab home, and am
promising myself "if(scene > 500) { void StayHome(void);  }"  Keep America
Beautiful, tweakers stay home!

Until another celestial event...
John 

P.S.  To show my kind and giving spirit, I will be having a small benefit
for the afformentioned tweaker (sometimes tweeker).  Because as they cart
his ugly ass to the asylum, I don't ever want him to think that he's been

Subject: T.A. (Tweekers Anonymous)
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Tweekers Anonymous was founded on August 22,1993 in response to a growing
crisis within our beloved community, that of the unloved, and unwanted
tweeker.  You've seen 'em...they have said things like , and I quote "I own
the world! I am the Earth, I love the ground!  I am the ground!"  and I
quote further "NO!,NO!,NO! I am the ground, you cannot harm me!  I won the
world!  I am the Earth!...." while being held down by 5 policemen.  You can
also identify a tweeker by recurrent incursions with ANY PD, Tweeker
Anonymous member Rodney King to be exact (you DO remember him, his famous
words being "ouch, ow, umph!").  Tweekers can also be idenfied by , uh,
certain characterisics, like having COMPLETE conversations with themselves
whilst walking around a, uh, "rave".  Or sitting in a corner, head in hands
, shaking as though they are trying to dislodge a demon wedged deep within
the crevices of their gulliver (ClockSpeak for head).  Another sure sign of
a tweeker is outdated, overused, ameba-gear worn as if it was created
yesterday.  But be sure the person (hereto referred to as Tweeker) who is
sporting this "retro-rave" look has washed the clothes enough times as to
make the patterns undiscernable.

Tweekers have many unsual characteristics.  Did you know that:
- Tweekers can jump from the ground onto awaiting turntables quicker than
you can say "Tweeker".  Don't try this at home, wait for the next rave and
see how difficult this task can be!
- Tweekers are the essence of multi-tasking.  Asking and answering many of
thier own questions.
- Tweekers, in the true pioneer tradition, go where no person even THINKS
of going.
- Tweekers push all limits when it comes to drug use.  Too little is too
much and, too much is never enough.
- Tweekers are their own shamen, priests, gurus, whatever.  They are
experts at exorcizing their demons upon anyone within an arms, oops, fists
reach!
- Tweekers make great hood ornaments!

It is because of these interesting characteristics that the Tweeker may
suffer isolation in one form or another.  That is where Tweekers Anonymous
comes in, as a friend to all Tweekers and Friends of Tweekers.  The many
services this non-profit provides are:
- Police escorts FROM parties.
- Free Amubulatory services.
- Free straightjackets.
- Free muzzles (in case your Tweeker decides he's Hannibal Lechter or even
worse Jeff Dahmer).
- Free Legal Counseling (beleive me, where the Tweeker goes he'll need
plenty legal assistance).
- Free auto detailing (one of the many uses for a Tweeker once he's been
cured is the honorable job of car detailing.  Nothing intricate mind you,
just vacuming).
- Free Hood Mounting (another good use for the cured tweeker is that of a
Hood Ornament. Makes great dinner conversation).

That's just about all Tweekers Anonymous can do. Usually if you've
identifed someone as a Tweeker it's too late for any preventative measures,
so Tweekers Anonymous is the "automatic backup", to a system that cared a
bit too little, and a bit too late.

Give today!  The Tweeker you save could be your own! (huh?, what, oh yeah,
I get it...okay...huh?  wait...I...own...the...world?..., yeah...huh?)

[John writes a good summary of Get Down etc.]

I was struck by how ... well ... *mainstream* the crowd was, and
suburban, at least in terms of how they dressed.  Esp. in line ...
I was noticing how much I stood out wearing my silly ravish clothing
(baggy overalls, skull cap, etc.).  The craziest thing was this guy
in front of me and my sister in line, who (after eavesdropping on us
talking for awhile) said, "you guys are really interesting ...  you're
like intellectual Grateful Dead types" (?!).  I had this distinct
feeling that he and most of the others there, gawking over the huge
multicolor multipage "Massive Culture" flyers being handed out, were
not in the scene, but had just picked up the flyers and were there
because it seemed like the place to be, kinda like you might see an
ad in the Chronicle for an event that was going on on Halloween or
something and say, "Oh I have to go to that." I guess I should have
known this, but I kept making comparisons to Y.S.H. and noticing how
completely different it all felt.

I also went to Boogie Buffet afterwards -- I've never been there before.
I was struck by how different *that* was, different from either Get
Down or YSH.  I understand now what John means when he talks about
21+ events and Boogie Buffet and such, although I'm not sure I really
like the scene there so much.  It felt very jaded and urban there ...
it really felt like a scene out of a 30's movie, with lots of people
just lounging around acting cool and hip and not really talking to
each other.  A scene that really sticks in my mind is of this girl
Iessa (?), a "Peachy Puff" concessionaire-type that I've seen around
at a number of YSH's, just sitting there at a table by herself looking
forlorn.  Usually at YSH she would be walking around chatting with
people here and there.  (I was also annoyed that the only breakfast
they would serve was pancakes and fruit, but if you knew the manager
you could get eggs, toast, sausage, etc.  This seemed especially
strange seeing as you had to buy breakfast anyway.)

Ben

ps Reading back over this message it sounds awfully negative ...
sorry, it's not meant to be so negative ...  more reflectful than
anything else.

Man, mainstream is too kind.  I think the operative word here Ben is clueless.
Speaking of the Chronicle.  A reporter, digit it, a REPORTER was in Boggie.
 She tried to talk to me and get the dope on what the whole *thing* was
about.  She asked me for my name, of course I don't have one for her.  She
then started asking Jan Cooley (who spun a really GREAT morning set, get it
girl!) questions.  It's not like I don't like reporters.  I just don't like
'em.

Many people feel the same way as you Ben.  Myself Included.  It vasilates
though.  Sometimes it's really good, other times it's really ugly.

I don't know what the fucks up with that shit!  P is coming over later on. 
I'll ask him about it(the breakfast stuff).  I noticed it last week as
well, but didn't know what was up with that.  The cook was VERY defensive. 
I told him to mellow out, then he asked me to leave the kitchen.  Oh well,
the hired help these days.  Hey, if they're gonna give folks eggs and
sausies then it oughta bee for everyone, not just whoever knows the
promoter.  Now it very well could be people bring in their suasies and
eggie-wegs, but I doubt it. As for the cool versus uncool...the "cool"
people are sooo fucked up (read High) that if it weren't for those beanbags
they'd be in sad shape.  The uncool people are the ones who ,could not get
high in the first place, AND could not secure a beanbag :)  The only people
who are into that cool shit are the strippers, and fashion fatales.  Who
cares about them anyway...most of the people who are there are quite
friendly...it's more of a speakeasy than anything else...

Your opinions negative? Hell no!  Your observations are just that.  No need
to put a +/- slant to it.  Hell, sometimes there's good events, sometimes
bad.  Even though Get Down, Get Stoopid, Get Ugly was not my kind of party,
I had a good time.  Got off my face, danced a little, and was very, very
happy I didn't pay to get in.  Most of the people there TRIED to get into
it, and maybe next time they will have a better handle as to what's what. 
The tweeker that I saw will provide many hours of entertainment in the days
to come. And if you can get even a laugh out of a scene then IMHO it ain't
all that bad.  Considering the sloppy summer we've had, a few good laughs
go a long, long way! :)

Later & Peace...
John


P.S.  I read in SPIN about that Massive Culture thang.  To me it's complete
rubbish.  I will not attend that event, comps or no!  Just one more reason
to keep things UG.  BTW, a friend of mine (who does Late Train) talked
very, very, highly about YSH.  I will be at the next one!

Oh yeah, please don't forget to give as much as you can to Tweekers
Anonymous.  A tweeker you know is counting on you! ;)

well, i think ben's right on the mark in his description of this event - the
crowd was VERY mainstream - i felt like i waz at a NJ high school dance! :(
...very few pockets of vibe, altho' i did see a few people dancing their asses
off as if the musick had possessed them, which was nice..... too much of a
markie mark look-alike factor for me there, tho' - i mean, i have no problem
with people taking their shirtz off when they're hot from dancing (i do it),
but it seemed like a lot of posturing to me....

i waz also disappointed in the way the space was set up - didn't like the djs
in the hall - some of the fabbest acid was being played in the hall by the
chill room but it was hard to get into with people passing thru, bumping,
etc....

so this was an experiment for me, in a way - my first west coast large rave...
well, i thought it was definitely better than any large east coast event i'd
been to, but i still don't think i'll be doing another $20 thang for a long
long time, if ever again... the place felt ot me like a bunch of middle class
kids with little sense who blew $20 plus whatever else for chemicalz and
trashed a civic center with pretty-colored, stepped on flyers and lollipop
sticks.... to me, IMHO, that's not what raving's about - to me raving's about
Doing It Yourself/Yourselves, not buying a concert ticket; it's about putting
your cigarette butts in your pocket to throw away later; it's about coming
together to share and dance in, ideally, taken/squatted spaces, or empty
warehouses that you transform into TAZs....a civic center with police roaming
around is the opposite of a TAZ for me - i don't want the state in my face
when the 303 takes over my body....

and $20?!?! i guess i'm still a bit shocked at the prices out here.... i waz
just reading today in charles perry's history of Haight Ashbury how the
diggers actually picketed an event where they thought the promoters were
charging too much ($3.50!).. i'm not going to go that far, but i guess from
now on i'll be boycotting these large things unless maybe it's some kind of
benefit...anyway, i feel like a groundhog scurrying back underground now after
glimpsing at the state of corporate capitalist america.....

wow.... i feel really negative.... i really didn't have an utterly bad time
.... really enjoyed the chill-out room, tho i thought it coulda used a dream
machine....but i guess overall i just feel like an idiot for having gone...:(

I don't think I could have phrased it nicer. This is why I avoided going to
Get Down/Get Wicked last night and instead had a lot of fun hanging with 
friends and torturing them with my mixing. :) Ananda was a fun party on Friday
night (although the mixing was not terribly good...there were a lot of "train
wrecks"...plus I did get accosted by an unsavory group of drunk boys) and what
a nice feeling to have a free renegade thrown purely for the love of music.

Yes, I did stop and think about him.  I thought, "this asshole, who JUMPED
onto turntables, and started swinging at Dj's is getting that karma
returned to his ass, WHOLESALE!".  Compassion?  Yeah...I wanted the cops to
restrain this fuck, and get him the hell outta there before MORE people got
hurt.  My compassion lies with the people who had to witness some dude go
off becuase he could not handle his drugs.  My compassion goes out to the
people who paid $20 for an event that was interrupted by violence caused by
some unknown cracker-jack tweek.  My compassion goes out to everyone who
was even thinking about doing an event @ the Richmond, but now may have to
contend with further vibe-reducing qualities assoc with that space (have
you begun to think HOW the cops may prevent these types of incidents from
happening?  Like more stringent searches :( !!! ).  That Tweeker, IMHO, is
waking up this moment wondering "Hmmm...how did I get these bruises?  I
remember jumping...then I remember the earth...but I can't figure out why
I'm in a straightjacket in this padded room?".  People like this are
ANOTHER reason parties are getting harder to throw.  They (people who don't
like raves), now have another prime example as to why these parties are no
good.  They will not see our beloved Tweeker as an aberration, they will
see him as a prime example, that is usually the way these things work to
kill a scene.  They will also notice the nitrous cannisters thrown
everywhere...yep, compassion...me thinks you should examine the impact
incidents of this type have upon the whole, not just at the individual
level Roy.

If you really feel strongly about this issue I would hope that you give
money to T.A. (Tweekers Anonymous).  Because compassion for the tweeker is
what they are all about...

Later & Peace...
John

  True , however , jsl's comments are colored by what the guy did earlier
 in the evening , which was pretty agro and health-threatening to that
 DJ. I hope he recovers - maybe the club use was restrained (?) . Recovers
mentally and physically. 
 
  Also - it is a person's responsibility to judge what and how much of
 something to put in themselves - and the victims of the crime of
 overindulgence may not just be oneself , but those around .
 
  How do they handle guys like this at rock concerts?

Larry & Roy et. al.,

Club use WAS restrained.  And was quite measured.  They did what they could
to get that dude DOWN.  You see, after he rushed Thomas, and the boys from
Wicked threw his butt out (btw he was FIGHTING all the time), he CHARGED
the door (glass doors folks).  That's when they tried to lock it, and
presumably thats when the cops came (they ARE right across the street). 
This guy was REALLY angry/high and was going to do someone damage (he
already tagged a DJ, fought the boys from Wicked, and now he had to deal
with the authorities). Terrible combo.  He was/is a hazard to the people
around him, so I have NO sympathy whatsoever for his plight.  I am tired of
people not being responsible with their intake of drugs.  If you are NOT
sure of what they will do to you then simply don't take them.  But don't
ingest them and expect everyone to "understand" that you've gone overboard
and caused harm to others.  I understand people having really bad trips,
but this was the worse case yet I've seen.  The other alarming thing is
that this seems to happen all to often at parties of late.  Some goofball
decides that the DJ is the devil or some other supernatural hokus-pokus and
decides perform ritual excorsisms on the spot.  Not healthy at all.

This is another reason why I strongly believe (esp. these days) in some
sort of security being present.

At a rock show (which is where that tweeker thought he was at) they would
have thrown him out, after beating the shit out of him to teach him a
lesson (or so they would think).  So he got MUCH better treatment from cops
than he would have from a rock show security team.  It also helped that the
cops were doing their job in from of many people, so they made sure to take
a completely measured response to this lunatic.  I was VERY happy to see
the cops for once.

All in all I hope he recovers and thinks about his actions.  I hope he
thinks before he takes drugs, and I hope he puts more thought into why he
does them in the first place.  I hope this Tweeker, if he decides to go out
again, is a bit more caring of those around him and tries not to disturb
that which others have tried so hard to build.

Me?  Hell,  NO MORE MASSIVES!!!!

BCNU,
John

Yea!!  That was most unfortunate,   because when Carlos started spinning
in the hallway,  it was practically impossible to pass through the hall
because of all his worshipers and fans.  WOW!!  He sure had them hopping.
Why didn't they put Carlos in the main hallway??

Later on,  one of Carlos' partners came up to me and said "I like your
dance style"  WOW!!  But I never danced until just recently...   But I like
doing my OWN THANG!! and getting creative,  and letting the music dictate
my movements.

Just curious how old the "Tweeker" bozo was that jumped on the turn-tables
and what drugs he was on.

>i have no problem
>with people taking their shirtz off when they're hot from dancing (i do it),
>but it seemed like a lot of posturing to me....

WELL!  I have to admit,  until they started upening up the doors in the main
entrance way,  that was the ONLY way to cool off.    I learned early on,  to
either bring an extra shirt,  or not wear it when dancing.    Nothing I hate
worse than that is to be wearing a wet tee-shirt when it's over.   

All in All,  Wicked was totally awsome,  and I had a GREAT time,  and a chance
to dance to some DJ's I never had an opportumity to before.

For those that expected me at Boogie Buffet,  we got there,  but my friends
girl friend lost her ID,  and they raised the cover charge to $5 instead of
the usual $4,  which meant that one of us couldn't get in,  so we collectivly
decided to bag it.    Soory about not showing up to those that were expecting
us.

I eventually went home,   had so much energy left that I wound up hiking in
the woods for 4 - 5 hours afterwords to chill down.

Till Penalepe's Web...

Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  Large raves *can* be
amazingly fantastic.  There's a Basics on Spetember 4th and Vision on
September 11th.  My predictions: of the two, one will be near the city
and one will be far away.  The one near the city will be lame, and the
faraway one will be a lot of fun.

On Friday, when my friend and I were leaving Mission Rock, we were
robbed in the parking lot by at least two men who claimed they
had guns.

It happened at about 3am, before the club had closed.  My friend
and I had gotten into my car and were about to leave when the 
thieves opened the car doors and asked if we had any money, then
said we had better give them our money or we would be shot.  They
took our wallets and told us to go away, so we drove off and went to
the police station.   (both of us were OK, just a little rattled)

We had been parked about 10-15 cars north of the building, on the
same side of the road as the club.  While walking to my car, we
saw a bunch of people around a couple of cars which were parked
in the road (blocking in some parked cars) and blasting music;
I would guess that our attackers came from that 'gang', but I'm
not sure.  Anyway, when I went back to Mission Rock the next
afternoon to look for the wallets, I talked to the bartender and
he said that they have been having problems with a group of
people who park out in the lot late on Friday and Saturday
nights and cause trouble; also someone else told me they tried
to enter the club one night, and they've tried to start fights.

So the bartender's advice was to park on the south side of the
building, preferably where it's lit.  I don't want to discourage
people from going, 'cause the music was great, and many other 
venues are probably just as dangerous, but be careful there and
anywhere else you go; San Francisco is becoming a more dangerous
place and some caution is always worthwhile.

Your humble reporter experienced the following this past weekend in SF:

On Friday night, I checked out Corduroy City for a couple of hours.  I
arrived just after 1AM, and the place was going off, and kept going off
the entire time I was there.  I listened to two DJs.  I didn't catch the
first DJ's name, but she played a fine house set.  The second DJ, who, I'm
told, was John Williams, played acid house, progressed into acid, and
moved into Chicago & Progressive house. The visuals were outstanding--they
had a video projector with lots of great graphics going through interesting
transformations.  The place was packed, the sound system was an 8' high
6 speaker stacks, the smile factor was high, and the price was reasonable
US$7.

I then wandered out to the Ananda location, since it was advertised as
a late starter.  True to my form, I arrived just as the sound system
got going.  The location was outstanding, providing free visuals, lots
of cool air (I found I had overdressed for the occasion, which is rare
for me for outdoor night events).  It seemed to take the DJs about 30-45
minutes to settle down, but once we all settled down, things seemed to
flow much better.  The SFR posse was in full effect.  I also finally
got to hear the much talked about Goa Gil in person.  The smile factor
seemed fairly high.  The event was marred mostly when a woman friend 
was harassed by some guys...yuck! 

Saturday, I visited with some friends, thought about going to Get Wicked,
circumstances changed, and I went to All God's Children.  Unfortunately,
the event never really went off for me.  Also, the space was busted at
about 4-4:30.  Major bummer, since the space has been a friendly home
to some fine events.  The smile factor was fairly low, the dance factor
for most people was high, all in all, a so-so event.

Sunday, I visited the newly formed (I guess) Ambient Night, downstairs
at Spike's.  Oops. Big mistake.  The place is a [very] small cavern
tucked under Spike's on 8th Street in SF.  Half the room seems to be
taken up with the bar (*yawn*), cover is $2, half the room is in 
near darkness.  The sound people were using lighters to see their
equipment.  The visuals were boring. There were sporadic attempts
at digeridoo playing. The sound was mostly not ambient.  We were
subjected to a version of "The Girl from Ipanema" mixed with ocean
sounds at one point.  I like the song...just not in a supposedly
"ambient" context.  My advice: save your money, save your time.  This
one is not yet ready for prime time.

John, think again.  Your haste to mete out justice without necessarily
having all the facts may be emotionally satisfying, but does it really
deal with the situation as you saw it?  For example, suppose somebody
like that was dosed without his knowledge.  It could happen -- I've seen
it.  Suppose somebody then freaked and started acting out whatever
happened to be at the surface of their consciousness at that moment --
latent hostility, whatever.  It could happen -- I've seen it.  And
suppose then that the local gendarmerie or security bozos or whatever
started beating the shit out of the guy because they had no training
in how to deal with problems of violence except with counter-violence?
It could happen.  And I've seen it.

Jumping to conclusions is the wrong thing to do.  If you're in a situation
where you have to deal with something like this, of course you have to
react.  I am glad when the security people at parties respond to these
things, but I get upset when I see the usual brute-force approach when
they haven't tried anything else, mostly because they've never had the
appropriate training -- much of which really gets down to following the
Golden Rule, and distracting the subject's attention so they can get
out of their stress-loop and start acting a little more rationally.
Of course, there are situations where this won't work.  Of course.
And sometimes you just have to tackle someone to deal with their
problems.  But why *start* there, especially when the inappropriate
use of force can cause the problem to escalate out of control?

If someone is tweaking on acid, that's one thing; if they're flying on
crystal or ice that's another; if they're simply dumber-than-fuck drunk
that's yet another.  The symptoms may seem fairly similar -- aggressive,
loud, even violent behavior.  The wrong diagnosis or worse, no diagnosis
can cause a lot of damage and wreck the vibe for everyone, as this
incident did for you . . . 

A few months ago BrianB was collecting ideas to bring up at the Monday
planning meetings, and I wrote a long thing about improving the security/
safety/door situation.  What you witnessed is exactly the kind of
situation I was concerned about.  

These kinds of disruptions are undesirable and nobody likes them.  But
before drawing any conclusions about who "they" are who are having all
these problems and disrupting parties and other events, and about what
should be done to "them", and what groups "they" supposedly represent,
let's think a bit about why this stuff happens at all, and the best way
to respond.  Seems to me that acknowledging the human qualities we all
share is a good place to start.  We all have The Beast Inside, and with
some folks it seems like that's the only thing there . . . but I've found
that except for the truly psychotic (who are thankfully very rare), you
can always find some common ground to deal with someone.  

Is the self-satisfaction of the bystander at rough justice being carried
out worth the risk that someone's life will be ruined or even lost?

(1) Friday: Someone posted about "time warp" on friday night. Lacking
better things to do, and given the fact that the other friday night choice
(Mission Rock) was vetoed on the grounds of "bad vibe" by my S.O., and
given the fact that Ananda kept on delaying the starting time of their
event; we decided to check "time warp" out. (note that the plan was just to
do a few hours of dancercise, as opposed to going for an all-night massive
rave extravaganza).

| Subject: Time Warp tonight ...
| Sez it's a promotional event for a new location for San Francisco's undergroud
| scene. Four live acts "Alphabet Soup, Last to Serve, Universal Joint, High
| Gain", DJ's Thomas, Skinny Ribs, Daemon, Pause, Pete, Leanne, and Jestr.
| Live music starts at 9:00pm. 415-469-6976. Hyde and Sutter?!
| Flyer states it's Invite Only Please.

So we "crash" the party, pay our $10.00/person, and walk in. The place is
very interesting -- looks like an old hotel lobby and dining area. Plush in
a dated kind of way. Upstairs there was a large stage/hall with live
hip-hop acts, plus DJ'd hip-hop music; downstairs they had some pool
tables, a chill out room, and a small room with DJ'd dance music. We got
there around midnight or so, which means that the best live acts had
already played.  So we spent most of our time in the small dance room. Good
vibe, friendly people running the event, free water, etc. One DJ hauled out
alot of old rare-groove dance numbers that were fun to funk to;
unfortunately, she didn't really know how to mix; later, a different DJ
pulled out the techno groove and got the (small) crowd pumping. Didn't
recognize any of the DJ's I saw....

Even though there were a few of gangsta-looking hip-hoppers upstairs,
positive respect was given and taken by all involved.  The upstairs area
was low-vibe by rave standards, but pretty good by hip-hop standards,
especially given the fact that it is oh-so fashionable to front a
hard/mean/sullen/angry pose in the hip hop milieu; also, the music upstairs
was a bit too slow to dance too. Music to bounce yer car to, but not your
body. So we spent most of our time dancing in the downstairs area.

I asked the people in charge whether there would be more events like this
and they said "call the number". It probably won't be a weekly.

- --------------------

(2) Saturday: blew off "Get Down Get Stupid Get Wicked" so's I could
hang out w/ my bro-in-law and sister visiting from NYC, and gather
up the appropriate sleep for....

- --------------------

(3) Sunday morning: Boogie Buffet 10:30AM-2:30PM. Well, this just wasn't as
massive as the one I attended two weeks ago (the
post-wicked-at-174-king-st-boogie-buffet). The idea was to show my sister
(a musician/composer visiting from NYC) what the scene in SF was like
without keeping her up all night in uncomfortable, sweaty, ugly,
rave-venues, filled with frothing-at-the-mouth-cuz-i-took-too-much-speed-
shirtless-male-hunter-gatherers.

Well, S.O., sister, and I had fun, but the DJing in the "sunlight" room was
nowhere near as good as it had been the previous time. I was hoping for the
massive epic dubwise rare groove disco extravaganza that I had witnessed
the previous time, but it just didn't quite materialize.  (Perhaps there
was something in the water the previous time :-)).  Overall, however,
it was fun for the whole family.

In the sunlight room, the female DJ (Jan Cooley, perhaps) that was on
earlier just didn't turn my crank -- a bit too discoey in a boring sort of
way. Later a different DJ came on (who was that?) and improved things
somewhat.  Particularly missing was the fine mixing that I had seen in
previous times.  Instead, there were plenty of times when the music
stopped, then another record was slammed in. Perhaps I was just being
overcritical and oversensitive because I was "showing off" the scene to my
sister, and was hoping that the scene, the DJing, and the music come off as
epic and overwhelming. Also, the sound system in the "daylight" room was
just a tad too loud (verging on distortion) in the midrange, while the bass
was not as earth-shaking.

Meanwhile, Spun was in the "dark" room spinning up a jungular tribal rhythm
storm. A good amount of time was spent there because the music was real
real nice.

Saw a handful of sfravers there, met a few new faces too....

In either case we're all going back there next sunday, and hopefully,
we'll even manage to get my sister's husband to emerge from the recording
studio and have some fun with us.

Re: the prev. conversations about breakfast and entrance price at Boogie
Buffet. $5.00 entry fee -- no complaints out of me -- a very good value for
the money. The $2.00 pancake and fruit breakfast -- also a good value, and
I don't need no steenking eggs and sausages! It was just enough food/sugar
to get me dancing. Nice new feature: espresso/cappucino! Yum yum. Caffeine
rules! Security -- present, pleasant, helpful, friendly. Overall, a very
well-done event.

re: Corduroy City

should have been $5... hope you didn't overpay!
Your first DJ was Jan Cooley, who did indeed spin a great set.
She spun a song that I've only heard twice-- both times it was her.  An
intense acid-harmonica groove, with the harmonica riff coming from a The The
song whose name currently escapes me.  Anyone?

} 
} (1) Friday: Someone posted about "time warp" on friday night. Lacking
} better things to do, and given the fact that the other friday night choice
} (Mission Rock) was vetoed on the grounds of "bad vibe" by my S.O., and
} given the fact that Ananda kept on delaying the starting time of their
} event; we decided to check "time warp" out. (note that the plan was just to
} do a few hours of dancercise, as opposed to going for an all-night massive
} rave extravaganza).
} 
} | Subject: Time Warp tonight ...
} | Sez it's a promotional event for a new location for San Francisco's undergroud
} | scene. Four live acts "Alphabet Soup, Last to Serve, Universal Joint, High
} | Gain", DJ's Thomas, Skinny Ribs, Daemon, Pause, Pete, Leanne, and Jestr.
} | Live music starts at 9:00pm. 415-469-6976. Hyde and Sutter?!
} | Flyer states it's Invite Only Please.
} 
} So we "crash" the party, pay our $10.00/person, and walk in. The place is
} very interesting -- looks like an old hotel lobby and dining area. Plush in
} a dated kind of way. Upstairs there was a large stage/hall with live
} hip-hop acts, plus DJ'd hip-hop music; downstairs they had some pool
} tables, a chill out room, and a small room with DJ'd dance music. We got
} there around midnight or so, which means that the best live acts had
} already played.  So we spent most of our time in the small dance room. Good
} vibe, friendly people running the event, free water, etc. One DJ hauled out
} alot of old rare-groove dance numbers that were fun to funk to;
} unfortunately, she didn't really know how to mix; later, a different DJ
} pulled out the techno groove and got the (small) crowd pumping. Didn't
} recognize any of the DJ's I saw....
} 
} Even though there were a few of gangsta-looking hip-hoppers upstairs,
} positive respect was given and taken by all involved.  The upstairs area
} was low-vibe by rave standards, but pretty good by hip-hop standards,
} especially given the fact that it is oh-so fashionable to front a
} hard/mean/sullen/angry pose in the hip hop milieu; also, the music upstairs
} was a bit too slow to dance too. Music to bounce yer car to, but not your
} body. So we spent most of our time dancing in the downstairs area.
} 
} I asked the people in charge whether there would be more events like this
} and they said "call the number". It probably won't be a weekly.
} 
} - --------------------
} 
} (2) Saturday: blew off "Get Down Get Stupid Get Wicked" so's I could
} hang out w/ my bro-in-law and sister visiting from NYC, and gather
} up the appropriate sleep for....
} 
} - --------------------
} 
} (3) Sunday morning: Boogie Buffet 10:30AM-2:30PM. Well, this just wasn't as
} massive as the one I attended two weeks ago (the
} post-wicked-at-174-king-st-boogie-buffet). The idea was to show my sister
} (a musician/composer visiting from NYC) what the scene in SF was like
} without keeping her up all night in uncomfortable, sweaty, ugly,
} rave-venues, filled with frothing-at-the-mouth-cuz-i-took-too-much-speed-
} shirtless-male-hunter-gatherers.
} 
} Well, S.O., sister, and I had fun, but the DJing in the "sunlight" room was
} nowhere near as good as it had been the previous time. I was hoping for the
} massive epic dubwise rare groove disco extravaganza that I had witnessed
} the previous time, but it just didn't quite materialize.  (Perhaps there
} was something in the water the previous time :-)).  Overall, however,
} it was fun for the whole family.
} 
} In the sunlight room, the female DJ (Jan Cooley, perhaps) that was on
} earlier just didn't turn my crank -- a bit too discoey in a boring sort of
} way. Later a different DJ came on (who was that?) and improved things
} somewhat.  Particularly missing was the fine mixing that I had seen in
} previous times.  Instead, there were plenty of times when the music
} stopped, then another record was slammed in. Perhaps I was just being
} overcritical and oversensitive because I was "showing off" the scene to my
} sister, and was hoping that the scene, the DJing, and the music come off as
} epic and overwhelming. Also, the sound system in the "daylight" room was
} just a tad too loud (verging on distortion) in the midrange, while the bass
} was not as earth-shaking.
} 
} Meanwhile, Spun was in the "dark" room spinning up a jungular tribal rhythm
} storm. A good amount of time was spent there because the music was real
} real nice.
} 
} Saw a handful of sfravers there, met a few new faces too....
} 
} In either case we're all going back there next sunday, and hopefully,
} we'll even manage to get my sister's husband to emerge from the recording
} studio and have some fun with us.
} 
} Re: the prev. conversations about breakfast and entrance price at Boogie
} Buffet. $5.00 entry fee -- no complaints out of me -- a very good value for
} the money. The $2.00 pancake and fruit breakfast -- also a good value, and

} to get me dancing. Nice new feature: espresso/cappucino! Yum yum. Caffeine

In the first place I do not know whether or not he ingested willfully or
no.  I DO know that he jumped on turntables and took a swing, and hit a dj.
 His reasons?  Who knows...I can't speak for his motives, I can only adress
his actions which is exactly what I've done.  That DOSING-FOR-FUN stuff has
been done before.  But the way in WHICH he was acting made it seem as
though he was suffering from soem form of delusional dimentia.  Now if he
had been dosed with very strong LSD, I doubt he would gain SUPER HUMAN
strength.  Your space and time becomes highly distorted under LSD
delusions.  Rare is the case (that I know of, and I've read much from the
AHF about this so...) of somone becoming very violent from LSD. 
Delusional? Yes...many might see demons and RUN for cover.  This guy was
out for blood...that was quite evident.  He could have been on dust or
speed. which in this scene is quite probable.  If it took 5 cops to
restrain his butt (and it did), and he continued fighting it leads me to
belive he was on some type of amped up mode.  He was frothing at the mouth.
 Yes that can happen with LSD, but it also happens with dust.  As for who
did what...this is not my concern...since I may not ever know the answer to
that question I concern myself with the immediate...was he endangering
himself AND others?:YES. If left alone would he harm others?:YES.  Did he
have to be removed?:YES.

As for your second point you create a scenario:
> And
>suppose then that the local gendarmerie or security bozos or whatever
>started beating the shit out of the guy because they had no training
>in how to deal with problems of violence except with counter-violence?
>It could happen.  And I've seen it.

This is a moot point since it did not happen.  Roy asked how he would have
been handled by the "rock & roll" security types found at rock concerts.  I
said, and rightfully so, that he received better treatment than he would at
rock shows.  Anyone who has been tossed on their ass by one of those rock
show sec. forces knows what I am talking about.  But since nobody beat the
shit out of him, and since he was removed by force, first by Wicked then by
the cops, I am satisfied (esp since nobody else was hurt by this fool).  If
I, would a, should a, could a, does not apply.  So I dare not conjecture
about this.

Fred, were you there?  This guy was hitting Thomas, what do you want to do
sit him down over a nice cup of tea and reason with him.  Is that after
he's caused damage or not?  We simply don't agree with each other.  He was
tossed out.  Locked out.  The authorities restrained him.  And IMO they
were justified in the removal of this tweeker.  All else is legalese and
has NOTHING to do with justice being served.  He was a threat to others.
Who else has to be punched before he is removed?

I agree.  But I do make some distinctions.  "They" are people who come to a
party just to cause trouble.  "They & them" are those who are not careful
as to how they act around others.  "They" are those who intentionally ruin
a vibe for everyone.  "They" are those who don't know how to take drugs. 
And as far as I am concerned, "they" have no business at ANY party. "They"
are the vibekillers, the scenekillers.  And "they" can stay home.

Fred, the other thing you must remeber is that in order to find common
ground people have to first agree to do so.  If they do not, one side has
one agenda while the other has a different one.  It takes two to do the do,
otherwise you end up talking to yourself.
  

>Is the self-satisfaction of the bystander at rough justice being carried
>out worth the risk that someone's life will be ruined or even lost?

Self-satisfaction at rough justice?  Well, YES (since there was no rough
justice, just a rough removal ;).  I was QUITE satisfied that they removed
him from the premesis.  I was quite satisfied that Thomas was OK.  I was
quite satisfied that the boys from Wicked removed him without trying to
hurt him.  I was quite satisfied that the cops removed him so that he would
be no further threat to others.  The only thing that was runied was a good
time for the people.  He will pay the bail, and get out.  If he has a prior
and is on probation then rough.  His life is far from over, unless he wants
it to be.  Yes, I was quite satisfied Fred.

To cap it off...I am NOT a legalist.  I am interested not in revenge, but
in justice.  This society has become quite interested in the splitting of
hairs when it comes to this.  If someone is a threat, they must be removed,
once it has been proven that they are a threat.  If someone punches a
anybody at a party, if someone does not respect the rights of others to
enjoy themselves, if someone wants to harass people, then IMO they cannot
be reasoned with.  They must be ejected, and we can talk OUTSIDE the event
if necessary.  Anything else, in these situations puts everyone at risk,
and is not fair to the society as a whole.  Sometimes, and note, SOMETIMES,
the need of the many outweigh the needs of a few or the one.  This dude was
the one, and he needed to be locked up.

No more TWEEKERS,
Peace...
John

Ahem, as a veteran of the SF -> Seattle route, and as a person who
just drove to Eugene this weekend, 8 hours is wrong.  I'd estimate a
minimum of 10 hours.  Eugene one way from SF proper is 520 miles, and
Portland is 105 miles farther from Eugene... so that's 625 miles, and
you've got Mt Shasta, Siskiyou (sp?) Summit and four smaller passes in
Oregon.  With traffic, it took me 11 hours to drive up to Eugene, and
without traffic, it took 8 hours to return.  And I drive fast, though
maybe not as fast as this poster :-)

Sorry about the time inaccuracy.  It's been a few months since I've
made the drive.  Last time I made the drive down we went only as far
as San Jose to see Donovan and Spun.  I tried to recollect when we
left, arrived, etc.  I guess I recollected wrong :-) Ah well, tis par
for the course this week it seems!

So you came up for The Dead eh?  Not a bad show if I do say so myself.
We did a free show Sat.  night about 40 mi.  east of Portland, then we
all drove down to Eugene on Sunday.  A very fun if tiring weekend.
The energy at our show left us in such a good mood we hardly felt
tired though!

Do you come up this way often?

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


Sometime during the weekend, Clio's, a coffee shop on Lower Haight in
SF, was broken into and their two tables, mixer, amp, and speakers
were stolen.

Clio is asking for anyone's help in finding a new set of all the above
pieces of equipment for sale at a reasonable price.  Clio's is the
unofficial practice headquarters and meeting place, and indeed the
only place available to several of YSH's women for practice in
spinning; Clio makes her tables available to newer DJ's, especially
women, and lets some of them store equipment and records there.

Maybe those of us who support the ideas (and the fun) behind YSH
can help her replace the stolen equipment!  If you can or have a lead
on something, please respond by calling her directly at 252-7912
or e-mail me here:

Subject: Penelope's Web update....
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


Just spoke to the promoter, Melissa, whom many of you all know, of
the Penelope's Web party that happened up in the mountains near
Willits, CA.

The latest is that the second Penelope's Web has been postponed
3 or 4 weeks from this weekend when it was originally going to happen.

One main issue here has been the projected cost, considering the
additional fees for the site up in Willits.  She is determined
to keep the cost down, still doesn't have a firm figure, but
she has found one relatively painless way to cut costs.

It turns out that one of the major costs was the rental of the
shuttle vans (to keep the cars off of the land) and the gas
expenses involved in running the van constantly the 13 or
so miles between the map point and the site.  Instead, she
will have people at the map pt asking people to wait up to
1/2 hour for the next trip when enough people have arrived.

Well at Get Down/Wicked, I had just about the best time I've ever had
at a rave. Why?

After being to a lot of small events, I was ready for a big thousands
of people multimedia blowout event. And this was. The crowd was a bit
weird, not that ravey really, but I found plenty of people to share a
good vibe with.

The sound system was done *right*. At the Come/Unity and Unity events
I went to in Richmond, the speaker placement was awful. The walls
resonated out of time with the music, and interference from speakers
across the room dulled the sound and made it confusing. At gdgdgdw,
the sound wasn't quite as loud but very clear and enjoyable to listen
to.

There were five (count them) DJ's going all night. One in each lower
hallway, one in the main room, one in the back room by the stairs, and
one in the ambient room + dubtribe. If the music wasn't getting it,
just walk 75 feet :).

The real story of the night was Carlos! You have to imagine a the
regular Carlos vibe, and then imagine a hall packed with crazy dancing
people, and a huge crowd-DJ synergy. I was grinning so hard I nearly
broke my face :). I have never in my 25-30 odd events experienced such
an incredible vibe. Hats off to Carlos, who can totally go off on
scratching/tweaking the mixing board, and it sounds *good*.

Bad news: They confiscated my water. To return the favor, at the pay
point, I berated the promoter for a good solid three minutes,
explaining how that wasn't in the spirit or rave, how it was
irresponsible, etc. etc. and how neither me or my friends will attend
another event by them if they insist on these tactics. I think he
actually listened.

So all in all, a somewhat weird unravey crowd (they can't all be), but
some really good vibes available if you looked. A _Fantastic_ ambient
room. And of course, really great sfraver friends.

I don't want all events to be like this. But I want *some* events to
be like this because I like it once in a while.

See you Thursday,

Sean

>Thankfully, the real world is still utterly clueless:

    (Astroboy, a Tuesday morning greeting) 

Well Astroboy, three things are evident from your remarks:
    1) you regard yourself as outside the real world.
    2) you think you have a clue
    3) you want the world to remain in this perceived state

The first two reek of narcissism, ego, and pretension, but 
the third observation is the most destructive for it 
violently contradicts the rave vision. The truth is that for 
the spirit of rave (of which peace and unity are only two of 
the many dimensions) to gather the power needed to begin 
transforming the ugly features of this world, we must not 
place ourselves on a raised plateau over the "cluelss" real 
world as you have childishly done, but to work together and 
within it because we are part of this real world.  Raving is 
not about gathering togehter to praise one another and 
comment contemptiously on those who differ, but to create 
and nuture a spirit of understanding, tolerance and joy, and 
then share this spirit unselfishly with everybody.  
Self-centered people such as yourself thwart these efforts.  
My recommendation is to keep your diseased spirit away from 
the scene until you tap into some love and harmony within 
your being, then return to continue the process of healing 
(individual and communal healing) and become a positive 
force at the raves and in the world you share.

Why then did you launch this totally unwarranted personal attack
on Astroboy?

The bald hypocrisy contained in your attack article astounds me.
Is it OK to be nasty and condescending as long as you're
endorsing Peace And Love (TM)?

If this is your idea healing and "positive force", I don't want
any.

	With that much bandwidth, you can easily run X11, transfer

	(not including ISDN charges which should run you about $50 per

	of a 14.4kbs modem for so little?

	Oh don't worry we have plenty of bandwidth, this is coming to

plenty o' space, washer 'n' dryer, roof/net access, etc., and the location
is way cool, near lots of cafes and bookstores and all.  My brother 
(Ben Wing) and I will be living there along with another friend who
raves too and is (like us) a somewhat directionless college grad slacker.  
Rent is $400/mo.  Call us at 621-5766 for more info.

this before!  So this is a repeat performace for him.  Therefore his intent

I'm not disputing your description of the facts, John, or the necessity
of physically restraining someone who is clearly out of control.  But
there are good ways to do that, and hard ways.  Trouble is, the good
ways take training and common sense, and it's all to easy to succumb to
the feeling that someone got what they 'deserved' without knowing all
the facts.  Again, my caution is based on my guiding principle from the
GD scene -- believe half of what you see and none of what you hear
(at least in the sense of automatic belief).  

The bigger question for me in this incident is to what extent it represents
a change in the nature of the scene, or at least one part of it.

I would be most interested in learning how to use this stuff, but I
 am wondering if whoever was going to teach a tutorial on it is still
 going to do so?  If I remember correctly it was John Draper?  Did this
 already happen?  If not, is there any likelihood of it happening?

	Yeah, do it. I suggest that you get pgp from an ftp site (use
archie to find one.) and read the docs.
	John: what specifically were you doing with PGP? I've been
thinking that bringing a laptop to a small event such as YSH would be
a good idea, but a larger event I don't think would be as useful.
(That's my impression of things.)
	Anyone have a laptop they wanna spare and talk to the
YSH-folk?

Well, after composing my reply to this message, i realized that it's
really rather long, so i thought an executive sumarry would be in
order:

Hmmm... i'd like to say that you shouldn't trust a key that you;ve got
from the net (unless, of course, it's certified by someone you trust.)
You should generally exchange keys in person, on floppy disk, or
verify them over the phone using an MD5.... see the PGP manual for
more details...  there's also a nifty way of exchanging keys by
business card, provided you have email access (see below)

Security is hard work... but if you're going to do it at all, you have
to do it properly...

So, if you're interested, read on...

---------

Well, here's my original reply....

Check out the facility to produice an MD5 of your key.  You can put
this on a business card, along with your email address, and then you
can give people you meet your card.  They email you for you key, and
check the MD5 against the one on the card...

it's equivalent to printing your key on your card, except that it's
shorter.

Oh, and make sure you keep an exact copy of the key that you did the
MD5 of... 'cos if you add new signatures to your key, its MD5 will
change.  This ins't a problem, as long as you keep the one you used to
generate the MD5, since you can send this to people, and then, once
they're satisfied with it, you can send them an up-to-date key and PGP
will merge the signatures into their keyring.


I should also point out that if you're doing this properly, you
shouldn't ever trust a key that you see on a mailing list.  Someone
could have tampered with it so they can impersonate Bob.  Imagine that
there's a system manager at Oracle who doesn';t like the idea of Bob
receiving mail he can't spy on.  (Please, this is just fictional, i
wouldn't for one moment suggest that Oracle would really do this.)

So what this sysman does is he creates his own PGP key, and
substitutes this for the one in Bob's mail.  Whenever anyone sends Bob
mail, they'll inadvertently encrypt it using the sysman's key instead
of Bob's key.  The system manager has set up a demon to recognize pgp
messages, decode them, and print them out.  But here's the clever
bit... his demon then encrypts the message with Bob's real key (which
the sysman got from bob's mail), and passes it on....  so Bob doesn't
know that anything is wrong.

Provided that all Bob's PGP messages and keys go through the Oracle
mail system, the sysman could maintain this indefinitely, and no-one
would be able to tell...

What's more, the sysman could pose as Bob, by signing fake messages
using his own key... since as far as the rest of the world is
concerned, this *is* Bob's key.....

There are three obvious ways in which the sysman's game might be
discovered, even if the sysman makes no mistakes.... the first is, if
Bob manages to give someone his *real* key to someone, eg on a floppy,
and someone becomes suspicoous, either because they can;t veroify
bob's signatures (the sysman has substituited his own) or because he
ends up with 2 different ekys for bob on his keyring.

The second possibility is if someone gives Bob a PGP-encrypted file on
a floppy (encrypted, of course, with the sysman's key) and Bob will
find he's unable to read it, which might make him suppicious (though
of course the file could simply have been corrupted).  

The third possibility is that Bob signs something (a key, a messsage)
and gives it to someone on a floppy.  Now, to the outside world, the
signature won't verify....

But you can see that it might take quite a while for one of these
scenarios to happen, and for you to become convinced that this has
really happened to you... (your first reaction would be the file is
corrupted, right... i mean no one is *really* going to be spying on
you...)

Ok... second problem... if you're running on a unix machine, you;'ve
got problems that other processes might be spying on what you're
doing... this is a problem with any multitasking machine....  you
*have* to trust anyone who can get root access to your machine, since
they can monitor *anything* that goes on.  So they don;t need to do
anything clever with keys... they can just monitor your PGP session,
and keep copies of the plaintext.  In practice, security is less than
perfect on most multi-user machines, so you have to trust everyone who
has access to the machine...

Ok, solution: you need to run on single-tasking machine, eg a DOS
machine, unless you trust everyone who uses the unix machine.

Even so, if you keep your copy of PGP on your hard disk, you don't
know that it hasn't been tampered with (eg to keep a copy of the
messages, or to substitute someone elses key for yours) so you need to
carry your own copy of the DOS PGP on floppy.  Of course, someone
could have tampered with the DOS on this machine, too... put a virus
on it, or somehow tweaked it so that it notices when you try to run
PGP...  This is no problem, though... just make sure your PGP disk is
a bootable DOS disk (ie do a format /s), then copy PGP onto it and
write protect the floppy....  Never run PGP except when you;ve booted
from this floppy....

Hmm.... what am i saying here....?  Secuirty is hard work... but if
you want to practice playing with secure mail, you may as well do it
properly.  I mean, if no one's out to get you, then you don't need PGP
in the first place... and if *they* really are out to get you, then
you *need* to do it properly....

Besides, it gives you the satisfaction of knowing that you *really
are* sending messages that the NSA, with all their resources *really
can't read*.

(Well, actually, if they really want the information, they'll just
kidnap you, and torture you, and get you to divulge your pass phrase,
but if they do that, then they must want your data real bad...)

Well, you never can tell... PGP uses IDEA, which *seems* 'unbreakable'
(which means that it would take so long to crack it that the info owuld
probably be worthless at that point), but the NSA really shouldn't be
underestimated on this... and they neither confirm or deny that the can
crack anything... but I would trust IDEA before I would trust DES. As far
as if they can break it... that can have less to do with the algorithm used
and more to do with the passphrase. Doesn't matter if you use something you
know for a fact is unbreakable (which cannot happen anyway), if someone can
guess your passphrase, they can read your message with ease. Which brings
me to something Roy left out of his otherwise pretty complete post-
password security. Your private key should be not only kept secure, but has
to be hard to guess, too. What this means depends on who you ask, but the
generally paranoid will pick one with at least 12 letters of both upper and
lower case, matbe with some non-letters (Like $$%!#@+~) in them, that is
not found in or derivable from and dictionary. This of course makes it not
only hard to guess, but hard to remember... But as roy said, security is
not easy. For more info, I'd say look in alt.pgp or sci.crypt. the
sci.crypt faq is a really helpful set of documents. Why this discussion is
going on in the rave mailing list, I have no idea... Not that I am helping
any.

Hmmm... the passphrase is important, but i was also assuming that
you'dd attempot to keep your secret keyring physically secure....
rather than relying on the pasphrase.... 

In PGP, the passphrase is only an issue if someone else has access to
your secret keyring... think of it as a second line of defense in case
your secret key floppy should be lost or stolen.... but don't rely on
it....  if you lose a copy of your secret keyring, then, if you're a
cautious type, you'll issue a key compromize certificate even if
there's no evidence that your passphrase has been compromized....


as for DES vs IDEA... personally i doubt that there's any NSA trapdoor
in DES, and IDEA is a little too new for my liking.  That said, DES is
getting rather small... exhaustive search of 2^56 keys is looking more
and more plausible....  so it's swings and roundabouts....

I had origionally tried to set up some Ravers PGP workshop and tutorial
session,   but there was a lack of interest in the parties involved,  but
I am ALWAYS interested in supporting PGP users.    If you have any ideas
in mind on how I can help you all,  just say it...   I'll bend over backwards
to help anyone use PGP (Except PIGS of course).

I plan on being at YSH again,   so I'll see ya all there.... Perhaps while
I'm chilling out,  we can sit down and talk about it..  I would be honored.

One of the things I did was to get my PGP key fingerprint, print out a
bezillion copies in a tiny 6 point font, cut them apart, and put some
in my wallet. Then I can hand it to other PGP user's in person. If
anyone wants mine, just ask. I usually have some of them on me
somewhere.

One thing to keep in mind when you certify someone's key is what you
think the chances are that their key will be compromised. These are
probably small in any case, but if they are using PGP offline, say on
a PC, things are much more secure.

I strongly advise everyone to read the PGP documents to fully
understand how to get the most from it.  Properly used, I'd say (and
I'm a cryptology geek) it's reasonably secure from any--including
government-- eavesdropping when used with 1024 bit keys. So far there
have been no weaknesses found in IDEA or RSA, requiring a cracking
effort of searching a 128 bit keyspace or bugging your apartment (more
likely, and much cheaper).

Has anyone tried sending sound bites of their favorite trance-style
  habbadasherie over the net? You can uuencode small snippets of sound
  (10 secs or so) at a low rate in one of several sound file formats
  nowadaze, and others can actually figger out for themselves what they
  like (would be a great supplement to album reviews!)

Most workstations can play back that stuff; I can play Sun/Next as well as
  SGI sound files, and newer PC's can do it too!  Some of the files would
  be big, but probably not much over 100k (c'mon, some of your more rabid
  typists crank out that kind of volume on a good day anywaze!)

How about (oh, mr behlen???) a repository of sound bites somewhere over on
  the raves machine site?  

Just trying to catch up . . .

Hello Everyone!

Well I'm finally back on the east coast... All I have to say about my trip
is that it was really good.  I did and saw things to many to mention..
well I decided to compile a list of things that I will remember for a while
instead of writing a story .. so here goes:

1. Going to a Rave Called Ananda and hearing CJ Bolland on the decks..
   it was an excellent rave at candlestick park that had music which
   just blew my head away.

2. Going to Your Sister's House straight from the airport and meeting a 
   bunch of friendly sf ravers.  Also hearing tara's set which featured
   some DJAX..

3. walking to every record store in town and getting some amazing records
   ..although I did score some german hard trance the best records were
   the domestics ..especially exist dance.

4. spending 5 hours in the exploritorium with criag, brian and miles.

5. Staying with cindy and having Jeno (the Cat) attack me at 6 oclock 
   in the morning..

6. watching Mystery Science Theatre 3000 at brian's place.. that was
   fun... :)

7. Driving up highway 1 and seeing Bonnie Doon.

that's all I can think of right now.. there was a lot more of course.
San Francisco is a great town. the people are friendly and the scene
seems really together.  Most importantly I would like to thank brian,
cindy and susie for letting me stay at their place and showing me around
town.  Also Bryce and Tamara who were great rave companions (remember 
lyons heheh).  I met a tremendous number of people.. A lot more than
I expected..Hopefully I will return very soon.. thanks to all of making
this a great trip...

take care,
oz

My main point was that the passphrase should not be discounted- even if you
keep your keyring on a floppy, it could be compromised on some systems, and
if you are mugged for it...with a hard-to-crack password at least your old
messages are secure.

DES wa limited to a 56 bit key at the NSA's request... this makes me
wonder. I doubt that there is any true back door, but that limit makes me
think it is practical for them to break it, if they think it is worth it.

IDEA is new, but looks thoeretically very solid. Of course it is impossible
to say, but you take your chances with anything.

As an example of how small, I saw a post on sci.crypt about a new program
(I think running on a Cray- limited access but there are enough of these
around for this to be significant) can run a brute-force passphrase search
on DES for all 6-letter passwords in about an hour, and all lowercase 6
letter passwords in bust under a minute. That is my point about passwords-
if you use a 14 or 18 character password that has no real words in it and
extra non-letter characters, it is, as you say, a second line of defence,
but a very improtant one.

Hi all, I am jumping out of my skin because I'm leaving in about two
hours to go to the airport to get my flight to SF.   So anyway,
I'll see some of you tonight at the airport, and a lot of you
tomorrow at YSH.  

Since Brian B. has class tomorrow from like 11am to 8pm, I'm going to
be able to borrow his car.  I'd like to drive down for the South
Bay Lunch.  Could someone please send me personalized, DETAILED
directions on how to get there from Berkeley?  I've never been to
California before, so don't assume I know where common landmarks 
are or even what they look like :-)

Also, if any of my vrave buddies are free tomorrow and want to get
together, send me email with your phone number and when a good time
to call is and I will call you back after I wake up tomorrow (which
will most likely be very late :-) ).

Hasta luego!

Hey, why not talk about PGP on SFR? Better than flame wars and much more
appropriate for the scene and the "clientele" (if that's the right word
here). I'm glad the thread has at least gotten interesting. Flame wars
aren't my kind of fare. Of course, PGP isn't everyone's idea of stimulating
convo, but everyone who uses e-mail should use PGP also, I think.

Thanx for the key, Bob! Anyone else?

Visuals at Progress last night were definitely above average.  Although 
nothing super technical (just a bunch of slide projectors, film loops,
overheads, etc.), it was very creatively done.  I usually get bored quick
with most visuals (of course I've yet to see the Aurgasm alchemy that
everyone seems to like so much :), but these were in a constant state of
metamorphosis.

I talked with the creator a bit, and he was quite open and friendly.  Last
year he did a Gathering and a Sharon, this year he's been doing a bunch of
smaller parties and of course he's at Progress every Tuesday.  He's
interested in more work so I offered to post his business card to the net.
I hope nobody minds.

Checked out Progress in San Jose last night with Johnny T.  It sure was nice
to get my beat fix without having to drive over an hour to the city to do it!
Got there about 11:00, but most people didn't show up 'til after 12:00.  

Rick Preston spun a pretty hot set, followed by (I think) Julius.  Have to 
say that I liked Preston better.  His set was pretty consistent and more my
flavor -- there were a couple of dance floor dropouts during Julius' set.  

It was on the small side, maybe 75 people, with maybe a third of that on the
dance floor max, but a good crowd for a week night and plenty enough for
the size of the space.  The smile factor was about a 2, but there was little
if no attitude and although people seemed to have beamed in without their 
Luv Phasors, there wasn't a *bad* vibe.  It was just a personal decision
whether or not to have a good time, and I did!

The sound was really clean and never got too loud.  The fog machine got a
little noxious at times, along with the cig smoke, but wasn't a constant
threat.  The visuals were definitely above average ++, more on that in
another post.  Oh yeah, and free water! :)

Overall, a good time for only $3 and a Tuesday night, which for me usually
involves domestic trivialities such as laundry and dishes.  :P  Looking 
forward to checking out Free Life next Monday...

Sounds good then. I actually don't use it. I have had no 'need' for it thus
far, and if I did, I would probably use something like RIPEM/Mac (Yup, I'm
a mac head) for communication. Not quite as ubiquitous, and I think it will
become more of a standard, in only because companies won't be afraid to use
it because of legal issues. Face it- the companies drive this thing, and I
think that PGP will be dropped  by most people within a few years.
Commercial interests will build software with integrated public-key crypto,
it will be completely transparent, and that will be the end of PGP. (Plus,
macPGP's interface is lousy :)). Triple DES, while possibly not secure from
NSA, is fine for me (If the NSA cares enough about the tripe I talk about,
I _AM_ worried about this country. I understand the matter of principals in
this, but I have chosen other battles. Anyway, that is my non-technical
assessment of PGP.

On 'sfraves.stanford.edu' there exists a directory called
'/pub/raves/song-samples' that contains song samples of 30 seconds or less
and have a size of 250k bytes or less.

To upload, place the sample file in '/pub/incoming'.

I have placed a uploaded a few Sun Sparc '.au' samples that are about
30 seconds long.  If you want to listen to the samples and don't have
something that will play this type of sample, you can convert it
to you favorite sound format using a conversion tool that I have
uploaded called 'sox'.

'sox' is public domain and will convert between must common sound
file formats on UNIX platforms.  Currently, the raw (no header),
IRCAM Sound Files .SF, Sound Blaster .VOC, SPARC .AU (w/header),
Mac HCOM, PC/DOS  .SOU, Sndtool,  and  Sounder, NeXT .SND,
Windows 3.1 RIFF/WAV, and Amiga/SGI AIFF and 8SVX formats are supported.

Listen and enjoy...

This song isn't techno, but I was wondering if anyone can name the band and
name of the song.  It came out about 5 years ago (I think) and was one of
the televangelists sampled to a beat. The main line repeated over and over
was 'Hey poor- you don't have to be poor anymore/Jesus is here.' Would like
to buy the album, but don't enjoy singing to bored looking record store
clerks like a fool... I think it may be Dessau; don't really know though.

A lot of people are suspicious about this because all of the DES
design criteria are classified. This is reasonable from the NSA point
of view even if DES is secure since good design criteria is something
one would like to keep out of enemy hands.

Is DES secure? Expert cryptologists think so. They don't believe
shortening the keyspace to 56 bits weakened DES. Now they believe that
DES--even when used with 64 bit keys--has only 56 bits worth of
strength. They believe that the NSA shortened it to 56 bits to reduce
processing time.

Despite being extensively analyzed in hundreds of published papers by
the best cryptologists in the public world, DES' only shown weakness
to date is to a chosen plaintext attack, which reduced the keyspace
search by two bits. This doesn't affect it's practical security in the
real world where chosen plaintext is rarely available. More likely
they'd just bug your apartment.

DES's biggest weakness is probably its 56 bit keyspace which will
eventually fall to faster and faster computers.

Nonetheless, I like IDEA better because its design criteria is public
(and thus available for attack) and because of its inherent 128 bit
keyspace. DES isn't bad, according to big gun cryptologists, but
IDEA--as long as it resists attack--is better.

and dont forget the line:

Group: Front 242
Album: Front By Front
Song: Welcome To Paradise V 1.0

Album also includes F242 smash hit 'HeadHunter'

Also check out the Televangelists satire song 'Angst'
from the Front 242 album 'Official Version'.

Both albums are classic industrial dance albums well worth
the price of domestic CD's.

Heyo,
I checked out sfraves.stanford.edu and found a sound file but not the
program 'sox' you mentioned. I have a Mac, so I kind of need conversion
to .snd if possible. Any idea where else I might find sox?

BTW, I haven't even been to a rave yet...it's been interesting reading
the mail here for the past week or so. I've ben meaning to go to a rave
for a while, hopefully not just because it's the 'in' thing to do, in
fact that never motivated me a *whole* lote. What really got me interestd
was hearing from a friend about what y'all are referring to as the 'vibe'
*and* the hope (unevenly expressed) that something is being buit here
that is a positive comunity in its own right, and can have a positive
impact on the greater community.

Any suggestions about where I should start are welcome (I was hoping
to get the sound file to check out the music :). On my own I would
probably pick YSH, but I have a class on Thursday nights for the next
few weeks. Maybe after that...
...Johnnie

You may want to consider the Bulletproof boat party this Sunday, 
7-11pm.  It's not a full-blown rave, and the price is steep at
$20.  You have to get advance tickets at Bulletproof in lower
Haight.  I've been hearing great things about it, vibewise, and
will be going to my first one this Sunday.  They happen the last
Sunday of every month, and always sell out.  Next month the're
getting a bigger boat (500 cap. I think).

There are a number of Mac sound utilities on sumex-aim.stanford.edu or
mac.archive.umich.edu.  I haven't yet used sox, though.  Sounds great!

Go to YSH after yer class.  The dancing starts after the discussion
which ends at 11 now, I believe.

YSH is the best party I've gone to in a while.  Weekly or not.

Note:  YSH is the first party I've noticed to regularly start on time.
Cool!

ObNonRaveyMandatorySFRPostContent:
The other day I was riding home on the freeway near Walnut Creek and
noticed what can only be called a "CHiPS" ticket quota machine.  There
were 6 CHP cruisers at the side of the road with their officers
walking the shoulder, pointing at drivers and waving them over.  What
they were ticketing most people for is unclear, since the traffic was
5 mph. bumper to bumper.  Anyway, this fat govt. goon points at me and
jerks his thumb in a smooth practiced motion towards the shoulder.  I
made sure to ride about 25 extra yards, making the pig walk up to my
bike (I was certain I had not broken any law-ha ha).  Haas walks up
and takes my licence, while I am noticing that these jokers are
keeping no fewer than 4 cars pulled over at any one time (during rush
hour!).  So Johnny Law sez: (in a Capt. Kirk type voice) "Are you,
are you wearing prescription sunglasses?"

"Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit!"  A voice in my head says.  Although I
have 20/20-20/40 L/R vision, I was wearing my glasses when I took my
California drivers test.  So I get this ticket for driving w/o
my glasses.

I asked the officer why he pulled me over in the first place, and he
sorta beat around the bush.  Dickhead.

I'm going to court over this one.  Wish me luck!

I'm not familliar with the precisise details of the PEM key
certification heirarchy, but the problem is, it requires you to
*trust* the certification authorities.

It's a really neat system, and it automates a lot of stuff, but it
means you have to trust the government.

Also, RSA won't allow anyone to take RSAREF (the cryptographic library
used by RIPEM) out of the US, because of export licence issues...
PGP, on the otherhand, is legal everywhere *except* the US (because of
US patents held by PKP).  Strange world, eh?

Also check out the Televangelists satire song 'Angst'
from the Front 242 album 'Official Version'.

--------------
there's another cool song along these lines, not by F242, but someone else,
a group w/ only 1 well known song but the cut is called "Bushwacked",
and contains cut up samples of Bush speaking. They re-arrange what he
said in various speeches so that it says what he really meant all along,
quite brilliant, I'll try to remember who did it.  If you like the songs
mentioned in these posts, you'd probably be at least slightly amused by
"Bushwacked", music wasn't half-bad either.

True, from the NSA point of view. But regardless of whether or not this is
the reason, it still brings up security through obscurity.

These words should probably have the word 'most' in front of them.
There are those who have thier doubts. (don't have refs on hand- sorry)

Where did this come from? that is interesting.

Color me paranoid, but I have my doubts. I think in the PGP documentation
there is a discussion of what we don't know about IBM and NSA's
interactions there, and PGP's author's doubts about it (DES).

True, but there is still no proof that DES _is_ secure, either.

Yep, and what adds to that is that is (as far as complex algorithms go) can
be implemented in pretty fast ways. Definitely double edged.

I agree. The keyspace is the deciding factor for me as well.  BTW, where is
a good source for the design criteria? I would like to look at it.

Yep. I think that this is what is going to make it a standard. Flaws, true,
but a well structured hierarchy creates standards (and heinous monsters).

Menas you have to trust a cirtification heirarchy. This means the
governement how, but there are other heirarchies emerging. The RPIEM Mac
decumentation has email addresses for a couple experimental servers. There
are a couple of weaknesses in it, and nonheirarchical distribution patterns
like PGP's privides the possibility for more checks on a possible forgery
through the fact that different people will probably have different keys
and can crosscheck, belonging to a couple different heirarchies using PEM
provides a similar service. Also, PEM heirarchies make forgeries harder in
the first place (thoeretically; the problem is that right now ( could
register in your name, assuming you haven't already. Don't know how that
will be solved. Identity proofing... hm.)

True, but you know that legal issues have stopped its 'exporting' as much
as they have stopped PGP's use here... And I do think that commercial
interests will force export licence issues to loosen soon enough for it to
take on. This is idle seculation, but one has to bet on something...

If you have a Mac, I highly recommend getting a program called SimBush. It
is at Sumex and umich, I think. It takes bush-bytes and randomly assembles
them as it goes. Really funny, and makes complete sentences a surprising
amount of the time.  Think the same author did the same thing with Jesse
Helms, but haven't seen it.

No problem.  The PEM standards require each registering autority to
issue a statement as to what checks they make on the identity of the
applicant before issuing a key.  That means that any user who
retrieves a key from an authority can make his own decision as to
whether or not the level of security provided by the authority is
adequate.  (This assumes, of course, that the authority itself, is
trustworthy...)

Actually, there'd be no problem with someone outside the US
implementing an RSA library that is compatible with RSAREF.  I believe
RIPEM itself (without RSAREF) can be exported....

So see you all later, just look for a short blonde stranger getting out of

I have been ftp'ing song samples to 'sfraves.stanford.edu' that
were sampled on a Sun SparcStation from my collection of CDs.

They live in '/pub/raves/song-samples'.
There is some new Orbital, Speedy J, and some AphexTwin, etc...

They can be converted to diffent sound formats if you don't have
a Sun.

Let's share the music...upload your song samples to '/pub/incoming'
or make a request if you want to hear something.

The group is called Negetiveland; I've heard the cut that that your talking
about, it's all these "off the air" production outtakes of Kasem obscenely debasing
various tired pop music song formats.  Quite a turnaround for someone you
usually hear brightly promoting the latest pop megarelease!

Incidently, Negetiveland got into a bit of trouble sampling U2, as well as
reproducing Kasem's tirades -- resulted in all sorts of legal difficulties which
they go into great detail about on their liner notes.  It's a pretty in-depth
discussion of copyright law, sampling, etc. actually...

before going, them burritos is huge!  La Azteca is on Church just
south of Market, across the street from Sparky's.  Laura and I
will be there from 8:30 until 9:30 or so.... a little later than usual
but I have just had a class switched to Thursdays from 5-8pm so any
earlier would be difficult.  See everyone there!

lots of nice closeups of insect heads, fly eyes, etc.  They look beautiful

There was a small soundsystem set up in the back of a pickup yestereday
before and after the shoreline shows. Hung out there after-show and got
in my 1/2hr of ravercise for the day. At most 10-15 people dancing,
more standing around and watching from "afar"... I asked and they said
they weren't assoc'd with atomic rooster. One of the guys assoc'd w/
the event handed me a "burning man" flyer, and another handed me
something w/ the TAZ # (SOLS-666 or whatever) on it -- so perhaps this
group is associated w/ TAZ?

I kinda promised myself i wouldn't waste my money on another Dead show,
but when some amazinglyclose tickets became available at face-value, I
went for it.

The show was pleasant enough at first... but... perhaps it's just that
I wasn't dosed, but the show really started grating on me near the end
(bad musicianship, total inability to sing, combined w/ overloud
distortion coming from what seemed to be a blown speaker stack). So
despite the fact that it was "socially" interesting, visually
stimulating, and a fun party, the music began to bore/grate on me near
the end.

In that respect, coming out and hearing non-rock-and-roll
non-sub-120-bpm house/techno/rave music in the parking lot was a
blessing. A nice way to cap off the evening.

No, just that my mother-in-law doesn't have net access.  Janie
can be reached at jlf3@attmail.com.

ObRave: Insects, reptiles, and all biological organisms certainly 
belong within the realm of raver consciousness.  The forces in
society that have trained us to consider these creatures as 
repulsive are the same forces that have taught us to rape the
environment and practice bigotry towards fellow humans.  For me,
raving is a celebration of all life.  Rhythms exist in every
aspect of nature and I look forward to seeing Gregg's electron
scanning microscope photos at future raves.

I didn't get much new for this weekend 'cause SOMEONE STOLE MY WALLET
w/my driver's license, and I couldn't go out much this week.  Thanks
to Philip and Jessica and others for contributing a few flyers, though.

Tonight, at Your Sisters' House, ne-raves' and sfraves' own Laura will
be spinning, maybe early, so don't miss it!  I don't know what
the deal w/Xanadu is, the phone message doesn't say anything about the
SF event.  Funky Tekno Tribe will be big - the Galleria is a kinda 
interesting place, but this isn't quite an underground.  Planet Drum has
a good lineup, I think it'll be in the South Bay.

I've heard good things about Corduroy City (plus it includes Synergy
visuals) and the Fridge, so maybe it's a good week to check those out.
Mission Rock is fun, but be careful if you go - there have been several
acts of violence outside recently.

Bad Car Night At YSH 
 or
How to spend $20+ at YSH

 I got to Your Sister's House at 11:15AM . I parted in a side street 
alongside a whole bunch of other cars - unfortunetly , we all didn't
notice the "No Parking 12midnight to 2AM sign." When I got to my truck
at 12:30AM , a $20 ticket was on all our windshields. 

 Another SFRaver had an even worst auto problem - getting into a fender
bender right next at the corner ! Niels was OK , although his left
rear fender has a 2" deep , plate sized dent.

 Auto abuse aside, YSH was great! I had at least two sublime moments
tonight - once while dancing to Jan Cooley's mixing, and the other 
listening to the drummers in the basement. 

 Nice to see some familiar SFRavers , and the folks from "back east"
as well. I was the guy in the grey shirt with the red crab on my back.
I left at 4AM - all danced out , even though the music was still
playing!

 No work today - so off to bed I go ....

Geez!  Yesterday must have been Bad Transpo Karma Day or something...
Still mad from my B.S. ticket the other day, I got in a pretty bad
motorcycle accident on 680 yesterday.  (I'm OK... the bike and I
parted ways quite nicely.  The bike, however, it damn near destroyed
:-(  )

The worst thing was, I was about to get off the freeway and could
actually see my cubicle from where I bit it.   My boss saw it all, he
thought I was dead.  I was pretty lucky.

I considered going to YSH anyway but I was too sore.  Stayed home and
went on an alcohol and tylenol binge and read E-Mail. :-)

I'll be limping to interop today... Hopefully I'll run into (no pun
intended) Geoff & co. 

C'ya!

Oasis is Downtown San Jose was totally going off last night. It was 
the best I have ever seen it. 
The DJ line up was fantastic. Not necessarily in this order:  Marky 
Mark, Spun, Jeno, Garth.  There was so much energy it was like being 
at an event.  The last song, they turned on the lights, and everyone 
was still going.  It was the best crowd too.  I think a lot of people 
came down from the city.  
After the club closed there was a party in a wherehouse in Santa 
Clara, that was going off almost as much as Oasis. We finally left 
at about 4 am, and there were people still arriving.  (Amazingly 
enough I am here at work writing this).  Anyway, i just wanted to 
pass this info along to anyone who doesn't necessarily want to make 
the long drive to San Franciso on a Thursday night.

Well as we kind of suspected all along, Laura came into town and
blasted some poor SF raver's bodies into total neuralmuscular overload
with that fast East Coast style. Everybody *loved* it. Wow, Laura.

This week's YSH was held in a small not-very-well-ventilated venue
which concentrated those raver-generated BTUs into an amazingly Amazon
jungle-like environment.

The usual YSH wonderful positive vibes and great crowd contributed to
the usual good time. If you haven't been there, go!

"Daum" is Daum Bentley, aka FREAKY CHAKRA.  He's supposedly playing
live at this thing.  I know that he went down to LA to do his live
show there last night, and he's also playing live in SF tonight.  But
I don't think that all the LA DJs will be here.

YES!,

     I must agree with Vivianm.  Last night at the 'O' was one of the most
pumped nights there in a while.  Major smile factor and this was everyone not
just a few people.  Only two DJs played Markie Mark and Garth.  They played
with a vengance.  I haven't had that much fun or danced that much at a party in
ages.  The Vibe was flowin'.  Mini rave on a Thursday night is what it was. 
Peace to all who participated and those who didn't!

hey,

that sounds like NegativLand (sp?), a little prank they had
industry giants (MONSTERS?!?!?) U2 and their record co. (Virgin?
or was it Island?  any U2 fans out there?) suing them over.  I
think Casey might have sued (or tried to sue) them as well.

Good show by NL, IMHO...

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

the first thing that comes to my mind about last night is....

wow.

this was my third YSH, and by far the best one for me...

firstly, i just want to say that the discussion group is a really great
idea - at least people were talking, interacting, communicating, and 
enjoying the exchange of ideas & opinions.


and the music...amazing

Laura came on at 11, and to say her set blew me away is an
understatement. *INCREDIBLE* 
fast, yet trancy, & amazingly powerful - i just let myself get lost in
the music...the rhythm was pounding into me & i was loving it.

and to my pleasant surprise, after the DJ after her suddenly left, she
came on again. 

I haven't danced so hard, so long, or enjoyed myself so much in a very long
time...

her music made me feel really happy inside, full of energy, and it moved me
until i had sweat pouring in my eyes and my feet and muscles were completely
sore, but i had a huge grin on my face the entire time...8-)

and the DJ after Laura's second set kept me going until about 3:30 - 
i danced to oblivion 8-)

and the people were wonderful - evrywhere i looked, & met someone's eyes,
they would smile back, & that made me feel really really good.

hellos to everyone there...it was nice seeing both old and new faces 8-)

minor gripe- the dance floor got too overcrowded, and really hot as a result,
but then, i like to take up a lot of room when i dance 8-)

it's events like this that remind me what first attracted me to raving...

and i'm still wearing a grin, despite an 8am physics lecture this morning-
and people stared at me wondering how in hell i could be so happy this early
in the morning...8-)

Negativland released the "U2 NEGATIVLAND" single and got sued because
of the COVER ART - not the song.  Basically, it has "U2" in huge
letters (over a U2 spy plane) and "Negativland" in much smaller
letters.  Island Records (not U2, not Casey Kasem) sued SST and
Negativland over it.  They settled out of court - Negativland
basically just rolled over and played dead because they are a tiny
band and couldn't afford the kind of high priced entertainment lawyer
that Island could.  (Island retained the guy who represents Madonna
for this case, incidentally.)  Negativland were ordered to destroy all
unsold copies, the master tapes, glass masters & stamper molds...

After all this, SST Records sued Negativland because they wanted
Negativland to pay all the legal fees, which isn't in their contract,
btw.  I don't know what happened with that suit.

>Good show by NL, IMHO...

They don't think so.

The whole regrettable story can be read in U2's magazine/CD "The
Letter U and the Numeral Two".

BTW, Negativland have a new album out called "FREE" (which is public
domain, btw!).  It was subsidized by donations from fans.  You should
buy it because they need the money.

My friend John had never been to a Grateful Dead show or a r*** so
last night I double-newbied him :)  We arrived at YSH around 1:30
to find it hot, packed and sort of not happening very much.  He
was wiped and took off around 2, right around the time things began
picking up.  It was at the Railway Spine Gallery on Howard, a nice
but not very ventilated space.  We had a visit from the local
gendarmes around 3 am but things continued until about 4.  Jan Cooley
gamely played on through the heat and occasional inadvertent jostling
of the DJ table and scratchy vinyl and all that.  Got quite good for
about half an hour but the place was really too small and traffic too
constant through the dancing area down the middle to get a seriou
gruve going.  

I missed Laura's set unfortunately but did say hi to her, Brian, Derek,
Larry, Sean, Geoff and some other folks.  A good sweaty time sez I,
a nice contrast to the GD scene where I love the music but for some
reason feel pretty wiped when I leave.  After YSH and a good shower
I felt great, tho!

Not sure where I'll be this weekend.  One more Grateful Dead show and
Phish tomorrow at the Greek in the conventional mode, maybe Funky Tekno
Tribe or even Bulletproof in the expanded mode ;-)

Laura, I want to marry your record collection! :)

Laura kicked ass with that East Coast hard core stuff! That's what I was
looking for (although I didn't know it until last night) when I walked into
the record store a few months ago and discovered techno.

Any clue on some of the titles/groups she played last night? Brian named an
album, but it's totally slipped my mind now...

The location left only little to be desired, like more dance space, but it
wasn't that bad. If it could be held back in the TAZ space... :)

As usual, ran into most of my SFR friends and even met someone in my
genetics class here at UCD. Surprise, eh?

Sean brought some friends (non-ravers) to YSH last night... I think they'll
be coming back. They seemed to have a good time.

> Laura, I want to marry your record collection! :)
You can start out by getting Hardfloor's album "TB Resuscitation" (an import),
which is available either as one full-length CD or as a double-12" set.
Laura played two songs from it.  (It has eight tracks overall, most of them 
being in that hard-hitting acid trance style.)

 I don't know what happened with that suit.
---------
greg ginn lost (SST's owner).  this was discussed in some issue of
rolling stone a few months back.  he was also suing the meat puppets
and trying to keep their catalog against their will or something
like that.  he lost that one as well, if I  remember correctly.
ginn IS a MONSTER, I have quite reliable, personally knowledgeable
references on that...he basically tried to bully a bunch of people,
the aforementioned bands among the abused, and fortunately was thwarted.
he's sort of the 'wally' of the indy rock scene, IMHO...which is too
bad, cuz most of the SST acts seemed to think he was an OK guy until
all this stuff started happening.

My friend and I were sitin around last night and we came to the realization
that we (humans) are at an all-out, no-rules, hardcore war against bugs.
We take over the land that they exist on, exterminate them, squish them, use
chemical warfare on them (including using planes and helicopters, make 
comercials showing robot/human cyborgs ala robo cop killing them (negative
publicity media campaign), drive around in trucks with huge plastic spiders
on the door or monopoly-man-looking-guy-with-hammer about to smash bugs as
symbols of the war, etc.  We went on for a half an hour thinking up examples
such as these and tripping on the way we think of them as the invaders, always
trying to get into our shit when from their "viewpoint" we come and plop all
our shit in their way and then kill them when they get into it.

As for visuals, I think it would be cool to see other facets of nature such
as plants and rocks.

hey all,

--------------------
You can start out by getting Hardfloor's album "TB Resuscitation" (an import)
--------------------

anybody interested in some discussion of records?  i've heard alot of
stuff but often have trouble finding it/figuring out what it was, etc.

on the other hand my 12" addiction has recently branched out from
"strictly hard core rap" to include house and related stuff (techno,
etc.).  one of *my* problems is, that while i have "good ears", I
don't know the sub-genres very well (for ex., breakbeat to me implies
old school rap/hip hop like Treacherous 3, Funky-Four, Sugar Hill,
T-Ski Valley, Bambata (sp?), etc., which is NOT what i suspect is
being referred to when discussions on this list refer to breakbeat).

on the lighter side, i have recently acquired some groovy new 12" house
records that y'all might be interested in...so anybody interested?

i'll start off by mentioning a couple that i can remember (they're
at home, so i'll have to bring in a list of 'em) that i really liked,
maybe if some informed sould out there recognizes 'em, they'll let me know
the proper terms for discussion, and what classification is practical
(i.e. prog, trance, hcore, etc.)

Verde Sative: The Positive Cult EP

this is (i suspect) progressive house, has 4 mixes, kinda "jazzy" in 
feel, and I like it alot.  It is not very techno-y, not to many gated
a-a-a-a-a-a-ah type keyboards, vocals etc, kinda has some cool percussion,
medium tempo (for house) and i suspect wopuld fit into houseier styles at
events here.  i've heard stuff like this at groove kitchen.

Jeek!:  Ragga

This is great, has REALLY cool mixes that build in energy very well, great
percussion, normal intruments (non synth, non-techno), and has both house
and dancehall mixes...

i'll post a better review next week....later!

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


I've often wondered if my impression of what people are talking about when
they refer to styles of house/techno is close to others'.  Here's what _I'd_
call certain sets from the Come/Unity tapes...
Spun: Funky trance
Jeno: Deep trance
I don't hear any of what I'd call straight up hardcore or acid there.

Anyway, if anyone knows any better, or especially has some track IDs from
those sets, I'd be grateful.  Some of the stuff on Spun's set especially
really tweeks my head.  Most of the stuff I remember enjoying at Deep Space
and other places made it in there, and the rest made it into Jeno and Garth's
set (thy both played a bit of that "breakbeat with sine-wave bass and a
really distorted set of organ/guitar hits over it").  The only exception
is a bit of insane breakbeat, sounding basically like several slightly
different sampled measures of someone whacking out a (well-recorded)
godlike funky 4, mostly naked but with an occasional figure that sounds
like four descending crunchy guitar chords or, hell, I don't know, but I
*NEVER* can figure out what this is because all few times I've heard it
I'm dancing like a demon and don't get to look over the DJ table until 
a few tracks later when I've cooled down.

It's frustrating not knowing anything about the music you like.  I guess
the answer is "go to more raves", but I'd still like to pick up what I
can.

Any other naming conventions for stuff on the C/U or Connection II tape
sets?  Tx // g

 Hello Folks!

 For any SFSFRavers out there ( San Francisco Ravers who are also into
Science Fiction ) , you might be interested in the one-page write-up
on ConFrancisco in the latest issue ( Aug. 23rd ) of MicroTimes. 
A more detailed , but much harder to read , daily schedule is available
via anonymous ftp from gandalf.rutgers.edu , in the pub.sfl directory -
get the "ConFrancisco.Program" file. It's the tentative daily schedule,
subject to last minute changes.

 ConFrancisco is the 1993 edition of WorldCon , the annual world science
fiction and fantasy convention. It's being held in San Francisco during
the Labor Day weekend , starting Thursday afternoon.

 I've managed to get a meeting approved for the convention - it's
presently titled "Non-Rave" - it's a chance for people who are science
fiction/fantasy fans who are also ravers to get together and exchange 
experiences , and maybe music!

 I could still use some slides and videotapes , if anyone's got 'em.
I have and FMR videotape and a Connection I ( Bonny Doon ) videotape.

 If you're going - hope to see you there!

Just got back from Boogie Buffet and before that Funky Techno Tribe,
which is a story in itself I'll tell later.  I just saw ccat's posting
and wondered if this is the same thing as this flyer I just picked up --
the info number is 415/245-0095.

If this is the same as the flyer I just picked up at the end of Funky
Techno Tribe, they have Jeno, Dan, Dutch, Carlos and Phil Smart
listed, for noon to 6.  I'm going to take a nap but if anyone is
gonna try to check it  out and is driving from SF I'd be interested
in going  along -- call me at 415/567-5517.

I'm also considering the Bulletproof cruise tonight -- big fun, from
what everyone I've been talking  to sez!

Oops, just realized I posted in response to ccat's posting for

he was there and said it went off OK though there wasn't enough
sound.  A ranger came by and asked about permits but  basicallt
let them go ahead for a while as it was getting close to sundown.
Hope things work out that well todag!

I received some interesting mail from "jsl@netcom.com"
recently that I thought you should all see, so I'm
forwarding it.  

Some context: after jsl's post about "Tweekers Anonymous", I
sent him a short message, which as I remember it was
something like:

"Being your usual mature, sensitive self I see.  I thought
you'd promised to pack it in?  Maybe you should think about
forming Flamers Anonymous."

He sent me a long note, which I unfortunately don't have.
It included all of his usual catch phrases.  Told me I was
"mistaken", stated I was obviously a tweeker, told me to
"consider myself checked!", and in passing asked me to not
send him any mail.

I thought he was just trying to piss me off, so I sent him a
two liner acting bored.  He quotes it below, repeating his
request that I not write to him, and I sent a note agreeing
not to write to him (probably I shouldn't have, but I have a
fairly dumb sense of humor.)

The exchanges below seem interesting to me in a number a
ways.  He gets very legalistic, accusing me of "harrassing"
him, makes dire threats of reporting me to the authorities,
and so on.  He claims to have asked me not to write to him
"several" times, when it was really twice.  (His last
two pieces of mail came on top of each other, I didn't reply
in between.)

Personally, I've been convinced that jsl deserves to be
taken seriously, and I'd recommend thinking twice before
associating with him in any way.  I keep wondering if he's
something like a "wolf in ravers clothing", so here I am
crying "wolf"...  but mostly I think you should just read
the following and make your own conclusions.

Sorry if it seems like I'm just bringing a flame war to the
net, but I did think you all might want to know about this. 

(By the way, if anyone has reservations about posting
"private" email to the net, I'd be glad to discuss that via
email.  Briefly, I believe someone who sends you mail is
trusting you to use your discretion, but you aren't sworn to
secrecy about it.)

Mr. Brenner,

I have asked you several times to stop sending me e-mail, yet you continue to think that my request is some form of joke.  Well sir, rest assured it is not.  Harassment on any computer network, especially if it originated from a school can get ugly.
I do not want to write a letter campaignto your sys admin, or your dean letting him know of such abuses (since I have saved each communique between us) since I believe all it would accomplish is the silencing of you.  I do not want that to happen at all.
What I would like is total non-communication between us.  Why?  Look you don't respect me.  I could care less that you disagree with the many things I say, but respect of the individual is another matter.
Once Again I ask that you refrain from leaving me mail.  If you do not I can call you and discuss this matter further.  Meet you face to face to discuss this matter futher, or call/write/talk to your Dean and make him aware of my concerns.

A non-reply will mean that you have complied with my wishes, and I can leave it at that.  ANy other form of communication between us will be considered a breach of my request and I will take action to ensure I am no longer harassed by you electronically.

Consider this a final warning.

Thank you,
John S. Lee

Hmm..
Are any of you aware of FIJA, the Fully Informed Jury Association/Amendment?

The historical duty of juuries includes judging the law itself, both
in general and as to whether they judge that it should apply in the
given case. This duty has never ben legally revoked (it's hard to
imagine that happening...), but knowledg of it has all but disappeared
and judges have been allowed to instruct juries that that is *not* 
within their power.

So...many people have recently taken this up to publicize it, one method
being to hand out leaflets outside of courthouses around the time that
propspective jury members show up.

I have more info if anyone's interested. I could bring it to a YSH
(unfortunately not this week's).Do your friends have a trial date
yet, Geoff?

I don't consider this appropriate for sfraves.  Please keep any interpersonal
squabbling to yourselves - there's nothing we as a group can do to solve 
anything, and it only adds bad karma.  If you really desire to take it to
more public channels, take it to your sysadmins or alt.angst.  Not a mailing

A big party.  The sound was not the best.  It was held in the Galleria,
lots of people who were 21-- (this was an all ages event...no id required).
 At 3:00 a.m. they turned off the music to enforce the cabaret license laws
"...will everyone clear the building...one you have left we will let you
back in..."..."the crowd yelled "...how old!?!?"...someone over the
loudspeaker said "21...".  Lots of boos. Phil Smart did play a great boomin
set,  I left @ 5:00.  The breakup ruined a building vibe.  Things at
parties that are getting a bit annoying:

- people have now decided that "hoofing" is a spectator sport (you know,
where those guys, primarily from sj, form a big circle and do the fancy
footworks).  They take up larger, and larger portions of the dance floor
making the space difficult to dance in.  I don't mind the dancing at all,
it's the spectators that see it as their duty to make the big ring
(sometimes 6 people deep), to watch the spectacle.

- rude, rude pushing people.  gone are the days when you'd get pushed or
stepped on and someone would say excuse me.

Overall it was an OK party.  Hope they don't get it shut down next time.

Boat Party Beach Blanket Bingo,

This is one of the few good things on the scene. That boat was going off
from the time it set sail, until it docked.  Markie fucked it up! :),
moonpup did the do downstairs (great disco set btw :), Felix did the do
after markie...I dunno who came on before markie, but he was playing some
good hip-hop.

By the time the Starship Stoopid came to dock there were nothing left but
victims :).  Many had passed out...most were STILL going off after the
music stopped....that was one giggin' party!.  Now these fools are getting
ready for the full moon tonight...the madness in SF never ceases!

Music in the daylight room was better than last week, while the dark

and any lawyer that attempts to even *mention* it gets slapped with
"contempt of court."  they passed *that* into law.  (they couldn't
revoke the law that was really irking them, so they made it illegal to
talk about it!  lovely country we live in.)

this law was originally written up during Vietnam when too many juries
acquitted draft dodgers because the people on the jury didn't agree
with the war.

it is *definitely* legal for a jury to vote its conscience, not just
the law!  tell everyone you know.  if you ever have jury duty, tell
your fellow prospective jurors...

I was just looking at the Techno>Direct list I got on 8/27 and found this:

> V/A                        SAN FRAN- RAVE X-PLOSION 1   CD REVO$14.10   ?
>              Stock number: 102                         Date entered:   8/27

Has anybody heard this or know what is on this?

  Pigs!  Pigs and more pigs!!  is the word at this rave.   We got there
about midnight which I introduced a friend to raving for the first time.

  Sometime around 2 am,   the pigs closed the place down,  and kicked
everyone out because for some reason the promoters had failed to screen
out 21- folks.   So,  everyone left the Galleria and was grouped outside,
which in my opinion was a BAD IDEA,  as it left a bad head trip on most
folks.   For the most part,   they took it in stride,   but eventually
everyone was allowed back in,  and the music started up again.

  Towards the end,  the DJ was really hopping,  and the sets were very 
long,   and it was the point where the dancing sorta seperated the men
from the boys.    

  Another PIG incident took place on the dancing stage where this older
black guy was really dancing wonderfully,  when two cops can in and
forcefully pulled him from the dance floor.    Has anyone gotten any word
as to why they picked on this dude??    He wasn't doing anything,   they
just went up and took him away.

  After Boogie Buffet,   towards the later part of the afternnon,   we mosied
down to the beach rave at the end of Sloat,  where I got in yet another hours
worth of dancing where once again the pigs came and shut it down.    They said
that NO amplified music was allowed on the beach.

  So,  it appears that more and more faschism insanity is happening in this
country,  which explains my most of my hip friends are moving to Amsterdam.

  As far as this no-amplified music is concerned,  I have a way to get around
that,  and we did this in Peoples park in the early 80's.    We used a good
quality
sterio FM transmitter,   and plugged in the sound source,  and everyone brought
boom boxes.    So,  as a standby,   if we get busted again,  we could remove
the
amplifiers,  and plug in the transmitter.   Then people with good quality car
sound systems can crank up their sub-whoofers,   and everyone bring their
boom-boxes and we can boogie.

  As far as obtaining transmitters are concerned,  there is this dude in
Berkeley
who started a workshop on how to build one.    His name is Steve Dunnifer,  who
you all will read about soon in nect issue of Mondo-2000.    He holds a
workshop
on how to build a small 5 watt transmitter (Don't know about it's sound
quality),
every two weeks in Berkeley.    The info number is (510) 464-3041 and you can
leave a message if anyone is interested in building several of these.   The
cost
is minimal (Less than $50 to build),  and will make it possible to get around
the "No amplification" rules (because thay haven't outlawed radios yet).

  I will be contacting Carlos soon and will gice this idea to him,  and if
anyone
else knows the other DJ's Pse pass this info on to them.   So lets stop this
faschism and rave on...

Cheers

spun is really on the hip-hop/funk/miami bass tip.  that track with
the really low bass note and the voice going "ignition" is a total
miami bass thing.  jeno tends to go for jazzier but still funky stuff.
descriptions are pretty useless.

that's "chile of the bass generation" by mental cube (otherwise known

Yeah, what is with this?  I am going to complain.  I don't like it.  
Not when you are crammed in a little space with everyone else stepping 
on them and being stepped on, what about two people over from you 
there is this stupid circle with these guys kneeling down waiting 
for whomever to go in the circle.  It doesn't bother me as much when 
there is plenty of room to dance, but when we are all crammed like 
sardines while the circle is hamming it up with their fancy dance 
steps, I get annoyed.  


Just my opinion.

Attorney General Janet Reno was considering a few weeks ago sending
out a letter from her office to all the Appeals Court judges informing
them that it was the intent of the AG office to have mandatory
sentencing guidelines repealed entirely.  Cooler heads prevailed,
though.  Her staff is preparing a suggested reformation for unveiling
September 15th.  She was quoted in the Chronicle as saying that she
doesn't believe that a first time drug offender should go to jail at
all, and she also thinks that even a second time offender should get
off with minimal punishment provided that both crimes involved mere
posession.  She seems to agree with many judges and lawyers that minor
drug cases with mandatory jail time are filling the jails and putting
violent criminals (robbery, rape) out on the street sooner.

This combined with the reduction in LSD penalties (carrier no longer
factors into weight) starting November 1st (?? I believe ??) seems to
indicate a shift in policy in Washington... but I guess we'll see when
this finishes playing out.

Most boomboxes have more than enough room inside to add a transmitter and leave
the amplifier _in_ that way they all look exactly alike..
The only way one could find a transmitter would be to check all of them to
see what was inside.. next to impossible..

Hmm, I believe Johnny Law would consider a pack of boom-boxes
a form of amplified music.  . . .actually they are amplified music. . .

So the hip are moving to Amsterdam. Isn't that just running
away from the problem.  I'm sick of moving around this *free* country looking
for one last slice of real freedom.  Fuck running. If there is a real concern
about the San Francisco scene getting busted, then something needs to be done here.  
There is so much fucking crime and bullshit going on in the city I can't believe they 
are wasting there money/resources/time on rave busting.   

I'm sure the general tax paying public would be interested if they knew
the SF cops were busy busting people having organized non-destructive fun, while
they where being robbed or drugs were being sold in the doorway and nothing
could be done, cuz all the cops were busy busting raves!

    I know what you mean!  I used to live in New England, and it seemed
    like any time the weather was nice enough to be outside, the Mosquito
    Air Force was there, and bug repellant just made them mad (so they'd
    bite harder).  And the bites would itch for a week or more...

    Next to the music scene, the best thing about living out here is
    have an outdoors worth being out in.

What I don't understand about mandatroy sentencing and the law is:  Why do
people stick around for these sentences?  If I was looking at hard time, i.e.,
5, 10, or 20 years of my young life, as in you get out and you've missed your
20s, I would leave and wait for statute of limitations to run out.  Or at least
I think I would.  What is the reason that I must be overlooking why people
don't do this?  Why stick around and let assholes put you in jail like that?

By the way, if we all know these people, is there any reason not to mention
who they are?  I mean, they've already been busted, right?  And it's not 
exactly gossuping, seems important to know who we should be supporting.

I know this is gettingh way off topic, but I live in the Mission in SF, and
we _DO_ have mosquitoes (or at least some similar flying, biting insects)
there- I like to have my windows open at night, but cannot now b/c I tend
to wake up bumpy and itchy. Does anyone know if they really are mosquitoes?
or what?

That's the way I feel about it. Here I am paying tax dollars out the
wazoo, and the police are spending lots of my paid-for time busting
people for consentual crimes or other non-violent fun while violence
is occuring all over.

How many people get raped in a day? How many people's lives get
violated in horrible ways? We don't have enough cops to fix it, and
they're harassing ravers?

I'm taking these thoughts, and I'm going to write the mayor, police
chief, and assembly members. I'm tired of seeing my money wasted while
this country slides further and further. Maybe if I explain how their
campaign contributions and votes depend on reform they'll listen with
a few brain cells. Maybe. But somebody's got to start doing something
about it.

This last Friday, we did a commercial hip-hop dance in still yet another
attempt to pay off our Meat Beat debt.  We didn't use the TASTE name at all,
just my contacts and production skills.  After the pie was divided between the
clothing shop we were working with, the radio station, and the piss-poor DJs I
was somehow convinced into hiring by the clothing shop, we ended up with $1000
to bring our debt down to $500.  So I guess it was worth it, but in other
senses, it wasn't.  Why?

1. Four fights.  We stopped the event after the last one at midnight.

2. Attitude, attitude, attitude.  It really sucked to see all these kids just
standing around.  Of course, the music wasn't great because I was selling
colas most of the night instead of pumping the sound system ;-).  But the
"hoofing" thingy was in full force.  Kids even rushed the stage at one point.
I would estimate that most of the night, only about 10 people out of 700 were
dancing at one time.

3. The biggest sound system we've ever rented and I didn't get an entire
minute to play with it.  I put on Strange Cargo for 30 seconds after the event
was over, before the cops *WE HIRED* told me to shut it off.

4. Drive by shooting while we were cleaning up.  A couple of kids in the
parking lot got hit in the legs.  This was the largest bummer of all.  What
amazed me was to see the ambulance arriving at the scene, with the *LIGHTS
OFF* and the cops *LEAVING* as soon as the shooting happened.

There were about three kids that came up to the concession booth saying how
they just wanted to dance and were disappointed at the crowd.  We told them
they were attending the wrong events :-), then we took down their addresses.

I'm looking forward to seeing everyone at Fluid Groove on the 5th.  Mike
Perkowitz and Mary stayed at my house that night on their way across the
country.  Looks like a genuine net.gathering is going to happen.

I'm also really psyched for Garth and Carlos with Taste on the 25th 8^)!!

Hey, I have no great love of the police, but try to remember that while there
are some macho, power-hungry, small pricked cops out there, most of them are
just honest guys and women trying to do their jobs. It's political pressures
that determine where the emphasis of law-enforcement lies, I'm sure the 
individual police officers have very little to do with deciding who they're
going to bust on a particular night.

Blame the system, not the poeple who make a living by enforcing it. And please
remember that in their hearts, alot of them believe that they're doing a good
positive thing by busting a rave and taking all of those innocent minors away
from an evil drug-infested environment.

Also, let's take a moment to consider that the promoters surely knew that they
were violating the SF curfew law, and knew that there was a good chance they
would get busted. They took $20 from each of those under-21 folks knowing full
well what might happen. Then, when the inevitable happened, the cops got the 
blame.

Now, as a disclaimer for that previous paragraph, I should state that I have
no idea what the promoters were actually thinking. Maybe they actually thought
they would get away with breaking curfew.

        The FMR will be _tomorrow_ night, Tuesday night/Wednesday morning,
not tonight, as had been rumored.  According to my calendar the day of the
full moon is Sept. 1st, so the party will be the night before, as according
to tradition.  NO decision has been made as to location yet, and this time I
won't be involved in that process :)

i finally had an opportunity to check out Boogie Buffet (sunday AM,
1015 Folsom St)... i like the light in the big room, but i wish they'd
put the energetic music in there.  in the dark, smaller room, i caught
about 20 minutes of Dubtribe, who tore it up.  they were followed by
Rick Preston, who spun a really great electronic set.

nice space, great music, near total lack of vibe.  oh well!

My calendar agrees with your, but one of my co-workers has a calendar that
says that the Full Moon is on August 31st (which would make the FMR tonight).

actually, i have a friend who was looking at going to court on LSD
charges about 7 years ago.  she moved here after going on tour
following the Dead for a while and started using a fake name.

starting a new identity is the easy part.  the hard part is cutting
all ties to the previous life --- if they "really" want to nail you,
something as simple as a phone call or a post card can land you in a
lot of hot water.

the statute of limitations for LSD is 7 years.  she went back home for
good about 3 months ago.

a good story: after she moved here, she went home to see her sister
get married.  sure enough, the DEA showed up at the wedding looking
for her, and she had to sneak out of the back and hide until they
left.  just one minor drawback to all this.  much better to get stupid
mandatory sentencing laws repealed.

I missed Donald's set but heard good things about it -- he was on
sometime around 1 from what I can determine, but I hadn't made it back
from Phish->North Beach Pizza at that point.  (More on my weekend in
another posting.)  I did chat with him after the end -- he said he
was probably flying back to Seattle last night but wasn't even sure
about that.  Would have been nice to see him playing Bulletproof or Cal's
last night.

    One rather visible thing we can do is to start setting up voter
    registration tables at raves.  This will plant the idea in the
    minds of the city government officials that we vote too.  It also
    implies a level of civic responsibility and all that, making it
    harder for them to paint us as a bunch of troublemakers.
    It might also require them to be a bit more careful if they bust
    us, lest they violate some election law.

Regardless, Brian talked to one of the Wicked people on the phone today
and that person said the party is Tuesday night.  Hope this clears up

This could be interesting; it sets up a nice platform
for other things like petitions.  Has anybody seen
this before ?  Does anybody have an idea about what
percentage of voting age ravers actually are registered ?

Well, that *might* be a reasonable position to take, but unfortunately
the net is a complex society which has evolved it's own set of rules
and customs...  know as "netiquette".

I'm afraid that whatever you think is or isn't reasonable, it is a
*fact* that within this electronic society posting private e-mail
without the senders consent is considered by many to be inapproriate
and rude.  In netspeak, it's a beach of netiquette.

There doesn't need to be any good reason for this fact.... societies
often have customs that are seemingly arbitrary, and you are of course
free to chalenge them.... but the society is unlikely to accept you if
you refuse to play by its rules...

That was my detatched view... now my opinion.... i think the status
quo (ie not posting private email without the senders consent) is a
Good Thing.  I think that personal attacks on individuals in a public
forum are a Bad Thing (again, some would regard this as a breach of
netiquette, though this one's more open to debate...)

This isn't intended as a flame, i really don't mean to offend anyone.

The light room is for chilling out, under the sun no less.  The music is
supposed to be Acid Jazz. So the "light" room isn't necessarily for people
who want to "go off".  Hell, they can do that it in the "dark" space.  Also
I've noticed that later in the day 1-3 the "light" room picks up a little
and the music is hella pumped.  When did you arrive?  How late did you
stay?

As for lack of vibe...I dunno.  BB is really for chilling out and
socializing with your friends/pals/whatever.  What I don't like is the NEW
price of $5!  That is not good.  Why should people be charged $4?  When it
first opened it was $3, then they moved it up to $4.  I was still
comfortable with that.  But now $5, for a daytime Sunday thang?  I'm gonna
find out what's up with that.

We did this once and it is EZ.  Go to the local voter registration office and
just tell them that you are doing an event and you'd like to register people
for the vote.  They'll give you several free books of forms and you just have
people fill them out as they come in the door.  This was right before the last
election and a LOT of people were grateful to have the opportunity.  If you
put it in front of their faces, they're more likely to sign up than if you
pester them with ads.

        Reading the past couple day's rave mail, I think the voting idea is
one of the most brilliant things discussed (other than Laura's YSH playlist
of course). Some friends of mine have their own theatre group and whenever
they have a show, afterwards in the lobby of the theatre they set up voter
registration. The key is to put this option right in front of people, so
they act on it spur of the moment, and lo and behold, they're registered to
vote. Doesn't necessarily mean anything will change, but the more voting
ravers, the better!!!!! Peace

I'm a bit shocked by all this talk of voter registration.  Are you
telling me that the onus is on the individual to apply to be allowed
to vote, rather than on the state to ensure that everyone can vote?
Are you saying that there are a substatial number of people who are
*unable* to vote in elections....?

I agree that we should set up voter registration booth or something,   but
now we need some volunteers to do it.    Any takers?   I think that we
can make a difference if enough people get off their guff and write to 
their local politician with their concerns,  things might actually happen.

The Cypherpunks through cooperation of the EFF,  CPSR are certainly making 
a difference in this Clipper chip privacy issues by letting these bozos know
their concerns.   But we have to get enough people to do this.  

Eventually,  our representitives will get on-line and things might be easier
for us to reach them.

Well!!  It certainly is possible to run a lot lower power and still reach out
to a wide area (up to 1000 ft) with as little as 50 milliwatts.   But it is
highly unlikeley that the signal if kept reasonably contained with proper
antenna placement would generate radio interference complaints.   The FCC
doesn't have the resources to drive all over creation busting little 5 watt
transmitter operators.   They usually act on complaints.    But outide raves
are usually held in more remote areas and if the antenna is placed low and
towards the center of the coverage area,   low power will still send out a
strong enough signal to operate a boom box or car FM radio very well at over
1000 feet.   So I know of few dance areas THAT large.

We used to do this at Peoples park in the early 80's,   and we covered the
area with as little as 100 milliwatts,  and we were able to recive the signal
fairly well at the Berkeley campus.   Although there were houses nearby,  we
kept the antenna close to the ground,   but within line of sight to the radios
that were recieving it.    It worked out very well,  we had no complaints and
I personally went over to a friends house next to Peoples park and checked
their
TV and there was no interference.    Simple responsible things like this can
eliminate possibilities of complaints.   The Xmitter was also fairly clean,
but don't know about Steve's design.    I personally met Steve a month ago and
looked at his design,  it was fairly straight forward,   and I think with
proper
shielding and construction,  interference won't be a problem.

As an Ex-ham radio nerd,  I have built many transmitters in my time,  and know
the pitfalls and gotchas.    Steve's workshop is pretty good and covers a lot
of these issues.   and I recommend that if anyone wants to try this to attend
one
of them.

Unfortunately, Steve's kits seem to be nonexistant except for the flagship 5
watt model.  Someone here ordered a $5 filter last month and still nothing has
shown up yet.  Another person on the net has dumped $70 on an order and hasn't
seen anything at all.  Do any Berkeley people know anything about this?

    Not at a rave,

    It might be interesting for a rave to offer a $1 discount to anyone
    who can show they are registered to vote somewhere and see how
    many takers you get.  That will be a lower figure, of course,
    since many registered voters can't find their voter registration
    card (you don't need it to vote, though it is the easiest-to-get
    proof of citizenship that is acceptable for international travel,
    and it's free, unlike a passport or certified copy of a birth
    certificate).

    A voter registration drive can register voters living in any county
    in California.  I live in San Mateo County, and registered as a
    San Mateo County voter, but I actually signed up in San Francisco
    at a voter registration drive here.

What I'm saying is, people have the right to vote, but to be able to vote
you must register to do so. Now, a lot of people don't take the initiative
to register, so when election day comes, they must pass on voting since
they aren't registered. Voters registration makes sense at raves, because
large groups of people can be registered without each of them making a trip
to City Hall to register. Roy, let's face the facts. A lot of Americans
simply do not exercise their right to vote. This is pathetic, I agree. But
if people are signing up to do so at raves, or other places where large
groups of people congregate, maybe they'll feel an obligation to do their
part and PARTICIPATE in the next election.
I agree, some Democracy.

    yes it is getting off the topic a bit but since there are no flame wars goin

    and yes they are mosquitoes.  i've actually stayed up, sitting very still
    until they buzz around and land on me or my sleeping girl friend then
    wack'em right after they stick thier blood sucking nozzle into flesh.
    if you're impatient and try to hit them too soon they'll just buzz off
    and bug you more later...i often wonder how such a small bug can make

    oh well, just something i do on long hot sleepness nites waiting for

In relation to transmitting on FM...

>If this is true, then it might be worthwhile
>trying to operate within the law...

I'm not familiar with CURRENT law,  but under part 15 rules,  they state that
it's legal to transmit for only a distance of 50 feet (Which really means
about 20 milliwatts or less).   But I doubt if it matters to push the distance
to 1000 feet if...   

  a) transmissions last through duration of rave and not all the time
  b) it won't interfere with existing services.
  c) and nobody makes a big stink about it.
  d) and we be discreet about it.

FCC doesn't have the resources to pick up such low power transmissions,  and
even if they did pick it up,   they would have to get an "Agent" out there
to catch the bootlegger in action.    Knowing that raves can happen ANYTIME,
mostly on weekends and late at night,  it is highly unlikeley they would act.

I know this from talking to our local agent at the last CFP (Computers
Freedom and Privacy conference) where I met one of them and asked him this
very question.   He was fairly straight forward and was open with his
information.   The FCC is mostly concerned with higher power transmissions
that might interefere with Aircraft,  military and other services.

Most home brew transmitters are "dirty" and will transmit on many frequencys
unless a proper filter is used.   Construction of such can be trickey,  and
not always straight forward.

I don't know,   but I can contact Steve and ask him what the status is when
I get the chance.    I have his home number and will try and find out
if you like.

WOW!!  Incredable idea,   Hmmm!   How would I show that I regestered.  I
suppose I could contact the registrar of voters and find out,   but we have
to convince the rave promoters to allow the discount.   Do you think they
would go for it?

I get a kick out of watching  Roy discover the "real" America through the net..

In answer to your question, there are many people who don't register to vote
on time or at all, then when election day comes they can't and don't vote.
Trouble is, these tend to be the kinds of people who would offset the votes
of right-wing, facist, religious zealot, republicans (or any como thereof).

In the UK the government conducts a census every two years or so to
compile the electoral roll.  Every home in the UK is sent a
questionaire on which they have to list all people over 16 who are
living there on a particular date.  It's a criminal offense to fail to
respond to the questionare, and they make it pretty hard to forget...
they keep sending you reminders and duplicate questionaires.....

Of course, some people *deliberately* avoid returning the forms, or
leave themselves off the forms, because they want to effectively be
"unpersons" to try and avoid paying taxes....  It's pretty futile,
though, because if you ever have a job or claim any kind of state
benefit then the state will find out your name and address anyway....

By the way, does California select jury pools based on voter
registration?

This is an issue that's very important to me. I (loudly) don't vote in states
that do this, because I feel it fouls up the jury pools.

I guess the important question is, would these people vote if the
system didn't require them to register in advance?  We have a problem
with voter apathy too, but i don't think it's quite as bad as yours.
I don't have any figures to hand, though.  Our system requires less
effort on the part of the voter though....

A couple of people mentioned to me in e-mail that there are plans for
the DMV to register voters.  This still doesn't seem ideal to me,
since it will still exclude people who don't drive or own a car, which
will still but a skew on the results.....  But i guess it'll be
interesting to see whether more people vote as a result of it....

It's Official: All Permits Have Been Obtained for Marx Meadows, Sunday, 
October 3rd.  I didn't have to lie at all and managed to avoid the R-word 
as well.  But it was close.  Navigating the beauracratic maze at the Hall 
of Justice yesterday, I found myself in the company of a police sargeant 
who after looking over the application asked me "What's SFR?".  I started 
babbling about how we're a group of people who use computers over a network 
to communicate...blah, blah, blah...which is why I couldn't put down an 
address for the 'organization' blah, blah...  His eyes started to glaze over 
and he mumbled "Oh, I was just wondering what SFR stood for." But at this 
point he had lost interest and was eager to be rid of me, so I never had to 
answer his question.

The current DJ Lineup is: Lee An, Markie Mark, Jon Drukman, all SFRavers.  

I'll post the list of $ contributors later in the week, so that those 
who haven't given can be suitably humiliated.  I've received about $250 
so far, about $150 short of break-even.  Any extra $ will probably go 
towards fruit & stuff to be shared.  If there's a lot of extra $, then 
I'll put it towards another event!

We are only permitted for amplified sound from 1-5pm, but I'm gonna try 
to start early and end a little late if I can.  The party *may* continue at 
another location, but this is not yet certain.  The only thing that
can really stop us is the weather.  I'll be establishing a phone # shortly.

If anyone wants to bring voter registration stuff into the fray, that
would be great.  We're not allowed to be selling or soliciting stuff, and 
we're responsible for cleaning up after ourselves and removing garbage from
the premises.  I'll be bringing plenty of garbage bags.

Close :-). It's legal to inform the jury of their duties, but it is also
legal for the judge to essentially lie by telling them that their *only*
duty is to judge the case on the basis of the facts. It's also legal for
the judge to put anyone who tries to tell the jury of their duty to
judge the law as well in contempt of court. That's why if we want to
get to whoever-it-was's friends' jury, we would have to pamphlet
outside the courthouse.

The precedent was set for this duty in England, in fact, in a case
involving William Penn and freedom of speech. The jury refused to convict
him under an extremely restrictive speech law, and they were thrown in
jail, fined, etc. The case was appealed up to the highest court in the
land and they ruled that the jury had the right to rule however they
wishd, even against the law. Note that this does not strike down the
law, like when the Supreme Court rules a law unconstitutional. It only
lifts it for this particular case.

As long as we're registering voters, how about putting some FIJA flyers
out? I have several dozen..  }:-)

Hmmm...my understanding was that any broadcast up to 1/2 a watt
did not need an FCC license. That's from an article in the East Bay
Express a few weeks back about pirate radio and Steve.

I would love to hear more about these kits, as I am interested 
in maybe seting up a 1/2 watt kit myself...

Hi SFRavers...
I just finished building the FreeRadioBerkeley kit (after 3 weeks of
hacking on it and dealing with problems in the instructions, a couple
of missing parts, etc. It works GREAT, with a solid 5 watt output (had it
up to 12 watts for a few seconds but turned it down to save the power 
transistor and prevent a conflagration at the homestead :) and virtually
NO drift. I'd advise the folks waiting for kits to bug Stephen via email
at stephenpd@aol.com, bearing in mind that this is the GENESIS of
a nationwide micro-radio movement, and I'm sure that he is overwhelmed
(by kit production AND legal issues dealing with his defense against the
ludicrous $20,000 FCC fine). I am working on gathering my notes/mail 
regarding my construction problems/solutions into a doc, and will 
upload it to the FTP site shortly.
As far as converting the FRB kit to stereo, I heard that it can be done
by disabling the audio pre-emphasis circuit on the FRB kit and running
a stereo generator (like the Panaxis SG kit) into the FRB audio input.
I'm getting ready to tackle that one shortly.
FRB probably jumped the gun a bit with the kit offers, but that's what
happens when you get hyperactive hyperintellectual electrical engineers
at the forefront of a movement... You can always go the FM-10 route,
and buy a low-output Ramsey Electronics FM stereo kit and then build all
of the FM-10 pirate toys to boost the output.
Peace

I wasn't at corduroy city, but I do have a song that sounds like what
you're describing. It's called "Harmania" by Son of God. As for the sample,
I'm not 100% sure, but it does sound a lot like it was taken off the
"Mindbomb" single.

I missed the beginning of this thread about fm transmitters--what do they
have to do with voter registration?  

The subject line caught my attention, though.  I just today ordered a
Ramsey FM10 kit, to broadcast our next rave to the neighborhood...and
beyond...  The kit only puts out a few milliwatts, but mods to increase
output to 1 watt appear fairly straightforward.  I'd heard about 
Stephen's kit, but too impatient to wait :-)

I like the idea of the $1 discount to registered voters, though as a
promoter who lost money on the last two raves, it's a scary concept.  

To those of you who have avoided voter registration in order to avoid jury
duty:  when you vote in a jury, your views, your opinion, and your beliefs,
can mean the difference between some poor shmuck getting railroaded, or
getting justice.  When you vote in a jury, you lay yourself on the line for
what you believe in.  Do you know that the outcome of cases to test new 
laws have major influence in how those laws are applied in the future?  
In an election voting booth, you can only say what your opinion is, yes 
or no, and diluted by millions of others.  In the jury room, you can say 
what your opinion is, why you feel that way, and help influence the out-
come of something that might change a person's, a family's, even a
community's life forever.  The society you work to influence is the society
you live in.  Jury duty is a *privilege* to be cherished, not a chore to be
avoided.

Subject: Orbital - Back to the basics!
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU





What follows is a little bit if music history and music composition
dialog, so if you aren't interested, don't care, or already
familiar with Steve Reich, you may want to delete now.

I just picked up the new Orbital CD this weekend and WoW!
I think the most interesting songs on the CD are the first
and last songs - 'Time becomes' and 'Input out'.

These two songs utilize a fundamental electronic music concept
called phasing, in which two looped samples are played simultaneously
and one of the samples is either slightly shorter or slightly 
pitched down causing the two samples then to slowly get 'out
of phase' and then slowly work there way back 'into phase', as
the faster loop catches up again with the slower one.

This very simple composition technique can produce surprisingly
complex sequences as the two samples journey around each other
in time and space (if in stereo).

Steve Reich is probably considered the father of phasing. He 
recorded the first ever phasing composition back in 1965 here
in San Francisco called 'It's Gonna Rain', and shortly followed
by the ever popular 'Come Out' in 1966.

Excerpt from CD booklet about 'Come Out':

"Composed in 1966, it was originally part of a benefit presented
at Town Hall in New York City for the re-trial, with lawyers of 
their own choosing, of the six boys arrested for murder during the
Harlem riots of 1964. The voice is that of Daniel Hamm, now aquitted
and then 19, decribing a beating he took in Harlem's 28th precinct
station. The police were about to take the boys out to be "cleaned
up" and were only taking those that were visibly bleeding. Since Hamm
had no actual open bleeding he proceeded to squeeze open a bruise on
his leg so that he would be taken to the hospital. Sample follows -

"I had to like open the bruise up and let some of the bruise blood
come out to show them." With "come out to show them" the actual
sample that is looped and phased.

Two other phasing projects he worked on "Piano Phase" and "Clapping
Music" are performance pieces that are actually performed by
live musicians. "Piano Phase" is two piano players playing the same
monophonic piano pattern as one stays put, and the other slowly changes
the tempo creating the phasing effect. "Clapping Music" is two musicians
clapping a rythmic pattern and one of the patterns is missing a single
beat. This creats a totally different phasing effect.

All of these pieces are incredibly interesting and as shown by
Orbital, way ahead of their time. They can be heard on the highly
recommended CD by Steve Reich called "Early Works".

It is really cool to see some of the Techno musicians picking up
on some interesting alternative forms of composition. I can't 
wait to hear a techno 'Markov Process' song. Hmmm. Maybe a good
project to work on...

In my Electronic Music class in school, we were given a phasing
assigment. I looped a sample from the Art Of Noise - "Hey! Can
I Say Something - Woop Woooo". I think I still have this laying
around somewhere if anyone else out there is interested in 
alternative music composition.

Well, thats it for Music Comp 101 tonight. See ya

Actually, some people call this effect phasing but it is a flanger effect.
Phasing is when you play one source and the second source is the same, with
the second beeing out of phase with the first, but both playing at the same
speed. Usually done with an fx box or a computer. Flanging on the other hand,
is two sources (same) that start playing a little out of phase and as time
passes the difference of phase will grow, then shrink, then grow, etc...

(It's only time they do what Techno DJs have been doing for a while)

This effect is as old as reel to reel. I even have a technical note from
Viking on flanging with 2 reel to reel. "Then, by slightly touching the
second flange, you will obtain a variation..." blah blah blah. It is why it
has been called flanging, because of the flange. Oh and the technical note is
from 1959. And since then, it has been used a lot by DJs. As for Markov process
well, you never know! So much has been done (from interactive music, to FSK
modulations, to brownian movements, to pink noise etc...).

One can easily achieve flanging with either 2 reel to reel or 2 turntables.
It is also present on most fx box worth mentioning. On any decent computer,
you have software to do it.

 As all I have is the calender from last week , and I need to edit it 
and get it reproduced ,etc. - I need any info about events that are
happening Sept 2 through Sept 6 , that weren't mentioned on last

hi,

I remember those Reich pieces, as I had to "study" them (NOT a problem)
when I was a Electronic music student at UCSC & SFSU.  I think, now that
you mention it, that there is alot of cool compositional ideas and even
direct samples from the early era of electronic music.  The musique
concrete (no accent, sorry) of Pierre Henri (???) and his other compatriot
in Paris did some tape music that *longs* for a spot on an amibient-like
record.  There is also a cool piece by a hispanic composer whose name
I can't recall called something like "bebe cola"  that uses that (title)
phrase in a whole bunch of ways that could be added as a chant/chorus
type thing on a house jam.  now that  you mentioned it, that whole era
 is ripe for sample fodder.  What studio are you working in?

Chris

Ooooo it appears I have said something not PC.

I believe that everyone should do what they believe is right. My
political agendas aren't yours. Some people believe that military
service should be a civilian obligation. Some believe that voting is a
civilian obligation. Some believe that jury duty is a civilian
obligation. Some people believe that serving a deity is a civilian
obligation. 

I don't necessarily believe or disbelieve any of these things. I have
definite opinions, and I act upon them because my conscience demands
it.

I don't recall telling anyone on this list what I think they should
do. Unless you understand my political agenda _in_depth_ and have
explored thoroughly my personal reasons for doing so, I'd appreciate
it if you didn't tell me what you think I should do. You're making me
feel as if you're trying to convert me to some religion.

A nice, friendly, in-person conversation on the matter would be much
more enlightening. My views are not fixed in stone, and they can
respond to persuasion. But they won't respond to "You should do this."
or "Everyone should do this." I'm constantly surrounded by that kind
of stuff every day. It's actually quite a bit of static for one life.

There are a couple newsgroups dedicated to pirate radio stations
which you may want to peruse.  I don't have the info handy, but
the FAQ's provide exactly what you need to setup and operate a
legal pirate radio station.  I think the maximum wattage you can
put out is 100??

Wouldn't it be wierd if everyone wore walkmans and the D.J's pumped
out the sound over the airwaves (heh, an air-rave) to a bunch of
ravers dancing to only the sound they could here.  That would sure
be interesting to watch. . ..

From the huge ever growing pulsating brain of Francois Dion:

Yes and No! The flange can be thought of as phasing, but the flange is more
of an effect or sound process and phasing can be thought of more as a
compositional process or tool. Generally, the flange represents very small
amounts of phase difference in which the two sources being played do not
differ by more than several milliseconds. To get the flanging effect that
DJ's use, one source remains constant while the other source is sped up
and the slowed down centering around the constant source, never letting
the two become completely out of phase. Just enough so that you here
this "flanging" effect.

Have you heard the Reich pieces? I doubt if anyone would categorize these
as flanging techniques. Sure flanging has been around for a very long
time, but the Reich pieces are important because they were the first 
pieces to use phasing as the sole fundamental compositional technique.

The point I was trying to make is that it is nice to see modern pop composers,
using some of the techniques pioneered by the founding fathers of electronic 
music.

> One can easily achieve flanging with either 2 reel to reel or 2 turntables.

The techniques used by Reich were  accomlished using tape loops.
Both loops are from the same source, but one loop has a slightly shorter
endpoint, therefore the pitches of the samples do not have to be changed.
A computer could do this easily, but the flange on most effects boxes that
I have seen, could not accomplish this effect at all.

And dont forget that humans can phase too. (Hey, how about this for a pickup
line - "Would you like to uh phase with me" :)  )

The song "Piano Phase" is two piano performers who start off playing the same
melody and then one of them changes the tempo until the two melodies are
completely out of phase. This is very difficult to do. It is a natural human
tendancy to avoid phasing and play along with the other performer.

Well, it is time for me to 'phase' out -

See ya on the back side of the moon -

Actually,  Sean Casey has some totally awsome headphones that put an
awsome amount of bass into your ears.    Sean!!  How much do they cost,
anyway....?

By the way,  while talking to some dudes at the FMR last night,  I get word 
that "Massive Culture" is a big farce!!   And that I should go to "Basics"
instead.    Is "Basics" at an outside venue?    Where was it held last time?

I also have a friend from Pennsylvania who I am turning onto raving for the
first time,  and I'll be bringing him (And her) to YSH this Thursday.   And
will either go to Massive Culture or Basics depending on advice from you folks
in sfraves.    I suspect that Massive Culture will be outside and Basics will
be inside.

They also plan on attending the Sci-Fi convention in SF next week.

Cheers..

Hey, all!

 I thought there might be some people looking for work; to change jobs;
or for a temporary(?) position.

My company, HaL Computer Systems, Inc. is looking for a senior circuit
design engineer (what's that?).

HaL's ok- lots of cool people, located in the South Bay (Campbell), a wear
whatever you want, ingest whatever you want kind of place. I have no 
influence outside of a witty smile, but I can talk to or point you to 
people who do.

Anyway, if any of you want more info- email me at jocelyn@hal.com

Sorry to waste bandwidth!

ATTENTION: Massive Culture has been cancelled. Apparently, the permits were 
revoked a day or two ago by the town council(?) of Livermore. The promoters 
are discussing whether or not they will sue the city for damages.

Don't disappoint yourself: don't go!

...for this weekend, and the big sound system for rave t00nz _will_ be there.
I'm sure people have heard about it, but for those that haven't: it's in
the Black Rock desert north of Gerlach, NV.  Lots of people, dust, dancing,
madness, and the Man which was about 2.5 stories tall last year and should
be even bigger this year if preparations are any indication.  I recommend
it for an experience broader than "drive, dance, drive".  Anyone else from
the area going?  I've got my ride, but it's far enough away that carpooling
is essential for those who might want to go.  Friday through Monday morning,
suggested donation is $40 to cover insurance, BLM fees, the Man, etc.

I don't have a contact #: I know one was posted earlier.  I'll be there 
with drums, water, food, friends, and RaveLite (a Radio Shack super-hi-
intensity LED powered by AAA batteries -- runs forever and is as bright as
a small flashlight, not to mention being a kool red color).  Moon will
be nearly full, desert will be vast, time will be suspended.  See you there.

i like the idea of registering people to vote at raves, but our registering
isn't really going to maean a thing for us as ravers unless we organize as
ravers to protect our parties by holding our elected officials accountable -
after all - how do we know their positions on rave-busting? it's not exactly
on the evening news... people have suggested that we write, but i think
unless this is an organized effort it won't go very far... we need to choose
our targets, finding out who can do what for us and demand it....
i would also be interested in having mandatory minimum petitions, or better
yet, letter-pwriting tables, set up at eveents... i can do this at ysh if
someone sends me the info..... i'm also wondering if it's feasible to have
some kind of protest about this - outside the courtroom? i think it's
important for thsoe of us who are willing to be open about our support for
psychedelics (if not about our use ) to do so, or at least be open about our
stand against mand. mins..... i'm really pissed off right now cuz i'm feeling
like the dea just came in and grabbed someone from our community and HOW ARE
WEFIGHTING BACK/RESISTING AS A COMMUNITY? are we? or are we just going to
gossip about this and say, "that sux.." i have lots of experience doing
political organizing and if otherz are interested, i'd like to plan
something...i'm new here, tho, so i really do need help, being unfamiliar
with san francisco....
pleaz email me or call 621-4703 if you're interested - maybe we could set up
a kind of raverz response group whenever we're busted or something.... (BTW,
it's probably better to call me cuz i'm only logged in occassionally, since
my computer is busted :( )

ALSO, i have an idea: is it possible to have a political demonstration/rave?
like, we could get permits to have a demo demang our right to dance and
freely assemble, and of course at a demo you need a sound system, and we
could have a few speakers bt mostly have musick... it doesn't have to be
huge, it could be a lot of fun, w could be putting some pressure on, (like,
if you don't let us have our parties we're going to continue with these demos
- and hell, if they ignore us, well, it's still a good party:) ).....

has this ever been tried? what do people think? obvioussly , the event would
be heeavily policed and thus have to be drug free (or at least visibly drug
free), so we'd have to let people know this...anyway, at least we'd have a
good party and demonstrate our opp. to man mins. or whatever we want..

Your right Monica, If the DEA thinks that they can just start busting people
without some noise being made, then they will bust more people.
I'm not talking about hindering them from doing their job in any way, but
It is our duty to protect people in our community from rediculous entrappment
and set ups.  If anyone knows the situation that just went down, it is a case in
point on how arbitrary this whole mess with enforcement of drug laws really is.
It is obviously more about curtailing certain forms of social behavior then 
about protecting people.

Look at all the shit over the gunman at 101 California.  When there is some
crazy  shooting and killing people, the cops take there own good time getting
there, but I bet if someone called and told them that some kids were having
a Rave in the lobby they would call out the riot squad, (like they did at
Pulgas water temple).  I've been in the habit lately of asking cops when
they come to places like YSH whether they have more important things to do
like chasing muggers and rapest then hassleing a bunch of people dancing in a
dirty warehouse.

Good idea.
It is high time that people strt to question the drug laws, specifically
the laws around mandatory sentencing for LSD and other psychedelics.

It is INSANE that a person can get more time for selling a someone a sheet
of acid, then shooting someone in an armed robbery.

This is an old DJ trick, quite often overdone. All you have to do, as
Francois has described above, is take two copies of the same record and
match them up. At that point, you can either run the copy together with
the master out of phase, or flange it with the pitch control. Both create
interesting effects.

	It's been my impression all along that Massive Culture

Hi Dana and gang,

I'm going to be down in LA this weekend (Sep 3-6) and was wondering if
anyone had any pointers for rave happenings and/or where to go for
flyers.  Maybe I'll finally get to judge for myself how the LA scene
compares to SF's!

Share and Enjoy,

Tim

This starts Thursday with Your Sisters House and goes through today's
Blue Moon Rave . . .

I took my old friend and former housemate John to his *first* Grateful
Dead show and r*** on Thursday night.  He got off pretty well on both,
though he only stayed at YSH for about half an hour.  I thought this
YSH was much less congenial than the TAZ one I attended a couple weeks
ago, and I missed Laura's sets, but did catch Jan Cooley
for her long turn.  It was a struggle, with a narrow gallery space,
various interruptions and the inability of the crowd to really get a
consistent vibe going.  Plus it was Sweatbox City . . . but I had
a good time anyway.

Friday night I crashed at Bob Ramstad's after the last of the three
Dead shows at Shoreline.  We then made our way over to the Greek Theatre
and got in the front of the line for the Phish show -- it was great to be
back in my 'home' venue for the GD on a fine evening.  We did the post-
show prandial thang at North Beach Pizza, after which I took a brief nap,
then rallied to head over to Funky Techno Tribe at the Design Center.

I arrived around 3:15, just in time to find that a couple of cops had
gone in to sweep out the under-21 crew inside.  This led to a rather
amazing hour of confusion.  First the under-21s were herded out, and
they proceeded to set up shop on the sidewalk and in the street, basically
hanging, dancing to tunes from a car stereo and waiting to see what would
happen next.  What happened next was that lots of other people also came
out and were then instructed to come back in through the 'security' line.

While this was going on in generally disorganized fashion, quite a few
people slipped through the 'out' door back inside.  Ultimately it seemed
like most anyone who really wanted to get in did so eventually.

I was impressed with the Design Center space -- a large four-story high
atrium.  Shredder sound and a consistently high-quality DJ list helped
insure that things weren't a total loss for the evening.  By about 5:30
Phil Smart had things really moving, and then Tony took over for another
superb set.  Mr. B. Positive himself, Carlos, and many others of us took
to the floor with abandon as the daybreak started to manifest itself
through the skylights.  The one rather distracting aspect was the number
of people who basically just hung around doing nothing much of anything.
Unlike jslee, I would say that some under-21 and some over-21 types were
involved here.  Just what the heck are people doing going out until 6 am
to stand around and look bored while the rest of us get down with the
sound on the floor or at least go around and have a conversation or two?
I sure don't know but it puts a bit of a damper on the levels . . .

Tony shut down around 7:15, so I headed over to Boogie Buffet.  A slow
start that morning, by the time I left at 10 it was still rather sparse.
But I had an interesting conversation with Rick Webb, the manager, who
turned out to be old friends with a guy I met at the Dead shows (who was
also in town for the Interop network trade show) and was bemusedly taking
in the r*** scene.  Rick has some interest in getting things going on a
tribal tip, which is where I personally think the next wave of excitement
is going to be.

After a quick nap, I tried to glom onto the monthly Bulletproof boat party.
On Friday I'd hoofed it over to BPM to buy a ticket at Bulletproof's
upstairs
counter, only to discover they've pulled out and only have the Haight St.
store now.  Rick Webb had clued me in to a before/during/after party
alongside
the boat trip at Cal's (2001 Union at Buchanan), basically a college
bar which has been taken over as a sort of cool r*** hangout the last couple
of Sundays.  I wasn't able to get a ticket to the sold-out boat trip but
did drop in on the before and after party scene for a while.  This is a
promising space for the usually barren Sunday evening slot . . .

I was in Sacramento on Monday and Tuesday to do some work.  When I arrived
back in SF last night, I was faced with a quandary.  Didn't want to miss
yet another FMR, but I had a plane to catch at 8:00 this morning.  Nor did
I have a ride to the FMR, wherever it might be.  A series of inquiries
soon revealed that the rumored Bonnie Doon location was in fact the
destination.  I called the Together line and found that Simon, Garth and
Neon Leon (?!) were the listed DJs -- which meant that it had to be the
jumping-off point for the FMR.  With nothing to lose, I headed down and
met up with Lee Fogel's brother and another friend.  After checking the
Together scene briefly (in the basement of Big Heart City), we took off
for parts coastal . . .

Arrived at around 3 am to find Route 1 lined with dozens of cars and the
sound system on the beach just firing up.  I had not been to any beach
event yet that actually went off, and with the perfect weather I figured
things would go off in a big way, seeing as how this was at the faled
Bonnie Doon site.  As it turned out, the experience was less than optimal
for the first few hours.  In spite of the superb location and weather,
the crowd seemed to be mostly locals who were more interested in yammering
constantly with each other than getting into the music and surroundings.
In addition, the Nitrous Factor was off the scale.  In a relatively small
crowd I counted at least five separate tanks going at one point.  One or
two might have been OK, but this level of activity definitely put a damper
on things.

In addition, Markie was spinning some of his weirdest stuff and the crowd
was just not getting off on it.  Given my perhaps over-inflated expectations
this was a great disappointment, because it's hard to imagine a nicer
location.  When Jeno started up, however, things seemed to improve as the
hang-out crowd dissipated and the in-the-groove posse started to do its
thing.  It's also likely that my lack of sleep over the last couple of
days colored my reaction.  In any event, Jeno and Garth both provided
consistently solid, relaxed grooves that were conducive to dancing,
sedate toe-tapping and wandering around the site.  Around 9 I found myself
barefoot with my pants legs hitched up, strolling through the surf to the
sublime "Walking on Sunshine" remix . . . a great moment!  Garth
finally shut down around 11:30 and we slowly moved on out and back to the
City.  I was dropped off at BPM and ran into Cin and Mike on a record-
shopping expedition -- and that's it for the diary here!

It's pretty apparent that the scene in SF has hit a kind of plateau for
the time being.  The burst of energy that followed Malachy's accident
seems to have run its course.  I see a lot more non-participative attendance
at events, the DJs are getting a little complacent in their selections, and
in general things seem to be sort of in the doldrums.  But under the surface
I can also see some potentially good new directions.  YSH represents the
emergence of a new kind of non-commercially oriented but nonetheless regular
party, while the trance/tribal scene has yet to emerge in the way I suspect
it will.  The club scene is actually fairly healthy -- a good many of the
weeklies like Boogie Buffet, Together and Mission Rock are sustaining a nice
presence in the scene.  

As for me, the signs are pretty apparent that it's time to 'go home' and see
what kind of good stuff I can help stir up in the Northwest.  The recent
efforts by the Groove Kitchen crew to do some events in Eugene and Portland
bodes well for more of a true West Coast scene than isolated units.  

At the same time, the pressures and dangers apparent from the greed factor,
the growing popularity of nitrous on a petty retail level, resistance from
the authorities on permit and curfew matters, an influx of newcomers with
little clue or inclination about how to take advantage of and add to the
scene, are all worrisome reminders of the supertransient nature of the
scene.  It's a fragile flower . . .

Sorry for the wasted bandwidth, but i'd be grateful if someone could
id this choon for me...

Sort of happy house, i would guess a few months old.  Sounds like the
sort of thing that might have had commercial success, though i don't
follow the dance charts, so i don't know....

There are two lyrics ....

One begins "We've got to, got to move these feet,..." (not sure about the rest).

The other is "2 weeks for love"


	Thanks in advance....

I'm going too! with wife & daughter ( age 5 ), we're all totally jazzed.
The contact number is 415-985-7471; when I called yesterday, they said
that while advance ticket sales are closed, you can pay at a casino/gas
station in Gerlach, NV, 20 miles from the site.  Remember its a 7 hour 
drive, WAY out in the desert, bring 1 gallon of water per person per day,
(and that doesn't even account for rave H20 req'ts :) ).  We'll be driving
an 89 black Ford Probe adn camping near the northwest compass point on the
outer ring road, if possible.  sfravers, drop by!

  Well!!  Now that Massive Culture is not happening,   will there be any
Techo-house stuff at the "Burning Man" event in Nevada?   Was thinking
of going there this weekend.  Will it be happening all weekend?

Hello again,

After sleeping for pretty much 30 hours, I've recovered from Tuesday's
Full Moon Rave out here in San Francisco.  

Anyway, I came out here thinking that things would be vastly different 
at West Coast raves from East Coast ones.  Postings from other visiting 
ne-ravers served to further strengthen this preconception.  Well, now that
I've been to an actual event, I must say that there *basically* is no 
difference between a good party here and a good party back home.

The FMR was held on a beautiful beach along a secluded stretch of coastline.
The beach area was ringed by cliffs, and the sand was soft and the water
blue and cold.  We don't have *quite* the same geography back home, but
various parties held in forests and on mountainsides at home were each
gorgeous in their own unique ways, too.

The music started promptly at 3.00 am (and I understand that this was sort of 
an exeception to what usually happens at the FMR's . . . often the music
doesn't get going 'till closer to 4), and there were a lot of people there.
Where we'd usually have 50-300 people at a party in the East, they had more
like 300-500 people.  Still, if you looked at the ratio of people dancing to
those just laying in the sand, it was pretty much the same fraction of people
dancing in SF as there are at good parties in New York (like the B2B parties).

The people were no more or no less friendly than I've experienced in New
York, and the vibe was quite similar too.  Sure, the party went on till
way after 10.00 am -- but if you figure we start at 11pm back east and they
start at 3am in SF, you get about the same number of music-hours in either
way.  Furthermore, a lot of people arrived at the FMR site around sunrise,
so there was an influx of new well-rested peole to keep things going, whereas
that sort of thing doesn't happen back East.

Although the music was rather different -- varying flavors of low-bpm'ed 
housey stuff -- the crowd responded in the same ways to their local favorites
as we do to ours back east.  I personally didn't dance much, about 15 minutes
to some very white-noisy/mindfucky/acid stuff spun by Markie Mark, and then
a bit more after sunrise, but a lot of other people got a lot of enjoyment
out of what was played.

I need to have my body and brain tweaked a lot by harder tunes before I can
get to the point where I can enjoy house music (the non-vocal/non-piano
break variety) . . . around sunrise Brian and I climbed to the headlands
overlooking the beach and stood on the point where the sun would first
break.  As the sun came over the rim of cliffs, I felt warm and happy and
picked up on the house groove and danced a bit on the edge of the cliffs in
the warm sun (I'd been FREEZING all night).

We left a few hours later, around 10 am.  I was completely exhausted from
being so cold all night and walking around in the shifting sands.  It was
nice and all, but I really did miss the energy and drive of my favorite
types of music.  To each their own . . . the important things were that
the party went off well and that people seemed happy.

Laura

Once again, let's meet for dinner before Your Sister's House.  Brian
says that we should meet at the "usual" place, La Azteca.  Since Brian
has class until 8.00, we Berkeleyites won't be showing up until 8.30,
but the rest of you call can turn up whenever you get hungry I suppose!

Also, I'm spinning tonight again, but don't know when I am coming on.
>From looking at the flyer it looks like I will be first (10.00 pm), I'll
call Liz and ask and will post details later.

I absolutely agree with Mike about Markie's set -- it was great, but I tend
to be in the "weirder the better" crowd as far as this music goes, and
Markie has an absolutely unique record collection and approach to spinning
so I really get off when he goes into orbit.

My definition of 'tribal' may differ somewhat from Mike's.  Since I don't
know much about artists and titles I can't name the names I'd specify as
onna tribal tip, but I've been hearing more and more of it on tapes lately
(maybe that's not the best way to gauge the currency of the scene, of
course).  Nonetheless, I have ulterior motives here, because I think
tribal will go over big-time in the Northwest if anything really gets
moving up here.

One other thing I'm seeing more of in the tribal tradition, and this is
a good trend in the scene, is people bringing drums and providing a
live counter-component to the records.  I've seen this at Boogie Buffet,
YSH and elsewhere, and it works quite well to feather the edges of the
relentlessly perfect beats we hear from the records.

> Markie was spinning some of his weirdest stuff and the crowd
> was just not getting off on it.
I think Markie did a terrific job.  Some of the stuff he played was insanely
weird yet worked very well.  (That track with the motorcycle sound effects
was mindblowing, imho.)  His set did get a bit housy for me towards the end,
but it appeared to me that the crowd was very receptive to it.  (Dancing on
sand is very difficult, though, which is why the dancing never *looks* very
energetic when parties are thrown at Bonnie Dune.)

> In any event, Jeno and Garth both provided

Agreed, but I was really looking forward to hearing one of Jeno's relentless
acid sets rather than the toetapping house stuff.  Oh well, maybe next month.

The trance/tribal scene peaked in the summer of '92.  (Listen to the Vision 
tapes.)  I'm not sure if anyone even *makes* tribal anymore.  I think the
musical future (as Jon Drukman predicted a few weeks ago) will be a move
towards the style that Markie was playing at the FMR (the Freaky Chakra record
being a perfect example of this style).

so it will be starting a bit later and won't be a sweatbath this time.
Dress warmly!  I'll be going on around 2am I hear.  Call the phone line
(415)-765-7670 for details.

Even though things are starting later, dinner plans remain unchanged.  
La Azteca around 8.30 ish.

okay.. aside from the fact that if you want info about LA stuff
you should get the So-Cal raves calendar from 
jvance@uci.edu aka Joachim

Prime CUts is on Santa Monica
everything else is on melrose
just walk up and down melrose and pop into whatever
record and other stores are there
that you see flyers lying around

then ignore most of the fliers there
the list is much better it has comentary
make a print out and drive around with it

The trance/tribal revival happened in the fall of '92.  How'd you miss it?

I spent last weekend in Austin TX visiting some old and new friends.
Immediately following a final exam, I red-eyed it to texas and went to
a play called Snake Eyes, a sci-fi parable based on a Bruce Sterling
story about what becomes of people who have been given direct brain
implants that enable them to control fighter planes, the process is
called the Extended Human Interface Training System, pronounced
"E-hits".  Lots of cool computer graphics as the victim / trainees
grapple with the "snake" - the foraces let loose by the biological
implant, which ultimately reveals to them, not the evil interventions
of a computer, but the ultimate challenge, their own nature free of
restraint.  Way fun.  

Then off to the countryside for the Radiance party; the first outdoor
production by folks who have been doing club & warhouse raves in
Austin over the past year or so.  The site was truly godlike: 20 acres
at the end of a 2 mile dirt road which was off a little farm road 8
miles off the two-lane blacktop.  They had a 220-volt outlet and a
bathroom and shower a couple hundred yards back up the road.  Not much
shade, but some trees along the river for a camping area, a largish
swimming hole, free of unexpected rocks, and a big field with the
dance area & dj stage at one side.  The "stage" had a big dropcloth
with the "Blammo" muplitple slide-show projected on it from behind.
People parked along one side of the field ( note: no shuttle van
needed ).  And they had the worlds freshest, newly dug, smell-free
outhouses not too far away, and water available at all times.  An
ambient sound system was promised for the swimming area; while we were
waiting for the main sound system, they put on a variety of music,
from ragamuffin to Glenn Branca-type noiz.  A major high point came in
the late afternoon when they put on some 70s funk and a dozen of us
started backstrokin' in the swimming hole.  "Give Up the Funk" never
sounded so good as it did in greeenish-brown water with little fishies
nibbling at our flesh.

People were trickling in towards evening.  The dj's started up around
9:30 or so, with not much dancing until about 11.  I floated around,
danced a while, talked to the smart-drink and face-painting vendors,
joined the drum circle for a bit.  About 12:30 I went off with a few
folks to do "door" duty for a while. The "door" was a few folding
chairs by the side of the dirt road, 1/2 mile up from the campsite.
There was nobody much arriving at this point, as peak attendance ( 130
) had been reached.  Just an opportunity to hang out under the
undulating bejeweled clouds and a winking almost-full moon, feeling
like the luckiest people in the world.  Saw a few shooting stars.  All
too soon, it was time to go back and rejoin the party.  Which was in
full swing, with a couple solid hours of hard trance, moving into
minimal mechanical acid sounds spun by Herb.  After getting warm from
dancing, the only thing to do was jump back in the ambient swimming
hole, then back to the dance area, and so on.  There wasn't really a
"critical mass" crowd feeling until the final set, but the high level
of eye contact, smiles, and gesture-mirroring made for the sweetest
vibe I've felt in ages.  The final set, by Seville, went from about 7
to 8:30 or so, with high points including ( original version ) "We Are
Family" and "Music Express".  People were dragged back up from their
tents for this part; lots of arm waving and shrieking.  After the
music ended, people hung around packing, cleaning up, and swimming,
until 2pm or so.

It really can get this good, and I hope Penelope's Web can do it.
People primarly came through personal networks more than through
promotion, which amounted to extensive flyering.  The type of event
filtered out the devoidovibe element pretty effectively.  Two
heavy-metal guys left early because they "didn't like the gays in the
river" ( Several people covered in mud, some of whom were woemn,
actually ).  But other than that nothing even remotely unvibeful.
Some alcohol was in evidence, but no alcohol-behavior problems.  Or
N20 for that matter.  The site had been used for pagan festivals
before; one rumor held that the tribe of motorcyclists was coming from
Houston in a couple weeks to practiced Sumerian magic and eat
acid-laced beef.  Texas is too much sometimes.

sorry, but i have to dissent here.  after spending hours in the studio
working on beats to get them into that perfect groove, it drives me
nuts to hear some lowly HUMAN sitting there with a drum going off in
his own personal time signature.  i like that "relentless
perfection"... we strive for it all the time, in the studio.  jeno
told my roommate that he really loved the timbale section in "trip
harder" because it sounded like a live person, but i thought it was a
failure on my part because i played it rather sloppily and we didn't
correct all the strikes afterwards.  it still bothers me in places.
