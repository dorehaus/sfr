There needs to be a distinction between "media" and "public" distribution.
Public distribution of event information via sf-raves or otherwise means
increasingly broad availability -- and in general that's desirable,
whether it means people getting accounts on sf-raves or just the weekly
list, or seeing the list in some public place like on the counter at
Ameba, or on someone's refrigerator door.  That kind of public distribution
maintains the personal links that also provide the context for events
and to get to know this scene as something of a (fractured and disorganized)
community rather than just another commodity-offering operation the way
the commercial music business is.

Going to *media* based distribution means, inevitably, stripping out the
context and the personal connections in order to conform to the very 
narrow bandwidth limits and selection criteria used by the mass media.
Were we ecstatically happy when ambient music suddenly got a big spread
in the Chron recently, complete with nice photos and a listing of various
events?  Not entirely, I'd say.  Yet, the Gardening Club was not overrun
with the clueless hordes, because in fact most of this is still at the
myth stage for most people -- how many times do we hear from those who
clearly consider themselves well informed that raves are *only* about
taking drugs and loud poundy music?  Some people will see those public
listings and will be ready to jump in and try it out, and those people
*will* show up at the Gardening Club (to reiterate my example) and 
actually jump in fairly well.

As the Web becomes more of an everyday resource for things like event
listings, the distinction I'm making here between "public" and "media"
is gradually going to fade.  That could actually be a good development
since the linkage between the "resource" function that people rely on
from newspaper (media) listings would then re-merge with the cultural
connections we would like to make to those who are interested in
learning about and participating in what we're already involved with.

I can testify to the benefits of that approach, since the sf-raves
calendar has *always* fulfilled both functions for me.

One bit more.  I think our scene *needs* new blood and fresh energy.
In some ways, we have a unique opportunity to help that happen.
It's always a risk going to a wider distribution of information.  For
good reasons we don't trust the mainstream media because at least with
regard to our scene(s) they have fundamentally violated the social
contract between journalism and the general public, which is to report
the truth.  Instead, they have as a whole selectively chosen a
deliberately provocative (and thus salable) interpretation of "rave"
by focusing on only the most superficial elements.  In some ways this
has provided a protective cocoon around a fragile developing new
cultural style, because a lot of the glory-seekers and trendmongers
have stayed away (not all of them, unfortunately).  On the other hand,
it's isolated us in a cultural bubble that we are beginning to become
quite frustrated with.  At least in my personal observation, subject
to the usual caveats about speculation being the inaccurate scaling-up
of casual observation!

So anyway, my point . . . The explosion of interest in the Web and the
Net offers an interesting opportunity to promote better events and a
better "subculture" for lack of a better term than we are currently
seeing.  Our own DIY events convince me of the value of that.  It's
not like *we* have to do all the cool events, nosirreebob, that's too
much dang work.  It's more like expressing our views about what we *do*
like and help inform and shape the expectations not only of those who
are already dialed in to the net-music thing, but those who haven't
yet made the connection but are leaping through all the new doorways
opening up onto the net.  It's a bit scary in a way because it will
change *us* too, so I will simply mention my own sense that PLUR can
be transmitted over TCP/IP :)

I appreciated Lydia's post because it's clear she's had to deal with both
sides of the copyright issue.  In fact, I was just talking with some
friends of mine from Germany (they are called Station Rose, and will be
back in SF to perform this fall I hope).  They have a new CD-Plus
interactive CD-ROM coming out in a few weeks, so I asked them what they
thought of the prospect of people *easily* being able to sample both
the audio and video off their release.  "Basically, we don't mind,"
they said, although I think they would want some type of compensation
if someone used their material for seriously commercial purposes.
When you can not only easily copy an audiotape but an entire multimedia
presentation, using an ordinary home computer that now comes complete
with CD-ROM, multimedia card and speakers for $1500 or less, that is
a serious undermining of the way the copyright law has traditionally
worked.

My own take on it is that a radical rethinking of the situation is
needed.  People don't use ASCAP and BMI unless they have little choiced
(say if you are a public business like a bar where you pay ASCAP/BMI
fees for more than minimal use of copyrighted music).  But it is NOT
easy, convenient or cheap, even for them.  For the rest of us, it is
difficult, way expensive and prohibitively stupid.  

We need an online copyright collective that would provide direct payment
from consumers to creative producers, and cut out the middle-bullshit
that has grown huge and ugly stripping the value off of artistic
creation and lifting the wallets of people who would like to enjoy
music or art or writing or whatever.  Think of that next time you
wonder why CD prices are so damn high.  

For the first time in this century we have a chance to think about,
talk about and almost certainly eventually take part in moving
copyright questions into alignment with modern technology and
re-balancing the relationship between creators, distributors and
consumers of cultural work.  The only question is whether Hollywood
Babylon will reinvent itself on the net, developing institutional
relationships that cheat both the artist and the audience.

All the comments made so far on this thread have struck me as valid, and the
positive possibilities of providing a more public presence (I didn't do that
on purpose, honest), are perhaps worth the risks.

It hasn't been mentioned that some people will probably request that their
parties not be mentioned if it is known that the calendar is going to be in
a newspaper. 

The issues surrounding cavalier use of audio and video samples, as well as
some other things, definitely create the need for real underground events.
On the other hand, such events don't have to be 'raves'.

I have mixed feelings about 'bootlegging' software, music and video.
In 'Dave's Perfect World' all distribution of the above would be done
through networks, any DJ or artist that used someone else's stuff would
send THE ARTIST, not the record company $0.50 or so for each use. The 
accounting would be done via software (your set list could add an entry
to a package that would let you send a check to every artist you appreciated
at the end of the year). No record companies. Party play would supplant air
play to promote new music (except for college radio, :) 

It is my perception that the main force driving the economics of house music
are DJ purchases of vinyl. Comments?

Well, at this point it is clear to me that they do this in EVERY article,
including 
Bosnia, the economy, even diet tips.

Don't trust ANYTHING you read or watch in the media!

----------

Now, a question -- I've read that back in oh, say, 1992, a lot of people
became involved in the rave scene and it grew quickly -- in fact, many of
those on this list became involved then.

And, somehow, a good percentage of the "newbies" at that time were interested
in the vibe rather than a drunken meat market.

Nowadays, it seems that the character/style of people checking out the scene
for the first time has changed.

Any ideas on why this is so?  (or not so, if you demur)

respect to all,

regarding raves ignoring/changing/affecting the american mainstream,
  it was written that a flower grows through a rock because of destiny,
    not because it was forced to.

maybe a more accurate reflection mite be that a flower grows through
  a rock because it is attracted to the LIGHT.

You asked about what the rave scene could be like in 5 to 10 years? I think 
we will be full body electric- As 3D real time environments enter the net we 
should see online clubs/spaces blossom  all around us. At first the spaces 
will allow us to gather and listen to broadcasted soundtracks with text 
command interfaces. Then as they progress we should be able to take on 
virtual presence and even dance in these spaces.

Yeah, I think I know what your thinking, get out of the house buddy- But 
think of the possibilities The environments could always be changing and 
the people that visit them may even be global! The covert feeling that 
the 1920's clubs and Rave has given us will not perish it may just change 
it's sound and move further out digitally!

What do I want the San Francisco rave scene to be like in 5 to 10 years?

That is a very difficult and easy question to answer.  Difficult in that 
the scene has changed alot since it began. It is always changing, it 
seems.  So many complain bitterly because "it ain't what it used to be."  
Well, change is the only constant - it's how you *deal* with the change 
that makes a difference.  Who knows what the scene will be like in 5 to 
10 years.  The music and attitude are a reflection of what is happening 
in the world at that time and what people *want* out of their scene.  
That could change drastically for all I know. We have no way of knowing.

The part that is easy to answer in what I want out of the scene in 5 to 
10 years is that I still want that incredible music, wonderful people and 
most of all - that Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect.  I still get that 
today, even if the rave scene is quite different than from when it 
began.  It is all what you (as in everybody involved) decide to make of 
it.  There is my 2 cents for the evening.:)

love,
Amy

Hello everybody,

Well I went to "stuwmpy stuwmp" (=)
and thought the music was really good.
The crowd could have been a little more energetic out there, but who cares
I was havin a great time dancing.  I went to "Diverse City Music for the
Future Generation" before Stompy stomp, and introduced my self to Ethan
while he was spinning a very good set.  The dance floor was basically empty
@ the time I went, which was early, but I wanted to hear Ethans set so I
went out and danced. A little later I went up stairs to listen to the dj up
there which was I believe "Ocean" I sat down for a while on the beanbags
with my eyes closed and enjoyed.  My friends I went with were getting a
little antsy So we left to go to Stompy stomp.  $12 the goon @ the door
says.  So I go in and pay and to my suprise there were alot of people there
and the music was wonderful I think it was Jeno.  As Willis Wong was saying
the visuals were "Whoa momma!".  I danced for so long that My friends
wanted to leave and I didn't.  I've got to remind myself to drive by my
self or find someone from the list to go with so I know I wont have to
leave any time soon when having so much fun.  The only thing bad about this
venue was the door thugs.  They were straight-up richards(DICKS).

ME:(To either Jason(Spun) or Jasons brother) "Is there ins and outs?"
Jasonorbro: "Ask the door men"
Me: "Is there ins and outs?"
Dick: "WAIT... I sad WAIT!"
Finally get my hand stamped with newly bought water bottle in hand....
Started to walk back in and,
DICK: Takes my water bottle out of my back pocket!
ME: "I just walked out my friends to there car right in front of you!"
DICK: "NOPE!"
ME: "BUT..."
DICK: "I fucking sayed NO!"
ME: "What ever, so can I drink my water out here?!"
DICK: "BEHIND THE RAIL"
ME: "Whatever...DICK!"
And walked back in to have 5 people ask me for a hand stamp.

Whats up with the goons at the door folks.  They could be a little more
gental.  Not everybody who walks through those doors is going to give them
throuble.  But other than that I had a BLAST.  Wish I could've met some
people from the list there.

Well that was my weekend, I'll be going out this coming weekend again
so if theres anybody out there that lives in San Jose and needs a ride or
wants to meet up and have dinner before a good night e-mail.

Hope everybody had a safe and wonderful weekend.

Subject: The Second Bomb of Oklahoma City

 An article by a middleastern journalist
-------------------------------------------
 The Second Bomb of Oklahoma City
 
 When I first heard the news about the Oklahoma City bombing and the
 children who were killed in the day care center, I couldn't help but to
 remember the children I used to work with when I worked at a day care
 center back when I was in college.  I remembered how innocent and pure
 were the children and how different they were from the society outside.
 The children at that day center, just like children all over the world,
 did not hate.  They were too young to understand the hatred, bigotry,
 sexism and racism of their parents, society and culture.  I took refuge
 in that day care center even when I didn't have to work.  That day care
 center became my shelter from the ugly world of grown ups outside of it.
 It also gave me hope for the future.  Hope that some of the children
 will keep their innocence and purity as they grow up.  For me that meant
 that there will always be hope as long as there are children out there.
 When I heard that someone out there killed that hope in Oklahoma City I
 was overwhelmed with grieve for the families who lost their loved ones
 and for all of us who witnessed another blow to humanity.
 
 My grief for the children, their families and for all of us was
 interrupted by waves and waves of hatred and racism that came through the
 media reports about the Bomb.  I spent Wednesday and Thursday listening to
 people saying that my mother, who gave birth to me and to my sister, does
 not "value life as we (Americans) do."  As for my father, who spend his
 time in hospitals trying to help people as a doctor, the "experts" were
 telling the American people that he is an "animal" who does not "deserve
 to live."  I heard politicians saying that my nieces Zaina (9 years old)
 and Alia (2 years old) "need to be punished severely."  Even my sadness
 was interpreted as "crocodile tears" and I was told that "people like me"
 are not worthy to grieve for "people like us (Americans)."  My only fault,
 and my family's only fault, was that we did not grow up watching baseball
 games and eating apple pies.  We are Arabs and that was enough reason for
 the media, the "experts," the politicians and the people of this country
 to blame us for the Oklahoma City bombing and then hate us for it!
 
 Well,
 
 surprise!!
 
 WE DID NOT DO IT.
 
 Sorry, said the media, the "experts," the politicians and the American people:
 We are sorry because we wanted to "ship you back to where you came from."
 We are sorry because we wanted to put you in concentration camps.
 We are sorry because we wanted to bomb your homeland.
 We are sorry because we doubted your humanity.
 
 Well,
 
 surprise!!
 
 THAT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
 
 It is not enough because the feelings, the hatred and the racism,
 expressed in the media on Wednesday and on Thursday were not that different
 from the views of the people who the FBI believes are behind the
 bombing.  Yet, we are told by the media, the "experts" and the politicians
 that the Oklahoma City bombing is an "individual" and "crazy" act.  Even
 when the hatred expressed by these "individuals crazy" act is the same hatred
 we heard on Wednesday and on Thursday coming out from the media, the
 "experts," the politicians and the American people.  That is very
 alarming.  This country and all the people of this country need help.
 There is no need for more anti-terrorist's laws.  There is no need for
 more prisons and law enforcement agencies.  What this country and the
 people of this country need is a deep look inside a system that is built
 on hatred and racism.  What this country needs is an overhaul of the
 politicians, the media and the "experts" that spread hate all over.  It
 is not the Arabs and Muslims who need the apologies.  It is this country
 and the people of this country that need the apologies.  The media, the
 "experts" and the politicians need to apologize because they built a
 country full of hate and racism and the future for a country with so much
 hate and racism in it is bleak.  Take a look at Nazi Germany and learn.
 
 The Arabs and Muslims in this country and in the world need to be
 understood and respected, just like all the people and cultures of the
 world.  We all value life and the lives of our children.  If the media,
 the "experts" and the politicians are trying to monopolize humanity for
 "people like us," then they are wrong and must be stopped.  There is no
 difference between a mother in Rwanda who traveled 100s of miles on foot
 to find a safe place for her children and a mother in Oklahoma City
 spending extra time telling a bed time story to here kids.  The Iraqi
 parent who came out of a bombed shelter holding his dead son in his hands
 is not different from the fire fighter who carried the dead child out of
 the Oklahoma City federal building.  The tears that Lebanese mothers,
 Israeli mothers, Palestinians mothers, Bosnian mothers, Angolan mothers,
 Guatemalan mothers, Nicaraguan mothers, Sri Lankan mothers and mothers
 all over the world drop out of sadness and fear for their children are
 not different from the tears we are hearing from the mothers in Oklahoma
 City.  Let that be the lesson of Oklahoma City terrorist attack so we can
 put out the racist and hatred bomb that exploded afterwards.

I totally agree.  When I look at DJ mixes, I would love to know the 
artists for that reason: so that I can go out and get their original 
stuff.  We all know that at this time any recording of a cd or record is 
going to lose its quality after repeated playing, but the original can 
last for a lot longer.

For this reason, I don't feel bad about making mixes and such, because 
the people that I make the mixes for either wouldn't get the music 
themselves anyway, or would want the original, and might well go out and 
buy it since I tell them the artist.  Of course, this is going on the 
assumption (a good one, of course) that they like the music I give them :).

When shopping for mixtapes, I usually look for the ones with song lists, 
and as most don't have them, I don't get tapes all that often.  It kinda 
sucks, and I bet a lot of people feel this way.

I have a friend who works in a cafe that is just becoming more 
corporation-like (Spinelli's, if anyone's interested, a very cool and PC 
company), and unfortunately, in order to protect themselves from record 
companies or whoever from suing, they don't allow the employees to play 
their own music, which used to consist of dubbed tapes and originals.  IT 
sucks, because now they're stuck with this music service that gives them 
8 tapes a month, which are rarely completely loved by anyone.  They now 
feel like having music that they feel neutral about is better than no 
music.  And their feelings about working suffer, because they can't 
listen to exactly what they want.  I'm sure everyone out there has had 
the experience of being able to listen to your own music while you work a 
boring monotonous job vs. listening to crappy music or no music at all.  
It's a big difference.

I can almost understand why companies wouldn't want people giving their 
friends copies of their albums.  It makes sense.  But not allowing them 
to listen to music unless they pay royalties in a work place is 
preposterous.  It almost smacks of an infringement of the first 
amendment.  Owning information????  Geeze.  It touches a lot of topics.

Maybe the flower grows through the rock because it doesn't know that it's

Next time,  ask the goon "Is it the steriods your taking,  or are you just
having a bad day!"   people who take steriods are always like that...  

174 King st is noterious for having the meanest gorillas at the door.  
This is why I urge all of you to please contact the promoters and tell them
that 174 King  st is NOT a venue to consider....

I remember going to a party there,  over a year ago,  and I had to have 
my lungs pumped because I wasn't allowed to even stick my face out the 
door for fresh air.

Wasn't this the venue that cut off the faucets in the bathrooms so nobody
could re-fill their water bottles?   Or was that 16th and Harrison?

I was thinking about this post that my girlfriend wrote and the positive 
responses that she received (thanks Bradley and Nomad) and I was touched by 
some very positive memories that I thought I'd share with any of you who don't 
mind reading a moderately long post.

As I was wondering aimlesly around the enormous warehouse at the first 
"Vision" :) :O ;), I encountered an astonishing number of friends from many 
tribes whose first words to me were "Bliss, meet [insert name here]. This is 
his/her first rave, and we want to show him/her what a truly beautiful and 
positve experience it is".  

Every one of these wonderful new people was nothing less than awe stricken by 
the freindliness and honesty of the people they had met (not to mention the 
awesome music, lazers, and visual experience).  They said things like "WOW!!! 
I didn't know there would be so many cool people" and "This isn't the shit you 
hear about in the news."

I'm sure I can honestly say that every one of these new faces had a smile on 
it at the end of the night and for many days afterward, and many of them went 
on to introduce their closest freinds to the profound enlightening experience 
that we all know and love.

I think that this is the best way for new people to enter our world.  No one 
needs to be taught how to "Rave" because that is something that is undefinable 
and simply comes naturaly, and differently I might add, to most anyone who 
joins us.  I do think that it is important though, for us to guide newcomers 
in such a way as to point out the positivity, honesty, sincerity, of the 
people involved in RC, and to help these newcomers have the most positive 
experience possible.  

It was at this same party that I was sitting off in a corner by myself, as I 
often do several times during the course of a good rave, watching the dancers, 
the lazers, taking in the music and the vibe, breathing :), enjoying the 
feeling of the e that I have taken, and reflecting on the beauty of it all.  
While I was doing this, I guy I did not know came up to me and introduce 
himself as Arty.  He asked me how I was in that "yes I really care" raver way, 
and asked if it was my first rave.  I explained to him that I had been raving 
for a couple of years and that this particular party was so good that it did 
indeed feel like the first time.  We had a fabulous conversation and in our 
excitement he suddenly said "let me introduce you to my FAMILY!!!"

Arty introduced me to Larry, Chelsea, Veronica, Dei, Dave, Steve, Joe, and 
Joe's mom Anne.  They were all from San Jose and are some of the finest people 
I have met raving.  I spent the rest of the night with my new freinds and at 
every rave I went to afterward I always sought out the San Jose Posee, and 
they were allways glad to see me and I them.

This to me is the true spirit of the Rave.  That selfless positivity that we 
bestow opon each other.  The warm smile given and returned.  The "How are 
You", asked and answered honestly.  The KNOWLEDGE, that PEOPLE really do CARE. 
 I will gladly share this world with all of you.

A rave is not a PLACE with MUSIC where people gather to dance.  A rave is a 
GATHERING of PEOPLE, dancing in a place with music.

Dear All;

	The tone of this letter is happy, grateful, a little rightous, 
and with a tad of concern and should be read that way, thanks nuff said.

	A fantastic amount of good clear information, thanks. One of the
reasons I did this, was to make the promoters who are on this mailing list
more aware of what we want our scene to be and become. Unfortuately when
it comes down to whether raves become more commerial or not, we will be
the last thing the majority of the promoters consider, it will be more like
how much money can we make by doing this. But at least their on notice now
about what we would like to see and have happen. Please note, that I'm not 
saying that all of our promoters are like this. Ethan of F&F really cares 
about our scene, and works very hard at tring to make what we want 
happen, and I'm sure there are others as well, I just haven't met them yet.

	Raves cost money, there's insurance to buy, permits, halls to rent, 
sound system, security, and plus a lot of risk ...etc. People need to get 
paid for their services & time that are necessary for us to have a party.
Some of the biggest complaints I hear are things like not providing a 
clean, free water supply, first aid not being consitant, dirty venues 
..etc. I feel that if someone performs a service for you that they need 
to get compensated for it, whether it be a trade, cash, whatever. But I 
feel that sometimes excessive profits are made, at our risk and expense.

	I feel that we as a group of kind people need to make our desires 
known, to set boundries with our promoters. Like saying that we refuse to 
support a event thats not going to provide people with a free, clean 
source of water, and stick by our guns. The water issue is really an 
important one, becasue summer is not far away(YEAH)!!!, and I don't like 
having to do 1st aid on people with dehyration or heat prosration when it 
could have been avoided, and wasn't because of someones greed & selfishness.

	I just hope that the promoters on this list have heard what we 
have said, and will continue to say, and do something to make our(promoters 
included) vision happen. I hope these couple of posts brought some 
awareness into your lives :).

	    Peace, Love & Thanks From Across Cyberspace

I agree with Lydia that DJs should provide a track listing with their mix 
tapes.  I always wish that I could go out and purchase the music I hear on my 
favorite tapes.  I am a DJ myself and I create mix tapes.  When I do, I always 
include a track listing.  I do not sell my mix tapes (mostly because I am not 
a well known professional DJ), I give my mix tapes away to my people who 
appreciate them. Even though I do not make money from these tapes I still try 
to provide a track listing because I feel that the people who made the music 
deserve credit.

In effect a track listing provides advertisement to the artists.  Consider 
this:  If a DJ mixes a great tape that everybody loves and he provides a track 
listing, then other DJs will go out and buy the 12" vinyl, other listeners 
will go out and buy the CD, and the DJ who mixed the tape will have 
effectively helped the artist to sell his/her product.

I think that this advertisement is probably far more valuable to the artist 
than the collection of royalties from the mixed tape which probably doesn't 
sell enough copies to justify the administrative expense of collecting 
royalties anyway.  I could see the price of a mixed tape rising to $30 or $40 
just to cover the cost of the paperwork involved.  This may be my lack of 
experience speaking so I would be interested to hear others opinions on this.

Also, I can't tell you the number of hours I've spent in BPM and other stores 
listening to dozens of records only to find one or two that really move me, 
and every so often finding that one mythical 12" that i've been looking for 
for years.  If only the DJs had track listings with their tapes I might be 
able to find all of those records i've been looking for.  I would be happy at 
my turntables and the artists would have money in their pockets.  I would not 
be so boldly uncreative as to play the same mix as the DJ who mixed the tape 
from which I heard the records, so the DJ's creativity would not be 
compromised either.  

I don't think that true creativity is something you can steal.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flatery.

just a few thoughts.  :)

at the same time, you know that felling when you find *that* record.  
*that* record that you'ved heard at parties etc and have had the *need* 
to own for many a month?? then you throw on a random track at the store 
and it's it??that feeling izz undescribable!! ya just can't stop grinning 
to yourself about how you've finally found it!!  i guess it adds suspense 
and mystery to djing.
	also, most record stores will listen to your mix tapes and pretty 
much always be able to tell you the name and artist of the track you need.

BUT, without being too hypocritical, despite what i said above, i totally 
agree that mixtapes should contain track listings.

Diverse City was a truly mind enhancing event.  Although Stompy squared was
probabily the big pull on Sat.  A few of us felt to steer clear from the
crowd.  Although only about two hundred strong and a few of the DJ's timimg
was off, we were able to make hugs, not war.  Love, not bombs.  Id like to
say howdy to the lollipop crew and my fountain buddies.  It was a treat to
see everyone on thier own groove, yet communicating with thier smiles, and
bodies.  Hope to see everyone soon and keep the scene clean....

props to the gold shirt lady, Fuc*kr, that Tae Kwon Do guy and everyone elses
name I seem to have forgotten.....

I'm glad you're interested in finding out more about the copyright/royaty
issue. What I will send you might help you to understand why most songwriters
are against legislation which would take away their basic property rights.
There are two sides to the workplace issue. The employee would just like to
listen to music that he/she enjoys to help get through the day. On the other
hand alot of these businesses owe a certain amount of credit to the music
which helps create the ambience in an establishment (e.g. restaurants,
nightclubs, taverns, retail stores). Should they be allowed to use my
property for free? Is that stealing? Good question, and where do you draw the
line? As a published songwriter I'm not even sure where I stand yet on this
issue. 
I apologize if this is not completely rave related but I saw enough interest
to include one last post to the list and repeat my offer to send anyone
interested my BMI info as I am doing for Jesus Chrysler( Jesus Please email
me with a fax number or a snail mail address so I can pass on the info - and
that goes for any one else who wants it)

Hey you all.

A thought touched me.  I was inspired greatly by, and I'm sure some of you
have seen it, PCU.  Now, I now that it's theme isn't exactly what I got from
it (at least I don't think).  I was inspired at the gathering of all types
to enjoy each others company and music.  The "all campus party".  I'm not
one to cruze to an old dance party so there was something else that touched
me. I think that it was the fact that people let down there walls and
stopped to just have a good time and enjoy being around others who are
having a good time.  The party didn't resemble the rave scene but it made me
think of all of you guys and girls.

Tell me.

What would it take to throw a beach party in San Francisco... Let's say Half
Moon Bay.  With multi-bomb fires going and a generator for the DJ's sets.
It would, of course, have no booze because that takes away from the scene.
A sunset to sunrise ravelike get together.  This thought gives me so much
hope...  Okay.  Now I know many of you have experienced alike things or have
insight into this thought...

Humor me... [insert your thoughts here]

You would have to dump a whole lot of E into the local water supply so that 
the locals
and police would be on the same wavelength. If you could pull that off, I 
guarantee it
would be one killer party.

Okay.

I'm wondering whether or not there are legal areas for beach parties.  In
our case, it would resemble a ravelike gathering...

I'm sure that there are beaches that are a bit away from the locals and the
police don't have to know if it's in a somewhat remote area... A complete
freedom of interest gathering with e, free water, and four to five large
bomb fires with a couple of Djs running their stuff from a donated generator
(just for the gathering of course).

Please say that it can be done.

hey everyone,

  a little notice about the weekend.  can you say trance??  wow
thats what i heard at both parties i went to this weekend.  i was
almost like "am i still in san francisco?"  *joke*

  but really on friday night went to dust to see james dee spin.
he rocked it really hard.  i had heard him a lot of times spin when
i was hanging out with him but to be able to dance with a lot of other
people listening to him.  really good :)
  i left early tho to go to kundalini and got there and was pissed off
by how long the drive was ans everything and when i saw it was in a
skating rink decided not to go it.  heard it was good tho.  the ride
back was really horrible trying to stay awake. oh well :P
  sat night went to diverse city.  i didnt like the trocadero, but i 
really liked it for this party.  the lights and the crowd were both really
good and the music was all hard slammin trance and the people there were
dancing and having a good time.  so it was fun party

  was glad that sunset was cancled on sunday cause it was too nasty a 
day to go dancing.  cant wait till next week tho :)

well im off. peace

hey,

  i was wondering if anyone was going to Smartie's from the bay
area and if you would have some room in their car for me and two
friends.  
  i know it asking for a lot, but im willing to compensate.  i can
offer gas money,  a free dinner,  some blo-pops and some decent
conversation for the trip there and back :)  also we could got to any
muni or bart station and meet you there if it would be more convienent

  but if anyone is willing to, let me know :)  thanks

peace and take care

As a member of the Haight Street Surf Coalition the prospects of a rave on the 
beach excites me. However , most raves on the beach have been at rather poor 
locations surf-wise. We intend to fix this as we are planning a surfing rave in 
Baha, Mexico. Once I surfed at a Greatful Dead concert in Ventura on acid 
while the dead were playing !

Thanks for the uplifting story.  I was moved by your story.  I appreciate 
hearing about the positive experiences people have at raves.
Helps validate my own experiences, nice to hear how others feel that very 
specialness they experience at raves.  I am sometimes very amazed at how 
wonderful I feel at raves.  Thanks for sharing.

LOVE is a shared energy.

it happened saturday after some after-permit trancing  harrasment at the
Bandshell for the Food not Bombs Soupstock . Spaz renegade soundpirates had
set up and after the second warning to tone down, the cry went up, "head
for the beach" so, braving the dangers of driving fully loaded with good
vibe, we headed for Sloat Beach and aimed the Wushu Accumulator
(soundsystem) at the Pacific Ocean, with  hot broccali soup to warm us, we
bopped for 5 hours until the rain came down. a lesson in raindanceraving.

        Reply to:   RE>>Public Newpaper Post, of Our 
This thread is bringing out some really interesting posts!

Your post has a lot a wisdom, Bradley, and much of it I would agree with, but
there are a couple of points I want to comment on:

For me, the music at raves is a very distinctive element. At their worst,
techno, trance, jungle, house, etc. can be very formulaic. You can hear a lot of
bad house and techno at mainstream clubs because those clubs stick to the
formula that brings in the most cash with the least amount of risk. In addition
to the excellent vibe, I go to raves to hear music that's playful, experimental,
that I haven't necessarily heard before. My favorite DJs have no absolute set
"sound," they just always play a good set.

Also, I see underground and exclusive as very different things. Underground
results from having to elude laws and regulations that dictate the location,
duration, and type of events thrown. Exclusive results from wanting to keep
certain types of people outside. Perhaps we should try to exclude some people,
for instance, those who arrive with the fuck-or-fight attitude. From what I've
noticed, though, people with those types of attitudes find raves boring and
stupid, and usually only show up once (though I guess once can be enough to ruin
a nice small party).

For now, I agree that keeping the calendar out of the daily print is wise - more
for the underground reasons than the exclusive ones. If you're concerned about
keeping out the wrong sorts of people, consider this:
in the social order of pop culture today, exactly how cool are ravers? I find
myself thinking about Allen's recent rave/punk parallels (or concentric
curves?). I remember how the football team at my high-school took particular
delight in kicking the punks around. I don't recall any football players or
those of similar social stature wanting to become punks. I do remember, though,
that out of all the cliques, the punks were by far the most accepting of this
science geek with a bowl cut.

take care!

You know, I'm getting really sick of all the bashing of doormen that
goes on around here.  Until you have worked in that position, don't
assume you know the way the job is.  To a doorman, you are just another
potential problem.  They have to look at it that way, since no problem
persons wear badges that single them out.

I have worked in that kind of job, and have been in several fights with
drunken assholes, been cursed at by minors when I took their alcohol,
had a gun put to my head for not letting somebody's friends in the
back door, etc.

To the people complaining about not being allowed to step outside for air,
have you considered that maybe the police have given them that final
warning about the noise (which is louder when the door is open) or about
people hanging out on the sidewalk?

Please accept the fact that you do not always know what's going on.

Well, it's Tuesday and I still haven't seen a post about Kundalini so I 
thought I'd put in my two cents on the party.  First I was very 
disappointed to hear that it was way out in Antioch.... what's with all 
these east bay parties lately anyway?  Is there some reason that all 
these parties are in remote locations? Or is it just that the venues are 
cheaper and the promoters feel they can make more money?  People have 
talked about the San Francisco curfew as a possible reason for the lack 
of parties in the city, but I have heard no reports of the police 
actually inforcing the curfew.  After a 50 min drive, we made it there to 
find a rather sizable line.  The security were doing very thorough 
searches of everyone going in, which at least made me feel confident that 
there were no weapons inside (my friend even had to take his swiss army 
knife out of his back pack and take it back to the car).  We made it to 
the door at about 12:03 and they were already charging $20.  I really 
think that parties that do this are just grabbing for money.  The 
promotors should mark the line and anyone there before 12:00 gets in for 
the advertised price ($15).  (The line moved condiderably faster after 
midnight).
	On the positive side, once inside the party had good sound, some 
nice lights (as you walked into the dance area most lights were at one 
end and low to the ground so people dancing were silhouetted against 
bright colored lighting & strobes) & some seriously phat beats : )   The 
vibe increased as the night progressed and I met lots of happy, positive 
people.  Everyone smiled and introduced themselves, and people were there 
to dance and share.  I had a great time with all the people I met and got 
to spend most of the evening with a truly good friend.
	Overall I had a great time and I would say it was a really good party, 
but I think that the promoters have cut a few corners from the two other 
Kundalini parties that I have been to before (both of which were 
excellent).  I'm not trying to be too critical, but I have seen this as a 
bit of a trend lately and I feel that we must let the promoters know how we 
feel.  
	
peace, love, and positive energy

Basically the police are making it really hard to throw a legal party in SF.
They want you to hire off duty police which is tantamount to paying for
protection.  There are also only a few "sanctioned" venues that they will
allow a party to take place in.  It has more to do with graft and
extortion then the curfew law.

Hello all,


	My name is chris and this will be my first time posting.  A little over a year ago (Feb 94) I had the most incredible experince of my life.  An experience that can only happen once.  My life was forever changed by the sudden realization of the true nature of things.  I cannont begin to thank the people directly and indirectly involved with that realization.  I can only start with every person at Bonney Dune at the Feb Full Moon Party of 94. Thank you!! 


WOW!!!!!  It is absolutely incredible that in an instant I could go from a devoute atheist (agnostic) to a person aware of the spiritial forces around me and within me.  Ever since that moment I have been learning, forgeting, and learning again.  The world is so beautiful to me now.  In the blink of an eye I was lifted up to the top of the mountain and shown heaven, than the same force spun me around a billion times and threw me back down to the valley and said, "There is the path back up the mountain, good luck,"  Since than I have been trying to follow the path, but as you all must know, it is not easy.        

I look to the rave scene and to nature for my inspiration.  House music is awesome!!!!!!! It moves me as does the partys I've been to.  Within this scene I see a community that is just incredible.  The people I have met are all beautiful and teach me by thier actions and attitudes.  I strive to be a positive extroverted person spewing good vibes where ever I go.  I think we posses the power to make great changes.  This excites me very much.  We can and will change the world in positive ways.  If we as a group can foucus our enery in the right directions this will happen.

	Nature holds the answers.

		Love, chris

Perhaps they can take a MOMENT to DIFFERENTIATE the problem individuals 
from those who are well intentioned. 

I've found a few doormen who have this ability. All's it takes is a 
little insight. Drunken trouble makers are usually easy to spot (or do 
they pretend to be "cool" so they can then cause trouble?)

Perhaps the "goons" are just too lazy to take the time to differentiate?

Then again, I've never been a doorman, so I don't REALLY know.

Yes, Bonnie Dune is a special place for me as well! About 3 1/2 years ago I had
a similar experience there.  Suffice it to say that I got in contact with
Mother Earth, the Goddess, Gaia, God, the Tao whatever you want to call it.

I'm so glad you shared this with us, I keeps me going out and participating.
Some of us believe (you all know who you are:) that as long as people like 
you keep having these kinds of experiences then it makes all of the bullshit
worth while and we are getting our job done.

I came to the unmistakable realization that all things ebb and flow and even the
most totalitarian, faschist, polluting society is but a missbehaved baby in her
arms.  Our mother loves us as she does all of her children but it is only
our Ego that tells us that we are her favorites or special in some form.
She will not allow all life on this planet to perish so that one species
(mankind) can abuse him/herself and everyone else.  In her face as Kali, she can
destroy entire civilizations overnight but she always hedges her bets, she
always whispers... to the children with devotion.

Well, As some of you know I have been a doorman for several parties
in and out of the scene.  The King street security are way out of
hand.  They give me shit when I go there and most of them have seen me for 
years.  A few months ago we (the Wicked crew) almost got into an all out brawl
with some of them in the DJ booth.  I've been a weight lifter in my day and I
tell you the behavior (plus the jaws on some of them) leads me to believe
that they been hittin the 'roids.

So far, (knock on wood) I have never had to hit anyone or push anyone while 
doing a door.  I have come close on a few occasions but not really
in the rave scene, most of the gangsters are wanna be (thank goodness :)

I missed any Stompy reviews other
than catching the tail end of doorman bashing.
There were an unusual number of high people this Saturday.
That has got to make the door job more difficult.

Stompy was good.  I really like some 
of the stuff Jeno's been playing lately.

You can look at my water, but you can't have it.
Bingo, said the sweaty King St garage.  A chorus 
of half-serious faces could barely contain the
occasional giggle.  Always premium.
Terribly fun party.

May 5, I want to go to a big outside party

the new moon happened last weekend...on saturday.  they were going to have 
it on a beach, but it rained.  so lucky for us, jc of the il pirata bar 
on 16th and utah let us have it there.  

it has always been a secret fantasy of mine to go to a new moon there, 
just 'cause it's such a cosy comfy neighborhood raver bar with a decent 
sized dance floor.  

the only thing that sucked about having the party there was having to 
turn away so many kids who were under 21.   anyway, sorry sorry 
sorry sorry to anybody who wanted to get in but couldn't.  

the guys that did Lawndree last week volunteered to bring their system up 
from Davis for this party.  two spun records:  marc and john (aka 
glowboy!) and they brought their friend avery to help out.  they are 
great folks and say they are going to do a party on the weekend of the 
14th up near  davis.  they have an outdoor location in mind that isn't 
far and so you might want to check it out!  mark plays 
eclectic everything...from house to techno to disco...the range of dance 
music.  anyway, they will probably post about their upcoming party so i 
won't say more here for fear of getting it wrong or some such.  thanks 
very much for helping us out!  

jc, who manages the il pirata and who is the son of the owner, also took 
a turn at the decks.  new moon vet ronan h. started us out with an ambient 
dub set (sorry if i'm getting the categories wrong) that had a strong 
sprititual element, which i liked very much.  it was very much in keeping 
with ronan's personal style of music...at the time i didn't get to hear 
much but luckily i was able to hear a tape of it the next day.  the 
healing power in music came through.  thankyou. 

the very last dj to spin was felix, who completely 
blew me away with his "trip-hop heavy dub," which is what mona called 
it.  i noticed his name on a flyer for an upcoming weekly (?) called 
black diamond which looks intriguing.  and yesterday night i think he 
played at the gardening club.  you should definitely go and hear him if 
you haven't already.  i liked the records he played because they screwed 
around with my expectations and such.  but there was an underlying dark 
mood to everything he played that made me feel like a citizen of a 
future world where at last all categories have been blown apart, as they've
been promising to do for quite some time.  check him out if you can.

thanks again mark, avery, john, felix, ronan, jc, mona, gregg, morgan, 
amy, phoenix, paul, cinnamon twist, phred, and everyone for coming and 
making such a nice time.

-ann

ps it was also mona's going-away-party..she's leaving for a while to Miss

Thats a fine response to absolutely nothing we are talking about.
If I'm just another potential problem to the door men then forget that
venue with those types of door men working there.  I work in shipping/
receiving and if I treated everything as a potential problem I'd get fired.
You see theres a way to deal with things in this life time and any other
life time.  I've never heard of people treating everything as a problem.
Theres a solution to every problem, and treating people that pay their rent
and bills like shit isn't a solution.  Its a problem that the door man
made for himself.  If the door man is being a dick because he thinks every
body is a potential problem then that door man has a problem, like get
another job (its called stressed/burnt out).

Understood!  And I'm glad your still alive from the pulled gun, but
theres the trouble maker and theres the human thats trying to have some fun.
When I go out to any venue I respect the door men, but when I respect the
door men, and the door men don't respect me then there is your problem.
As a door man you should use your judgement on the individual, and not
everybody as a potential problem.  Don't get me wrong cause those door men
deal with some nasty shit.  But you can be NICE to the people that TREAT
YOU nice.

Or has the venue/door men/owner overlooked the health of their customers?
And yes, I have considered the law side of things.  So does the law tell
owners which tell their door men to shut all doors/windows/water/air
conditioning etc. I think not!!!  If these venues supported their customers
more, instead of there pockets, things might be different.


>Please accept the fact that you do not always know what's going on.


Sorry but door men do what you see and nothing more.  Theres nothing
secretive about being a door man. Theres nothing to find out. I see whats
going on.  I have friends that are door men and ladies.  You don't need the
tough attitude 100% of the time.

So whats your point????

I usually don't post much to SF Raves but I thought I ought to throw in my
2 cents worth with regards to these topics.

FIRST:  Bouncers at raves etc.  Maybe they breed 'em more ornery in the
States, but up here in Canada I have found most bouncers to be polite and
courteous within the bounds of their job.  Sure, we have our assholes
(witness the scene which erupted outside MaRS a few weeks ago) but on the
whole I have never had any trouble with bouncers beyond the occasional
attitude ... and when people pull attitude I just let them pull it and back
off.  Maybe I'm a little wimpy but most times I don't feel that my rights
are being infringed on.  And it IS a tough job to be a bouncer.

SECOND:  the "underground" scenes.  underground to me means that the
general public is not aware of it, or has only the vaguest idea what a
scene entails.  It does NOT mean that it should be limited to the
"underground" crowd.  The fact that they play Moby and Orbital on Electric
Circus here in Canada, one of THE most commercialized pieces of television
I have ever had the misfortune to witness, doens't mean to me that they've
"sold out" - they just happen to have put out music which appeals to a
larger crowd.  that's all.  Music is for EVERYBODY who likes it, or at
least it should be.

I have my fire extinguisher ready for incoming flames ....!

peace all

karen

Ouch. That sounds quite painful. Well no wonder them bouncers are so
ornery... Wouldn't you be if you had to sit on yer hemorrhoids all
night while gleeful ravers with freed minds and following asses jiggled
and bounced all night long? To say nothing about those bunions and that
painful ingrown third-eye. Oy. Like my momma once told me -- hit the
Sphinxter and you'll walk like an Egyptian. I ain't Lion! Hell, I'll

With all the talk about gettin us in the Guardian...

I've been checking out the Guardian Online beta, and there's a 
forum there on the web, where people primarily swap web sites.

I thought of mentioning hyperreal, then decided to check with everyone first.

Now, these are beta testers, so maybe they're more open minded/intelligent 
(assumption?), and see the positive aspects of our culture. This might 
encourage the staff at the Guardian to give us some positive publicity 
(hopefully of our choosing).

Then again, it could backfire.....and we're fucked (until we all get PGP).


later...

Just got back from an afternoon floating around the exhibit hall at the
Moscone Center, chatting with a buncha suits'n'marketroids at DB Expo
(the annual database trade show).  Actually, it's a good show, and you
can get in for free if you can find one of the ubiquitous free-entry
forms.  

Got in Friday evening to SF.  Dougie Fresh, John Handi and I went over to
Dust in the Loading Dock Lounge, a nice place buried in the Stevenson
alleyway between Mission and Market at 10th.  Think Cheers, South of Market
release :-)  There was some kind of corporate get-together happening when
we got there, and some even stayed once the sound started up.  Our friend
James D was first up with an excellent set of trance, techno and trancey
house, followed by John Carroll (?) with a smooth trancey set.  Got a very
nice feeling from the Speedy J track off G Spot he played.  The room is
comfortable and sounds good, they even brought in a portable dance floor
(rubberized mats) and the beer is good too :)

James D and his friend Gilda and I high-tailed it over to 1015 Folsom to
check in with Brothers & Sisters, where Markie had a *hot* 2 am set
(he just RIPPED for about 45 minutes before reverting to more conventional
fare), and then Tracy did a wonderful house/trance set.  Just wish more
people were there, but those who were got off pretty well.  It's still
a Friday night club scene, but it's more than just ordinary, that's for
sure.  

I did a lot of spinning at Ameba Saturday afternoon.  Even let a certainw
well-known passer-by spin some of my records for a while :-)

Saturday night was the New Moon, which ended up being at Il Pirata due to
the incredibly wet and unseasonal weather.  The event didn't really get off
for me, but I think it was more my own state of mind than anything. 
Nonetheless, a good sendoff for Mona who's going back to work with her
family for a couple of months.  I stopped in for a little while down the
street at Reds, where the vibe was groovy and relaxed.  I caught a little
of Ethan's set and then the beginning of Susan's (who I haven't seen for
quite some time -- she's been in Florida).  Nice one, Tom and Monica and
Bryce and everyone who worked on that one.  Bryce gave me the coolest
hand-drawn entry stamp I've ever gotten :)

We had hopes of a Sunset on Sunday, but of course it continued to be damp
and wet.  Instead, I ended up meeting a couple of online acquaintances
from Germany who are in town until May 10th.  They are known as Station
Rose but those of us on the Well know them as <gunafa@well.sf.ca.us> or
just Gary and Elisa.  We met up at Ameba, zoomed down to the Whole Life
Expo for a quick run-through of the exhibit area, then went out tod
dinner and finally got a chance to hear Station Rose's third interactive
CD-ROM (their first was in 1991), with Gary's very fine Internet-inspired
melodic techno tracks, although we couldn't view the visual stuff because
of not having a CD-ROM player handy.  Station Rose'
s new release is out May 15 in Germany and soon after here in the states,
and I'd recommend it and not simply because they're my friends!  They'll
be back in the fall and I hope we can collaborate on some special life
events.

Monday I spent a fair bit of time at Soundworks on Valencia, and came away
wondering why I hadn't gotten motivated to check the store out (they opened
15 months ago).  Nice selection, very good on ambient and trance, lots of
CDs, and heavy on 'progressive' house.  Very little overlap with the other
DJ stores like BPM and Tweekin.  I recommend it!  They're at 228 Valencia,
near 14th, not far from Market, right next to the historic Levi Strauss
building.

Monday evening I got a chance to check in to the Gardening Club after a 
long break (usually I have to go back to Portland by Monday evening).
And it was well worth it.  I just missed Charles Edwards playing, but
Gamall cranked up an outstanding expanded-jungle set, which Allen Ameba
previously mentioned, and I'd rank it as the best single set I heard
all weekend (even including the excellent ones by Markie and Tracy at
1015 on Friday).  Felix followed with a fine dub-oriented one to finish
things out.

The music out there right now is *really* good, people, you just have to
check out the smaller and even club-based events and be prepared to take
some chances!

It may be a while before I come back to SF, so have a great month everyone!

Hey B-

I think Yahoo is pretty general anyway (though I haven't used it yet, so 
I don't know). 

Perhaps that's why there's no specific mention of regional stuff.

But then, once someone's on hyperreal, they can get to anything they 
want. Anyone curious enough will find the calander (among other things).

Question is, will "outside" access jepordize what we're doing? 

That's my concern.

Jonas,
how ya doing, haven't talked to ya in a while.

I share your concern.  I think we still are able to keep things pretty 
underground with our net communication.  I wouldn't want to have to just 
rely on word of mouth for underground parties, like they do with the full 
moon.  Its really a hassle for me sometimes to find the location of those 
sometimes.
hope to see ya tonight at come/unity

Going home last night I got to thinking ... and I realized that here in
Vancouver I could think of no less than ten nightclubs off the top of my
head each of which features at least one night of what I would term
underground.  Four of them (Graceland, MaRS, Richards on Richards and the
Commodore) are the biggest and best-known clubs in town.  The Commodore is
also the oldest club in town, having been around since the 1920's.

All of these venues frequently feature excellent local djs like Lace,
Markem (yeah okay, he came here from somewhere else), Prettyboy, T-Bone,
Czech, Isis, Little T ..... now, does this mean it's commercialized?  Or
just that people want to get out there and have a good time listening to
good music in a safe environment during the week?  Food for thought ....


peace all

Frazer,
Really really cool to see you at the art expo the other day.  The more I 
thought about what Terrence said the more I realize that it has to make 
sense if, for nothing else other then logic, a result of an explosion is 
most powerful directly after that explosion not towards the end of it's 
after math; that seems to me to be just a question of basic common 
sense.  But then their is the other concept of there was a big bang at 
the super beginings of time and this (above) idea held true and we started 
off as beings so well developed that we could transcend time and location 
virtually instantaniously and that we have been going down the overall 
universal evoloution line ever since.  Also, there is always this idea of 
worlds (inc Earth) that had much more highly developed cultures/lifeforms 
in their past and, for usually unknown reasons, dissapeared/went away 
and, after a long period of absoloute stagnation, a lesser civilization 
came to take it's place.  This could deffinatly be said of Earth and 
ideas connected to this theory have been explored in books such as 2001, 
Greek/Roman mythology, The Marshian Chronicals and movies such as The 
Forbiden Planet.  It has also happened, in micro cosom, in our planets
most recent history (eg.Chiniese/Greek/Roman, then the (so-called) dark ages,
then the Rinaissance and so on.  Either way is as valid as the other and it is 
interesting to think about.
What is also interesting to think about is going to the Rainbow gathering 
in Taos.  S.P.A.Z. are going on tour then and we will try and hook up 
with you down there.  Or I might just head straight down there with you 
guys (British possie in full effect and all that).  Either way I am 
totally there 100%.  You also said that you were going to be doing a rave 
afterwards but are you not going to be doing one during the whole week?  
One week festival=7 days of 24 hour raving if you ask me!  If so, could 
me and me mate try out ideas we have had for a lazer/visual/music thing; 
and could I dj?  presumably you will have decks and all that ting? (or 
are you going to dat it?)
Also please give us a call I need you to sign more of those bloody Ga 
forms for me.  I hope you are well.
Love and respect,
Tristan.

sound of the underground...
True story: When I was a kid of 6 years or so, a friend once asked me what was
underground, you know, really deep below the backyard flowerbeds. Like any
budding science geek, rather than admit I didn't know, I explained that in
between the surface layers and the glowing magma center, there is this layer of
clear cold water with a ceiling and a floor of tiles more beautiful than any
swimming pool in the world. When people drill to make a well, they have to be
careful not to jab the blind octopuses and dolphins that live there.

You guys are right, there is an underground sound, feel, culture. But I wonder
whether that results from the noncommercial, anarchistic environment of renegade
or underpromoted parties, or the other way round. Being a believer in basically-good
human nature, I like to think that given an unstructured space, the mind and
soul create interesting things. Someday, I'm gonna buy me a big
acoustically-insulated warehouse (ha!) and invite all my favorite DJs and their
two friends (and their two friends, and their two friends, and so on, to borrow
a hair care cliche) to play any hour of the day or night they want!

More than for any other scene I've ever experienced, I do have optimism that
this scene will never place velvet ropes and picky doorpeople at its gates.

Thanks for the collective tips on the SF clubs to visit! I've been meaning to
get to the Gardening club for a while. For my south-bay compadres, I've liked
Open House and I often hear the Velvet Shop is good, too. 

take care all!

Yeah, I thought the ambienty jungle stuff worked very nicely in that
enviroment(kinda ambienty jungly itself ain't it?) Though I didn't feel
compelled to dance, I had a good time chillin in a bean bag checkin the
visuals eating some yummy caribe food stuffs.  And sitting in that plane
really encourages conversation for some reason...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Void

Brothers and sisters of the underground, free you minds of the chains
of the material world.  Come with us into "The Void", a place where
time, space and value do not exist.  A place where sound draws a
picture on a blank wall.  A place where people are motivated by soul
and the need to overcome against all odds.  A place where, in Detroit,
everyone has to visit due to the hardships and setbacks of the surface
world.  Come with us to the other side.  "The Underground".  A place
where only your mind can take you!

                    See you in the other world.

                               Peace.

                                                    The Unknown Writer

i loved so much what you said here.  You totally grasped an intense 
conceptually understanding of the notion of "underground", and articulated 
this concept so well. 
Thank you!!These phrases make me so happy, hurl me into a wonderful state 
of mind, and allow me to visualize life in new ways.

RAVE CULTURE AND THE END OF THE WORLD [part 1]

( from a speech given by Fraser Clark to 300 students at Stanford
University on May 2nd this year, at the invitation of Richard Powers,
Dance Historian.)


I'd like to correct one thing Richard said in his introduction.  He said
he was looking for someone who had thought about Rave Culture long enough
to be able to do more than sit there and say "Raving is cool..." Well, I'm
here to tell you that Raving is *not* "cool".  It's *hot*.  It's an
involving and life-changing activity.  In fact the last time I heard the
word "cool" used frequently was in London immediately before Hippy burst
upon the scene.  People would stand around at parties posing, in clothes
or opinions, looking "cool". And then Hippy burst through the door.  And
promptly tripped and fell flat on his face.  Got up, muttering something
mystical while knocking something over.  Hippy was living Life far too
intensely to be cool.  He was *hot*.  And with Rave Culture here in
America I feel we are exactly back at that point again. 

So could we have a show of hands -
How many people have been to a rave?  (about 30 of the audience)
How many people have a modem?  (same number).
Ah, weUd better check.  How many have been to a rave *and* have a modem? 
About 15 - so that tells us something.

So.  Richard gave you a pretty fair introduction to what I'm about, but
let me establish my credentials this way. I studied Psychology as a young
man in the hope it would help me understand myself and the world I lived
in a bit better.  I graduated in 1965 with an Honours Degree, but all I
came away with was more of an understanding of white rats than I actually
wanted.  To tell the truth, I was shocked to my core by the terrible
suffering we inflicted on those poor creatures and others. 

I became a hippy that summer ,1965, and lived through the whole fashion
cycle and then continued to be a hippy after that until I became a Zippy
in the mid '80s.  I had to invent the Zippy concept at that time in order
to define who I was and who the others I respected were.  Then, when the
Rave Scene exploded in 1986 in Manchester and London, I was probably the
first person over 25 to get involved, and I've been deeply involved in it
ever since, right up to now.  And, as Richard said, not just raving but
organising raves, publishing magazines, philosophising about the growth of
Rave Culture, and working politically to defend and extend its sphere of 
influence. 

So, if you accept the case I shall develop here that Rave is Hippy PART 2
(or, more correctly, HIPPY THE CONCLUSION) (and by no means all ravers do)
then there can't be a greater authority on the subject than myself. That's
just a fact, and I'm not boasting.  But I *am* boasting, because I feel
very proud to be part of the current Rave Culture that is growing in all
developed countries and in many others too because I am convinced it is
the greatest possible good news the planet could hope for. 

I am not a Hippy now, by the way.  I'm a Zippy.  The Zippy stands between
the Hippy and the Yuppy, with one foot in technology and the other in the
spiritual life.  We'll come back to this. 

When the Hippies in the '60s looked at the world they concluded that both
the current world systems, Capitalism and Communism, or whatever you want
to call them, were bad, unhealthy, anti-life systems, user-unfriendly both
to the leaders and to the led. The Hippy attitude then was .. a plague on
both their houses!  And my atttude today is:  One down, one to go! 

Now, since only 2 systems were on offer, there's no reason at all to
believe that none others exist and that it has to be one or the other. 

This System left standing, the one we live under now, the one which will
fill the tremendous gap and the goddess-given opportunity left by the
collapse of the Communist system, is based quite openly on COMPETITION. 

Now I have been criticising this current system since the T60s and saying
it was user-unfriendly both to the rulers and the ruled.  And the most
frequent response was: well, how the hell can you criticise an entire
system and say it is wrong.  Who are you?  How could *you* (and a few
hundred thousand drop outs) be right and nearly everyone else wrong? 

The collapse of the Soviet System has shown that it is perfectly possible
for an *entire* system to be based in totally wrong principles so that it
is bad for rulers and ruled.  If that was the case with Communism (as most
people will now admit) then why is it outrageous to suppose that it could
be true for this system too?  After all, Communism was originally a
breakaway from what was a corrupt, competition-based system even then! 

As a psychologist I notice every day how deeply we have been conditioned
under this system, this culture, to be competitive.  I constantly hear
adults asking young children, say, what's your favorite colour?  Favorite
colour?  We have to rank colours too?!  Or your favorite food?  And so on. 
We are taught to see the world and others in a competitive way from the
very beginning and it's very difficult indeed to see any other way. 

Now some will tell you that we would never have gotten to this great
advanced stage of technological development without competition.  I don't
believe that myself but luckily we donUt have to agree about that. 

What we CAN agree on is that the system that is now the dominant one is
based in Competition and is clearly totally inappropriate for existence on
a very small planet.  The signs are everywhere. 

One more thing.  The problem of competition is not just ecological.  An
unfair competitive system also threatens everyone on a social basis too. 
Oklahoma and the Unabomber show us that this current system is *so*
competitive that it is literally starting to tear itself apart .  From the
right and from the left there is clearly a growing awareness by a lot of
people that the System is not working.  

I mean, what would cause a human being to walk into a supermarket and blow
other beings away?  Either you conclude that humanity is just crazy,
simple as that.  Or you have to ask:  what is it in our culture that is
driving people crazy?  What fear and daily stress could such terrorists
have been under to make them do such things?  What great injustice are
they suffering under?  So we have to beef up our security, obviously, to
deal with the psychopaths the system has already created, but, much more
importantly, we have to take a good hard look at our culture to see what
is causing this stress.  And perhaps we have to pray that a new, more
cooperative spirit spreads across this land of ours - and quickly. 

Karl Marx once predicted that Capitalism was bound to fall and that, when
it did, the capitalists would compete to sell the victors the rope with
which to hang themselves.  That seems to hold true today where, as fast 
as we stop one bad practice, some other competition-besotted corporation 
starts something even worse. 


So what the planet most needs today is a new COOPERATIVE culture.  Ideally
we need to see the appearance of a cooperative meme (a cultural virus that
one sees around and on the media and which infects us with the beginning
of a new lifestyle) that will rapidly spread among the population and
pretty rapidly become dominant.  And which will make a cooperative
attitude fashionable and established that will encourage all sides to work
together. 

(I'd better explain that reference to fashion.  My viewpoint is: I don't
*care* whether someone, say, in the '60s started meditating or doing yoga or
dancing because they read about it in a magazine - what's important is to
get people to that point any way possible.  There are good and bad fashions)

There are so many things that need changing, and many many people are
doing good selfless work.  The trouble is that each of these single issues
creates more fragmentation, both with those who oppose a particular needed
change, and fragmentation with others who are working on issues that are
actually inextricably linked but not focused together. 

Somehow all these protests have to be seen and then acted upon as One
Single Overall Paradigm Shift.  If Society can make that One Shift from
Competition to Cooperation then all the lesser issues will obviously work
themselves out. 


SO, if the Human species really IS capable of changing in time, then by
this late stage in the game there should be a sign of a new cooperative
culture appearing.  And not just here and there but spreading widely and
rapidly in all western democracies. 

It should certainly involve Youth - of all ages.
It should have its own new style of music and dance.
It should provide a melting/meeting point where various activists with 
some of the answers can come together.
It should be linked with a Love of Nature It should encourage its
participants to cooperate (meaning no huge stars) It should encourage
gathering together in large numbers out in the countryside and away from
the City. 

Searching through mainstrean culture here in America there is absolutely
no sign of this happening.  Beavis and Butthead attitudes still rule.
Generation X.  Cynicsm.  Apathy.  Negativity.  Self-sufficiency.  Grunge -
whose great hero is already dead - from hard drugs.  The Punk thing, which
America is now in the dying stages of, sees no way out and merely refuses
to be part of the overall corruption and materialism.  But that is not
enough to change anything.  Certainly not in the time we available. 

Rave Culture is exploding all through the western democracies and shows
every sign of capturing America over the next year or two. 

It has no stars.  Everybody is equal on the dancefloor, and the ethos is
that everybody mucks in to help.  Rave has been going for a good 6 years
now and yet I doubt if most ravers could agree on one well established DJ
name.  Compare that to Rock'nRoll, the last great alternative/protest
culture, where already you had Superstars in the first year who are still
famous and wealthy today. And I'd guess that 9 out of 10 ravers on the
dancefloor couldn't tell you who the DJ is.  And 6 out of ten probably
couldn't even tell you *where* he is! 

In England where the economic collapse has gone much further (but it's
coming here too, believe me) young people are *forced* to cooperate.  If
you want to organise a Rave, say, someone will have records, someone else
will know a venue, someobdy else will supply a sound system and so on. 

The yuppy myth of having all the technology yourself is gone, never to 
return.

In England they call it a Depression - but it's important to notice that
that's the perception of people who believe they have something to lose. 
In my estimation, although many young people in England no longer have any
expectation of EVER having what used to be called a "PROPER JOB", there
has been a gigantic outbreak of creative energy and imagination like I've
never seen in my life, even during the Hippy times.  Everybody's
publishing their own magazines, leaflets, mixing music, organising raves
and social protests, everybody's busy busy busy being creative. 

When I arrived with some Zippy types for the US Tour last year we all felt
like we were moving at light speed compared to the constipated
competition-blocked energy we found here.  It's as if the collapse of the
Old System has unblocked this creatrvity and imagination in people.  In
*the* people.

Hey all!
I'm back from come/unity and I'm still vibrating from it, so I thought 
I'd share some of those vibrations :)
OOOOOOOoooooWWWwweeeeeeee what a party!  The shared energy of that place 
was incredible.  It was real crowded, more so than my usual likings, but it 
didn't matter tonight as the vibe was so beautiful.  At one point it was 
so crowded on the dance floor all I could do to dance was raise my arm in 
the air a vibrate.  I noticed all those around me vibrating as well.  And 
it was great because we were all vibrating together.
There were other times with some room to dance, which was incredible 
because the shared engergy from everybody dancin was an imense joy.
Everything was so great I couldn't get away from the dance floor except 
for a couple of quick breathers.  
I hope you all can feel some of this beautiful energy I got from that 
party in this post.  I just know we all share it, because this energy is 
a shared energy.

 Thanks to Fraser for posting Part 1 of his speech at Stanford, as I 
wasn't able to be in the (limited) audience. I'm planning to print out
both parts when Part 2 ( with the Question and Answer session? ) is
available.

How cool!  I haven't been to a Come-Unity party since a moved away from SF 
over year ago.  I sure miss it.  Thanks for the shared energy,  I'm going to 
take some of it to work with me to help make it through the day.

Keep on Groovin,

Well since I wrote that message about WEIRD to many people have
responded and too many people want me to write back.

Well guess what? I spent 2 1/2 hours writing everyone back. I used an
offline mail reader to respond to everyone. When I tried to send the
file, I guess it got corrupted or something. I erased the file to learn
one day later that my system was trying to tell me that the file was
bad. ow hell. it happens. Just another chain of weird events.

Something good did come out of all of these weird signs though.
READ ON
Because of these weird events I decided to do some soul serching of
sorts. I contacted an old friend of mine. This person read starcharts on
a very professional and realistic manner. That person told me to do
something.

That something was to tell a friend of mine a secret which I had kept
very dear to me. I've have only told very few people this THING, but I
knew that I had to talk. That person is here on the list ;) and now can
be considered to be one of the closest people to me.

The heart of the story isn't there though. It's the moral behind the
actions. After hearing about my starchart I am also reminded that
nothing is set in stone. I keep reminding myself that it's not what fate
dishes out, it's what we do with that fate. A good example is the
bombing in OK. hundreds of people pithed in to help with the hospitals
and the wounded. These people could have easily sat and watched like we
did here in Calif. but the got up and risked their lives for others.

As this letter babbles on I realize again that I ha ve complete control
over my decisions. Humans don't realize they had a good thing till they
lost it. Sometimes we look to the obvious instead of taking off our
blinders and looking at the simple forms of satisfaction.

I got a simple form of satisfaction tonight. Tonight I donated my sound
and time for an AIDS benifit concert here at Sacramento State
University(CSUS). It was a horrible night.At first(blinders still on)
The sound board went out twice(thank god I can solder 5 wires in 5
minutes) the amplifiers kept blowing the breakers, the room was really
hard to EQ for.......... the list keeps going. I didn't stop trying my
best though. Finnally the  night was over and I just turned down
the equipment. The people holding the event were nice enough to plug my
name a few times. Right after that a young female and her boyfriend
walked up to me and gave me a big smile. They said thank you and
complimented me on my preserverence(SP). I was about to say that it was
horrible but I thought for a half a second and replied"thanx", and
smiled.(blinder now off)

That second I was reminded that fate was handing me these horrible
circumstances but I kept going, and wouldn't stop until I got home. I
was in complete control tonight. Thats the satisfaction that we all seem
to overlook on a day to day basis.

This weekend I'm going to oregon to enjoy everything about it. I know
most of you probably stopped reading by now, but thats ok because I'm
kinda tired and I've been really way to busy to post lately.
I wrote a poem about self reliance.
Thank you everyone for reading:

                          Take from fate:

                       I look to the sky
                       For some king of sorts
                       A man in control of my fate
                       Who doesn't know what I want
                       Who doesn't care of my needs
                       Just sits on his butt and pulls some strings

                       I yell to the man
                       "What in the world
                         Do you think your doing?"

                       "Pulling strings, what else"

                       He made me mad
                       I was furious at what he gave.

                       A man in the high
                       He merely contorts
                       "What is your fate"
                       He looks at me as if to taunt
                       He avoids my pot of needs
                       He topples over the lanes of time

                       The man yells again
                       "your lucky,
                        all I can ever do is pull these strings"


the moral is: You have all the control!

The wonderful energy Peter feels is still going on with many of us who attended 
ComeUnity last night.  In fact, it continued to infectiously spread at the 
afterparty at ?Martini's? ("NEXT" @ 9th & Howard) which is still going off 
(until noon).  For those of you who hear the high pitched ringing in our ears 
connecting our higher consciousness, smile and allow the white light to embody 
you.  This is the loving vibe that continues to keep the scene alive and 
growing.

I had to leave to be at work at 8am but I still feel the warm hugs and loving 
vibe of so many brothers and sisters that I just had to say, yes...Yes...YES, 
Peter!  Thanks for sharing your warm, loving energy with the sfraves group.  And
may our affections in life continue to warm the hearts of all who read this.

Diane

How cool!  I haven't been to a Come-Unity party since a moved away from SF 
over year ago.  I sure miss it.  Thanks for the shared energy,  I'm going to 
take some of it to work with me to help make it through the day.

Yes! Come/Unity always delivers.  This party was originally started by
Malachy, Simon, Garth and Jeno and still carries some of Mal's magic.
It was originally a "scenester's" party due to the fact that it was always
the first Thursday of the Month and only folks who didn't have a job the
next day (or didn't care that they had a job :) would come out for it.
It's a lot more crowded now but still has some of that initial magic,
especially when 2:00 comes and all of the hardcore drinkers leave.
I have to put on a suit and be at a business meeting at noon today or I would
have been there :( even with that, it was still a close call, this meeting
I can't afford to fuck up though, (oh the trials and tribulations of an
Internet entrepreneur :)

On  Wed, 3 May 1995, Carlos E Soto said;

>i was really glad to see a great rave that wasn't overpriced and overhypped.

And I would have to agree.  I had a wonderful time.  Felt some really great 
vibes dancing till 6:30.  I really liked the last dj (don't know who it was) 
but it seemed like perfect morning music.  Had a couple of friends who had
never been to a rave and they really liked it to. (We started trying to leave
around 5:00 and every time we got close to the door the music sucked us back
in.)

What's with charging 50c for tap water though.  The Troc usually has free tap
water.  (They only did this after alchool sales were over.)

Andrew, thanks for sharing, and the lessons in preserverence and self directed
destiny.  Through the energies and efforts we put out we help to create and 
shape our destiny and fate.  While it's not all our own doing, what we do has 
alot of influence over what happens to us, and not letting the bad energies
control or misdirect us is a great step.

Thanks for the wonderful poem also.

Here's a poem I wrote (actually, the poem wrote me).
Comments?

	Tweakin'

Shimmering zing chips suffer passing adoration,
Indifferent to the mutilation others wreak,
All around now, flakes abruptly whiffed,
Cristy burns a numbing phosphor streak.

See darting eyes transfix a trembling key,
Partake phat bumps and climb a steeper peak,
What next, we tweak, I've done it all before,
Just one more shard, demands a sassy freak.

Grrrinders behold, with jaw beyond control,
The edge of sketch is sending vibes oblique,
So, converse in mutual monologue,
Welcome to the world of tweak.

Ashes to ashes, dust we must,
Borrow from tomorrow, up to a week,
It's often fun, confess the spun,
Of contradiction, the most subtle reek.

Living matter as ceaseless chatter,
Not awake, not asleep, the jaded speak,
Of tweakers watching banter dissipate,
Into the dawn, when symbols leak.

After an unexplained absence, I'm glad to be back.  (I can hear
it now: "You left?")  Having missed F&F (out of town) and, no
doubt, some other good stuff, I'm ready for the traffic (new
net connection).  New physical house, too, which may become the
site of a future party (read: big, isolated).

Anyone get Steve's (resonate) address in Brazil?  Our fax machine
barfed and I missed it when he sent it to me.

MORE FUN FOR EVERYONE!!.  
RAVE CULTURE MEANS THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT . [part 2] 
(an essay developed from a speech given by Fraser Clark to 300 students at
Stanford University on May 2nd this year, at the invitation of Richard
Powers, Dance Historian.)

I spent a lot of my early "Hippy" life after University exploring the
planet ln search of a culture to ally myself with which would be evolved
enough in a true sense to look at the Western model with a wise eye and be
able to say:  we like the modem, we'll take the digital recording stuff
and this and that, but we don't want the rest of it at all., none of it. 
Now look what *we*'ve got.  Check out *this* shamanic technology. Though I
found many such individuals over the years, I was finally forced to
conclude that there is no way for a culture or social system to resist the
commercial entrapment attack (unless maybe the muslim religion) . The
number of times my meditation was interrupted in India by enquiries as to
how many diamonds were in my watch!  When I never even knew of these
diamonds myself! 

Finally after 2 decades I realised that as long as the dominant driving
power is the Western competitive "progress" meme, then materialism, with
all its attendant exploitation of natural resources, general pollution and
middleclass social division, is a stage each culture must now witness for
itself before it can hope to see beyond it. 

In short, I came back to the very belly of the beast to work from within. 
And, after a few years of analysing and re-exploring where the West had
further devolved to, both in Europe and in America, re-connecting with old
colleagues and friends and defining what we were about, we hatched our
Zippy Conspiracy to Save the Planet.  This involved -

First:  An agreed analysis of the sum total of basic problems .  These
were pretty much what I've just outlined, plus the basic agreement that
the essence of the problem was psychological, no true conspiracies though
thousands of lesser ones existed, and therefore the Solution lay within
the culture itself, not within the system. 

Second we identified where the most hope for real change might appear. 
This was clearly in Youth Culture, where you find the most idealism and
experimentalism, and the least commitment to the current competitive
structure.  Plus, curiously enough, the least government control, largely
because the "pop/entertainment world" just isn't taken seriously.  So we
chose to work at the extreme end of the entertainment world - in
*edutainment*.  Not only would we gain a lot of attention before the
powers that be even took serious notice of us, but then, when they did, we
would be serious enough and with enough "serious" connections and inroads
into the system itself, as to be almost respectable.  I think we've
achieved that. 

Third we calculated, almost mathematically, just what the average new
lifestyle should be in order to return humanity to a cooperative
relationship with the planet.  Here is where Zippy first coalesced. 
Harmonising the Tecno and Hippy hemispheres, in Self and on Planet. 

Fourthly we set about making that lifestyle fashionable.  And linking in
with all people of good will who were already living that way.  Since we'd
already agreed that there were no villains, just psychological victims,
this further allowed us to agree that our Message was More Fun For
Everyone!!  And it's true. Everybody, without exception, will have more
fun under a more cooperative culture.  And zat iss an order.  And from
there to the feeling that all we would really be doing would be to provide
a stage for all good creative people to "help each other" it was not hard
to go all the way to pronoia - the sneaking suspicion that others are
conspiring behind your back and without your knowledge to help you. 

Now it's not that hard to work out.  We need a new lifestyle to rapidly
become fashionable that encourages people to feel hip if they're lowering
their consumption expectations and demands, getting more imaginative and
cooperative by trimming costs and pooling facilities, and being more
gentle and more shamanic at the same time. A Cooperative meme.  Not just
with each other but with others who are not part of the movement.  We
don't want a confrontational attitude - that will just spread the problem. 
We're fighting and partying for *their* fun too!! We're about cooperation.

We called it ZIPPY.  And here's the definition of Zippy.  A Zippy is
someone who, perceiving the imbalance in his mind between his Tecnoperson
hemisphere (which values long term planning, group endeavour, proper
budgeting, patience and perseverance) and his Hippy hemisphere (which
values spontaneity, living in the moment, personal whim, mysticism and
detachment,) and between those two hemispheres on his planet, is working
to harmonise them again, both in himself and on his planet.  Notice that a
Zippy is working towards this balance - he hasn'tt necessarily achieved it
yet. 

And of course we based in our calculations that the technology would start
becoming seriously affordable to many young people. 

This cut straight across the Old Paradigm of Straight and Alternative.  A
zippy could be a businessman taking a yoga class or a Rainbowlady setting
up her own little hemp stall business at a rave.  Each is activating their
previously ignored hemisphere.  And a businessman who wasn't exploring
his hippy hemisphere or a hippy who wasn't increasing his engagement with
the world were not Zippies. 


AND THEN THE "ACID HOUSE PARTY" BURST THROUGH MY DOOR!  

But let me back up a bit, for the truth is that, before we can plumb the
depth and breadth of the Rave phenomenon and then attempt to place Rave
Culture within its proper context, we need some real understanding of what
that gigantic social movement of the Sixties was about.  For the fact that
there are already more ravers on the planet than there were hippies at the
height of that phenomenon, AND YET MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL NOT EVEN AWARE OF
IT, testifies to the sheer scale of this nineties, millennial phenomenon
which is still, even today 6 years after its birth, only in its infancy. 
The older folk haven't even hardly started getting involved yet - as they
did in the '60s too! 

Hippy, then, involved a political component, an ecological component, and
a personal/spiritual component. 

THE POLITICAL COMPONENT was rather an attempt to go beyond the Old
Competitive Politics which seemed just destructive and unintelligent.  An
Opposition in the governing body whose *duty* was simply to oppose?! 
Basically, as I've said, what Hippies decided was that the two current
competing world systems were fundamentally user-unfriendly, both for the
masses, who were starving for soul food and peace, and for the so-called
leaders who were dropping from cancer and heart attacks.  A plague on both
their houses was our conclusion, and ONE DOWN AND ONE TO GO our attitude
today. 

THE ECOLOGICAL COMPONENT was this:  becoming a hippy involved DROPPING OUT
- of a System that we saw was suffocating everyone and killing the planet. 
It was a brave personal decision to basically reduce one's own personal
level of consumption by roughly three quarters.  That was what the planet
needed.  And that's what the Hippy opted for. 

And I have continued to live that way ever since - as have hundreds of
thousands of good people around the planet.  And I say:  we were right
about that too.  If everybody, possessed of much the same facts as we, had
had the courage and intelligence to make the same decision then, we would
today be passing on to you, the next generation, a very healthily
balanced, preserved and developed planet, instead of this terrible mess.
But most people did not have the courage or the intelligence or whatever
it was, and now they are being forced to make those changes. 

THE PERSONAL/SPIRITUAL COMPONENT brings us directly to the Rave.  The
Hippy conclusion, after many experiments, successful and otherwise
(remember that we were exploring territory that Western culture had never
delved into before, certainly not on the mass scale that we did) was that
the only hope for the planet and for WoMankind who was the only threat to
it, was that some device or technique would be discovered (or more likely
re-discovered) that would enable every person in the West to GET OUT OF
THEIR HEADS !  AND BACK INTO THEIR HEARTS AND BODIES!  To get those three
brains, the intellectual brain, the emotional brain and the
physical-moving brain (as a great teacher George Gurdjieff used to put it)
back into harmony, and working cooperatively together. 

Today, every high street in Britain, and increasingly in the rest of the
West, boasts a club which is offering just such a facility.  The ancient
shamanic consciousness-raising, ego-meltdown, boundary-dissolving
technology of African-style nonstop dancing to an insistent tribal
drumbeat enhanced by the most futuristic technolgised electronic
virtuality is getting an entire generation OUT OF THEIR HEADS and back
into balance. 


So there I was, editing & publishing the Encyclopaedia Psychedelica,
predicting a massive new outburst of "mass consciousness raising" when
through my door burst the Scoobie Doobies, two young designers dressed in
colorful clothes and looking bright-eyed and enthusiastic.  This was in
the dark days of Punk, remember .  Indeed, as soon as I got involved in
the Rave scene, I coined the phrase:  "Why is everybody still wearig
black?  Haven't they heard the Funeral's been cancelled?"

The Rave scene had been happening around the corner for 6 months!

The first rave club I attended was called SHOOM and it was run by Danny
Rampling who, if he had not remained a yuppie at heart, would now be very
famous indeed.  And the first thing I noticed and wondered about was that
the 3000 ravers there were DRESSING DOWN in simple jogging suits and big
loose t-shirts.  What spirit in these smart young people would make them
want to dress down?!  Obviously because they were seriously dancing. 

The first open-air "Acid House Party" I attended was by a possee called
Sunrise, run by a young ex-gambler called Tony Colston-Hayter, who was
soon being interviewed on all the media as the "acid house king". 

There were 20,000 kids packed in a field 20 miles from London, surrounded
by a Big Dipper, a ferris wheel, stalls selling champagne, hot dogs etc,
with me the only one over 25.  We'd gotten there by following the
instructions on our full colour flier, calling the hot lines from various
map points, all carefully organised so that 5000 people were descending on
the spot from 4 different but simultanous directions in order to prevent
the police from discovering and preventing the all-night party.  Once we
were in it was a "potential riot situation" and the cops would leave us
alone. 

I remember Tony halting the music to announce  "They've hit us with 12 
injunctions but they haven't stopped the party!"   I could see there was 
rebellion and determination in the scene.
 
The closest the mind could contextualise what I was seeing was the hippy
festival but this was assuredly a new fractal.  Social developments don't
go in cycles or even in spirals.  They go in fractals, with each bearing
self-similarities but each bigger than the one before and travelling
further and further from the gravitational pull of the Old Paradigm until
finally we fall under the pull of a new Strange Attractor and go off in an
entirely new direction with no return. 

There were differences, however, and I don't want to hide them.  And the
primary one was that these ravers were not hippies, they were yuppies. 
Smart, maybe even smart-assed, levelheaded, savvy and entrepreneurial. 
Indeed I remember one young yuppy female raver exclaiming:  "Isn't it
great?  You work really hard all week and you rave really hard all
weekend?!" She was perfectly content to be a part of the system, so long
as she could let it all rip at the weekend..  Call her a "weekend hippy",
except that those came much later in the Hippy thing when it had become
fashionable, but here they were *all* weekend ravers!  Already, so early 
in the fractal! 

If Mrs Thatcher's call for "entrepreneurial spirit" had been real, she
would not have tried to stamp Raving out, she'd have supported it, and it
would have been an entirely healthy regeneration of the culture and would
now be Britain's greatest cultural export to the world, sort of like the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones of the '60s.  I mean people like Tony were
charging $40 a head x 20000 = $800,000 in one night! 
 
But Maggie Thatcher's brand of enterprise was puritanical, mean spirited,
middleclass and middlebrow, and she was protecting her own
Conservative-supporting industrial barons and the status quo.  She did
*not* appreciate the freedom and sudden shifts of power that true
enterprise can bring about. 

And when the kids saw the full power of the state turned against them, for
doing what she had advised them to do, they began to question the system
for the first time in their lives and a long and inevitable process of
radicalisation was begun. 

Another difference was the volume and pervasiveness of the music, its deep
bass tecnotronic beats carried everywhere, and dancing continued
everywhere, people even danced to the champagne stall.  This was not music
to lay back and listen passively to, from a distance, or confined to one
place so you could get away from it.  This was involving, these kids
wanted to be surrounded by it.  And this is crucially different from the
Hippy style.  Rave culture is dance-based.  Dance is not some optional
extra.  If you watch old hippy/Woodstock footage, you'll see a few girls
dancing in the foreground (that's why the camera was set up there in the
first place) but most people are sitting around, listening to the bands,
puffing, and so on. 

And the third crucial difference was what these young people told me: 
they were NOT hippies!  They were very insistent on this.  And proud of
it.  And that's one of its strengths - this was *not* invented by old
hippy conspirators like me.  This was a spontaneous eruption from among
youth itself.  This is Rave's ultimate validation. 

And yet, without question, it was, from the Zippy viewpoint, the Hippy 
hemisphere of their minds that they were activating.

FRIDAY MAY 12TH FROM 9PM TILL DAWN

Megatripolis
PARALLEL UNIVERSITY
presents
the setting-up-base-camp party
for the 
CYBERLAB 7 SAFARI
across the Unknown Continent of Virtual Africa
INTO the future perfect state 
of
NOW AND ZEN

skintelligent raving out of our heads and back into our hearts and bodies!

live African trance drumming
tecno-organic bedouin market
snakes, pyramids and fruit
5 video projectors of ancient cities and future megatripoli
electro-pagan slide shows and ancient-modern technologies

with an ambient lecture by tecno shaman DAN MAPES on 
"NOW THE GOOD NEWS - GAIA COMES OF AGE!" 
(As the Planet reaches Self-Awareness, the new cyber-technology allows Her
to shyly Aware other entities in the Galaxy and so We begin Our Entrance
into the Stage of Alien Communications.) 
Dan is convinced that the People at the Top want to put down their tools
and party!  Increasingly they want what they call "the new consciousness"
which is exactly the cooperative meme that the alternative community has
been exploring for 3 decades!! 

So what's stopping them?  
Just the understanding that there really IS enough to go round!
And there really IS!

mud hut modems for Africa!  (mudems) 
in preparation for world's first UN global vote

PLAY WITH, ON and THROUGH

Universe,

We are off to Oregon this morning. I can't sleep and I'm to drive all of
us up. Brian Darkness was the only on actually avail to go. He is, right
as I type, asleep at my friends house. This message is of no real
importance but to say fare-well. Be sure to write me a lot so I can
spend all my time checking my mail when I get back.

\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

BTW- ANYONE IN OREGON GOING TO KINDNESS LOOK FOR ME
I'll be wearing a red shirt with A big @ on the back.
I will also have my big Ted-E bear with me. Give me and my bear a hug
and introduce me to all of your friends and I will return the favor.

Well my BBS is shutting down for maitnence. See you all in Cyber-space!

I agree wholeheartedly.....It's nice to know these feelings exist 
especially after all the harsh words and flames going on a couple of 
weeks ago.  I almost thought this list was a goner...i'm so glad I was wrong.

love,
Amy

I went to velvet shop last night for the first time, and it was pretty
good.  The music was ok at first then Markie got on the wheels (X3), and
the people started pouring in. It got so stuffy in there I had to back out
to the patio to get some fresh air. I met Rich Cooley an up n coming DJ,
who by the way is spinning @ the Velvet Shop next Thursday.  I met some
wonderful people and saw some friends so it made the experience that much
better.  Its a great place to relax and listen to some music, as far as
during the week goes (work gets the best of me).

The sound at this place is pretty good.  The crowd is inbetween, and the
music depends on the DJ.  So thats what I thought of it. I'll definitely
go next week.  What do other people think?

I attended and enjoyed Fraser's talk at Stanford.  Some students seemed to
not understand what Fraser was saying, but many seemed inspired and stayed
after "class" for Q&A (I had to leave).  Thanks to Kate for illustration of
the concept!  I appreciate posting of the text to share.

Grateful,

	Should Wicked be good tonite?  I have a big midterm on Monday and 
am hoping it'll be worth the (minor) academic sacrifice.

	Thanks.

p.s. This is my first post and tonite will be only my second rave.
p.p.s. How much is wicked? Age 18+ or 21+? (I called the #, but got no 
such info)

I believe I made a poor choice in my Friday experience.  Although I had the
floor to myself I did actually want there to be people to connect with...

A true disappointment.  There were about 15 people at this show and it was
sad.  Good tunes and visuals but the lack of company and dance partners just
killed it.  I did have a good time because I always have a good time and I
got a chance to experiment with some dance moves...

Looks like smarties and wicked are getting all the attention this weekend.
Have a good day all.

hey everyone,

  well made my way up to "Sac" last night for smarties.  it was my first
time really going to another party on the west coast outside of the
sf/bay scene.  all i gotz to say i,"oh yeaaaahhhhh!"

   this party rocked it hard.  i was going mostly to take pictures and
really wasnt expecting much.  went with a friend and we got to the 
location, the califronia expo around midnight.  when we first got in
the music wasnt that pumpin and the place was still filling up.  
   a beautiful set-up.  a fairly large rectangular room which at the
far end had a AMAZING set-up of lasers in one corner, the dj and the
speaker stacks in the other.   on the other side was a projection
booth and the projections of different lights slides, etc.  on the
wall.  
   there wern't any other lights, intellabeams and stuff.  i thought i was
going to miss it as the night, but it didnt.  the lasers, and the 
projections and the way they were used were incredible.  it was
a lot of fun when you just watched the laser slice through the dancing 
people in half, and create all these diffent shapes on the walls.  they 
also had mirrors positioned so that when the lasers hit them they would
go all over the place.  
   There were SO many nice pictues there i ended up taking like 4 roles.  
This lady i met, alicia,  also took another role of
pictures.  She was going all over the place :)  I'll upload the
pictures onto the sfraves hyperreal page when i get them developed
and everything.  
  after the first dj didnt get me moving.  Tony really picked up the vibe
and it was fun time dancing.  at one point i was just grooving and this 
one guy came up and was like "Show us what you have!"  over and over 
again  and you just bugged out.  then i said it to him and then he
bugged out dancing.   then we go around to other people on the dance
floor and yelll "Show us what you have!" and they bug out also.  =)
  dj dan was next.  what can i say but he is my favorite dj around here.
he can rock the fuckin house and play around with the vibe like a 
vinyl god.  man, it was so fun just watching him spin the records 
together.  
  so all in all probably the BEST big party in the area ive been to and
the best one in a long while.  The vibe, the music, the people, and the
laser ;)  made this party rock.  

peace all and see ya around, maybe at sunset =)

Below is a quote, from The I Ching, of a description from the image 
created by the hexagram "Yu" or "Enthusiasm."


THE IMAGE
Thunder comes resounding out of the earth:
The image of ENTHUSIASM.
Thus the ancient kings made music
In order to honor merit,
And offered it with splendor
To the Supreme Diety.

When, at the begining of Summer, thunder - electrical energy - comes 
rushing forth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes 
nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved.  Joy and relief make 
themselves felt.  So too, music has the power to ease tension within the 
heart and to loosen the grip of obscure emotions.  The enthusiasm of the 
heart expresses itself involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and 
rhythmic movement of the body.  From immemorial times the inspiring 
effect of the invisible sound that moves all hearts, and draws them 
together, has mystified man-kind.
Rulers have made use
 of this natural taste for music; they elevated it 
and regulated it.  Music was looked upon as something serious and holy, 
designed to purify the feelings of men.  It fell to music to glorify the 
virtues of heroes and thus to construct a bridge to the world of the 
unseen.  (Thus) in the temple men drew near to God with music and 
pantomime.  


TRISTAN.

Just thought I'd share a warm fuzzy moment with the list.
The other day we were crossing the Richmond/San Rafael bridge on our way to
spend  some quality recreation time with our doggy. As the woman at the toll
booth took our dollar she handed us a doggy bone and a big smile! 
Such small acts of kindness renew my faith in humanity. Hope that made a few
of you smile too!

Love Lydia

P.S. I still haven't met anyone on this list (except you Diane!). If anyone
spots me at WICKED or Sunset come say Hi  (long black hair dyed red on top
with a little black & white dog sometimes tagging along) .

Happiness is only a smile away.

 Holy dance - what about a holy church space for spiritual dance? Sited
properly ( not in residential areas ), rave masses would be covered by
religious freedom laws. ( If the friggin' Christian Identity racist
religion can have churches , why not ravers? ). 

 Of course , what would the core beliefs be? Catechism? Dogma?

Hello wonderful sfravers!, :)
	
	On Friday, June 2nd, there is going to be a party. A party with 
the name of "Beautiful People!" It is going to be in the Santa Cruz 
area. With DJ's: 

    	James(S.C.)- Deaks - Graeme - DRC - Trent - James(S.J.)
	
    Visuals by: Michael Clay    &    Dreamy Ambience by: Dionysus Dreams
                                         (plus special guests) :)

	Beautiful People is basically some of the minds from "Harmony" 
and "Re-Groove-A-Nation", and a bunch of others coming together, to 
bring a party for the beautiful people of our culture. We are looking 
foward to this one so much! Since this is a party for you, and is 
created by your energy, we ask that the attendants of the party follow a 
few simple requests...

	First, smiling is a requirement!! We ask that you do your 
personal duty as postitive, loving, caring and sharing individuals, and 
give out tons of hugs, and fill the party with the love that brings us 
all together as one culture! Bring toys, candy, animals(stuft), and lots 
of positive energy. Bring anything you want, exept water!!! There will 
be plenty of free bottled water for your dancing thirsts!! 

	We do have a mailing list, so if you are not on it you may call 
and leave the needed info, (E-mail, and snail mail,) on the Beautiful 
People Voicemail (408)450-3044 or on the Harmony line (408)486-9591. 
(The mailing list is the same list as the Harmony mailing list.)

	Speaking of voicemails, I would like to thank everyone who has 
been calling us and giving us feedback! It is a real "upper" for us when 
we hear from you guys! (And I am sure that goes for any and all party 
voicemails!) So, if you have never left a message on a party's 
voicemail, you should. If they (promoters) check their mail, they will 
be glad to hear from you!! 

	We'll see you in June!!! We love you!!!

Peace, love and harmony to all beautiful people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,

Shroomy, Jenn, Taylor, Kelly, Joe, and the rest of "The Crew"

Ps. I forgot to put the cost! It will be somewhere between $5-10. 
Depending on our cost for props and stuff. Goodnight... (or goodmorning, 
how ever you would like to put it!) :)

Inspired! And there is precedent: the Shakers ("The Millenia Church"), 
also known as the "Quaking Shakers," were known primarily for their 
ecstatic trance dancing in their services. This spinoff of the Quakers 
came to the States from England (appropriately) in the late 18th century 
and spread from New York State to Indiana. Very much a part of Americana now.

The movement really became strong when Ann Lee was arrested and 
imprisoned for her zeal (in England). That is when the Shakers came to 
the States and thrived.

They believed in a dual male-female deity, in unity, and community of 
possessions, pacifism, respect for and equality of the sexes. Their rituals 
were noted for their emphasis on music and trance dancing.


Hmm... sounds familiar.

Two postscripts to my last post:


Some people believe that the reason why the Millenial Church didn't 
survive was because of the timing: that wasn't the millenium. It's now.
(depending on your interpretation of millenium)

The dancing definitely wasn't couple-dancing - the Shakers were celibate*. 
Their dancing was mass-unity-group sharing and spreading of ecstatic 
spiritual energies.  


* Oh yeah, that's the other reason some people believe that Shakers 
didn't survive.

I had told myself that it would probably be a while b4 I tryed going to a 
party at dv8.  Well, with a craving to dance, and not much else in town 
to choose from, I decided to give it a go.
I got there about 2:30, and to be expected it was very crowded and 
stuffy.  The energy seemed alittle scattered to me, as I found people 
just standing around in different parts of the dance floor throughout the 
night. 
Jeno's set was good, I didn't care much for Garth's set.  A little to 
slow for my tastes.  Thomas had some really good moments.  He seemed to 
really get the crowds energy level up with his enthusiasm and dancing 
with the crowd as he spun.
I had a good time, but it was no come-unity.  Maybe I got a little 
spoiled wed night.

For those who are fans of these folks -

 Moby will be appearing at the Tocadero ( 520 4th St. @ Bryant in SF )

can be purchased at BASS/TM, Leather Tongue, Rough Trade, Reckless 
Records , and Neurotic .

 I'm going to mention Jamiroquai because I think their cape-buffalo-horn
headed-kid logo is cute - I dont really know anything about the music.
( and I've seen folks wearing the shirt ). Tuesday , May 30th at Bimbo's
365 Club - 1025 Columbus @ Chestnut in SF. 21+ . $15 adv / $16 at door.
Tickets at BASS and at the clube M-F 10AM-4PM

PS - Has the Troc been advertising the Moby show? I haven't been there
in a month , so I don't know if they've had flyers.

Hey all you ravers drifting through cyberspace!
I went to Third Society last night, and it was one of the greatest nights ever!
DJ's Ken and Mikey were positively phenomenal, cutting up great sets from 
midnight until 6 a.m... the party was going strong throughout the night, and
it was easily the most underground gathering I've ever been to!  I met so many
beautiful people: Dan, Alex, Chrissy, Mike, Ti, Jessica, Michelle, Mitch, Dave,
Michael, Joe, and so many others...it was great meeting, dancing with and just
visiting with everyone.  The visuals were modest but effective, and when the
cops came around three to respond to a noise complaint, Greg and Ken (promoters)
talked them down responsibly, and the dancing and music was allowed to continue.
Every person there was friendly, caring, and happy...another sparkling night.

Peace love unity respect blowpops stickers sweaty hugs and grins to all,
Timothy

Well,  the rumours I heard,  from a few people who've been there,  told me
that around 1:30 or 2:00 am,   someone shot someone in the leg.   The police
then shut it down.   It was held at the Graffitti Hall of fame.   Nobody had
mentioned that the police did any shooting.

I tried to go out there,  but DJ Reaver refused to get me on his guest list.
Probably a good thing I didn't go.   None of those people who went out there
had phones,  so couldn't contact them for further details,   nor would I 
believe the media.

Instead,  I went to Sabatage,  as it was raining hard,  and I suspected 
correctly that the outside party up north got cancelled.   Report 
forthcoming..

If anyone else finds out about this,   please post it....

Weekend Rave reprt
------------------

Well,  once again,  yet another report on the raves happening around Sydey.
Saturday afternoon,  was a demonstration against police violance,  in particular
the VIbe Tribe PIG attack on innocent ravers jast having fun.  Earlier in
the day,   I was up in the Blue Mts.   Pondering whether or not to try and
make it down there,  in the rain.    I arrive about 2:30 where a break in
the rain permitted about a hundred ravers to party and dance in front of
the Newtown Community center.   Not far away,  a petition was handed over
to the police station.   I got reports that earlir on,   some 300 people
showed up.
 
This evening, there is supposed to be ANARCHITECTURE,  a free rave out at
Balls Head Drive (Wherever that is).   My friend who has a car reports some
car problems,  and it just started to rain,  so another choice was Raveland,  
some type of Kiddie Kore event with a $50 admission price.   I phoned 
DJ Reaver asking to get on the guest list (I wasn't going to pay $50 for 
ANY rave,  no matter how big it is).   It's a good thing I didn't go,  
because later on,   I got reports of a shooting,  and it got shut down.   
And I still remember Smerf Village (A big commrcial event) getting shut down.
So this indicates that these big commercial events can be more unstable than
underground events.

This leaves Sabatage,  which is conveniently only a block from where I live
in Kings Cross,  so thats where I went this weekend.   To the Rooftop.

Sabatage was already very crowded when I arrived (Around 12:30).   The place
was rather small,   but had lots of cozy little rooms to chill in,  plus
upstairs (Rooftop).   The music playing up on the Rooftop Sucked,  playing
"Rockin Robin - a 50's OLDIE"  Yukk!!   But I didn't go up there to dance,
just to chill.

As usual,  the music was conventional trancy house,  and I immediately got
into the groove (next to the fan,  of course).  Sheen was spining when I
arrived,   putting down some seamless beats until Phil went on.   As usual,
Phil layed down some really spacey trancey house.   Look for Phil Smart in
SF in July.

At about 3 AM or so,  I met some people coming back from Raveland,  who 
reports an unfortunate incident of a shooting.   Apparently,  someone shot
someone in the leg,  and shortly after that,  the police shut it down.

Sugar Ray went on next,  and literally had the whole place shakin.  WOW!!
Some really great house.....  

Things ended around 6:30,  and by that time,  I was so nausiated from all the
smoke that I almost puked.   Later on,  I felt like having breakfast and heading
out to Recovery at the Pavillion.

I arrived around 9 am,   hardly anyone was there,  so I split and came back
later.   It seems that in Australia,  the recovery parties start late in the
aternoon instead of early in the morning.   The recovery party had lots of
Happy Hard core,  and in the following weeks,  are holding a DJ contest.  
I have no clue on how they score these contests,   but I met one such DJ
who claims that he STARTS OFF at 200 BPM,  and ends at 320B BPM,  and brags
that he can empty the dance floor very quickly.   I won't dispute that,
but after about 260 BPM,   things just get a tad strange.

I danced all day long at the Pavillion Tavern,  grooving on the Happy Hardcore
sets,  but I think I heard just about every combination of mix possible and
very limited variaty,  and throughout the day,  I heard the same song played
6 times.....

Anyway,   after dancing continiously from 12 mid to about 9 pm the next day,
I feel GREAT!!  And looking forward to yet another raving weekend.

I don't get it whazzup with this basement trip and Wicked.  There's a 
sardine effect going on here.  I heard alot of good tracks from 2am to 
7am and felt alot of bodies smooshing around me but man where were all 
the smiles?  Everyone was into serious grooving I suppose.  

I've designated a special "Wicked bin" to hold my grungy clothes after 
returning from Wicked's so as to not contaminate my standard dirty 
clothes bin.

Wicked can draw enough 21+ people to fill the Troc. The Troc makes more
money selling booze if everyone is 21+. So they probably give Wicked a
better deal if they have a 21+ party. Diverse City isn't established enough
to fill the Troc with 21+ people. Besides Dave,Diverse City's promoter
likes to do 18+ or all ages parties whenever possible.

There's a dance jam called "Sacred Movement/Sacred Sound" in San Francisco on 
the 2nd Saturday and 4th Sunday every month. Friends of mine who are into dance 
(but not raving, yet!) attended said it's very good.  Here's the rest of the 
description for those interested:
     
7:30 - 10:30 pm 
First United Lutheran Church (I don't think it's sponsored by the church) 
6555 Geary Blvd @30th Ave.
$10
     
Sacred Movement/Sacred Sound events are somewhat structured, with opening and 
closing circles, meditation, and live music.  Contact:  Sahar 707/585-6828

We made the drive down to Santa Cruz for a beautiful Sunset party.
There were 2-300 people there, just the right size IMO.  I didn't
stay to the end, but despite a lot of cars parked along Rte. 1, no
police presence at all.  The music was pretty good; I especially
enjoyed Travis' set, who came on first.  As usual, plenty of smiles
and friendliness.  Another great job by the Pacific crew and ocean.

     I know this is a late response but I did want to share two things. 
     I've been reading a dance book, _Maps_to_Ecstacy_ (Teachings of an 
     Urban Shaman) by Gabrielle Roth.  In it, she speaks about teaching 
     dance and movement with children, geriatrics, mentally ill, and the 
     physically handicapped.  In one section, she speaks of a 65-year old 
     man who is half-deaf and severely palsied after an industrial 
     explosion.  In the course of 12 years of movement and dance, he's been 
     able to "move beyond his ...spastic condition and open his movements 
     and speech." Evidentally he's still dancing in his 80's :) 
     
     The point of creating a safe space, where one can explore their 
     movement through different rhythms (flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical 
     & stillness) is extended in a rave environment hence it can be viewed 
     as a form of therapy.
     
     The second thing I wanted to put forth is that there is a dance troupe 
     and a dance jam (open to the public) in Berkeley for handicapped and 
     able-bodied people to move together.  The group is called Axis and 
     they've been performing for numerous years.  A wheel-chaired friend of 
     mine dances with them (she's in her 60's) and it definitely reawakens 
     her spirit as she is divorced and is rarely touched, held, and pushed 
     in a playful manner outside of dance.  Axis just had a performance on 
     PBS in late April...a couple of days prior to Cynthia's posting.
     
     So in summary, it's not just the physical aspects of dance that raves 
     connect us (per Larry Ching's question below).  After all, haven't we 
     heard euphemisms of our emotions and thoughts moving, dancing, racing, 
     or "doing" whatever (e.g., eyes dancing and thoughts swirling, temper 
     rising, etc.).  
     
     Warm bear-hug embraces (can you feel it?),
     Diane

abso-fucking-lutely!!  the other guy you occassionally see is probably mark 
evju, our long time raver & psychonaut buddy from santa rosa.  he used to 
be around in the scene alot more about a year ago and now only drives his 
van down occassionally.  he's got more energy and good vibes for ravin' 
than many people we've met throughout the scene.  yes, you can dance 
without legs...it's a spiritual thing, ya know?

Does anyone have a number for Wicked &/or Markie?  Their voicemail does
not accept messages, and I need to get in touch with them soon.

Did you happen to see the nesting swallows? They had nests along an alcove 
and their babies would pop their little heads out and look around- It was 
totally wild to watch them fly above the party and swarms of what looked 
like hundreds, flying in a totally random formation- They look like mini 
fractal jets!

We made the drive down to Santa Cruz for a beautiful Sunset party.
There were 2-300 people there, just the right size IMO.  I didn't
stay to the end, but despite a lot of cars parked along Rte. 1, no
police presence at all.  The music was pretty good; I especially
enjoyed Travis' set, who came on first.  As usual, plenty of smiles
and friendliness.  Another great job by the Pacific crew and ocean.

of it (see other post) their party is going to peter out into nothing!

Yeeeaaaah!!!, a great way to end the weekend.  After being in the cramped 
space of the dv8 basement, it sure did feel good to get into the 
outdoors.  Congradulations to the pacific crew for finding another 
good outdoor space and providing a fantastic party.  Once again the the 
magic of the sunset party had the friendly vibe that made it very easy 
for me to approach many people as I danced around the beach making 
contact with all those dancing.  I could feel the warm vibe from all 
those sitting, enjoying the enviroment and socializing.
After arriving and saying hello to some friends, I was compelled to start 
dancing right away as I was swept away from the beautiful energy of this 
party.  I got to meet a few more sfravers, which was great! 
Several people approached me asking me about full moon party shirt which made 
for some good shared stories of raves in other parts of the world.  
Thank you all for being and sharing the energy.

greetings internetters... it has been a while since my official last 
post, but that has been because my roomate, tristan, has been 
using/monopolizing/(abusing?) my account for quite a while now. let me make 
clear that although he uses my account, his opinions aren't necessarily 
mine, and i hope that everyone out there is not too closely associating 
anythig too rude or personally offensive said by him in the past with 
my name. i hope he will 
continue to sign all his posts in the future as to keep this distinction 
clear. 
secondly, i am wondering how the last sunset was, and will there will be 
another this weekend? if so, where? and if it is not directly accessible 
by bart or other public transit, i would gladly contribute gas/transpo 
money for a ride there, if anyone is going. 

bye for now, 

kevin

     There's a nice little party for your wednesday evenings, called Blinc.
 I went by last Wednesday and heard some excellent electronica from Jonah,
Jason Velocette (playing live and playing some wonderfully bizarre records),
and Andrew Smith from XLR8R (solid beats, both tranced and housed).  The 111
Minna St Gallery where they held it has got a great feel to it -- really high
ceilings, potted trees all over, art on the walls & cool magazines on the
counters.  This week, May 10, it's going to be Terbo Ted playing live, myself
(minor minor), and Magnetix (Craig, ex-XKP).  ...should be good...
      seeya,

just speaking for myself... I love the Wicked DJ's but I voted with my feet and
didn't go to DV8. Won't go next month either. Hmmmm, I must be becoming a raver snob :)
If they can't get a decent venue in the future.. well, I'll just stay
away. There's no damned reason to have to wait 90 minutes in line to go into a shitty
club like DV8 basement. C'mon guys, if we have to go to that club/dump
at least you could play the main floor. Why?  'cos we're special! That's why! :)

What ever happened to the old sweaty King St Garage that I used to love to complain about :)
And I was sooooooo looking forward to Wicked at the Troc...Shit what about the good ol days at 177 Townsend?

Dear All;

	I didn't know her name, but she was one of US. I walked out of 
Kindness, in Portland, to be greeted by one of my trip compainions. He 
said that some girl under the bridge had shot herself. The emergency 
crews were all ready on the scene. I started walking towards them, it 
was less than a block away, and didn't know what to expect.

	There she was, lying in a pool of her own blood, with a hole in 
her head. A .22 caliber Ruger Automatic, about a foot from her almost 
lifeless hand. She was still barley a live, with a lites on but no ones 
home confused look on her face, like she was looking into the unknown, 
and very scared. 

	I've held the very same type of weapon in my hand, fired 
it on a pistol range at a paper target. The bullet is less than a quarter 
inch in diameter. How something so small and insignifcant can rob a human 
being of life, which goes behond everything we know and understand. Guns, 
they say, may keep us free, but they also keep us forever locked in a 
circle of never ending violence.

	I'm left with this image forever burned in my mind, and an
overwhelming sense of saddness, and lack of understanding. I been through
some really horrorific times, and have been to that edge on more than
ocasion, but was always to scared. I understand feeling, so bad, for so
long, that you just can't see the lite of day, and that death would be
preferable. But the legacy of the hurt & pain you leave behind, I feel 
just adds to all the suffering thats already out there. In essese you 
become just like the people who hurt you. 

	The choice of life, no matter what, for me a person who has lived
through it, has lead to a much greater sense of satisfaction. I wish she 
would have talked with someone, she could have found someone who could 
have given her a new perspective. I remember a lot of the sayings about 
suicide, a permant soultion to a temporary problem, it will be a new day 
tommoroe, and you will feel differently, and you do.

	Thats it, except for the song that keeps playing in my head by 
Depeche Mode, called Fly on the Windscreen, the lyrics follow:
	
	Flys on the Windscreen:

	Death is everywhere
	There are flys on the windscreen; for a start
	Reminding us that, we could be torn apart, tonight

	Death is everywhere
	There are lambs for the slaughter, waiting to die
	And I can sense the hours slipping by, tonight

	Come here, kiss me, now
	Come here, kiss me, now	

	Death is everywhere
	The more I look, the more I see, the more I feel a sense on 
	urgency, tonight

	Come here, touch me, kiss me, touch me, now, touch me, touch me
	Come here, touch me, kiss me, touch me, now, touch me, touch me

	There are flys on the windscreen
	There are lambs for the slaughter
	There are flys on the windscreen

	Come here, touch me, kiss me, touch me, now, touch me, touch me
	Come here, touch me, kiss me, touch me, now, touch me, touch me, touch 
	me, touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me,
	touch me

	Come here, touch me, kiss me, touch me, now, touch me, touch me 
	Come here, touch me, kiss me, touch me, now, touch me, touch me...	

	I hope she found peace, and is in a better place, and would just 
like to ask, that we offer her a moment of private silence, each after 
you read this, thanks.

	    Peace, Love & Saddness From Across Cyberspace

Count my vote for bringing Wicked back to street level venues!
After sweating off 10 lbs in the basement at 1015 Folsom at a 
Wicked I promised myself that I would never go to another

Geoff,
I was told by some one today that you are the man as far as getting a Web 
sight is concerned.  Please post me details as soon as possible.  Am 
afraid that I do not have an individual e-mail address for you.  In 
particular, please tell me deals for Web sights for students; also need 
to know about cost.
Your help in this manner would be greatly aprecialted.
Yours Sincerely,
Tristan.

I too was really looking forward to Wicked but when I got there and saw 70
people in a line that wasn't moving and realized that they only had part
of the club I was very disapointed.

It seems like they get great venues in the other cities (Portland, Denver, 
St. Louis,...) so why such a crummy setup in the home town.

Where as I don't like the DV8 basement so much, I love the 1015 basement.

It was at a hot-house sweatbox basement wicked at 1015 about 3 years
ago that I saw the Light ;-) 

How many folks remeber those friday night basement Wickeds that

I remember those parties too well. With all those sweaty people in such a 
small area, I sometimes wonder about the health risks. God forbid that sweaty 
person who rubs against you has turberculosis. Imagine if there was a fire or 
someone set of a stink bomb.

Let's try not to keep the scene too underground (pun intended)

I heard about what happened through Andrew (soundgod) and I was so very 
sad (for lack of a better word) for her.  Although I have never known 
anyone who has taken their own life, I still have *very* strong feelings 
toward the subject, especially now that my life feels so complete and 
full.  

When a person commits suicide, it makes me feel incredibly sad, because 
the person must have just felt indescribable amounts of pain and 
anguish.  To know that *anybody* would feel that makes me feel so sad.  
But even more, helpless...because that person couldn't reach out.  No one 
would understand, they would think. I would have been there for a 
stranger if he/she needed to talk.  It is so frustrating because 
*every* human life is valuable - but the person in question feels 
worthless.  I just want to give that person the biggest hug and say 
that they *do* matter - *PLEASE* believe that!!!

The last time I delt with the issue of suicide was with Kurt Cobain.  I 
wasn't a fan of Nirvana or anything, but his death really shook me up.  
Here was a person whose entire life was ridden with pain and sorrow.  I 
felt so angry, too.  Anybody who commits suicide is only thinking of 
themselves.  Kurt never gave one thought to his daughter or the misery 
he was causing his wife.  We live for more than just ourselves.  
EVERYONE PLEASE REMEMBER THAT!!!  

Then with all the media coverage of Cobain's death came all the 
articles of how the people of our generation (another pathetic 
"generation x article, I know) are on the verge of killing ourselves 
because so many of us feel such pain and anguish in our lives.  I was 
surprised when I read things like this.  Was it really this bad for 
young people out there?  For the longest time, I had surrendered myself 
to the culture of rave. I was surrounded by love and positvity and so 
this was kind of a shock to me.  I guess I became naive and thought 
everyone was really happy because I was as were people who were around 
me.  I dunno....has being in the rave culture caused me tunnel vision 
in a certain aspect?  I don't think it is necessarily a *bad* thing.  
We have so much evil and  sadness in the world as it is that raving is 
my little haven - another world apart from the cold reality.  I 
incorporate PLUR as much as I can in my day to day life, so that maybe 
I will connect with someone who feels like "an outsider."  Those are 
usually the ones in trouble.  A raver committing suicide seems 
paradoxical.  It really doesn't make sense.  Too many of us care too 
much to let someone in "our" community take their own life.  

There's what I have to say, I'm sorry it's so long.

Love to *everyone*
<<<big hug>>>>

	Raving is ofcourse ,as we all know, excellent for the spirit and 
I always like to here about the positivity of the rave culture.

  The  rave experience and culture can be very powerful as we 
also all know.  The love, warmth, and connectedness we 
feel at raves, many of us attempt to bring into the world and that is 
fantastic.

However, I also think that raves can be very confusing to people also.
The accelarated experience and intensity of positivity found at these 
parties is tough (but not impossible I might add)for many people to find in 
day to day life and that might lead to a certain state of depression.

I guess all I wanted to add is that we should "try" ,as that is all we 
can do,  to see signals and become increasingly aware of pain in other 
ravers and other people to and help them through it.  Unfortunatly I 
think sometimes raving can do a good job of camoflouging pain in many 
individuals and those are the peolpe that I feel need our help the most.

	I obviously don't know the entire situation surrounding the 
incident and I hope that what I have said offends no one, it is simply an 
observation that I feel is unfortunalty a reality in such an influential 
culture.

Hugs to all,

Dan

I do! But I'm not sure if that was "the light" or just the glow emitted
that happens when everybody's Luv Phaser is going off. Those were GREAT
parties with SIGNIFICANT vibe and AMAZING dancing all night long. 
Grungy space-disco meets Native American sweat lodge. And some of them
weren't even that crowded -- there was always room to dance.

But DV8 -- i really don't like that place. It's not like there's a
tangible describable, characterizable "thing" that I don't like about
DV8... other than perhaps "clubby" and "cheezy" and that friendly body
cavity search they do when you go in. 

So When I heard that Wicky-Head was happening at DV8, I gave it an
immediate pass, and stayed up all night writing portable assembly...
err I mean C... code instead... (and you know it's gotta suck if you'd
rather geek out in C than rave...). I had already done the DV8 basement
wicky-head thing once and, though I had a good time, I thought the
crowdedness sucked -- you can't feel the "vibe" when yer getting jabbed
in the back and elbowed in the face ...

That Sunset was happening the next day was consolation -- unfortunately
I nixed that when i found out it required driving to Santa Cruz...
all's I can say is that I really appreciated the first Sunset because

Re: DV8 and those guys...

Call me nuts, but sometimes I wonder if there isn't a REASON why they do 
DV8. 

If they wanted something intimate, do you think they'd do DV8, even if 
they lost all other available spaces?

I belive there might be other motives involved:

	- DV8 brings in a big crowd (i.e. money). Gotta pay the rent somehow.
	  (FMR's sure don't do it)

	- Since DV8 is a more "conventional" crowd, it could be a method 
	  of "interdicting" those that are unaware of what these events 
	  are about and showing them what's up. If only a couple of people 
	  are affected and start to explore more "underground" events, then 
	  mission accomplished.	

Then again, I could just be slanting. These guys have affected me in ways I 
can't even begin to describe (perhaps a few can relate?).

Just some possibilities. later...

In fact the the scene is infectious, and I think part of it is because

                In a Dark Time  
                                by Theodore Roethke
     
     In a dark time, the eye begins to see,
     I meet my shadow in the deepening shade;
     I hear my echo in the echoing wood-
     A lord of nature weeping to a tree.
     I live between the heron and the wren,
     Beasts of the hill and serpents of the den.
     
     What's madness but nobility of soul
     At odds with circumstance?  The day's on fire!
     I know the purity of pure despair,
     My shadow pinned against a sweating wall.
     That place among the rocks-is it a cave,
     Or winding path?  The edge is what I have.
     
     A steady stream of correspondences!
     A night flowing with birds, a ragged moon,
     And in broad day the midnight come again!
     A man goes far to find out what he is-
     Death of the self in a long tearless night,
     All natural shapes blazing unnatural light.
     
     Dark, dark my light, and darker my desire.
     My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly,
     Keeps buzzing at the sill.  Which I is *I*?
     A fallen man, I climb out of my fear.
     The mind enters inteself, and God the mind,
     And one is One, free in the tearing wind.

 RE: The suicide reported by Brian Darkness
 
Some ideas ... none many of which are cheery ( you've been warned ) -
 
 Raves , like many crowd situations , can be incredibly lonely experiences 
especially because other people are having a fantastic time. If the 
depressed person is the type that has reservations about showing feelings , 
then others will not know that person is in trouble. People in the crowd 
may be too inwardly-focused to notice anyway. Or , the people in the crowd 
may only be keying on other ecstatic folks , in order to feed off of and 
contribute to the total vibe.
 
 Raves can be a place where nobody interferes with you , as long as you're
not hurting someone. The flip side of that is that individuals may be 
ignored.  Ignored sub-conciously , as I've posited above , or deliberately 
( the same type of ignoring that happens when one passes someone on the 
street who might be crazy or want money from you ).  There's also the 
respecting of other people's privacy , when it is the most important time 
to approach that person.
 
 Pure speculation: I don't know if the gal who commited suicide near the 
rave was even at the event, so I'm just improvising here: what if she had 
gone there to find community , and found isolation instead?  
 
 Personal input - I've been in a rave situation where I was in a very 
dangerous mental space , but was too stoic to bother my friends about it 
beyond a certain point. So , even though they were having a good time , 
I was wandering around with the Death Angel in my brainbox for company. 
I "toughed it out" obviously , or else I'd be channeling this to you from 
the Beyond via Ramtha!
 
 I've also been in a situation where folks have asked me if I was OK when I
was only resting my eyes , so I just want to say that raves aren't a total
alienation experience!  Raves are still a lot better that many other crowd
events , mood-wise. 
 
  That's it ....
                  Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS TO Brian Darkness - I realize on re-reading the above that I've not
offered any special words of comfort regarding the suicide of the poor 
gal. I can't come with anything that doesn't sound hollow or harsh or
cold , but I do hope that you find your way to some personal peace about 
the matter.

Brian is right. No one will know what to expect. I remmber her very
well. She was the first person in the prepaid line. I was helping with
door when she walked up early. I remember another staff memebr joking
with her and saying it was cool that she was the first one there. The
whole night seemed to go off really WEIRD. But it seemed very good at
first. Later on in the evening I was getting ready to pick up Graeme and
Jan Cooley from the hotel when I heard a noise and a bunch of people
scrambling around. One other staff member starting running up the hill.
I ran after him thinking someone got hit by a car. He stopped just
seconds away from her and screaming in pain. Then I saw her. The first
thing I saw was her nose-ring. I saw her hand shaking with a gun still
clutched by her fingers. I then looked at her head.

It took less than a second for me to vomit. I turned around. I then
remembered that there was an ambulance station across the street and a
hospital three blocks away. I started to run towards the station when I
saw a bum run from the station and say he already got them. Ryan
"Tigger" was the other staff member that was in front of me. He held her
tounge away from her esophagus so she could breath. The ambulance was
there in seconds. I pulled Ryan away with my eyes closed.

We walked back to the other side of Kindness to cry. My friend JEN from
Portland came and talked to us. I would not let her see.
Every time I close my eyes I see more and more detail about what
happened. She obviously had planned it because there was a 2 page note
by her leggs, and she did not have the gun inside because we were most
thourough on the serches. I would Like to thank Brian for coming up with
me. As well as May, Autum, Lolomi, Clinton, Tigger, Jason, Irene, Myram,
and Kevin. I would especially like to thank both Jen and May for there
support when I was not feeling good.

PLEASE READ THIS PART./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
tHE DOCTORS AT THE HOSPITAL SAID THAT HER CHANCES OF LIVING SEEM TO BE

I know of a few ravers that rave for the soul purpose of having light in
thier lives.... Many people for whatever reasons don't seem to carry their
positive energies into the ruckus of the 9 to 5 world.... Which can cause
negative feelings six out of seven days.  And I know that in the waking hours
at work and during the bussness days I can't give random hugs or smiles w/o
someone screaming sexual harrassment.  For thoses people who harbor thoese
feelings are the ones we need to reach out to.... At raves I try to make
friends (even if I cant remember all thier names...) and get ph# so maybe we
could do unravy things... establish freinship.  If only someone could of
reached out to her a rave or two ago she might have someone she could of
talked to to divert such a travesty....

But, I feel we must be strong for our sake. (Our not being ravers, but,
humans....)

OK stop here you got it on the first try...  hate to break it to you all but
when you get down to the nitty gritty the Wicked crew is all about MONEY.  I
don't care how many times they say Peace n Love (add English accent here) on
the voice mail, from my experience promoters in the Bay area are into
Money...  yea there are some who don't care about the money as much but I
have learned with experience that if you look at it closely the money is what
keeps em goin more than anything else...  hey in the case of Wicked someone
has to pay for the heroin.  Yea go ahead and flame me nut the truth hurts now
doesn't it?  No not all of the Wicked crew are on heroin but there are some
(some of the most important ones)  who are just a little bit more than fond
of the stuff.  I will admit that I am cynical about promoters.  I have known
too many of them who will tell you till they are blue in the face that they
do it for the people but when ya get down to making a choice concerning a
party MONEY is king.  If ya all have not noticed the scene here has gone WAY
down hill in the last year or so.  There are many reasons for this... one of
them is the promoters and money, and to go a little further I think our
little SF DJ click has also hurt the scene greatly.  I'm very optimistic
about that right now cause I have been seeing a lot more unknown DJs getting
gigs... Sorry but I don't buy into the DJ=potential rack star but an awful
lot of DJs have.  This IMHO is completely against what makes the House scene
great.  The House scene is not about rock stars... the one thing that keeps
the house world from becoming the rock scene is the anonymous nature of it...
 no pictures of the "band" on records no stage...  everybody is an important
part of the whole package.  Lately the trend has been that people are
becoming less anonymous... esp. DJs lookin for that big Sasha the "superstar"
name and image...  it is truly amazing the fame and money you can accumulate
by playing other peoples music.  So now that I have complained I owe an idea
to help solve the problem...  but because the promoters and DJs are deep down
into the money it will never happen but here I go,
I think a wonderful start would be to STOP PUTTING DJ NAMES ON FLYERS etc.
 The SOLE purpose of putting DJ names on flyers is to attract people...  to
do this a DJ needs to get his/her name and image out there just like any
other business.  Stopping this would stop the promotion of "celebrity" images
that become very valuable in selling your party... this also allows the DJ to
charge OUTRAGEOUS amounts of money...  most of which does not ever get back
to the person who actually wrote the music.  Because "name" DJs are so
expensive Promoters not wanting to lose any of their share also jack up the
prices (which they did before anyway and would probably still do even if DJs
were all free)  I know this will upset a lot of people but hey if you wanna
be a rock star learn to play guitar... yea it takes more work but if fame
were that easy there would be too many famous people-hence no real fame?(just
in case you are wondering I have played guitar for 12 years but now primarily
write house music and yes I am very confident with 2 turntables which I
consider to have been by FAR the easiest of the 3 skills to pick up)  While
I'm at it what ever became of that wonderful sound system that the Wicked
crew bought?  Normally I could care less but I remember going to more than
one party with flyers explaining that the party was 'x' amount of money
because we are going to buy this great system "for everyone to use"  peace,
love, rave etc. etc.  I don't see this system out too often...  I know they
bought it but who can use it?  Is it free to use?  Ohh it costs money to use?
Ohh so those were really donations for a source of income for the Wicked
crew?  Naw...  the wicked crew would never tell you something like that just
to make you feel good about spending money on their party...  they were
really thoughtful in collecting donations for a sound system that would
spread rave love to every one.  (yes they did put out flyers that led you to
believe stuff like this and yes I still have some)  Sorry this is so long but
I figure if Im gonna upset anyone I might as well get it all done in one
shot...
Basically I really love the scene and am sickened by the level of pollution
in it now...  we are the only ones who can stop it.  I would like it to get
back to where it was, a place where every social group could come and freak
out and dance to a "universal groove" type of music.  Remember the days when
you did not even know one DJ name?  Did it make those first parties you went
to suck?  Did you get disappointed when you missed Garth's set?  Did you even
care?  Images of people that can be sold are ruining the scene...  stop it,
don't let them force this junk on you, there are more than enough images for
you to buy on TV why can't we take break at parties?

it's sad that the girl chose such a way out. but to all you out there in 
'raveland' who think that rave is love n' piece better get your head 
outta your ass. this whole love and piece thing is all drug based/induced 
and my money is drugs had somtin' to do with her decision.
before the flames fly; i know. i;ve been there. i'm on hella medication 
just to 'feel' like i can function in the real world; just starting to 
come out of the the house. drugs fucked me and my friends up good; not to 
mention the 'rave scene'. 
used to be i'd go to a rave and after the e would get so deppressed that 
i could never gain that feeling of spirituallity and community again. few 
days later would feel better. however, two years ago i never got better. 
paranoia, anxiety, depression, the lot...

nothing is more sad than what the girl did.............
but it's more than naive to think that the 'rave scene' can cure the ills 
of the world. it creates just as many.............

MORE FUN FOR EVERYONE!!.  RAVE CULTURE MEANS THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE
KNOW IT . [part 3] 

(written-up notes from a speech given by Fraser Clark to 300 students at
Stanford University on May 2nd this year, at the invitation of Richard
Powers, Dance Historian.)

SO, Rave is not just a party.  Of course it depends what we mean by a party. 
The concept is long due to be redefined.  The usual party is actually a
leftover from the industrial age, in my view, where the weekend "party"
was a release for the worker ants after 5 days hard work in the factories. 
Since most of us don't actually live that way any more, we need to
re-define it.  And the new paradigm will be along the lines of WORK-PLAY &
PLAY-WORK. 

By "party" most people think of picking up a member of the opposite (or
same) sex, maybe getting off your face, dancing a little bit, chatting a
little bit, drinking a little or a lot. None of these items would really
happen at a real rave. 

FIRST:  Alcohol is not the main lubricant.  A whole generation is now
appearing where alcohol is NOT fashionable.  That alone would make Rave
Culture a historically positive development.  If you'd told me ten years
ago that alcohol would become unfashionable in my lifetime I'd have
accused you of doing too much acid.  But it has. 

SECOND:  Raving is not just a new dance step.  In fact there are no steps. 
And you rarely dance with a partner.  You just get out on the floor and do
what you feel or just follow whatever takes you over.  This is important. 
The fact that there are no steps to hide behind makes everyone very naked. 
I love watching people raving almost as much as I enjoy raving itself. 
Everyone is unique.  Every dancing person tells their story whether they
wish to or not.  HereUs a fat girl, thereUs a skinny black dude etc. 
Since you can only do what you are you are clearly exposed on the
dancefloor.  And the fact that everyone is in the same position adds this
feeling of everyone being naked together. 

THIRD The beat is faster and each record mixes into the next (concept of
mixing is very much attended to) each record should blend seamlessly into
the next to produce a nonstop wall of sound.  Or an ocean of waves
carrying us all forward towards a not-so-distant shore. 
 
FOURTH The DJ is present, able to pick up on the mood on the floor, lift
it when it's ready and bring it down again, only to lift it to a new peak. 
When I first noticed this power the DJ potentially had to lead the crowd
mood I called the DJ the TECNO SHAMAN - the phrase has stuck and you'll
see it a lot. 

Also you don't just have a little drinky and then have a little dance with
some girl you've just met.  Nothing like that.  People dance to rave music
for HOURS. It is shamanic, tribal african style dancing for hour after
hour until your mind is stilled, your conditioning removed.  They call it
a trance state but I prefer to see it as having your trance state
*removed* so that your eyes are opened and you can see the world as it
really is. 

										

Now most raves stop there, even today, stop at what I call the First Stage
of Rave.  And, as far as that goes, that's okay.  But it's very important
to take the next steps.  If you've helped open someone's mind to new
imput, then you should have good positive new imput available.  And this
is where the Ambient Chill Out Room or rooms comes in.  Here you might
have various kinds of literature available, massage, talks (even like this
one) and so on. I'll return to this when I speak of The Mythical Rave. 


THE HISTORY OF RAVE CULTURE.

You can get most of this from mags etc so I won't spend a lot of time.

The music itself began in Chicago - called "Acid House" Music - connected
to interering with a track, even pouring acid on it, "burning" it etc to
produce another effect etc.  I've spoken on stage with Derek Carter and
I've heard him (and others at other times) state categorically that it
had nothing to do with "acid".  But then, let's face it, if the papers
were all accusing you of such a thing, what would *you* say?! 

Then it was picked up in London and in Ibiza - which is interesting,
because Ibiza was also a famous hippy hangout in the '60s and '70s - I
spent several years myself there.  It's full of intimate little clubs,
with micro dancefloors, and, of course, lovely mediterranean outdoors
weather, beach and full moon parties.  Later massive clubs like Amnesia
and Pacha were built.  So London's CLUB "trendies" used to hang out there,
pcked up on the new music from Chicago, started mixing it in, along with
the new drug from America, ecstasy (which had been almost entirely used
there for couple therapy) and then brought it back to London. 

An so appeared the first "acid house" parties.  And E Warehouse parties. 
SHOOM, as I mentioned, is the most famous of the early ones.  Afficionados
might be interested to know that Jenny, Danny Rampling's wife, grew up in
Malta which is famous for its mafia and its clubs, so Jenny certainly knew
a thing or two about making a club "fashionable". 

>From the first time I saw and heard "aceeed" House parties, I knew that
this was the spiritual revival I had been predicting.  Most of the
trendies - who seemed to see only a happy new dance style and lots of hugs
- were of the loud opinion that it would all be over by Autumn, and have
been saying the same thing ever since, but I knew right from the first
moment that it would spread and spread and that's what it's done.  An
interesting side-effect is that each place that takes it up thinks they're
the best that's ever been, and I think this is very very important and
healthy.  Not centralised. 

A key element in the development of Rave Culture (as opposed to just
ravers going to raves) was when the Ravers crossed over with New Age
travellers and festivals.  This connected Rave back to its Hippy roots,
thus giving it the social impetus, rebellion and some spirituality. 
Obviously a whole book could be written on this subject. And, of course,
wherever this has happened, the "trendies" of the local scene, who got in
early because of their clubbing past, fight the development tooth and nail
because they have a position in the pecking order which is pretty much
doomed when Rave Culture begins to broaden into something more than just a
huggy trend. 

The UK government has passed many laws against Rave Culture.  Why?  It can
only be because they see the power of it. 

And now, lastly, I'd like to read aloud a piece I wrote last night called
The Mythical Rave.  It's a bit poetic, and a bit prosaic and
informational. 



The Mythical Rave should be out in the open air and should begin around
sunset.  This rarely happens but it's the ideal I'm now describing. 
People should start drifting in as the sun goes down - checking out the
venue, finding their spot (where they can leave their things) maybe a
tent, hanging their flag so others of their posse can find them, some food
and so on. 

By now the music has started, but it's slow and drifty and only
occasionally rhythmic at this stage.  People wander around, greeting and
meeting each other, settling in, checking out what other distractions are
available.  These could include massage, body/face painting, stalls on
social, political, ecological and personal/spiritual activities, brain
machines, food and smart drinks, video-modem interlinks with other clubs,
and so on and on.  Anything really that's inspiring, consciousness-raising
or positive - no negative stuff or imges should be shown during the whole
rave.  This is how we do it in Megatripolis and I'm very aware of the
arguments about Art showing the Dark and the Light.  I'm very clear indeed
that we get the Dark six days a week and, even if we get pure Light for a
whole night, the balance is still on the side of the Dark. 

Occasionally people will hit the dancefloor and loosen theselves up with
some dancing.  Dancing at this early stage helps to get the blood flowing
round your veins and generally loosens people up, helps them to mix, drop
their social barriers, and so on. 

Gradually over the night the music gets faster and more and more people
join in. By just after midnight the place is starting to get as packed as
it's going to be.  (This is different with indoor raves where most people
probably arrive after midnight.) At my first acid house party there were
20,000 kids going for it by 2am.  Massive energy as you can imagine. 
WeU'e now participating in a tribal gathering Love Dance to absolutely
nonstop shamanic rhythmic drum rolls and electronic bleeps that slightly
unhinge the mind (where am I? who am I?). 

Gradually the Group Mind becomes more dominant.  It becomes WHO ARE WE? 
I'm part of something.  I'm part of something that's actually bigger than
myself.  I'm one of the people, these are my people, this is US! 

In "Noise.  The Political Economy of Music" Jacques Attali says this: 
"Music is prophesy.  Its styles are ahead of the rest of society because it
explores, much faster than material reality can, the entire range of
possibilities.  It makes audible the new world that will gradually become
visible, that will impose itself and regulate the order of things."

By the middle of the night people are taking a break (some go all the way
through nonstop of course) wandering around, huggng old friends and new
friends, lots of hugging, not much direct sexuality because of this group
Mind entity that's beginning to be felt by everyone present.  Ego meltdown
into Group Mind and Consciousness. 

Sunrise approaches.  Crucial time - definitely the mythological heart of
the Rave.  Everyone back on the dancefloor now, dancing up a storm as the
music gets louder and faster and more cosmic, possibly with angelic choir
samplings and even classical music samplings to help arouse a religious
sense of awe. 
								
And so we DANCE THE SUN UP!  

Like the old pagan festivals, we're all in this together, this is our
planet, She is indescribably beautiful, gigantic, we are atoms of that
Living Goddess.  Personally I can't see a better way to help people learn
a love, respect and reverence for Nature than the classic open-air
all-night Rave.  Can you imagine what it felt like with 20,000 people
going for it and actually feeling together,and the power of a people
together ... and then dancing the sun up?!  It is awesome, it is
religious, and it is life-changing. 

The current Yoga Journal has an article called Sacred Raves which says:

"These all-night dance marathons look like hedonistic escape, but raves
may just be the defining spiritual expression of a new generation."

The Rev Matthew Fox of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco is quoted as
saying:  "These kids are showing us how to pray in a new way, which is
also an ancient way - with fewer books and more dancing".

This I will disagree with.  A few words/names to dispute this would be 
Friends and Family, Pacific, MESS, New Moon, Spaz?, and a group I'm 
involved with the Cloud Factory.  All of these groups so far have proven 
to me that they are *not* involved solely for the sake of money.  In fact 
several of the people of the above groups have full time jobs, are 
college students, and generally do not spend all their time 'promoting', 
although i dont know about promoters of things like Wicked, Exx Why Zzz, 
Basics/Gathering.  But the fact that someone has a full time activity and 
will still throw parties is a good sign to me that scene here has 
something to offer.

I think the reason that new djs are starting to emerge is the reason that 
hopefully some people are getting tired of seeing the same djs every 
weekend.  Although the rock star image could be left at home, lets not 
forget the shaman idea that has long been present at raves.  If a Dj is 
good he is good, regardless of whether he gets paid $200 or $1000 or 
plays for free.  If someone were going to pay you a $1000 to dj for two 
hours you'd probably consider it.  I wouldnt do it but in our world money 
is a pretty attractive thing you must admit.  

> I think a wonderful start would be to STOP PUTTING DJ NAMES ON FLYERS etc.
>  The SOLE purpose of putting DJ names on flyers is to attract people...  to
> do this a DJ needs to get his/her name and image out there just like any

I disagree here because of the reason mentioned above that the shamanic 
qualities of a dj must be considered.  Certain djs play certain styles, 
emote certain moods/vibes, I think its ok to want to see certain djs, 
obviously people like and dislike djs.  I think the best move would be to 
stop making fliers =) for all perties.  But my realistic solution here is 
to take the approach we have and not pay your djs.  This is not to say if 
we threw a $5 party and ended up making a lot of money we wouldnt give 
some money to the djs (i think supplementing djs for the purpose of 
buying records is perfectly legit).  Although this also goes along with 
our dedication to *never* letting any of the money we take in be used 
solely for one person's benenfit...the closest we come to this is buying 
breakfast for the cleanup crew/djs.  So basically its not really the djs 
that need to change or the promoting tactics but rahter the promoters 
(which you pointed out above).

This really upsets me actually.  I thought Wicked were going to go on 
tour of the nation with their sound system when they got it and spread 
the rave vibe/PLUR.  Which in my mind not going around throwing $20 
parties in other cities (Portland was $18).

My final point will be that as long as people pay more than ten dollars 
to go to a party no matter how good it is, people will always take 
*advantage* of you. ALWAYS.  I take pride in the fact that it has now 
been at least a year since I paid mkore than $10 to go to a rave.  This 
means if there arent smaller parties happening on a night dont sukpport 
the large ones.  When there are smaller parties, like free or cheap 
ones...give them your $20 they'll actually do something with it in a 
positive way.  Part of the whole solution comes down to the fact that a 
true rave is not a product, it is a spiritual experience, it is a 
ritualistic part of some of our lives, but it is not something you can 
buy.  Way too many people have lost sight of that and need to come back 
to the ground.  Many of my closest friends still go to $20 parties (yes 
you Matt =) but every time I ask them if it was worth it...sometimes they 
say yes and I then I say do you realize that if 'x' amount of people went 
then the promoters prolly made 'x' thousands of dollars?  Then maybe they 
feel kinda stupid but they still go again, my hope is that someday if 
they, and you, and everyone on this list and all the ravers in SF stop 
going to these parties that are put on by promoters, not organizers that 
this will truely be the best place to rave on the planet.  Think of 
twenty different renegades with two hundered people at each party think 
of the variety of parties you'd get, the variety of djs, the smaller the 
scene gets in size of partiesthe better off we;ll all be.

        Totally-
        especially Thomas...when WICKED came here (SLC) they had the rave
in a huge indoor tennis facility with four courts...so when thomas used
that tennis ball being volleyed around sound effect it was really quite
trippy (even more realistic with the assistance of the magic pez)...it was
really quite cool...
        i love those WICKED guys...
        my 3 cents worth
        f-amous

        p.s. go see CRUMB (as in the KEEP ON TRUCKIN' crumb)...it's fantabulous

Thanks, Larry :)  If I may offer some advice to other students on this 
list, do *not* listen to techno while trying to study.  When I try, I 
generally wind up bobbing my head and staring vacantly at my desk ;)

Money is not evil. Without money we couldn't buy records. Project "Open Hand" couldn't 
buy food, the ACLU wouldn't exist. 

Profit is not evil. Without profit most of our employers/clients wouldn't hire us so that 
we could have money to rave or even eat.

There's nothing inherently evil in Wicked being a for profit/for money group. And saying
"peace, love" etc. on the one hand and asking $15/20 is not necessarily a contradiction.

We all know by now that Wicked is a business. And it's a business that many of us like to buy
from. It's all a matter of perceived value: If we don't like the product, we don't buy it. 
If it's too expensive, we shop elsewhere.  At present some of us choose to go elsewhere with 
our "business" as the product (read: DV8) is not satisfactory. If that keeps up then other 
products will enter the market on a Wicked nite, and we'll "buy" from them. 

Personally I hope they get it together 'cos I luv the bastards :)

Well, I'd have enough integrity to say the truth, as did Derrick.  It 
wasn't until you limeys took the music back home with you that it was

A few years ago as raving was introduced to S.F. there was huge potential to 
make big money. But now that the general public considers it a trend of the 
past there is not as much money as people might guess. At this Point anybody 
who is involved with raving is doing it primarily because the love it. Being 
able to make a living doing something you love is a rare priviledge in this 
world. 

Personally I think that Rave needs to trade in some of these bloated ideals and 
trade them in for some PUNK style personal freedom. Hypocracy sucks.

Raves are a much healthier way  of celebration  than my Heroin habit was.
Did You see me surf those waves at Sunset? Heroin addicts don't do things 
like that- Ravers do. There was another raver SUicide attempt that shook me 
up last year, and yes, drugs were involved. If you think that the RAVE is all 
about kids on drugs then you have the same opinion as the general public.
Look deeper , don't use drugs as a scapegoat for more complicated issues. 
That would be another "Twinkie Defense". 

Now that I've defended Money and Drugs I'm ready to take on the big one-

This is true.  There are maybe a handful of DJs in the Bay Area who
can support themselves that way.   Every now and then there's a BIG
party like Cool World that rakes it in - but we've been over this issue
before with Martin who was hounded into revealing his finances on this
list.  This scene really isn't a place to make much money.  You really
have to rip people off consistantly to get rich, and no one seems to
be able to do that for long.  Right now, I'd say that the most blatant 
exploiters in the scene are the ones hawking "Herbal E".
 
> At this Point anybody

Some promoters might be in it for the ego trip.  I can't speak for 
others, but the couple of times I organized and promoted parties, there
was a inflationary effect on my ego.  Fortunately in ravedom, it takes
about one week for most people to forget everything you've done for them, 
so my ego was allowed to shrink back down to it's miniscule proportions.

Hmm.  I feel much more free raving than I ever did in the punk
scene.  Although anger, nihilism & anarchy seemed self-consistent
and liberating at the time - I soon found that package to be an 
emotional and conceptual dead end.  I'll take the inherent hypocrisy of 
PLUR over Punk any day.

we regret to have to announce that the Parallel University's
Cyberlab7Safari Into VR Now & Zen this Friday at Transmissions/Paradise
Lounge has had to be postponed due to licencing delays/problems.  

since quite a number of sfravers had announced their intention of coming
and since some of them will miss this anouncement we ask that if you know
anyone intending to come to let them know of the postponement. we
apologise for any hassle caused - nobody was to blame for this one!  we
shall announce a new date just as soon as we can. 

thankyou, and sorry.

	dude, I can't study at *all* without techno.  i need hoppity

	I'm new to the scene, so I really don't know where to start.

Yeah.  But the concept of "people being free to be themselves" *is* an 
ideal.  It is a preconception to think that there can even be a stable 
society in which we can be so completely free.  This is tied into the 
inherent hypocricy of PLUR: Will you ever be able to respect and my desire 
to rape you?

But surely not on *all* of its heads.

And the reafirmation of the PLUR concept which helps one to carry that

I have many times felt quite isolated at raves.  It usually only happens for a
little while and I can often make some connections while dancing but these seem to be temporary things. At times though this isolation can become quit
strong, but you don't want to bring down your friends or strangers who are 
having such a good time and take a chance at killing their vibe. (Which might 
make you feel even worse.)  So I don't know what to do when this happens.

Obviously, I've never been as far down the dark path as this woman went but
I've been at the entrance a number of times and always feel very isolated and
alone.  Many times a big hug at the right time would have been tremendous but
as to an answer. ???

paraphrasing a bored surfer in our midst,

this has largely happened 
the long anticipated downfall of a rave party line
is a frustration and disappointment to peaking zealots

is this perceived as a money-society-commercial-overground trend?
a less palatable atmosphere for your boogie desires? 
perhaps for the needy, a spiritual vacuum?

I don't know if what you feel is more complicated than this, but if you 
feel isolated, then surround yourself with your friends.  Hug them, give 
them that smile - give hugs and smiles to strangers.  It will come back 
to you and then some.  I was taught to *give* what you feel is missing 
within you and it will be returned.  If you want love, give love.  See 
what I mean?

I will prefer occasional violence to enforced peace. The best peace will occur 
from personal choice: an internal peace achieved by many, soon would be 
nice. What works for me might not work for you. I like dancing , loud 
electronic music and psychedelic drugs. PLUR is a side effect.

I *fully* agree.  although some of my absolute best moments in life have 
been at raves, I must admit that raves can often make a bad situation 
worse. I've had 2 or three experiences at raves (2 of which were at 
richmond civic hell) during which I was absolutely miserable and the rave 
just made it worse.  I just kept thinking, is everyone happy here except 
for me??  everyone has plenty of love/friends/fun/etc and I'm just all by 
myself wandering the halls.It sucks.  especially if you happen to be on 
fry at the time, it makes your confusion and depression even worse!  
also, being depressed and not being able to talk to your friends about it 
(cuz you don't wanna bring them down  from the party or the E) can be 
frustrating.

enforced PLUR gives me the creeps
the PLUR police - always on time and snappy, ready to serve,
prepared to give all and nothing for that moment of squeaky clean
brain detergent that'll wash all your grey away
relinquish your mind, your soul 
to the sunshine terrorists
give in.  hell, read a book about it
there really must be something to this shit ...
do more people find inner peace at supermarkets or at raves?
if there were 5000 people who thought the produce section was truly a
mind blowing cosmic fucking place to be would Safeway not have
the same cultish draw and underground mystique?

It means "Phoney Love, Utopian Ruse" :-)

I dunno about you, but I've found that the people that talk about this
kind of stuff too much will be the first in line to rob, steal, cheat,
and disrespect you. It's clear that Shakespeare knew a lot about human
nature when he wrote "She Doth protest too much"... 

Lately, I've been trying to decode everybody's "doublespeak"... Like
when a new boss comes out and says "I'm one of the least top-down
hierarchical people I know" all my alarm bells ring because he's really
trying to tell me he's a fucking dictator, even if he's rationally
thinking and verbalizing how he'd really like to be seen.

Maybe it's just me, but when I hear people talk about PLUR too much,
you can bet they're just trying to pull the wool over yer eyes. This
pretty much applies to anybody that claims that any one thing, whether
it's PLUR, God, E, or whatever is *the answer* to all that ills us.
Hypocricy has been the bread and butter of human thinking for the last
few thousand years -- so you might as well butter both sides... because
when push comes to shove all that verbalized milquetoast is gonna land
butter-side-down.

	"Well here are a few simple adminitions for young and old...
	Beware of whores who say they don't want money. The hell they
	don't -- what they mean is they want more money... much more!
	If you're doing business with a religious son of a bitch -- get
	it in writing -- his word isn't worth shit, not with the good
	lord telling him how to fuck you up..."
			-- William S. Burroughs, 
			   "Words of Advice for Young People"
			   on Material's "Hallucination Engine" CD.

Most of us know the beautiful feeling of E.  It is amazing.  So absolutely amazing that I think its the closest   thing to magic that we have ever created.  So happy, so joyful, and so clear.  Crystal clear.  But what about the other side?  There is one.  It is the complete opposit feeling and it can come from the same pill.                                                        



Last May I went to Vision with a very close friend of mine.  We both took the same kind of E at the same exact    time.  When it kicked in we just started grooving.  It was incredible.  But within 5 minutes Robin lost it.  She  just stopped dancing and grabbed me.  "I feel so terribly sad," she said to me and I felt it! I had to do everything within my power not to lose myself to the terrible sadness that overwhelmed her.  She had to sit down so I found a spot along the crowded wall for her to rest.  It was not good.  Even though I felt so full of joy she was in a nightmare.  She wouldn't let go.  She fought herself for 4 hours, drenched with emptiness and guilt.  She told me that she knew exactly how Kurt Cobain must have felt.  I could see this in her eyes but I didnt know what to do.  I stayed with her the whole time until the E finaly wore off.  She said the emptiness hurt so bad that she       wouldnt even wish it on her worst enemy (IMNSHO Robins only enemy is Christiantys guilt treatment).  

I am not bashing on E.  It is a beautiful thing.  I am just saying that it can lead someone to suicide.  I have   Know idea what the situation is with that poor girl in Oregon and dont think there is a connection but I do accept that it is possible.  We must be careful as a group.  If we see someone hurting we must try to help them. I am   learning that feel is stronger than site.  Energy is real.  Vibe is real.  I felt Robins sadness up and down my   body and can only say that I would never want to be overwhelmed by that.  I hope true peace realy does come in `
death because even Adolf Hitler would be dancing to the eternal groove.

There may be some truth to your statement but the person I've heard using PLUR the most would be Amy S. and I`d have to say there is more sincerity and love coming throug her messages than most people I`ve met in person.

Hey all,

Now lets move to something positive!  smarties.  Particulary Amy and Kim, two first time ravers, first time on E. Need I realy say more?  Well of course.  Amy YOU ARE AWSOME!!!!!  Amy is the product of a mantic-depressant 
mother and a negative-creep boyfriend.  She has always been so negative and I never realized her inner strength.  All I can say is if someone is TRULY searching than they WILL find.  Yes, Yes, Yes.  If you havent experinced the enery you can gain from introducing someone to HOUSE than you need to give it a try. Amy and Kim have made me     stronger.  I felt their enery enter me and become a part of me.  They are now apart of my family and it makes me  so happy.  This is why I love house music, raves, dj's, ravers, E, and the Energy that sourrounds us all.  It is  real and I love it so much. Well got to go I think the computer lab is being attacked by teachers and students.            
Love Chris

A while back there was a thread about X fatalities and I chimed in with
a big anti-X rant that a lot of people discounted, dismissed and
dissed. I even got some mail claiming that I've been brainwashed by the
media and drug-criminalization-happy right wingers (get a clue
X-heads!). Really, all I was saying is "don't believe the hype"...

Meanwhile, I'm just adding another tally to my observation from that
previous post.

Hmmm, enforced PLUR.  Don't belive I've been beat about the head and shoulders
with enough kindess and love to believe that the PLUR stormtroopers are in
full force yet.

Not that being skeptical isn't a good thing.  
It's a very necessary tool that should be used 
when trying to figure out the world of human interactions.
But care should be taken not to be blinded by skepticisem 
anymore than by cults, bosses, corporations, or the next
"new age of love".  Remember, think for yourself, but try
to use more than one track.

i DON'T think rave is all about kids and drugs. my point was that all the 
'peace and lovism' that people expound is a by product of the drug use. 
sure there is a heavy vibe one can pick up going sober (i get it all the 
time), but it's pure crap that all these people think they're going to 
'save the world', cause when your sorted anything goes. how 'bout when 
your sober; the real world hits you, and most people don't seem to take 
the 'revelations' they made the nite before to heart.
dis me all you want, but this needs to be said: try going out to raves 
for a month WITHOUT any sort of drugs. now tell me about 'peace and 
lovism'. if it works for you fine; but chances are it ain;t gonna happen.
now i'm not jadded about the rave scene at all. i've met all sorts of 
great people(you included), was able to produce my own music and records, 
worked for toontown back in the day.
i just think that alot of the statements people make are pure hyperbole. 
and that does nothing but make a mockery of the rave scene itself.

this is but one way to look at the universe, a rather miserable and
paranoid one at that. Can you ever be sure that voice in your head (usually
called higher thought) , isn't also fucking you over? And how would you
know if the wool had been pulled over your own eyes?  The question you are
posing realy is - to trust or not to trust - the problem though with not
trusting is that while you might never  lose anything, you don't get to win
anything either. Its the play it safe, and do'nt jump into the unknown (the
place where you might just, maybe, might, get fucked over) called the big
bad world. Luckily not all humans believe this, so we got to rediscover the
new world, landed on the moon and climbed Mnt Everest in spite of the
possibility of the Yeti, Falling off the edge of the World, and Evil SPace
Aliens from the dark side of the moon beating us at cosmic poker. Of course
if you ever got into a game of poker, you might like to watch your
opponents body language. To have a poker face is but one sign and yet still
no match for that thing called luck.

    okay. I've done that. People have come up to me countless of times 
and asked what I was on and DIDN'T believe me when i said nothing. I've 
done it and can still tell you and peace and love and all that...but i do 
think it has more to do with directing your OWN energy than feeding off 
other people's. The majority of the parties I've been to IN THE LAST 
YEAR, I have been sober and still feel the same way as I did when I first 
started going out. I don't think I have any special abilities in 
achieving this high(sometimes better than with drugs)without drugs. I 
just think most people forget that drugs-E and a couple others- can SHOW 
you love, but if you want to BE love...you gotta do that yourself.

Right on Tracy,
I think we find peace and love mostly within ourselves, and it can be 
enhanced by sharing it with others.  Raves offer a great enviroment for 
sharing these feelings IMHO.

depends what you're definition of "free" and "freedom" is... if it's 
being able to do what you want so long as you don't harm others, then 
obviously rape has nothing to do with freedom.

an aside:  i don't really use the term PLUR myself... i feel like the 
words "peace, love, unity and respect" are so overused and so often 
lacking meaning that they just don't feel heartfelt to me... maybe 
there's too many '60s connotations to me as well, of leechy sexist men 
saying oh yeah, peace and love, baby... maybe peace is just a little too 
vague, too - is it the absence of conflict?  sometimes we need to deal 
with conflict... i like the respect part, tho'....

with love and @,

no, money isn't "evil" in and of itself - it's a resource... capitalism 
is the problem....

and no, Wicked isn't "evil" for being for-profit and charging $15/$20 and 
talking about peace and love, but they ARE excluding people based on 
class (so much for respect for everyone)...

hmmm....maybe THAT's why i don't like the PLUR concept...no mention of 
sharing wealth, resources... i mean, it could be interpreted broadly, but 
not necessarily...

The full moon parties are held once a month (like the for pay parties)
and are free and open to any class :)

Also I've never heard any of the Wicked boys say that they subscribe
to the PLUR concept.

This is very true...  I did forget to mention that there are many very good
things going on.  The people who put these things on are wonderfull...
 athese people should be supported!  And yes I have come out and enjoyed
these events and will do so more often in the future : )

This is also very true.  The point I am making is that it is bad for the

contradiction.

I do not feel comfortable with people using this to sell me something...  I
don't really know that they really mean that, to me there is something empty
about those words printed on a flyer designed to get you to buy a piece of
their party.  

See ya all; )

hmmm.... i really feel uncomfortable with the implication here that 
people (women?) "scream" sexual harassment at the drop of a hat.  the 
majority of the time, this is simply not true, and the constant charges 
of people (women?) being too "sensitive" just adds fuel to the 
patriarchal fire, considering how much sexual harassment there really is.

that said, i really DON'T appreciate "random hugs" at parties at all.  i 
really consider this a violation unless i am friends with the 
person and/or the person ASKS first... touching is intimate, and i don't 
necessarily want to, or feel obligated to, be intimate with every single 
person who comes up to me at a party...

THAT said, it IS weird to go back to the "straight world" and want to hug 
people you're close to (co-workers, etc.), but it's just too weird and 
awkward sometimes... i just remind myself, oh yeah, most people don't do 
this...

Well first of all, I want all the clued in people out there to name
the clubs that you are allowed to throw legal all night dance parties in.
I'll give you a hint, there are only 5.


> 
> OK stop here you got it on the first try...  hate to break it to you all but

Well as far as the DJs are concerned, they don't have any other jobs but DJing.
Kinda hard to eat and support a family without getting paid in some form.

There are only three promoters left in the city that throw consistant
legal all night parties, none of them to my knowledge are driving fancy
cars or even owning houses, one promoter owns some property but he no longer
throws parties in the City.

Well I don't know if I'm an important one :) but I don't take heroin,
there are a couple of people who are no longer with the management or 
financial arm of the organization that you might be alluding to but as far
as I know I don't think heroin is any big issue here.  I know at least
on of the DJs has been completely drug free for over 2 1/2 years.

I think the reason that the scene has gone down is that people stopped caring.
Some of the long timers don't have trust funds and have to make a living
"off of the scene" when you have to do something for your survival it always
tarnishes it. But when you look around 90% of the promoters who were around
3 years ago are just not around anymore mostly because there IS NO MONEY TO BE
MADE.  There are only three promoter groups or posse's that are still operating
within the confines of San Francisco on any type of regular basis.



	Stompy - Preston
	FTT/Organic - Kevin & Jerry
	Wicked - Jeno, Markie, Garth, Thomas


Basics/Vision/Gathering doesn't count because martin rarely throws 
parties in the City any more.  The above three throw parties because they
believe in what they are doing.  None of them are rich.

The sound system is alive and well, it is used for there parties and part of
it is used for the full moon.  It is rented out from time to time as well.
The bottom line is that the wicked crew support themselves by throwing
parties, that is what they do.  They throw the full moons to give people who
don't go to the parties for lack of funds or because of age limitations to
have a chance to hear them play.  For good or for ill some people in the scene
use drugs, some I approve of some I don't.  I have seen e-dealers who carry 
9mm and junkies who are filled with love.  It is unfortunate that some people
have been ensnared in addictive behavior, even more unfortunate that some
people judge them and think it means something about their dedication to
peace and love.  Several years ago, I endulged in a very addictive substance,
but all the while I was doing this I was still the same loving person but
I was acting out a compulsion.  I managed to get away from it through a
combination of acquiring self-respect and through several loving friends.

Perhapse that is the answer here.

My second trip to Raley's was blessed by a conversation struck up with a
motherly woman over brussels sprouts, leading into purple asparagus and
the nature of such a peculiar looking vegetable.

Realizing that I was new to the area, she recommended a local produce stand
a few blocks away and went into great detail of it's location.  

Somewhere in between her words I began to realize that yes, there's a rave
going on at Raley's... in the heart of Fremont... with Muzak on the
turntables and visuals by Flourescent and actually a decent price on
bottled water to boot... 

I was brought down from my trip when her daughter approached and asked, 
"Mommy, do you know that man?".

  :)

I like Fremont.

Well I stayed home sick today. I had a 101 temp. and was sweating
bullets when I woke. It has I lot to do with this weekend in portland.
I'm glad to be back in sacramento. In my bed. With most of my sanity. I
woke a few times because of sweating and nightmares.

Mentally I'm beat.
I'm watching the news here though around 10:45 and this story catches my
eye. The TRACY women who's two children were kidknapped by their father
3 months ago was reunited with them tonight. I smiled during this whole
clip bacause I try to think of how angry she was when they were gone,
but now she is the happiest woman on earth. I smiled for her joy, and
for the love she had. I also like the way the local media covered the
story. They didn't glamorize that it was on their station, they just
said the story like it was. I needed to see that story. I need more like
them.

LOVE YOURSELF AND OTHERS WILL LOVE YOU,
RESPECT YOURSELF AND YOU WILL LEARN TO RESPECT OTHERS!

   Wow...  What is going on here guys???  When I first subscribed to this 
list a year ago, most of the chit-chat was about parties and music.  A 
few flames here and there, but good reading none the less.  Now, dont get 
me wrong, change is a healthy thing... But most messages these days 
consit of endless babble on economiX, politiX and drug addiX...  

   Of course, these controversial topics are interesting and some of the 
debates have been quite constructive.  But lately, things seem to be 
getting very exclusive and... quite honestly, boring.

   There have been MANY different opinions expressed on MANY different 
topics by VERY few people.  And with the exception of a handfull of well 
thought out messages, a lot of it is non-sense.  This group seems to be 
becoming inefficient.  Conclusions are no longer being reached, actions 
are being taken by only a few people, and most people probably just 
delete 90% of the messages these days.  Communication with the group as 
a whole is breaking down.

   And yes, we are dealing with a very large group.  I would suppose if 
we all were to attend a large meeting on rave ethics, nothing would be 
accomplished... Because we would all have an equal voice.  So all I can 
really say is to remember who your audience is.  If your discussion has 
become a 3 person debate, take it to private E-mail.  If you want the 
whole list to hear your views, make them interesting and write them 
well.  I would hate to see this list become a big pile of junk mail. If 
each message was individualy mailed to each subscriber via snail mail, 
just think how much of it would be thrown out??  If we want to save the 
scene and if we think we can use E-mail as a tool to help us, then let's 
start using it better... :)

   Just my thoughts...

 -Ernie

I'm no expert but it seems that Morgan got something that had a lot of MDA
in it, is this true or does the body convert MDMA into MDA, any biochemist
out there?

Thank you Peter for posting the death certificate, It is always better to
know the facts.  I never met Morgan personally but I do feel a loss when
things like this happen.

There is a clear and present danger when you purchase drugs on the street.
I've always been worried when I see folks pop pills that they get from any
random source with any random name.


Me: What's that?
Her: It's this new drug called Illusion!
Me: But What is it?
Her(puzzled): It's Illusion.
Me: But what's it made of, what are it's properties?
Her: Gee, I don't know.

Drugs are serious business, please know your sources.

Well I went to Groove Room last night.

Rich Cooley was spinning at the time of arrival, and not a bad set I might
add. =)

Waves is ok for relaxing purposes, and talking with friends, and meeting
new friends.  There is no smoking in the venue it self except for right out
side the door.  So the air is definitely breathable in there. =)
And the venue is 18 and up =) =) =) for all you wonderful young people.
There is free ice water at the counter which is always nice.

I believe it was John Howard who came up next with a very good set indeed.
He was playing a lot of good beats, but my body was just energized for head
bouncing.  I left around 1:30, bound for sleep.  There were enough people
to fill the place comfortably, people dancing, playing pool, and of course
a BASS ale is always nice.  So if you people are close to Waves in Los
Gatos, and you just want to have a beer and listen to some good music check
it out.

Goodday,

   I too have gone to a few  sober (only been to about 10 raves altogether) 
and had a great time.  I've gotten a very high feeling while being there. (That
trance dance state is not dependent on drugs but on the rhythms and the drum
beats.)  The Love energy and vibe is also there to be felt by the sober ones, 
it's just that alot of our natural defenses block this and drugs sometimes
help overcome them. Some aspects are even better than when flying.

I think when it comes down to it you can't always blame the promoters. Sure
there are greedy ones, but they generally don't last too long and get a
nasty reputation and have move to other cities after awhile. (Or maybe that
was just LA). I used to judge promoters pretty severely based upon my
perception of motivations. Often it seemed like the primary factor was to
throw a good party for its own sake - not what I'd ideally hope for, but
not bad.

Look at it this way, though - we all have the freedom to choose how much
we're going to pay for a party. Nobody's going to force you to drop $15-20
on a Wicked, FTT, or Vision. Personally, as a promoter, I wouldn't want to
try and make a living off of the scene and have to adjust production size
and entrance fee so I could pay my rent, but I don't disrespect those who
do. I was just talking to Martin (Basics etc.) the other day and he's not
living large. He could probably make more money as a bricklayer (his
professional trade)!

I see the bigger parties becoming more and more estranged from the true
underground spirit - tours? C'mon. Wicked in Portland was great, but the
merchandising gave it the feel of some sort of weird arena rock/rave
hybrid. Not necessarily a bad thing exposure wise, but evidence of
evolution in the scene and demostration of the need for new thinking on how
it's integrated.

Maybe, but I think not. The early days had parties with _serious_ vibe
some of this maybe due to drugs, but when I started raving I went 6 months 
without taking any drugs.  I've had some amazing experiences taking drugs
and some truely amazing experiences completely sober.  In fact I trance
_much_ deeper without drugs.

I rave a month or more  regularly without drugs to make sure that the

The report also showed that Morgan was 10 to 100 times below the toxic level
of these drugs.  His death was not directly caused by the drugs. It may have
allowed him to push himself over the edge of physical exertion but he did not

Quoting from the book E is for Ecstacy:

Overdosing affects the liver, and can cause death at doses of
between 15 and 200 tablets. He said that MDMA is broken down by the liver
into MDA and metabolites, which are excreted by the kidneys into the urine.

Urinary excretion of unchanged MDMA and its metabolites is complete within
24 hours. 65% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and 7% as MDA.

hey everyone,


  when i fiest srarted going to raves for the first two years i never
did any drug when going to a party and was still touched by the vibe.
  im glad ive used them also cause they have given me a new insights on
myself and other people, but i still go to more events straight then 
not.

  about the vibe and it being lost:

  i think that a lot of people who have been in the scene for awhile
have lost the inital euphoria and excitement of going to raves.  Their
visions of raves are clouded by thinking how good the  "ole days" were
and how horrible things are today.  I have to disagree.
  I still go with the idea that i can go have a good time and meet 
anyone at a party.  Thats whats its really about.  Dancing, getting into
the music and carrying along the vibe within yourself to others.

  on the east coast (where im from and went to parties for two years
before moving out here last year)  everyone is complaining about how
the drugs are ruining the scene.  two people in the scene in recent
weeks died of heroin overdoses, and in baltimore the drugs people are
usually offered are k and crystal, instead of e and acid.  

  people look at SF as the shining example of what a rave scene should
be.  and even tho there are faults in both scenes,  i think that what
is here, people should feel rather lucky about.

peace 

doug ) ( doug@squishy.com

p.s. -   Ive been going to a lot of raves lately to do a photo essay
about them.  Too many actually ;)  But my essay is almost complete
and i hope to have them posted up on hyperreal.  more info later :)

I propose that listening to the voice in your head is a hell of
a lot better than lining up under 10 cent e platitudes and thinking
beach blanket bingo can save the world.  Strap on your good karma
and set sail for the South Pacific.  You are shark bait.

How can anyone possibly suggest that ecstacy wasn't responsible 
for that poor fellow's death?  Does direct or indirect mean Jack 
to his friends and family??

The coroners report suggested that E was not responsible.

I just want to say that I have only been to one actual rave but I have 
attended smaller parties.  The first time I experienced all of you and that 
incredible sound on a sustem justified to play it right, I was totally 
high...in fact it was like flipping high (and that's so insane), but I hadn't 
taken any drugs.  I was high on all of you, your energy and that incredible 
physiologically compatiable rhythm that peameates us all when listening to 
house.  

My first real "rave" I was and it was also phenomenal, and different.  What I 
am trying to say is I get high from the people and the music.  I am constantly 
on a high that this community exists and that in my own way I am part of it 
and contribute to it all the positive energy and love that I can offer.  That 
has nothing to do with drugs.  What you bring is yours.  Most importantly, 
what you bring is you.  That's what really makes me high.

Love Anais

We can be anything we want, and feel any way we want, because we are creating 
our own community based on the values we cherish!

When I first heard it, I thought it meant 'plurality', as in 'the moral 
majority isn't, people everywhere wanna party'.

Many equate belief in the voice in their head to belief in their own sanity.
I'm one.

Agreed.

> E for Bullshit and toxic levels mean NOTHING.  

Not so. I am so goddamn fucking angry that people are still forced to buy
'recreational drugs' without really knowing what they are getting. How
many side reactions in a synthetic route are accounted for by the 'chemists'
out there? When designer drugs first appeared in the mid-80's, there were
a number of narcotic analogues that quickly fell out of fashion because the
'designers' were not purifying their product, and people were getting 
really messed up. The drug itself was not the problem. My interpretation 
is that legalization would at least result in people knowing what they 
are getting. 

People do not need to die this way. People have used drugs for thousands 
of years. They will continue to do so and so will I and so will you. We 
need to deal with the situation as it is, not as we wish it was. This
is not to say drugs are a requirement for this scene, but they are a *part*
of it, and it only takes one mistake.

See above. Also, in my experience, even if you have a pure substance, how
you otherwise treat yourself makes all the difference. People should just
get into the habit of making sure everyone is drinking plenty of water,
don't assume your friend knows that he/she needs water. Dehydration and
exhaustion can hurt you very badly; unfortunately, personal experience
confirms this.

I agree. I've flamed people on this list in the past and it produced nothing
of value.

Ok, someone said the Orb is playing in SF on June 16.  I called Bass and
they don't have it listed.  Where can I get tickets for the SF show?  I hope
to see you all at the Sac. show as well.  The Orb is worth a 1 1/2 hour drive.

The FMRs are hard to find because:

	1) It is a tradition
	2) It's suppose to be hard to find, that makes you feel
	   ever so happy when you do find it.
	3) If they are easy to find they quickly become out of control.

The FMRs start late because:
	1) There are less police patrols
	2) many of the DJ have earlier gigs
	3) it cuts down on the numbers and thus the chance of it getting busted

The FMRs are held way out because:
	1) The SFPD generally bust them immediately (except for one location)
	2) It's easier to blast sound in a remote area with no houses around
	   and live to tell the tale :)

At least one FMR ago, even I was surprised at the location and didn't find
out until 10 p.m. :)  It keeps it fresh.

> The coroners report suggested that E was not responsible.
> Read it yourself, or are you just trolling for flames as it would appear.

Ahem. F...... ok, I'm going to be nice about this since you're trolling
for flames.

I read it myself. Here's how I see it.

I'm still standing by a point I made April Anti-X posting: "Re: X
Fatality (was Re: The sky is falling - And that is only your opinion -
chicken little )" 
| (2) The crap that passes for X nowadays is a joke. It's much like playing 
|     russian roulette.

Ok, so it was mostly MDA and not MDMA. I'm wondering if that happened
because the producers fucked up in manufacturing -- MDA and MDMA are
closely related. I've heard that MDMA is a harder-to-make form of MDA,
and that one is a precursor to another. They're both speed. Keed Spills.

I've heard too many people say "this is really weird X... great visuals
though!" ... I guess the more out-of-it X posi-head might say "well, at
least they were really trying to make the right thing!".... :-(

And I don't know about you, but a rave is perhaps not the best setting
for MDA, especially if you're not expecting it. And MDA is really quite
nasty to your health (liver damage). 

Anyways... If you do look at the cause of death on the report, however,
you might notice that the causes of death are "edema" and "hemorrhage",
which are exactly the causes of death in DIC (disseminated
intravascular coagulation) which is a "documented problem with MDMA,
although very rare":

See this for yourself in what looks to be Peter Jones (Morgan Jones'
father?) posting of the coroner's report to this list:

| Subject: Death of Morgan Jones
| From:    peter@island.com (Peter Jones)
| Date:    Wed, 10 May 95 08:21:19 PDT
| 
| DIAGNOSES:   1. FOCAL EPICARDIAL HEMORRHAGE - HEART
|              2. NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSES - PITUITARY, ADRENAL,
|                 THYROID SPLEEN, PANCREAS, THYMUS, KIDNEY
|              3. MARKED EDEMA - LUNGS
|              4. VASCULAR CONGESTION - LIVER
|              5. EDEMA - BRAIN

Just for completeness, here's some clippings from a newsgroup discussion 
about this death that I reposted to sfraves on 4/4/95 ("Subject: X fatality"):

PS: As far as where I stand on all this. Legalize, Educate. Regulate.
Know. The current situation is designed to promote "war" as the
status-quo, which exists solely to sustain, enrich, and grow two armed
factions (government/police and drug dealers), neither of which would
exist without the other. And don't forget the whor(d)es of  Lawyers,
Judges, Prison Guards/Construction/etc, and the combinatorics of
possibilities that happen when corruption and graft are thrown in to
the pot. And that isn't even counting all the people on the sidelines
that are getting phucked while politicians and pimps are making fat
dollars off of misery. Why, I'll bet it's one of the largest
"industries" in amerikkka today!

Wow you would have to be pretty hard up to try that.
You would have to drink ALOT of urine to get any noticible effects.
I read somewhere that there are some Indians that drink their urine
after they eat some psychedelic substance to get the effects again.

Smart drinks anyone?

Dear All;

	Thanks to all da truely beautiful, loving people that took some
risks and shared their thoughts, feelings, & experiences around suicide,
with me and for me. It still feels good everytime I readem, and I do it a
lot. 

	I'm still pretty shaken by it, I'm told that some people are
really traumaized by such harse realities of life, eg me. They call it
emotional shock, sorta like when the body goes into shock tring to protect
itself from a lot of damage, only its emotional for me. 

	Each day gets a little better, I spent the day driving around the
little towns North and West of Marin, & Novato, respectively, on da coast.
I saw my 1st Redwood Forest, ever:), it was really cool!!!! :) I just had
an overwhelming desire and need to be around something green, natural, and
alive. 

	I decided today, while driving around to restart my horseback
riding lessons, English Saddle, or Western depending on where I get to
trail ride at, that's natural beauty wise. Its's sooo pretty where I was
today, so thats where I'm looking for a stable & instructor. I don't know
what I like more, the meadows, the hills/meadows, the huge Redwood
forests/hills/meadows, the cliffs by the sea, the ocean was sooo blue, its
just all sooo fantastic, beautiful, and wonderfully unique, just like us.
I'm going driving around up there tommorroe if anyone wants to join me,
call me at one of the numbers listed below. 

	Again thanks, it really makes me feel all warm, fuzzy, cared for,
and loved, and it won't be forgoten. Love & lots of huzs/ and a million
tiny little kisses all over :) :)

I think I was the only sfraver, and one of the few people under 25, that 
found their way to this. Very elite, very low contact company...for some 
reason I kept expecting a wave of the Haight crusties hippies to descend 
upon the free refreshents table and pilage the room of pizza and 
calastgo...but that never happened. At times it felt like having a rave 
at my Dad's company picnic, even got scolded by one of the producers 
for wiging out to much on the floor and was led to the corner. Still 
think that the Dead are kind of corney... but had a fine time, got me and a 
few friends some free t-shirts, and that's about all for now. 

Thanks for the post and thanks to the people involved.

Um, excuse me pardon me -- "lick our wounds and go on"?  I gotta call
you on that one, Pete1816.  I didn't know Morgan, but I bet I know
a couple dozen people who did.  He was one of *us*, the SF ravers.
Regardless of the precise cause of his death, it affects us all.
I'm not being trite by saying that.  

In the past year, three people I knew from the Well, my online home,
died from various causes.  In all cases the online community gathered
together in its own nonorganized way, and offered remembrances and
observations.  Death is a part of life, not to be ignored and not to
be belittled.  It is a part of the life experience we have not yet
experienced, but we will.  Our lives and deaths are part of the great
chain of being on this planet, in this universe.  When someone dies,
it is important and universal in all human cultures to recognize that
fact, acknowledge their experiences and contribution to our lives, and
remember that our very existence here is so dependent on our connections
to each other.

To me, the often-debated concepts of PLUR and the House Nation encompass,
in ways relevant to our current situation, underlying concepts that help
cement human societies together.  We will need that in the troubled times
to come, regardless of what labels we put on those concepts.  When a
tragedy occurs such as what happened to Morgan Jones, it is the height
of irresponsibility and immaturity and denial of our own human existence
to say, "lick our wounds and go on," as if someone's life was a car that
was totalled in a wreck.  The car is a total loss, a machine, we can
build another and go on.  A life is unique, it is part of our shared
humanity, not just a cartoon to be forgotten when the channel is changed.

I think we should all feel humbled by Peter Jones' posting of his son's
death certificate.  This is an important lesson for all of us.  What
little I know of his response to this ultimate family tragedy indicates
a strong, positive and loving attitude that is not content, as is so
often the case in our foolish and self-centered society, in laying *blame*
for this event but instead in finding the wisdom that helps us all move
forward.

Celebrate life.

This will be the last time I want to post on this subject for awhile

Jennifer Ann Hoogindish

Was the name of the girl who shot herself in the head approx 100 yards
>from the function known as kindness.
She was pronounced dead on Monday but the hospital would not release
that info until today. Half of me is greatful- The other very scared and
sad :(

I'm not a very religious person but today I prayed for Jennifer's soul.
That a gaurdian will take with her a new life and a new chance. I cried
again and felt very empty. I was sick from work again and am not sure
when I will return.

I still see her in me head when I close my eyes. I still cry.
I did not know her but I loved her none-the-less. I will heal as time
goes on. I don't handle death very well, but I still control my own
destiny. Few things in life are free. These are my favorite:

Love
Hope(watch the movie:shawshank redemtion)
Hugs
SMILES
music(yes it free to my heart)
dancing(ditto)


signing off for now:

PS: I like your responses, Keep them coming!

>Why are sad things like this being posted?  

Because it behooves everyone to know the truth about any drug-related incident.

>I mean yeah it was obvious that
>it wasnt the E that killed him.... so... 

Though I ain't no biochemist, I gather that Morgan took a misrepresented 
substance that caused a deadly, though rare, reaction.  The literature shows 
that MDA is FAR more toxic than MDMA, and maybe two hits of unadulterated 
MDMA would have left him alive to dance today.

>I know that i am probably gonna get
>mail back on this, but, cant we just lick our wounds and go on?

My anger is directed less at you and more at unscrupulous chemists and 
dealers.  But most of my bitterness on this issue is aimed at a country 
that, through years of ignorance and sanctimony, believes (for the most 
part) that drug use is immoral.  If the stuff were legal then we'd all know 
just what we're taking; and I'd like to think that everyone would be 
interested enough to _read_ about what they're doing to their bodies.  
Everyone would be wiser, safer, and happier.

*  Every MDMA-eater should have and read _PiKHAL_ and/or the other lit.

*  Every MDMA-eater should know and trust his chemist/dealer like a bro.

*  Let's do away with the nicknames.  Not only does using slang like "E" and 
   "Nexus" misrepresent the product, it makes the speaker sound like a    
   high-school hood.

*  Let's push ever harder to get these things legalized already. 

More later......

Heh, too true!  Although I've noticed that sfravers don't appreciate Wicked
nearly enough..."awww, the Full Moon was too late and too far away..." - the
fact that's it's totally underground and totally free seems to be lost on
many.  Of course, I don't know everything about that scene, but they seem a
tad bit spoiled (goes with having all those incredible dj's and great city,
I guess).

        The first time my best friend and i did E we ended up going to the
supermarket the day after the party, early in the morning too as the party
had been busted.  We ran around aimlessly throught the lurid aisles of
product, yelling to each other "let's get some ice cream" and getting lots
of wierd stares.  We ended up leaving empty handed as we found that we
weren't really that hungry anyway.
        Oh yeah, we had our sunglasses on the whole time.
        Gawd, we must've been annoying ;)

I read somehting about that too(Food of the Gods maybe?)  Siberian reindeer
herdsmen have been known to drink the urine of their reindeer after seeing
them eat Fly Agaric(Amanita Muscaria) mushrooms.  Apparently the deer get a
nice high,  stagger around, and do a good job of removing or reducing the
toxins.  I think those shrooms will pretty much kill a human if ingested
directly.
So the question is how to get the e outa the pee....

Anyone read the liner notes to that 50 years of sunshine CD?
Supposedly there's a psychedelic mushroom (maybe the ones around today) 
that you could drink the urine of whomever took it (usually a 
"priest/shaman/whatver") and trip out too.

Ok people! =)

Death takes alot of energy out of the living!
I have delt with death receantly with my best friends wife(cancer), and let
me tell you it takes so much energy it's completely draining.  With all
this talk about death its got me thinking of how I delt with the loss.  And
what we all have to do is keep our minds busy, be strong, talk about it,
but never forget its around the corner.  All this support on the list is
wonderful.  If I had this much support last year I wouldn't have had to
take a leave of abbsence from work.  But allwell, its great to see people
caring!!! =) =)

Thought I'd put my 2 cents in....

They would also eat it them selves and save their own piss. It's a 
beautiful shroom (big and red with cool white spots all over it) that grows
in the bay area. It's toxicity varies greatly from person to person. Everywhere 
from a very mild reaction - to delirium, hallucinations, babbling and cold 
sweats - to convulsions, uncontrollable shaking, and in very rare cases, death. 
(I learned this at a Fungus Festival in Santa Cruz. It was a totally legit 
type of thing.)

Isn't weird how the exact same substance can cause such a wide variety of 
reactions in different people.  Probably some kinda lesson there or something.

I didn't fully realize what the story behind Morgan Jones was
due to my somewhat sporadic reading of this list.  Perhaps I missed
an entire discussion on this already.

However, my quick reaction was how Pathetic it is to be defending
the drug - "oh it's indirect", "you could/should do this", "ecstacy
is still great, how sad about that guy".

When I was first exposed to this drug I went to the Library.  What
I found at the time were mostly journal articles with a psychiatric
lean to them.  Lots of detailed accounts of the drug experience.
Among these accounts, were the occasional
Extremely Bad Reaction.

One case of a two couples, same drug source, and a fabulous
evening at home.  A month later, same drugs, one woman walks
outside and describes "the world going greyish black like a nuclear
armeggedon", she passes out and is hospitalized for 36 hours
during which time she hallucinates wildly and must be carefully
watched and medicated.  The other 3 were fine.

Now you can speculate til the cows come home about why this kinda
thing happened or can happen.  But that is missing the point.

It Does Happen.
It is a Serious Drug.  
There are Serious Risks.
 
Risks that have nothing to do with the pop-chemistry crap that passes 
for scientific proof of the wonderfulness of ecstacy.  This is the
reality of Life.  You can't justify or explain it all.

I've said this before - I think informed adults can do what they
want.  Phred said exactly what I would have.  There is a young man
who is dead, gone Forever.  That is the Big Bad world that raving
is a Part of.  There is no escape from it.  It is real.  And some
of you should grow up a little.  Immortality is for kids.

Had Morgan's chemist been a bit more tightassed, we wouldn't be having this 
conversation.  

Look, maybe dispensing with the street names is a bit severe, but everytime 
a raver dies from anything remotely drug-related, everytime a raver with no 
pupils gets in front of a tv camera, and everytime a rave-related accident 
endangers life/property, we get a step closer to having the guvmint end 
raving forever.  MDMA is dangerous.  Now you and I know that it's less 
dangerous than eating a Jumbo Jack, but the government doesn't make those 
kind of distinctions.  We must be on our best behavior to keep credibility.  
This doesn't mean "don't do E", it means "do E responsibly". 

>>*  Let's push ever harder to get these things legalized already.
>hmmm.

I've only been to a few ba.events, but the authorities here pretty much 
leave the MJ/LSD/MDMA set alone, which is great: we're the least likely to 
bring violence into it.  But if they wanted to, they could seize anything at 
any event under the cloak of "good faith" without trial.  Done often enough, 
it would kill the scene.  The only way we can overcome the fear that's 
causing us (and the Joneses & g-slaying victims & the incarcerated & their 
families) so much grief is to legalize drugs, tax the shit out of them, and 
use the money for education and quality control.

Okay.  I'm through preaching to the choir now.  Back to our regularly 
scheduled programming.

You really cannot be serious when you said"mdma is dangerous..Now you
and I know that it's less dangerous than eating a Jumbo Jack"

I hope that this is not an attempt to trivilize recent deaths.  People 
are dead, people just like you and I.

Drugs are dangerous period. It's a risk some of us take.

Let us not try and manipulate statistics following the same path trodden
by the tabacco industry.

Virtually everyone has eaten fast food in america. There are few injuries
deaths per participant. It would be interesting to see how many people
who have taken mdma have experianced problems or death.

Your post reminded me of a joke i heard somewhere

Three statisticians go on a hunting trip with bows and arrows.
they spend hours getting just close enough to their prey.
one fires and the arrow lands ten feet to the right of the deer.
hurridly another fires and the arrow lands ten feet to the left.
All heads turn as the third throws his bow to the ground and yells
we got him we got him!

More often than not anyone using statistics to prove their point is 
quietly hiding a fact or two not included in the study.

Nevertheless this story leads me to think of some of the things I have
done haphazardly, or taken at raves.....and shudder..then thank god or
whoever that I am very fortunate.

I have a friend who went to Oregon and picked a bunch of those mushrooms!
They looked like Super Mario Brothers mushrooms that make you get big when
you get 'em (does anyone know what I am talking about?).  Real cool.  So
anyway he and another friend dried them and ate them.  My role in this
whole thing was to call 911 if somthing were to go wrong...  (Yeah, I know
it was stupid, but we were just punk kids).

So  nothing happened for hours and hours, they ate more and more, about
eight hours later they gave up.  Later still-- They suffered from chronic
fatigue for about three days.  Their self proclaimed conclusion: "We're
sleeepy."

The moral of my story:

        Don't eat strange fungi if you have important things to do in the  
                                                         future.

        I agree completely, actually i wrote up this little thing about my
thoughts on life and death and other fun 'big questions.'  It might be
interesting for me to post it to the list and see how other ppl feel..it's
long (about 13-15K) but if there are no objections i could post it in the
next couple of days..it's generally along the hindu/taoist/quantum
physics/buddhist/chaos theory/discordian/general wierdness tip...

        have a good day and smile :)

Don't worry about me getting ideals, Craig, for if I had any I wouldn't get
the idea to eat the mushrooms.  (And if I didn't eat the mushrooms....well,
you know where I'm going with that.)

Subject: Exercising Caution
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I think we're all basically saying the same thing:
Please make well-informed choices. 

I would especially caution those with lots of known allergies.
Me, I was allergic to all artificial coloring, flavoring, eggs,
wheat, milk, perfums, wool, and corn syrup while growing up. 
I am still horribly affected by 
chocolate and certain other foods (anything fried leaves me 
totally depressed). Aside from the very few drugs I have introduced 
into my system, I know I won't be introducing any more 
unknowns- I'm just too sensitive. I've also been careful to 
monitor myself: next day temperature taking, inspecting my 
skin for weird abbrasions, checking my color, gum color, etc... 
I guess it's somewhat paranoid, but given my history perhaps 
you'll sympathize- I approach all new substances/foods/liquids 
with the tenant," If there's an allergic reaction to be had, 
it's quite likely I'll have it."

Also those who take regular medication 
for whatever ills he/she may suffer: please talk to your 
doctor about mixing stuff. 

It would be great to compile a list of internists (internal medicine 
practitioners), ob/gyns, dermatologists, etc.... who are 
rationally pro-informative towards the use of illegal substances.
Any recommendations out there? 

As for Morgan Jones, it seems completely obvious to me that this 
was one of those "rare" DIC cases. As far as I'm concerned, 
neither denial nor hysteria are appropriate responses; 
acknowledgement seems fitting. 

A world of open possibilities would be one of the ways I might describe 
raves. This being the case, it's easy enough to admit DIC as 
one of those possibilities without totally trashing or 
permanently tarnishing the positive experiences many have with E. 
For E users, acknowledging DIC might change (probably does) the 
perspective/experience of E, but, frankly, I think it changes it for 
the better simply because we are aware of one more possibility. 

If knowledge is power, then humility and empowerment are 
not mutually exclusive.

"I don't know" is better than a lie.

with gentle reverence-

Jocelyn

Hello,

	I don't actually remember who posted about Safeway. But I did 
want to comment on it, but had to go to class so now's my chance!!! 

	I have to say that for some really strange reason, I used to 
love going to safeway while being x-cited. I don't know why. Maybe it 
was because of all the bright beautiful colors, or the fun that we would 
have playing with fruits, and veggies! We always found ourselves 
sitting in some isle, playing with some sort of food! It was always on 
our must do list for the night if we were kicking it at a house. I don't 
know.. Supermarkets in general are fun! (sometimes, like at 4am.!) 

Peace to all beautiful people, 
(including the real friendly supermarket employees!!!!!)

The the Psychedelics Encyclopedia the author talks about the web-spinning, 
doped out spiders. The most "regular" web was spun on LSD while the most 
"fucked-up" web was on a caffeine dose. Very interesting experiment.

Yeah, the Safeway thing.

I remember going in with one of those crystals in the neat shapes that scatter 
light into those beatiful rainbows.  Well, the produce section was really
amazing when looking through the crystal and moving down the rows.  Rolling
around on the floor laughing could not be helped.

Hello all you beautiful people,

My personal favorite (at 15, first time on L) was
taking a leisurely stroll through the detergent isle.

Hello,
	Not to drag out this subject anymore than it already has been, I 
have to say a few things...(Soory.)

	I never understood the whole money thing with promoters and 
parties, until I realized how much money they are making in one night. 
But then I realized how much money they are putting up, how much energy 
they are using, and how much time it takes to plan a party. I am not 
saying that I justify throwing parties to pay the rent! I personally 
would never think of doing that, let alone do that! But that is my 
opinion and not other peoples'. I think that if Wicked and/or anyother 
organization wants to be in it for the money, then they should be able 
to do so! (Without redicule!) I personally don't have a problem 
supporting them as long as I still enjoy their parties. As long as it is 
worth paying the price. I give a lot credit to the "bigger" promoters. 
If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have such great memories! For 
example: Who remembers... Wicked and Get Down on memorial day weekend 
(may29th) about two years ago? It was at the Santa Rosa Fairgrounds! 
That was one of the best parties (Bay Area) that I can remember!(IMO) 

	Now, I have read some posts that people don't like supporting 
them. Then don't!!! Take your energy somewhere else! There are lots of 
parties to go to where you could have the time of your life, for next to 
no money. 

	When we do "Harmony" or "Beautiful People", it is tough trying 
to figure out how much to charge. First we never really know how many 
people to expect, but eventually take a wild guess. Then divide that 
into our overall cost and get a price! We never make money, and if we 
did we would not keep it. (We would donate it!) 

	Anyways I am getting side-tracked. The point I am trying to make 
is that you can support anyone you want! If you have a problem with a 
certain group then don't support them! But you shouldn't "flame" them 
for what they do, that is their choice! I am thankful that they are 
throwing parties close to home so that I can go every once and awhile.

Peace, love, and harmony to all beautiful people,

Greg

Ps. These are my views and my views only!!!! I am speaking only for 
myself and not other members of Harmony or Beautiful People. 
(Although they probably feel pretty much the same...) Thanx!

i think all this discussion of the effects and dangers of ecstacy 
proves one thing: nobody, not nobody, not no how, really knows the 
extent of what e does to a person.  what we don't know can't hurt 
us?...

i've raved sober and i've raved high, and i've come to enjoy raving 
sober the most.  it just feels more sincere, and i remeber the party 
better.  plus, it saves me some bucks.  which is not in anyway to put 
down getting high... ;)  

i think plur should be changed to lurp, because that's the sound a 
raver makes a hour into his e trip when he remebers in a most 
unfortunite way the burger he forgot he ate at three in the 
afternoon...

love,

my own favorite Safeway rave experience involves going in at 3am , 
picking up a can of whipped cream and doing a "whippet" (sucking the 
nitrous oxide) in the cereal isle and then tripping out on the goofy 
cartoon boxes and other fun products..........aaron S,P.A.Z...

Well, I'm back in Vancouver from London.  Since my priorities are 
1)Family 2)Partying 3)Sightseeing 4)Reading e-mail(I have over 700 
pieces waiting)suffice it to say for now that Tribal Gathering went off 
big time.
I hope to have pix up on my web site eventually, stay tuned.

        What it all boils down to is something that we have WAY to little
of today and that is common sence.  If people used common sence, instead of
picking apart every little detail of things then we would have no problem.
People put way too much faith in the gray areas of life when the sould be
no gray areas.  This is the reason that racisim exists, (you should base
your opinion of people on what THEY are like and not anyone else). It is
also the reason for the downfall of the american judicial system, which was
built around common sence, If there is a crime commited and you think
someone did it it is black or white, he either did it, or he didn't do it.
If there is a reasonable doubt to whether he did it or not then he didn't
do it.  COMMON SENCE it is the backbone of our nation(Read the
Constitution!)  Thank you for the soapbox, and RAVE-ON!!  LATER

>yes i quite agree with you here... raving sober is a very true way to 
experience the communal/tribal/friendly/honest "vibe" in a party. if you 
really connect with a person and both of you are sober, i dunno... it 
seems this is really real and legitimate and sincere. not that i have any 
problem with drugs, i have certainly been to many parties very high. but 
i tend to prefer sobreity. after a while, being high all the time is too 
taxing and tends to induce fatigue - anathema to constant partying.

Hello, this is Bruce Eisner. I just signed onto your list for the first time because I never had a way of dealing 
with all the mail previous to my new Netmanage Chameleon 4.5 which allows me to put things in nice little 
folders.  
Anyway, I haven't followed this thread from the beginning, but I'm probably one of the world's top four or five 
top experts on the subject of ecstasy, having written Ecstasy: The MDMA Story in two editions and having 
lectured around the U.S. I first took ecstasy back in 1978.  Thus, my first exposure was over 17 years ago.  I've 
lived through a generation with ecstasy as my drug of choice. It seems to have had no descendible ill effects 
on me.  I've studied the literature and find that it backs up the conclusion that MDMA use,when confined to 
infrequent exposures (less than once a week), and with small total amounts (under 250 mgm total ingested), 
has no neurotoxicity.
Well having said that, I'll tell you what the biggest danger to using ecstasy these days is.  It's the fact that most 
ecstasy sold in the underground is not ecstasy or is ecstasy cut with other things.  If people got pure ecstasy 
and used in moderation (that is stable people without a family history of mental disorder or any in their 
personal history), I don't think there would be a problem at all. In fact, alcohols and tobacco are the biggest 
killers by far among drugs, and even aspirin kills many times as many people a year as MDMA.

i tend to prefer sobriety. after a while, being high all the time is too 
taxing and tends to induce fatigue - anathema to constant partying.

Sorry for the 2nd post...

but I forgot to mention that the Live 105 "Rock Doc" specializes in 
drug use. His name is Gene Schoenfeld.

I don't know him, but his private practice number is (415) 956-9366. 
The Live 105 "Rock doc" radio show email is els@well.sf.ca.us.

If anyone does compile a reference list, or knows of an existing one, 
please tell me where I can get one!

The world-at-large considers these people "shrinks". But they're great 
general practitioners to have available if one of the main factors in 
your health (physical *and* mental) is the ingestion of drugs (legal 
or illegal).

My only caution with them is that they tend to be overly enthusiastic 
about Rxing antidepressants. (but I'm not much for popping pills and 
hesitate to take *anything*... even vitamins! so this may be an 
incredibly biased opinion)

Alex and Janice Stalcup (Walnut Creek) (510) 947-1860 or 430-4370
Howard Kornfeld (Mill Valley) (415) 383-8336

I doubt that they have time to just answer phone-in questions, but if 
you want to be a patient of theirs: Be persistent! They may not 
return your first call. You can say Alissa Feinberg referred you 
(Howard may not recognize my name at first but Alex and Janice 
definately will).

Also, tho' I don't have experience with it, one of the 
pharmacologists they work with is at the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic 
which is supposedly really great with drug-related health issues.

Take care everybody! Stay healthy!

I remember a couple of times the morning after raving and I'd still be 
frying slightly.  I'd listen to the *goofy* music and watch people shopping at 7 
in the morning.....I thought it was the funniest thing in the whole world 
- just watching the customers roam about the store, watching them look at 
food labels and deciding yay or nay as Barry Manilow swooned over the 
speakers.  Hee hee it was so hilarious!!! :):)

Amy

Very true.....But I have to say that you can be sincere while high, too.  
The true test is what happens the next day when you are sober.  There is 
nothing worse (imo) than someone who says all kinds of wonderful things 
to you and connects with you the night before, only to have that person 
shun you the next day.  That is a bunch of BS having that happen.
my 2 cents for the night.

Amy

this message out of context (i.e. skipped the first one ;) kinda catches

Excuse me. uh..  How the HELL do you do E resposibly?  From the hours of
9pm to 2am?  21 and over?  Take a Cab?

>>>*  Let's push ever harder to get these things legalized already.

I can't believe that people think you should legalize acid and E.
LEGALIZING drugs doesn't solve any problems.  Have you ever hung out with
someone who was so Ill'ed out for drugs they would do anything?  IT's a
disgusting sight.  Alot of my old friends are E freaks now and they look
like zombies.  I think E destroyed alot of good 'rave' scenes across the
u.s.  E is just another good high.

Being from the midwest originally, My friends and I got into the scene
purely for music and vibe..  We went out till 8 am purely for music and
vibe..  i.e.  The scene was built on music.  Out here in Cali, the scene
seems like it was built on E, Crystal Meth, Pot whatever..  IT's just kinda
wacked out..

This aint the sixties my friend..

Why can't we just play good fucking music, kick the drug dealers out and
shake our booties all night lone?  Why make things so complicated?

	I think an event in everyone's trip will eventually be the trip 
to the convenience store. Something primal occurs and the hunt for food 
must take place. Not just food but snack food. Pringles are a personal 
favorite of mine. Don't eat the bacon flavored french fries. MSG does not 
make a happy day. After Rave donuts are a personal favorite of mine. Oh 
yah, and don't forget the whippits %)...

Another common result is probably worse than death -- being forced to
undergo dialysis for the rest of your life because your liver or
kidneys got destroyed by a random wild mushroom. Unless you're really
experienced, some of the mushrooms pictured in the book might look like
the mushroom you just ate, when in fact, you just ingested a highly
toxic substance which will make your vital organs do the ultimate
sacrifice just to save your life. If you're lucky, however, you'll be
dead.

My Aunt is a mycologist. Once, when I was six, she gave me a petri dish
that glows in the dark. It was a strange form of photoluminescent
mushrooms that are the cause of "witches circles" in the old world --
glowing rings of dirt with the mushroom "root" causing the glow.
Supposedly in the northeast coast of the US and canada, similar glowing
shrooms can be found in decaying fallen tree trunks.

And who was it that did that trippy sixties song "Amanita sitting in
the sun" ???

Ob rave (?) ... personally, I think mushrooms are plants from an alien
world :-)... Their whole mode of survival, growth, reproduction, FX, 
etc is completely different from any other "life" on earth. Is that a
mushroom or the 2001-monolith said the mckenna-monkey ?

Well I the first mail I got was on MDMA toxicity so I never really had a chance to introduce myself to the 
group.My name is Bruce and I've been involved in the psychedelic world since I turned on at age 19 in 1967.  I 
was one of those hippies you read about in the history books and I'm one of those ravers your children may 
read about in the history books.
I've written much on psychedelics, consciousness, MDMA, and creating a psychedelic culture.  I am in the 
process of having my Island page (currently in transit at http://www.systemv.com/island/) to show more about 
what Island is about --which is focusing on the transformation of the currently culture by integrating new and 
ancient ideas into an experimental culture.  Along the way, we publish newsletters (Island Views), hold 
conferences (Bridge Conference Stanford 1991, Bicycle Day UCSC 1993) and sometimes even hold potlucks 
or salons.
My other hat is as head of a small software company called Mind Media. Our current and new url is 
http://www.mindmedia.com.  We publish software and are interested in developing psychoactive computer 
applications.  
Well, I live alone at the edge of the Pacific.  Currently I'm single and open to new friends and relationships.  
Looking toward summer with hope.  Glad to finally be on your list (now that I have my mail setup right).  So 
e-mail me if you want to chat or hook up or find out more.

Greetings...


Its currently:  9:05:05 PM  5/12/94  PST

Well,  now am a captive person,  sitting in an airplane at the moment,
getting cought up on my correspondance.    Right at the moment,   I'm
flying across the Great Australian Bite.   It's the southern part,
that looks like someone bit off the lower portion of the land mass.
Currently flying over the Southern Ocean,  with nothing between me
and Antarctica.   Partly cloudy outside at the moment.

I'm heading to Perth... in South Western Australia,  where I'm due to
land at 1 pm local time (One day ahead of Calif).  I'm to meet some
Perth ravers,  and this evening,  planning to attend a big fat 18 hour
rave (Drool!!).   So,  here's what I found out,  about the cities I
visited so far.

Sydney - mainstream rave scene,  mostly Happy Hardcore,  or what
   old schoolers call "KiddieKore".  There is a lot of house,  acid
   trance of the hard variaty.    Radio plays a LOT of house and techno.
   ar more than the Bay Area,  thats for sure.   There is NO ban on
   using the words fuck, shit,  etc on the air,  and radio here has
   much more variaty.    Also,  there are a lot of non-commercial community
   stations coming on the air.

Melbourne - Mostly house.  Acid Trance,  little or no HardCore,  but this
   was just ONE rave I attended.   (Land of the giants).   Quite large,
   about 5000 people.

Adlaide - Lots and lots of heavy hardcore of the british variaty with
  MC's yelling in the mics.   Which I really don't like that much.   No
  particular message,  other then a lot of "fuck,  shit,  etc".
  I wouldn't mind MC's if they had a speciic message about love and
  peace.   But these are my observations so far.

Canberra - Lots of Happy Hard.   Also house.   Canberra,  being the
  capitol of Australia,  and the center of government activities,  has
  the laxest marjuana laws in Audstralia.   It's practically decriminalized
  and a bag (about 3/4th of an 8th) costs about $45 Aus.  $1 Aus = .73 US$

"E" is horrendously expensive (almost always $60 a tab).   Acid costs between
$15 and $20 a hit,  but is really good.    Daffy Ducks are really popular
and very good.

Sydney has the strictest drug enforcement in Australia.   Thus bags go
from $60 - $70.   Up north (Nimbin,  Byron Bay) is supposed to have the
cheapest pot prices.  Brisbane I have yet to visit,  is more redneck
attitudes.

I'll report on Perth/ Darwyn later..

There is a big push here to completly decriminalize pot.  Even the
authorities and police are behind this.

Medical care is FREE,   very consious of the AIDS virus here,   and they
have a very sensible approach to combating aids.   One gets free condoms,
and ALL the whores on the streets have an adequate supply on hand.

In Kings Cross (Where all the strip joints, and sex houses are),  they
have a store dedicated to Condoms.   Thats right,  a whole store of just
about every method possible to help one have protected sex.

Raves here are MAINSTREAM,  and are even advertized on Radio and TV
constantly.   Rave posters sit on sides of busses,   in railway stations,
and the trains.

Public transpo is amazingly efficient,  although rather expensive.   Best
bargain is to get a weekly pass for $19.   Gives you unlimited access to
busses,  trains,  and ferries.    Because Sydney has a lot of inlets and
bays,   ferries are used,  and are much faster than trains.    The boats
have amazing speed and accelleration.

Sydney is so spread out,  that it covers about 100 miles in width.
The entire population of australia is only 18 million people in a land
mass 80% of the size of the USA.   80% of Australia's population is
on the South east side.    Distances between cities are FAR,  and
nothing but empty land between them,  or farms.   About 60 miles west
of Sydney are the Blue Mts.    I've had the pleasure to hang out with
the Earth First Foundation,  who has a beautiful horticulture spread
of many achres of land.   They take pride in their plants and gardens.

I'm trying to help them get on the WEB,   by putting them in touch with
many of the computer folks I met in my travels.

More on Australian radio...  They have just ONE government sponsored
station that plays rock music,  techno,  and a lot of other music forms
not heard on radio in the USA.   One is "triple-j",

triplej@ozziemail.oz.com.au

All radio stations have Email addresses,  as well as mainstream TV.
Internet over here is a household word.   Just about everyond who has
a modem and a computer is on the internet.   AARNET is a cooperative
organization,  working with Telecom Australia to provide hookups to
all the universities.   APANA,  a non-profit organization offers
anyone internet hookups for $50 Aus/  year.   Anyone with a PC can
SLIP or PPP into APANA,  and most BBS's are hooked to this very slow
64kb link.

triplej is nationwide,  ahd heard all over australia.   Austrailia
is sorta  SINGLE community,  in that the whole country had the consiousness
an closeness of a single city,  just spread out over a huge huge area.

There is little or no differences in slang from one part of the country
to the next.   Little difference in accent no matter where you go.

Other Inet providers have direct hookup to AARNET backbone which has
bandwidth of 20 MB/sec.   They also maintain a 4.5 Mb link to the USA,
but new INet providers are setting up their own 64kb links,  although
are slower than the USa/Aus 4.5 mb link,  I get much better response.

Because internet is so popular with the general public,   after about
4 pm,   it's almost impossible to dial into the POPS as most phone lines
are busy.   Especially Geko.   Geko is so choked with overloaded phone
lines and such,  and is the most unpopular and unreliable system.  Their
prices are competitive with other providers.  So far,   I've evaluated

Microplex - mpx.com.au   (Fairly expensive $4/hr,  plus I/o charges
  but gives you a few free hours for a fixed fee per month.   One can
  run up a big bill surfin the WEB.    Mpx does allow telnet into and
  out of the system.

Geko - no hourly charges,  but had I/o charge,  so if you download
  lots of gifs,  you can get big bills.   This has the most users,
  but Dez Blanchard (owner of Geko),  has a policy of not allowing
  or discouraging people from telnetting into it.   They have the
  toughest firewall (even the Mail POP is behind the wall).

Zip - New kid on the block... No I/O,  and no hourly charges.  only
  3 lines at the moment,  and went on-line just last weekend.   I've
  got a 3 week free evaluation account,  and I'm helping them get the
  bugs out of their system using PPP method of connection.   They have
  their OWN links to the USA,  and appear to be the most reliable.
  They allow telnet into and out of zip.   Also the mail pop is available
  from other sites.

Ozziemail - Operated by Telecom Australia (Phone Co)  Naturally their
  hourly charges are the highest (About $6 hr - non prime,  and $8/hr
  prime.   But cheaper than using long distance (Which is $18 hour non
  prime and $25/hour prime).   Of course they have local dialups to
  about 18 Austrlian cities.

The employment here is amazingly low.   Getting jobs here are amazingly
easy (for Australians only).   Almost anyone can find work here.   There
is an especially large demand for workers in the Service industry.   In
fact,  Australia has the toughest immigration policy,  and it's almost
impossible for non-australians to get legal work here.   Now,  they are
talking about easing this,  to allow more foreign workers access to the
many jobs.

Software jobs are harder to get...  there is a large amount of programmers
here (All are graduates from Uni's).   Education here is FREE!!  through
University level.

Standard of living is Very high...  But on the 'Cross" there are still
pan handlers,  but nowhere near the level in the USA.

In general, society is kinda like the USA was 10 years ago,  but with
the general public very much into high tech toys.   For instance,  the
biggest fad is portable digital phones.  Everyone has one.   They only
cost $400 and service is $30/month plus air time.  Incoming calls
are FREE (which makes it attractive to have them),  but people calling
portable phones pay the air time,  via special nation wide area codes
(018) and (015).

Rave info numbers are the real BITCH.  They can cost $3/minute to
get location of raves.  Its like rave info numbers in the USA having
900 numbers.  Only in Aus,  they are 0055 numbers.   The real pisser
is that you have to listen to music for at least 2 minutes before any
info is given out.   And it's given out so slow that the call duration
is about 6- 7 minutes before you get the location.    Thus costing
about $15 to $20 to find out where it is.

Raves (Kiddie mainsteam ones) cost $35 if U get tickets in Advance
at record shops.   Or upwards of $60 at the door.   A typical rave
weekend would be broken down as follows.

Location info  - $15 for calling 0055 number to get location
Admittance     - $35 advance,   $60 at the door.
Hit if E       - $60
Hit if A       _ $25  (Often called a "T".

It costs up to $160 a weekend to rave.
 The After party (Called recovery) costs $7.   Mostly pays Happy Hard
core,  goes on from 9 am to about 2 am Monday morning.  Usually at the
Pavillion Tavern.   Very nice,  well ventilated and cool venue.

This next few weeks,  are having a DJ contest!! Quite unique I might
add.

WOW!! Just discovered that I'm over land again....   Batteries running
low,  and plane is due to land soon,  so will close off...  Land looks
brown and parched... partly cloudy down there.   Pilot anounced
that we are landing now,   temp in Perth 19 C.   Wind 25Km/hr.]

Gotta pack my lapop away now...

Good Morning all.

Well.  I've just discovered that San Francisco State U. has accepted me, humm.  I don't know much about the 
place itself besides that it seems to carry a good name.  I'd like to know if any the SFRave community goes 
there... If so, could you guys/girls drop me a line.  I'd love to talk to you and find out a bit more about the 
place (opinions and the such).

And I'd like to cruise over there and take a look with my own eyes.  If anyone is up for keeping me company 
just let me know.  Thanks.
---------
Question.

Why is it Safeway?  What about good old Lucky or 7-11, the others.  Does just Safeway hold this amazing 
ravelike experience that no other grocery store can provide... It caught my attention.

        Tell me about it...i've had experiences such as this (as have we
all i'm sure) and i even have talked about it with friends and they've gone
so far as to say "I hate E and e-heads, sloppy people rubbing up against
you and telling you that 'you're my favorite dj' or 'i love you' or
whatever when they hardly know me.'  It's funny though...some of these
people should do more e i think as they have such a bad attitude.  There
should be a balance.
        Peace, Love, Unity, Sincerity, and Respect,

Yeah, but what do you use to take down an elusive Pringle? Do you prefer 
a hunting rifle, or more primitive methods? I have found a sling to be 
rather brutal, as it has a tendancy to crush the Pringle, denying one of 
all the Salty Goodness.....

This is only rave related in that it's based on sound, creates a trance-like
state of mind and can move you spiritually.

Did anyone els go see the Gyuto Tantric Choir last night at UC Davis or a
couple of weeks ago when they were in SF?  Oooommmmmm My God.  Can I say
that what these Tibeten Monks do with sound boggles the mind---literally.
They do what's called polyphonic chanting, where each monk chants a
simultaneous, three-note chord.  Thats one voice singing three notes at the
same time, then ad nine more monks doing the same thing and....... well, I
trancended my body more than once.

Just some thoughts.

They'll be at the Palace of Fine Arts, on the 27th, I believe.

Hello! Are there any sfravers who are going tonight? 
Is it supposed to be any good? Is it an all ages event? 
I tried calling the info#, but it still says to call closer to the time 
of the event. 
But... 
If I'm going to drive 4 hrs to go to an event, I'm going to try my 
best to find out if it's going to be good!
Any info would be greatly appreciated.
Everyone have a wonderful, safe weekend!	  -Alex

     Went to Pure Space around 1 a.m. only to find the vibe not quite to my 
     liking.  I think there was lots of crossover people from the party 
     that ended at midnight.  Maybe I'm just too picky but I don't like the 
     club scene much.  In any case,  I thought it'd be good w/the dj 
     line-up but I just can't handle the heavy vibrating bass that jiggles 
     my inners for too long.  
     
     So I headed over to Lift 'cause I always have a good time there.  It 
     took a while for people to come in from the other clubs but it 
     eventually got off.  It was a good mix of people and the music finally 
     improved when David Harness started mixing.  Sometimes it's difficult 
     to harness the energy of a group if you keep screwing w/the tempos and 
     rhythms as they did early on.  Makes you kinda wonder who they're 
     playing for...  But I've found Lift people to be forgiving and dance 
     or stand on the dance floor to almost anything :)
     
     Afterwards people mentioned Cocktails or the End-up.  It was a toss up 
     and at 6am, both were very slow to start.  I had to be in Palo Alto 
     for work at 8am so I left around 6:30 and things still hadn't 
     picked-up like last week after ComeUnity...what a shame.
     
     Still, it's been a wonderful way to start my Friday, with warm smiles 
     and hugs from old and new friends.  I just wanted to let you know how 
     Thursday night was for me and wish y'all a good weekend with whatever 
     you'll be doing.
     
     Mmmmmmmmmm, SSSSiiiiIIIIGHHHHHH!  Just breathing feels wonderful right 
     now :o
     
     Hugs, kisses, and deep, warm wishes,
     Diane

Ug! Just the thought of food makes my stomach turn after ingesting an

I'll take it a step further though. I think E is *the* shit, but it can
definitely have some serious mental ramifications.     A while back, I
finally kissed a girl, while both of us were EXcited.    Of course the
experience was mind blowing, best kissing I've ever experienced, (an
especially strong statement for me, because I hold good kissing in SUCH high
regard).  But since then, although the memory is so wonderful, It's kind of
bothered, and sometimes even pained me.   Unfortunately, I didn't (and
probably won't) get the chance to kiss her sober, so I'll never know how much
of it was her, and how much of it was something else.   More importantly, the
whole experience was SO incredibly excellent, that I'm actually kind of
worried, and wonder if its possible to duplicate without any help?   In a
way, it almost makes kissing now a little anti-climactic, a little sad.   It
kind of reminds me of a line in "Sit Down" by James,  "If I hadn't seen such
riches, I could live with being poor"   Any thoughts???   Tom

In order:
  Read up extensively on it, both pro and con, with an objective set of 
    ears.  Pay close attention to what the medical community has to say.
  Talk with others about their experiences with it, both positive and
    negative.  Pay attention to those with medical experience.
  Buy it from someone you trust, someone you have known for more than
    a few months, someone who has a vested interest in your safety.
  The first time you take it, take it in a comfortable, calm environment
    (your home, a friends home) and with someone else who is either 
    abstaining or has done it before.  This person should also be one 
    from whom you are not hiding any substantial personal problems or
    feelings, for they will probably come out.
  
	MDMA is a powerful tool, no contest.  The results of using it may or 
may not be positive, depending almost entirely upon your state of mind 
and your surroundings.  "Set and setting".  

  When you are comfortable with its effects, then try taking it in a 
    public place.  Always have someone around who is willing to act as 
    a point of reference for you, someone who will support you if you
    suddenyl get uncomfortable.

A lot of empirical evidence suggests otherwise.  If drugs were legal, and 
regulated by the government or some other institution (like all legal 
drugs and food are these days), you would see:

	1) Quality control.  A large body of evidence suggests that
"drug-related deaths" are caused by pollutants in the chemicals. You would
know that when you're taking one 100mg MDMA caplets you really are getting
100mg, and not 20mg with 80mg MDA, and not 300mg MDMA. 

	2) Real drug information.  People are used to the concept of an 
acceptible blood alcohol levels, and the thought of personally acceptible 
doses of MDMA or LSD would also come about.  

	3) Lower prices.  Even if the government were to levy 1000% 
surcharges on their manufacture, it would be cheaper than buying on the 
street.

The "drug problem" is a health problem, not a legal problem, and should 
be treated as such.

Yes, but I've also seen people's lives destroyed by alcohol, by watching TV,
by junk food, by stress, by money, by just about every single pleasure-giving
instrument out there.  Addiction is a problem in general, and it very rarely
is a biochemical response to the object addicted to.

I've been going to raves "out here in Cali" for about 6 years now, I've 
seen a *lot* of stuff both heavily positive and heavily negative, and for 
anyone to say "it's all about drugs" is like me saying Detroit is "all

Because some of us like to ROLL A BIG FATTY AND SMOKE IT while we're 
grooving to that music, and there's no one who's going to tell us that's 
"wrong".  I'm all for kicking the drug dealers out, as long as they are 
replaced with the local Safeway clerk. :)

I'm curious as to why, promoters of legit parties don't have a location
finalized until just hours before a party. Is this because club owners
don't guarantee a space, or do promoters get a better price if they wait
till the last minute to make a deal, or are they actually still looking
till the last minute? I can understand promoters not anouncing the location
until a few hours before the party, but anouncing one location and then not
changing the message until just a few hours before the party seems a little
unfair.

Specifically, anyone know what happened in the case of Wicked last weekend?

Thanks,

Yes, it kinda makes you wonder if it's possible to duplicate the experience
without any help......  Think of it this way.  Before you had the
experience, you didn't even know it was possible......  Your mind is larger
now because you know it's possible (no matter what it takes to get there).
Knowing something is possible is the first step in achieving it on your own.
MDMA gives you a glimps of what things can really be like.  The next step is
for you to carry that vision out into the mainstream of your life.  You have
to work!!!!  You are capable of creating experiences all by yourself, you
just have to believe it.  Your mind is more powerful than any drug on the
market, USE IT.

Peace!

Rick

I have wondered about this, too.  Maybe it's because they want to keep that
"underground" feel to it even though it is being held at a "legal" venue.  
OR, maybe they don't want to scare people away because it is at a poor location 
(bad venue or inconvenient location).  For example, I really wanted to go to 
Ex Why Zzz but when I found it was in the east bay, I said forget it.  That 
left me scrambling for other options.  It kind of pissed me off because I 
really had my heart set on going.  Glad I didn't by advance tix!!!  :>)

Another problem with the last minute announcement is that the promoters are so
busy putting on the final touches to the party, they either forget to update the
message, give the wrong directions, or give general directions but forget to give 
the street address.  Each of these things has happened over the last couple of
months (at least once) for events listed in the SFR calendar.  For example, I
spent 30 minutes looking around 3rd and Army St for Mission.  I knew Mission was 
the other way but I thought maybe they meant Missouri or Mississippi.   Finally,
I dumped their "directions" and found it on my own.  When I mentioned it to the
people at the event they said "Duh, we don't know anything about it."  Actually,
the didn't even know the name of the party (so much for the hired help) so that I
could verify that I was in the right place (they had the address wrong, too).

Just my $.02 but could all you promoters out there be kind and tell us the
location as soon as possible.

I may have seen different stuff, but what I saw being sold as illusion 
was a blotter.  2CB is usually a 18-20mg dose, MDMA is around 120mg, 
crystal I'm not sure of, but I know you can't disolve a line onto a small 
blotter.  This doesn't offer much help as to what the stuff was, but you 
can rule out all these powdered drugs.  (Unless of course what I saw was 
not the "real illusion")

Hope this helps

Also, if drugs were legal, there would be a reduction in drug-related crimes
(manufacturing, trafficking, turf protection, etc.).  Organized crime really 
came into its own (i.e., financed itself for further expansion) with the 
prohibition on alcohol.  Before the prohibition crimes were mostly perpetrated 
by small time, lone operators.  During the prohibition enterprising crooks took 
advantage of the government's (and the population's) narrow mindedness to 
organize themselves into big money operations.  Then they laundered the money 
through legal business (usually cash oriented businesses such as restaurants, 
cleaners, etc.).  The drug cartels work the same way.  Legalization, like that 
of alcohol or cigarettes, would ensure, as Brian points out, consistent quality, 
safe distribution outlets (e.g., Safeway and Walgreens), variety (would you like
the mint or bubble gum flavored???), lower prices, and it make the world just a 
little bit safer.

I went to Pure Space last night.  Other than running into a couple of
friends from Santa Cruz (always a pleasure), it was pretty dull.  I'm
guessing I missed Garth and that Tony Fader just wasn't doing it for me.

Leaving the club some perky fellow (whose name I now forget) told my
friend and I about a "party with Thomas" over at the oddball on Minna.
I really like this little club space.  It is intimate and has a very
refined, lounge-like, sophisticated feel to it.

Approaching the place we could hear Hair screeching banshee style out 
into the street.  Someone put a few couches on the sidewalk.  It was a
small free party with an older, very hip, _very_ good looking crowd. 
Couldn't say if Thomas was spinning but it seemed in the realm of
stuff he would play.  The music was eclectic with crazy funk, sick 
hiphop, and the tweakiest House you'll ever hear.  I absolutely
loved it.  I even liked the video stuff they were playing.
This lands in the nicest parties ever category.

Hi everyone!

One other thing that I forget to say before...

Let's not kid ourselves about the affects of drug use.
Legal or not, people will still die from using drugs
just as people die from using alcohol or cigarettes.

Please let's not argue over cancer vs. accidental death
from using alcohol.  The result is the same.  People
(purposely or inadvertently) do die because they (or
others) don't behave responsibly when use intoxicants.  
Afterall, how many of you read and fully abide by the 
directions when you use over the counter drug.  I sure 
don't.  When I have a painful headache, I take 1500mg 
of Tylenol (even though it says take only 1000mg at 
the most).  How many of you have driven after having a 
few drinks, even though you knew it was not the right 
thing to do?  I've done it (and I am definitely not

Legalization is not necessarily the panacea that we think 
it is.  It will solve some problems but it will also 
create others.  We need to keep this in mind as we move
forward.

I guess it's alright to plug things here on sfr, so here I go.  My friend 
Gerlando has just recently started a design company called Inneraction.  
He's making shirts, tape sleeves, and hopefully in the future flyers.  
Just recently he came out with his first t-shirt and it's really cool.  
It's full color amazingly fresh graphics.  I'm gonna be selling them for 
him at Green Acres this weekend so if anyone izz interested in buying one 
or even just checking them out to give some feedback ask me there. 
Otherwise you can e-mail me or call Inneraction voicemail @ 
408-788-8540.  In my opinion this design is really good, but this iz only 
his first design so he would really like to know what people think, so 
even if ya don't wanna buy one come ask to see one anyways
laters!!

Uhhh... I once had a thought. Huh huh... Huhuhuh.

I suggest finding a girl (not a woman -- this is important), then both
of you need to get real loaded, preferably on Jack Daniels, then do a
12 pack of cheap beer in a beer bong. Finally, both of you need to
whiffle up a huge rail of Ketamine, Heroin, or drano... then when
you're both nearly ready to puke or pass out, kiss as passionately as
you can, while trying to not vomit all over each other.

After that, regular sober kissing should seem like heaven, and you'll
find yourself feeling this incredible joyful feeling each and every
time you kiss sober. In fact, you may feel like this even when you're
kissing your grandma.

Ok , so we all know that the Orb put on a great show,

show, but unfortunately BASS doesn't seem to think this way.
If ANYONE has tix for the 16th of June at the Warfield please
post Where you got them from.
I'd love to go to SAC to see that show, but unfortunately i don't have
a ride....well, maybe i could bum one...:)

I hope there is really an SF show  (pray)

Why is this tacky. Everyone on this mail list has been asking questions and discussing ecstasy. I happen to 
have the best information on the subject. I speak all the time, I spoke the weekend before last with Timohty 
Leary at the Whole Life Expo.  This is a public service.  I don't consider it tacky.

ah, yes, i remember my first months raving in brighton, england, where 
there's scarcely anything open all night - just the 7-11 and a strange 
"diner" with pretty poor french fries and unidentifiable fried black 
lumpy things (sausages, actually)...interesting place to wind up fried 
after a party... 

my favorite morning ritual, tho', was an egg and cress sandwich and a 
cadbury chocolately milk drink...sometimes i'd get this weird lemon-lime 
soda, too, with lots of sugar, which would make me giggle like crazy for 
hours...

Actually Wired Magazine donated the server for Hyperreal and Brian is an employee of wired which also puts 
up Hotwired.com and Wired.com. That costs the company a lot but Brian nothing. People have to make a 
living. I make a living off of selling software with my company, Mind Media., not talking about MDMA. That's a 
hobby.  The meeting is actually to benifit the Hemporium Bookstore, which I admire for carrying the widest 
range of books on pharmaceuticals available.  The $2 goes to them. I only get money from selling my book to 
the bookstore and that probably won't be more than $50 and I have to drive all the way to Hayward from Santa 
Cruz, almost 80 miles and spend the day there.  Well there are easier ways to make money.  Wired has heavy 
industry investment, so I don't worry about your youthfully idealistic critiques.  I hardly make enough to live so I 
don't think of myself as one of the upper class 
By the way, to the rest of you, I've gotten a lot of postive e-mal from those who I've seen at many raves and SF 
Raves events, and it is way cool to be finally getting to see first hand what people told me about Sf Raves. 
Until I got my e-mail program to route messages into folders, I was always afraid of getting too much mail.  My 
folder fills up fast.  And it seems that a lot of basic people deal with here is the nature of the ritual called the 
rave, and also the pharmacology of consciousness -- so I'm glad to be here. Talk to you!

Actually, I really think that we would be a lot better off if people like you
would stop trying to make a buck(or in your case $2) off of people like me. 
I am quite capable of gathering information on MDMA without any aid from 
you. You don't know me, so how the hell do you purport knowledge of what 
I would know without people like you? I have never read your book. I 
don't know if it is great, passable, or a load of crap. I make no claims 
to such knowledge. However, I do object to someone peddling freely 
available information on such an important issue in a forum such as SF 
Raves. If you are an "expert", and wanted to offer a "public service" why 
not do your talk for free? That would be a public service. Hyperreal.com 
is a public service. Brian carries SF Raves, information from numerous 
sources on various substances(MDMA being one), as well as a few misc. 
items. I have as of yet never heard an ad from him seeking money for what 
he does. What you offer is a product. Your product is knowledge. 
Knowledge which is available at no cost.

This relates to both messages but the info on hyperreal.com is not free 
to the person providing it.  I don't think Brian pays for it all 
himself you know...there are a lot of people who contribute time and 
money to hyperreal.com, hardware isnt free.  You may have a problem with 
Bruce telling us he is having a booksigning/question & answer session but 
$2 is a lot cheaper than some of the $20 raves which are advertised on 
hyperreal.com.  In light of the recent discussion when you call what he 
is offering a product than about half the raves on the weekly list should 
be stricken as well as all the weekly club nights.  Other than Sunset 
I dont know of any weeklies that arent put on to pay the rent for someone 
(which isnt necessarily wrong but thats another discussion).  I think its 
perfectly acceptable for you to be posting your message Bruce as long as 
it stays like a public announcement, which it did and not an 
advertisement which is more than I can say for some of the things that 
we've seen on this list, like multiple postings of a party and such.

Since Bruce decided to make my PRIVATE message to him public, I feel I 
need to explain my response. I misspoke when I spoke of Brian exclusivly 
providing the hardware and link. Point is that I view hyperreal.com as a 
public service, as I receive the services it offers free of charge. Second, 
nowhere in his original message did Bruce mention that what he was doing 
was a benefit. What I got from the original message was " Hey if you want 
to listen to me talk, or ask me questions about MDMA, you can do so for 
$2 at such-and-such location. I know more than anyone about the subject."
If he had mentioned the fact this was a benefit, this thread wouldn't 
exist. 

Finally, I see no conflict in bitching about someone advertising what I 
believed to be a self-serving "public service" vs. someone advertising a 
party. In my opinion, and hopefully not mine alone, anyone charging 
someone for freely available information in a setting such as SFRaves is 
reprehensible. To me, charging you for information about MDMA would be like
me charging you for info about when and where a party was. I wouldn't do 
that to a friend, and wouldn't expect any of my friends to do it to me. 
An event is a totatlly different animal. If anyone needs any more 
clarification on this please send me e-mail, rather than clutter this 
listserv with what should have been a private discussion.....

Black Adder (P. Greenwell) re. Bruce Eisner's book/talk/shinding...
> Your product is knowledge. 
> Knowledge which is available at no cost. 

Not!

Knowledge always costs money and/or time and perseverence to obtain.
Since time is money ( :-) ) I'd venture to say that knowledge is never
gained for "free" . So to say "no cost" seems pretty inapproriate (and
a tad disrespectful of Bruce and his considerable eXperience in the
subject).

The subject of Bruce's talk is germane to this list and certainly
pertinent to ravers, even if I  disagree w/ the overall sentiment that
X is some kind of wonder drug that you can pop as often as you pop
aspirin, with fewer ill effects, etc. Yes, I can clearly see a role for
it in therapy, marriage counseling, etc, and I certainly can't deny
that it might be good for blowing out the emotional tubes once in a
while (like maybe twice a year at best) but as something you can take
once a week w/o suffering any ill effects --- that's ridiculous.

			"So then I gave her some X and she got all
			 lovey-dovey then we both got on top of her..."
				-- Something I overheard a vendor once say...

PS: Bruce, why do you have two different last names??? It's confusing.

Well you are right about all of the above, but it just kinda sounded

I'm not saying that 'doin drugs' is going to kill us all, especially making
it legal.  I am saying that I wouldn't feel safe driving down the road
knowing that people traveling towards me at 60 mph could be legally
intoxicated on acid or somethin'.  Don't get me wrong, I have done my fair
share of psych-e-dilya, am-feta-meenes, depressants,  whatever!!   But I
don't think that the masses are ready for legal all that shit to be legal.
(pot maybe)
I remember sneaking shit (liqour) out of my parents's stash when I was real
young.  I would hate to see my kid find my LSD Stash...

and how 'bout controlling these substances?  Good luck.

Actually, if If we had a choice- MDMA should be legal instead of alcohol.

This reminds me:  I recall someone telling me last month that MDMA was
legal somewhere for awhile?  I quickly reminded him (or her) that not too
long ago, black people had to sit at the back of busses...

That's the only thing (drugs) people talk about on this mailing list (most
of the time).  Even on 'VRAVE'?  Rarely do I ever hear someone talking
about trax and artists.  But I guess, most places are like this and I'm
another straight edge>> X Druggie (aka Hipocrate)

Detroit is 'all about cars' :)  And Ohio is 'all about cows'  And Chicago

Never said there was anything wrong with BIG FATTIES, but I guess I'm just

What about the big picture?  Millions of people legally tripping?  just
that thought alone scares me.  Maybe you guys can handle your trips, but in
most cases- people cannot control themselves and act irresponsibly.  You
guys are probably educated- middle class - mature - and can control your
trips quite well?  What about all of those assholes who act irresponsibly
and fuck with people just being drunk?  Or even people who aren't even a
threat to society?

We cannot teach children (and adults) to have sex properly!? what makes you
think people will TRIP responsibly?  You guys seem to forget about the rest
of America.  90% of it doesn't look at the world like a raver.  I am not a
hardcore straight-edge person; I don't freak out on people who do drugs,
nor do I prevent myself from meeting them or hanging with them.  I just
think that the US is nor ready for (legalized halucinogens)

Leagalized drugs would be easier for children to obtain.  I don't think
this is too safe- Do you?  How much research has been done on kids w/ E, or
acid?  What are the effects?   I don't know the answers, but common sense
tells me that's kinda bad.

	Hi, I would like to ask you to reconsider some of your points. I 
don't really want to debate because I don't feel like compiling any HARD 
evidence...( time=3:30am PS) if anyone has any statistics post it, or i'll 
do it later :)

	ok, we need to look places in the world where drugs are 
semi-legal like Holland. Check out the Frankfurt Agreement where some 20+ 
European cities signed a declaration booing the WAr on Drugs. Italy 
reversed its liberal practices toward drugs and found a sharp increase in 
crime. Germany legalized pot in small quantities. 
	Most advocates of legalization want an age 21 stipulation like 
alcohol. People will be irresponsible (I gather) but with luck they 
won't be shooting at each other at the same time.

	I think it is, actually. I wish I had them, but the percentage of 
people in jail in California for Drug, and interestingly Marijuana 
related crimes is quite high (The Examiner section on pot a few months 
ago). How high? // begin bad pun routine (hehe)... It cost lots of money 
to keep these people jailed. Oh yah, 
	Drug laws have brought about Civil Asset Forfeiture, the police 
can take your property (estate/monies etc) if you are SUSPECTED of a drug 
related crime. see ftp.hyperreal.com under /drugs/politics/civil asset 
forfeiture...

	See above. Also I find this kind of funny cause when I was under 
age I would always laugh at the government (and do illegal drugs) cause I 
didn't need an ID to get them. I ended up smoking more pot than drinking 
for this reason. Ok, so that's anecdotal evidence. I would contend that 
the war on drugs in facts creates the very availability we wish to avoid. 
Higher prices make people want to sell it on the street. 

	So that's it. I thin argument I know, but worthy of some thought 
I hope. I'll try to find some more hard info. It's all out there 
somewhere, some of it on the net. Check out 
ftp.hyperreal.com/drugs/politics/ it has some good stuff on it, though 
its a bit dated unfortunately. Any links (what read the paper? go the 
library?!?!?!) for recent info on this topic would be cool...

Why is it when drug "conservatives" talk about drug "legalization" they
immediately begin to talk about how easy it would be for children and
irresponsible people to get them?

It's been my impression that it ALREADY is easy for these groups to get
these drugs. I suppose that there are people that want to imagine that
it is hard - but most people I talk with started drugging in their
early teens with no particular difficulties. What is HARD is to get "safe"
drugs ie ones that are what they claim to be and in the correct dosages...
If 13 year olds are going to do drugs anyway why can't they at least get
"clean and safely dosed drugs" ?

Recently, there was a "sweep" of grade school lockers in Foster City and
the authorities were SHOCKED to find more than a few lockers with inhalant
bottles of dangerous solvents etc. that the kids were inhaling to get high.
The human "need" to feel good and get high is both strong and universal -
in both young and old - so why do we continue to deny and think that if we
make it illegal and refuse to educate on it - it will simply go away and
cease to be a problem ?

Boy -  are we dumb or what ?

I work in a psychiatric hospitol where I see alot of use of legal 
medications, that for the most part is being used responsibly as a tool 
to help people.  Definitely not always, but alot of the time I see these 
medications as being very helpful.  Depending on the person it can be 
very clear, that some medications can help some where it might cause harm 
to another.
If some of the illegal drugs that are discussed on this list, were made 
legal at least (to start with) for more experimentation, we might be able to 
have more scientific evidence for who would benifit, and who wouldn't and what 
conditions for them to best be used.  
Think of all the additional education and research we could do if were 
able to take just a fraction of the money that the goverment spends on 
the "war against drugs".
People might choose to not do these drugs if they knew more about it, or 
then again they might want to do it more, but will at  least they would know 
better what conditions they would be better off doing them.

In the greater sense of the concept I agree with you. However, there is a 
ton of information about the subject available at no charge to anyone. 
That is what I am talking about. Not knowledge as a broad concept.

Yes, and mixing drugs or drugs and alcohol can have unpredictble results.

X was legal at one time and used extensively for psychotherapy.  For some 
reason, and I am not sure why (maybe adverse affects, maybe better drugs,
maybe a change in psychotheraputic practices?), they discontinued its use
and made it illegal.

In the perfect world, the drug companies are suppose to run trials that
will determine the goodness and badness of the drugs.  Unfortunately,
most of the time the tests are incomplete, run by incompetents, or the
results are not fully disclosed. The FDA does not necessarily do it
complete due dilligence and the drug gets approved.  There's a tremendous
amount of politics and influence pedaling (read as lobbying) that goes on 
behind the scenes.  But this is not limited to the drug industry of course.

>People might choose to not do these drugs if they knew more about it, or

Somehow, I am very cynical about human nature in this respect.  Consider
that people smoke those awful cigarettes that are killing them (and me
through second hand smoke).  They know the affects and yet theystill do
it.  Out of habit (addiction) or for the "high."   It really doesn't matter
why.  They still do it.  So whether drugs have bad affects along with the
good, people will still use them.  They'll still suffer.  It's sort of like
surfing in shark infested water; you know there's a chance you'll get munched
but the thrill of surfing is overwhelming.

Finally, as for 13 year olds running around using drugs when they are
legalized...  I think you have that today.  Even elementary school students 
are using drugs, smoke cigarettes, drink, and carry guns.  That is a reality 
of our modern society.  Legalizing may have an impact on this as the playground
dealer will be eliminated by general availability.  But then again, we won't
know until we do it will we!?!?!?  I'm not exactly sure what the answer.  I
can tell you that trying to solve problem on the supply side is like putting
your finger in the dyke.  We need to address the problem at the demand side
to be successful.  Once we understand why people are turning to drugs (many
reasons I know), we can use the money once spent on interdication and law
enforcement more productively to achieve real results.

Bradley

P.S.  BTW, I don't personally use illicit drugs.  Maybe they are great and
      maybe the create an experience unlike anything else, but many of the 
      points discussed in the thread about responsible chemistry and MDMA
      are exactly the reason why I don't.  Net:  to much uncertainty and
      risk.  My philosophy has always been "better to be a live chicken 
      than a dead duck."  I still have a pretty good life, too.

CyberWire Dispatch // Copyright (c) 1995 //

Jacking in from the "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" Port:

Washington, D.C. -- The Internet had its head placed on the chopping block
during a Congressional hearing today (May 11th).  

Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) put it there.  Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.) tied its
hands, while Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) welded the axe. 

Specter, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and
Government Information, called the hearing to investigate "The Availability
of Bomb Making Information on the Internet."  The hearing focused on "the
use of the Internet by a variety of groups and individuals to propagate
'mayhem manuals,' which as their name suggests, are guides to assist people
in committing acts of violence," Specter said.  

Specter didn't mince words about his intentions.  The subtext of the
hearing was that the Internet, somehow, now represents a "clear and present
danger" to the American way of life, threatening innocent citizens and
children.  "There are serious questions about whether it is technologically
feasible to restrict access to the Internet or to censor certain messages,"
Specter said.

Feinstein rode into the hearing with blinders on.  "I have a problem with
people teaching others" how to build bombs that kill, she said.  The First
Amendment doesn't extend to the that kind of information, she said,
especially when it resides in electronic format so easily available.  

Her remarks were directed at a panel of experts who had, for the most part,
acknowledged that such information was readily available on the Net,
but nonetheless was indeed protected by the First Amendment. 

The First Amendment argument didn't fly with Feinstein, who railed at the
panel's testimony.  "You really have my dander up," she said.  "This is not
what this country is about."

That remark drew a sharp response from Jerry Berman, executive director of
the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology: "Excuse me,
Senator, but that *is* what this nation is all about."   

Feinstein would hear nothing of it.  "I believe there is a difference
between free speech and teaching someone to kill," she said,  "And all
we're doing here is protecting [terrorist information] under the mantle of
free speech."

Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, one of America's most liberal
cities, carried a lot of baggage into the hearing;  she was once the failed
target of a letter bomb addressed to her office while mayor, according to a
Subcommittee staffer.

Sen. Kohl waded into the hearing reading from a tired script,
saying that America would "be shocked" if they knew about "dark back
alleys" of the "information superhighway."   Kohl paid lip-service to the
Constitution, saying that government shouldn't "be in the business of
telling people what they can and cannot think."  However, that didn't stop
him from suggesting that government has every right to "prevent people from
endangering public safety," which really means restricting access --
somehow -- to the "dangerous" (ooohhh....) "dark back alleys" of the
Internet.

His suggestions:  (1) Parents should be notified every time their kids get
an online account.  (2) Every parent should be able to block a kid's access
to whatever areas they want.  "If we have the technology to get kids on the
Internet, we should have the technology to get them off it," he said.  (3)
Online companies should rip out a page from the video game industry, where
"industry-wide cooperation to restrict access to minors has forestalled
government intervention," he said.

The vid-game industry, right, those cozy folks that bring Mortal Kombat
into your living room and shopping malls, where even 8-year olds know how
to punch in the infamous "blood codes"  which, when enabled, show defeated
characters being gutted while still alive, leaving the screen oozing.  And
this is the same video industry which drew a sharp rebuke from Sen. Specter
himself last December when he found out that the so-called "industry-wide
cooperation" to label games with "ratings" wasn't being implemented on
anything more than a piecemeal basis. 

Fueling this hysteria-circus was Robert Litt, deputy assistant attorney
general, Criminal Div. of the Department of Justice.  Litt mouthed to the
Subcommittee  what will certainly become the "Scare Monger's Anthem":  "Not
only do would-be terrorists have access to detailed information on how to
construct explosives, but so do children."

.. And so do children...

"This problem can only grow worse as more families join the Internet
'society,'" Litt warned.   .

"... And so do children..."

But does any of this so-called terrorist information require any kind of
congressional Constitutional tweaking?  Not according to Litt's own
testimony.  There are, on the books now, "a number of federal laws" that
can be used to "prosecute bomb-related offenses," and those can be directly
transferred to any such investigations linked to the Internet, Litt
testified, adding that such laws "can be applied even when the offense is
accomplished through speech."

Read it again:  "[A]pplied even... through speech."  If that was the sound
of a hammer falling -- or an axe -- you're right.

Litt outlined how current laws protect even bomb making materials on the
Internet as expressions of free speech;  however, he noted, with some glee,
that the proposals before Congress right now, offered up by the White
House, will "permit the government to better track and prosecute those who
misuse information available on the Internet...."

The hysteria of these doomsayers, however, ran into an unexpected brick
wall during the hearing.  Sen. Specter asked Litt point-blank if he had
*any* kind of statistics or "direct knowledge" of any "criminal act" that
had resulted from anyone obtaining information off the Internet.  "No
Senator, we do not," Litt answered somewhat shyly.  Specter reframed the
question -- twice -- giving Litt a chance to weasel an answer, but there
was no weasel room.  

The cold, hard facts are and remain:  No law enforcement agency has been
able to link any criminal act to any information now residing on the
Internet.

But this wasn't good enough for Specter, who asked Litt to go back and
"investigate" the question and report his findings back to the
Subcommittee.

Another blow to Internet foes was the testimony of Frank Tuerkheimer. 
Tuerkheimer, a professor of law at the U. of Wisconsin, made his fame in
the 1970s as the U.S. Attorney which successfully argued to stop the
publication of the "How to Make an H-Bomb" article in the _Progressive_
magazine.  He won that case, which he admitted today, he had little
enthusiasm for trying because the information in the article was gathered
from public domain sources. However, all of that effort was moot point, he
noted:  Some other publication printed the article anyway.

Information will find a way to get out, Tuerkheimer said.  "We're not
talking about regulating information," he said, "we're talking about
regulating 'information-plus."  That's when the information is taken and
used in the commission of a criminal act, and it's that combination that
needs to be addressed, not the information, he said.

Putting a fine point on his arguments, Tuerkheimer noted in his
testimony that the Encyclopedia Britannica "reveals great detail on
explosive manufacture."  [It's all right there on on pages 275-282 of Vol.
21 of the 1986 edition.]   Adding insult to injury, he pointed out that on
page 279 of that section, there is a description of the Ammonium
Nitrate/Fuel oil mixture bomb like that used in the Oklahoma City bombing! 

I wonder, now, if Sen. Feinstein will rush to outlaw the encyclopedia... or
maybe she'll introduce a bill that will have librarians issued X-acto
knives to cut out just those pages. "...so the children" won't have
access....

Perhaps Tuerkheimer's finest blow was when he noted that the Department of
Agriculture Forestry Service publishes the "Blaster's Handbook" (written
with taxpayer money) that also includes a recipe for the Ammonium
Nitrate/Fuel oil bomb like that used to blow little kids into chunks in the
Oklahoma City bombing.  

America's online sweetheart, America Online, was represented ably by
William Burrington.  He admitted to the Subcommittee that although his
company monitored "selected areas" for violations of the company's terms of
service, there was no possible to keep an eye on every public message.  The
point he hammered on -- and rightly so -- is that the "information ocean"
that is the Internet is impossible to place restrictions on "because of its
international nature," he said, more than once.  Any laws the U.S. might
try to apply don't mean shit internationally, as Burrington tried to point
out, a point that apparently fell on deaf ears.

One pair of ears that didn't fail to hear were those of Sen. Patrick Leahy
(D-Vermont).  This old warhorse continued to be what increasingly sounds
like the only voice of reason on Capitol Hill.  "Before we head down a road
that leads to censorship," he said, "we must think long and hard about its
consequences."  

Leahy is bothered about "tragic events" such as the Oklahoma bombing as
much as anyone, he said.  However, the "same First Amendment that protects
each of us and our right to think and speak as we choose, protects others
as well," he said.  It is "harmful and dangerous *conduct*, not speech,
that justify adverse legal consequences," Leahy noted.

There is "little to be gained in the way of safety by banning" access to
so-called terrorist information "over electronic media," Leahy said,
especially when it's so readily available in paper form... even from the
Agriculture Department.  Hell, there's probably even an government
sponsored 800 number you can call to order the "Blaster's Handbook."  

In one lengthy discussion, Specter cited an Internet posting in which the
poster asked for bomb making information that he (or she, gender wasn't
noted) could use against "zionist government officials."  Specter asked the
panel if such a message could be considered a crime.

"No," said the Justice Department's Litt.  "But what about the response to
the
message?" Specter asked.  Such a response "approaches, if it hasn't already
crossed the line, a prosecutorial offense," Litt said.

Tuerkheimer disagreed.  "Too general," he said.  There's "no
target" identified, "it's hard to see how the Justice Department could
prosecute" the responder to that message, he said.  

Of course, Specter's query begs the question:  Would it be a crime to
respond to the "bomb information wanted" message by sending them a copy of
the taxpayer funded, government-sponsored "Blaster's Handbook"?  You make
the call, because if you don't, Congress will. 

"In other words, the industry acts now or Congress will do it for you," Kohl
said.  

I doubt he was joking.

Meeks out...

Again, please accept my apologies if you already get this.  Take care
though we may soon have to watch what we say on SFR.  Just joking...

I heard this week that someone put the whole clipper chip encryption 
scheme on the internet.  Anyone hear about this???

Jacking in from the Narco-Terrorist Encryption Port:

Washington, DC --  The other shoe has dropped.  Several times.

In the political backlash and emotional fallout of the bombing of of the
federal building in Oklahoma City, FBI Director Louis Freeh has begun to
wage his own private war on the use of private, encryption schemes.

According to Administration sources, several different proposals are now
being discussed on how to implement a policy of government mandated,
government "certified" encryption.  The most hardline of these proposals
would outlaw the public's ability to choose an encryption scheme which the
government couldn't break, under the authority of a court order.

Freeh has left no doubts about his intentions.  Not satisfied with a
proposal he successfully rammed through Congress last year -- the bill that
gives law enforcement agencies "easy wiretap access" to digital
conversations, at a cost of $500 million in taxpayer money -- his next
target is private encryption.

During an appropriations hearing May 11th, Freeh told a congressional
panel: "[W]e're in favor of strong encryption, robust encryption.  The
country needs it, industry needs it.  We just want to make sure we have a
trap door and key under some judge's authority where we can get there if
somebody is planning a crime."

That means an end to private, non-government encryption, which don't have
keys the government can use.  

Private encryption schemes allow a person to scramble an electronic message
that, if intercepted by an unintended party, renders it unreadable.  These
scrambling programs are useful from to a wide range of people and
interests, including researchers that want to keep their proprietary
breakthroughs safe from prying eyes to corporations sending trade secrets
to a distant office across the Net to ordinary folks sending a steamy love
letter to a lover.  

But these same encryption programs are being used by "terrorists and
international drug traffickers," as well, claims FBI Director Freeh, and
that makes private encryption schemes a threat to national security.

Freeh's crusade against encryption has been enjoined by members of the
Justice Department, with the gleeful back alley goading the nation's top
spook group, the National Security Agency.

And when it comes right down to it, your privacy rights don't stand a
snowball's chance in hell of outweighing pictures of dead babies or pieces
of dead babies.

During an April 27th Senate Judiciary Committee on terrorism, Freeh boldly
told a panel of lawmakers eager to give his agency more latitude to "catch
the bad guys" (and civil rights violations be damned... as long as we don't
have to watch the guts of little kids being splattered on steel girders and
broken concrete...): "The FBI cannot and should not tolerate any
individuals or groups... which would kill innocent Americans, which would
kill *'America's kids.'*"

To meet the "challenges of terrorism," Freeh said, several things must be
done, among them, deal with "encryption capabilities available to criminals
and terrorists" because such technology endangers "the future usefulness of
court-authorized wiretaps.  This problem must be resolved."

While Freeh used the Oklahoma City bombing as convenient "news hook" to
again make a pitch to "resolve" the private encryption "problem," the
Director was basically reading from a dog-eared script.  Within the last 3
months he repeatedly has testified publicly before Congress about the
"evils" of encryption.

On March 30 the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime he said: 
"Even though access is all but assured [by the passage of the Digital
Wiretap Act] an even more difficult problem with court-authorized wiretaps
looms. Powerful encryption is becoming commonplace.  The drug cartels are
buying sophisticated communications equipment.... This, as much as any
issue, jeopardizes the public safety and national security of this country.
 Drug cartels, terrorists, and kidnappers will use telephones and other
communications media with impunity knowing that their conversations are
immune from our most valued investigative technique."
 
 Then during a May 3 appearance before the same Committee, Freeh said:
 "Encryption capabilities available to criminals and terrorists, both now
and in days to come, must be dealt with promptly.  We will not have an
effective counterterrorism counterterrorism strategy if we do not
solve the problem of encryption."

But there's nothing to be alarmed at here, according to Freeh.  Just
because he's asking the Congress and the White House to strip you of the
right to choose how you scramble your messages, using a program that the
government doesn't hold all the keys too, doesn't mean that the Director
isn't a sensitive guy or that he has suddenly taken a liking to wearing
jackboots.  

Freeh steadfastly maintains all these new powers he's asking for are simply
"tools" and "not new authorities."  These new powers are "well within the
Constitution," Freeh told Congress.  

Freeh hasn't publicly outlined just how he proposes to "resolve" the
"encryption problem."  However, according to an FBI source, several plans
are in the works.  The source refused to detail any specific plan, but
added:  "Let's just say everything is on the table."  Does that include
outlawing private encryption schemes?  "I said 'everything,'" the source
said.

The encryption debate has been raging for years.  Two years ago the Clinton
Administration unveiled a new policy in which it proposed to flood the
market with its own home-grown encryption devices -- a product of the
National Security Agency -- called the "Clipper Chip."  

The Clipper is based on a "key-escrow" system.  Two government agencies
would hold the keys "in escrow", which are uique to each chip, in a kind
of "data vault."  Any time the FBI-- or your local sheriff -- wanted to tap
your phone conversations, they would have to ask a judge to give the two
government agencies to turn over the keys to you Clipper chip.  With those
keys, the FBI could then unscramble any of your conversations at will.

That policy raised a huge firestorm of controversy and the Clipper sunk
from sight, down, but not out.  The intent of the White House, acting as a
front man for the NSA and other intelligence agencies along with the FBI,
was to have Americans adopt Clipper voluntarily.  The FBI took it on good
faith -- and I'm not joking here -- that criminals, too, would buy Clipper
equipped phones, allowing the government to easily unscramble their
wiretapped conversations.

Why would criminals knowingly use a device they knew the government could
easily tap?  "Because criminals are stupid," was the FBI's party line.  No,
I'm not making this up.

The "voluntary" aspect didn't stop the controversy.  Indeed, buried in the
Administration's own background briefing papers on the Clipper was the no
nonsense statement that the Administration, after reviewing the
Constitution, had determined that "American's have no Constitutional right
to choose their own method of encryption."  Call it a peremptory strike on
privacy.

The  end of freely chosen encryption comes as no surprise to Jim Dempsey,
currently the executive director of the Center for National Security
Studies.  Dempsey, you might remember, walked point for former Congressman
Don Edwards during last year's tussle over the FBI's Digital Wiretap access
bill.  Dempsey, in fact was one of the bill's principal authors. "I always
felt [the Administration] had to know they would ultimately go to [some
kind of government] mandatory encryption scheme," Dempsey said.  "I don't
think it's a big leap for the government to think of private encryption
like they do kiddie porn."

An NSA source, when questioned about his agency's role in the process, was
reluctant to speak.  He did say that Clipper was merely "Act One" of a
"Three part play."  Pressed for further details, he said, "do your own
homework."

During the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism hearing May 11, Robert Litt,
deputy assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of Justice,
said the "widespread use of reliable, strong encryption that allows
government access, with appropriate restrictions... is designed to achieve"
a "delicate balance" between privacy rights and law enforcement needs.  

When Dispatch asked Litt to elaborate, he said his comments refereed to the
use of the Clipper Chip.  But what if criminals bypass Clipper, using
private encryption schemes, such as those now being decried by Freeh?  "If
one solution doesn't work, then we have to go to the next step," he said. 
Is that next step the outlawing of private encryption?  Litt smiled and
repeated his answer.

Dispatch has learned that one proposal being seriously discussed would,
indeed, outlaw all private, non-government approved encryption schemes. 
Here's how the government plan breaks out, according to sources familiar
with the proposal:

(1)  The government would "certify" a few so-called "Commercial Key-Escrow"
programs.  These are similar in design to the government's Clipper Chip,
but industry would hold the keys and some of these systems might not be
classified, as is the software underlying Clipper.  However, the companies
producing such "certified" programs could claim trade secrets, not allowing
the public access the underlying programs.

(2)  The government, tossing a bone to industry, would lift export controls
on all "certified" encryption programs.  Currently, it's against the law to
export encryption programs, as they are controlled by the State Department
under the same classification as munitions.

(3)  The use of government certified encryption would become a federal
mandate, making it illegal to use private encryption schemes that had not
passed the "certification" test.

The plans are "still really liquid," said an Administration source.  "We
all know what a bitch this going to be trying to sell it to the selling
public," he said.  "The flashpoint potential of this idea isn't lost on
anyone."

The Administration is hoping the public will buy off on the fact that: (1) 
It's private industry holding the keys, not government agencies.  (2)  The
availability of "choice" amog several different vendors will squash the
imagery of Big Brother.  

Expect the rise of an off-shore, black market "encryption" trade.  It will
surely come.  And it will have to be a black market;  the FBI has already
gone around the world preaching the evils of private encryption, trying to
get other law enforcement groups to push for outlawing such programs in
their own countries.  And they already have a convert:  Russia.  That
country recently adopted such a policy... nice to know we're following in
Mr. Yeltsin's footsteps.

Meeks out...

First off: it's bad ettiquette to take (what I think is a) private
conversation back to the public forum.  Please check your mail headers before
adding in "sfraves@hyperreal.com" to make sure it was there first. 

Secondly: I think it's perfectly reasonable to charge for attendance to a 
lecture.

Thirdly: Wired Magazine did *not* donate the server for Hyperreal (I paid 
for it out of my own pocket and continue to pay for its upkeep, though 
occasionally we have fundraisers), nor am I any longer an employee of 
Wired/HotWired (though I am still in the same building, and the bandwidth 
is the same).  The bandwidth is now a donation from my company, Organic 
Online.  However, doing this should not mean that information should not 
and does not need to be paid for somehow.

hey everyone,

  i just wanted to add a little tidbit about flyers that pisses me
off also.  All they list is the party and info number consistently.

  they leave optional:  the dj's

and hardly ever include: the PRICE

sometimes even on the voice mail they dont even put the price on it.
now i think thats a scam and a shitty thing to do so that you wont 
factor in the cost until the last moment so you cant make alternative
plans to going to THAT party.

how lame.

  on the east coast they always have the price included on the flyer.
and from my experiences there the $20 you spend on a party is
ususally better then the $20 you spend here.  (except smarties and
digitaria :)

thank you Brian!

I think there is nothing more rude.
Although, it is understandable that this
will sometimes happen on accident or out of
naivete.

  Absolutely THE best place to be!

  Gatornet, the student internet users groups at SFSU, was founded by

SFSU (address: telnet or tf  baymoo.sfsu.edu 8888).
  Academic credit for raving?! Not quite; but Prof Chandler's "San

Gee, when I go over to my local public library and look up anything on
the subject, I don't see a single book about it.  Maybe that kind of
stuff will not be censored at a university library -- but it's rare to
be able to walk into a uni-library unless you're a student, and in case
you haven't noticed, even "public" colleges cost money and require
registration.

Oh, you mean there is information available "for free" on the internet.
Sorry, I think you don't understand -- nothing on the internet is free,
it has been supported in the past by DARPA/NSF money, a lot of the
infrastructure and software that people are using/selling was developed
on your tax dollar, and chances are, if you're connecting to the net
"on your own" you've got to blow at least $15.00 a month plus an
initial outlay of at $500-$1000.00 for equipment, and don't forget some
portion of a $9.00/month phone bill. People in college get free
accounts, but don't for a moment think they're really free -- its
either sponsored by your tuition or by tax support; people in hi-tech
jobs may get internet accounts as a perk, but don't think for a moment
that all that infrastructure is free -- it comes out of your salary.

To say nothing about the training/education/hairpulling that is
required to get a non-computer person to be able to set up a computer,
connect to a service provider, and figure out how to use these internet
resources (e.g. World Wide Web). That is typically not free either.

Furthermore, if you're talking about the "free" stuff available from
http://www.hyperreal.com/drugs -- remember that the internet
connectivity of that machine is being sponsored by Wired magazine.
Although the  costs of their inernet connectivity are amortized over
their whole HotWired site, if someone else were to attempt to put up a
site like that on their own funding, you can expect a multithousand
dollar initial outlay, plus a $1000-$3000 a month or so for a T1 (maybe
the T1 rate has dropped recently -- take these as a ballpark).

That ain't what I call "free".

> P.S. Respect is earned, not expected or demanded.

Given my past rants about PLUR, you might find it hard to believe that
I'm going to defend "R". IMHO, disrespect is earned, but you should
give everybody the benefit of the doubt first. Or would you prefer that
I disrespect you simply because I don't know you and I've never given
you the opportunity to "earn" respect? I never said anything about
expecting or demanding respect.

Um...I would have to disagree.  I think FIVE DOLLARS spent in
SF is better spent than $25 on the east coast.  

Except for maybe Baltimore at Sunday Mass.

For those of you that are wondering, our party, Green Acres, probably 
will not be outdoors tonight. Though the rain seems to have stopped up 
here, it will probably not stop for good and clear up. So we are 
currently negotiating an emergency indoor space. FYI: the party will 
either be in the Delta or up in Sacramento. If by some miracle all the 
clouds disappear, it will be in the Delta. Dj's are: Jeyson, Enzo, Trent, 
and Marcone. Price will be very low, under $5. We want the party to only 
cost $1 to cover the speaker rentals, but if we have to rent a warehouse 
for tonight it might be more. Directions and updates will be on the info 
numbers later: 415.267.3076 and 916.556.1028.

Actually I'm not really a drug conservative, but talking with Brian and
everyone one about this makes me out to look like one.  I definately agree
with you, and the more I think about it- I realize that you guys have alot
of good points.

anyway. I'm done with this thread..

Of course the info you have been referring to the whole time is on 
hyperreal.com which about at least 50% or more of ravers prolly cant get 
to yet because they dont have enough money or time to get hooked up to an 
online service.  A book or a talk may be a lot cheaper for some then 
going out and paying a thousand dollars for a computer so that they can 
access the *free* info on hyperreal.

=)

        I would agree with this need (gee wiz i'm sure we've all felt it)
but i'm not positive if it's either an essential human genetic trait or
some reaction to being forced to live in a society that values things more
than people, a society that distracts one from seeking 'higher' (though
maybe not absolute) truths in a spiritual/metaphysical sense, a society
that posits material wealth as being an end unto itself and even if one
DOES achieve this goal (and how many ppl do you know that are in this
position?) they are often left to find "something more" or some deeper sort
of meaning, a society that, in the process of trying to sell more product,
actively attempts to alienate people from each other and from themselves to
invoke a sense of worthlessness and spiritual impoverishment which can only
be quenched by buying a new VCR, a bigger TV, a new car..etc..and HEY, if
that impoverishment WAS actually quenched by buying something (and it never
is) the whole wheels of advanced capitalism would stop rollin'
        oh yeah, i forgot to add..IMHO ;)

Don't sweat it, Bruce.  Black Adder was posting from reflex, I think,
which is why I won't bother to flame him here.

We sometimes sardonically post things with the preface, BSP (short for
Bogus Self Promotion or something, I forget how that started).

The point is, this list exists to exchange information and views of its
members.  Nobody here has tried to use this as a commercial forum.
I *really* object to any effort to squelch the usefulness of this list
by riding some self-righteous hobby horse about "commercial" use.

The Net and this list exist to help people gain access to information
and share their views.  Any effort to the contrary, be it by Louis Freeh
and Senator Exon, or someone petulantly complaining about providing
pointers to valuable events and resources, is opposed to the free and
reasonable flow of information.

To follow Black Adder's supposed logic to its conclusion, we would not
even be able to announce a party organized by Friends & Family or any
other group composed in part of members of this list if we were even
to ask for $1 donations.

I'll leave it at that.  Let's move on.  And Bruce, thanks for joining
and I for one look forward to your continued participation.

see you in the future

What Jon's argument basically comes down to is that people can't be
trusted.  So let's not let them do mind-altering substances at all,
because sometimes they get themselves in trouble.

OK, if that's the logic you want, how about this?  Sex is prohibited,
alcohol consumption is prohibited, riding in motorized vehicles is
prohibited, *eating* is prohibited, because sometimes people do these
things recklessly and get hurt.

And I say, get *real*.  People have been doing mind-altering substances
for about as long as they have been having sex, raising kids, teaching,
eating, travelling and making art.  

I heartily recommend Andrew Weil's excellent article in the new issue
of The New Yorker about the use of coca leaves in indigenous South
American cultures, versus the development and abuse of cocaine, a
product of the same plant.  The questions, as always, relate to drug
*abuse* and abandonment of the storehouse of knowledge humans have
gained over the generations about their benefits and risks.

Prohibition never works and simply creates corruption.  Education and
taking care of each other are the approaches that work.  In this
benighted time when politicians and media figures will say *anything*
to support prohibition in search of a quick fix, we need to stand up
and call them on their abandonment of common sense and wisdom in
dealing with the human condition.

A beautiful woman recently told me that a man can give a kiss from three

I too had the opertunity to KISS some one the first time I did X (wink)

still had more meaning and always will.

If it's from your heart, It will be sexy no matter what state your in!

Then I suggest you go back to your public library and talk to your 
librarian about inter-library loans. Librarians are some of the nicest
people I know when it comes to helping you find information on any given
subject.
 And I have have had no problems walking into UC Davis or UCSF's 
libraries, running through MELVYL, and getting any information I might 
want on the subject, although of course I can't check out the books.

Most of the above costs, save the internet access are intangible. We are

This is the one area in which I was a bit hasty. I should have said 
Respect beyond what one would normally extend to another human being. I 
do believe in respecting your fellow human beings, but I don't subscibe 
to the sacred cow crap. Sorry if I question your idol, but he is yours, 
not mine. This whole pointless thread developed from a simple 
misunderstanding. Bruce and I have sent mail back and forth and we have 
corrected that misunderstanding. I would love nothing more than to just 
let this whole depressing, negative thread DROP....

Good point, although that is not the ONLY source of available info, but 
is a mighty handy collection of material. Also, the advertisement was on SF 
Raves, so if you were reading it, in 99% of the cases your point would be 
a moot one....

Not true at all. What I objected to was what I viewed as someone charging 
for information which is available all over the place for free(or for 
nothing more over what you are already paying in tax dollars or net 
access charges(Happy Niels? ) If someone got on here and started 
advertising a service that gave the numbers and locations of parties for 
a price(also freely available info through Sf-raves and Hyperreal(thank 
you Derek and all the contributors)) I would hope that I would not be the 
only one that would be upset. 
I wasn't objecting to the advertisement itself, but to the possiblity
that someone might think they would have to pay in order to get 
reliable information on the subject(Bruce failed to mention 
that this was a benefit.) I would like to think of Sf-Raves as a bunch of 
friends that I just haven't met in person(although at this rate I may not 
be doing myself any favors.) And so I got upset. And so I posted a 
private message to Bruce. And Bruce decieded to make the matter public. 
And you know what? The whole thing is utterly ridiculous considering that 
it seems that we both feel the same about access to information...
I hope that this clarifies the matter for once and all.

I am not for prohibition.. I just was arguing some points for the sake of
arguement. (hey bri)

I feel that anyone in the planet has the right to do *whatever* they want
to>  So long as they don't hurt anyone else in the process.

My philosophy is that simple.

My general attitude towards halucinogens these days stem from nasty
experiences I had in 92 and 93.  I was heavy into "E" and acid;  I had some
pretty bad trips.  Everyone has their own incredible trips>> somewhere down
the line- I lost it.  I remember the last time I tripped>  I was at Ritchie
Hawtins birthday party at a small house in Detroit. I was pretty messed up:
I left someone alone that I loved:  I freaked out:  I just couldn't handle
it.  Unlike most of you who seem to enjoy your trips, I rarely enjoyed
mine.

and that's why I get so cranky talkin' about it.

Time to go out ravin'..

I know this is kinda off the subject: but : I just bought a white labe that

Hi,
That white label is by Surreal Sheep and it is called Aural Experience, 
they have a full length lp out or coming out on SSR records.  In case 
your copy doesn't say the remixes on the 12" are by Wagon Christ and 
Mixmaster Morris.> 

Hope this helps,
Derek

The deliniation I was making in saying a $20 dollar party had more
bang for its buck on the east coast then in sf is because of a few
reasons:

1)  a LOT more guest dj's:  from Europe, from the Southeast, Midwest,
West Coast US, Canada, etc.   In San Francisco there has only been
ONE big party where i was charged $20 that featured dj's from anywhere
else besides the west coast.  
    So therefore i think you get more for your money cause you get to
hear a dj you have never heard before.  A typical big party has 
just big locals : tony, dan, garth,, etc.etc.etc..

2)  the music you hear at a big party on the East Coast usually has
more diverse musical taste them big parties here in SF.

  On the east coast you can hear djs spin anything from techno, house
(and all its assorted forms), acid, jungle, trip hop, et.al.  and all
in ONE party.  I grew up on going to parties and hearing a diversity of
techno/house etc.  Basically all the big parties here in SF play the more 
convental music that is out right now, and not the cutting edge music.

  Im not saying there arn't people who are playing the good toonz and
the new music out here.  And i think that the smaller parties that 
happen in SF are a great place to hear whats new (ex. Friends & Family)

but thats just IMHO.  flame shields ready ;)

Hello everyone!,

and pretty much got my dancing out for the weekend! The music was 
really good. Plus the space had the upstairs chill area, which was nice 
and cold, well not cold, but cool! I loved everyone I met there, (and by 
the way hello to everyone I did meet!) I just had a great night!! Thank 
you "Move" crew!!!!!

Peace, love, and harmony to all beautiful people!!!,

hey throw down the shields, i think we're in agreement...
i LOVE jungle and trance and all the variety..
but you know i'm a tribal acidy trancey house junkie and
you just *don't* get that here.... hard house and deep
house but not that exact flava that i'm so addicted to
that you only hear in sf....

as far as what you're getting for the $$, san francisco
gives more vibe for the buck than anywhere on the planet.
you know it, people here know it....sf is the model scene
as far as that goes, and *that* was what i was referring to.

i hope that clarifies!   :) :)

peace & love from NYC,

June

Don't know what the name of the party was but it was an absoloute 
stormer.  Just goes to show that it is possible to have a really good, 
small and intimate, organized and underground rave.  Cleverly, the 
organizers did not allow the venue to get to full so that it did not get 
to be a sweat box.  Also, donations was the entry price which meant that 
people gave money both on the way in and the way out.  The decorations 
were beautiful and the entire space was in the form of an l-shape which 
is an exellent shape for a  dance floor.  The visuals were also stunning 
because the guy was superimposing very powerful fantasy type images under 
animations of fractles; the backdrop that it was being projected on 
could have been hung a bit better though.  There was a really intimate 
crowd and, probably because it was a free party, there was a good mix of 
a crowd with quite a lot initially reacting to Gil by going "huh?"  soon 
started to dance and to get into it.
I really like Goa Gil but a whole night of him and nothing else is a bit 
hard to handle.  They should have some house and ambient techno in the 
early morning.  This is what (one) the difference is between here and 
London is that there their would have been other sets by dj's playing 
different music.  But when you can put three decks, a mixer and a video 
projector in a brief case there a lot to be said for it.
A really whicked party.  Tristan.

It's true that not everything is free on the internet.  But does that 
justify charging more?  Just because it costs you money to use internet 
and to put information on it doesn't mean that i can not charge you 
freely.

I agree!!   I notice that over here in Australia,  they have a LOT MORE
guest DJ's.    In SF,  I can only remember in a very few instances where
DJ's are brought in from somewhere else...

Again I have to agree that SF has much less variaty than elsewhere.
It wasn't until I got over to Australia,  before I realized that there
was SO MUCH MORE stuff out there.

Well I'm back at my own home now.  It's been a long and interesting 2 weeks.

As I was flying into London, I heard on Radio 1 of an anti-Criminal Justice
Act demonstration taking place the same afternoon at Clapham Common.  I
wasted no time after arriving at Heathrow getting to the scene.  I had
visions of molotov-throwing rioters turning the place upside down.  What I
found was similar to a street fair, kind of a pinko picnic.  It seemed to be
organized by a coalition of unionists, socialists and communists.  There was
a good deal of entertainment in different tents, including Glen Tilbrook and
Blue Aeroplanes.  But where was the house music, I wondered?  It seemed to
follow that a demonstration against the CJA would include those targeted by
the law.  Indeed, there were crusty/traveller type bands (people who look
like our deadheads who are also targeted by the CJA) but the only rave
connection I could find was a guy selling mix tapes.  He indicated that
house/techno/jungle was too hot politically, and that people in the UK were
afraid of it.  I started to walk off, when I noticed a group gathered in the
distance.  As I had hoped, it was a party.

United Systems had set up a sound system on a flat bed truck on the far end
of the park, next to a carnival.  The police were gathered in numbers nearby
but chose to do nothing at the time.  They were told they could go to 9 p.m.
but no further.  The crowd grew as the groove went hardcore.  It was an "old
school" type rave sound (though the r-word was never used I think the whole
time I was in England).  I appreciated the energy of the crowd which was
otherwise similar in size and vibe to a Sunset.  An MC reminded the crowd
that the were defying the CJA ( actually I don't think so, only if the
police captain says they are) and busted lame rhymes like "hardcore, you
know the score" that undoubtedly left others attending with thoughts of
happier times.  The sound wasn't that great, but I actually found the rough
edges added to the excitement.  The DJ seemed to be operation over a pirate
station from a nearby van.

Speaking of pirates, I found numerous stations playing a variety of dance
music up and down the FM dial.  I hope we can see more pirates here.

That party wound down at the appointed time, and the day passed without
incident.  My next few days were devoted to sightseeing in London.  On
Thursday, out of curiosity I headed out to the original Megatripolis.  I was
curious about the clubs there, they are a big deal to people.  But there is
an obsession with fashion that turns me off (as well as other factors mostly
related to club-owners greed).  Megatripolis wasn't too bad, still pretty
commerical, best found in the music.  Sort of "handbag trance?"  In other
words, some trance, mixed with popular commercial trax.  There were
undoubtedly more underground clubs, more commercial clubs, but I had sated
my taste for London clubs.  The light show at Heaven sure kicks butt,
though!  Lasers, video, etc.-a pretty impressive place.  Other major
hotspots were Ministry of Sound, Club UK and Gardening Club. 

Friday, I went horseback riding.  Try it once, it's fun.  Sure is weird to
look down between your legs and find a huge beast underneath you.

Later that day, I checked out the Raincoats, undoubtedly some of you
remember this great post-punk band.

Saturday, I was on a train to the main event, the UK Tribal Gathering by
Universe and festival promoter Mean Fiddler.  It was a Big Deal over there.
Why?  It seems to be a new direction for the dance music scene by merging
raves with the festival scene, and doing it legal and properly.  As Fraser
has pointed out, the tradition of festivals and faires in the UK goes back
to medieval times.  The festival system allows rave culture to graft itself
onto the mainstream Anglo-Saxon culture.  

I found a long line for the bus to Otmoor Park when I got off the train at
Oxford, so I decided to walk.  Although I got lost a couple times, after an
hour or so I was able to find the right direction.  As I crossed the traffic
control zone, I met up with some locals who were on there way to TG who
accompanied me there.  It was another exhausting 2 hours to get to the park,
but it was a scenic walk through canola fields and a picturesque village.
Eventually, I beheld the site- 5 huge tents where some 20,000 people were
gathering.  As I approached a tent, I found that it was stiflingly hot in
the tents.  Sweat was condensing on the ceilings and dripping down the
sides.  It was an unusually hot week in England.  The tents were packed, but
the Tribal tent seemed to offer the most comfort and the best sound and
music, so I spent most of my time there.  The people were friendly
(especially some aussies that were there) but due to the size I found it a
bit impersonal.  Wandering around, I found a tent specializing in Jungle,
the other tents were mainly harder forms of techno and trance with a little
house.  Highlights for me were Richie Hawtins set and 808 State's
performance.  Groups like the Prodigy and Orbital played, but since those
arenas were steamy, overcrowded zoos, I backed off from them.  Comfort was
not a strong point there, as chillers were forced to sit in the back of the
tents, there was no real chill space provided.  Overall, the party went
smoothly as it was professionally put together and executed (but for this
reason lacked excitement for me).  The Brits seem to like the sheer size of
it, I found it a bit overwhelming.

On the way back from England, I stopped in Vancouver, Canada where I found
the weekly club Sol at Graceland.  It's a great club, worthy of any
metropolis.  The DJ was db from NY.

Now I'm glad to be back, I wish you, my friends, could have joined me, and I
look forward to seeing you all soon.

That's all I have to say for now, be on the lookout for pictures on my web
site.  Anyone know of someone who can digitize my photos?

the vibe is pretty damn good, but not the best on the planet..

(changing subjects)

I think most 'rave scenes' are in limbo right now.  Everything seems to
happen in the clubs these days- less undergrounds- Lack of Freshness
(Regurgitated party concepts>> Fractal bubbles and silly names)  It just
seems like the progression of the scene (in most places) stopped in '93.

>you know it, people here know it....sf is the model scene
>as far as that goes, and *that* was what i was referring to.

I like the fact that there are *alot* of parties out here, but maybe that's
why I never get that gravitational feeling at parties here.  Even if I go
to the party that I hear will be 'the best'> It seems like somethings
missing.  Like everyone else is at a different party. It's a wierd feeling<
the place would be packed and most of my friend would be there, but there
were probably 5 other parties that night.  elsewhere, the scenes were
usually small (600 to 1000 people in your area 'in to it')  and about 1 or
two parties on a saturday night.  It was cool because <everyone> was there!
There was gravity.  This was also cool because promoters didn't have to
battle each other.


but maybe I felt that vibe cuz I'm new here..

Dunno..

You have got to respect that people here are into this music.  I'm sure
people who moved out east would be saying 'this music sucks'-- I want my
deep house, but SF's got a unique style.  When I first moved here, I wasn't
used to the scene, and I felt uncomfortable.  Now I just kick it w/ my
friends and have fun at parties.  I don't hear the music I would like to
hear, but I figure it's because people here are trippin' off a different
vibe< A vibe that took me 7 months to get used to..

Well, MOVE did justice to what a rave could be: Folks, Fun, and cool door
guards.   The vibe never got to too much of a frenzied pace there was also
too many radical swings from upbeat to insta trance and such.  I heard from a
few others that the music was a tad bit low (I disagree, however, since it
wasn't too spacecious).  The politeness meter was at an all time high, which
is always nice.
The fan was a lovley idea since, only after 15min of non-stop dancing the
temperature rose considerably due to the many-o-dancers....  
Drawbacks: The ambient room lacked ambient music.  Although friendly, the
crowd didn't seem to be too receptive to random smiles (although there were
one or two of you I saw =).... The only other major complant would be that
needle skipping ( I think that speaks for itself...).  All in all it was
worth $10 for admission....


Smile-O-meter:
           Room: 5Smiles (seen closets bigger than this venue)
Friendliness: 7Smiles
            Vibe: 6Smiles (too many wild music/mood changes) Additude checks:
7Smiles (no one I saw fronting on anyone...)
 Chill factor: 6Smiles and a shrug (6.5smiles)
Overall : 6.5 Smiles
30 day review: Diverse City still tops the cake with the 4/20 party out by
Davenport in a close second.
c-ya next week all.....
Faust.

Move,

Was fun, I had fun.  Music was slow early and picked up later
in the evening.  Smiles were a it on the low side.  I brought
my friends with me and we used our love bubble gun to get people
into the spirit in the chill space.

All in all a nice weekend.  I am looking  forward to the rave scene in
Europe.  I will let you now what I experience when I get back.

Thanks move

Ron.

               Ode To Finals

       As I crack the books,
       And cook the java;
       As I learn a graph
       and study the chart;
       As I strive for a better me,
       I look to my future
       For what I'm about to be.

       I skip on parties,
       And don't see movies;
       I listen to music,
       Only for a second,
       For I know I must
       Concintrate, concintrate, concintrate.

       Next week I smile
       I worry no more;
       For if I passed all test,
       Cleared all finals,
       Made all scores.
       I'll have more stress next year
       But I'll make it my best.
       But soon comes summer!
       NO MORE STRESS!

                               SG

Good luck everyone in finals this week!

I think your vibe-o-meter is in good working condition! (concerning the
question of scene diffusion)

  A few years ago when the scene here was at a high point (IMHO *#*)
there were only a couple thousand or less people of all ages that were in
the know. Good, big, all ages parties happened once a month or less
frequently and EVERYBODY would show up and parties would consistently ROCK!
Essentially the whole scene could fit in a big party. Naturally, alot of
people heard what they were missing and demand soared, supply increased and
the scene went superground, with many more big parties - multiples on
Saturday night and such. From that point on I also started to feel what you
are feeling, something's missing and the scene is becoming diffused. Some
people I know that used to come out say the scene is dead but the recent
personal experiences of many (and I) argue that they are way wrong. It just
may be a bit tougher to have everything gel and have a great vibe (maybe a
more mature :) scene) . Personally, I have found that lately the best parties
(vibewise) that I have been to have something out of the ordinary (I know
this is vague) that adds that little (in)tangible , examples: (not really
in order)

1)Thrown with the right attitude by an extended group of friends which
infectiously spread vibe -FandF-NewMOON-Sunset-etc
2)Some really cool new tracks are busted out (Artists and DJs in direct
symbiosis -  both are equally important, except for a few exceptions IMHO
No need for worship, only smile big and enjoy!)
3)A beautiful location and weather - sparks communal feeling of love and
connectedness to MA and each other...
4)A badass imported or new DJ shakes up a party with extraordinary
mixing talent/records - the others rise to the occasion -Stompy w/Derrick C-
wicked w/ DJ Pierre- 
5)Traditions -Comeunity-LetFreedomRave-
6)Its someone's birthday, wedding, or bon voyage -glen and heather goat
rock NMR
7)Recent infusion of SF dwellers w/ right attitude
8)End of terms of schooling
9)Going to a (nearly extinct) new killer party space
10)That great feeling that you are actually pulling off a crazy little
renegade against the constant threat of bust - Then the Sun comes out,
YOOWSAHHH! -Launch Pad-FMR-NMR-etc. (at least a participant)
11) That you are actually enjoying a perfectly legal daylight event
and that random pedestrians have stopped to gawk and now are actually going
OFF! -Marx meadow-in the light-atomic whatever-
12)The DJs actually mix styles or mix in weird tracks and it actually works
13)An group fills a void of something (music style, perspective, new DJ
opportunity). -YourSistersHouse-Pacific-
14)Some phenomena has directed the DJ(s) on a mission to BLOW YOUR MIND!
-found some great new vinyl-recent nifty sexual developments-was flown
in and paid well to have a little fun for 2 hrs-
15)Unknown combinations of planet lineup, goodie availablity surges, 
widespread rough weeks at work, the mystical vibe *domino effect* and any or
all of the above...

Any more (in)tangibles?

Although I consider myself a true devotee to the aceed housey tribaly funkee
whateva local musical flava I wish there were more parties here with full
spectrum variety. Do y'all think it can happen here? Will they come? 

peaceout to y'all! Bye for awhile,

Lurker Lane      

*#* P.S. The good olde days exist right now - its (99.9%) your choice

Perth report
------------

I was met at the airport by Renato and Jason,  two Warez hackers who
frequent #hpaus, #hack and #phreak.   The other Ausravers I wanted to
meet in Perth were working.

I was surprised to find that most people in Perth have cars,  and also
found out how necessary that is.    Public transpo sux big time in this
area,  as trains mostly run North/South.

Perth is a small city,  but fairly spread out among rolling hills and
pretty nice temperate to sub-tropical climate.   It was raining when I
arrived,  and at about 2 PM when I landed,  was about 65 degrees.

We headed directly to town,  while Renato (Nickname Reno) was quick to
inform me of the local Perth scene.   He was quick to point out how he
dreaded coming in contact with Aboriginal folks,  and it became
immediate how prejudice people in Perth are to ANY race other than White
European,   which really sucked.  In talking to the local people of
Perth,  they were quick to point out that Aboriginal gangs of 20 or more
folks would gang up on whites,  and rob them,  beat them up or
do other nasties to people for being at the wrong spot at the wrong
time.

Eventually we went over to Seth's place,  who is a Gabber DJ.   Perth is
Heavy into Gapper and ultra hard core "Bang Bang!" music,  but I hardy
would call it music.   It has little or no melodic content,  is narrated
with non-singing vocals yelling out "Fuck,shit, and just about any other
4 letter word imaginable".   Centering around 250 to 300+ BPMs.   Hardy
something one could get used to dancing to,  that's for sure.

That evening,  was showers with a few breaks,  thus was the reason why
the rave was canceled.   However,  Renato who for whatever reason,
fears going into the night club area at night with fewer than 5 of his
friends,  insists on not going clubbing unless he can get together with
as many friends as possible.   So we waited around for a while,  got on
line to check our mail,   etc.,   until all arrived.   In 3 cars,  we
head down to the "Infirmary",  a small nightclub in the Westgate area of
town.   Renato was always reminding me of how dangerous Westgate area is
to be out alone at night,  although I didn't see any violence at all.

The infirmary was practically empty,  and the DJ was playing some
horrible combination of house stuff,  no very continuos,  so the
critical energy needed to keep me dancing just wasn't there.

On the corner was DC's with access into the Infirmary through the back,
that played more conventional house.

Eventually we left,  and headed back to Renato's place where I was
staying while I was in Perth.

On Saturday evening,  the Infirmary was to have some trance,  and good
hard core DJ's spinning,  and also the Globe (another night club).  The
globe had a very strict dress code,  and would ONLY admit white
Europeans (Again,  prejudice runs rampant in Perth).   Because I'm an
American,  my hosts highly doubted they could get me into that place,
so they suggested the Infirmary.   We get in OK and when things were
really looking good,   I.E.:  Good DJ,  playing house,  and a good
trance DJ scheduled next,  looked like it was going to be a really good
evening.

I had contacted Lorrie,  and her friend Roger who were to meet me at the
Infirmary.   So things were really looking great.   Then as I was
chilling outside,  noticing a huge presence if police in the area,  yet
another person said "We have heaps problems with Aboriginals ganging up
on people,  so on Sat evening,  there are "Heaps of Coppers!".

Just as I was going to go back in,  one of the door goons said "Sorry,
you can't go back in there!",  gave me NO REASON whatsoever,  and I said
I wanted to get my stuff.   One of my friends volunteered to get my
stuff and quickly ushered me away with no explanation,  other than it
being a political one.   It became very evident just how severe
prejudice Perth is towards ANY foreigners.

My hosts said they doubted if they could get me in ANY club in Perth so
advised me to stay in the parking lot.   All the people I was with were
really scared to go out in any groups less than 5 people.

In fact,  they took extra care in the selection of a parking place,  in
a remote parking lot,   totally hidden from view from any street in the
area.    I also noticed that in most of my friends cars,  they had dark
tinted windows,  so nobody can see in,  despite it being illegal,  and
as we were driving around town,   I was advised to keep the windows
shut.

When we parked,  they put a sunshade over the windshield and locked the
car.    Sheesh!!  Are these kids being extra paranoid,  or is there
really that much of a problem.   I was tripping my brains out,  and
itching to go out and dance,  and all I could do is sit in a car for
several hours while Seth sent back to try and find out why the Infirmary
wouldn't let me back in.

Eventually Seth showed up, and told me of the "Political situation" that
they just weren't going to let me in.   Seth thought it was my attire,
but I was dressed better than most of the others in the club,  wearing
casual trousers,  a long sleeved shirt with collars,  and borrowed
oxford shoes.   Sheesh!!  in the meantime,  Lorrie and Roger were in
there looking for me.

Eventually I decided to phone Lorrie at home and talked to her Mom,  who
eventually gave me Roger's number.   I called Roger,  and CJ answered,
and I explained to him that I couldn't get into the Infirmary to meet
Roger.   CJ said that he could get me in,  because he works there as a
DJ,  but didn't have a car.    I offered to pay for the cab to meet me
at Fast Eddies Diner (The only place I know the location of).

I walked back to the parking lot to tell my friends of the situation and
headed over to Fast Eddies.   On my way,  I saw a gang of about 8
Aboriginal folks,  as I walked by I had eye contact,  smiled,  one
smiled back,  but no incident happened.   I was somewhat relieved,  met
CJ and both of us walked back to the Infirmary.

We get back there,  and CJ immediately gets me in,  then explains to the
management that I came thousands of miles to meet some people in the
Infirmary.   eventually,  everything turned out OK,  but I only got in 2
hours of dancing and missed one of Perth's best trance DJ's but I put in
6 hours of insane dancing until the club shut down at 6 am.

The goons were incredibility hostile,  giving me dirty looks,  and
harassing me whenever possible.   One of the original goons spotted me
in there,  and immediately grabbed me off the dance floor,  but when he
saw CJ there,  he backed off..   CJ wasn't even looking that way.

Towards the end,  that same goon grabbed me again when CJ wasn't
looking, and took me out a side door,  knowing that I wasn't going to
get the chance to have CJ get him to back off.    Fortunately Lorrie was
outside,  and went in to tell CJ what happened.   Anyway,  so this is
what happens when I try to perform my world mission in Perth.

So,   Perth turns out to be a highly prejudice city towards ANYONE not
white,  including Asians,  and Especially Aboriginals,  which is REALLY
FUCKED,  so for all you international travelers,  avoid Perth whenever
possible,  especially if you expect to have fun in any of the night
clubs unless you know someone very influential in the scene.   DON'T
talk to a club goon with an American accent or they will throw you out.

Hey all,

I'm listening to NPR while I'm catching up on some work. They're talking 
about how Darwin's theory of evolution is becoming obsolete.

The idea is that because Darwin wasn't aware off chaos theory, his 
observations weren't entirely accurate. 

Further, it's mentioned that genetic engineering is actually a form of 
evolution, only at a much more rapid pace(?)

The quote is made: "Evolution occurs best at the edge of chaos"

If we're undergoing an evolutionary change with our new culture, then 
that means....chaos?

The shape of things to come?

Something for us to chew on over our coffee.

later...

Jonas

It would appear that Darwin's theory of evolution has become a victim of 
Darwin's theory of evolution.

Yeeaaaa, lets hear it for chaos.  For me raving is like a controlled form 
of chaos.    Something in me feels compelled to dance, that goes beyond 
reason.  When I think about what it does for me, seems very reasonable.

I can't make much sense of raving, but raving seems to make alot of sense 
to me.

"Mister Order, he runs at a pretty good pace
But old mother Chaos is winning the race.

And behold, thusly was the Law formulated:
IMPOSITION OF ORDER = ESCALATION OF CHAOS."

>From "The Honest Book of Truth" by Lord Omar Ravenhurst, "THE ILLUMINATUS 
TRILOGY" By Robert Shay and Robert Anton Wilson.



Also, it is interesting to note that Darwin's Theory of Evoloution, 
unlike Newtons or Eistien's theories, is the only scientific 
biologigal explanation that would hold true for any kind of life form one
can think about (weather it is carbon-based or otherwise) that holds 
true.  I don't think that it is a case of Darwins Theory becoming 
obsolete I think that it is a question of Darwins theory speeding up.  
More people are at one with their souls now then at any other time in 
Earth's history and, in todays time, those people are able to live longer 
because they Are happy and are at peace with themselves.  And, as Darwins 
theory states, the more of a species that has traits that will lead to a 
fuller and more realized life the more of that kind will be born of in 
subsequent generations.  And this is what has happened: we went from 
being a small rather obscure group in the 1960's to being a movement of 
such massive and world wide proportions that Governemnts have had to laws 
to try and stop it.  So the next generation is just simply going to blow 
us away.
  Evoloution is speeding up which means Darwins theory is also 
speeding up (eg machines make us live longer which is why there has been 
such a speed to the industrial revoloution of the 1870's).
In short, Chaos Theory is about mathmatically working out why we are 
here.  But Darwins theory gives order to that chaos because it is the 
only intellectual argument that gives order to the chaos that is life.
Does any of this make any sense?
Tristan.

more than possible!! :)  i've had some really loving experences with 
whole groups of people all sober as the day they were born, everyone 
letting down their defenses and loving unconditionally.  i've had 
intense ecstacy experences that filled me with a sincere sence of love, 
peace, acceptance, etc., but e has still never greatly appealed to me 
because having all those emotions and sensations in a nonsorted way was 
and is so much more... i don't really have a word for it.  rewarding, 
perhaps, maybe just because i can eat a sandwich in the midst of it all 
and because the next morning i can remember the whole thing and my jaw 
isn't sore.  

manny!  what a ramble!  sorry if i strayed.  anyhow, the point was, yes, 
you most certianly can duplicate, and even surpass (if you so desire) 
the "e feeling" with out taking a darn thing.  try it, theres a good 
chance you'll suprise yourself.  as george harrison once said "realize 
its all within yourself."    

sincere love,

I'd have to agree with this.  More diversity out east.
Though I do like what I'm seeing in the small parties that are happening 
all the time here in SF (which is where the future of SF "raves" is at, imo).

mmmm Sputnik parties...those rocked...
which reminds me...i like having net.ravers at a party i'm at...even if i 
don't know them too well...if you're ever in trouble or need help, stick 
by the net.ravers, you'll be safe.
(the reason i say this is, sputnick iv was shut down due to pepper gas 
being set off...at like 7am i think...anyways, i was very "confused" at 
the time, but i knew where all the net.ravers were standing, so i just 
stood by them until the person i came to the party with walked by, and 
everything was a-ok.  god bless those net.ravers.)

i think i even met doug z at that party...

Hi, phrew, just got back from a run.
As I was waiting to cross the street, I was doing a little bopping to the 
music on my walkman.  Waiting for the light to turn green, I heard a 
loud horn blast in the distance.  As I looked up seeing this big truck 
driving by I saw this truck driver with a big smile on his face giving me 
a big wave.  Although he couldn't hear the music I was listening to, I 
know he felt the vibe.

BEGIN QUOTE FROM Doug Zimmerman:

: hey everyone,

:   i just wanted to add a little tidbit about flyers that pisses me
: off also.  All they list is the party and info number consistently.
: 
:   they leave optional:  the dj's
: 
: and hardly ever include: the PRICE
: 

As justification, flyers are often printed before much of that info
is locked in.  Price often depends on DJ's and other costs (not that
I recommend doing it that way - use a budget!).

Also, unless you know every DJ in the world, who is dj'ing should not
be as much a concern.  You go to have fun, and hopefully you attend parties
by people you have come to trust, and you trust them to provide a good
party for you.  I know if I did a party here the way I would like to,
you would not recognise any of the dj names (well maybe one or two,
being from the East Coast), but you would still have a great time.

Was this in The City?  'Cause it may have been more than the vibe that he

This comes around every few years.  What happens is that we revise or add to
our definition of "fitness" in the concept "survival of the fittest", and
some people take this revision as a rejection of the whole concept.  (Modern
Darwinians might state this as "reproduction of the fittest".)
	Stated another way: The fact that the biggest and strongest aren't 
necessarily the most successful doesn't mean that evolution isn't working;
it means that "fittest" didn't mean what we thought it did.

Thus proving its own utility, in a recursive and chaotic sort of way. >%^)

Anyone interested in this topic should go read some Richard Dawkins; _The
Blind Watchmaker_ is a good place to start.  Once you're done, _The Selfish
Gene_ and especially _The Extended Phenotype_ contain further cool information
about the consequences of evolution, a seriously chaotic process.
	All these books are well-written, and fun to read without being dumbed
down.  I find a knowledge of evolution (genetic _and_ memetic) indispensable
to a clear understanding of the world and what to do about it.  Yes, 
indispensable.  Studying psychology or any form of human behavior (like, for
instance, trying to live life) without a good grounding in evolutionary
theory is like trying to study chemistry without knowing atomic theory; 
you don't know why or how anything happens, all you have is a bunch of seemingly
random and inconsistent rules of interaction.  Psychology is to evolutionary
theory as alchemy is to chemistry.

begging the question: where is the best vibe on the planet?

not that it doesn't vacation, but I do have a feeling it calls SF 
home.  and I don't mean to start a geography war - more like what
was/is your experience elsewhere and is it possible to describe
it?   this ain't easy, in my opinion.

I felt an almost _irresistable_ pull toward Move on Saturday.
But, honey, I didn't make it after all.  I get that feeling of potential
when I see certain faces.  Oh, the beautiful ones, I suppose.

I like the idea of my own mass.  It's not too interesting where
other people may be.  If I go to a party then Obviously it is *the* 
party to be at, no?   Baby, we're gonna go off due in no small part 
to the fact that I'm here now.  I like this energy.  With room for
subtlety, mind you.

Yes, I'm all that ... :^)

I love the bay area and SF in particular,  it is now my home and I
have to admit that I am a person that loves to travel.  I've been all
through europe and the UK and the vibe is strong here, the only place
that I've seen that comes close is Amsterdam.

You go girl! :)
It is important for those of us who do still go out to try to radiate
positive energy and to emit as much Vibe per distance square as possible.
If more of us had the attitude that it was their job to insure that
the party went off then the scene would be better for it.

In my opinion the state of the Scene is a direct relation to:


	1) Who is going out and how positive they are.
	2) The type of music being played by the DJ's
	3) The current mixture of street chemicals that are 
	   being passed around.

This is becoming one of the main reasons I go out. I got something to GIVE.

I know it all depends on how *you* define vibe, or what *you* are
looking for/expecting, but I would choose Detroit without a blink.
Sure, there have been less than spectacular parties, but it is there
that I have had several of the best experiences in my life, and I
would gladly return over and over in hopes of another one like those.
I am not good with expressing feelings in text, so I cannot describe
them to you.  I could not do them justice.

If you are looking for thousands of ravers in a circus-like environment
full of mind-altering stimulii, you are in the wrong town.  If you are
looking for music to move your soul, Detroit is all that and more!

Wow, I'm glad to hear that he's still around doing his thing. No, I
don't know him personally either, but I remember him from way back in
the late sixties. He used to do a medical column for the underground
papers under the name Dr. Hip-ocrates. And yes, if any M.D. could be
said to specialize in drug use, he is certainly qualified.

"Survival of the fittest" was a reactionary slogan appropriated by the
Social Darwinists (a nice academic name for a rather nasty bunch of
pseudo-intellectuals and political bullies . . . my my, why does that
remind me of current times?!) who never bothered to understand Darwin's
rather careful theorizing, or else simply grabbed the part that fit their
predetermined views.

Genetics and population biology have been through several transformations
since Darwin, and the generally agreed models are quite a bit different
in some ways than he initially envisioned, but that's not surprising.
Galileo and Newton are still relevant to physics in the same way, even
though physics is far different now than it was three centuries ago.

I'd recommend more current reading than "The Selfish Gene," which was
written in the mid-1970s when the doctrinaire view of things was summarized
by the often-quoted maxim, "A chicken is just an egg's way of making mor
eggs."  The selfish-gene idea, though a leap forward in understanding in
many ways, turns out to be somewhat simplistic in its viewpoint, especially
since the lessons and techniques of nonlinear mathematics have filtered
into biology and the whole deterministic cause-and-effect framework which
has dominated western science starting in the Middle Ages, and with its
roots in the categorical philosophy of the Greeks, has started to come
apart at the seams a bit.

I'm not up on all the current good lit in biology, but it's important to
read current works as well as recent "classics" like Dawkins.  

Obrave?  It's about *life*.  Consider whether raving has any evolutionary
implications.  (Well, everything does, but to me it has some particularly
interesting connections . . .)

This is but more "let 'em eat cakism" -- what if you aren't college
educated, or aren't currently enrolled in a college? College librarians
(and corporate research librarians) are indeed helpful and
knowledgeable, and that's their job, that's why their getting paid
$30K-$60K per year, money which comes from your tuition, matching costs
on research grants, taxes, etc.

But  What if you don't have the affiliations to allow you to enter into
the library in the first place??? Most college libraries are expressly
*NOT* public libraries and they often require special affiliations
(e.g. a costly affiliate membership card, current student ID), etc,
just to get in the door. THis is especially the case in cities,
probably less of a problem at a "rural" campus like UC Davis.

Try attempting your suggestion at a public library (which is where the
masses might have to go for information) and free inter-library loans
are out of the question, as are MELVYL or other computer listings. Ask
a public librarian about some info, and unless it's real obvious,
they'll point you to a card catalog or the world almanac and tell you
to look it up yourself. Then half the leads you track down will bottom
out at books that are stolen or misplaced.... And because it's a public
library, they've already censored half the interesting material for
you.

My whole point is that nothing, or at least very little is "free", and
it helps to look at the big picture before coming up w/ an argument
based entirely on your position in the caste system. Not everybody is
you, not everybody has access to university libraries. Hell I spent 6
years at <major west coast university> and I can't even use their
libraries any more. I can't even walk into most of the good libraries
on the campus w/o a current student ID. (or pay the $250.00/yr fee for
an affiliate membership yeah, that's freee...).

> Most of the above costs, save the internet access are intangible. We are 
> paying for method of distribution, not the information itself.

In some cases this is true. It's not the direction that most of the big
investments in the internet are going. Digicash. Micropayments, 
Electronic commerce, etc. That's the future, and it ain't free by a
long shot. Once we figure out how to charge you money, you can bet that
a lot of the interesting content may very well cost you money too.
Today, the interesting content is coming at you courtesy of having to
look at an advertisement on each page you download (e.g. HotWired),
this is a "cost" too.

Furthermore, "save the internet access" is the crux of the issue.
Internet access is not universal, and it is not free. Computers,
terminals, modems aren't free either.

Furthermore, a lot of the infrastructure is "free" now because "they"
want to get you hooked on it so that it becomes a necessity of your day
to day life. THen you won't balk so much (and you'll act like a captive
customer) when this free resource ends up with a billing model similar
to the telephone, with cascading charges for distance, time and amount
of data transmitted.

> Well, gee if I am not paying for it, I sure as hell consider it to be free.

But you *ARE* paying for it. It's just being divided amongst a large
population, some of which are gaining benefit from the internet, and
some that don't even know what the internet is. Furthermore, you will
be paying for it in the future, perhaps even on a per-byte basis as
your bits travel across Amerikkka's privatized internet.

What with the privatization of the internet, it may not be much
different than paying for phone charges in the coming decades. Some big
service providers already "meter" useage and charge for it on a
per-minute basis.

Analogously, you must think the roadways are "free" too because you're
not paying a toll for every road you use. But it's coming out of your
gas taxes ($0.20-$0.60/gallon), your car registration fees, and federal
interstate matching funds that amount to extortion by the federal
government (i.e. the feds will give your tax money back to your state's
interstate system if the state government is willing to limit your
rights so as to  fight the war on drugs).

I KILL most SACRED COWS, drink the BLOOD, and BAR-B-QUE the carcass,
then PREDICT THE FUTURE from the layout of the ENTRAILS! :-) Bruce
Eisner is not my idol (see my previous anti-X rants). Chances are, I
disagree w/ about 50 % of what he says. But I want him to say his
piece, and if he wants to charge $2.00 to speak, that's his business.
The market will decide whether this is a fair and justifiable price,
and complaining about it is a waste of time.

Hell, if you want to find things to pick on, pick on Pacific Bell, or
Microsoft, or Pacific Gas and Electric, or Netscape, or your insurance
company. But it's really misplaced to pick on Bruce Eisner for charging
a piddling $2.00 donation for a talk.

I just finished writing to a friend of mine and something crossed my mind 
and  I want to know how you all feel about this:

I was telling my friend how, for my design class,  I have to make this 
collage of colored shapes to show what music looks like.  I decided to portray 
my *favorite* music: acid trance.  Well, most of my class mates don't 
know what the hell I mean by acid trance, so I'm bringing a couple of my 
tapes to class to demonstrate what I mean.  Now this is where I start to 
feel funny.  I hold rave in all of its forms very close to my heart and I 
don't talk about it much to people who I casually know - such as 
classmates at school or co-workers.  I feel like by playing my music for 
the class that I am putting my neck on the chopping block.  Not that I 
*care* really if they like it or not, but when something is really 
important to me, it still hurts if people openly ridicule it.  To me, 
rave can be like religion or politics: I don't talk about it with others 
who I feel don't understand what it's about. And I don't talk about it 
unless I am asked. Do you know what I mean? 
 I'm wondering if any of you feel similarly.....

love,
Amy

 Larry tries to wave an olive branch before more flames appear ....

 I think some folks here on SFRaves have a raw spot as far as Sir 
Tristan is concerned. Pulling out the one SF/London comparison he
made in what was otherwise a very positive post and getting 
upset over that one passage seems to be overreacting to me. 

 Still , flame war burns sometimes take a long time to heal up, if
ever.

Such as...?  I'd like to find more good books on the subject but the ones I've
seen tend to be (e.g. "Not In Our Genes") arguments against popular
_misunderstandings_ of evolutionary theory.

I don't think there is a conflict here.  The simple mechanism of differential
gene survival in an arbitrary argument can have some fascinating consequences,
like life.

Again, the theory still works; it's people's _perceptions_ of what it means
that change.  It's tempting to twist a description of a process (differential
survival) into a moral judgement on how that process _ought_ to work (I think
I, and people like me, should differentially survive).  Thus you get master-
racism, master-classism (the fact that I was born into money proves my
intrinsic superiority), and other forms of generally being a butt.  So don't.

These arguments do not apply to changes wrought over the scope
of a few lifetimes, genetic movement (except for mass extinction)
being slower than that.  Social movements, etc., are best understood
as _memetic_ evolution, working from a genetically derived set of
base assumptions, produced _genetically_ over a much larger timescale.

This disparity in evolutionary speed (made possible by our complexity
and consequent fitness as a memetic host) causes much of our species'
current conflict.

	But, let's say that one has heard some dj spin many times, and 
every time, that set is nice and seamless, but incrediably flat and 
tired. And what if most this tends to be a trend. I will admit there are 
djs I would rather avoid for a few months so that their sets may gain 
new life. I would hope people would not be turned away because they see a 
new name on a flyer, but instead might go for the new experience...

	Actually, if it is a public university, I think you are allowed 
to use its facilities. I know you can at Berkeley, because I am currently 
not a student and have used not only the stacks (which I think I was 
suppose to $3 for a month or something like that, but the person at the 
entrance never asked me to show anything - as long I didn't try to check 
something out) but I have gotten books out of storage and requested (and 
received) books from the other public  college/university institutions...

	You might be surprised to see how many terminals are available 
these days to retireve information without need for payment (and just 
enough confidence in oneself to be able to read what is on the screen and 
follow the instructions) - granted this type of thing can take a little 
looking round, and I have had the benefit of first paying tution for the 
privlige of using such equipment. 

	The information can be gotten at, you just have to have a few 
people know a few people who know a few people who know a couple things. 
The hardest part now, seems to be finding out where to find out about 
things...

Thank you Larry !  

I also didn't detect a deep barb in that small part of the post... since
we've all discussed "PLUR" recently let's remember to practice it as
best we can... I must admit that I was less than thrilled by Kevin's 
repeated disregard for the positive aspects of our scene and VERY put off
by his put down of the F&F effort ( I wished he had chosen to be a positive
part of the scene instead - perhaps by attempting to get to know us before
popping off about things that he obviously had limited knowledge of ) On the
other hand, if he's willing to bury the hatchet and to stop rubbing our
faces in the "great UK rave scene" - I'm willing to listen. To that end I
was very happy to see a "mostly" thumbs up positive post moving in that
direction. That at least is a step in the right direction and I noticed it
with appreciation. 

Enforce the positive by living positive...

Yes There are differences between the UK and SF. Any idiot could suspect
that since they are differrent cultures. And if you don't know that, you
definitely need to travel more. But as you do so, try to remember 
"When in Rome...." and please (Kevin) try not to insult the "host". Also, 
consider that the best course of action is not to change one into the 
other but to enjoy the best that each has to offer. IMHO of course!

Now let's move on - summer is coming... too many people are saying the scene
has changed ( for the worst ) or that it is dying... we've moved through
one of the darkest, grey day winters I remember in recent times. As we move
into summer I wonder if we can work together to bring out the best in us 
all. I'm willing to work to that end and hoping that there are other like 
minded people out there who will help make it happen. So let's get going!

$.02 out,

Mike

Amy,

Wow!  Playing acid trance for an uninitiated class! Did you do it? Did it
work ?  

  I'm reacting to this because I'm within a year of my first exposure to
acid trance and I like it for dancing and driving ( love Ethan's Acid 
Trance tape ). BUT I don't think I would have related to it "out of the
rave experience" context. For myself, I try to give others a more gentle
intro like the Orb or Orbital or perhaps chill out music and explain how
this "very listenable" music ( IMHO ) grew out of the scene. Then when
people feel like the scene is perhaps positive after all - comes the
OK time to dance - then the acid trance... hopefully at a party that's
really taking off with lots of friendly support. Then it all makes sense.

  Playing acid trance out of context could be coming on too strong too 
fast - kind of like attempting lovemaking without foreplay? I'm reminded
of seeing Rocky Horror at a school with no audience reaction - NOT ANYTHING
like a reactive audience midnight setting. Acid trance makes perfect sense
when you are there on the dance floor and see the energy ( or FEEL the 
energy) - in the sterile classroom I wonder? 

Just my humble opinion of course... Did it work ?

Mike ( who is too often wrong )

PS I very much agree with the idea that things such as raving, music etc
  that have deep meaning are best not flaunted publicly without some care.
  And if your young classmates have trouble understanding just think how
  most of my peers feel - ie think about many of your parents since they
  are closer to my age...  ouch I must be getting older.... But I can
  still dance so I'm definitely not dead yet !

Yah... I know what you mean.  I've gotten used to the thing of people 
poo-poo-ing the music and the scene, even when they've heard it.  The 
music's not for everybody, I guess.  But it's always cool to open 
someone's mind, anyway.  I would think, however, that listening to it in 
class is worlds away from going to a party and dancing your ass off.

You totally ignore the case of UCSF which I walked into, no problem. Does 
this campus count as being in a city?

I tell you I have. Inter-library loans are commonplace, and I have 
requested several texts ranging from cars to law. I live in Fairfield 
which is the middle of nowhere technically. And even here we have the 
SNAP system which is connected to MELVYL and other services. And on more 
than one occasion the librarians have gone out of their way to help me 
locate obscure information, like where to find parts for a '73 Opel 
GT(boy was that fun...) and info on labor law, etc...

This is one area I heartily agree with you, and I really think it stinks, 
considering the exponential lessening of cost of bandwidth.

Except for freenets, which are gaining in popularity and are becoming 
more common. Costs for a Internet-connective machine are negligible at 
worst. You may not have that DEC-Alpha, but you can get something for 
almost nothing.

But Niels, I have been hooked for *YEARS* I have been modeming in one 
capacity or another since 1984. I agree with with you that if they can 
figure out a way to fuck you they will. Now that people are discovering 
the talk command and using programs like Internet Microphone, I am sure 
the RBOC's(Regional Bell Operating Companies) will jump on the charge 'em

Well you forget to mention that the state has to support the 55 MPH

As I have stated before, I wrote a PRIVATE message to Bruce, and he made 
the discussion public. It was never meant to become this big public thing 
that it did. That was his lack of tact. I would love to send you some of 
the mail this guy sent me. From the jist of his messages his a real 
egotistical prick. He only chose to make a response public after he had 
already sent several messages establishing his prickiness(oh well, 
prickiness sounds like a word to me...) And complaining about it is
not a waste of time if it has some effect, which I like to feel it has.

Well three out of four ain't bad. My only problem with Netscape is the 
encroaching commercialization and the associated costs it will create.

You know, for the most part I agree with what you are saying. Again, the 
whole thing should have been a private discussion. I really feel like the 
whole thing was taken out of context. I don't have a problem with him 
advertising his *LECTURE* What I take issue with is that he IMO was 
offering to *SELL* answers to questions about MDMA, which are available 
from a variety of sources. I understand your nothing is free argument, 
and again am 90% in agreeance. So if I said these variety of sources cost 
you nothing more than what you are already paying in I-net access 
charges, taxes, etc., would that make us more in agreeance? That it is 
not necessary to pay $2 more than you already have? 

I hate to feel that I am arguing with you, because you make some very 
valid points, and I really feel that we share similar views on a 
multitude of issues. I just don't want to see SF-Raves devolve into a 
Prodigy(don't know if you have ever seen this service but I swear there 
are more ads than content)  for raves.

A whole night of it just might wear me out, but I'd be willing to risk it. :^)
Too bad I missed it!

Well,

Phunny thing,  you all are talking about Darwyn.   And here I am,  just
arrived in the city of Darwyn,  Australia.   If one would bother to look
for it on the map,   it's at the topmost point,  on the Indian Ocean.

And let me tell you,  it is HOT!! STEAMY!! SWEATY!!  and MUGGY!!  And this
is supposed to be the DRY season.    Yow...  I went to Dripstone Beach,
on the Indian ocean.   Water temp is 85 degrees.   Luke warm bath water
temperature.   It was raining when I landed this afternoon,   right now
it's about 5:47 PM.     1:18:44 AM  5/17/94 Calif time.

Well,  I won't be doing any raving here,  but plan to take a break from
it actually,  and visit the father of my friend in Sydney.   Ian Banaser
is his name,  and he sorta reminds me of Crocidile Dundee...   He runs
a tour group,  and tommorrow,  plan on going to Litchfield Natl park to
see some big huge awsome crocodiles.   These reptiles are so powerful
that they can crush a pigs skull.

Other amazing wildlife is there to be seen as well.   I'll give a report
and plan on taking pictures,  which I plan on putting up on the WEB as
soon as I can get them all scanned in.

Anyway,  I've got to get ready to go out to dinner now,  and Crocidile
is on the menu....  Yum Yum!!  Larf!!  Better to eat them,  then to have
them eat me!!

Hey! Now THIS is why I subscribe to SFRaves!

I talk to my co-workers about raves often - because this is what we do on 
mondays, is talk about what we did over the weekend.  They are mostly 
aged 30-40 and have no other exposure to rave except for what's in the big 
news and an occasional 2-Unlimited song played at a Sharks game.

Out of 20, one person understands what I mean when I say I "felt so good" 
at the party or try to describe the vibe.  (There's just no good way to 
do this!) And she often tells me about parties she went to in South 
America when she was younger and how people danced all night.  I doubt 
she will ever take her children to The Gathering or anything, but I think 
she understands.

The other 19 people just seem make up their own ideas about what it's 
like.  So I don't really go into detail with them because it then becomes 
some kind of interrogation. Some people probably think I'm wasting my 
time but they don't say so.  It's just like alot of them go out on friday 
nights to the Los Gatos Brewery after work and buy rounds to work off the 
tension... but I don't tell them they're wasting their time.  Because 
that's just my perception.  So when someone refuses to understand raves, 
I don't feel any more uncomfortable than they would if I asked them why 
they drink beer and talk smack about the boss.

Does that make sense?  What I mean is that I know I enjoy it, and if 
someone asks me, I tell them about it.  If they don't like what they hear 
then that's their choice.  But what they do respect is that I told them 
what I do.  It's the honesty which my co-workers see and not the 
intellibeams!

Willis 
p.s. my parents are this way too...  

"You're not going to those raves tonight, are you?"
"Uh huh."
"Ok, well you better not take any drugs!!" 
"Ok, Ma."

yah Tristan, what's wrong with you? you don't like dancing to hard goa 
trance for 12 hours? You try listening to polka all night, that's even 
more fun. Personally prefer Calcutta Country Western with samples of 
monks and ominous spiritual sounding voices. you don't like that man?

	Oh yah, well some of us have been raving on the moon and are 
going to do so this evening in fact. And for what it`s worth the moon has 
a much better vibe than anywhere on earth. We're thinking about hitting 
Saturn next but Mars has much better pyramids and other archeological 
sites of interest.

	I find this post highly inappropiate. No good can come of this! 
I would never support a party organized by "the Family", after what they 
did to Sharon Tate and others , that would be almost as bad as a rave 
done by the KKK, although i'm not against costume parties!

Hello,

This is because conservative philosophy revolves around getting the 
government out of people's lives as much as possible.

When exceptions are made (by those other than Buckley), they are usually
due to some sort of personally held fear.

For example, few know that Reagan, coming from a showbiz background, 
knew many gays and thus was not homophobic.  In fact, he once did an
AIDS benefit commercial.

I recently acquired Lowdown Motivator by Freaky Chakra, a full
length release by Daum Bently (with some help from ex-sfravers 
Jon Drukman and Michael Wertheim). A few comments:

- It kicks ass: thick powerful acid-funk-trance, excellent production
with lots of deep growling bass synth sounds.  On the Astralwerks label.

- Daum is a really nice guy, local to the SF scene, can be often be
found dancing and sharing the vibe at Sunsets and other parties.  Some 
of the music will sound familiar since he's been giving 12-inch preview 
copies to Galen who has been debuting them at Sunsets since last year.

- The CD insert contains a nice photo of a Sunset party at the Berkeley
Marina.  It was the one with the naked guy, and with everyone up on
the hill just about anyone who was there that day is in this picture.

So here's a chance to support and get your hands on some great musical
creations that have in part been inspired by us.

Most definitely, Amy. I been working with the Bay Guardian, trying to get a
forum for Rave Culture, but they're getting cold feet. The don't like the 
fact that the music has drug connotations (acid trance).

I guess that's what we have to deal with. Not everyone is going to 
understand what we're about, or see that our intentions are positive. I find 
this frustrating.

I've found that I can usually "feel" most people as to their receptivity 
to what we do. I usually discuss other controversial topics first. If 
they're open with that, then I mention what I do. 

Too  many times I've tried to explain myself to people, only to receive 
blank looks in return. 

More to say, but I gotsta scat. later...

        COMPLETELY. When i did a small 'rave related" (as, IMHO, this is
about living and therefore everything is related to that) project for my
sculpture class i got responses like "oh yeah, that superficial drug-fest
circus meat market pickup joint" blah blah blah..
        It's tough to stick your neck out when there is so much bs and
misinformation out there (well, actually, for some ppl it IS a drug fest..)
but i guess the only way to 'inform' others is though dealing with them and
being sincere and understanding and 'setting an example'.
        it still sucks to be called a fad-chasing druggie but when you know
the truth you can deal with it..

Very much so - sometimes it boils down to explaining the music 
as "electronic music," which in a way doesn't do house any justice, but
communicates somewhat of an idea of how the music is made.

I've tried explaining the Vibe, technoshamanism, etc. to the uninitiated
with mixed results.  Its been scary sharing how spiritual raves have been
to some people and haveing them look at me like I'm some whacked out 
fiend.  I'm reminded of a Spun mix tape titled "what we do is secret"

Thanks for posting Amy -

Hi all,

Recently I watched a program on human evolution.  According to scientists homo sapiens 
competed for a niche in nature with another hominid species.  The other species appeared to
be more physicaly fit than humans yet somehow homo sapeins won out.  Scientists cannot figur
e out why we were able to outcompete them.  

This leads to the book Food of the Gods, which I have just started reading.  Terrance M. 
believes that by eating the mushroom are brain was able to grow at a rapid rate.  A rate
that many scientists cannot explain. IF humans were competing with another species that
may have been more physicaly fit than a bigger brain would have been an excellen selection
for survival.  So those homo sapiens that ate a particular species of mushroom gained an 
advantage over their competitors.  This advantage leads to reproduction and survival of 
humans.  

These ideas dont really have any scientific proof to back them up but it still is neat to 
fancy that we exist because of a psychadelic substance.  I think its possible.

love chris

Yea, Amy, I know what you mean.  I write music mysefl, some of it acid
trance, and when I'm alone or at a rave or with people who understand, most
all rave or ambient music (including but not limited to my own) is infinite,
huge, all encompassing.  But sometimes I bring tapes of my stuff to my day
job (office, business type stuff) and play it for my coworkers and some
times the music loses  some of its multidimensionality.  I guess it's
because I'm still a little wrapped up in what people think of me (a hard
thing to admit, but I'm working on it).  I could go on and on about this,
but the point is I understand.  Music=religion=spirituality=life...

Even if they don't like it you still will have shed some wonderful light
into thier lives and greatly affected their conscienceness.  Peace.

Rick

I've listened to much of Terrance M's. words and just saw him speak in
Sacramento a couple of weeks ago.  His theories are very believable and well
researched.  I've had no problem relating to things I've heard him say.  It
takes an open mind though.

     Amy, I really liked what you touched upon because I think it hits alot 
     of us as we try to integrate significant things in our life.  
     Sometimes it's difficult to decide how open you should be and if you 
     can handle the off-the-cuff comments & criticisms that may come from 
     people _until_ they are more aware of (God, I hate this term!) "rave 
     culture"--including all of it's aspects.
     
     What works for me may not work for everyone else but what I do is try 
     to live my life as an open book.  I've had people who lived this way 
     influence my life and I like not having to think about what I've told 
     and to whom.  _But_ I do use discretion.  Sometimes you just need to 
     take care of business and for me, that means sharing the joy of raving 
     w/my son through the music and events (e.g., Sunsets, drumming 
     circles, etc.) but not clueing (sp?) him into other aspects of raving 
     at this time (he's only nine).  If he can feel the love and 
     connectivity naturally then I've accomplished something in sharing 
     this gift.  
     
     I like to think that I can apply this to co-workers, classmates, and 
     friends too.  It may not be in the same manner (i.e., taking them to a 
     rave) but learning to communicate with them on a level that eventually 
     doesn't require words...maybe a smile, a song, etc. So what I share 
     w/co-workers and classmates that don't know me well, is my joy and 
     love of dance and music.  People who don't know me see my vitality and 
     often want to get to know me.  In part of that process, I reveal what 
     I'm into and what feeds my soul.  As a result of this, I've found that 
     I'm drawn to more people that can relate to me hence the widening 
     circle. :)
     
     I spoke with an Irish friend of mine recently and he said they don't 
     really use the term "rave" anymore in England.  So to me the 
     distinction is not as clear, in fact, as you said "rave can be like 
     religion or politics", it's an influence that has connotations.  If 
     you loose the terminology or labels and just express the feelings, I 
     think more people can relate to you _without_ the initial bias.  (I'm 
     not saying this in denial or anything, it's just a backround way of 
     letting people see what you're into...if you want to share in that 
     manner.)
     
     In any case, the effervescence you want to convey to others may not be 
     welcomed...then again, try intentional smiling and making eye contact 
     with people as you walk down the hall at work or on the street and see 
     what their reactions are :)  I like to think of it as infectious.
     
     Thanks again for your post and apologies to all for my long 
     windedness.
     
Diane

I just finished writing to a friend of mine and something crossed my mind 
and  I want to know how you all feel about this:
     
I was telling my friend how, for my design class,  I have to make this 
collage of colored shapes to show what music looks like.  I decided to portray 
my *favorite* music: acid trance.  Well, most of my class mates don't 
know what the hell I mean by acid trance, so I'm bringing a couple of my 
tapes to class to demonstrate what I mean.  Now this is where I start to 
feel funny.  I hold rave in all of its forms very close to my heart and I 
don't talk about it much to people who I casually know - such as 
classmates at school or co-workers.  I feel like by playing my music for 
the class that I am putting my neck on the chopping block.  Not that I 
*care* really if they like it or not, but when something is really 
important to me, it still hurts if people openly ridicule it.  To me, 
rave can be like religion or politics: I don't talk about it with others 
who I feel don't understand what it's about. And I don't talk about it 
unless I am asked. Do you know what I mean? 
 I'm wondering if any of you feel similarly.....
     
love,
Amy

Exactly!  I work with quite a diverse group of individuals.  One is into
Blues, one is into Country, one is into Jazz and Classical, and two are into 
to rock.   Unfortuanltly, the last two are the ones who have control of the
stereo.  So I'm stuck listening to Rush and Queensryche (SP?)  all day. 
Every now and then they will put on something interesting like Peter Gabrial
or some old prog rock stuff, but for the most part, its rock and roll all day
long.  I've brought in a few tapes, mostly house stuff, and all they say is
"it sounds like disco!"  Surprisingly, they liked FSOL and the Orb, but, I
think its because its ambient.  They say it reminds them of Pink Floyd (?).

There have been a lot of responses to Amy's lament about people not
understanding what the rave culture is about, and why we do what we do.  In
my experience, it is has been difficult to explain the phenomenon known as
raving, and when I was into the Dead I had similar difficulties.  What I
began doing was to give people examples of other life experiences that
offer the same (well, maybe 'similar' is better there) energy.  Hoping they
might understand better the "feeling" of a rave.

Brief history of experiencing shared positive energy:  If you have never
been to a Dead show, about five minutes prior to the first note and about
five minutes after there is this intense excitement in the air and it's not
uncommon to see people running around (blindly) with HUGE smiles on their
faces hugging strangers.  It's a great moment and one in which there is a
universal connection with every person in the building; a shared positive
energy.  Flash now to a professional football game.  The Buffalo Bills had
just beaten the N.Y. Jets in overtime, at home, and the fans ran down on
the field (pictures of it were titled "Fandamonium").  As I was crossing
the 50 yard line high-fiving just anybody and everybody, hugging strangers
and the like, I was suddenly struck with the thought that what I was
feeling was just like the start of a Dead show.  Virtually everyone in the
whole stadium just sharing one huge positive energy.

Flash now to now.  Raving in San Francisco.  Walking into the main room for
the first time.  Hearing your favorite song get mixed in and smiling when
it turns out to be everyone's favorite song and the crowd lets out a loud
cheer.  Dancing hard on stage at 1015 Folsom and feeling that maybe a
smidgen of the cheering is directed toward you. Shared positive energy!

With all that said, here are some other experiences I have had in my life
that I would use to explain the feeling I get from raving.  Please feel
free to add on to the list. Maybe someone could compile the results (I
don't have time, really).  I suggest you have a couple of your own on hand
so the next time a friend/parent/whoever asks, "Why the hell do you go to
raves?  What's the big deal?"  You can say, "Well, remember how excited you
felt when you came home on Halloween night to sort your candy?  That's how
I feel at a rave."  :^)

Here's what I came up with in a couple minutes.  Some are singular
experiences, some I shared with thousands.  How's this for a title: Things
that have given me that intense tingly feeling that I so often get at
raves:

Coming home on halloween to sort the candy
Christams morning
Just as the Dead are starting
Wrestling in front of a packed crowd (and winning)
Graduation (high school & college)
Having a favorite team win a tight game
Midnight on New Years
New Orleans Jazz Festival
Reggae on the River

And remember, don't try and force feed the feeling to people, if worse
comes to worse, just think of a great time you had at a rave and sit back
with a big peaceful smile on your face  as if to say, "You just wouldn't
understand...."

;^}

Yah, that's about right.  You can usually tell pretty quickly with most 
people if they'd be receptive to the idea.  And if they're not, then they 
don't need to know.  Let them be oblivious!

technoshamanism explained

shamans have traditionally used rythmic sound generated by gourd, rattle, or
drum to induce trance-like states for various purposes - healings, journey
to the underworld, spirit retrievals, etc. -
to those of us who have walked in both worlds (traditional shamanic and
rave) the similarity of "altered state" achieved by either method of trance
induction is markedly similar - the only thing lacking is that the
technologically induced trance state usually lacks clarly articulated
"intention"
there are many who believe that a good dj on a good night is quite capable
of inducing mass trance states - just like a tradition shaman - only using
new technological toools and sound sources, hence technoshamanism - it will
never be a true shamanic state until intention is understood (IMHO)

hope this helps

Hmmm....I've been sitting here for the last few minutes thinking of what 
gives me that same intense tingly feeling I get at raves.  You know what 
- I hate to say it, but *NOTHING* compares!  In all of my 25 years on 
this planet, there has been absolutely nothing that compares to the feelings I 
have when I'm dancing and vibing with everyone on a higher plane of 
consciousness.  There is just nothing like it in the world!!!!  

love,
Amy

A whole book could be written on it, but briefly (I'm at work) here's my
interpretation:

Music and sound in many ways create reality.  When music is playing it
creates a space to be.  It creates a mood, a feeling, a vibe.  Music and
sound trigger emotions and feelings from within our selves.  The feelings
include the entire spectrum.  When at a rave and dancing it is possible to
be swept up in the feeling and vibe of the music and be profoundly and
spiritually moved.  Think about it, the music is almost completely
controling the reality of the situation....if it's on the people are
dancing, moving running around, jumping sometimes completely out of
control... if it stops, everyone stops....it puts everyone on the sames
wavelength with a very similar focus...with everyone on similar wavelengths
an energy can be created that is tangable...you can see as well as feel it.
This is technoshamanism; using technology (ie. records, turntables,
speakers, etc.) to move people in such a way as decribed above.  The dj is
the shaman.  He/She decides what music to put on.  He/She (ideally) feels
the vibe of the croud and is able to direct the flow of energy (through
choice of music) to gain the maximum benifit for everyone involved.  If you
are ever in a situation (any situation) where you feel like the energy isn't
flowing well, try changing the music that is playing, and if there is none
playing, put some on and watch the whole atmosphere of the room shift.
Sometimes the shift is subtle, but sometimes quite profound.  IMHO ofcourse.

Rick

> I'm wondering if any of you feel similarly.....

  You know, I gotten to the point where I'm really having fun with
this......as most of you know me.....I am a somewhat sedate 43 year old Jr.
college English instructor...gray-haired...but with a definate twinkle in my
eye...People used to come up to me at parties and ask what I was doing
there...or wanted to know if I was a narc.....However, now...when I pull up
to stop lights and the windows and mirror in my BMW are shaking..( I've got
200 watts thumpin inside)...I get the strangest looks...Also,......I"ve got
turntables and a mountain of speakers in my living room now....and while my
house was for sale, I had the most interesting time trying to explain to
people what I was doing with all that equipment.......Never fear...What they
don't know, won't hurt you.....Anyway...I'm moving out into the country,
probably on an acre or so......Hope to invite some of you down for a real
HOUSE warming party.......robertj....monterey

Origin Of Man and The Descent Of Man were Darwins first publication that 
he solely dedicated to scientific knowledge, never did he intend to have 
it turned into a political propaganda by the Facsist nor the Nazi's.

Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) was a freind of Darwin who took Darwins work 
and applied the term SOCIAL DARWINISM which in Spencer's ttheory meant 
that low class people are destined to die according to survival of the 
fittest theory. His theory became popular among the Nazi's and Facist 
government.

Historically Herbert Spencer is responsible for hinting toward racism by 
using Darwins scientific ideas and applying it to his own sick beleifs.

Well, I think a lot of misunderstanding comes from the sensationalistic 
media. People (majority) don't want to be informed, they want to be 
entertained. Have you seen the HUGE number of outrageous talk shows 
lately? There are just more and more every day. Look in the paper;
what passes as "news" goes way past the four W's(who,what,where,why) and 
the one H (how) and delves deeply into the realm of editorialization and 
putting a spin on a story. When I have seen anything regarding rave in 
the mainstream press it has been negative. Just this weekend there was an 
article from an AP writer on a couple of kids that OD'd. It started "Why 
did Chris have to die... They went to a rave party and..." We all know though
that this is a very uncommon ocurrance, but when people read this and hear 
JUST these messages it adds up. While I think it is sad and wrong, it is 
no mystery. Rave is something we all know about, and we know the picture 
painted is a false one. Think about this the next time you pick up a 
newspaper or watch the news: If the media is SO wrong about a subject 
that we all know intimately, just how much can you rely on them to give 
you accurate information on the multitude of subjects you don't know about?

YES! The feeling you get when someone is describing an event that WENT

ambient, but it's just that right touch of deep no-vocal morphed out trance.
i luv it!!!  glad to know there are others who like it too.

music id deep but don't make it too deep.  keep it under control cause after
all it is just music.  it ain't no polio vaccine.

 Acurate information from the news ? Seldom happens except for saying things
 like LA had an earthquake... when drugs, politics, governments etc. are
 involved we ALWAYS get a forced and filtered agenda... Now I only wish I
 could figure out exactly WHO sets it....

 Mike

 PS The more things you know about intimately the more you come to realize
 just how bogus the news really is. Also, it's fun to travel to Europe and
 see the stories they see about us and our covert government operations that
 we never see.

hi everybody!

well, here i am with philip and amy at philip's job about to listen to
neato snippets of techno from hyperreal.  cool.

we're deviating from our usual musical tastes by checking out, courtesy
of p., an rem concert.  woohhoo!

anyway, last saturday we went to Satchitananda at a beautiful house the
woods of bolinas.  ethan, cyril, ronan, dante plus guests played pretty
much all night long, despite a noise complaint.  oops.

the location was soooo beatiful!  since the last new moon got rained out,
i was really ready to see friends and listen to incredibly wonderful
music all night.  the music was very very good.  very much on the harder,
faster techno tip in cyril's and ethan's set, which i really got into.
but also very trippy.  ethan's set got everybody all sweaty.  it was
really cool, because it was like a little bit of kommotion in effect out
there in west marin.  ethan's got a serious vibe goin' on that's all his
own.  thanks for playing, man, it was great!  (the tapes for you are
coming along nicely...)

cyril also did a great set, which i loved.  he is one hell of a good dj.
and then, the end the party, was ronan's amazing, much more mellowed out
but still VERY intense musically set.  wow.  this is a side of his
musical life that i haven't seen in a while.  i can't wait to hear more.

amy says:  lighten up you guys.  darwinsism is kool but let's talk about
parties!!!!

anyway, i have to say again this party was one of the more satisfying
experiences party-wise and music-wise that i've had in a while...'cause
of the people involved who are so talented and so much fun.  let's do it
again, over and over until we're sore.

thanks you guys a millions times over and over,

i love you all,

ann

i noticed that the vibe in sf-raves and the vibe in ne-raves is so much
different.  you guys talk on a more intellectual level.  most of the
ne-ravers talk only about parties and the dj's.  you guys talk about
evolution and planets in the universe.  it is truly amazing to know that
there are minds along with the parties.

i luv music (deep music), but it is just music.  isn't it???

Hey Amy,
Great Post, I've been dying to respond to this all day.

Back in 1986 (shit, was that really 9 years ago?!?) I had a similar assignment 
in my 2D design class.  We had to do a design project to go with a piece of 
music and we had to play the music for the class when we presented our work.  
This was in leu of a final exam so we had to make a powerfull statement.  
Since we didn't have acid trance I used an old Dead Can Dance song and my 
presentation generally blew people's minds, except for my one freind in the 
class who blew all of our minds with some old Throbbing Gristle (this was my 
first exposure to this kind of freaky drug music and it opened quite a few 
doors of perception for me).  

The reaction of the class was one of general bewilderment?!?  What was this 
new kind of tripy music??? (really not new at all, just underground, sound 
familiar?).  Was this punk?, new wave?, alternative? (gag me).  They really 
could not classify it and I think that alot of people are uncomfortable with 
that.  But in the end no one reacted negatively.  If anything it was very 
interesting to them even if they didn't like it.  

It was really quite a high for me.  It was like giving each one of them a 
little glimpse of this secret world that they didn't know existed.  If I had 
it to do over again today, I would have chosen the deepest, hardest Acid 
Trance track in my crate and then painted the tripyest, most psychedelic, 
colorful world I could imagine to go with it.

So my advice is go for it.  Don't hold back because part of your spirit is in 
this music and you already know how good it feels to let it shine.  This is 
another chance to show a little part of the outside world that there is 
something deep and mysterious out there that is starting to make some wild 
things happen.  It is also a chance to show them that we ravers don't just run 
around banging our heads to T99 and 2unlimited all day ;).  Our music has 
evolved into a very well developed and expressive art form and I think most of 
the outside world is unaware of that.

Try not to worry about negative reactions.  The nature of true art is to 
expose the artist.  No one has to like it except YOU!!!  And beleive me, if it 
comes from your soul someone is gonna like It.  You have the vibe, Keep It 
Alive!!!  :) 

So good luck to you, and be sure to let us know how it went.

later.
Bliss

I would tend to agree with Max's recent posts .. the SF list has TONS of
cool stuff about life, the universe and everything .. on NW raves it seems
to be more discussing parties, comparing parties, or flaming the party
throwers.  *sigh* oh well ... I wouldn't have expected anything less from
SF Ravers !  I look forward to meeting some of you when I'm down there.

As for the music ... I don't believe there CAN be any such thing as "just
music".  For me, music is such a huge part of my life that to lose it would
be like losing my touch.  Music can make me laugh, cry, sing, get angry,
love, remember, sleep, dream ... music permeates my entire being, and being
at a GOOD rave just brings it home all the more.  I have preferences as to
what kind of music I prefer, of course, but ... music is life to me.

except for accordian solos.


peace

huh, how would one have learned about this rave in the first place ?  being 
new to the rave scene (weeks actually), i pretty much go by the calendar and end 
up at an indoor event like Move, but it seems that there is a lot of action
that is 'off-list', or there is another aspect or element of the scene that 
is 'off-sfraves'.  is this the case ?

acid trance is an extremely addictive, yet benign drug that, curiously 
enough, is consumed through the ears via soundwaves.

I did NOT mean the comparison I made about UK vs.SF as a put down remark 
in this instance.  I was merely commenting on the fact that if it had been 
a similar type of party in London that what I said in my previous 
post on the matter would have been the case.  I just wanted to give a 
nuetral commparison partly because those were the kinds of parties I 
used to help throw in London (similar venue, different djs and free).  If I 
implied that having a 
100% trance night was a bad thing I am sorry; ( I love Gill and I 
love trance.)
  Also, I was not the only one to make this comment about the 
night lots of other people said the same that I talked to; and they, like 
me said it as a mere quible and not as serious critisisom of the night.  
Nothing can not change the fact that it was one of the best parties I, 
and everybody else I spoke to had been to in ages.
   Cheez! Give me a break!
   Although that it is a thought you know: a party were the main floor 
plays everything from hard techno to Acid house/house to dub and ambient.

Just Music?  JUST MUSIC?  Obviously you've been listenting to some
*mediocre* music.

A major difference that I've noticed between east and west is that the east
likes to shake their booties and the west likes to sit and chill to some
ambient.  (Not saying one is better than the other)

I remember a party called "Stop the Pigeon".  It was one of a series of
parties put on by VOOM producions in 93.  The theme of the party was based
on the soviet revolution (if your wondering why a party has such a freaky
name).  It was brilliant < Everything from the way they promoted the party
to the way the warehouse was decorated.  It was the most original 'rave' I
have ever seen.

relevance?

the DJ line up was amazing:  D WYnn (KMS records), Stacey Hale, Kevin
Saunderson, and Richie Hawtin.  Stacey Hale started off with some deep
house, D Wynn played some stompin' techno and acid, Kevin Saunderson played
some freaky house music, and Richie closed with trance and ambient stuff.

truly diverse..  truly amazing..

and the wierdest part of all:  I started skateboarding at about 6 am with a
friend while the crew was cleaning up the warehouse.  Soon, about 20 people
joined in!  I couldn't believe it:  a full on skate session at 7 in the
morning!!!

Yea!! Speaking of Darwyn,   I'm still in the Australian city of Darwyn
as we speak (even have local access to internet :-)

Tommorrow I visit the formost world expert on Crocodiles,  and speaking
of nasty sick beliefs,   Crocs also are very nasty preditors indeed,  and
remind me of other nasty faschist things....   I couldn't help thinking
of all these nasty faschist things as I saw 30 foot Crocs crush pig heads
in their jaws.   HOLY SHIT!!  What a wake up calll!!  to see these things
UP CLOSE (Through very thick glass of course).

Dear All;

	Sorry for the late post, but once again Liberty.com had some mail 
problems, but here it is anyway. Sorry.

Brian

Dear Anais & All;

	Wow!!!, Move was great at 7th & Folsum, I just can't say enough
good things about this venue, comeon guys get it legal, I'll get the
permits me self, ppplleaseeee!!! God knows that I needed to have a good
time, way to stressed, more on that later. Killer music all night long, a
nice intimate space where you can always find room to talk, without
yelling into the person next to you's ear, a house party by any other
name, $5 - $8 to get in for 7 - 8 hours of good times, and the most awsome
massage room I've thus practiced in sooo far, it mite as well been my
office. I actually found the good kind of #, ya know the kind dat gets you
really high, for really long, and you feel ggrreaaattttt!!!, in da
morning, thanks #### for hooking me up. 

	 I was told that this mite be the last of 7th & Folsum, due to the
pol-lice, I hope not. It was great meeting you little Steven, and the
owner who's name I'm forgeting, damm. To Corey(way to sexy, & she gives a
nice massage, then again I'm a slave to loving touch), Sasha, Greg S.(da
"man" from Santi Cruz), Lydia(Horseback Riding for sure girl),the names of
the people I'm forgeting, and especially Karma(dis womyn is just too cool,
I've never met a womyn, who has experienced & done as much of life, both
good & bad, as I have in the short time, we been on the planet, so I'm
impressed(not meant to be egotistical)), thanks for making my night a
little special, by sharing your magnificient presents, and lives with me.
Its soooo hard to find a soul mate, or even a little Shelter from the
Storm, for that matter. 

	Ohh!!, almost forgot, I felt sooo good, I actually went out to an
after party at 111 Minna Street, Gallery. Its really cool, even though I
felt I was on a MTV video shoot set, it just reminds me of a lot of the
back dropping they use on a lot of there videos. I love art, because it
reminds me of how we are all wonderfully unique, different, dark, and
beautiful, masterpieces each of us. The nice thing about art is that I can
take one home with me and keep it, it's mine, unlike people, which for the
most part are unfortuately only temporary in our lives, but no less and
definately more rewarding, and enjoyable. I don't know who or whos
responsible for the visuals at 111 Minna Street Gallery, but they were
better by far than any of the big expensive overhyped "raves" I've been to
ever, and dats a lot. Much more interesting, engauging, approaching almost
3D VR, without having to wear the glasses, it just kinda jumps off the
screen on to you, without the aid of psychedelics, or serious lack of sleep.

	As for me and my status, just takin it one day at a time, and no
I'm not in 12 Step recovery, I took what I liked and left the rest, which
was most, leaving that is. I'll never forget what happened to her, its one
of the those bad life experiences, I hope she's up there dancin in heaven,
to a neverending groove, with no need to ever hurt or feel pain again,
just unconditional love & beauty, all in her vision of happiness & peace.
Its just sad we have one less masterpiece to enjoy & experience, I'm 
sorry if that sounds selfish. Again thanks for all the sweet, concerned & 
wonderful posts, I love ya all just the way you are.

Dear All;

	I'm disappointed that I missed Goa Gill, he's not spinning 
anywhere tonight is he, Well anyway, I still had a great time regardless, 
and wouldn't change it for the world. Was there any indication last night 
whether or not he had tapes or CD's for sale, and if so where or how can 
ya getem. Inquiring minds want to know, thanks.

ps Tristan, we all know how different the scene is between here and
London, thanks to you(nothing negative implied or meant). I would as I'm
sure others would to, **sincerely** :) like to know how we are the same; 
London & SF;  how we are all brothers and sisters, with a common goal &
focus. I would find the similarites much more interesting & astonishing,
than the obvious differences. I just think that emphazing differences
addes to more world dis-harmony, and aren't enough people doing that all
ready, like our governments, and the press. For example we all laugh,
smile, & hug the same way, there's a start. Or aren't you up for the 
challenge???

Dear All;

	For those PC Users out there, I would just like to share some 
brief experiences with the MS Windows 95/Beta Final Release I just got 
promoed to me.

	First of all, its a real pain in the ass to setup. You basically
lose DOS, which may or may not be benefical to you. I have some pretty
werid hardward. VL/EISA 486-DX2-66 with a EISA/ESDI controller 
card.

	It doesn't like to regconize them correctly. Which means you must
use them in DOS Compatibility mode, which is slow slow slow, like .125 of
the maxiumun data ftransfer rate. Though I'm told there will be Protected
Mode drivers available for these devices in the WIN95 street copy. Which
considering that they don't make ESDI drives anymore, and Ultrastor is
coming out of Chapter 11 is actually preety cool thag for them to do,
MS that is.

	It resembles either an OS2 or Mac front end, so much for look
and feel. If your a reseller, you will be able to make a lot of money 
confiquring this system for people, because its comlicated, and I feel 
above the average computer user. You basicaly have to configure all your 
hardward, either manually or though an automatic detection process, but 
everyone likes to tweak peramaters, right???

	It does have a lot of nice features, like built in mail & network
stuff, including fax suppport. Automatic V-Memory support, no more
creating a swap file, yeah!!!!, so make sure you delete the old one,
because it doesn't us it, it dynamic allocates it on the run. If you are a
reseller get this product now and play with it, it will save you the
frustration of tring to fiqure it out while your working on a clients
machince You have to re;load most of your applications, you can load it on
top of your old windows program, but it does work very well, due to the
fact, the longer you have windows working the more junk, it makes and
collects causing windows 95 to misinterput files, addresses ...etc

	Documentation is as always from MS poor, and minimul. Thats it, I 
off to reload it, know that I made a fresh start for me self. Oh, I 
almost forgot. Because you get to make long files names in the new WIN95, 
you can use dos disk tools like Norton Disk Doctor, as these program 
don't know what to do with the large file snames. Be careful, and 
conservative when you setup it up. Try one thing at a time, and make sure 
its working first before you go on to the next. If you have any hardware 
conflicts it will findem and won't work properly.

I can understand the analogy, but please don't equate the instinctual
eating habits of these magnificant creatures to the racist acts of
oppression perpetuated by humans upon one another.  I think you'll find
that unlike the discrimination you recently encountered in Australia,
crocodiles will be happy to crush your head in their jaws irregardless
of your skin color, nationality, or whether you prefer trance over house.
It should also be noted that some species of crocodiles are endangered, 
clearly demonstrating they really aren't nasty at all when compared to 
the predatory behavior of homosapiens.

        umm well sorry for the short post but i would have to add (for
myself at least) looking into the eyes of someone you're getting to know,
and there is a silence, a pause and you're both thinking "should i kiss
him/her" and then, for a breif moment everything stops..and you know, the
kiss is just the icing on the cake...i guess this is sort of like a rave

i would say is a mostly european thing, labels like Harthouse, Labworks and
others) and acid house (robert armani, plastikman) and hard acid (DJ ESP,
stuff on Drop Bass Records, Adam X, etc.) and ambient acid (air liquide,
Higher Intelligence Agency).  I love all of this stuff, showing that one
small little silver box (the 303) can produce a wide variety of tonal
textures and vibes...

        I've noticed a bit of a difference as well b/n sf and ne raves.
Obviously the socio-political repercussions of r*ves are more of a common
topic here (though it does pop up on ne raves) but just as a small
interesting experiment, i thought about the .sigs of ppl on both lists.
Here's an example:

        NE:     KEEP THE SOUND UNDERGROUND AND KEEP IT HARD!!!!
                HARDCORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

and my favorite :)

        SF:     happiness is being around friends

        neat, huh?
        brad

        i guess i'm on both lists cuz my body is in the ne but my soul is
in san fran, ie: i like hard music and hard parties but not hard people

Just as a note, I live very happily with no T.V. and no newspapers....and
pretty much as little media as possible.  I don't seem to miss out on much.
I think media is mostly mind control. IMO.

Precedence: bulk

In the area of cultural evolution, elements of a culture often
demonstrate their fitness to survive by their ability to demonstrate
some kind of value to the forces that dominate human behavior.
 
This is very apparent in Las Vegas, where my parents live.  The big 
hotel/casinos there usually adopt themes based on the following traits:
 
- High degree of sensory stimulation
- A sense of otherwordliness or fantasy
- A theme of power or importance or awe
- Some mystery, but familiar enough to not be fearful
 
Examples: Ceasar's Palace (Roman empire), Luxor (Egyption tombs,
pyramids), Mirage (tropics, volcanoes), Excalibur (knights,
castles, magicians), Treasure Island (Pirate ships, booty), 
MGM Grand (Hollywood, special effects)...
 
So, as a cultural anthropologist, I found myself drawn to the brand
new Hard Rock Cafe Casino.  Here it was at last: Rock'n Roll (and not
just Elvis) at the pinnacle of cultural permanence - now deemed fit to
survive as backdrop fodder for the promotion of the mindless gaming
and the meaningless transfer of wealth that serves as the main form
of entertainment in this town.
 
In Vegas, the culture is all image for the sake of image;  suitably
diluted into colorful wallpaper for simple sensory (i.e. not mental)
digestion.  Amongst the displays of famous leather jackets, guitars
and motorcycles, there was one sight that stood out most of all in
this relatively hip (for a casino, anyway) venue.
 
It was the bank of PURPLE HAZE slot machines.  There he was, Jimi Hendrix, 
his head surrounded by the swirls of a psychedelic cloud, his eyes rolled 
up to capture the moment of "'scuse me while I kiss the sky."  My eyes
were drawn to the big letters that spelled out a slang term for LSD. Safer 
than the white tigers in the Mirage's plexiglass cage.  But at least the
world will get a little more exposed to what the Voodoo Child was about,
I thought.  But then I realized that the old lady pushing quarters into
Jimi's face probably would never even know what instrument he played.
 
So I hear that Paramont is now building a casino theme park based 
on Star Trek, another childhood inspiration of mine.  I suppose in 15
years, the "successful" integration of Raving into the mainstream will
result in the Raveland Hotel And Casino or somesuch, where I'll be able
to throw coins into an Ecstacy slot machine, and bet my paycheck
on Empathy roulette before catching a techno act in the Megatripolis  
lounge.
 
Where humans control selection, the fit do not survive nearly as much
as the survivors are made to fit.
 
Lee

For an interesting perspective on who's setting our national media 
agenda, go see "Manufacturing Consent," a 
film that documents Noam Chomsky's take on the U.S. media, the 
military-industrial complex, and their various games and deceptions.  
Fascinating (and frightening) stuff. "Manufacturing Consent" plays 
periodically at the Red Vic and Roxie in SF and, I believe, at the 
Pacific Film Archives (?) in Berkeley.

as a complete alternative to darwinism, may i suggest anyone with
  a slight scientific inclination try reading the book "gaia", by
    Joseph Lawrence (that name may be way off)

anyway, it's a chronology of Lovelock and Margulis' work on the
  notion that the planet is a single living organism, and that
    life evolves for the purpose of sustaining a livable biosphere,
      and not necessarily out of competition...

if that ain't pronoid, i don't know whut iz!!!

That's what happens when something is dead (25+ years, in this case)...

the buzzards come in and rip out a few chunks.

Then the blowflies move in, then the maggots, then eventually the fungi.
Soon whatever Once Meaningful Thing was alive is now a seething mass of
mass-market memetic takeover, shedding pop-culture viruses and media-
parasites by the millions.

If something is fundamentally weak and sickly, the same can happen while
it is still (barely) alive.

A healthy, viable scene doesn't have to worry about being co-opted like this.
Usually they succumb to 'hipness disease', which causes otherwise thriving
organisms to commit suicide upon being discovered by the buzzards, blowflies,
maggots, or even another scene.

People have predicted the 'death of rave' for many years.  If it does die, 
we'll all know, because we will have let it die.

I fear those forces are pretty fucking powerful ones - they are embedded
deep in our human psyche (ego, super-ego, id).  Perhaps thats why they
survive.  Some of these forces show themselves in our human desire
for love, compassion, friendship, communication, etc.  Others are more
powerful - our base human cravings for sex, power, murder etc.  Society
is created and bound by social contracts intended to restrain such cravings
as they are manifested as rape, murder, theft, etc.  I think our cravings
don't disappear as quickly as we would like though.  In addition to
surviving in society  - murder is age old and still with us - they mutate.
Our glutton yields a toxic waste.  And thus we have Ceasar's Palace.

	Just wanted to add to this discussion:  there's a book out called
_10000 reasons to be happy_ which started as journal when the autor was about
seven (the details are fuzzy) that is literally 10000 entries much like what
amy mentioned above.  Just flipping through it, you can't help but smile :-).

take care,

*laughs* that's one of the most amusing mental images I've had in a while.
I know it sounds pretty scary to some ... but imagining a huge tourist in a
flowered shirt with a camera trying to dance the lambada to Trancesetters
while snapping shots of the showgirls wearing silver skintight t-shirts and
little braids blowing bubble gum ..... how can you NOT laugh?

There is a subset in the San Francisco rave community that likes goa trance 
and really cosmic parties, sort of a bit of Floppies people, Spaz people and 
that Euro-traveller south-east asia Island hopping , bindi wearing peoples. 
They tell each other and I must say we found out very indirectly.

Sure!!   Terrain is mostly flat up around the northern coast.   Lots of
coconut palms,  low shrubs,  some large trees,  like banyon trees,  sand
palms,   etc.    Well,  here we're supposed to be entering the dry season,
but while I've been here,  it's warm humid thunderstorms.   I'm amazed
at how little regard people have while swimming during lightning storms.
No coral reefs,   but smooth sand.   No surf on this coast,  as this
portion of the Indian Ocean is similar to the Mississippi gulf coast.
Little or no surf to speak of.    Water kinda murkey on or near the
beach,   but clears up out past 100 meters.   Tides are VERY HIGH.  about
7 meters difference,  and turn every six hours.

Bathurst and Melville Islands... Very picturesque tropical islands,  owned
by the Tiwi clan (Aborigionals).   Very first attempt to colonize Melville
failed because of the agression of the Tiwi people.   Quite physical,  more
attractive compared to mainland aborigionals.   Excellent fishing,  lots of
crocs.

Fishing reorts are really nice.   Lots of fresh water lagoons,  for swimming.
Pockets of monsoonal forests.   Thax to Ian (My tourguide) for being here to
answer your questions.

Oh!  No real mountains,   some coral reefs on the islands.   We are about
12 degrees S. Latitude (well into the tropics).

what's really interesting is that obviously a lot of monkeys chose *not* 
to try the mushrooms and *all* humans are descended from monkeys who took 
psychedelic mushrooms for generations (according to terence, this is)

I often feel when i'm playing with a few freinds that those other monkeys 
are still hanging out up in their trees and shouting down to us "don't 
touch that stuff, come on back up in the trees, it's not *safe* down 
there!  don't mess with that evolution stuff"

^^I love all of this stuff, showing that one
small little silver box (the 303) can produce a wide variety of tonal
textures and vibes...^^

what are u crazy. the 303 is THE most overated underutilized peice of kit 
in existence. you would think the people using it could a least twiddle 
more the just the 3 knobs they use. most of the current music is rely on 
the 'acid', not much content. it's a gimmick the world is subscribing 
too, fuckin peice is going for 1000 and up. i got one for 50 in 92. 
nobody cared about them then. i wish producers would focus a little more 
on the rest of the tune rather than letting the 303 take command (don't 
laugh, sugar: we've heard it before)

since I coined the word (in 1987 I think) I suppose it's for me to define it.
I first used tecnoshaman in that year to decribe the DJs role in the 
Rave.  "harmonic navigator" is a term we started using in 
megatripolis/London last year.  
basically the DJ is in charge of the group mood/mind.  he senses when 
it's time to lift the mood, take it down, etc just as the shaman did in 
the good ol' tribal days (which are still very much alive, of course, 
outside the west)

tecnoshamanism has a wider meaning.  think of it this way.  a shaman 
can't really opeate with more than say 20 people over a period.  if you 
reckon that every raver today is responsible for getting 20 people into 
RC then their job is personal shaman.
tecnoshamanism is using the technology, media (despite what some think) 
to help spread the vibe, the meme, sketching out a rough map for the trek 
ahead of them

need to stop.  I've been a bit sick this last week and I'm way behind on 
fololowing sfraves.

I've listened to much of Terrance M's. words and just saw him speak in
Sacramento a couple of weeks ago.  His theories are very believable and well
researched.  I've had no problem relating to things I've heard him say.  It
takes an open mind though.

I might also add that 1559 is not a large space. In fact it is a small 
space. (Durr, logic kicking in again) as opposed to a medium space or not 
so large a space. I don't know if the Floppies ever post on the net but I 
do know that last sat they had turn people away at peak hours. I think 
the lack of netage may be due to space limitations...

	interesting! would you care to elaborate? I not a HUGE proponet 
of TM, after all his favorite combo is DMT and LSD. He does believe 
psillycibon originated from outerspace (OK, so maybe I believe it but it 
is outlandish) and he says Belladona was not ment to be taken (utter 
bull.) So, no I do not bow before the psychedic glory of Terrence 
McKenna. It would be interesting to know why you don't either.

see what happens!  

Well, it was a thought anyway!!

: Acurate information from the news ? Seldom happens except for saying things

This is all exactly right on.

But, it isn't a conspiracy, it has to do with what sort of person *wants* to
be
a journalist, combined with the whole process of putting out a regular
product.

They have to fill up the whole newspaper or the whole hour on TV/radio, 
regardless of how much actually happened.  They are afraid to go out to
report on something and then tell the editor it was a false alarm, nothing
really happened....

Yes, the further science/engineering gets from things like building 
bridges, the less accurate it is.

Pure Consciousness is the basis for everything. 

It is not in time and space.

It did not derive from anything physical, rather the other way around.

Think about yourself.  What is most basic about you?  Awareness,
consciousness.

The rave/vibe experience and philosophy (PLUR) makes much more sense from
this perspective than the scientific materialist one.

Subject: Re: funny message

Thought you might appreciate this, if you haven't seen it already;
it's from an (obviously geeky) comics newsgroup:

Spider-Man could beat Jesus! I haven't read all of Jesus' appearances,
but I think I can state from what I've read of them from Jesus collectors
here on the newsgroup that this thing would be possible.

First off, all of the old Jesus writers really didn't know his character.
That's because they're not writing him today. Jesus has never shown the
ability to resist a punch capable of shattering steel in his face! You'd
think that if the Jesus writers wanted him to be able to survive such
a punch, they'd have put him in a situation where they could show that.

So I don't go by the old Jesus appearances. But let's not argue back
issues, because I don't have any. Let's just consider Spider-Man:

1. Spider-Man has reflexes much faster than any human. Jesus is supposed
to be a god, yes, but he's also, more importantly, a man. And Spider-Man
is faster than a lot of gods, anyway, as shown by his defeat of Firelord
and Thanos. Spider-Man could react really quickly to anything Jesus
would like to do.

2. Spider-Man has his spider-sense, which will allow him the ability to
react to Jesus before Jesus can even throw a punch! This, combined with
his speed, makes Spider-Man easily capable of beating Jesus.

3. Spider-Man's web-shooters. I'd like to see Jesus multiply fish by
magic when he's trying to concentrate with a big glob of webbing in
his face! Especially when Spider-Man starts whipping him around with
his super-strength, I don't think Jesus will be able to do much about
that.

The way I see it, though, it could be an even match if they fought
outside a city or someplace. I mean, Spider-Man needs buildings
to swing on, and big trees aren't all that useful, since Jesus could
just curse them and make them wither away. And out on a lake Jesus
would win, since he could walk out over the water where Spider-Man
couldn't reach him! Well, except for his web-shooters, but I don't
know if I'm allowed to actually combine arguments into a coherent
whole. Hmm. This is a puzzler, no doubt!

And anyway, Jesus knows a lot more about surviving in the desert
than Spider-Man. Spider-Man could hide in a basement, however, until
the sandstorms pass, and then he could use his spider-sense to find
Jesus and pound his face in. Perhaps if Jesus snuck up on Spider-Man
in the basement with a crowbar, though, Jesus could take him out. After
all, Aunt May once did that, and that was because Spider-Man's spider-
sense didn't recognize her as a threat! And if there's one thing Jesus
ain't to Spider-Man, it's a threat! Well, it could work, but that was
actually written by an older writer, so maybe he didn't know anything,
anyway. If lead pipes were supposed to exist in Spider-Man comics,
you'd think the writers would show them occasionally, but since they
don't, it's obvious that crowbars aren't supposed to exist in Spider-Man
comics.

Really, most of Jesus' powers are really lame. I mean, he could make
Spider-Man drunk before the battle by changing all the water in his
building to wine, and his ability to cast out demons is pretty cool
(Jesus vs. Ghost Rider would be an awesomely kool match!), but Spider-Man
is fast, and, you see, that means he's basically fast, which means
he will win, because that's the way the writers have it nowadays.


And also:

If A=6, B=12, C=18, D=24, and so on until Z=156, then add up the values of
the word COMPUTER.  You get 666.  Hmmmmm.  But, what TYPE of computer?
Add up the values of the words IBM PC CLONES... you get 666 again!


This person went onto insist that he was not a freak.

Which one do you think would have more fun at a rave?

Hard for me to decide, but I think spiderman could dance longer.
And I think Jesus would have to get a better pair of shoes, unless the 
rave was on the beach somewhere.

Hi all,

Except for finals the semester is now over for me.  This is great news but it also means I lose my
account.  If I am lucky I will be getting hooked up at home but its still up in the air.  Thanks for
the great conversation and I hope to run into all of you at raves this summer.  Which, by the way,
is going to be one awesome summer!  Can you feel the vibe building up?   

PLUR

chris

ps I think San Francisco has an incredible vibe because of its position on the North American Plat.
All that tectonic power is creating energy that spews into our bodies (which have recepticles that
are turned on by house music).

        i too have mixed feelings about mr. mckenna.  I disagree with his
emphasis on the use of psychedelics to reach states that may be obtained
'naturally' (ok ok i mean without ingesting anything)...and i also beleive
that he's pretty anti-MDMA (it being a chemical, after all) and i find that
this is something that's missing out on a lot of his
socio-political-evolutionary raps.
        Then again, he says that what a lot of humans see as 'un-natural'
(cities, factories, humans themselves, etc) are just the 'cutting edge of
nature' so i think i'd lump chemicals in with that..

No music...but great visuals! This Saturday is Guest Day 95 at McClellan
AFB, 7am-9pm.

SEE...

10:45am  Security police drug dog demo :)
12:20pm  AV-8 Harrier (or) F-111 flyby
12:35    A-10 ground attack demo (real bullets..watch a tank be disintegrated!)
12:55    U-2 flyby (they practice out here... I think they sound neat)
 1:45    F-16 demo
 2:10    Apache gunship ground attack demo

See the drab building where I work! See my apartment (if you want..).

Guest day is free and open to the public. Easiest way in is to take I-80
out of the bay, stick with I-80 Reno (not business 80). About 20 miles
past the Yolo Causeway, take the Winters Rd. exit, and turn left. The
gate is about 1 mile ahead. If you miss Winters Rd., take the Watt
exit, turn left, and about 1 1/2 miles are more McClellan gates.

If anyone wants to crash at my place Friday night, send me email by
5pm Friday.

Sorry for lack of rave content, but I thought someone else might not
want to miss the chance to see these demos... :)

I dunno ... I personally think Spiderman dresses in trippier clothes ...
though it WOULD be hard for him to enjoy a pacifier.

I am vnsvbbing for the summer, heading up to Washington to work.  If you 
need to get in touch with me, this is the place to do it at.

Orbitrecords' second release will be out in about 3 weeks or so.  If you 
like blissful digifunk and/or techno with a drop of acid, this one might 
make you smile.  If you are interested, let me know.

Ok, take it easy.

Wait.  I heard that two major warrior types in the upcoming Gibson-short-
story-turned-movie _Johnny Mnemonic_ are represented by Henry Rollins (as a 
character named "Spider") and Dolph Lundgren (as an assassin member of some 
"Jesus" cult).

Is this the geeky comic book reference?

Now Rollins might be able to outrave Lundgren, but would probably do the 
skinhead stomp all over the vibe.

But then you also have to ask who would bring more cheer, and I can tell 
you right now that Jesus probably radiates a lot more positive energy 
than Spiderman ever does.  Just think of what kind of a smile the guy has!

Recently I've been seeing this really cool show on the Discovery show 
called The Brain or something like that, and besides some of the best 
computer graphics I've ever seen (The beginning and ending credits mostly 
- blew me away), the show is actually very cool.  They look at a lot of 
different aspects of the brain, such as how psychoreactive drugs effect 
it, and how fasting and sensory deprivation causes hallucinations.  It 
was very non-biased, and they actually interviewed this painter who takes 
acid to help him pain.  I can't remember his name, but his work looked 
very familiar.  Anyway, it's pretty cool, and worth checking out.  It's 
on Wednesdays at 10 pm, on Discovery (Channel 36 in San Francisco), and 
I'm pretty sure that it's on other times too.

Well here is what my experiences with this weekly have been:

in short:

1  the doorguy is an asshole:  I brought 4 friends of mine to 'DUST' last
week and we all had Michigan ID's.  He accused us all of having fake id's.
He even called one of our 21 year old friends a "19 year old".

2  the girls at the door wouldn't let anyone play pool even though nobody
was dancing!  So what do you do?  Sit around and do nothing? (so fucking
boring this place is)

3  The venue sucks:  it reminds me of Dennys with the lights out and a
sound system in the kitchen.  It's kinda like a hotel bar or something.

4  The bartender refused all of us drinks for the rest of the night because
she accused us of having fake id's also.  My girlfriend and I have lived in
California for 9 months now.  We use our Michigan ID everywhere in SF and
*NEVER* have any problems.

5  Why was she complaining about us buying drinks anyway?  There was only
10 other people there to buy drinks?!  How else were they gonna make money?

6  Speaking of money:  I take back the part about making money.. they
charged 5 bucks cover!!  It should of been free cuz it sucked so bad.

7  MUSIC:  The music wasn't any different than anything else going on that
night.. So why go to that club?

8  The only thing that was decent was the light setup.  Except for the fact
that there were too many for a 10' by 10' dance area.  By the way, the
light guy was from Michigan, how come nobody gave him a hard time? :)

9  all in all:  the venue sucks, the people are rude, if you look
young;watch out, the dJ's were o.k., the lights were o.k., the vibe..
there was no vibe, and 5 people dancing?

but hey..  everyone else might of liked it..      ?


Jon

SF is one of momma terra's nipples.

To locate the other, see one of Geoff White's recent postings :) 

Has anyone been to Bros.+Sisters'? What do you think of this as a party
for some first-timers? I've got a group of friends who expressed interest
and am considering this as our destination. If it's anything like other
1015 events, I don't think I'll be accused of boring anyone...

Hello everyone.  I have been on this list for a while but this is my
first post.  So let me start by asking a question which might concern
me in the near future:

How well do the (standard?) drug tests detect MDMA/ MDA?  How long
does one have to be clean to avoid testing positive?  Is there some
substance that helps clean one's system and thus makes this time
period shorter?  Finally, are there designer drugs with similar
effects to MDMA that are not detectable by drug tests?

Thanks.

you'd be surprised

i read in an early rollins novel
about him touring in the old days with black flag
that he said that he prefered the way the girls in the audience
were getting into the music
mostly because they moved with the beats

and the guys, on the other hand,
just ran around in circles and bumped into each other

Well I found a great compilation album called "Concept in Dance" put out by Moonshine 
records that you should give a try :)  But one thing about definitions in types of music 
out there that really is a pain is words like Acid/Trance or Ambeient.  If a band calls 
themselves Orb then there ya go, Orb.... leave it at that.. ;-)
Peace and Respect

>i see on my map that there are two islands off the coast, too...
>
>what are they like?

Well,  in answer to your previous question you asked me a few days ago,
You're in luck..   I just got back from Bathurst Island today.   Now I
can really tell you about it.    I also took a lot of pictures on one
of those disposable 35 MM camaras.   I hope to scan them in so I can
put them up on my web page.

Bathurst Island is the smaller of the two islands.   The larger Island
was on the tour,   but due to the wet season staying on a lot longer
than expected (probably because of me,  and all the rain I bring with
me).

The Tiki Aborigional people own the Island,  which was origionally discovered
by the Dutch in the late 1800's.   The Dutch tried to conquer the folks
living on the Island back in those times,  thus the Tiki people has had
to learn how to fight to keep their land,  thus are famious for being very
agressive and hostile,  and have learned how to make effective weapons
designed for gorilla warfare.

In WW 2,  when the Japanese bombed Darwyn,  a lone radio operator on
Bathurst radioed the warning,   but it was put down,  and essentially
ignored,  or shrugged off as American.

Historically,  Darwyn has been literally wiped out by the Japanese during
the war.   The USA,  hasn't entered the war at this stage.

Since that time,  the Catholic Mission has established the Cathlic religion
and integrated it into their OWN culture.   In fact,  the Tiki say that
they had incorperated Cathlic religion into their Culture.

They make pottery,  water bowls,  and live entirely off the plants that
grow there.   Their knowledge the planlife is exemplarary.   They are also
not that anxious to share their knowledge.   The land is the same as the
mainland,  with typical tropical plants like coconut palms,  Mango trees,
plus the plants in the bush.

As we were driving along,   one of the Aborigional women yelled for us to
stop.   She quickly got out of the vehicle and headed out into the bush.

She stopped in front of a tree,  and pointed out a frilled lizard (Which
they regard as a delecacy).   I swear,  that tree must have been at least
150 meters off the road.    She "Whacked" it with a stick,  picked it up
by the tail,  and whacked it against the tree,  and handed it to me and the
rest of us who were out on this tour for close inspection.   Now I know
why they don't get close to the head when it's alive.

You had asked if there were any reefs.   Well,  I was on the sourthern
side of the island,   but as I was coming in from the air,   I could see
the northern side,  and it didn't have that turquoise color that a reef
has, when seen from the air.   In fact,  the water looked murkey along
the shore,   and it's very dangerious to swim there,  because of the
stingies,  crocs,  and sharks.   stingie is Aus-speak for sting ray.

Aussies like the "ee" words.   Ekkie,  stubbie,  smartie,   etc.

The day was stickey and hot...  no breeze,   just hot muggy tropical
yukk!!   The last 3 days,   my energy has been zilch!!   Not used to
this climate.

The night before,  went to Darwyn's sunset market.   They had massage
tables,  live music,  and was near a beach.   Nobody was in the water,
dispite the water temperature of 86 degrees.  Warmest ocean water I've
ever experienced.    At night,  I walk down to the water,  and a waft
of warm air comes from the waves.   I stick my hand in,  and it was
just as warm as bath water.   It's almost two warm to swim in,  anyway.
learned why nobody was swimming.   Stingies were out in force.

Anyway,  I head back to Sydney tommorrow for Totum (Good acid trance),
to get my pictures processed and scanned.

Simple fact.  Clubs that get busted for serving minors get heavilly fined

Hmmm...  Nobody dancing?  Better to play pool.  Wouldn't want to be the
first one caught dancing.

Beleive it or not some people like smaller parties.  The best parties I've
been to have been small ones.

He owns the bar.  See reply to your first complaint.

I'm sure the welfare of the bar was your greatest concern.

Oooo...  5.00 is pretty steep for a party.

If more suporitive people (unlike yourself) would go it would be a great
intmate party...  Not to mention it's the one of the only parties in town
dedicated to trance.

I'm sure Dave appreciates your constructive criticism.

The venue is strange, but no worse than DV8 or many other clubs in the city.
The 21 and is admittedly annoying.  The Dj line ups looking quite good.  The
people who throw this party are some of the nicest I've met at any Party.
The DJ's play for free, they're not making any money and the promoter...
Well she's taking a loss.  The vibe?  The vibe is what YOU make it.  The
people involved are working damn hard to get this party going, and if you
don't appreciate it i'm sure they'ed love some constructive feedback.  There
are definetly more positive ways to influence your environment than defaming
someone elses cration.   

>but hey..  everyone else might of liked it..      ?

Considering the tone of your message I can only consider the last as a final
sarcastic attack.  I know quite a few people who like dust; I'm sorry you've
decided not to be one of them.  I encourage anyone who enjoys smaller
parties to experience dust first hand and see for yourself what it's all
about.  And for those like Jon maybe you'll like us after we've grown a bit
more :)

Hey all you beautiful people!!
Look for me this weekend!  I'll be most likely at Basics this Saturday 
(or Progress)....so look for me and say "HI!"

I'm about 5'6" and I'm a long, straight haired brunette.  I'll be wearing 
a funky sleeveless white shirt with bright green trim (groovin'!) and and 
old pair of comfy jeans - my favorite!  I want to go to Sunset, but not 
if it's all the way in Santa Cruz again - too far to drive from Sac.  So 
if it's closer, I'll be there too.  
I'm dyin' ta party, since Friends and Family was my last "real" rave...

love,
Amy

I think the doorguy is part of the venue, not part of the Dust crew, who
are all really, really cool people. Don't juge them by one experience. I
had no problems when I went even though one of my friends who's 22 looks
like she's about 17. Maybe he was just having a bad night or the SFPD had
stopped by earlier or something.

I don't get that - if they let you in, they shouldn't be checking ID's again.

My impression of Dust is that it's a more acid an techno oriente club,
which is different than what you'll fin anywhere else on Friday night. 1015
will be much more housey, and that's about it for regular Friay clubs.

It will show up as an amphetamine in drug tests. You should be ok 48 hours
after ingestion although I beleive it can occasionally be detected up to
96. That's for a urine test, dunno about hair.

I think that's what everyone there was thinking seeing that there was only
3 or 4 people dancing and everyone else was sitting down.  I came with
about 10 people total and it was so boring that none of us wanted to dance,
so instead of wasting our money, we decided to play pool. (even though it's
not my favorite game.)

I said *NOTHING* about the size. I like small parties as well.  I was
talking about the way the place looked (like a restaurant) and the mood
(like dennys)

It was a she by the way, so I don't think she was the owner...

>I'm sure the welfare of the bar was your greatest concern.

You know what?  I rarely drink alcohol, so drinking wasn't really a concern
of mine.  I was just upset with the way I was treated by everybody.   Who
gives a shit about drinking!!  I love to dance, but nothing in this place
made me dance (the music, vibe, venue, etc...)

>>6  Speaking of money:  I take back the part about making money.. they
>>charged 5 bucks cover!!  It should of been free cuz it sucked so bad.

>Oooo...  5.00 is pretty steep for a party.

No, that's not steep for a party, but it's certainly a rip-off for that
club you call a 'club'.  I don't think anyone should pay to get in at all!
Like I said, it's just like going into any hotel bar thats got a discotech.
I remember this bar my parents used to go to that played Barbara Streisand
and Micheal Jackson.  It was called 'Bahama Mamas'.  That's what DUST
reminds me of.

Why should I or anyone else who enjoys a good party support something that
SUCKS!

Dave does a great job.

I love small parties.  SMALL GOOD PARTIES.  Obviously, this was a small
shitty party.  Face it, sometimes people throw small shitty parties.  I'm
not saying it will always be shitty.  I'm saying it was shitty the last two
times I went.  I'm not trying to piss you off.  this message was originally
posted to share my experiences with others.

p.s.  I also encourage those of you who haven't gone to go and check it out

Hey, I like dust. 

I've met some really cool people there.  Usually end up talking to
more people there than at other parties because it's small and quit
enough in the booths to talk.

I think the space is pretty cool.  The arched ceiling and the mirrors work
great with the lights.  The dance floor is small but when I've been there
there's usually 20 people or so dancing.

For a kinda mellow trancy evening I think it's great.

Hey Jon!

Chill, man.  Your tone is too fucking harsh for a Friday.  You didn't like
Dust...got it.  'Nuff said.  You don't need to grind it into the ground
like a kid stepping on a bug.  Others have gone and enjoyed it.  I am going
tonight no matter what you say, because contrary to your opinion, the DJ
line-ups are quite impressive, especially since they're playing pro-bono.

It's unfortunate you got hassled at the door (and the bar).  The price of
looking young; one day you'll appreciate it.  As you said, last time the
doorwoman was cool.  Maybe the guy at the door had poison oak or something
and was feeling a bit testy.  These things suck, but they happen and must
be taken with a grain...(or a gram, for that matter :^).

>Why should I or anyone else who enjoys a good party support something that
>SUCKS!

That's not nice.  :^(

>Dave does a great job.

That's nice.   :^)

>I have also worked my but off to throw parties since 1992.  I know what
>it's like.  but> I always made sure that everyone that was working at the
>event was super cool and friendly.

That's GREAT!  I can't wait.  Listen, I promise you that we'll all review
your Super Cool and Friendly party in the perfect venue with perfect
workers with absolutley unbiased opinions.

Let us know when it is!

Tony

P.S.  Sorry for the sarcasm, but the truth of the matter is, I'm certain
the people from Dust are working hard to create the best weekly party they
can.  They deserve both support and criticism, but they don't deserve
obnoxious, unconstructive bashing such as:  >Why should I or anyone else
who enjoys a good party support something that SUCKS!

That's not what this news group's about.  We're friends here and we should
treat eachother as such...

Have a great weekend gang....*twirl*...Out!

Yea so Jon wa a little harsh but I think you guys should lay off him...
 sfraves is such a "politicaly correct" list when it comes to party
reviews...  maybe this has to do with the promoter presance?  I have never
been to dust so I have no opinion obviously on the party,  I do have an
opinion on the post.  Im glad someone finaly posted a review that did not
have all of these clarifications about how everyone "tried sooo hard" etc.
etc.  I personaly like to see the real un censord reviews like this...  Im
sure this is the same thing jon would have told any of his friends  not some
net version compiled to not hurt anyones feelings.  I think if you thought a
party sucked and you were treated badly then you should be alowed to say so
without being flamed.  OK so here is my main point: )  the problem I see with
the SF scene is that there are too many rules now.  It is almost to the point
that if you don't medditate before you go to arave you are not a "true"
raver.  The scene here has lost a lot of energy...  more so than other parts
of the country.  Yes I know there are still good things goin on but I would
love to talk to someone who can _show_ me that it is still goin off like it
was 2 years ago. (and I do not mean just one party but the scene as a whole)
 SF is considered to be different by most people than other parts of the
country because of the _heavy_ emphasis on the spiritual side of raves,  I
just wonder if this is not corralated to the scene losing energy?  The rave
scene in SF is not as RAW as it was...  I mean god forbid anyone play
anything techno...  it's gotta be DEEP or super deep spiritula tribal trance.
 I think a lot of people droped out of the scene because too many new age or
whatever things were being pushed on them.  Remember raves when ther were no
"rules" no politicaly correct social image?  That was when EVERYONE could
come and just be.  That is what makes that old time rave feeling happen...
 not crystals or alters (those work for some people but not everyone wants to
be involved with that)  Old raves had this danything goes vibe that let
people forget about all the bullshit images that they normaly felt required
to uphold,   now SF raving has it's own image to uphold.  Watch out!  If you
don't fit in with our idea of what a great spiritual thing rave "is" then we
think you are neg energy and we don't wanna talk to you...  From talking to
other people around the country I don't think this attittude is as bad as it
is in SF.  I think it is great Jon said what he really felt!  I do not care
if most SF ravers consider it bad karma to be neg. about any party...  go
ahead and disagree with Jon that is fair too...  I just think it is week to
attack him for being "neg."  I would think all of you "possitive" ravers
would want to help poor negative jon with some possitive vibes: )
See ya

Yay!  I hope I find you!  I am *always* looking forward to hearing new

Fraser Clark <fraser@megatripolis.org>:
| what's really interesting is that obviously a lot of monkeys chose *not* 
| to try the mushrooms and *all* humans are descended from monkeys who took 
| psychedelic mushrooms for generations (according to terence, this is)
| 
| I often feel when i'm playing with a few freinds that those other monkeys 
| are still hanging out up in their trees and shouting down to us "don't 
| touch that stuff, come on back up in the trees, it's not *safe* down 
| there!  don't mess with that evolution stuff"

On the other hand (devils advocate here), look at how bad "our" group
of monkeys have messed up the earth. I don't think the monkeys in the
trees have ever knowingly and willingly killed ecosystems, perpretrated
mass genocide, invent and *use* weapons of mass destruction against
themselves....

But maybe that's because we lost our way as "modern culture" (or
whatever it is that we've been doing for the last 4000 years) led us
down the garden path... forcing us to stray too far from that mushroom
patch / garden of eden.

So perhaps the moral of the story is "eat of the forbidden fruit, or
you'll end up in some zoo flingin' shit at passers-by" ... 

-- Niels.

PS: I hear there's an upcoming movie called "Twelve Monkeys", and I
vaguely recall hearing something w/r/t the concept of the "twelfth
monkey" mentioned on this list a while ago. I even more vaguely
remember that this was from some book that someone found rave-relevant
or inspiring.  The movie is about a time travelling dude that hunts
down viral/bacterial disease outbreaks before they do major damage.
What's the connection, if any? Does the movie have anything to do with
the book? Am I confabulating and confused?

PPS: speaking of potential germ warfare gone awry (ebola anyone?), I
read in the paper that scientists recently revived 135 million year old
bacteria that had gone dormant (spore) and have noticed that they are
quite resistant to "fungal pathogens" (which, reading between the
lines, is a gentle way of saying that they're "antibiotic resistant").
The bacteria are from 70 million years before the dinosaurs went
extinct, and were revived from the stomach of a bee that had been
preserved in amber (petrified tree sap)...

Listen:  Instead of just saying 'it sucked' I stated reasons why I did not
enjoy myself!!  Are you trying to tell me that I cannot complain about
something?

>Others have gone and enjoyed it.  I am going
>tonight no matter what you say,

I never told you not to go...  THis is a public forum where we can share
ideas, feelings, opinions, etc..  I was sharing an opinion with you.

We would like to hear John Williams tonite, but we won't because of the way
we were all treated..

>That's not nice.  :^(

If you got your pizza 2 hours late, would you be nice?  If a store wouldn't
let you return an item that was damaged, would you complain?
You don't have to be nice if you don't want to.  Again, I am not a negative
person, I was just telling fellow SFRAVERS what happened that night.


>That's GREAT!  I can't wait.  Listen, I promise you that we'll all review
>your Super Cool and Friendly party in the perfect venue with perfect

>Let us know when it is!

What the heck are you talking about?  You make it sound like it's so
difficult to have friendly people help for a party?  I didn't say anything
about having perfect venues all the time, nor did I say that parties should
be at perfect venue.  You would be surprised how easy (for promoters, party
helpers, etc.) it is to be nice to your clientel.  IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT.

>P.S.  Sorry for the sarcasm, but the truth of the matter is, I'm certain

you obviously didn't read a few sentences before that.  He was saying that
I should support 'DUST' even if I disliked it.  I know they are working
hard to do DUST, but why didn't anyone pay attention to the matter at hand,
even when I brought it up right then and there with the people at the
door!!!!

THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT WHAT I HAD TO SAY,  so I decided to post the
incident on SFRAVES; and thankfully <people are listening.

>That's not what this news group's about.  We're friends here and we should
>treat eachother as such...

Excuse me?  This list (i thought) was to share opinions and ideas dealing
with the SFRave scene.  I treat people like friends, but there's nothing
wrong with me telling you about a bad experience I had.  I don't always
have to be a happy hippie rave camper especially after I had a bad time!  I
have the right to tell the whole world how I feel!

Yeah?  Can't I state my opinions and tell people why I felt that way!  I
supported my thoughts with facts and some opinions.  I didn't just say
'DUST SUCKS' and that's it.  I'm sure the Dust Crew is a bunch of cool
people, I didn't say I hated them did I?  I just stated what happened to me
and my friends and I commented on the party!  Is that a crime?  I'm really
not a negative person but if someone serves me soup with a fly in it.. I'm
gonna complain!!!!!

Actually, I want to hear people's flames.  This is a public forum, and as
much as I wanna talk about how I didn't enjoy something, I would like to
hear feedback, good or bad..

The spiritual side of SF makes SF unique, but I don't like the fact that
parties aren't that diverse out here (right now).  Hate to say this
but>I've noticed that in SF, the 'rave' crowd is primarily white.  It seems
like Latino's got their own thing, Blacks got their own thing, Gays got
their own thing, Asians got their own thing etc.etc.  This is not meant to
be a 'racial' statement, it's just an observation.

Ah hell, I always enjoy seeing bandwidth taken up by worthwhile information
instead of long pointless flames .... but if the answer is NO from the

Well - I'm just assuming in this case.  I heard that Sunsets happen every 
2 weeks til summer.  And the last one was 2 weeks ago - so.....

I don't know the location.  The info # is (415) 985-5264.  All's I can 
say is that I *hope* there is one - just look at this gorgeous weather!!
If anyone has any other info on it, let us know!!

 It would be OK by me , with the following hints:

1. Mr. Eisner , your posts seem to consistently have lines of text that
   seem somewhat long - resulting in "wrapping" to the next line. I don't
   know what the capabilities are of the word processor you are using, but
   maybe you can arrange things so that your email has less than 80
   characters per line. It makes for easier reading!

2. You could have the text put somewhere in hyperreal's ftp archives. Those
   who can ftp to other sites can get the file if they want, and others
   could get it emailed to them. 12 pages don't seem too long to me though,
   so emailing it straight to the SFRaves list doesn't seem too bad to
   me.

Jonathan,

I think that we all understand how you feel.  I feel for you that you did not 
enjoy yourself.  It seems that this continued thread is adding to that unhappy 
feeling.  Please don't take this the wrong way, no one here believes that you 
don't have the right to express your opinion, but I feel that we are really 
trying to create a community based on acceptance, love, understanding and a 
good vibe.  My best suggestion, let it all go.  You had a bad time and this is 
only continuing that negative feeling.  Brighten up, there are lots of other 
good parties.  Go out and enjoy yourself doing something you love and come 
back and share all of that good energy with us.

I hope you have a fabulous weekend.  

Drop to the pulse of life....
Love Anais

Why We Get High

By Bruce Eisner

Almost all of us have gotten high.  Each of us might have a different
 name the experience--getting stoned or tripping or having a session or 
going on vision quest or partying--but the urge to switch channels,  and move to
 another and less usual state of consciousness is as old as our species itself.
  Actually this quest is even older!

Eons before humans found their first psychactive plant, Ronald Seigal, in his book, 
Intoxication,  documents numerous animal species that get high, or as he calls the 
the state achieved,  "intoxication." He also describes similar intoxications among a
 variety of human cultures, past and present.  Seigal proposes that after food, drink
 and sex, Intoxication is the fourth drive. He demonstrates--through the study of animals that
 intoxicate themselves  and drug use among a variety of human cultures--evidence that the urge to
 get high is among the most basic of motivations. 

Andrew Weil MD and Wilfred Rosen, in their wonderful  book
>From Chocolate to Morphine -- explaining psychoactive drugs to the young -- reaffirm this idea. 
 They point out:
	Human beings it seems, are born with the need for periodic variations
in consciousness.  The behavior of young children supports this idea.  Infants rock
 themselves into blissful states, many children discover that whirling or spinning is a
 powerful technique to change awareness, some also experiment with hyperventilation 
(rapid deep breathing) followed by mutual chest squeezing or choking, and tickling to produce
 paralyzing laughter.  Even though these practices may produce some uncomfortable
 results such as dizziness or nausea, the whole experience is so reinforcing that children do
 it again and again, often despite parental objections. Since children all over the world
 engage in these activities, the desire to change consciousness does not seem to be 
a product of a particular culture but rather to arise from something basic.  As children
 grow older they find that certain available substances put them in similar states
. The attractiveness of drugs is that they provide an easy quick route to these experiences.

Many drug users talk about getting high.  Highs are states of consciousness marked by
 feeling of euphoria, lightness, self-transcendence, concentration and energy.  
People who never take drugs also seek out highs.  In fact, having high experiences
 may be necessary to our physical and mental health, just as laughter and dreaming at 
night seem vital to our well being.  Perhaps that is why a desire to alter normal consciousness
 exists in everyone and why people pursue the experiences even though they are sometimes
 uncomfortable side effects.

Most of us do it, but how many of us have asked what I believe is a
fundamental question:  Why do I get high. Certainly many people would be better
 off if they asked this question each time they set about taking a mind-changing compound. 
 Culturally,  and as a species, we must also ask this question in its collective sense, 
Why do we get high? I believe the urge to get high is an essential element of human
 nature and that  it has and in the future will continue to shape the evolution of our species. 
 While I dont propose to have an complete anf final  answer to this enormous question,
 here are some of my thoughts.

Lets begin by looking at some of the most extreme or intense states or goals of a
 number of mind  (and matter) changing technologies including lucid dreaming,
 psychedelic drugs,  virtual reality, sensory  deprivation, near-death experiences 
and nanotechnology.  In each of these experiential phenomena, there is movement
 from the structured experience of the ego as it filters the world of consensual, 
well-boundaried reality into experience which is less structured and with less defined
 or even no boundaries at all.

Stephen LeBerges outstanding bookLucid Dreams, first popularized perhaps the
 most incredible dream experience imaginable: lucid dreaming.  Lucid dreams occur for some
 people rarely, with others more frequently, and others not at all. These are dreams in
 which the dreamer wakes up  while still dreaming and can then begin to change 
the dream as he or she likes.  There isa tremendous sense of freedom that accompanies
 this experience, in that it empowers the dreamer to create any experience he or she desires. 
Certainly this lies at the far edge of the domain of dreaming, which also encompasses
 more mundane activities, such as  dream analysis and dream journals.

In the realm of consciousness change catalyzed by the major psychedelic
 drugs--of which there are many, the most common being LSD. mescaline and psyilocybin
, the active constituent of .the sacred mushroom of Mexico,  users debate which experience is the
 highest...  ranging  from experiences of what Stanislav Grof MD calls the
 metacosmic void and supracosmic
 mind experiences of  transcendent awareness to Terence McKennas  
vision of machine-elves babbling about the end of time in the year 2012
  What  most psychedelic explorers report though as their most profound
 experiences are those in which the tripper can loosen the boundaries to
 the point of creating whatever experience he or she wishes.  They may
 experience this as a fast-moving collection of experiences or realities.
 Tim Leary calls the measuring quotient of this psychedelic stream "R.P.S."
 -- realities per second.  

While recalling Timothy Leary we should remember that it was this venerable
 philosopher of the psychedelic world that introduced many of us to virtual reality
 (VR). Virtual reality is the experience of a simulation of reality induced through 
sensory apparatus driven by a computer.  VR had it's  birth with the military but has
 found its way into commercial applications--including amusement parks in Silicon Valley,
 where youth flock to play computer games that use helmets and gloves instead o
f video screen and joystick.  

The cyberpunk genre of science fiction, iwriteen by such authors as
 William Gibson, Bruce Sterling and Greg Bear have collectively created a future
 in which virtual reality travel into vast computer networks with the Net, becoming a way of life
. Non-fiction 
 books as well, including those by authors Howard Reingold, Myron Kruger
 and Brenda Laurel, all point to a future VR technology in which humans interact in a
 cyberspace environment completely created by computer simulation.  
G. Harry Stein in his non-fiction bookThe Silicon Gods e, ven
 speculate that we will be able to put on non-evasive helmets which
 link the brain and computer  directly , skipping body suits and gloves entirely.
  Brett Leonards film Lawnmower Man tells the story of an evolving VR technology
 that synergizes with biofeedback and nootrophic drugs, permiting its pioneer explorer 
access to the electronic nervous system of earth, freeing him from the constraints of his body --
 and his humanity.

As in lucid dreaming and psychedelic exploration, the goal in VR is the freedom
 to create and to explore realities without bounds. Its goal may be achieved sometime
 in the early decades of the new Millennium. And mystics must note the similarity of the
 Net to ideas of  the nooesphere  (the concept of an emerging "world mind")  of
 Tiliehard De Chardain, and easterner Sri Aurobindo speculations about human
 consciousness evolving in this same direction of global consciousness.  

In the mid-Sixties, scientist John Lilly,  MD,. built the first sensory
 deprivation tank while working on a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
 project in the Virgin Islands.  Sensory deprivation is, as the name implies, a state in
 which all of our normal senses are almost entirely restricted.  Earlier studies had shown
 that experimental subjects would report hallucinations when confined in rooms
 with no stimulus for several days. 

Lilly built a coffin-like tank that circulated salt water at body temperature
 and included a lid to shut out light and sound.  In salt water, humans float and so taking  
a sensory deprivation session is often called floating.  

Lillys excursions into the tank confirmed earlier reports of hallucinatory
 mental journeys while in sensory deprivation.  Perhaps it is no
 coincidence that NIMH had also handed John Lilly some LSD --with instructions
 never to take it alone.  He told me, in an interview in 1971, that the
 reason for this was that another researcher had taken it alone, and had to
 be rescued when he thought that his heart had turned into an cuckoo clock and was
 striking the hour.  This caused a major scandal at NIMH.

Lilly ignored the warnings and his experiences and resultant mapping
 of consciousness as revealed by sensory deprivation and psychedelic compounds
 became the subject of a number of his books, including Programming
 and Metaprogramming the Human Biocomputer, The Deep Self, Center of
 the Cyclone and his recent second autobiography, John Lilly...So Far published
 in 1991 by J.P. Tarcher Books  In each, sensory depr vation experiences, with
 or without powerful augmentation by large does of Ketamine or LSD, became
 a way in Lilly was able to Fix a hole where the rain gets in and stops his mind
 from wandering, as the Beatles once sang.

Another fascinating area in which the consciousness is freed to take new direction
 has been reported by people having Near Death Experiences (NDE).  These are
 people who have had a close brush with death, but survived.  The reports from these
 individuals traverses a wide range of experiences and are reported on in books by
 Raymond Moody and Kenneth Ring. Like the other experiences we have considered,
 these NDE experiences free one up from normal worldly constraints and  provide for a
 much wider range of experience than we enjoy here on Planet Earth. The experiences
 reported seem unusually close to transpersonal experiences catalyzed by psychedelics.

One last consciousness-changing technology that I will mention is purely theoretical --
 nanotechnology.  Nanotechnology as a popular notion was first popularized by Eric Drexler
 in his book, Engines of Creation.  It proposes that as robot machines become smaller and smaller,
 eventually we will get to the point where they can reconstruct the world according to instructions
 given by humans.  By manipulating subatomic particles, these robots can do the work that chemists
 do but without the usual barriers that chemistry presents us with, in which complex routes to
 synthesize chemicals must be invented and through which some transformations are impossible. 

Some nanotechnologists speculate that eventually, we can send tiny robots to the DNA
 of humans themselves, allowing us to reconstruct ourselves through nanotechnology
 aided genetic engineering.  We could also have these machines reconstruct the material
 world itself according to our specifications.  We may learn to shape the world as a sculpture
 shapes a statute.

Why do we do it?  What is the purpose human experience of these human experiences,
 whether intentional or accidental, which thrust us into new and unfamiliar realities? 
 Certainly these other modes of conscious experience are not all pleasant, which is perhaps
 why Huxley named the sequel to Doors of Perception, Heaven and Hell.   Yet, like the
 microscope or telescope, they allow us glimpses into parts of the universe and ourselves
 that we previously may not have known to exist.

As in the senses of hearing or vision, Information coming back from a variety of sources
 gives an added dimension to our experience.  We see or hear in stereo, and this give
s things depth.  Getting high and seeing things from a variety of views gives us an experience
 of relativity.  And it is through this relativistic way of viewing reality that we can get a inkling
 of what ithe fabric of life is really all about. 

 Getting high also challenges the very fabric of mind. Classic psychological theorist Sigmund 
 Freud, called these kinds of experiences "regression" in service of the ego.   According to
 Freud, these mind-adventures are excursions into the realm of the id, or infantile awareness
, for the benefit of the adult personality.   Jung disputed this view, stating that these experiences
 were spiritual in nature and helps us get in touch with our collective unconscious in the same way
 that psychotherapy helped us get in touch with our personal unconscious. 

 It was left for contemporary psychological theorist Ken Wilber to explain the relationship
 and finally reconcile these two polar views in his book Eye to Eye:  the Quest for a
 New Paradigm, Wilber shows that Freud and Jung have staked out territories on both sides
 of what he calls the "pre-trans fallacy." This fallacy, to capsulize Wilber,  is that there is a
 great deal of confusion when looking at altered states of consciousness and individual growth. 
 This confusion is between experiences which transcend the ego and those that are regressions
 from it into more primitive or less evolutionary modes of functioning.  

Transcendental experiences are experiences that go beyond the ego but also continue of
 maintain and  encompass the ego.  Transcendental experiences are based upon solid foundation
 of life in the world, or  "chopping wood and carrying water" as the Zen Buddhists  put it. 
 For those with no strong foundations, altered states might lead downward into more primitive
 and barbaric states of mind -- "the pre" portion of the "pre-trans" split.  Thus the warning should
 be given:  make sure that when you reach for the sky that your feet be planted firmly on
 the ground. 

The key point made and affirmed by both Freud and Jung also, is that the development of
 the ego is an absolutely necessary requirement for healthy human functioning.  In the 
 transcendence of the ego  it is important that the experience be given time and space to be
 reintegrated in to ordinary life, or we become "spaced-out" not capable of functioning in the
 world.  And if we weren't supposed to function in the world, what are we doing here anyway?

If you find all of this hard to understand, then the key to the confusion may lie in the term "ego",
 which has as many meanings as "love" or "God" or any of those other  words people are alway
s trying to define but which they can never quite seem to agree upon.  In the '60s, we talked
 about "ego-death" as the ultimate act of mind.  John Lennon once commented, after reading
 the Psychedelic Experience and taking acid a few hundred times, he didn't even realize
 who he was or that he had written all of those great songs for awhile.  

But "ego-death," no matter how intensively experienced, always leads to "ego rebirth." 
 And why shouldn't it, since the ego is not some undesirable thing that has to be gotten rid of.
  It is the very vehicle which allows us safe passage through life.

 We also link ego with "egotistical," as with the person who is always patting themselves on the
 back verbally in front of others or putting on airs.  But having a strong ego in the psychological
 sense doesn't have anything to do with that either.

The father of self-actualization theory, Carl Jung believed that  as a person becomes self-actualized,
  first there needs to be a healthy ego developed.  But then, after it's proper establishment takes place,
 there is a turning away from "ego-centeredness" toward the development of the self, of which
 the ego is only a part. He called this process "self-actualization."

The question of why  we get high translates into "why do we want to transcend our
 ordinary awareness and what purpose does this transcendence have in our evolutionary
 development."

Ron Siegal never actually tried to account for the reasons for his proposed "fourth drive" 
 But Andrew Weil and Winfried Rosen listed a variety of reasons for searching for a high,  
These included:  to aid religious practices, to explore the self, to alter moods, to treat disease,
 to escape boredom and despair, to promote and enhance social interaction, to enhance sensory
 experience and pleasure, to stimulate artistic creativity and performance, to improve physical
performance, to rebel, to go along with peer pressure, and to establish a unique identity.

In writing my book Ecstasy: The MDMA Story I was forced to face the question of why people
 get high head on, with respect to one drug in particular, MDMA or "Ecstasy" as it is popularly
 refereed to these days.  I came up with four primary reasons people use this enormously pleasant
 (for most) psychoactive compound.  These were:  therapeutic, creativity-enhancement,
 self-actualization and recreation.  Ww might  examine each of these in terms of the more
 general question:  "Why do we get high.

Certainly, psychotherapy as is it currently constituted is an art more than a science. 
  One thing that became clear to me:  psychotherapy seems to change it's language and
 theoretical framework every few years.  New buzzwords and truisms quickly become adopted
 by the members of the psychological profession.   For one cohort of psychologists, early childhood
 development is the "cause" of all their patients' problems,  A few years later, a generation of
 psychologists proclaim that only the present moment should be talked about.  Then later, the
 pendulum swings the other way. Therapy and it's parent psychology are obviously in their early
 infancy  as far understanding and controlling the human mind and nervous system.

Transpersonal experience and other altered states of consciousness  induced by hypnosis, meditation
, guided imagery, psychoactive compounds and a variety of other means of inducing  are certainly
 part of the repertoire of a small minority of current psychotherapists.  These psychotherapists and
 psychiatrists feel more akin to the shaman of tribal cultures or perhaps the gurus or teachers of India
 (although I doubt many psychotherapists would accept this  label willingly) than to their colleagues. 
 They view their role as helping a client to get in tune with their own unconscious by serving as
 guides on their life's journey. 

In tribal cultures, the shaman or medicine man usually takes a plant drug, often a psychedelic
, and goes on a vision quest where they  enter into alternative realities from which they
 can heal members of their tribes or perform other kinds of magic.  

In the modern version of shamanism practiced by transpersonal therapists, the individual
 in search of healing is usually given the psychoactive medicine, whether it is plant derived
 or one of the new and powerful synthetic compounds and is guided on their own vision quest
.  The modern shaman does not usually take the psychoactive medicine with their clients
 (however a small percentage do).  But every one of these new breed of healers has to
 have experience with mind-changing medicines themselves before they can lead others
 on their journeys..

Here, the goal is to have the medicine open up alternative states of consciousness where
 they can gain insights and visions to help them in their ordinary lives.  Certainly there is
 no agreement on the exact mechanism by which they achieve this purpose, but many
 U.S. Government-sanctioned studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of what researchers
 refer to as "psychedelic therapy." Psychedelic therapy which uses one or a few high-dose
 psychedelic sessions, aimed at producing the transpersonal experience, has been demonstrated
 to be useful in the treatment of alcoholism, severe neurosis, heroin addiction and the trauma o
f terminal cancer, in a series of studies conducted mostly in the 'Sixties and Seventies. "

In the mid-'Seventies to mid-'Eighties, therapists took advantage of the lack of illegality of
 a more gentle psychoactive compound known as MDMA. MDMA therapeutic session
s aimed at treating less severe disorders. The experiences produced by MDMA or Ecstasy
 involve much less sensory distortion than those produced by major psychedelics such as LSD.  

MDMA helps individuals  access a state of consciousness in which they  view their existence in
 the world as different.  People report that the external world seems brighter, more perfect and lighter
 than usual.  They also find it easier to open up with other and express their real feelings.  Inwardly
, they feel more relaxed, their self-esteem increases, and they feel a lifting of the pressures of time.

In therapy, MDMA has been used successfully in marriage and couples therapy
, post-traumatic-stress-disorder and in trauma produced by terminal disease to name
 just a small number of uses already found.  Again, the new breed of shamans use
 their clients experiences in an alternative state of consciousness as a means of healing. 

The major psychedelics, MDMA and marijuana--which some consider a
 minor psychedeliic--nd even stimulants and narcotics have been used in the quest
 to enhance creativity both in the arts and in problem-solving.

The Beats, with their excesses and excursions into the realm of drug-induced creativity,
 were not the first but certainly now the most well known and respected of those who
 experimented with the written word while "high."  In fact, it was the Beats who invented
 the word.  Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Jack Kerouc, now three of the most
 respected literary figures of the 20th Century smoked marijuana almost as a religion as well,
 as dabbling in writing while on peyote, LSD, the opiates and amphetamine.

Peter Stafford, in his first book, LSD--The Problem Solving Psychedelic  documents  the last
 LSD study conducted in 1966,  shortly before the compound was made illegal.  Performed by 
Willis Harman, current head of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, then at the Stanford Research
 Institute, In the experiment , small doses of mescaline were given to engineers.  The engineesr
 were given assignments to develop an alternative to the record player for reproducing sound.
  The CD wasn't born that day but certainly the unique solutions proposed by this group of
 engineers illustrate the way that mind-changers shift your view, allowing for the emergence
 of natural creativity.

Earlier, Oscar Janiger, founder of the Albert Hofmann Foundation, had his LSD subjects
 paint an Indian Kachina doll before and while under influence of the compound. The 
experiments yielded fascinating paintings, some of which are now worth many thousands
 of dollars because the subjects have since become famous artists. 

Ecstasy too has had its artistic adherents.  A study of creative writing was done during MDMA'
 grace period--before criminalization--with at least promising anecdotal evidence of success
 in increasing creative output.  

In creativity, as in the previously-discussed use in therapy, the chief mechanism is entrance
 of the individual into another state of consciousness where they might have an  insight, have a
 feeling, see a vision, hear a voice or get a unique perspective which they then bring back to
 the world by way of pictures, words or music.

Psychologist Abraham Maslow, introduced earlier, coined the word "self-actualization" to
 describe the next important use of intoxication.  Maslow gave birth to new schools of
 psychology, which he called "humanistic" and  "transpersonal."  A major theme in humanisti
c psychology is that psychologists should study healthy and exceptional people rather than
 only those with mental problems.  Up until then, abnormal psychology was THE psychology

 Instead, he saw a continuum starting with those who were mentally ill through the range
 of more normal individuals and ending with the "self-actualized" individual at the other end.  

These self-actualized individuals were those exceptional people in our society who came
 up with the great theories. produced exceptional novels or art works, were the leaders and 
successful business-men and so forth.  These were the people whose lives Maslow thought we 
should examine.  Along with Jung's notion of self-realization, this idea of self-actualization marked
 a new direction in the study of human consciousness, one that had roots in the myths and religions o
f cultures around the world but which until then had been mostly ignored by western science.

During the past half century, there has been a surge of interest in this "spiritual search." Ram Dass,
 whose life's work and teaching on the spiritual journey has made him one of the most popular
 lecturers in America, notest on his trips though the U.S.. that when he talks about spiritual experience
, he finds that the crowds have changed.  In the 'Sixties and though much of the 'Seventies
, it was the young Baby Boomers, the Children of the 'Sixties who came to see him.  

But more recently, the audience has become more diverse. Not only do the Boomers come
, but people from many generations and all walks of life. In one of his Mid-Western lecture
s when talking about a very profound experience he had in India, Ram Dass noticed a old woman
 nodding knowingly as he described his mind-adventure.  Later, the woman came up to the stage 
to greet him Ram Das took her aside and asked her how she knew about experiences such a
s he was describing.  She smiled back at Ram Dass after the question, and said, "I crochet."

Experiences called "spiritual"  did not start, of course, with Ram Dass or Maslow or LSD. 
 They go back to the earliest of recorded history, where  certain individuals  have reported
 mystical experiences including saints, artists and many other happy people.  
 These have been documented in works like Huxley's Perennial Philosophy and Bucke's
 Cosmic Consciousness..  What is remarkable is that what was once referred to  by Western
 mystics as the "beatific vision" has been translated by moderns into "getting high."  But the
 experience remains largely the same.

The vision quest, like excursions from the mundane for therapy or creativity, is a process.
  The individual seeks to experience states of consciousness beyond the ordinary, and t
 bring back that vision to help guide their own life and inspire the lives of others.

The last category of uses which I discussed in my book is currently the least socially-sanctioned..
.but perhaps the most important.  That is the "recreational" uses of getting high.
  Again, one can go in two directions, and certainly it must be acknowledged that there
 are those who should never try a mind-altering substances and many who abuse them 
with destructive consequences.  

Peter Stafford, in an article in the  Journal of Psychoactive Drugss' 
 special issue, "LSD in Retrospect," notes, "Adaptation of the term "recreational"
 by the government has about it a connotation that such experiences are rather trivial
, frivolous and/or of  a rather vulgar and lower order nature.  In fact however, the
 impressions conveyed by most individuals engaged in such activities with LSD seem
 to have been to the effect that the consequences have been of a higher order. 
 The bulk of those responding have repeatedly indicated that they thought that
 their use of LSD has been among the most important experience of their lives
 and that the drug's effects have been re-creational {author's italics].

Stafford's transformation of "recreation" to "re-creation" is not elaborated on
, but I believe that it is essential to the understanding of what I consider the
 primary significance of the drive to get high.  This basic urge has as its underpinnings
 the desire to recreate ourselves as we wish to be rather than how the seemingly random events 
of life mold us.  Certainly many developmental theories recognize that although endowed at  birth with
 certain potentials, we are, in a way, "programmed" by our experiences.  Whether you follow the
 eastern schools and call it "liberation" or the western and call it personal growth, psychoactive drugs,
 most specifically those considered mind-expanding, have been part of the repertoire developed.

Biologist Ralph Berger once commented that humans might better be called Homo Ludens 
 than Homo Sapian.  Homo Sapian means "thinking man". while Homo Lundens  names
 our species "playful man."  He argued for the later term because while every one of the
 more-developed animal species plays, humans play for a much longer proportion of their life
 span than any other creature with the exception perhaps of the whales and dolphins, 
which some argue play their entire life.  

Most of us don't realize it,  but play is essential for learning and growth.
 Play is a highly creative behavior in which we act out our fantasies.  
By doing so, we learn many of the behaviors which grow more complex and evolve into our
 "grown up" culture and civilization.

In fact, the philosopher Alan Watts when discussing the heights of
 Vaspasana Hindu insight that he has experienced through psychedelics and  meditation in his work, 
The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are ,described the entire evolution of the
 universe by the Hindu term Maya , or "play."  What is all of this play for, what is it good for.
  The answer that he gave was that it is all art, like a good piece of music or an admired painting.  
 It is to be enjoyed, and that is why the universe evolved consciousness.  Consciousness is simply the  universe 
appreciating its uniqueness and the wonder of its unfolding playful creation.  

We can get high for therapy, spiritual growth, pleasure,  or creativity
 but the key element that makes getting high so useful is that it allows us, as adults, to play.
  Externally, our relationship with others and the environment changes and becomes more novel
 and experimental. Internally we consider our thoughts and emotions in a new light,
 or from a new and "higher" level.  

By opening this doorway into a way of being which is essentially more playful, it enables
 us to "deprogram" ourselves, to rid ourselves of habitual acts and stultified ways of seeing things.
 We try on new behaviors and modes  of thought the same way an actor dons a costume and mask. 
  This breaks us free of our earlier programming, and allows us to consciously choose
 to become who we want to be and to think what we will.  

Often , the mystical or spiritual experience is talked about in terms of th
e individual experiencing themselves as "god."  Instead of god out there, god
 become located in ourselves as well as in everything else.  And, as we become god,
we can "recreate" ourselves in our own image.

Those who write about mind-changing compounds have always recognized this
 core purpose of drug-taking.  Bouldiare called it entering an "artificial paradise."
  Peter Stafford refers MDMA sessions as an occation for "mini-vacations." 
 The youth these days ccall it "raving." And of course the hippies in the 'Sixties when
 on LSD, "took a trip." Their destination, a place of magic and mystery,
 where they could  imagine
 a better, more peaceful world. A place where we can play peacefully.

	I would think it goes along with a phrase I personally do not

promoters being on the net, more of a lack of people who have an ok or a 
shite time just not wanting to deal with people getting angry (and

	When Tristan first posted stuff about the F&F in March, I saw a
lot of this. There have been/are still a lot of times when I am out, that
the vibe holds a if-you-don't-have-a-big-grin-on-your-face-you-are-
being-negative quality to it. I don't attribute it the "scene" losing 
energy; if you find the right people and the music to suit them, things 
happen. Well, maybe the scene as a whole is losing energy, or maybe the 
memories are being romanticized as the novelity wears off so some. I 
would agree there are more "rules" now and things are not so dark with 
the spine of power which every human neuron once connected into as the 
music washed over them (damn it). This is what I had thought of sunset 
last year (here come the flames) because by the time I was getting my ass 
down to the marina, all the image had invaded the place (it seemed I was 
always walking in behind a group of people talking about how dope they 
had while hiding their bottle of Mickey's or St. Ides in their coats... 
makes a wonderful first introduction to something people are saying is 
the best thing to hit this area in a long time).
	Someone had said something a little while back about enforced 
PLUR, but it had just been laughed off because how could anyone have too 
many hugs or whatever. Yeah, and how could anyone have too many good nazi 
ideals? I mean really, make yourself and everyone like you feel really 
great and all... Because nazi ideals are horrible... Not when they are 
favoring you. Because people don't think about what is they are doing and 
why they are doing it and how it might affect others. Ok, so enforced 
PLUR does hurt anyone (so we like to believe) if my last comment there is 
ignored, but PLUR is empty if people don't think about what they are 
doing and why they are doing it. Like the thread about e changing people 
so that they are acting in ways they would not act sober. All of that I 
think is happening more and more. And I think it really does degrade the 
"rave scene". I seem to fuming my pent up angers with what I have been 
seeing for the last 4 months.

	Do you consider gabber techno? If so, you just have to find the 
right places... Though I cannot say everyone was going off the last time 
I saw people dancing to good ol' 190 bpm music...

	This I can see in one sense, but no matter how one tries, there 
is going to be some statement other people can infer from what that one 
was/is doing. So were they ever free of political nonsense or were they 
just immune to it internally?

	Hopefully there are a few thoughts worthy of ponderment within my 
typical load of dribble...

Well to end this long and tired thread, I would like to say that I didn't
mean to drag this subject so far thru the mud.  I just had to defend my
thoughts and feelings after I got all of those flames. I just wish someone
from the DUST crew would of replied (or did they?).

Bottom line:  Those people are actively involved with the scene, and they
are working hard at it.  I give 'em full props for doin' a weekly (that's
alot of time n energy).  shouts out to the DUST crew (but i never did like
the bartender and security guy).

Well back to work.  Unfortunately, I have to work all weekend long.  That
means I can't attend *any* parties this weekend.  urghh.  And to tell you
the truth, I would like to hear John Williams tonight (at DUST).. BUt I
can't..

anyway < hope you all have a great weekend!!

Hi All,

Can someone please forward me a copy of this week's calender? I'm not sure
what happened to mine (or is is just delayed this week?) 
Thanks a bunch!

Love Lydia 

P.S. It's really too bad Jon had such a bad experience, but for what it's
worth I love Dust (thanks for the free water guys!) . At least one place
brave enough to play something different than the regular SF sounds on a

	There is a community. It currently seems to want to look at only
the good things. 
	How can it be based on acceptance, love and understanding if it
does not acknowlegde that not all things are good?  Granted, one can get
carried away, but when oter people turn around and flame someone for
getting carried away, are they not getting carried away themselves? 
(I think someone pointed that out already though). Shall it become a 
community based on ideals of acceptance, love, and understanding or just 
be an accepting, loving, understanding community?

Gabber isn't the only kind of techno.  there is a alot of good techno that
doesn't get any play in SF simply because it is techno.  What about
Underground Resistance, Richie Hawtin, Dave Clark, Carl Craig, Rob Hood,
Dan Bell (DBX), Kenny Larkin, Juan Atkins, Paul Johnson and the entire
Chicago underground, the list goes on.... It seems like if you mention
techno in SF, people look at you funny.. They think you bang your head to
the sound of 190 bpm chainsaws with overdriven 909 bass ontop; or they
think Moby is techno.  I remember sitting in a restaurant talking about
this exact topic and the waitress butted in (without knowing what we were
talking about) and said 'yeah I know.. you cannot tell people that theyr'e
playing techno, you gotta call it tribal or something.. People in SF *hate*
techno'.  It was kinda humorous

Dave,

I appologize if it appeared that I was trying to present an idealized view of 
our community.  I would like everyone to consider the fact that what we are 
doing, and continually working at doing, takes some effort on an everyday 
basis.  No, its not hard to be nice to people, and smile.  But, sometimes it 
is hard to recognize that you may be in a situation that is not what you 
expected or wanted and make it the best.

I am not trying to minimalize the feelings that Jon had.  I think that it's 
really a shame that he did not enjoy himself.  I also think that its great 
that each person who has the courage, resources (personal, financial, etc) and 
energy goes out there and trys to provide an arena for those of us to come 
together and groove.

>(I think someone pointed that out already though). Shall it become a 
>community based on ideals of acceptance, love, and understanding or just 
>be an accepting, loving, understanding community? 

First off our community needs these ideals to make realities.  I was in no way 
trying to flame or slight Jon's experience.  I must say though that it makes 
me sad when I see people on the defensive on subjects and a series of 
arguments (more the negative type than logical) ensue.  This is not the way to 
come together.  We can freely share are dissapointments, anger and love.  All 
of this requires acceptance.  We need to hear what the other person is saying. 
 This is often hard via email and requires added reading.  What I felt reading 
Jon's posts was that he was upset because he felt that he had a bad time and 
then this was only accelerated by a method of cross talk which put him on the 
defensive.  I am not claiming that anything anyone said was right or wrong.  I 
only hoped that acknowledging, honestly, that I understood and could relate to 
what he was saying and trying to help turn the situation around could help 
bring back that good feeling vibe.  There is nothing in the world like 
groovin' on the inside...with people you love and that sweet bass!

If for any reason I failed either to enact the principles I believe so deeply 
in or live them, I appologize, or if I merely misconstrued them.

To all:  Have a fukengruven weekend!  Let the vibe move you through each 
moment and seize life by the reigns.  It's all what we make of it and I plan 
on making it better than I ever dreamed.

I am so glad that we are us and you are you! :)

just to go on a bandwith binge

Love Anais

i have to agree... i'm especially glad that jon posted that info. about

i don't really think the emphasis on spirituality at many parties has 
much to do with the scene losing energy... for example, friends and 
family has its "spiritual" side with altars, etc. and there is certainly 
A LOT of energy there...also YSH was a pumping party and it had its 
altars, etc.  

and i seem to find A LOT of techno  and harder trance in sf, but maybe i 
 just know where to look...(in fact, i don't think i get ENOUGH tribal and 
house in my life - got to get out to deco on weds more, at least for the
house ...)  i think one segmentof promoters in sf focuses on "DEEP super 
spiritual tribal trance" but there's a lot more than that...

I think a lot of people droped out of the scene because too many new age or

again, i think there are A LOT of parties in sf, and not all of them have 
a  "spiritual" side...

i happen to like making altars and throwing parties with a pagan 
(not "new age") emphasis 
(celebrating the season, pagan holidays, etc.) myself, but i'm not trying 
to bring back an "ole time rave feeling" or anything... i'm trying to do 
w something new and integrate the rave trance experience with my 
spiritual practice...however, i don't want to "force" this on anyone...i 
prefer to make it clear when i throw a party what it is celebrating, and 
i expect anyone who is not interested or who would not be open and 
respectful to stay home or go elsewhere...

however, i have noticed, at least on sfraves, a kind of, oh, how shall i 
put it? "happiness fascism?"  "happy correctness?"  like if you go to a 
party you're supposed to be spreading positive  energy ALL the time... i 
like sharing positive energy, but i don't always feel very happy when i'm 
out at a party... sometimes i'm tired...sometimes i'm in pain ...sometimes i don't 
i don't deal with large crowds and become anti-social... but gaia-forbid i 
i spread 
"negative energy" by not forcing a smile or jumping up and down gleefully 
 sometimes i just go out to hear good musick and if i'm lucky i 
start feeling better (ecstatic even!) as the evening wears on... because 
, and i'm going to sound therapeutic here but what the fuck, as people 
we need 
to feel and acknowledge our feelings and not force ourselves to 
pretend everything's hunky-dorey (sp?) andd rave-y and happy and all 
that when we just don't feel it...

take care,
monicat

...so feel free to say hi if you're at Ethan's shindig.  I'll be the really
tall thin guy with the Van Dyke and the long hair pulled back samurai-style.
(Milton has the bubble kazoo; anyone know where he went?  At least it's in
good hands...)

If anyone can put me up for the night (morning) after, please catch me @ the
party -- my car's in the shop, and I may have to ride my motorcycle, and
I'm not sure I trust myself to ride back on no sleep.  I might find a ride
out with someone else, but I might not...

In an unrelated announcement, anyone who considers themselves a computer
programmer or 3D artist and wants to work on arcade games (or knows someone
who does) should email me.  We have job openings now, in a nice building with
actual natural light in Mountain View near Palo Alto.

And lastly, anyone have a good suggestion for an Internet access provider in
415 that doesn't charge by the hour?  Portal works OK but the machine gets 
really bogged down and I can't run gnus on it.

other way round, niels!  according to terence (and it's certainly the most
believable version of early history I've ever heard) the first species of
psychedelicise3d monkeys spread a civilisaztion acrosss algeria and east
to the middle east and north as far, I think, as the west coast of ireland
but then ran out of regular mushroom contact. 

this early species was tribal groupmind-oriented, monthly full moon orgy
celebrations where "everyone humped in a heap".  communal in that nobody
knew their father etc. also (and here I may be going somewhat into my own
vision of it) all decisions were made unanimously by the whole tribe. 

so imagine the disaster when full moon comesand the shaman (who has
emerged as the keeper of the mushrooms around which the entire culture
revolves) has to annouce "we have no mushrooms".  so they drink the beer
which was actually from the honey they used to preserve the mushrooms,
fermented mead really.  but how much good would that actually have done? 

anyway by the time the third full moon comes around (and still no
mushrooms) group decisions are being held up by lack of general sense of
agreement.  (oh yes, terence claims that the mushroom prevents the growth
of the ego which he sees as a cancerous tumor on the human p0syche) so all
these egos are starting up. 

finally, I reckon, some teenage male leaps up in frsutration at all the
different opinions and announces that he for one is going off to do
whatever and he doesn't care who comes with him.  as he pounds off I see
an ancient crone of a female psychedelicised monkey screeching: 

"DON'T GO!  DON'T BREAK THE CIRCLE!" 

the young male turns: "why not? what's so fuckin' sacred about the
circel?" 

"war, suffering and strife, you'll see, you'll see!"  she croaks, 
unable to express her natural psychedelic knowledge in words.

and so what we call "History"  began, a new species evolved and set forth
on a career of invasions, looting, dominance, subjugation of woman and the
psychedelic side, agriculture and cities and competition and ... the
history of EGO.  right up to the present day.  now the species must remake
the Sacred Circle (Cooperation). and that, for those fretting that this is
off-subject, is exactly where Rave Culture comes in.

you probably mean The Hundredth Monkey which has nothing to do with any 
movie called 12 Monkeys.
Very very very briefly scientists on an island studying a colony of 
monkeys found that a new eating parttern spread one by one until a 
certain critical mass was reached at which point ALL the monkeys changed 
their behaviour overnight.  They called the principle The HUndredth 
Monkey Principle.  these scientists also reproted that all the monkey 
colonies on other nearby islands also changed on the same day but some 
doubts have been raised about this.

the RC connection is that, as a new cooperative culture achieves critical 
mass, YOU could be the Hundredth Monkey that kicks it all loose.  :-)

I too, will be going to this coming basics.

I expect martin to be holding it either at richmond or the skating rink
out in pittsburg. Either way it should be great.

I will have two friends of mine from oregon going to their first SF rave
so lets show them what it's all about.

I too will be wearing clothes at basics but more or less you will be
able to spot me by my big brown,very fuzy ted-E bear.

Don't forget to wear your dentures, people, I want to see nice and shiny
teeth when you say HI!

I recomend that we all meet at 2AM sharp ion front of the DJ booth.
That's when I'm going to chew my EXtra gum.

Look for the dancing bear!!!!!!!!!!

Dear All;

	Friday the 19th of May, 1995 had to be the most boring day in SF 
rave history. Even at 1015 Folsum I didn't regonize a sole, let a lone 
the vibe. I kept asking myself if I was in the wrong place or not, it 
looked like the Sound Factory, and no I was doin acid, I wish, oh maybe 
not. Lots o suits, old, old people and button down shirts, with straight 
legs, it was fuckin werid. Maybe I was in the wrong place or just 
illinformed, I think I was in hell, the music was bad to, no offense, but 
it just wasn't there ***for me**** lastnight. I left at 3am, dats earlly 
early for me. Well, I guess ya gotta have the SUCK nights along with the 
good ones, god, how bad can it get though. If anyone else had similar 
experiences please do let me know. I'm really confused, considering I 
knew about 30 people there last Friday, and the fRiday before last ...etc 
and had a great time, go figure.

As anyone who was going out 2 or more years ago can tell you there was
even _more_ emphasis on the spiritual side of raving then, then there
is now, many of them will tell you that it has gone down hill because this
is not the focus today, if you don't believe me just read the SFR archives 
from that period.  Also don't confuse spirit with religion.

Well some parties had crystals and alters 3 years ago and some didn't.
I distinctly remember seeing god with my head in a bass bin 3 1/2 years
ago listing to the hardest techno :) so it doesn't have to be deep or
tribal to be spiritually moving.  I must admit that it is easier to go
into trance with deep or tribal stuff and for me as well as many others
IT'S ALL ABOUT TRANCE.  New raves like the old ones still have an anything
goes attitude as long as you respect the other party goers.  I think if new age
is not your thing then fine, I don't recall anyone requiring anybody
to be into _any_ thing spiritual at any party.  If you just want good music
without the overtones there are plenty of good parties that don't take
that bent.  Try Funky Techno Tribe or Spundaes, the music at these parties
are generally good and they aren't into all the crystal stuff.

Well since were on the subject, no I don't think it's bad for Jon
to post his feelings but I have also been doing a lot of soul searching
about this subject and I have come up with the following questions for
myself and others.

	"In the old days" folks were more open to going to something
	that they didn't already know about, why isn't that the norm
	today?

	What would it be like if every person that came to a "bad party"
	felt that it was their personal duty to generate enough vibe to
	turn the party around?

The more efficient thing to do is to put it on hyperreal.com
then not just sfravers could access it and it would persists long
after the posting has been read. Try sending mail to brian@hyperreal.com

Sunset is a renegade party, that means that it is essentially 
illegal so if the location were posted long before it happens
it runs a good chance of getting busted.  The best thing to do
is call the Pacific Sound number (415)985-5264 on Sunday morning

        I have a short article written by Colin Wilson dealing with two
different theories, one of which being that of 'morphic resonance' which is
the 'hundredth monkey' thing.  It's quite interesting and pretty short so
if there are no problems with me posting it, it'll be in yer mailbox later
today.
        I've heard that that the monkey island thing has been explained by
'real' theory..it's highly disputed but i've had difficulty trying to find
more info on it.
        Morphic resonance and the 'critical mass' theory is also mentioned
in mc kenna's "archaic revival" p. 212, as well as being one of the
insights in James Redfield's 'The celestine prophecy'
        I think it's neat :)

Every moment only happens once in a lifetime... Wow!  I have never heard
that one.  A very cool little thought and true to life.  But in reading into
it a bit I'd say that the physical moment will pass depending on the time
frame of a moment but the context of that moment can be felt and enjoyed
throughout ones life.  It's not the actual moment but rather what is gained
from the time in that moment that counts.  You see, everything is a memory
and therefore each moment constitutes a memory.  Each of these memories can
be compiled into an experience.  I'd say that an experience can happen over
and over again and enjoyed over and over again.  Humm.  This experience may
not be the same but the compiled moments may.  And therefore these various
moments can be enjoyed continiously throught compiled experiences.  A
lifetime full of compiled moments and experiences.

With all that said it sounds very much like one must live in the past
(mind).  Well, not exactly.  You see, it's what's gained that sticks, not
the time in which it happened.  

Neat.  I like the way that sounds.  I think that I'll make a note of that
somewhere in my steel memory >Right :)<

IMO deep does not have to be wailing diva's there are a lot of deep 
instramentals that are great for trancing, there is a different kinda
heart centered trance that is reserved for the diva stuff :)

       ,
(wow. dana has free time to post to sfraves. my shock. not yours.)

I've been thinking about this quite a bit recently,
because on the Socal list, more and more promoters and what
not are happening on to the list and i wonder how that is
changing the dynamics of it all.

I think there is a difference between saying 
"Don't post bad things about my friend's club"
and saying 
"Hey, i know the person who does that club, and..."

A lot of people on this list are heavily involved in SF
and know a lot of the people who throw clubs,
therefore they know a lot of the background info that 
is behind some of the clubs.  

When i first got into going to clubs or raves or whatever,
there was this mythical treatment by me and my friends 
of some of the Promoters and DJs.

This brought silly respect for them, but also silly critiques of them.
Saying "Well.. they should have thought about (such and such)
because that is obviously a problem."

For some reason we assumed that the experience they were having
was identical to the one that we were.  Or that SOMEONE
would have told them by now about the problem.

Hell, a friend of mine owns a club space and he is often there when i am,
yet has no idea what type of attitude the door people have
and when i tell him he gets upset.  But few people bother telling him
because they assume thats just how he or whoever wants them to act.

So, while criticism to the list is a good thing, criticism to the promoter
is a much better idea, because i know lots of promoters
who want to not have the problems or who have explanations
that may or may not be acceptable.

Some people are out there just to scam us out of our money
giving us the minimal amount that they can, but a lot of people
want to have good parties where people have a good time.
So people who know those people tend to defend them 
because they know their heart is in the right place.
(Not that having a heart in the right place is
a good replacement for people having a bad time)

dana

Since it was really hard to read, I processed this through emacs and 
cleaned up some formatting, and it's now available at the URL

http://www.hyperreal.com/~brian/whywegethigh.html

Chris, Lamont, feel free to move it into a place more appropriate if 
you're interested.  Bruce, make sure the formatting didn't change any 
meaning anywhere.

My review: pretty good, I'd cut down on the length by removing 
references to nanotech and maybe even VR, they just distract from the 
point.  I might even consider breaking it down into a couple distinct 
HTML documents instead of one long one, since that's easy to do in 
this medium :)

REVIEW/RAVE CULTURE/STANFORD 

(The following aarticle is from the Stanford Campus Report.  There are at
least 6 factual mistakes in this article, to say nothing of slight
unintentional distortions, but we decided to leave everything in because
one of the main reasons we publish such articles is to show that the media
are not necessarily our enemies.  Though they may often misunderstand what
is after all a very rich and diverse culture, the thinking Zippy type
understands the crucial importance of media in getting the best aspects of
our culture OUT.)


HEAD            'Ravers dance the sun up and celebrate global cooperation"
by Diane Manuel

The dark blond ponytail was the first clue, but, when he launched into an 
earnest dissertation on social change, cooperation, 'green' issues and 
the doomed planet, there was no doubt.  Fraser Clark is a tie-died-in- 
the-wool '60s hippy.
But Clark hadn't come to campus to talk about the good old Haight and 
harmony of yesterday.  As he leaned towards the microphone and spoke in a 
deep Scottish brogue, he was looking toward the tomorrow that he thinks 
could spring from one of today's fastest growing sub-cultures - the 
all-night dance and music phenomenon known as the rave.
"Ravers are not inventions of old hippie conspirators like me" he told 
300 atttentive students sitting cross-legged on the parquet floor of 
Roble Dance Studio on May 3.  "This is a culture that is exploding all 
through the Western democracies, and we are in for a period of massive 
social change."
Clark told his listeners that he attended his first rave in 1987.  More 
than 20000 people had paid more than $40 each to gather in an open field 
near Manchester, England, with the Big Dipper overhead and a wall of 
sound reverberating for miles around.  "I was probably the only person 
there over 30 and it was very, very exciting."
A guru of underground British culture, Clark is an editor and social 
activist from Glasgow who moved to San Francisco nine months ago to be 
closer to what is fast becoming the new mecca of the international rave 
scene.  He still publishes three magazines on alternative lifestyles and 
is the owner of London's trendy Megatripolis Club and a record company 
that produces music by what he calls "technoshamanic bands".
But Clark is perhaps best known as the founder of the Zippy movement - 
Zen Inspired Pronoia Professionals - an international community whose 
members claim the internet as their country of origin.  Pronoia is the 
lurking suspicion that others are conspiring to help you, and Zippies, 
many of them old hippies, are a gyrating promotional force for raves.
"Is a rave just a party?" Clark asks rhetorically.  "No.  And it's not a 
new dance step either.  It's a new cooperative attitude and culture which 
is spreading very rapidly across the planet."
"There are many people doing good, self-less work today" he continued.  
"This one's saving the robins, this one the whales.  But these are all 
separate causes and we have to find a way to bring everyone into an 
overall paradigm shift.  Rave Culture ofers a way to do that."
As an example Clark pointed to the artistic revival that he sees in 
England today, at a time when Europe is in the grip of an unprecedented 
economic depression.
"Thousands of young people in England today accept that they're never 
going to have a proper job" he said. "And yet I've never seen such 
creativity and imagination.  They're producing magazines, organising 
social protests, painting and putting on exhibitions.
"People in the rave scene are being forced to cooperate out of economic 
necessity" he added.  "This one contributes the music, that one the 
venue, and that one the sound system.  They're realy getting things back 
to a proper balance."
After receiving a degree in psychology in 1965 and learning "more about 
white rats" than he learned about himself, Clark struck off on a 20 year 
trek around the world in search of a hospitable culture.  He ended up 
back in England in the mid '80s where he sat down with a group of 
similarly dissatisfied friends and tried to sketch out what some of the 
"signs" of a coming new order might be.
The hoped-for culture, as Clark conceived it, would be a youth 
phenomenon, feature a new style of music, be linked with nature and a 
return to the countryside, and ultimately would be capable of spreading 
widely and rapidly.  The first rave he attended convinced Clark he had 
found his long lost grail.
"Anyone who's young and intelligent in today's world has to be interested 
in the rave scene, he advised his listeneers, 30 of whom indicated by a 
show of hands that they had attended a rave.  "It shows every sign of 
capturing America over the next year or so, and will soon replace the 
current grunge culture."
Among the many pluses, Clark noted that alcohol is "not the main 
lubricant for ravers".  "Raves are producing a whole generation which is 
simply against alcohol" he argued.  "They just don't drink.  Alcohol and 
the life-attitude that goes with it, are gone."
But what about the new, so-called designer drugs he was asked.
"Any drug taken in the wrong context is bad" Clark said.  "I haven't taken 
Ecstasy myself for about two years. I found it too toxic, and I prefer 
'smart drinks'.  But basically now I don't take anything."  
The fact that Clark and several of Britain's most popular disc jockeys 
recently have moved to the Bay Area prompted questions about the 
commercialism of rave culture.  But Clark contended that there are no 
'stars' on the rave scene, unlike rock'n roll or heavy metal.  DJs, he 
said, are simply the "technoshamans" who follow the moods at a rave.
"They know when to take the music higher or faster, and when to let it 
down.  This is shamanic, tribal, African-style dancing, with people 
waving in the wind like trees, and dancing till their minds are stilled.
"Then, finally, the group mind becomes dominant, and the question becomes 
not 'Who am I?' but 'Who are we?'"  [end]

gosh... I to a break from working and checked out alt.rave and rec.music.techno.
I can't believe how shitty those newsgroups are these days.  A post every 5
messages from someone saying 'you ravers suck'.  How cool...

SF is the place to be!!!!!  (even in cyberspace)

Good Morning!

>rather than relying thon moments passed.

I'd say that moments happen whether or not one plans for them.  To put a
strain upon the enjoying and learning of any given moment is, but, only
setting expectations for future experiences based on learned pasts.  You
see, it's those unexpected times and passing moments that just suprises one
and makes one take a step back.  But if you're attempting to create a "fully
lived" moment then, in effect, you are creating an experience.  These fully
lived experiences are actions and compilations of remembered past moments.
It's hard to say what fully living is unless past moments, in which one has
gained, define what this experience shall entail.  I should think that you
are trying to create an ever expanding/existing experience without letting
random moments to be learned from.  But, in effect, in thinking randomly
about not fully living you are creating a random moment of thought that
expands and creates avenues for thoughts you'll have tomorrow and therefore
allowing for a compiled history of thinking which will, in effect, create an
experience to be treasured (as they all should).

> why is school work so hard to get oneself to do?

Well.  It's not very hard actually.  It seems that perceptions about "school
work" has taken effect in almost all students that ential unhappiness.  All
it takes is taking a step back and looking to past experiences and moments
of learning.  I know that you may not be in "the mood" but look at it this
way.  Inside those books hold a treasure of knowledge.  This treasure
anables one to draw parallels to current thoughts and experiences.  These
parallels help us all get along and understand each other... Even the most
remote mathmatics asks for the mind to open up and accept new concepts.  So
in taking the time to learn such remote knowledge you are, in effect, saying
that I shall accept what this book has to offer and therefore can be
paralleled to current happenings (opening the mind to other concepts).

>--------------------------------

> all the things which imply

Good.  All the things that imply peace allow for each of us to be at peace
with one another as well as the self.  One must love yourself for others to
love you.  You must respect others for others to respect you.  Accepting
others freedom alows you to be free.  With all this in effect, you can Unify
and be at peace...  Something to ponder.

Bye-Bye

Hello everyone,
	I went to Basics last night and I loved every minute of it!! The 
night kinda didn't start out too well for me. I drove out there and 
finally got to the party. I was sooooo excited I kinda rushed getting 
out of my car and locked the keys in the car, with the lights on! 
(Stupid) But thank god for the handy security guard who knew how to 
brake into my car. Adn I guess my friend Joe had fun directing traffic 
while the guard did that!! 
	Anyways we got inside to be completely amazed by the location. 
Tony was spinning!!!! AAAWWWEEE!!!! (Good) That started the night of 
just amazing music, that just took the crowd for the ride of a lifetime, 
(or at least me and everyone that I talked to!) Rob Vaughn from Dallas 
was completely amazing!!! I have never ever danced that hard in my life! 
Or at least my sober life! :) 
	In all Basics was really, really good! The crowd was so into it 
(great energy!,) the music was excellent (not one bad song in my 
opinion!,) and the location was great! To me, it felt like all the 
energy from all the Basics parties in the past three years combined, 
came back out!!! People that I haven't seen came out, and just made it 
extra special!!!! Thanx to the Basics crew, and to all the people how 
made it so special!

Peace, love and harmony to all beautiful people!

Greg

Maaaaaan... the party put on by the folks from Komotion last night (Friends and
Family crew I'm assuming) for Ethan's birthday was phenomenal. Almost indescrib-
ably excellent, but I'll try anyways :)
The space was reaally homey and intimate, and there was none of that corporate
sort of mentality that sometimes comes with bigger gatherings.  The crowd knew
exactly what it takes to make a great rave, and everyone was smiling and talking
about anything they felt like to each other.  There was such an intense feeling
of *universal* love there, and it was unconditional.  Everyone helped each other
whenever they could: Jesse talking with the young woman from Concord, Tracy
spinning an ear-dazzling closing set, Reza jumping in to refill pitchers of 
water when the vibE was hitting hardest and the kitchen was empty, Black Adder
introducing me to Brian Darkness, Regan (sp?) with her buzzball toy, the way the
organizers had blowpops and apricots for all of us (YES!)--I could ramble away
for pages with stories about everyone I met!
And of course HAPPY BIRTHDAY ETHAN!  Hope you didn't mind the squawkiness of
our 'happy birthday to you' rendition :)  Thanks for letting all of us celebrate
with you.
Love to you all
*twirl*
Timothy

            hey allen---a freind of mine tells me about a group of people 
who have regular meetings up in marin where they discuss the Mayan Oracle 
and apparently they've been working on a 13 moon calendar as well. the 
official date that the new calendar goes into effect will be july 
26--------july 25 has been designated as the "day out of time" so perhaps 
someone should organize a party on that day....
                    of course the new calendar has the full support of 
the S.P.A.Z. mobile audio assault unit , and we shall be distributing 
copies as soon as one becomes available........aaron> >

talk about cool

We got there around 11 or so and walked in to TONY spinning. The vibe at
first didn't seem bad but awkward because everyone was talking at the
back of the space.
BUT- at around 1:15 when I beleive it was harry who he spun the best
fast tracks and drum tracks. Everyone ran to the dance floor and started
cheering.

The best part IMO was the peak of Duran. He went so high I felt like I
was flying(in some ways I was). I talked to him afterwards and he said
that he was glad to spin in SF again. I caught TONY dancing later in the
night with a big smile. That guy from texas was good. Good music with a
good feel of a set that built up gradualy with a good sense of beat and
tribal kinda set in the background.
PROPS to all of the DJ's.

Thank you again Martin for a good party and a Comp.

We left at 7 or so and drove to miltons house and crashed there.
Thanx Milton!
Thank you to everyone else!

Hi all!  I haven't organized my England trip photo very well yet, but you
can take a peek at them on my web page.  See my pix from the UK Tribal
Gathering and the April 30 Anti-Criminal Justice Act demonstration in London.

More to follow!  Enjoy.

How did I get subbed to the neo-hippie  astrological network?  Im glad we are
now talking about the cosmos more often now.  I just want to know if this new
calendar will make it harder to find out when the full moon rave is going on?
 Will Wicked also be on this calendar?  I hope the clubs will be on it too...
 just think we might have to have 2 weekly calendars. 
      
While we are at it I was thinking of changing my sleeping patterns...  I
think Im gonna start getting up at 6am rather than going to bed at 6am.  To
make this _rave_related_ I would like to know if any of you have tried this
and how did it affect your raving?  Were you more "tuned in"?  I hope this
will improve my overall karmic vibe which in turn will bring raving into a
much more focused cosmic light.

I am so glad that I have just enough room in my mailbox!  If I missed any of
these very imprortant RAVE RELATED (hint hint) posts I would just die: )

PS. Please take this post in good humor.  I know I am probably getting a
reputation as a grumpy old man but I really am not; )
I would just like to see raving and this list get back to what it really is
about...   RAVING

If we can't admit that all aspects of life come together (ie: RAVING and
politics,RAVING and moon calendars) then we are no better than our
government, who has one of the first admendments(separation of church
and state) but chooses to control how they interact.

If we would start to accept others ideals (yes even fraser's) than we can
become more educated and will make better decision to improve our
future.

If you can't accept the fact that even fly farts effect our raves then
you should check out a book called THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT. I don't
remember the author, but we had to read it for one of my physics
classes. It might be a paper written for the class only, I don't
remember. It has many good theories about the effects of small items on
large masses. Who would have ever thought that man, a bug less then
1,000,000,000 times smaller than the earth could do so much damage.

Greetings to all of U & all ravers all around the world!

What's my deal with rave -> damn, I'm from Europe where it likely all 
comes from (doesn't it?), it's more than music, it's a passion, a 
drug. I'm able to forget about everything during dancing...

I 'll spend my whole summer holidays in the States, probably in 
California & I'm not willing to live wihtout rave for almost three 
month ('d be a hell of a nightmare)! So who I'm looking for are guys 
who wanna support me through the world of rave overthere. How about?

I just subscribed to get the possibility for this announcement. I'm 
using a public server with limited capacity & therefore the list- e's 
are too much for me.

So, if ye are interested in an acquaintance ye should send me an e to 
my personal address (Michael.Soier@uibk.ac.at).

Special thanx 2 all of U (Mike)

Raving is different things to different people, maybe you should tell us
what it is to you, that you can't find the space to let in what it might be to
others.

 I believe I wrote a very lengthy post about a week ago that explained what I
felt raving was I know you (geoff) responded to this so I will not boor
everyone with it again.  I have no problem with other people thinking rave is
this or that...  in fact I was the one who was complaining that you guys were
not letting jon be verry unhappy with Dust...  the difference I see between a
post like jons and a post about the lunar calandar or DOS is that Niether the
DOS post or the Lunar calandar were _directly_ tied to raving where jons post
was.  
  
I mean if I were to follow the idea of some of you I could start posting
about how bottled water was made etc.  well people at raves do drink water
right?   Well in that case some people drink a beer before going out to a
rave so maybe a post on how Bud is made would then be appropriate?  I think
we have had this problem a few months ago with politics...  I don't care if
you talk about Horse Shoes just make it VERY rave related... please: )

Thank you,
Rob

AAaaaaahhhh, what a nice weekend.  Went to the party celebrating Ethan's 
b-day.  A super friendly vibe.  It was a party that was really nice to 
meet people and socialize with.  Happy to have met few more sfravers as 
well as some other very friendly people.  I gotta say that sitting in the 
chill room during Allen's set was full of some surprizes.  First time I 
got to hear some punk in a chill room.  And the funky tunes had some of 
us groovin, which even brought in a street person who started really 
gettin down with us.
Thought it was real cool to see ethan raving with his dad.  Wow 3 
generations of ravers in ethans family.
Left about 5:30, with my energy level running low.  Sorry to miss Tracy's 
set, but was happy to be able to catch her at the next party at the 
berkeley marina on sunday.
This party was a party, that didn't have alot of people, but shows me 
once again you don't need alot of people to have a really good rave.  
This party had a atmosphere that let me let it all loose on the dance 
ground.  The friendly vibe brought in people walking by who just couldnt 
resist and joined in.  Got to meet some more super friendly people.  For 
those at this party, TRANCIN is the word that mostly came to my mind.  
There was some really nice shared trancin at this party.
Thanks to everyone for sharing the vibe this weekend.

Interesting. I was at there till almost 7am, and for me the place *went 
off*. (Then again, things may have picked up after you left).

I've been thinking a lot about this, how the same event can be viewed 
entirely differently be two individuals, based on their perspectives.

Looks like the same thing happened with the DUST thread.

I've found that if I go out looking for something (expectations), and 
I don't find it (those expectations aren't met), I get dissapointed.

It's been difficult, but now I go out without expectations, and try to 
create the experience I want, by putting out the vibe that I want 
created (much like Geoff's been talking about). 

Even if the venue/crowd/vibe is less than ideal, I usually end up having 
at least an o.k time, because I'm enveloped in a bubble of the vibe I enjoy.

Scoop somethingorother from KFOG says "If you don't like the news, go make 
some of your own".

Perhaps we can take it one step further and say "If you don't like the 
vibe, go create one of your own".

later...

Jonas

P.S. this is just my PERSPECTIVE. That means it's true for me (I think ;) , 
but not necessarily true for anyone else.

Wow! Whata weekend!!
I got to meet some really wonderful people this weekend...

I got to stay with Peter F. and met him in person the first time.  What a 
guy! :)  We went to Ethan's birthday party @ Komotion instead of going to 
Basics.  I got to meet some more sfravers: Tony, Black Adder, Monicat, 
Lydia and I got to see Brian B. and Brian D. again...nice to see you all 
again.  Real nice vibe going on there. 

On Sunday we went to Berkeley Marina for a great little outdoor party. 
Not many people at all, but the vibe was incredible.  The afterglow from 
the night before gave me alot of energy and I danced hard for a long 
time.  David Munik showed us his pictures from the UK and he even gave me 
a couple of flyers from there (thanks David!)  I met Geoff and some 
others as well.  Tracy spun a good set and Josh finished off the night.  
All in all, I had a teriffic time and I can hardly wait to come down 
again.  I just *LOVE* San Francisco!!! :):):)

Take care all!
love,
Amy

'Rave' culture (big floppy hats, E, and whistles) may come from Europe, but
the music was definately pioneered by Yankees (Cybotron, Model 500, etc.
etc.)..

     Dear Jon,
     
     Hope this finds you well.
     
     Your email and the issues it raised really concerned us -- but we 
     appreciate your criticism.  
     
     In regards to dust, you are correct -- this is something we all work 
     very hard at (lights, sound, promotion).  It is not perfect, but every 
     week brings new people, new perspectives and new ways to make it 
     better.
     
     In regards to the space, most people enjoy it simply because of the 
     layout; it is easy to have a conversation in one bit, while dancing in 
     another.  A lot of people enjoy the arches and mirrors -- they create 
     a sort of intimacy that helps define our club.  This venue may not be 
     the best, but it is what we have to work with at present.  It is also 
     unfortnate that the permits we have to work with allow us only a 21 
     and up crowd.
     
     In regards to the security guy, Scott -- he does work with us, however 
     he has been cautioned several times by the owners to watch out for 
     false ids.  We have had a few cases where we have had to refuse people 
     because their ids were sketchy (I didn't see yours so I wouldn't 
     know).  In any case Scott does work at another bar in Berkeley and is 
     familiar with security work.  I am sorry that you had a rough time 
     with him -- he is actually a really nice guy.  This is the first 
     complaint we have had about the bartenders; they are employed by the 
     owners of the bar.  They enjoy working with us and have never 
     complained about any of our guests.
     
     In regards to the pool table and having nothing else to do but play 
     pool:
     On the night you were there, I believe we had a dj from the Gardening 
     Club spinning -- that could account for why people were sitting down 
     initially as opposed to dancing.  However if you had stayed, you would 
     have seen people dancing.  The dance floor gets going at about 11:30 
     p.m. and usually stays busy until closing. I was the person sitting at 
     the door.  Often, when people play pool, they bang the ends of their 
     cue sticks into the heads of those working the door.  I have not ever 
     asked anyone to stop playing pool, however, I have asked them to have 
     some consideration for those sitting at the door; I don't think anyone 
     can tolerate having their head banged consistently by a cue stick.   
     
     
     In short, while we appreciate some of your comments, we don't think 
     that you experienced our club sufficiently for us to merit some of 
     your remarks.  I would therefore welcome you to dust at some other 
     point, and perhaps your experience will differ from your initial 
     visits. We understand that sf-raves is an open forum for these sorts 
     of discussions and wanted to see what people had to say about the 
     whole issue  first before responding to you -- hence the delay in our 
     reply.  To be honest, I didn't foresee the whole dust-bsp issue 
     generating the sort of feedback that it has.
     
     Thanks for your time.
     
     Saira

Well, I have to add my voice to those in appreciation of Basics this
weekend.  I haven't danced so hard in months.  The music was nothing short
of excellent all night, on a nice sound system.  The people were all
really into it... and I'm still flying from all the good energy I
came into contact with.  Hats off to Martin... cause I just had
a damn good time.

The high points for me were Doran's set (very beautiful music)
and seeing so many people still dancing in full force (including
Martin) together when the lights came on in the morning.

That's all.  *grin*

Hello to all who made it out to the smaller party for Ethan on Sat. I want
to say that it was really great seeing and being part of a wonderful vibe.
It was also great to see many of the faces I know and to meet a few new
faces... I'm still trying to put names and faces together and it usually
takes me a couple of times to get it right. I'm still looking to meet more
of the people from the group so if you see me come and say hi! I've wanted
to meet Black Adder, Amy Starkey, Derek Chung ( who's not Larry ) and others
who often post so I can put faces with the posts I see passing through 
sfraves.  

  Also thanks to everyone who gave me positive feedback on the visuals. I
really love the support and it's the vibe that keeps me doing it. So very
definitely EACH OF YOU make it happen and I do my best to think of things
that you might like to see or might be stimulating to you. When I run my
visuals at home nothing happens - but when I'm able to touch or excite a
group "everything" happens and if it all comes together I know EXACTLY
why I do it - so accept my heartfelt thanks to you all...

Also, I really got my share of hugs Sataurday and smiles... makes me realize
I've been deficient lately... everyone needs 12 hugs a day - right Milton ?

Finally, if you can think of things that would be cool to see let me know..
I'm working on an erotic set now - since I am overly tired of seeing our
society overplay violence and underplay the sensual. Also, I've made a 
tape of outtakes from movies such as Dark Crystal, Legend, Dr. 
Strangelove, some old B&W which I used on Sat. A while back we filled 
some bandwidth with movies people would like to see outtakes from and I 
got some of them. If you think of others you can always E-mail me with 
suggestions. I always seem to "blank out" when I walk into a video rental
store...

Love ya all and all of you make it happen each time you come together and
celebrate !

Mike

I believe that it was Spencer, not Darwin himself, who also coined the
phrase "Survival of the Fittest". The problem is that "survival of the
fittest" isn't that good a description of how evolution works. A
better phrase might be "survival of the fit enough" or maybe
"non-survival of the completely unfit". It is not necessary that a
particular trait be the "fittest" in order to remain in the gene pool,
it only needs to be not too harmful. Consider hemophilia and other
hereditary diseases. Shouldn't "survival of the fittest" have
eliminated these traits long ago? But they survive because they don't
kill _too_ many of the people who carry them.

But "survival of the fittest" become popular because it provided a
neat "scientific" justification for some people to decide that since
their kind of people were obviously the "fittest" they should naturally
dominate the "unfit" people, and even "help" evolution along by
eliminating them from the gene pool by programs of forced
sterilization and such.

This really has very little to do with actual evolutionary theory.
People who want to dominate other people will always find
rationalization to justify themselves. And generally have no trouble
finding apparently "neutral" people to promote it for them.  For
example when religion was a much stronger force in the world than
science, the church preached that the nobility were chosen by God
himself to rule over the peasantry.

hey all,

I was just wondering if anybody has ideas or can make any suggestions 
about the events coming up this weekend.  I am being kind of picky this 
weekend cause I kind of feel like I made a poor decision about 
attending XYZ a few weeks back.  I was hoping to get some good advice on 
where to be this weekend.  From this last sfr calender I received Funky 
Techno Tribe looks kinda cool.  Obviously an awesome line up and its 
supposed to have a beach afterparty. But it's 20 dollars and I have never 
been to a party at the Santa Cruz Civic Center Auditorium.

I realize that these parties are what you make of them but, I would like 
to go to one with a good vibe and XYZ let me down so I want to make up 
for it this time!   Especially after hearing about the cool stuff like 
Basics and Ethan's B-day party.

Would it better to wait till Sunday for family affair?

Any info is greatly appreciated...

thanks
dan

Sendin' out good Karma...

Michael Clay's visuals were nothing short of absolutely awesome Saturday
night at Ethan's birthday.  (And I'm not just saying that because he let me
work the control panel. :^)

It's evident that he takes pride in his work, and feels passionate about
the contribution he makes at an event.

This reporter was happy with what he saw.

In other news:

Tracy filled the Komotion with emotion.  Dancing took on a new meaning.  (I
felt like Snoopy at dinner time.)  I swear I reached new heights, which for
me is always a welcomed change.  I heard someone mention that he was "so
proud of her" and I must say that she made us all proud, and happy, and
sore as hell today.

The vibe, as everyone seems to agree, was right on target.

BTW Dust on Friday night took off.  Jon Williams and Lee An offered superb
sets back-to-back, keeping the crowd of 35 on their feet until 3, and then
many stalwarts headed to 1015 Folsom to end the night/begin the day.

Bye!

Tony

AAAAAAGGGGHHHH!

Here I thought today would surely be a day of rest...and then someone
sets-up a party three blocks from my work!  What is this a relentless
conspiracy to get me into shape?!

Sheesh!

Totum rave report
=================

Greetings fellow SFRavers,  AusRavers,  and AdRavers...   This Cyber
Gypsy is back in Sydney down from hot, sweaty,  tropical Darwyn.   Makes
me appreciate the wonderful winter of Sydney....Which,  by the way,  is
warmer than the summers of San Francisco...  At this time of the year,
Sydney appears to have spring-like weather in the winter.

I arrived home about 10 PM on Saturday,   just enough time to shower and
relax before heading out to the following party.


Saturday May 20th
        -Spirit Ov Thee Times - Totem Launch of "Zeitgeist"
         CD on If? Recordings featuring
         Voitek (Melb), Hi Fly (Melb), Calix (Syd), Blac (Syd),
         + DJs Biz E, Michael MD, Zeitgeist (Melb)
         Underground Cafe - 22 Bayswater Rd, Kings Cross
         $15/$12conc.       Tickets available at Hardwax

I arrive kind of early,   because it's less than 100 meters from where I
live.    Ohhh!!!  How convenient....  to have my OWN private Chillout
area...  Tee hee!

As I arrive,   Michael MD was spinning some good house trance but nobody
was on the dance floor.    After my flight back from Darwyn,   I wasn't
quite ready to get into it,   so I schmoosed around,  saying hi to all
my Sydney friends who were all wondering where I was for the past week.
Sheesh!  Already,  people are missing me.

I get the usual  "I see you everywhere!!" person coming up to me... and
after not raving for more than 13 days (OH!!!  how horrible!!  I
certainly was ready.   I had popped a couple o Daffy's about 30 minutes
before arriving,  and it was starting to come on....   WOW!!  what 13
days can do to ones tolerance...

Yet more time passed,  and the dance floor was still totally empty,
and I said  "FUCK THIS!!" and wasted no time getting out there to loosen
up.

Almost immediately,  this girl came out,   with a big smile and urging
me on.    After that,   I would say,  within about 3 - 4 minutes,  there
were 15 people dancing.   People were swarming into this small and cozy
little venue (The Underground Cafe).   It's entrance to the place has an
iron gate,  leading to the front door.   The doorman was checking ID's
(remember - 18+ to go to bars in Australia).   The door then leads
downstairs below street level where you pay $15 to get in.

As I entered the Cafe,  they had sheets hanging from the ceilings,   off
to the left,  in a raised section,   there were rows of electronic
instruments,  synthesizers,  and the like.    It became clear the this
was to be a LIVE performance of acid trance.   OBOY!  My favorite....

Down on the dance floor,  towards a back stage,  situated ONE of the 3
chill areas,  with lots of pillows,  and mats to flop down on.

Off to the right,  were tables (Cafe style),  and way in the back to the
right was the bar.   Other rooms leading to more chill areas,   and
pinball machines.   The DJ booth was just to the right, up in an
elivated section,   facing the Cafe part,  and Mike Dagn was behind the
turntables.

Mike Dagn maintains the AusRaves mailing list,  and had been a wonderful
source for rave information,  and the local radio stations use his party
list every day to announce upcoming events.   In fact,  Mike was one of
the first AusRave folks I've met (While I was in Calif.).

When the first live musician came on,  I hardly noticed it.   When I
did,  I was amazed at how well he put together his set.   It seems a lot
of people here are making their OWN music to each individual taste.   As
a result of this,   there is such an amazing amount of variety that it
boggles the mind.   Initially,  when Dagn went on,   he stayed around
the usual 120 BPM range,   but as the evening wore on,   the BPMs
gradually increased upwards to about the Australian standard of about
150 BPM.

As usual,  I literally went insane,   hopping around the dance floor
until it got so crowded that all I could do is go up and down.   As I
was chilling outside,  a few young Aussie dudes said "You're FUCKIN
SICK! - How long have you been raving?"   My American accent always
seems to get people to believe I'm from Canada.   Not very many people
from San Francisco come to Sydney,  and I'm always deluged with
questions about the SF rave scene.   I would say ... They have mostly
House and trance,  and what the Aussies call Garage house.    They would
say..  "What!  no hard core?" in total disbelief!!!

The live music acts were totally brilliant!!   All fresh new stuff.

When the live stuff was over,   I went home for a few minutes to chill
out and stretch.   As usual,  Kings Cross is insane on a Sat evening.
Kinda like North Beach in SF.   It's so crowded that you can hardly walk
on the sidewalk.

I eventually headed back to the underground cafe to hear the other DJs
from Melbourne (See the info above).   All were incredible...  And thanx
for Mike Jay for putting on such a great party.

The party went on until about 7 am.    Afterwards,   I went home,  took
a shower,  and headed off for breakfast.

Recovery party - Pavilion tavern
---------------------------------

After breakfast,   I headed down to the Recovery,  only to learn that
the trains weren't running.   They offered busses (for free - gee,  how
nice),   I eventually get there around 9:30 am.   Hardly anyone there,
so I touch base with those coming from other parties.   Learned there
wasn't much going on last night.   Other a talked to which they had come
to the Totem event.

As usual,  happy hard-core was on the menu....   I wasted no time
getting on the dance floor,  and had it all to myself.   Eventually
others followed.

It appears that Aussies usually don't stay up and rave all night and
into the next morning.   They go home,  get some sleep,  and head out to
recovery in late afternoon.

The Pavilion is having a DJ contest,   where each set is 20 minutes
long,  and breaks between each set they do.   Most all sets were happy
hard (sometimes referred to as "Kiddie Kore").   There was some Jungle,
breakbeat and hose played as well.   In fact,  one of the house DJ's
layed down a brilliant set of some really great house trance,  and
literally filled the dance floor.

As one would expect,  I heard the same songs over and over,  as each DJ
had the same record in each of their collections.   Other than that,
and a few inexperienced DJ's I heard an amazing variety.

Later on,   I meet this black dude from the UK in dreads.   Actually,
he saw me getting in on in the dance area,   and I found out he was a
DJ,  and picked up on my vibe.   Later on,  I heard him spin some really
good house (in the small room).   Which was so crowded and hot,  there
was no way anyone can dance.

Besides,  I liked the happy hard-core,  and stayed out in the main area
where is was much cooler.

I stayed at the pavilion from 9:30 am until midnight,  pretty much
dancing all the time,   except to chill and go out and eat in the
evening.

I eventually went home,   feeling really great...

So,  this wraps up yet another report from Sydney...  More stuff to
follow,  as next week is DUMBO - A huge massive rave/circus event,
alongside yet another rave "Space Cadet"...  HOLY SHIT!!   which one do
I take in next week...    Upcoming on the 3rd of June,  and my LAST RAVE
in Australia is MDMA-2 which is supposed to GET OFF!!   big time...
will be my big last Australian bash before heading back to San Francisco
on the 5th,  where I'll be at Come/Unity for my welcome home party,  so
save all that good vibe for me when I get back....

Oh!! what can I do,   no more happy hard-core....

well this goes out to the promoters
Recently the Cactus Club in San Jose decided to shut down on Sunday nights
Previously they had tried to make an 'underground/techno' take off
They failed miserbly.
Mainly due to lack of promotions In the underground scene

Well anyway, Cactus Club has the advantage of being 18+ club. The only 
one in San Jose that I know of. Furthermore they had previously done all 
day shows for 16+.

So If there is a promoter who thinks he can pull people in On a Sunday night
I think he should go look at cactus.

Saira:

I appreciate your resply.  I did not mean to wrek havoc with you or the
crew.  I was just telling everyone how I felt and what happened.  Your
response to me proves that you are concerned about the welfare of the Dust
partygoers:  Thats all that matters.  I appreciate the fact that you guys
are working hard to provide a Friday night trance environment and that you
(I remember you now) were very polite to us when we did go (twice).  I
apologize for the shrewd remarks I had made about people involved.  There
was some misrepresentation.

I think i've been sitting in front of this screen for too long.

we'll go to DUst!

See you soon

And what are you implying with the 'ambient' remark?  I love Ambient music.

well, we're doing it - tom and i are taking the big financial plunge and 
buying a set of 1200s.  i'm excited! (but i think i need a 12-step

so, we've got a question:  does anybody out there have a mixer they want 
to get rid of?  if so, please email us soon.

END REPLY (SINDAR@AOL.COM)

I thought that's what the DELETE key is for.
I'm not going to subscribe to a new list with no-one I know, post one
message about a simple program(the message wasn't even 1k long) then
unsubscribe to that list. and have 100 programmers offer their services
for $60 an hour. Id rather give that money to a raver and keep
supporting our commun. NOW THAT'S RAVE RELATED!

Just like if someone needed sound for a party. I'd be the first to reply
and the first to give a discount. IT'S CALLED WORKING TOGETHER
NOW THAT'S RAVE RELATED.

I think in everyone's heart on this list they all want to do at least
one thing that will benefit others. If they don't then they are selfish.
I feel bad if I can't put in my fifteen minutes of sweat to help
some-one. And BTW. That DOS post of mine was more rave related than you
think. Although I can't give details, my intension are to connect more
of sacramento to the Internet. Therefore exposeing more people to
sfraves.
NOW THATS RAVE RELATED

Soundgod@ICCSE.COM watched Andrew Dressler as he sweated while typing
this so fast

PS I would appreciate if you(ROB) would not reply to this letter if you
have nothing positive to say because if you don't:
IT'S NOT RAVE RELATED

Hello all...I am new to this list (boy I am pretty sure you are tired of 
hearing that line).  I am currently trying to set up a big rave in the 
Northern California area.  I have a piece of property in the Tahoe 
National Forrest perfect for an outdoor rave.  It is not near lake Tahoe 
but instead 30-45 minutes from grass valley/nevada city (to those of you 
who knwo the area).  I am planning on having it on the 4th of july 
weekend.  Currently nothing is too firm.  I am not gonna charge anything 
for this rave cause I really think we should all enjoy the music an a 
truly amazing setting (with nochance of getting busted).  I have already 
recieved some support and encouragement from people in the SoCal area.  I 
already have a few small pieces of equipment and some volunteers, however 
if I am going to pull this off I am gonna need a lot more help.  People 
suggested that I write to you guys because you were really friendly and 
helpful and that maybe you would provide some support.  I have only been 
planning this now for about a day and already close to 30 socalers want 
to attend (I hope all of you can attend too).  However I have nil-factor 
experience in throwing raves.  I am trying to contact Moontribe (has 
anyone heard up there heard of em?) to see if I can borrow their sound 
system/generator.  If any of you guys can loan me some equipment I would 
be really be greatful.  I need anything from a generator to a sound sytem 
to lighting equip to strobe lights...etc.  Anything would be greatly 
appreciated (especially volunteers to help clean up).  I am also looking 
for some DJ's.  If anyone knows any DJs that will work for cheap/free 
please tell me.  Everything for this rave is either gonna come out of my 
own pocket or donations so please help if you can.  This location is 
utterly beautiful and I would love to see a huge rave take place there.  
I am not sure, but I am kinda leaning toward a multiple day rave (like 2 
or 3 days).  I hope all of you guys can attend.  Again if you can provide 
any help to this newbie to rave orgainzing please email me or call me at 
(714) 509-0537.

Thanks in advance

	-Christian

Hi all,
I've been thinking about this recently, and it seems kind of weird and hard to
explain, but I figured you guys might know what I was talking about. 
Have you ever been at a rave and maybe you're mellowing out in a beanbag and
you kind of wonder, what in God's name am I doing here?  Why is everything so
weird?  Shouldn't I be at home reading at a desk or something?  I know that
maybe now you guys are all thinking, "To have FUN is the point!" and stuff like
that, and believe me, I think Ethan's birthday party on Saturday ended up being
the best night of my whole life, don't get me wrong, but there WAS a point in
the evening when everything sort of seemed overwhelming to me. 
Keep in mind, I'm VERY new to the scene, and maybe I'll just get used to it, and
I certainly do love it. Also, I do partake in EvErything thE ravE EXpEriEncE
involves, too! ;)  Maybe it's that stuff more than anything else, but each
time I'm therE I usually go through an initial phase of sort of a loneliness and
unsettling sense of loss, followed by, thankfully, beautiful acceptance and
friendship and love and smiling and all that good stuff.  So the night always
ends on a great note, and so I'm back out there next weekend and I start the
whole process over again.  Does this, umm, ever happen to anyone else?
And one more thing that happened on Saturday: after I was thinking about the
whole night on Sunday, I almost wanted, for aesthetic reasons, to never rave
again.  Because Saturday was so perfect.  It's like retiring after you win the
Super Bowl, you know?  
Of course, my artistic sense could never compete with my hedonistic side ;) and
who am I kidding--I'm sure I'll be dancing away next chance I get.  But ooooooo
after a night like that it'd be so cool to wave goodbye and walk into the sunset
(yeah, I realize how 'sunset' works in a couple of ways there!). Has anyone ever
thought that?
Sorry if this post is kind of self-centred but I was just wondering what you all
thought.  
Peace love and never stop dancing
Timothy

I want to thank the crew & posse of the Sunday thang @ the Berkeley Marina!
The party was right on and I had a great time while I was there.  I also
want to thank them for letting me spin a few tunes!

It was a pleasure meeting Noah (DJ), and of course seeing Josh again!  I
wish I didn't have to leave, since I knew that it was gonna take off!

to all who, like me, are a bit jaded @ the whole "rave" thing...it ain't
dead, it's just changed again, and IMHO, for the better.  The folx who do
the :), are the REAL deal.  It ain't about money, it ain't about
superstars, it's about getting relaxed, & having a good time outdoors.
Once again, people who decided to make a difference have taken their own
destiny in their hands.  The result is, beauty.  I wish more people would
take their example to heart.  If a party don't suit you, you *always* have
the option of throwing your own!  If the DJ sucks, you *always* have the
chance to become your *own* DJ.  And if you're tired of the money aspect,
you can *always* attempt to do show people your vision of what the real
deal is.

The :} posse is the bomb!

Peace out.
Audi 5, BMW 325i, & Honda Civic Si,
John

I'm at a point now that I don't usually ask why everything is so weird, 
but appreciate it.  Actually I was talking about this with a friend at 
the last rave I was at.  While chilling and watching the other ravers 
dance I said to my friend " isn't S.F. great where its normal to be weird."

Having FUN is great, but I think one can get alot more from raving.  I 
know I do.  I learn alot about myself, psychologically and spiritually.  
Alot of times its fun but not always. Usually ends up being fun if I'm 
willing to learn about whats going on.  
What I learn alot is that theres alot that I don't know whats going on, 
for  I can't understand it intellectually, but I'm finding that I can 
understand it more spiritually.  THat is a place that we share.  Its not 
just about what *I* know but what we experience.

Tim,
I think its great that your able to talk about this with us.  No your not 
the only one who doesn't always feel great at raves.  I've had my moments 
here and there as well.  I could do without those moments, but I also 
appreciate them, because I've learned alot from those times.  I think we 
all have are ups and downs whether at a rave or not.  They may vary in 
different degrees.  I think one can experience many different and varied 
states of mind at a rave.  I know I have, and with that have had the 
opportunity to learn more about myself, by looking within and also 
learning to look outside myself, moving toward a greater sense of 
connectedness.


> Sorry if this post is kind of self-centred but I was just wondering what you all

> Timothy

I don't think you have to apologize for sharing your experience.  Sharing 
whats going on with yourself and with others just adds to our overall 
shared connectedness.  I think its ok to feel lonely, but we might as 
well feel lonely together by sharing these feelings as well.  With that 
we can transcend the feeling of loneliness  to one of shared harmony that 
allows us to be alone and together.

        Well, i too have been at this/these points too.  I've even said to
myself "i don't want to go out to a party ever again" (though it's more
from a negative stimulus) and you often do have to reach deep down inside
and question WHO you really are.  And, IMHO, if you come up with an answer
that can be written out in stone it's probably not the 'right' answer ;)  I
think that we, as ppl, and this culture in general, are in a constant state
of flux and change.  That old saying goes that the 'only constant in the
universe is change,' and i totally beleive it.  I've often hit those points
though where i ask (either on a personal level or in terms of 'raving')
"where do i/we go from here?"  it's kind of scary to look to the future and
see it as being so unpredictable but, hey, that's chaos theory for ya!
Also, i just finished reading this interesting book by Robert Anton WIlson
called the Masks of the Illuminati (kinda a metaphysical detective story)
wherin one of the main elements is this archetype birth, death,
illumination, birth...like you are born in the dark, walk through a valley
of darkness and then are reborn into a golden dawn and then go back to
birth.  I think that raves culture is like this, constantly changing, and
i'd say that now we're past the birth stage and are sorta walkin through
that valley of darkness waiting for the next step in things, that golden
dawn :)
        hugs,

I *totally* think that that's what's happening - and to think, I'm having 
such wonderful experiences now, while we are still in that "valley of 
darkness..."  I hope I don't disappear like the people on the on the 
airplane in the "Langoliers" because that light was so beautiful when we 
do get to the golden dawn...:)

 Can anyone tell me if they happen to know if there is any good clubs in 
LA for Friday night. We are looking for happy house/techno/trance - 
whatever. If anybody knows of anything illegal being organised that would 
be all the better.

	HI Y'ALL!!

		This is not from Chris, I'm just using his account.  Chris and I went to X-FILES,

Yea, I went.  I dj'd in the ambient room.  I spun for the first three hours
of the party, then took a breather outside.  I just walked back in with no
problems.  I was never questioned regarding in's and out's.  The people at
the door did not know me, so it wasn't just a friendship thing.  I saw the
big "no in's and out's sign", and wondered why knowbody ever said anything
about it all night.  I personnaly sat on that loveseat for about 15 minutes
with no hassels what so ever, except for a friend who was very hap-EEEE who
kept walking by and kissing me.  And really that wasn't so bad ethier.   I
danced for a while and although it was hot, it wasn't so bad for me.  My
only beef was that there was only one bathroom.  I would like to note that
although there was only one bathroom, it stayed fairly clean and well
stocked with paper all night, which is amazing for a rave (or atleast the
ones I've been to.

I know two people who had just about the times of their lives that night,
with now hElp from chEmical substancEs at all.  They were higher than I had
ever seen them, and it was all pure consciencness.  At around 2:00 a.m. or
so they were letting people in and out with no questions and had opened the
huge garage door about 4 feet up to help air out the place.  There were
about 50 people outside or maybe more, and the dance floor didn't seem too
crowded.  All in all it seemed to be a very good party to me, and I
personally know alot of people who had a really good time there.  I am not
trying to devalue your experience Dorena, I just want everyone to know that
some people had a really amazing time at the same party you were miserable at.  

Just trying to balance out the Universe.

>Sorry if this post is kind of self-centred
Its actually the kind of post I keep reading this funky ol' list for --
communicating <personal> experiences.

I think you just became disconnected from the vibe -- it happens.  Usually a
friend or other kind soul will come over and talk to you , give you a neck
rub, water, candy ,etc. -- refreshing, reviving, reconnecting.  So if you see
someone sitting there and looking spacy and disconnected, go over see if they
need reconnecting :-)  
Also, I think it has to do with many parties limited enviroment choices--its
hard to beat an intelligently planned outdoor event.  Indoors, I will
sometimes slip into a mood where I don't feel like being in the main room
because I'll  have to dance ;-) outside is too cold if its even an option and
if its there the chill room is spacy and relaxing but kinda putting me to
sleep.  Sometimes a bar area will have a lounge enviroment and that sorta
works, but what I think I want a lot of times is a creative cafe kind of
enviroment where I could get something light and yummy to eat, a cool
beverage, and fun stuff to do: read, make art or music, play with a computer,
TALK, etc.  Come to think of it, the Gardening club is pretty close to what I
was thinking of in terms of overall feel.

I did.

I was in Sacramento that night on business.  This was the second
time I've been up there and, wanting to go dancing, have found a
party by dropping by Tom's coffee shop in midtown.

Around 1:30 there was no guy in yellow overalls at the map point
only a sign that said "party full, sorry".

I drove to the nearest gas station where around 6 car loads of
people had found one guy who knew where the party was.  We caravaned
to the midsized workshop/warehouse area.  One small street was lined
with cars.  The security patrol car was bribed or *real* rave friendly.

I talked em down to $8 cuz that was all I had.  I went
in and out many times without a problem.  They had 1/2 dozen fans
in there plus sliding door was cracked.  Quite honestly, I did not
consider this a hot (temperature) party.  Super tiny chill room
even had AC.  The whole party was a pretty big production
with a good sound system, lots of lights, and lots of
alien decorations.  And lots and lots of Acid House.

The crowd was more fun than what I've seen the East Bay draw.
It kinda reminded me of a outdoor summer freebie crowd at 19th
and Ill.  It was a mix of somewhat "serious" raver folks and
people who "had been at another party and heard about a
place to go dancing ..."

I couldn't help but think that an allnight, bust free,
illegal, map point, good production, acid, warehouse party was
the kinda thing that can be pulled off in Sacramento but is
probably very difficult (rare) down here.

It was pretty fun.  Nice for a little afterhours 
dancing in a town lacking many places to do that.  
Anyone else go? 


Dave

But on the other hand, sometimes we have to accept that connecting to
the vibe may not necessarily be the solution to what's really going on.
While raving may be a truly spiritual experience for some of us, there may 
be times when all this connecting, oneness, love, fun, etc. just is not 
gonna provide a satisfying answer to some of Life's big questions like: 
Who am I?  Why am I doing with my life?  Where is my life heading?  What 
am I looking for?  Can anyone *really* understand me?

Raving is very much an of-the-moment thing, a place in spacetime where we 
can sometimes transcend ourselves and connect with larger forces.  But we
can't always live life in these kinds of moments.  Unless we are in a 
state of continuous escape, reality will come to us in forms that raving 
may not be able to address.  I think it's important not to avoid the 
deeper unknowns, the fears, our doubts and confusion about our place in 
the Universe.  Because these things tend to creep up on us eventually.  

I have known of many people who at some point find the rave vibe to be 
contrived and meaningless.  What I think really happens is that it just 
becomes irrelevant to one's more immediate concerns.  When this happens 
to me, I just take some time off from raving and focus my energy 
on a different positive direction; reading, writing, composing music, 
configuring a software package... something that feels productive and
worthwhile.  To rave is to affirm.  Transcendence is not the same as
self-avoidance, it is more of an extension of who we are and what we're 
about.  Life will always be a challenge, and raving is one way to 
celebrate our willingness to rise up to it.  Sometimes we have to step 
outside of raving to do that.

this new calander.  NEED HELP from those with knowledge of the 13 moon 
calander....Is this RAVE related now?

PPS I read in England's Dreaming there was a youth movement in the 60's 
called 'Ravers', like mods and teds etc....

Subject: Rantin' Review of the Weekend
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     This weekend unexpectedly opened up for me so I was able to go out all 
     weekend :)  Starting the networking buzz w/some friends, the line up 
     of events included Brothers & Sisters, the End-Up (always!), invites 
     to two parties on Saturday, Basics, and the Boat Party.  With a 
     line-up like that and with friends who have more stamina than me, I 
     ventured out with a positive feeling towards the weekend.
     
     In lieu of Brian Darkness' description of Brothers & Sisters/Zendada, 
     I had a terrific time.  It was my first chance to check it out and 
     lots of "scenesters"/friends were there en force.  Since I had a big 
     weekend ahead of me, I worked myself into a natural glow by the time 
     it ended.  Taj's set completely trancended me and Tracy's?? set got me 
     moving even higher when I went upstairs after the end of the Taj's 
     set.  
     
     After 1015, we headed over to the End-Up where we continued to groove 
     until it was time to close (~1pm).  I always have a great time there 
     'cause I can be a freak and be with all the freaks.  Unfortunately 
     even this party gal got sidetracked (for you geriatrics, I felt like 
     Pat Montandon of the rave circuit :)  I didn't make it to the two 
     parties but I was able to get over to Basics w/a friend, Dana, who was 
     catering for the event.
     
     This was my second Basics and based on my previous one, I was looking 
     forward to it.  Though I had reservations of some aggro vibes that I 
     experienced from another East Bay 18+ event, I had a warm, glowing 
     feeling that this was going to take off when I was driving there.  
     From the moment I walked in the door, I knew this party was happening! 
     The enthusiasm and openess from so many young people flattened any 
     negative vibe or thought for miles around.  From the people directing 
     traffic, to the door people (we got to bypass the line :)  to the 
     owner's son & friends working the snack bar, everyone (except possibly 
     the owner of the rink who seemed overwhelmed) was enjoying the 
     vibe--even if they didn't know what a rave was.  I even got a kick out 
     of some people thinking I was 1) associated w/the skating rink; 2) 
     married to my Dana and just happened upon this; or 3) thought I was a 
     narc in the parking lot.   I guess I just don't look 18 anymore :}
     In any case, like many others have said in previous posts:  the music 
     was excellent; _and_ Martin and his crew did another exceptional, 
     beautiful gig.  I'm still glowing from this experience!  bzzzpht!
     
     Driving back to SF, I went to the End-Up and heard reviews of Progress 
     where an acquaintance of mine (Al-Jay) dj'd.  I was sorry to miss his 
     set but it was good to hear this one went better than the last one...I 
     guess they're making progress ;)   After some R&R, I made it to the 
     BulletProof Boat Party where we continued our roll and onto the 
     after-party at Mission Rock.  
     
     The music at BulletProof and the after-party was great.  Lots of funk, 
     jazz, dub, and even some rock.  (Excuse me if I get the music terms 
     wrong, I tend to have my own labels...)  It was definitely a great way 
     to mellow out after another lost weekend in paradise.  If you've never 
     done the boat party, I'd recommend it.  It's pretty special to feel 
     the rhythms of Mother Ocean in synch with rhythms of our hearts and 
     the music.  We even had a guest appearance from the sun before it set! 
     I'm looking forward to doing it again.
     -----
     Well, work has been hectic yesterday and today, so I'm finally sending 
     this out as choppy as it is.  Hope you all had a great weekend, too.  
     It was especially nice to finally meet Jonas, Milton (and the 
     E-Bee)from sfraves and even Duran from LA.  As always, I look forward 
     to meeting more of you at other gatherings.
     
     Hugs and warm embraces,
     Diane

hi all!
I was at X-files also and had a great time.  I was afraid we weren't going to
be let in because we left berkeley a little on the late side, but we got in
no problem.  I had been looking forward to this party for a while now and was
not disapointed.  As soon as I got in, I had to use the bathroom pretty badly
and had to wait in line, but I'd say that was pretty much all I wasn't too
happy about.  I got to see a lot of my sacramento friends and even quite a
few of my SF friends there.  The music was amazing and I thought one of the
best sets was the second to last (Dennis).  I only got to hear part of Mike
Moss, but what I heard I loved.  Carlos blew everyone away, as usual and the
ambient room was great also.  I spent quite sometime in there.  Overall,
everyone was friendly and I know the promoters did not expect quite such a
large turnout, but I was very happy.  I'd even say I liked it better than the
Basics party the next night (but then again, I was running on no sleep at
Basics!).  The music at Basics was unbelieveable though.

I'm new on SFRaves, so hi everyone!!!

Love,
Mary

hey timothy, 

I too have felt the sort of confusion that you are feeling.  But Timothy 
,listen to me very carefully, you are growing.   Many times the rave 
experience can in some inexplainable way get us to face our insecurities, 
deep questions about ourselves(questions that we may not have even 
thought we had, ones like you taliking about),
and to generally begin a path towards self acceptance.  In addition, it 
seems that the level of love and acceptance that we experience 
in our relationship with other ravers during the party, leads us to want 
to find those same feelings in real life relationships that are on the same 
level. To find others with which we give and recieve  
enough trust, warmth, and sincerity that we can really be ourselves without 
feeling guilty or out of touch with our true inner spirit.

It is in my opinion that it is your choice to look at raves as occaisonal 
escapes from reality or to view them as vehicles to help analyze yourself 
so you can effectivly bring yourself to peace at many levels.

The door has been opened, it takes courage, work, and willingness to go 
forward.

peace

i have to questions for you peoples. first off, does anyone out there 
have any old rave called sharon flyers that they'd be willing to part with??

my second question has to do with santa cruz civic auditorium.  a while 
back I went to xyz there and it really sucked.  big time.  the crowd was 
awful and the vibe was at an all time low. i notice that often certain 
venues attract certain types of crowds. so my question iz, are most raves 
in that place like that or izz it just because it was xyz?   also, i 
remember talking to someone there who told me that most raves in sc 
attract a more gangsta type crowd.
laters!

 My experience with the Santa Cruz Civic , rave-wise , was an event
called Lighthouse. It was great! Music-wise , and also interesting
were the tables set up with political and philisophical information.
Smart drinks , clothes , etc.

 The crowd was a great mix of ravers , hippies , body-pierced black
leather folks , and other folks.

 RE: criminals - one of the worst rave experiences I've ever heard
of was near a beach park many miles north of Santa Cruz . Folks
beat up and robbed. But the S.C. Civic , like the Richmond Civic,
is in close proximity to the city police department.

but you never know what  the wonderful santa cruz police department is 
gonna do  ... i guess it'll be ok so long as no one sits on the

   A couple years back there were some Mister Rogers parties that
were held at the Santa Cruz Civic Center.  These parties still
rank as some of my favorite raves.  The crowd was great, the
setup was really cool (they even had a petting zoo!)
When i went to XYZ, i was hoping that they would follow in
Mr. Rogers footsteps...boy was i wrong...(i've heard this
about most XYZ parties).
   Anyways, I know that the Civic has great potential.  I guess
it depends on who's throwing the party (how it's promoted) and
who attends.  we can make it a great party (i hope that isn't
too cheesy =)
   I hope to see lots of people there.  I haven't run into
many sfravers lately.
 
   Oh, and i'd like to slip in a little BSP...
 
  the Cloud Factory is having a party saturday afternoon, from
 12:00pm to about 8:00pm....then we'll be packing up and going
 to Funky Tekno Tribe (well, those of us who still pay $20
 for parties  ;)  our party will be free and is weather permitting.
 it will be at a beach in the santa cruz area.  call 408.457.7726
 for more info....

Hey I had a big wet one at friday's party in the basement of 1015.  
Free to SFRavers!  (before 2:30am I think) Ya gotta love that.

Ok there were basically three different clubs going on, which may be abit 
confusing.  But there is something interesting to see here.
I mean sometimes we want to hear Tone Loc in the front room yapping about 
his Wild Thing and it's always good to stand around the walls of the main 
room and watch serious faces grind their posterior regions into others to 
undeterminable melodies and wayy too much bassss.  It was reflections of 
the way life used to be (sing that part) and I'm glad that we have 
alternatives nowadays.

Walk down to the basement and be pleasently surprised by a 
decent groove and a fair amount of sweat.  The floor was slushy and fun 
to slip around on.  The music was there for the taking.  This party is a 
good thing coming.

o.O

Whoooaaaaa! I can understand all of your complaints about the people and
the heat but don't say what you don't know.

Pierre happens to be one of my good friends and I happen to know for a
fact that he did not make much money. He and his dad spent all day
fixing up the place instead of working on cars. Right there they lost
money. They had to pay me for sound. More money gone. They paid for all
of the supplies. More money. Also they did shut down the map point but
everyone somehow found out where the party was.

I do greatly appologize though for the overcrowding. It was way over
promoted, and he realizes his mistake.

All I can do is appolagize.

Hello everybody,
	First I want to say an extra special thanx to the Basics crew, 
(again.) I am still on after glow from that party!!! (It's wonderful!) I 
also want to wish Ethan a happy birhtday again. I hope you had fun!! 
	
	Now, coming up in... two weeks, (geez, that came quick, I 
thought it was farther away!,) Harmony and Re-Groove-A-Nation, bring you 
our first actually party together. We tried to do a free outdoor, but 
got rained on. So we are really looking forward to presenting this one:

	In the Beautiful month of June, Friday, June 2nd to be exact,
	
		We invite everyone to join us for a night of hugs, 
		smiles, love, joy, and industrial strength fun!!!!
		
			 "Beautiful People"

	Djs: Graeme La Paix		DRC
	     James (Santa Cruz)         Ernie Deaks
	     James (San Jose)           Trent

	Visuals: Michael Clay
	Ambience: Dionysus Dreams + many guests 
	(408)450.3044   & (408)486.9591

This party will be somewhere in the range of $5-10, most likely 
according to the time you arrive. It will be indoors, and go from about 
8pm-6am, with a possible (weather permitting) free afterparty. 

We have invested sooooo much time and energy in the parties that we have 
done, and especially this one! I don't know if you all know the reason 
we are doing this party, or why we named it Beautiful People. Well I 
will go over it real fast:

At Harmony on March 31st we all were watching the party, and noticed how 
beautiful it was that these 400 or so people had all come together in 
one room to dance and form a beautiful vibe. There is just something 
really special about people coming together like that! We felt that 
throwing that party was not enough thanks to everyone. We put hella time 
and energy into it, but we wanted to do something more.. So we are doing 
another party, trying to make it better than the last one. So that was 
our inspiration... Now the name represents everyone in this world, not 
just some, not a few, but all!!!! No matter how mean, nasty, or evil a 
person is, we believe that they are beautiful. Maybe beautiful way deep 
down inside, but still everyone is beautiful and everyone should realize 
that!! 
	Now, one of the members of Harmony, Joe, was at Richmond Civic 
one day. He was laying down in the chill room after a long night of 
dancing, when a certain person walked up. His name is Baktash (I don't 
know how to spell it!), and he basically inspired Joe in such a way that 
I had never seen before! Baktash said," Come on! The party is not over! 
Get up and dance! You are all Beautiful people!!!!!" And with those few 
words came our inspiration for the name! 
	Call the info lines for more info on our parties, and/or give us 
your e-mail/snail mail addresses, for our mailing list!!
(408)450.3044------(408)486.9591

Peace, love, and harmony to all beautiful people,

Greg (shroomy)

Alexandre Dumas was a party animal.  So when I stumbled across this line in
The Count of Monte Cristo I had to write it down.  I think it's pertinent
here:  "Joy has that peculiar effect that at times it oppresses us just as
much as grief."

I too have been slapped with overwhelming feelings of cumpunction, but have
gotten through them by sharing some mellow time with a friend, or alone.
Maybe gotten some air.  Heave a sigh.  Share a smile.  Focus on the DJ for
a while.  Whatever it takes to overcome those black-holes of thought.

I think it's more than just a coincidence that ecstasy and epiphany both
start with e.  ;^)

I would have to agree with your assement, Tim, it has more to do with "that
stuff" than anything else.  Drugs are funny like that.  Especially
hallucinogens.  When I first started "that" I kept telling everyone that it
was truth serum, then I told them that I loved them...

Tony

Wow!!!
     Ethan's Party was soooo much fun!!!  I know what you mean about the
moments of introspection and the desire to ride off into the sunset with a
contented smile.  I'm often torn between embracing the vibe or rejecting it
as a as a state of drug induced mass euphoria.  It helps to kow that short
of a few dazed and drooling peking moments I can dance just as hard, feel
the same elation and experience the same childlike fascinations without the
use of pharmaceutical refreshments.  Until recently I'd never mixed drugs
and dancing.  I love the things I've experienced so far, I've learned so
much about my self and life in general.  It's wonderfull when positive
individuals can congregate todance, talk and share in experiences which can
seem only too unusual in every day life.  A smile and a hug will go a long
way no matter where you are.  

My first ExpErience was at a full moon on a beach in santa cruz.  Everything
about that day was so perfect that I couldn't imagine how anything could
ever compare.  I waited a while before partaking again and in the interim I
did alot of thinking.  I came to the conclusion that so long as I continue
to be happy with my life and my progess towards short and long term goals
it's quite alright to experience whatever life has to offer to it's fullest
degree.  E is for ecstacy but like anything else can also be used for
escape.  In my limited experience I have found that drugs can be educational
when used not to escape life but to enhance it.  That's what I believe life
is all about:: learning, growing, and experiencing the world around you.

                                        Smiles,
                                                  Reza

Hi All,

I'm having a hard time finding any of Ethan's mix tapes and was wondering if
anyone has any suggestions. Stores that usually carry them like Ameba seem to
be out. Ethan if you're reading this do you sell any directly? (great Party
by the way!)
Also a friend of mine is looking for tapes by Doc Martin and hasn't had any
luck. He has the C.D. already. 
Well it was wonderful to meet a few more of you at Ethan's party (hi Amy,
Monicat, Tony, & Black Adder!). Black Adder if you're reading this please
send me Dan's Email address if you have it.
Hope I meet more of you soooon!

Love Lydia

P.S. Brian D. time to saddle up!!
P.P.S. Brian McGonigle gives the BEST Hugz!!!!!

Well, even though it is several days after the fact(came down with the 
infamous "raver cold") just wanted to say that Ethan's B-day party was 
GREAT! (thank you Ethan) A big hello to all the wonderful people I met, 
Amy, Tony, Lydia, Timothy, Michael, Monicat, Gringbeast, Brian D.(thanks 
for the awesome massage), Brian G.(does give a mean hug), Brian T., and 
everyone else I may have inadvertently forgot. It was really nice to sit 
down, and start talking like old friends. As impersonal as text can be 
sometimes, it was a nice feeling to think that I came to know people 
through this list and the discussions we all have had.

I LOVE Henry- Isn't he the guy that said house music could have been created 
by monkeys or something like that? He is a real family man with his power 
book and tired lungs- 

Punk is alive and so are the hippies but when do they 
get together and throw a fun party? 

"The word "hip" translates roughly as "wise" or "tuned-in" A Hippy is 
somebody who "knows" what's really happening, and who adjusts or grooves 
with it."

I heard there was  a punk underground party in some warehouse recently?
And don't hippies party at the shows?

Best bet for Doc tapes would be to call Beat Non Stop in Hollywood. I'm
sure they do mail order. If they're out, call Street Sounds, also in
Hollywood.

The Rollins Band _was_ punk, cf. Life Time, Hot Animal Machine.  Their
latest album is the most unlistenable bunch of jazz-metal bullshit wank I
have ever had the displeasure to hear, with the possible exception of "Liar"
which manages to rise above the music.  I mean, ads for PowerBooks and The
Gap speak for themselves.
	I won't slag on him too badly, because his older books, spoken word
shows, and music have been a source of strength for me in hard times.  Anyone
who can write passages like this:

	"To try and walk through walls...Brilliant people sit perfectly still 
with contented smiles on their faces, their end calculated down to the last
breathing moment.  They know damn well that you can't walk through walls.
That's brilliant.  This brilliant guy once asked me "How did you get all those
bumps on your head?"  "From trying to walk through a wall, you idiot!"
I replied.
	
deserves a great deal of credit.

	KMFDM is guitar-industrial that occasionally sounds almost as good as
Ministry did circa "Burning Inside".

	Neither currently challenges anyone's assumptions about how life can
be lived.  By this standard, rave is more punk than punk has been for a long
time, with the possible exception of Fugazi and other hardcore DIY bands.
There is nothing different about getting up on stage at a club and playing
rock instruments, no matter what you sing about.

 Does anyone have any details about the S.P.A.Z. fundraiser that 
is supposed to be happening tomorrow? I called the number that was
posted earlier this month [ (415) 522-2398 ] , but that only has 
information about a June 16th event.

I caught nice sets from Ruben and Mark Farina at Simply Done last night,
the joint doesn't get going full speed until about 2am, but it's reliable.
This weekend, try the Stompy party on Friday, Funky Tekno Tribe on 
Saturday (if you don't mind driving to Santa Cruz for a big party), and
then Sunset (if it's happening) and the big Spundae party on Sunday.  

Orb tickets are on sale now at Rough Trade in the Haight for $20, no
service charge.  

I'm not going to make the text version of the calendar for ftp'ing anymore
unless there's a big protest.  Those of you without web access can ftp
the HTML file directly (/raves/sf/calendar/sfrcal.html) or use lynx
(lynx http://hyperreal.com/raves/sf/calendar/sfrcal.html).

Thanks for all of the input so far.

Hey all,
	I was wondering if anyone has info regarding that post from a 
couple of weeks ago from Fraser Clark's Megatripolis org.  The message 
said they were accepting resumes for positions ranging from doorman to 
manager, and left a po box to send to.  They left no phone number or 
person's name. 
	I am interested in applying, but I'd like some more info first, 
like exactly what positions are available, and a phone # to make a follow 
up call with.
	If anyone has any info re: this situation, could you please email 
me, privately or via sfraves.
	Thanks, 

		jon (gonzo@leland.stanford.edu)

Maui and I were wanting to spend a day or two in Santa Cruz, and were
wondering if anyone could offer some crash space this weekend. If ya
want, we can bring records and make a party out of it :).

Likewise, if anyone knows anything fun going on elsewhere in the bay

Dear All;

	Being a recent transplant from the East Coast I noticed that not 
many ECDJ's are around the SFR scene, Ok(tapping foot repeatedly) how 
bout an inflex of some new people, not that I dislike our DJ's, not the 
case at all. But I personnally know some killer DJ's in North Central 
Florida where I was from, and what about New York, and Phila, come on SFR 
scene live up to your diversity!!!!!! But the city by the bay, and da 
people who inhabit it, no matter where I'm at will always and forever be 
in my heart, and a purrrrmanet part of my soul :), and no I'm not leaving!!!!

Dear All;

	Did someone say fundraiser, just a friendly reminder that I'm
available to all promoters to provide massage therapy/first aid at the
fundraising events, for sliding % proceeds given to a cause. Which means,
depending on the cause I provide massage at your event, and donate a
percentage of the proceeds to the cause. Like AIDS & FOOD type benefits
get +110% of by proceeds, and others causes vary depending on how
important it is to me. Of course 1st aid is always free, as it should be, 
and can be there at our event to do just that. See ya

Dear All;

	The warmer weather is upon us. Dehydration and Heat Prostration
are our to biggest ememies and some of my biggest concerns. During the
hotter days please please drink lots o fuilds, if you start getting a head
ache that just won't go away, or a general shitty feeling, these are some
of the 1st signs that your on da road to trouble. Be aware, check in with
your body, it only takes a few seconds to do that, take frequent breaks.
Ampfedtamines can speed up this process, dramically, so please promoters
have ice avilable, & fans or a room with da AC on, 1st aid people have a
oral thermometer available to access body temperature(I always have one
available), you can literally cook your brain, please if in doubt, find a
cool, shadey place, and rub yourself or have someone else(ew ew :)
prevention can be fun) with ice and drink fuilds. Don't hesitate to
approch me or another and ask for help, its never too much trouble and I
promise I won't thing you're neurotic. I want to meet your all with smiles
on your faces, not crying because you thing your going to die, even though
thats ok too. The best way to deal with this is to prevent it, and as
always I''m available to hold your hand if your scared :).

I really think there is a lot of talent locallay that is just not 
exposed.  I personally don't want to *pay* for *big* djs to come to sf to 
play the same music someone else might be playing but they just dont have 
a big name or an agent and dont know how to *break* into the scene...the 
"scene" just needs to be open to more djs spinning who've never been 
heard before...and everyone needs to encourage more people to dj!!!

Within central California there are hundred of djs they are easy to 
find...just look around (I know about thirty to fourty people who dj)

In cases of typical raver jaw-clenching, the other kind is probably
safer.  And more fun, too!

Tell that to the punk band that's praticing next door to me...They'd 
appreciate it, I'm sure. "Give it up guys, sorry. You don't exhist."
They would probably throw a beer bottle at you and tell you to fuck off.

In SF Weekly, it mentioned that an army of Teutonic Techno DJs will be

    Hello,

    I'm looking for record shops around the Bay Area with a
    good selection of dance vinyl...Ameba I know of, though 
    the couple of times I've be in there, the selection hasn't
    been overwhelming (great store though, maybe I just hit it
    at the wrong time).

    Seems that quite a few people on the list buy records, so 
    I thought this would be a good (and hopefully appropriate)
    place to ask.

    For now,    
    Gary

like doug, i would just LOVE to hear james christian and adam x out here!
anybody with a little extra money want to pay their way out here?  :)

and if only we could get junior vasquez...:)

guess travel's just kind of expensive and not really on ECDJ's agendas 
too much...

As a service to you and my pals who own some of these stores, I'll go ahead
and give away the goods.  You can dial 411 for info & number:

SF
==
BPM - on Polk St.
Star Alley Records - 1 block South of Hayes cross street is Gough
Tweekin - lower Haight.  Pierce is the cross street
Soundworks - Valencia & 15th (415-487-3930)

Berkeley
========
Leopold
Primal - on Telegraph

San Jose
========
Solid Grooves/Outer Rhythm - S. Bascom (408-999-0259)


There are lots more that have used records and the like.  But the above is
where the bulk of dance music is distributed.  Some of the stores have
serious attitude unless you're one of the major DJ's.  But most of them
have staff that are willing to assist you in your selection of material.
Shop around and see which store suits your musical taste and style.  IT
will take a while to see  the relative strengths of each store.  Discovery
of this is part of the adventure.

Have fun, but most of all have deep pockets.  It's a drug that should  be
illegal ;).

P.S.  You think that there's a heirarchy in the clubs when it comes to DJ's
huh?  You ain't seen nothing when it comes tno record shopping.  The
pecking order, & perks that come with being a well-known, constantly
playing DJ, makes the club stuff look lame.  Maybe one day I'll post some
of my observations.

 A side note to visiting record stores - you may make a good impression
if you bring your own headphones to preview the music with. The store's
headphones get beat up from constant use , and are expensive to replace.

 1/8" stereo plug size seems to be the norm - none of the stores I've
been to use the old 1/4" stereo plugs on their amplifiers.

I totally know what you mean.  I've seen stores pull records out of someones
"hold" bag, let someone els hear it, then sell it to them right there.
Total disregard for the person who put it on hold, all because the person
was a more popular dj.  And this is in Sac, I can only imagine what it would
be like in the city with all of it's top name brand dj's.

Larry C, bay area old-timer sed:
 A side note to visiting record stores - you may make a good impression
if you bring your own headphones to preview the music with. The store's

 1/8" stereo plug size seems to be the norm - none of the stores I've
been to use the old 1/4" stereo plugs on their amplifiers.

Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

Counterpoint & addition:
I agree with Larry.  What I have found is that some stores discourage use of thier phones (like BPM & Solid Grooves).  So it is a good practice to bring your
own phones.  The other thing is the type of headphones @ each store are in
various states of either disrepair or functionality.

My lowdown:
BPM - shitty headphones, terrbile listening stations.  Bring phones.  If you
can bring some new turntables and amps too.

Star Alley - What listening sation?  Know what you're looking for, since
they generally do not allow the general public behind the decks, IF the
DJ ain't busy they might play something for you (Charlotte aka the Baroness
is quite kind and will play what you want w/o any 'tude).

SoundWorks - 4 listening stations with cheap-ass headphones.  Bring your
own.  BTW: Observe the common courtesy in these stores.  Try not to bring a friggin caseload of record to listen to during busy days.  One day @ Soundworks
some schmuck literally had over 150 records and hogged a station for 2 hours
during the most crowded time.  Very selfish.  Be reasonalbe and give folx a chance to purchase.  The merchant will thank you.

Tweekin - 2 Listening stations.  Terrible tables, 1 of the amps is real shoddy.
Also the listening station is way too close to the "preview/wannabe" area. SO you'll have to turn your shit up loud at times.  Also, even w/ a no smoking sign posted, bastards still light up in there.  I think next time I'm there, I'll politely 
ask the offender to stop.  Other than that it's ok.

Primal Records - 3 Listening stations.  Actually quite nice compared to the drivel displayed in other stores.  The headphones are nice, the tables in good condition (btw ALL of the decks there are 1200's).  You do have to turn it up a bit since Rob
is usually previewing stuff, and often times people are practicing w/ the latest.

(Note: Soundworks also sports all 1200's at their stations).

Solid Grooves - 4 sations.  Fairly nice equipment.  Bring your own phones else you might get a pair in disrepair.  So far though that has happened to me just once.  Good stations, even a cd listening area, only 1 cornball 1200 wannabe deck.
The others are 1200's.  Their preview/wannabe area is controlled pretty
well so you should be able to hear what you want w/o too much interference.


Record store owners:  If you want people to buy your goods, be sure that folx have a chance to listen to their chosen cuts.  Turn the demo/preview/wannabe area
down some will ya!  geez...

Like larry said, bring phones that will do either 1/8" or 1/4".  You can't go wrong then.

Pax,
John

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Ok, I'm going to bust myself and give up some more goods about our
wonderful record stores in the area.  They are from my *own* experiences,
and my observations of other folx experiences.  Your mileage may vary.


Tweekin' - I have had hit and miss experiences w/ this store.  First let
me say that their selection is impressive.  A fvorite haunt of the
old-school cracker jack set, as well as mf's tryin' to push up.  I have
never had a good time at this store.  Yes, I've bought some great records
there, but their general attitude is, "You ain't so-and-so, so you ain;t
shit."  I get a wierd vibe in there everytine I visit.  I've4 talked to
one of the owners about it, and I will start dealing exclusively w/ him.
The other two blokes who work there are not helpful and are really into
being 'tude dudes.  Go in with heavy armor, pick out your records, buy
them, go home and practice, get really good, play out, become known, play
some really big parties, get even better known, and *THEN* you can go in
and be greeted w/ some respect.  Until then, welcome to the thrall.  They
do have some good records though, and even I have had to backpeddle from
saying "I'll never go in there again." due to the bombs they have had.

Soundworks - I really like this store.  The people are REALLY nice.  It's
run by some of SanFrandisco's gay set and has none of the pretense other
stores in the area may or may not have.  They are very happy to help you
choose your records, and they will tell you what they are playing and
whenre it's located.  I really can't go on enough about the attitude in
the place, since I have had nothing but good experinces w/ this store.
Tom is the guy I usually deal with, and if you wanna know about any music
the store has, he's the man to ask.  The DJ preview area does get loud at
times, but in general it does not hamper you choosing records.  If once
of the boys are behind the decks, and you hear a song you like, ask 'em,
and they'll tell you where it is.  Oh, is that the last copy he's
currently playing?  He'll usually take it right off and hand it to you.
They wanna sell records, and it shows.  It is also THE cleanest record
store in the area, and nicely laid out.

Solid Grooves/Outer Rhythm - One of my favorite places to shop.  The
staff is always ready to help and goes above and beyond the call of duty
to get the track you want.  They are more than happy to gtet you what you
want, and, if you ask real nice, will sell their own records to you *if*
you ask real nice, and want it bad enough.  More importantly, they care
about their customers.  There is a freindly rapport they have with
everyone who enters the store.  You are greeted w/ a smile and if all the
staitons are full, they will invite you to the wannabe/preview area so
that you can listen to the records you chose.  They do hella special
orders.  Brandon's the man, or talk to Ryan, or Mark.  All of them are
down to earh and ready to help.  The record selection is really good.
You'll find what you want, if not they'll order it for you!

BPM - Hmmmm...I haven't shopped there enough to give any critique other
than what I witnessed there while shopping a while back.  Most of the big
DJ's like to shop there. Uhhhh...yeah, that's it.


Part #4's coming up...the pecking order.

John

Subject: Record Shopping - Are *you* a *DJ*?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Undeniably, the second worse feeling in this scene is not having
enough juice to be considered *worthy* during record shopping (of
course for any real partygoer the worse thing is Not being on the
guest list ;) ).  What I mean is:  "Hey, how do those guys get the
bombs before everyone?" or "Why is that guy unloading a box directly
into a brown bag labeled 'DJ x'?" or "Why can't *I* buy that record,
NOW!?"

If you're asking yourself or other people *ANY* of the above
questions, consider yourself part of those that are not to be
considered.  Not to be considered that is, unless you spend lotsa
$$$'s in any particular store.  Short of that, you've gotta have a
name to have game.  And, IMO, it sucks!!!

Most stores in the Bay Area do the bulk of their business w/ people
who "wannabe" a DJ.  The other chunk is people who love house music,
the other 1% are the DJ's who spin to eat.  The one's who spin to eat
are in a category of their own (let's face it, their pro's), and are
treated like it.  For these top 1% of DJ's the stores will generally:

-Get a shipment in and reserve the choice cuts for the pro's. 
-Give heavy discounts to the pro's. 
-Give all kinds of preferential treatment. 
*If you have a cut on hold, and it's the last one, and a
DJ needs it, it may be removed from your bag and put into that of the
purchasing DJ. 
*Some of the stores are owned by DJ's and they *do*
look out for each other.  Some stores owned by DJ's look out for
themselves occasionally and will deny you a cut because they need it.
 Sometimes people forget *who* the *customer* is.

-Preview a shipment for a DJ and reserve the cuts they think a DJ
might like. 

*I have NO evidence for what I am about to say.  But
let's just say I do notice trends as they happen.  In short, I think
that often times a record store orders tracks for a DJ, or finds a
single cut for a DJ.   Until the DJ plays the cut, you will *not*
find that cut.  Once the cut is played, you will notice "new
arrivals" of material that you heard 2 - 3 weeks ago.  If you're
lucky 1 week.  I think this is intentional.  I also think it is a
necessary pact w/ the devil (read pro DJ).  If I'm a store owner, and
I have a feeling DJ x will like a tune, I would order it.  Just one
copy (I have a biz to run and I have to keep my inventory as low as
possible).  If he/she plays it out, and they crush hella heads, I can
rest assured that if I order more they will sell.  But since the DJ
has not used it out all that much, they want to get some wear before
the biting public (read DJ wannabe's) has access.  So I suspect that
they notify the dealer that the track works.  The dealer delays the
order by a week to give the DJ time to work it.  Next thing you know
it's readily available.  It works, but this sucks.

DJ's view or pref-treatment:
Let's face it, if you know your favorite DJ shops @ a particular
store, and you wanna buy some records, like the ones your fav DJ
plays, where you gonna go? Probably to the store they shop @.  And
beleive me, a DJ knows this and uses it to their advantage. 
Rightfully so, IMO.  It sucks, but I can understand how/why they
leverage their juice.  Hell, I know that if *I* am bringing bizness
to a store in really large volumes, that I want to be compensated for
the store actually cashing-in on my rep.  The buck has gotta be
passed.

(BTW:  On the above note, I am supplying this info as a favor to an
inquiry. Right now it is diffuclt to glean info from anybody about
anything. I am doing this to bring bizness to my friends, and to also
keep house music alive and well.  It can only flourish if people
purchase. Simple as that. I am NOT posting this info to get
discounts/treatment/whatever.  Where I have juice I have juice.  Where
I don't, I don't.  I shop everywhere I can, and enjoy buying
records. Just thought you wanted to know if my angle was anything
other than being the Oracle of the Sphinx.)

Not all DJ's do this, but I know if I could, I would take advantage
of it. I use my economic clout to get what I want.  The problem is I
can;t spend enough money to have juice everywhere, so I concentrate
my spending in areas where I'll be the most comfortable.  So far that
has been Soundworks & Solid Grooves.  Now I don't get any set-asides,
but I do get treated well @ both locations.  Primal has also been
very good to me, and I hope to increase my bizness there during the
summer.

In short, don't get mad.  There's really not much you can do.
Boycotting stores that give pref-treatment is non-effective. 
Especially since everyone wants to be a DJ these days.  Where 10
people drop off, there are another 30 ready to buy.  I think most
importantly it's good to know who you're doing bizness with.  Develop
a rapport with the owner, order some stuff special order thru them,
and thank them if they help you out.  Introduce yourself so that they
get to know you, and shop there often.  Spending money also helps
them get to know not only you as a person, but you as a money
spending record buying junkie who'll they'll have hooked in a
fortnight.  One more fortnight and you're theirs.  They know it and
use it, you should use it as well.

Peace.....

I choose my records by a Bukowskian standard, If we order a record and it 
sits unpurchaced for a month, I listen to it to find out if its too awful or too 
good, usually its one or the other. And yes our first pair of listening 
headphones I found discarded and broken in my van. A homeless person had 
left them, they were a hearing-test model.

I think rollins sucks, I must say I spun Black Flag :pre-rollins:.   "no

I have never heard a better ambient song in  my life: positive , comforting 
and uplifting, and very dj friendly.

MTV wants to do a story on herbal ecstacy and those kinds of products and 
even wants to visit S.F. to inspect our scene. We don't sell herbal ecstacy but I 
was curious if there was any one out there who has had positive experiences.

They know about hyperreal.com! And I bet there are MTV lurkers here!

Subject: whatsa "wannabe"
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


I received a pice of mail from someone on the list, noting my use of
the word "wannabe".  By the tone of the note, the person took it as a
slightly insulting word.  Au contraire mon frere...

I use the word because IMO it is accurate.  If you are buying records
in the hopes of spinning out, then you must wanna be a DJ.  If you
have aspirations of playing for one of the large parties, or even the
now mythic "Wicked", then you too are classified as a wanna be. 
Hell, I even box myself in that corner.  It's not meant to be a
slight against anyone, or any person aspirations.  But there are
people who are DJ's, and there are the rest of us hoping for *any*
chance to play outside of our homes & dwellings.

There is of course the other wannabe that I really despise.  You will
definitely meet them as you shop.  Yes, they are the ones who get a
huge stack of records,  and *try* to mix.  Now, once again, I have
nothing against people mixing, and having a blast, but why do it @ a
store.  More importantly why do it when you have NO INTENTION OF
BUYING.  Hell, I've seen it plenty of times.  Someone comes into a
record store, not to buy, but to listen.  Now while some of you might
say , "Hey man, music is for everyone.  Why not just take some time
and listen to some tunes.  There's no harm in that!", you would also
forget about people like me, and others who are there to BUY. 
Therein lies the difference.  People like us, the purchasers, the
hooked, the junkies, are the lifeblood of this cottage industry.  If
a wannabe is hoarding records , just to listen, then I have no
opportunity to purchase the tune, especially if its the last one in
stock.  I leave the store w/o making the purchase, the store loses my
business, but the wannabe has had his fill, and has left the
establishment w/o purchaing anything.  Everyone loses then.

There are certainly times when I'm not so hardcore.  Mostly when a
store has a slow day.  Or if a store, like Ameba (I've not been in
since they started selling discs), or Behind the Post Office,
Tweekin', Primal etc. has some decks and someone wants to go off,
then its all good.  But when a store has got new product to sell, and
the store is packed, DJ practice time ain't then IMO.

I guess my last experience @ Soundworks w/ the guy who had over 100
records is still sitting bad in my gut.  I have also spotted the same
weenie @ Solid Grooves, doing the same thing.  Hogging the decks. 
Death row, whata wannabe know!

I'm quite done for today.  I did not mean to offend by using the word
wannabe, since I apply it to myself in my ambition to get better @
this particular art form.  But as you can see, the hunt & lust for
vinyl has it's ugly side too.  Its a fight of the fittest for the
best vinyl.  She's a tempestuous mistress, that shiny Jet Black,
sometimes, Clear woman we know as Lady Vinyl.

Peace & have a good weekend all!, 
John

P.S.  That P-Dog is throwing a little hoe down tonite.  Stompy Stomp

Feliciano.  Should be a good party, even for a Friday.  Yep, it's @

        Dancing and chewing some gum and blowing bubbles at like 6-7 am
(when EVERYONE wants gum) and having this wide-eyed ;) girl come up to me
and grab my shoulder and say "Hey Hey how are you? Can i have a piece of
gum?" I say "sure!" and as i reach to get it out of my pocket she says "I
hope it's watermelon flavour, that's my faaaavorite" "ha ha ha" i say as i
pop a piece in her mouth.
        She must have thought she was having taste hallucinations, i mean,
how many ppl chew watermelon bubblegum other than me?
        I think she might have cracked a couple of ribs with her hug. :)

Here is a poem I thought some of you might like ... not much to do with
raving, but it caught my attention.  The author is a woman from Coquitlam
named Renee Norman, and it was recently published in The Vancouver Sun.


____________

The Queen Of Between



deep in cyberspace

i tap out clever messages that

sizzle

my reluctance has given way to

full screen abandonment

i am naked but unseen

i am sultry in my

old jeans

i will say

anything be

anyone and

with a flick of

control x

i send waves of

emotion spiralling through

the net

entering entering

internetting

i am the queen of

between

seduced by a computer

until the dog throws up

and cyberspace dissipates into

rug cleaner

i rub circles with

my cloth wand

i am spreading oil

on water

i am coloring the

world with

foam

one reality

another

i am bent but willowy in

supplication

i will rub

anything be

anyone

i am the queen of

between

seduced by a rug cleaner

then the phone rings

and =8A

bye, renee

Hi, this is Bruce Eisner, author of the venerable Ecstasy: The MDMA Story.  Since I'm probably one of the 
oldest ravers, my roots go back to the 60's, when I was a "hippie."  Hippies liked rock music and along the 
way to the 'Ninties and raves, I had a few favorite rock bands.  One of them, Stone Roses is playing at the 
Warfield on the 31st.  Now I realize this doesn't have anything to do with raves (at least not recently, back 
when the Stone Roses first came out in England, they were considered part of a new genre of bands 
connected with the rave scene there, playeed on the Isle of White etc.).  The Stone Roses came out with a 
great first album but tried to change labels.  Their old label got an injunction and they couldn't release 
another album for three years.  Now, they have released Second Coming and are touring.  I heard about 
the concert and found out it was sold out simultaneously. If anyone has an extra ticket and would like to sell 
it and have the company of a ex-hippie who is still somewhat a hippie and definitely a good story teller, 
please let me know soon. I found out about the concert on Alt.music.psychedelic but everyone there wants 
tickets too. I just thought someone might have wide ranging music tastes (like I do) and have an extra 
ticket.  You can contact me at any of the means below and I';ll pay  a little above face value but I'm not rich.

:)  well, maybe this one ya had to be there for, but...

i'd say it was at "the other new years ball" at 938 harrison.  we walked 
onto the dance floor and there was our friend daniel, looking exactly 
like The Crow from the comic book, all in black latex, with dark make-up 
over his eyes, and holding a cigarette and a bottle of champagne in a no 
alcohol and no smoking party!  so as he's standing there being all cranky 
and cool, sfraver susie, all big, bouncy and all in white runs up to him 
and jumps on him and gives him a huge hug, almost knocking him over!  tom 
and i just cracked up.  but you probably had to be there...

	I gotta agree with John on this one (although I'm not from SF,
this situation holds almost everywhere you go): Store 'tude sucks
balls (to put it baldly). I have with my own eyes watched a big-name
DJ from a good-sized Northwest city open up a crate of new records and
start throwing them on the in-store deck, putting aside ALL copies of
the things he likes becase "<person X> and <person y> [both themselves
Good-Sized Northwest City Big-Name DJs] might like this" and when I
tremulously asked (tremulously because I knew what was coming) if I
might be able to buy a copy I received the Hairy Eyeball of Death.
	Fuck that! I'm a complete music fanatic. I consume records and
CDs the way most people eat or do drugs. Hell, I buy records the way
most people _breathe_ -- compulsively and instinctively. If you, as a
store-owner, refuse to sell me music because I'm not cool enough, you
are needlessly pissing off a potentially loyal and big-spending
customer (I have an order for 49 records (that's over $200 worth!) in
at Submerge in Detroit right now, f'rinstance). When I find a store I
like, I stick with it until it goes out of business (and, sadly
enough, most of my favorite stores _have_ gone out of business -- I
hope it's not my breath ;).
	However, more often than not, store employees condescend to me
and act like my enthusiasm (and cash) are unimportant. This ties in
closely with the clannish idolatry that I find to be the root of most
scene evil. This sort of bullshit has happened to me so many times
that I now buy almost all of my music by mail-order as a matter of
principle: it's cheaper, the people I deal with are friendlier, and I
can always get the music I want.
	It doesn't help that every wannabe (and I _do_ use the term
with condescension, unlike John -- there are DJs (people that spin out
or in their bedrooms or for money or at free parties but do it because
they love the music and care about the crowd) and there are wannabes
(foul leeches that DJ because it enhances their standing with their
peers and makes them "cool")) immediately jumps on every big track and
throttles the life out of it. Wannabes have a bad habit of buying
records without even listening to them, just because someone better
known than them said it was the thing to buy. I think an awful lot of
Josh Wink records get sold this way, but then again, Josh has a fair
amount of talent as well, so I won't hold it against him. You should
never buy music because it's trendy -- you should buy it because you
think it's good. This is what separates the wannabes from the real
deal -- wannabes all buy records that other people play, the DJs I
respect buy records that they like. If I owned my own store I'd be
pretty dismayed (if not disgusted) by the lemming-like behavior a lot
of the lower-echelon DJs evince.
	With that said, I do agree with John that it's a good idea to
establish a rapport with a friendly salesperson at a store. Even
though they're still pandering to you, if you're nice to them they'll
be nice _while_ they're pandering to you. My experiences at this
mysterious NW store have gone from horrendous to tolerable since I
started actually talking to the owners & employees of the store. I'm
still not gonna spend much cash there, but I can go in there without
grinding my teeth now.

	I thought I might add that my friends who frequent the Bay
Area stores recommend avoiding BPM because its records are overpriced,
and if any of you out there are technoheads, Rasputin's is the place
to go. My girlfriend was in the Bay Area a week or two ago, and she
found me two very nice records there (Mr. Ballistic Volumes 1 and 2 if
you're curious), and said that the salespeople were knowledgeable and
friendly. I know that Rasputin's has a bit of a reputation for some
people, but it's got the goods and every time I've been there (all two
of them) I've left feeling good about the store.

ONE OTHER IMPORTANT THING:

	If you know what you want, don't overlook mail-order. Granted,
none of these places can let you listen to tunes, but if you know what
you want, you don't need to, do you? Here are some of my strongest
recommendations:
	EAR/Rational music (ear-rational@xmission.com) can get just
about anything for decent prices. Dave's a nice guy and works
exclusively through the Net. I've dealt with him many times and always
been satisfied by the result. I think it speaks volumes that he's
still in business and his advertising is almost exclusively through
word of mouth.
	If Detroit music is your thing, Somewhere in Detroit
(submerge@garnet.msen.com) and Record Time (RecordTime@aol.com) are
where the greats themselves frequent and are run by genuine Detroit
techno heroes. Submerge has unspeakably great prices for the stuff
that they distribute -- four bucks per slab of vinyl, and dirt cheap
shipping. They're the true soul of underground techno, straight from
techno's motherland. And they do carry a lot of house (Simply Soul,
Happy Records, 430 West, Teknotika, Red Planet), although you and I
could have a chat on the various merits of Detroit, Chicago, New York,
and San Fran house. Record Time carries a variable quantity of stuff,
but they quite often can get you stuff nobody else in the world can.
	If you're into East Coast house and European techno (from soft
to blisteringly hard), Planet X (SpikePx@aol.com) out of New Jersey
will do right by you. Spike and Larry at Planet X are great -- tell
them what you like and don't like, and they'll set you up with good
stuff. These guys have impeccable taste. They've also been known to
mix up tapes of stuff that they think you might like and send it to
you so you can pick out the stuff you really like.
	OK, I think I've balanced the ranting and useful information,
so I'll stop here. Sometimes I just gotta let all of this stuff out of
me.

yrz,
ozy

PS - If you have cherished memories of reading "Johnny Mnemonic" from
years past, steer well clear of the movie. Good acting on the part of
Messrs. Rollins, T, Lundgren and Reeves (really! These guys are all
right in an action flick like this), great sets and wonderful graphics
sequences cannot overcome horrible directing, trashy cinemetography,
poor casting, and a cheeseball script (sorry, Mr. Gibson!). Yet more
reinforcement of my belief in Hollywood's ability to screw up my
childhood memories.

that may be true to some respect, but if your on top of lables, the 
sounds, then you know what you want. order it. for example, i do all my 
ordering for jungle thru various stores mainly 'cause people don't know 
whats up wit it. some stores might cater to certain dj's, but if you know 
the score it shouldn't be a bother at all.

Yeah, many of these stores have reserved piles for the name DJs.
I've been shopping with some of these name DJs so I know that they
get very special treatment, including material that never makes it to the
shelves unless they don't want it.

Yup, all boycotting will do is keep you from gettin _any_ bombs
cause there are ALWAYS some hungry jackles ready to crawl over you
to get in there.  I learned this lesson personally with soundwerks where
I didn't like the fact that they would put records on my visa but wouldn't
pass the 4% discount on to me.  I decided to not shop there, problem is
that have been getting HELLA bombs these days, really good stuff, the
only person getting hurt in the boycott was me :(

Yeah, folks are worried about Acid and E and illegal drugs,
I keep tellin them it's the MUSIC that is the real subversive
force,  I spent 10 times the money last year on records then any amount of
"drugs" that I've taken in the scene.

I'm pretty happy with most of the dance stores in the Bay Area.  You deal
with the listening environment they give you as best you can.  I do *not*
buy in stores that don't have listening stations.  

My only wish is that would-be purchasers not put their fingers all over
the vinyl.  Especially if it's not a track that will go out the door
with them.  I know lots of people do that, but it leaves finger oils
on the vinyl (clearly obvious) which are dust and gunk attractors over
time.

	Pure Space at the Sound Factory?!  I have to admit that I was

	venue can be redeamed if there is enough vibe (well _almost_
	any venue, I still ain't going to 16th & harrison :).  Last
	Thursday was DubTribe and Spun and the Vibe was strong, not a

	this kind of vibe within club walls in a very long time (though

	Pure Space will now be on my "high rotation" list, especially

by far the best store IMO is solid grooves. brandon, harry, jeff, the 
rest of the crew are the nicest people in the world. they are very 
receptive to anyone that walks thru the door, and try to accomidate 
everyone's musical taste.
as far as getting the 'bomb', know the music.. it's not that hard to find 
out what is being released and most people have fav. labels, and 
producers, so order the stuff in advanced.
i personally order all the jungle for solid grooves, mainly for my self, 
but because i know the music.
just MHO.

Well, I've really been enjoying jsl's running commentary on DJ stores.
Most of it reflects what I've seen, although I wouldn't put quite the
same emphasis on some of it.  But a lot of the tugging for the hot traz
goes away if you look at it like this: buy what you like, not what you
need.  Unless you're in the 1% spinning 4 food, it doesn't matter.
The great tracks that are also popular always get reordered, and they
will be around.  Case in point, Pierre's "Shine
remix of Midi Rain.  OK, that's a bit of a stretch, that one's three
plus years old, but it's findable.  

Second point, for every great track you think you need, there are three
more in the same store you haven't heard yet.  Patience and persistence
pay off.

I never had the treasure hunt mentality until I started DJing again :-)

Man, I thought I was the only nit-picker when it came to this shit.  Maybe
Im just really old school (my dad taught me how to handle records
*properly* many moons ago).  But this *touching* the track shit during
buying is one of my major peeves.

Oh well, I guess the old-school must @ some point make way for the new
school.  I for one will *always* have respct for others, and the vinyl, and
keep my grubbin' junkie hands & fingers OFF the tracks.

Peace,
John

I got to agree with Geoff, I'm going to try and go on a regular basis, 
especially if I can get friday off like did yesterday.
Dubtribe and Spun were at their best, and the out of town dj, (didn't 
catch his name) had a great set as well.
Always nice to see Geoff trancin out on the dance floor.  Hope to see 
more sfr's next time out.

For those of you who are wondering, we've decided to call off the new 
moon party this weekend.  We've had location and equipment difficulties, 
and besides that it just felt to many of us that it was time to take a 
break.  On a positive note, this virtually ensures that the weather this 
weekend will be great :)

And judging from the calendar it looks like an outdoor weekend!

						see you out there,

When I can wake up early enough,I like to watch it because there are many 
cool references to geek talk, like the little kid wanting to increase his 
clock speed but instead turning the rest of the world into 8-bit.  
Everything was rendered in low resolution with 16 colors and the 
characters were all dumb.

Or whenever someone seeks the sage advice of the old man Fong, they have 
to first beat him at a game of life-sized Pong.  And he quotes scriptures 
from "Old readme files".

I dunno if they still show after it Bump in the Night - 30 minutes of 
claymation and a way cool blue-bathroom-scrubber-guy named squishington, 
or squishy for short.  Yes!

Someone gave me some herbal ecstasy (I don't think I'd want to pay $20 
for it).  I took the whole package (just to be safe), and drank a lot of 
water (which was recommended).  I definately felt it, but it certainly 
didn't feel anything like the genuine artifact. It made me feel very 
awake and energetic, and it seemed to heighten tactile sensation a 
little bit.  It was kind of interesting, but I don't think I'd become a 
regular customer.  It's a little overpriced.

Subject: Request for contacts and information

     Dear Cybertribers:

     I attended a memorial rave here in Lexington several weeks ago, and I
 really enjoyed myself and expanded my horizons (this was my first rave,
 though I had previously enjoyed some of the same kind of music during visits
 to Chicago's "Cabaret Metro"...

     Among other things, I am finishing my coursework at the University of
 Kentucky towards a PhD in Musicology, which is where music theory, practice
 and history intersect with anthropology and sociology -- i.e., not just what
 kind of music is happening (or happened), but why, and why did they do that,
 and what did it mean to them, and what did it mean to the audience, and what
 does it mean now???... among other questions like the meaning of life...

     Anyway, I am presently involved in a graduate seminar on Ethnomusicology,
 which used to be the study of "ethnic" or "world" or (excuse this awful term)
 so-called "primitive" music -- which really means, non-Western-European-Art
 Music, which is actually TOO complicated for our Western music theory systems
 to handle sometimes...  and I would like to correspond/e-mail/talk/chat with
 any and all Cybertribers and Ravers...

      PRIMARILY, because I want to learn more about Rave and Techno and the
 whole Temporary Autonomous Zone -- Dance -- Music -- Family thing I saw at
 the rave in Lexington...

     SECONDARILY, because I would like to interview DJs, practitioners, fans
 and anyone else even remotely interested in this form of music/dance/event
 so that I can try to explain this to my fellow ethnomusicology students, who
 have never experienced this type of thing before (other than the several who
 are percussionists, and have a little experience in the electronic drum arena)

     FOR THESE REASONS (plus the fact that I really like what you are doing and
 want to participate again in the near future...) I want to ask anyone who is
 at all interested to contact me with information or insight or wisdom about
 any of the following:
     + When did you first experience Rave or Techno dancing and/or music?
     + What interested you in the Cybertribe or Rave family and/or music?
     + Who started this, or where did this originate, or how did this start?
     + When did you first DJ or record or create or sample or mix...?
     + What does this music/dance/experience mean to you?
     + What are your favorite artists/groups/recordings to mix and/or play?
     + WHEN and WHERE are the next Raves happening (I wanna be there!!!) ?
     + Would you be willing to share recordings/articles/books/ other stuff?
     + Who are the real authors of (Beltane 1993) "Cybertribe Rising" ???
     + How does Rave affect (or fit into) your "other" life (day job) ???
     + How do you meet/interact/communicate at Raves? away from Raves ???
     + What are the unwritten or unspoken rules of conduct at Raves ???
     + How much sponteneity is welcome at a Rave (for instance, what would
 happen if I showed up at a Rave with about five or six of my percussionist
 friends with Trinidadan steel drums and bongos and Brazilian samba toys and
 bells and brake drums and other noisemakers, and we passed them out to all
 who wanted to participate, and added some more sound to the Electronic ???
 (RELAX -- I am not at all suggesting this, I just threw out a hypothetical
 situation -- DON'T PANIC, I AM NOT GOING TO CRASH YOUR NEXT RAVE !!!)
     + What is the worst situation you've ever encountered at a Rave ???

     I have many other dumb questions, because I am fascinated by the Rave and
 wish to understand it better -- so I can participate more fully the next time
 I attend (which I hope will be soon !!!)

     PLEASE RESPOND -- NO STRINGS ATTACHED (you would just be helping me out)!

     I am especially interested in meeting Ravers in the Lexington - Louisville
 - Knoxville - Cincinnati - Indianapolis - Chicago - St. Louis - Columbus areas
 since these are readily accessible to me (just south of Lexington on I-75 in
 beautiful Berea, KY.

     Thanks!!! Peace and Much Love...

     Philip A. Todd (Phil)  (606) 986-3279  patodd0@ukcc.uky.edu

I just got back from the Funky Techno Tribe.  A pretty girl gave me a 
blue slip of paper.  Written on it:
Deinition of a RAVE
     A place to let go of everyday tensions. To express yourself in a 
way that's completely comfortable. It's a melting pot of souls and a 
place to learn.  You'll find truth here, I promise you.  The word 
negative has no place here.  You won't be judged, just understood.  
A place where strangers become friends and the air you breathe is 
filled with LOVE!  Lesley

Due to some unfortunate incidences, I was unable to go last night.  What did
people think?  Was it a good party?  I hope to go to the Organic afterparty
(right now!) and was wondering if anyone has directions??  They are not
posted on the line as of yet.  If not, I will just drive down there and look
for it.  Thanks!!

Love,
Mary

        I think that a lot of the 'e' in herbal 'e' is _expectation_.  If
you think you're going to be flying, you probably will. (too bad placebo
doesn't start with e).  Seriously, though, if you want an energy boost from
hell, try getting your hands on a liquid extract of ma huang (ephedra).
I've tried this stuff and about 75-125 ml kept me dancing until 11 am (!).
It's about $20 Canadian for a 1 oz bottle.
        hugs,

I went to Liquid at cat's alley last wednesday.  The music
was good.  People were nice.

I went to Stompy at 177 Townsend.  The music was not doing it
for me.  Stripped down 4x4 bass drum booming for it's own sake
and nothing else is At Best an amusing reference to, oh fuck, who
cares ... John Howard improved it some but I was bored so I left.

now on Saturday night

there was a private party for Malcolm Mclaren
at the Rococo Lounge and I'd been invited.  Punk rock hero and
dance music icon.  I had read of his recent involvement with fashion
show choreography; including a new runway influenced album.
(are you 'punkers' getting a clue yet?)
 
Naturally, my pre-party prediction was for a room full of 7ft tall
super vixens.  My friends know of a certain weakness I have for Cavorting
About with model thin Amazon women dressed to the nines.  I was not
disappointed.  

Mr Mclaren was introduced  - he babbled about flying in from Warsaw 
where his album is #1 and said something about the Sex Pistols last gig.
I introduced myself later.  On Satie (featured prominently in his new
music) he said "Romantic but not Stupid".  Chit chat with NY models here
for the weekend - "People from San Francisco are so much more hip".
Girls, I couldn't agree more ...

DJ melodrama.  My friend Glenn stuck to his guns.  He was asked to take
it from lounge to funk to house.  I know he was out there buying Diva stuff
to mix with Mclaren's music earlier that day and he did an excellent job.  
Glenn has a tendency to tell me endless stories of Goa Trance, Trance This,
Trance That, Crossover Trance and, as you might imagine, he sped things up
later in the evening.  People dug it.  The dance floor was full.  I step
outside and upon returning find him booted from the turntables by "a 
friend of Malcolm" who proceeded to clear the dance floor.  He was 
actually a party promoter guy for SOMA magazine (party sponsors) who
thought he could do better.  Glenn was outraged.  "I was hired to play
my music" -  "The crowd was into it" -  "I've played this stuff at regular
(non-rave) parties and people went off!"  So he reclaims the turntables and
then Mr Mclaren walks over there.  I was hoping for a truly Dramatic Blowout.
Something Spectacular.  But alas, all he did was say hello and thank him for
a job well done.

This party was all writers, radio, and industry types.  I admit to feeling
a bit like a spy there.  I had great fun, though.  I grabbed my free gift bag
and stepped outside.  Two gentleman came up and had a conversation in front
of me.  They spoke of my Entourage (twins I came with and, yes, I do like
entourages) and without blinking an eye said "Sacramento crossed with LA".
Other than the Bay Area those are the two places I have lived.  
That is a *really* wierd ability to have, in my mind.

:^)

My eXperience with herbal x is good. It's kinda refreshingly different.
Very energy-uppity type stuff. If you've ever done acid it kinda gives
you the same visuals but in a more sober sense.

Get the stuffed nicknamed NOVA dont do that stuppid stuff in those AM/PM
packets. They suck!

Here is my story......

When we got to SantaCruz, we had to wait in line until about 10:30 because
the DJ was late... That would have been cool if it haddent been for the 4
sodas and a car full of people talking about dripping faucets and
waterfalls... Anyway, once in there I had a great time
The Music wasnt TOO loud and everyone had lots of smiles and energy.   About
oh midnite or so i started feeling EXtatic about teh whole world and began
handing out hand lotion and Vapo rub to anyone who wanted some..... about 2 I
began dancing around, asking people if they wanted some, gave some massages,
met a lot of nice people, and even saw some people I worked with.  :)

Yet another wakey report from Sydney
------------------------------------

Well,  I'm finally back into the swing of things and fully recovered
from last weeks trip to Darwyn,  back into the cool spring-like winter
(if yould call it that) of Sydney.

On Monday,  went to Brackets and Jam..  Not an actual rave,   but
learned that it's een around for 7 years,  and is a place for upcoming
musicians to play and get heard.   After about 1 pm,  they close the
downstairs area and the drumming starts upstairs.   It must have been a
good night,  as there was a long line at the door to get in around
midnight or so.

Things promptly closed around 3 am..  So headed home  with good vibe in
my head,   still happy from last weekends Totum event.

On Wednesday,  I wound up at the Bently Bar for the Clan meeting.  I
wasn't impressed this time,   little or no beats,   seemed mostly noise
to me,   but I kept myself entertained,  schmoosing.

I herd on the radio,  about this new weekly gig at the Underground cafe,
so decided to check out Energy.   WOW!!  Really good trance,  hard and
fast,  just the way I like it,  mixed in with the usualy Happy Hard and
its limited selections.    I had a GREAT time,  thanx to the staff at
the Underground cafe for keeping the air conditioner running and
resetting the circuit breaker all the time.

As usual,  I danced myself like there was no tommorrow,  thanx to some
Daffy's someone handed me...   Yummm!!

Things broke apart at about 7 pm.   So I had breakfast and went to work.
It's still Friday morning in the USA (A regular workday).

After work,  I headed down to Central and picked up the tickets to Space
Cadet 4.   As usual,  being an Optus costomer,  I don't have access to
0055 numbers,   but Make Dagn got the venue information for me.   It was
down where "Happiest people" was held,  in a really cool venue
origionally used for go-cart racing.   It was huge, cavernious,  and
very cool inside.   Chillout opportunities were more than adequate,  and
about the only thing that I didn't like was the lack of soft pillows or
mats to flop own on while chilling.    Other than that,  Pheonix,  the
promoter did a bang smashup job,  scarfing up this venue at the last
minute which made for a late start.

The venue was way too big for the amount of people that showed up.   I
would gues somewhere between 1000 - 2000 people made it.

The vibe was incredable.   Lots of happy smiling faces,  and someone
came up to me and handed me an "E" because I was having such a good
time.    WOW!!  My first Aussie E.    It was nowhere near as strong as
what I was used to in the States,   but it certainly widened my smile.

Dispite my usual sleepless weekends,  this 2nd all nighter didn't fade
my energy level in the least.   Super dupper HARD music,  mixed in with
the slower hard house,  certainly kept me dancing for very long times.
And I was COOL (temperature wise that is).

WOW!!  SO much variaty here....

Lots of people I met just come up and say "I saw you at....",   and want
to know how long I've been raving.   Most are surprised to learn that I
haven't raving that long.

Upstairs was the hard-core room,   but enough hard-core on the main
floor kept me there all night.

After about 4 am,  the music got turned way down,  and zapped the
ambient energy level big-time.    I just migrated next to the speaker
which had NO bass at all,  and continued dancing.   About an hour later,
the music crept up on volume and the party continued well into the
morning until 10 am.   At about daybreak,  most people were sitting on
the side,  totally hosed,   dispite my urging to get them up to dance.

As morning progressed, my energy level was still full on and increasing
gradually until the vary last song was played.

Whaat really made this rave was the lazers.   Multi-coloured lazers that
were just out of this world.   What spectacular light show...   My
breain is still reeling from such wonderful "Eye candy" ..   The lazers
were blasting right out there into veryones eyes,  but dispite the
intensity being very low,  it wasn't that annoying.   In the USA,  this
would have been highly illegal.   One time,  the lights fanned out into
an amazing pattern that gave me the impression that I ws riding down a
swerling tunnel or being swished into a black hole.   Almost forgetting
I was dancing,   I was chasing the beams all over the dance floor,
wildly Zigging and Zagging like a raving lunatic,   with a big shit
eating smile on my face....  :-)

Man,  this has to be the very best rave I've been to since I've been in
Australia.    Good work Pheonix.   Thanx to Pheonix for Guest listing
me,   I sold my ticket for $35 to one lucky dude...   I'm not into
scamming anyone,  dipite the fact that I could have sold the ticket for
much more.

After it was over,  I went with some friends,  and eventually sent over
to Recovery,  and stayed until 1 am...   After that,  back to the
Underground Cafe beore arriving home at 3 am.    WOW!!  nice bit of
raving I did this weekend.   All though the weekend,   I stayed awake
from Friday morning until Monday morning with NO sleep.   But for me,
thats normal.   Now that it's Monday,   I feel Great!!

Till MDMA-2 next weekend,  and my LAST Australian BIG rave,   over and
out...

	Ahh sunset!  Vibe so strong you could cut it with a knife :)
	Galen and crew is quickly showing everyone that you can put
	on a good free outdoor party, work with the local authorities
	and generate tons of vibe at the same time.   I wasn't there
	from the beginning but when I got there around 6:30 the party
	was in full effect.  A peace officer came around 7:00 to check
	it out but didn't interrupt the fun.  They weren't seen again
	until 9:00 (the time the park closes) when a single officer
	can down the hill with a flash light and came up to Galen who
	had put on the last record (really :).  They had a brief, friendly
	exchange lasting about 30 seconds and the cop goes away. (WOW!)
	Galen finishes and thanks everyone for coming.  This is how 
	it's suppose to be folks, because Galen kept his work this cop
	knows that he can trust him in such matters, it makes his job
	easier and he is more willing to let there be "a next time".
	I also saw a real good mixture of "old timers" right along
	with some "second generation" ravers.  As long as there are
	parties like Sunset the true San Francisco Scene is not dead!

Well,

Getting about the time that I'll be comin back home.   Just in time to
pump in some good vibe at Come/Unity,  so be lookin for the Crunchman
hopping around one again at good ol 1015 Folsom St.

Gee,  I dunno if I can handle anything slower than 180 BPM   :-)

Well,  if ya all ever plaan on going to Australia,   if you don't like
Hardcore,   you probably won't like Aussie Raves.

BUT WOW!! the energy here is something to behold.   All in All,  there
is Far more permissiveness here (Especially in Sydney).   Also a lot
more variaty,  not in just music,  but just about everything.

Anyway,   if you happen to see any of your non-SFRaver friends this
coming weekend,  tell then that Crunchman will be at Come/Unity...

See Ya all then...

The rave heart has a beat that dances in harmony with the beats of life.  
the beat runs through us all and everything.  As we move, we dance to the 
beat, when we express ourselves, we feel the beat.  When I express the 
beat to you, I experience the beat in me and in you.  Together we feel 
the rave heart thumping to beat of life, full of energy and filled with love.
The love in the rave heart vibrates and nurishes our soul.  With our 
bodies dancing and our souls hugging the love of the rave heart is 
shared.  When the music stops, we're still dancing.  For as we interact, 
whether it be sutle or more direct, we perform a rythmic and patterned 
succession of steps.  We as individuals get to dance together, moving 
toward and with the shared beat of the rave heart.  Sharing the energy 
with the enviroment around, the shared love of life fills the air.  I 
sure do love that rave heart, for it gives me so much love in return.  
I love you all for sharing that rave heart.  With that it feels much 
better feeling the beat, knowing that deep down we all share the beat of 
the rave heart.

Hello all,

I am back.  I now have an account at home thru netcom, so I will be 
here for a long time.

In response to sunset:

I wasn't there but many of my friend were and they said it went off!  I 
knew it would.  I think Geoff is exactly right about partys like sunset 
keeping the scene alive.  To me, free outdoor partys is what its all 
about. I can't wait to make it to a sunset.

I will be having next saturday and sunday off and hope to hit some 
partys.  I heard there may be a friends and family and beautiful 
people.  Can someone send me some info on these or any other grooving 
events for the coming weekend? Thanks

love chris

Wow... it's only the day after and I'm already jonesin for more.... In
fact, I need another fix rightaway! And I'm not talking about drugs
here. Sunset was an incredible party and a beautiful day. Massive
dancing-crowd positive feedback energy got the dancing vibe going just
like "the good old days".  Watching/participating with crazed dancin'
people completely going off in broad daylight is a wonderous thing.
These parties are just getting better and better.

Proof of a good party is when you don't do any psychedelics and you
still feel like you're tripping/trancing. It's all about friendly
dancin' people, and warm sunlight and a refreshing breeze and a
gorgeous view ... I also liked the dust-cloud funk-o-meter effect --
the funkier the toonz got, the higher the dust cloud rose; when the
DJ's chilled things out a bit, the dust settled. I'd say it topped out
at a 20-30 foot high cloud at one point. Wonder what song that was?

Now that summer is here, I'm hoping Sunset and other going-off outdoor
parties become a weekly thing!

'Twas Good to finally meet a few more SFravers, and Brian McGonicle
really does give a powerful hug, it is true!

PS: Can someone post the approximate DJ lineup and times they were
playing? In particular, I'd like to know when Donald Glaude was
playing...

I did make it out to sunset around 5:30 and I must say it was a great party.
 Great vibes, people, weather, etc!  It was so gorgeous!  I think the dust
got highest when the girl was singing, everyone was going crazy!  It was just
so beautiful, and made me really feel good again.  I myself was going crazy
with a slinky that made the coolest sound.  

I believe that Donald Glaude never actually did spin, but since I didn't
arrive until 5:30, I don't know if he played earlier or not.

Love,
Mary

Oh my gosh me too!!

Alas, I had to work this weekend!  I wanted to go to Sunset so bad it 
ached, but being in dire need of more money, I couldn't call in sick. :(  
I did call the info # right before I started my shift to see what I'd be 
missing and even relayed the info to fellow ravers who work nearby (I 
work in a mall!) 

Ever since Geoff's wonderful little get-together @ Berkeley Marina on 
the 21st I've been dying to get out and dance.  I'm glad you all had 
enough fun for me as well - I was *certainly* there in spirit! :) 

Anyone think it'll happen again on the 11th - which is in two weeks?  I 
have to work, but I can probably switch shifts with someone.  I *NEED* to 
go - its my fix, as Niels so well put it.  I've got some bad withdrawls...

love,
Amy

just wonderin, if *you* are gonna touch the record a zillion times after 
you buy it (while mixing) then what does a few extra finger prints 
matter??  I personally never do that while in the store since obviosly 
there's no need to touch the vinyl unless you're acshully mixing, but i 
don't think i would care wether or not other people do so.

hey all,


	I attended Funky Techno Tribe this weekend and IMO it turned out 
to be a pretty cool larger venue party.  I got in the door(after waiting 
in line for an hour) at about 2:00 am.  I danced pretty much all night 
till 7:00 with breaks for socialization and rest. 
	I also went all night sober even though I had 3 little goodies in 
my backpack.  Everything I did that night was a real reflection of 
my feelings personality etc.(as they always should be).
	*But here is the most intense thing that I have experienced 
probably since I started raving, and I was wondering if anyone else can 
relate, maybe has felt the same way, or has heard of this happening to 
other people.
	My style of dance was taken to a new energy level.  But not in 
the normal frame of context.  I don't mean it was taken to the next level 
with more complex movements, more vigor, faster, or freakier.  My dancing 
was at times more intense than others ,but that is a usual cycle it seems 
for everyone.
	What I mean is that I really gave when I danced Saturday night.
Its kind of like when a good massage therapists utilizes his positve energy 
to "heal" his client.  I now understand about what they mean about 
keeping energy in a group of dancers and sometimes if a venue is too big 
it gets spread out to much.
	I feel on some metaphysical level perhaps I was *distributing 
"my personnal" positive energy to other people.  But what I mean was that 
it was all real and that I truly beleive that my psychic energy, space, 
plane, or what ever it is that sustains our life force, was healing, 
giving energy, reassurance, positivity, to others at a high level.
	I remember looking around at others giving smiles and recieving 
them back and also feeling the rush of my spinal cord when the music was 
especially uplifting.  
	*I was too tired to go to the organic after party that 
they had lined up that *started at 10am* when the party ended at 7am.
I drove home and stopped once in the early morning during the drive to rest.

	I got home and slept for a while waking about 5pm or so.
*But what I noticed different this time was that I felt okay physically 
after my sleep but emotionally something was different.  I can't really 
say depressed, bitter or, tired were the right words.  I just felt like I 
had given so much positivity to the dance that I was almost in a sort of 
debt for disrtubting such positvity at what I believe a higher level.

Can anyone relate?
It was almost like paying to have given so much of 
the vibe that night.

	I am not devoutly religious to any particular denomination but I 
once heard that "Jesus had to take time by himself and ask for power from 
god  or whatever to help him after he had healed people(gave out positive 
energy.)
	Please don't cringe if you believe that I am being too religious by 
making such a reference to christianity.  Its just that that is how I felt.

Has anyone else felt metaphysically drained in a sense?

	
I guess sometimes we give energy heavily(like I felt) and sometimes we 
recieve heavily(like when a party keeps you feeling good for days).

 peace

dan

ps this may explain some of the comedown effects e?
who knows?

Hi,

If anyone is interested,  and can provide the space,  a good cassette
listening system,  etc.   I'm going to want all of you SFRavers to
examine some of these awsome flyers I'm bringing back with me,  as
well as a pretty good selection of some of the music played by
Australian DJ's,  made at the huge mainstream raves.

You will be able to hear first hand,   AusRaver Mike Dagn,  maintainer
of SPRAC (Syndey Party and Rave Calander),  similar to SFRave calander,
DJ,   playing some of the most trancey stuff I've heard.

I'm also going to try to bring back tapes of some of Clan Analogue
tapes and music releases.

Anyway,  if anyone has the space,  and wants to set up some type of
"get together",   put them in touch with me....   I'm returning in
less than a week.

This is true.  It also helps to find out the artist, label, and track name
of the tracks you like:  Then call around for it.  That helps me *alot*
especially because I don't really know anyone here.  I get alot of my

> Ahh sunset!  Vibe so strong you could cut it with a knife :)

Oh yeah, what a day.  This was one of the better Sunsets, not that
there's ever been a bad one.  Totally Beautiful...

Things got going around 2ish with Darkhouse who started off with some nice
ambient dub.  He soon picked up the pace and more people started to
dance as Donald Glaude took over. Gluade pushed the energy level higher 
with a great funcky/techno set.  He did a little bit of the MC thing which
didn't bother me too much.  Hard to argue with stuff like "Isn't it great 
to be outdoors!"  Solar took over  before 5 with a really nice
varied set, shifting between mellow melodic stuff and more upbeat house -
perfect for the middle of a warm sunny day.  Mark Farina came on around 6,
and delivered a typically boring, but not unpleasant set.  At parties like 
this, it's actually OK when the energy level drops and allows me to do some 
socializing.

My only wish was that the day could have lasted a little bit longer, like
forever maybe.  Tons of familiar faces, lot's of SFRavers.  Met a couple
of new ones, (sorry, forgot yer names), and got to say hi and chat with 
Lydia, Geoff, Brian McG, PeterF, Niels, Gil, Ronan & others.  

Galen took over at around 7:30 and really got things going again.  People
were going nuts as the sun set, and were still screaming at the end.  

Other notes: The've been having some trouble with the sound system lately;
dusty outdoor parties take a toll -  Let's hope our donations can continue
to cover their costs.  And it seems that we still have to work on the
garbage problem a bit.

>Thinking about it I may be somewhat deluded by this rave heart

I don't think feeling really wonderful about stuff is a delusion.  There 
is no shortage of angry pissed off people in the world to remind us of all 
the crap going on.  We also need to be able to focus on the things that 
can unite us.  Spreading positive energy to others, helping each other 
feel good and strong, teaching and reminding the world what it is that 
we're living *for* - this is also real.  There's no point in tearing down 
the status quo without something viable to replace it with.

Lee,
thanks for making that comment on my thinking about being deluded.  I was 
wondering if anyone would respond to it.  I almost did myself.  It was my 
thinking individual aspect of myself that doubted the experience.  

The sense of the rave heart is a shared experience which includes much more 
than my individual thinking.  Nice to have this shared experience validated by 
others.

Look for the video game of Reboot coming from Electronic Arts sometime next 
year on the Playstation and probably the Saturn. 

I am currently producing the video game for Bump in the Night. It will be 
released around March of next year for both the Saturn and the Playstation. 
The game will be of the platform sorts and have tons of video from the TV 
show. We are capturing the main characters frames just like they do in the 
show! So the game will have a claymation feel to it-

Yes Bumpy is still on after Reboot on Saturday mornings- Both shows are real 
fun!

When I can wake up early enough,I like to watch it because there are many 
cool references to geek talk, like the little kid wanting to increase his 
clock speed but instead turning the rest of the world into 8-bit.  
Everything was rendered in low resolution with 16 colors and the 
characters were all dumb.

Or whenever someone seeks the sage advice of the old man Fong, they have 
to first beat him at a game of life-sized Pong.  And he quotes scriptures 
from "Old readme files".

I dunno if they still show after it Bump in the Night - 30 minutes of 
claymation and a way cool blue-bathroom-scrubber-guy named squishington, 
or squishy for short.  Yes!

>(are you 'punkers' getting a clue yet?)

I attended a fireside chat with Malcolm McLaren at the Prescott Hotel,
 the day after his record release party at Rococo.  
About 10-15 people were there, and several of the younger hip types
repeately asked him pointed questions about the current ideological
state of 'punk'.  They seemed very dissatisfied when he refused to 
show any signs of being perturbed at the current high visibility and 
commercial success of some punk-inspired bands.  He added:

"Looking back, I see the Sex Pistols as more of a style statement; 
I have never tried to separate Pop music and fashion... with punk,
there was really not a lot of focus on the product itself.  What I 
created with the Sex Pistols was really an existential exercise, 
but of course at the time I wasn't totally aware of this; I was 
working as I always do, by instinct.  And, to be honest, it was 
also somewhat out of necessity-- I had these kids coming into my 
boutique, trying to steal trousers, and nauseating in the store...I 
had to find something for them to do..."

This was followed by a discussion of commercial music in general, 
centering around the perennial efforts of English musicians to break
into the American market.  I diverted the conversation and asked him
what he thought of the 'rave' phenomenon.  He had some general things
to say ... "repetetive beats ... kids needing escape ... lagerheads 
on E ... criminial justice act .. etc etc " and then the really pithy
question,
"the problem is, how do you make it carry over?  What happens in the morning
when the beats stop?"

  there are hundreds of ways to answer that question...

But we went on with a lively discussion of how raves can satisfy a 
*basic* human need, one which has been identified by anthropologists
but that is all but ignored in adult western society; this is the 
need to feel a belonging to and be surrounded by a larger social 
group, outside of one's immediate circle of family and friends.  A
'tribe', if you will...

Agreed, but it is a tribe none the less. Western society has not ignored 
the need to feel part of a larger group in the least. Ask the thousands 
and possibly millions that have been persecuted throughout the ages 
because their refusal to become part of the Judeo-Christaic tribe....

        I can relate.  This often happens to me if i put a lot of energy
into things and don't get much back...at least not immediately.  Doesn't
matter what it is, relationships, work, school (thankfully i'm finished
with that though =) ) but especially when i go out.  I remember feeling
very similar to how you've discribed your state after for about a week last
sept.  All i wanted to do was sleep.  I really do believe that there is a
lot more going on in the world than is perceptible and i think that the
flow of 'energy' is a big part of it.  If it's a synergistic thing you can
end up elated, if you give until it hurts you can be drained.  The good
part of this story is that last sept, after this big blowout party i went
for a week feeling like crap, then had _a lot_ of people approach me at
other parties or at clubs and say "hey i remeber i met you at pure, you
helped me out with this" or "you did this and it was so nice" or other
things like that so it all comes back to you...:)

I've come to a similar realization, Daniel. It seems that at first when you 
relax and are open to it, one feels the  vibe/energy/love. Then, as we 
become more familiar with it, we can *become* the energy/love/vibe. Once 
we've learned to integrate this energy into our being, we can then 
learn to project it onto others.

Though this energy is incredibly beautiful and strong, it takes a while 
to fully understand it, then integrate it to a point where you can give 
to others and not be so drained. I'm still working with it myself. 


> Can anyone relate?

Not a debt, Daniel. Just unfamiliarity. I recall giving  so much one 
night that I almost passed out! I still get drained, but I'm getting 
better at controlling this energy so I don't get so worn out. Always nice 
to save a little for the afterparty.  |)

> I guess sometimes we give energy heavily(like I felt) and sometimes we 
> recieve heavily(like when a party keeps you feeling good for days).

And then, sometimes both! That's the key I think, getting to a point 
where we can all *share* this energy unconditionally, without becoming 
emotionally drained.

I've found it difficult share this energy for a few reasons:

	-	My personal energy level is low. Sunset was very nice. 
		Wonderful people, wonderful energy, beautiful views, but 
		I felt really emotionally worn (I checked my biorythyms, and 
		I'm at -8. Yikes!), So I couldn't give like I wanted to. 
		I just sat and soaked up the energy around me. Yum!

	-	There are those who are greedy/needy for this energy. Some 
		don't fully understand what is happening at these events, 
		and when the feel/experience this energy, the want to cling 
		to it because they don't know how to create it themselves.
		Sometimes, these people DEMAND it (a friend calls them 
		rapists). At first I got really uncomfortable when these 
		people were around, but I now feel I can smother them in so 
		much energy, that their presence no longer upsets me.

 
	-	Then there are times when I feel It just won't do any 
		good. I feel that others have to be receptive to this energy 
		in order for you to be able to project it and affect 
		them. For me, this happened at a basement Wicked at DV8. 
		I was all ready to give, but it just didn't FEEL right with 
		the crowd (fancy that).

Sometimes, I think I'm crazy for believing this projection of energy 
actually happens. But as we all know, there are things outside our conditioned 
certainty which can very easily be real.

This projection of energy/vibe-I believe this is what Geoff is talking about 
when he posts the challenge of taking responsibility for creating the energy 
at a party that has no vibe.

Then again, I could be thinking too much. I tend to do that.  ;)

Thanks to all who came down to Brothers and Sisters last week.

This week's line-up is:  Tracy
                                       Spun
                                       Jan Cooley
As usual anyone from SF Raves gets in free on our guest list.
Just tell the girl at the door that you are from SF Raves and it will be all good.
Thanks for all the support, hope to see you all this Friday at 1015.
And to all of those that are worried about the vibe for one reason or another.
The club always gets better when the bar closes because shortly after that the 
gold room closes, since that seems to be the one that apalls certain 
individuals.  

I think that we all need to drop out pre-conceived notions that because 
someone is wearing a suit or dressed nice means that there is something 
wrong with them.  I have been the resident dj for Brothers and Sisters, 
formally Soundsystem for six months now.  I must admit, at first I thought 
they were dorks but after meeting a few of them I discovered that alot of them 
are cool people that have never experienced a good groove.  There are several
so called "suits" that come to Brothers and Sisters regularly that are really 
good people just trying to unwind with their friends.  I think that it is about 
time that we drop the negitive stereotypes and start communicating.  That way 
rather than judging people based on what they look like, take the time to find 
out what they are about, you may be surprised, there are a lot of subversive 
individuals out there you just have to get past fear and introduce yourself.
If we want our scene to grow and maintain diversisty we need to start being 
less closed-minded and judgemental of people that we have never met.  There 
are good people and bad people.  Anyway, what were you like before you 
discovered the House Movement?  Sometimes we all seem to forget our past.

Just a few kind words.

dj Tracy, Brothers and Sisters

and what they wear, their color or whatever really is unimportant

hello everyone.
would some one please write a review of BIG TOP because i did not/could
not/would not get out of my miserable hovel and go. the real reason is
because i'm studying for boards and i need to sleep in order to function
the next day. anyway, my existance, at present, sucks, but i'm sure the
life-quality quotient of anyone that went last night has escalated into
the cosmos. or am i horribly mistaken? whatever the case, how was jeno's
set? just how much cotton candy can a single human consume? does cotton
candy remedy cramps induced by dancing/sweating? is there any adverse
reaction between amphetamine and any of the 6 billion compounds that
compose cotton candy? just how was that wooden dance floor, and did you
ever stop to think how many cute, elderly couples had done the waltz
across it in the past? so many questions.
thanks.

i feel the only successful elements of big top were the attendance of the
wonderful people i call my friends...this party didn't do much to inspire
my respect of dc parties.
 
though a minor element...i think the first thing that really bothered me
about big top was the $3 price tag for little bottles of water...granted,
security didn't seem to be denying people the privilege of bringing their
own water..but, i didn't bring a bottle of water to be potentially not
allowed to bring.  i mananged to survive getting drinks from my
friends..but i eventually broke down and shelled out three the $3.
 
the overall feel of the party was club with a capital 'club.'   there
were some musical highlights of the evening...i heard some great acid and
some really nice house...but in all the sets but one ( there was one dj's
set that i liked in it's entirety ( i think he spun two people after
scott henry )), every time i started to ride a groove, the dj would
interupt it with a really cheesy, clubby house tune...i think the musical
low of the evening was 'i am ready' being spun three times i think... the
crowd didn't seemed to like this quite a bit, which is my point...it was
definitely club music, and a club crowd
 
i spent a lot of time sitting talking to people...which was really
wonderful, because, as i mentioned before, there were a lot of wonderful
people there...i seemed to get a consensus that i wasn't the only person
that desired more than i was being delivered in the music...there just
weren't that many songs that really made us want to dance...  the people
that i had an opportunity to spend an evening with are the only reason
i'm not completely pissed off for spending $15 on an evening underneath a
tent erected in a parking lot behind tracks.
 
based on this party..i don't think i'll be in attendance at any other
buzz crew productions

Well, it was, pardon the pun, Wicked!  Okay.  Here's the chronology..  I
am sitting around doing my thing when MikeD gives me a page and wants to
hook up for the party, he's down from Connecticut for the Lacrosse games
at UMD.  Anyhow, he pops on by and we jet on down to commercial club
central (The Edge, Tracks, etc..).  Parking is hell, but that was expected.

It's about 11 when we show up and there is a huge line at the Edge across
the street, a long line at Big Top and very few people inside the fenced
off area.  The space is the back parking lot of Tracks, fenced off from
the rest of the world and huge tent (without walls) is set up.  Under the
tent is a portable wooden dance floor set up over the asphalt, all the
sound equipment and DJ stuff is set up at the back corner, up against the
Tracks back wall.  There are concessions on either side of the dance
floor and some sitting pyramids set up for, well, sitting.  :)

The fun started in the line as a man with the biggest platforms I have
ever seen (either that or stilts) walks up and down the line making
balloon hats for everyone.  That just set the tone for the party for me.
Anyhow we get up to the front of the line and are joined by Jenn and
Mike/Inhuman.  They check ID's and send us back into the pat down area
(which consisted of a tap on the pockets and being sent to the ticket
lady, very nice).  First people I see are Scott Henry and Duncan
(Charlottesville) and they are just all up and on life, great vibe
spreading out around them.  I start walking around and seeing and talking
to people.  That was great to experience because everyone seemed so really
into the vibe.

First things first and I go pay homage to the
little-beat-god-who-lives-in-big-black-boxes-and-has-long-tail.  Dance
floor is smooth and easy to dance on, really nice setup.  Lieven is
spinning and he has this hardish trance set going on and I just start
going in and warming myself up.  Okay, achieve the muscle relaxing, body
high feeling and go to let my clothes dry out (I do sweat a bit, don't I).
And that is pretty much how the rest of the night went for me.  I would
dance hard for a half hour, then dance softly and talk and drink and
(occasionally, very occasionally) sit and rest.  It was alot of fun.
People I didn't know would walk up at random and just strike up
conversations, people I knew did the same.  There was this happy feely
vibe all over the place.  Alot of diversity in the crowd with all sorts of
subcultures (punks, club kids, bondage kids, queers, rastafarians, SF folk
and a whole lotta DC scenesters).

The music was incredible of course.  Lieven livened the space, but the
crowd didn't even arrive until after his set.  Scott Henry fucking THREW
ME INTO THE SKY!  Incredible set, just incredible, I cramped but I
couldn't stop dancing to it!  Then came Marky Mark (really nice guy, if
not quite as net-connected as I thought) with well, I can't describe it
but to say "Wow..".  Garth and then Jeno (I finally completed my quest to
make him smile) were (again the pun) WIKKED!  *sigh*  I just wish I had
more adjectives and adverbs to devote to them.  But I think you get my
meaning.

Okay, with all good things, there are of course drawbacks.  First, water.
OUTRAGEOUS!  Okay, $3 for the TINY bottles of water, $1.50 sodas, $.75 for
blowpops.  They were also serving alcohol (but no one seemed to be
drinking, thank goodness).  Now I know why that cotton candy was free, so
you would get thirsty from it and buy water.  And then no spout to refill
the water bottles (made me think of how Rise was giving out water the
entire night before).  That was a jyp.  Second, the sound system wasn't as
clear and crisp as I associate with Scott.  Not that it wasn't good, just
that it got muddy at the low bass ranges.  It didn't make much of a
difference most of the time, but on certain tracks I just went
"Whadefuq?".

Drug use actually seemed really cool.  There were alot of people E'ing and
smiling and touching and grooving.  Thankfully the bar didn't get much
business and actually looked to have closed at some point.  But then
again, most of the people who drank left early.  I saw almost no powder
drugs and crystal kids running around.  I did see one person snorting that
poison.  He didn't dance, he couldn't talk, he couldn't make simple
decisions, he was fucked to the point of stupidity.  But I guess that's
what is associated.  When I talked to him it was like there was a rip in
the vibe at the party that just split and went around him, it was almost
tangible.  Very sad.  But there was just that one appearance of the 'raves
as drug purchase point' crew as far as I saw.

Anyhow, the party was very well attended by Net folks..  I was glad to
see:  Omar (nice to finally meet you), Paul (raver in the White House,
raver in the White House), Wendy Converse (so that's who you are!), Shawn
Willis, Karin, Mark Pflaging, MikeD, Jenn Ladd, Mike/Inhuman, Derrick
(send the tshirt to Marky Mark! :) ), Derrick (congrats on taking over the
SE Raves web site), Peekay (better luck next time), Ron, the woman with
Ron that I just can't recall the name of, Karin v2, Jenka, Sean/Kodak (and
little Bro), Baggadonuts, Dana and the multitude of people my poor memory
isn't grasping just now.  And of course Scott Henry and Marky Mark, nice
to have you folks on the net.

the music sucked.  but it's cool talking to people who were like "the music is
SO good!"  it got better towards the end (the last song was BOMB!) when the dj
started to drop a breakbeat and really good house.  by then i could hardly stand
i was so tired.  on the whole the party was phat.  i had a great time, everyone
i talked to was like "it's much better than i thought it would be."
 
it seems to me the frisco sound is as wack as baltimore.  oh well, it's
danceable, sort of.  4-5 times throughout the night i would hear a phat beat and
would think "finally i'm going to lose it" then just i went to groove the beat
drop out or change.  maybe it was coincidence, but it pissed me off.
 
a DC party at tracks (more or less) that was serving alcohol and charging 3
bones for h2o and was still phat... is a might phat party!

      However since I do enjoy elaborating; I'd like to start off my shpiel by
   saying as a promotor, I have many dreams and aspirations for the New York
   scene and urban dance culture. All that I ever hoped for, every ambition I
   ever laid forth, was realized on Sunday May 28th by Primary productions.

I wish I had more energy last night -- I was skating at the Skaters
Reunion in Central Park earlier so i was a bit drained, but WOW! I
think the magic was the nexus of past positive vibes of 15 years or
more of dance skaters who made the Roxy their home and the past
positive vibes of Primary productions. Since I did not have my regular
dance energy, I soaked in the scene a little more than usual and
seeing the floor in action was amazing.

      Forget the fact that it was held at a night club. Forget the number of
   people under that roof. This party was at times unrivaled. It was
   Indescribable. Time after time last year I went to Sound Factory and said to
   myself 'this is what rave should be'. Thanks to Primary I was able to see
   that. Finally the rave scene had its Sound Factory.

Not being very mystical I must say however there must be someting to
persistance of past vibes and the catching of ones offered by other
folks. There were many elements present that could of made this a bad
rave, but it seems that people for the most part TRANSCENDED these
elements to achieve the common vibe present -- rallied on by the
music. Why folks trascended last night is an interesting question.

i didn't enjoy purple as much as i expected too. but it was just way too
crowded at the roxy. seems like they were selling tickets even though
more than 2000 people were packed in there.

even when i left at 7am, there were people sprawled all over the place,
on the dancefloor, behidn the bars, in the jungle room, by the
coatcheck. it was just too crowded to dance continuously for more than
5minutes without being bumped into.

but the jungle room was the place to be if you go tired of the wicked
crew. btw, does anyone know who was spinning when on the main floor?
they played i am ready at least twice.  overload and odi just turned the
jungle room upside down with mc panik on the mic.

To: Multiple recipients of list NE-RAVES <NE-RAVES@UMDD.UMD.EDU>

To start, I just want to thank all the NE-Ravers that I met and absolutely
enjoyed the company of all afternoon and night. More than I've ever felt
before, last night made it clear to me that we are truly a tribe. You guys
have PLUR oozing out of your pores, and I *love* being part of this. ***Out of
Control!***

I didn't think that many people would show up at Tompkins Sq Park in the
afternoon, because of all the confusion over where/whether/when it would
happen. But a good 25-30 people showed up- NE-Ravers, vRavers, and others.
Lotsa socializin' and watching this yoga guy do all sorts of contortions and
balance tricks. With the inclement weather (like that word?), we split up to
various people's apartments- some to Cyberslut's (Hi honey!), and a bunch of
others to Jon Speakman's. That was a trip: a friend of jon's came over and
spun for a while. So there were 13 men in his apartment DANCING!!! When the
hell does that ever happen?

PURPLE was terrific. The dancefloor was huge, and **all night** it was
completely covered with people dancing. Lotsa other stuff going on, I guess,
but that doesn't matter, 'cuz there was so much dancing. I didn't find the
music in the beginning too exciting, very inconsistent. But from about 1am
'til the end, intense House music blasted all nite long from the kick-ass
likes of Tiga, Garth, and Gano. Acid house, deep house, tribal house, all
sorts of house, but that was the order of the day. And the NE-Raves corner was
absolutely the epicenter of the vibe. Smiles to: John, a couple of Matts, Mike
Gee, Taj, Dylan, Terrence, Zoinks, Cyberslut, Amber, Heather, Andrew, June,
Junglist DBF, and Nicole(you'll kick me another time if I didn't mention
everyone). By the way, folks, I think we'll have a good handful of new
additions to the list pretty soon.

Bless you all for a terrific vibe. How was the afterhours, by the way?

Peace, and much PLUR,

Damn....my ears are still ringing and my brain is a little bit frazzled
from all the excitement of the last 24 hours...
but never before in my short career of raving life have I had more fun
than I did last night at Purple,yesterday afternoon at the picnic and
hanging out with all the Net-Ravers that descended on NYC for the day.  I
won't embarass myself and try to remember all the names of the people I
met- but you are all wonderful.  Nobody kicks it like Ne-ravers: hands
down :)
But on to Purple...I got there at 10:30 and managed to get inside
instantly (I hate sneaking in lines, but my friend Liz knew someone right
up in front.) And getting in early made a world of difference...I got to
see the Roxy all clean and empty, a huge dancefloor to run around on and
get siked up for. And I didn't sit there and stew on the line...it
totally killed Voyager II for me and I wasn't going to let this party be
a dissapointment.
But there was no possible way this would be dissapointing- not with the
amazing music being artfully mixed and played all night long. Tiga was
tearing it up when I got in with some really wicked acid.  I didn't
really like Joeski's slowy house, but the vibe was just beginning to pick
up inside. And then at 1 am....Garth came on. I will never forget the
first record he played- that beautiful kick-snare-hgih hat drum track
that seems to go with every record the Wicked crew played, with a
ridiculous bongo/percussion solo on top of it. Garth slowed it down for
about a half hour, bookending the slow parts with 'I am Ready'. When he
played the second part of I am ready, the one where it builds and builds
and builds, I thought the roof was going to come off...amazing energy and
feeling.
Garth gave way to Jeno around 2:30, who was definitely the highlight of
the Wicked crew for me. He was much more trancey and electro-funk, and
from 2:30 to 4 shit was just blowing up continuously. I was having the
best time...runniung around dancing with the ne-ravers, my friends from
school, and even a bunch of old high school friends who were there. ANd
not a dissapointed face in the entire Roxy..
sure it was crowded, but I couldn't focus on that at all. It was crowded
but everyone was dancing, none of that fucked-up wandering around that
goes on.
Markie Mark spun from about 4 until 6ish...and he just pushed everyone
onto another level.  I couldn't believe how amazing the music was...and
so much of it depended on the DJ.  June is right- it's all in the mixing.
The way these DJs manipulated the crowd, slowly brought them up and up
and up the whole night, you just don't see that with East Coast DJs.
Perhaps we need longer sets in the east...so the DJs have more time to
work a vibe, instead of just throwing on their best records in a hurry.
But the Wicked crew are just true craftsmen...incredible mixing. And I
love those records...so much more natural than the sometimes mechanical
trance and acid that everyone loves in the east. These records had great
percussion, shjimmering hgih hats and snares, floating ethereal
keyboards, crazy vocal samples and chanting...
Thomas finished the night with great morning music...even more
progressive, but a little more contemplative maybe. EVeryone was
realizing what a great night they had had.  Finally, at 7:30 the lights
came on, and everyone cheered. It was a totally great night.

Props to Primary- they really delivered on the promise of the flyer for a
'vibe-oriented' party. This was really pretty no-frills: here are 6 fat
DJs, here is the dance floor, let's all get busy and have a great time.
Scotto's lights were great...really in synch with the vibe of the DJs.
I'm sorry that we don't hear music like this more on the East coast...for
all those who thought that Purple would be 'too mellow' or put them to
sleep: I'm sorry that you missed out.  It's SO MUCH MORE than just the
tempo or the style of the music...these DJs know what the spirit of
raving is all about.  I can't wait to goto San Francisco for the
summer...not only for the Wicked crew, but for all the other wonderful
DJs who have yet to get recognized over here. I'm sure their music is
just as soulful as Wicked.

I hope the afterparty was great. I would have loved to hear DJ Spun, but
Alan told me it was on Ludlow street. and I was facing a subway ride back
to the bronx....I feel like I could still be vibing and grooving right now.

We first decided to go to big red.. We were just more into the lineup..
Yep, I love house, I spin house, but when I go to a party I wanna lose it
to TECHNO.  But none to be heard..  As TWR man said, fire marshall bob
payed us a visit, said wassup, shut the shit down..  I'm really glad I
didn't fork over the 18 bux for presales, and I think I'm going to start
showing up at parties later and later in fear of paying the cover and two
hours later the party gets busted..I see the trend of presale tickets
going away if shit keeps up like this.  Fortunately, we didn't pay jack..
We got in the car and reluctantly headed over to the Roxy...

    Purple.  We got online at about midnight and waited nearly 1.5
hours in the rain to get in...  We got in, payed some cash, and I went
into a club.. Whoever said that rave finally got its soundfactory is
right.. To me, this felt like just another night at the roxy with a
different crowd.  BUT, I still had fun.  I was hearing mostly hard house
(green velvet's new one sounded solid on that system), but then heard
some progressive slow breaks start to seep in my head, so we decided to
chill in the jungle room.. It was waaay to crowded to dance in the
"lounge", so people just stood around and kinda watched.. some danced.
Overload finished his set and next it was Odi's turn.. What can I say?
He blew shit up in there.. never before have I seen such skilful
manipulation of jungle records.. He cut, scratched, transformed, phased,
you name it..it was just a trip to watch him..and when he got on the
mic..heh let's just say he's the frankie bones of jungle..  Ok, so I got
bored again..  Off to the main room once again (it's now like 5:30 or
something).
    So we're in there at 5.30ish, there's some pretty non-melodic
vocal stuff being played..I'm not too into it.. All of a sudden, (whoever
was spinning) someone dropped the 24 hr experience track, and I got extremely
happy.. FINALLY, some deep melodic house for these ravers to hear.. hehe san
fran djs bring NY house to, well, NY.. kinda funny.

>From 5:30 until about 7:30 the djs kicked my fucking ass all over (to
coin a jerky boys phrase).. WHO was spinning then?  I'm pretty sure at
around 7ish it was joeski.. his slow dark tribal stuff always moves me..
So, after the deep house (loved that barry white track..it WAS barry
white right?) I heard some electro-funky-acidhouse.. this just sent me in
a tizzy.. to anyone who might have seen me, I was the skinny white kid in
the freeze shirt towards the back finally letting lose at 6:45am..  Does
anyone realize that a Jodeci song was played?  I was just so happy, but I
was not at a r*ve, I was at a club having a good time.  Really, I'm from
NY, I've been to NY house clubs before and this just felt the same way..

So it was a tad overcrowded, but the main floor was so huge I always
found a spot to dance.. i mostly hung around the back area.. The vibe was
nice and positive.. no crack babies..while I was on line some dick asked
me if I needed any e or krystal..

I'm glad I made it to the picnic beforehand as well.. like one of my ol'
skool bbs user meets, but you guys were cooler.. Peace 2 phated, zoinks,
stefan, jill(unrest), wendyk, grant (thanks for the water), nicole, deknow,
taj(phatvibes), dori(cyberslut), matt, matt, that guy at the park twisting his
body up, alan s, terence, liquid todd, benny, ana, kj, tallpaul, osheen,
mikegee, john speakman for so kindly letting many of us hang at your pad,
musicboy for the music, the whole boston crew (those whom I haven't
mentioned), and to so many others I'm sure I've forgotten.

Taj, thanks for playin yer boombox w/ that cool english acid leaking into
the ears of the peons walking down the streen in the village.  That was
probably the best feeling I got all day.  This mass tribe just headin
down to Speakmans with strangers staring at us like we were crazy, and
what the fuck was coming out of Taj's radio.

I was really lookig forward to big red, but Purple (for me) was a good
second choice and I'm glad I went and finally let off some STEAM!!

Thanks, Primary.. you delivered that trademark primary vibe once again,
and it was a solid party.

-Dylan.

I *don't* touch the record surface with my fingers after I buy mine,
except right at the outer edge maybe, and in the run-out area in the
center to push or drag.  Actually, I probably push on the label more
than anything.  Records collect a lot of dust and crud anyway, so
why make it worse, right?  But actually, it's as much an esthetic thing
as anything.  Fingerprints on vinyl just look bad.  

The exception comes with scratching.  Good scratch DJs are all over their
vinyl, and they tell me they can do hundreds of plays off the same discs
without too much noticeable degradation.  OK, that makes sense.  

So, it may not be all that crucial, but I just prefer to keep the recording
surfaces clean and clear of fingerprints.

such an incredibly lovely bunch we are

i was especially amused by the girl who thought my friends and i were
undercover cops (seriously)! obviously, the village people have been losst 
in the history books 

donald glaube and solar just laid down an incredible vibe that flowed into
the evening - my friends kept coming by and saying , gee, this is like
"music to open the heart chakra to" 

the setting was simply beautiful, the crowd diverse, the smiles and hugs
easy and genuine . . . .    sigh . . . :)

Hello, folks.  I am writing to all of you today about an interesting project
that will come to almost every major city in America this summer.

Lollapalooza will be featuring a special rave festival that will take place
after the actual event.

This event will usually be off-site in a more suitable location and last all
night (well, at least past 4).

My questions to you are as follows:

1. If you are interested in helping out please continue reading.

2. We would love to hear suggestions about:
      - What would be the best talent line up? (pick your top three)
      - Where would be the best location in your city? (It has to be legal
and close to the Lolla site; the Lolla sites will be posted tomorrow)
      - Who are the most dependable promoters in your cities to help out with
the local promotion and/or production?

3.  Please e-mail any of your thoughts to: KingFishPB@aol.com


Thanks and Peace to all.

hey everyone,

  last week in my speech class i tried to describe to the other students
how dancing made me feel, and how it can release make me feel like im
at a "higher state of consciousness" =)  but on most of the reviews of 
the speech, students thought i was talking about dancing being a good
stress releaver.  

  oh well... :P

  on saturday night i once again accended to that "higher state of
consciousness". thanks to dj dan and tony and mark farina
  the party got off to a slow start.  we got there around 12 and had
to wait in line for about an hour.  They were taking away people's
candy at the door so i gave away my blow pops in the line but kept
a few in a bag which i was able to sneak into the arena.
  When we got inside we missed dj marcus, the jungle dj.  from what
i heard not a lot of people danced anyways to it.  that sucks.
  barry weaver was on next.  his music was brain dead and boring.
this simple four/four hard beats with a tinge of acid and electro
thrown in every once in awhile.  it didnt really go anywhere.
  but then dj dan came on. 
  he immediately built up the vibe.  i started dancing from his first
song, and then i kept going on and on and on.  i couldnt stop.  the
vibe was SOOOOO THICK!!!  people bugging out grooving and moving and
dancing and absorbing it.  
  when dan finished up,  tony came on.  i was skeptical that he could
keep the groove going on. but he kicked it on!!  i just spent most
of tony's set bugging out in front of the bass bins groovin and bobbin'
and feeling the bass move my body.  it was intense.  
  finally after dancing for about three hours, i took a break cause
i needed it :) but caught the last half hour of mark farina's set which
was nice to hear house after the techno trancy acid stuff all night. 

  so it was a nice night :)  and i got lost in the dancing and the friendly
vibe of the party.  

  although the music and vibe and location was nice, there were 
some bad items also.
  the lights wern;t the most incredible, the sound was a bit 
distorted, there wasnt a chill out room and not able to bring in
water or bottles or candy.  

  but cause of the music ill over look it this time

sfravers in the house:  john, and dan from cal poly.  who else was there?

peace

Well here is the progress report boys and girls.  I just got back from an 
extremely enlightening trip.  I have some bad news.  July 4th is not a 
doable date for this event.  Due to large amounts of snowfall there is 
still 5-6' snow everywhere.  We couldn't even get into the site.  Since 
we could not guarantee a July 4 open road date it has been decided to 
move it back.  Ugghhh...I can hear the groans now.  DO NOT WORRY I WILL 
DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO SEE THAT THIS THING DOES GO OFF IN A BIG 
WAY.  I met somebody this weekend in LA (actually Bix met someone too 
but...ughhmmm....that is another story) who is really in touch with the 
socal scene.  She has really helped me out and I think we could get some 
money backing (he would donate it hopefully) and stuff.  I am also may 
have contact to several big name DJs in the San Diego and LA area.  This 
along with the hopeful help of some wonderful (Adder and Mike I really 
must thank you guys for missing Sunset just to check out an essentiall 
dead site and thanks Mike for letting us crash at your place) people from 
San Fran could make for a terrific show.  Plus I cannot leaver out  the 
helpful people from Davis who have show me support as well (hopefully we 
can include a bunch of people from your scene too).  I would like to 
includ Santa Barb. (espec. Justice if at all possible) but this will take 
a lot of work.  Anyway we are still working on some new dates we have 2 
main ideas...last weekend of July or the weekend of Sept 23 (Autumn 
Solstice...cool possibilities).   Which do you guys like better?   Is 
there a conflict with another MAJOR rave that you know about?  If so 
please tell me and it will effect my decision.  Well I haven't had but 
about 5 hours sleep since Sat. morning so I will start to rap it up.  
Hmmm, I would like to say thanks to all the people who helped out the 
"Glade-runners" (AirGregor thanks for both of the things you provided one 
was extremely essential (talk to me later about the trick I worked on it) 
and the other (a camping stove) was unfortunately useless.  Thanks to bix 
for keeping this tired boy awake.  Thanks Chuen for letting us semi-crash 
at your place b4 reactor...and of course BlackAdder and Mike Clay to kind 
souls who need no praise for actions speak louder then words).  Well I 
gotta really be going now because I am seemingly levitating out of my 
seat and flying through the air....btw no I am not really on much of 
anything.  The cool thing about hallucinations due to lack of sleep is 
supposedly much more intense and different then any other bcause it is 
natural and more powerful.  happy journeys to all....talk to y'all later 
when I am "myself" (whatever that is..hehehehehehe) again!

One last thing, the name has been changed to MILE HIGH.  Howdya guys like it?

They don't really need it that much but Rob and Barry at Primal have been
hooking me up for the last 2 years or so. I was on record buying hiatus for
the past five months. Rob still pulled records for me, let me get on
the front decks, and treated me just like name brand DJs. They play stuff
over the phone for out of town DJs. I can't say for sure they don't pull
shit out of peoples bags but I can't imagine Rob and Barry doing
that. You can get the cheesiest diva house, the burliest acid tracks and
just about everything in between.

They don't keep a huge backstock, so don't show up expecting them to have
every cut you ever wanted plus some new phat tracks thrown in. But if you
put in a few appearances and get to know them I'm sure you'll get the same
service.

A satisfied customer.

I took that shit one time. I took two to be exact. It felt like
"Mini-thins", kinda speedy for a while.  The feeling was never that great,
then I had to go pee and......brace yourself......I pee'd then as I was
pushing the last drops out I ejaculated.......no feeling, no woody just a
bunch of white stuff in the toilet.....I wouldn't recommend it to
anyone.....and I certainly won't be trying it again.

  If you're looking to get out to a reasonably priced event on Friday
consider Beautiful People. I'm doing visuals ( possibly along with another
late addition ) and I want to have fun so I hope lots of high spirited
people come out - as I said " It's really the people who come to a party
that make it happen - NOT the performers " 

The DJ lineup looks good with James(SJ), Graeme, DRC, Trent, Deaks and 
James(SC). The place is near Santa Cruz and is wonderful!( So all you 
South Bay people especially come on out! )  There's a picture window into 
the lighted pool in the chill room and I talked with Greg and he mentioned 
he may open the 3 rd room with the "river running through it" presumably 
if enough people show to warrant it.

  All ages, all night, as bust free as possible, $5-10, starts early 9:30.
No alcohol. (408)450-3044  (408) 486-9591 for directions.


PS Closer to home I noticed Velocette & Alex will be at Dust that night.

Mike

PPS All you sfravers who come out: come up and say "Hi".... if curious I'll
show you my toys... Hell if you're really curious I'll let you play with
them :)

Subject:Jamiroquai at Bimbo's

If you didnt go to Jamiroquai at Bimbo's last night, have someone kick you
really hard in the butt.   This was with out a doubt, the best show I've been
to, ever! These guys were great.  We showed up right before they started, I
think it was around 9:30 or so and managed to make our way up to the front. 
They started off with Revolution from their first album.  They had 11 guys on
stage; singer, bass, guitar, keys, 3 guys playing horns, drums, percussion, a
DJ, and a guy playing a digereedoo (SP?) on a few songs.  We were standing
right under this guy!   The highlight of the show, well, the whole show was a
highlight, but one part that really sticks out in my mind was after they took
a short break, they came back on and did this very trancey digereedoo (jeez,
how do you spell that anyway?!) jam.  The DJ was doing these strange scratchs
that were running through a delay that made it sound really ghostly.  The
band as a whole were very tight and man could they groove.  They played for
about 2 hours which was way too short.  Everyone was waiting for more.  

This was also my first visit to Bimbo's.  Its a very 'Posh' club.  Chandelier
on the ceiling, plush red carpet, statues everywhere.  Didnt get to see the
girl in the fish tank though.

Hello,

Mr. Bill here, I'm an east coast DJ... I'm planning a vacation in San 
Fran from July 3-10. I'd be very interested in picking up a spot at a 
weekly or event during this week if anyone is planning something...

Sorry to post this to everyone, but most of my "connections" are here on 
the east coast, and I figured as long as I'm over there, I might as well 
line-up a few gigs. Please e-mail me personally, and I'll be more than 
happy to hook you up with a tape and such.

PLUR,

-----mr. bill   :)


P.S. I'm also coming out there around August 12,13 sometime

WOW!!!!!
A dream of mine became a reality on Sunday night at the Roxy
here in New York City.  San Francisco came to New York.
All of my new friends here, all these months looking at
me with a cynical eye for the last six months since I moved here...
what's this psychedelic freaker princess from san francisco TALKING about.

Well they found out.  People dancing harder than they ever
had before, the joy of watching...it was indescribable...
these friends of mine...all net-ravers and vravers...
cradle their heads in their hands saying...
OH MY GOD I HAVE *NEVER* HEARD THIS KIND OF MUSIC IN MY LIFE!!!!

I am sure I was the only raver from San Francisco in attendance
and it was UNBELIEVABLE....I mean so incredibly WONDERFUL to
have for *one night* my two worlds--New York and San Francisco
fuse into one beautiful magical union.  Garth, Jeno, Markie
and Thomas tore open a porthole into another dimension that
New York City had NEVER seen until Sunday night.

For my own reasons I am so incredibly thankful that Mello asked
Wicked to come to NYC.....finally for some UNDERSTANDING.  
It may be selfish, but in one night about fifty people instantly
and finally understood who I am and where I come from....
and I was never in my whole life so happy to lead my friends
right into what I knew they always wanted and never knew it
until the last.  

Another miracle that has been created, or is beginning to be
created, is a new vision for the scene in New York City. 
I don't know if Garth when he was dancing in the crowd during
Markie's set was aware of the miracle that was happening all
around him...that he was witnessing, taking part in, and who
knows maybe even partly responsible for the vibiest party
that has ever happened in this city.  All he said to me
was "Yeah..I always wanted to play in New York".  I had to
laugh.  I felt like the singular witness....and I could
barely grok all that was happening....the music I have
missed for so long taking me back to that *place*...plus
watching all my friends completely lose their heads.

IT'S MIND CONTROL!!!  IT'S MIND CONTROL!!!!
Those were the words most often coming out of everyone's
mouths when Markie went on and managed to rip apart the
fabric of reality and take these people to levels they
had never even considered could exist.

I could go on for days to try to navigate and describe the
journey that the Wicked boys took us on...but I see that
someone has already posted to sfraves some reviews from
my fellow ne-ravers...a good cross-section.  Though it's
only Tuesday and people are still recovering...I think
people are STILL trying to make sense of what happened to
them that night.

It was beautiful.  It was a dream come true for me.  It
was a DAMN good excuse to hang out for two weeks after
finals before coming home for the summer (though I heard
Sunset went OFF - yay!).  But most of all, I think it was
the greatest gift that could have been given to the New
York scene, to really see that the vibe exists within
and its there...it can happen and it did!!!  I think it
has refueled so much energy and vibe and excitement of
possibilities back into the New York scene.  And I feel
very priveleged to have been a witness to it.

I know this post is very long....I'm coming back to San
Francisco on Thursday for the whole summer....Sunset
here I come and I get my fix every sunday all summer
long!!! (P.S. June 18th is Galen's b-day and after
that sunsets will be weekly again!!)   
I'm so excited and happy I don't know what
to do with myself.  Except prepare for a TON of east
coast people about to pour into my house to check out
the San Francisco vibe that has infected them to the core
through my pictures (of sunsets all last summer) and finally
with this party, Wicked at the Roxy.

See you all soon,

HOUSE NATION UNITE!!!!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!   WOW    MIRACLES!!!!!

Ooops!
Today is Wednesday! Funny how the days don't mean much when you are 
unemployed.
Anyways I was being sarcastic about not being in the park after 10pm.
I won't be able to make it but I hope everybody who goes has fun.

I have to agree with michael.  *everyone* should go check out beautiful 
people.  their last rave was basically the best party around in a long 
time.  everyone whose been to a harmony party knows that they really 
bring the vibe to an all time high.  the energy at their parties is just 
incredible.  not only that, but it's a fresh line up and the price is 
low.  how can you lose??
hope to see you all there!!!

sfravers are the best.  I just want all of you to know that the 20+
responses to my distress signal have me flying high as a kite.  Things
started to change with my first message (Thanks again and again Lee).  This
just goes to show that the positive energy of the rave scene and any energy
for that matter can be transmitted regardless of time or space.  I can't see
any of you, and I don't know where any of you are, but I can feel your love.
I think it also goes to show that it's sometimes a good thing to ask for
help.  You don't always have to be alone.  Tons-o-people are out there to
give you a helping hand.  I love all you wonderful boys and grrls, men and
womyn.  Thanks soooo much for all your support.  I'm going to go home now
and write some music. PLUR.

	You've actually made a very important point and thanks for 
bringing to my attention. Mercory based thermometers as far as ravers on 
E are concerned are definately contraindicated, meaning don't usem. If 
you break one in you mouth, not only to you have the heat related injury, 
but mercory posioning as well, its real deadly stuff. Use Semiconductor 
Digital based thermometer, much safer and more acturate, and easier to 
read,especially in low light conditions. Thanks Lee.
