Subject: [sfraves] WR: My Yummy Friday Night Adventure

Part 1

So like ok.. i don't like totally wanna get all emo & shit, but I think I
need to like back story to explain a few things before I give a proper
WR... ooh yeah... to the newbs & resubs to SFRaves, (WR = Weekend Review)
'cause like well.. things got kinda on the accronym tip a while back & I
just thought I'd add to it & it like kinda stuck..

Anywaze, so like yeah, Thursday was the funeral for my Uncle Bobbing who
passed away exactly a week before, the same day another Uncle passed away
in the Phillipines.  A week and a 1/2 before that, my other Uncle in the
hospital passed from ummm... dialisys (sp) complucations... then a week
before that, my Auntie who used to baby sit me after my car accident when
I was 4, died on a plane trip coming back from the Phillipines... I mean..
this whole time like I've been just hardcore mourning Dave, but like I
dunno, everything just got really heavy on the sad tip... so by the time
my Uncle Bobbing passed, it just kinda made like my heart really all the
more heavy & I dunno... it kinda made me like mentally regress back to
missing Dave more while like just being sad that my relatives passed... I
mean, my Uncles & Aunties were up there in age & lived good long
fulfilling lives & well, yeah, i dunno what I'm tryin' to say, it all just
kinda added up & got me in a mondo hardcore funk...  ooh yeah.. Mondo
Thanks to everyone who been helping me get through this :)

Part 2
I kinda wasn't feelin' like going out Friday night, but I already kinda
promised people i'd be Pulse, so i went.. I mean.. I also figure of all
the weeks of yucky that built up in my head, i just needed dance floor &
to be surrounded by my 2nd Family!  Like it was my 1st time back in
Paradise in yeeeeears... that venue got really cute! So yeah... all the
sets were Dope!!!  The residents totally like brought in the vibe w/ their
smooth like tech house kinda breaky electro funky yummy stuff, Alixr &
Dhamma, then like the big outta town DJ, ummm, I think her name is Dory,
she played alota minimal techno, tech house, & alota tribal techno, oh my
goodness, when Birthday Chica Forest got on the decks, man, she rocked the
floor so hard with her Electro House & her hard yummy ear candy stompy
dancefloor goodness... Mozzie played his Glitchy breaks & housey kinda
stuff, & Eric Sharp played his booty bass music... actually, 2 songs I
liked alot from his set were Hatorade & Short Dick Man.. I mean.. they wre
remixes, but it was fun to hear!

So the energy was reeeeally good, there was just a thickness of this yummy
vibe at the club & soooooooooo many people came outta the woodwork from
the old skool days!  There were like so many heads from the old skool that
I got to catch up with!!  My homie Crave from washington State was at the
club too & we hella got to chill!  I did dance alot, but I mean.. well..
so I sprained my ankle like a lil over a month ago @ the Junlge club & it
hasn't fully healed yet, so i couldn't dance too hard really, but man, I'm
kinda pissed @ myself for just not letting go... most of my night I was
just kinda out of it... it probably woulda been better if i just let go &
danced as hard as I could of, but something just held me back, it was
totally lame for me to be like that, but I dunno man.. but still all in
all, the night fuckin' rocked so damn hard & I did get from it what I
could get which was good enough to plaster some yummy memories in my head!
 I mean.. Hello 2day, even like chillin' in the balcony watchin' people
dance & vibin' to the music was good too!!!

All you SFR heads who I got to hang out with & stuff, like seriously..
Thank U for the hugz & all the comfort I needed lastnight!!!

Part 3
So I chilled w/ the crew & helped out a lil after the cluib closed 'cause
I needed time to kill b4 BART opened up.. after all that & alota goodbye
hugz n cuddlze, i had a few seconds to formulate a plan to kill time...
then I realized that I mean, well.. I had my ipod w/ yummy choonage
playing & alota long empty sidewalks, so I figured I could practice my
model walk down the runway to some Janet Jackson & figure out what to do..
walked by 1015 to see if there were anyone I knew was leaving the club or
outside smoking, no one, so I just practiced my model walk down folsum
street somemore!  I ended up at this gay porn store, probably bugging the
fuck outa the cashier with all my questions.. but he musta been freaked
out by some guy comin' in @ 4:30AM with a top hat on & a shiny ass blue
puffy vinyl jacket... yeah.. i also like did price checks on jock straps
'cause I dunno.. it looked like fun to wear from teh pictures on the box..
but didn't buy one 'cause I wan't sure about what size I'd be...

After the gay porn store, I went to 8 flavors Cafe thingie on 5th & almost
Market... while I was eating my crumb donut & drinking my choco milk, i
remembered that my Russian Bronx New Yorker Homie who does the sidewalk
water hose cleaning at Powell bart station was gonna be there... but
unfortunately, by the time I rushed & got there, he wasn't there no more,
but like it was still wet all around there, so he probs just left :(  So I
just waited w/ the few people there for BART to open... I kinda just
walked around kinda singing, hopefully I wasn't too loud...

OK, now this is the trippy part & what kinda lifted my spirits.. as soon
as the BART gates opened up, I started walkin' to the ticket machine.. I
felt this tap on my shoulder, turned around, & saw this lady talkin' to me
& I soooooooooo could not hear her 'cause my ipod was like drowning out
her voice... but yeah.. that lady ended up being my classmate Danielle
from acting school like back in the 90s & we ain't seen each other in
heeeeeeeella years.. so we spent like almost 20 minutes catching up...
like we hella gossiped about like old classmates & what we been up to the
past hella years... Hello 2day, i shouldn't of told her that he
ex-boyfriend used to hit on my when they were dating, but it just kinda
slipped out... but yeah, ooops! That was Dope to see her & well.. she
works for MUNI now too!!

So yeah... that was my Friday night adventure!  i still feel kinda shitty,
& I know it'll be a while for  my head to fully recover from the recent
yucky.. but I'll get there! :)  Thanks again to everyone I saw there from
the list!  I Love y'all lots!!!

Big Love Show with Jack - Mon 3PM-6PM Pacific/US
------------------------------------------------

This week Jack is hosting Martin O'Brien and Tony Hewitt.

Martin O'Brien is one of the most prominent figures of Bay Area
underground history. He's the organizer of the legendary "Gathering"
& "Basics" parties in which DJs like Tony, Jeno, Garth, Spun, and
Josh were the residents, and the prevailing sounds of the day were
acid & tribal house. Every old-schooler knows these parties and
every old-schooler knows how influential they were.

You can find out more about Martin O'Brien at:
http://hsomusic.com/sh/43

Tony Hewitt has been working with Mark "Blakkat" Bell to do live
music for the MoMusic events in the Bay Area.

A native of Manchester, England, Tony came to the U.S. in 1988.
While living in Southern California, he discovered L.A.s Underground
warehouse parties where hed hear DJs like Doc Martin, Steve Loria,
Barry Weaver and Michael Cook - who inspired him to start DJing.

In 1992, he moved to San Francisco where he began a residency at the
legendary Gathering parties, Funky Tekno Tribe and guest spots at
Come-Unity. To date, he has dj'd all over the U.S, Canada, Europe and
Indonesia, with guest spots at Fabric in London, the Bomb in
Nottingham, La Terraza in Spain and OTV Club in Croatia.

In the late 90s Tony, Onionz, Hipp-e & Halo, Joeski &  Master D
joined forces as the 6400 CREW and  went on to record for the best
house labels around, like 2020 Vision, NRK, Soma, Yoshitoshi,
Tango, Nightshfit, and Detour.

Also, DO NOT EVER ask him about Machester United - because TRUE
Mancs support Manchester City!

Eclektronik Groove w/ Holt Sorenson - Mon 9AM-12PM Pacific/US
--------------------------------------------------------------

Holt started off the day with an hour mix and now is hosting Ravi
Pina.

Ravi Pina has been involved with dance music in one form or another
for the last 10 plus years.  Starting in Cleveland with promoting
parties and then moving around the country to Boston, NYC, and
finally SF where he now calls home.  His tastes range from trip-hop
and downtempo to deep, funky, soulful, and disco house, but will
play anything as long as it gets you movin'.  After an extended
hiatus, he is slowly working his way back into the scene.

More about Ravi:
http://hsomusic.com/sh/41
http://hsomusic.com/sh/42

Upcoming Events for Holt:
03/08 - The Rhythm Room @ The EndUp
03/15 - The Greenhouse @ Deepmixfm (http://hsomusic.com/sh/1v)

Epiphany of Sound with J.C. - Th 9AM-12PM Pacific/US
----------------------------------------------------

After 14 years, DJ J.C.'s techno/house/electronica showcase has
garnered much attention and devotion. Like most folks at Stanford's
radio station, he's a volunteer, proving that his motivation isn't
a paycheck; it's his passion to share his interest in one of music's
most eclectic genres. With his conversational style, inclusion of
producers and musicians from both the local & international scene,
and his stewardship of the station's 24-hour marathons during
Solstices and Equinoxes, it's no wonder that DJ J.C has made a
connection with listeners in a very crowded market. Catch his live
broadcasts or listen to the previous week's program at underheard.org.

J.C. will email this week if he has an update on any guests.

Thanks for your support!!!

MARTIN LANDSKY

Unlike any other German protagonist of the electronic dance scene,
Martin Landsky withdrew himself from the well known category of
electronic dance music. The verbal approach is of course only a
portion of the complete and original sound of Landsky=91s music which
combines Techno, House, Minimal and Funk. He has been creating waves
as a sensational DJ and producer since the mid-90's and Landsky has
also been heard and recognized since 2000 as one of the key figures in
the circle of producers at Poker Flat Recordings. The label owner
Steve Bug is also a long term friend of Landsky.

"As a DJ and as musician I try to balance between both traditional
House and Techno music. Despite the fact that I use a lot of reduction
for that electronic sound, it is my duty to create deep music which
must also always include twisty and funky elements=93 says Martin. With
confidant mixing from retrostyle roots to up-to-date Club music, this
all but consequently represents Landsky like hardly any other musician
and DJ of the Poker Flat Style.

The special affinity to the roots of black club music fell in
Landsky=91s sight early on in his life. Through his hobby of
breakdancing as an eleven year old boy, Martin Landsky aquired an
impulsive contact to dance music, from funk to hiphop.  Starting
initially on a tapedeck and then later on his fathers Bontempi organ,
as well as a pitch control record player, it was clear to see from the
first single megamixes he produced that he had lost his heart
hopelessly to the music.

In the beginning DJing was always the most important thing for
Landsky=91s musical identity. He was just fourteen when he first started
to perform at school celebrations  and private parties. Of course the
ultimate moment of his musical carrier came around when he first
visited Hamburg=91s Kultclub Front in 1988. The mixture of Funk and the
growing trend of House, Acid and Techno electrified Landsky like
nothing else before and has affected his musical aesthetics up untill
the present day..  In 1994 his hard work and persistance payed off and
his dream came true when he was offered a regular residency at his
favourite club.

It soon became clear that Landsky would not last the duration as just
an exclusive and shining local heroic DJ and so then started to work
for the newly established distribution department of Container
Records. He then later worked for the distribution company Word and
Sound, and it was through both of these jobs that he gained valuable
contacts which helped him to travel much further afield as a DJ. At
the end of 1999 he made a last and final decision to leave Hamburg and
try his luck in Berlin as a full time DJ and Musician. With the help
of regular Bookings and his friends Cl=E9 and Steve Bug, he helped to
arrange a series of "Poker Flat Nights" at famous "Sternradio" and
regular headliner bookings in some of the most renowned clubs in
Berlin such as E-Werk, the Pfefferbank, Tresor and Casino. He also put
together many Mix CD=91s for labels such as Poker Flat, Systematic and
the Partysan complilation series which turned Landsky into one of the
most important figures in the German Club sound of the year 2000.

Parallel to this and as a result of his music productions, Landsky
gained the status as one of the most important protagonists with a
slightly different understanding of house music. Two years after
Martin Landsky=91s first release in 1995 called "Sampled House Vol. 1"
for Container Records, he then announced the release of his first 12"
the "Horner Corner EP" in 1997 under the name of Pseudonym 'City Nord'
on the London label MC Projects. From this point on Landsky=91s
definition of House music became internationally known.

The following year Martin released his 12=93 "My Hidden Basement" which
was the starting point of his first new label=82 Effortil Records, then
came "Love-Fourty" which was the second release to appear in 1999. His
label, now under the name of Intim Recordings and of course his first
releases for Dessous ("Wild EP") and Poker Flat ("Crude Clay"), made
him acquainted for the first time within a big circle of renown DJ=91s
and producers. Still, in the year 2000 he began working on his first
longplayer for Poker Flat Records, which in the following year brought
his status up to an international level.

"In Between"  was the title of Landskys debut album which was directly
linked to his third Intim-EP "Follow Me" and the Poker Flat Records
12" release "Sweet Sweet Morning". The year 2001 was the most
productive and successful year in Landsky=91s career.

In the Summer of 2003 Landsky had reached a new point in his
understanding of House music. On "Reject" he worked together
intensively with Filip G., an amazing vocalist from Hamburg. Not least
because of the catchy vocals, the single became a massive global club
hit which lasted for weeks in the German club charts and which also
landed Landsky into the playlists of some of the hippest DJs around.
There was also Landsky=91s remix of the single "The Difference" by DK7
which was played to extent up and down the clubs worldwide.

Besides the remixes (for D.H.S., Marc Romboy, Booka Shade, Eyerer &
Chopstick or Namito) In the past, Landsky recently created  some
special moments for club nights with the hits "Fools (They Don't Know
The Time)" from 2004, "FM Safari" (2005) and last but not least "1000
Miles" (2006), a dusky hypnotic masterpiece which is without a doubt
Landsky=91s most successful piece of work. More recently "Let me Dance"
was the next track to follow up in the footsteps of "1000 Miles".


*** Resident Advisor on Landsky's return to NYC:

"Does Martin Landsky play the sexiest techno in the business? After
blow-up sets in Miami and Detroit last year coupled with a devastating
afterhours performance at Rebel for Sunday School for Degenerates New
York, Martin returns for a follow-up lesson in house, techno, with
hints of acid. The Intim label headmaster puts together a portfolio
with everything from flawless mixing to sexy vocals that shows why he
is hailed as one of the top DJs in the upper class of the Techno
community."

AUDIO WERNER

Andreas Werner is one of today's most prolific figures in the
incredible techno universe of Cologne. He encapsulates a delicate
rhythmic sound and expression that is best exemplified in his 12=94
'Zwrtshak Drive'=97a favorite among artists such as Guido Schneider,
Richie Hawtin and Ricardo Villalobos. It was also a #1 selection in
the German publication Groove Magazine.

Supported in recent years by Triple R (head of the Traum label) under
his pseudonym Audio Werner, Andreas has developed a sound that has
renewed and continued the refined techno tradition in Cologne=97the
flagship European city for electronic music over the last decade.

Audio Werner has had releases on Perlon, Hello?Repeat, Traum, Trapez,
Moon Harbour, Ware, and his own Hartchef Discos, disseminating his
meticulous works that today still reveal many fresh nuances. His sound
is part of a genre that the Germans gravitate to consistently and not
without palpable success, especially considering the adversity towards
decadent raves in recent memory.

Both contemplative and functional, his musical style is a voice for
artistic minimalism in Cologne and serves as a reference for the
entire international scene.

The mailing list seems to be in a helping mood lately...I thought I give this a shot.

Got any suggestions on how I can weed out the good house music from the bad?  I'm sure the first thing that you will ask is what kind of house music?  I like it all, electro, funky, whatever.

If you can't help, maybe just shoot off some of your favorite tracks/artists?

Thanks.

Well... if you like it all, then it's all good... right?
Hence, no need to weed. So to speak.

An easy way is to only play vinyl.  Since vinyl is the best and all music released on vinyl is good, you're pretty much set if you just buy vinyl house records.  All digital house music is bad, period.

So I usually suck at getting subgenres right so excuse me if I mislabled it, but it's kind of... fidget/electro housish, if I remember correctly.

The hook says something along the lines of, "I find myself in the middle of the dance floor, in the middle of the dance floor, all eyes on me." Also says, "You can dance if you want to." (And no, it's not Safety Dance, thankyouverymuch.) Has a male and female vocal, heavily filtered.

Any clue? Was trying to find it online somewhere to send to a friend. Thanks!

(Yes, I'm still alive.)

Hearts and farts,
Alida

 Oof. I'm in the process of introducing my punk rock friend to house so luckily for you I just wrote out a list. He was interested in old school Chicago (e.g. Frankie Knuckles) shit, so I kind of went off of that. It's certainly not comprehensive and I'm sure I forgot some maaajor players (already had to add a few since I first messaged him), but here's what I wrote him, for a start:

Always good to browse here:

http://undergroundhouse.net/

On
that first page is a set by Troydon that is awesome, recorded at my Tonal birthday party a couple years ago. I'm sure I love it as much as I do because of the sentimentality, but I think it's pretty solid aside from that. You can also go
directly to here and search by artist if you sort by artist name: http://www.undergroundhouse.net/mixes/?view=guest_mixes

There
are tons of people I can recommend, but I'll start you off with some of
the classic heavy-hitters below. It's also pretty much all new stuff on UGH, but...

As posted recently, you can also check out old SF House sets here: http://www.thegathering-sf.com/music.html

And more from all over the U.S. here: http://www.ezeskankin.com/

I haven't listened to most of the sets on those two mixtape sites, but classic artists I might suggest:

-DJ Dan
-Doc Martin
-Donal Glaude
-Dutch
-Galen
-Garth
-Halo
-Hipp-E
-Jeno
-John Howard
-Josh Wink
-Mark Farina
-Markie
-Marques Wyatt
-Onionz
-Rick Preston
-Roy Davis Jr
-DJ Sneak
-DJ Spun
-Terry Mullan
-Tony
-Diz
-Sound Republic
-DJ Heather
-Greenskeepers
-Green Velvet/Cajmere (same guy, different aliases)
-Paul Johnson
-Derrick Carter
-Justin Long
-Miss Honey Dijon


 -Joshua (Iz)
-Jt Donaldson
-Raoul Belmans
-Jason Hodges
-Joey Youngman


(***This below was specific to what he was looking for, so I don't know how applicable it is to you, but...***):

You also might want to check out some of Terrence Parker's stuff:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB78W2Ux_9E&feature=PlayList&p=401B366B2D345905&playnext=1&index=3
http://www.myspace.com/littleetoile and click on the Terrence Parker track I have under my music section

Or Masters at Work (one of my all-time fav fav faaaaav producers):
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgPRwFXi7YQ&feature=related
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZOFHnSilek

And here is one of my all time classic favs:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaV3-ebhrMg&feature=related

And another:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ5PC54futo

That's all on the more traditional, lighter side of things. The darker, electro, tech, fidget house stuff is also really big right now in SF. Click here and listen to the "bump bump" track for an example:
http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=80010187

Or you can go here and stream Galen's latest released set (third down) from New Year's Day Stompy+Sunset party (though of the "dirty" shit, he's still on the lighter, more melodic side of things, which I love). That will give you a good overview of what's popping right now:
http://samurai.fm/bluntedfunk/index.php


For most of the sets you listen to you can go on UGH and then search in the Track ID section to find the name of the record you like. Or if no one's put it up, you can post and ask yourself (e.g. "I'm looking to ID this record: [Artist's name]'s [name of set] mix, at [time in mix when track comes in]."). People are generally pretty helpful.


*phew* Hope that helps! In general, I think the trick
is to pay attention to the records you like, grab the name of the label, then
search more of that label's stuff. You'll probably start to notice
trends in artists and labels that you like best. I'm not a DJ or producer so I'm certainly not the most knowledgeable when it comes to digging for records, but that should give you a start. Good luck! :) 


Lumph,
Alida

The mailing list seems to be in a helping mood lately...I thought I give this a 
shot.

Got any suggestions on how I can weed out the good house music from the bad?  
I'm sure the first thing that you will ask is what kind of house music?  I like 
it all, electro, funky, whatever.

If you can't help, maybe just shoot off some of your favorite tracks/artists?

Thanks.

I found the CD someone gave me with the mix on it and tracked down the podcast online: http://podcast.freshkidfx.com/2008/12/03/welcome.aspx? The track fully comes in at ~21:00. CLEARLY NOT BRITNEY SPEARS, ANDY.



Here are some more lyrics:



"I woke up this morning, I woke up this morning, I woke up this morning with a splitting, banging headache. What should I do? Now what should I do? You can dance if you want to. You can dance if you want to." *something something Techno* "One hand on a bottle, one hand on a groove. One hand on a bottle, one hand on a groove. You can dance if you want to. You can dance if you want to. You can dance if you want to."

*music*

"I find myself in the middle of a dance floor,  in the middle of a dance floor, all eyes on me, all eyes on me, all eyes on- all eyes on- all eyes on-"

It basically loops parts of the sample again after that. You get the idea.

Thaaaanks.

-Alida

Subject: Re: [sfraves] UPDATE: Track ID: Fidget /Electro House

How did I know this? I have existed from the morning of the world and  
I shall exist until the last star falls from the night. Although I  
have taken the form of Gaius Caligula, I am all men as I am no man and  
therefore I am a God.

And to answer your second query- "Pretty girls don't dance we... pose  
to Techno".

Weren't you originally looking for house labels?

For some of the old school SF flavor, check out some of the old Tweekin' and Panhandle Records releases if you can find them anywhere.  I have a bunch on vinyl...

Also check out Ovum, Dust Traxx, Blockhead, Imperial Dub, older Om records, ... I could go on and on, but I have to run.

BTW, speaking of Imperial Dub, Sunshine Jones (formerly of Dubtribe) is doing some new stuff with a more tech edge that I like a lot.

I'm looking for anything that can aid me in my search for good house music.

It's been frusterating when browsing through tracks to buy online.  It becomes tedious when I spend 30 minutes listening to songs and not hearing ONE good one.

Thanks for the suggestions.

I'm looking for anything that can aid me in my search for good house music.

It's been frusterating when browsing through tracks to buy online.  It becomes tedious when I spend 30 minutes listening to songs and not hearing ONE good one.

Thanks for the suggestions.

Uh, *cough* you could go SFR-core and check out local label Prismatic Tracks:

www.prismatictracks.com

Run by SF stalwart Andrew Phelan, loads of awesome releases, very high standard of quality.  All on Beatport, too.

Full disclosure: I have lots of tracks out on the label.

...but yes, check it out.  Tons of great stuff.

I'm looking for anything that can aid me in my search for good house music.

It's been frusterating when browsing through tracks to buy online.  It becomes tedious when I spend 30 minutes listening to songs and not hearing ONE good one.

Thanks for the suggestions.

Got this from another list.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

From=20the front page of Discogs.com... hilarious:

Latest Music Reviews:

DJ Ti=EBsto - somebedroomdj
I don't know how I even ended up reading the reviews on this page, but
I do know that statements about this freak being the "best dj in the
world, etc. etc." can not be allowed to filter into the collective
consciousness unchallenged. If that were allowed to happen, everything
would fall apart, we would all spontaneously de-evolve, up would
become down, cats would have sex with dogs and rational thought as we
know it would disappear. And I'll be damned if I'm going to contribute
to that happening.

So I just have to say for the record that this.. this thing is nothing
more than a marketing scheme and any claims of him being the best DJ
in the world are patently ludicrous. Music wise, there is nothing new
here. Same old re-hashed formulas and a no talent money machine. This
is not a baseless accusation either, just check the credits on his
productions. When it says "Written/Composed by: XXXX" it means that,
hello, somebody else did all the work. Simple music for simple minded
people who don't want to have to think too hard.

Of course, those of us with a functioning brain already know this. So
the real issue becomes this: what can be done about this wooden shoe
wearing, tulip growing menace?

Simple. I've outlined a few steps you can take to help wage this war:

1) If you hear somebody extolling the virtues of this thing, smack
them casually (but firmly) upside the head and continue the
conversation as if nothing had happened. Pavlov was onto something and
there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to employ this slight
variation of his methods.

2) Though the lion's share of commerce these days is done online,
there are certainly places where this thing's CD's and records are
sold in physical stores. If you ever have occasion to do so at one of
these dens of depravity, you should vomit, urinate, defecate or
otherwise expel your bodily fluid(s) of choice so as to contaminate
every last piece of this thing's merchandise so that the store is
unable to sell it.

3) Organize an event showcasing your favorite type of actual music and
aggressively advertise that the price of admission will be halved for
everyone who brings you one of this thing's CD's, records, t-shirts,
shoes, caps, keychains or any other such nonsense that is branded with
his name or image. Be very careful to wear rubber gloves when handling
the items and throw them all into a gigantic bonfire pit, to be lit at
the culmination of the event.

If we could all employ this 3 pronged attack, I think we could make
some real progress on this.

Now, to the fanboi's. I know your face is probably beet red right
about now and there's a good chance your body is trembling, but I need
you to hear and understand what I'm saying to you. We don't just hate
Tiesto. He's a mere puppet who is a symptom of a larger problem and I
think that anybody who puts him down probably realizes this. It's just
that he has willingly made himself the poster boy for the
commercialization of electronic music and, hence, a big fat target.
There was a time when people actually attended raves and went to hear
music they couldn't hear anywhere else and socialize with other people
who were just as sick of normal society's bullsh*t as they were. They
didn't go to idolize some idiot who was just properly marketed. It was
the music and it moved people. If you support and defend this Asshat,
it is a slap in the face to everybody who comes to this for the right
reasons. Just look at what has happened to every other subculture that
has been co-opted. Hip-hop is a mere shadow of it's former self. Rock
and roll was castrated decades ago and is no longer a viable option
for conveying a real message. Punk has become Emo and is sold at Hot
Topic. Even country music used to have some grit to it, but look at
the saccharine sweet bag of sh*t it is now.

Your hero is just another cog in the giant money machine that music
has been allowed to be reduced to. It's only about money. The fact
that he has to hire engineer's to make his productions for him means
that he is no different than a boy band that has other people write
their songs. If an "artist" isn't making their own art, how can you
put any faith in it? How can you listen to something that they
themselves do not believe in and not feel like you've been played for
a sucker while they laugh at you all the way to the bank?

The bottom line is that there is a lot of different music out there
and lots of genre lines that we create. But what it all comes down to
is that there is music that lies and music that does not lie. Support
music that does not lie, please.

 Albany Takes Step to Repeal Rockefeller Drug Laws By JEREMY W.
PETERS<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/jeremy_=
w_peters/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>

ALBANY =E2=80=94 The state legislature took pivotal steps on Wednesday towa=
rd
repealing much of what remains of the state=E2=80=99s 1970s-era drug laws, =
which
have tied judges hands and imposed mandatory prison terms for many
nonviolent drug offenses.

The Assembly approved by a 96-46 vote legislation that would restore judges=
=E2=80=99
discretion in sentencing lower level drug offenders by removing laws that
require a prosecutor=E2=80=99s consent before judges can send someone to a =
drug
treatment program. Debate on the bill got underway late Wednesday afternoon=
.

The same bill was introduced on Wednesday in the Senate, where Democratic
leaders vowed to quickly take it up. But the task now confronting
legislative leaders and Gov. David A.
Paterson<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/david=
_a_paterson/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>is
to reconcile the Assembly bill =E2=80=94 which is considered the most
far-reaching of the proposals on the table now =E2=80=94 with the governor=
=E2=80=99s plan
and the bill that Senate Democrats write.

Drug law reform has for years been one of the most divisive social issues
debated in Albany. Bills aimed at broadly overhauling the statutes, known a=
s
the Rockefeller drug laws because former Gov. Nelson A.
Rockefeller<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/ne=
lson_aldrich_rockefeller/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>championed
their approval, have routinely passed the Democratic-controlled
Assembly over the years, only to die in the Senate, which until this year
was run by Republicans.

With Democrats now in the majority in the Senate and Mr. Paterson an avowed
Rockefeller reform advocate, supporters of rewriting the drug laws see this
year as their best chance to pass a plan that essentially does away with
mandatory sentences for drug crimes.

=E2=80=9CI think the stars are aligned,=E2=80=9D Sheldon
Silver<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/sheldon=
_silver/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>,
the speaker of the Assembly, said at a news conference on Wednesday morning=
.
=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s time has come.=E2=80=9D

Senate Democrats were debating the issue in a closed-door conference on
Wednesday night.

But before any three-way compromise is reached, several sticking points nee=
d
to be resolved. Those issues include whether drug offenders who do not
complete treatment would be sent to prison and whether offenders would firs=
t
need to be certified as addicted before they could enter a treatment
program.

The State Legislature has already eliminated the stiffest provisions of the
Rockefeller laws, doing away in 2004 with life sentences for drug crimes an=
d
reducing other penalties for the most serious offenses. But supporters of
the Assembly plan believe that plan is an opportunity to finish what began
in 2004.

=E2=80=9CIt should not have taken this state 36 years to realize that manda=
tory
sentences are a one-size-fits-all approach,=E2=80=9D Mr. Silver said. =E2=
=80=9CWe cannot
wait another year.=E2=80=9DDrug law reform activists said that the legislat=
ion would
be an opportunity for New York to catch up after falling behind other state=
s
that have greatly expanded their drug treatment programs as alternatives to
prison.

=E2=80=9CThe general theme is states are making greater effort to divert pe=
ople into
treatment programs, and they=E2=80=99re start to use prison not as a first =
resort
but a secondary or last resort,=E2=80=9D said Gabriel Sayegh, the director =
of
organizing and policy for the Drug Policy Alliance Network, a national drug
law reform group.

=E2=80=9CIf the legislature follows through with moving toward a public hea=
lth
approach, New York could potentially go from having some of the worst laws
in the country to having some of the best.=E2=80=9D

But district attorneys have expressed concern that the proposals currently
being considered in Albany strip them of their important function as a chec=
k
against judges.

=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ve achieved a balance where we=E2=80=99ve preserved pub=
lic safety and reduced
our prison population,=E2=80=9D said Michael C. Green, the district attorne=
y for
Monroe County. =E2=80=9CI look at that and say why do we want to take this =
system
and make a seismic shift? My fear is that you=E2=80=99re going to disturb o=
ne of
those trends.=E2=80=9D

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tietso smackdown

think that artists have had other paint for them since forever. before 
michelangelo buonorotti painted the entire sistine chapel by himself, he 
had kicked out the many people helping him on the scaffold cause they 
kept on messing it up. the flemish masters often taught their skills to 
others and more paintings are often attributed to the masters than the 
ones they actually painted. klf didn't make much of their own music 
either. they just had the good sense to know what worked.

Actually, this is enough to go on for now.  It's slowly coming back to me now...I remember seeing onionz perform, and Donald Glaude.  I will have to report back soon.

Thanks.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: update..

i had my truck repo'd voluntarily. possibly like you have now. depending 
on what they sell it for at auction you are still legally required to 
pay back your loan even though you don't own the m'f'n vehicle. like 
they expect you to give up the car cause you can't pay for it then they 
expect you to still pay for it. it doesn't make sense. but the truth is 
that legally they can sue for you to repay the loan but they usually 
don't go that far. they just harass you continually till they think you 
will break. if they do start to leave messages with lawyers and letters. 
talk to a bankruptcy lawyer. but you should attempt to pay back what you 
owe if the vehicle is the only thing wrong on your credit history and 
you can afford to refinance it.

my advice get yourself a beater car like a toyota from 2005 and pay off 
your loan.

MARTIN LANDSKY

Unlike any other German protagonist of the electronic dance scene, Martin
Landsky withdrew himself from the well known category of  electronic dance
music. The verbal approach is of course only a portion of the complete and
original sound of Landsky=91s music which combines Techno, House, Minimal a=
nd
Funk. He has been creating waves as a sensational DJ and producer since the
mid-90's and Landsky has also been heard and recognized since 2000 as one o=
f
the key figures in the circle of producers at Poker Flat Recordings. The
label owner Steve Bug is also a long term friend of Landsky.

"As a DJ and as musician I try to balance between both traditional House an=
d
Techno music. Despite the fact that I use a lot of reduction for that
electronic sound, it is my duty to create deep music which must also always
include twisty and funky elements=93 says Martin. With confidant mixing fro=
m
retrostyle roots to up-to-date Club music, this all but consequently
represents Landsky like hardly any other musician and DJ of the Poker Flat
Style.

The special affinity to the roots of black club music fell in Landsky=91s
sight early on in his life. Through his hobby of breakdancing as an eleven
year old boy, Martin Landsky aquired an impulsive contact to dance music,
from funk to hiphop.  Starting initially on a tapedeck and then later on hi=
s
fathers Bontempi organ, as well as a pitch control record player, it was
clear to see from the first single megamixes he produced that he had lost
his heart hopelessly to the music.

In the beginning DJing was always the most important thing for Landsky=91s
musical identity. He was just fourteen when he first started to perform at
school celebrations  and private parties. Of course the ultimate moment of
his musical carrier came around when he first visited Hamburg=91s Kultclub
Front in 1988. The mixture of Funk and the growing trend of House, Acid and
Techno electrified Landsky like nothing else before and has affected his
musical aesthetics up untill the present day..  In 1994 his hard work and
persistance payed off and his dream came true when he was offered a regular
residency at his favourite club.

It soon became clear that Landsky would not last the duration as just an
exclusive and shining local heroic DJ and so then started to work for the
newly established distribution department of Container Records. He then
later worked for the distribution company Word and Sound, and it was throug=
h
both of these jobs that he gained valuable contacts which helped him to
travel much further afield as a DJ. At the end of 1999 he made a last and
final decision to leave Hamburg and try his luck in Berlin as a full time D=
J
and Musician. With the help of regular Bookings and his friends Cl=E9 and
Steve Bug, he helped to arrange a series of "Poker Flat Nights" at famous
"Sternradio" and regular headliner bookings in some of the most renowned
clubs in Berlin such as E-Werk, the Pfefferbank, Tresor and Casino. He also
put together many Mix CD=91s for labels such as Poker Flat, Systematic and =
the
Partysan complilation series which turned Landsky into one of the most
important figures in the German Club sound of the year 2000.

Parallel to this and as a result of his music productions, Landsky gained
the status as one of the most important protagonists with a slightly
different understanding of house music. Two years after Martin Landsky=91s
first release in 1995 called "Sampled House Vol. 1" for Container Records,
he then announced the release of his first 12" the "Horner Corner EP" in
1997 under the name of Pseudonym 'City Nord' on the London label MC
Projects. From this point on Landsky=91s definition of House music became
internationally known.

The following year Martin released his 12=93 "My Hidden Basement" which was
the starting point of his first new label=82 Effortil Records, then came
"Love-Fourty" which was the second release to appear in 1999. His label, no=
w
under the name of Intim Recordings and of course his first releases for
Dessous ("Wild EP") and Poker Flat ("Crude Clay"), made him acquainted for
the first time within a big circle of renown DJ=91s and producers. Still, i=
n
the year 2000 he began working on his first longplayer for Poker Flat
Records, which in the following year brought his status up to an
international level.

"In Between"  was the title of Landskys debut album which was directly
linked to his third Intim-EP "Follow Me" and the Poker Flat Records 12"
release "Sweet Sweet Morning". The year 2001 was the most productive and
successful year in Landsky=91s career.

In the Summer of 2003 Landsky had reached a new point in his understanding
of House music. On "Reject" he worked together intensively with Filip G., a=
n
amazing vocalist from Hamburg. Not least because of the catchy vocals, the
single became a massive global club hit which lasted for weeks in the Germa=
n
club charts and which also landed Landsky into the playlists of some of the
hippest DJs around. There was also Landsky=91s remix of the single "The
Difference" by DK7 which was played to extent up and down the clubs
worldwide.

Besides the remixes (for D.H.S., Marc Romboy, Booka Shade, Eyerer &
Chopstick or Namito) In the past, Landsky recently created  some special
moments for club nights with the hits "Fools (They Don't Know The Time)"
from 2004, "FM Safari" (2005) and last but not least "1000 Miles" (2006), a
dusky hypnotic masterpiece which is without a doubt Landsky=91s most
successful piece of work. More recently "Let me Dance" was the next track t=
o
follow up in the footsteps of "1000 Miles".


*** Resident Advisor on Landsky's return to NYC:

"Does Martin Landsky play the sexiest techno in the business? After blow-up
sets in Miami and Detroit last year coupled with a devastating afterhours
performance at Rebel for Sunday School for Degenerates New York, Martin
returns for a follow-up lesson in house, techno, with hints of acid. The
Intim label headmaster puts together a portfolio with everything from
flawless mixing to sexy vocals that shows why he is hailed as one of the to=
p
DJs in the upper class of the Techno community."

AUDIO WERNER

Andreas Werner is one of today's most prolific figures in the incredible
techno universe of Cologne. He encapsulates a delicate rhythmic sound and
expression that is best exemplified in his 12=94 'Zwrtshak Drive'=97a favor=
ite
among artists such as Guido Schneider, Richie Hawtin and Ricardo Villalobos=
.
It was also a #1 selection in the German publication Groove Magazine.

Supported in recent years by Triple R (head of the Traum label) under his
pseudonym Audio Werner, Andreas has developed a sound that has renewed and
continued the refined techno tradition in Cologne=97the flagship European c=
ity
for electronic music over the last decade.

Audio Werner has had releases on Perlon, Hello?Repeat, Traum, Trapez, Moon
Harbour, Ware, and his own Hartchef Discos, disseminating his meticulous
works that today still reveal many fresh nuances. His sound is part of a
genre that the Germans gravitate to consistently and not without palpable
success, especially considering the adversity towards decadent raves in
recent memory.

Both contemplative and functional, his musical style is a voice for artisti=
c
minimalism in Cologne and serves as a reference for the entire internationa=
l
scene.

Hey, thanks!  The track you mention... how did you get that?? It's a song I
did for my band Easystreet called "Borders of the Heart (International)",
you have the instrumental version. Just debuted this live the other
night.... Glad you like my work. =)

Love Chelsea

Subject: [sfraves] My Wed night Review

So I managed to get out on Wed night, hoping the public transportation =20

Centre to The Stud was kinda long... oh well... i got there & like =20
yaaaaaaaay... i saw Chel-C!!!!  We talked, I watched her set up, i saw =20
her look a goth girlie during their sound check under like this red =20
light, I saw them perform 1 song during sound check, man... that =20
vocoder stuff that Chel-C does is just so yummy... Travis' vocals were =20
sooo good to, I mean, he kinda went flat sometimes during sound check, =20
but man, his energy on stage is just Awesome!!!

So it was fun hangin' out there & just catching up, met a few new =20
people.. unfortunately, I had to duck out around 10PM-ish 'cause =20
well... had to catch 1 of the last buses that went to Hercules from El =20
Cerrito Del Norte... I mean... after reading the debut of their new =20
song in Chel-C's last post, I kinda felt bad I couldn't stay longer... =20
but hopefully I was able to show support by being there early... but =20
there are more Easy Street performances to come & I can't wait to =20
fully be there for those... YAAAAY

I mean.. it was a good night to be out of suberbia 'cause well, it =20
hasn't rained all day & it was just nice bein' in the city.. ok.. so =20
like by the time i got to hercules... like I usually call home for =20
someone to get me @ the gas station... so when i was @ the gas =20
station, i called & that recorded voice "the number you are trying to =20
reach" yada yada yada was on instead of singing... well... by the time =20
i got to hercules, it was like kinda hardcore pouring rain, so i =20
figured that the node where all teh comcast power comes from was =20
fucked again or something... so i just kinda kicked it @ the gas =20
station & talked to my Uncle who works graveyard there, then this dude =20
& this lady walk in & either bough 5 calling cards or 5 lotto =20
tickets... the guy turned around to me said HI to me...

"Are you OK?" he asked me.

"I'm alright I guess, I mean like, I'm hella tryin' to call home & the =20
phone's diconnected or something, I'm guessin' 'cause of the rain, & I =20
have no way to get home unless I walk which would be kinda hardcore to =20
do right now," I replied.

"So you need a ride home?  Where do you live?" he asked.

"Ummm, well... like kinda down the street, down refugio passed the big =20
circle," I said.

"Oh, that's not far, I can give you a ride home! That wouldn't be a =20
problem at all!" he said.

"Holy Shit, are you fuckin' serious??  That fuckin' Rocks man... Thank =20
You soo much!" I said.

"No problem," he said with a giggle then turned back to his friend to =20
take care of them lotto tickets or calling cards.

So I followed them back to their car & got in... there was this other =20
dude in the driver's seat... the lady got in the back, sat down, & =20
suggested we all pray.. lol... Hello 2day... so I bowed my head while =20
we all prayed.. shortly after, she got her stuff & left...

 From Shell to my house, the rain started pouring harder, but oh my =20
goodness man, Thank God I was in a car getting a ride & not walking =20
(no pun intended)... on the way to my house, the guys told me how they =20
were youth ministers, we had some Bible talk, & I told them about my =20
recent loses.. by the time we got to my house, they felt a need to =20
pray again, so for a few minutes, we prayed... again.. lol... then =20
they told me about their weekly Bible Study prayer meetings & invited =20
me, which I thought sounded like a good idea since I haven't really =20
fellowshipped in a while or visited that part of my life in a while, =20
so yeah, why not.. lol...

But yeah man... that was kinda intense... all in all, it was an =20
interesting night :)  I mean.. mondo point being, yes, I did see Easy =20

Hi everyone-
AZEEM who's an artist on our new record label Oaklyn Records is in the running for BET's "Artist Of The Month".  
He needs as many votes as possible to win this thing and we'd be grateful for anybody who could throw him their vote. It only takes 2 seconds and doesn't require you to enter any info or e-mail.  Just click Azeem and submit.

Anyways thanks so much for any help with this.  ~Mike Sims

Subject: [sfraves] The product of a sunny Saturday


I got super inspired at the Ghostly show last night and made a trippy,
spacey downtempo track, along with a big series of photos taken while
biking around in the sun.  Just wanted to share this stuff.  Check it
out!

Although Sunday Sessions is, strategically, placed at the tail end of
the weekend, The Endup's newest monthly, THE RHYTHM ROOM, is the
most evident way to top off that action packed weekend and a
memorable and enlightening way to start off the next work week.
Showcasing the bay area's grooviest and most reputable upcoming
local djs, THE RHYTHM ROOM promises to offer a night of the
catchiest, most innovative and intellectually produced DEEP, FUNKY,
SOULFUL, AFRO house music out there triggering an emotion deep in
our rhythmic souls making all of us dance like we never have before.
Tie your shoes, bring a sweat towel, and call a friend or 3 and join
the rest of us! There's friends to be made and music to be
introduced. MEET UP @ THE ENDUP for THE RHYTHM ROOM, a Brian Salazar
production.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Green House this Saturday feat. Jeno

info line: 415-756-3388 
 
SFHouseMusic.com and Nonstop present: Green House 
 
Why wait until St. Patty's day to go green?!  Get your green on and take a
journey into the green house!  Don't miss some of San Francisco's finest
DJ's, as they cultivate only the freshest organic beats.  The best part is,
you can bring some of the harvest home with you.  Anyone wearing green will
get a free mix CD!
 
Very large SOMA loft open for a good time from 10pm-6am.  (21+) 

Growing the love with DJs:   
 
JENO (Wicked, Noise from the void)
 
Andrew Phelan & Origami (Prismatic, drop music)
 
Homero Espinosa (YBD)
 
Deron (Stompy)
 
Dev E (Nonstop)
 
O'Henry (Stirty beats)

--0-1823074707-1236806694=:11865
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

yes, it really does. not only does the weekend start now (well, in a
couple hours) there are sooooo many things to choose from that, well,
this might get a little long. so skipping the usual witty intro and
getting right down to it!




Wednesday Mar 11th


when i said now i meant it! happy hour with the false profit
family! and celebrating the victory of brainchief! pizza, cheap beer
($3 red stripe) and good beats! 

EQUITY
Il Pirate (16th @ Utah)
6pm-9pm free

DJ Daps
Ganucheau


and if you thought i was kidding, i meant it when i said the weekend starts now! check this out!


Glimmer of Dope and Connected Grooves present:

DEEPCHILD
Nikola Baytala
Mr. Projectile
Mozaic
Jared F

103 Harriet (alley by Folsom @ 6th)
10pm - 3:30 am
$10 / $5 b4 11pm with RSVP @
www.going.com/deepchild

there are a few other events tonight but if you're on facebook you already have a gazillion invites for them!




Thursday Mar 12th


you'd think that just maybe since it seems everyone is doin an
event on wednesday this week that thursday would be a no-brainer, but
NO! i haven't seen MILK yet and they're showing it for free at the SF
Green Party HQ at 7pm so i might start my night there. otherwise, yup,
out of the gazillion things to choose from i recommend these two:


TRANSPORTED
bus stop gallery 
135 Dore unit C. (btw. 9th and 10th @ Folsom)
8pm-12am
$21 (www.brownpapertickets.com/event/58841)

Kid Kameleon
Space Invader
Little John

i
know the ticket price seems steep for a thursday but the bus is the
bomb! and to make up for the cost it's BYOB!!!! so jump on the bus and
check out the sites while rockin out with the transported crew! and
afterwards, walk over to shine and continue the night!



Shameless presents TECHNOCOLOR
Shine (Mission @ 9th)
10pm-2am
FREE!

DJ Icon
Dex Stakker
Jen Woolfe
MC Shahid Buttar


yup.
it's only thursday and already i feel exhausted! and i thought about
telling everyone to take it easy the rest of the weekend and go catch a
movie or something, but i don't think that's possible really. 




Friday Mar 13th


i might skip town to go to big mike's birthday but if i stay you might find me at one of these events....


YNOT?
NIMBY 8410 Amelia St. Oakland
$10

BAM
Mozaic
Alixr
Indigo
Boychaos
Raydeus
Sparkinzi 

and the Ambient Mafia in the side room!

come
help get Tuffy on the road! 2 rooms of music and the line-up is sick
AND an area for fire-dancers? if you were disappointd at the lack of
flames at carl cox come check this out!

and because party hoppin is always fun, here's another east bay event!

ORISHAS
5306 Foothill Blvd. Oakland
9pm-6am
$15

in honor of the spirits...

Stereographic LIVE
Parus
Dr. Spook
Nicolo
God Intoxicated
Chloro Djinn
Satir
Arwin

i
know it's psytrance so it's probably a surprise to see it on my list
but i do enjoy it quite a bit sometimes, and i figure since so often we
wind up hearing the same music from the same djs it might be time to
try something new!

exhausted yet? i am. with that in mind, i'm
gonna wrap it up. go see a movie, have a dinner party, maybe even get a
good nights sleep. when was the last time that happened on the weekend?
maybe someone will be inspired by a sunny sunday! see you all on the
dancefloor!

peace love and beats- pufuchu

I went and had a great time! I actually had a friend hook me up with the
info, and got there around 12:30. I mostly stayed to the left of the front
speakers, and was wearing a blue furry polar panda hat. I guess we timed our
departure appropriately, since we left around 3:45am and yay, missed tha
fuzz.

Two new mixes available for download. Not really brand new, but new as in I=
 never bothered to upload them and post them until now. Both mixes are clos=

. Yay for six hours of music! lol=0A=0AThe first mix is from 12/27/08 and i=
s deep soothing house at its best. This was recorded live on my Faderwave R=
adio show as usual. =0A=0AThe second mix is a bit older and was recorded li=
ve on Faderwave Radio back on 5/03/08. This one is pure dark and dirty UK s=
tyle Tech House in the vein of Evil Eddie Richards, Terry Francis, Gideon J=
ackson etc. I saw Terry Francis live at The Gathering in SF this past weeke=
nd and he absolutely hammered it. After the show I was still in a Tech Hous=

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: AFTERGLOW this Sunday w/ Solar, Lance DeSardi, & Sassmouth.

Afterglow was conceived as a chance to wind down after a long weekend by
listening to some chill music and having a few drinks with friends. The idea
is to allow some of SF's most talented and multi-faceted dance music DJ's an
opportunity to dig deeper into their collections and play music they
wouldn't be able to in a club setting. Anything's game, from ambient and
electronica, to dub techno, idm, atmospheric drum n bass downtempo, future
jazz, deep house and beyond.

So I logged onto Beatport this morning, and noticed that George Cochrane has

I loved the originals, but the Luke Solomon remixes are even better!

Five stars, three thumbs up, highly recommended.

...In before the curmudgeons!

SF has a pretty vibrant club scene with a lot of "Underground" music finding its way into bonafide club nights.  There are tons of exceptionally good DJs, producers and performers in the area.  The UG rave scene is not blowing up like it was back in its 90's and early 00's heyday, but there are still cool parties here and there if you're searching for something outside the club zone.  The day parties that happen in summertime outdoors are like nothing else and a big highlight.

The quality of life is ridiculously good (if you get a good job and can afford it, though I think prices in Miami are close if not on par already).  Food, fun, weather (if you're ok with a little cold and rain occasionally) and culture are great.

Employment picture sucks here right now (I just lost my gig) but the underground scene is great.  Seriously, we're all jaded and forget how lucky we are to have what we have in SF.  While we don't have anything like WMC, the Lovefest in September is pretty amazing.  

I guess that's not very curmudgeonly... 

Welcome to the list.

....In before the curmudgeons!

SF has a pretty vibrant club scene with a lot of "Underground" music finding its way into bonafide club nights.  There are tons of exceptionally good DJs, producers and performers in the area.  The UG rave scene is not blowing up like it was back in its 90's and early 00's heyday, but there are still cool parties here and there if you're searching for something outside the club zone.  The day parties that happen in summertime outdoors are like nothing else and a big highlight.

The quality of life is ridiculously good (if you get a good job and can afford it, though I think prices in Miami are close if not on par already).  Food, fun, weather (if you're ok with a little cold and rain occasionally) and culture are great.

Stap[e: Primer Happy Hour

Wish

Thurs, March 19



With special guest, Eli Bingham
And Resident DJs:

Qzen
Javaight
Fil Latorre

Stap[e Primer Happy Hour returns with special guest Eli Bingham (Nightlight
Music).

While he was getting a college education in the late '90s Bay Area, he
discovered the local rave scene - specifically the local techno scene, at
events thrown by Friends & Family, Mad, Gateway Systems, and Static. Eli's
officially retired from  the music scene these days, but always happy to
make a cameo appearance.

Recent Mix:  http://discodoreradio.blogspot.com/



Primer focuses on providing an outlet for DJs to bring their true crate gems
that they may not bust out on the dancefloor. Stuff for the mind and for the
soul.  Expect to hear deep eclectic music...always.

Parallel party, not a relocation.  SFLoveFest not a big as the Love
Parade, but our scene is dynamic and friendly.  There are a ton of
intimate, smaller parties, rather than big, iconic ones, though there
are a handful of well known crews in the area with reputations for
their parties.

You'll get people who think it's the best, who complain it's nothing
like berlin|somewhereineurope, and everything in between.  Really, the
biggest thing I can say is that it's what you make it.  If you expect
to see or find thousands or even hundreds of like-minded fans around
you every weekend, you will likely be disappointed, but in terms of
filling the generally smaller venues we've got as we can get them,
hey, it's an intense time.

Semper, motehrfalucking Fi.

Devil Dog.

Ooooh rah.

Technically, because I got out of my signed, Contractual Obligations to
Preserve, Protect and Defend The US Constitution of the United States of
America on 21 Sep 1990, the VA considers me a GW I Combat Vet, only because
I was in USMC uniform on 3 Aug 1990 the day Saddam's tanks went a rollin'
into Kuwait, on the very fucking DAY my contract went under 100 days and I
became a 2 digit midget.

doh.

Anyways, right now, I'm out of the USA, I'm living in Munich, Germany,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DjN6g50avv64 right now, with plans to move =
to
Berlin with my GF, Maja, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DoAnPgpDERJw on 1
September, 2009, so I can realize my plans to
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DcYj1nkwMp4k  (if Apollo was still subbed h=
ere
he would *totally* get that Hitler Invades Poland reference), so, like,
y'know, dude, you and I should talk further.

And if you are so inclined, this is an open invite to come out and visit if
you ever hop the pond again and make your way east.

Marine Corps Ravers Unite, and shit.

Welcome to SFRaves Party, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D2kJSq5bo8uI Teuf=
el
Hund.

Oh, and if you're over the age of 25, feel free to look up Raver Geriatric
here on Hyperreal, and introduce yourself to Mary W., who is also subbed to
SoCal Raves, in case you fall below the minimum age requirement of RG.

I'm sure she'd like you.

A lot.

Peisces,

Nyc

PS: all you jaded curmudgeons out there, yes, I'm looking @ =C3=9C, Joe
Blough.... whatever.

Parallel party, not a relocation.=A0 SFLoveFest not a big as the Love
Parade, but our scene is dynamic and friendly.=A0 There are a ton of
intimate, smaller parties, rather than big, iconic ones, though there
are a handful of well known crews in the area with reputations for
their parties.

You'll get people who=0A think it's the best, who complain it's nothing
like berlin|somewhereineurope, and everything in between.=A0 Really, the
biggest thing I can say is that it's what you make it.=A0 If you expect
to see or find thousands or even hundreds of like-minded fans around
you every weekend, you will likely be disappointed, but in terms of
filling the generally smaller venues we've got as we can get them,
hey, it's an intense time.

Technically, because I got out of my signed, Contractual Obligations to
Preserve, Protect and Defend The US Constitution of the United States of
America on 21 Sep 1990, the VA considers me a GW I Combat Vet, only because
I was in USMC uniform on 3 Aug 1990 the day Saddam's tanks went a rollin'
into Kuwait, on the very fucking DAY my contract went under 100 days and I
became a 2 digit midget.

that sounds about good enough for me. good to hear the love parade is still=
 over in europe too. i havent been to it in 4 years. might have to go this =
year. i think its around the same time as global gathering which i usually =
hit up too. as far as sf scene goes im not really worried about how big it =
is just about how good it is. lots of people over here who know nothing abo=
ut music and are happy hearing the same tracks played at every club in the =
city constantly. this is like top40 dj heaven because thats all they spin h=
ere.

Parallel party, not a relocation.=A0 SFLoveFest not a big as the Love
Parade, but our scene is dynamic and friendly.=A0 There are a ton of
intimate, smaller parties, rather than big, iconic ones, though there
are a handful of well known crews in the area with reputations for
their parties.

You'll get people who think it's the best, who complain it's nothing
like berlin|somewhereineurope, and everything in between.=A0 Really, the
biggest thing I can say is that it's what you make it.=A0 If you expect
to see or find thousands or even hundreds of like-minded fans around
you every weekend, you will likely be disappointed, but in terms of
filling the generally smaller venues we've got as we can get them,
hey, it's an intense time.

new blood! nice!

so mike, i recently hooked up a residency at the Ruby Skye monthy Torq which 
happens to be going down tonight. Marcus Schossow is in town & he sounds 
like someone who'd might be up your musical alley. I've been to south beach 
many a time and know how bad and unwelcome most high "brow clubs" can be - 
but i've found this particular night to be different in that it's a bit more 
party friendly and the crowd don't seem to have their egos stuck up there 
ass.  Those who know me can verify that this Ruby night must be different 
than most if they made ME a resident. LOL

ALSO... i just came upon 2 extra guestspots, which i'd like to offer to you 
and a friend (but plz accept only if your sure you can make it in their door 
by 11pm guestspot cut off time)
if you're down, just hit me back by 3pm today with the word (and the name of 
your friend if you go & want to bring one).

Undergrounds or clubs?

Clubs have dress codes, although you'll find SF clubs much more relaxed than Miami or other east coast locations about this.

In the underground anything goes.  Just ask one of the naked dudes with nothing on but a cock ring at Lovefest.

And you have no ID?  Hmm, I think now we are getting to the interesting part of your story...

I would think that getting a new ID is as easy as

It took less than a week for my new ID to show up.

I would think that getting a new ID is as easy as
http://express.hsmv.state.fl.us/
It took less than a week for my new ID to show up.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dress codes for parties in sf


Its easy to get a California ID if you already have the source or breeder documents such as a birth certificate etc.  If you don't have those and you've lost your MD ID, you might have issues.  But that's not just going to be a California issue; you'll have this problem everywhere.

FWIW until recently I worked for a company in the business of detecting false identity documents.  So I am familiar with CA and other state regulations in this area.

Best,

Peter

I would think that getting a new ID is as easy as
http://express.hsmv.state.fl.us/
It took less than a week for my new ID to show up.

Yeah it is pretty easy.  Get a copy of your medical records and set up an
appointment with a pot doc (medicann is pretty good).  They'll make
a judgment call if anything in your medical history warrants
being prescribed marijuana for (they have pretty loose standards).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] laptops replacing decks


Well, a lot of people have been switching recently I think.  The primary issues seem to be portability and cost.  The laptop interfaces have gotten better of course as well.  

I'm just a hobbyist, but with the economy I'm not investing in anything new right now so still vinyl for me.  

SF has been a vinyl mecca for a long time, but I think that time may be fading...see for example the recent demise of Open Mind and the rework at Tweekin' records here.  The days when we had half a dozen dance oriented vinyl stores are gone forever.

First, when did DJs ever have musical skills?
Ok seriously tho, if you are still doing the beatmatching I don't see why it
matters if you do it on plain vinyl, cd decks, or a digital vinyl solution.
 The only time I call foul is if you use software to do the beatmatching for
you.  Also, beatmatching with the bpm detect function on new gear is
borderline ;)

However, there is one case where I think having software align all the beats
for you is okay, and that is if you are doing a reasonably complex live PA
with something like Ableton.  If you have more then three tracks playing at
once, I personally think its acceptable to have software help.

Just my $0.02

now that i can agree with. as long as your still doing the beatmatching you=
rself. ableton is a little different tho from mp3 mixing because with ablet=
on you can do live remixes and shit from what im told. havent actually look=

The early house and techno pioneers embraced technology to create
"electronic" music.  Knowing your history is the essential part in
understanding where you're at.  But are we content with that?  Should DJs
also stop playing music made with software, and not analog hardware?  While
the 1200s are classic, and there's nothing quite like spinning on vinyl, I'd
compare my ableton live setup and mid controller to an F22 fighter jet.
It's capable of mind boggling things, especially when you compare it to an
above average DJ on a pair of technics, which is more like a propellor
driven WWII plane.

It's kind of funny, cuz all the kids who are new to the scene, are
completely mesmerized by ableton live and curious about how it works.  But a
lot of the old heads, grunt then mumble something under their breadth when
they see someone on it.  These are the same people 10, 15 years ago who
stood in front of the DJ, mezmerized by the continuous grooves that churned
out of 2 or 3 turntables.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] laptops replacing decks

Possibilities are greater with the computer on the table . I would  
like to afford 2 cd's and a laptop and turns. But for now, I will just  
play at home with my mk5's and my oversized pc.

Funny thing here, I started making music with the pc and only recently  
bought turns for a killer deal. Wow!Vinyl is fun and has a feel like  
no other.

One day I will get traktor and be a really happy camper.
  plus I need like a 6 channel mixer.

Too much good stuff to choose from

Now that is a question I don't know the answer to.  

You should contact the CA DMV directly or if you want I can reach out to my DMV contact and see what they say.  Seems like a call to 800 number would probably answer this for you though.

Best,

Peter

Its easy to get a California ID if you already have the source or breeder documents such as a birth certificate etc.  If you don't have those and you've lost your MD ID, you might have issues.  But that's not just going to be a California issue; you'll have this problem everywhere.

FWIW until recently I worked for a company in the business of detecting false identity documents.  So I am familiar with CA and other state regulations in this area.

Best,

Peter

I would think that getting a new ID is as easy as
http://express.hsmv.state.fl.us/
It took less than a week for my new ID to show up.

I think the part I miss the most was being the guy that had stuff on vinyl =

I could drop brother from another planet's "Planet Earth" and KNOW no one i=
n my tri state area did not have that record.

That's virtually impossible now with file sharing.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] laptops replacing decks


Vinyl (and even CDJs) are a little like manual transmission on a car.  For some folks, it affords a feeling of increased control, but really, most folks that say they would "only drive a stick" are saying so because of macho chest-puffing.  

Laptop DJing is a little like a modern automatic transmission.  When needed, it makes a task that requires little to no skill (beatmatching) automatic.  It can take a little bit of control away from the driver, but it frees them up to focus on other things.  Modern automatic transmissions afford the user plenty of control, and many have "manual-like" modes.

Now imagine that these automatic cars were 4 times lighter and more efficient than manuals, could hold 400 times as much gas, and folded up into a suitcase, and you'll have an idea of what the appeal is.

When I DJ these days, I use DJ software like Torq, which gives me the option to beatmatch myself or to auto-beatmatch (but that usually takes some finesse, it's not perfect).  The nice thing is, I can 2x4 with a dj who's playing vinyl or cds, beatmatch with them, and once I get going, flip into auto-mode and focus on really fucking with the sound for a little while if I want.  Most DJ software lets you control the audio with actual turntables if you want, but I forego that, mainly because I love to be able to set up my small gear, plug it in right as the previous DJ is playing (without screwing up the setup) and go go go!  The whole setup fits in a small backpack I can easily carry on my bike.

However, I will assert that somebody's GOT to have a good controller to make laptop djing legit.  Even I get pissed when I'm watching somebody sit there and throw tracks into itunes or plop them into an Ableton timeline with little-to-no interaction.

now that i can agree with. as long as your still doing the beatmatching yourself. ableton is a little different tho from mp3 mixing because with ableton you can do live remixes and shit from what im told. havent actually looked into it yet but plan too soon. can you get ableton on mac? cuz i hate pc.. especially for media applications.

First, when did DJs ever have musical skills?


Ok seriously tho, if you are still doing the beatmatching I don't see why it matters if you do it on plain vinyl, cd decks, or a digital vinyl solution.  The only time I call foul is if you use software to do the beatmatching for you.  Also, beatmatching with the bpm detect function on new gear is borderline ;)


However, there is one case where I think having software align all the beats for you is okay, and that is if you are doing a reasonably complex live PA with something like Ableton.  If you have more then three tracks playing at once, I personally think its acceptable to have software help.

Okay, so here's the thing with programs that automatically beatmatch like
ableton.  If you're only mixing from channel 1 to channel to, at the end of
every song, I completely understand your argument.  However, that's not how
ableton is meant to be utilized.  There are quite a few DJs who use ableton
in this manner, and I've heard of one legend on the playa who often mixes in
this manner.

Ableton is better suited for piecing loops of musics, into new songs.  It's
also great for remixing songs live, or doing live editing.  I can layer a
photek drum n bass loop at 135 BPM, add in some keys from a DJ Shadow song,
add a vocal sample, percussion from here and there, a wobbly acid line, and
I've got a new fucking song on the spot!  Can you do this on turntables,
well, actually you can.  Since turntablism has gone underground, there's a
lot of cats, especially in SF who are perfecting this artform.  Have you
seen the vestax turntable that has buttons to adjust pitch speed,
essentially turning the turntable into a real instrument.  You have groups
like Gunkhole and 4oneFunk who have pieces of a live band like a drummer,
then lay down all the other elements: bassline, solos, melodies, leads, etc,
with different members of the group using their turntables to add to the
song, it's rather insane.

However, unless you have 4 or 5 highly skilled turntablist to create a new
song, ableton let's you do it all on your own.

Check out gunkhole creating live music on turntables here:

Ableton for Mac = yes.

Remixing in Ableton = yes (although it's way more fun to stop hacking on 
other people's shit and just write your own music in Ableton, or if you 
feel like saving some money and don't mind learning some key commands, get 
started today with ReNoise *it's free and quite badass*)

As far as a controller goes, you absolutely have to use a: 
http://saturn5.com/andy/images/caltrain/phatboy-oakie.JPG (not available 
in stores, but I can make you one, I can even put a fake Oakie signature 
with "With Love Frum IBITHAARH" in silver pen on the back so it's just 
like mine)

As for the whole topic of DJing:

DJing can suck my fucking balls, long live DJing.

Hello world, my name is Andy.  You might know me as a mild mannered 
sysadmin, who likes to write long posts but at night I change.  I change 
into things.  Among the things I turn into are dj, guitarist, producer, 
editor, guitarist, sound system tuner, dancer, shittalker, beer guzzler, 
and freak of nature.

Oh wait, no I don't.  I don't change at all, I'm all those things.  They 
are not identities, they are traits or abilities or interests.

The whole concept of the DJ as a figure worthy of respect boggles my mind.  
I've done my time as one (something like 13 years now).  I've played back 
to back with people like Christian Smith, DJ Rush, and John Selway.  I've 
raged 5000 people at once and also had that sinking feeling when the only 
person on the dancefloor does that 'look busy and walk away' thing while 
my favorite track is playing.  I've helped throw some pretty darn spiffy 
underground events and clubs, put out a couple records, been a long 
standing and vocal personality on this list, and probably been called a 
self-righteous douche more than your dad (no, not the guy your mom was 
married to, your *real* dad, the pool guy).

The funny thing about this is that nobody seems to know who I am these 
days.  The music that I came in on, techno, is still played.  But nobody 
seems to remember me.  I still make music, I still love it, but I just 
don't get asked to much.

So what's my point other than talking about myself?  I don't need one.  
Just kidding.  My point is that you should do what you love, for the love 
of it, and not count on something outside yourself to define yourself.  
Your success and satisfaction should come from within, and be of yourself.  

About a year ago, I went to a club that was GOING OFF INSANELY to some kid 
who wasn't even born in 1983 playing Human League off an iPod, 
trainwrecking merrily from track to track.  And it made me want to 
bitchslap him, really hard, repeatedly.  I thought of my ability, and his 
lack thereof.  My skill, my talent, my records, my gear, my energy.

My ass.  I was jealous.  Just plain petty.

DJing is just playing music these days.  Some people know how to 
beatmatch, and that's cool.  Some people have some rare tunes that will 
break your brain, and that's cool.  Some people will never 'dj' out 
anywhere, but they meticulously set up playlists for when they're cooking, 
gardening, watching porn, whatever.  Some people just like jamming out 
to whatever is new that week and don't think much of what's good or 
bad, they just ride this timeline of stuff that comes out.  And that's 
cool.

Don't dream of being a succesful DJ.  If you like the music you pick and 
how you bring it in, you already are.  The point I'm making is do what you 
love with music, and people might get it.  With format, sure I have 
preferences, but I gotta hand it to the guy with the iPod playing Human 
League, he was killing it.  For all my knowledge of music, deep bag of 
vinyl tricks, zen philosophies and their applications to performance and 
strange experiences... that night I was just the grumpy looking bastard

 What Andy said before I got a chance to. Yeah.

Seriously though- and maybe this is because I'm not a DJ so I don't have any personal investment (or, admittedly, a trained ear/musical knowledge/etc.), but- why the fuck should it matter?

A DJ is there to rock the crowd. Period. If software is assisting with that, who cares? Does it mean we should enjoy ourselves less? Does it mean it detracts from the experience? The only thing it detracts from is DJ worship (uuuuwww he can beatmatch!) and I don't think that matters. Again, maybe this is just because I'm not knowledgeable enough on the ins and outs of turntabling, but seems to me that the people who are pissed about this software being used are really just butthurt that they're not in the cool club anymore. The resistance to the software is the resistance to ego loss. "But, but, he's cheating! I CAN DO WHAT HE DOES WITHOUT THAT SOFTWARE!" That's great, and not to say that your abilities and talent shouldn't be respected, but guess what? It's not about you. It's about whether you get people shaking it on the dancefloor, software-assisted or not.

If anything, I think it could lead the way for some serious breakthroughs because it lends itself to increased creativity and working outside the box. With the beatmatching hurdle eliminated, for example, people have more freedom to tweek shit around and focus on other aspects. It also encourages DJs to try new things and push the envelope to set themselves apart from every other DJ Tom, Dick or Harry who is relying on the same software to do what previously had to be learned. Does that make sense? 

If suddenly everyone can do what was already done, it means DJing has to be reinvented to up the ante. The previous lowest common denominator of DJ skillz (yes, with a "z") has now been eliminated from the equation so the bar for success has to be set higher. That could lead to some amazing shit and I'm all for it. If you're a real lover of dance music, if you're a true musician and in it to make amazing music and rock the crowd, then you would be, too. You would be embracing this opportunity to revitalize the art and create anew, thrilled by the avenues this open us, the seemingly infinite possibilities of where this could take dance music and DJing. Not to say that vinyl and turntabling shouldn't still be appreciated and respected, but the people who are pissed about this change are really just freaked out about being sussed out and left behind because they know they don't possess the musicianship to meet these new challenges.


Still not a DJ,

Ableton for Mac = yes.

Remixing in Ableton = yes (although it's way more fun to stop hacking on 
other people's shit and just write your own music in Ableton, or if you 
feel like saving some money and don't mind learning some key commands, get

with "With Love Frum IBITHAARH" in silver pen on the back so it's just 
like mine)

As for the whole topic of DJing:

DJing can suck my fucking balls, long live DJing.

Hello world, my name is Andy.  You might know me as a mild mannered 
sysadmin, who likes to write long posts but at night I change.  I change 
into things.  Among the things I turn into are dj, guitarist, producer, 
editor, guitarist, sound system tuner, dancer, shittalker, beer guzzler, 
and freak of nature.

Oh wait, no I don't.  I don't change at all, I'm all those things.  They 
are not identities, they are traits or abilities or interests.

The whole concept of the DJ as a figure worthy of respect boggles my mind.  
I've done my time as one (something like 13 years now).  I've played back 
to back with people like Christian Smith, DJ Rush, and John Selway.  I've 
raged 5000 people at once and also had that sinking feeling when the only 
person on the dancefloor does that 'look busy and walk away' thing while 
my favorite track is playing.  I've helped throw some pretty darn spiffy 
underground events and clubs, put out a couple records, been a long 
standing and vocal personality on this list, and probably been called a 
self-righteous douche more than your dad (no, not the guy your mom was 
married to, your *real* dad, the pool guy).

The funny thing about this is that nobody seems to know who I am these 
days.  The music that I came in on, techno, is still played.  But nobody 
seems to remember me.  I still make music, I still love it, but I just 
don't get asked to much.

So what's my point other than talking about myself?  I don't need one.  
Just kidding.  My point is that you should do what you love, for the love 
of it, and not count on something outside yourself to define yourself.  
Your success and satisfaction should come from within, and be of yourself.  

About a year ago, I went to a club that was GOING OFF INSANELY to some kid 
who wasn't even born in 1983 playing Human League off an iPod, 
trainwrecking merrily from track to track.  And it made me want to 
bitchslap him, really hard, repeatedly.  I thought of my ability, and his 
lack thereof.  My skill, my talent, my records, my gear, my energy.

My ass.  I was jealous.  Just plain petty.

DJing is just playing music these days.  Some people know how to 
beatmatch, and that's cool.  Some people have some rare tunes that will 
break your brain, and that's cool.  Some people will never 'dj' out 
anywhere, but they meticulously set up playlists for when they're cooking, 
gardening, watching porn, whatever.  Some people just like jamming out 
to whatever is new that week and don't think much of what's good or 
bad, they just ride this timeline of stuff that comes out.  And that's 
cool.

Don't dream of being a succesful DJ.  If you like the music you pick and 
how you bring it in, you already are.  The point I'm making is do what you 
love with music, and people might get it.  With format, sure I have 
preferences, but I gotta hand it to the guy with the iPod playing Human 
League, he was killing it.  For all my knowledge of music, deep bag of 
vinyl tricks, zen philosophies and their applications to performance and 
strange experiences... that night I was just the grumpy looking bastard 
with the crossed arms.

Part of my enjoyment of a DJ is knowing what kind of technical skills they
have.  Sorry, just it.  I understand if other people consume a DJ's output
only through the filter of "what does it sound like", but many of us also
listen for transitions, where the dj cuts in, etc.  I don't think that is
wrong, just different.

Or it could lead to a new era of laziness, where DJs spend more time dancing
around, looking cool, and having software blow through their preselected
playlist.  I personally don't think eliminating the skill of beatmatching is
a positive, but hey, you are all free to disagree :)  At some point you have
to ask yourself "how am I different then a bar mitzvah DJ".

"Part of my enjoyment of a DJ is knowing what kind of technical skills they
have.  Sorry, just it.  I understand if other people consume a DJ's output
only through the filter of "what does it sound like", but many of us also
listen for transitions, where the dj cuts in, etc.  I don't think that is
wrong, just different."

Right, which is why I prefaced my statement with pointing out that my opinion may just be
because I'm not a DJ/don't have a trained ear. But this is sort of a
moot point, given what I said below about it opening up new avenues for
creativity. This would still provide that experience you crave, I think.


"Or it could lead to a new era of laziness, where DJs spend more time dancing
around, looking cool, and having software blow through their preselected
playlist.  I personally don't think eliminating the skill of beatmatching is
a positive, but hey, you are all free to disagree :)  At some point you have
to ask yourself 'how am I different then a bar mitzvah DJ'."


I don't think this will be the case. Yes, it will certainly make this
possibility more accessible, but that type of turntabling has always
existed (e.g. nightclubs, discotheques, etc.) and nothing is changing
that. The DJs to whom that appeals to will continue to play that way,
and the dancers to whom that appeals to will continue to frequent those
events. Just because laziness is accessible, doesn't mean people will
settle for it. If that were the case, we'd all just be sitting in a
room together listening to itunes (or a CD player, or a record player,
or a radio, in days past). 

But that's not the case, is it? People have
*always* demanded a more spontaneous, fluid, interactive creative
experience, just as people have always been impassioned to provide
that. And as always, the people who are not willing to meet this new
era of possibility will fall back, and those that are will rise up. It's as simple as that.


STILL not a DJ,

actually, "I play better tracks" is as valid an answer as it is possible to
give for that question.  the biggest factor in a set being good or sucking
is.....Track Selection!  and who would have guessed people care more about
hearing great songs than they do about hearing great transitions?  that's
why the iPod dj can blow up a place even if he trainwrecks every mix: he's
playing the right song for the moment and that is what counts the most.
that's by no means to say selection is the only factor, but you can be just
plain decent at mixing, nothing terribly special, and people will love your
sets if you're a great track selector and can keep a groove going.

if you think ableton etc. will lead us to a new era of lazy, bad dj'ing, i'd
like to ask if you think we'd be better off if those same people still
became dj's but used vinyl.  they'd still probably be terrible and lazy
about the things that really matter, and they'd have beatmatching to praise
themself for if they learn how to do it.  i don't think we'd be better off
at all.

i started dj'ing towards the end of the vinyl era, but decks were still the
thing to get so i learned how to beatmatch and cue a record.  took practice
but (and let me emphasize this) it's the kind of skill that almost anyone
could learn if they practice seriously.  that's all beatmatching is, a skill
anyone can learn if they take the time.  the lowest common denominator of
the dj world.  when i first went to college i had no room for decks, a
mixer, and vinyl, so i made friends with someone who had CDJ's and kept
right on going.  i've used ableton off and on depending on if i had access
to CDJs at the time, cause it's that or just quitting for a while.  i guess
what i'm saying is, technology changes.  use what's useful to you, and
barring that use what you can get.  there's no reason to hold one piece of
technology in esteem over others just because it's older.

lastly, i am in complete agreement with everything Andy and Alida said
better than i could.

Am I not allowed to disagree with this point? What if track selection is

This is the thing, grasshopper:


----- Original Message ----
From: Matt Stone <matthew.d.stone@gmail.com>

Part of my enjoyment of a DJ is knowing what kind of technical skills they
have.  Sorry, just it.  I understand if other people consume a DJ's output
only through the filter of "what does it sound like", but many of us also
listen for transitions, where the dj cuts in, etc.  I don't think that is
wrong, just different.

---

Beatmatching is a rote skill, as basic as riding a bike.  It's a neat trick, but it's not art.  Track selection, transitions, reacting to the crowd, energy management, creative sound processing- these are arts, and quite technical..  And all of them happen in today's laptop DJing, whether the DJ chooses to beatmatch themselves or not.  In fact, laptop djs have the capability to have more tracks, MUCH better processing options, more control, more creative tools, etc.  

---
Or it could lead to a new era of laziness, where DJs spend more time dancing
around, looking cool, and having software blow through their preselected
playlist.  I personally don't think eliminating the skill of beatmatching is
a positive, but hey, you are all free to disagree :)  At some point you have
to ask yourself "how am I different then a bar mitzvah DJ".
---


But what do you call that 3-5 minute chunk in the middle of most dj tracks where the dj has little to do but drop the bass out here and there and try to look like they're doing something?  That doesn't change in laptop djing, only when i hit that chunk, I can choose to totally fuck shit up, mix in loops from 3 other tracks, or whatever.  It's like giving performer a box full of new toys.  All one can do in vinyl is match up another track and start mixing them together.  The best djs can really get shit going that way, but most of them are on Serato these days anyway.

I agree- people trying to act like a performer while a preselected playlist plays are turds- but those people aren't djs or performers, and they don't represent the state of the art of what people are doing with laptops.  My dj gigs have as much adrenaline and danger as ever- I just have a lot more say in the way shit sounds.

Eh, it chaps my ass a bit too, but I'm coming to realize it's because I 
practiced *a lot* for years and years and years and it seems cheap.

-&e->Part of my enjoyment of a DJ is knowing what kind of technical skills they

In theory yes, in practice no.  It creates a new path of least resistance.  
I've seen DJ after DJ that basically have their set all laid out in 
software before they play.  You could shoot them dead and the only change 
you'd hear is less annoying filter/cut action.  I want all the new 
technology to make music better, but it's just not.  I'm really starting 
to love these old sets that have been popping up, just two decks and a 
Rane MP-24 (a mixer that didn't have gains or per channel eq, but just 
sounded fucking great).  Music wasn't so compressed, you had to know your 
records better before per channel EQs became popular, etc.

The world is changing, and what I've noticed is that the sun is setting on 
DJing in general.  The technology already exists to beatmatch most of the 
stuff out there from computer control.  Soon, your aunt will be able to 
play a beatmatched funk + disco set while doing the dishes out of media 
player or itunes, just pick the genre, tempo and feel.  Most of the best 
artists I met in DJ-land are moving towards bands, live collaboration, 
production and other art forms.  We have to ask ourselves if we're just 
seeing the tide turn back after putting too much stock in an idea.

I personally find that I like my music with less changes, more hypnotic, 
than crowds seem to these days.  I can't stand electro-house, the rave 
revival shit that's been coming out... too many cheesy cliche'd changes, 
it's ADD as all hell, it never seems to really settle into a _groove_.  
But as ravE gave way to Club, the chemistry of the partygoers has 
changed... and hell, I can play my old mixes or go out and catch some 
dubstep, house or maybe hit up a techno weekly if I want to hear what I 
want to hear.

-&e->Or it could lead to a new era of laziness, where DJs spend more time dancing
-&e->around, looking cool, and having software blow through their preselected
-&e->playlist.  I personally don't think eliminating the skill of beatmatching is
-&e->a positive, but hey, you are all free to disagree :)  At some point you have
-&e->to ask yourself "how am I different then a bar mitzvah DJ".

Ask yourself that *now*.  You're not.  In fact, I'd be willing to say it's 
*harder* in some ways to take requests, not offend the old people while 
not boring the young people and be the wedding/prom kinda DJ than it is to 
have my name on a flyer and have the expectation to play what the fuck I 
want.  It's fun to watch a room full of peoples hands go up in the air and 
eyes roll back when you're fucking killing it in a build mix... not so 
much watching a bunch of akward people do the Electric Slide or slow 
dance to Crazy for You *one*more*time*.

At the "heyday" of the time I was playing parties, I was working my 
goddamn ass off.  I didn't plan sets ahead of time but knew my records 
cold, I read the crowd, I usually packed two boxes (named Fat Man and 
Little Boy) if I was planning on playing more than an hour.  I scratched, 
I eq'd, I hot mixed, I beat juggled and banged doubles, I three decked, 
tag teamed, 2x4'd, etc.  I bought records like crazy, when I walked into 
Open Mind or Solid Grooves, there would usually be a small pile of records 
put aside for me, cause these people knew what I liked.

And I was making about a third as much per booking, and seeing less 
bookings, as a pair of goons who played 8-12 minute long records end to 
end, often repeating the same set night after night.  The records almost 
all had the same rhythm, no swing, only came out on a few labels, and 
featured *obvious* "mix here" points where the bassline fell out making 
their lives easy.  They looked so bored mixing, except when the tracks 
would build, when their hands would come up and they'd do their fake 
cheerleader shit.  Their popularity drove me batshit, I hated them.

And 25 years from now, they'll be the ones who are remembered.

Vinyl is not a guarantee of skill.  DJing is not a meritocracy, it just is 
what it is.  If someone is picking out prerecorded music and playing it, 
they're a DJ.  Everything else is a matter of opinion and taste.

this phenomenon is rooted in a couple hard to take realities.... first and =

 almost all entirely digital download. even though using something like fin=

also, at least here in sf, (or perhaps in my families) so many people incor=

 ableton live does make more sense.

there will always be shitty djs and producers. because we're on the leading=

ncially accessible to every frikkin idiot that wants to be a star there is =
perhaps a flood of subpar production and sets these days but in the end qua=

and yes. there is still vinyl. you gotta warn a promoter, otherwise there w=
on't be needles on
the tables, but vinyl is still loved. and because of the rarity when things=
 get released on vinyl it's usually really good.=20

the thing that drives me insane? low quality mp3s. if you're gonna spin dig=
ital, go for the wav or flak version of the tracks. it makes a difference o=
n the bigger sound systems. please, i'm beggin you all out there!!! no low =
quality mp3s on the big bins!!!!

You go girl- but respecting a DJ for "technical skills" is IMO the  
same as respecting someone because of their Guitar Hero abilities.
Sure, they've got that little talent down pat, but I'm not going to  
rip my top off and offer myself to them just because I see it in action.
DJs have only 1.5 functions for me- 1) play good music .5) that I  
haven't heard before

Sure, people like Andy and George may describe what they do as DJs and  
call it creative, but I think they don't see the forest for the trees-  
and I think that what they do ventures entirely in to the realm of  
production and they should call it such, using decks or CDJs or  
whatever as just one of the tools.

I make music myself, and historically I mentally modeled the  
difference between "producer" and "DJ" as "Am I playing someone else's  
music or am I playing my own?"- but that devolves in to "Am I using  
inbuilt ROM sounds/samples or my own?"- and then if you want to get  
all Zen it becomes "I didn't create that Crow that just made a noise  
that I recorded, God did- am I still legit?"

Ultimately such thought is meaningless and stupid and will drive you  
mad, so ultimately "the DJ" should be thought of just as I said-  
someone who can play good music and might play something you haven't  
heard before.

Interestingly in the radio business the conventional wisdom is that people only want to listen to songs they've heard before, because most people will switch stations if a song they don't know comes on.  

So the best rated radio DJs often never play anything new at all...

Funny I think.

You go girl- but respecting a DJ for "technical skills" is IMO the same as respecting someone because of their Guitar Hero abilities.
Sure, they've got that little talent down pat, but I'm not going to rip my top off and offer myself to them just because I see it in action.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] laptops replacing decks

i'm not so sure.. i think it would be better to rep the local people in 
your area that are making tracks if your are going to be the DJ 
ambassador thing. so many people making music now its better to get 
localized and dig up shit that nobody has anywhere else but home. that 
way if you as a dj put together music from your town somebody in sydney 
or tokyo is going to shit bricks and try to understand why the SF sound 
is so hot. then they in turn will make us shit bricks with their stuff. 
and much terracotta will be rectally emanated world wide.

    in a sense the computer is still pushing out  the boundaries if you 
can think outside the box a bit. the computer, musically, is sort of 
shooting holes in conventional thought every day. there are so many 
tangents and communications going on world wide that things are 
advancing at an exponential rate. this is a great time for music. get on 
board or get left behind. i feel it is the people that can think a few 
steps ahead and the people who have their fingers on the pulse of what 
could happen that could really make the difference in the overall 
direction of music.

but then again there is that luddite fear.. getting on the bandwagon. 
i've staved off from buying a laptop for music for so long because 
things have been building up and phasing out so quickly i felt that as 
soon as i had enough money to buy the gear it would have been outdated. 
but i don't think i can afford to wait any longer.

I think the radio station Energy 92.7 here put together a gay rave cruise a while back.  The problem with rave cruises IMO is people falling overboard which the party hosts could be held liable for. Good luck getting insurance for such an event.

There are a few crews that throw boat parties here, not quite a cruise, but you still can fall off and drown, Some might recall the Digipop hosted party a few years back where someone "fell" overboard....

Maybe we can pass out vests out to people. Put like blinking lights on em,
so if they fall over board we can see them blinging in the waves.

I'm with you Mike on the wording.

It is a serious stretch to call what is happening now with computers and 
the DJ, real dj'ing.  From either an etymological point of view, from a 
physical point of view or from a practical point of view.  I know many 
new jacks love this technology, and the argument can be made that it 
does not replace skill, to some degree.

But there is skill in being in a dark club, digging through heavy crate 
of records, trying to read a label, slapping it down on a deck, getting 
the pitch just right, and coming in at the right point.  That physical 
activity , I think, is what the crowd unconsciously grooves to, because 
the act of anticipation is actually seen as you witness a DJ take a 
platter off and put one one.  You know something is coming.  Now?  Not 
so much.

I've been out to plenty of mp3j clubs at this point and all I can say is 
that the energy and the levels need Viagra. I know many here will claim 
to rock the house, yeah yeah yeah, but I am not convinced until I see 
them rock the vinyl with skills and results.

Times do change however and they will continue to change.  Some changes 
I will like, others I will abhor, such is life.

While I understand the physical problems with vinyl, I am the kind of 
guy who would never buy a kindle over a real bonafide book.

Ymmv.

the cruise line has already agreed to let me set it up which im sure means =
that it'll be covered under their insurance. and it will definately not be =
a gay rave cruise (tho gay people will not be excluded). this is more like =
a regular party cruise. and if budweiser can have a cruise that includes fr=
ee beer for a whole week then im sure we can do a rave cruise with no probl=
em. drunk people are way more likely to "fall" off the boat than people on =
designer drugs. thats definately not an obstacle for this thing. i need ide=
as on what to add to this thing not ideas on why we cant do it. we can do i=
t. its already been worked out as far as that goes.

anticipation is actually seen as you witness a DJ take a platter off and pu=

I've been out to plenty of mp3j clubs at this point and all I can say is th=

Times do change however and they will continue to change.=A0 Some changes I=

Some good points here about DJing as a physical act.  But I think with some thought this can be added back into the experience even if the source media is digital.  

And then again there have always been fakers...

I remember seeing Oakenfold at Ultra in 2001 on the main stage and he was totally faking it as he was obviously spilling champagne on the record he was supposedly playing with no effect on the mix.  It was likely just a prerecorded DAT he was playing back in those days and he pulled shit out of his crate to make it look like he was mixing.  Sort of the DJ equivalent of lip sync-ing...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] laptops replacing decks

Part of the problem is seeing a DJ has become the primary reason to go 
to an event for many people. This is when DJ's become icons, and then we 
make it impossible for them to live up to it.

DJ's were better back when people went to parties to party and to make 
friends, while dancing to hypnotic tunes. Dance music gave way to cool 
music. Many people have forgotten that there is a difference in playing 
music to dance to progressively, versus playing music that sounds 
awesome when driving your car blasting the ipod.

I totally agree with the ADD DJ phenomenon. I miss 3 hour sets, I miss 
progressively working with the dancers. Now you see parties with HHC 
back-to-back with fucking trance, and buildup/breakdowns every 30 
seconds. How can I dance to that?

The DJ's are better when they work with the party, instead of being some 
icon that represents the party itself.

I really have no words.

going to take anything a mean spirited sum-bitch, George Busch boot licking,
Sarah Palin adoring, young, brown shirt conservative like you has to say
about public civility seriously.

Except maybe to laugh at a simple backwards clown like you.

Correct if I'm wrong, but there are a lot of really nice people that used to
be on this list because of nasty ass fuck heads, such as yourself, (who
think of themselves as PLURtastic ravers), these very  got fed up with your
shit and left because they didn't want to get anywhere near your human
toxicity. You're Radioactive Man in human skin.

Do you blame them?

You drove these ppl off in droves.

Thanks a BUNCH

Go back and read some of your old posts, i have, there are some real gems in
their, that I'm going to spare ppl here from having to read again because I
don't like to fling your poo back at you.

I'm not a monkey, so I don't do that sort of thing like you do.

Traffic on this list has dropped like a brick and I hang that shit squarely
on your shoulders.

Have a GREAT Day, and say hi to Dave 4 me.

That'd be GRATE, and thanks for polluting my scene the way you have these
last several years.

It's people like you that made me GLAD that I moved away to Germany where
people still practise basic human decency, and it's ppl like you that will
make sure that I will NEVER return to the SLUM of country the people you
support politically have turned it into to.

You live in a GHETTO and the sad thing is you think it's Atherton or
Woodside.

i PITY you.

You've misunderstood me- I really do want to know how to get to the  
state where the witnessing of a car breaking down gives me the feeling  
of "God and the Universe is totally beaming down on me now"- I'm not a  
happy man and if I was capable of such things it would be like I was  
almost blissfully retarded!

If you've figured that out you're a very special man and you owe it to  
humanity to share this wealth, and I want to know your secret!

Ok, I hear you on that for real.  I think Serrano is a good compromise 
as I do think digital does have it's virtues.  But I also think 
something and a connection is lost.  An opportunity to communicate.  
Because the physicality of the DJ is as much a part of the show as the 
music.  Little things matter, IMO.

LOL!
> I remember seeing Oakenfold at Ultra in 2001 on the main stage and he was totally faking it as he was obviously spilling champagne on the record he was supposedly playing with no effect on the mix.  It was likely just a prerecorded DAT he was playing back in those days and he pulled shit out of his crate to make it look like he was mixing.  Sort of the DJ equivalent of lip sync-ing...
>   
We reach!  Another issue with digital, it CAN be faked.  You ain't 
faking with no vinyl ladies and gents.  Either you come off or step 
off.  But I do think that with the caliber of talent out there, people 
are playing great mp3j sets.  Good music, although it lacks sonically to 
me, and people do dance, which is good.  No they ain't losing thier 
heads, thier dancing and dancing is the point.  I can see that side of 
it too.

My prejudice is toward 1200's.  That is unlikely to change anytime 
soon.  At least vinyl sales are starting to pick-up, but it might just 
be the last few horses before the glue factory shuts down.

Yeah, but you're not titty-twisting.  You're not "working" it 
physically.  There is a lack of force and momentum and push to the music 
that comes from those tiny physical efforts - which ave energy by the 
way.  A hard disk spinning at a constant rate is not analog - nothing is 
constant in those great sets.  You have physical energy converted to an 
analog wave and sent through massive analog speakers.  That is some pure 
shit, no quant.  A bottom that lasts forever, low-end feedback, and all 
kinds of cool stuff you can really only get with vinyl and a set of 
turntables.

That is a Digital Disc Jockey and that is the best I can do, a DDJ.  I 
mean if you're embracing the technology, might as well call it what it 
is, and peeps should take no offense.  When Jazz mutated they called it 
fusion, etc.  Why not just rock your 0's and 1's flag and get your 
groove on.  But that is not DJing in the classic sense of the word.  
There was no DJ before there we records.  Records therefore define a DJ, 
since the "D" stands for disk.

But you're still not jocking discs, you're jocking mp3's or AIFF or 
whatever - they ain't disks, so saying your have a disc involved is a 
stretch, especially since you can now use iPods etc to mix and come up 
with sets.  You are no longer bound to a disc, but you are playing 
mp3's.  MP3J is probably the most appropriate for those with pride in 
this craft.  If I was "spinning" 100% digital, this is what I would call 
myself for sure.

Sheeit my turntables are in the corner gathering some dust.  My old Rane 
is in the garage, needs a repair, and I download most of my music at 
this point.  Very rarely I gone out and supported the vinyl movement in 
the last oh 4 years?  So I'm not fronting.  I am a victim of the 
seduction of digital, which is strong. My studio is 100% digital up to 
the analog ins/outs.  My Mac is the center of my music universe.  So I 
feel it.  But I'll get the 1200's going for the kiddies.  I got like 
2000 records and stuff to share, so it wont be long.  Then they'll want 
the latest shit.  If they need the old school crap they'll borrow it 
from dad.

Gotta love living,
John

Oh sure, be GLAD to, Natey, Nate.

But before I do, do you ever communicate in a way that is not snide,
sneering and snively?

Just curious, because I've never seen you be anything but that here like yo=
u
just did.

GREAT way to win friends and influence people, palsie walsie.

Every time I see this cuntface douche prick on the TV I think of you:
http://silencedmajority.blogs.com/silenced_majority_portal/2009/03/fox-make=
s-paranoid-homoerotic-jokes-about-the-canadian-military.html

Now then, on to my answer.

My =C3=9Cber hot German GF, she of The Rack Of God, (they're REAL and they =
are
SPECTACULAR!!!), who obviously ADORES me, as seen here,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DoAnPgpDERJw has spent her entire past care=
er
working elder care and got really burned out on it and, due to the nature o=
f
her work, NEVER so much as put her hand on a keyboard and mouse in her
ENTIRE ADULT LIFE until I showed up in her life after not seeing her for
over 25 years and dumped a pile of computing gear on her and told her to ge=
t
busy with IT AND LEARN IT RIGHT QUICK.

She is a COMPLETE n00b like you wouldn't believe, and since we're launching
a business together I've spent the last few weeks bringing her up to speed
so that we can work together smoovely.

Instead of making shit borings 4 her with Excell Spread sheets, WORD,
powrpointy, news sites, all that crap, I got her on the YouTubes, The
YouPorns, LOLCats, Fark, all that shit and as of right now we've become
major students of the FAIL meme which sweeping the internets like America's
latest dance sensation.

This has proven to be a perfect approach, in less than 3 short weeks she ha=
s
gone from asking 100+ really fucking stupid and retarded questions a day to
practically none.

I'm quite PROUD of her for making such AMAZING PROGRESS in such a short
time.

I'm a photographer/videographer/author and one of the projects I'm working
right now on is taking pics of EU type bikes, (EVERYBODY here, of ALL
classes rides bikes and there is no social stigma attached to it like there
is in the USA USA USA), and their automobiles.

See, over here gasoline is a* LOT more expensive* than it is in the USA,
been hovering at teh *$10 a gallon mark for the better part of a decade *no=
w,
but unlike in the USA *nobody whines *about the price.

For a *lot *of good reasons.

For one a lot of that is tax money that goes to support THE SOCIALIST
INFRASTRUCTURE here that DOES NOT EXIST IN THE USA and they KNOW thatz they
are getting a GREAT return on their tax money, since they don't chuck their
poorer citizens to THE WOLVES like we *BARBARIC* Americans are so fond of
doing.

The other is is that nobody complains about these highly insane gas prices
because most people don't drive HUMMERS that burn a hole in their WALLETS,
but these *highly FUEL EFFICIENT tiny cars.
*
Instead of there being one sub compact for every 10 HUMMERS like we have in
the States with those Stupid Ugly Vehicles Madison Avenue, Ford, GM and
Exxon suckered Americans who couldn't afford these cars and the gas to fill
them with.

Here in the EU its the EXACT OPPOSITE.

For *every ten cars* like the one seen in this clip there is *only ONE
RETARDMOBILE* on the streets here.

So when I see a car like the one in the clip on the street my instant refle=
x
is to start taking pics, so the *80% of ALL AMERICANS* 4 out 5 of us, who d=
o
*not* have Passports and NEVER WILL and *WILL NEVER LEAVE THE USA *can see
that there is another way of preserving the little bit of money that they
have left and MAYBE LEARN SOMETHING that will help them protect themselves
from these *PREDATORIAL* gas, car and adverttising companies.

Poor guy, as soon as my finger snapped the first pic he stalled and FAILed.

I had NO IDEA that was going to happen.

But since FAIL is now the hottest ticket in town I wasn't about to let this
go w/out getting it on tape.

Sorry, Charlie.

Knowing what I have seen of you on here NATE TH=C3=88 GREAT you woulda done=
 the
same damn thing but the DIFFERENCE BETWEEN you and me is that YOU WOULD NOT
HAVE TRIED TO ENGAGE with this person.

Don't know if you iunderstand German but I did try to get him to talk with
me by telling him he has a pretty car, (not as pretty as this Made In
America Tesla 100% ELECTRIC Roadster that Germans can afford but Americans
can't <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DXQyBHnpf5Cw>) but fuck like I said =
on
the clip if it were me in that situation I would prolly not stick around
either.

I've had at least a half a dozen POS cars that I constantly had to roll
start, so I knew where the guy was coming from.

I've never seen you show anyone on here any empathy, ever, not once.

Instead you take a PERVERSE GLEE in other peoples misfortunes.

Disgusting.

So, like, whatever.

One last thing before I finish.

I spent a lot of time here visiting family when I was a kid and a teen and
back in that time *EVERYBODY HERE LOVED AMERICA.

EVERYONE IN EUROPE BACK THEN WANTED TO BE US.*

Worshipped us like my GF does me now.

But this Busch SHITHEAD President that you have come on here with your full
throated sucking of his cock and done your Bukkake Ciorcle jerk on Busch
with your friends?

For YEARS and YEARS?

THAT President Busch?

Let me tell you about that.

I came here last November the day after the election and if John McCain had
won instead of PRESIDENT OBAMA these people would HAVE THROWN ROCKS AT ME.

George Busch SINGLEHANDEDLY destroyed over 50 Years worth of LOVE AND
GOODWIIL TOWARDS AMERICA.

Gone.

*YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BAD THAT LOSS OF INTERNATIONAL GOODWILL IS FOR
AMERIKA.
*
None.

So, you can throw your little meaningless opinions around all you want, but
since what you have had to say has time over time proven to be UTTERLY
RETARDED I will consider the fucking source.

Enjoy your cocksucking evening and have a good night.

First, when did DJs ever have musical skills?
Ok seriously tho, if you are still doing the beatmatching I don't see why
it
matters if you do it on plain vinyl, cd decks, or a digital vinyl
solution.
  The only time I call foul is if you use software to do the beatmatching
for
you.  Also, beatmatching with the bpm detect function on new gear is
borderline ;)

However, there is one case where I think having software align all the
beats
for you is okay, and that is if you are doing a reasonably complex live PA
with something like Ableton.  If you have more then three tracks playing
at
once, I personally think its acceptable to have software help.

Just my $0.02

matters if you do it on plain vinyl, cd decks, or a digital vinyl
solution.
  The only time I call foul is if you use software to do the beatmatching
for
you.  Also, beatmatching with the bpm detect function on new gear is
borderline ;)

However, there is one case where I think having software align all the
beats
for you is okay, and that is if you are doing a reasonably complex live PA
with something like Ableton.  If you have more then three tracks playing
at
once, I personally think its acceptable to have software help.

Just my $0.02

  Ok, I hear you on that for real.  I think Serrano is a good compromise as I do think digital does have it's virtues.  But I also think something and a connection is lost.  An opportunity to communicate.  Because the physicality of the DJ is as much a part of the show as the music.  Little things matter, IMO.


And then again there have always been fakers...
  
LOL!

I remember seeing Oakenfold at Ultra in 2001 on the main stage and he was totally faking it as he was obviously spilling champagne on the record he was supposedly playing with no effect on the mix.  It was likely just a prerecorded DAT he was playing back in those days and he pulled shit out of his crate to make it look like he was mixing.  Sort of the DJ equivalent of lip sync-ing...
  We reach!  Another issue with digital, it CAN be faked.  You ain't faking with no vinyl ladies and gents.  Either you come off or step off.  But I do think that with the caliber of talent out there, people are playing great mp3j sets.  Good music, although it lacks sonically to me, and people do dance, which is good.  No they ain't losing thier heads, thier dancing and dancing is the point.  I can see that side of it too.

My prejudice is toward 1200's.  That is unlikely to change anytime soon.  At least vinyl sales are starting to pick-up, but it might just be the last few horses before the glue factory shuts down.

I'm with you Mike on the wording.

It is a serious stretch to call what is happening now with computers and the DJ, real dj'ing.  From either an etymological point of view, from a physical point of view or from a practical point of view.  I know many new jacks love this technology, and the argument can be made that it does not replace skill, to some degree.

But there is skill in being in a dark club, digging through heavy crate of records, trying to read a label, slapping it down on a deck, getting the pitch just right, and coming in at the right point.  That physical activity , I think, is what the crowd unconsciously grooves to, because the act of anticipation is actually seen as you witness a DJ take a platter off and put one one.  You know something is coming.  Now?  Not so much.

I've been out to plenty of mp3j clubs at this point and all I can say is that the energy and the levels need Viagra. I know many here will claim to rock the house, yeah yeah yeah, but I am not convinced until I see them rock the vinyl with skills and results.

Times do change however and they will continue to change.  Some changes I will like, others I will abhor, such is life.

While I understand the physical problems with vinyl, I am the kind of guy who would never buy a kindle over a real bonafide book.

Whoa dude.  Please calm the fuck down.

Nate's a top-notch guy - one of two people I'd call if I needed to get bail=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] re: random


Seriously.  I've given up a lot of decent paying DJ gigs because I was sick to death of stupid ultralounges and their douchetard bottle service culture.  Honestly, I have more coolness in my pinky finger than any rich fuck could possibly buy by paying 3000x market price for a bottle of shitty-tasting diluted grain alcohol (vodka, not a fan) and listening to badly mixed prog house for a few hours, in search of some fake-lesbo clubchickies to have half-asleep nookie with.  Luckily, SF has plenty of down and dirty places that don't play into such nonsense, and even a few posher places that still don't make you feel like a jerk for ordering a $5 beer.

Wow, that sounded a lot more riled up than it was intended to sound... haha

Woot,

 As tempting as it is to vent and vomit on here, if you're going to do so, please put a "NRR" (Not Rave Related) in front of your post so it is filtered out by people not interested in reading unrelated tangents.

Thanks.

Also, try smiling. You seem grumpy. Everything is as it should be. :)

 No problem. I knew you were new on the list, so thought I would give you a heads up.

As an original 100% Floridian born and raised in Miami, Florida all I 
can say for the pikers from up north, the deep south or the west who 
think they can come into Miami and sample her goods, I let out a hearty 
L O L!

Welcome to my home city, sorta.  Now if you're smart you'll get the hell 
outta there before something bad really happens.  You just got ganked 
that is all.  And if you're in South Beach, take solace, it isn't 
Miami.  LOL!  Miami is far worse, especially for the uninitiated.  LOL.  
I can't stop laughing....now I have to call my brother in Miami to relay 
this story.  More laughs in store!

Good luck, get home quick.

-John

P.S.  I go back there as little as possible.

How the fuck did your ass get taken for 12k?  DOOD!  Get out of there, 
you need to cut your losses and just come home.

For all others who dare go to my home state or go to my home town or in 
the Miami area, you need to check with me FIRST.  In the least I can get 
you a Miami pass which might have avoided such stuff. ;)

Sorry to hear they took you man, but really, go home quickly.

No need to freaking smile about that.

Uh,

Small claims court only goes to amounts of $5000 or less.  Anything 
larger than that is considered larceny and is handled in  civil and 
criminal courts.

And if you didn't get the chicks real name, you're screwed.  No recourse.

Subject: [sfraves] [NRR]  How not to get jacked in Miami or Miami Beach

Rule #1 know the truth -
Miami is the fraud capital of the world, period.  It used to be the 
murder capital of the world, but things have calmed down.  If you need a 
credit card, stolen goods, cars or you simply want to run a confidence 
scam Miami is your place.

Oh and don't bother with the cops.  They are corrupt.

Rule #2 money rules -
Fuck LA, Hollywood and Wall Street, they got nothing on Miami where you 
can obtain anything for a decent price.  And I do mean anything.  The 
legends of Tijuana do not compare to the truth of Miami.

Rule#3 foreigners suck in Miami -
Ever since they stopped killing German and Euro tourists we've seen an 
increase in the numbers of the Euro herd taking over South beach and 
Miami.  Be careful, once they come to Miami, they get infected with the 
Miami virus and what was a nice little Euro chick becomes a hard core 
scammer.  It is also a top recruiting ground for porn people, and they 
are by definition sketchy oftentimes.

My single bit of advice is this, and I am from there.  If you're 
traveling to Miami or South Beach you had better know a native.  Before 
I go I set all of my shit up ahead of time, I know which clubs I'll be 
going to , make sure my brothers have obtained everything I need for a 
good time, and I am usually with or part of a larger "posse" of, er 
natives who are about business.  The surest way not to get ganked in 
Miami is for there to be immediate and severe consequences for even 
trying - it would have been a different outcome had you been 
"introduced" through a trusted native channel.  You might be out $200 
but not much more than that, if you get my drift.  If you got all that 
set up, you should have a pretty good time.  That place is not for 
someone not connected to the city in some way shape or form.

Damn, what a place.

-John

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: women in miami


Ok, I've been getting a lot of grief on this.  I know that this is a criminal offence.  My suggestion was just that small claims is an easy and low risk way to get SOME of your money back.  Small claims in California goes to $7500 BTW but as I said I don't know about Florida.

I have actually done this under somewhat different circumstances. I recovered the money that was stolen from me, in that case by a former employee.  And you can file a small claim suit for less than the total amount lost or stolen, you just give up the right to collect any remaining amount.  At least that's how I understood it at the time.

Good luck getting police attention for a theft of this sort.  What they will do is take a report from you and file it.  What they won't do is hunt down the perp and bring them to "justice" or get any of your money back.  That is unless this is part of a larger set of crimes or they are looking for this person for other reasons.

Peter

Uh,

Small claims court only goes to amounts of $5000 or less.  Anything 
larger than that is considered larceny and is handled in  civil and 
criminal courts.

And if you didn't get the chicks real name, you're screwed.  No recourse.

 you see scholls surrounded by 15 foot fences topped with razor wire

Rule #1 know the truth -
Miami is the fraud capital of the world, period.=A0 It used to be the murde=
r capital of the world, but things have calmed down.=A0 If you need a credi=
t card, stolen goods, cars or you simply want to run a confidence scam Miam=
i is your place.

Oh and don't bother with the cops.=A0 They are corrupt.

Rule #2 money rules -
Fuck LA, Hollywood and Wall Street, they got nothing on Miami where you can=
 obtain anything for a decent price.=A0 And I do mean anything.=A0 The lege=
nds of Tijuana do not compare to the truth of Miami.

Rule#3 foreigners suck in Miami -
Ever since they stopped killing German and Euro tourists we've seen an incr=
ease in the numbers of the Euro herd taking over South beach and Miami.=A0 =
Be careful, once they come to Miami, they get infected with the Miami virus=
 and what was a nice little Euro chick becomes a hard core scammer.=A0 It i=
s also a top recruiting ground for porn people, and they are by definition =
sketchy oftentimes.

My single bit of advice is this, and I am from there.=A0 If you're travelin=
g to Miami or South Beach you had better know a native.=A0 Before I go I se=
t all of my shit up ahead of time, I know which clubs I'll be going to , ma=
ke sure my brothers have obtained everything I need for a good time, and I =
am usually with or part of a larger "posse" of, er natives who are about bu=
siness.=A0 The surest way not to get ganked in Miami is for there to be imm=
ediate and severe consequences for even trying - it would have been a diffe=
rent outcome had you been "introduced" through a trusted native channel.=A0=
 You might be out $200 but not much more than that, if you get my drift.=A0=
 If you got all that set up, you should have a pretty good time.=A0 That pl=
ace is not for someone not connected to the city in some way shape or form.

Damn, what a place.

Ok, I've been getting a lot of grief on this.=A0 I know that this is a crim=
inal offence.=A0 My suggestion was just that small claims is an easy and lo=
w risk way to get SOME of your money back.=A0 Small claims in California go=
es to $7500 BTW but as I said I don't know about Florida.

I have actually done this under somewhat different circumstances. I recover=
ed the money that was stolen from me, in that case by a former employee.=A0=
 And you can file a small claim suit for less than the total amount lost or=
 stolen, you just give up the right to collect any remaining amount.=A0 At =
least that's how I understood it at the time.

Good luck getting police attention for a theft of this sort.=A0 What they w=
ill do is take a report from you and file it.=A0 What they won't do is hunt=
 down the perp and bring them to "justice" or get any of your money back.=
=A0 That is unless this is part of a larger set of crimes or they are looki=
ng for this person for other reasons.

Brother, hate to say this, but you sound like you're from Miami! LOL!

As for the north etc. being tough etc. who cares, there are a bunch of=20
shithole places in the united states and Miami is one of them.  And that =

what makes  it so dangerous is that it is a bunch of mercs out there out =

for self.  That is why much of what you say is true, other parts, well=20
not so true.  You been there 4 years , are ex-military so tough has a=20
different value for you.  For regular everyday folks, you would not wish =

them to be in overtown for instance.

Oh, Miami already went through that stage, and if you go through Liberty =

city, police patrol the campus too.

Not convinced about Baltimore, Chicago or any other places as they seem=20
pretty tame to me sans Detroit, but YMMV.

Sorry to hear about the ho taking your cash, and sorry about my small=20
bit of laughter at this.  The good thing is you know what to do so it=20
will probably not happen again.

But then again remember this "you can't trust a big butt and a smile",=20
and you'll be fine.

Oh and kudos on your service to our country.  Now I am pissed because=20
she ripped off a vet.  She'll get hers.  Just make sure you go out there =

and get yours.

Good luck!

Oh Mike, don't get me wrong I *am* one of those fools.  But just like 
every other fool who thinks "DC" or "NYC" or Chicago, etc., we all think 
we come from the baddest part of the planet.  Until you go to a bona 
fide 3rd world country and you see that even at it's worst the U.S.  is 
overall punkified and full of blowhards.   There is no ghetto in the US 
that compares to a Brasilian or Indian slum.  Nobody here would survive 
Sadr City or instance. We just are well armed, that's all!

Dude, I would be furious if I were you.  Your anger is warranted, but it 
is good you're moving past it so quickly.

Yeah the fucked up thing about Miami is that I hear these stories all 
the time and just wonder wtf?  And I ask myself "Do people still live 
there?  Most of the mugs I grew up with in Miami got the fuck out if 
they were smart.  The dumb ones, they are dead or in jail.

It's not a hard city per se anymore, it is just scummy and scammy at 
this point.  Everyone is so well armed, tough has got nothing to do with 
it.  But you have to be wiley to live there now, so it is more about 
brains and wit than brawn - everyone is on he take, everyone.  But I'm 
preaching to the choir, you know wassup.

Ok man, back to it.  Nice meeting you, and when I am in Mia soon enough 
you and I should link up.

-John

going to see YUKSEK TONIGHT!!, my friend - and a fellow lurker ;-)
I was hooked for a while on the Fabric Podcast of his set from <http://getweird.wordpress.com/2008/11/14/yuksek-fabric/> and am super excited to see him in person!! YAY.
Now if someone could get me a track list to this set that would be AWESOME! ok ok how about the first song only?? anyone?

It is also a top recruiting ground for porn people, and they are by definition sketchy oftentimes.

Before I go I set all of my shit up ahead of time, I know which clubs I'll be going to , make sure my brothers have obtained everything I need for a good time, and I am usually with or part of a larger "posse" of, er natives who are about business.  The surest way not to get ganked in Miami is for there to be immediate and severe consequences for even trying - it would have been a different outcome had you been "introduced" through a trusted native channel.  You might be out $200 but not much more than that, if you get my drift.  If you got all that set up, you should have a pretty good time.  That place is not for someone not connected to the city in some way shape or form.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: women in miami


This thread really sums up for me the reason why I stopped going to WMC a few years ago.  The gigs were fun and the networking was pretty helpful, but in that environment of exhorbitant, stupid cost of living/partying, a culture of oafish dumbshits throughout the nightlife sphere, and a cavalcade of hot-but-obviously-no-fun women- yuck.  Everyone seemed to be out to prove something.  
 
..and that's south beach!  I can't even imagine how fucked Miami proper is.

"Girls are hot, wearing less than bikinis, rock man lovers, driving Lamborghinis" indeed.

Now, Amsterdam Dance Event?  That I can get with. ;)

Sorry, to me a DJ getting jacked by some Euro hooker is RR.

YMMV,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: RG: bSP: YUKSEK - se soir!!!!


LOL - appreciate the kind protective words - but I have Lurked long enough not to flash to the lists drama and no you won't drag me into "vinyl or digital... dead horse debate" - I DJ both vinyl and cd's and play whatever I can get my hands on! 
I  am Mojo aka Ofer. I live in SF and have been raving for many years beginning my early introduction into the scene in London (where I spent  5+ yrs) continuing to SF, a couple of years in NYC and back to SF for a total of 10+ years in the US.
I have two incredible little girls who like to "Shake their Coconuts" to Jr. Senior from the DFA remixes. My daughters have already frequented Love Fest, How Weird, Orgeon Country fair- amongst many other SF parades -being 2yrs and 5 yrs - kind of tough getting into the clubs and UG's yet ;-) but dancing is big at home and I hope it remains a big escape/outlet for them for the rest of their lives!!
I like many different styles of music and drift to extremes often - always trying to satisfy my aural pleasure - music and sound have no limits!
 
I have enjoyed these lists for a while now. I hope they continue to survive and one day some of the great people who left will return - I miss some of the more quality postings but have learned to ignore the crapy ones very easily!!
I will gladly bring back a Yuksek review to the list and am always glad to meet new people and make new friends here in SF or really anywhere!

Out of the lurking closet - oh I feel so exposed :-}
Mojo

ok one correction. the women right now are both hot AND fun. last night i got laid by two very beautiful european chicks just because i was promoting for ultra and they were VERY fun. =) tho most of the people here are real ravcers man. they come from all over the world for ultra. just like people come from all over the world to go to creamfields and global gathering. ultra is what put the u.s. on the map for huge world parties.

This thread really sums up for me the reason why I stopped going to WMC a few years ago.  The gigs were fun and the networking was pretty helpful, but in that environment of exhorbitant, stupid cost of living/partying, a culture of oafish dumbshits throughout the nightlife sphere, and a cavalcade of hot-but-obviously-no-fun women- yuck.  Everyone seemed to be out to prove something.  

..and that's south beach!  I can't even imagine how fucked Miami proper is.

"Girls are hot, wearing less than bikinis, rock man lovers, driving Lamborghinis" indeed.

Now, Amsterdam Dance Event?  That I can get with. ;)

Sorry, to me a DJ getting jacked by some Euro hooker is RR.

YMMV,

I last went to Ultra in 2001...

Sasson (sp?) was running the event largely although some local guy Bruce was also involved.  Mike Manion was running the main stage.  I was hanging out there most of the time, and this is where I got to witness the infamous Paul Oakenfold champagne incident.

ok one correction. the women right now are both hot AND fun. last night i got laid by two very beautiful european chicks just because i was promoting for ultra and they were VERY fun. =) tho most of the people here are real ravcers man. they come from all over the world for ultra. just like people come from all over the world to go to creamfields and global gathering. ultra is what put the u.s. on the map for huge world parties.

This thread really sums up for me the reason why I stopped going to WMC a few years ago.  The gigs were fun and the networking was pretty helpful, but in that environment of exhorbitant, stupid cost of living/partying, a culture of oafish dumbshits throughout the nightlife sphere, and a cavalcade of hot-but-obviously-no-fun women- yuck.  Everyone seemed to be out to prove something.  

..and that's south beach!  I can't even imagine how fucked Miami proper is.

"Girls are hot, wearing less than bikinis, rock man lovers, driving Lamborghinis" indeed.

Now, Amsterdam Dance Event?  That I can get with. ;)

Sorry, to me a DJ getting jacked by some Euro hooker is RR.

As tempting as it is to vent and vomit on here, if you're going to do so,
please put a "NRR" (Not Rave Related) in front of your post so it is
filtered
out by people not interested in reading unrelated tangents.

Thanks.

Also, try smiling. You seem grumpy. Everything is as it should be. :)

There's a party, "Techno Sluts", promoted on the front page of  http://www.nubreaks.com/  which looks pretty interesting and will also be broadcast on the Internets...

Check out the decor, list of performers, etc.  plus we all know you love techno sluts.

Video + Chat for those virtually present.

Tonight!

Peter

PS There's also a live stream from WMC on Shoutcast http://91.121.121.139:9004

Subject: [sfraves] Chicago vs. Prohibition Underground


No trying to start any drama, however I just saw that Swag and the "Conniseur's Collective" are throwing a party titled "Chicago" that seems to be sort of a PU clone with "20s mobster attire" suggested.  Ok this could be taken as a complement, but it seems a little cheesy to me so soon after PU went off so well.  They even have a DJ named "Simple Green" from the Strategik crew instead of PU's "Forest Green".  

Coincidence, homage, or rip off, you be the judge...

I am friends with one of the CC organizers, and the party name came up because they're raising money to do a big party in Chicago with some of his friends- and they sort of took that concept and ran with it.

They also booked me for it, and subsequently flaked on me, so, who knows.

I'd agree, weak.  But there's no lack of weakness out there. ;)

Why kiss and tell when you can fuck and yell?

As for Ultra, I rest my case at exhibit a:

As you can see from the website, they would not allow me to bring in my 
fifth of Bushmills, obviously making them douchebags.

Huh?

The theme may be similar, but nobody has a copyright to historically-themed parties.  Simple Greene has been around for awhile, and is a real nice guy.

Totally different styles of music, too.

if only tipper was there to help out the prodigy's stage...

"He, and likeminded people from his label Fuel Records, have also engaged in stunts like emptying a swimming pool, covering it with an acoustic canopy and enjoying the bass, or drowning out The Prodigy on the main stage of the V Festival with their car sound systems parked several miles away."

possible rave dress code: swim fins, snorkle, ski goggles, bermuda 
shorts, nipple clamps, van gogh's starry night umbrella, bucket of 
glitter, life size plastic sockeye salmon, and your own personal 
sprinkler system filled with diluted psychoactives..

maybe that's just what i'd like to see, call me crazy, but hanging out 
with you in that outfit would be a party unto itself. especially if you 
get a pioneer cdj system, mackie srm450s, generator, a shopping cart and 
invade an ATM kiosk.

lol. ok i'm in.

respect,
sean.

possible rave dress code: swim fins, snorkle, ski goggles, bermuda shorts, nipple clamps, van gogh's starry night umbrella, bucket of glitter, life size plastic sockeye salmon, and your own personal sprinkler system filled with diluted psychoactives..

maybe that's just what i'd like to see, call me crazy, but hanging out with you in that outfit would be a party unto itself. especially if you get a pioneer cdj system, mackie srm450s, generator, a shopping cart and invade an ATM kiosk.

lol. ok i'm in.

respect,
sean.

ACID CIRCUS (DROID| LA)
SNOEK (Good Bad Guy | Faktion | SF)
visuals by HEROIC ROBOT ( http://www.heroicrobot.com/ )
live webcast via DEFSF:Radio Integrated ( http://radio.defsf.com:1200/ )


YES! That's correct, we've got ACID CIRCUS coming up THIS FRIDAY.  Do
we really need to speak to Droid Behavior's role in LA Techno, or how
these guys are fixtures at DEMF?  Well fine: Acid Circus has long
established themselves along with creative parner Drumcell in the
creation of some of the best warehouse, desert and essentially any
location they've chosen to play at, in and around Los Angeles, and are
well known throughout the US and elsewhere.  THIS FRIDAY, the preparty
starts with Droid residents Subversive and DeanpauL at Killswitch
Happy Hour at Underground SF, and then moves to Faktion at Anu to
finish the night!

////////////////

Half of the founders of Droid Behavior and Droid Recordings, ACID CIRCUS
is comprised of brothers Vidal and Vangelis Vargas.  No strangers to
tweaking and freqing everything within ear shot, over the last 5 years
the members of acid circus have constantly displayed the art of techno
live performance. Dropping tracks, remixes, samples, mashups, left
hooks, and techno grime in and out of the mix has become an ultimate
trip in pure crowd reaction at LA undergrounds.
http://www.myspace.com/acidcircus

Having played in locales as diverse as the Netherlands and the Middle East,
SNOEK, aka That Fucking Guy/Meekrob heads up his own parties yet remains
humble and works tirelessly to further the local techno scene any way he can.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dress codes for parties in sf

spaz had their fuck parade float going the opposite way during love 
parade doing this exact thing when we DEF was doing this first SF love 
parade. think the psytrance dj spook had the shopping cart idea from way 
back but i'm sure its been done many times over from all over the world.

down with this for any occasion. though we need to convert the shopping 
cart to either a hoverround chair or a set of segways with a remote 
control device and a traktor dj set up. lol. maybe we can 'import tune' 
it as well and add hydrolix.

every 1st Saturday at The Endup



featuring from Chile:


PIER BUCCI - LIVE

(Crosstown Rebels . Cadenza . Cynosure . Contexterrior)
(Wagon Repair . Vendetta . BPitch Control . Cocoon)

Originally capturing the international spotlight alongside fellow
Chilean artists Ricardo Villalobos and Luciano, Pier Bucci
has over the last decade become one of the most respected
names in modern techno, due in part to tracks like 2007's
monster hit, "Hay Consuelo". His unique live performance,
which fuses Latin rhythms and elegant melodies with a
German sense of efficiency and dancefloor-friendly beats,
has landed him slots at top clubs across the globe, as well
as appearances at most major festivals including Sonar,
MUTEK, and DEMF.



and from Toronto via Berlin:


JEREMY P. CAULFIELD

(Dumb-Unit . Trapez . WMF Records)
(Ware . Num . Alphahouse . Adjunct)

As a DJ of 15 years and an integral figure in the rise of
the Toronto techno scene, Jeremy P. Caulfield is a rare
example of an artist who can deftly combine experience,
skill, and forward-thinking ideas in style. In addition to
running the acclaimed "neuro-minimal" label Dumb-Unit,
these days Jeremy plays the world's best clubs and festivals
nearly every weekend, thanks to his tricked-out, re-edit
heavy sets which have established him as one of North
America's finest DJs.

PIER BUCCI

Pier Bucci is on a quest to create his own vision of complex
atmospheric rhythms. Much has been written about the recent emergence
of Chile as an unexpected source of cutting edge electronica. Pier,
alongside fellow countrymen and women are producing some of the finest
and most original electronic music at the moment.

Pier's own take on techno uses classic Latin rhythms and vocals, with
his love of abstract electronics, and Sheffield bleeps, combining this
with his haunting Andean melodies, whilst colorful characters zip
through his music, makes a lively collage of influences, underpinned
by solid dancefloor beats.

A brief history of the last ten years show's Pier to be very busy.
>From the first releases in the late 90's on Dandy Jack's Ruta 5
Austral compilation, four acclaimed e.p.'s and a highly acclaimed
album for Crosstown Rebels. The fruits of his collaborations with
Luciano, bore the Monne Automnne [Lo-Fi Stereo, Germany] and
Lucien-n-Luciano album projects for labels such as Peacefrog and
Cadenza, Skipsapien together with Daniel Nieto [u-cover, Belgium;
Mutek Rec, Canada], Mambotur with Argenis Brito [Multicolor, Germany],
Bucci/Pink Elln together with Tobias Freund [Cynosure Records, Canada]
and works with his brother Andres as Bucci [WMF Rec, Berlin; Cynosure
Records, Canada] have been equally well received.

Last year we had releases on Wagon Repair, Cocoon, Cynosure and
remixes for BPitch Control. The single of Hay Consuelo and the Chilo=E9
e.p. for the Rebels.

In 2008 Pier has and the soon to be released album collaboration with
Max Loderbauer and Argenis Brito as Maluco on Karaoke Kalk and further
Pier Bucci e.p.'s are to follow in this year.

After all this studio time and experience, it's easy to understand why
Pier's live set is known as one the best around. His explosive
combination of Latin & European influences, dynamically delivered, is
always guaranteed dancefloor entertainment.

JEREMY P. CAULFIELD

At a time when so much techno feels like endless variations on a
played-out theme, it=92s heartening to know that there are still a
handful of artists, labels and DJs who can combine experience, skill
and forward-looking ideals in style. Step forward Jeremy P. Caulfield,
who amply ticks all of the above boxes.

As proprietor of leading neuro-minimal imprint Dumb-Unit, DJ of
widely-acclaimed repute, and occasional producer of stripped-back,
ominous dancefloor bombs, Jeremy has emerged from his early days on
the Canadian techno circuit to become a leading light of today=92s
underground club scene. Using his fifteen years of DJing experience as
a springboard, Jeremy has utilised Dumb-Unit as a pivotal platform for
the blossoming careers of artists including Butane, Lee Curtiss, Sweet
N=92 Candy and Seph, loosely defining a hinterland micro-scene of murky,
intricate sounds that play with the darkest recesses of the mind while
remaining firmly attached the propulsive drive of the dance-floor.

It=92s an ambiguous definition best articulated by his series of
Detached:Works mix tapes and CDs, which over the course of three
volumes and 10 years neatly plots Jeremy=92s evolution from sparky
underground enthusiast to undisputed connoisseur of finely-tuned
contemporary techno. From early residencies at Toronto=92s legendary
Blue and Fukhouse parties (where he knocked around with like-minded
local jocks Adam Marshall, Ian Guthrie and Jeff Milligan, while
playing alongside techno deities like Richie Hawtin, Derrick May and
Jeff Mills), Jeremy=92s established himself as one of North America=92s
finest DJs. In 2008 alone, alongside his residency at Watergate, (in
his adopted home of Berlin) Jeremy has played nearly every weekend
across the globe, including gigs at renown clubs and festivals such as
Fabric, Fuse, Mutek, and the Sonne Mond Sterne Festival and tours of
Japan, Australia and South America .

Meanwhile, his rare but intricate rocking live shows surface every
once in a while to remind us that his darkly-tinged, boiled-down beats
and distantly unsettling grooves are one of the most precious jewels
in the jagged DU crown. Check his killer releases Dumb-Unit, Trapez
and WMF if you need any proof.

Somewhere between his smart, re-edit heavy sets, his vigorously spiky
artist releases, and his scandalously consistent label, there lurks
the charred, elusive heart of Jeremy P. Caulfield. The fun part is
trying to find it.

simple greene has been making waves for a while. the collective wants to se=

the name. if you know any thing about one part of our family that is into d=

No trying to start any drama, however I just saw that Swag and the "Connise=

Coincidence, homage, or rip off, you be the judge...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dress codes for parties in sf

this is easy to do with a bunch of boom boxes strapped on each other's 
backs and an ipod radio adaptor just have to make sure you aren't near 
any major radio stations that the radio adaptor hits. the problem is 
that the bandwith being hogged by crap radio and the power of the 
adaptors are too low. if you can boost the wattage of the ipod radio 
adaptor there could b a  good plan.

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: PULSE tonight at Paradise Lounge

Not sure if it's considered afterhours, but we're going till 
4am, come by and say hi if you're around :-)

Friday :: March 27 :: 2009

PULSE Presents 3-L-3-TRONIC Live!

We know, we know... everyone is a DJ. So what makes 3-L-3-TRONIC 
different? They bring energy and entertainment beyond anything 
you've seen or heard before. One male and one female together as 
a collective, each bringing their own unique talents and styles. 
Performers Vitamindevo and Bianca Dino make 3-L-3-TRONIC. The DJ 
sets: bassy, dubby-breaks and progressive tech-house, blended 
with a unique collection of psy-breaks, electro, and 
chuggy-progressive finds, creating a low-end journey full of 
build-ups, break-downs, and break-throughs. 3-L-3-TRONIC Live 
adds live drums, vocals, original visuals, and more.

Track samples and live performance clips:

but please
don't take my heart

i had it all
when i had you
you are everything to me
everything and anything
now take it all

can't control what we can't control
can't stop this love
can't stop the pain
or you i'm thinking of

take anything you want from me
anything at all
take anything and everything
but please
don't take my heart

Subject: Re: [sfraves] medical marijuana

Hmm. . .

Depends on how you want to go about it.
Some doctors do ridiculous advertising, there's some "Pot Doc" guy who ads 
in local newspapers where I live,  I think there's a website, potdoc.com . 
Most doctors I've met like for the patient to have a record of some sort of 
their injury/illness. If a patient gets into trouble, or stopped by a dick 
cop, the doc is the person usually called.
    I myself have medical records from my orthopedic surgeon which basically 
go through all my surgeries and injuries, and my prop 215 supportive health 
practitioner is aware of them in case of any issues. I haven't had a problem 
though, I've been stopped and I tell the officer I have cannabis with me, 
they'd look at it and give it back, never had to show my med id. Federal law 
is diff though, so if you're on fed land like in the presidio in SF, than 
you can be fined and jailed for pretty much anything, arguing with the 
officers doesn't usually help either hehe.

    Some doctors however aren't as concerned I guess I could say, about the 
legal issues. Some think marijuana should be totally legal and believe in 
it's abilities and have no problem recommending it to anyone who feels it 
works for them.

    OCBC (Oakland cannabis buyers co-op, Don't think it's called that now 
though) has a card issuance tracking deal, and legal assistance for medical 
users. They're in Oakland, at like 17?? broadway, you could always go there 
and ask questions, it's on the north side of the street, easy to find.

There's also a state sponsored card program that's supposed to help id you 
if you're stopped by chp and such. It's supposed to help you if your 
transporting larger amounts of cannabis locally. . .
I don't know about that. . .I'm a little worried about any government 
related list with a bunch of federal law breakers names addresses and other 
information. I haven't looked much into that, but it's supposed to somewhat 
be required (if not now, than it will later).

Clubs are sort of plentiful, not as many as even just a year ago (thanks dea 
raids), but most areas have somewhere within a short drive. There used to be 
like 5-7 clubs here in the east bay around san leandro/san lorenzo/hayward. 
But the dea has had fun with it's raids lately, which are supposed to stop 
pretty much completely now that obama is in office (he's apparently a 
medical cannabis supporter). There has been changes and things are 
improving.

overall it's not as easy to get prescribed (it's actually recommended not 
prescribed) as it used to be but it's not difficult if you have a pretty 
legitimate reason for it's use. Of course you can probably find a doc who 
just signs a form and there you go. . .oh, and charges you $250. . . but I'm 
not necessarily in support of just giving it to anyone, it ultimately hurts 
the cause. . .

take care

aK
