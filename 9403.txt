I was very vague,  and not precise in mentioning the location of the
station.    "Somewhere in Oakland" covers a very wide area,   and
anyone with FM directional antenna could pinpoint it very easily.
So I didn't think I was giving away anything that could get them in
trouble.    Besides,  the FCC could pinpoint it in less than a
second...

Well,  I knew there WAS a station on 89.1 from down there somewhere,
but I guewss I was wrong.     I used to use 89.1 for my pirate station
in the 60's until a station went on the air using that frequency from
south of SJ somewhere.

How much public parking is there? One of the times I drove down
highway 1, I was disturbed at the vast stretches of road with NO
PARKING. Is this an attempt to keep the crowds down?

Hello to everyone:

My name's Henry and I've been reading posts here for a while but have 
been waiting to contribute until I fully got the feel for what you all 
talk about.  I'm always stimulated by the discussions here. I think I'm 
now ready to start doing some talking too.

I'm a S.F. native but have been attending UC Santa Barabara for the past 
four years.  I go back to Frisco when I can and take in the extensive 
nightlife as deeply as possible.

Well, here in Santa Barbara, we have a very small, start-up scene run mostly 
by a group of two or three really cool people who know what's up.  They 
know how to throw a party and understand what it's all about.  The other 
night, they invited us to their small warehouse which has become the home for
their parties called the Tests.  This past Saturday was Test II.

To make a long story short, around midnight a dude with a knife threatened 
someone people outside and the Test people called the cops.  Raves are strictly 
forbidden in Santa Barabara so this was a last ditch, 
reacting-to-a-crisis sort of reaction.  To no one's suprise, the cops 
told us all to leave and the organizers are facing criminal charges for 
throwing the party.

Here is my main question.  I was thinking afterwards that we should have 
collectively sat-in to protect and assert our rights.  This was a peaceful 
gathering at which one overzealous, high-strung person ruined it for everyone.  
It frustrated me that I nor anyone else thought of the option to sit-in to 
protest the police decision.

My big questions to this lengthy prologue: 

Has anyone participated in a sit-in at a 
rave?  Do you think this is a productive tool to use when confronted by 
police?  Is a willingness to be arrested part of the raving spirit of 
protest?

I'm very curious to hear your responses and opinions.

Thanx, glad to be here, and Peace,

	-h-

You gotta watch it in certain parts of the country. In KY I had 4
friends who legally owned machine guns. Scary thing is, they weren't
fanatics.

If it's a specific situation designed to test one's constitutional
right to peaceably assemble, I'm willing to join others in being
arrested and fight it in court. I believe very strongly that raves are
an important positive haven for those who might otherwise be on the
street causing trouble.

It's been brought up several times, but I'd really like to see more
efforts towards founding a church. As many people believe very
strongly in raves and the spirit of the thing (which can be written up
very simply and non-denominatory), there should be enough to get
something accomplished. When that is done, there are additional
constitutional issues involved in any police disruption, making it
(hopefully) less likely.

Is that not what a church is about? Promoting some ideal, assembly,
ritual, and celebration? I feel that if we want to do this, barring
excessive noise or gross issues of safety, we have every right to be
left entirely alone behind our closed doors.

I'll be happy to write some letters to various places in Santa Barbara
if someone can get me the addresses. For that matter, we need to start
letting the people in power know what a positive thing raves are. If
the UK can ban them, we'll be next.

Sean

I went to a party that was advertised as 21 and over.  Security did not 
even check my I.D.  I sometimes think that it's advertised as 21 and over 
so they can deter people under 21 to come.  Does C/U have a tendency to 
advertise events as 21 and over and then not enforce them? 

(Is there a law effective in SF that says if you're under 21 you can't 
stay out later than 2 am?)

A missile is the word used in the article I posted, (which was printed          
in a British newspaper remember) to describe an object allegedly thrown
at one of the police officers by one of the meeting attendees.
In this context it probably refers to a brick or a bottle or such,
as opposed to a Sidewinder or SAM-7.

Hmmm, I was also there, and I know the promoter involved, and he did not
call the cops, although I'm glad they shut it down. I believe (and I've
promoted events) that it was utterly irresponsible to throw an event of
that size without proper security. There was one security/doorman for about
300 people.(In a space that could comfortably hold about 200) When a female
friend of mine was assaulted and groped, the sole security guard, who is
also a friend of mine was understandably reluctant to do anything because
he had no backup. It was shocking and maddening to see the behavior there.
At this time the promoter wasn't even there. When he arrived and was told
what happened his attitude was "gee, too bad - not my problem."

Basically, while I'll give the Test promoter credit for doing a lot for the
SB scene, I don't think he "knows what it's all about." For him it seems to
be about money and attitude. An attitude of "I started the scene and there
isn't room for anyone else in this town." I've had a lot of great times in
SB, and it hurt to see what happened. But you can't place all the blame on
the cops, who were even cool enough to suggest ways of getting permits in
the future. I'd like to know where you heard that there were criminal
charges pending against those involved.

There were a number of reasons the cops gave for shutting it down, from
people hanging outside drinking beers, to lack of fire permits, to illegal
parking. And it sucks it got shut down, but if the event had been thrown
with a bit more consideration, it wouldn't have been. Look at Energizer,
thrown in the same warehouse last year (ironically, by the same people) -
the cops stopped by and didn't hassle anybody and the event went on all
night and it was a lot of fun.

I do think this is a good idea, and I've wondered what would happen if it

I participated in a spontaneous sit-in, not at a rave, but here's the
situation.  In college, a group of ~80-90 people were peacefully
protesting on the lawn of the president, which was owned by the
College.  Many other protests had happened there without incident.
This time, however, the president had instructed them to remove
students by force if necessary.  We staged a peaceful sitdown strike,
at which point they grabbed a few random people by the hair and tried
to drag them off anyway.  (I was one of them, but was held back by the
crowd.)  Eventually, they succeeded in getting about six students into
the cars, and they would have had many more but for the rings of us
who formed around people getting kicked by the cops and kept them from
being arrested too.  Everyone spontaneously decided that they
weren't going to just drag a few scapegoats off to jail, so we blocked
the road on both sides and prevented the police from leaving.  After
roughly 20 more police cars showed up, including dogs and fire trucks,
and over a hundred more students showed to support those already in
the road, and several hours of negotiation ("Who's your leader?"  "We
don't have one."  "Let me talk to them."  "Who?"), the students were
all released, and we marched as a crowd to the police station and let
them know (non-violently) exactly what we thought of the whole thing.

The larger the group, the less likely you are to be arrested.  If there
is violence, you are about 100% likely to be arrested, so don't do that.

If you are touched by an officer, go limp and hope the crowd holds you
back.  Touching a cop WILL be construed as 'assault on an officer' in
court -- even tapping their arm.

Be willing to take consequences -- outdoors, trespassing, disturbing
the peace, and possible curfew; indoors, whatever weird local ordinance
applies.  IF YOU HIT BACK AT THE POLICE IN A PEACEFUL DEMO, YOU ARE 
FUCKED, AND SO IS YOUR CAUSE.

In short: If a sit-in is planned, make sure everyone knows what's going
on.  Make sure everyone knows what could happen to them and is prepared 
to deal.  Make sure everyone has the same plan of action because the
confusion will be intense.  Make sure you have a lawyer lined up
(check your ACLU for contact info).  Most importantly, make sure what
you're doing is right, that you believe in it, and that you're willing
to stay in for the long haul, because the legal system takes for-fucking-
ever.

I can try and explain more if desired.  Feel free to contradict me if you
have more experience...that was the only time I've dealt with cops actually
arresting friends, though I've been through other nonviolent demos which
didn't result in arrests (anti-war, ACT UP, etc.)

	The better your planning, the less likely there will be arrests
and bad press.  Remember that the whole thing is a publicity stunt -- it's
not for you, because you know you're right.  It's for the others
who think you're bad because the cops only harass bad people.  Choose
your strategy and act accordingly.

	A very interesting question!

	We in San Francisco have had it fairly easy when it comes to
parties, even though at times it doesn't feel like it.  Ravers in
England have had a very hard time with the police - Parliament in fact
has a bill before them which would all the cops to prevent the
assembly of 10 or more people at one time if they thought the purpose
was to have a "rave" (yes, that's the word used in the bill itself).
Ther have been some ugly busts there, tied in with the nomadic
Travelers/pagans.  (There are people on this list with direct
experience with this - speak up! :) Right now raves (a much aligned
word in the UK) exist either as clubs that go until 6am, massive
fully-permitted Bill Graham-style events tied in with other music
festivals, or highly illegal renegades (which is how this all started
anyways).

	Problems with the police have not been limited to that side of
the Pond - last year there was a big bust in Milwaukie (I think - the
reference is in the archives somewhere) where the police shut down a
party because fire safety laws were supposedly being broken, and then
proceeded to arrest and cite every single attendee with a $300 fine
for "aiding and abetting the illicit sale and consumption of alcohol",
because they found a beer bottle behind the DJ booth (talking about
grasping at straws!).  A massive, well-organized civil protest against
these fines (I think it mostly consisted of everyone walking in and
contesting the fine, and the courts refusing to hear each case one by
one) got them initially reduced and then charges dropped altogether.
I'll try and dig up that story too if there's interest.

	So, back to the situation at hand.  I don't think there's
much you can do about the criminal charges against your friend,
except look into all the laws involved, perhaps with the help of
a lawyer, and make sure there aren't any clauses or loopholes 
or unconstitutionalities which could help.  San Francisco's "no
dancing between 2am and 6am for those under the age of 21" law
was abolished thanks to protests from SF residents, partially
organized by promoters in the scene and a few SFRavers too.

	As for whether a sit-in would have been the answer, I would
say no, because there's not much a couple hundred people can do
against the well-armed militia our police force has become.  Back
in the 60's it might have been possible, but today's cops are in
NO mood to deal with stuff like this, and an act like that will
make them even less willing to hear you out.  Parties are a great
and wonderful thing, but one night's party isn't worth going to jail
over (choosing your battles wisely is important).  Also, people
didn't go to your party to become involved in a possibly life-
threatening situation.  There will almost definitely be some
who will be in no position to face figures of authority (too
much laughing as the officers sprout pig's snouts and pink ears :)
and that can only get you in more trouble.

	All the anarchists on the net will hate me for suggesting
this, but when the police the LAST thing you want to do is get
confrontational.  There is a definite science to cop assuaging.  Some
cops arrive with their course of action already determined, and
there's really not much you can do at that point except regroup and
either try and find a new location or call it a night.  *Most*,
however, (speaking from experience in the bay area, and this may not
be as true in other areas) can be cool, and with the right amount of
courtesy and respect and "Yes sirs", can be encouraged to let the
party go on.  This HAS worked - I've even heard some cops say "I
wish I could come join ya..." but it doesn't always.

	I wrote up a whole document about throwing parties outdoors
and dealing with cops effectively and such.  It's a MS Word for
Windows document (I thought I had a text version somewhere.. hmm.)
It's at ftp://techno.stanford.edu/pub/raves/spirit/iconekt.doc.
Lots of hints and stuff there.  

	Hope your friends come throgh this alright.  Send us updates!

	Brian

I dunno wassup with everyone trying to get one up by revealing shit, all of
a sudden.

During the pirate radio fm thing, people post the whereabouts (or so *they*
think).

During the full-moon dozens of messages asking, leave me e-mail, and other
stuff.  Not to mention people trying to figure out where it is by talking
about previous locales (really dumb oneupspersonship).

What's the point?  To get people busted?
To make sure a backup space cannot be used?
To see who knows what first?

This is antithetical to the whole thing people.  Enjoy the mystery!

Shit, by now you must know at least *one* other person's number after a
full moon, or know someone who has been.  Call 'em up instead of trying
them here (hell, if they're chasing a full moon they'll be on the phone for
a few hours anyway).  Get a phone list from someone, develop a phone tree
with *one* contact point.  That way one person gets in everyone does.  But
just keep it off the list.

Kepp the shit real.

As for letting people know where stations are...just another cheesy antic.
I guess the real excersize here is to teach everyone about radio
propagation, and antenna designs/tracking methodology for geolocation.
Isn't there a newsgroup called alt.raver.tracking.cheeseball that deals
with these subjects?

Can't ya just enjoy the fact that someone who like the music is doing
something *very* special and leave it at that.  Instead of *possibly*
blowing someones cover for information dispersals sake?

Damn this shit is old.
-----------------------
It was really good to hear everyone had a good time at the FMM.  I *wanted*
to, and I kinda did, despite the fact I did not hear DJ one spin, since I
was not going to hang around till 5 for the late ones to get shit set up
and running (like this sentence).

Got wet, got cold, got up, got lost (3:30 am, there for about 1.5 hours).
Six of us got a motel room (the Starfish) and got really, er, altered.  Had
a great time!!!, left at about 11 a.m. crakin' on and laughing at the whole
thing.  It almost made it worth the drive.

The FMM crew should get it sorted.  Starting that late is really weak.
They have *not* always been this disorganized.  I know that during the past
year they have had alot of hits, equalled by the misses.  Each FMM seems to
, when they do go foo, be the shit.  But really, even tho it is a freebie,
people travel really far to come to this event, and the least that can be
done is to respect those folx by starting at a reasonable time.

I know it was raining, but so what?  Everyone was wet, willing, and
*waiting* to get it goin'.  And I heard that once they did get things set
up it went off.  There was no reason for it not to go off earlier.

I have no bitterness towards the event, shit happens, and is bound to
happen at any moment.

I just think that *mutual* respect is paramount!

I'll wait till the next weekend full moon.  Until then, I'll see some of
you at: WICKED.

There's only two people I wanna hear spin, Markie (The Man) Mark, and Jeno.
Yeah, I know, I coulda heard them at the FMM had I not cracked on at the
Starfish, but it'll be cool (not as cool as outdoors methinks), to hear
them nonetheless, and then to get a bonus round afterwards!!!!

Pax,
John

P.S. John Howard has a new tape out...check it out when you get a
chance!!!!  Good Stuff!!!

Pshaw.  I've been at/in several demos in several cities, and if anything
the cops now seem to be less likely to beat the shit out of you because
they know cameras are watching and people don't trust them.  Back in the
60's you had people _killed_ by cops at Kent State and other places.

People still get killed by cops, but they don't get killed in big 
demonstrations -- they're killed in one-on-one (or several-on-one)
encounters where there are few or no witnesses.  Same with lesser
violence -- the probability of cop violence decreases as the
number of people increases.

Like I said, sit-ins come after negotiation has failed.

This is the most important point, and I agree.  Civil disobedience is

Like you said, it's the _last_ thing you do, but sometimes it must be
done.  Like I said, plan carefully, and make sure no one gets trapped
into doing something they're not prepared to do.

Well, I think that most of the FMM pre-info stuff was mostly innocent. 
Maybe a little notice should be posted in the 'welcome to sfraves' bit. 
Though it was incorrect anyway, those that blurted, apologized nicely and 
will know better next time. Funny how the FMM brings sfraves lurkers out 
of the woodwork (observation, no slam intended).

As for posting locations in reviews, granted Bonny DOON, is well-known by 
as many law enforcement officials as ravers and thus probably doesn't 
suffer for any publicity. But unless everyone wants to truck down there 
every month because all the other sites have dried up, think before you 
type. We already know the FMM was great, starts late, great vibe, 
etc.,etc. Not to quell anyone's urge to review, just make sure what you 
say keeps the possibility open for enjoying the site again. And for 
cryin-out-loud, don't x-post it to alt.rave.

Correct or not, the pirate radio post was in bad taste. If he really 
wanted his name broadcast, I'm sure he would have done it himself. Having 
people respect *your* privacy goes hand-in-hand with respecting that of 
others. Yeah, the Livermore boys could be here and on him easily. So 
what? It's *his* decision to make.

Granted, the telephone tree deal works for the most part, but we live in 
a windy climate and those upper branches just aren't as strong as the 
trunk. Keeping to the *one* contact principle is fine for the most part, 
but my twig blew off to LA this month. Oh well, found out after some 
hustling anyway and after all, if'n you don't find it, there's always next 
month (it ain't the end of the werld).

Just seems to be a shame not to use e-mail. Wicked is on anyway, not to 
mention others involved with them. Howabout a nifty Internet treasure 
hunt? Have a trail of breadcrumbs strung across the net to some obscure 
gopher den or alley in the web or some .plan in Denmark or some anonymous 
post in a random sci. group. While mappoints unnerve me to no end, it's 
just because noone's really exploited the fun they could be.

And the PopSci area 51 was a joke, but why not? Certainly none of Wicked 
want a FMM map going around, and this doesn't really help with new sites, 
but for re-runs what's safer: (1) roight...tayke ah lift aht tha stooplite, 
dahn ta tha feefth streyt. roight...no I meen lefte. Take ah... [sorry

Repeat Area Two-Sixer-Bravo-Delta [you get the picture]. 

There's frustrating mystery and fun mystery. JMAR. <raising hand for fun>

who are these lurker people? phil care to comment? (:(:

i think i have made quite and effort to meet most sfravers....and i 
figure i know about 100 and maybe there are 100 from out of town some i 
have met and some i haven't...that leaves alot more of people to meet and 
to post...

where and who are you? 

why is it that the fmm party must take 
up an entire days worth of traffic...hell for most people it is a local 
call to another sfraver...(as opposed to other rave lists that cover a 
much larger area)...just wondering...partyon....susie(:

gosh should i propose the idea of buttons or badges like other lists use 
to identify each other...*noone ever wears their sfr pin anymore*

It's pretty hard to enjoy it when you're new to the scene, and
everyone seems to know everyone else but you. So you hear about this
wonderful wonderful event, and want to go and meet people and share a
good vibe. In your good faith you ask the list in hopes that someone
will contact you and let you know.

Then people shit all over you, tell you to get a clue, ask you what
you're trying to prove, etc. You should *enjoy* being clueless. What?
You couldn't find it? What's wrong with you? The bay area is only so
big, everybody else found it.

The full mooner does have unique logistics problems. On the other
hand, it doesn't justify slapping newbies for asking where it is. Be
gentle. Give people a positive first impression.

I for one will not post to someone that I haven't met face to face. How
do I know that they're cool? Just because you're on this list doesn't 
guarantee that.

   After reading some message posted here about the social wrongs of 
asking for or posting info about the FMRs I just want to apolgize again 
for not knowing. I would alsolike to point out that for some of us, this 
is the only information tree we have, and that probalbly there are others 
like myself who subscribed to this so I could know about events as well 
as discuss them and other related topics. I was hoping from this list to 
gain information. I understand how in the situatio of the FMRs it is 
alittle bit different none theless all I was trying to do was to get 
myself added or finding a node I could connect with on the info trees.

Sorry again, but I hope that some of you might understand a little bit 
more whysomeof us, like me posted for info.

Nobody's slapping newbies, as I say now and have always said, I always tell
people who call me where the party is going to be, all they have to do is call
me.  Some of you can attest to this fact.  Lately it get's hectic around that
time.  I don't respond to e-mail because I am suppose to wait until about 10
p.m. before I tell anybody, between 10 and 11 is when I answer the phone,
I don't have time to answer individual e-mail (I would run an FMR list
if that were the case). BUT if you call between these times, there is a good 
chance that you will reach me and I will tell you where it is.  We want to
move the FMR further underground (that should be obvious), obviously the FMM
needs to solve some of it's own logistical problems (like more appropriate
startup times) but the whole idea is to have people come who _really_ want
to be there, it should be a personal thing, if you don't know anyone around
you that you can call, maybe you should reach out and touch someone :)
As I said before, this party is not just about Tanks of Nitrous and a great
way to start the weekend's festivities, we want people to come who can 
co-create the party.  That means meeting people and making an effort.
There are people on this list who live 3000 miles away and know how to find
the info, I know for a fact Sean that you know many people who you can call
to get the info. Once you have it you can take it upon yourself to disceminate
it.  We'd rather have it passed word of mouth then through the network,
(too easy to wind up on a BBS, which is why I don't run the fmr login
on nexsys anymore)  Since this has happened the parties have been smaller and
have been successful.  I think it should go even more underground.

There are no flyers for the FMR and there is no info line.  It really needs
to remain that way.  Two years ago, the people that came to the FMR were a lot
more responsible, they knew this was a potentially "illegal" action and acted
accordingly, they looked out for each other and came as a group.  Currently,
the parties have turned into Massives with 3 to 4 nitrous tanks, beer, fireworks
and other things that will bring the Authorities down on us in a hard way.
If the party was to continue, some changes needed to be made, so it's being
driven further underground, this last FMR had about 250 max, about 100 by 8 am.
The party before that had about 400 people.  Last Halloween we had about 
1600 - 2000 people at Bonny Doon.  It's better if the party is smaller.  It is
still open to anyone, you just have to make some effort to find it.  The 
effort we are asking is that you reach out with your heart and get to know
each other.  Times may soon come where these kind of relationships my prove
priceless and even lifesaving. 

Is that too much to ask?

I was very vague,  and not precise in mentioning the location of the
station.    "Somewhere in Oakland" covers a very wide area,   and
anyone with FM directional antenna could pinpoint it very easily.
So I didn't think I was giving away anything that could get them in
trouble.    Besides,  the FCC could pinpoint it in less than a
second...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Not to mention, the East Bay Express did a cover story on Free Radio
Berkeley and Dunnifer a couple months ago and they start the story out,
if I remember correctly, with something like:  From somewhere in the
East Bay Berkeley/Oakland hills in a car/truck/etc. a tiny FM transmitter
broadcasts......

So, Dunnifer took them up there assumedly knowing they would report details
and we all know he's fighting the FCC in their face anyway, he's not realy
trying to hide anything.  No big deal.

	Well we used to have the SFR lunchs but I guess elizabeth is pretty
	occupied with another form of all night party (a new baby :)
	So she can't organize the south bay SFR lunches, it has also been the
	wintertime.  Lunches  are a good way for newbies to meet each other
	and some of the old timers, that way  people will know what you look
	like. And we'll know your not a cop (unless your an undercover and
	in that case we'll  just have to convert you with love :) Another way 
	to come to ComeUnity, or n/1994 or any of ethans or brycers parties.
	These are (mostly ;-} legal house parties where it is unlikely that you
	run the risk of getting arrested or hassled by the police.


	Maybe it's time for Connection IV

This is worth discussing further. I take it Rox means "not a cop" by
being cool.

It's probably a good idea not to email the location around. Once the
information is online, it's just too easy to forward or post
somewhere. So I'd say it'd be a good idea to ask them to call you up.

But even if you insist on talking with someone, or meeting them in
person, it's going to be pretty hard to tell if they're connected with
law enforcement. And that's a tough dilemma.

At what point do we "protect what we have" by becoming exclusionary?
It's a really tough question. And just about any tactic one proposes
is going to come under criticism. I particularly like the approach
with the full moon events. Their tactic is to simply make it hard to
find out where it is. If you can find it, you're welcome to attend.

This *does* make it difficult for newbies to find it, which is okay by
me. The thing to do I think is offer to meet with the newbies and
carpool with them and introduce them around. Or if you personally
don't like newbies at FMRs, offer info that will help them get a
leg-up on the scene. Certainly no one is obligated to help newbies,
but I hope they can be given a positive first impression of things.

(That, by the way, is how you save the scene.)

When the problem is scaled down to smaller events, it gets a bit
stickier. If you don't get enough people, your party "fails". Get too
many, and your space may be trashed or you may attract police. How do
you get a decent crowd without having everyone in SF show up? Good
question.

I heard secondhand about someone (I don't know who) at Friends &
Family saying that they didn't like it because there were too many
people there they didn't know. I respect that person's opinion (just
as I respect DJs who tape over record labels), but I don't think it
helps things much. Many of us have found the scene a welcome refuge
from just this sort of idealogy. If the scene is important to you, you
might want to consider how such an idealogy would affect it in the
long term.

See you all tonight at C/U. If you don't know me, and want to meet me,
look for the blue (!) lightstick. I may have a red one too :). If you
don't know me and say hi, I may just give you one :).

Sean

PS - I'd be totally happy to spend time in the FMR phone tree, but I
live in Sacramento, and need to leave about 10pm, as it's a two hour
drive to most places in SF. I end up calling people from a pay
phone in SF to find out where it is. :(  I *really* need to move into
the city...

____________________________________________________________________

it is kinda good time, what with sfr being 2 yrs old and all. it is kinda
'taking stock' post.

 so it is 2 yrs since we've started this experiment in virtual community.
i felt for some time rather disconnected from the sfr and the
rest of the house community. i just want to let you know that i've felt
i've reconnected after the come/unity party at caesar's palace on the 19t
there are still some issues regarding how we relate to each
other and with the rest of the houserave community.
there are some problems which we have, methinks. by the very nature of
our medium, computers, we are alienated from each other. we need to take extra
efforts to stay 'connected.' also, i feel we are/have been rather disconnected
from  the larger house community. also, what sort of group are we ? a collectiv
 a top down structure ? several events recently highlight  this. the way
the sfr was brought to a halt was very much top down : brian just did it.
is this a communal type of decision making ? i think not. anyway, this
just points out to the fact that we've not really talked about how we
arrive at decisions.
the reasons ? well,  1st i point to the nature of the medium (see above).
also, i guess different people want different things out of sfr, so there r
varying levels of involvment. but , i also feel that this has to do
with a rather weak  kind of interaction   which we've had lately.
i should add that parties like ethan's and bryce's are good. but
i think we need to reach out the larger community as well.
some possible solutions: meet more regularly , say before going to events
together; also, discuss what kind of things do people want out of sfr;
post a monthly reminder of what sfr is/is becoming , as well as publicize
things like the fmr phone tree, sfr-orgamizers sublist, and how to get on it.
maybe we can wear sfr buttons more often.
i think this is a great endeavour we're on and want to keep it going,
to keep it growing.
take care/shalom
ovid
p.s. ok, i am ready, flame-proof :) shield on!

This is exactly how I got connected with the SFR "movers and shakers."  My
friend Johnny had been on the mailing list for a number of months and we
went to events advertised on it, but it wasn't until he and I went to a
South Bay lunch that we got to know people who knew how to get connected to
the (former) FMR phone tree.  And to be honest, our initial reason to go to
the lunch was just to find our where the FMR was going to be.  But, you
know what?  He and I have made many close friendships that emanated from
that first lunch.

These friendships influenced me to move to San Francisco since I now had
*friends* in The City, not to mention instant access to all the events. And
though I've haven't been very active lately, I am really glad that I met
all of you as well as the people with whom I continue to make friendships.

Having said all those nice things, I'd like to mention something that seems
to be alluded to in the "Revealing" posts that intersects with this thread:
exclusivity.  Being somewhat new to the rave culture and somewhat
influenced by the 60's cultural movement, I was initially guarded but came
to fully appreciate the "welcome with open arms" approach that is being
espoused.  And, I came to understand that a certain level of secrecy needs
to be maintained.  I have been very lucky to be included in many secret
conversations because I happen to have befriended key people in SFR, but
I'm certainly not on the organizers mailing list (though I would love to
lurk on that one :)  ).  Yet, I believe there are many people on the list
that feel disco-nnected from the central aspects that make the SFR
experience so fantastic.

It's just too bad that secrecy and being "in" or "out" of various aspects
of the rave scene apparently contradicts the "everyone is welcome" ideal. 
All the reasons for secrecy have been well explained and justified.  I do
think it's funny that I've been dissed by ravers for having been part of an
exclusive, hierarchical fraternity when I see similar things going on in
rave organizations.  This is likely a human organizational phenomenon (get
out your organizational behavior textbooks :) ).  I am sorry but I'm just
one of those people who likes to go out and actively bring people into a
group that is doing great things.

I am simply proposing that we keep reminding ourselves to push as hard as
possible for *inclusion* wherever possible.  That is, not only creating an
environment that welcomes others, but we should actively and continuously
encourage others to be a part of us--in all aspects of the scene.  I see
this as work for a good cause.

Just thoughts from me and my Duo on a sunny rooftop in S.F...

>        Maybe it's time for Connection IV

Having missed, but heard about, I-III, I would definitely look forward to
it...and the C-IV tapes!!!

I think the problem cases showing up at the FMRs are almost positivly
NOT related to publicity/discussion/info distributed over the net.
Often they are locals (in the Bonny Doon case, a bunch of Santa Cruz
types) who keep the full moon date in mind and are notified through their
own networks, and keep the beer compressed and the nitrous chilled just
for the occasion.

As for the Authorities learning of the site through postings here or
elsewhere, feh.  In almost all cases the relevant LE types know about
this within minutes of the first cars arriving, sometimes sooner.
I mean, isn't this obvious?

I agree with Geoff wholeheartedly on one issue.  The FMRs need more
self-aware, massive-conscious participants.  Cutting the numbers may help
somewhat (larger numbers tend to generate different social dynamics anyway),
but *expecting* a higher level of consciousness is key to making it work.

I know this isn't a good place to discuss this, and I din't really want to
discuss it, nor do I think there should be any follow up discussion on this
here.

However, I thought I'd forward a 3rd party view of what happened, in order
to shed a little light on the subject of a recent sfraves flame war...

Personally, I think Wired Mag did the right thing in settling this stupid
bit of lawyerism, and Womens Wire certainly got a great deal of free
advertising through Wired Mag and through all the ensuing mediahype.

(Or maybe it was just a planned grab at the headlines for both parties!)

Heh.  I made a similar observation/recommendation a while ago right
before I moved here and you know what some people on SFRaves said to me:

	"I see computer people all day, I don't want to see
	more computer people when I go out."

	"Whenever I go out I see other SFRavers.  I'm getting tired
	of seeing the same people all the time."

	"Why should I come to an SFRaves party . . . I've got
	other friends throwing parties I want to support." (Geeze,
	it's just ONE NIGHT, you don't have to come to every single
	one of the darn things.)

I even posted descriptions of the kinds of things we did back East
in the net-rave community I was part of there, and people made fun
of me saying things like:

	"How can you dance if you spend so much time eating"
		(This after I described how we'd go out before and/or after 
		raves in New York, and how various ne-ravers used to bake
		cookies to share at raves.)

Over the past few weeks I've called my whole participation in the
net-rave scene into question.  Too many upsetting things have 
happened for me to even care what's going on most of the time.
I feel really hurt because in the beginning (two years ago) I
put so much of myself into net-raving, and watched a bunch of
weird people on the East Coast grow into a bizzare sort of extended
family, and then degenerate into a bunch of bickering kids trying
to show who is more "down with it" than the other.  

It hasn't been as bad here :-) but yet between various flame wars
and statements like the ones above I've been depressed to no end.

So anyway, I know I'm sitting here whining, but when I put up
suggestions for solutions I got stepped on so I'm feeling quite
bitter and empty of energy.  I feel like I've given all I can and
there's nothing left.  I did the best I knew how and got told I was 
wrong, that I can't possibly understand the scene here, and that I'm
on a power trip.  I realize the statements of a few individuals 
probably doesn't accurately reflect the tone of the 300+ sfravers,
but after all when the negative incoming mail is greater than the
supportive mail, then what am I supposed to think?

Why don't y'all have a north bay SFR lunch tomorrow (Thurs 3/3). Say around
noon at the contract design center, 600 Townsend St, SF. then before/after
you all can go check out the cool SGI graphics/video stuff being demo'd
there all day. And furthermore, you can trip out on SGI's "magic bus" and
see all of SGI's cool high end graphics gear in a mobile showroom. Well,
that's where I'm going!

	I find political discussions, pontification, and soapboxes 
	particularly annoying on SFR. If everyone decided to mail their
	political attitude adjustment of the day to SFR we'd be swamped
	with ejmail (electronic junk mail) with everyones attitudes.

	Instead of thinking "gosh everyone SHOULD REALLY hear this", try

	thinking "do people really want to hear this?" before you send
	your next political revelation to everyone.

	Many people read this list at work and dont' need their Qmail 
	clouded with political stuff that they encounter anyways. We are
	all reading the same usenet news and finding out about whatever
	privacy violations/colonialism/ecohavoc that happens. We don't need
	the newspaper/usenet news rebroadcast to us.

	SFR should be for things that you *don't* see in the news, and *dont*
	have shoved in your face while walking on our respective campuses
	be they corporate or collegiate.

	Please don't post any flames to me to SFR- email me *personally*.
	This is the one and only time I'll bring this topic up. The rest
	of what I say will solely be related to our rave scene and the
	audio issues therein.

So how does one exactly get Internet people to divulge?  Walk up to random
folks at raves and say, "Hey, you don't know me, but you look like a cool
person to talk to.  Are you on the Net?"  Maybe it's just the L.A. vibe that
I'm used to, but guys will think I'm some negligible dweeb and all the girls
will think that I'm hitting on them.

I dunno, is it THAT easy to meet folks at raves up there?

I found that there were many incredibly easy ways to meet tons of
ravers, both net and non-net:

Net: go to a party organized and promoted via the list, or one of the
lunches, or a concert (like the Orb) or to events which have been
heavily discussed on the list (like come/unity).

General: go to an event BY YOURSELF and be prepared to meet people.
It is amazing how many more people you meet when you go out by
yourself than if you go out with friends.

And yes, Martin, it IS that easy to meet people up here.  :-)

	I realise that some of the topics posted are a somewhat non-related
to rave culture, which this list is based upon. We are drifting 
more into politics, net politics, flames, and unnecessary cc:'s to sfraves.
However I think people are hitting that "r" key and "f" key without
realising the impact it has on others (=TOO MUCH MAIL). :).
  
If I find the copy of the sfraves guideline post that Brian made awhile back 
after he shut off sfraves (due to so many irrelivant posts), I will try to
send it out.

Bob taught me by example an easy way of meeting people: Give away
stuff.  A $6 box of blo-pops or muffins or whatever is a wonderful way
to amp the vibe and introduce people to your face :). I for one was
surprised at how many nice smiles one can get.

I for one will not post to someone that I haven't met face to face. How
do I know that they're cool? Just because you're on this list doesn't
guarantee that.

Rox
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not saying this is a bad idea or anythin, it's a good one, but I want
to point out some of the inconsistencies in the scene in general.  Every
time I've ever been at a party on full moon night, the minute someone finds
out the location it spreads like wild fire between groups and individuals
that are complete strangers.  Sometimes it is even announced over the mic.
I've also called and been given the location by people I know on this list
(bless them) who I know, but not too well.  I could be a cop or informant.
Oh ya, I even called the bartender at Zanzibar one particularly desperate
night and was given the location, no prob.  So.... I guess what I'm saying
is that security is only as good as the weakest link in the chain and there
art a lot of weak links out there.  People shouldn't get too uptight when
there are all these ways to find out that are easier or just as easy.  I
guess I'm also pointing out hints to the newbies so that they can find out
through these other methods.  This information can also be used by people
who want to attempt to clam down on these weak links.  Good luck.

Not everyone you're going to meet will welcome you with open arms.  I 
think if you genuinely want to meet people without having any other 
intentions than that, it'll somehow show through.  Not everyone that you 
meet has to be your friend.  But take risks...

> I dunno, is it THAT easy to meet folks at raves up there?

I do find it a little intimidating sometimes.  Even going with my one 
friend, I still feel a bit out of place without knowing his friends.  I 
find it difficult sometimes but it just works out in the end.  At the 
last Full Moon I met a lot of new people.  I had some help from a 
friend.. but sometimes that's all you need.  (If you don't have one, 
you'll just have to risk it.)

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Hi, I am from Oklahoma, ick!  Yes we have a pretty crummy rave scene here.  I
do film and video around the u.s. for raves.  Mostly in the Midwest and East
Coast.  I'd like to start doing some on the West Coast so any promoters,
PLEASE, ask for demo video tapes.
Anyhow I have amassed a fairly huge collection of digital recordings of ALL
types of rave on DAT & MiniDisc.  Does anyone else have such recordings they
would like to trade to check out the differences in music in different
locations.
It is pretty strange how much it does vary.
Drop a note!!!!!

Just seems to be a shame not to use e-mail. Wicked is on anyway, not to 
mention others involved with them. Howabout a nifty Internet treasure 
hunt? Have a trail of breadcrumbs strung across the net to some obscure 
gopher den or alley in the web or some .plan in Denmark or some anonymous 
post in a random sci. group. While mappoints unnerve me to no end, it's 
just because noone's really exploited the fun they could be.

how about we just use pgp and *properly* exchange keys (in person,
right?).  I'm no expert, but hey crypto's all the rage, haven't you

	Well, here is my official apology for that whole incident....I got
the chain letter off of mw-raves, and I honestly had no idea of the
repercussions of just passing it on....it should make everyone happy to
know I've been severely disciplined by my system admin.  Never again!

What about sfraves t-shirts?  We could do silkscreening at a party, whoever
wants brings a shirt and we could do it right there.  When I'm down in the
summer I should have at least one screen. I just made four Orb shirts for
my friends and I.  If anyone thinks this a good idea speak up and we'll do
it!

Susie says:

>Ne-ravers use badges...i have met a zillion ravers that way...need i
>say more

I'll agree.  There were so many times I'd be wandering around a rave and
I'd see that familliar bright pink badge.  I'd go up to the person, smile
and look at their email address on it, and I'd show them mine and the
end result was smiles and hugs from someone who I'd only known as an
email address.  That's how I met Susie's friend Doug, in fact:  he was
sleeping at a party and I went and read his badge . . . he woke up and
read mine, and it was like finding a long-lost cousin.  Best of all,
when the music is loud and it's hard to talk it's a good way to get
someone's name straight when you're meeting them for the first time.

Also, a lot of non-net ravers see the badges and ask what they are for.
So I tell them what's up and a number of them get very interested and turn
up on the email list shortly thereafter.  It's a lot more personal than
just handing out "come join our list" flyers, and it doesn't generate
any paper waste.

Of course, once when the subject was broached around here one of the
comments included "people don't necessarily want to be identified with
sfraves."  Whatever.  We certainly didn't MAKE anyone wear a badge,
we just made them available at cost to whoever on the list wanted one.

This all had a very good positive effect in the rave community:  
organizers and promoters would see how many net-ravers were really
around, and were impressed with the community we had created.  They'd
call one or another of us to make sure we all found out about events,
even very underground ones like Heather Heather's Back to Basics parties.
They really could see how we were supporting them, and were always
very positive and appreciative of our support.

  About a year ago I loaned Brian my badge machine, and everyone seemed 
to have a good time making badges.  If folks like, I'd be glad to loan 
out my machine again. I'm sure partyon would volunteer.  :<) 
 Just put anything you like with/about SFRAVES on a circle of 2" diameter,
and my Badge-a-Minit will crank out a finished button, complete with
plastic cover and attaching hook in back.  Or if you want to go into
business yourself, call 1-800-223-4103 and get them to send you a catalog.
A startup kit costs about 30 bucks.

Badges? Badges? We don' need no steenkin' Badges! :-)

w/r/t meeting people, I think it is far easier to meet SFravers than to
meet yer average club person. There's just something about dancing geek
to geek.

IMHO, about 50-75% of people at a rave fit  into the "club" or
"gangsta" persona and probably wouldn't have anything to do with me
since I don't spit-shine my shoes before going out and really couldn't
give a fuck about "looking like a raver" (generic baggy flannel person)
or doing raver drugs (X, Speed, Coke), or acting like i'm "down" with
any particular "scene" ...

But then again, i'm mostly uninterested in meeting people like that
anyways, so it all works out. I've never been able to maintain an 
idealistic streak that allowed me to believe that all people could
really/truly "come together into unity" (and since I don't do X, it's
pretty hard for me to hallucinate such a vision, though I have vague
recollections of how that felt in the past).

There's just too much engrained cliquishness, prejudice, and mistrust
among city-folks to make that happen in a real, deep, and true way. And
it seems to be an  unfortunate fact of human nature that we'd rather
label someone as "not one of us" than to try to understand and
appreciate them as an individual.

But, at least raves do bring lots of different people together, help
break down some of our social barriers, and allow us to meet people we
normally would never get to meet, etc. And that is a good thing, it is
real, and it's good enough for me.

i think tshirts are a great idea..but for those of us who like to go out 
more than once a week and hate doing laundery it could be quite a 
challenge to wear your shirt alot...but badges are small enough to wear 
and big enough to see...and i think quite more effective and 
inexpensive...partyon..susie(:

Wow the best way to find out is only 1 block from my apartment and I didn't
even know it. So all I have to do is go down to the 'Shoe and look for
ravers pounding coffee?

Well,  another method I fond VERY SUCESSFUL is to go to a LOT of raves.
I notice that many people say "I SEE YOU EVERYWHERE"....  Of course
you can go bananas on the dance floor like I do,   and try and get
people to smile at you...

Well I haven't seen any report yet so here we go:

Place: the Sounds Factory is a great place for a rave if the crowd is good 
(and last night it was very good). It was very nice to be able to dance 
with a fair amount of space around. It always nice to go back to a place
that hasn't been used in a while (at least for ravey kind of events)

Sound: what can I say --> It's the best sounds system that you can get in SF
by a long shoot.

Vibes: it's always hard to be objective but from mine impressions and from
my friends, it was one of those night that you can remember.

Music: I think last night Jeno, Simon and Garth really made a big effort to 
play something special (I get to hear these guys quite often but last night 
they definely put together a very interesting and "different from the usual" 
set). Jeno in particular was very strange, when I got there at 1:30ish he was 
playing some excellent techno. Simon was at his best in doing what he knows
how to do (you know those very acidy songs that build up in layers and blend
together in a way that you can't really tell which one is which).
Garth was unpredictable and very trippy. 

Good to see so many SFRAVES (Ovid, Lee, Robert, Comet, Sin, Derek, Sean, 
Crunch, Caliban and all the others that I forget now).


Thanks Malachi

i want to add  giamma's post. i agree that the sound is really great.
the musick was excellent and the vibe/crowd was good, pretty friendly.
tho' i stayed only until 4 am and was not using any psychoamplifiers,
the party felt really good, trancing out at times. actually i think
it turned out to be  good idea to change the place - remember, when
raves were at unusual places, unusal things can happen. i also loved
the visuals, synergy i belive. it really complemented the musick well.
how was dubtribe ? did they play ? they were supposed to in the
ambient room in the back, which was excellent. very conducive to spacing
out or to an intense discussion, like lee ani were having.
take care/shalom

Thanks goes to those at today's SB-sfraves lunch (Larry, Michael, Laura).
It was nice to finally meet some sfravers and get around the "ascii
barrier".

Looking forward to more lunches/raves/etc. .....

that are easier or just as easy.  I guess I'm also pointing out hints

busted, it's not because the cops didn't find out about it, because
I'm sure there's not one of them they don't find out the location
for, but it's probably because they don't want to bother unless there
are too many people there or it's causing too much of a problem.  I
mean, the cop at Bonny Doon that gave everybody a parking ticket, I'm
sure he had to realize why all those cars were parked there
throughout the night.  Email and the net are probably the last 2

other ways.

make their job a lot easier.  Hell, they could even set up some type
of automated process that would immediately print out all messages
with the text strings "FMR" and "location" in them...  Then some
office law enforcement geek could sit by the printer and wait for the

No, you don't get off that easy, and since this is about the list I think it
is appropriate to discuss these issues here.  While it is true that at different
times, we have gone off the geneal subject completely, I think Brian has done
a reasonably good job at keeping the list on track, we don't need any list
gestapo to tell us what is appropriate behavior, if I want someone to tell me
what I can do, say, express, etc especially in the Scene then I can go out and
buy another TV and start watching again.  I think people self-police 
themselves pretty well.  And who says that this list EVER had a charter to 
host discussions about "the audio issues therein"? I know that is your agenda
and it is fine with me, I have benefited from your posts and think they are a
good thing, I just hope that you can see it clear to have a little bit more
tolerance to the type of things that others have to contribute to the community.

The bottom line is that when we keep it off the list (for WHATEVER REASON)
they have been more successful, and no I don't think the cops know where the
party is most of the time. The things that give the party away are LOTS of
cars in a deserted place at 3 a.m. in the morning.

Except for a couple of FMRs, the cops have always found out, if they don't
bust it it's because they don't care or don't have the man power.

 As I said before the reason folks don't want it posted to the net is NOT
particularly because of the police, but because they want people to reach out
and get to  KNOW each other, we want to keep the FMR special, like finding a
pearl in an oyster.

Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

YSH returns! The deal for the space is concluded, so pending a
few tiny arrangements (like DJs :)), it's set to go.

DJs: Susan + ? + ? One idea is that since it's been a while, run 4 DJs
instead of three just this one time.

The info line 415-765-7670 is NO MORE. The collective has no means to
access the voice mail for this number, so do not leave them messages
there. They (should) have a new info line set up within 7 days, and
the new flyer will have it.

In the meantime if you need to send messages to the collective, call
Susan/Maui if you know their number, or email or call me at
916-488-8184 and I will relay it to them.

I thought C/U was pretty good. I was in kind of a moody mood, but I
still recognize it as a good event. There was just enough people there
for a killer vibe, but not so many it got truly uncomfortable.

When I got there Jeno was playing a fantastic tribal house set. I wish
he'd play more of the stuff because he is _really_ good at it. Later
he went into his usual Jeno house stuff. Simon really kicked my ass.
His set was pretty solid, and it was the exact kind of progressive
house I like to listen to (I only have 34 pieces of vinyl, he played 4
of them!). Hee hee. And Garth did his usually Garth house grooves,
getting just a bit weird and experimental near the end.

Bottles were confiscated. Free cups and free water inside. Free
oranges. No ins-n-outs. Nice promoters. $7, and well worth it.

Oh and by the way, the visuals were excellent. Intellabeams and
acidwarp/fractint style videos. I like what the sound factory has done
remodeling. They have big dolphins hanging from the ceiling, and the
most elaborate and beautiful mirror ball setup I've ever seen. Very

Well, I, for the most part, don't want to sound like a killjoy, but it 
seems like the list is getting further away from the whole purpose of
raves--as far as I can see--UNITY. There seems to be more bickering and 
flaming than I could have imagined in my dreams. This isn't to sound like 
I look down on you all, but if I may just use a totally overused phrase?

Glad to hear that Come/Unity went off so well last night, but I have
one small quarrel with Giamma's posting . . . unless the Sound Factory
has greatly improved their sound system since the last Wicked there
last summer, 177 Townsend still has the best overall system going
(as confirmed by a recent taste test, i.e. my visit to Rhythm a cople
weeks ago :)

"in my humble opinion" of course . . .

Actually, I've been working on a couple o' things for the past month, 
hoping to pass them out soon. If you want to see a couple of the badges, 
I'll drop a few on the ftp site. Blown up a bit and jpegged fer easy 
downloading. Look for Badge.01.jpg and the like. Hopefully I can get the 
bugs out of my screen press so's I can actually start giving them out.

This is a far cry from an 'official' release. Just some fun things I've 
been throwing together between deadlines that I thought somebody might 
like. JMAR. kerpow!

   hi.  my friends and i are going to tribal funk tonight (friday) and i just
wanted to invite people to come up and say 'hi' to me...  hopefully that
doesn't sound too stupid, but i've been wanting to put some faces to the 
names that i've been seeing for quite a while now.  i've only met a couple
of you and i'd like to meet a lot more (nothing against those i've already
met  =)...  anyways, i'll be the blond guy with an elmo shirt and a black
backpack, handing out lollipops or playing with various toys   =)  or
dancing, of course...  anyways, i hope i meet a lot of you tonight...  see
you there...

re: badges

I'd like to get another badge. I lost mine at the Connection down in the
basement of 1015 Folsom. Maybe we should have a picnic like the first
SFR picnic (maybe even the same place?) or at another party like the Blue 
Cube and everyone could make one?
Just some thoughts...

ok, here's an alternative ComeUnity review - very different from those I've 
read.  I only got to the SoundFactory at 3:30am but when I got there the dance
floor was crowded.  The strange thing is that people seemed to be dancing for 
the sake of dancing, not because the beat was in them -- that was my 
observation.  A lot of slo-mo dancing was going on, nothing like the high 
energy I was used to at 1015 Folsom.

I personally think Sound Factory's acoustics suck.  So they spent a lot of 
money on their sound system... so what?  It was my personal opinion that the
treble was way too high and was masking over some of the bass.

The thing I really missed at this last Comeunity was a feeling of community.
Can't even be compared to the vibe that exists sometimes at a 1015 Folsom
Comeunity, in my humble opinion.

So I hung out at the chill room and blissfully listened to dubtribe.

I was wondering how long it would take the police down there to
realize thay could capitalize on parties at Bonny Doon...  I mean a
hundred or so cars at $13 a pop isn't bad for 1/4 mile of road on one
night.  Plus it's not like they have any reason to go stop the party;
someone could probably set off a small nuke there without disturbing
the "neighbors".  :-)

Hopefully this will continue (the local cops collecting their piece of
the action while letting the party continue).  Maybe the FMR's could
start at a decent time in the future so I could occasionally make one
that's not on a weekend.

overemphasized treble can be an advantage - if you wear earplugs.  earplugs  
(the cheep disposable foam ones i use anyway) attenuate nonlinearly, the high  
end more than the low end.

With the recent thread concerning lasers, i came across an advertisement
in _MicroTimes_ the other day while doing some research.  A company 
called HSC Electronic Supply, with outlets in Santa Clara, Sacramento,
and Cotati, has some HeNe (Helium-Neon) lasers available.  I quote
their blurb:

"                 LASERS FOR THE TIMID
Finally, a Helium-Neon (red) laser for those who are shy about handling
High voltage...a self-contained tube/power supply unit that runs off
low voltage!  Just give it 900 mA of 12VDC and you get 1mW out! ...
all are tested good.  Great beam quality!

HSC# 14475   $69.95"

I have visited HSC from time to time (a.k.a. Halted), and they seem to
be a reputable purveyor of surplus.  

HSC's numbers are 408.732.1573, 916.338.2545, and 707.792.2277.
I have no association with them, and merely provide this information for 
your benefit.

        Some more info from my end.  Is there a designated SFraves design?
I can get long sleeve white beefy t's at my school (U of Oregon for six
bucks and probably use their silk screen equipment) this means I could
probably maybe do a couple of colors.  I'm not an expert yet but if we do
it at a party we might end up messing up some (of course they would be
unique) I just messed up a shirt I was making this week.  Send me more
ideas personally or if they are winderful ideas post for eveyone to ponder.
Could someone tell me if their are any designs in the ftp archives, I
think I could get them I'm still trying to figure out ftping.  Thanks.

HSC Electronic Supply says:

>low voltage!  Just give it 900mA of 12VDC and you get 1mW out!

As a comparison (just so you know what you are getting), my red 
laser (last seen at the Blue Cube) is rated (originally) at 7.5 mW, 
but is probably more like 6 now because the tube is old.  So, the HSC 
laser would be about 1/6th as bright.

Of course, you can't run mine off of batteries, either, so . . .

There's a paradox here: our computers have helped us be much more connected
to people that we might have never interacted with at all.  On the other 
hand, this limited form of connectivity often fails to live up to the kinds 
of connections that many people would like to have.

SFRaves is a communication forum, and nothing more.  But when people start 
communicating with each other, the idea of relationships tends to rear its
frightening head.  I guess what we can't help but to try to define the 
relationships that exist among us.  But this is no different than life-in-
general.  Trying to understand and define relationships is usually 
difficult, because people are complex and confusing.  In my life, I have
*never* found socializing  to be easy and without pain.  Nevertheless, 
raving and life with SFRaves has given me many opportunities to meet new 
people and it's been a lot fun.  It can be frustrating and alienating to 
have to deal with the limitations of these new relationships.  They can
often seem to be superficial and even insincere.  But the truth of the 
matter is that it takes a lot of time and energy for people to get deeply 
involved with each other.  It probably unfair for us to have high 
expectations from each other as far as social involvement goes.  But that 
doesn't mean it can't happen.

Laura:

>there's nothing left.

I'm still not sure I fully understand what the problems-in-need-of-solutions
are.  We all have different needs, and the chances are good that there will
be *some* SFR people who want to interact in similar ways and do similar 
things, unless what you want to do is incredibly weird or "non-ravey".  And 
even then, there are some incredibly weird and non-ravey people on this 
list.  So I wouldn't give up.  Also, there are new people coming in and out 
of our scene, so there's always the option of backing off, conserving 
energy, and trying again later. 

Disappointment seems to arise when people start expecting raving to fulfill
needs that go beyond the activity of raving.  I really can't blame people 
for wanting the rave scene to fulfill many of their social needs but the 
same thing happens with people who expect their career paths or family life 
to fulfill all their needs.  More often than not, they come up short.  

Crunch on meeting people in the rave scene:
>Well,  another method I fond VERY SUCESSFUL is to go to a LOT of raves.

That's right, Captain.  Sometimes I think we forget the obvious. Going to 
raves and putting out lot's of positive energy without any expectations is 
a good way to connect to other ravers.  When I was new to the scene, I 
would sometimes be dancing next to someone whose vibe & energy drew me 
toward them.  After a couple of hours, sticking my hand out and saying
"Hi, my name is Lee", was usually well recieved.  It isn't really that hard
to start talking to someone that you see (and has seen you) and shared
good feelings with.  

And likewise, if you want to meet more SFRavers, post more.  I guess
exposing oneself in public can be scary but once you've been reading the 
list for a while you have to realize that *everyone* who posts regularly
eventually says something stupid.   It's OK to be occasionally stupid.  
Stupidity is a big part of life.  In fact, I'd go as far to say the life
is generally stupid.  If you're posts are positive or informative or 
entertaining in some way, you're less likely to get flamed and like-minded 
people out there will *want* to meet you.  If you go to raves, review them 
and share an anecdote or two.  Every perspective adds something, even if it 
is stupid or boring.  

Another approach is to send people private email, especially if it is 
supportive or inquisitive about something they've posted.  We may not have 
much time or motivation to start a deep meaningful relationship, but even 
casual friendships can be fun.  When I'm out raving and I'm dancing near 
someone who's on the same wavelength as I, nothing needs to be said and 
we can feel pretty damn close.  Those feelings are very real, even if they 
are just of that moment. 

One final comment about SFRaves:  During the past 2 years there have been
a lot of successful cooperative efforts;  Connection I & II, Connection 
Earth, two Alternity's, a couple of major house parties, a few renegade
parties, dinners, lunches... and there are more things being planned.
Considering that we are a generally flaky and odd bunch, I think our 
erratic efforts at organizing and coming together have gone pretty well.  
Blaming the list for what it *hasn't* accomplished is sort of pointless, 
because SFRaves is not really a unified entity.  But we *always* have the 
option of reaching out, individual to individual.  SFRaves won't  make it 
happen, but it has given us the opportunity and some means to try.

I found the Sound Factory to be a bit too loud, and have too much
high-frequency sound energy at times. In any case, if you dance in the
middle you get very nice surround and good stereo definition. Anywhere
else in the room is mediocre at best. I forgot my earplugs so I did
the damp toilet tissue thing and it seems to work rather well, though
not as convenient to remove and replace as foam earplugs.

My subjective vote for best system goes to Sound Vision, which
*always* seems to be tweaked just right. I've been a high-end audio
enthusiast my whole life and I really appreciate clean sound with
punch. Volume is not everything!

Well I don't want to start a "sound system" war but when I said that
that the Sound Factory sound system is the best, I was comparing
clubs sound system.
Sound Vision is great but you can't even compare it to the Sound Factory
or Townsend or any other big club. I mean, it's a pure matter of power.
You couldn't use Sound Vision at Townsend, it's way too small.
For smaller events I agree that Sound Vision is great, mainly because
Ethan does a good job in tuning it.

Saying that I'm not a "high-end audio" expert at all, what I really liked about
the Sound Factory is that even if the volume is very high (and it was definely
high at C/U), you can stay in front of the speakers and survive. At 
Townsend if you stay in front of the speakers you gonna have pain in your ears.

Anyway I'll be at Wicked on Saturday so I'll give to Townsend another chance :)

BTW is Wicked in the same place where Rhythem is, or is it gonna be at King St ?

The cops don't get any money, themselves or the police department, for  
writing tickets--it's a common conflict of interest. At least that was 
what the Chief Of Police told the crowd at a lecture here in Davis.

 Or this information could also be used by any law enforcement
officials that might be on this list...  I don't mean to flame you by
any means, but don't you think that the cops probably know where the
FMRs are before half the people going there do?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

No flame taken.  And I sort of agree, that's was sorta the point of my post.
I personaly believe that there are many ways for the cops to find out if they
realy want to.  That said, I also could conceive of them not realy caring to
go out of their way to find out but e-mail making it so easy that it tips
the decision making scales in the favor of finding out.  I also have mixed
feelings about wheather there is an organized law inforcement interest.  If
they realy were after us they could easily shut it down, or at least aggresivly
try, which they don't.  The fmr's are held in at least 3 or 4 different
counties in many different city jurisdictions, that means some higher athority
would have to be involved to surveil and then report to which ever city/county
it were going to be held, at which time the police would be there before or
during our arrival because they would find out at the same time and have less
distance to travel to get there.  Or, they would at least come by and check
things out if they were going to "let" us have it.  That's what they do when
they find it and "let" us keep going.  That's another point, sometimes they
never come, sometimes they come very late/early like at 3 or 4 and if you've
ever been one of the people there when they first pull up they seem real
clueless as to what's going on.  It's obvious that they just stumbled on to
it and don't know what the hell is going on, unless they're better actors
then I give them credit for.  Then there are the couple times that they were
there early enough that it seems kind of suspicious.  Who's to say?

I heard from a friend I met at TF's "Feel the Groove" (which went off 
beautifully) that there is going to be a GG Park Rave today.  Can anyone 
confirm it?  I'd also like a time for it..  Thanks

 When Elizabet ( pre-baby ) started the South Bay lunch two years (?)
ago , it was just a way for SFRaves folks in the South Bay area to
meet and socialize for awhile. Any folks from the distant Northern
climes that managed to make it to the lunch were warmly greeted as
a pleasant surprise.

 There was a nice weekend lunch we did in Mountain View , in the park
next to Geoff White's apartment complex. Bob Ramstead's rave-in-a-bag
sound system was checked and approved by a passing park cop , so
we where able to have music during our conversation. Also ,it being
on the weekend , most of us didn't have to worry about work or classes.

 Maybe we can repeat something like that again , on a weekend , higher
north on the peninsula. We've had North Bay and South Bay lunches - how
about someone suggesting/finding a place for a weekday or weekend
Peninsula lunch?

Well, I wasn't planning on making any 'buttons' per se. I think that was 
someone else. The ones I'm doing are more of the laminate, back-stage 
pass format with ball chain or something similar (about credit card 
sized). I have about a dozen different ones and I'll pick 4 or 5 to 
actually produce depending on how I'm going to print them. Hell, maybe 
i'll start a series (collect all 12!) :). You can take a peek at one of 
them in the techno ftp site in the /pub/incoming directory under 
Badge.01.jpg.gz. Can someone try downloading this and tell me if it 
works? I want to make sure it's viewable before I upload any of the others.
Hopefully, I can get them ready by the end of the month.

For anyone else planning buttons, I have a Badge-A-Minit (actually my 
roomie does) as well that someone could probably use (I'll ask him).

Would anyone come to a lunch in the "Adult Park" (a park designed larger 
than life--for you dirty minded(: )  in Davis? We could do it on the 
weekend also. It's not *that* far from SF, esp. on weekends.

Well whatever they're called au'-tek-er...oh-tik'-re...(I personally just 
call 'em okra :) ), they were damn good. I wasn't sure how long the set 
was, but I think it was around 45 mins or so. I didn't recognize anything 
from Incunabula and it seemed like they were doing quite a bit of 
music-arranging on the fly. It was definitely a dancing set. There were 
only two or three actual pauses in the music. Most things just flowed 
from one piece right into the next. Nicely done. Unfortunately there were 
only a handful of people really dancing to them or even listening to 
them. Funny, but I noticed that several of these folks were either 
sfraves people or SpaceLabbers. Go figure. Regardless, my friend in 
Chicago (their Sunday show) got a late night call commanding him to 
attend.

Well, that was the bright side. Granted it may be a personal grudge, but 
I don't care for Sound Factory very much. The new interior was nice, but 
crowd doesn't seem to have improved. Clubs in D'troit are pretty sketchy, 
but I'd never been hassled too much there. Last December while going to 
visit my roomate on her last night bartending there, I got cold-cocked 
for eight nifty stitches right on the corner. Inside, I hate to say it, 
but it's really a meat-market. Carmen got physically bugged several times 
while we were there, and ended up really not enjoying the evening. So 
after Autechre (Okra) got off the stage we split. I suppose it's just a 
problem with the 'big weekend club' in general, but Sound Factory has 
been hurting for money since it opened and has basically taken any party 
to come its way (Saturday nights were really scary there last year) 
regardless of safety or attitude. Dave Dean's a nice guy and probably 
means well, but at the scale of SF, I think money tends to eclipse all 
other concerns. Sad, but we won't be back there any time soon.

Tribal Funk
===========

Hah!!  All you SFRaver weenies missed a real good one.    I know it
was located at College Of San Mateo (A killer space),  and very hard
to get to if you don't have a car,   but just the same,   it wasn't that
well attended my any SFRavers,   at least by those that I know.

They had big floor fans,   which made the dance vs Chill ratio way up
there,  which really allowed me to dance my rear end off.  Yowsa!!
What total positive energy it had.    Great crowd,  and the CSM police
were very present but not at all harrassing people at least from any
position I might have seen.    Security was by the Lions Security,  which
is in my books,  very good.    There was plenty of free water,   and
two dance areas fed by the same music source.

The Darwin Chamber provided killer ambient sounds,  and the lazer was
super great and killer,  and aimed AWAY from innocent eyes.

Unfortunately,  it wasn't that well attended,  which is VERY unfortunate
for Flash the Promoter.    Garth finished up the set,  with a killer funkey
set of tunes,   quite different than he did at Come/Unity last Wednesday.

Anyway,   Tribal Funk was very good,  in a great killer space,   good
security,  and towards the end everyone gathered in a great big circle
running in and out,   clapping hands,  in one big cynergetic dance
that was pure unity,  good vibes,  and great fun for all.

There's a theory that goes something along the lines of, information
has no value in of itself, its value only exists in the delta, in the
passing of this information from one incarnation to another.  A
corollary is that information easily transmitted is often undervalued.
If you knew the ending to a murder mystery before reading the book,
you probably wouldn't waste your time reading the rest of it.  It's
that suspense, that tension, that gives the ending its punch.  And
in much the same way, the thrill of attending an outdoor party can
be directly proportional to the effort expended to find it.

The Wicked full moon parties can be very rewarding experiences.  But
their magic is hardly unique - there are other outdoor parties, and
they often hit the same level.  And if you can't find any that suit
you, and you have the energy - throw your own! Lots of people on this
list have - and I've collected a few of their posts on the subject
on the archive site in its own directory.

to decompress it with gzip (and yes I *did* do a binary ftp transfer,
I've been around the block a few times :)

I agree.  Autechre's set was noticeably short, but it was a very high
quality presentation.  I was getting into the music so much that I wasn't
concentrating on on the exact pieces played. However, I did notice that
they definitely played an extended version "Crystel" (off of Artificial
Intelligence) where they really s-l-o-w-e-d i-t d-o-w-n!  Way Excellent!!

Who spun before the show? That was some raging techno, with alot of the AI
kind of sound!

I would say there were at least 100 people that were watching/dancing to
the performance.  The club types generally caught on that a performance was
going on and very few stayed in to watch.  Although, a few clueless types
walked through the crowd "on the scam," apparently wondering why most
people were facing the stage. (In all fairness, the stage was sometimes
dark during the show and a drunk person may not have understood something
was going on based upon this lack of a clue, I mean, cue. :) )  SFRavers I
knew in attendance were Johnny T., Sin, Brian Sassone, and Ovid. Sorry that
I didn't recognize you.  Maybe we'll meet in the near future.

>Well, that was the bright side. Granted it may be a personal grudge, but 
>I don't care for Sound Factory very much. The new interior was nice, but 
>crowd doesn't seem to have improved...

Yeah.  After Autechre, the room quickly filled with clubbers and the vibe
basically went down the drain. Fortunately, some vibe existed due to the
minority presence of raver-types. :)  And, I'm sorry, but who ever spun
(Buck?) was playing way too housey and commercial stuff; it was painful for
me to remain there another 2 hours! (But, I do think the sound system at
Sound Factory was very, very clean...and a "good" kind of loud.)

And, did you know that some special guests were in attendance?  Yes! 
Daniel Ash and David J. came to see Autechre, but were a little too late to
see 'em.  I only know this because this cool, Iranian guy (Mehdi) from New
Yawk, who we met in line, recognized Daniel and went up and chatted with
him.  To his surprise, Daniel offered him a hit of his spleef (which the
nearby security guard ignored :) ).  Johnny went up and asked Daniel (in
his typical fashion) "why are you here?," and he said that they were in
S.F. to record a Love and Rockets album.  It looked to me like Daniel and
David were having a *great* time!  It will be interesting to see if the
S.F. scene will influence their music.

I didn't catch that. Which AI release is that on? The comp? didn't grab 
that one.

Wasn't that DJ Lewis (who knows someone's cousin who's friends with a guy 
who's sister once roomed with a woman who dated the uncle of a neighbor 
of an occasional contributor to the Orb)? There wasn't much announcement 
of him. In fact there wasn't much announcement whatsoever. Not like there 
ever is, anyway, but...

I was talking to Brian for a little while, but lost track of him before I 
got to meet you all. Yeah, there were a lot of people watching, but no 
more than a handful actually dancing. Not that it's a crime or anything. 
I thought they played an amazing set and wished they could have looked 
out and seen a lot more people moving. I think it had a lot to do with 
the setting and SF's usual crowd. Had someone closer to the genre 
promoted the show (hard to say *promoted* as the only non-Internet notice 
of the show was a flyer dropped off a few days ago), I think the crowd would 
have been much more active. Hopefully WaxTrax/TVT will realize that the 
listeners of the AI series are generally different than their usual 
audience.

EEK! No way! I'm not necessarily a big L&R fan anymore but that puts the 
big voodoo on a weird passing thought I had during the show. I was most 
likely gone before they arrived, but during Okra's set I spied some guy 
that for some reason made me think of David J. Just popped into my head, 
dunno why. Line up folks. JMAR predicts twoannahalf minutes into *your* 
future! Now serving number 23! Number 23!

As for a *great* time, my ex-roomie was in a band that opened for L&R 
several years ago. So the story goes, he watched Daniel bottom a full 
fifth of vodka in under five minutes. Them boys is s-e-r-i-o-u-s.

JMAR. You will meet a tall, dark stranger and he will ask you for FMM 
directions... :)

Hmm, that's where I feared the problem would be. I think I'll just let 
Brian compress it this time. If I may ask, what flavor of computer are 
you using? I'm using a Mac and am trying to get it into a vanilla jpeg 
format that everyone can view. You may have been around the block, but as 
far as inter-platform transfers go, I keep trippin on the dang curb.

  Here's another idea.  Think of this as "in addition to" the other 
plans, not "instead of."
  At the next GG Park rave, I will bring button machine and all necessary 
implements, some printed-out SFRaves logos (lots of different designs), 
and coloring pens for kustomizing.  Then folks can make their own, spiffy 
them up, and turn them into badges.

I used gzip on both a Unix and DOS machine and it didn't work, so
presumably something didn't happen right with the initial file
compression.  No biggee . . .

I just moved to the Bay Area a few weeks ago from Boston via L.A. & 
Tokyo. This is my first posting to the list but I have been reading it 
for awhile and have been involved with alternative culture 
internationally for the past 4-5 years. I'm an ambient/experimental DJ 
and former General Manager & Program Director of WZBC-FM, Boston.

I saw Autechre on Fri. They were very good but the crowd was lame at the 
Sound Factory. Oh well what do you expect. Lets jus hope that we start 
seeing acts of this quality at our "underground" events.

 Re the Sound Factory Sound System- Kind of like Las Vegas or the Digital 
Superhighway- Flashy, lots of hype but little _elegance_

Re: Love and Rockets-

I entered the venue at the same time as the Rockets and told them that 
there was a good band playing. They had wangled there way in for free by 
name dropping to the guy at the door. Thats cool... They didn't seem to 
hip to techno/house/rave culture but they knew what was up and seemed to 
enjoy the quality performance. 

I was originally going to go to Tribal Funk's Feel The Groove but I 
didn't have a ride. I had hoped that the Sound Factory would have been 
tolerable after the Autechre performance but the hardcore booze/pickup 
vibe drove me from the venue immediately following the performance. Oh well.

Hope to start being more active on the scene soon. Lots of LOVE.....
Look forward to conspiring with kindred spirits.

I heard (not confirmed) that they were fined due to not having the proper
construction permit during the time of their renovation.

Wicked was all THAT!!!

I didn't get there in time to hear Garth's set (no biggie), but I sure as
fuck heard Jeno, Thomas, and Markie (The MAN) Mark.

Jeno's set - Brilliant!  He was in a good mood, so he was less experimental
than usual, but a killer set nonetheless.  Jeno, of late, is getting his
form, and stride back!  He worked the decks and showed why he is still a
force to be reconed with.  However, I was dismayed at the fact that he did
not use the third turntable.  3 TT mixing is the shit.

Thomas' set - Good one!  I hardly hear Thomas anymore except for Wicked, so
it was a pleasure to hear him mix it up!

Markie's set - Markie, bugger off!!!  Before Markie went on I *told* him,
"Take it easy, ease into your set, give my brain a chance to adjust"  and
*yes*, he listened...payed no attention...then he FUCKED IT UP!!!  Goddam
Markie!!!  He played shit from dimension triple D.  And was relentless to
boot!  He got those highs cranked, then bottomed them out with
bass...motherfuckers were tranced out (can I get a witness Geoff), and
really stupid.  It was great.  As I previously predicted trip-hop is in the
*house*.  Just ask Markie!

Wicked is proving to be alot more than anything I previously gave credit
to.  There are hella friendly people there, lots of *flavor*, and
*excellent* mix of people (old/new skool, newcomers, gays/straights/bi's,
every color under the rainbow...in other words a *REAL* party!).

Previous accolades aside, the crowd did have soem strange energy.  There
are a couple of people who bug the hell outta me even when I catch a
glimpse of.  I can *only* imagine what they think of me.  In any case, I
had one dude bug out in front of me, and it was hard to ignore (I despise
tweekers).  The others are denizens of a different sort.  Despite this
minor pet peeve, everyone seemd to have a good time.

Shit to watch:  Stippers. I do love to watch them at Boogie and even at a
party or two.  But when they come as a posse, and get that good belly
going, and booty shaking at 200 bpm (bumps&grinds per minute), it's time to
call in the cavalry!

It's really good to see sooooo many sistahs out these days. Renews my faith
in what this shit is all about.

It is also cool to see soo many happy people out.  Finally the smiles are
returning.  After last weeks fiasco at FMM, this event erased any doubt
that the *boys* are back.  Wicked!!!

FMM/WIcked:
===========
These are two seperate events that just happen to include, *at times*,
similar personnel.  The vibe is completely different, and so is the crowd.
I dunno wassup with people bundling the two just because some people are in
both camps.  I think it is unfair to the repective parties (i.e Wicked or
FMM) to bundle them.  I think FMM is a good vehicle for Wicked promo, but I
would just as well leave it at that and not make any additional corrolaries
since they do try to make each event stand on it's own merits.

Pax,
John


P.S.  Markie should be placed under HOUSE arrest!!!!

	actually it was discovered that japanese yakuza were using both
	Thunder Bay and 1015 as a front for selling the very illegal
	and expensive Blue LEDs. They had been trafficking them for years.
	The FBI as about to bust both locations however during their 
	investigations they uncovered several CIA agents which were involved.
	They were unable to determine whether the CIA was actually 
	investigating or if they were the criminals themselves so the FBI
	collaborated with Interpol and MOSSAD and together investigated and
	found that the CIA actually were *buying* the Blue LEDs to use in
	their own espionage efforts in Japan to uncover a Yakuza plot
	to corner the market on illegal Blue LEDs.

	in the end the Blue LED market crumbled and the syndicates lost 
	interest in running their front clubs- 1015 and Thunder Bay so they
	took off to another city to set up business.

	be careful of those expensive and illegal Blue LEDs. they have
	already caused the shutdown of two expensive and poorly ventillated
	nightclubs.

Subject: 1015 in trouble?
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

After checking around it seems that 1015 was shut down due to, now dig
this, not having permits for after-hours (could be why they've been sweated
for awhile)!  And they have been operating for SOME TIME without permits.
The catalyst for all the hoopla? having a party where people were on the
roof.

So, as you can guess, after hours will be held in other spots.

For more flakiness...some people (read promoters) have decided NOT to do
afterhours whatever, and others have decided to jump in.  Since the shit is
in such a deep state of flux, there is little reason to name names (esp.
since everyone keeps changing their minds on a daily basis).

Anyone check out the after hours at 1190 Folsom?  I was NOT gonna go,
primarily because the people doing the promoting (flyering [???]) didn't
know SHIT about the party.  Hell, if you're handing out flyers, the least
you can do is know WHAT you're promoting for.  I guess some people need a
crutch to get into parties for free; I think it's a cheeseball tactic.  So
if anyone went, lemme know.

Hows that DNA horse doing. Any good?

Pax,
John

Wed - ComeUnity - I arrived at the Sound Factory with much trepidation;
I've never had a good time there before so i was prepared to just
checkitoutandleave.  I got there early, around 1, and things seemed to be 
going off pretty well: Jeno was doin' fine, the sound system was good, and 
most of the CU regulars were there.  To me, the layout of the Sound F. is
kind of cold and divisive with too many separate rooms and a long hallway 
to a barren chill space.  But by 3 the place had filled up nicely with 
friendly, happy people.  Although not as magical as other CU's I've been 
to, I ended up having a pretty good time, staying until 6-ish

Sat - Wicked - Still feeling a bit drained from CU, I dealt with my
weekend-club-crowd phobia by not arriving until 4.  This party was 
definately going off full blast when I got there, and the vibe steadily 
improved as the less devoted and less enhanced drifted off.  One thing I 
really liked about Townsend was the lighting - stimulating and not 
overdone, and the entire space was light enough so that for once I was 
able to actually *see* everyone's faces within 20 feet of me.  I felt that
this really helped keep the spirit alive.   Martin - if you're reading 
this - please consider ways to lighten up your parties a bit.  At the last 
Gathering we did an experiment and discovered that you could not discern a 
smile on a face that was more than 6 feel away.  People can't feed off of 
each other's energy if they can't see each other.  Anyway, Wicked 
definately rocked and Townsend's great sound more than compensated for 
their anal security personnel.

Sun. - Bulletproof Boat Party - Fun as usual, although for me, the music 
was basically horrible.  I'm just not much of a fan of retro 70's disco, 
hip hop, or acid jazz played through a lousy sound system.  Still, it's 
hard not to have a good time partying on a boat with friends with the Bay
Area's glittering panorama as a backdrop.  But until the music starts 
coming closer to my tastes, this party will have to remain a 
once-every-few-months novelty.
  
It sounds like the FunkyTechnoTribe people are going to throw another
freebee at the Bandshell this weekend; they've been getting postponed
due to weather but seem determined to do another one on Saturday "rain
or shine".  Call their info line - 4152668215 for updates.  

ComeUnity and Wicked were really good parties but I can sense that I'm 
starting to force it a bit.  I think I need to be outdoors more.  Nothing 
beats raving with nature, so with the weather getting warmer I'm probably 
going to start holding out for outdoor events.   We'll see.

I think the reason that the cops haven't pursued fmr's as agressively as
they can is because fmrs are (to my knowledge) peaceful and not as large
as many city raves and such.  What can the do to us if we are on a public
beach away from civilization.  If we are just dancing around and invovled
in the music, I don't see the problem...except for parking illegally.  and
curfew for those under 18.

hi lee, sfr folx,
well, thought i'd tell my story of the week too. i really like c/u,
definitely like the musick more. it is this mix of house-y stuff on top
with some HARD beats underneath. what do people call this ? progressive ?
whatever it is called, i likes. the c/u dj's were playing it and so were
the wicked folx. there is also this song which is hip-hoppy and somewhere
in the middle it just goes 1/2-time. does anyone know who is that ?
so c/u was good, tho' could not stay that late - had to come in
before noon into work. did go to s faktory on fri. i really dug autechre,
with their hard beats and ethereal lines. i like that tension  which is set
up this way. as for the dance afterwards, yes, i agree i did feek like usda
prime cut ( well, not really, i think women get more crusied that way than
men do ) so that kinda spoiled the atmosphere a lot. tried to meet some
people with mixed success. as for the musick , it was very inconsistent,
at times really good, then next really bad. could not really get a groove
going. so was tired and unsatisfied , like after 5 hrs. of foreplay!
anyway, wicked on sat. definitely went off, as most people have already said.
the afterhrs did not happen at 1190, so went to dna instead. that was
GREAT. i loved the visuals - btw, how come there are fewer visuals at parties?
they had cool visuals, including some stuff with terrance mckenna. and the
musick! the musick was really good, again this hard trance over ambient or
house. so what's up, did several dj's get new crates of musick? it sounds good
tho' am not complaining. there were not that many people, but it seemed to
pick up again around noon when i left on sun.
take care/shalom/(se)X hits the spot

Yup, progressive house :). Not as happy or as wailin or as funky, as
regular house. It has a hard edge to it. I like playing progressive
house around 128-132 bmp. That's what *really* kicks my butt. Simon
played a good progressive set at c/u. He even played some of the same
vinyl I own :).

I've been wondering this too! When I got started in the scene, there
were a lot more visuals. Gimme a few months and I'm going to
do-it-yourself with a nice high-powered HeNe laser. I *like* lasers.
If people ain't gonna do them at parties, I'm bringing my own.

I was interested in helping out in anyway, especially for the California 
Hemp Initiative (but I heard that I need to a US Citizen in order to help 
with sign ups, so I can't do that.)

But lemme know either way if you need help or not.  Thanks

  I don't feel very sorry for Ira of 1015.
He used to be an umderground party promoter,before he started Das Klub/1015
- but after he started to establish himself at 1015,he started his bad habit
of calling the police with the locations of underground parties that
were held on the same nights as parties at 1015.What goes around comes around..

Dear Friends on the Electronic Frontier:
 
I have some good news to share with you.  Senator Leahy just sent me a

Dear Jerry,
 
Thank you for forwarding to me the many thoughtful and informative messages
you received over the Internet regarding the Administration's recent
approval of an escrowed encryption standard, known as the Clipper Chip.
 
Many of the messages urge Congress to hold hearings to review the
Administration's Clipper Chip standard.  In fact, I intend to hold a
hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the Law, which
I chair, to consider the important issues raised by the Clipper Chip.  I
will let you know when a date for the hearing is scheduled.
 
Thank you again.
 
Sincerely,

Toad-Smoking Gains on Toad-Licking Among Drug Users

***

Toxic, Hallucinogenic Venom, Squeezed, Dried and Puffed, Has Others 
Turned Off

SAN FRANCISCO -- For the record, Mojo Nixon says neither he nor any 
members of his rock band, Mojo Nixon and the Toad Lickers, has ever 
actually licked a toad.

Still, with a name like that, Mr. Nixon's band can hardly help but 
attract attention from what authorities say is a small but growing 
segment of the drug culture that has taken up the bizarre practice of 
ingesting venom squeezed from live toads.  "People come up to us all 
the time and ask if we get high licking toads," says Mr. Nixon, who 
calls the very idea "insane."

Mojo knows.  He read something about toad-licking in the underground 
press about four years ago, and his band, the Burger Eaters, became 
the Toad Lickers.  Although tales of getting a buzz from lapping toad 
squeezings have circulated through underground lore since the 1960s, 
drug authorities on both sides of the law agree on one thing: Toad-
licking is not just weird but dangerous.

Warty Hoppers

Toad venom contains dozens of chemically active compounds, including 
enough poison to kill dogs that sometimes catch the warty little 
hoppers and try to eat them.  "I would think you could poison 
yourself pretty badly before you got high licking toads," says Andrew 
T. Well, an ethnopharmacologist at the University of Arizona's 
College of Medicine in Tuscon.

Thus, after a spurt of experimentation, toad-licking tapered off.

Toad-*smoking*, on the other hand, seems to be less risky and is on 
the rise, says Cecil Schwalbe, a research ecologist for the Interior 
Department.  Dr. Schwalbe says the heat from smoking venom appears to 
break down the toxins while retaining the psychedelics.  "The people 
who believe in better living through chemistry found out you could 
get the same hallucinogenic reaction from smoking toads as from 
licking them," he says.

Dr. Weil, a physician and drug-culture researcher, says that when he 
and a fellow researcher smoked dried venom from a Colorado River 
toad, it produced "a sense of wonder and well-being."

Dr. Weil's report, published two years ago in an obscure 
anthropological journal, Ancient Mesoamerica, apparently sent a smoke 
signal through the drug underground.

Arizona wildlife authorities recently raided the home of an 
unlicensed reptile-dealer near Tuscon and discovered dozens of 
football-sized Colorado-River toads sitting placidly in the man's 
living room.  (State law does allow possession of up to 10 toads if 
you have a fishing license.)  John Romero, law-enforcement program 
manager for the Arizona Department of Game and Fish, says his agents 
puzzled awhile over why anyone would have toads around the house.  
"Then the light came on," Mr. Romero says.

On the Southern California drug market these days, drug agents say a 
healthy toad can fetch up to $8.  One alleged dealer was arrested for 
illegal trading in wildlife last fall after he ran an ad in the 
University of Arizona student newspaper seeking a toad supply.

"Cane Toads." a 1989 documentary film that describes smoking toad 
venom in Australia, has become a cult-video favorite.  Toad-licking 
also came up recently on the television series "LA Law" (which 
mistakenly showed a bullfrog instead of a toad) and in an MTV "Beavis 
and Butt-head" cartoon.  "The show reflects what's going on in the 
youth culture," explains a "Beavis and Butt-head" spokeswoman.

Still, the whole toad thing is so bizarre that even critics are hard 
pressed to maintain a straight face.  South Carolina lawmakers 
giggled when a bill was introduced four years ago that would have 
made the state the first to outlaw toad-licking.  Rep. Patrick B. 
Harris, finding the practice "repulsive but amusing," proposed 
sentencing violators to 60 hours of public service in a local zoo.

Toads made the news again last month when California drug agents 
arrested Robert Shepard, a 41-year-old Boy Scout troop leader in 
Angels Camp, Calif., about 100 miles east of San Francisco.  Mr. 
Shepard was charged with several drug offenses, including possession 
of bufotenine, a chemical constituent of toad venom and a recognized 
hallucinogen.  The agents also impounded Mr. Shepard's four Colorado 
River toads -- Brian, Peter, Hans, and Franz.

Gregory Elam, the officer who made the arrest, says Mr. Shepard was 
so contrite he helped drug agents make a training video showing how 
venom is squeezed from kidney-shaped parotoid glands on the back of a 
live toad, then dried and smoked.  "It was pretty disgusting," says 
Mr. Elam, who has a big photograph of a toad on his office wall.  
"This is not something you would brag about to your mama."

Mr. Shepard won't talk to a reporter about toads or anything else.  
But James Webster, his attorney, says he himself had never heard of 
toad-smoking.  "I've heard of a princess kissing a toad," says Mr. 
Webster, misremembering the story of the frog prince.  "I guess these 
days she'd be busted, too."

Illegal Drug

Narcotics agents say Mr. Shepard may be the first person ever 
arrested on toad-smoking charges.  Bufotenine, as a hallucinogen, has 
been on federal and state dangerous-drug lists for years, and its 
possession is illegal.

In his Ancient Mesoamerica article, Dr. Weil reported that toad skins 
and artifacts depicting toads have turned up at Indian ceremonial 
sites in Mexico and Central America dating back more than a thousand 
years.  The researcher and others speculate that Mayans, Aztecs and 
other ancients may have used toad venom as an intoxicant in their 
rites.

Dr. Weil and his co-author, Wade Davis, theorize that the Colorado 
River toad has become the smokers' choice not because of bufotenine, 
but because it contains large amounts of the chemical compound 5-MeO-
DMT, a powerful psychoactive drug.

Experts describe the toad as a shy reptile found mostly in the 
Sonoran Desert in Northern Mexico and in the southern parts of 
Arizona and California.  The toads live underground most of the year, 
emerging only during the brief rainy season in midsummer.

The Colorado River toad, Dr. Weil says, is a virtual psychedelic 
factory, whose venom produces a 20-minute high that is so intense it 
can be frightening to the uninitiated.  "I've seen people take one 
deep puff and fall over backward as the exhale," he says.

'A Magical Slap'

Toad puffers, Dr. Weil says, usually are unresponsive for five 
minutes or more, making little noises until they open their eyes.  
Mr. Davis, a Washington anthropologist, calls the effect "a magical 
slap in the face."

That may be pleasing to toad-smokers, but it could mean problems for 
toads in the wild.  Dr. Weil says he has already received telephone 
calls from Californians eager to visit southern Arizona, where the 
critters are plentiful, to catch Colorado River toads.  "This looks 
like it could be a trend, and the toad is the one that will suffer," 
says Mr. Romero, the Arizona Game and Fish official worried about 
depleting the toad population.

The toad's protector, say officials, will probably be environmental 
laws, not drug laws.  California, for example, began implementing a 
law last week that makes it a misdemeanor to possess any of the 
shrinking population of Colorado River toads in the state.

"Eventually," says Mr. Elam, the Angels Camp drug agent, "you'll 
probably see a much stiffer penalty for possession of a toad than for 
a controlled substance.  The environmentalists have more clout than 
the cops."

At the last Feel the Groove, there were really good visual stuff.  
Although I have not seen impressive visual presentations, I was impressed 
with the lasers and video/?fractals? some other people were showing in 
another hall.

When I was dancing, the lasers made circles around a group of people.  
Being inside the circle and being surrounded by the lasers gave me a very 
hypnotic feeling.  I love the lasers too!

Maybe he should be brought up on copywright infringement for using the

Greetings Ravers and Hempsters,

As you know, on Saturday March 12, there is
a benefit for the California Hemp Initiative:
   KINDNESS
(510) 814-2402
(415) 487-7655

In addition, on the same day, there is a classic
movie double header at the U.C. Theatre:
   Dr. Strangelove  &  Lolita
(510) 843-6267

It will be a long day, but I think General Jack D.
Ripper and Humbert Humbert would want me to immerse
myself in each of these events.

Say, will anyone be making SFRaves buttons at KINDNESS?

 I'd really make it to the lunch on thurs., unfortunately I go to
school in Oregon and live in Salinas (near Monterey).  Is there anyway I
can get into things by being so far away?  I really like the way people
like you, Tamara, Capt.Crunch seem to be so into it and  care about what
is going on and I'd like to be a part of that also.  I just wish I had a
way of maintaining some sort of contacts that I can talk to when I'm not
at my terminal here at school.  These lunches seem to be a great way to
meet a lot of those people who are into the vibe-- not those hunter/gather
types who cruise raves like a meat market.

Well, like you, I am from the Bay Area (although much closer to San 
Francisco, being only 15 minutes south) but go to school elsewhere (UCLA)
so I'm not really a big part of things up there but I certainly try to be
whenever I am home on breaks (Your Sister's House on March 31st, y'all!) so
there are ways to do it. :)

This seems like a popular heading lately, but I'm writing a paper on
raves, and I need to know how people view rave music and rave culture. 
Where did it come from?  Where is it going?  Could it be related to the
sort of mocking of commercialism found in pop art?  Is techno the next in
a long line of deviations from a norm, or is it the norm itself,
simplified almost beyond recognition?

Any ideas?  Write me..

Subject: Greening*Newbie*FMR*Badges
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Interesting, all this talk of "newbies," Greening of America,"  and "Badges."
Being someone who is a 9 month newbie to Sfraves, having read "Greening" when
it was first published (and still have my copy), and going through what many
of you are talking about as it pertains to the Rave community. It has been 
slightly more difficult  for me  to  begin coming to the raves. I was your
classic 42 year-old, lost-love-generation academic, divorced, mid-life
melt-down kinda guy.  A friend of a friend, introduced me to a 49 year old
Doctor who prescribed two-pills, dance all night at a rave, and call him in
the morning. "Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you," or at least
found you again! I want you all to know I've gotten every conceivable
reaction at the raves.  For example, "I'm not gonna give you a flyer cause
you look like a narc," "What are YOU doing here?" to  "I wish my dad was
here!" "I've seen you at other parties and I wanted to come up and say
hello!"--Garth, and Rick Preston always make a point to say Hi!-because they
know I drive up and back from Monterey each weekend, and that I love this
music. My friend, Forrest and I have taken to calling ourselves the "Monterey
Rave Posse." We are  happy when the FMR's come to BD beach, cause it's only
40 minutes away to home. This last rain-soaked FMR was particularly blissful.
I'll probably put SFraves-MRP on my badge. Come up and say hello. The
"Consciousness III" chapter from THE GREENING OF AMERICA, meant a lot to me.
Why the movement died before  is because we automatically excluded people who
were, different, older,  and not "in." I suggest that if you think your scene
will always be here, I offer this warning: That if you don't include, and
nourish others, and bring them in with love and kindness, the music will die.
 We blamed it all on the establishment until we became it, and "filthy Lucre"
$$$$$$ taught us not to care so much. And we finally gave up who we were. I
did for about ten years. At the raves I've remembered what it was like to
care, to believe, to free up my soul through dance, and stand in awe of the
music coming out of those big black square boxes. Magic boxes, with magicians
juggling spinning black wheels in front of them. All this has charmed my
soul, and it keeps my feet dancing, and my toes tapping.(during the week
also) For someone who began with underground radio in the 60"s, the Grammy
Awards" were a sad commentary on what happens when money gets its hands at
the throat of Artists and Musicians. We should be thankful there isn't a
catagory called, "Best New Rave Single." Remember to Remember--"To Rave is to
Affirm." See ya at the parties--Robert (MRP)

is celebrating its one year anniversary tonight. This is a FREE party, 
and it will be at 10 - hangin'-by-a-thread- 15 Folsom.  ;)

I believe the lineup will be Simon, Garth and Thomas, but I'm not 100% and
I don't know the order.  We'll be doing a show in the "sun" room.

See you down there!

Together info# 979-8825 for the whole scoop.

I disagree.  In the first instance, eveything I said was my opinion.
Calling someobody an *asshole* is can always be considered subjective.
Next, I would not be so quick to hop to his defense based on him not being
able to defend hinself.  After all, has Halim been here to defend slams
against Sharon?  Or Preston to defend any slams against his party?  Or are
many of the other promoters avaialble here to defend their
parties/policies?  SO why is it so special for Ira?  It *isn't* so special
for him, that's why.

My opinion stands;  He is an asshole, and I would never deal with him.  If
you *knew* how he does business you would could form your own opinion.  In
any case, time to let this one go.

Pax,
John

Subject: It's been too quiet
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

I found this amusing anecdote on rec.music.gdead when I was doing research 
for Atomic Dog and have been since looking for an excuse to repost it:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I am absolutely not making this incident up; 
in fact I have it all on videotape.  The tape is 
from a local TV news show in Oregon, which 
sent a reporter out to cover the removal of a 
45-foot, eight-ton dead whale that washed up 
on the beach.  The responsibility for getting rid 
of the carcass was placed with the Oregon 
State Highway Division, apparently on the 
theory that highways and whales are very 
similar in the sense that both are large objects.
So anyway, the highway engineers hit upon a 
plan (remember, I am not making this up) to 
blow up the whale with dynamite. The thinking 
was that the whale would be blown into small 
pieces, which would then be eaten by seagulls 
and fish.  That would be that, a textbook whale 
removal.  So they moved the spectators back up 
the beach, put a half-ton of dynamite next to 
the whale and set it off.  What follows, on the 
videotape, is one the most priceless events in 
the history of the universe.  First you see the 
whale carcass disappear in a huge blast of 
smoke and flame.  Then you hear the happy 
spectators shouting "Yayy!" and "Whee!" Then, 
suddenly, the crowd's tone changes. You hear 
a new sound like "splud, splap", and you hear 
a woman's voice shouting "Here come pieces 
of...OH MY GOD!"  Something smears the camera 
lens.  Later, the reporter explains: "The humor 
of the entire situation suddenly gave way to a 
run for survival as huge chunks of whale blubber 
rained down everywhere."  One piece caved in 
the roof of a car parked more than a quarter 
of a mile away!!  Remaining on the beach were 
several large rotting whale sections the size 
of condominiums.  There was no sign of the 
seagulls who had no doubt had permanently 
relocated to Brazil.
-------------------------------------------------------------
ObRave: Some of the best parties happen on beaches.

Yep.  I live in Oregon.  I lived here then.  It really happened; I've
seen the video on the news.  

The Highway Department (actually the Department of Transportation) is
responsible for beaches, because in Oregon (motto: Things look
different here) all beaches are considered state highways, even though
motorized vehicles are banned on most beaches most of the time.

This was a bizzare consequence of actions by a Governor over fifty
years ago, and was done to preserve public access to beaches.

So the whale was their problem.  It was different opening the paper to
headlines like "Transportation Department to Dispose of Rotting Whale
with Dynamite" and "Giant Chunks of Whale Still Rotting on Beach."  I
can't remember the exact words, but something like that.

Oh, and in case anyone cares, I've been to the mall where Tonya
Harding practices, it's right accross the freeway from the "New Hope
Community Church," effectively a religion mall.  The combined
facilities offer one-stop shopping for all your secular and spiritual
needs.  I've never voted for Bob Packwood.  I met Ken Kesey one time
in Eugene, he was nice but in kind of a hurry.

Tonya Harding practices in Clackamas Town Center???  I'd liken it to,
oh, say, Orinda, fer all the sf-bay types.  (Actually it's like a
mega-stonestown :-). 

I agree about New Hope.  The first time I saw the giant neon cross I
wanted to steal it because it was so...giant and neon.  I can't
explain it.  Sort of like New Order's "Touched by the Hand of God"
mixed with "I'm going straight to Heaven" by MC 900 foot Jesus.
REALLY tacky.  I've never seen anything else like it.  (I hear the
place has arena seating on the inside).

Oregon.  There's no place like it.  (BTW, how are schools doing now, a
few years after measure 5?  I got out while there was still time :-)

Measure 5 has done virtually nothing compared to numerous hacks and cuts from
the UC and the CSU budgets.  Here at Oregon State Univer.  it made a dent
in our programs.  The journalism dept. was cut and supplies and copies profs
gladly handed out now have to be bought.  Don't you just love taxpayers
and government concern for our educational systems?  What a joke!

im currently working on an article about women in the rave/nightlife
scene - promoters, djs, magazine editors, designers, anything. im
curious as to whether women are discouraged from getting into this
particular field , and if they feel any kind of different/special
treatment from men in their same field. 

id appreciate any stories that you (or a friend) might have to tell
regarding this!

	Amusing note to stories of whale demolition:

	When I was about 15, I wanted to be a marine biologist.  I lived 
in Portland at the time, and got hooked up with one of the professors at 
Portland State who studied whales.  One of her fields of interest was 
beached whales.  The deal she had worked out was that she got to hear 
about and study any whale, as long as her crew disposed of it.  Most of 
the whales were 20-30 feet long, and small charges and shovels usually 
did the trick (plus warning the locals that great white sharks would come 
from miles around).  Interesting hobby for any young boy :)

	Usually, we'd plant charges just big enough to break the thing 
up, and drag the pieces into the surf.  I'll spare you all the details.  
The point of all this was, I got a call to come out to the coast one 
day.  There was a huge whale, and the Highway Division (I believe this is 
because Oregon beaches are technically public thoroughfares.  Stops 
developing.) wanted our advice on how to get rid of the thing before 
tourist weekend.

	So we told them to use explosives.  Never thought they'd use that 
much.  Believe me, they put enough TNT into that thing to blow up the 
Sears Tower.  I have never seen something so, well, gory, in my life as 
500-pound chunks of whale attempting to reach escape velocity.

	Needless to say, that was the end of the Cetacean Detonation 
Project.  Quite soon after, I found a more useful and healthy hobby.

	ObRave: None.  Just thought I'd confirm today's wierdness.

It totally sucked.  It was felt far worse at PSU while I was still
there... I was a chem undergrad (started at OSU, ended at PSU as a
Chem/CS double major) and the chemistry department at PSU was HACKED.
It was really sad... professors were trying to recruit undergrads to
go with them to other schools.  (The professor I was doing undergrad
research with, John Golbeck, was one of the first to go and he advised
me to get out ASAP, even to the point of offering to get me admitted
as one of his RA's.  Unfortunately since he went to Nebraska-Lincoln 
I was less than enthusiastic :-)

PSU lost a lot of great faculty due to short-sighted oregon politics.
I'm really sorry for venting vitriol to the whole list, but I still
have bitter memories over what happened up there, and the current
state of CA's edu system looks a lot like what Oregon's did before 
everything went to shit.

Yeah.  It's a compilation, circa 1993, which includes a tune by Sir Alex
Paterson ("Loving You Live").  

Snatch it!

Well I was a thinkin' the other day. Carmen (my girlfriend) is gonna turn 
21 on the 25th this month and we'd already planned on having a small 
getogether of some of our friends during the day on Saturday the 26th. So 
why not make a sfraves lunch of it? 

I was hoping to have a bigger party, but that seems to be the night of 
Irresistable Force and FMR (which we plan on attending, as I'm sure many of 
you are) so that's out. We've got my floor of the loft and/or hopefully (my 
landlord owes me big time) the use of the roof deck (very nice - already 
has sound). It'd probably go from noon til early evening depending on 
what happens.

I'm in SOMA near tenth and Howard. e-mail me if you're interested. I'll 
post again, when I find out more.

This year is finally starting to get moving.  Alot of after hours are
opening up, some are *trying* to open up, and all in all it looks like
there will be more variety for Sundays as well as Saturday's.

It is *GREAT* to see Ivan & Lacey do the Equinox party again.  Sweetness!!!
This party was TRULY one of THE BEST parties of '92 (the first Equinox that
is)! And it promises to do the same this year.  With that lineup there will
be no misses!  And, it's good to see James get some play!  Right on!!!

There is some more news on the after hours front, but things are so hectic,
and the situation changes daily, nobody knows wassup...but things should be
clarified sometime after 3 p.m. Friday, so stay tuned.

This will be a good year!

Pax,
John

	Hi, All I have a friend in L.A. who wants to film a music
	video at a rave, it needs to be a good one with plenty of
	lights ( a good club venue would work)  If you have a show
	(or know of a show) that will have lots of lights (lasers,
	etc.) they're shooting in video and 16mm so they need light.

	Give me a call, (or e-mail) and tell me how to get in contact
	with the promoter.

	Please distribute this on the appropriate socal list as well,


				thanks,

Saturday, Kindness has pulled together a great lineup, and I think
it's supposed to cost no more than $10, so go!

Saturday, April 2 - Earth House Hold  415/267-6193
        This is from another flyer of theirs . . .

             dance is the spirit
             love is the harmony
             music is the source

             The scene in San Francisco is seeing some troubled times.

             to throw a legal and permitted rave is now next to impossible.
             As far as I see it there is no blame to be given, but there
             is something to be done.  And there are some good parties to
             be held.  How important is the community to you?  The music?
             We got a mailing list going of people that like the vibe they
             get from a room of moving, dancing, smiling people.  Can you
	    	         dig it?  415.267.6193     -- earth house hold --

Wednesdays -- M2/Spring Cleaning March 1994
       Jellybear, Jay-J and Chris Lum  2260 Van Ness @ Vallejo

Thursdays -- Blend -- 540 Howard St -- 9pm to 3 am
       Funk/House/Trance/French/Reggae/World
       DJs Henrik (Sweden), Evans (Paris), Jorge (SF), Jay J (SF),
       Sergio (USA), Sammy (Spain), Lady Miss P (Boston), Melvin J (NY-SF)

... btw, based on what happened Tuesday night, y'all better check out
    Corduroy City on Friday night -- Dub Tribe & John Howard make an
    *awesome* combo . . . !

Hey, music lovers!

I bumped into Tom the other day, one of the folks who worked at Butch
Wax (on 18th St).  Tom has the what's left of the collection, and is
looking for buyers.  He cuts some good deals.  The remainder of the
collection is mostly new stuff from the 70's and 80's, lots of hi NRG,
disco, and deep house. He also has some used records and albums.

Tom can be reached at 415-703-0856. Thought you'd like to know.

I've just returned from a not so short round trip from Berkeley to SF and 
back.  Why am I back so soon, you ask?  Well, after seeing the Spun@Rock'n Bowl
event mentioned several times on the list (including on the calendar), I 
thought it would be fun to go bowling (which we were thinking about doing 
anyway) and to see Spun play for just 5 bucks, bowling fees included.  I 
called up the bowling alley and all seemed dandy.  We arrived, entered, 
made our way up to the cash register, and THEN... it happened:

"That'll be five dollars, and I'll need to see your ID's", said the bitch.

"What??!!!??" (very surprised)

"Come back when you're 21."

First of all, this statement alone pissed me off.  Where do door people 
get off saying derogatory shit like that?  She didn't look 21 herself.  

Second, not ONCE was it ever mentioned on this list (or anywhere else 
for that matter),that you had to be 21 years old to go bowling in San 
Francisco.  I even remember past Rock 'n Bowl/rave events mentioned, 
never with the 21+ stipulation.  I can't blame Derek, because I'm sure he 
didn't know, but didn't SOMEONE know?  Things like this shouldn't go 
unmentioned.  Needless to say, I think the whole thing is pretty fucked (even 
21+ clubs in general).  I know this thread has been dealt with many times 
before, but the fact is, the only reason for having a 21+ event is 
$$$$$$.  It costs more money to obtain the permits for 18+, so heck, if 
we can discriminate against younger people AND save money, then why the 
hell not?  Enough said.

Preston's gig, Lighten Up, is going thru some changes right now.  He told
me he would let me know when I could post an update to the status of his
club. So far though, things are on hold until he get's back.  So Lighten Up
is on hold.  Will keep you updated.

Hey I dunno if this was discussed b4 cause I was off the list for almost a year
but they showed a repeat of the Simpsons last night where Marge has a Thelma &
Louise type of adventure.  On the way somewhere, she goes to a club where they
played techno!!  (Unfortunately, the club was called, "Club Hate")  It was
hilarious.

Julie and I have two young cats whom we want to find a good home for.
They are young (a little over a year and a half old), both female,
both spayed, with shots, etc. They were littermates, so they have
lived together all their lives, so we don't want to seperate them.
One is striped, 7 lbs; the other is black and fat (11 lbs). Both
have medium long fur (yes, they do shed).

They are very friendly and love people. Both will climb into your
lap, both sleep on the bed with us. One (Lo, the smaller one) actually
climbs under the covers with Julie.

Their names are Lolita (Lo for short) and Isis.

If you have been looking for some great cat pets, and can offer a 
good home to our kitties, please get in touch with us. We are located
in the East Bay (Hayward) and can travel to make a deliry f ncssary

Hi, everyone!


I just got off the phone with Brad - one of the MESS DJs that is
involved with the Kindness party this Saturday night (March 12).


He confirmed that the party will be 18+ and the cover charge will
be only $7.00.


This is a party you shouldn't miss!  See you there...

  The best part was when Otto (the bus driver) drinks a smart drink
and says something to the effect of "Wow...I've been wasting my life
away"  Then Mayor Quimby comes over to say hi to Marge and he's all
body painted.  :)

Hi folks,

If anybody knows if Bob Ramstad is still DAT-taping parties, and knows his 
ph. #, please leave it on the KINDNESS East Bay voice-mail (or the # of any 
other people that would be into doing it).  We gotta get this party for 
posterity!  BTW, Ron Reagan Jr. is in town and has been working with the 
Cannabis Action Network people, and they'll be at the party, so who 
knows...;)

Just to confirm a few details...KINDNESS will be 18+ (gotta get all 
those eligible voters there!), in San Francisco, very public 
transport friendly, and will be $7.  There will be two main sound 
systems, and an ambient room.  Doors open around 10, and we plan on 
ending around 8.  Call the voice mail # Sat. evening for exact location, 
and we hope to see all your smiling faces Saturday night!

Peace and respect,

Sorry for the last-minute notice!  Tonite there will be another New
Moon Party up the coast at an as-yet undisclosable location.  Maybe
you remember the last one...on a houseboat in Marin hosted by Mona.

It's free and will be on a beach.  The weather's just right for it
so it will be a blast!

Info line:  415-267-3076.

Enjoy!!

	The most recent issue of Emigre
	concentrates on the British graphic
 	design company, Designers Republic.
	You know their work from PWEI, Orb,
	and Sun Electric album covers, posters,
	etc.  The issue goes into a fairly
	profound dissection of design and modern
	techno culture.  If Im correct DR is
	pretty much responsible for 'stolen logo'
	look that dominates much of rave culture.

Apparently not, for I saw Family Groove flyers in LA two days ago with the
415 area code number crossed out and a 213 one written in....

Well, the problem was with the NIN unannounced show at the Temple was it 
was NEVER announced (at least I never heard them mention) that it was a 
21+ place.  I was major bummed.  There was also an unannounced show at 
The Edge friday for $5.  That WOULD have been cool, but I actually like 
other bands way more.  I need to save my cash anyway.  

On the Bowling thing.  When I called (XXX-BOWL), i got some dude who just 
said "hello?"  I got confused and thought I had a wrong #.  Still, that 
was completely overshadowed by the lack-of-attention-to-detail of LIVE 
105 to not mention the fact that you HAD to be 21+ (or have a fake ID).  
I think shit like this encourages us discriminated youths to REBEL and go 
out and get one!  I mean, we get our hopes up only to be broken up at the 
door.  I didn't even see ANY signs saying this while we waited about 15 
minutes in line.  I know of one way to get a fake one, but that way takes 
like 2 months! (it's the phoney birth cert/SS#- send it to Sac. way...) 
Is there any quicker way (besides using a GOOD scanner/digitizer)???
Oh well, just my 2cents.

It's a beautiful day here in Oregon, the sun is shining people are out and
eveyone is happy.  I can't wait to get back to SF and see everyone out next
week!!  Does anyone have any suggestions for what to do the 26th (other
thanFM) because I found out (unfortunately) that Mixmaster Morris show is
21+ so I need something to do before the night gets late?!

I'm normally not a fan of indoor raves - they're too loud (can't hide from
   the sound, which I want to do at least per night for an hour maybe), you
   can't "take a walk", they're usually in especially seedy neighborhoods
   (read: safe to park?), they're often expensive, and ...

Kindness was none^H^H^H^Hfew of these things.  First: the music was
   intense... the big names did their shit.  The vibe was there...

The space was pretty neat, although it could have had more... stuff...
   filling it up - more sofas in some places... nothing hanging frmo the
   walls really, and overall kinda hasty... but the visuals in the main
   dance floor were perfect.

The organizers were -very- cool.  I had to run back to the car for a minute
   and they were cool with it... they didn't especially try to rip you off
   on liquids... the t-shirts for sale were most.

anyway, time to faceplant.

dreams be merry,
adam

Now, *THIS* was a good event!  $7.00 at the door, bumpin' sound, and a good
cause!  This party was all about the heart of "rave".  Reminded me of my
old LA days in '91-'92.  Lots of people (all ages), having a good time.

Even though I generally do not attend 21-- events, this one was worth
checking out at least.  It is one of the *very few* places 21--- can go and
stay ALL NIGHT.  I was dismayed that the place was not packed out by the
time I left (1:30), becuase it should have been.
Nice one from the MESS crew (this was the *FIRST* MESS event I've
attended)!  And a big thanks to Brad for inviting me!  Hopefully I'll be
able to stay longer next time.  It was also nice to see some of the SFR
posse there (Bryce, Ethan, Moni, Tom, & Larry)!

Pet peeves:
That fucking party should have been overflowing!  But due to *many* people
bad mouthing the *VENUE* for such long periods of time, it will be
difficult for anyone to have an event decently attended.  I know there has
been some shitty events that have happened at the Haze, but that is *NOT*
the venues fault.  Instead it is the fault of the promoters/priducers of
the party.  Instead of attacking the individuals, a concerted effort was
made to di the space.  Now people with perfectly good intentions, who may
choose the space, have a difficult time overcoming the rep the place has
developed.  This is both stupid, *and* unfortunate for the scene.  That
place  could bring in many many new people.  It has *many* advantages, like
being *all ages*, all night!  Oh well, I've talked this game before...good
luck to anybody throwing an event there.  Alot of damage thru word of mouth
has been done.  Only time will turn things around for the HAZE. BTW I found
the security there FINE!  Not oppressive, and they really weren't walking
around bothering folx.  Now that's good security.

Another peeve is smoke.  I do not smoke cigs, never have, never will.  I
*hate* the smell of over processed tobacco, it fucking stinks!  Of all the
drugs it is the *MOST* oppressive.   Pot is another matter, the stuff
smells funkiddidly sweet.  Some would say it stinks as well, but the thing
is, pot smoke don't stick around.  You can air it out, it is natural, and
is not produced by Phllip Morris (yet).  Cigs do not have any of these
characteristics.  There was no booze at the Haze, but PLENTY of young
junkies (cigarette that is) for Phillip Morris.  Sad.  I just hate the
smell of the stuff and wish there was just a bit more ventillation.  I was
there for 1.5 hours, and by the time I got home I smelled like club funk.
Arrgh!!!  I think my next club will be called IONIZER, whose motto will be
"Getting the FUNK out yo face!".  I hate cigs....

Old boyz network:
Here we are, the start of '94.  Shit is heating up and I'ma
wondering...where are all the ladies?  You know, of the DJ variety?  Where
are those tapes ladies?  How come I can go into Ameba, Tribal, BPM, and see
many of the boyz (i.e. any male dj archetype) tapes, while I see zero from
the better sex?  I hope that YSH is *NOT* the only place you can hear
ladies go off on the decks.  I hope that in '94 the ladies make a big push
to get some exposure from other sides of the scene.  Only thru diversity
can things grow.  And *I* am always interested in getting new people who
have the touch, and can do the do.

Good Housekeeping will always be looking for people for our Guest Spots, as
well as many other clubs.  Nuff said....

On that Good Housekeeping tip:
We raised the door price 1 buck to $4.00.
There will be many offerings for breakfast, from $1-$3 bucks:a nice gourmet
breakfast will do wonders.  The $3 range will feature more feature filled
dishes.  But you WILL eat quite well for $1-$2.  There will be a MENU to
choose from. So...get your feet, stomach, and *MIND* ready for Good
Housekeeping on the 20th.

Harry Who will be there doin the do in the back with James, Alfie, and
Markie, along with Disco Detective Sassy Lime, getting soulful and funky in
the front.  Live Jazz will also be featured.

Ok, my shameless promotion is up, and so is this message.

John

Was in Ameba yesterday and saw various flavors of DRC tapes (she's a she)
plus the Liquid Air tapes (which feature two shes, me and Tamara).  Have
also seen the Liquid Air tapes at Rasputnin's in Berkeley.

Susan, Tamara, and I are all working on new tapes . . . stay tuned!

If anyone happens to be in Denver this weekend, I'm going out there to
do a party called "Catwoman."  The phone number is 303-575-1330 .  It
will be me and just one other DJ, Louise, who is from the UK but is 
currently residing in Holland.  Louise spins house, and I spin techno, so 
it should be a good balance.

Also:
	Monday, March 28, in SF (forgot the address, will get it soon)

				The Eighth House

		with Mixmaster Morris (from the UK) (aka The 
			Irresistable Force)

		Jonah

		Laura

		and another person or two who's names I don't recall . . 

I'm getting real flyers this week, I'll post one when I see it.

16th & Harrison deserves its bad reputation for a long string of
overhyped, overpriced parties with obnoxious security, second-rate
sound and a vibe that would make fresh paint peel.  

I've been to a few things there over a couple of years and only went
to one that was any good -- an unannounced free thing on a Sunday
evening about six months ago.

Let's face it, the place is an anti-power spot for our scene.  Not
to say that it can't be used, and I'm glad MESS made good use of it.
If I'd been in town I would probably have gone.  But it's not clear,
as jslee intimates, that club nights are totally separable from the
spaces they are held in.  The management attitude at 16th & Harrison
pervades the place just as that at Townsend or 1015 or DV8 or any place
else does.  

As for women DJs, last time I was at BPM -- last Tuesday, actually, there
were not one, not two, but THREE different DRC tapes available (including
her new one 'Ritual Addiction' which she described to me as being 'mellow' :)

There are plenty of male DJs who get regular gigs in SF who do not put
tapes out in general circulation.  I've never seen a Hardkiss (any variety)
tape, for example.  That's not to say they're not out there, but I am an
avid tape collector and I know what's out there.

As an aspiring DJ of sorts myself, I know something about the barriers
women DJs face in getting gigs.  You have to have a rep to get gigs,
and you have to have gigs to get a rep.  It's a slow process, and the
historical fact is that women in music as in many fields don't get
full consideration of their talents.  Breaks are a matter of hard work
*and* support from the scene.  That's why it's so important for things
like YSH to happen which provide some visibility for some DJs who
otherwise would remain mostly out of public view.

We differ.  Kindness and other quality parties that have been held there
*PROVE* that something good can happen at that space.  And the vibe was a
nice one this past Saturday.  I just wanna know.  Where in SF do 21-- go?
Nuff said.  Everything, and everyone deserves a second chance, and if what
Kindness did was  any example, everyone should be up for at least
reconsidering their stance on Haze.

I do not agree.  The ONLY thing that is anti-power is attitudes, pissy
cops, and  shitty promoters (some of which RAN that space for a while).
Just call em crazy, I do not believe in bad buildings as a rule.

That's only because people wanna make that quick non-thinking connection.
The FACT is a promoter rents a space to use.  If I don't like the promoter
or what he/she stands for I do not attend their events.  If I would apply
your logic to the situation, I would have stayed home and not even given
the boys from MESS a chance.  This is just not fair, to judge a
promoter/posse/team by the space they use.  And that's what you end up
doing.  Whatever...just another reason the scene suffered last year.  This
year though, I hope others throw things there so that it's rep can get
built up again.  And it is also a cool place for 21--.  The ONLY one in SF!

>The management attitude at 16th & Harrison

Not true.  It was all Kindnesstude at that place!  ANYTHING can be overcome
in time.  You were not there to witness it so...

>

I have heard of DRC.  I stand corrected for the statment of seeing ZERO
from a female DJ (Noting Laura's previous correction).  However, one tape
ain't enough.  And it is REALLY not a tape issue, but an issue of getting
to hear female DJ's out and about, *NOT* just at one party.  It's all about
getting out there, not hunkering down.  I still wanna hear MORE from the
ladies of this scene (i.e. DJ's).

>
>There are plenty of male DJs who get regular gigs in SF who do not put

Like who?  Before you answer that, the male dj's who get regular gigs
*HAVE* put out tapes aplenty before.  Secondly, their rep is secure and
they play a variety of places, so they are always out there.  And last,
promoters exchange tapes, and I consider that circulation.  That is where
recommendations come in, and that's the point.  There are a couple of guys
I know who are really good but have not gotten the bookings, they are
getting the word out there about their abilities, and as a result are
gettin play.  The same effort should (and is by some) be made by the
greatly unheard from female DJ's.  It's happening, but on a smaller scale
and slowly.  I just wish it would happen on a lrger scale and quickly.

>I've never seen a Hardkiss (any variety)
>tape, for example.  That's not to say they're not out there, but I am an

I have several HK tapes.  And they are all over the place as most DJ tapes
are.  Seeing it in stores is just one idicator.  Albeit a good indication
of who's doing what (when was the last time you heard HK spin?).

YSH is fine, but relying on *one* party alone for exposure may not be the
best course for some.  I just think that people should branch out, and do a
variety of gigs.  Now I have never attended a YSH, but will do so this year
when it gets started.

There is no reason for fusion NOT to happen in SF this year. This place
should go ballistic with the number of DJ's kinda stable, and people
wanting something new.  The time is now for newer DJ's to get in while they
are still able to.  It's all about making that connection, communicating,
saying hello (for the most part), and passin' that tape.

Audi from all this.  We'll see what becomes of '94,
John

 Too bad you couldn't make it , you would have definitly enjoyed it!
I had a great time ; hit some nice trancey mind spaces about three times
that night.

 I had an omen that things were going to turn out OK when I showed up
at the door at 11:30PM to find one of the SFRavers at the door! I 
don't quite remember her name ( Diane? I warned you I'm lousy with names!
Nice to have met your SO ). And , once inside , there was Lavonne (?)
and another guy named Sun , sitting on the sofa behind the ticket
taker.

 I managed to meet a bunch of folks from SFRaves - the Normals, Fogels
( pssst! Lee , what was your wife's name again ??? [ I was there was 
a drug to improve name memory ...] ), John G/"Jump In The Fire", Marlo ,
Bryce , Ethan , Larry(?) , John Draper. As far as the crowd was concerned ,
seem to be the usual rave club party mix , except with a somewhat younger 
crowd than a club , more like an FMR. Some packs of guys trying too
look tough , but they seem to be more concerned with projecting that
image instead of proving it, so things were OK there.

 Some mentioned that more furniture would have been nice - I thought 
they proved more comfy chairs and cushions than a lot of other $15++
spaces. There was a nice spot behind the big stage that had a few
chairs , that I curled up in for a shoort nap.

 As in other events , the "chill room" DJ seemed to be a tad deaf - I
didn't think he had to compete for the sound as much as he did. Sound iso
isolation of the chill space from the other dance areas was much better
than Richmond Civic. The chill area was smaller than Richmond's , and
the flow of traffic is right through the middle ( the room was actually
a wide hallway ).

 The Haze Theatre itself was on "its" best behaviour. Not too obnoxious
security ( only one bust that I've heard of , and I don't even know if
the guy in question was kicked out or not - caught lighting up the herb
of the event ). Sound in both rooms was quite adequate , not distorted
to any harsh/earshreadding degree . Crowd vibe - mellow enough! 

----------------------------

 KINDNESS was a great event! I wish more folks had shown up , for the
MESS / benefit's sake. 

----------------------------

 So - which Promoters/Events have been held at the Haze Theatre that
were real stinkers? 

----------------------------

PS - John G. , how did you get home?

Brothers and Sisters,

	GeoffW (Me) needs a place to crash in the Seattle area between
	Friday night (March 26 and Wednesday Morning March 30)

	I will be coming north for the IETF meeting (Internet Engineering
	Task Force) that will be at the:

	Sheraton Seattle Hotel & Towers 
        1400 Sixth Avenue 
        Seattle, Washington 98101

	I don't need lavish accomodations and am willing to sleep on a 
	(carpeted :) floor.  I'm also _very_ interested in experiencing your
	Scene and will promise to have my luv phaser fully charged :)

	As many on the list can confirm, I'm a very interesting and
	unique :) person, I make interesting conversation, have good
	manners, (most of the time), am cute and cuddley, and come
	completely equipped ready-to-rave(tm).  The real IETF starts on
	Monday morning at 8:30 a.m.  I have to go to an intro for
	newbies at 4:30 on Sunday afternoon.  To get a cheap airfare I
	have to arrive in Seattle on friday night.  But if I can get a
	later flight, I'll come on Saturday (I don't want to miss the
	Full Moon Rave :) SOOOooooo, if anybody can help me out, I will
	cook/buy meals, (I'm an excellent vegitarian cook :), give
	backrubs, and delight you with "tales of the City" 90's style
	:). I can be _very_ entertaining.

	Being a trance addict, it would be also really good if I could catch
	a good groove while I'm up there but I guess if I come to Seattle,
	I should be ready to go out to all the grunge(tm) spots, which is OK 
	as well.

	All serious invites will be seriously considered, you can reply
	to me here or at geoffw@internex.net or, if you want to talk to me

A tape I've got by dj dan has a sample of the intro to "smells like teen
spirit", if that's what you were talking about.  I don't have the tape
with me so I can't tell you the actual name and stuff but if it's what
you're thinking let me know and I can mail you later today...

not to get into details, but IMHO, many of the problems that MESS
faced was due to the management of the Haze Theater.  they definitely
have a focus on making money which often clashes with what a good rave
promoter wants to provide --- comfort and a good strong vibe.

again, strictly IMHO, anyone who is planning on throwing events should
evaluate all other alternatives before considering the Haze.

I'm really glad the event took off. I helped a bit with setup and
provided a little of the deco, and all of the promoters were just
totally nice people. I crashed out at a friends house and headed over
after 3am (still sleep deprived mind you) at which point things were
beginning to wind down a bit.

If you haven't heard Brad or Scottie spin, check them out. I really
enjoyed their sets.

The Haze theatre *is* a creepy place. It takes a lot of visuals and
positive energy to overcome it, but it can be done. The security was
pretty cool actually outdoors. Indoors, however, they were too
aggressive about looking for drugs. (Why do they bother?) It's
vibe-upsetting to see cops craning their necks every time someone
hands something to someone else. I'm strongly tempted to go around
"dealing" chewing gum some night just to frustrate the police.

Except for that, I thought things were pretty good. And the price was
right, too.

Wow. This event was the perfect renegade. It was held somewhere (not
telling) on a beach in Point Reyes. The weather was perfect: a cool
but not cold night, and a light offshore (dry) breeze.

There were about 30 people there, enough to make it a party, but few
enough that I learned a lot of names and made some new friends :). The
Hardkisses (and a couple of DJs whose names I didn't catch) provided
some good sets. The music was a bit ambient and experimental at
times, at others flowing into a deep house or trance set. 

This party just had phenomenal good vibes. Mona and many of the others
(Hi anthrax!)  at the party are some of the nicest people I've
met in the scene in a while. I've been going to too many parties with
too much ego, and this one just felt like a big cozy hug.

At one time I walked off for a while, and turned around, and it was
so neat seeing the people around the fire in the distance, with the
stars so bright and so close overhead. A moonless night has its own
special charms :).

I strongly recommend checking out this free party, especially if huge
event nitrous/booze/ego/whatever has got you down. Very good for the
soul.

Just a few comments about Kindness and the Haze Theater:


I really enjoyed the event even though it was at the Haze Theater.
My friends and I have been to several events at the Haze Theater in
the past, and had such negative experiences that we vowed never to
go again.  The only reason that we went to Kindness was that we are
friends with Brad (one of the MESS djs) and wanted to support his
event.  Also, with only $7.00 for a cover charge, we felt that we
weren't risking too much to attend.  Unfortunately, many of our
friends did not show up because it was at the Haze Theater.

When I mentioned this to Brad at the party, he said that he knew
that the Haze Theater had a bad reputation, but that it was the only
place that they could find in SF that would allow under 21 all
night.  He did mention that the ONLY problems they had in putting on
the event were trying to deal with the management at the Haze
Theater...

In summary, the event was great - music, visuals, everything.  The
only drawback was that there should have been many more people in
attendance.  I hope that MESS events are able to draw more people in
the future - they're a great bunch of people and deserve to be
supported.

just my random observations of sat's kindness party:

expected the worst after finding out it was at Haze...
but was pleasantly surprised by a good party with great music and
friendly people inside.  i concure with jsl on the smoke thing...after
dancing for awhile, the last thing you want is to take a big breath of
stinky cig. smoke - burning budz are like incense to me though.

i wandered from the main room to the back mess rooms almost exclusively.  it
was a toss up which was better.  both were great for different reasons.  the 
mess room i though was trippyer and i could take my ear plugs
out and get bugged in the brain.  the main floor was high energy body music.
i love dancing right in front of the stacks - feels good.

only ventured upstairs to the ambient room twice.  i liked the info tables on
mj and the table with the psychoactive plant samples.  picked up all info
that was available.  good info.

all and all a good time worht the price and cause...

a shout out to 'mike' for reading my mind - thx for the 'shrooms!

Well thanks to everyone who responded. I'll be sending out more info soon 
as I get everything figured out. Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, 
I'll be back in Detroit until this Friday, so I won't be able to send out 
any updates until then. Talk to you all soon. JMAR

And I agree, the New Moon was quite amazing.

OK, I don't have too much trouble with any of the comments jslee made.

But what I want to know is, are *you* gonna make the effort to seek
out the women DJs who can lay down the phat trax in 1994, John?
How about Charlotte, for example, who's now the house music buyer at
Star Alley *and* the resident DJ for the Broun Fellinis?

After reading  posts about Kindness 
and Hze theatre rap, these are the
conclusions I have drawn.

Kindness had a good VIBE, the promoters 
where warm & friendly. (HI Scott & Madeline!!)

I enjoyed listening to the 'smaller' dj's and
dug the guy in the main room around 2ish.
Whatz his name??  he played tribal, beat-mixed
stuff. hhhmmm good :^)

That was my first time at the HAZE (i think)
and I agree with SEan, it does have a creepy
feeling to it, except the main room.

All in All the MESS crew threw a pretty good
party considering Haze's checkered past.

I'm sure we all understand that Haze was the
only choice for MESS, since they wanted to
include the under 21 folks..

--Thanks MESS!!!

I just want to make it clear in case there is any misunderstanding that
despite my strong feelings about 16th & Harrison I *would* have attended
the MESS party (which would mean ducking out of susie's gathering for
a while).  Just didn't want to get that point lost in my colloquy with
jslee . . .

Ooooh a challenge!!!  First off, not to become vitriolic or nutin, but I
have ALWAYS since getting into this, tried to get people who are not heard
all that often.  That has, and always will be my goal.  I am also into
letting people hear out of town talent as well.  With that said....

Well Fred (right said):  I have already contacted Charlotte (thru Josh).
All I have to do is ask the others involved if they would like either to
spin.  After all, it is a cooperative (I spoke to Josh last week about this
sooo...one step ahead maybe ;) <- Note, this does not happen often!  Just
to let you know I am taking this all quite lightly since I am quite giddy
about Sunday!!!

I am also talking to two OTHER female DJ's.  So I am doing my part as an,
er uh, promoter.  STILL the ladies MUST make a better effort at getting out
there.  Everybody's waitin...nuff said on this.

Pax,
John

I'm sure we all understand that Haze was the
only choice for MESS, since they wanted to
include the under 21 folks..

Actualy, I know the owner/mngr. of Berkeley Square, which is -21 and I'm
sure I could set up gigs there.  I've heard it dissed a couple times on
this list but it's not as bad as the Haze.  Nothing a good set-up and

Hi folks!

First of all, let me say on behalf of the Mother Earth Sound System: 
Thank you, to all those that volunteered at, promoted for, attended or 
otherwise supported KINDNESS - your help was greatly appreciated!!!  
Although various aspects of putting on the party disturbed us, we all 
agreed that for our first effort at an indoor event, we shouldn't 
complain too much :)  More importantly, we broke even, and got over 400 
(whoopee!) signatures for the California Hemp Initiative, which was the 
primary reason for doing KINDNESS in the first place.  BTW, if anyone is 
curious about our budget and expenses for this party, just email me 
directly and I'll pass the info your way.

Regarding the discussion that's been going on about the Haze Theatre, its
owners, etc, I have to admit that we came away from this party with a
pretty bad taste in our mouths, but now that its all over, we're just glad
the party went as well as it did.  Like many of you, I believe that the
bad rep that the Haze Theatre has been saddled with may be due largely to
past promoters and the sort of events they have thrown there, but I'm not
hesitant to say that the current owners are to be blamed for a lot of the
negative energy that is associated with the space.  Why?  Well, just based
on our experience with them, they're profit-hungry, which automatically
(at least the way I see it) prevents them from doing right by the 
promoters and party-goers that they cater to.  Specific examples?  I 
don't want to start listing all our grievances with them, but suffice it 
to say that if you're trying to throw a 18+ event in the city, please try 
to find an alternative to the Haze Theatre (at least while it's under the 
current management), for your own good (financially and 
mentally/emotionally) and the interests of your partygoers.  We learned 
the hard way, and were fortunate that the good vibes that you and many 
others poured into the party made it go off.

Fortunately, it seems not too many of you had bad experiences with the 
security, but I have heard of at least 4 instances of confiscated pot 
-- two of my friends got their pipes taken, and NOT returned :(  This all 
happened despite us repeatedly telling them to lay off.  I'm also glad 
there were no serious problems with obtaining water, but since Jimmy 
(owner) was selling it and juice (something we found out Sat. afternoon), 
he prevented us from giving out free water and OJ as we had planned.

Sorry to go on about stuff that a lot of you have already discussed, but 
I just wanted to let you all know where the Mother Earth Sound System 
stands regarding that space and its owners.  And BTW, you might be seeing 
some "guest posts" from my address, from some other MESS members who have 
stuff to say about the party.

Thanks once again for the support you've given us -- many of you, at some 
point, in various ways, have reminded us of why we are doing what we're 
doing, and we love you for helping us create the community and parties 
that we all want to have :).  With that in mind, we hope to see you all at 
our first outdoor party of the year, our 1 year anniversary, on 
Saturday, April 2 (NOT April 3 as we mistakenly said before).  Fun in the 
springtime sun!!!

Peace & respect,

You're right!  I didn't even think of that!  The Ethan that I 
referenced is a local DJ who spins PHAT house, sweet dub-stylee and 
alpha-wave ambient.  And whoay did he deeeeeliver...in fact, everyone 
there spun some great vinyl.

Union & Transcendance was held at the Sailor's Pacific Union Hall, 2505 
1st Avenue in Seattle.  The building managment was really cool; in fact 
at the end of the night they invited us back.   That's some pretty good 
news given the scarcity of decent spaces in Seattle; often building 
managment doesn't want anything to do with the house community after 
their space has been trashed and abused by give-a-shit prometers who 
see a one-off as a way to make quick bucks, leaving a huge trail of 
debris.  I really wish that promoters would put energy in cultivating 
the relationship between the house community and property owners; 
leaving a space as good or better than The turnout was okay, nothing 
stellar.  I would guess that about 300-325 people were in attendance 
over the course of the night (the hall itself has a capacity of 350) 
with about 200 people at any one time.  From what I hear, many people 
decided not to go because they felt there would be a "weird vibe" or 
something.  On the other hand, I hear (second hand from people who 
_didn't_ go to the party) that those who came thought it to be a phat 
party, which was the whole point of the event.  The proceeds are on 
their way to the family.  Thanks again, everyone who came, contributed 
and just had fun.  And thanks to all of you who sent your best wishes.  
Riz spun funky old house, Masa left wax prints on our brains, Hebegebe, 
Quest and Donald worked us over with a mixture of hardbeats and Dervish 
closed the set with a mixture of trance, house and ambient that left us 
all in awe of the masterful bridging and his beautiful choice of last 
song which went well with our gathering hand-in-hand in a big circle to 
celebrate coming back together.

Rhthm&Bass

Peace!

I'm finally going to be in good ole Cali on Friday and I AM going to the
city for a chance  to dance Saturday night away.  The calendar has given me
three possiblities to do just this.  Can someone tell me which one has the
most for a good time.  Organic, Equinox or Picking up the pieces?  I'm
thinking Organic but I could be wrong.  Which one had the least possiblity
for the hunter/gatherer-meat-market types?
Thanx!

This sounds like the "FBI Wiretap Proposal."  It is being introduced
for the second (or third?) time.  The resurfacing of this proposal, at
this time, is unlikely to be coincidental, but has a lot to do with
the Clipper/Skipjack/Capstone proposal.  Combine a guarantee of access
to all communication with a guarantee to be able to decrypt all
communication, and routine automated domestic spying becomes feasible
and cost-effective.

Some parts of the US Government appear to be very serious about not
allowing civil society to exist in cyberspace, and by extention
anywhere.

I helped at the door between 2 - 3 am.  The music they played during that
time in the big room was the music I really wanted to dance to.  Whoever
it was, I'd have to say he was good. 

I was a bit disappointed with the music a bit.  It's a personal preference
for me because I enjoy a more 'round' feeling to the music.  The smaller
room was definately playing music I liked but the DJ kept on playing music
that didn't have beats.

Tonight (that's Tuesday March 15) at 9pm Trance Mission is playing
the Great American Music Hall. Tickets are only $7. TM is a San
Francisco area band which combines Beth Custer on clarinet with
Stephen Kent and Kenneth Newby from Lights In a Fat City and
John Loose into a funky sort of world-fusion combo with you really
have to hear for yourself. You may also remember Stephen Kent
(and his didgeridoo) from the Space-Time Continuum sessions with
Terrence McKenna.

There's an opening act (I don't remember the name) so TM probably
won't come on until around 10 or so...

Anyway, I think this will be well worth the $7 cover.

Well, I apologize if someone else answers this.  I have been to five 
sharks games, and they have WON three times.  I guess I give them GOOD 
Karma.  As for the TOTALLY COOL techno at the beginning of each period,

	2 UNLIMITED- from the CD _Get Ready For This_.  This is the 
CD-only "Instrumental Version".  My roomate has it and we play it A LOT.  
I even used it in a production assignment for my TV Directing I class at 
SF State.  

Hope that helps!

Speaking of Hardkisses;  Did they ever get their equipment back from
the rip-off in Salt Lake City.  I usually don't hear about outcomes!
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

	The Hardkisses didn't lose any equipment, but they did get ripped
off their wages.  The unfortunate people that lost equipment were
sound and light rental people here in Salt Lake.  I hear the FBI has
a file on Davey (the sleazy promoter that caused all this shit) and
is now hunting him down.  Hopefully they will bust his ass, because
he's caused quite a lot of damage to the great but smaller scene we
have here.  Now it's impossible for a promoter to rent sound without
also paying the rental people to watch it all night long, just so
they can insure that it won't "walk off" like Davey's system did.
	If anybody ever does meet a shady guy with a Uhaul truck full of
light and sound from out of state...  Well, you know what to do.  And
also please keep in mind that Davey's actions in no way speak for the
rest of Salt Lake.  We've tried to do nothing more than build a great
vibe here and we've had some great parties.  I know personally that
these promoters have never ripped anyone off:  Mechanized, Playscool,
Taste, Phunk Productions, and Guru.

Peace, Love, and Bass...

Motion is at FX on First Street in San Jose.  It's a good time, and only

Hello everyone,

I'm pleased to see that so many of you were interested in the logistics 
of throwing an indoor party -- does this mean some of y'all have plans of 
your own? :)  In any case, here's the details as exact as we were able to 
break them down:

16th & Harrison rental:	740
SECURITY (4):	 	320
CLEANING DEPOSIT:	100
SOUND (incl. set-up)*
  8 Community bass bins
  8 Community tops
  and all the power	600
VOICEMAIL (2)		 50
PROMOTION
  10,000 flyers		255
LIGHTING:		215
KINDNESS BANNER:	100
DAISIES :)		 35
FRUIT:			 30
DA KIND ;)		100
DJs (6 @ $60)**		360
DONOVAN $60**		 60
SMALL CHANGE FOR DOOR:	200
MISC. SUPPLIES		130

TOTAL EXPENSES:		3295

TOTAL DOOR:		~3500

NET PROFIT:		~205

50% PROFIT TO 
  CANNABIS ACTION NTWK:	100

REMAINING PROFIT TO 
  M.E.S.S.		105

* We rented from JK Audio in SF ** Donovan & the DJs were promised NOTHING
in advance, and were told they would be rewarded for their help only if we
made a profit. 

BTW, most of these figures are from memory, and may not be exact, but if 
I find any discrepancies later, I'll post them.

Also, for all of you interested in the DJ line-ups, here they are:

MAIN ROOM:
10-12	Tony
12-2	Spun
2-4	Josh
4-4:30	Brad
4:30-5	Stonie
5-5:30	Scottie
5:30-7	Anton

Mother Earth Room:
12-2	Stonie
2-4	Brad
4-5	Scottie

Chill Room:
12-3	Jason
3-5	Whitsitt


Peace + respect,

Rick Preston and Jeno in San Jose!!! I thought. I called my friend  Forrest
and we agreed to "damn to torpedoes" and leave Monterey at 9:30 and expect to
get home by 3:00am.  WE'd find a way to drag our reluctant bodies to work the
next day.  First, Rick met us at the door and informed us Julius would our DJ
before Jeno, and that he would be playing NEXT Wed. OK, Julius played a
competent housey set, but there realy wan't a crowd vibe yet. Jeno went on at
12:00 and elevated the music, the house, and the crowd. The guy's atomic!
The last two times I saw him; Spundae and Wicked were orbital, and last night
was no different. Just when you think you've crested in a groove, he presses
the time-warp button, and yanks everyone up a notch! If you haven't been to
MOTION at the FX, it's a little funny. The club is burrowed in behind a movie
theater in downtown SJ. The dance floor is graduated where movie seats used
to be, so you're at a slight incline. It's like dancing at the Santa Cruz
Mystery Spot!!! WE left at 1:40, and got home at 2:50am.(maintaining the
speed limit all the way) Had a grreat time; remember Rick is playing next
Wed. Robertj..Monterey Rave Posse.

	out of curiosity, who gets all the money from the
	sales of this video, how is it split?  does any of 
	it go to the orb?  is it a bootleg?

Oops, I almost forgot to send this today.  I might be missing some
stuff because I haven't been out lately, so I dunno what's up on 
Friday.  On Saturday, Equinox returns after what seems like a long
hiatus (or else they've been way underground).  I remember a great
Equinox back in spring '92, but then they were a bit inconsistent
after that.  Organic also returns Saturday, it'll be big, it'll
probably be $20, but if you go in expecting that, you can have fun.
If you can stay up, or if you skip all that, check out the opening
of Good Housekeeping on Sunday morning...

I won't comment on the Orb video as I haven't seen it. I have however=
 seen the toon town, full moon, etc. video. While it's a nice "document"=
 of the happenings it's also your average "humanoid with a handicam"=
 special, which, IMO, isn't worth $20 let alone $50. If I'm gonna=
 spend *money* I'd like some *production values* like a direct audio=
 feed from the mixer (as opposed to camcorder miking), full sets=
 instead of half of a song from this dj, a scrap of that song from=
 that dj, etc.

Make no mistake, I'm glad someone's out there getting this stuff,=
 I just think their prices need to re-enter this solar system.

take it easy

Get your copy of the rave guide, name it to "calendar" in your top

info:  267-6926

NOTE:  The promoters are working on getting permission for
this to be 18+, but as of now it is still 21+.  I'll let
you all know if this comes through.

By the way, this is going to be an every-other Monday 
party if it all goes well!

Some of you have requested info on the C.H.I., so here's all the dope ;) 
on it that I could round up:

CHI Hotline: 1 (800) 425-HEMP

Deadline for petitions: May 27

Total # sigs needed: 500,000
  (actually only 380,000, but they have to allow for procedural error)

Want to volunteer?  Easy 30 min. petitioner training sessions every Sat 
and Sun betw. 10 am and noon at the Hemporium, 442A Haight (near 
Fillmore).

You can sign the petition at the Hemporium, open Tu-Sun 11-5, or call 
them and ask for a place in your area, (415) 552-7487.

We should realize the potential we have as a community to support this
cause, and act accordingly.  Just look at KINDNESS as an example: out of
about 650-700 people that attended, over _500_ signed the CHI, and over
100 registered to vote.  That's over _two-thirds_ folks!!!  Just imagine
the results you could get if you and your friends took petitions with you
when you went to parties, to clubs, to the park, etc etc!  At KINDNESS, we
had great success by petitioning to the people standing in line, and
putting a table with info and hemp products up in the chill room.  C'mon,
let's unite and legalize marijuana in this state!!! 

Peace + respect,
scottie

Jeez, i knew i shoulda uns!bbed from the list when I was gone. Netcom 
left me a nice note saying my mailbox had grown past the preset limit and 
did a little compression job on my incoming messages.

As I was (finally) getting off the plane to D'troit, I turned around to 
see...Shoban! Apparently she's going to be out there with Chris for a 
while. They've got a big loft downtown (prob for half the price o'mine) 
and Chris is going to have a release out on Switch soon.

On the way back I had a layover in St.Louis where (I swear) they've got 
those metal detectors jacked up high enough to beep if you've got too 
much iron in your blood. I must have matched some hijacker profile or 
something. Beep. Take off coat. Beep. Remove change and keys. Beep. 
lighter. Beep. Took off necklace. Beep. Belt (after all, I could've 
gutted a crewmember in under five seconds with the buckle or something). 
Beep. Boots. Beep. Unload 9mm pistol stashed in hollow leg. Beep. Remove 
skull plate. Beep. take out tooth fillings... beep

Little did they know, I watch MacGyver too, and with a little effort I 
was able to contruct a crude low-yield nuclear explosive from my belt 
buckle, the in-flight magazine, 2 straws, a spork, 130 g ice, and a stick 
of gum. I was then able to hold my neighbor hostage until I was given 
another bag of honey-roasted peanuts. Ah, sweet sucrose, all thanks to 
the moons gravitational pull and the density of oxygen at 30,000 ft.

Anyway, I'm back and will have more info and a flyer for the sfraves 
bar-b-q lunch later tonight (no silly, the bbq is next saturday the 26th, 
the *info* comes tonight. Put that tofu back in the fridge.)

jmar. beep.

our humble apologies for misleading so many innocent party people into 
thinking the party was sat. night,when in fact it is sunday night at 
12:oo midnight(which theoretically is monday the 21st).we were confused 
by the way the flyer failed to mention the actual day-but we should have 
known better considering the actual vernal equinox is the 
21st.please---------kick our asses.......

        Equinox was all I expected it to be, and more.  It was in a dirty
little warehouse, the music was mindblowing (especially the sets by Alex
from Gaia Mantra and James...especially James!), the energy was high, and
the cover charge was low.  What more do I have to say?  A big thanks to
Ivan and Lacey for putting on a killer party that took me back to the old
days of the undergrounds.

I lost your address, but could you send me a copy of the so-cal rave 
calendar for the weekend/week of Friday the 25th?  Any numbers would also 
be helpful.

Also, to those out there that can confirm events in the northern LA 
county, could you send me info?  Thanks,  I live about 2-3 hours away 
from the Glendale area, and that's about what my car can handle at one 
time, so any further south would be useless.

Thanks,

I sat out for equinox, late (1:30) and arrived in the candlestick complex
arround 2.  It took me a while to actually find the place, but I eventually
drove down a street when a guy with a BIG orange Dr. suess type hat (!)
Flashed a flash light at me, I started to have a warm fuzzy feeling :)
as I drove intot the yard, the music was Booming out of a fairly large
but delapidated warehouse, I could see the light from some visual machines
ozzing out of rents in the sides of the building, (I started to get amped!)
Upon entry, I found a reasonably large warehouse space, with sheets put up 
against a couple of sides of the walls to project visuals on, (and the visuals
were really nice, including some great oil lamp stuff!!).  The whole setting
tool me back to the "old days" of 2 1/2 - 3 years ago.  The only problem was
NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WERE DANCING. There was far too much gawking and standing.
(I don't mean standing and grooving, I mean non participatatory standing and
watching) I can't figure out the  reason for this, the music was great, but
the crowd while friendly and nice, just was not committed to getting a groove
going.  I think a lot of recent ravers are spoiled from going to so many
"legal" venues.  They don't realize how lucky they are, that there are so many
high quality parties here and they expect the promoter to "entertain" them and
be totally responsible for the quality of the experience they are having.  Two
years ago every one in that place would be going completely ballistic, feeding
the DJ their energy and dancing for dear life, (cuz they would know that the 
Blue People could be at the door at any moment!) And in fact the Blue People
did shopw up a couple of times, (the Brisnbane cops were fairly cool, the first
couple of times they told them to turn down the music, they didn't seem upset
at us being there but they said they were getting complaints from daily city :)
So at 5:30 they come back during Garth's set, the promoters tell Garth he HAS
to turn it down, Garth seems to get this look on his face like saying "fuck 
all that" and cranks it! (I guess if it is going to be shut down, go out with 
bang, not a whimper :) Any ways the lights come on and the police come in
with a dog ! and clear everybody out, they were fairly nice about it and I saw
a least one group of ravers enlist one of the cops in taking a group picture
of the lot!  SO at 5:30 everyone scattered, not a bad party for $12 and I hope
the equinox people throw another undereground, the scene needs this energy and
expertise because we never know when ALL of our parties might have to be
underground once again.

With Spring coming into bloom and the renegades starting up soon. Let's try 
and remember to play it safe and throw parties in areas away from the 
gangster/hate generation.. it's all to sad that these anger filled upright 
apes with guns are moving in.. what can we do to make are scene unattractive 
to them? i and five friends spent time in SF general because of gang 
violence i still have the scares.! Please THINK about where your next events 
will be at.

Subject: "Catwoman" was YUMMY!!!
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Hi all!  I spent part of the weekend in Denver, and thought I'd report on 
how things went there for your entertainment pleasure (hee).

I flew out Saturday afternoon, going to the Mile High City for the first 
time.  All the other times I'd flown coast to coast had been at night, so I 
got to see the Rockies for the first time.  Landing in Denver is impressive: 
you swoop down out of the snow-covered mountains and onto the end of the 
Great Plains -- which are extremely flat.  

My friend Eric McCormick, who used to live in DC, met me at Stapleton (the 
gorgeous new Denver International is still not opened due to bugs in their 
high-tech optically encoded fabulous baggage handling system) with a boquet 
of flowers.  We went back to his very cool apartment, which is actually a 
storefront on a low hill west of downtown, and hung out there for a while.  
Eric makes techno, and played me his newest creation (a tribal/breaky 
trancey piece being shipped to Instinct Records even as we speak).  He also 
showed me the  "fluff piece" he was in on a local Denver newscast about 
Denver musicians that was run before the Grammy Awards.  Best of all Eric 
fed me home-made manicotti, and we gorged ourselves.  After a nighttime tour 
of "Lower Downtown" (including window shopping at Williams-Sonoma and stops 
at two coffehouses) we made our way to the party.

"Catwoman" was held in a small warehouse/loading dock/single truck garage a 
bit southwest of downtown.  It was near a residential area, so I was a bit 
worried, but nothing happened even though the cops dropped by to say hi.
The space was GREAT:  it had that old warehousey industrial feel to it, yet 
still had a nice bathroom, and wasn't all grimey and filthy yet wasn't "too 
clean" for ravers.  It was also heated, which is a plus for parties in a 
city where it was 75 during the day and 38 that night.

The sound system was the right size for the space, and sounded good from the 
floor but was HORRIBLY distorted when heard from where the DJ setup was.  I 
am completely spoiled by Ethan's Liquid Air setup and Bryce's methodical 
tweaking of the system.  But at least it sounded good to the dancers, 
although mixing was a complete nightmare.

The coolest thing about Catwoman was that Eagle (the organizer) took the
time to actually decorate the space.  He had an ingenious rig of little
fluffy clouds made from large painted pieces of posterboard hanging from
the ceiling.  There were about 20 individual clouds, all mounted in this
sort of web of twine, which was then strung across the dance

[ DARN!  I'd written a whole great description here, but when I 
ftp-d it from my work site to soda to post it, half of it got eaten!
and I had already deleted it from the work site.  Doh! ]

area.  Eagle and Leah's (yes, our sfraves / diva / Berkeley pal) friend
Laura created two huge neon-dayglo paintings which were hung on the
walls.  The DJ area was decorated with "Catwoman" birthday party
decorations.  Best of all there were a few lighting effects:  a single
strobe, one intella-beam like thing, and something globe-shaped that
looked like a UFO and spun around emitting beams of colored light.  The
guy running the lights would turn things off and on from time to time to 
vary them according to the mood.

Behind the dance area there was a sort of ante-warehouse that featured
a huge futon, and tables selling soda, snapple, espresso, and smart
drinks.

You'd think with such a brilliant set up the party would be a screaming
success, but due to bad politics in the Denver scene it wasn't.  It
seems that about two weeks after Eagle had announced and started flyering 
for Catwoman, another better-known promoter announced his own party for
the same night.  This other promoter even had people standing in the
parking area outside of Catwoman telling people that they were in the
wrong place, that this was a private party and the one they were looking
for was down the road and across the freeway.  When Eagle found out about 
this he told them to leave, but by then the damage had been done.  I
think Catwoman got about 75 people all night, whereas the other party
had several hundred.

Regardless, Catwoman was BEAUTIFUL.  From the time I dropped the first
record of the night the people there were dancing.  Even people standing
on the edge of the floor talking to their friends were bopping up and down.
I played for an hour and a half, mostly the sort of things I was playing at 
the Blue Cube / Friends and Family, and the energy level in the room 
was very high.  Each person was giving off the energy and vibe of like
five people.   Then Louise took over and gave us all a brilliant ride,
playing everything  from one old disco song to trance bordering on hardcore,
with progressive house and bleepy trance in between.  Louise is from
the UK but is now living in Amsterdam, and she strikes me as being a
European version of Heather Heart.  I haven't had so much fun dancing in a
long time.  Over the course of the night people started leaving, and around
3 am it was looking quite sparse.  I remarked to Eagle that it would
probably be better to end it early while everyone is still happy and has a 
positive image of the party than to let it drag on and die.  He said he'd
see how things went.  So, I started a second set at 3.30 am.  By then
there were only about six people dancing, so at 4 (with only two people
still dancing but the rest hanging out and talking happily) we shut off
the music.

I had such a great time though, the people in Denver at Catwoman were
so friendly, and were a mixed group ranging from very young 
raver-archetypes decked out in stripes and baggies to late 20-something
club goers to older net ravers to newbies.  Every single person had
a smile and many many people talked to me while I was hanging out, telling
me about how they got into raving, and asking me about music and how I
liked Denver.  I haven't been around such a great bunch of strangers since
I was in Montreal nearly a year ago.

I was left with so much happy positive energy from the party that I
didn't sleep that night.  We went back to Eric's and then went up to
the skyscraper where he works to see the sunrise, and I also took a
great Body Shop enhanced shower.  On the airplane that morning on the
way back I talked to a first-time visitor to San Francisco about what
kinds of things he should try on his visit.  When I got home Brian and
I went out for an excursion that started in a hardware store in the 
Haight and ended with us walking to the the summit of Mt. Tamalpais.  In
between we went to Muir Beach and played fetch with some very friendly
dogs.  IT WAS THAT KIND OF PARTY!!!!!!!!!  Yippeeee!  (And no, I 
didn't have any stimulants other than some tea at 5am and some espresso
at noon.)

Eagle will be doing more parties in the future, and I'll probably be
back in Denver sometime in the next few months.

Hugs to Laura (Zzar), Eagle, Eric, Kirby, Bart (the cockatiel who sings
along to trance), Zach, Brian@indigo, the man in the hardware store
who knew what I meant about those little brackets, and that shepard-
mix mutt who kept bringing the stick back.

i've been playing acidwarp on my pc for months now; it's gotta be
  the best screensaver i've ever seen...

question: has anyone out there tried hooking up a fresnel lens projector
  to their screen and projecting acidwarp onto a wall? it's discussed
    in acidwarp's online help....

Thanks!

I got a bit confused reading the flyer for the Eighth House . . .

I talked to Philip, the guy organizing it, and it starts at 9.00 pm
not 10.00 pm.  This is next Monday, the 28th.  Hope to see some of you
there!!!  Oh yeah, they have a roofdeck for chilling on, too.

 Winn is a highly sought after lecturer on computer security
matters, and is notorious for "Inside" contacts. It is said the NSA
scoured it's ranks after TERMINAL COMPROMISE came out. T.C. was
released as the first Internet novel (its in softcover as well) and
should be widely available. He is supposed to be a releasing a new
book soon (it may already be out) titled INFORMATION WARFARE.

 Having had the pleasure of meeting and talking at length with
Winn, I am of the opinion that he may be on to something here.

	indeed!  alex's set blew my fucking head off, too bad
	that due to people we were with we had to leave in the
	middle of it...12 bucks wasted really.  it's funny, i 
	was not even in the mood to go to a party, kind of 
	felt like i was not going to enjoy myself even when i
	was walking thru the parkinglot....

	but the *chill rooms*.  granted, there was some scary
	darkness back there, not to mention no light in the 
	men's room, but there was so much great space back
	there.  we went in and sat down, and met a couple of
	very coooool young serial ravers from outta town (north/
	east bay) jen and tony.  they were very cool and shared
	various kinds of smooooooke with us, they were gems.
	we talked alot, they kept asking us if we had been to 
	all these cool parties, they were all massives with 
	poster flyers and stuff.  had never been to ysh, spacelab,
	etc, but hopefully the will.  kind of a function of 
	being ninteen years old though, right?  can't go to cool
	small sf parties because lots of them are in bar spaces
	(except of course for our *rad* parties.)  very very 
	kind people, and that really made the party for us,
	that and alex.

	sound:  pretty decent, though from the get-go one of the
	top cabintes on the stage-left side was defunct, and i hear
	that garth blew the system at the end of the night, which
	he usually does to jk sound's community system.  se la vie.

	lights:  well i diddn't know it but while working for
	impact that afternoon we pulled the order for equinox,
	though i diddn't know who it was for.  kind of funny...
	they had beacons (???) and blacklites and a little fogger.
	also, the visuals were cool, some of the more intense
	analog stuff i have ever seen (well more acoustic than
	analog, being slides and all... )

see you on teevee

I know, everyone has read about it, but I am going to post anyway..
Equinox kicked.  After Jeno's performance at Motion last week and 
my time at Equinox, it looks like things might start improving out here.
We got Equinox pretty damn early, around 11:30, becuase we didn't want to
stay late.  The first DJ seemed to struggle through is set a bit, lots
of budDUMPbuDUMPbuDUMP bass/trainwrecks, but alex of GaiaMantra (right?) was
really cool.  A lot faster than I have heard before, but really damn cool.
James was really brilliant, I agree.  Cool parts?  Well, hearing the
warehouse walls and ceiling rumble with the Bass was cool, the whole place
emanated the music.  The chill zone was fine, I hate too much blue light,
but that's fine, and the smoke machine use was kept to a minimum.  It was a
bit cool, but that's what jackets are for.  It's really too bad more
people didn't show up, especially after Organic got busted and moved to
16th and Harrison.

Oh well. I hope that Equinox throws another party, the same space would be cool, and I hope lots and lots
of people get their tails in gear and go.

Did anyone go to Good housekeeping?  

have a good week...
mike

unless you want to experience a really nice Sunday morning
afterhours that has a totally loving "family vibe".

Equinox ended early, and the crowd that I thought would eventually end
up at Good Housekeeping vanished.  I know that an hour and a half is a
long wait but I can't figure out where everyone went except either home
(or maybe to organic :) anyway, I got to GH at 6:50 and banged on the
door, jsl let me in and I could see that he was busy,  I offered to
jump in and help any way that I could, so I moved a few tables, placed
some lamps etc.  The space is really nice for an afterhours, It has a
grill up front with a few stools so you can sit in the sun (some people
like sunshine).  Further in, there is a long bar and a nice warm and
cozy room with tables and chairs, (a nice change when you've been
sitting on concrete all night) you can get a nice breakfast for cheap.
I got a veggie omlette with homefries, the omlette was great, the
homefries were too greasy, but for $3.50 it was nice (more homefries
next time, and not greasy one!).  I don't drink coffee but it was
available as well.  Also fruit salad, would be a nice addition, who
wants bacon and eggs after a night of watching walls melt :). There was
great reggae and dub playing but not so loud that you couldn't talk
over, and around 9 a.m. the live jazz trio (or was it a quartet?)
kicked in and this was perfect, I really liked the fact that after a
night of raving, I could get something healthy to eat and kick back
with my friends and hear some mellow music.  But I hear someone saying,
I WANT TO DANCE!! I DON'T WANT MELLOW. For all you tweekers and trance
addicts out there don't worry, Good Housekeeping has the shit for you!
In the back, with PERFECT sound isolation from the front I might add
is  the *SOUND VISION* sound system, the room may not be acoustically
perfect, but it is large enough to comfortably handle I'd say 50 or so
ravers, the dance floor is wood, it is dark but classy with a few
mirrors.  Ethan and Bryce take great pains to tweek the system so that
it sounds GREAT, I tried to give Ethan some feedback (from a trance
addict's point of view) of what it takes in terms of treble, mids and
bass, to send me out and I must say that this system WILL deliver the
goods.  Markie has the chicken pocks (and is under HOUSE ARREST , or is
the word qurantine :) so he couldn't be there this weekend, but I just
CAN'T WAIT to hear Markie turned loose in this room and on that system,
(mutha fuckers will be hanging from the rafters, once markie does them
up in there!)  I can clearly see that folks who just can't get enough,
will be content with this back room.  Now folks you will need to come
early because when the secret gets out, I'm sure this place will fill
up quick and if john is smart, he will stop letting people in BEFORE it
gets too crowded and oppressive.  I must say that if you are tired of
the "tweeker's ball" then check out Good Housekeeping.  I'm sure you
will be plesantly surprised!

Equinox report
==============
   Sorta short,   because other people already reported on this one,
but I wanted to say that this party was exceptional...

   After attending a pot luck party on Sat evening,   we head out 
to try and find Equinox.    The directions seemed a tad vague,   but
after calling the number several times,  I get the idea of where it is.

   Along a dark and isolated stretch of road,  as we were driving
around,  this guy with a flashlight indicates that we must have found it.

   There were NO cars parked on the street anywhere near this location
and if I hadn't seen the flashlight,  I would have driven right past it.

   As we turned into the parking area,   I could hear the familiar "boom
boom".    After parking the car in the back,   we headed into an old rancid
warehouse and was surprised to learn it was only $12.    WOW!!  A real
underground rave...  And what a kickin party it was.    It was really
cool inside,   so I immediatly started dancing and had a glorious time
drawing energy from a super sound system.

   My knee is completly healed now,  and for the first time,   I decided
not to bother with my knee brace,   and ice.    I didn't need any of
these,   because in the last 4 days,   during one of my exercise sessions
I heard my knee snap into place,   after that,  I now got full range
of motion and no more pain.   It's wonderful.  For the first time,
I'm fully recovered from my 4 month ago injury,   even my lower back
never complained,  and I dance my butt off.

   Unfortunately,  after Garth's set,  the pigs shut it down.   Sheesh!
Don't understand what dickwad lives out there so far from everywhere
and got bothered by noise.    Anyway,   after a snafu with the car,  
I head over to Good Houskeeping and hung out there for a while,  and
eventually wound up at the End Up,  still dancing until about 4 pm.
WOW!!  Sure feel great today....  Knee not sore anymore,   and I
did my full exercise set for the first time in 4 months.   I got
lots of catching up to do,    but I think I'll be back to my full
high energetic self by this summer to hace a ravin kickin time...

   I heard Organic got moved to Haze theator...  Anyone go to that?
Haven't heard any reports...

Keep the scene alive..

Subject: The IICS CD-ROM Showcase
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

I have attached a copy of the press release that is going out to several
hundred publications in the next week + introducing the first IICS CD-ROM
Showcase.  Inclusion in this CD-Rom will cost nothing to the participants,
although as is always the case, space is limited.

ATTENTION ALL MULTIMEDIA ARTISTS: Read the press release below and get back
to me asap because the next release will probably not be free to
participants.

"From the seed of personal responsibility, 
blossoms the power to change the world."

Mark Sigal 
(hypermrk@crl.com)

                   IICS ANNOUNCES FIRST CD-ROM SHOWCASE

The International Interactive Communications Society (IICS) has
announced the development of their first IICS Multimedia CD-ROM
Showcase.  The IICS is a 10-year-old international non-profit
organization formed to promote, inform, and represent multimedia
professionals by providing information exchange, education,
networking, and support. The CD-ROM will showcase the diversity
of high quality work being created by multimedia artists,
programmers and developers working across the country to
integrate text, sound, graphics, and video into a whole new range of
applications. 

"While there is a tremendous public awareness of so-called
buzz words like 'interactive' and 'multimedia,' few truly
understand the scope of business, consumer and educational
solutions that stand to be realized by this emerging medium,"
says Chris Ray, president of the San Francisco Bay Area chapter
of IICS.  

"This project aims to elevate the concept of interactive
multimedia to a whole new level by highlighting for both
consumers and business leaders the tremendous communication power generated
by this medium."

In undertaking this project, the IICS believes that the Showcase 
will ultimately become the definitive source for viewing examples
of multimedia and locating development talent for hire.  Hence,
with the aim of reaching the widest possible audience, the IICS
Multimedia Showcase will support both Windows and Macintosh
platforms.

Consistent with the organization's non-profit theme, all sales
proceeds will go towards hiring an Executive Director to oversee
the international organization's rapidly growing membership.

Content for the IICS CD-Rom Showcase is being compiled through a
"CALL FOR ENTRIES" from members only. Selected works are included on the disc
at no cost to submitters. Adds Ray, "We wanted to provide artists an initial
no-cost incentive to come out of the woodwork.  Subsequent releases of the
Showcase will almost
assuredly require submission fees on the part of the artists."

The IICS, founded in 1983, is the premier non-profit organization
for individuals involved in the field of interactive multimedia. 
With over 3,000 members, over 20 chapters worldwide and 100%
annual membership growth, the society brings together individuals
of affiliated industries, and provides a forum for learning about
new technologies, ideas, creative influences, professional
services and information on emerging trends.  For membership 
information on the IICS chapter nearest you, call (503) 579-4427.

To request a CALL FOR ENTRIES form, contact Mark Sigal at
HyperMark@AOL.COM or via the Internet at hypermrk@crl.com or call the San
Francisco chapter at (415) 553-2202.

Ethan,
	I'm so glad you guys were there and that you got something out of it.
As I said Sunday, I'm so glad you guys are out there doing what you are

I know this has nothing to do with raves, but i thought you all might 
find this amusing. 
After, i read that letter ( while in my computer lab) i thought it was
funny enough to tell my lab partners. I had said that some girl was
at nemin marcus and wanted the recipe, when one of my lab partners 
stopeed me and said that was his friends older sister. Small world aint it.

Don't believe it.  It's a joke.  I've seen it before, as I'm sure
many others have, although in slightly different form.  It mutates
a bit but it's the same $2.50 vs $250.00 thing.

Take care,

	Yeah, since when does your monthly credit card statement tell you a
breakdown of each individual item you bought?  And since when does a
business charge your card an unknown amount without you signing a
slip and looking at the total?

I think that cookie recipe thing is urban legend because I saw the same
exact story and got a recipe for Mrs. Fields cookies about 3 or 4 years 
ago...Unless it happened at both places.

Actually, yes they are.  I tried them out a couple of years ago when I 
first came across the recipe, but my particular version of the myth 
attributed both the recipe and the $250 charge to Mrs. Field's rather than 
to NM.  Take your choice!

Happy nibbling, Kathryn

I've done shrooms on several occasions and have experienced no adverse 
side effects (other than the desire to sleep) afterwards.  Are there any 
documented (or simply common knowledge) dangers associated with ingesting 
reasonable amounts of this little fungus?

	i have noticed very measurable effects from mushrooms:
	my memory of alphanumeric strings is definitely down for a few
	days: phone numbers, credit card #s, etc...

	also a "burn-out" feel because the mind has been overdriven...

	both of these have gone away the few times I've done mushrooms
	but I do fear that one day they won't. I've seen people who are
	in this state permanently from pot, shrooms, lsd, peyote.

Equinox was the shit!  Ivan & Lacey have done it again with a great party,
in a great space.  Directions could've used some help but overall a REAL UG
party!  As stated before, it was in a really large warehouse with plenty of
room, plenty of ventillation.  The music was pretty good overall.  Was
sorry to not hear Jeno that night, but James MORE than made up for it!
James fucked it up, playing some really hard trippy shit that had the whole
place moving (I dunno what GeoffW means by people were just standing
around)!  Everytime I hear James recently he keeps getting better, and
better.  '94 has his name written all over it!  He was tellin that tale
with the TT's!  Fuck yeah!

Nice one for Ivan & Lacey, nice one for the community!  Keep it REAL, and
that is exactly what they did!

Good Housekeeping went well.  Special thanks to Ethan and Bryce who have
probably THE best sound system in SF!  They really put alot of heart into
it and it showed!  Overall a fairly good "family vibe", which is exactly
what we wanted to achieve.  The space is really nice for a Sunday morning
thing, and as time goes on will prove to be an excellent venue for those
who want to chill out, or trip out, without all the pagentry.  I was VERY
pleased to see a few of the SFR posse around like Moni, Tom, The Capn', and
Lee Fogel (a real pleasure to finally meet him!).  Thanks for your support!
I also want to thank the crew at 1190 for being great people to deal with!
The live Jazz was kickin' and we will continue with the live music since
that is what we're all about.

There were the usual fumbles, fouls, and foibles that happen during a first
gig.  But these kinks have already been worked out and things will be alot
smoother this next go around.  So if you're hungry and wanna eat, chill
out, or even DANCE, please stop by and say hello.  It's all about THAT!
And keep your eyes peeled since we will usually have two to three guest
spots open for the *newcomers* and veteran TT technicians in the area!
Becuase it's all about THAT!

Also a special thanks to everyone who attended!

Future plans - Looking forward to Ethan & Bryce doing their magic in the
future (is this a blatant hint or what), and booking a wide variety of
fresh female talent.  So get me a tape or let me know when you're playing
next so's I can catch ya' (big hint).

Overall a good weekend.  Time to get some sleep for this Sunday and other
activities (like 20Hz, special edition shirts, etc.).

Pax,
John

I haven't been watching the list very closely, but I'm still pretty
sure that nobody has mentioned the article about techno in the April
issue of Rolling Stone.

Titled, "Welcome to the Machine (The Techno Revolution Comes to Your
Town)", the article opens with a four paragraph descrition of the
Halloween FMR!  The author (Sue Cummings) even refers to "DJ Garth" as
"one of the stars of the bay area rave scene", and the FMR as "one of
the most authentic examples of a ritual that has spread from the West
Coast to other U.S. Cities."

The article goes on about techno and how it is the only music that has
remained 'underground' (rap and punk don't qualify anymore :).  Stuff
on Moby and Orbital too.

Interesting reading because this is from Rolling Stone Magazine, our
national canon of pop/music culture.  Anthony Kiedis on the cover, FMR
on page 15!

Welcome to the mainstream, y'all!

Or better yet, just put in your own two line summary of their article,

In all the journals and texts and other materials I've read on
psychoactives, I've never come across anything that suggested that
psilocin and psilocybin have any long term effects. That doesn't mean
they don't, but it means that if they do, the effects are subtle, or
it's very likely the medical community would have noticed by now.

I'd say it's a safe bet that your average hamburger has far more long
term toxicity than a dose of shrooms.

William James, *The Varieties of Religious Experience*, 1902, p 76:

   "If we were to ask the question: 'What is human life's chief concern?' one  
of the answers we should receive would be: 'It is happiness.'  How to gain,  
how to keep, how to recover happiness, is in fact for most men at all times  
the secret motive of all they do, and of all they are willing to endure.  The  
hedonistic school in ethics deduces the moral life wholly from the experiences  
of happiness and unhappiness which different kinds of conduct bring; and, even  
more in the religious life than in the moral life, happiness and unhappiness  
seem to be the poles round which the interest revolves.  We need not go so far  
as to say with the author whom I lately quoted that any persistent enthusiasm  
is, as such, religion, nor need we call mere laughter a religious exercise;  
but we must admit that any persistent enjoyment may *produce* the sort of  
religion which consists in a grateful admiration of the gift of so happy an  
existence; and we must also acknowledge that the more complex ways of  
experiencing religion are new manners of producing happiness, wonderful inner  
paths to a supernatural kind of happiness, when the first gift of natural  
existence is unhappy, as it so often proves itself to be."

	I believe our scene has already overcome the "threat" of 
popularization.  Its been on TV before and in many articles previous to 
this.  And yes we have seen the downsides of popularization with some of 
the huge parties and bad people around here, but as long as there are people 
like us who keep attending the small intimate parties and keep the vibe 
alive, the scene will survive in one form or another.  
	How did you find out about this scene?  I am willing to bet that 
many of us heard about how cool these weird rave things were and a friend 
of yours happened to know when and where some party was gonna be held so 
you went.  Now I realize that a friend telling you where a party is and a 
national magazine reviewing a rave are very different but if it hasn't 
become "too" popular by now I doubt it ever will.
	I really don't see any problem with the popularization of the 
rave scene.  Whats wrong with a bunch of people getting the chance 
to experience a rave and to maybe enlighten their thinking a bit. They 
might get the chance to share the love and family spirit of a rave.  I 
really would not mind if everybody in the world got this chance to feel 
the same thing as we do every time we go to a party.  Wow if you can work 
through the wordiness of that last sentence then you are on the right track.
	Anyway I just wanted to share my thoughts on the popularization 
of the scene.  I know that the practicality of my thinking is low but 
at least it sounds good in theory.  It doesn't hurt to try.  We always 
need to bring new people into the scene to keep it going as we fade out, 
don't be elitist.  You were on the outside at one time too, and now that 
you're "in" don't forget that.  I do understand that making it hard to 
get in does make for a better group but there must be a limit.
	Please rebut any area of my ideas if you deem it necessary.  Two 
(or two hundred) minds are better than one.  You only enhance your 
thinking by comparing it to someone else's.

Peace,

I get the exact opposite effect. I feel smarter afterwards than I do 
before, more energetic, and sharper (not more ascerbic) too.

Nothing else has those after Efx. Perhaps it's cuz those are the first
alterant I ever did (regular highschool pilgrimages to disneyland while
expanded -- the epiphany of mr toad's wild ride...)

I agree totally.  In fact, the first thread I remember on this subject
was the first thread I posted to in sfraves... in april of 1992.  This
was just before the height of the "scene" for me.

What exactly is a 'dose' of shrooms.  I've never taken shrooms and have 
little idea how much one is supposed to take.  

Can anyone give general effects it has.  Can those effects make it better 
at a 'rave'?

I wouldn't mind either.  I'm planning bringing some friends that have 
never been to a rave.  Everyone should attend at least once and let them 
see for themselves what's going on.  I find it hard to answer when a 
friend asks "So, how is it?"  People need to come and experience it 
(hopefully, at a kick ass rave.)

For a first time shroom eater I would recommend two to three dried grams.
Also this is an intense experience and will probably be more fruitful if 
you chose an appropriate environment and are in a good mental space and 
ready for some inner exploration. I don't recommend heavey doses of 
schrooms at raves unless they are outdoors and on a deep vibe.

For more in depth info on mushrooms check out any book or tape from 
Terence McKenna. If you would like more info on McKenna or are 
intereseted in forming a study group e-mail me privately and we can talk.

 i have noticed very measurable effects from mushrooms:

        also a "burn-out" feel because the mind has been overdriven...

personaly don't notice anything from one time but in the past have gone t
through periods of "consistent" use and noticed "strange nueral behavior" 
for up to a month or two afterwards.  Always goes away with abstinence.
I suspect either an acumulation effect or a prolonged brain chemistry
imbalance that takes time and abstinence to correct itself.  As far as
people who are in this state permanently that's due to heavy continual use
with no periods of abstinence and/or something else is going on with the

I've done shrooms on several occasions and have experienced no adverse
side effects (other than the desire to sleep) afterwards.  Are there any
documented (or simply common knowledge) dangers associated with ingesting
reasonable amounts of this little fungus?

For me, the comedown from acied was very hard, and involved a major loss
of physical coordination (no rhythm), not to mention bad aural feedback
in my head and a general feeling of being fucked up, like my body and mind
had been pushed way too hard.  The day after was a bit harsh, too.

Mushrooms, on the other hand, left me with a euphoric feeling of having
come through the fire of an intense experience.  I felt spent, 
but incredibly energized, and didn't experience any long-term adverse
effects.  On the contrary, my spiritual health was greatly enhanced.

Hint:  Mushrooms and man-made environments don't mix well.  Be with
nature in a beautiful place.

Hint 2:  Think of some question or reason you are 'doing mushrooms'.  What
are you looking for?  The mushroom will always come back with an answer, 
if you listen for it -- not as a voice from above but as understanding.

Doing psychedelics as a way to pass time is a bad idea.  If you wish
too hard to be permanently altered you might actually get your wish,
and you will have traded a drab reality for a drab reality with tracers
and fugue states.

Subject: burnout vs toxicity
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


On witnessing burnout:
	I have known several very bright and knowledgable people
	who were very healthy- emotionally, mentally, and physically,
	whose minds deteriorated with prolonged use of psychadelics.
	I can think of 10 people offhand- including relatives. 
	Most of them either smoked pot every day or took heavy
	psychadelics every weekend.

On post-drug mental states:
	My personal opinion is that hallucinogens force more input to
	the mind than it is designed for. For some this can produce a
	fine "broken-in" effect like broken in shoes- well worn and
	perfect fit. 
	For others it seems to make them very intelligent- ever known
	anyone who was a stoner and great student who had endless appetites
	for studying? My heavy pot user friends and I came up with the
	reason for this: heavy pot use destroys your minds ability to
	multitask. With heavy use you become less *distracted* during
	non-stoned times because you *aren't* multitasking. Under these
	conditions its far easier to be a great student, programmer,
	or whatever else you do that requires concentration.

My personal observations:

	I used to be a very angry and argumentative person. I set out
	on a mission to "burn" this part of my mind out by overdriving
	it enough to destroy the endless desire for conflicts thate I seemed
	to have. After several doses of mushrooms and pot I got the 
	exact results. However along with that came a slight tint of apathy-
	kind of a slacker attitude.

Just because psychadelics aren't toxic doesn't mean that they don't have
long term effects. I would suggest to anyone who plans to try mushrooms,
LSD, E, Opium, Peyote, PCP that they very carefully think through what they
are doing before because they may very well come out a different person
after the experience.

Infrequent pot use doesnt' seem to have any real effects- however my pot
use was a very very intense concentrated (thc extract) one.

My advice for using mushrooms (stemming from personal experience only):

Take care of yourself nutritionaly, be well rested (REM sleep releases
neurochemicals essential for mental balance), avoid stimulants (caffiene
in particular), be with people you know and love, and don't do anything
you don't feel comfortable with.  I did not do these things once 
and suffered pretty bad consequences.  I was more or less cooked for
about a month afterwards, had to drop out of school because I couldn't
leave the house alone (no joke).  I eventually went to the doctor and
he determined that through a combination of things (not the mushrooms
alone) I temporarily threw off my neurochemistry.  He was able to
treat my physiological imbalances but the psychological trauma followed
me for a year+/- afterwards.  Three years later I still suffer from
an occasional anxiety attack.  These attacks are purely psychological
ususally triggered off when something reminiscent of the experience
occurs.  As time has passed they seem to happen less frequently
and I imagine soon I will be rid of them completetly.  

By telling this story I'm not trying to scare anyone away from
using mushrooms or any other substance for that matter.  Prior
to this experience I had used mushrooms for about a year with no
ill effects, quite the contrary, I loved them.  I had wonderful
times with them and learned so much about life, people and myself. 
They were really helpful to me in a number of ways, and even the
above experience was very educational and I wouldn't change a thing
about it.  I look back now and laugh at some of the weird shit
that went on in my head.  :)  I was lucky though, I had *extremely*
supportive family and friends.  I've seen others that don't
have the same support network as I do go through experiences similar
to mine and they did not come through as well as I did.

Much of the ingredients in the get well recipe that my doctor
perscribed me are avaliable at health food stores, if anyone
is interested drop some email my way.  Now as a matter of course
I take the supplements after any psychedelic type experience and
am usually less spun afterwards (if not completely normal) than 
those with me that don't take them.  (Could be a psychosomatic
response, but hey if it works...)

Take care,
CC

shrooms:    
    the only long term effects i've noticed from taking shrooms
    is now i dislike consumerism more and sitcoms seem even
    more stupid than before.  sunsets and cirrus clouds always
    look more awsome.  i like purples more.  i dont think its
    effected my intellect (i still cant spell though), i program
    computers for a living and have no more bugs than before :).
    resonate's friends must have gorged themselves with
    buckets-o-shrooms and papertowel sized tabs of acid cuz i
    havent experienced those kinds of things...pot does make
    you lazy though - IMO only use it *AFTER* you've done those
    oh so important life things first.  ah, the reward.

king st:
    i'll be there saturday (i hope).  just look for the tall
    guy with dialated pupils - maybe.

cookies:
    damn im hungry.  someone email me a cookie!

From: Jeremy Greenwood <jgreenw@extro.ucc.su.OZ.AU>:

The best medical evidence would suggest no long-term toxicity associated
with psiloc(yb)in. Anecdotal evidence would suggest that the effects of
this drug are less likely to cause short term adverse reactions than
"harder" psychedelics such as LSD and DO*. Most users report less
post-session fatigue after psiloc(yb)in than most other psychedelics,
and certainly less than for many of the phenethylamines. The dangers
of chronic repeated ingestion are of course unknown, but it would
be reasonable to assume that the brain will readjust and compensate
under this kind of stress, (i.e. receptor populations might change
and their function might be down/upgraded). This would translate into
differences in the unintoxicated brain, but whether or not these 
differences would be of any significance is unknown. Such changes in
the biases of the mechanics of the brain could also be expected to
be reversible once the exposure was discontinued. Certainly there
are no reports of major neurological change associated with the use
of psilocin. However, it should be noted that psychedelics often
exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenics and other mentally imbalanced
people, including those with borderline psychoses, and thus such
people should be discouraged from using such substances, particularly
on a regular basis.

In essesnce, psilocin is as safe as any recreational drug could ever
be expected to be. It is very similar to endogenous compounds, and
as such is easily dealt with by the body and the brain.

I suspect that long term changes with most psychedelics are due to
psychological and not physiological phenomena.  Likely exceptions are
THC and MDMA; more study is needed.  Overdoing any activity is a good
way to bring about negative change. One needs to keep a good balance.

Also, don't overlook those who use drugs to escape depression or other
problems. There is a strong correlation then between heavy drug use
and negative personal change, but one needs to see the whole picture.

At one time in my life, computers were my escape. My focus became
laser-sharp, my ability to accomplish things was phenomenal.  But
everyday life dropped away into a haze. I stopped taking care of
myself, my depression deepened. I lived only to be on the computer,
spinning stuff in my head into computer programs on the screen.

Well I survived, but make no mistake, if it weren't computers, it
would have been something else. And my behavior to other people was
very unfocused and unreal, not unlike a major "pothead".

Perhaps the best thing to do is more studies of people in certain drug
use patterns. Then we'll know.

One of the interesting things about MDMA is it's entirely likely that
heavy use over long periods of time causes a certain amount of long
term damage to the seratonergic system. And yet those who have used
over a long period of time show the exact opposite kinds of changes
one would expect with this sort of damage.  The users report being
happier, more open, and less aggressive. 

But as Steve said, one should think carefully before doing
psychoactives. It is serious stuff; one should consider the reasons
one wishes to try them, and consider one's own state of mind.

	ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS MY ****OPINION***** ONLY!
	IT IS NOT SCIENTIFIC FACT OR ANY OTHER FACT. USE AT YOUR
	OWN RISK.


	heres my opinion on how to choose if drugs r 4 u.

	do you feel *fear* of taking them? if so then DONT.
	if you are a bit nervous thats one thing- but FEAR is a sign
	that you should not be trying this stuff out.

	do you feel comfortable in large crowds? this is a sign
	that you may do well with drugs. large crowds make a person
	vulnerable physically yet also are very intense and stimulating.
	if you enjoy large crowds and feel comfortable like this then
	this is an indicator that drugs *may* work well for you.

	do you have a history of mental illness in you family? if you
	do then i would seriously recommend drugs. they may be the
	catalyst....

	do you feel that you can gain a large amount of knowledge or
	experience from drugs? if you do then drugs are NOT for you.
	knowledge and experience, in large quantities, come from simply
	LIVING and gettin out there in the world. drugs are an *enhancer*.
	they are a *tool* for interpreting things in a different way- they
	are NOT a golden ray of light streaming into your mind and teaching
	you. if thats what you are looking for then you may consider getting
	into religion- but not drugs.

	and most importantly: do you feel that you have a great deal of
	control in your life? if so than when put to the test- when you
	are incapacitated, then you will do better than people who feel
	very vulnerable all the time. however if you are a control-fiend
	then you may not do so well with drugs. control-fiends usually have
	problems when they realize that they no longer have control.

	Read Substance D by Phillip K Dick. the best book about drugs
	I've ever read.

Sorry it took so long to get this nailed down, but it's happenin'.


S U N  E N T E R S  H O U S E  O F  A R I E S 
Okay you rams, come butt heads at this all-inclusive aries birthday 
lunch. Carmen girlfriend-extrordinaire, will be still giddy from her 21st 
birthday the day before and will be leading the fake id beauty contest.
Nifty e-flyer can be spied on the techno ftp site (ARIES.GIF).

Saturday March 26th our roof deck will be open to wayward sfravers from 
about 1 or 2 til dark. Barbeque your lunch whilst contemplating the 
majestic view of Sutro tower, downtown sanfran and the King Diner. Frolic 
in the sun while hearing the sweetly gentle babbling of MUNI buses and 
the heart-warming song of car alarms. 

Bring your butts on down to our central SF location with easy access to 
freeways, public transportation, grocery stores, pawn shops and the party 
you're probably going to try to sneak into later. BBQ available, so bring 
something to grill. (true rams eat their food raw...but then I guess 
they're vegetarians...and they don't have opposable thumbs...and...)

The where: 920 Natoma street (it's the purple one) just off of tenth 
           street between Mission and Howard.

The how:   from East 'n South bay take 101 north once you get into the 
           City (that's a capital 'c' to you, mister) and get off at the 
	   Mission St. / Van Ness exit. Turn right on Mission and turn 
	   right again on 11th street (city tow on the corner). Turn left 
	   onna second alleyway (Natoma) onna left. 920 is at the end of
	   the block onna left. Push either first or second buzzer. Say
	   the password and yer in!

	   City Dwellers, well if you read that above, you probably know 
	   all you need anyway. For MUNItics (like me), the Van Ness station
	   is durn close. Go up to eleventh, turn right and follow 
	   directions above. Closest major intersection is Van Ness/Mkt.

	   If'n you get lost call 4152557126 for roadside assist-ants.

The Why:   well, just because.

If anyone is still reading, we could use another grill to make sure 
everyone is accomodated. I'm throwing somes tapes together as I type, but 
If anyone wants to bring some music, yer more than welcome to get us 
drooling at your finds. Unfotunately, I couldn't line up the turntables 
for this one, but hey it's a lunch. Maybe next time. Hope to see you there.

JOHN and CARMEN.

What exactly is a 'dose' of shrooms.  I've never taken shrooms and have
little idea how much one is supposed to take.

Can anyone give general effects it has.  Can those effects make it better
at a 'rave'?
-------------------------------------------------------------

1-3 grams are a good "introdutory" dose, after that take it from there.

Read any standard description of a psychedelic experience and that will give
you an idea of the possibilites but they realy are endless.  Also add to
that description a possible slight feeling of nausea at first although it's
also not uncommon for some people to feel more than a slight feeling or to
throw up (but than it's usualy over and they feel great).  

You could have a wonderful time at a rave or a not so good one.  Try it in
a more controlled environment for your first time.

	For a first time shroom eater I would recommend two to three dried grams.
	Also this is an intense experience and will probably be more fruitful if 
	you chose an appropriate environment and are in a good mental space and 
	ready for some inner exploration. I don't recommend heavey doses of 
	schrooms at raves unless they are outdoors and on a deep vibe.

enforcement can unscramble. It also backs legislation requiring
design of digital communications networks so ongoing surveillance
will be feasible.

Law enforcement officials argue that these proposals are necessary
to protect society from criminals and preserve important
investigative tools.

Privacy advocates contend that these proposals grant broad new
powers to law enforcement agencies and diminish protection for
future users of the National Information Infrastructure.

I'm no expert, but the best info I've found so far is:

1-2 medium fresh shrooms
1-3 grams of dried shrooms (far less potent)

I think the low end of this dosage will give you a pretty solid trip,
so beginners should start there. Or less if it makes you nervous.

Doing a lot of mushrooms can take you way WAY out there. Have a
tripsitter. Fortunately, you come down a lot faster than with LSD
(which can be annoying at times).

My personal opinion has always been more like the opposite of this.  
I think hallucinogens make you dumb, so "dumb" that the obvious becomes
revelatory.  This insight or vision of your more basic levels of
functioning can be very new and exciting or scary or funny.

Advice - 2 grams can be *strong* depending on the mushrooms.  I know lots
of people who took 1 gram (or less) for the first time.

It's all you baby, and your state of mind.  Be comfortable.

I think it is very social - do it with friends.
Lower doses with buddies can make you feel like a special little group
exploring a goofy new place together.

I disagree with the "nature connection" just because it is organic.
That seems like a fine trip (Huxley?) but certainly isn't the only one.
If big man-made things bug you then avoid them.  
It is not the drug it is you.

my guess is that this is a typo.  if you have a history of mental
illness, you should definitely NOT do psychoactive drugs.

i have two good friends who both have a history of mental illness in
the family, both of whom ended up in mental hospitals for a while
after LSD usage.  one case was prolonged usage along with pot, the
other case involved occasional weekend usage over a period of a couple
years.

i'm not trying to panic anyone, just the facts.  my mom is a mental
health professional (20 years, currently supervising Western State
Hospital in Steilacoom WA) and has seen that in many cases,
psychoactives can "unmask" underlying personality disorders,
especially schizophrenia.  (official research pointers, anyone?)

that all said, i have literally dozens of friends who have engaged in
psychoactive drug use and have been very happy with the insights
gained.

as usual, just another monkey pushing the little buttons,
Bob

Locations:

The only place not to take a psychedelic is someplace
that you don't want to be at.  If you are happy where you
are than the location should be fine.  One of my more
memorable experiences was in a friend's house.  Definate man
made environment but a place I was very comfortable in.
Due to the lack of new stimulation the experience was much
more halucinatory and also more social.

Doses:

This is *really* subjective.  Body weight, empty stomach vs full
stomach, and all of that.  It also depends on ones current
mental state.  Not to mention the age of the mushrooms, what soil
were they grown in, have they been travelling (temperature extremes
(I've heard) affects potency).  But for the sake of not seeming
too vague I'd have to agree with whoever it was that suggested
starting at 1/3 of an 8th for the first time.  If one has had
previous psychedelic experience a higher starting point should be
fine.  But don't bring expections into the trip based on past 
experience with other drugs.  I've seen that throw people for a loop.
Different drug=different experience.  Sounds simple, but it's
easily forgotten.  I've also found with mushrooms that more does
not necessarily mean better.  Although it can, but sometimes more
just means nausea.

All of the above is IMO only.  But after the not so pleseant experience
that I've already told you all about I did do some research in
order to find out exactly what had happened. 

Take care,
CC

The number of grams also depends on the freshness and strain of shroom 
you're taking. I rec 2-3 if you want to have a real intro to the realm of 
psychedelia. Shroom guru and philospher Terence McKenna suggests doing a 
heroic dose of 5grams to really tap into the Gaian Mind. Of course the 
final decision should be on the part of the injestor

Regarding Terence McKenna.

Bibliography

The Invisible Landscape - 1975?  	Seabury Press NY
(This is an analysis of the King Wen sequence of the I Ching. This 
knowledge was revealed to Terence during an extended high bandwidth 
connection with the GAIAN MIND in the early '70's in Central America. 
This work forms the basis of his Timewave Zero theory which deal with the 
ingression of novelty and the end of HIStory in 2012 (coincedentally? also 
the end of the Mayan calendar)

Mushroom Growers Guide- (With Dennis McKenna)	?
(Published under a pseudonym in late '70's early '80's. Require botanical 
skills and could be detrimental to your well being in Police State America)

The Archaic Revival- 		Harper S.F.1991
(This is the best intro to Mckenna's thought. It is a collection of 
articles and talks from various mags and lectures. The text could have 
been edited a bit better but it is still a pleasure to read and packed 
with compelling stories/information/knowledge.)

Food Of The Gods-	? 1992
(This is a radical history of the relationship between psychedelic plants 
and the evolution of conscioussness.)

Trialogues At The Edge of The West: Chaos Creativity and The 
Resacrilization of the World (w/ Rupert Sheldrake & Ralph Abraham)
(This text is highly recommended. A very interesting discussion between 
three of the most important and hopeful contemporary thinkers.)
Bear & Co., Santa Fe 1992

True Hallucinations		Harper S.F. 1993
(This should be read like literature. It is a rant. Not his best text but 
worthwhile none the less.)

Sound Video

I recommend the Space/Time Continuum CD. Very good intro which I find 
entertaining. The video is the shit!!! very well done & "trippy"
Available from Rose X Media House S.F. email me for more info)
There is also a film version available. It is playing in S.F. now tell 
your local independent cinema to pick this up.

My Two Cents On T.M.

Many people try to discredit Terence by saying he's a wacked out crazy 
druggy.Well he is not. He is a very talented philosopher and poet who is 

trying to help our species wake up and celebrate the wonder of chaos and 
gnosis instead of annhilating eachother in a patriarchal bloodbath of 
ecological degradation, social decay and political violence.

I'm open for further discussion and would be interested in starting a 
small study group in the Bay Area.

I was at a club the other day and I asked the person at the door how to 
have a fun weekend.  The person at the door said that would be two-fifty
and I charged it to my Visa (being at the mythical club which takes 
credit cards).  When I got my Visa bill I found out the info was not
$2.50 but $250, so to get my money's worth I'm going to share the info
with all of you...

Mix the following:
1/2 cup ambience
1       full moon
1 plate spuds n stuff from Good Housekeeping
1/8     House (actually 1 Eighth House)
2       BBQ Tofu
1       additional ingredient of your choice.

Bake for as long as you want.  Do not sleep till finished. ;)

hi folx,
i would like to try something if you all are up for it. i'd like to
try a 'guided visualisation' on the connections between quantum physics
and spirituality. the idea would be that i'd be talking over some
ambient musick, and the topic would be this connection between quantum
physics and what we call spirituality, the higher self, etc. so i need
someone who spins ambient musick to give my fist gig! it is kinda like
the terrance mckenna thing but with some quantum physics in it.
can i get a ( ambienat dj) witness ?
take care/shalom/acid+bass

Ovid,

I can recomend M Normal as an ambient DJ.  IN fact  she DJ'd at a
Terrance Mckenna event in SF not too long ago.  Since (as you know)
I am very interested in the connection between quantumphysics and what 
we call spirituality, let me know if there's any way I can be of
help.

Are shrooms the kinmd of thing where you can judge along the way and
   boosterize yourself, like many other substances?

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


I hate to be a killjoy but it sort of gives me the creeps
or something to see such an extended open discussion of
drug use.  Sort of discounts any statements that raving
is about fellowship and the music and not only about drugs.

By the way, the alt.psychoactives group covers a lot of this
stuff, and some real experts post there.  Their FAQ's are a
good place to get information.

I don't see how we can talk about raving and not talk openly about
drugs, because for most, at one time or another, it is part of the
experience. And a lot of clue needs to be passed around about these
substances, what they do, and how to not get bitten.

The gopher archive at techno is a wonderful resource, and I highly
recommend people go there for detailed information. At the same time,
it's good to get live reports and people's opinions on things.

I'm emphatically on record as saying "raving is not about drugs".
Drugs are NOT the point. But they are, for a lot of people, part of
the experience. Might as well acknowledge that.

However, the discussion taking place here involves responsible drug use 
and people sharing information so that otheres new to the experience have 
the best possible one.

This is most defintely in the vein fellowship, IMO.

Actually the Psychedelics Encyclopedia reports that many people report
that the dried shrooms ARE MORE POTENT than the wet ones.

TALES FROM THE MONTEREY RAVE POSSE........Last week, on a note taken from
sfraves, Forrest and I adventured out to "Motion" to see Rick Preston and
Jeno. A singularly cosmic evening was had by all, and driven by Jeno-Energy I
fired through work, teaching my ass off and Shakespeare's. 

Armed with the knowledge that Rick would be playing THIS Wednesday at Motion,
I stayed late a work, and planned for another mid-week fix of rave juice.
Driving from Monterey to SJ, I cranked a Rick Preston tape taken from a
summer Groove Kitchen, and prepared myself.

When I got there, Rick was already finishing his set!!! He decided to play
the One spot, and let DJ Tara, play number Two, before Spun, thus giving her
more exposure and spotlight. She had been billed to play number One. It was a
 genuinely magnanimous offering  on Rick's part, so I couldn't be upset about
missing his set again. (BTW, I drove from Monterey to Sonoma for the Vision
Rave last summer, only to find out Rick had already played.) Besides, DJ Tara
turned out to be a great surprise!

Although some of the seams were a little uneven, and the energy drooped in a
few places, Tara's set was a good mix of tribal, house and acid-jazz. It was
great to see her looking up, smiling, and checking to see how everyone was
doing, and making eye contact. She looked like she was enjoying herself,
dancing a little between those mechanical DJ motions, even though their were
a few tentative traces of fear. But, the crowd responded, and the music
happened. And since this was my second time at Motion, and my first time with
a female DJ, I didn't even notice that the dance floor is still slanted!!!
Next week at Motion is TONY, and the following week is GARTH, so look for
continuing tales from the Monterey Rave Posse...

By the by.....about the Mushroom, I noticed, since resuming after a 10 year
hiatus, that my Mush-E-Room cocktails are the best. However, now that I'm
older (42) the pleasures I take are more in the moment and physical, but
regrets and fears are rooted more deeply in ideas and in the past.

Hmmm perhaps I better clarify. Drying shrooms decreases their potency
by at least half, mostly because the psilocin--which is even more
psychoactive than the psilocybin--is unstable and readily oxidizes.
Therefore the same shrooms do less for you once dried.

Now while drying shrooms makes them 2-3 times less potent, it also
reduces their weight by a factor of about 100, making dried shrooms
FAR more potent on a weight-by-weight basis.

Tara is awesome :). She can lay just totally JAMMIN house grooves that
shred your body, and like Susan she has a wonderful sense for when to
pull in some acid or PHAT, and just keeps you moving the whole time.

She's been spinning at Your Sister's House for a while, and it's good
to hear she's spinning at other places! Yay Tara!!!

BTW, she'll be spinning at YSH on the 31st, and I just can't WAIT!
(arrgh! the 31st is NEVER going to get here...)

I was thinking. Isn't March the month of the birth of sfraves? 
Because Connection 2 occured in March.

RAVE SOCIALIZATION AND INDUCTION
draft e 18 Feb 94  Copyright (c) 1994 by Robert Jesse

Raves had their beginnings as outgrowths from nightclub social gatherings 1  
singles dance clubs, "acid house parties", high energy gay dance clubs, etc.   
These early outgrowth events, proto-raves, were generally modest-sized  
celebrations created by and shared among friends, not for profit, held in  
non-commercial spaces or outdoors.  Not being intended to "draw a crowd"  
beyond the first circle of friends, they were not publicized.

In order to understand how proto-raves grew into the kinds of events now  
called raves, it is necessary to understand the social atmosphere that evolved  
at the early events, how this emergent social atmosphere differed from  
available alternatives, what people valued about the experience, and how  
newcomers were inducted into the scene.
 

Proto-raves were, in outward form, similar to nightclub events , with loud  
dance music, dancing, beverages, social interaction, and sometimes psychedelic  
drugs.  However the social environment and interactions at proto-raves were  
markedly different from those at an ordinary nightclub.  In order to make this  
contrast as clear as possible, we intentionally present perhaps an extreme  
view of "ordinary" non-rave nightclub phenomena.  There is, of course, a great  
variety to be found in nightclubs as well as "raves".

At ordinary nightclubs, many implicit and explicit rules of social conduct  
apply, perhaps more than in most of daily life:  There may be a dress code,  
enforced at the door.  Are you of the right race, age, sexual orientation, and  
socioeconomic stratum to "belong" in this place?  Club-goers expend  
considerable psychic energy in appearing desirable, hip, and cool.  They  
monitor their behaviors for compliance with local norms for how to stand, hold  
a drink, scan the room, move, and interact.   


Complex protocols apply to interactions as simple as eye contact.   Looking at  
somebody of the opposite sex (in a heterosexual environment) may well be  
interpreted by the target as a sexual overture; returning such a glance is an  
early sign of reciprocated interest.  A male must avoid eye contact with  
unknown males, lest it be taken, with immense discomfort, as a homosexual  
advance .  Dancing without a partner in most clubs is discouraged as "weird,"  
and while two or more heterosexual females may be permitted to dance in a  
group, males must never do so.  Dance styles are constrained within  
"acceptable" limits, neither too fast nor too slow, too animated nor too dull.    
Dancers imitate each other rather than allow a personal style to emerge  
creatively.

With all these standards of conduct, one fears "mistakes" (violations of  
convention), occasionally makes "mistakes", and expends more energy in anguish  
over them.  Still more energy goes into forcing a confident smile to cover  
one's uneasiness.   It is easy to see how some nightclub goers might not  
really have much spontaneous, genuine fun (they say, though, that they're  
"having a great time!").   Of those who seem at ease, many of them are  
enjoying the process of acting out the role expected of them, rather than  
enjoying the natural expression of their true selves.  Indeed it is difficult  
even to discover a true self in a society that makes self-expression risky and  
rewards the acting out of a few, approved roles instead. 


The nightclub environment becomes more tense when some people deliberately  
manipulate others in attempts to "pick up" partners, fostering distrust and  
defensiveness.  Add to this the widespread use and abuse of alcohol,  
potentiating male aggressive behaviors, violence, and promiscuity.  It is not  
surprising then that in crowded nightclubs, under great peer scrutiny, users  
of LSD and similar psychedelics occasionally have unpleasant experiences.

Though difficult to document, it seems likely that the incorporation of MDMA  
into private house parties and into the nightclub scene generated the seed for  
the contrasting social environment that emerged in raves.  Users of MDMA  
typically feel a profound safety, love of self, and unconditional positive  
regard for others.  From this self-secure base, it is natural to drop  
pretense.  MDMA users smile and emit other signs of acceptance and  
appreciation to those around them, rewarding others in their expressions of  
self.  These effects are reinforced by music (see below) designed to  
facilitate ecstatic dancing and altered states of consciousness, and sometimes  
by visual images suggesting themes of love, acceptance, global awareness and  
stewardship.

In a setting with some critical mass of MDMA users, the climate changes  
sufficiently so that even those not under the influence of MDMA are drawn into  
the new social patterns ("contact high").  Eye contact and smiles shared  
between strangers are no longer necessarily the beginnings of the mating  
ritual; they can be seen simply as shared expressions of fun. 


MDMA's tactile enhancement rewards physical contact, and the sense of safety  
makes human touch non-threatening.  Thus people who do not share romantic  
interest can enjoy hugs and hand-holding without concern over  
inappropriateness.  Convincing evidence of this is seeing heterosexual males  
show friendliness towards each other physically, acts all the more remarkable  
for occurring in the age groups where homophobia is usually strongest.  These  
behaviors among ravers extend outside raves and to times when they are not  
under the influence of MDMA.

MDMA's enhancement of the sense of proprioception makes physical movement 1  
dance 1 feel wonderful, and the drug's enrichment of audition makes rhythm and  
music seductive.   With no peer expectations regarding style, a heightened  
sensation of physical grace, the pleasure of movement, and smiles from others  
rewarding original expression, dance can induce ecstatic joy.   The endorphins  
released by sustained exercise reinforce this feeling.

Electronic mail (to "sfraves") and other personal accounts document the claims  
of many ravers that especially good rave experiences are among the most  
rewarding experiences of their lives.  Some say that raves have permitted for  
them an unprecedented blossoming of self,  and that the "rave culture"  
supports their ongoing spiritual development.

It is this unburdening, this freedom of being, this unfettered fun, that  
ravers cite so often as a major attraction to the rave scene.  It is probably  
what the proto-ravers told their friends about, and why some of those friends  
asked to be taken to the next rave.  Such word-of-mouth (or electronic mail)  
publicity and personal guidance was the only means of growth for the rave  
scene while raves remained "underground" - unadvertised, on unpredictable  
dates, and at unpredictable locations.

When an experienced raver introduces a friend to the scene, the newcomer may  
receive practical advice on the time and duration of the upcoming rave,  
appropriate adjustment or allocation of sleep time, safe and effective use of  
psychedelics, transportation logistics, etc.  Perhaps more importantly, the  
newcomer will know that he or she will be welcomed as-is, regardless of race,  
gender, age, sexual orientation, "hipness," etc.  Choice of shoes and clothing  
is best dictated by comfort and playful expression of style, rather than by a  
requirement to "fit in".  The standard for behavior is nothing more  
complicated than "be nice to people" (and perhaps that alcohol consumption is  
discouraged or prohibited).  With new ravers suitably prepped, the social  
environment at the rave is reinforced by their addition rather than diluted.

These expectations at the outset and the "good vibe" transmitted by so many  
friendly smiles probably account for the surprisingly low reported incidence  
of  harmful psychedelic experiences at raves.  Good psychedelic experiences  
are further supported by the presence of  "chillout rooms" where it's OK to  
rest and be alone or with a comforting friend when one is feeling overwhelmed,  
and by the freedom to dance alone and refocus the mind (perhaps with eyes  
closed) away from troublesome thoughts by merging consciousness with the  
steady rhythm on the dance floor.

As reported by some organizers in San Francisco, raves emerged from  
underground thus:  The "circles of friends" outgrew what most homes or small  
spaces could accommodate.  As raves moved into larger venues, they became more  
time consuming and expensive to produce (rent, security, DJs, sound,  
lighting).  As capital investment increased, it became necessary to recover  
costs through admission and other charges (coat check, bar, concessions, etc.)   
First the alternative press, and later the mainstream media, began covering  
raves.

As interest grew, more producers came onto the scene to meet the demand.  The  
primary intention of many remained simply to provide the highest quality  
experience possible while not losing much money.  Other producers saw an  
opportunity for considerable profit (a medium-large commercial rave attended  
by 3,000 people may gross $60,000 or more, and net well over two-thirds of  
that).

Producers need a critical mass of people at their events for them to be fun  
(to "go off"), to not loose money, or to satisfy income goals.  In the face of  
competition, promotion becomes necessary for success.   Most commonly,  
promotion of upcoming raves is done by distributing colorful handbills (often  
containing psychedelic art and language) at raves, at nightclubs, in cafes,  
record stores, and clothing stores.  Some producers build up address lists for  
direct mail promotion, and for large raves ("massives" or "megaraves", often  
on holidays, e.g. new years eve or fourth of July), advertisements have been  
run in newspapers and on radio.  These promotions often extend far into  
outlying suburbs and neighboring cities, and often reach quite young age  
groups.

A result of wide promotion is that some of the new ravers attending megaraves  
are no longer personally introduced to the scene by an experienced raver.   
Their expectations are perhaps those of the nightclub scene that raves  
superficially resemble, or those engendered by press, TV, and movie depictions  
of so-called "raves".  In any event, unguided newcomers are generally not well  
prepared to be able to relax their socially conditioned defenses and  
contribute positively to "the vibe" described above.   Large numbers of  
unaccustomed people standing on the sidelines diffuse the ecstatic energy of  
those who are participating in the dance ritual.  At worst, use of alcohol or  
other "downer" drugs and the old nightclub behaviors can quench the vibe that  
distinguishes raves from nightclub events.

In "sfraves" electronic mail discussions and in personal interviews, "old  
time" ravers often express diminishing satisfaction with large commercial  
raves.  A movement appears solidly underway to recreate the lost vibe by  
moving the focus back to smaller, non-commercial raves thrown by friends for  
friends.

Still, ravers report that the feelings of a megarave that "goes off"  
successfully are overwhelmingly positive 1 the ecstasy of merging with  
thousands of people, forming a pulsing, vibrant and joyful mass of humanity.


MUSIC AT RAVES AND ITS EFFECTS

Ravers regard music as one of the central, defining elements of raves.  The  
style heard at raves falls under the general label of "House Music" or simply  
"House".  To the uninitiated, House may sound "all the same".  To musically  
aware ravers and to House musicians, however, there is as much diversity in  
House as in Classical music or Jazz.

Evidence of this is the number of subgenres of House recognized, described,  
and debated by House musicians and ravers:  Chicago House, Deep House, Acid  
House, Techno House (further divided into Proto-Techno, Detroit Techno,  
Hardcore Techno, and Techno-Rave), Breakbeat [House], Hip-House, Trance  
[House], Tribal House, Progressive House,  and Ambient [House].  "House" may  
be used to cover all of these categories, or sometimes among the cognoscenti,  
the word is used as an abbreviation for Chicago House (historically the first  
form of House).  Also played at some raves is Acid Jazz, danceable though  
perhaps not strictly speaking House.

What most characterizes House music (in the broad sense) is its relentless  
devotion to an ongoing beat.  Compared with other styles of dance music,  
melody and lyrics in the usual sense are largely absent.   The music is  
predominated by patterns of rhythm and tone, repeating in cycles of 2, 4, 8,  
..., and shifting over time.  In this sense, House music resembles modern  
"Minimalist" classical music, as typified by composers Terry Riley, Steve  
Reich, and Philip Glass.   Unlike Minimalist music, however, House is nearly  
always constrained to 4/4 time, and House often employs synthesized sounds  
that do not mimic acoustic musical instruments.  House, especially Acid,  
Techno, Trance, and Ambient, often incorporates samples of atonal sounds such  
as voice or sound effects.  These samples, themselves repeated rhythmically,  
may be digitally altered to produce novel or "trippy" effects.  Ambient House  
is distinguished from all other forms of House by its subdued or absent beat.   
Soft in nature, it is often played in in "chillout" rooms to guide the  
relaxing raver in wanderings of the mind.

These categories and descriptions are probably less useful than they seem,  
because variations, exceptions, and evolving styles are the rule.   
Nonetheless, this may give the reader a sense for the evolving diversity of  
House.  Note also that there are strong geographic differences among styles of  
House played at raves at any given time.

Most House music is released by small record companies on 12" vinyl records,  
and sold in specialty dance music stores.  A much smaller number of titles are  
released on CDs.   Since about 1992, House has gained sufficiently in  
popularity so that compilations of House tracks by various artists are now  
available in mainstream record stores as well.
 

Much House music is created for the express purpose of facilitating listeners  
and especially dancers in achieving altered states of consciousness.   
Different styles of House create correspondingly different effects on dancers,  
and consequently are an important control variable for the  "energy" and mood  
at a rave.

Rave DJs are evaluated and admired for their knowledge and skill in thus  
manipulating the crowd and facilitating "the vibe."  A DJ will often play two  
records at the same time, with beats carefully kept in synchronization.   
"Beat-mixing" from one record to the next lets the dance rhythm continue  
unbroken.  Respected DJs are sensitive to the state of the dancers, and will  
guide them on a ride through different moods during the event.  To generalize:   
Chicago House, with its uplifting vocal samples and happy piano riffs,  
increases the energy, induces smiles, and promotes social interaction on the  
dance floor.  Techno House, with its still more intensely pounding rhythms,  
rapid tempos, and frequently harsh sounds, drives the dance energy to manic  
levels.  Breakbeat keeps the energy high, while its more complicated rhythms  
induce ravers to move with more complex dance steps.  Trance is a calmer style  
with less differentiated beats, conducive to closed-eye trance dancing,  
sometimes reducing social interaction on the dance floor.  Tribal, borrowing  
from African and other "world music" rhythms, similarly encourages  
inner-directed states of consciousness which many experience as primal.

The styles of House are related to the states of consciousness that some  
ravers explore using psychedelic drugs.  Thus House music is regarded by some  
ravers as drug music.  Many ravers report, however, that they learn from  
psychedelic experiences how to attain beneficial or enjoyable states of  
consciousness by music and dance alone 1 without chemical assistance.

Many ravers note the historical connections of the social mixture of music,  
optionally psychedelics, and dance, to the tribal celebrations found in  
ancient cultures, often spiritual or religious in nature, and to the spiritual  
practices of the Whirling Dervishes.   Some ravers explicitly regard their  
rave experiences as spiritual or religious exercise.

Note on Music Volume

In common with dance music as played at ordinary night clubs, House music at  
raves is often played at high volume.  Ravers report two benefits from  
powerfully loud music.  First, the synthesized bass sounds can be felt on and  
in the body, adding another sensory mode to the rhythmical experience.   
Second, the volume of the music can overwhelm experience such that the raver  
feels lost in the music and can more easily achieve hypnotic or other altered  
states of consciousness.

The clear disadvantage is that the sound is loud enough at some events to  
damage hearing.  This potential is exacerbated when ravers ("speaker  
tweekers") dance directly in front of a loudspeaker stack, and when exposure  
is many hours in duration.

A small but growing minority of ravers are observed wearing earplugs.   A few  
San Francisco rave producers make disposable earplugs available at their  
events at no cost.  And, some 1993 Internet email to "sfraves" has discussed  
volume measurements taken at raves, sound system quality and safety, and has  
provided ordering information for disposable earplugs in quantity at low cost  
(under twenty cents a pair).


OTHER SENSORY COMPONENTS IN THE RAVE ENVIRONMENT

Lighting:  computer controlled "articulate lighting", strobes, blacklights,  
candles in chillout rooms.

Images:  projected from slide, overhead, or movie projectors.   multiple  
sources combined, like House tracks combined by the DJs.

Mark asks what Jungle is:

I'm not exactly sure, but I'll tell you what I know.  Jungle is
a English and US East Coast thing, it's a form of  dance music that,
as well as I can describe from hearing a Jungle DJ from Philly
(Odyssey in case anyone cares) is a sort of melding of hard house
and break beat.  It's fast and energetic, and a bit dark and a bit
tribal.

If you really want the full scoop and a better definition write to
the ne-raves list becuase I know there are two people there (Joe
Le Sense and Damian Higgins) who are really into it and could give
a better definition and can list tracks that are good examples.

Subject: once more on the drug talk
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

I am registering my extreme distress at the amount of open talk
about drugs on this list.  I do not feel comfortable with such
volume of this traffic coming into my accounts.  I do not wish to be 
identified by association with such activities as a result of me being
a member of the sfraves list.  I did not get into raving to do
drugs, and drugs are not why I still rave.  My primary interest
is the music (which rarely ever gets discussed here), followed by the 
friendships I have made as a result of going to parties and hanging 
out with list people.

Email I have received in response to my last letter has been
overwhelmingly in favor of continued detailed drug talk.  But
just because that is what the vocal majority wants it does not
mean I or the very few peole who wrote to me in agreement have to 
like it.  I have no authority over what goes on here, that ultimately 
lies with the person in the Stanford Medical School who graciously 
donated us the use of techno.stanford.edu to run the list on.  I am 
merely stating my level of distress and discomfort.

I know my options are to either stay on the list and ride it out
or get off the list, so you don't need to write me to tell me so.
I'll keep my nose out of this issue now that I've said my piece.

People: Time for a software solution, not a people solution - if you want
   to filter out email, it's pretty easy on most systems - just run a stupid
   filter which grep's for the words "drug" "cybin" etc. and autokills the
   mail.  They work great, and preserves freedom of speech for the rest of us.

Here's how to order: (Unix only, sorry- other ways on PCs and Macs, I'm sure)
1. make sure the program "slocal" is available - it's part of "mh", so take
   the man pages on mh ("man mh") and if it shows up, then it's installed.
2. create a file in your home directory called ".maildelivery"  In it, put
   stuff like:
---cut here---

# deletes all incoming mail with this subject
Subject "useless mail subject"	destroy	A	-

# deletes all mail with the word "drug" anywhere in it
*       drug    destroy  A  -

# deletes all mail from dickhead@cs.berkeley.edu
From    dickhead@cs.berkeley.edu    destroy A -

# you can match against any mail header field, like:
# To
# Subject
# Sender
# X-      <--- really useful for MIME and other wacky mail foo

# at the end put in this line, but replace /var/spool... with your mail
#   file.  To find it, run "env | grep MAIL".
default		-		>	A	/var/spool/mail/asah

---cut here---

3. create a ".forward" file, also in your home directory, with:
---cut here---
| /usr/lib/mh/slocal -user asah

---cut here---

You'll want to change that /usr/lib/mh/slocal path to the one on your
   system for running slocal.  Do a "which slocal" to find it.  Also,
   you'll want to change the -user flag, right...

Enjoy,
adam

ps. if you do this, experiment first... fooling around with email without
   testing your changes leads to lost mail and other hassles...
pps. there's a lot more cool stuff to slocal but mostly useful if you're 
   mh to read mail.
ppps. there are other ways to do this, but slocal is one of the best.
   Also, slocal and mh probably port to the PC and to the Mac... check out
   the ftp site world.std.com:/src/mail/mh-6.8.3  or run "archie mh" to
   find others, if archie's installed locally.

        Just to add my two pennies:

	No one is saying here that drugs aren't a part of the scene;
in fact they are a somewhat important part.  The topic itself is
fairly relevant, which is why I have a whole directory dedicated to
it on the archive site. 

	However, "the devil is in the details" - I've had it stated in
no unclear terms that if the list were ever portrayed as being
drug-focused or encouraging illegal actions, the graces of the Medical
School Informations and Systems Group at Stanford could be in
jeorpardy.  Stanford has seen at least one professor get into very hot
water because of their position on psychedelics, so the issue is a
little sensitive with them.  I can justify the archive section by
calling it a public service, since the majority of the information
there is on a self-help basis.  But posts over the mailing list
carry a heavier weight, and people advocating the use of a particular
dosage level can be potentially troublesome, perhaps even to the point 
of yanking us off the system.

	I should make clear one thing: 50% of the posts I saw I
considered perfectly acceptable.  They advocated caution, didn't
admit to personal use (these posts are archived, remember) and
referred people to better sources on the subject.  This should
be the model to follow.

	As soon as I get a home machine plugged into the net
(hopefully around this summer) with a good-sized pipe, I'll be moving
most of the sensitive stuff to that machine, and then we won't have to
worry about things like this.  But for now we exist through some
extraordinarily good graces, so let's not abuse it.  The nitrous
thread a while ago almost killed us, so I wouldn't be doing my job if
I wasn't trying to prevent a repeat of that.

	Thanks.

	Brian

p.s. - I might actually make it out this weekend!

Well, the legendary Whoopy Ball rave was on March 6th, 1992, and the sfraves 
list started up shortly before that event.

That means that sfraves is a Pisces.

Not to be negative and argumentative (yeah, right), but I think your
opinions about drug use are a load of crap.  You shouldn't try to diagnose
and prescribe drugs to people you've never met in 5 paragraphs of sweeping
generalizations.

The book I think you're refering to is "A Scanner Darkly", which is PKD's
anti-drug book that he dedicated to several of his friends who he lost to
drugs.  The main characters in Dick's stories are often based on real people
from his life.  This main character is a drug dealer who sells "Substance D"
to his friends and housemates, and also works part time as a narc.  ("D"
stands for "Death".)  Things start getting weird when he's assigned to keep
an eye on himself (this is possible because the police department is so
infilterated that the narcs' identities must be protected by some interesting
technology that I won't go into. You'll have to read the book to find out
who's really behind the manufacture and distribution of Substance D).
This is definitly one of Dick's more psychotic stories, not his best, but
really up there.  (I had a hard time finding that book, but I was finally 
lucky enough to run across a first edition hardback copy that came from
a U.S. Air Force base library in Florida!)

        -Don the Dick Head

PS: I'm putting together an online World Wide Web hypermedia database and 
conspiracy graph of the works of Philip K Dick, so I would really appreciate
contributions of any interesting materials or immaterials about Philip K Dick!

PPS: Just like using certain drugs, some people just shouldn't read Philip K
Dick, since he can be MUCH more powerful than mere drugs.  But there's no way
to know if Dick is right for you, without trying it first.

I hate to be a killjoy but it sort of gives me the creeps
or something to see such an extended open discussion of
drug use.  Sort of discounts any statements that raving
is about fellowship and the music and not only about drugs.
------------------------------------------------------------

Feels a little uneasy yes, but think of it as if were were discussing
homosexuality or something.  Why should we hide in the closet?  This
discussion is probably helping a few people.  As long as everyone talks
about personal experiences on the USER level, no big deal.  Just one of
the many related topics to raving.  We talk about music and other topics
all the time anyway.

It's too bad if Stanford is sensitive about what boils down to a free

site to run SFraves temporarily, drop me a note.

Excuse my ignorance, but what does seratonin have to do with visiting the
repository of the fairies?
TMS
----------------------------------
Because the aliens that have just abducted you manipulate your seratonin
and other brain chemicals to make you think you are in the realm of the
fairies while you are being examined.  Or because crazy people who see
fairies have brain chemical imbalances, including seratonin.  Take your
pick or make up a new one.  What doesn't it have to do with it?

Hello my name is Andy, ive been lurking around this list for the past 
couple of months, and this is my first post.  Just to let you all 
know, there's been quite a cool little underground scene going on in
Santa Cruz for the past couple of years.  Since I am using this list 
now i'll keep you all up to date on the happenings in SC.

On friday april the 8th, were going to have an underground called 
vivid.  So far we have confirmed:  Wool, Ethan, James(SC), and Dj Drew
(that's me, :)  Were working on Scottie(MESS), and Spun.  We've arranged
for a beautiful, unused location in the hills of SC.

This party is in memory of Gabriel Ceasar, who was killed at a party 
in Santa Cruz one year ago.  

vivid will be only $5 with your canned food donation.  If profit
is made a portion will go to the Santa Cruz homeless shelters.

Hope to see you all there!  We'll keep you posted on any updates. 

Peace,


Andy

Hey there,

I and a group of friends were thinking of making the trip from L.A. to San
Fransisco.  Hopefully be in town the night of April 8 (Fri) and leave Sunday
night.  Anyone have an idea of events that weekend?  I tried to get hooked up to
the calendar but with no luck... any help would be appreciated...

Thanks,

   But the music was unable to save the British rave scene, which collapsed  
under its own weight.  It had simply gotten too big, too commercial, too  
mainstream, therefore too un-hip, to keep the core ravers interested.  At its  
height, circa 1989, there were thousands of ravers, partying in the crop  
circles at 4 a.m., drinking juices and dosing up on XTC in London.  Three  
years later, it was over.
   Governmental pressure, says one ex-British raver, also contributed to the  
demise of the English rave scene.  The ravers, it seems, didn't fit in.  If  
they were outside in a field somewhere dosed up on smart drinks, they weren't  
hanging out at the corner pub, hoisting a pint of ale.  They were outsiders  
who were perceived as threatening.  According to 30-year-old Jas. Morgan, the  
music and arts editor of the cyberpunk bible _Mondo_2000_, the rave scene  
"caused economic grief with established organizations."  Enforcing a law that  
forbade large gatherings, Morgan says, "The British government acquired a  
helicopter expressly for the purpose of flying around and looking down on  
these illegal raves, and finally they succeeded in snuffing out the scene in  
Britain."
   Undaunted, the primary rave-scene movers, the organizers of the parties,  
began looking for other suitable climates to recapture the original spirit.   
They looked at San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles.  They chose The City --  
which, considering San Francisco's legendary hospitality to exiles,  
visionaries and serious partyers, should surprise no one.
   [...]
   In a peculiar mini-reprise of the British pop invasion of the early '60s,  
the English ravers hit The City in the winter of 1991.

Oh how I love the media and how it can sometimes state things as if they
were the facts.  Here's my $0.02

>At its

>years later, it was over.

It's height was much more at the end of '91 I would say when I remember the
parties getting waaay massive, very crowded, lots of really young kids
suddenly turning up in brand new clothes, the music suddenly getting
commercial (Smart E's, etc.) and the organizers & DJs picking up (after
they made lots of money) and taking off for places like SF.

I hate the dead/not dead argument but the scene is hardly "over" in
Britain.  Just because a scene goes underground does NOT make it "over."  I
was recently there and let me tell you that there are some wicked parties
happening that are better than ever before.  They're just not in the
public's eye like they used to be.  Most people retreated to new clubs that
were created and many others began to embody the spirit of "Do it Yourself"
and organize their own parties. If you ask me, going underground has been a
good thing.  Looks like that what's starting to happen here too.

>"The British government acquired a
>helicopter expressly for the purpose of flying around and looking down on

Haha!  I remember being at a 3 day party on top of a huge hill in Lewes
(Sussex) in the summer of last year and on the second day, the cops made
their appearance with a helicoptor hovering overhead but they couldn't do
anything since the party was held on private property and we weren't
disturbing anyone  :)

for me - I've got an old army blanket that I can use .

Yes, there is one that I have that one of the tracks was recorded live at
the Warfield in 1992. I went to that concert so I bought it as a memento.
All the other tracks include Terrence and were recorded at various places.
I think it was a limited release as mine has a number on it. No idea of
how many copies were made. You might try Tower Records. They could order
it for you if it's available. The info follows:

The Shamen with Terrence McKenna * RE: Evolution       118TP7CD

The other CD was a companion to a video produced by Rose X Media House for 
City of Tribes Communications here in the City and is available through:

We got to Bonny Doon in record time, 1hr 15min from SF, parking at 4:15am.
By the number of cars, it was obvious that this was big, the biggest FMM 
ever.  I scoped out the scene as we descended into the frenzy and by 
comparison to the now famous Halloween Full Moon Massive, I estimated a 
crowd size of at least 3,000.  

Garth was on as we set up camp and linked up with various friends and
friends of friends.  The Normals and Gil showed up with their tent and 
joined our contingent.  We also ran into Ovid, Seth, Geoff, Ravi, Scott
(Cloud Factory), Cap'n Crunch, and a few others who I'll probably remember
immediately after posting this.  As is typical of weekend FMM's, there was
a certain amount of people blowing hollaring, being drunk, shooting off 
fireworks, etc.  There seemed to be a lot less nitrous present, though.  
Janie & I just relaxed during this period, and things settled down into a 
pretty cohesive vibe just before dawn arrived.  Initially, I thought 
there was something wrong with the sound system cause there were so many
people crowding around the speakers that the sound was almost completely 
muffled.  This situation improved by the time Markie took the helm, 
somewhere around 6.   

I'm still struggling to find the words to describe Markie's set, which was
at least 4 hours long.  I've been a Markie admirer for a long time, and 
this was the best set I've *ever* heard him spin; acidic, trancy, funky - a 
totally incredible musical journey.  He never faltered and you could sense
his focus, like a wizard mesmerized by his own spell, yet still in command 
of it.  Around 9, the generator died for about 45 minutes, after which he 
came back to pick things up right where he left off.

This party pretty much proved to me that the scene still has a lot of
momentum in it.  There were a lot of new (to me, anyway) faces there, but
just about everyone seemed to know exactly what it was all about.  I wonder 
how many there were brought there by the April Rolling Stone article that
has now lifted the FMM  parties into official cult status.  There were 
certainly a few tourists in attendance, but I don't think that this 
detracted from things at all. 

By the time the generator came back on, the few hundred of us who remained 
were totally under the spell of things.  At this  point, I felt like I 
really was part of some of a quasi-religious cult: The shamen-DJs in 
conjunction with nature's energy and the altered states of consciousness of
the participants created a religious atmosphere - its vague dogma loosely
defined by the unspoken sharing of feelings and sensations.  It is 
fascinating to me how there can be so much understanding without words, 
where the experience that is taking place at that moment says it all.  
Bonnie Doon beach, surrounded by cliffs and the ocean provides a very 
spiritual setting for a rave.  But I have to wonder how much longer these 
parties are going to be allowed to continue there, now that the're getting 
so much attention.

When Jeno came on, the music jumped to an even higher energy level.  The
type of stuff he played in this a set is hard to describe.  It's kind of 
hardcore, but not in the high bpm or stripped down head pounding way.  The 
music is incredibly thick and tribal, an all out manic assault of 
multilayered sound timbres, music so rhythmic and intense that going along 
with it either requires that you already be tripping, or it makes you trip 
just as you allow your psyche to be absorbed by it.  I was pretty much 
blown away during this period, with my occasional attempts to rest 
consistantly curtailed by music that demanded my soul's participation.  I 
was able to come back into my surface-self when Jeno's set ended and Thomas 
came on with some horribly cheesy disco, as if to tell us, "I'm not Jeno 
so don't even expect anything like that from me."  Don't worry Thomas, I 
don't think we will ever get you two confused.

Thankfully, Thomas ceased torturing us, eventually veering off into some 
pleasantly funky grooves.  But we were totally spent and had already had
too much sun.  So at arounf 1:30 we packed things up, making sure to take 
our garbage with us.  I was bummed about forgetting to bring garbage bags 
to help with the overall cleanup - something I normally do at free outdoor 
parties.  Oh, well.  This party was a particularly messy one.

Back by the road there was an army of towtrucks and CHPs doing their
thing.  What a bummer it must of been for those who left the party
completely drained and still buzzing only to find their vehicle missing. 
I'm not even sure if there's a payphone within walking distance.

Although it is true that raving in the SF Bay area has to some extent lost 
the sense of excitement that comes with anything new and "on the edge", it 
is parties like the Full Moon Massive that will keep the scene alive here.  
Why?  Well, while most indoor raves now seem to be basically a very nice 
variation of the club scene,  FMMs remind us that the roots of raving are 
really intertwined with ageless tribal rituals of music, dance, trance, and 
the partaking of mind expanding sacraments, where reaching a oneness with 
our inner nature links us to a oneness with the forces of nature around us 
and in each other.  You don't have to watch many National Geographics to 
see the obvious similarities between parties such as these and the religious 
ceremonies of more "primitive" cultures.  Ritualistic raving will remain 
viable because it appeals to the sense of spirit in us that has been viable 
since the dawn of human consciousness.  I think the Wicked people who put 
on the FMMs understand this; that the scene is about much more than making 
money by helping people have fun.  It's about what it means to be alive in 
a way that goes beyond the artificial limits imposed by modern society.  On 
Sunday we were a tribe of the Universe, of the basic essence of life and 
energy, body and mind.  And in addition to all that, it was a fucking blast.

Around midnight Saturday night a group of us met up with Ethan,
Bryce, and the pirate radio broadcaster for an evening of dancing
while broadcasting.  Unfortunately wind conditions prevented set-up
of the gear, so we headed to 24th street.

Rather than having to rent a van to haul the huge *SoundVision* system,
Johnny Turpin leant his speakers, and the whole set-up fit nicely
into the back of Ethan's jeep/vehicle.  

We got going around 1.30, and Lee An provided an interesting set 
ranging from that kind of house that includes divas singing up to
techno trance.  The highlight for me was when he played Fuse's
"Substance Abuse" which had me jumping and moving and sliding around
like my mind was connected to Richie Hawtin's LFO's.  I want that 
record :-).

I got to spin for a little while, and then Ethan had a turn.  Ethan
is really doing well, he puts together a totally different set every
time I hear him.  I really respect that in a DJ.  The high point of his
set was when he played some things off of the Orbital Peel Sessions.
Most of us were tired and had stopped dancing but when he got to that
track we all got an energy surge and then ended the evening on that
pleasant high note.

We packed up a bit after 4am, having enjoyed ourselves greatly.  A lot
of people have been saying that this Spring/Summer will be a good one.
Well, Ethan/Bryce/SoundVision/Liquid Air will be right in there
putting out good low-key parties all season long, if Saturday night's
brief but beautiful gathering is any indication.

Thanks guys, you made my Saturday!  I really needed it after eating
so much at Susie's mom's seder!

Full Moon Madness in a MAJOR way
            By
       John T. Draper
        Cap'n Crunch
        
   Well,  after checking the location for "Generation" and learning that
the venue was 16th and Harrison (Goon city),   I decided at that point
to gear up and make plans for the Full Moon Rave (FMR) to take place
later that evening.   WOW!! A Full mooner on a Saturday night, Killer!.

   Already,  my phone was ringing off the hook as gobs of SFRavers, friends
and others were calling me for the location.   It was 10:30 PM at this point,
and I also called a few others to see if they got the location.    There
were several rumours floating around about the location being at Pt Reyes
but later on,  we dismissed it as rumours.

   The evening promised to be beautiful,   it was very clear,  although cool,
so rain wasn't going to be a problem.

   Amit,  one of my SFRaver freinds called me first to give out the location
which was near Bonny Doon.    Yukk!! we were hoping it would be north this time.

   Aaron and Matt had decided to abandon the idea of going because it was just
too far,  and Aaron had to work,  and Matt wanted to work on his house boat,
so I wound up going alone.   I called up Amit and agreed to meet at his place
in Mt View,  and we went together.   I arrive at Amit's place by 2:30 am,  and
we promptly leave for Santa Cruz.

   As we arrived at the site,  we see an endless line of cars estimated to be
about 3 miles long parked on the side of Hiway 1.    We parked and started the
2 mile hike,  looking for Panther beach (the allegid location).    As we were
waling along the Hiway,  we noticed people heading towards Bonny Doon and NOT
to Panther beach as was origionally planned and followed the crowd.    It
was reported that Panther Beach was just too small,  and with the tide coming
in,  we would have had LESS room,  so apparently it got moved up the road a
few miles.

   As we arrived,  we were stunned at how many people were already there,  and
so many campfires,  tents,  and other amenities.    The DJ stand was placed
against the cliffs this time,  aimed slightly out towards the ocean,  thus
made for a spacey echoing effect as the sounds bounced off the steep cliffs.
The music had started as we arrived (approx 3:15 am),  but the music wasn't
that loud (At least not from up on the cliffs).   As we approached,   the
huge crowds became more evident as we made our way near the speakers,  and
explained the reason why we couldn't hear the music that well.

   The crowd was densly packed near the two speakers,   and had problems finding
a clear dancing spot.   But the music was incredable.    I actually heard some
new stuff,  cleverly put together by Markie Mark as I heard one of his best sets
ever.     

   My knee,  now almost totally healed,  allowed me to dance continiously from
3 am to 3 pm,  resting only a few times.    This was the first time that everything
in my body is totally healed,  and not even my cronic back problem came
into my conciousness.   My brain was in a very high state of "tweakeyness",  and
got so totally absorbed in the music,  inventing new dance movements I never
tried before,  although quite sucessfully.   I was getting off in a major way,
under the cloudy skies,  so never actually saw the moon (Except while going 
over the mountains on the way to the beach).   The moon was far from my mind
it it's altered state,  as the music was my heartbeat and source for energy
that never stopped until the generator died around 9 am.    It turned out
that everyone was so absorbed by the parying that nobody even thought that
the generator needed gas.    Once it stopped,   at first everything was in
total stillness.    There was little talking,  and people were very dazed out.
There was little or no interactions going on,  people just stood and stared around
wondering if it got busted.  

   I wandered near the generator to see what had happened and learned that
some bozo put water in the tank instead of gasoline.  Ooops!!   so for about
45 minutes as some mechanical types volunteered to flush out the water,  others
went out for more gasoline,  and eventually the generator choked back to life.

   Markie was still on at that time,   but cued up a really slow trancey song
with NO BEAT to gradually get the crowd used to the fact that the DJ'ing was
to start soon.    By this time,   I would estimate about a third of the crowd
had left.   Eventually Markie's song transmuted into the familiar boom boom beats
and I was right there.   Actually,  I had already started dancing (even to the
trancey stuff,  experimenting with a slow thai chi type dance movements,  getting
my body warmed up again).   When the first beats started pumping out,  I was
ready and raring to go.

   My estimation is about 2500 crazy raver folks out there "getting down" to the
serious business of raving and partying.    After the 45 minute generator problem,
I had NO PROBLEM finding a killer spot near the speakers and I don't think I
stopped dancing until about noon.    After Markie,  Jeno spun and incredible
set.   I don't think I stopped dancing (Except for an ocassional stretch) all
throughout his very long 2 hour set.   Jeno took me on one of the tranciest
rides I've been on for a very long time,  yet his sets had a pretty good amount
of variaty.   Best I heard from Markie and Jeno for a very long time,  and both
played a lot of new stuff.

   By about 1 pm I was getting stronger and stronger,  my body wasn't complaining
at all.     But with me,   I always seem to get into better and stronger dance
style towards the end.    It was also nice not to have to stop at 7 am (At end
of indoor rave) and go to some "Afterparty".    It was a very good continious
12 hours of non-stop dancing,  the kind that I prefer,  although last summer,
when at LoveStock,   it was 24 hours of continious dancing ( I kike THAT much
better).

   Thomas took to the turntables after Jeno,   and his start was kinda slow,  and
Disco like,  so I took the opportunity for my first good stretch break since about
6 am.    After that, schmoosed a while with friends,  and by that time,  Thomas
was into some pretty good stuff,   so I headed out there till the very last note.
Sometime during his set,  he made an announcement that cars were getting towed
away,  so I go look for Amit to make sure he checkes his car.

   I danced Thomas's set to the very end,  when he put on this very slow tune,
and I stopped my highly energetic style,  slowed down to some great stretchey
moves to iron out a few kinks.    Thomas's last tune (Kinda housey) gave me
another spurt of energy to round out one of the best Full Mooner's I've been
to in a long time.   And I was begiining to think the scene has died,   Boy!!
Was I Wrong!   The SF Scene here is even richer than ever....   And I get rumours
that BOOGIE BUFFET is coming back!!   This upcomong Thursday,  the Sisters will
be back again... Oh!!  Goodie,  I can hardly wait....  I sure miss them...

Cheers
Keep the scene alive

Just to balance out the long and beautiful posts by Lee and the Cap'n, 
here are some of my negative observations of this weekend's FMM:

Music: As a whole, I'd have to say I was pretty disappointed.  Every time 
I heard a song that I liked, I would get up and dance, only to be sent 
back to the blanket two songs later with another boring 
BOOM-CHIC-BOOM-CHIC, 1-2-3-4 boring house track.  Now don't get me wrong, 
I can get into house, but if I'm going to really trance out, I need 
acid.  This DOESN'T mean 303's necessarily; in fact, acid can 
mean almost anything, whether it's a crazy freaked out funky beat, a 
bubbling synth, or a tweaky sample.  There just has to be something in 
the music that gives my mind a challenge.  Most of the music at the FMM made 
me feel like my intelligence was being insulted.  There were too many 
breaks designed purely to make hundreds of people on E scream and whistle 
and go crazy.  A really good break SHOULD make you scream and go crazy, 
but it shouldn't require "enhancement" for its effects.  To me, a bad 
house song is like a bad movie; if you know exactly what's going to 
happen at every stage, it isn't enjoyable.

I agree that Markie was the main attraction (although I think I fell 
asleep during Jeno's set).  I was extremely impressed with his technical 
ability, always twiddling knobs, bouncing things from left to right.  The 
music was a bit choppy, although there were definitely brilliant tracks 
scattered throughout.  I was very pleasantly surprised to hear about 8 
minutes of  Plastikman's (Richie Hawtin) Electrostatik, an extremely 
minimal, but very trance-inducing acid track.  I was thinking about 
JSL's posts about Markie being the king of "trip-hop", but after 
hearing him, I'd have to say that the term seems much more 
appropriate in describing a DJ like Spun.  What do other's think? Overall, 
Markie's set was very enjoyable, but unfortunately, it often lapsed into the 
1-2-3-4 
house beats that I just can't get into.  Oh well, I guess this is what the San 
Francisco scene is known for, right?    

Well, those are really my only gripes.  I still had a good time, 
expecially since it was my first visit to Bonny Doon.  It was amazing to 
sit at the top of the hill and watch the movement patterns of thousands 
of people dancing, walking, congregating and hovering around fires.  From 
a distance, they all look like one unit, oozing around like that "Life" 
computer simulation (the one with all the little dots interacting).  

On the way home, at around 3, I realized that my face been slowly 
sizzling, and is now an uncomfortable shade of red.  I made it back just 
in time for my radio show, and I MEAN just in time.  After getting 
dropped off in front of Ameba, I ran to the Muni stop, transferred to 
Bart, ran home to pick up a few records and my headphones, and biked up 
to the station, arriving at 6:24, one night behind on sleep, for my show at 
6:30.  Phew!!

A few minutes later, I found out that KALX dj Minor had arranged to bring 
Mixmaster Morris in to do a guest set.  What perfect timing!  He arrived 
just before 8pm, and took over for the rest of the show with a sick 
blend of soft tweaky acid and ambient.  I kind of expected more from the 
non-techno realm (obscure classical and new-age, maybe), but he still 
managed to pull off a great hour-long set, with a little mini-interview 
in between.  

After the show, we took Morris down the street to Rasputin's, where he 
went utterly MAD (say with British accent), flipping through racks and 
racks of records and CD's at lighting speed,  from practically every 
section in the store.  The weird thing was, he could see every single 
record that flipped by, pulling things out all over the place to add to his 
stack.  As closing time neared, he was forced to weed down his collection to 
just two bags full (ouch!).  It was a hectic, though quite fun, 
experience :) 

I didn't make it to Ambience, since I am not 21, but I haven't seen 
any reviews yet.  What did people think?

my weekend in a nutshell...

Just to balance out the long and beautiful posts by Lee and the Cap'n, 
here are some of my negative observations of this weekend's FMM:

Music: As a whole, I'd have to say I was pretty disappointed.  Every time 
I heard a song that I liked, I would get up and dance, only to be sent 
back to the blanket two songs later with another boring 
BOOM-CHIC-BOOM-CHIC, 1-2-3-4 boring house track.  Now don't get me wrong, 
I can get into house, but if I'm going to really trance out, I need 
acid.  This DOESN'T mean 303's necessarily; in fact, acid can 
mean almost anything, whether it's a crazy freaked out funky beat, a 
bubbling synth, or a tweaky sample.  There just has to be something in 
the music that gives my mind a challenge.  Most of the music at the FMM made 
me feel like my intelligence was being insulted.  There were too many 
breaks designed purely to make hundreds of people on E scream and whistle 
and go crazy.  A really good break SHOULD make you scream and go crazy, 
but it shouldn't require "enhancement" for its effects.  To me, a bad 
house song is like a bad movie; if you know exactly what's going to 
happen at every stage, it isn't enjoyable.

I agree that Markie was the main attraction (although I think I fell 
asleep during Jeno's set).  I was extremely impressed with his technical 
ability, always twiddling knobs, bouncing things from left to right.  The 
music was a bit choppy, although there were definitely brilliant tracks 
scattered throughout.  I was very pleasantly surprised to hear about 8 
minutes of  Plastikman's (Richie Hawtin) Electrostatik, an extremely 
minimal, but very trance-inducing acid track.  I was thinking about 
JSL's posts about Markie being the king of "trip-hop", but after 
hearing him, I'd have to say that the term seems much more 
appropriate in describing a DJ like Spun.  What do other's think? Overall, 
Markie's set was very enjoyable, but unfortunately, it often lapsed into the 
1-2-3-4 
house beats that I just can't get into.  Oh well, I guess this is what the San 
Francisco scene is known for, right?    

Well, those are really my only gripes.  I still had a good time, 
expecially since it was my first visit to Bonny Doon.  It was amazing to 
sit at the top of the hill and watch the movement patterns of thousands 
of people dancing, walking, congregating and hovering around fires.  From 
a distance, they all look like one unit, oozing around like that "Life" 
computer simulation (the one with all the little dots interacting).  

On the way home, at around 3, I realized that my face been slowly 
sizzling, and is now an uncomfortable shade of red.  I made it back just 
in time for my radio show, and I MEAN just in time.  After getting 
dropped off in front of Ameba, I ran to the Muni stop, transferred to 
Bart, ran home to pick up a few records and my headphones, and biked up 
to the station, arriving at 6:24, one night behind on sleep, for my show at 
6:30.  Phew!!

A few minutes later, I found out that KALX dj Minor had arranged to bring 
Mixmaster Morris in to do a guest set.  What perfect timing!  He arrived 
just before 8pm, and took over for the rest of the show with a sick 
blend of soft tweaky acid and ambient.  I kind of expected more from the 
non-techno realm (obscure classical and new-age, maybe), but he still 
managed to pull off a great hour-long set, with a little mini-interview 
in between.  

After the show, we took Morris down the street to Rasputin's, where he 
went utterly MAD (say with British accent), flipping through racks and 
racks of records and CD's at lighting speed,  from practically every 
section in the store.  The weird thing was, he could see every single 
record that flipped by, pulling things out all over the place to add to his 
stack.  As closing time neared, he was forced to weed down his collection to 
just two bags full (ouch!).  It was a hectic, though quite fun, 
experience :) 

I didn't make it to Ambience, since I am not 21, but I haven't seen 
any reviews yet.  What did people think?

my weekend in a nutshell...

Personally, his voice really gets on my nerves.  Way too nasal.  Buy the

Well, I think the moon was still in the 7th House last night or something
because the 8th House, while a good idea, suffered in its execution.

I was told it started at 9 so I said I'd be there at around 8.30 to
check out the mixer and so Brian could set up his DAT tape.  I arrived
with Brian, Tamara, Bryan, Dana, and Andy, only to find that nothing was 
even remotely ready to go.  The manager of the club didn't arrive until 7.15
to let the 8th House crew in to decorate and set up, so they were very
behind schedule.

The place was decorated nicely, with very odd giant-sized dayglo mystical
3-d symbols hanging over the dance floor, and large posters with the
name of the DJ by the booths so you'd know who was spinning when.
There were lots of small candles around, too.  However, a club is a club
and to me you just can't decorate away the looming fact of multiple huge
bars and signs put up by the management that say things like "New dress
code -- no hats, no t-shirts" which we blatantly ignored anyway.

The club was the Oasis down at 11th and Folsom.  They set up the ambient
DJs in the Egyptian lounge room and the trance DJs on the main floor.
The first ambient DJ was K.S.P. and his idea of ambient included hours
of grating discordant noises and sounds that reminded us of cows being
slaughtered.  It was not pretty.  Mind-crunching ambient in doses at
the right times is great, but it went on and on and on and on and on . . .
Mixmaster Morris arrived much later (around midnight), but I missed
him because I was on in the main room.

Ahh, the main room.  What a complete waste of stereo equipment.  The
volume wasn't loud enough (if you are in the booth with the monitor on
and you can still hear people down on the floor talking it is clearly
not loud enough), the bass was all distorted, there was no mid-range, and
all the trebel seemed to be in the bar area.  People came into the booth
all night asking us to turn it up or fix it but we couldn't because the
owner had the keys to the case where the main amps were and he spent 
much of the night in his office or on the phone basically ignoring us.
I was dying for Ethan and Bryce to swoop down and magically fix things,
but of course they couldn't because it wasn't their stuff (and Ethan
wasn't there, but it's a good thing he wasn't or he would have cried
over the sound).

Things finally got started a bit before 11 (this was supposed to open at 9),
and Sir Sensual came on in the main room.  He had the nicest most joyous
trancey records, and he also brought along a small Prophet synth that he
programmed and ran patterns and played over some of his records.  No one
wanted to take over from him because the sound was so bad, but at midnight
I went up and had my turn.  During my set Mixmaster Morris's manager Russell
came up to say  hi and thank me for playing "Gravitational Arch of 10" which
is one of his favorite tracks, and he also asked me if I could do anything
about the sound.  Just as I said "no, I can't, and it totally sucks" the
club's alleged sound guy FINALLY arrived.  He was rather pissed at my
outspoken evaluation, but it was true.  He said "What do you mean this
sucks?  This is my gear and it's fine."  Well, he must be deaf from too
many years of Metallica or Danzig at high volumes, because it really was
bad.  He then proceded to get in my way and fiddle with the mixer and stuff
trying to fix things.  At last he got the heck out and I continued on for 
a total of 45 minutes.  

I turned the tables over to D.M.A. who had some beautiful records but seemed 
so annoyed with the sound man and the bad sound (even after the sound guy 
supposedly adjusted things) that he didn't bother to even try to mix properly.  
Jonah was sitting up there in the booth with us going "This totally sucks, why 
are we even here?  What is the point of playing if it is going to sound so 
bad."  Russell later introduced me to Morris saying "poor girl, she did a good 
job of fighting it out with the sound system in the other room."  

The absolute worst happened during D.M.A.'s set:  the sound guy claimed the
bad sounds were the problem of the cartridge and stylus on the turntables.  He 
replaced one table's standard Techniques set-up with an Ortofon, but guess 
what, it didn't help the fact that the rest of the system was EQ-d wrong!  Even 
worse, he removed the other table's headshell and WALKED OFF WITH IT.  So when 
D.M.A.'s record ran out he was screwed!  The music stoped for a second and 
D.M.A. just let the next track on the record play because there was nothing to 
mix to.  

Well, I've bitched enough, you get the picture.  Bad sound kills a party
before it can even begin.  Good sound is even more important than stellar
DJs and good drugs.  Without good sound a party is NOTHING.  Philip,
the 8th House organizer, asked me if I'd come back and spin again in
two weeks, and I said I would but only if they fixed the sound system.
So we'll see.

So anyway, while the trance DJs were fighting with the sound in the main 
room, Morris had to contend with the "Hyper*Sentient" dancers in the
ambient lounge.  Apparently they did this 5 minute or so "interpretive
dance" that involved body paint, grimacing, and dancing in and around
large cardboard boxes.  Brian can give a much more detailed description.
He says that Morris looked out at them at one point with a "what the HECK?"
expression on his face :-).

The crowd there was interesting:  a good number of net-ravers and friends
of net-ravers (it seems that if you have a sfraves DJ at a small party
it guarantees that at least a dozen net-people will show up, plus assorted
non-net friends) plus confused people who used to come to the Oasis when
it was the Temple of Psychik Youth night (or whatever).  What was very
interesting is that the music did reach both the TOPY group and the 
raver group.  It was good to look down and see guys in black with 
leather, studs, chains, and interesting alchemical signs getting as
deeply into the music as longtime ravers like Brian Sassonne and Marlo.
The support from the sfravers was great to have!  Thanks for coming!  
I think that if only the sound system had been halfway decent more people
would have been drawn into the trance web we were attempting to weave.

I left about 1.30 in the morning, and Morris was still spinning.  According
to Philip the party was to end at 2am.  Overall I'd say that The 8th House
was a very GOOD idea and that Philip and his group did a good a job as
they could putting it on.  The sound system, the setting, and it being
Monday night dampened things a lot.  If the sound system gets cleaned up
(doubtful) or if Philip finds another location it could be something REALLY
neat:  an intense 10-2 dose of trance to start your week off great.

See you,

Laura

Hear hear. I went to about 15 parties before I went to one with
_really_ good sound. WELCOME TO THE NEXT LEVEL. It makes a huge
difference.

It must doubly suck to be a DJ and have these new records that are so
fucking good you can't even _tell_ people how good they are, and to
want to share them so badly, and when the moment arrives the sound
system SUCKS and what the crowd hears isn't the THING that tweaked you
into the next dimension, but an earthquake.

It makes one really appreciate the sound people who work hard and get
it right.

Although I have yet to read the Rolling Stone article, I have just found out who the author is.  She is not a newbie by any means, in fact, she has probably 
been to raves longer than a huge percent of you on this list.  She wrote a
great article about three years ago on the LA scene in LA Weekly (she is the
music editor of that paper).


Anyway, I will comment further once I have read it. :)

After missing Ambience on saturday, it took much pleading from my sleep 
depraved body to convince me not to go to the 8th house.  I guess I made 
the right decision, eh?  Must have been that psychick energy from TOPY 
that steered me in the right direction  :)

Morris is not leaving until friday, and he mentioned some "underground" 
ambient parties happening before he leaves.  Anyone know more?

I just had the opportunity to read over brian's Welcome to SFRaves file.
In it he says that sfraves had been "up and running since February".
So back to the classic question: when has the baby actually come to life?

I'm looking for some dope on two Spun sets; his Come/Unity tape
set (which boccibob sold a few of) and his recent KZSU 24 hr. house 
marathon set.  Both tweek my head.  I guess I'm just a sucker
for the funk...

1) Better copies, on DAT if possible.  I've worn out those crummy normal-
bias Come/Unity tapes, and KZSU doesn't come in too well at my house, 
so I'm gradually losing the music over time.

2) Any track IDs so even if I can't mix I can at least listen to the
t00nz again.

I'll sell my soul for DATs of both or complete set lists and a store
that stocks them.  No, seriously.  Can anyone help me?  The KZSU set
is more consistently brilliant, but the C/U set has some excellent
peaks too.

Speaking of which, add Jeno's C/U tape set to the list.  The back side
is the _most intense_ 30 minutes of hardcore funkotronics I have ever
heard in my life.  More drop-ins than a free house party, and that man
knows his music, 'cause the transitions are perfect.  That and Spun's
KZSU set deserve to go on my mythical Best Rave Sets Ever compilation,
in with Ethan's New Year's set at the Resort.

"Something different" was the general consensus on what people were expecting
from the completely ambient show with Mixmaster Morris, Pete Namlook, and
Spacetime Continuum.  There seemed to be a large excitement over the night
since for a large part the rave scene has run its course in breaking new
boundries.  In usual form, I'd flown into San Francisco for the weekend to
witness yet another event.

It was broadly advertised that there would be little to no dancing at this
show.  Pillows, beanbags, blankets and whatever were encouraged accessories.
The organizers had covered the dancefloor with a large padded carpet, then put
remnants around the top level balcony.  The decorations were definitely
homespun, but interesting nonetheless.  For the most part, the room looked
like a large psychedelic Arabian tent.  The sound itself was not obnoxiously
loud, just loud enough.  I sat near the speakers when it started with no
problems, but stuffed my ears with toilet paper later.  As I moved around the
room, I would take it out to hear better based on my placement.

Initially, I sat watching Spacetime Continuum do his stuff.  Although his
collaboration with Terrence McKenna makes me green, I do enjoy his solo music
quite a bit.  He concocted an interesting, yet varied set.  His show dipped
into dance, but not for long.  It seemed that whenever a beat kicked in, the
crowd cheered and started to throb.  Otherwise, the audience looked very much
like a large slumber party.

When Mixmaster Morris finally came on, he crouched in front of the carpet
behind two 1200's and a Denon 2000 (yay!!).  The beginning of his set started
with an old recording of relaxation techniques that was used on "Flying High"
as well.  Over the course of the night, he brewed a mostly beatless set.  I
only recognized a few tracks, and in his first set, there was no Irresistible
Force that I could place.  The reason I say this is because there were a
couple of tracks that sounded dead-on in the IF style.  Maybe we have another
album to look forward to in the near future?

While Morris was spinning, Pete Namlook sat behind him messing with some
equipment on the desk.  It was a subject for debate as to whether he was
actually doing anything or not.  What I believe it ended up being was the fact
that he was doing setup for his performance.  When Morris finished, Namlook
took over immediately with some light airy ambience that ranged from simple
sweeps into odd electronic noise.  About half an hour into this, THE BEAT
KICKED IN.  The largest cheer from the audience yet went up as this very slick
n' cool 110 bpm crusher bounced around the room.  Namlook let it fly for a
while, then when back to straight ambience.  This went on for a performance of
almost 90 minutes.  Frankly I wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was
sent to DAT for later publishing.

Morris came back on and proceeded to mix into the morning.  This set was
airier, more angelic than the first.  I fell asleep twice, waking up to what
seemed like the heavens opening up for me.  Around 5:00 AM, the ambient
version of "Space is the Place" came on.  I smiled as he worked in Psychick
Warriors of Gaia's "Obsidian" underneath it.  I really think it was the best
thing he played all night.  What a brilliant track.  My only complaint with
his performance is that it wasn't much of a performance.  I would have much
rather seen him do something live and/or play more of his own material.  This
is why I feel Namlook bested him.

Overall an excellent show.  Certainly nothing like the Orb or Orbital shows I
was in town for previously, but a certain newness prevailed.  Besides the fact
that this was an over-21 show, I think there was an even older crowd present.
It seems that whenever a new idea comes around the highschool kids are the
last to embrace it.  The ambient slumber party may or may not take off as a
replacement for rave, but I certainly think it has some potential.  I received
one flyer from a DJ who I had seen do ambient rooms at Wicked events
advertising an ambient outdoor event.  If it wasn't so cold here right now,
I'd fire up the generator and do one of my own.  Instead, all I have to do is
look forward to summer.

Had a similar problem getting out there---too far, my friends bailed out 
because of the distance involved, and didn't really feel like driving so 
far by myself! So, the point is: anybody who has lack of people to 
carpool with call me for the next one. I'll drive if my car wants to be 
driven. (510) 536-5430.

On Mar 29,  4:00pm, you proclaimed:
} Morris is not leaving until friday, and he mentioned some "underground" 
} ambient parties happening before he leaves.  Anyone know more?

He may be at Spaz tomorrow night, according to someone at last night's
party.

Hello there all.  This is another view of the weekend.  I think I am the
only person that attended both Liquid Air and the Full Moon so I have some
comparing to do between big and small.  First off I went to Carmen's
birthday party at JMAR's house where I met Bryce, JMAR and the
aforementioned Carmen.  Alas my car was broken into but not much of a
trouble to me (they didn't steal my new records out of the front seat what
a godsend).  Then I headed over to Jon Drukman's house where I met numerous
sfravers.  We chilled and chatted and had little bits of food.  Thanks to
Jon and John for both opening up there houses to the list and being very
gracious hosts.  I then drove Susie over to Brian and Laura's place and we
prepared for Liquid Air gathering some warm clothing.  We proceeded to Twin
Peaks and were greeted by really strong winds and beautiful smiling faces.
We headed over to a place near the waterfront in the wherehouse district
and set up a few feet from the ocean.  At most I think there were 15 people
there but the vibe and the people were the best I've been around in a
looooonnnnngg time.  I grooved until about three there and reluctantly
drove down to Santa Cruz on my way home.  I stopped at the Full moon about
half a mile away actually.  It was way to big if you ask me.  One of my
friends that I ran into almost was picked a fight with and I heard a couple
of the "Watch out!" kind of unfriendly comments when I accidentally ran
into people dancing.  When I left some of the cars had been flyered with
these big ugly (imho) snoop.e flyers.  I think it's great to see our scene
growing but not at the cost of sacrificing the unity and family like
felling that were being fostered when I left last September.  I hope  I'm
not seeing another demise cycle in the scene.  The flyer I picked up looked
like cheese all over with little e-inuendos all over it which I had thought
people got over.  Not as much nitrous as Lee noted but a friend of mine
noted that there was lots of speed=bad (imho) which can create more
beligerrence and blah,blah, blah...I also hope the beach was cleaned up
afterwards because it was trashed when I was there.  Sorry so negative but
I just don't want to see the scene explode again into what happened when it
exploded in the summer of '92.  The newness may be gone for you but let the
newness go away for others, remember the feeling you had when you were at
your first rave?  if it was good do you still think people are getting that
attention, loving, and friendliness that I got and hopefully you got? just
pondering some more...we could do so much more with lots of smaller
parties...even on the same night...

    i attended the Ambience thing saturday, i really enjoyed it.  the only 
thing i didn't enjoy was the price ($15) cuz i hadta leave a little after
3am - girlfriend couldn't fall asleep due to no pillows - next time remember
to bring pillows and blankets to ambient events.
    the music from 11pm to 2:30 was spacey and cerebral - really got my
imagination going.  at times i really felt like i was tripping.  didn't have
to use ear plugs until around 3 when some really brain penetrating sub bass
things were going off - cleans out the mental cobwebs.  i especially liked
the tweeks, blurps, and churps - made a laugh out load a couple times.
    the visuals were entertaining.  film loops of cosmos, space ships,
animated robots, flowers, fractals, and mandalas.  for the most part the visuals
enhanced the music - effective trip matching.
    mellow crowd, not alot of cig. smoking, some herb was around, and you know
king st. serves alcohol, so a lot of people were drinking.  and a lot were
flat out asleep.  i guess $15 bucks is cheaper than a hotel.  seems there was
a lot of people getting in for free on guest list.  but the place was pretty
packed.  bean baged souls on a sea of ambient tranquility.

Terrence MCkenna somehow has that distinctly nifty nasal tone that places him

howdy all,

it has been forever since i've posted, but i had a really good weekend
anad thought that i would tell the tale.

in the condensed format:

Friday night i was going to go to Saturday Night Fever at the roxie as a
weird thing to do with a bunch of friends.  we were not the only ones
with this idea, sold out.  so we went to the elbo room and waited for
the sprial jive line to post the local of the party.  wait awile and
finally got it.  gathered up blankets and sweaters, we were off.  after
we arrived directions were given to us by a guy who hide in a bush.  we
fucked up those directions and proceded to have quite an adventure tring
to find the space.  when we got there there were only about 10 people.
We made a camp of blankets and got settled and took turns wandering and
exploring.  music was good to great all night.  sound system was great,
anyone know whose it was?  we left about 5am.

Sat: my girlfriend and i went to 20 tank waiting for the ska show at
slims to open up.  hi-top beer there is really good but they are not
fucking kinding about it packing a wallop.  after drinking for a couple
of hours we went to slims and checked out a couple of the bands.  we
were planing to go to the B-day party later but this was preemtived my
my girlfriend drinking too much.  thus the night was short on going out
but adventursome.  (note: a really nice homeless man helped me out in
taking care of my friend,  he also didn't ask for anything in return, i
palmed him a 10 spot and thanked him,  it always improves my day and all
to meet geniunly nice people. (especially since my car was broken into
earlier that night)).  

sunday:  went roller-blading for my first time, yet another adventure.
also watched a bunch of people in KMEL shirts around an incredably poor
sound system for the dancing section of the closed road.  reminds my of
the sunday in the park  (permits?)

Monday:  back to school, then drove 4 hours back to SF for a private
party that my friend was throwing.  there i spun for about 2 hours, had
a great time.

ive got other news to post later this week

C-ya

many event reports these days so thought I should drop a few of mine in . .

until you believe it :)

After spending quite a few weekends in San Francisco the last few months
it's been interesting having a more extended stay at home here in the
Northwest.  

Things started out on Friday, March 11 with the return of the Choclit
Factory gang, led by Tigger & Dred-Eye, in a fine event called 
Unity & Transcendance.  It was held at the Seamans' Union of the Pacific
hall on 1st Ave. in the Belltown district of Seattle.  A big concrete
room that was covered with chalk dust from the ceiling by the time we
were done in the morning!  After the tragic shooting outside the Velvet
Elvis in February it was very important for this event to work out well
and it did indeed.  A really good crowd, great DJs including Riz, Masa,
and others, finishing with an astonishingly good trance set by Nathan
which is already in the running for "Set of the Year" honors (four made
it on my list last year, so this is saying something!).  I got to play
around with Tigger's FractInt projection setup, which was jolly fun.

We rented a van and drove back to Portland for UHF's Leprechaunland
on Saturday night the 12th.  This was held in a fresh warehouse right
around the corner from the White Eagle Tavern (for those who know the
area).  Headlining back to back with long sets were Markie and Derrick
Carter, both on three 'tables.  It would have been a better vibe except
for the fact that the sound was excruciatingly loud in the mid-low-bass,
almost painfully so.  The dance floor was sparse all evening as a result.
I gave up and walked back downtown around 6 am through the deserted
Coliseum parking lot.  The new Trail Blazer arena is rising quickly . . .
someday we'll put a REAL show in there!

The following weekend, back to Seattle for another in the series of
Evolution parties, held just a few blocks south of the Kingdome in a
cozy warehouse space.  A little too cozy in a way, the place got very
hot and the floor was sopping wet from condensation.  But the party
got off really well.  Barry Weaver and Ernie Munson cranked it up, but then
Dub Tribe just knocked everyone's sox off with a set that transcended
their phenomenal Together birthday party set of a few weeks ago, if
that even seems possible.  Donald finished us off with some excellent
phat Deeetroit techno, the REAL stuff.  The space could have been better
but given the neurotic vibe that's been present at some of the other
Seattle parties I've been to this was a very good time overall.
We then dropped in to the after-party at the Velvet Elvis, which went
until at least 2 pm.  Some of the crew went off to a barn party somewhere
out Snohomish way but I bailed to catch the train back to Puddletown
at 5 pm.  

This past weekend was Portland's turn.  Friday night turned out to be
one of our better gatherings ever, even though it was at the old Greyhound
station, site of some of the weakest parties and worst sound I've ever
been unfortunate enough to experience.

However, this night turned that around, at least for once.  Sasha, Kimball
and John Digweed breezed through really fine UK-house-trance sets right
up me own alley.  JD's records were lost by the airline but found in time
for a late set.  But Sasha stole the show with an excellent set, mostly
*not* of his own stuff, played with panache and an exquisite sense of
timing.  The local DJs were all suitably impressed :)

The following night was a small party called 'Together' in an art gallery
over on the inner east side.  Actually it's quite a good location for
a smaller gathering, with two good sized rooms upstairs off the street
and no neighbors to complain about noise.  I don't know who all the DJs
were but Mike Stevens put in a fine set.  Brad Vachal had forgotten the
closing time for a downtown garage and his car (and records!) were locked
inside over night, so he had to use his non-standard stuff, didn't feel
that great about how things were going, and bailed off the 'tables early.
But I ended up chatting with him for a quite a while.  I really got a
sense of Portland starting to coalesce again as a scene with a distinct
personality instead of just a random collection of clubbers dressing down
'to rave', which is how it appeared to me a year ago.  there's been a
core all along which has been trying to put on good events and catch a
fire, but it's slow going.  The opening of Platinum Records (where Brad
is one of the main buyers) has really made a difference here - it's
a real DJ-oriented store and has helped provide an anchor for the scene.
At least it has for me!

The number of parties here in Portland is on the upswing again.  We have
Jeno coming in a couple of weeks, plus a bunch of other things.  Every
spring hope arises that Portland will finally get its act together, we
have all the right ingredients here.  Tune in again, same bat-time,
same bat-channel :)

I've been droppin' the phat beats in the comfort of my office.  I can't
compete with Eli's across the street or the Greek restaurant downstairs
when they play bouzouki (and especially when they smash the plates!),
but the booming sound in Oregon Pacific 305 is my new/old 1975 Yamaha
amp driving four satellites and a subwoofer.  Manoj of CORE was here
the other day and I regaled him with sounds from across the spectrum.
And I'm actually getting to the point where I can do a passable beat-
match a fair percentage of the time!  

Geoff White is in Seattle this week and I'm hoping for more cross-
fertilization between the Northwest and Bay Area this year.  Let's talk
about doing something around the Grateful Dead shows in Seattle and
Eugene in June, and keep yer earballs peeled for info about something
happening near the Country Fair in July.  And this is the time to start
thinking about *my* favorite idea, which is an all-weekend-long net.affair
outside somewhere with 36+ hours of music and a relaxing good time for all.

See you in . . . the future!

Music: As a whole, I'd have to say I was pretty disappointed.  Every time
I heard a song that I liked, I would get up and dance, only to be sent
back to the blanket two songs later with another boring
BOOM-CHIC-BOOM-CHIC, 1-2-3-4 boring house track.  Now don't get me wrong,
I can get into house, but if I'm going to really trance out, I need
acid.

I tottaly agree.  What was up with that.  I did leave around 7:00 and I here it got better after that thoug

Hey there, all!

Friday- I went with a friend to the new billiards hall in
downtown SJ. It was very expensive, but I guess we couldn't be
too surprised at that- it took us nearly an hour just to clear
one table. Towards the end of the game, we decided we were 
playing just to hear the sound of one ball hitting another ;)
ahhh, sweet music! Then we went to The Red Light District to
hear Grotus (add as many umlauts as you can); this band is best 
described as melody through percussion- lotsa noise!

Saturday I went to a birthday dinner for my daddy; that's it.

Sunday is pretty much negligable as far as house events go (except 
for my own personal house-cleaning stuff, but who wants to hear 
the details about taking water spots off of a mirror), 
but then comes Monday!

On Monday night I went to the second-ever meeting of a 
newly founded SJ women's collective. Although its constituents 
are primarily from the SJ house scene, we hope to include 
all kinds of different women. Basically, the group is going 
to be whatever we make of it and will include any activities that 
spark interest: from reading recommended books/articles and later
discussing them to volunteering for rape crisis centers and/or 
women's shelters, from participating in demonstrations and AIDS walks 
together to holding parties, from group camping to publishing a 
group newsletter for public distribution to  whatever else
interests the individual(s) of the group. If you hadn't 
guessed, there's no hierarchical structure to the group-
those women who want to participate can. 

Best surprise of the evening: I finally met Vivian and 
Lavonne (Hiya!)

The brainpower and spirituality of this meeting was so intense 
that I almost felt too wired to go to FreeLife, but I went anyway...
the energy was pretty diffuse- patches here and there. The set 
(who was playing when???? 12-2?) was a little too cowboy disco 
for my tastes- kinda reminded me of the roller rinks I used to 
frequent when I was seven, but it was fun to say hellos 
and do a little jig. I left early (1:30), dropped a friend by 
her house and went on my merry way to sleep, or to try to sleep 
anyway, as my head was still reeling from the meeting.

If any of you want more information about the group; meeting 
times, "all genders welcome" nights, etc..., just gimme an 
e-mail holler!

Yay!   I can hardly wait...  It's a long time since I was able to really
GET DOWN and boogie an entire weekend.    I hope I can get my car fixed soon
so I can start traveling around,  scouting for sites.

Say!  I got this killer idea,    Lets get together a small group of people
some weekend,  and go out driving around,   looking for suitable sites
to have killer outdoor gigs.   We could make a picnic/camping trip out
of it,   discover neat areas seldom visited by people.   Sorta like the
"Bay Area Backroads" places.     I remember a long time ago,  when I was
tinkering with the phone system,   I would go to some of the strangest
remotest places and hack their phone system.    All it takes is a good
map of California and the intention of having a good time exploring new
and strange places.     While I was visiting these places,  I would hang
out in the local gathering spots (pool halls,  etc),  and get to know the
locals.    That way, I was able to learn a lot about what goes on locally,
and I think that once we put forth the idea of having a rave/party in
their area,  they (The locals) would be more than willing to help us
get in contact with some of their friends who might have lots of private
land to have such a gig.    Most of the time,  at least in the summer,
these local folks living in remote areas would be really open to the idea
of having a real rave in their area.    It's worth checking out...

On the way up to Harbin Hot springs last summer,   I discovered an old 
race track out somewhere between San Rafael and Vallejo area (The Hiway
connecting the who cities),   and it appears to be far enough away from
homes.    I'll try and remember exactly where it is.   It was just as big,
if not bigger than the Livermore race track area where the Gathering was
held near the 4th of July (Remember the hill fire?).

Anyone else,  who goes driving around N. Calif should also keep a keen eye
out for such sites.    I think that it might be possible to locate the owners
of these places and negotiate a deal with them.   Of course we want the party
to be big enough to be fun,  but not super mega-large as to cause problems
in clean-up,  or other problems.    But predicting the size of such partys
is next to impossible.

Today is Brian Behlendorf's birthday, and in honor of this I'm going
to say many words about this wonderful person.  Of course, you could
say I'm biased since he's my boyfriend, but if you look at the facts
of what he has accomplished you'll want to run up to him and give him
birthday hugs too.

The net-rave scene as we know it was started by Brian.  He started
raving in LA when acid house and Baby Ford were king.  When he moved
to Berkeley for college, he found out about the Internet and started
reading newsgroups, including alt.rave.  He then got the brilliant idea
to start a mailing list for ravers in the San Francisco area, and
sfraves was born in early March, 1992.  People from all over the US
subscribed, and sfraves spawned the rest of the lists that make up 
the net-rave scene today:  midwest, southeast, DC, northeast, mountain,
northwest, southern california, pittsburg-cleveland, and so on.

One day Brian noticed a strange telnet process running on a computer he 
was logged into.  He telnetted to the same port and discovered the Unix CB.
He got ahold of the code and with Craig Kanarick's help turned it into
vrave which has done more to bring far-flug ravers together than anyone can
imagine.

Articles in magazines, without knowing it, make passing references to
Brian's achievements with great frequency.  In the recent Rolling Stone
(with Anthony K. from the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the cover) there is
an article about techno and raving.  It starts out with a description of
a Full Moon Massive at Bonny Doon beach, a site which Brian first brought
to the attention of the raving community by throwing "Connection" down
there and then suggesting the site to Wicked for a Full Moon Party.  The
same article also noted that "talk about techno and raving on the 
Internet runs high," which is due in part to Brian's inspiration that
prompted the formation of all the raving mailing lists.

If that wasn't enough Brian set up the ftp/gopher/www site at for
raving at techno.stanford.edu, and the experienced he gained from that
got him a job managing the ftp/gopher/www site for Wired Magazine.  He's
gotten many positive compliments for his work on both sites, and is
helping to set the standard for good and interesting web sites in the
on-line publishing world.

Happy Birthday to Brian!!!

We love him!!!

Awwwwwwww *blsush* *blush*

To be honest, I think if I'm a victim of circumstance more than
anything else - if it wasn't me it would have been someone else, and
things would have been different, not better or worse, just
different... but when it comes down to it I wouldn't be ANYWHERE if it
weren't for YOU, Laura, and everyone else here on sfraves and vrave
and in our communities on and off the net.  I don't /can't even
comprehend what things would have been like had these particular
sequences of events not happened...

I'm up here in Seattle going attending talks on
IP over ATM and stuff like that so I won't be able to
give you a hug until I get back.  I just want to say
the the Seattle posse is WONDERFUL and they have really
made me feel at home.  I just want to put them all in my
fanny packk and bring them back to SF with me, (but
that would be a big blow to the scene here :).

We should DEFINITELY plan a joint event maybe at a midway
point like Portland, where the SF, Seattle and Portland
posse's could all come together.  Phred you are the 
regional globe trotter and know most of the folks up here
do you think you could put it together?

I (or Markie) could maybe talk Wicked into a field
trip. (good publicity for the impending sound system)

The Solstice would be perfect for a gatheriing of the
West Coast CyberTribe!!

Yeah, you only missed the best 5-6 hours of it. :-)

Gee.  I guess me, my mate, & Crunch are the only SFRavers who thought
that the music was phenomenal.  I do tend to be a little more receptive
at outdoor events and I did wander off now and then and perhaps missed
some low points, but I still stand by my opinion that this was the best
spinning I've heard since maybe the last Gathering.  Well, it's all pretty 
subjective anyway.  Hey Geoff, how about backing me up!

Well I wasn't going to post until I got back from Seattle but the conferences
here today are boring so I might as well hang out in the terminal room :)

I was _very_ dissappointed in this FMM all around (maybe because I know a
little too much :) but let's just say that it could have been phenominal
with a little more planning.  Basically the sound sucked big time, this was 
due to the fact that the support poles for the high cabinets were forgotten
and thus the cabs could not be elevated abouve the crowd.  The sound system 
was also the perfect size for 300 people but not for 3000 (which is what my 
estimate of the crowd size is).  At 0300 Saturday I counted 1100 cars in the
2 miles on either side of bonnie doon.  I didn't drive up bonnie dune road
but I know from previous experience that you can easily park another 500
cars up there.  I know that Wicked was informed that this would be the largest
FMM ever.  The location chosen to set up the turntables was right under
the far clifs, THIS WAS VERY DANGEROUS! A dislodged rock (from the sonic
vibrations) could have easily killed a sleeping or dancing raver.
There were hords of drunk and tweeking people and I was offered speed more
than once during the night.

I suppose it did get better when Markie came on, I managed to get closer to
the sound system and Markie did deliver the goods.  Seeing all the familiar
faces and lots of smiles made me feel a little better but seeing all of the
trash on the beach (especially the spent baloons from nitrous consumption)
didn't make me feel happy. (I remember when the beach was _always_ left
spotless, I hate to think of what state it was left in this time)
So I must say that I didn't get to hear Jeno's set. I had to leave at 0830
in order to get on a plane to Seattle.  I hope Jeno did manage to pull it
out in the 11th hour, In my opinion the party really needed it.

I'm almost starting to feel stupid for having had such a good time.  
Maybe I was just well-prepared.  I've always found most big parties, 
*especially* weekend FMRs, to suck for the first few hours.  Remember 
the one in Richmond?

This was very sad.  I would say that most of the mess was made by those
who came and left early.  And that mess is highly representative of the
kind of mentality (alchohol, nitrous, "let's just hang out for a few 
hours") that is the antithesis of a good rave vibe.  For me, these parties
don't really start until that element is reduced.  Too bad you had to 
leave when things were just starting to really take off.

If the music started at 3, then you left before the midway point.  Things 
were getting real good IMO and it wasn't in the "11th hour".   

There's a lesson to be learned here:  Take a nap, show up late.

Yes, well, this is a case where dumb and happy is definantly better
than smart and disappointed :-) :-)

Ive already decided that IF I ever go to another FMR, I'm not leaving
home until 0500 or so.  I should think by now it would be evident to
everyone that there's no point in arriving early :-)

Sounds like this one left Bonny Doon trashed.  That's too bad.  
Not alot that the 50 or so left at the end can do to clean up after
3000 messy people who can't pick up after themselves, though.

Even though its getting late in the week, i would like to share my own 
feelings on the FMR.  Lee and i made some really excellent time getting to 
bonny doone beach (1:15 minutes) and upon arrival saw as many cars in one 
place as we've ever seen -- it was a mega event.  I knew that it was going 
to be great when we parked and happenned to run into friends parking 
next to us -- which was really weird considering how many people were 
there.  Much to my delight and surprise the weather at 4:00 a.m. was 
remarkably warm and comfortable. The sound at first was not good and wasn't 
helped by all the people parked in front of the speakers, but by 6:00 or 
7:00 a.m. the crowd was much thinned and Markie was out of this world.  He 
played for hours and let us hear some new things, most remarkable.  Jeno's 
set was almost scary it was so great, and the people dancing seemed 
possessed by some kind of rave spirit.  

The crowd was strange...it took a while for the unity to come together, but 
when it did it was awsome; by around 10:00 most of the clueless were gone 
and what was left was one of the most beautiful scenes of togetherness.  I 
can't see why there have been so many negative posts about the party by 
people who left way  before it was over.  However, I do blame part of the
problem on the fact that there was quite a bit of alcohol there.  I must
sadly admit that a lot of these people left their garbage behind (i.e., 
beer bottles and snack wrappers) much more so than any FMR party i've ever 
been to.  I regret to say that Lee and I forgot our garbage bags and didn't 
clean up as much as we would have liked to or usually do.  

All in all, i would say that this party was a reaffirmation in my faith 
that the scene is not dead.  There was plenty of good feeling and postive 
energy.  Lately there has been much complaining about the "scene" being 
on its way out; perhaps its just a matter of getting out of things what you 
put into it.  Keep the energy up and the postive vibe alive and things will 
go on...

hi folx,
let me add my feelings about the fmr. i had a pretty good time. i went
there by myself and ran into jack and leslie plus lee, jeannie.
the musick was pretty good, a bit too much on the housey side, but
i had a definite trance experience  at times. the crowd was mixed
some folx with a strong vibe, other folx more negative. i had brought
with me some friends from san diego and they really enjoyed themselves.
we left at 9:30 am, after the generator died. sorry to have missed the
end, which is usually worth the wait!
take care/shalom

A little calendar preview...

This Frdiay night, April 1st, a group from Paramount is
sponsoring a party at the Trocadero to be filmed for an 
interactive CD-ROM.  As I understand the CD is in three
parts: I forget the first, the second is a trip through
GG Park w/Rollerblading etc., and the third is a rave.
There will be scripted scenes with actors taking place
before the doors open: a smart bar scene and a chill
room scene are that I know about for sure.

The bulk of the footage will be spontaneous-- live shots of
people dancing, etc.  It sounds kinda neat to me.  Who
knows if they'll be "true" to what really goes down, but
they at least admit much of their ignorance and are letting
people with some experience call the shots.  (Sean, one
of the partners of Corduroy City is the main promoter)

Well, there's two issues here. (1) mess, (2) coming and leaving early. 
A better question to ask is -- why not start earlier? I haven't
bothered w/ a FMR laterly because they start so FFing late that it
really  throws me for a loop.  W/r/t (1), perhaps if the parties
weren't so temporally skewed, people might have the time and energy to
show the caring that we've grown to expect from ravers. Insead, because
it's so marginalized and difficult to attend, you get attendees that do
nothing more than a quick wham-bam-thank-you-m'am party.

> There's a lesson to be learned here:  Take a nap, show up late.

Except for the times when the party moves. And then you end up driving
1.5 hrs for nothing; or finding out after the fact that it got
relocated to  candlestick (10 minutes away from home). And I have
yet to find out about relocated FMRs until after the fact, since
that info is only disseminated to those that stuck it out all night.

I remember some damn fine FMRs up at the Cummings Skyway Exit near
Pinole which started early (midnight) and ended in the morning.... In
that day (he says while smoking a corncob pipe and rocking in a creaky
chair) FMR sites were left pretty damn clean.

Also, it really is quite unsafe to plan a party where you've forced
most of your attendees to stay up all night, then party all day,  then
drive home for 1-2hrs. They'll either be driving while  extremely
tired; or driving while tired and coming down from whatever it took to
get them to stay up all night. I need not mention some of the serious
FMR-related driving injuries that have happened in the past, ostensibly
for such reasons.

--------------------

I have have long been sick of the "FMR is for serious ravers/insiders
only" attitude  that follows from the planning of FMRs. Basically, if
you've got  nothing else going on in your life or your life==raving,
then you can hack it. Otherwise if you've got personal
projects/interests, work, family, etc then you're *out* because you're
just not going to be able to waste all that time/effort/sleep looking
for a party. Doesn't sound very all-inclusive to me.

I'm sure someone's going to counter with "so you want your raves handed
to you on a silver platter"; It's not that at all -- but I don't think
i should have to shove a spool of barbed-wire through my ear,
sledgehammer it through my brain, and then pull it through the other
side (all while smiling gleefully!) just to rave. (I hate it when that
happens!)

I, for one, am looking forward to one-off outdoor parties, e.g.  MESS,
New Moon Rave, LiquidAir/SoundVision, Connection, etc...

All I got to say is, "Wow".  And I just loved the music.  Markie, Jeno, and 
Thomas spun beats that in my tastes were right on.  So Thomas spun 2 or 3
disco songs that I thought sounded discoey but hey.....life goes on. ;-)

By the way, the beach looked pretty clean (from a distance) cuz we decided to 
stop by the area once more at 5pm after checking out Santa Cruz.  While we
were checking out an herbal store there, I met a friend I met at a
Rainbow Gathering in Kentucky last summer.

 I discovered an old
race track out somewhere between San Rafael and Vallejo area (The Hiway
connecting the who cities),   and it appears to be far enough away from
homes.
----------------------------------------------------
Ya, there's an old drive-in or two out around there too, and other places
as well.  I'd love to see graphics projected onto a giant screen.  Maybe
they could even put the tunes through those little mono speakers that you
hook onto your car window.  Car raving. ;-)

ok here's a clarification:  what did I mean by "Wow"?  The vibe going on from
about 9am till the end (was that around 2pm?) was just amaaaazzzzzzing.
It was like, Apollo calling ground control......

Some people stood on the speakers for hours and kinda energized the dancing 
crowd that by afternoon was much smaller and homey-er (or is that homier)  and
had many very exhuasted legs.  It was so blissful to just watch everybody and 
the vibe all day long.

	I want to organize a Bonnie Doon clean-up party.

	I've wanted to go down there and camp out one weekend and just chill
	and explore, why not combine it with a massive clean up.
	We could have an ambient party some friday night, clean-up saturday
	have a more jumpin party saturday night, clean up on sunday.
	People could come and go. Bring trash bags. or just lug a bag or two up 
	out of the beach. It would only take 50 or so people a couple of hours
	to completely clean that beach.  We could maybe arrange some county 
	people to come and pick up the bags at the top of the hill.

Why I Like Dance Music.

Because a gangsta from Long Beach bites Michael McDonald's rhythms and calls it G-Funk.

Because a curly haired white boy from Marin samples Isaac Hayes and Fat Albert along with Bono and Bruce Springsteen, calling it Transcendental Funk.

Because two lads from England use Perry Como in a thick fucking jam.

Because you hear it when you're eating unagi maki in a yuppie college town.

Because you hear it when you're eating pizza on the street downtown.

Because it liberates the mind.

Because it liberates the ass.

Hey...Jason, you little schmuck...you stole my idea!  ah well, here are
my personal additions...

10. you are happy when there's a recession because it means more empty
    warehouses

9.  food, water, air, Vick's...all are about of equal importance

8.  you can live for an entire weekend out of your bookbag

7.  you are no longer just a raver...but a promoter, vendor, DJ, etc...

6.  you know about the INFORMATION POLICE

5.  you're white and have dreads

4.  you have trouble naming 5 friends who are not pierced SOMEWHERE

3.  you'll pay $20 for a ticket to an event that may very well not happen...
    and you'll pay $30 for a pill that may very well be asprin...but you
    WILL NOT pay $0.25 for that big glass of water!

2.  you can't pass an empty warehouse, church, school, big open field, barn,
    airplane hanger, phone booth, nuclear power plant, etc...without getting
    that far-off look in your eye and saying...'wow, what a great site for
    a ...'

1.  and even then you're not a TRUE RAVER...because no one but myself
    can possibly THINK about calling themselves a TRUE RAVER!

You know you're a REAL raver when you see Capn Crunch 4 times in one week!

Who is planning on going to the South Bay Lunch today? It's a rare occasion
this week on my break that I am up way before 12, but I am trying to decide
whether or not to go back to bed...:)

Hey...Jason, you little schmuck...you stole my idea!  ah well, here are
my personal additions...

10. you are happy when there's a recession because it means more empty
    warehouses

9.  food, water, air, Vick's...all are about of equal importance

8.  you can live for an entire weekend out of your bookbag

7.  you are no longer just a raver...but a promoter, vendor, DJ, etc...

6.  you know about the INFORMATION POLICE

5.  you're white and have dreads

4.  you have trouble naming 5 friends who are not pierced SOMEWHERE

3.  you'll pay $20 for a ticket to an event that may very well not happen...
    and you'll pay $30 for a pill that may very well be asprin...but you
    WILL NOT pay $0.25 for that big glass of water!

2.  you can't pass an empty warehouse, church, school, big open field, barn,
    airplane hanger, phone booth, nuclear power plant, etc...without getting
    that far-off look in your eye and saying...'wow, what a great site for
    a ...'

1.  and even then you're not a TRUE RAVER...because no one but myself
    can possibly THINK about calling themselves a TRUE RAVER!

You know you're a REAL raver when you not only notice that household
appliances like washing machines can generate a funky beat, you also
argue about whether it's tribal or trance :-)

			 Your Sister's House
		      Thursday, March 31st, 1994

		   Susan  Tara  Tamara  Jan Cooley

			 Audio by SoundVision

			     415-435-7575

Discussion group at 9pm. Guest speaker is Pebbles, a hemp legaliztion
activist whose court case is challenging the constitutionality of the
drug laws.  I recommend going to the discussion group as a good way to
meet people and find out what's on their minds. This one should be
particularily interesting.

In SF. Grooves from 10-4. All ages. $5. Ins-n-outs. Free water.

What can I say? The best sound system in San Francisco, DJs who have
been dying to spin at this party for months...  I think we're in for a
wonderful experience :).

3 days might be a bit much. How about:

  Connections IV?

  Saturday afternoon: clean up
  Saturday night: rock the planet
  Sunday morning: ambient brunch
  Sunday afternoon: massive cleanup

take it easy

and a bunch of people from the socal-raves mailing list
will be at a club (well... restaurant with music) called Dub
sooooo....
i was thinking that since these would be going off at the same times
that it would be major neato spiffy keen if there was a vrave connection
at both ends

although it seems like everything can get to both ends
(ie, terminal and phone)
just to make sure, if anyone has either of these on either end
and you wouldnt mind bringing it along...
:)

if not, i hope to see you all tonite, virtually or not

dana

	Suppose there was a net-service provider in the Bay Area which
charged only $10-$15/month.

	Suppose also that this provider was dedicated to keeping the
dialin linesavailable such that you would rarely get a busy signal.
	Suppose that this service was not run by an impersonal
provider but someone who was active in the sfraves communtiy, who was
very interested in helping the net-raver community through the service
that s/he will be providing.
	Also suppose that the person running the service was strongly
dedicated to personal privacy & anonymity, active in the cypherpunks
community.


	Suppose that the person running the service would like to help
out on sfraves parties which are internet connected.

	Now, given two negative points.. that at the outset: 1) The
net connection to the service would only be a 14.4 link. [I.e. it will
be a realtime link, but trying to telnet in/out would be tortuous and
file transfers will be slow] 2) The only dialups will be in
Berkeley/510.
	(These negative points would only be at the outset.. but..)

	Would you sign up?

I'm trying to see if this is feasible.


Please reply privately. Thanks.

If this is gonna happen, I'd suggest doing the major cleanup FIRST to
get it out of the way, then do the DO, then do a sweep to clean out
whatever remains.

I'd much rather party on a clean beach anyway!

At larger parties, perhaps offering a reward would give people an
incentive to clean up. If the mess gets to be major, pass around trash
bags, and give people who bring in a bag of trash a $4 off coupon to
the next Wicked, or perhaps a laminate, or whatever low-cost item
would be enough do it. (I'd do it for a bagel & tea :)).

This worked famously at Womad, where they gave away one free Ben &
Jerry's coupon to each person who brought in a bag of trash. When the
100,000 people cleared out from the all-day event, the place was
fairly clean. Nothing that a cleanup crew couldn't deal with in a
short amount of time.  A construction site sized dumpster near the
front was piled 20 feet high with kitchen size garbage bags people had
turned in.

Well it's just an idea. I'm kinda bummed too that people won't clean
up after themselves. If I think of anything else I'll post it.

Subject: free wood for outdoor parties
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

I had to go to the post office for my area of San Francisco
the other day, and outside of it they had LARGE stacks of
wooden pallets, the kind of things they use in warehouses
for the fork lifts to pick up.  

There was a sign on the wall next to the pallets saying "free
wood."

So, if you feel so inclined, they might make some good bonfire
fuel.  It's not recyling, but it is reusing which is also a
Good Thing to do.

To get the this particular post office head East on Army Street.
When you get to 3rd Street turn right.  Go over the little
drawbridge and make your second left onto Burke.  The post office
is the huge warehouse on the left.

I think this could be a whole lot of fun.  I recently went on a trip
up through Northern California and noticed a few places that might
be adequate as far as space is concerned.  I go up there often and
do *a lot* of driving around looking for potential photos. 
I'm planning on going up again in a few weeks and could put site
scouting on my agenda too if people are seriously interested in
trying to work this out.  Let me know.

Does anyone know the story behind the site off of hiway 101 near Piercy 
that was used for Regae on the River and I believe for a Gathering of 
the Vibes?  

Take care,
