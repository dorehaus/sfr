Content-Length: 2177

	It seems that this subject has never really been explored
	here on sfraves but I think if there ever was a place to talk
	about raving and sex/love this would be it.  First a few qualifiers,
	I'm using the term sexualove to try to be a little more accurate
	and to also side step some flames.  Sexualove is that special energy
	that you feel for (an)other(s) that would or could reach expression
	in a physical (sexual) way.  It doesn't mean that you have to actually
	"have sex" (but it could) but it is a "deeper" feeling then just the
	"platonic" emotions that have readily been shared.

	My questions are:

	1) How has your sex/love life, capacity, expression, etc. changed
	since you have been raving?

	2) For people who are single, do you find it easier or harder to get
	into a sexualove relationship now that you are a raver?

	3) For people in committed relationships, how has raving changed your
	sexualove cycles/behavior?

	4) Is making love to another raver "different" than making love to
	a "non-raver"?

	5) Does the Eros that is generated at some parties (like a Wicked)
	excite you or is it a turn off?

	6) Since you have become a raver, do you think that you are more or less
	open to exploring other sexualove lifestyles then the one you are
	currently practicing?

	7) Do you think ravers are more tolerant of other people's sexualove
	preferences?

	8) If you are at a party and the music is _really_ goin-off and
	a friend comes up to you (that you've wanted for sometime, I
	might add) and wants you to go with them to the chill-out room
	(obviously to make- out); do you go with them or do you stay on the
	dance-floor?

	9) For those of you who trance, how has this affected your sexualove
	life?  Do you enter trance states more easily while making love?  Does
	it get in the way of meeting perspective partners at a party (as in
	you look pretty funny with your eyes crossed :)

	10) How many of you now (or have) made love to music (house or
	otherwise) and how has this experience affected you?


I know some of these questions are pretty intimate, you can use some 
anonymous mailers to reply, if you don't want anyone to know who you are.

There was a great piece in Doonsbury recently about the hyper-sensitive frat 
boy (or the "Greco-American Cultural Association Member") who was so offended 
that he didn't get an A that he sued the school. He used all this colorful
left wing politically correct jargon to describe the trauma he was being put
through by the evil teacher who gave him a B because he blew off the final exam.
So all you mean people who are going to say something nasty about those poor
Frat Boys, go read Doonsbury and raise your social consciousness first, and
don't flame people just because they're stereotyped as stupid beer guzzling 
misogynistic homophobic jerks, since they were probably born that way, 
inheriting it from their parents. Try to have some compassion for their
situation: when you rebel against parents like that, they stop paying your
credit card bill, and that really hurts where it counts.

I just wanted to tell you all that of course all campuses are different, 
and there are a couple of fraternities that I would like to highlight (in 
a round-a-bout way). There are fraternities that aren't beer chugging 
festivals year round, but actually forbid drinking. 

Alpha Gamma Omega is a Christian fraternity (I understand that 
this is a touchy subject here on SFR, but keep flames to your 
fireplace.) There also is Epsilon Sigma Rho that will hold 
members accountable to not drinking/doing drugs if you first 
say right off that it's against your religion (or whatever). I like this 
very much; I mean if it's going to be around and if you don't want to do it 
(whatever that is) then it's good to have someone "on your side."

Of course, the common thing to say is, who cares? Well, I do. And that is 
my soapbox for the day.

Greetings, ravers!  This is a long, and somewhat philosophical post.
You may wish to save this, and read it at your leisure.

I've been involved with organizing raves since last September (actually,
earlier if you count all the planning for that first Fluid Groove--which
started in July (!) ), and helping out with quite a lot of events in
one capacity or another since that time, too.  One of the questions
that has recently been asked of me (in the context of Liquid Air) is:
why not charge money or have a donation basket at your parties.  This
question led me into a long explanation of my philosophy and beliefs.
That thread led me to post this message, share these beliefs with you,
and, hopefully, engender some discussion about these issues.

My subject line is "Rave, Community, and Money" because I want
to open a discussion with you all about the role of money in our real
and virtual community of SFRaves.  

I strongly believe that community (intentional, virtual, and physical) is
based on the desire of its participants to be with each other, to share
themselves, to work toward common goals in ways that could *not* be
accomplished by individuals.  It is also my utopian idea that people
engage in activities together because they want to, and not for immediate
material gain.  Any gain that is achieved is shared _by the community_,
not by one or more individuals.  This is not to say that each person
participating in the community may not gain from a shared project...far
from it.  However, I cannot support the idea of one individual benefitting
substantially more than other individuals from the efforts of the community.
From their own efforts, yes.  From community projects, no.

I believe that raves *are* a community project.  I have never regarded any
liquid air as "my" party.  Sometimes, as a figure of speech, and for the
sake of easy communications, i or others use that phrase.  But, I don't
believe it for one second.  I've always approached these things as a
community effort, and my role was to act as the organizer, to help people
coordinate their activities and schedules so that we could be together
in one place, at one time, with the essential tools of our community
at hand: a space, a sound system, DJs, and smiles.  the "rave" is what
*we* make of it, what we add to it, what we give and receive.  consequently,
i believe that each person who participates in a community project, like
a rave, adds something to it.  the dancers add something. the lurkers
add something. the security people (if present) add something. the 
money takers (if present) add something. i further believe that each
participant's contribution is valuable.

i am as egalitarian as i can possibly be.  i believe in equality and a
fundamental recognition of the worth of each individual.  *this* is what
engendered my rather rabid posts last year about "DJ Worship".  DJs are,
for the most part, nice folks, with a great skill.  however, i do not
value this more than the skill of a dancer, or other rave participants.

so, valuing egalitarianism as i do, i fail to see how i can support some
people paying money to others for something they do together, each with
an equal skill in their field. and other people taking what's left (the
profit) for their own use. i fail to see why some people get in free to
parties, while others pay, and still others get paid.  the party wouldn't
happen without everyone, so why shouldn't everyone share the risks and
rewards?

i should take a moment and say that this post occurs only in the context
of raves. i am *not* addressing the larger socio-politico-economic world.
just the issues of this community. it is also the case that i've paid my
money at any number of raves and rave-like events, gotten in free at others,
and even been paid once or twice.

having seen my share of events from both sides of the decks, from both
sides of the cash drawer, i *know* that things cost money.  and that
commitments are made.  and that some spaces cost astronomical amounts
of money to rent.  my question is:  why assume that burden if the
community will is not there?  it seems to me that when a payer/payee
relationship is established, the event is no longer a community project;
rather, entertainment or a consumable. 

if i enter into a consumer relationship, then, as a wise consumer, and
only consume the highest quality i can get for my money...i'm constantly
looking for the most "bang for the buck".  if i am present to be entertained,
then i am also looking for the highest level of quality.  and, i am 
establishing a me/you relationship....*you* entertain *me*.  this is
philosophically no different than buying a newspaper or food. it also
means that i, as a consumer, can take it or leave it.

a community project, on the other hand, is a "we" relationship. *we* do
something for each other and for the larger communities we live in. *we*
do it because we can, and because we want to. *we* assume no greater
burden than we (as individuals) can bear.  and yet, though each individual
contributes as they can, the resulting synergy of a well-coordinated,
consensus driven project, is just amazing.  i have seen and participated
in gatherings of 5,000 people or more that had no fee at the door (because
there wasn't a door), where everyone was fed and housed and cared for.
all you had to do to participate was to get yourself there...which could
be done in as much or as little luxury as you pleased.  one could be taken
care of, or take care of others. one could speak, or not. one could dance,
or not.  these gatherings (of varying sizes) were real turning points in
my concept of community, and form the basis of the beliefs i have
expounded above.  these are not silly concepts...these are real beliefs
that really work in the real world.

personally, i want to do community projects. i believe it is possible to
do community-oriented raves on a grand scale, but only if everyone in the
community *wants* to participate.  i believe that community events require
the informed consent of everyone, with willing participation in the often
tumultuous process of organizing and executing the event. and, i believe
that a community-oriented rave can be done without charging money at the
door, without establishing any consumer relationship.  what *is* required
to do such things is commitment and ingenuity...which i believe this group
has in abundance.

so, the short answer to the questions i've been asked about money and
Liquid Airs is:  i don't believe in it.  the money and time i spend in
organizing these things is willingly and freely donated to the community,
just as your participation, time, and money spent in attending is willingly
and freely donated to the community.

Just wish to put my two cents worth in (it isn't much but its all I got 
left (-;  ).  My experience with frat boys indicates that frat guys make 
great friends but terrible boyfriends.  Hangin out with them is cool, 
dating them is not.  I keep the boundary quite clear.

Not bad...

At least I'm more interested in that playlist than any block I get from 
MTV.  I thought I read there was going to be the new FSOL video, though.  
Must be my mistake.

"Hey Beavis, check out that fractal!"

"Yeah, morphing is cool.  Heh heh, heh.

      WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THOSE "FREE" SOAPS WHEN TRAVELLING
      ******************************************************
  
   Dear Maid,
   Please do not leave any more of those little bars of soap in my
   bathroom since I have brought my own bath-sized Dial.  Please remove
   the six unopened little bars from the shelf under the medicine chest
   and another three in the shower soap dish.  They are in my way.
   Thank you,
                                            S. Berman
  
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Dear Room 635,
   I am not your regular maid.  She will be back tomorrow, Thursday, from
   her day off.  I took the 3 hotel soaps out of the shower soap dish as
   you requested.  The 6 bars on your shelf I took out of your way and
   put on top of your Kleenex dispenser in case you should change your
   mind.  This leaves only the 3 bars I left today which my instructions
   from the management is to leave 3 soaps daily.
   I hope this is satisfactory.
					    Kathy
 					    Relief Maid

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Dear Maid -- I hope you are my regular maid.
   Apparently Kathy did not tell you about my note to her concerning the
   little bars of soap.  When I got back to my room this evening I found
   you had added 3 little Camays to the shelf under my medicine cabinet.
   I am going to be here in the hotel for two weeks and have brought my
   own bath-size Dial so I won't need those 6 little Camays which are on
   the shelf.  They are in my way when shaving, brushing teeth, etc.
   Please remove them.
                                            S. Berman
  
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Dear Mr. Berman,
   My day off was last Wed. so the relief maid left 3 hotel soaps which
   we are instructed by the management.  I took the 6 soaps which were in
   your way on the shelf and put them in the soap dish where your Dial
   was.  I put the Dial in the medicine cabinet for your convenience.
   I didn't remove the 3 complimentary soaps which are always placed
   inside the medicine cabinet for all new check-ins and which you did
   not object to when you checked in last Monday.  Please let me
   know if I can of further assistance.
                                            Your regular maid,
                                            Dotty
  
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Dear Mr. Berman,
   The assistant manager, Mr. Kensedder, informed me this A.M. that you
   called him last evening and said you were unhappy with your maid
   service.  I have assigned a new girl to your room.  I hope you will
   accept my apologies for any past inconvenience.  If you have any
   future complaints please contact me so I can give it my personal
   attention. Call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.  Thank you.
                                            Elaine Carmen
                                            Housekeeper
  
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
   Dear Miss Carmen,
   It is impossible to contact you by phone since I leave the hotel for
   business at 745 AM and don't get back before 530 or 6PM.  That's the
   reason I called Mr. Kensedder last night.  You were already off duty.
   I only asked Mr. Kensedder if he could do anything about those little
   bars of soap.  The new maid you assigned me must have thought I was a
   new check-in today, since she left another 3 bars of hotel soap in my
   medicine cabinet along with her regular delivery of 3 bars on the
   bath-room shelf.  In just 5 days here I have accumulated 24 little
   bars of soap.  Why are you doing this to me?
                                            S. Berman
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Dear Mr. Berman,
   Your maid, Kathy, has been instructed to stop delivering soap to your
   room and remove the extra soaps.  If I can be of further assistance,
   please call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.  Thank you,
                                            Elaine Carmen,
                                            Housekeeper
  
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Dear Mr. Kensedder,
   My bath-size Dial is missing.  Every bar of soap was taken from my
   room including my own bath-size Dial.  I came in late last night and
   had to call the bellhop to bring me 4 little Cashmere Bouquets.
                                            S. Berman
  
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Dear Mr. Berman,
   I have informed our housekeeper, Elaine Carmen, of your soap problem.
   I cannot understand why there was no soap in your room since our maids
   are instructed to leave 3 bars of soap each time they service a room.
   The situation will be rectified immediately.  Please accept my
   apologies for the inconvenience.
                                            Martin L. Kensedder

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Dear Mrs. Carmen,
   Who the hell left 54 little bars of Camay in my room?  I came in last
   night and found 54 little bars of soap.  I don't want 54 little bars
   of Camay.  I want my one damn bar of bath-size Dial.  Do you realize I
   have 54 bars of soap in here.  All I want is my bath size Dial.
   Please give me back my bath-size Dial.
                                            S. Berman
  
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Dear Mr. Berman,
   You complained of too much soap in your room so I had them removed.
   Then you complained to Mr. Kensedder that all your soap was missing so
   I personally returned them.  The 24 Camays which had been taken and
   the 3 Camays you are supposed to receive daily (sic).  I don't know
   anything about the 4 Cashmere Bouquets.  Obviously your maid, Kathy,
   did not know I had returned your soaps so she also brought 24 Camays
   plus the 3 daily Camays.  I don't know where you got the idea this
   hotel issues bath-size Dial.  I was able to locate some bath-size
   Ivory which I left in your room.
                                            Elaine Carmen
                                            Housekeeper
  
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Dear Mrs. Carmen,
   Just a short note to bring you up-to-date on my latest soap inventory.
   As of today I possess:
  
   - On shelf under medicine cabinet - 18 Camay in 4 stacks of
     4 and 1 stack of 2.
   - On Kleenex dispenser - 11 Camay in 2 stacks of 4 and 1
     stack of 3.
   - On bedroom dresser - 1 stack of 3 Cashmere Bouquet, 1
     stack of 4 hotel-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks of 4.
   - Inside medicine cabinet - 14 Camay in 3 stacks of 4 and 1
     stack of 2.
   - In shower soap dish - 6 Camay, very moist.
   - On northeast corner of tub - 1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used.
   - On northwest corner of tub - 6 Camays in 2 stacks of 3.
  
   Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks are
   neatly piled and dusted.  Also, please advise her that stacks of more
   than 4 have a tendency to tip.  May I suggest that my bedroom window
   sill is not in use and will make an excellent spot for future soap
   deliveries. One more item, I have purchased another bar of bath-sized
   Dial which I am keeping in the hotel vault in order to avoid further
   misunderstandings.
                                              S. Berman
 
 
Take care,
CC

i want to apologize to the whole list for the fraternity thread.  i'm
still amazed

1) that people would think that this was a general topic worthy of
discussion on sfraves

2) the outrageous attitudes some people have

>My experience with frat boys indicates that frat guys make great
>friends but terrible boyfriends.  Hangin out with them is cool, dating
>them is not.  I keep the boundary quite clear.

substitute "gays" or "blacks" for "frat boys" and you'll see what i
mean.  come on, people!

this is my last post on this topic.  further ridiculous stereotypical
bullshit will elicit no response from me.

at least i can be proud that my friends here on this list and in the
SF scene don't have any such hangups.

Bryce, I am in agreement with you about the difference between community
projects vs consumer products.  But I think there can also be a middle 
ground here, i.e. community-focused capatalism, where the profiteer can 
also be in tune to the needs and spirit of hir community.  This can lead 
to some very delicate situations, for obvious reasons.  But I don't think 
it is impossible to achieve a balance between the good of the community 
and the desire to make a profit, realizing that this does compromise the 
community ideal to some extent, and is very tricky to accomplish without 
an aura of phoniness, exploitation and hypocrisy.

There will always be a question of whether anything can be organized in 
a completely communal way.  Choices have to be made about many things, 
like the name of a party for instance - was the name Liquid Air, or 
In The Light, chosen by the entire community?  How about the site, flyer 
design, DJ selection?  Even when there is no money involved, 
organizers/leaders will be questioned as to their motivations - Perhaps 
Bryce, (and I know that this isn't true) Liquid Air is a power trip of 
some sort, where you are promoting a vision of yours under the cloak of 
"community", where your "profit" is an ever-inflatable self-righteous ego.  
Somebody who didn't know you could accuse you of that.  I know that I 
have had to do some soul searching in this area with In The Light.  The 
important thing isn't whether organizers are making money as much as 
whether the organizers' hearts are in the right place.  
 
> personally, i want to do community projects. i believe it is possible to

Some people want to participate more than others.  The question here is:
Can a community be sustained and nurtured by a minority of highly-
motivated participants, or must a "true" community always consist of 
equally motivated participants?   

> i believe that community events require
> the informed consent of everyone, with willing participation in the often
> tumultuous process of organizing and executing the event.

This is the ideal.  And sometimes it *can* happen this way, and when it
does, nothing can compare to the shared vibe that emerges.

I also think that think communities need leadership sometimes, and ideally, 
community-focused leaders act on their ability to empathize with a shared
vision of their community.  Not an easy task.  On the other hand, would 
you want to have to take some kind of vote before making each decision 
associated with organizing an event?

> and, i believe
> that a community-oriented rave can be done without charging money at the

Ultimately, it is the non-profit, non-ego motivated projects which define
the heart of *any* community.  My feeling is that parties like Liquid Air,
In The Light, Blue Cube, Connections, MESS, Home, YSH, Launch Pad... will 
always be the heart and soul of the rave scene here; breeding grounds for 
the spirit of our community.  I also like to believe that this spirit can 
bubble up into the other more product-focused activities that go on around
us; that we can bring the spirit forged in these "family" parties to the 
less communally-focused aspects of the scene.  Ideally, there can be a 
kind of synergy between the underground and aboveground.  But yes, without 
the grassroots support from community-minded participants, the scene will 
surely die.

I remain optimistic, that many people *want* a sense of community in 
the rave scene, and will support and participate in events that at least
*try* to be community based.  I agree that removing the profiteer/consumer 
element from such events is crucial.  If enough people just donate what 
they are comfortable with, whether it be making a financial contribution,
or just showing up and sharing some positive energy, then our community 
will flourish.

Hey!  Don't make fun of hotel soap!  I personally live off the stuff.  
Much cheaper than buying your own.  
I think we should take up a soap collection and donate those little bars
to the homeless.  It would be a mutually beneficial relationship.  
Finally those little soap bars would actually belong somewhere.

hi folx,
os i went to the RAW event on fri. at the back of dv8. well, the musick
was pretty good, tho the flow of musical genres was just so so. the
people there were ok but no into dancing long times. plust i kept on
getitng bumped, tho there was PLENTY of room. this was the 3rd floor,
room 1, whihc had kinda housey flavour. then there was an ambient room,
wiht acid-jazzy stuff. that was good, plus it had ventilation! but
again, not enuff people were dancing - i guess people were just talking
on hanging out. so we went donw stairs to 2nd floor to room #3, which had
more of a raVEY feel and crowd. the musick was good, there were enuff people
unfortunately, my friend had to go home - lack of sleep the night before-
so we left around 4 .
i tried to go to liquid air , but never got thru. i heard it got busted.
is that tru ? have not seen any reports as of yet.
then on sun. i  met up with lee fogel at light-n-up. the musick was
GREAT, two rooms, one darker, harder stuff, the big room, bright, airy
jazzy, mellower, sorta like boogie buffet II . not enuff people know of this
tho' ! good sunday afternoon stuff (it's 9am-5pm).

it's true that not all aspects of Liquid Air nor In The Light are put to
a vote.  Then again, I've discussed many aspects of the events i've helped
organize with quite a few people.  In the case of the events i've helped
organize, i'm always open to suggestions and amendments (and perhaps i 
haven't made that clear to everyone).  I would hope, for instance, that
if i decided to name an event some outrageous thing (e.g. Kill John Doe),
that cooler heads would prevail, someone would have words with me, and 
that i'd fix it.  As for other important aspects, i *have* opened it up
for community discussion, and made quite a few adjustments.  I understand
your main point, and it's a valid one that must be taken into consideration.
At the same time, certain things *can* be left to a few people, *iff* those
people have the trust of the greater community, and also have their ears
to the ground.

yes, leaders/organizers *will* and *should* be questioned constantly. and
if i am on an ego trip, and don't realize it, i should be pulled down of
my pedestal (as should anyone).

> 
> Some people want to participate more than others.  The question here is:

i believe that the real center of the matter is the definition of "equally
motivated".  one of the problems with the model of community energized by
a few is that even if the few have the best interests of all as their
motivation, they will eventually burn out.  this is why i believe that
the model of a substantially larger group given the opportunity to participate
in some smaller way will lead to events that are "funner" for everyone. it
also helps guard against the ego/elitism problems of small groups.  further,
it ensures momentum once a project is undertaken, since no single person is
"indispensable".

one of the issues that is related to this is the frequency of events.  if
the broader based model i am proposing is used, it seems to me that the
frequency of events will decrease, since it usually takes more time to
make decisions than if fewer people are engaged in the process.  this is
OK with me.  i am certainly happy to trade more involvement of more people
for fewer events.  

> On the other hand, would 
> you want to have to take some kind of vote before making each decision 
> associated with organizing an event?
> 
if that's what it takes, and people want to participate at that level,
i'll do it.  even with events that other people are organizing, i still
reserve the right to try and get them to change certain things that i may
disagree with (e.g. event name, DJ selection, door policy, sound stuff,
vibe stuff, even fog stuff).  i hope that others take the same approach.

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

"Anthem or I left my legs.......

in San Francisco. I went of "Anthem"  on Saturday and it turned out to be a
great party for me. First, the 19th street warehouse was a fresh space,
roomy, and not your usual sweat-box. I could always find room to dance, with
few annoying "drive-by" walkers, or  newly budding tree-stumps planting
themselves in front of you.

Rick Preston invited me, and put me on the DJ list, so it was my first "go to
the head of the class experience." I really loved this 18 and over party. I
admit I normally am more within my age comfort zone at the over 21 parties,
but this party brought that arbitrary self-inflicted obstacle down a bit
more.

Wiliam Blake said that "energy delights in energy," and like so many things
Blake said, I didn't understand it when I read it. However, after seeing so
many crazy-legged ravers hopping around like repossessed demons, I think I do
now. I am just astonished by the seeming boundless energy and abandonment 
the younger ravers dance with. And, they can dance with that same 
high-octane intensity they did earlier in the evening. I staggered out of the
party at six, my legs now weighing about 100 lbs a piece. 

I had another of my bathroom experiences. I walk into the bathroom, a 6'4"
grey-haired guy, obviously from adultland. Some guys get that scared-rabbit,
or am I gonna get busted by a narc look, for I have temporarily interupted
some low-level contraband exchanges. I just said "Peace, little ravers," and
walked over to the urinal.

The sound system was sufficent to blast my head off. Carlos, Thomas, and Jeno
in the main room. (By the by, exactly which planet is Jeno visiting us from
anyway?)  Markie (another space alien in my opinion) Spun, and Rick Preston
played the smaller room.

Rick played the 4 to 6 slot, so I was scheduled for a "they shot horses don't
they?"  all night dance rav-a-thon. Lucky Me!!!!!By the time 5 rolled around,
all the artifical enthusiasms or enchancements couldn't coagulate the rubber
in my legs. 

I made a night of it, rented a room on 7th street,  and slept from 7-1. I got
up, and oozed on over to 1015 at 2:00. I wanted to see if I could meet Lee
Fogel and some other SFravers. Aaron and Crunch said, he was around but  by
this time I was having difficulty getting my Irish coffee to my lips, and I
still had the two hour drive south to Monterey. So, I stuck in an ambient
tape, told my little pony which way to go, (but it knows the way by now) and
drove home. Thanks again SF. See ya "in the Light," or down the road.

For some reason, the line seemed perpetually busy, but Laura posted 
instructions on how to get directions elsewhere.  The orignal location did 
get busted, so the party moved to some other place which was cool (in 
vibe and temperature).  It was small and house-partyish.  I had quite a 
good time as it has been *months* since I've danced around to good music 
(the essence of raving, no?).

All the best laid plans of mice and men etc etc . . . .

I don't know what fly-by-night voice mail service ( :-) ) Bryce
subscribes to, but wouldn't you know it the ONE day out of the
month that he REALLY needs it to work it goes down and no one
in the customer service office can do anything about it becuase
it's a weekend.

We did the best we could spreading the word carefully through
electronic channels, unfortunately not everyone logs on during
the weekend so they missed my message saying that if you needed
directions finger my account at soda.  Of course, for some
reason a machine at cal-poly decided to have some mail problems
Saturday, too, so that meant anyone on sfraves with an .edu
address didn't get the message until way too late due to the 
delay cal-poly injected into the message delivery process.

Oy vey, the net.

Anyway, Brian and I made our way to the site around 11:30, and
arrived to find Ethan, Lee An, and Bryce putting the last touches
on the sound setup.  Lee got started soon after, and people started
arriving.  We danced our butts off until about 1:30, when a patrolling
Golden Gate park ranger found us and told us we weren't supposed to be 
there and that we should leave.  So we did, going to the never fail
"Launch Pad" site.

Usually, when a party gets busted and moved, it loses people.  Well,
luck smiled upon us and the party gained over a dozen people during
the move.  All told there were about 45 people in the course of 
the night, dancing up a storm.  

Lee An played a great set (would we expect anything less of him?) and
I danced so hard I had to sit out most of the rest of the party.
Next came Ethan, giving us an acid groove ranging from smooth and
floaty (i.e. the recent Hexagone release on DJAX) to rather dark and
hard ("Laura" music, if you will :-) ).  Joe Rice ended the night on
a funky note, and at 4:30 (amid a picnic provided by Adam, Batya,
and other people with food) we loaded the ENTIRE sound system into
Bryce's little tiny Geo Metro and called it quits.

It was a great night.  Some kids who encountered us in the Park though
we might be Satan Worshippers due to the candles that had been set
out delineating the dance area.

Anyway, if you missed us don't worry, we'll be at it again.  Bryce
didn't just buy a highly mobile sound system to have it sit in his
garage all summer!

Heh, I think I know who you are now.  I remember the first time I saw you, 
at a Wicked a few months ago;  I turned to Janie and said, "That guy looks 
too much like a narc to actually *be* a narc."  So we shrugged our
shoulders and just figured that you were a curiosity-seeker of some sort.
Since then, we've started noticing you almost *everywhere*.  When we saw 
you sitting on the stage at Light-n Up yesterday, I turned to Janie and 
said, "There he is again.  He *really is* into it."  Well, cool.  I'll 
introduce myself to you next time.  :-)

Did you all here!  MaryJane's a free girl in Germany.  The German Supreme
Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to put people in jail for under
5 grams of marijuana or hash when alcohol and cigarettes are legal.  It's
not just decriminialized like in Holland but legal.  Possesion of < 5g or
trafficking are still illegal though.

i agree with most of the original post. i'd like to share some 
experiences i had with an event i/we threw here in raleigh (NC) last friday.

we used a site that we found that was outdoors. the site was on private 
property, but was just a fairly large tract of land that was being 
cleared but was not being used. 

we charged $5 a head for admission, but many people came in for less if 
they had no money or were just uncooperative. i felt more inclined to let 
them be dicks about it than try and make them leave. (the people that 
were broke weren't dicks, just the uncooperative ones :)

we had one incident where some of the local skaters just decided to come 
in and harrass people, ie some people were dancing with glo-sticks and they 
just sat there and hassled them. they hadn't paid either. i went to talk 
to them to try and work out an agreement and our conversation went 
somewhat like this:

'if you guys are gonna stay, we'd appreciate it if you put in $5 to help 
cover the cost of equipment and dj's gas money' 

'well, we're here, and we're not gonna pay. this isn't your land. we 
would have come out here anyway [bullshit, no one knew about that site]'

'it's very hard to do things that way. i fronted the money for the all 
the equipment so that people could have a good time, i can't afford to 
pay for it all myself though.'

'well, you paid for it. why should we? i don't care if you lose money'

'thanks a lot'

'fuck you'

'thanks. enjoy the party.' and i leave. as i'm walking away they yell, 

'why don't you turn it up?'


so you see, not everyone in a community is going to help out. if you ask 
me, not everyone deserves to be in the community.

other than that, the party went well. we broke even. had exactly enough 
money to pay for the equipment and buy breakfast for everyone who helped 
out, and had a great time. money did change hands, but no profit was 
made. 

the only problem is, i'm a student. i have bills to pay, and organizing 
that party to a lot of time. i can't afford to throw 'free' parties and 
support myself. parties like that can only reasonably be organised by 
people with free time and no financial worries. i'm not sure wether i 
could keep a bunch of money if i made it from a rave, but i'm sure i 
could convince myself to. 

shit, i don't even know what my point was. well, that's my story :)

random things that pop into my head, like usual

DJs and Dancers...

while at any given moment in time DURING a party,
i think that people in attendance are providing
just as much as the DJ

in a more historical context,
the DJ has put out a lot of money to get the music,
and has (hopefully) spent time finding the best music to play

while a Dancer is just doing that,
MAYBE they put money and time into a more interesting outfit
MAYBE they brought food or water that they are handing out

but i doubt that even if they do both, they could have put in as much
time and money as the DJ

things that make this invalid:
DJ's who get all their records for free
DJ's who do all their practicing while performing
DJ's who play the same 5 year old records over and over

but i doubt these make up the majority of DJs

AND

i dont think raves are a community project

there are definitely parties and promoters who want to offer something
for the community, BUT there are also lots of people
who want to just go out and have fun

i personally dont mind putting in some effort into a party that i am not
paying for and someone else is
OR i can put in some money so they arent paying as much

BUT the method i like the most is where i throw a party and you get in for free
and then you throw a party and i get in for free
(free = not havign any commitment of doing something)
that way, i can enjoy myself and you can enjoy yourself
and we dont both have to be worrying about everything all the time

I, like Bob, wanted this thread to die, but I had to point out something
funny in his last letter:

> >My experience with frat boys indicates that frat guys make great
> >friends but terrible boyfriends.  Hangin out with them is cool, dating
> >them is not.  I keep the boundary quite clear.
> 
> substitute "gays" or "blacks" for "frat boys" and you'll see what i

OK, imagine she had said:

> My experience with gays indicates that gays make great friends but
> terrible boyfriends. Hanging out with them is cool, dating them is
> not. I keep the boundary quite clear.

I don't know about you, but my response wouldn't be "That bigot!" It'd
be more like, "Well, duh!" (although hopefully a bit more witty).

I think it's perfectly OK for girls to discriminate against homosexuals
by not dating them, and I think all (male) homosexuals would agree.

I personally draw a similar line--I will be friends with frat boys, but
I will not date them. But maybe that's just because I'm straight....

My experience last summer was Qmart.  A few friends and I decided that
people needed more access to cheaper 'supplies' at raves after being
charged four dollars for a bottle of water at Mister Rogers (in SF).  So at
the next Full Moon we brought candy and water (bottled) and proceeded to
sell the water for a dolar a bottle and give away free candy.  It was my
first Full Moon so I hadn't quite 'got it' yet.  I realized what it was
really supposed to be about and at the July 4th FMR we did a bigger and
better Qmart where we changed our approach a little bit.  We gave
everything for free and just asked for donations to help defray our costs.
I think we got almost a hundred dollars in donations (someone gave us three
dollars for a blow pop cause he was so impressed), without any signs up
around us , or even trying that hard.  In the mornig I handed out oranges,
donuts, and cinnamon rolls and just loved seeing the smiles on peoples
faces.  I just recently met a girl at my school (U of Oregon) who I gave a
cinnamon roll too at Bonny Doon one morning (Fresh Start 6/93) and to know
that I made one person happy was my goal.  I guess what I'm trying to get
around to is the fact that I was hoping to spur a lot more sharing.  I came
to school and don't know if I had any real positive effectsbut what do you
guys see in San Francisco.  I've made myself think about how we can make
people realize they can be an active part of the community.  I feel active
because I'm giving (matierally but in  a way of myself/time) and I assume
they feel active because they are receiving but how to show people the joys
of both.  Hope this paragraph made some sense.

>things that make this invalid:

There are DJ's that get free records!  How?!

One of my things is that I always try to give five bucks at free parties if
I have it so that the people have something to help them throw the next
party.

>BUT the method i like the most is where i throw a party and you get in for free
>and then you throw a party and i get in for free

What does 'doing something' mean?  Doing Something might be dancing or
being nice or bringing  some water to share...

I think we should remember that while the DJ spends money and time on
records, when the event is over the DJ gets to keep the records and
take them home and play them at leisure. Yes, the DJ pays extra, but
the DJ gets extra, too. 

I don't think they should be paid any more than anyone else at the
party. Cleaning up after a party is NOT fun. Lugging a ton of PA
equipment up stairs is NOT fun. Working door while the party inside
goes off is NOT fun. Sometimes I see too much emphasis placed on the
DJs, and not enough on everything else that makes it work. The party
is fun not because DJ so-n-so played these records in this sequence,
it is fun because everyone made it fun.

True. but they get hella worn quick.  If you're into fidelity you
don't want to listen to stuff played 13 times on a 1200 with the
stylus pressure cranked up to 5g and you don't have time to clean them
before or after playing.  Click, pop, no high frequencies!

	Yeah, but anyone without a major back injury can clean up, lug
PA equipment, or work door.  Not everyone has the skills or the wax to
DJ, and not everyone can front the green crimp-cut for the space
and/or PA.  Pay people what you think they're worth, and see who shows.
It's a self-selecting process.

	Still, though, "who's there" is very important -- thus the
emphasis on who's throwing the party.  If SoundVision or MESS are
hosting, I can expect a certain group and 'vibe'.  If Wicked are
hosting, I can expect a different group and vibe.  And so it goes, and
so I go.  Do what you like; maybe it'll go off, and maybe not.

True, but they still get to keep them and to play them at home. The DJ
pays, the DJ gets decks and records at home. The rest of the people do
not.

How about paying equally?

I enjoy giving out food, water, and candy to people but it does get a bit 
expensive even if I do shop at Costco.  It would be very cool to get a 
discount admission for bringing in stuff that I'm going to share with 
people.  This would encourage people to bring stuff to share.

is it really legal?  Everyone thinks it's decriminalized in Holland but
it's NOT!  It's tolerated and that's a bit different.  Sure all the

decided to make an issue of it.  One coffeehouse in particular had to
remove its menu when I was there in '91 because it was publicly displayed.
I mean, you can walk up to a cop and ask her or him to light your
spliff/joint whatever but that doesn't mean it's legal.  That is, unless
things have changed recently in Holland that I don't know about.  If
Germany has gone ahead and done this, I wonder how it's going to affect the
European Community when it decides to unite even further.  Will the rest of
Europe adopt this policy?

An Overview of Trance Theory

Introduction

Trance is a controversial subject.  Over the past several decades
researchers in hypnosis have failed to agree on the nature of trance.
Only recently has there been the recognition that trance is probably a
common and natural phenomenon.  "Trance" is also a popular music
style.

Trance Theory is a theoretical model for trance which embraces most
prior definitions of trance such as hypnosis and yogic meditative
trance but also includes phenomena which previously were not
consistently recognized as being part of the trance phenomena, such as
addiction but including, even, trance music.
  
Trance Theory is a systems analysis of states of consciousness, which,
for reasons of rigor and unambiguity, is expressed mathematically.
However, the theory itself has been developed by a deep self-analysis
of states of meditation and addiction but expressed as a system.  No
prior work has been found which attempted to explain trance in this
unique way.  Trance theory has nothing to do with other theories of
consciousness or approaches such as found in the studies of social
psychologists, neo-dissociative studies or cognitive behavioralists.
Although the present theory is based on an approach which did not begin
with the idea to explain what a trance is, an explanation for trance is
both a side-benefit and the name of the theory.


While the approach is specifically oriented towards computers and
systems the inspiration for the approach came from the experience of
nearly thirty years of meditation practice as well as professional
involvement in computer systems analysis.  The inspiration of
meditation was applied to systems analysis and the precision of systems
analysis was applied to the meditation experience.  Although the models
of NLP and Eriksonian hypnosis are well-known, Trance Theory explains
NLP and Eriksonian hypnosis in a new way.  It was actually during an
attempt to model technological addiction (Technophiliacs) that the idea
to attempt a specific approach to modelling trance occurred.  Addiction
seemed to be a type of pathological trance.  Certain social and
psychological problems can be seen as manifestations of pathological
forms of trance.  It appears that many current social and institutional
problems we see in the world have elements of pathological trances.  By
understanding how trance works, it may be possible to attack these
problems at their cause.

Further research is needed to delineate in a more precise manner the
social and psychological implications of the model.  However, the model
seems robust enough to form a reasonable basis for further
experimentation and research in social and psychological areas.

The Importance of Trance

Trance states are present in many forms.  There are also pathological
trance states.  Some pathological trances give rise to addictions of
all sorts, including drug, alcohol, TV, work and sex/love addictions.
Trances have characteristics which are manifested in all addictions.
Wier's theories on trance have implications for solving the "drug
problem," as well as "work addiction" problems in businesses and
institutions.  However, further work needs to be done before there is
anything like a trance therapy.  There are ways to transform
pathological trance states to something more like an "awake" state of
mind.  Trance terminating is something we can do.  We can learn it and
we can teach it.  But first people must know how to recognize
pathological trance states.


Some trance states have given rise to hierarchical organizations in
business, government and military organization.  These trances may be
at the root of environmental damage and have other social effects not
usually recognized as being based on "a trance."  Wier's studies show
this relationship.  Recognizing and terminating trance will result in
new forms of social organization.  Some of these new forms are already
present in networks, but most people do not understand the nature of
these networks and how they are related to trance.  For example, while
women's movements are manifesting opposition to certain pathological
trances the methods being used to terminate the trances are not the
effective ones.  Trance Theory can explain what the effective methods
could be, as an example.  The following is a simplified overview of
Trance Theory.  Further details are available from the Institute.

What is Trance Theory?

Trance Theory is a new theory which precisely defines human trance and
includes practical ways to measure, analyze and design hypnotic, dream
states, altered states of consciousness, meditation, as well as the
pathological forms of trance such as addictive and psychotic states.
Trance Theory does not fit exactly into neodissociative,
social-psychological or cognitive behavioral theories, but spans and
impacts them all.  Because Trance Theory is a new approach or new point
of view, it is not yet found an academic forum.

Ordinary Thoughts and The Cognitive Plane

Ordinary thoughts are impulses in the brain which reflect in some sense
the processes and sensations that occur in the body.  No restrictions
are placed on what a thought is nor what a sense is.  The Cognitive
Plane is the theoretical plane of awareness which is derived from
ordinary thought impulses.

Generating Cognitive Loops

In certain cases thoughts repeat in loop patterns.  These looping
patterns are important for learning and abstraction.  The looping
patterns of awareness generate secondary awareness planes which for the
most part lie coincident to and within the cognitive plane.  Generating
cognitive loops do not need to be verbal thoughts.  Some loops are
mantras, drumming, pacing and leading for an hypnotic induction, the
stimulus and response of television viewing and addictive behavior.
The content of the loop is not a factor in generating secondary
awareness planes.  The critical aspect is the repeating pattern which
is the necessary and sufficient condition.  Generating cognitive loops
are not particularly easy to discover in specific cases, but
discovering them are critically important to understand the nature of a
specific trance.

The Dissociated Plane

With increasing number of times a loop is repeated, as well as other
conditions, these secondary awareness planes may split off or
dissociate from the cognitive plane.  This is quite normal and happens
when something is 'learned'.  It is the normal 'multi-processing'
aspect of thinking.  In this process, for energy conservation reasons,
some cognitive functions are disabled.  The resulting awareness when
these cognitive functions are disabled has been characterized as trance
awareness, and this is defined as the 'dissociated plane.'

Trance

When the number and strengths of the dissociated planes exceeds that of
the primary cognitive awareness plane, the sense of self, the "I",
switches to the dissociated plane, which is commonly called a trance
state.  Some cognitive functions when disabled exhibit 'trance logic'.
  
Trance Logic

Trance logic occurs only because it is more efficient, energy-wise, to
disable some cognitive functions to perform tasks that are in the
dissociated plane.

Characteristics of trance logic include the following:  disabling of
judgment, time distortion, disabling or limiting of volition, decrease
of body awareness, motor inhibition, perceptual distortions, memory
distortions, increase in hallucinations, more intense ideodynamic
processes, absorbtion, inability to perform some cognitive functions
and increased ability to perform other cognitive functions.  For
example, some people may be incapable of performing mathematical
calculations while in trance, but others perform mathematical
calculations unusually well.
  

Sensation and Mentation

Sensations and mentations which occur in trance may occur either from
external stimulation (voice, images which are seen, sensations which
are felt by the body) or from internal stimulation (memories, voices,
visions, feelings and emotions).  These sensations may occur in either
the cognitive plane or in the dissociated plane, and combinations give
rise to four types of trance.

The Four Types of Trance

The first type of trance is described by a generating loop in the
cognitive plane with external stimulation which is perceived from the
dissociated plane.  Television viewing, movies, driving a car, playing
a drum are activities which are examples of this type of trance.

The second type of trance is described by a generating loop in the
cognitive plane with internal stimulation which is perceived from the
dissociated plane.  Meditation, mantra and inner visualizations are
examples of this type of trance.

The third type of trance is described by a generating loop in the
dissociated plane with an external stimulation which perceived from the
dissociated plane.  Addictions are characteristic of this type of
trance.

The fourth type of trance can be described as a generating loop in the
dissociated plane with an internal stimulation which is perceived from
the dissociated plane.  Psychosis are characteristic of this type of
trance.
 
Terminating a Trance

Because trances may be created without knowledge or intent, it is
critical to understand the detailed mechanics of trance and to discover
specifically what trances are enabled in an individual.  Trances may be
terminated or replaced with other trances either with or without the
permission or knowledge of the subject.  Social responsibility concerns
raise the hope that pathological trances would always be replaced with
more benign trances.  Most therapies intend to replace pathological
trances with more benign trances.  The ostensible goal of spiritual
consciousness raising activities is to terminate trances, but often
only trance replacement occurs.  In the worst cases benign trances can
become pathological but with the label 'spiritual.'

Trance Analysis: A New Method of Analysis

Trance analysis is no different, fundamentally, from any other kind of
analysis.  The goal is to take presenting symptoms or conditions and to
try to discover and expose the patterns.  Of course, in order to
discover a pattern, you need a model.  Without a model, there will be
nothing to distinguish the patterns from the chaos.

Trance is a condition for which no good model really existed up until
now.  Of course there were to behaviorists and psychologists who could
define trance in a very loose way in terms of social psychology or
'belief' systems or 'compliance' or a 'narrowing of attention' or
dissociation and other terms, but these terms were very vaguely
described and often not defined in a way which could be used in a
precise analytical way.
 
The only reason why we call this Trance analysis is that we use a model
for trance called Trance Theory.
  
Because there is a model for trance, it is possible to examine any
situation and see if there are the elements of trance present.  If so,
then a trance is present.  If a trance exist, then the theory says that
certain mental conditions will be present with certain
characteristics.  As Trance Theory evolves there will be measures on
these characteristics and such measures will give absolute diagnostic
indications which may have therapeutic value.

For example, although NLP is controversial with its modalities and
submodalities, such clues as where the eyes are as indicating access to
visual past or constructive visual, are similar to possible future
measures in Trance Theory.

Addictions, meditation, nationalism, spirituality all are different
enough but all share one thing:  they are all indicative of a trance.
So we can analyze them.  We can look for Generating Cognitive Loops,
Dissociated Latent Planes, and we can count loop content and we can try
to enumerate and describe the DLPs that these loops create.  We also
know that DLPs cause disabling of certain cognitive functions.  Which
ones?  We know that when DLPs are present, cognition can function in
strange ways.  For example, not everyone will hallucinate simply
because a DLP is present.  Sometimes a lessening of body awareness is
more important.  Sometimes a disabling of memory function is more
important.  Whatever is the particular result of the DLP, it is
important to associate the GCL with the DLP and the disabled cognitive
functions.

A trance analyst will attempt to discover the GCLs and DLPs and the
disabled cognitive functions.

You may notice that a trance analyst does 'similar' things as a
psychotherapist or psychoanalyst except that the model is different.  A
Freudian may look for polymorphous perversities, dysfunctional libidos
or Oedipus Complexes, and a Jungian might look for archetypes as models
for pathological behaviors.  But a trance analyst looks for
characteristic mental processing which creates trance.  Why is trance
important?  Trance causes a selective disabling of cognitive functions
in such a way that a robust variety of behavior can be seen and
explained from the very normal to the very abnormal and even the super
normal.

For this reason, the reinterpreting of human behavior from the point of
Trance analysis promises to give a rich dividend in terms of explaining
what is sick and what is healthy behavior.

For now, we don't know what addictions are sick and what addictions are
healthy.  A drug addict is sick, but what if that drug is coffee?  Or
vitamins?  Is performance addiction always sick?  What if the addiction
is to become a perfect Olympic downhill skier?  Or a perfect banker?
Or a perfect assassin?  Or a perfect sharpshooter?  Is a Florence
Nightingale sick or a national heroine?  Are national heroes
characteristic of pathological trances?  Do we need nationalistic
trances or not?  If what we do is governed by our social trances
instilled in us when we were very young, which of those social trances
are sick and which are not?

How can we really judge between social trances from different
cultures?  Trance analysis gives the possibility to expose the actual
mechanism of specific trances.  In doing so, it may be possible in the
future to answer these questions without resorting to moral or ethical
judgements.  What we do come face to face with, however, is the
philosophical problem of chaos.  It is trance which keeps us from this
fear.  If we destroy all of our trances, we will again be faced with
this chaos.  It is no wonder that religions and nationalistic movements
and drug addictions exist in the world.
 
Trance analysts can show us if specific trances are actually the ones
we want.  Or not.  The problem with being in a trance is that we cannot
make clear judgements as to if and when we want to get out of our
trances.  It is only when we know what our trances are and how these
trances affect our behavior and our sense of the world that we can
decide if these trances really serve our best interests.

In this final sense, a trance analyst is no different than any other
analyst, just more precise, and probably a bit more 21st century.


Designing Trances

Once trances are fully understood, it becomes possible to design a
trance by intent.  This implies that it is possible to methodically
design dreams, Altered States of Consciousness and addictions in such a
way that they cannot be resisted.  Successful religious and political
movements have stumbled on ways to design addictive trances without the
benefits of a study such as Trance Theory.  Trance Theory implies a
potential for more addictive religious or political trances while at
the same time showing how to avoid such trances and how to break them.
  
Continuing Research

Trance Theory has important implications in the following new areas:
Applying trance creatively.  
New-age trance, electronic states.  
Rediscovering shamanistic and yogic trance states.  
Implications for environment, society  and technology.  
Further studies on the nature of information.

The Trance Institute Activities

Publications

There is currently no known specific academic forum for this research.
Unless an already existing forum is discovered, the Institute will
publish its own findings.

The Institute currently publishes various pamphlets on the subject of
trance.
 
A Systems Paradigm For Trance

A Systems Paradigm For Trance describes Trance Theory.  It is now
available for $20.00 from the Institute.

Count Your Trances  

An article to introduce the concepts of pathological trance and to make
the connection with addictions.  This article was published in the
Winter, 1993, issue of The Quest magazine and does not represent the
current state of Trance Theory.  Reprint: $5.-

The International Trance Journal

The Institute will soon publish (July, 1994) a research periodical
called The International Trance Journal.  The readership of the Journal
will be professional trance analysts and trance designers or those who
are in mental health fields interested in technical research questions
involving trance in both technical and clinical situations.
Subscription: $50.- per annum (4 issues).  Papers may be submitted for
publication.  Write/email for guidelines.

Trance Courses

The Institute offers courses on trance to hypnotists, therapists, sales
personnel, managers, advertisers, musicians, fantasy makers, meditation
teachers, shamans, yogis, witches and spiritual seekers, all of whom
are interested in trance.  Courses teach the theoretical and practical
aspects of trance.  The various types of trance are demonstrated and
the attendee can experience them all.

It is important to realize that there are four types of trance only one
of which is hypnotic trance.  The Trance Institute studies them all.
Trance creation, design, analysis as well as trance termination are all
very important to the complete understanding of trance.

Trance termination courses are offered to therapists and addiction
counselors.  Special trance instructor courses are available for
professionals interested in becoming deeper involved in the activities
of the Institute.

Music and Dance Trance

Music and Dance are traditional ways light trance has been
experienced.  These ways do not require television, drugs or other
aids.  In this course we explore techniques for causing trance,
techniques for deepening trance.  Some traditional ways of trance such
as Sufi Dervish dancing will be demonstrated analyzed.

Trance Deepening Techniques

Light trances are common.  Ways to deepen trance are not so well
known.  This course examines deep trances and analyzes the causes of
deep trance.  Techniques for deepening trance are explored.  There will
be instructor-led deep trances.

Professional Development Workshop

Hypnotherapists and other professionals can learn precise ways to
deepen trance in their patients.  A variety of techniques will be
examined in detail.  The purpose is to give the professional an
in-depth appreciation of trance and to improve their skills in both
inducing trance as well as terminating trance!    This special course
will teach the theoretical and practical aspects of trance.  Various
types of trance will be demonstrated and the attendee can experience
them all.  In this course we explore techniques for causing trance,
techniques for deepening trance.  Light trances are common.  Ways to
deepen trance are not so well known.  This course examines deep trances
and analyzes the causes of deep trance.  Techniques for deepening
trance are explored.  There will be instructor-led deep trances.  This
special course is for professionals in the mental health field who work
with addictions of all sorts:  drug, alcohol. sex and love, are
covered.

Introductory Trance Theory

This introductory course in trance theory is for those with no need to
have a precision model of trance, but who wish to understand how trance
affects everyday life, how trances are introduced without our
permission, how a trance can be recognized and how it can be
terminated.

Advanced Trance Theory

For those handful of people who wish to have a precision understanding
of trance theory, this course is designed to give you everything you
need to understand and use trance theory.

Teacher Training Courses

Special trance instructor courses are available for professionals
interested in becoming deeper involved in the activities of the
Institute.

Addiction  

What is addiction?  The pathological trance.  Pacing without
co-dependency.  Drug switching.  Expanding options.

Trance  

Types of trances:  hypnotic, meditative, pathological, unconscious.
How unconscious trances are induced.  Characteristics of the trance
state.  Breaking a trance.

New Social Organizations  

Why communication patterns are more important than what they say.  How
pathological information moves.  How healthy information moves.
Training ourselves to recognize pathological information patterns.
Transforming the structure of communication in our lives.  How social
organizations can be healthier.  Implications for government, military,
business and family.

Personal Trance Analysis

The Institute will offer professional in-depth personal trance analysis
to individuals who wish to explore the foundations of their trances.
Trance analysis is not a substitute for psychotherapy or other
psychoanalytic treatments, but provides the individual a rich and
detailed set of practical information which can deepen an individual's
personal understandings.  For persons practicing meditation,
shamanistic trance, wicca, etc., a deeper understanding of trance
theory and techniques can make the trance experience more effective.
 
Barriers impeding trance or changing trance in undesirable ways can
also be removed through in-depth trance analysis.

Trance Design Consultants

The Institute will offer consultants in trance on an hourly or retainer
basis.  Trance consultants will be trained by the Institute in the
theoretical and practical aspects of trance analysis and design.  They
will be fully capable to help analyze specific situations and to design
and implement trances for specific purposes.  The trances produced can
be useful in various social and psychological settings.  Trance
consultants are particularly useful for evaluating and testing
commercial products such as music, video, etc. for various
entertainment, training or behavioral purposes.

	Thanks to Rocky,

	for posting this article.  This is a subject that I'm pretty much
	interested in.  I've been aware that there are various stages to
	the levels of consciousness that we/I go through at a good party.
	I also have known for a long time that some people are attracted/
	susecptible to various types of paries because of the quality or
	nature of the DLPs generated (DLPs are what make a WICKED a WICKED
	and not some other party that has Jeno,Markie,Garth and Thomas spinning)
	I think we can all recognize that the Music itself is a powerful
	source of GCL.  An experienced DJ like Markie is someone who
	(either consciously or not) is addept at using GCL or at least the
	GCLs of the music (coupled in some cases with visuals) to induce
	or set up appropriate DLPs.

	I'll at least send the Trance Institute my $20 for the first book.
	I don't know how "new" this stuff is, seems like I ran across alot
	of this kind of thinking in some of Charles Tart's essays and books.

And prompts me to ask - how was it?
Did anyone go?
Did I read about it and forget already?
Did the discount for "fabulousness" work to get people dressed up?
It seemed like a great idea to me.
Were there any truly memorable, original, great (pick adjective) outfits?

Have a fabulous day,

is it really legal?  Everyone thinks it's decriminalized in Holland but
it's NOT!  It's tolerated and that's a bit different.  Sure all the
coffeehouses sell but they can still get in trouble with the police if they
decided to make an issue of it.  One coffeehouse in particular had to
remove its menu when I was there in '91 because it was publicly displayed.
I mean, you can walk up to a cop and ask her or him to light your
spliff/joint whatever but that doesn't mean it's legal.  That is, unless
things have changed recently in Holland that I don't know about.  If
Germany has gone ahead and done this, I wonder how it's going to affect the
European Community when it decides to unite even further.  Will the rest of
Europe adopt this policy?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, actualy it is decriminalized in Holland and everyone thinks it's legal
but it's not.  The word decriminalized doesn't mean legal.  That's why
they use that word in refference to Holland because it's not legal, the
police just don't actively pursue arrest - decriminalized.

Trance is a controversial topic.  Therefore I disagree with a lot of stuff 
written in that article about trance.

>anything like a trance therapy.  There are ways to transform
>pathological trance states to something more like an "awake" state of
>mind.  Trance terminating is something we can do.  We can learn it and
>we can teach it.  But first people must know how to recognize
>pathological trance states.

sure, but why terminate a trance state?  I think we are trancing all the time
but our consciousness is too demanding to allow many of us to trance on 
command.  I feel like the word, "trance" used in the paragraph above should
be renamed something like "awareness blinders".  Sure if a soldier is 
psycholocially broken down and then rebuilt by the military frame of thinking
and then s/he becomes a robot following ANY orders from "superiors", he
may be in a "trance" state.  I would call it awareness-narrowing.  If that
same soldier actually tranced then that human might no longer wish to be a 
human robot.

In my opinion, more people should get in touch with their trance states AS
WELL AS opening up their awareness boundaries.  Trancing is nothing to be
feared.  Whoever wrote that article on trancing has systemized, academized,
and tried to categorize it.......why not just enjoy it?

>trances with more benign trances.  The ostensible goal of spiritual
>consciousness raising activities is to terminate trances, but often
>only trance replacement occurs.  In the worst cases benign trances can
>become pathological but with the label 'spiritual.'

I completely disagree with this.  In my opinion, spiritual consciousness
raising should increase one's awareness of all-that-is.  Trancing is a doorway
to accessing the state of all-that-is.  I think that the author of the article
is personally bent against trancing and how dare he talk for everybody else
by saying that the "ostensible goal of spiritual consciousness raising
activities is to terminate trances"  He must be using a definition for trancing
that is very different from the one used on sfraves lately or else in my
humble opinion, he's overflowing with b.s.

Thanks to all who came down to the Impact Lighting Demo on Friday. It 
went very well. 

PURE is hosting a Cinco De Mayo party on Thursday at DNA, 375 11th. St. , 
S.F. 21+ D.J.'s are Carlos Locos, Jalapeno Jeno, and El Spun. 12 midnight 
to 6 a.m. 415.267.0640  Hope ya'll can come and if you do look for me , 
the Lady on Crutches, though I did groove on the dancefloor at light-n-up 
on Sunday without them... Therapy ;-)

After light-n-up on Sundays, 1015 is hosting a type of Tea dance. I can't 
remember the name but is was great fun from 6 pm - 1 am. The crowd was 
primarily gay, and everyone was really nice and happy and the dj's were 
great! So come check it out sometime! The gays really know how to have a 
good time and if you are a straight man or woman for that matter, they 
won't hustle you ( though there is no harm in looking...) I find it a 
good balance to go to straight and gay parties, as I have good friends of 
both persuasions.

Peace. Lady Trash

Soon after the dumb cookie recipie thang resurfaced on the net a

5 hours, but based on my observations of the Organics, it looked
like we'd be able to go from 12 to 6.  6pm is the cutoff.  I really
would have a problem cutting or giving up any sound time.  I could
ask the park to let us go past 6, though.  I'd be happy to go to
7 and let our guests have the 12-1 slot.

thanks for posting that, Rocky.  I'm not trained in psychology but the
article was a bit tinged with p-babble and is a thinly veiled ad for
their seminars and personal training.  However, that's how you get out
the message in that field so I don't begrudge them that.  And it got
me thinking about the whole subject a bit more.  I should trundle off
to the library one of these days and dig through the anthro literature
relating to trance and ritual.

In my experience, it seems like the promoters don't seem to have that 
say.  I could be wrong on this, but the owners if they feel water and 
oranges will take away sales from the bar, will not allow them in.  I've 
never been to an event where I've been denied my water but it has 
happened I'm sure.

I hope they let you in with the oranges.

I actually had a response to this and wasn't going to post it, but now 
that the subject has been ressurected, I feel it important to note that 
a)black people have no choice to be black, they were born that way b) gay 
people have no choice to be gay, they were born that way c) frat people 
have a choice, they were not born frat people.  They chose to be frat 
people and by choosing have selected for themselves a certain lifestyle.  
Should they decide that lifestyle is not suitable, then they can always 
quit the fraternity.
Let me qualify real quickly that a) and b) in an of themselves are not 
negative qualities.  I was making no judgement in my statement about 
whether these qualities are positive or negative.  Just trying to keep 
flamers off my butt! (-;

As some of you know, I've been trying hard to understand some fundamentals
  about people and life etc., and in particular, sorting out the situation
  I found myself in just before coming to grad school- namely, being a paid
  an enormous sum as a fancy programmer in Manhattan, and pretty much
  living "the life".  I had all of the usual conflicts and questions, only
  with a twist: I wanted to understand what was fundamentally wrong with
  doing well like this, having fun, and working relatively hard on
  something I've trained all my life to do, etc.- all relative to maturing
  and growing etc.

So, after a lot of thought, I have hit upon something which really helps
  clarify things, but as these things work, it raises more questions than
  it answers.

In the past, I've met a number of people who I consider to lead (sorry for
  the poor term, but I don't have a better one) "richly woven" lives, where
  the rest of us plebes don't.  Some characteristics:
  - fundamentally being relaxed about who they are, why they're doing what
    they're doing, understanding the people around them (ie. being able to
    talk/be comfortable with anyone), etc. - I'd say a spiritual contentment,
    but I really dislike to use New Age, religious, or other semantically
    overloaded terms...

  - being pc, not out of training, but just because it comes naturally (ie.
    would never get caught using a stereotype, probably because s/he
    knows a lot people in the stereotype, and knows there's more to it than
    that).

  - taking care of his/her body, again, not intentionally, because a doctor
    said so, or because of vanity- but just because they know that it's
    part of leading a balanced life.

  - an implicit notion of humility - but not humility like
    self-deprecation, which arises from lack of self confidence: humility
    like the village witch doctor has: you as an outsider would never think
    to _ask_ how large this person's ego is.

  - REALLY knows what s/he doesn't know.  There's a prof here who I'm sure
    everyone around here would claim is this richly-woven dude, but having
    worked for him, I realized that as nice a guy as he is etc. he lacks an
    understanding of what the other people do in the department and why
    their work is at all important.  This knows-what-doesn't-know thing
    clearly involves being very broadly educated and at the same time very
    deeply educated.  Ever notice how phd's tend to think they know than
    they do about areas outside their field?


Anyway, it occurred to me that the sfrave community has a disproportionate
  density of these kind of folk, so I figured I might ask...

Some questions:
 - Do you see what I'm seeing?  Can you add to this "definition"?

 - Do you know people who you feel are like this?  (please explain/tell the
   story if it adds to the understanding/definition...)

 - How smart do you have to be to be richly woven?  (an interesting
   question, I know: I'd like to believe that you don't have to be very
   smart, but realistically the only people I've met who come close have
   all had staggering amounts of brain matter...)

 - Where do psychoactives fit in?  (I have my own theories based on my own
   experiences, but I'd rather here other people's)

 - It seems clear that part of the path (aigh!) is just experience -
   meeting lots of people, doing lots of things, trying different
   lifestyles, etc.  It seems clear that travel is part of this, and yet I'm
   basically grounded for the next 4-5 years on my PhD here (a different
   kind of enlightenment, but an essential one).  Any suggestions on what I
   can do? (basically, I don't have more than a week off at a shot, and
   those weeks are painful losses if I can't log in... sigh...)

 - Presumably this enlightenment is process, not product.  Thus, a person
   will be richly woven if s/he is "on a path", and if s/he slips off it,
   so goes this enlightenment.  I am reminded of another mentor who seemed
   to really know the world, etc. etc. and who had family troubles which
   essentially ruined him mentally.  Thus, I think it's a temporal thing, no?
   What does this mean for this concept?

Good to hear from you!  Attached are two files, a letter from Andrew Weil,
and the intinerary and costs.  Hope this answers your questions.

26 April l994

Dear Fellow Eclipse Chasers:

I'd like to invite you to join Sabina and me on a too-
good-to-be-true expedition to Peru and Bolivia to catch
a great total eclipse of the sun as well as to visit a
number of sacred sites.

I'm an avid fan of solar eclipses.  The last one I saw,
from a boat off Baja California in July of 1991 was
awesome and left me wanting more.  I'd been planning to
go to South America to see the November 3rd eclipse but
hadn't decided where to go, when India Supera of
Feathered Pipe Ranch asked me if I would lead a Rim
Institute tour.  When I saw the proposed itinerary, I
said, Yes!

Peru and Bolivia are two of my favorite countries.  I've
spent a lot of time in them studying medicinal plants
and, especially, coca leaves, but we'll be going to some
places I've never visited, including Nazca to see the
famous lines in the desert.

I'll be sharing my knowledge of Andean foods, medicines,
and customs, as well as taking coca breaks with you.  We
will talk about altered states of consciousness and the
symbolism of the "Marriage of the Sun and Moon."  I'll
answer your questions about natural medicine and lead
you to the unusual and delicious foods I know from the
Andes and the Altiplano.

Enough said.  Please try to join me in the cone of the
shadow on November 3rd in Peru!


Sincerely,


 Signed   Andrew Weil

"Richness" is a relative thing.  If someone is *relaxed* with who they are,
and is spiritually *content*, it could be said that they have stalled out 
on the road to self-discovery/spirituality.  Even if someone feels that 
they are growing in a relaxed/contented way, it could be questioned 
whether much growth can really be taking place in the absence of 
challenge/struggle/doubt/frustration.  Does stagnation at one particular 
level of richness constitute a  "richly woven" life?

I agree with this.  A person's "path" may simply be to find a "path", or
to explore a variety of paths.  Either way, some kind of change/discovery
is taking place.

>  Thus, I think it's a temporal thing, no?

I'm not sure that there's an absolute definition for a "richly woven" life.
Many apparently "rich" things in life may be devoid of meaning when viewed
from a different perspective.  I guess the richest life of all is one that
simultaneously experiences every aspect of the entire Universe - and such  
a life my not be possible in this world. 

>    What does this mean for this concept?

That each of us has to come up with our own definition of a "richly woven"
life, one that is probably based more on intuition and feeling than any
rational formula; a definition that may never be completely clear.

ObRave: Raving in and of itself doesn't seem as enriching as it used to be,
but it continues to provide me with leads toward the discovery of some
other new and enriching things.

your responding to something in the contents but you don't say anything?
What does this mean?  Do you just feel strongly about what the origional

i personally find that i really *like* lots and lots of change.  i
like to move to new places, i like making new friends, i like picking
up new hobbies.

i'd never claim to have a 'richly woven' life, but on the other hand,
the current working definition seems to preclude my ever even being
eligible :-)

i guess i'm sort of seconding Lee's comments.  the characteristics
seem sort of contemplative / static as opposed to experimental /
dynamic.  the words 'relaxed' and 'content' don't really seem to mesh
well with what Adam says later about the process being important.

hmmm.  interesting stuff, tho.

i often wonder if my life is following the right path. lately things seem 
to be going really well for me. i feel a lot more content with myself, 
sort of what could be described as an 'inner peace'. it's just that i 
feel so lost in the cosmic scope of things, i don't know wether i'm 
fooling myself into thinking i'm happy while i'm really suffering, or am 
i really doing something right and maybe life can be good, rich, and 
fulfilling. i've always thought of myself as being rich, though i never 
have any money, and am usually in debt. i don't know if having a lot of 
money is really that important at all as far as being rich goes. 
i love travelling, and seeing how poor some people can be such as those 
who live on the streets in jaipur, india, selling scraps of paper-trash 
that they have folded into origami type little toys and having a yearly 
cash flow of about a dollar, yet still be content and serene. are they 
poor? rich? it's all a matter of perspective. damn...lost track of my 
thoughts again....

I've only been raving for three months and I feel I've gotten a lot out 
of it.  When I went to my first rave in Februrary (Gathering) one of the 
first things that pleasantly surprised me was the openness that people 
seemed to have.  On a more specific level, I saw people smoking pot very 
openly in the chill-out room.  For months before then I was thinking, 
when will be somewhere were people are smoking pot and not making it seem 
dirty?  When in the dorm-rooms, my friends end up putting towels under 
the door.  Its all so secretive.  I felt so good knowing that there were 
places that I went where I didn't feel out of time and place.  What 
people were doing seemed so natural and carefree.  It wasn't so much the 
pot smoking itself but what it represented for me.  

One had the freedom to do what they wanted to do.  There was no judgement
on me or anyone.  (I'm sure there must be people who still judge but
that's the not overall feeling that I get.) By having this freedom to be,
I'm more at ease with who I am and less self-conscious about myself. 
Being in a supportive environment where people are non-judgemental, this
has helped me to be more honest and expressive with other people.  I was
very intimidated before to hug or kiss male friends but I feel its much
easier to do now. 

Listening to the music and being around ravers has given me a different 
perspective about my desires in life.  It definately has given me a 
bigger area to examine than before.  New areas to explore...

I don't see anything wrong with taking a good job.  You had a choice
about school or work.  IMO, grad school better be for personal
enrichment not for a better job.  

I don't think either choice should affect your "path of happiness"

Most of your richness laundry list sounds like self-confidence and maturity. 
I have met *many* immature grad students and PhD's. 
It isn't easy (or pleasant) to deal with someone who has loads of
self-confidence but lacks the maturity to temper it.

How does *anyone* learn to love themselves and not be an asshole to others?

>    Ever notice how phd's tend to think they know more than

Hell yes.
This often bugs my wife.  I try and be more understanding of their
social shortcomings.  It has a lot to do with the way you are required
to present yourself in academia.  You speak with certainty and 
expect to be called on it.  This pattern doesn't always translate well into
other parts of life.  It is a pattern of communication found in lots of
places (not just school) but it is particularly pervasive there.

> - Do you know people who you feel are like this?  (richly woven)

I think so. 
I don't see anything wrong with viewing others as role
models - but there is a limit to the usefulness of this.  You need
look at yourself.  You make yourself every moment of the day.

> - How smart do you have to be to be richly woven?  

Not very smart - at least in a book/school sense.
Are there "richly woven" high school dropouts?
I would say yes.

> - Where do psychoactives fit in?  

Maybe there isn't fear of them.  Occasional entertainment?

> - It seems clear that part of the path is just experience 
> - Presumably this enlightenment is process, not product.  

Life is not just external stimulation.  
Any enlightenment I think I have I try and appreciate *now*.  
These insights have changed almost constantly in my life.

I don't think pursuit of an enlightened state should be all consuming
nor do I think it should be totally neglected.  It seems to come in
waves for me.  There have been periods of my life where I spent more
or less time on my personal philosophy-of-happiness.

The fact that you are in school means you will be busy, poor, and
trapped in one geographical area.  This in no way limits the stuff
you can "experience".   

I think the posts about being static have a valid point.  Are you 
implying that there is some plateau you want to reach?
I didn't interpret what you said in this way.

All I can suggest is that feeling comfortable with the idea of
being on an everchanging path may come with time.  And may just as
easily be ripped to shreds at a later time.  This idea of comfort
or being richly woven is transient but valid.  Am I making sense?

You are talking about the fundamentals of religion, spirituality, and
philosophy.  This is above all else a very individual and personal
struggle.

In honor of Susie "bi-coastal raver-babe" Kameny's birthday,
Brian and I will be going to Come/Unity with Susie.  If anyone
would like to join us for the ensuing madness, we'll be arriving
around 3.30 / 4.00 am, staying till the end, and then going over
to Alex Bennett's morning show (at Live 105) for a few hours 
until I have to depart for work.  By the way, Penn Jillette
will be one of the guests on tomorrow morning's show.

I'm going to bed early tonight, so don't call . . . just show
up at Come/Unity and look for us and give Susie big birthday
hugs.

Party on,

Laura

P.S. Come/Unity is at 1015 Folsom, bring 21+ ID etc. etc.

I'm content to be challenged, as long as there is some possiblity of meeting
the challenge.

Frustration happens to me when I'm not making any progress.  I don't think
there is any virtue in becoming frustrated, spinning ones wheels may register
on the speedometer but it doesn't get you anywhere, in fact it digs you in
where you are.

In what I now see as a bizarre stupidity on my part, I posted the
   richly-woven email during crunch-month, the last four weeks of the
   semester in grad school here.  To those of you not familiar, this boils
   down to lots and lots of all nighters, and a massive codefest.  The
   email was sitting my drafts folder for several months and I've been
   meaning to finish and send it, but haven't had the last-thought needed
   to get it out; when it came, I sent it.  oops.

I promise to restart my end of the thread in about a week or two.  To those
   of you who wrote me personally, I *promise* to respond - please don't
   get offended if it's time delayed by a week or more...

again, apologies.

Hi Everyone...

Sorry for the crosspost.  For safety's sake, be sure you are replying to me
and not to the world if you reply to this.

I've started a Summer Meet-While list.  It's an informal list of ravers.  
It purpose is to find and connect with people in territories of the 
nation you may find yourself in over this summer.

This will be the ONLY post about this.  Save this email!!!

For example, if someone was traveling through the large Delta hub at the 
Cincy airport, they could take the Meet While list, find my name, contact
me, and ask me about stuff, maybe an event, or anything.  

So how do you participate on this list?  It's quite easy.  Send me an
email message with a subject line of one of the following:

    #help    -  gets a simple help file
    #form    -  gets the form to follow for inclusion on the list
    #add     -  puts the form you got in a special mailbox for me to add to
                the list at a later date
    #summer  -  retrieves a current copy of the list


So, in a nutshell::

  1)  #form   (get the form and fill it out)
  2)  #add    (send it back to me)
  3)  #summer (get a copy of the list AT ANY TIME!)
  

Naturally, with a working list like this, if you get the list now vs. one 
week from now, it will be different.  I suggest getting a copy of the 
list as late as possible.

I'd also suggest keeping this message.

Please bounce this message around to your amigos who may not be on any 
rave lists due to email volume, but who may want to meet people over the 
summer.

Good luck on finals for those taking them.  Peace...

For me, a richly woven life contains all facets of health, including 
mental, physical, spiritual, psychological, social, etc.  One should be 
moving forward in all areas of health in order to be a richly woven person.
     Moving forward is not the absence of strife, nor the presence of 
peace.  It is a state of being in which one assesses ones goals and 
measures current situations and opportunities against these goals.  This 
awareness enables one to make decisions that will promote ones goal, but 
will not violate one's personal code of ethics.  
    Moving forward allows for personal setbacks, errors in judgement and 
forgiveness of self and others for violations against the self.
    It is complete open-mindedness, honesty and willingness.
    
     On a daily basis I ask myself, "What have I done for my health 
today?"  I exercise, read, attend spiritual meetings, go to my therapist 
(ok, who doesn't have one by now?), go out dancing to raves, etc.   If I 
have made an effort in these areas to reach my goal then I have had a 
successful day.  It is irrelevant whether I had a good work day, whether 
I made a lot of money, whether I impressed people, etc.  I measure myself 
against myself.

     That's my view of richly woven life, and according to my own 
subjective view of it, I live it every day.
     By no means am I perfect, but I don't want to be.  If I reach my 
goals, then I need to evaluate where I am heading.  Something is awry.
 
     Life is a journey.  Enjoy each moment.
Tanya

Subject: Re: Music Yes

Let me add a few things to the discussion of music.
       1) Music/Sound is integrated into social practice.  There are no
societies without music, the body makes sounds (I'm including the voice).
       2) A discussion of music, perhaps moreso than of theater or dance,
should begin with reception, since, as Cage pointed out, the ears are always
open. The maker of music/sound is also the first receiver. Schechner suggests
that music is about rhythm/time. Abstractly, yes, but it is more about space/
body/position, since hearing situates one in relation to sound that is not, as
by the eyes, obligated to the gaze.
        3) recording and amplification are forms of representation that have
encoded performance away (far away) from the body and music/sound as energetic
systems.
        4) about this last point: music/noise/sound have a physical properties
that bodies in motion don't have.  Instruments are technologies.  The dialogics
of musical performance involve sound waves moving among persons.  This creates
another modality of performance, where the air is the mise en scene (pieces by
Alvin Lucier exemplify this beautifully).
        5) Back to # 1 - the social value and uses of music predominate over
the aesthetic.  Why else are those Striesand tickets so high; or, does anyone
really think another Rolling Stones tour will adds to the art of rock?
     Just mus-ing.

I just got a job a Silent Records and wanted to go dance and celebrate
At Come/Unity but the cops busted it right after i got there. I was 
bummed, I really needed to dance. Oh well guess I have to go to 
SPAZ/YSH/Food Not Bombs.

Despite my disappointment I felt somewhat consoled by the friends and 
familiar faces. The rave community really has something special to it but 
we must continually be aware that we need to engage a broad range of issues
so that we can allow ourselves and others to unfold into new and more 
compassionate modes of being and becoming.

We must search for understanding and insight. We can do this by knowing 
how we know and using this knowledge of knowledge to guide our actions.

"What biology shows us is that the uniqueness of being human lies 
exclusively in a social strutural coupling that occurs through languaging...
Biology also shows us that we can expand our coginitive domain. This 
arises through a novel experience brought forth by reasoning, through the 
encounter with a stranger, or, more directly, through the expression of a 
biological interpersonal congruence that lets us see the other person and 
open up for hir room for existence beside us. This act is called LOVE, or 
,if we prefer a milder expression, the acceptance of the other person 
beside us in our daily living. This is the biological foundation of 
social phenomena: without love, without acceptance of others living beside 
us, there is no social process nd , therefore, no humanness. Anything 
that undermines the acceptance of others, from competency to the 
possesion of truth and on to ideologic certainty, undermines the social 
process that generates it. Let us not deceive ourselves: we are not 
moralizing, we re not preaching love. We are only revealing the fact that 
,biologically , without love, without acceptance of others, there is no 
social phenomenom. If we still live together that way, we are living 
indifference and negation under a pretense of love.
     The knowledge of knowledge compels. It compels us to adopt an 
attitude of permanent vigilance against the temptation of certainty. It 
compels us to realize that the world everyone sees is not *the* world 
but *a* world which we bring forth with others. I t compels us to see that the 
world will be different only if WE LIVE DIFFERENTLY. It compels us 
because, when we know that we know, we cannot deny (to ourselves or to 
oothers) that we know. 
     We have only the world that we bring forth with others, and only 
love helps us bring it forth"

--Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, _The Tree Of Knowledge:The 
Biological Roots of Human Understanding_

	Hi everyone!!  I'm new to this list but I have been on MW-raves for
about 6 months.  Finally I am getting my chance to see the Bay area.
I will be out in the area from 4-8 to 4-13, so if you have any suggestions
of where to go , what to see & do please let me know.  Also, I would love
it if anyone could drop me some tips on some house record shops.  I guess
I'm looking to pick up a little bit of the Sf-house sound while I'm
in the area.  In the past couple of months I've had the pleasure of hearing
a couple of Dj's from the Bay area.  I have heard Scott Hardkiss, Jeno, &
Garth at events in St. Louis.  Loved'em all, very pleasant to chat with as
well.

Peace

	In my previous post I stated I would be in the area on 4-8 to 4-13,
what I meant to say was 5-8 to 5-13.  So any information you could provide
on records shops or events would be greatly appreciated by myself.

Peace out

Douglas Rushkoff, the author of "Cyberia: Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace"
will speak tomorrow May 6th, 7:30 pm at Barnes & Noble in San Jose 
( 3600 Stevens Creek Blvd. @ San Thomas  - Tel. 408-984-3495 ).


From the few pages I read, when he's not talking about raves&drugs, he talks
about computer&drugs, so I'll go and check out if there is anything else
interesting in his book, and now...

Let me go back on my job, not before changing the bg of my X-terminal with
a new psychedelic fractal and put another couple of trancy CDs in my player :)

Ciao,
	Raffaele

..........................................................................

From "This month at Barnes & Noble"...

	In "Cyberia: Life in the Trenches" of Hyperspace, author Douglas 
	Rushkoff explores and explains the world of technology, from 
	virtual reality, computer hackers, and technoshamen, to raves,
	smart drugs, and more. An "Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" for the
	90's, "Cyberia" explores this fluorishing social network, the 
	cutting edge of culture most likely to be found where one least
	expects it -- Silicon Valley. Visit the trenches (in our own
	backyard) with the author of "Cyberia".

And from the book... 

The beginning...
	
	"Are we in the bowl yet?" the boy asks, feeling the first effect
	of the drug.
	  "I think so," answers his friend, also a sophomore at U.C Berke-
	ley, who punches a few keys on his computer, releasing a brilliant
	paisley landscape onto the monitor. "We're over the event horizon.
	Now it's just a matter of timer."
	  The questioner panics. "So we're in it, then ? We're in the at-
	tractor?"
	  "Are you talking about the acid, the computer, or the universe?"
	  A pause. The swirling computer-generated pictures are reflected
	in the boys' eyes. "All of 'em, I guess."
	  "I grok," agrees the operator.
	  Two college students at three in the morning, tripping on the
	drug Ecstasy as they create fractal images on a computer in their
	dorm room. Their topic of conversation? The end of our dimension,
	of course.

And the end...

	But maybe this is the real Cyberia. It's not tackling complex com-
	puter problems, absorbing new psychedelic substances, or living
	through designer shamanic journeys. It's not learning the terminol-
	ogy of media viruses, chaos math, or house music. It's figuring out
	how two people can sell smart drugs in the same town without
	driving each other crazy. It's learning how to match the intentions
	of Silicon Valley's most prosperous corporations with the values of
	the psychedelics users who've made them that way. It's turning a
	nightclub into the modern equivalent of a Mayan temple without
	getting busted by the police. It's checking your bank statement to
	see if your ATM has been cracked, and figuring out how to punish
	the kid who did it without turning him into an hardened criminal. It's
	not getting too annoyed by the agendas of people who say they
	have none, or by the inane, empty platitudes of those who say they
	do. It's learning to package the truth about our culture into media-
	friendly, bite-size pieces, and then finding an editor willing to put
	them in print because they strike him as amusing.
	  Coping in Cyberia means using our currently limited human lan-
	guage, bodies, emotions, and social realities to usher in something
	that's supposed to be free of those limitations. Things like virtual
	reality, smart bars, hypertext, the WELL, role-playing games, DMT,
	Ecstasy, house, fractals, sampling, anti-Muzak, technoshamanism,
	ecoterrorism, morphogenesis, video cyborgs, Toon Town, and
	Mondo 2000 are what slowly pull our society--even our world--
	past the event horizon of the great attractor at the end of the time.
	But just like these, the next earth-shattering mem to hit the news-
	stands or computer net my be the result of a failed relationship, a
	drug bust, an abortion on acid, or even a piss over the side of the
	porch.
	  Cyberia is frightening to everyone. Not just to technophobes, rich
	businessman, midwestern farmers, and suburban housewives, but,
	most of all, to the boys and girl hoping to ride the crest of the in-
	formational wave.
	  Surf's up.

	ComeUnity was going off as planned Garth had finished his set when I
	got there and Simon was getting into it.  It was nice to see a lot
	of "old skool" and everyone was having a great time, that's why
	It was such a bummer when the SFPD literally pulled the plug on
	1015 at 4:30 a.m. One Half hour into Jeno's set.  The police literally
	came in, unscrewed, and TOOK the master house mixer from the back
	room.  This folks is a very dangerous precident, it basically means
	that the police are going to play hardball when it come to the Scene
	they don't care about what is right, the Law, or federal judges, they
	have guns and we don't and furthermore who can we call to protect us
	from them? IF SFPD thinks that this will stop the Scene, they are saddly
	mistaken, all it will accomplish is driving the parties further 
	underground, IT WILL NOT STOP ANYTHING!  I hope they don't have to

I purchased Psycick Warriors of Gaia - Of Biospheres and Sacred Grooves
last night and was a little disapointed.  It's O.K., but just not as
good as I expected and I felt like I coulda done better by going with
some other things on my "to get" list that I know are great or that I
shoulda takin a chance with something else.  Oh well, I guess that's
what chances are all about.  How does Psycick Rythms compare with this
one?

Doug Rushkoff's Cyberia does touch on raves, particularly
that halcyon time of ToonTown, Mark, Diana, Earth Girl and
then Chris. I've met Doug, used his previous book, How to
Get High Without Drugs, successfully with students, and had
good chats with him at Island Group meetings when he visited
Santa Cruz.

I like the way Cyberia interweaves its themes and its stories
of cyberculture in Northern California.  To my knowledge, this
is the first book of its sort.  One might even say its richly
woven...the devil made me say that! Fie!  Fie!

Enjoy...I did,
Will

If there are any attorneys in our community,
isn't this a legal matter?  Know any lawyers
or offices aching to do some pro bono work?

On Apr 29,  9:40am, you proclaimed:
} Just curious, was the letter ever sent?  If it was sent, was there a 
} response?

Nope... after talking with a few SC locals, we were convinced of the
inefficacy of sending a letter like we had wanted.  They are more
interested in seeing action instead of words, so as sometime in the
next few weeks I'd like to go down and do a beach cleanup - maybe
even make it a regular thing, with or without music.

anyone out there have any handle / remember how much kits are from the
FRB?  anyone know what kind of broadcasting power these kits have?
also, does anyone know if they'll be discussing how to "soup up"
Ramsey FM-10 transmitters or if the FRB kit is a variant on the FM-10?

i'm very seriously thinking about attending, and any answers to these
questions would help me make up my mind.  i've been thinking about
picking up an FM-10 kit for a while, if the FRB kit is better and/or i
can learn something about improving broadcast range of the FM-10, the
class will be well worth the time.

thanks, bryce, for posting this!
Bob

Hi.  This is really long and it was already posted to alt.rave.

However, I enjoyed it.  I know I sometimes get cynical about raves and
ravers, and I know other people sometimes fall into that too, so I
thought I'd post this as a gentle reminder.  The author has been one
of my dearest friends for many years.

(Some of you may recall that for the last year or so, every time I'm
about to fly to Illinois I always looked around desperately for a
certain substance because I had this friend who I thought would
appreciate it.  This is said friend, and as you'll see, he got along
just fine without me.)

If you have any response to this, you may want to send it to the
address below but also cc: a copy to me because David may have to
leave the net soon.  I'll make sure he gets a copy.

Just a reminder for those of us who had our night cut short at ComeUnity...

Pure Space tips its cap to Cinco de Mayo with DJs:

Carlos Locos
El Spun
Jalapeno Jeno

Late start tonight--midnight, should go 'til 6.

YSH/SPAZ also sounds good...

Either way, feel the groove...

Tony

Greetings everyone.

As it being that I'm new to the list, I thought I would formally
introduce myself (instead of just lurking) to all the net people out here.

My name is Ed (Ed E) and I'm a graduating grad student out of the School
of Library Science and Information (yes, there is such a major and no I
don't have my hair in a bun...).  Considering that I don't have a job
lined up or anything, I plan to spend some time out in San Fran at a
friend's house to unwind and perhaps even become employed. 8)

I'm currently residing here in Bloomington, Indiana in the Midwest and
have been a long subscriber to mw-raves.  However, considering that I'm
going to be out there in a week, I thought I would subscribe to this list
before I headed to San Fran.

Needless to say, it sounds like there is a great scene.  Granted, the
Midwest has it's moments (the highlight being chemical inconvienced with
Plastikman...), but I'm really looking forever to checking things out
here and meeting people.  In fact, I would really appreciate if I could
meet up with any of you (considering I don't know any ravers out here)
so that I could kind of get a sense for what's going on.  If any of you
could be so kind as to e-mail their phone numbers an such (I'm not sure I'll
have net access for a while) I'd be ever so grateful.

Peace,

Ed E

Psycick Rhythms, from what i understand, is like a sampling CD 
demonstrating various soundscapes that PWOG created. (this is what the 
guy at the record store told me anyway.  if he's wrong then flame him)  i 
enjoy the PWOG spinoff group eXquisite CORpsE.  their latest cd is called 
"inner light" on Kk records.  it is absolutely brilliant.  a nice 
tribal/trance combo.  very highly recommended.

see you in the phuture,

	It's kind of ridiculous that they released this one on CD -- It's
got a beautiful throb to it, but it's so minimal -- just evolutions and 
permutations of a wicked beat, and not really complete until mixed.
	Try Reload's album, or the Usability Now compilation, both on 
Infonet Records, and both highly conducive to trance states, at home or 
in the car!

Upon learning that the map point for Basics last Sat. was just a mile or two
away from my house, I decided to go to that instead of Lauchpad- sorry I
missed the sfravers who showed up to that one; hope to see you at the Blue
Cube!  Tickets were $10 and you had to have one to get in- the party was
in a warehouse behind Albany Hill.  A note on Albany police:  my friend
Dave says they are uncool and told me an anecdote or two to illustrate, but
apparently they didn't hassle the Basics party much, although they did
show up to say "turn it down" because some nearby apartment-dwellers were
complaining.  Oh well.

First to spin was Joshua, followed by Kenneth and then James.  Kenneth
tried out some new styles- sort of trance-oriented and not very easy to
dance to, but then he got into a more danceable groove that I liked much
better.  James came on after and kept it going til maybe 7 or so.  Rumor
had it that Markie might show later on, but it was not to be.

This was a good party...it was mostly the crowd that did it.  I like East
Bay parties mostly because of the kids (!) that show up.. You can really
tell they want to have a good time and maybe don't get the chance to get
out to the city that much.  I got a big kick out of a big group of really
young women who all showed up wearing exactly the same outfit - the baggy
jean and black bra look was in effect.  You go girlz!  The Vibe award goes
of course to Kenneth who brought these glasses that flash red lights in
your field of vision.....dancing with those on was so incredible.  He plus
maybe twenty others stayed on til it was over...although the turnout wasn't
high, Martin seemed pretty satisfied.  We asked him about his voicemail
message and he said he thinks that the scene is getting more solid and that
since fewer people are going out EVERY weekend, maybe their expectations
are changing.  I know mine are...I liked Basics because it felt like that
chez Groove party (was it Ethan & Bryce that threw that?) where people were
really cool and the crowd was kinda small.  You guys remember that one?
I still have all these neat Hello Kitty stickers that someone gave me!

Well, the New Moon party is coming up Tuesday!  Maybe I'll see some of 
you there?!  The location is East Bay and NOT Point Reyes this time, by
the way.  

seeya!

Subject: ComeUnity/1015 Folsom harassment
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

I got to CU at around 1, the party in full swing with Garth spinning some 
really nice throbbing acid funk.  The 1st 1/2 of Simon's set didn't really
grab me as much so I spent some time in the Chill space - plenty of 
comfortable seating, with Jason spinning a nice assortment of ambient house.

The 2nd half of Simon's set really took off.  He seems to go more for
the mid & high frequencies, i.e. his grooves aren't deep and not as
trance-inducing, but once his sets reach a high energy seamlessness, I 
have no trouble going along for the ride.  As usual, the visuals at 1015 
Folsom were very stimulating.  Synergy was projecting their usual magic 
onto 2 giant weather balloons and this worked even better the usual double 
screens.  

When Jeno took over, the party was starting to peak; I don't know what it 
is about Jeno.  The stuff he started out with wasn't anything amazing, 
but there was something about the tones that seened to draw me into a 
trance state.  I'm beginning to wonder if it's psychological - I see Jeno 
and somehow this expectation is created - or I sense his focus, as though 
I can pick up on some kind of deep intensity vibe coming from the guy.  
Anyway, 20 minutes into his set, just as we were about to leave the 
stratosphere, the music stops.

It was 4:30am, we milled around while the SFPD look over the equipment
and had the main mixer de-wired and removed.  Someone started singing 
"we are family" and the rest of us clapped along.  There was very little 
anger displayed - it was really hard to believe that it was over.  It felt 
really weird going to City Hall later that same morning to chum it up with 
the SFPD for the _In The Light_ sound permit.

So does anyone know what the justification was for this bust?  The volume 
was not as loud as in the past, almost bordering on not being loud enough.  
You could barely hear it outside.  The sun roof was completely covered 
with insulation.  It's obvious that the management are trying to be 
sensitive to noise complaints.  I may not be current on all the legal 
details, but I thought 1015 had gotten an injunction against the police
action that had been levied against them.  This is starting to look like
police harassment.  

I know that 1015 is just a club-for-profit, but it has been a good home
to the House scene, one that will be surely missed.  I don't know if it
makes sense to have a petition of some sort to circulate and we would 
certainly need more info before doing such a thing.  I wonder what this
means for Beltane Wicked which is rumored to be at 1015 this weekend.

Hey, Ravers! I stopped by the Food Not Bombs benefit last night, held
at Caesar's, and co-sponsored by YSH and SPAZ (if i recall correctly).
This was a hella fun party folks!  I heard a rumor about another one
next month...if they do it, Bryce Bob Briggs says go :)

I walked in to find a cornucopia of food and some very friendly folks
staffing the donation station.  There was a flat of strawberries, a box
of oranges, and another box of bagels...cool stuff.  in the main room,
there was _breakbeat_!  i haven't heard breakbeat for a year and a 
half.  i was surprised, and kind of pleased in a twisted way.  i usually
can't listen to breakbeat for very long, but this was perfectly OK and
lotsa fun.  and people were dancing, which was also really nice.

the mezzanine had been turned into a vending area, with lots of cool
clothes and hats and other ravey things. the vendors were quite nice
and way laid back.  The FNB people did a really cool puppet show,
with lots of multi-media and video thrown in for fun.  there were
video cameras everywhere, it seemed, and a fabulous drumming circle.
we were also treated to some live techno by Ken Velocette (i think)
and the Machine Elves (?), which was mindbendingly good dance music.
the party really took off after that, and then we were treated to
more DJ music.

All in all, a fine time.

I'm willing to bet their confiscation of the mixer was illegal. In any
case, next time I'd chain and lock all the equipment. I'd also advise
Ira to have a camcorder at any future 1015 functions. It might also be
wise to take SPL readings at various points outside the building to
prove there isn't that much noise.

> So... what happened with the Matthew Fox meeting? 

I promise to give my perspective on the meeting next week.  Janie
is still struggling to transcribe the tape of the meeting, and although
there will be alot of gaps, I'd like to be able to use it a reference.  
Unfortunately, her situation at work makes it impossible for her to type 
the stuff into an emailable form.  Hopefully, someone out there has a 
way to scan it in from paper.

 A note on Albany police:  my friend
Dave says they are uncool and told me an anecdote or two to illustrate, but
apparently they didn't hassle the Basics party much, although they did
show up to say "turn it down" because some nearby apartment-dwellers were
complaining.  Oh well.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I'll second this.  I grew up there.  They have a real attitude like
they are this oasis amidst the desert of crime (Berkeley, Oakland, and
Richmond - for those not as in tune to code-words as John S. Lee ;-) and
they're gonna keep Albany secure from the sand-dwelling trouble makers.

Subject: Innovative Self Defense Classes
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

A lot of raves are held in potentially dangerous, poorly lit areas, late at
night.  Sometimes there are not a lot of people around outside, especially
when it is necessary to park a long way away from the venue.  We strive for
everyone to experience the global community that we live in.  However,
safety is still a concern to many people, both men and women.

A friend of mine took a self defense class from an organization a couple
of years ago that has hit hard economic times in the recent slow economy, and
they are in danger of going bankrupt.  They are asking their graduates to
help them fill their next few classes.  It is *NOT* JUST ANOTHER
SELF-DEFENSE CLASS.  They have a unique approach of empowering the
individual that other self-defense courses do not do.  I believe the work
they do is important and particularly innovative, and think it would be
tragic if their business closed, so I am spreading the word among people I
know.  If you or anyone you know might be interested in taking a self
defense class, please read this message.

Bay Area Model Mugging (BAMM) primarily teaches self defense to women,
but also offers classes to men, and children over the age of 7.  The
classes feature instructors in heavily-padded suits who attack the
students so that the students get to train their minds and bodies in
actually fighting off an assailant.  This is how it differs from other
self-defense classes.  The student actually gets physical, and
For someone who has ever felt helpless in this situation, it is
amazingly empowering to experience what it is like to take control.
Students report that they stopped feeling fearful and took control of
their lives as a result of the classes.

The women's classes are intensive 5-session courses in which students
learn to de-escalate conflicts, stand their ground in intimidating
situations, protect themselves physically from various kinds of blows,
and if necessary, deliver a knock-out blow to a single unarmed
assailant.  They actually deliver the knock-out blow at full force to
the heavily-padded instructor.  Advanced classes teach students to
cope with multiple and armed assailants.  Children learn to say no
effectively to adults, including those who may be authority figures,
and to fight a larger, more powerful assailant well enough to escape.
I believe the men's class is analogous to the women's class.

These classes are taught responsibly -- students are not trained to be
aggressors.  They are taught the skills they need to fight back if
they choose to, and the skills to de-escalate situations so that they
are less likely to need to make that choice.  Students are also given
training in making the choice of whether to fight back.  The aim of
the course is not to make someone feel compelled to fight, but to give
them that realistic option.  This is a supportive environment where
even women who don't believe that they can fight off someone bigger
and stronger learn that they can if they know how.

Although the classes are not cheap (approx. $500), no one is getting
rich off of them -- they are expensive to produce.  BAMM is committed
to all women who want this training being able to receive it
regardless of economic standing, and operates a scholarship fund to
support this.

If you or someone you know might be interested in taking a class from
BAMM, you are welcome to call BAMM directly at (415) 592-7300.

I have no affiliation with BAMM, and receive no benefit from this post
other than the satisfaction that it may help someone overcome a fear of
being attacked and empower that person to stay safe.

Please repost this anywhere you feel that it may be helpful, but please
take my name off of the header (I don't want to receive a bunch of
questions about it).

Thanks for your attention.

The only DJ Sasha I know of is from the UK.  If this is the
same person then it all depends on what you are in to.  I
know people who love him and I know peole who can't stand
his taste in music.

I've heard some of the remixes that Sasha-from-the-UK has done
and left them in the bins where I found them.  But that's just
my personal taste.

If you are in to what the Wicked DJs are known for spinning
then you might want to check the Sasha disc out.  He's not
really "like" Jeno/Garth/et alia but I think there's enough of 
a common thread there to make a recommendation.

By-the-way, Sasha was in town at the Sound Factory a month or 
so ago.

Hi Folx--

I can verify what Don says.  This past winter I took
one of these classes--and it was worth it!  It was
expensive, gruelling, and got me past shitless to
fearless in the right situations.  I learned in the
basic course all the things he mentions and plan to go
on to some advanced courses next fall or winter.  I
*never* thought I could do what I did in that course!
My powers of breathing, surveillance, control and
relaxation are additional gains that I never imagined
I would have!

Thanks, Don, for mentioning these classes!  I *do*
feel much safer on my way to and from raves/parties
in the wee hours in the out of the way places because
I now know what to look for and what I can--and cannot--
do!

World's second oldest raver (yer never too old to learn),
Will

I know this is a common practice among ravers.  When people touch the 
water bottles with their lips, are they going to be "infecting" it?  I 
like sharing water but I don't want to be spreading anything but love.

I was wondering/hoping if someone could start posting playlists of 
artists & songs that have been played at events. The reason is that most 
of the records at the local radio station are interfiled, causing me many 
problems.  Thanks in advance!

Sorry this is a little late for the subject...

Here's a review of the book a longtime friend and ancient SFRaver wrote
recently:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I just read the whole fuckin' thing.
My capsule review: Yuck.

I think that overall, _Cyberia_ sucks hard. It portrays an entire culture
in terms only of drugs, pseudoreligious experience, and hacking. Now I saw
enough of this whole scene as it was happening to know that it was much
more than that, and that his analysis leaves out almost all of what I
consider "the good stuff."

As far as I am concerned, it is a sensationalist piece of trash, written by
someone who really didn't "get it" it the broadest possible sense. He got
sucked in by the auras of the famous personalities (McKenna, Leary, R. U.
Sirius) and by the potential shock value of exposing the
cyber-druggie-wierdos to the masses. He completely lost any critical
ability to figure out what parts of what he was being fed were true and
what was utter bunk (if indeed he ever had such a capability)

The entire ability of electronic communication technologies to bring
people together, McLuhan's whole spiel about electronic
retribalization, the entire concept of community (& Virtual
Communities a la Rheingold) completely eluded Rushkoff. It presents a
dark and hopeless world where drug-induced schizophrenia and
cybercrime dominate the day to day activities, if not the long-term
goals, of our entire culture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't read it yet but am planning on doing so soon.

My parents know that I've gone to a few raves, but I know when I get back 
home from school that they are going (to try) to stop me from going to 
them.  My dad, working for ABC, Alcoholic Beverage Control, hears about 
a lot about the high profile ones.  He told me that a lot of "those types 
of places" have been spiking the smart drinks with opium and they are 
dangerous and my mom thinks its just part of the "fast lane".  I really 
want them to understand where I go is not about all those rumors your 
hear and Basic Instinct is not the norm!  Can anyone please give me some 
good things I can tell them so they don't freak out every time I go or I 
don't have to sneak out when I want to go?  Any and all comments would be 
appreciated, I know others would benefit by this info too.

Unfortunately, if that's what they think, you've got an uphill battle before
you. My suggestion is to try and make them understand that many promoters are
in this to make a buck so why would they spike something with opium when it's
so expensive? (Opium, for christ's sake? OPIUM? PLEASE!)

   For all those who gave up looking for this party, you missed out!  My 
friends and I left from Monterey around 11:30, we hit Davenport and 
called the hotline and the directions seemed pretty simple... sure :)

   Anyways, we drive and drive and drive until we suddenly notice we are 
closer to San Francisco then Santa Cruz, so we start heading back towards 
Santa Cruz.  We stop in Pascedaro around 1:00 and call the # again.  We 
decide to keep looking and finally see some cars parked along the road 
and figure it was the place.  We get out and can hear the music, although 
it sounded more like it was coming from a car, or like it was coming out 
of a small stereo placed in a bush. We finally find our way to the crowd, 
and oh what a crowd!

   The vibe was fantastic, I met some SFraves people for the first time 
and met a ton of real cool people from Santa Cruz.  The sound was 
fantastic and the two black lights were just perfect. The music was some 
of the nicest trancey/dancey stuff I've heard in a while.  The weather wasnt 
too cold either.  My friends and I danced all night and into the morning 
(when just about 10 people were left) until we finally decided to hit the 
road.

   Anyways, just want to say hello to all the people I met there (I was 
the guy with the big huge flashlight with the flashing yellow thing and 
the flourescent light too :) )

Dj James: Some friends of mine are doing a wherehouse party in 
Watsonville this Friday and they're looking for some more DJ's... Drop me 
some mail if you're interested.

  Peace out - rave on... ..  .

Another word of endorsement for Men's Model Mugging. This is Robertj, and I
completed the first Men's Model Mugging course held in Monterey. The course
completely altered, and empowered my sense of safety and my ability to
diffuse potentially dangerous situations. It gives you options in crisis
situations, rather than just being frozen in fear. If you're afraid walking
on the streets, to and from the raves, you should take it.  robertj.......MRP

Beltane Babies!!!!!

Hi to all of you wonderfully Wicked Sfravers: Geoff, Rox, Lane, Ovid and
Che!!! Finally, it was so great meeting and being with you.  Garthie
certainly stirred up a cauldren of musical brew. I'm afraid to check the
scale and see how much weight I sweated out,  just towel me off and hang me
out to dry.  The vibe all night was  so happy , positive and thick, you could
swim in it. When my friend Cristo showed up at 5:00 he said, "Has it been
like this all night?" It was.  Thanks SF. Robertj...MRP

Subject: The Mathew Fox Meeting
Cc: sfraves-planners@techno.Stanford.EDU
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

7 or 8 of us, mostly SFRavers, gathered in the living room of Bob Jesse's 
house.  Matthew Fox arrived with Cliff, the guy who posted here has acted 
as Matthew Fox's liason to us.  Both of them were very warm and pleasant, 
and the atmosphere was very amiable and relatively relaxed.  

Things got off to an excruciating slow start with a each of us giving the
a personal introduction about the spiritual and raving aspects of our lives.  
Although I guess it was important that Matthew get a feel for who 
we were, most of us were extremely self-indulgant with the opportunity to 
confess our life stories to our celebrity guest.  About half the meeting 
was taken up with these "introductions".  Somewhere along the way, the 
point was made that we were *not* truly representative of the rave 
community at large.  In fact we never even attempted (nor were we asked)
about what SF Bay Areas ravers are generally about.

When Matthew started talking, it was clear that he was very well-practiced
at this sort of thing.  His presentation was smooth and polished.  He comes
across as a very likeable and charming guy, and it was clear that as the
meeting progressed we were generally happy to be seduced by him.  And why
not?  Isn't reaching out and communicating partly what we claim to be all 
about?  Matthew Fox seems to be a bridge builder; it is well known that he 
has met with *many* non-Christian groups.  I did find it ironic that the 
one bridge he has failed to build was within his own religion.  Defrocked 
by the Vatican, he has been hired on by the Episcopalian Church, where 
Matthew still expects trouble.  Even the Bishop who has promised to 
"protect him" from the "right wing" of the church has already told him that
he will *not* read any of Matthew Fox's books.  Hmm.  What does it mean
when your protector doesn't even want to know what you stand for..?  That
was one of the many questions that went unanswered.

As for what Matthew Fox stands for; he says that he wants to bring grass 
roots spirituality back to the Church.  His brand of Christianity, that he 
called "Creation Spirituality" places Christ as a mystical symbol, 
apparently on par with pagan godesses, modern cosmology, eastern 
philosophy...whatever it is that people use to connect themselves with 
essence of existence.  The important thing is that we are all a part of 
Creation and that we get in touch, through ritual, to the mystical and 
spiritual essence of all creation.  This more holistic approach to 
spirituality conjures up environmental issues and seems to run counter to 
the dulaistic nature of conventional Christainity that has separated 
worshippers from their God and has resulted in the spiritual alienation 
many of the masses seem to be suffering from these days.  OK, I can go 
along with that.  I can't, of course, speak for his fellow Episcopalians.

Matthew Fox is very enthusiastic about raving.  More than once he called us 
"revolutionaries" and even explained which Chakras raving addresses.  I
was rather impressed with the depth of his convictions here, especially
since the only rave he's ever attended one of the Sheffield Chistain-based
ones in the UK.  He deferred some of our questions about the planned
rave-masses to the Sheffield folks who would actually be putting them on.  
The one thing he did know was that the rave-masses would have a definate
Christain slant to them. 

We told him about our concern with using raving as a tool to deliver dogma,
and about our general dislike of the Christ theme, with all of its
associated baggage through its links to modern Christianity.  Although we
had to admit that *some* thematic content gets preached at our raves, we
tried to explain that the rather generic and abstract nature of such
content (i.e. unity, acceptance, etc.) allows the spiritual experience (if
any) to remain a deeply personal and individual one.  I think he heard us,
but he never answered our question of *why* the Christ thing is still so
important to him, or why it is so important to deliver a Christ-specific
message at a rave.  

The point was also made that there has not been a lot of success in
duplicating the Sheffield rave-masses in other parts of the UK.  San
Francisco was chosen because of the existing sense of community they
felt existed here.  At the same time, it is understood that Sheffield, 
being very economically depressed and blue collar, is a much different 
kind of community.  

Although none of us had expressed such a concern, Matthew made the point 
that they were not trying to "compete" with the existing rave scene here. 
Throughout the discussion, Matthew referenced various aspects of our 
previously expressed backgrounds, making sure to exhibit his deference 
for the African American Churches, Jewish influences and modern science.  
But he referenced a lot of other cultures as well, so my thinly veiled 
accusation here of pandering *might* be a little unfair.

We spent a bit of time on the use of psychedelics.  He basically attributed
his anti-drug quote in the newspapers to the Sheffield people's work with  
recovering addicts.  Matthew himself didn't seem to have much of a problem 
with the use of psychedelics, and accepted our testimonials about their 
benefits and agreed that they could be useful when used in the proper 
context.  He did object to the use of psychedelics as "fast-food" 
spirituality, however, and argued for the importance of ritual for building
a community.

When Cliff declared the meeting to be over, it was clear that many issues
were left unanswered.  He did not address the concern I had expressed about
the possibility that he was just being used by his church as bait for
bringing in fresh recruits.  Even if Matthew's intentions are sincere, this 
really isn't just *his* game, is it?  It isn't at all clear as to what the 
relationship between the Sheffield promoters and the rest of the rave
community will be, if any.  Are they going to allow flyers for _Wicked_ to
be placed in the basement of Grace Cathedral?   We expressed the desire to
talk some more, and I invited Matthew to come to _In The Light_, but he'll 
be touring Europe on a book tour for the next couple of months.

In the end, my mixed emotions about the unaddressed issues and about 
Matthew Fox himself left me feeling uneasily neutral.  Historically,
Christianity has adopted or embellished the rituals of other cultures for
the explicit purpose of winning over new members.  It is also not uncommon
for large institutions to allow for the odd renegade to operate within
their midsts as a symbol of liberalism and openmindedness while the
ongoing perpetuation of oppression and mass manipulation continues unabated.

Ultimately, the SF Bay Area rave scene will continue to do it's thing, 
Fox will do his, the Sheffield folks theirs, and the Church theirs.  It 
remains to be seen whether any of the agendas of these groups will coincide 
with each other in a meaningful or positive way.

There are two Sasha CD's that I know of, one is a collection of remixes
he's done for other artists and one is of his own tracks. The newer one is
called "The Qat Collection" and is probably what is being referred to. I
forget what the remix collection is called - it came out 8-10 months ago.

Here's a couple of events for this week (b4 the next calendar):

Pepper - Come celebrate Alfie's birthday!  Monday, May 9th down in
the den with DJs Chris Lum and Reuben.  510 Larkin, 21+, free before
11 w/invite.

Royal Boom - Every Wednesday Night at 683 Clementina (between Folsom
and Howard @ 8th).  Hours: 10pm-6am.  $5 before midnight, $6 after.
Grand opening Wednesday May 11th - Mark Farina, Mind Motion, Thomas,
George, Roman, Suiki.

-----

I checked out Pepper last week, and it was sort of low-key, not a
whole lot of people dancing most of the night.  The space (Deco) is
cool, so it's a great place to go if you just want to hang out
somewhere with a big sound system :).  I think someone said that the
first Test happened there. It's around the corner from Miss Pearl's
Jam House, and as far as parts of the Tenderloin go, it seems
relatively serene.

   I found Lee's thoughtful evaluation of the meeting with Mathew Fox very 
enlightening. The whole affair reminded me of one of the turns that the 
psychedelic movement took during the 60s and 70s. Lots of folks were 
dissatisfied with the religion and politics of their parents' generation. 
But after immersion in the music, drugs, and total ambience of the 
counterculture, many came away just as starved for permanent values as 
they had been when they first got involved in the scene. 
  "Chopping wood before enlightenment.... chopping wood after 
enlightenment," as the Zen koan goes.
  What do you do when the party is over, the musicians have packed up 
their instruments, and the gray dawn dissipates the last ecstasy of the 
night's vision of Truth, Beauty, and Justice?
   Many -- Bob Dylan being the most visible -- returned to the faith of 
their parents. It might have been a faith newly interwoven with New Age 
trappings of the Wisdom of Coyote or Neopaganism, but it was a return to 
the faith nevertheless. No big surprises here for the historian. If 
Christianity could survive (though not unscathed) defeat at the hands of 
the Moslems, schism into protestantisms, Darwinism, and the unrelenting 
onslaught of media distractions -- should we be surprised to find some of 
Christianity's younger, hipper proponents enthusing about raves and 
finding a perfect usefulness in the movement?

Hi all, this is sort of a party report on life outside of San Francisco.
I'll keep it short.

Anyway, I spent Saturday night in El Paso, Texas, at a party called Unity.  
It was held in a dusty grimey warehouse (I love old dirty warehouse parties) 
and had a large outdoor area, too.

Between 500 and 600 people came to El Paso, from the surrounding area, from 
Albequerque (4 1/2 hour drive away), Denver (11 hour drive), Durango (12 hour 
bus ride away), and even Oklahoma (those people left on Thursday to get there). 
When people make THAT much effort to go to a party, crazy things happen (and 
some of you all think Freemont is too far :-) ).

I had been feeling rather ill that afternoon so I spent most of the party 
sleeping in a back office in the warehouse, but during the times I was mostly 
awake I could *tell* something good was going on.  DJs Intensity (from 
Albequerque) and Wisc (from Houston) were going really strong.  Intensity 
put down a mixture of breakbeat, trance, and even a tiny bit of acid, and Wisc 
with a variety of breakbeat styles.  Every so often some of the local kids 
would wander back to the office I was in, and we'd sit around talking.  Like 
the rest of the US except for San Francisco, these people ranged from their
late teens to early twenties.  I met a few older sibling/younger sibling pairs, 
where a 19 or 21 year old had brought along a 15 or 16 year old sibling.  It 
was kind of neat because the younger kids were wide-eyed and energetic but 
didn't seem all lost and clueless.

The really young ones and the small club-and-fashion crowd cleared out around 
2am (the party had started at 9).  I had thought -- being in Texas -- that 
there would be a lot of beer around, but judging from the TINY number of 
empties I saw in with all the usual trash on the floor, there wasn't much 
alcohol at all.

Around midnight I woke myself up and hung out around the dance floor.  The 
warehouse was packed and people were really dancing hard, using their squirt 
guns to cool off (and for water fights in the outside area).  I, however, had 
never spun in front of that many people, and immediately came down with the 
absolute worst case of stage fright ever.  I looked in the bathroom mirror:  I 
was pale as a ghost.  I had heart palpitations and felt like looking for an 
airsick bag.  I was scared.  My turn on the decks came and I got down to work.  
After setting up my first two records I looked up and couldn't see the dance 
floor because about 25 people (evenly distributed between men and women) were
watching me intently.  Fortunately, about 2 tracks later, they were all dancing,
so I got over my shock and things went on quite normally from there.  

The party continued on till a bit after 7am.  By that time there were about 50 
people left, and some of them were skateboarding or roller blading around the 
warehouse while others were sharing donuts and juice for breakfast while still 
others danced to some happy silly disco spun by Shawn (also of Albequerque).  
The smile factor was high . . . overall people were very friendly and so very 
warm and nice to me.  The whole night gave me a much-needed boost in terms of 
my attitude toward the rave scene in general.  Here was a well-done party with 
a deadicated happy sharing energetic crowd that was lots of fun.  So anyway, 
there *IS* rave life out there in what could almost be thought of as unexpected
parts of the US, and it's doing quite well.

For personal research I would like to know if raving (ie liking to rave) 
can be correlated in any way with homosexuality.  I do not want to 
make a sweeping statement, but it does seem to me that a lot of male 
ravers are gay.  Any feedback?

actually, bob dylan kinda 'roamed' the spiritual/religious landscape.
he's jewish - his birthanme is zimmerman - and he did the xtian thing for
a while, then he was going to some jewish orthodox schul.
more importantly, i disagree  with you that xtianity is a foundation to which
people want to return. i think it is more the case that people never
achieve 'escape velocity' to break free of xtianity, and are pulled back,
to be crushed back on impact. the 'return' to xtianity of the flower
people did not consitute a triumph a further exploration of spirituality,
but an admission of defeat, a retreat into 'olde' values, which came with
the reaction of the late 70's. for xtianity to be able to incorporate
the spiritual elements whichi would allow us to grow , it would have to
change so drastically as to (almost) cease to BE xtianity! certainly,
mainstream xtianity can't do that. perhaps some other variations, like
gnosticism or some such variation could do it. at any rate, it would
ba a sex-positive, body-positive version of it. also tolerant of
the variety of human existence, feminist in some form, gay -affirmative.
anuyway, i have a hard time seeing all of this in present day xtianity.
but i might be wrong.

i can't believe i'm quoting an Ann Landers article, but here goes; it
  looked just rite for the raves list...


here's what Ghandi said were the 7 basic roots of violence (as relayed
   by his grandson, Arun Gandhi:

     Wealth without Work.
     Pleasure without Conscience.
     Knowledge without Character.
     Commerce without Morality.
     Science without Humanity.
     Worship without Sacrifice.
     Politics without Principles.

once again, i can't believe i found anything this deep wading thru this
   particular segment of the paper; who'd a thunk?

seeya!

I know this is a common practice among ravers.  When people touch the
water bottles with their lips, are they going to be "infecting" it?  I
like sharing water but I don't want to be spreading anything but love.

Unfortunately, if that's what they think, you've got an uphill battle before
you. My suggestion is to try and make them understand that many promoters arein this to make a buck so why would they spike something with opium when it'sso expensive? (Opium, for christ's sake? OPIUM? PLEASE!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was gonna point out the same thing but not that it's just expensive, it's
not realy around.  Most opium poppies are used for the more lucrative
heroine trade and nobodies gonna realy make or import much opium.

i may be wrong but i don't think arguing about the cost of opium is gonna 
help you win any fight with your parents. 

tell them that you like raving because of the music...because ravers are 
generally not drinkers and alchohol makes people violent while most 
ravers are friendly...that a night of dancing is more fun and much 
healthier than watching tv or going to a movie.

tell them that you see drugs in plenty of places beside raves, and if 
they are anti-drug, tell them that you are smart enough to 'just say no' 
and that they don't need to worry about you, you're a respobsable 
individual and if they don't trust you, you'll never be able to grow up 
on your own. that the crap about opium, tell them it was just 
sensalionalist garbage and that it doesn't really happen. if they don't 
believe you, tell them you don't like smart drinks anyway and that you 
only drink from the water fountain.

try to reason with them, but i wouldn't suggest fighting with them, it 
rarely works for me.

in the "early days" (1991) of raving in San Francisco, at most events i could  
see individuals, couples, and small groups of males that triggered my gaydar,  
sometimes subtly and sometimes blatantly.  not many - still a minority - but  
visible, and happly accepted by all, so it seemed.  i have a biased feeling  
that the gay males there set a high example for energetic, frolicking,  
creative, uninhibited dancing.

[the earliest well-integrated event i recall in SF had its brief life during  
my first year of living in the city, 1990, before i had ever heard the word  
rave in this context.  it was a thursday night gig called "Recess", produced  
by doc martin, who then lived in SF.]

one of the things that most appealed to me (a gay male) in that scene was that  
i could go to events in the company of *any* of my friends, not just the gay  
ones or the straight ones who would feel a bit out-of-place in a gay dance  
club.

so it seemed to me, the scene grew straighter after Toon Town hit it big (new  
year's eve 1991-92).  when Care*Free (a saturday weekly) began at 177  
townsend, it drew (by design) a mostly hip-gay crowd, with a sizeable,  
comfortable minority of straight ravers.  even the gay component was  
well-integrated w/ lesbians and gay males both, a combination unusual in SF  
clubs.  [fond memories of hot, sweating, smiling, energy...]  when the "other"  
big, more ordinary-club-like, less rave-like saturday night gay weekly  
("Colossus") closed, Care*Free was flooded with the Colossus crowd and became  
less rave-like.

since Care*Free closed and continuing to the present, it has seemed to me that  
the SF rave scene is mostly straight, or if there's a sizeable gay component,  
it's no longer visible to me as such.  i still find people in the scene to be  
uniformly gay-positive, and completely accepting of M-M and F-F affection.

That being said, why do you think there isn't more integration between the two
scenes? Do you think that there is asome apprehension in the gay community,
or do you think it might be a function of us over- analyzing it?

Thanks for the excellent report and comments, lee.  I found your
concerns to be very clearly expressed and well-founded.  

The separation between the sacred and secular is not always so great
as in our society.  In many other cultures, rituals (defined broadly
as social activities with a definite order or sense of performance,
and with broad participation) have elements of both . . . or at least
the same participants.  Remember that early scene in 'The Harder They
Come' with the choir and band rockin' and the churchgoers going into
various trance-like states?  The same people may have been out late
the previous same night drinking and dancing with the same musicians
playing somewhat different music . . . and so on.

I wonder along with you about the gulf between the organized, bureaucratic
church (which Fox is definitely a part of culturally and professionally,
even if he is not ideologically aligned with them) and the purely secular
(if spiritually-inclined) traditions involved in the r*** scene.  

In the early 1960s, this was an issue too.  With Vatican II came a
cultural revolution in the Catholic Church.  With a great deal of struggle
over turf and doctrine, a lot of local parishes began experimenting with
'folk masses' where acoustic guitars and newer rewrites of old hymns
supplanted the traditional organ and choir.  

Now, it so happens my dad was a choir director at our local parish. 
While he was in favor of opening up the liturgy (this is in the earliest
days right after the mandatory Latin mass was being gradually turned over
to English and other modern languages, remember), he was pretty appalled
at the cheesy folk-liturgical music being churned out by earnest sincere
seminarians.  There was some good stuff, too, but it was certainly not
easy finding things that were liturgically and musically compatible.
In other words, as in all things quality was scarce.  

Through a variety of events, he was dropped as director of our parish
choir (although he was hired back several years later), but a very
fortunate thing happened.  Although we were in DC, he linked up with a
progressive parish in Baltimore who had a brilliant cantor, Matt Frehling,
but needed a choir director.  So that's how we found ourselves trundling
up the Balt-Wash Parkway every Sunday morning to this black parish in
Baltimore (St. Gregory), where they had this amazing choir and this 
amazing music combining traditional Catholic hymns, things borrowed from
the black Protestant churches, some of the new folk-based stuff and some
of my dad's own compositions.  In the upheavals of 1963, amidst both
Vatican II and the zenith of the civil rights movement, this was pretty
amazing stuff, and I'm sure though it wasn't apparent to me as a kid
that it was also risky to people's livelihoods and community stature as
church participants and employees.  We still have some great 15 ips
tapes of some of the singing and music from that time.  Amazing stuff.

And to complete the story, my sister ended up being in our local parish
folk group, singing Catholic hymns and 'Precious Lord' and who knows
what else every Sunday.  And somehow it actually worked out OK, because
that too was grounded in the time and the community and expressed the
very apparent need to develop new liturgical forms that reflected the
experience and background of the participants.

But it certainly didn't come down as an edict from the Archdiocese:
you WILL have folk masses and you WILL enjoy it -- which is how most
of their edicts came down then and now.  Quite the opposite, it was
a contrarian stance and one that got a lot of resistance from the
less freewheeling suburban churches that dominated the internal
hierarchy.  

I say all this because the call on the question of whether to get
involved with or approve of Fox's proposed 'rave masses' is not a
simple one.  What it really gets down to is whether there is an
*authentic* experience that can be developed, even out of seemingly
widely variant cultural practices such as organized religion and
organized raving.  Of course, we have already seen that the underlying
incipient links between trance/dance/spirituality/music are definitely
there.  But it is so easy for hype to overcome and crush the fragile
syncretic bonds that must be built in order to find the common ground.

I haven't been an active participant in the Catholic Church since high
school, but I have to say those Sunday morning masses at St. Gregory's
in Baltimore expressed and developed the feeling of community and
commitment like nothing else I've seen since  . . . except for those
moments at 5 am when you're looking around you all over the floor
with the music going like THAT and people going off like THIS and
you can *see* the Awareness Quotient just zooming up.

So, though I was unable to meet Mathew Fox and really am likely to be
at best on onlooker on this developing story, it's of great interest
to see where it might lead.  I am quite skeptical, I must say, but I've
also learned it's important never to say "never" to a new idea, a new
way of linking people together and reaching to to reinvigorate the deep
connections we need to help overcome the deteriorating relationships
among people and between us and our environment that threaten us all.

And that's my Jeremiad for the week, the Philippic has been cancelled :-)

   It seems,from my admittently limited viewpoint- that the gay and other
non-mainstream communities are drawn into the rave scene by a vibrant- "on"
feeling that the rave scene is a place of creativity and free expression..
(Which was true at the beginning..and has remained more or less true 
through the last few years..depending on where you go..
 When an environment gets over-popular or too populated by the hunter-gatherer
/ thrill-seekers..it just doesnt offer the
space to attract the fun and wierd of any persuasion..

By the way, I was standing around recently when a Hemp Initiative
volunteer approached Tom Hayden (I'm a volunteer on his campaign) and
talked to him briefly about his meeting with Matthew Fox. According to
Hayden, Matthew Fox said although he supported the legalization of
marijuana, he wouldn't sign the petition. Hayden didn't know Fox's
reasons (Hayden, by the way, did sign the petition a while back, in
case you're wondering).

I realize that this information is third-hand at best, but together
with everything else I've heard about Fox, I think that his opinions
on drug use in general are not very well formed, and he's somewhat
ambivalent at best about the spiritual and recreational uses of 
psychedelics. I wonder if anyone's offered him a good "controlled"
(whatever that means) psychedelic experience so he can form his own
judgements?

I think there are several reasons (and more, i'm sure) why things are less
integrated than some of us would like.  Speaking as an authority on the 
subject :) , there is one obvious thing at issue: promotion.  at gay and
lesbian oriented events, i rarely see "rave" flyers, ditto the reverse
direction.  there are notable exceptions, but those exceptions tend to be
the mega-events.  

it is also the case that promoters of gay events rarely promote at non-gay
places because of a sense of proprietorship.  there have been many folks
and regular events that have changed dramatically because of a wider appeal.
many gays and lesbians recall with some sorrow some favored club that "went
straight".  there is a whole rash of emotions attending that experience
which i won't get into, because many of them are heterosexist. a case in
point is Uranus, which went from being a very underground thing to being
extermely aboveground, and a home for suburban gawkers who went around
making rude remarks about the folks who went there from the beginning;
such experiences do tend to drive out the group that makes a party "fun".

it is also the case that few heterosexual promoters promote at gay
and lesbian places, often because of simple ignorance.

as a gay male, i can also say that i am often wary of groups of more than
two young straight unknown men, especially adolescents.  it's a safety
thing...getting harassed or bashed because i'm wearing or acting something 
"out of the ordinary" is the last thing i want if i'm enhanced and in strange
surroundings. folks can be the nicest people on earth, but i don't necessarily
know that, and i'm generally not willing to risk my well-being for a momentary
thrill.  harassment or bashing is much less likely at gay or lesbian focussed
events---numbers and security see to that.

finally, we mustn't forget simple statistics. even though i'm from san 
francisco (the supposed gay and lesbian mecca), the overall statistics
suggest there are fewer gays and lesbians to go around....by a factor 
of almost 10. so many parties, so little time! :)

My experience indicates just the opposite.  I was an atheist for a while 
but found that I was a much happier person when I had faith.  Hence, I 
returned to Christianity (what's the point of putting an x over Christ's 
name anyway?) not because I was "sucked in against my will" but because I 
chose to return for the spiritual benefits I received.

Many of us who lean toward the hetero end of the spectrum really miss
the days when house music parties were more mixed in their sexual
orientations.  I was at the End-Up recently, and the vibe there was
*great*.   Some _In The Light_ teasers have already been distributed 
there (thanx Cap'n), and we plan to do some serious flyering there.  

I had a pretty good time at Carefree a couple of years ago, and the sexual 
focus of that party wasn't nearly as much of a put-off for me as the 
uptight heterosexual meat-market atmosphere i've experienced at many strayt 
clubs.  I think there's a very special joy that comes out whenever people 
who have been oppressed/repressed get to be in an atmosphere where they 
can be accepted for who they really are.

>ravers are gay.  Any feedback?

in the "early days" (1991) of raving in San Francisco, at most events i could  
see individuals, couples, and small groups of males that triggered my gaydar,  
sometimes subtly and sometimes blatantly.  not many - still a minority - but  
visible, and happly accepted by all, so it seemed.  i have a biased feeling  
that the gay males there set a high example for energetic, frolicking,  
creative, uninhibited dancing.

[the earliest well-integrated event i recall in SF had its brief life during  
my first year of living in the city, 1990, before i had ever heard the word  
rave in this context.  it was a thursday night gig called "Recess", produced  
by doc martin, who then lived in SF.]

one of the things that most appealed to me (a gay male) in that scene was that 

i could go to events in the company of *any* of my friends, not just the gay  
ones or the straight ones who would feel a bit out-of-place in a gay dance  
club.

so it seemed to me, the scene grew straighter after Toon Town hit it big (new  
year's eve 1991-92).  when Care*Free (a saturday weekly) began at 177  
townsend, it drew (by design) a mostly hip-gay crowd, with a sizeable,  
comfortable minority of straight ravers.  even the gay component was  
well-integrated w/ lesbians and gay males both, a combination unusual in SF  
clubs.  [fond memories of hot, sweating, smiling, energy...]  when the "other" 

big, more ordinary-club-like, less rave-like saturday night gay weekly  
("Colossus") closed, Care*Free was flooded with the Colossus crowd and became  
less rave-like.

since Care*Free closed and continuing to the present, it has seemed to me that 

the SF rave scene is mostly straight, or if there's a sizeable gay component,  
it's no longer visible to me as such.  i still find people in the scene to be  
uniformly gay-positive, and completely accepting of M-M and F-F affection.

Hmmm. Many interesting points of view here... I don't know if I have a
definitive POV because I'm still trying to figure it all out. I guess
currently I'm suspicious of most "religions" but consider my life to be
intensely "spiritual".   That said, an argument could be made that what
I call "spirituality" is just my form of "religion", if so, then I
definitely feel like I'm "rolling my own" :).

As far as Christ/X -ianity is concerned, like many African-Americans, I
was "christened" in an Xian church (Many neo-pagan types use Xian
instead of Christian to seperate what they feel is some form of hateful
shame that is passing itself off as "Christianity" but has _nothing_ to
do with the spirit of what Christ/Jesus actually taught which IMHO is
pure trancendental Love, Christ would never have burned witches) and
was "confirmed" around the age of 12 at First A.M.E. Zion church in
Brooklyn N.Y.  Even as a child I marvaled at the whole of Creation and
how intricate it all was.  I remember having a couple of peak religious
experiences, but never in the church, being the precocious lad that I
was, I began to wonder why this was so.  By the time I was 14, I was
Out of the Church, I knew that there was a divine (I could see it in
action all around me) but it seemed that the people "in the church" had
lost contact (or never had it in the first place), I also noticed a lot
of judgement and condemnation in the church and I couldn't reconcile
this with the words of Jesus that I read in the Bible, (I used to read
the New Testiment a lot, especially Revelations, which scared and
fascinated me at the same time) Around this same time I had my first
psychedelic experience which only made me realize how little I knew
about reality (and also how much there was to know)  I guess I started
"On the Path" as some would say.

	There was always a lot of what some would call "lower psychism" in my
family.  My relatives, young and old were always "seeing things" and having
dreams of dead "ancestors" and relatives whould would give them messages
(mostly daily numbers :), this was so common that I took it all for granted and
assumed this was the norm, it wasn't until many years later that I found out
this was not the case.  Any way, I began to study vast and wide areas of what
some people would call "The Occult", mostly very basic things like numerology,
astrology, gemitria, palmistry, etc.  But quickly delved into deeper studies 
such as Tarot, Symbology and the finer, more technical and psychological aspects
of Astrology.  All the while I still considered myself a Christian (I didn't 
believe in any foolish concept of forbidden knowledge, and quickly realized
that this was a scam perpetuated by the priests/rabbis to keep the populace
under their control) even though I didn't go to church much.  I flirted with
ceremonial magic but I didn't want anything bad enough to work magic to get it
and I though it was wrong (bad karma) to bend someone to your will just for
your own selfish ends so I sort of fell out of it.  After I moved to Baltimore
I became involved with a "spiritual community" called Savitria where I learned
how to meditate, became exposed to Theosophy, Rudolph Steiner and more advanced
Aspects of Astrology, Tarot and Kaballah.  It was around my 16 th birthday that
I had an extremely intense spiritual experience.  I had stayed home from school
to Trip (something I used to do often) and listen to music, (I was always a 
raver, I used to just do it alone :).  I had just finished listening to 
"Close to the Edge" by Yes and was sitting in lotus position on the floor in
front of my speakers in a very relaxed trippy state, it was a beautiful
sunny summer day and as I gazed ahead of me, I became aware of a tiny-tiny
green bug sitting on the table right in front of my head, as I watch it I became
aware of the life that was this little animal, and the consciousness that 
animated that life, and then I realized that the same force that animated that 
bug, animated and emanated through me... It is hard to explain what happened
next but lets just say that I was everywhere and nowhere at the same time,
actually time had nothing to do with it because I was at the beginning and
at the end and everyplace in between.  For a few seconds or minutes (I don't
know which) I was one with Eternity.  When I came back to earth I was totally
blown away, all of creation was humming and buzzing around me and everything 
shown with an intense light.  I layed down on the carpet in a complete state
of Bliss.  As I was lying there, I became aware of a distinct "sound" sort
of like a tuning fork but much clearer, it seemed to come from everywhere
and inside of me at the same time, in fact it emanated from a place whose 
co-ordinates were at right angles to every co-ordinate in 3-space (I know
this doesn't make sense) as I closed my eyes to listen more intently I became
aware of this "point of light" that seemed to be in the middle of my head,
right between my eyes (where the "third eye" is supposed to be I guess) as
I merged with the sound, the light got brighter and became a small sun.
By this time I was completely wigged out but I had been tripping for several
years and knew the difference between acid hallucinations and this wasn't
one of them, (the dosage that I had taken was relatively low any ways)
well this experience changed my life, I knew it was real because it persisted
for about three days after the trip had worn off.  Occasionally over the years
it has returned but I've had other experiences that were different but
no less compelling since then.  If you begin to study a wide range of world
religions you soon realize that "There is no religion greater than Truth"
to coin the Theosophist motto but more importantly no religion has the complete
story, each one is just a vehicle or viewport to view the Divine from, some
viewports are more suited to different observers at different times in their 
lives but they are viewports never the less, this applies to things like
Big Science (which is very much a religion complete with demi-gods and dogma)
as well as Xian fumdementalism. As far as the Christ and all of that, most folks
(including the atheist) have believed the hype put out by the Church.  Some
would say that my experience was a blast of Christ consciousness, in this
context, what Matthew Fox and his co-horts are getting at makes sense, forget 
about the cross and all that other stuff, most of which the average person 
doesn't understand any more then they understand what happens on the dancefloor at 4 a.m. When you LIVE the Christ Energy THAT is the shit! IMHO Chirst/Jesus
was just dude cruising around with his Chakras fully open and beaming.  If you
have studied any of the various stories/myths legends and FACTS of the indian
subcontinent, then you would realize that the stuff that Jesus did was no big
deal on the level of moving psychic energy.  When your channels are open
and the kundalini/shakti is Boomin' many thing are possible, that is why he said
"And greater things than I have done, ye shall do also".  So I would say
to paraphrase one of my teachers, the choice is really an individual one,
are you gonna spend your time Hating the Church? or are you gonna spend your 
time Loving all of Creation?  Would you all feel better if instead of Matthew
talking about the Cosmic Christ he replaced it with the Cosmic Gel-Cap?
It's all one and the same, the baggage that is present is want you take with
you.  If you look back into the history of humanity, _every group_ has done
so much fucked up shit that they should not have a right to live, and if you
dwell on it, then you might as well give up now.  But part of the message
is that of forgiveness, THIS IS NOT OBEDIENCE, some fucked-up church official
dupted you into thinking that they are one and the same, THEY ARE NOT.
Perfect Love does not mean that you have to tolerate abuse and violence, what it
does mean is that you don't take retribution, when it is your turn to be on top.
(This is where many Xians and other members of large denominatoions go wrong)
They actually start to believe that shit that they are "God's" choosen people
(not that they aren't but they forget that their enemies are as well :) and
start to act out their image of God. So much evil in the world is done in the
name of good, think about your own interactions with children and animals and
see if this rings true,  how often do we become absolute tyrants over beings
that we have ultimate control over?  Is this any better or worse than 
what the Church/Temple  has done to Us?

Well after this rant you might think that I'm comming out in support of
Christianity which I'm not, in fact I think that Judaeo-Christianity in it's
present form is at the root of a lot of the world's problems, but not all.
I dare say that it would be a lot better if Buddist dominated the world but
I could be wrong.  I think fundementally the big difference in the world is
between the people that experience the direct divine essence of LOVE and people
who have not or cannot have that experience.  I myself am pretty much a Goddess
or Divine Mother worshiper (I see Her in all of her forms from Shakti to Kali,
from Hecate to Venus, from Gaia to Nut), mostly it's just a metaphor that I can
access reality from, sorta like a programming language is used to access
the power of a computer, I guess you can always program in assembly language
but that is not always the best choice, (Is C++ beter than LISP?, maybe for 
some things and for some people, times and places but not all) this IMHO is the
same with religious cosmologies.  Pick one and start coding :)

Um, just being pedantic, but Christ is a title, not a name.  It means
"the Annointed One".

Now, instead of arguing about whether Tanya went back to the Church of her
own free will or whether she got sucked back in, I'd like to ask
exactly why she thinks she feels happier in the church, other than
something vague about how having faith feels good.  Also, what exactly
do you mean by having faith?  Is there some kind of removal of
earthly responsibility involved?  

I'm sorry if the above sounds sarcastic, it's not meant that way.

I think the central thing is just that by and large
raving is a straight scene. Ravers have a tendency
to be cooler about sexuality issues than society at
large, but that doesn't mean you are gonna draw a 
large number of queer folk from queer events.

To me, spirituality is beyond the realm of cognitive explanation or 
understanding.  I have found that if I am in tune to the-god-within, then 
I will follow the best path laid out for me.  Consequently, I cannot 
explain why I think I feel happier, only that I do.  I feel this is my 
path because the-god-within is pleased.  I see myself making progress in 
all areas of my life.
It works for me.


  Also, what exactly

No.  Faith to me is at the end of intellectual masterbation, so to 
speak.  Its a spectrum.  Essentially after all the mental arguements with 
myself and with others,  it comes down to this: intellectual 
understanding is irrelevant.  I must believe that what I perceive is for 
real and that what I think and experience is valid.  I must trust in my 
experiences and in what I perceive as truth.  I only stipulate that this 
faith in my view of myself and my relation to the universe and God 
pertain to me, and is not something I need to force on others.
And I don't.

Nothing wrong with this in my little hedonistic brain.  Why should you have

Yep.  And this comes from greed, one of the TRUE "roots of violence", which

All politicians have principles, it's just a matter of what they are and

Steven Hill (of Windham-Hill record label) dedicated a whole hour of
his weekly syndicated space/ambient/new age radio show "Music from
the Hearts of Space" to Aphex Twin (Richard James) last week.  It's
pretty uncommon that the show is dedicated to one artist, usualy it's
a compilation show based on a theme such as "Celtic Twilight" and then
they'll play celtic influenced stuff from various artists or something.
As you could guess, he played stuff from Selected Ambient Works volumes
I and II.  At the end of the show when the play list is read and commentary
is given by Steven Hill he attributed James' success to his "not being
afraid to keep it simple".  Over and out.

Exactly.  
This is the "leap of faith" beyond any personal, logical, moral, belief
system we operate under.  Faith has to be defined as beyond all
intellectual understanding or rationale.  By this measure, faith is
usually beyond words.  A personal experience.  No logical system can prove
any kind of god idea (old man in sky or oneness with universe) - it
fundamentally requires faith.

I think eastern religion (buddhism) addresses this in a more straight
forward manner than western religion.  Christian thinking along these
lines is much newer (this century) but has been explored.  The buddhist
riddles (Koans?) are designed to overload the conscious moment, to 
destroy the mask, to break your logical systems down and give you pure
insight into the universe - existing as part of it or all of it at once.

This suggests a more ancient understanding of faith as beyond intellect.
And in turn, creates a historically wider separation between religion 
and politics (a very good thing).

Nevertheless, I believe that where you place your faith is still arbitrary.  
East vs West (god) is a non-question.

Any person will be influenced by the political history and
ceremonial trappings of a religion.  These differences between
major religions of the world are very real.

Ooooommmmm,
Dave

I ran into someone today in the MU: Mike Sheehan, my supervisor for
SESAP, the Student Educators in Substance Abuse Prevention. I am
currently in training to be such a counselor.

SOme time ago, about four weeks, I would guess, Mike Sheehan found out
from me that I have a drug-information database on my account at
UC Davis on the Storer Sun file system (dale.ucdavis.edu, etc.) He
promptly called me to his office to discuss the "appropriateness"
of a potential SESAP intern having such information readily available
_and_ making it available to the public on request. The latest file
listing and caveats relating to my archive can be found by fingering
ez026264@othello.ucdavis.edu

Mr. Sheehan and I met today by chance in the Memorial Union complex
on campus and he mentioned that the day before (yesterday, May 3,
1994, Tuesday) he had talked to Jeanne Wilson of UCD's Student Judicial
Affairs Office regarding my file archive. According to Mr. Sheehan, his
supervisor found my archive somehow distasteful and/or threatening and
contacted Jeanne Wilson. There is now a letter en route from Student
Judicial Affairs to my residence calling me for an appointment, though
I made an appointment with Ms. Wilson promptly upon hearing this
information from Mr. Sheehan. The appointment is scheduled for
Friday, May 13, 1994 at 11:00 am. A possibility that was discussed
between Mr. Sheehan and myself was a change to Information Technologies
policy to disallow the keeping of such an archive on my account.

I would like to know what my rights and responsibilities are regarding
this situation, as well as Information Technologies' opinion on this
matter. It seems to me that censoring my archive by disallowing the
keeping of certain files that one organization finds distasteful,
while the archive obviously does not present a threat to the security
of Information Technologies' hardware or software, is simply not
right.

Please contact me as soon as possible on this matter.

Thank you,

   I understand nobody likes shameless self-promoting, but that's not 
what I am trying to do :)...  I've been spinning house/tribal and some 
trance for about 2.5 years now.  Most of it has been on my weekly radio 
shows, but I try and do as many local (Monterey) events as I can.  
Anyways, I'm moving up to San Fran next year (going to USF) and I want to 
get to know some more people, so if you're interested in hearing one of 
my tapes, just drop me some mail and I'll get one off to you as soon as I 
can.  I'd appreciate perhaps another tape in return or just some comments :)
 
  Anyways, I have two tapes right now, one is called "Got House?" and the 
other is "D O S E m
          e T O t h
          e N E X T
          l e v e l"

  You can probably guess what type of sounds you'll hear on each tape :)

  I hope to be meeting more of you guys in the future :)

  Peace out.. DJ Deaks

(Courtney) said aloud  -  "Are you guys sure you're not looking for
ThunderDome the Gay Club that's on around the back - King St." 

I find this really insulting, especially when I have being going to Wicked
for so long now that I practically know half the crowd and I generally hang
out with 15-20 other men/women who happen to be gay/lesbian/bi/don't care 
that have also frequented Wicked for just as long.  

I kinda felt like Wicked was unique where people didn't care; it was above
all that crap/attitude that you get at regular straight/gay clubs. Ah well.


So I felt like saying to the organizer  "F**k you asshole, this is San
Francisco not Kansas" but I resisted and recalled that last time Wicked was
at Townsend (about 2 months ago) there was also jerks on the door(with metal
detectors) but not quite as insulting/segregationist.

P.S.  I did had a great time, was introduced to Markie (God) and successfully
blanked the door insults.

I am going to be in Europe in a few weeks.  I'm looking for something to do
while I'm there, especially on Saturday nite, June 4 in London.  If you
know anyone who is plugged into the underground scene (preferably on the
net so I can e-mail them) I'd sure appreciate the help.

My itinerary will be:

-  Tue morning, May 31 to Sat afternoon, June 4 in Paris
-  Sat evening, June 4 to Sun afternoon, June 5 in London (And no, I can't
make it in on Friday nite for the Megadog all-nighter at Oscillate in B'ham
for HIA, Sun Electric and (ob)Orbital (spinning only) :-<   )

I'll be there the next week too, but I don't think I'll have time for anything.

Thanks in advance,

Not that the gay scene in Orange County is anything like that in SF
(and not that one really should say THE gay scene, when there are scenes
and people and etc., but anyhow...)

On the gay night for the club that is across the street from me
there is a definite 'gay men only, thank you' type attitude
where women get dirty looks for existing in that space

this is not THE problem, but A problem...

another is the comment 'well thats pretty much a GAY club, you know...'
as if it were a bad thing

and i've heard that said about a lot of clubs in the LA area
there was one club where the owner was quite prowd that the
crowd was a third gay (with a tinge of lesbian) on a nite
not really advertised as such
that was a good nite, with lots of energy beign provided by the gay men
that wasnt there without them

point being...??

i dunno.. how many gay/lesbians that you know who dont go raving do you invite?
and if they dont want to, is it that they dont like raving or
something else?

The New Moon party is tonite - in a house in Albany.  DJ's are to be
Dante, M Normal, Graham plus surprize (d?) djs...

This party is also an engagement party for Glen and Heather (yay!) as
well as a celebration of today's eclipse and the new moon.  Bring
toys and food-to-share, if you like!  Also bring an item for the altar
and/or candles, to be returned when you leave...

Oh yes, it will go from sunset to sunrise.

 I was wondering if anybody out there could tell me if I would be allowed
to bring my claves with me to MOTION tomorrow night? ( Claves are simple
percussion instruments - two sticks of dense , hard material that go "CLACK"
when struck together) . I have seen percussionists there , but I didn't know
if you had to be a "friend of the promoter" to be permitted to drum. 

 I realize that no drumming should be done within earshot of the DJ , as it
would throw off his monitoring. If I brought mine , I would stand off to the 
side with the other percussionists when I feel like playing.

 I'm especially interested in bringing them tomorrow , as I won't be
doind too much leg dancing -  one of my right leg calf muscles is achy.

 In any case , if I show up withor without claves , I'll be wearing my
Goofy (tm) t-shirt - so if you see me , say hello!

	For the Blue Cube party on saturday:

	if any of you community minded partiers would like to help
	out on saturday I would greatly appreciate it.


	we need:

	6 people to take 1 hour shifts walking out side once every
	20 minutes to make sure that no one is hanging out on the street
	or in the driveway. most often there isnt' anyone but the few times
	people start to gather its worth it to ask them to either go inside
	or hit the road.
	so thats about 10 minutes of work out of one hour to help insure
	a bustproof party....


	1 person to be a tape operator for the duel DATs.
	we are DATing each DJ- they are all playing predetermined set lenghts
	to fit on a DAT perfectly. you'll need to start recording on one
	DAT 5 min before the end of one DJs set and start recording 5 min
	before the next dj. this only requires minor audio skills which
	i will be happy to teach. watching the levels would be helpful also
	and i'd be happy to teach that. so you get free professional digital
	audio experience!

	thats it! all volunteers are welcome!

	see you all on saturday- its gonna be a blast!

Exactly.
This is the "leap of faith" beyond any personal, logical, moral, belief
system we operate under.  Faith has to be defined as beyond all
intellectual understanding or rationale.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't necessarily believe this but I might so to play devil's advocate
it could be said that faith is a big cop-out and tottaly irrational attempt
to keep beleiveing something that you want to beleive even when there is
no evidence to support your belief or even evident contrarty to your
belief.  I think I might side with Spok on this one, it seems pretty
illogical.  I believe if there is a god/creator and we are supposed to
seek it (seems like a pretty common internal drive for us) that we are
supposed to use our minds to do it and that quite possibly blind faith
makes the creator embarrased for us.  That's how I'd feel if I gave 
my creations brains and started the hide and seek game and they came up
with all these off-the-wall interpretations about my existence, killed
over different beliefs about me, and used their brains to build weapons
of war and oppresion instead of to better life for everyone and to find
a way to get off this hunk-o-rock to come find me.

But then again, maybe the opposite is true and we will never become
enlightened beings until everyone gives up rational thought and has only
faith.  I tend to believe the former though, as we've seen how much progress
we have achieved through it, even though most of it is for the wrong reasons.
At least it's proven and we know it works, we should just try to alter the
course.  What's the track record for blind faith?

Wow, what a fantastic party! We had a great location, Gregg's house
(thanks Gregg!), and lotsa visuals: slides, a laser, an altar, lots of
candles and black lights and posters and parachutes. We had my latest
and best toys ;).  We had some great ambient, trance, and progressive
house DJ work. Kenneth just blasted us with high energy progressive
house and I went nuts. We had free fruit, a carpeted floor for
barefoot dancing, and no outside interference all night long.

And best of all, we had a super friendly vibed up smile factor crowd
that turned this event into the kind one talks about for a long time.

Between the NMR, Blue Cube, YSH, and Liquid Air, you're gonna have to
work mighty hard to keep a smile off your face.

Greetings SFRavers...

I would like to know if any of you folks plan on running Bay To Breakers
this Sunday after VISION or the Blue Cube party.   

I'm thinking of running it,   but am hoping to find someone at the finish
line (or to meet someone at the Polo Fields after the race) to give me a
ride back to S. of Market after the race.    Are there busses going back
from the Polo Fields?   Just curious...   It will be my first Bay To
Breakers run,  and I plan on having a lot of fun doing it.   Although
I don't plan on making the run all the way non-stop,   instead I'll 
probably plod along,  digging all the crazy folks out there,  partying
along the way on this huge moving block party.

Amyway,  get back to me as soon as possible,  as late registration is this
Friday....

(response to Mark Guthrie's comments on faith and an attempt to
 relate this to raving)

You asked what faith was.  I think faith is belief that falls outside
of logic.  You can't prove anyone's god with logic.  Conversely, it is
pointless to use god in a logical argument (i.e. the moronic debates
about abortion where evryone is "right" cuz god says so).

This is the flaw in anyone using god to justify war or any other poltical
action.  I think we agree here.  I respect anyone's "blind faith" but I
do not recognize any moral high ground or the use of god to justify any
political action.  

Finally, I am also not suggesting that you can walk around all the time in 
some blissed out trance state, immersed in your "blind faith" without serious
consequences.  For instance, while you are marveling at the cosmic
oneness of the universe you may very well get run over by a truck.
We need to use our minds and our logic to live and survive.

This seems rave related to me.  It is important to create such a positive
"vibe" atmosphere because we are physically and psychologically vulnerable 
when tranced out or trying to achieve this state.  Regardless of the exact 
personal nature of the spiritual moment. 

Well, at least I tried to close the loop on this one ...

New Moon Review

The New Moon party was in a huge house on Albany Hill, home of 
Gregg, Jeff, Dave and Carmen.  This house is great for parties because 
even when the sound is up, you can't really hear much of anything 
outside on the street, except when the windows are open.  Also, there 
is plenty of room for dance floor (the living room) and chill space.

First, the decor:  Kenneth Paul outdid himself with the chill space.  He 
spread out these beautifully silky parachutes over a couch and 
cushions and hung more from the ceiling.  He decorated the walls 
with posters and hung a huge, beautiful cloth painting of a reclining 
woman illuminated with black lights.  The effect was cosy and warm 
and perfect for nestling and talking.  The altar -a staple of the New 
Moon party, was set up below the dj and consisted of lots of 
momentos of friendship, love, harmony and peace presided over by a 
smiling Buddha surrounded by candles.  Sean brought black lights 
and lots n' lots of toys...yay! plus some gak, which, ahem, can be 
removed from carpet only after some serious scrubbing with soap 
and warm water.  (But it's worth the trouble...)

The evening began with an absolutely fabulous ambient set by M 
Normal.  She really set the tone for the party, which by then was 
going strong with maybe forty or so people who were feeling very 
mellow and companionable.  Mona, the light behind the New Moon 
parties, is resting up back home in Mississippi, but she faxed us a 
virus questionaire which we passed out to people at the party who 
filled it out and decorated it with paints and pen.  Thanks to all those 
who responded- she is going to love these momentos of the party 
which she unfortunately could not attend.

Charles Alexander followed with another ambient set.  By the time it 
was over, we were itchin and twitchin and wanting to dance, and 
Galen satisfied our urges.  Dante spun after Galen.  His set was 
awesome, mindblowing, and had us all screaming and shouting for 
more.  By the way:  he also spins at Together on Tuesday nights at 
1015 Folsom.   Check him out!  Then Kenneth went on:  he gave us 
some funky techno that had us all sweating and shrieking some 
more.  Shortly after daybreak, Charles came on again with more 
ambient followed by Thomas, whose also ambient set mellowed us 
out and set the mood for breakfast- pancakes and eggs for the 
dedicated ones who stayed all night.  Someone else spun after that, 
but I missed it (rats) because I had to go to work.  

Thanks to everyone who came and who helped set up.  It was truly 
an organic effort with lots of people unexpectedly contributing vibe 
and creativity and who truly made this party something to 
remember.  Thanks also to Gregg & housemates who provided this 
fabulous and intimate space.   Oh yes, this party was also to celebrate 
the engagement of Heather and Glen, who will be celebrating their 
wedding at the next one June 9.  The next party will be outdoors- at 
the beach.   If you want to help out, call and leave a message at the 
Great Day Times voicemail:  415-267-3076.

First, kudos to Gregg Helt & his housemates for opening up their home for 
the New Moon party (sorry I couldn't make it).  And thanx to Anthrax
for that great review.  Is it my imagination, or has the tone and content
on SFRaves been very positive and interesting lately?  Especially when 
compared to the travesty Alt.rave has become.

I find it interesting that while the mainstream SF Bay Area House Scene 
has been going through some convulsions recently, there seems to be an
upsurge in special parties like Liquid Air, New Moon, Launch Pad and 
Blue^3.  Add these to In The Light, MESS, Spiral Jive, Atomic Dog, Freak 
Out and some others, and it becomes pretty clear that we've got a thriving 
underground scene here.  All of these free parties, put on and supported 
by people who care what raving stands for tells me that there is a very 
big heart in the House Community that is Beating harder than ever.

The other interesting thing is just how many SFRavers are involved with
these parties.  I am convinced that the communication that is fostered 
on SFRaves helps a lot of us stay clued in to the ideals of our scene.

Personally, I don't buy into the underground vs mainstream split all that
much.  The main promoters in the Bay Area seem to be pretty concientious
for the most part, and the crosspollination between the different types of
parties seems to be healthy for everyone.  SFRavers go to all types of 
parties, and in a way, some of us are like missionaries bringing the 
concepts of communication, hope, and openmindedness to others.  Most of us
don't do this in any overt or orchestrated way.  It's basically a vibe 
thing: just feeling good about ourselves, and communicating positive 
feelings to others.  How I wish there was a scene like this when *I* was 
growing up - maybe I wouldn't have spent as many years of my life hating 
the world around me so much.

Anyway, I just got the flyers for _In The Light_, and they look 
GREAT (thanx Ethan!).  _In The Light_ is going to be a chance to spread
some of our Heart to the mainstream - and we need help flyering for it.
I'll be at the Blue^3 with flyers for anyone who wants to help, especially
people who are planning to go to some big parties over the next couple of 
weeks.  Hopefully, Ethan will have some _Launch Pad_ flyers too.  This is
a fun way to get involved - to be able to invite people to free outdoor
parties being put on by people that you know.  I have to catch a plane 
early the next morning, so I'll only be there until 12 or so.  Hope to see 
you. :-)

I say "gack" because this seems so contrived and orchestrated, but who

I got this off the mtnraves list.  As Zach says, he has no idea how
legitimate it is, but here you go.  If anyone takes it upon themselves

 Z I P P Y   P R O N O I A*  T O U R   --  UPDATE / PRESS RELEASE

 (* the feeling that others are conspiring to help you)
 ____________________________________
 THE PLANET AWAITS A SIGN

 Any relatively conscious planeter has at least begun to suspect that the
 competition-based system within which human culture is currently operating
 is incapable of adapting, and needs to be re-coded.  A self-enclosed system
 cannot observe itself (i.e. it has no sense of humour)!

 The Sign for which we all yearn (so deep in our hearts that it feels like
 world angst or personal depression) must announce in a Grand and Magickal
 manner-- as far removed from he old style Business Plan as possible-- that
 WE, the relatively conscious, are a hell of a lot more numerous than even WE
 supposed.  This Sign must also demonstrate these numbers-- that, indeed, it
 is precisely because we have been increasing daily underground that the
 point has now been reached where the manifesting of such a Sign has become
 possible... and inevitable.

 For consider: this Sign, because it will alert the next fractal ring of
 increasingly conscious planeters, will precipitate unimaginable global
 social change.  Therefore, the most important questions become: from where
 in the culture could this Sign appear?  Are there already hints of it?  And,
 are YOU ready to help it happen?

 In very real, here and now terms, where is there a new cooperative cultural
 meme of sufficient and accelerating numbers into which we might usefully
 insert and apply our own skills and energies? This meme must also make its
 adherents eager to swarm together in large celebrations of new lifestyle.

                The news is good.  Very, very good.

 I see only one sociological phenomenon within Western Culture which has any
 chance of bringing about the required maximum change in the maximum number
 of people in the minimum period of time.  UK Rave Culture has been evolving
 for five years now, and at its most accelerated, the tribal rave scene has
 united the raw young idealism and enthusiasm of Rave with the eco-wisdom of
 Festival Culture to produce a mix of meltdown proportions.

 T H E   Z I P P Y, harmonised in both hemispheres of the brain,
 technoperson and hippie.

 Nobody has to give up anything-- merely start activating your ignored
 hemisphere.  Literally ALL are welcome, for all will benefit.  And its
 because everyone will be happier when the evolution has occurred that it
 will succeed.  You are invited (and very definitely needed) to make it
 happen.

[ NOTE:  I SINCERELY DOUBT this will be a rave in the "loud dance-amplified 
music" sense.  From what I've read they're just going to hang out at the
Gathering, and then continue on their journey. If they had any plan of
throwing a "traditional" rave at the Rainbow Gathering, I am sure it will 
be squelched when they meet up with the Rainbow Family ;-) It has been
stated several times that ravers/zippies are welcome at Rainbow 
Gatherings, but that the amplified music is NOT.  -- Laura ]

Hi all,
	I've been living here in DC for a year now and have been enjoying 
the scene here, but now I'm coming out there. So if some of you guys 
could send my your addresses and phone numbers maaybe, if I make it, I 
could hook up with you there as I'm only going to be there like a week 
or  something because I'm doing a tour of the States ere I return from 
whence I came, the UK. Thanks a lot guys..


			Love and Inspiration

I remember being amazed, when I first dicovered sfraves, at the degree to
which parties were analyzed. The door price, cost--or lack there of--of
water, ventilation, sound quality, door person/security courtesy level,
general vibe etc., were all thoroughly evaluated. Essential information to
any 'promoter' that actually *cared* about the people he/she expected to
come to, to pay for their party.

The value of this was not lost on me; for I realised that here was the
essential yet missing ingredient in much of our culture, indeed modern
society: a caring relationship between producer and consumer. There is
nothing inherently wrong with the producer/consumer relationship: if we are
eskimos and you build for me a kayak knowing full well that my life and my
family's well being depends on its integrity, if its constuction reflects
your love and respect for our family, then I am overjoyed to pay you, to
put the same love and respect into what I do for you, this being one of the
bases for what we might call community. In this way producer/consumer
becomes: give service, get service. Removing temporal immediacy from the
relation adds yet that much more freedom to it, as it now reflects a
deposit of trust and faith in the community, your belief that it will meet
your needs now and in the future.

Communication, feedback, trust, faith, belief.

So when it occurred to me to 'throw parties' it was with the full benefit
of the knowledge that, to do so, I would be engaging in a trusting and
caring relationship with you, the people I cared about and hoped would come
to my party, to our party, to this profound celebration of life we have
found we can create together.

Along the way I learned something really funny: the less a party cost you,
the less it cost me. "Home" cost you $15 and me $1000. "Chez Groove" cost
you $10 and me $300. At least I was making progress ;-) The obvious outcome
of this trend is that free parties cost the least: $100 gets you fliers, a
generator, a trailer to haul the sound system in, duraflame logs, blow
pops.
Split two ways it still costs less than organic ;-)  ;-) (double wink). 

But more importantly the energy is different. We all come prepared to give,
prepared to share. This is something to celebrate. 

One of my favorite parties that fell out of this approach was the first
Blue Cube party: Friends & Family. It was really an awesome demonstration
of what we (yes--sfr!) can do together. 

Ever since, I've been kinda working up to trying to do the next one. I
think we maxed out the Blue Cube on that one so I've been looking for a
space that could accomodate more of us and be in posession of the following
essential characteristics: two rooms (to support our awesome array of sfr
talent) all ages, all night, in sf, good people, good energy behind it, and
of course: low cost. Well I've found it and I'm psyched. The space is
called Komotion (many of you know it, and yes, there will be big fans
present ;-). 

Here's their blurb:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Komotion is an artist's collective, an alternative, an experiment. We are a
diverse group of musicians, writers, artists and engineers seeking to
create an environment that inspires and informs. Our multi-purpose arts
center is home to some 40 musicians who perform, rehearse and record here.
Our evening events, run by all-volunteer labor, are adventurous and bring
forward special talent. We have presented music of all kinds, art, poetry,
film, theatre, video and dance, as well as hosted numerous benefits. Our
engineers produce many recordings by emerging Bay Area artists in our
16-track studio. A core of writers works on our magazine, which provides a
forum for debate around cultural and political issues.

Komotion doesn't pay the performers at its events except to cover their
expenses. The door charge, drink prices, etc. are so low that in general,
we can only cover the rent and the basic expenses out of the events. Even
without money, however, many new acts and established artists have chosen
to perform here. Being artists ourselves, we put great care into the sound
and other aspects of the facility, to create the best possible experience
for performer and audience alike. The actual scheduling of events, editing
of the magazine, etc., is sone by committtee in a kind of anarchistic
fashion. We find things to be livelier with as few rules as possible.

Komotion has a current membership of about 300 locally and another 100 or
so internationally. At this point, our events are not "membership only" but
becoming a member is an expression of support for a center of this kind. On
our tenuous budget, *we need your support* to continue. Becoming a member
means contributing money or something neede for the Klub's operation. $5,
$10, $20, and $50 memberships are available, though donations of any amount
are welcome.

For more information: call: 415.648.4923; or email: komotion@netcom.com
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As much as I'd like to do this one absolutely free, Komotion relies on
their weekly parties to pay the rent, and IMO, they're a fantastic group of
people, and a killer space well worth our support. So the upshot is: we can
do a no-cash-up-front, very-low-cost-party ($3 at the door) that will cover
our hard expenses and have the added benefit of supporting Komotion which
has been a long standing home to tons of killer underground sf talent.

The date is set for Saturday June 18th. So far we have:

Dance:
Alex (sfr)
Ethan (sfr)
Lee (sfr)
Spun (maybe)
Tony (maybe)
And I'm gonna see if Markie is interested...

Ambient:
Meme (sfr)
Ronan (sfr)
Joe Rice (sfr)

Visuals:
Donovan

We still need visuals, beanbags, lights, furnishings etc. for the ambient
room and the dance room. If Spun, Tony, & Markie can't make it (there's a
huge Cool World offering djs megabucks at the Cow Palace that night; funny
coincidence, the last huge Cool World was the same night as the last F&F,
which, actually, wasn't a coincidence in that case) then there will be
additional DJ slots available as well. As you can see there is stil room dj
wise in the ambient room though I'm hoping M and Charles will spin as well,
though I haven't asked them yet. Fliers will be done as soon as the lineup
settles down, so please get some from me and help spread the word.

Needless to say *your* involvement is not only welcome but requested. 

take it easy

I'm also pleased with the current 'state of the vibe', and am hoping to
be around the SF scene more in the next few weeks.  I can't make it
down for Blue Cube II, unfortunately, but hope to be at both F&F and
In the Light.  June is On the Road with the Grateful Dead for me, which
starts June 8-9-10 at Cal Expo in Sacramento, and proceeds to Seattle,
Eugene, Las Vegas and Shoreline the weekend before July 4th, plus whatever
raving/housing/trancing I can get in, in between.  And any DJing I can
possibly do as well, of course!  *Plus* my long-hoped-for promo tape which
is | | this close to being "in the can."  I'm not sure when I'll have the
entire package including J-cards ready but I should have at least some
cassette dubs by the end of May for your listening enjoyment.  I'm feeling
a lot better about my mixing in part because of the discipline of doing
the takes on the promo (eight so far and two or three more to go) and in
part because of a big step forward that suddenly sort of happened during
my practice session night before last.  I don't know how to describe it
except to say it was a lot like what we called "going over the hump"
back in my ham radio days of learning Morse Code.  It seemed like there
were a couple of spots where everyone struggled to get through, one was
around 5 words per minute (I was doing WPMs long before BPMs :) and
another around 12, and another around 18.  And once you got past 18
you could 'hear' words instead of just letters on Morse Code (or CW as
us hams usually call it), a sort of 'opening up' or wider field-of-
perception.  It was kind of like that the other night; I've been listening
to other mix tapes to pick up on beat-matching and mixing techniques, and
had been listening (again, for the nth time) to some of the Connection II
tapes and in particular to the Jon Williams/Phil Smart "Kitchen Synch"
tape, and something sort of *happened* and I felt like a whole couple of
months of struggling with vinyl mixing techniques finally paid off.  Whew!

So anyway, I'm getting jazzed to be on the road again after a couple of
months sticking pretty close to home here in Portland and (unexpectedly)
moving from my long-time house share to an apartment.

So . . . be prepared . . . be positive . . . and see you in the future!

I know this sounds a little crazy, but what the heck, these opportunities
only come around once in a great while.

If anyone cares to join me, I'm planning to go to In the Light during the
day on the 28th (I'll already be in SF because DB Expo is at the Moscone
Center that week, the one computer trade show a year I do now that
Interop has moved to Las Vegas), and then fly directly to Seattle for
the XLR8R/Choclit Factory/Astralwerks Earthspace Xtravaganza that night!
I'll check on airfares and availability tomorrow and put the info here
in case anyone else has the same crazy urge.  It may not be possible
to do this because of flights being booked up for the holiday weekend,
but I tend to think that Saturday evening flights are easier to get
than others during that time period.  

see you in the future!

Wow!  Wish I could make this one but June 18 is the second of three
Dead shows in Eugene and I'm hoping to be involved with some "alternative"
musical stuff there too -- we'll see.  

I'm getting pretty excited about the suddenly increasing level of activity,
though.  Hot fun in the summertime!!!

	Well, inspirations last night was held in between some wherehouses
outside, somewhere in San jose, I am not exactly sure where, i wasn't 
driving. Inspirations lost their 18 and up license aabout two weeks ago, 
and have decided to move the thing to the Oasis, but they couldn't get 
the booking until next week, i believe, so they have ahd their last two 
parties a bit incognito. Anyway, my room mate, Talizman, who often posts 
to you guys through my account, spun first and did a pretty good job, got 
the crowd going ( all 25 of them), but just as he was getting into it, 
the S.J. police showed up and said turn it off. Apparently you need a 
license for amplified music after dark. The police were cool, though no 
shouting or force, just said that was the way it was and we had to turn 
it off. the promoters ( forgive me for not knowing their names)  were 
going to move the party elsewhere, but  my group took off, so I don't 
know what happened after that. 
that's my little report on inspirations. If anyone has anything to add or 
correct, please do.
peace.
btw personally i thought talizman was great, but i figure people might 
consider me biased, so i thought i would just add it at the end.

Motion was a good time.  Saw some SFR people enjoying themselves.
(RobertJ, Mr. Grigsby, Larry Ching, Pete Reiter...)  Excellent
visuals, good crowd.  Loren spun first and did a really nice job, but
with no crowd to enjoy it really.  Spun came on and managed to get
really out there by the end of his set.  Jeno then twisted things
pretty good, and along the way, managed to play almost all of the
records that he owns that I really love.  Definitely a good time.  I'm
really glad that Rick (who is a very mellow/cool/nice guy) and the
rest of the posse continue to bring this excellent production to SJ.

(Safety tip/note: both Spun and Jeno like to turn up the mixer until
all the red lights are on.  for you DJs, this is ignorant and stupid
behavior, as this means that the mixer is putting out a lot of
distortion.  if you want it truly loud and also care about the quality
of sound (and the comfort of the people at the party), set your levels
so the mixer is only going into one red light occasionally, and then
the sound person will probably be happy to turn up the main gain on
the power amps.  much better all around.  never ceases to amaze me
that DJs think that they can get louder by cranking the mixer all the
way over, when really this just pisses off the sound people who
immediately turn everything way the fuck down so the stacks aren't
destroyed by THD.)

I'm going to be at the Blue Cube on Saturday... please excuse the
quasi-commercial nature of this info, but I'm clearing out all of my
rave tape inventory.  Prices will hold until everything is GONE... act
fast to avoid disappointment.  C2 (4 tape set), only 40 left, are now
$10.  Carlos tapes, only 20 left, now $5.  This is it, once these are
gone, they'll never be reprinted...

(FYI Liquid Air is now out of print and is no longer available.)

I'm really looking forward to the Blue Cube party and hope to see
everyone there!

Bob

        It would be a good way for people to scan a bunch of things

To All SFRavers out in Net Land...

It gives me great pleasure to introduce you all to Dawnzig,  this girl that
lives up in the "Eagles Nest" at Eagle Cliff,  the hunting lodge I live
in,  here in Mill Valley.   This will be her first introduction to the rave 
scene. 

Just yesterday,  she learned about me being Cap'n Crunch,  and she is on
IRC a lot,  but declines to reveal her true identity.    Anyway,  pleeze
make her feel at home,  and show her the true power of Luv Phasers. 

Am I to assume that it starts at 10 pm?

Ya know,

There are not many things that can really irk me these days, but this
*person*, if I may call it that, is a rare exception.

First he talks to me about how elitist I am, then he posts some shit like
the above.  Wassup wit dat.  AND wasup wit YOU?  Why is it that you have
such a fucking bug up your self-riteous ass?  What is it with you, that
after railing against me, and others, about our apparent elitisism that you
see it completlely within your bounds to  be such a prick?  Why, for
instance, do you have such a grip against Wicked for its supposed elitism,
then say some elitist, self-serving rubbish about *your* party at *your*
place as if *you* were the end all to this entity (bka the scene)?

Man you need to check yourself.  Geoff was asking a very simple question,
and your *veiled* attempt at sarcasm, if I may call it that, was
unwarranted.  Personally, since I now know it is at your place,I will not
attend.  Could care less about you or any event remotely associated with
you.  You, and people *like* you, are the reason people stay away from
parties. And statements like the ones you have made, are one of the MANY
reasons for the complete possifcation of this scene (which existed before
blue ^3 parties, and will outlast them in some way shape and form).

The idea behind many of the things I have said (meet people, get to know
them, get info), is all part of *building* a community.  Getting to know
the promoter, dj, partiers, whatever is all a part of getting to know the
community.  It's not elitist, its called getting to know your neighbor and
eventually becoming friends.  You on the other hand, spout all this shit,
and I *mean* shit, about love togetherness, and then base it upon some
rigid laws *you* and *others* of your ilk have decided should be followed,
and then make no attempt to exend that philosphy above your blessed clique
(and beleive me, this list has just about as many cliques and as much
politix as the larger scene has).  In effect, *what* in the fuck have *you*
done?

Have you tried to extend what you call a party, to those who are unitiated,
and *not* so well connected (i.e. via computer).  I didn't see flyer one of
this event at the last Wicked (which provided a great opportunity for you
to *educate* those so ill informed).  Or is it that it is word of mouth?
(Hell, I ain't heard SHIT about this gig from the populus, so word must
*not* be getting out).  Or is it really just more of the same bullshit
philosophical masturbation about how *you and others* are so clued in, and
others not?  It's all about being that geek being laughed at, who now has
the last laugh?  It's all about *not* being PC  when it comes to diversity?
Get a clue newbie, get a clue.  You just gettin started while others have
already run this fucking race...

Look man, talk the talk, then walk the walk.  Anything less, you're doin
nuthin' but frontin'.  No future in it, believe that.  Next time you bag on
*insiders* think about how *inside* you're actin'.  Think about how
prejudice you're acting, think about how unforgiving and rigid you're
acting, and think about the image you present to those of us who reside in
BOTH scenes.  From my perspective, not a pretty site.  So I hope you, *and*
*your* posse have a good time.  *I* have decided to boycott your shit, and
any future event assocaited with you.  *I* have decided that you are nothin
more than a fronting, elitist newbie, who's trying to step, but don't know
*who* to step to.  *I* have decided that you are just like all other
fronters who talk a good game, but are hypocritical when it comes to
delivering or living up to a standard that you set (so arbitrarily too).
Weak...

Save your flames, put me in your killfile, could give a fuck.  We can talk
reasonably, as soon as you get your proverbial head outta your ass and stop
fronting.  Like I said, no future in it.

Others:  Please save your private e-mail about how wrong/right I am.  I
have taken the time to meet and speak with some of you, and you know who
you are.  If we have talked *personally* I do not mind hearing from you.
All others, who don't know *shit* about me (as much as I then would know
about you), save it.  Virtual community notwithstanding, unless we talk
face to face, neither of us know shit.  Analog Res has a serious bug up his
ass (probably as big as the one up mine, but I *know* I have a bug up my
ass.  Therein lies the difference), and his pontificatiing and over
religious attitude is sickening.  Fuck 'im and *any* other like him.
People like him form posses of knucleheads, so unforgiving, so full of
themselves (esp since they *think* they got a clue).  Not really interested
in people like him.


More damage:  Mr Fox, or should I say THE REV.->  Not interested in anyone,
especially a rev/preist trying to grow his flock so he can fleece 'em. I
trust him and *his* ilk as much as I trust the NSA/CIA/FBI/General Spooks
(I am African American so I can say the word Spook/Nigger/Colored since
that is *my* way of taking the word back, and thus diminishing it's power.
I would not trust such power to those who are *not* of the aformentioned
culture within our great
USofKKKSexistRacistNonDiversifiedWonderbreadKultura.).  C'mon, get REAL.  I
did not have to hear what he says, or what he's trying to do since it has
been done before (it's called being a missionary.  Wiped out whole
cultures/races, all in the name of growing the flock, spreading the word
and fleecing them *by any means necessary*).  If history is a good teacher
(2000 years of such teachings), and is any indication of the future, I
would hedge my bets on Pagans.  Hell, at least they make no bones about
what their deal is, quite the pragmatists too.  If this guys so friggin'
open, why in the *hell* does he wear a collar, or is even associated with a
specified religion. WHY is it that he wants come over here trying to spread
that word, expand that mission?  Muthafuka needs to go to the HVP (Hayes
Valley Projects) or POHill (Potrero Hill), or even North Beach (yuppie
overpaid money grubbers), or the Presidio (home of Diane "Old Bag"
Fienstein <- Yes, old bag is Sexist, but I never said I was not a sexist
dog ;)).Now *those* are some folx who need saving/growing/flocking/fleecing
IMO. As PE said, CANT TRUSS IT!!!  The scene don't need him or any other
collar to come here and *gorw* it  (reading about relgion and becoming an
"expert" is a far cry from living it.  He ain;t no Black Baptist, or a Jew,
so *what* does he know outside of his readings?  It's called LIVING IT,
WALKING IT, TALKING IT.  And I KNOW he has NOT done all THREE.  Summarily
disqualified....

I am quite done now.  Analog get a clue newbie, I consider you nothing more
than a vegetable TRYING to be meat (i.e. fronting).
Foxianswhowannagivethesuckaachance, *I* ain't with it.  Get in line, he has
his clippers, whose next to get fleeced.

Is it me, or isn't it apparent that he was trying to crack a _joke_?
   If he were serious about the fuck-you, then he wouldn't have offered
   directions via email.

The point of email directions is to reduce the number of casuals- "please
   only come if you really want to be here (specifically)" - it's not
   necessarily to be elitist.  While in theory, access to the info is all
   the same (assuming our hero isn't being selective about who he replies to),
   the fact is that posting a location/etc. will necessarily attract a
   larger, less intimate crowd.  That's fine for some kinds of events, but
   not for all.

now: peace.

like,
adam

ps. I'm going to be in the New York region (nyc + li) during June- can
    anyone recommend events/djs I should seek out in my journey?

But John, in Analog's (Steve Larkin?) message was the sentence "mail me
for directions".  Isn't that in contrast with the initial impression of
eliticism you got from his post?  I'm sure he has a computer at his house
and will check the list at least a few times to give people directions--so
what happens when he and others see your post?  You have every right to
boycott his party, but to destroy the vibe for other people?  That's not
cool.

Sami

uh, john, regardless of analog's attitude (or not), what you said was not
only uncalled for but stated at exceptionally verbose length.  i'm not
involved in this party because I'm back at home doing the TKOB shuffle,
so it doesn't affect me one way or the other, but he generously has made
his place available now a couple of times and the last Blue Cube Affair
was a rocketship by everyone's estimation.  

his place is small and if i were him i wouldn't want flyering or even
postering here on the net to bring the possibility of more folks than
the place can handle, and that is not an impossibility.  i wouldn't
have put it as indelicately as he did, but consider that aspect of it.

i've never met you but i've read and appreciated what you have written
here over the past year or more and all i can say is . . . you seem to be
in a situation where you *need* to go out and kick out the jams all night
at a good party!!  i mean, i *know* this feeling, on thursday as the
consequence of a dozen little difficulties i had the biggest flip-out
public tantrum i can recall in at least a year . . . so now that it's
done let's go on, and i sure hope i witness the handshake between you
and analog either next week at Launch Pad or at the Park on the 28th.

So there!  No frontin', just the way I see it.

I got to Blue Cube around midnight.  Lotsa of people hanging out talking
and lotsa of people dancing.  I finally was able to get some faces
attached to these e-mail addresses!  The people were very friendly and
receptive.  I was upset there was alcohol but no one ever got out of hand. 
I think I'm so used to people drinking to get wasted that I didn't see
people just drinking to have a good time.  I heard a little bit of Laura
and Lee An, (and Willy?).  I enjoyed the records they put on.  I would of
liked to see more black lights inside the dance area.  I stayed til 4:30
and got had a good time.  Got to meet some new faces.. and make some
people happy.

Thanks to everyone who made it out to Pt. Richmond for the free Freak Out!
party on Friday night. We had it jumpin with aprox 100-150 prople dancing
under the stars and the trees and leaves and other nocturnal creatures of the
night.
No thanks to the Richmond police dept  for busting it up at 4am and giving
Pat a ticket for tresspassing, unlawful assembly, and having a vehicle in the
park. 
Since we made about 1,200 invites and got several hundred calls on the voice
mail we were hoping for a bigger crowd but we heard that the cops had the
entrance to the tunnel blocked off.
After dealing with the police we moved it to the Berkely Marina where Pat
spun records until 9am when the crowd had dwindled to about 20 people.

We will be doing another party sometime in June and another on the fourth of
July so keep your ears and eyes open.

Hope to see you all at the next one!

As for sarcasm, where were your smiley faces?  I really could care less
about whether you meant it or not.  I would only concern myself with the
real article.  You have failed on that count frontin' newbie.

Its quite obvious you've never met me.  And the way things are now, its
unlikely to happen anyway.  I speak the way I want to, and if you met me
you'd know the deal.  It's obvious you don't.

Impress you?  I would not waste the time trying.

Whatever, just sounds like more of the same bullshit you rail against.
Just keep on doin what you do best.  I'll continue to ignore such mealy
efforts.

Every time there is an FMR and non-connected people post to 
SFRaves asking for directions they get chastized by people who 
have been around and/or who have direct connections with the Wicked 
posse.  You'd think people could follow directions that had been 
posted at least three times to the sfraves list, were listed in the 
sfraves calendar, and were printed in Martin O'Brien's "Choices" 
newsletter to find out how to get to the Blue Cube.

Somehow enough people found out to pack Steve's kitchen, hallway, 
under-stair area, garage, and chill room.  It's a good thing there 
wasn't more publicity or else there would have been too many people 
for the space to handle.  I don't know how many people were there.  
Many of them were from the Santa Cruz compute-hack-have-fun scene, 
and so were newbies in the raver sense and had a good time trying out 
the funky acid techno trance house beats and meeting and talking to people 
from a more sfraverish background.  I thought it was great that so many 
people trekked in from so far away to hang out and make a good time.

It was marvellous getting to hear Bryce spin.  He ALWAYS gives up his
slots to everyone else, and after hearing him finally take a turn
I am thinking that we should not let him give up his spots anymore!!
So if Bryce says to you "oh, go ahead, I don't care if I go on or not"
prod him a little bit!  Ethan and Lee were as trancey/acidy cool as 
always.  My friend Will, who's visiting from New York, was absolutely 
killer in the "clean up" spot.  I walked into the dance area and it was
a sweatbath . . . lots of brassiere and booty going on.  People were 
asking me who Lee and Will were, and why they never get on flyers in SF.
In Will's case it's because he's just visiting, and I guess in Lee's it's 
because he's so darn busy with finishing school.  I'm always happy when 
Lee comes out to play and hang with us, because I know he's making an 
extra effort.

I think extra effort goes a long way in parties.  The people I met
from Santa Cruz and Napa made an extra effort to come all the way in
to a party that wasn't "guaranteed" by having a known promoter or
DJ behind it.  People made an extra effort in general by following 
instructions to email for directions (sort of like with the "treasure
hunts" to find the FMR -- we've heard all the arguments defending the 
FMR by saying that in making it harder to find they ensure that they 
get mostly "true believers").  Will made an extra effort to schlepp his 
record-filled flight case out from NYC.  People who shared candy, 
cigarettes, lighters, beer, and conversation made an extra effort to 
be social.  You get my drift . . . the whole thing was rather inspiring 
in that it was all do-it-yourself/friends-doing-it-for-friends which gave 
things a close and intimate intensity.  

Unlike most of the rest of you all, I arrived in San Francisco 
too late to ever really be a part of any of the older, more established 
original rave families, so I love what's happening with the sfraves/sound
vision/metrovision/liquid air/launch pad conglomeration.  It's still an 
open system for me.  In these smaller intimate parties I meet and get
to know lots of people.  This has the comforting side effect that when
I do venture out to something larger and crazier like Come/Unity I
don't feel so lost -- there are a few people sprinkled through out the
crowd that I can touch base with.   Come hang with us!  There will 
be many renegades and a few larger parties all summer!  

Anyway, big hugs to everyone who came, to Steve for donating the use
of his house, to Bryce for the sound system and gear.  There will
be more of the same but different (different DJs, different location)
next weekend at the Launch Pad.  Dress in layers and save the phone line 
number next time you see it so you will know how to find directions. 
There are flyers at Ameba if you want a concrete reminder.  Info 
is also on the sfraves calendar which comes out on Thursdays.

John,

   You suck.  The scene- any scene- could do without this.  The dude's
   trying to be reasonable.  Your need to "speak the way you want to" is,
   actually, really really offensive.  Think about it: I don't even know
   you and I can't imagine you talking to people like this in person.
   You'd get punched in the mouth.  It's like you're picking fights.

   The rest of us already posted several independent and consistent
   accounts of why someone would want to give directions by email.  The
   thing to do at this point is say, "hey- difference of opinion" and let
   it go.

   I actually see your point, and it's reasonable: there's a fine line
   between emailing everyone and being selective about it.  Even if he
   doesn't, it still might feel like he is to the uninitiated, perhaps used
   to traditional, exclusionary "club" scenes.  I get that.

   But it's time to realize that email isn't the same thing as your diary-
   real people exist on the other end of the wire, and their feelings get
   hurt.  Those are fighting words; you should think twice before sending
   the verbal assault- I don't care if you're right or not: he didn't
   deserve the battering, and it's net.uncool of you to say such things,
   especially in a public forum.  If nothing else, it makes it unpleasant
   to receive mailing lists when flame wars rage.  You're not a newbie: you
   should know better.  There's no need for flames, especially in public.

   It's time to apologize: people fuck up over email all the time- I've
   been there many times myself.... it's easy to lose track.  But it's
   something you should really consider.  Reread the letters you sent, and
   imagine if you were the recipient.

Think about it,
adam

Hmm... sounds like this has become a dirty word on the list. Maybe I 
should have typed 'p*sse' instead. What I want to know is, what the big 
gripe with it? There are as many different tastes in parties as in music 
(I tend to dig that ez-listening freezer food aisle planetarium 
intermission groove myself). So what's wrong if I tend to gravitate to 
people closer to my own mindset? Doesn't mean I don't go out for parties 
of other flavor. Doesn't mean I slam people with other appetites. If you 
love fish, you don't hang out in a steakhouse (gee can you tell I just 
ate dinner?).

Putting on these events is a drain on time, energy and money. If I'm 
benefitting by going attending them, I like to make sure I can give 
something in return. Naturally, if enough people feel this way, it'll 
create a more close-knit group. Doesn't mean the door is closed on new 
folks. Doesn't mean one family is 'better' than another. There's much 
intermarriage between the families of the SF bay.

(now that I've recalled one of the gripes) Yeah, I guess it makes it hard 
on new events to grab a following, but many of us have been burned by the 
fly-by-night cash-rave cutlture of a few years ago, so there's a little 
leftover distrust (on my part at least) of forking over my cash and 
time and energy to anyone and everyone who decides to rent out a night at 
a club or cut a bolt on a warehouse door. I'm not in it just for the 
music or just to hear the best DJ that Walla Walla has ever seen. For me, 
the groove comes as much from the people as it does the music. So 
sometimes I'll pass on something I don't know when something I do know 
and have been looking forward to is going on. An unknown party may be 
good, but the promoters we already know and respect need just as much 
support.

(now that I remember another one) And yeah, a lot of the sfr/f+f stuf 
isn't heavily promoted. But I don't remember one instance where anyone 
was unwelcome. When you've already got a crowd maxing out your space and 
capabilities, why advertise? Just so you can get 300 people in a space 
only designed for 50? Just so the noise and other problems of the extra 
crowd gets the party shut down 5 hours earlier? Information this tendency 
to spread well beyond it's intended area (e.g. FMR) so I hardly think 
anyone is left out in the cold. If someone takes a few minutes to look 
(it's the *least* you can do) all you need to know is out there.

The Cacophony Society says "you may already be a member." So it goes with 
the SF families. All it takes is one minor speck of effort. Too much to 
ask?

I am outta here.

After one year on the list (has it been that long?)  I most certainly do
need a rest.  From this list, from the scene, from the people in it.

I have met some really nice folx in the virtual community that *IS*
SFRaves.  And for the most part, you guys/glas are a great group.  In all
honesty I do believe it.

I think that SFR will prove to be a force to be reckoned with in the
future, and I look forward to the *real* mutha's gettin out there and doin'
the do (some of you already are).

I have noticed that things are a changin' here on the list.  Just in terms
of 'tude.  I think that I may have contributed to it in many ways.  I don't
want to develop a whole group of enemies, I prefer freindship.  But to me
friendship means honesty.  Some  people prefer euphamisms...in any case
that ain't me.  Since there are still quite a few who have a problem with
me, I would just as well split.  I really don't think that I belong here as
much as others do.  I also do not think that I am ready to give up my way
of stating things just to make others happy.  I have been relatively quiet
over the past few months anyway, since the things I would like to talk
about would only stir up the pot, it's best to go.

I would really like to take some parting shots, but what would it prove,
other than I am the king of the slapshot, unrivaled in delivery...big deal.

Since it seems that I will never be into the "spirit" that is the list
(whatever that is), I should move on.

Peace,
John

(GGPark Bandshell as a benefit fro RFAN & Burth Children's Center.  Also

well at the corporate!  Hey, how's sistah Maria?

SJ Posse ->  All you mutha's need is a club that stays open all night.  SF
would be shut down without you.  The South bay FUELS this scene in many
ways, and some SF posses love to diss 'em.  SF has quite a bit to learn
from SJ, like diversity, like family, like community.  SJ, and the people
in it, are all THAT!!!  My home from home.

Words:  I have always used fronting, dis, cool, punk, shit, ass, booty,
boongy, betty, triple B, triple D, audi, bcnu, wassup, wit, dat, fuck,
posse, bitch, shrtless male, hoofer, and a host of other things.  I do not
watch MTV (except to get really fucking stoned and watch beavis & butthead
for classic political satire).  My language is my own, didn't get it from
the streets, since I did not grow up on the streets.  I would suggest, for
those of you who do not understand how the fuck this black man can say
"Goddamn, wassup with dat shit!", and still program the Macintosh in C,
C++, Assembly, I would suggest the Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, Native
Son by Richard Wright, The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Alex Haley,
Beloved by Toni Morrison, The Souls of Black Folk by WEB Dubois, and The
Art of War by Sun Tzu.  My shit is straight, my shit is real.  I don't need
TV to give me new words (by the time black speak is put on the air, it's
already run the gamut in the African American Community, get a clue).

Nature abhors a vaccum. Keep the door to your heart and mind open to those
who are different than you.  Diversity RULES!!!  Everything homogenous will
either be absorbed or destroyed.  Think about it.

Only punk chumps use these words to mask what they really feel:
Bad Neighboorhood, Rough Area,  Gangster-looking, ganster-anything, sketch,
underpriviledged, *us* and *them*.  Get real, and say what you really feel.
Many prefer it more honest, more open <- Direct quote from "Space
Seed-Star Trek Orignial Flavor".

I'm now done.

I deleted the rest of this dribble since this person is quite irksome
(something to admire in a way).  Mr Sah, do you want to punch me in my
mouth?  Are *you* picking a fight?

Please...give it a rest.  You, and others like you are a bunch of
goosesteppers, no different than the people you admonish.

As for fighting words, Analog threw the first salvo, and that punk got what
he deserved.

As for you...I'm dropping it.  It's between, if anyone, Analog and I.  I
have little more to say about it.  The chapter's closed masked avenger, so
ride off.  As for me, I'm audi.

Look Audi 5

analog's post was a bit rough around the edges, but yours was a straight up
load a shit. Ruined my monday. You shoulda kept that shit private. I hope
you get deluged with mail. No amount of personal invitations would get you
out anywhere anyway so who needs you.

Why don't you just save it. And I mean it.

John. I just don't get you. After all this you're just gonna back out:
front. No future there. You know your opinion is valued here. But when you
shit out your mouth you're gonna here about just like any and all of us do.
Man you basically just thanked and said goodbye to *everyone* on this list,
analog included. Seems like you know *most* of us. Why don't you just chill
for the week and come dance with us at launch pad. Even if it is in a
'w'eak spot :)

take it easy

do whatcha like

i can't speak for the rest of SFRaves but-  i am not a "force to be reckoned
with" as you said about us in your last message

we are an ENERGY (nrg?) to be SHARED

maybe thats what makes your views and mine incompatible

its not about competition and exclusivity
its about SHARING 
i share my house, my time, and my resources, as do all of our wonderful SFRave
family, which is why we don't have to have $20 21+ nightclub parties

if this offends you so greatly than i hope you find a better venue for
 discussion than this

I do hope though that you drop the TeenBeat magazine linguistics. its really
not becoming.

Weekend Rave report
by John Draper

   Back again for yet another report on the SF Rave scene and also a report
on the Bay to Breakers foot rave across San Francisco.   For those not in
the know,  Bay to Breakers is a San Francisco tradition,  where more than
80,000 people participate in the craziest foot race,  dressed up in 
everything from Bevis and Butthead to StoneHenge,  and everything in between.

   First stop was the Blu Cube party in a small cramped home set in the back
of larger homes.    The dance area was a converted garage,  with a lot of
preparation done to keep the sound inclosed to prevent a noise problem.
This was the first time I took a girl friend of mine to a rave,   only
because I had arranged for her to get a ride home so I can continue my
raving throughout the late morning.

   Our own SFRavers provided the DJ'ing,  and Laura spun the most amazing
acid trance I've heard in a long time.   I thought I left the planet and
was soaring around the cosmos BIG TIME.    Ethan did his usual stuff,
introducing us to some of his new record acquisitions,  doing a technically
superb job.

   Unfortunately,  things had to shut down around 4 am or so,  which was rather
unexpected for me.    Dawn, the girls I was with took off back to Marin,  and
I was dropped off at the Trocadero to attend VISION.    By the time I got there
(About 4:45 am) there was a long line out in front,   but thanx to a friend
who saved me a place,  I was able to get in before they wouldn't let any more
people.   WOW!! it sure was pumpin in there,   as Tony was laying down some
pretty funkey tunes,  sorta mixing it up with some pretty aswsome trance.
I never heard this kind of mix before,   but I was on the dance floor almost
continiously,  other than to chill out.   This time,  the Troc had some fans
around the dance floor that really made a difference in my dance energy.
By that time,  I had almost forgotten that I wanted to run the 7.5 mile
Bay to Breakers race,   but early in the morning,  it started to rain
and I said "Oh S**t" what a bummer to be running in the rain.

   I continued grooving to the tunes,   going berserk from the awsome amount
of energy bouncing around all the way to the end (8 am).    By that time,
the Bay to Breakers race already started,  so I just left the Trocedero,
went up 4th St,  and I could see the huge throng of people boogie'ing up
Howard,  so I immediatley started running Bay to Breakers,  as I merged into
the throung of more than 80,000 people,  all going up Howard St.

   The race was totally insane,  and I felt great,  with lots of energy,
although I had been dancing ALL NIGHT,    I felt the change from dancing to
running to be less strenious than I thought.   Although I'm NOT a runner,
and have never even jogged a lot,   I took to a rather relaxed running style
and by the time I turned on 9th St,  heading towards Hays St,  I thought
this wasn't so bad after all.   Origionally,  I was expecting to just
run and walk the race,  resting whenever I can,  but that never happened.

   In the Bay to Breakers,  the route goes along Hays St,  up about 400 feet
elevation over about 8 blocks,  and is dreaded by the runners.    This hill
was about the 2 1/2 miles into the race,  with the 3rd mile just before the
top of the hill.    About halfway up the hill,   a lot of people were walking
at that point,   but I happen to be luckey enough to find a band of runners
moving along at my pace,  and literally got SUCKED up the hill,   passing
quite a few people that looked a lot stronger runners than I was.   Just
before the top of the hill,   it got so crowded that it was impossible to run
anymore without pushing people aside,  so I was skipping around parked cars
to get to the top without stopping.   There was *SO* many people....

   After I got to the top,   I speeded up my running,  and eventually turned
down Fell St towards Golden Gate Park,  where I was to rouse Aaron who lives
on Fell St.     He joined me there,  and we were running together for a while
untel Aaron (Who didn't start at the beginning) wanted to sprint the last 2 
miles.    In the meantime,  the miles were ticking away,  and when I got to
the last mile to run,  I opened it up,  pulled out the stops and at this
point,  I was passing everyone until I got to the finish.   Of course Aaron
was far ahead of me by then,   but we met at the finish line,  gave each other
a message,  and was partying a few hours at the Polo Fields.    Aaron volunteered
to get the car (I wasn't about to pay $5 to take a bus back).   It took him
15 minutes to run back to the car but 30 minutes to drive back due to the
heavy traffic.    Aaron is a big time runner,   so 5 minute mile is nothing
for him.

   This was my FIRST Bay to Breakers,  and for someone who never runs,   I
thought it was amazing that I could run 7 1/2 miles.   While in the Polo
fields,  I did my yoga,   and after that it felt like I never even ran the
race.   Anyway,  I made it back to Light-n-up,  and was dancing all day,   
wandering to the End Up and dacing there till about 5:30,  as if I had never 
even run the race.

   This morning I feel slightly stiff,   but not too sore,   so I'm chalking
it up as yet another awsome weekend experience for me.

   I hope that the others that went to VISION didn't get stuck in the traffic
nightmare,  trying to cross the race.   How many OTHERS participated in this
race?

More later,  as always...

Cap'n Crunch - The crazy raver...

I've gotta tell you, Crunch, you are an inspiration.  We jokingly
say "it's not a real party unless the Captain shows up" but it really 
is true.  I don't think anyone has the energy you do!  I'll keep that in  
mind the next time I want to start whining that I'm tired and want to 
go home :-)

Thanks for coming out, and good luck in next year's Bay to Breakers.

Laura

I dunno, every time I read one of Crunch's rave reports I am amazed that he
didn't drop dead from all of that activity. It's just not healthy! It would
have done me in  a LONG time ago! Why the need to cram so much into a 
weekend?

Am I the only one who sees the value of moderation or even (GASP!) of 
staying home to relax and do something like read?

hi john,
so  u decided to split this list. i can understand why. i really liked ur
report on the wicked last month, the 22nd,i think. u and geoff covered the
feel of it really well. as for honesty on the net, u were right on.
people seem to have a hard time with straight up talk. ok, maybe u did
over react to resonate's failed attempt at irony. but the response people
to that was weak. didn't really get a rebuttal now, did u ?
i felt that it was a 'stand-up-and-talk' PARTY, not a rave as such. too few
people dancing for a rave to break out :) i guess that is good , but maybe
it says something - what, i don't know.
take care/shalom/acid+bass
ovid
p.s. come by and say 'hi' sometime. i usually have beads on and i like to keep
my coat on.

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Ovid said something to the effect that the Blue Cube was
more of a stand up and talk party than a rave, that there
wasn't enough dancing going on for a rave to break out.

Well, all I can say is what did you expect? :-)

The parameters of what to expect at a rave like Vision are 
well-known.  The parameters of what to expect at a party like 
the Blue Cube are also well known, as we did one of these back 
in January and it was widely reported on.  Blue Cube was never 
actually advertised as being a rave (whatever that is these days).
The word "party" was the operative word.

I think any situation where the dance floor is packed to capacity 
is a good thing :-)  Both Vision and Blue Cube were that night, so 
I'm sure a lot of people were happy.  In the long run isn't that 
all that matters, not how well we rebutted John Lee when he complained 
about a party he probably would not have showed up at ANYWAY based on 
past experience and knowledge of his usual party preferences?

If someone likes Wicked or Lighten-Up, then by all means go!  If 
someone feels like Spiral Jive, the NMR, SPAZ, or Liquid Air,
then go!  San Francisco is SPOILED for variety and choices when 
it comes to parties.  In some other parts of the US people are happy 
if there is ONE good party a month.  Parties are meant to be enjoyed.  
Enjoying a party is probably the BIGGEST contribution a party-goer can 
make to the party itself and to the scene in general.

I used to make fun of Susie for saying "party on" all the time.  But
you know, she's got a really good point.

i had a good time. i enjoyed having the opportunity to provide some of
the sound system, and the opportunity to spin dance music for people.
thanks for your patience with my screw ups, and for your encouragement.

i'm very sorry that some people were put off by the barriers erected to
keep the party at a manageable level.  these barriers were no higher than
many other parties that exist in the bay area. the information to list
people *was* presented several times, in several ways...personal invites,
on the calendar, in Martin's broadsheet, and in personal posts to the
list.  the organizers were respecting the wishes and needs of the person
who provided the space, since we all knew the limits of that space. the
last party in the space really exceeded those limits, and put people off
in a different way.  it seemed that we had a comfortable number of folks
come by, and stay, with enough room to move about without excessive
jostling or impediment.  there was a conscious decision *not* to create
flyers and *not* to have voice mail numbers because of space limitations.
flame me if you will, but i fully support having the right number of
people at parties...not too many, not too few.

as for some of the acrimony that has sprung up, i'm saddened by it, but
emotions will out.  i do hope that the folks involved will learn that
net.exchanges have real consequences to real people, and consider their
words carefully. i also hope that everyone comes to realize that a
net.repuation is a precious thing: a lifetime to build, a moment to 
destroy.

i think it's also interesting and informative that we've now seen the
other side of the "no FMR info" stand.  crisping people for asking for
information is somewhat of a problem.  all the devotees and
insiders who couldn't make it to the blue^3 despite their earnest
desires now have seen what it feels like to: a) get flamed, b) get
their noses rubbed in not being "with it", c) miss out on a great
party.  all the blue^3 devotees and insiders that caused mild flames
now get to see what it feels like to: a) get flamed, b) get their noses
rubbed in being "with it", c) be a part of something that others want
and don't have.  I hope it was a sobering experience for everyone. 

as for the talking/dancing/raving thread: i personally enjoy the social
aspects of these events, and i generally encourage people to talk at
them.  i'm not a big dancer at most events, for a variety of reasons
(some professional--i'm listening to the music intently, listening
to the sound, watching the DJ; some personal--sometimes the music doesn't
really move me; some historical--my body remembers many a bar and punk
event where there was no room to move even if i wanted to; and some
just plain practical--when i go off, i need *lots* of room, cause i'm
all over the room with flailing arms and legs, which can be quite
dangerous to others, and because one of my knees isn't quite up to
much high energy motion).

as for dancing/raving, i've been observing a change in the kind of parties/
events that i'm attracted to. i'm sorry that some people's expectations
weren't met...that's always unfortunate.  i also hope that those people
will let the organizers know what can help them have a good time.  more
importantly, i hope those people who are unhappy will bring a positive
contribution to the event and help turn it into an event that they are
happy at.  i am always surprised (and happily so) when some unexpected
and wonderful thing happens at these things.  i can't speak for other
promoters/organizers, but at the events that i'm participating in, i
try hard to encourage folks to do it for themselves.  not only to we
get to know someone a little bit better, we also get to get another
boost of energy--and we all need that.

thanks for letting me ramble on.  i hope to see you all soon!

Hi!  I am a big fan of the FMR but I don't really know any of the
people who put it on.  Being something of a moon worshipper, I really
love the concept and I've always had a good time at these parties.  Would
somebody let me know how I can find out the night of where it will be,
if this is cool?  I live in the East Bay and have a hard time getting to
the city to find out the location....of course, if you think I should make
the effort to, I understand.  

A testimonial:  The people that I go with to these parties are always
super-responsible about taking good care of the site.  Without my
saying anything, for example, my friend Paul went around picking up trash
at Bonny Doon before taking off for home.  And then there's my friend L.
who picks up cigarette butts wherever he finds them!  (and convinced me
to do it,too...)  Anyway, I'm sorry about the bad feeling that goes on
around the FMR.

Primal Scream, a favorite band of mine, will be playing at Slim's tonite
for $1.05. This is supposedly a "secret" show, but I think you'd better
get there early anyways if you want to get in. Now if only Andy Weatherall
were spinning again for them.... wouldn't life be grand then!

I gotta say, this is pretty cool.  :-)  This is what is going to make a
difference in the world.  Building bridges like this is key.  Making
connections with everyone and building a community, whether we agree on the

And I'd like to meet both resonate and John at Launch Pad.  Let's do it!

I got to the Berkeley marina just as Buck was taking over on the 
turntables.  Due to the wind, they had set up behind a hill and weren't
having too many problems with records skipping, it seemed to me.  There
were maybe about 30-40 people there already enjoying the beautiful
weather and pleasant surroundings.  Buck was THERE; he played the crowd
and they played him in the way that happens when the dj really knows his
stuff.

Then Galen took over.  I noticed he played "This is Acid" as he got
warmed up...sort of like he did at the New Moon party on Tuesday.  Seemed
like maybe he uses this tune to get into the groove.  I believe this
party was the maiden voyage for his newly acquired sound system.  This
party's called "Galen's Sunset party," I think, and he's been doing it
for a while.  I hope it will be a regular thing-the site is a wonderful
place to spend a Sunday afternoon, especially after staying out all night
dancing.  

We left only a little while after Galen started...I was sorry to go, because
he was getting things going with his usual high energy dance music.  But
I wanted to make it out to Bernal Heights for Park, another outdoor party
where Kenneth Paul, Carlos, Bam Bam and Dan were going to spin.  The info
line for this is:  415-647-5795, by the way.  I think this is also a
semi-regular day-time party at another beautiful location.  

We got there about 7:30, but it had already ended.  Rats!  Does anyone
know how it went off?  I'd also like to read a review of Vision, if
anyone went to that instead of the Blue Cube party, which we had to miss
because we didn't have directions...(jus' kiddin!)

1)  Blue Cube was great!  fantastic to get together with this crowd, 
fantastic to get to hear WillE spin to a pumping crowd, and the thoughtless
generosity shown by Steve to allow us into his pad really made my weekend.
Even the cop who showed up around 3:30 because of noise complaints was
cool (sorry about that Steve - I have some ideas for reducing the amount of
noise at the next one).  Because both the SFR and the Scruz clans were
invited, it made for a nice cultural mingle.  And yes, it was also a good
place to talk - which I always appreciate, as it seems all the truely
life-changing conversations I have happen at parties :)  Good show, all.

2)  All I can say w/r/t JSL: John, we hardly knew ya.  I will miss your
presence, for at times you really did have good strong points to make in
the course of a heated conversation.  I've had my gripes with you before,
but I've also admired some of what you wrote too.  I'm just sorry you didn't
feel "in place" here on the list.  You're always welcome to come back.

3) This is a little bit of self-promotion, so indulge me (or hit 'd'
now).  I'll be flying to Geneva in a week, as a representative of
Wired, to go to the World Wide Web convention being held at CERN.  We
have been nominated for two awards in the "Best of the Web" contest
for http://www.wired.com/, and the awards will be presented in Geneva.
The voting for the awards is open to anyone with a web browser like
Mosaic or Lynx.  Go visit http://wings.buffalo.edu/contest - we're
under the "entertainment" and "document design" categories.  If you
think our site deserves it, vote for us!  Or vote for anyone else you
think is worthy, but you can only vote once remember.  Thanks for the
indulgement.

4) Finally, I'm forwarding this along to you all - if someone would like
to give him a synopsis of our region, feel free.  Slurp! isn't
Rolling Stone, don't worry. :)

Hey Brian.  Us folks at Slurp! are trying to get the Rave list admins from
around the country (world?) to submit short articles on the scenes going
on in their areas, and the scene on the list.  Now, I know you don't have
much time and probably won't be able to contribute an article (geez,
exactly how many jobs have you got?  I know about being a student, working
at Wired, and Stanford admin positions (ooh, and running Vrave and
SFRaves).) every month.  So what I am wondering is is if you can suggest
someone on the list who might knows the SFRaves scene and the SF scene who
would be interested in working with us.  If you can help out let me know. 

Dan

PS.  Slurp! will be going national next issue, with an emphasis on the 
Net and technology coming into play (I am so excited about this).

	What the hell is a party anyway?

	Several people emailed me for "directions to the rave"
	to which I reponded "its not a rave" and then sent directions.

	A "rave" implies a one-off event that is a singularly culminating
	occurence.

	Nothing in life is singly occuring. Nothing in history is singly
	occuring.

	A party is where people come together and have a good time.

	I have a certain style for throwing my parties. 

	I like to provide a fairly durable space for people to act silly 
	and not break anything- 
	hence the chained fridge, sealed cabinets etc...

	I like to provide music for listening and/or dancing.
	I like to provide some munchies.
	And dialout terminals.

	One-off spectacles are always a let down since a) they are usually
	all the same and b) they really have an incorrect premise- that
	*this event* is a single unique phenomenon.

	To me life isn't a series of unique bursts. Life is a constant
	flow of good things. I picked this particular house to live in because
	its a low maintenance place to do functional things and have parties.

	I think it works.

	I'll be having more parties.
	

	For the few who think that every party needs to be some massive
	spectacle... well maybe you should spend more time at arena sports
	events.

I think this thing has gotten out of hand, personally.  Why don't you 
guys apologise to each other and establish at least some repoire--an 
agreement to be civil to each other?  I had this problem before.  It 
takes a lot of guts to be the first one to break the silence and admit at 
least part responsibility for the misunderstanding, but it is infinitely 
rewarding.  Having done this before, I have found that it not only makes 
life a lot easier on the others around (not so straining on them ) but you might actually 
find that you have some things in common.
Just my 2 cents
Good luck to both of you

I excpected this list to turn into one giant flame war.  I am so 
impressed and thankful that it didn't.  When I read jsl's post on
monday I was preparing to uns*bscribe for the week.  While I read
that post I noticed that I was cleanching my teeth and fists.  I was
both vicariously feeling jsl's anger and my own anger in response to
his.  I don't need to go through those types of emotions (particularly
this crazy week) so I felt it would be best to let go for a while.
But to my suprise this wasn't necessary.  I'm supposing that there 
were others out there that were just as upset as I was and how we
all managed to keep our fingers off of the "r" key is impressive.
Not to put down those people that did respond either, just as a flame
war would have been inexcusable letting that type of ranting go
completely unchecked would also have been inexcusable.

It was really nice to see that all of the talk of acceptance, tolerance,
love, and community has been more than catch phrases and lofty ideals.
I learned a lot through this whole incident and although it was 
difficult for me, I'm glad it worked out well (particularly on an 
intrapersonal level).

Please, please, please keep it up, and now more than ever before I'm  
looking forward to meeting more of you at the next sfr event.

Take care,
CC

I have seen this definition used may times, but I think it may no
longer be valid.  The "rave scene" has been around for three years
now in the US (at least), so the concept of "one-off" has basically been
rendered mathematically impossible ( :-) ) due to the sheer numbers
of parties that have been thrown in the name of rave.  In San
Francisco where there are a limited number of spaces (indoor and out)
that can support the usual large size of SF parties, spaces have to
be used and reused.  

>	For the few who think that every party needs to be some massive
>	spectacle... 

And the good news is that this group is few as you point out.  I see
growing support for things like Spiral Jive, MESS, the New Moon
parties, and Liquid Air/Sound Vision/Blue Cube/etc .  At the same time,
support for older, more established parties like Basics, Wicked, and
Come/Unity continues, so it's not like anyone is dividing or taking 
anything away from anyone else.  There's room for everyone and everything,
but it might not be the case that everyone is comfortable or happy with
everything.  

This is why there are choices, so people can do what best makes them happy 
or suits their particular mood.  If you don't like deep house, then why make 
yourself and the people around you unhappy by forcing yourself to go to a deep 
house party where you just can't get into the music or the dancing?  On the 
other hand, if you are in the mood for deep house or just want to find out 
what it's like, the opportunity is there.  Ditto for trip-hop, techno, acid, 
funky beats, tribal, breakbeat (when RAW or Demigod are working), and even 
hardcore (that's right, Bryce and I were talking about dusting off our Brooklyn
and Rotterdam records one of these days).  

SF is a veritable buffet of dance choices.  There is nothing wrong with 
having preferences, by the way, the only wrong is in telling people that they 
are less understanding of the scene for liking a certain style (and yes, I've 
heard that . . . the old "the true believers want to get down to soulful 
house" line . . . like give me a break.  In Toronto the "true believers" crave 
breakbeat, in Worcester Mass, it's acid trance.  But I digress.)

Just some random thoughts,

Laura

Well.

Amidst the recent deluge of venom I neglected to add my $.02 about the
party itself. So, without further delay:

Yet another fantastic party. Folks that had the committment to sweat it out
on the packed dancefloor made it really special. The energy was insane.
Best Vibe as such I've seen in a while. Throughout the night people were
yelling and screaming, really working the relationship with the djs, so of
course the music was great all night. Meme did the inimitable Richie Hawtin
more than justice and once again killed me with this amazing deep, and
soulful house track probing the intentionally vague and mournful sentiment:
I'm leaving alabama. Now I know why vocals and house go so well together.
House music is *emotional* music and nothing carries emotion better than
the human voice. Boy would I like to build a set around that kinda music...
So for all you collectors out there, Techno Daddy says: stick this one in
the archives ;-) 

I had a real good time on the decks. Sure is nice to play for friends :)
Acid is the shit  :)   :)

Laura thoroughly fried my brain proving once again that the dj often has no
idea of just how good they sound. Do it Laura. Played one of my favorite
tracks from the recent Juno Reactor 2x12: Acid Moon. Deep acid is the
double-shit. Joe Rice's tape (thanks Joe it's killer) features some great
acid of the extra deep variety as well. Can't wait to hear him do it live
June 18th...

Lee. What can I say? You could be huge. Consistently amazing. Now if he
could just keep track of his records ?-)

Will-E was awesome. Great music and loads of positive fucking energy. Too
bad I couldn't convince him to come back out for F&F (sniff).

Massive props to analog for once again opening his killer home to us. Any
parties only what we make it. If you don't like it, do something to make it
better.

Obvenom: Vibe is the energy that results from people BEING THEMSELVES in
community. Lets try and remember to give each other room to be ourselves in
*this* community. Use those smileys. Look for the best. 

take it easy

Ethan's comment that I throughly fried his brain has trigged me to write 
an essay.  You don't have to read it :-)

I started raving in Brooklyn during the height of hardcore.  Imagine
industrial mixed with punk but with so much weird space sounds added
that it was more science fictiony scary than REALLY scary.  That was
the sound and the feeling.

Of course, after 6 hours of this it got monotonous, like anything else
in the world.  I'd get tired, and practically fall asleep.  And then
something would wake me up.  Back then I had NO idea what the noise was,
but it sounded like a cross between dripping water, an electric guitar,
and fingernails scraping on a chalk board.  Sometimes the best way I
could describe it was as a highly resonating cat meow.  Whatever it was,
it would wake me from a sound sleep and send me screaming to the dance
floor.

Unbeknownst to me I had discovered acid.

After a while I started finding out about things like the TB-303 (one
lives in my house now, it's a sort of electronic pet of Brian's), the 
SH-101, the Roland Jupiter 6 (analogue death machine -- responsible 
for thick spacey vibrating quasi-industrial noises) and much much more.  
I was hooked.

If someone played me a record in a DJ store that had that buzzing dripping 
melting squawking burbling noise, I'd buy it.  Over time I got more 
discriminating, and stopped buying EVERY acid record that came out -- 
there are a LOT of them that are the same old 303/909/pipe-it-through-a-
distortion-pedal -- but there were also some incredible gems.  Hardfloor's 
"Acperience,"  Robert Armani's "Circus Bells," Kirilan's "D.R.U.G.," Richie 
Hawtin's "Substance Abuse," Equinox's "Surveyor-4," Underground Resistance's
"Sunshine and Fog."

Acid comes in all degrees of hardness, trancieness, and houseiness.  I
heard Leon mixing some slow acid over wailing divas when I was over at
Monica's last night, and in my opinion it gave it a new energy and drive.

I'm hooked on the energy and drive.  I guess I'm pretty hyperactive
(you all know I'm type-A).  To hear those bleepy analogue noises
percolating away like messages from outer space just lifts me up and
forces me to dance.  I get this insane smile, and when I'm really into
it I try to make silly 303 noises and sing along.

Adam X (Brooklyn DJ) really got me into the acid trance.  I'd hear him
spin at parties last spring and summer in New York and I would dance
in a complete trance of motion, staring into a strobe light and just
completely out of my mind because of the weird resonating panning dipping
swirling sound.  It was the best :-)  Tripping without any drugs, even.

It became my goal to give that to other people, too.  This is the why
of brain frying.

Somewhere along the line I've gotten it burned into my head exactly 
what I'm looking for when I record shop.  I was in Gaia Mantra with
Brian the other week and was working very quickly through a stack of
records.  Sometimes I'd play a track for about 5 seconds and then
reject it, and Brian would say "you didn't even hear it, how can you
tell it's not what you want?"  I just know what I'm after I guess.
I'm not after mellow rise and fall and achieveing some sort of
happy cruise along dance experience.  I want that insane onslaught
of energy, thought, and movement that I would get when Adam would 
spin.  I'm not vicious and would not drive the dancers from the floor
in exhaustion, I do watch what you all are doing, but I'd rather press
on with each track more bizzare than the last for a while and then
pull back when I read "I can't take much more" from the floor than do
anything else.  So that is the how of brain frying.

Thanks very much for listening.  Both to this letter and to the acid tracks.

Laura

P.S.  It's sort of been a tradition for me to post what I can remember
of my set after I've spun in SF.  This came out of a debate last fall about
how some DJs hide what they are spining and that this is sort of wrong.

Here you go:

	"Acid Moon" by Juno Reactor

	"Trancition (Mongolian 303 Mix)" on Aura Records

	some very long track on Cocci's Chewns that is not
		"Acid Air Raid."  I think it's "Solar Quest" but
		I'm not sure.

	the "Citric Acid" remix of "Afghan Acid," on EX records

	EX-23 (this is the catalog number), it's on EX records

	the first track on the B side of the new Hardfloor EP,
		the EP is "Funilogue" but that's not what the 
		track was

	"D.R.U.G." by Kirilian, on Tension Records

	"Sunshine and Fog" from Acid Rain II by Underground Resistance

	The first track on the A side of Acid Rain I by Underground
		Resistance

	"Plainsong" by Seefeel

	"White Sands" -- has a black label and is on EX records

	some stuff on Trans'pact Records from France

	"Drugs Work" from that old Tresor I compilation

That's all I can really remember now.

Hi, does anyone know about a party called Junk in the city?
It was recommended to me this weekend.  I spaced on getting
further details.  Any info would be appreciated.

In reply to that Junk party:
	I think there is some sort of college students party at the X in San Francisco this weekend.  Does anyone know who the DJs are going to be?  Also, does anyone know if it will be identical to a usual night at the X(ie lame)?
I think it's supposed to be either free or $5-from 9 pm to 9 am.  Maybe this is the Junk party.

Hey, does anyone know where I can get a pair of Sony MDR 7506  headphones.  A
while back someone posted a similar request.  I would settle for a set of
V6's, but I don't know where to find these either( both are, I believe, no
longer in production).  Maybe there is a store somewhere in the boonies with
a couple still in stock?  If you have any ideas, let me know!

Thanks for some of the junk email info I got.
Let me clarify.  I think it would be some kind of
semi-regular hiphop/jazz/funk/tribal? warehouse party. 

I could EASILY be very confused ...
I promise to drop it.

Whole Earth Electronics routinely carryies MDR-V6 headphones. They
recently had a sale where they were $60. If you can't find them there,
check with Uncle Ralphs in Berkeley. If you get really desperate, I
can pick up a pair for you at Turntables Unlimited in Sac, but they
have gouge prices.

If you're willing to spend some money, check out the nicer Sennheiser
headphones. The good ones are $200-$300, but oh man do they sound
good.

While I'm on the subject, I got my mixer, 1200s, and stanton 680s for
an obscenely low price at Uncle Ralphs. If anyone is thinking of
buying gear, go there and ask them what kind of deal they can make
you.

A very close friend of mine has asked me to invite all you sfravers to:

A Benefit Warehouse Party
Friday, May 27

djs are:
  Thomas (American)
  DRC
  Gavan
  Tara
  Henrik

$15/door requested or the donation you can afford
21+ please (or appropriate paperwork)
Directions: 415-281-5657

Door proceeds go to benefit the Lyon-Martin Women's Health Services 
Center, a non-profit primary care clinic for women.

This should be an excellent, "no-attitude" party, as well as a nice 
warm-up for "In the Light."  And, your door charge goes to support a good 
cause (all my opinion of course).

If you have any questions, please email me privately.  Hope to see you there!

Thanks,
Kathryn

I too am a moon worshiper, and live in the East Bay, and don't know 
who puts on these FMR parties, and would like to get  to more of the 
parties. Maybe some kind soul will clue us in on the location and we 
might carpool to the next one? The next full moon is on Tuesday May 
24. Email: afeinber@sybex.com or telephone (510) 536-5430 if you're

Like Laura, I know pretty much what I'm after (although it's a very broad
spectrum, as I discover every time after I come back from a shopping
expedition!) . . . I miss a few good ones, I'm sure, but usually it only
takes a few seconds to determine whether a track is of interest, and then
I'll give it a longer test if so.  Some tracks just leap out at you, which
for example happened when I recently snagged copy of Fluke's 'Groovy Feeling'
which is a little dated but has that je-ne-sais-quoi which elevates the
truly memorable tracks.  Laura's looking for the 'energy, thought and
movement' and I've always described it as looking for the tracks that
'kick'.  That's *kick*, not pump, there is a diff.  Every DJ has a different
take on all this and that's what makes it so interesting.  While the
percentage of good tracks is always fairly low, as I've speculated before
the sheer number available is so great right now that it's possible to
construct remarkably diverse collections from the same pool of music 
circulating in the stores and other distribution channels of the moment.

Dear Adventurer,
          Here's some more info on the Peru trip from India
Supera who traveled to Peru and Bolivia to set up the trip
for us.  She will also accompany us in November as she knows
the territory and the local people very well.




INDIA SUPERA
FEATHERED PIPE FOUNDATION


Dear Friends,

Richard Edelman of the Rim Institute and I would like to
invite you to join Andrew Weil and ourselves on an
exciting journey to the Andes, the heart of Peru and
Bolivia, to celebrate the Total Solar Eclipse.  There is
a special significance to the eclipse here as the
Peruvian culture is rooted in a sun-centered creation
myth.  While most of us think only of the Incas when we
think of Peru, they were just the last of many great
civilizations spanning many thousands of years.  These
pre-Incan peoples thought of themselves as the Children
of the Sun.  The legend of the Sun says that the sun god
Inti sent his first two children to earth - Manco Capac
and his sister consort Mama Oello - to bring
illumination and light to the human race.  Their task
was to find the proper spot to place their gold staff
into the ground.  Cusco, where the staff entered the
earth easily, became known as the naval of the world
from which all life springs.  Manco Capac taught the men
to farm and Mama Oello taught the women to weave.
Archeologists know that weaving originated in Peru and
they think that agriculture occurs earliest in Peru.
This myth weaves strands of masculine and feminine,
light and dark, birth and death.  To be there for the
solar eclipse is like being awake in a dream.

We'll start from the peak experience of the Solar
Eclipse and rise higher. We'll climb to Macchu Picchu,
fly over the Nazca lines, skim across Lake Titicaca, and
cross the altiplano of Bolivia to La Paz, the highest
city in the world.  We'll experience the secrets of
these great civilizations as told to us today through
the ruins of the past as well as the arts, crafts and
music of people living there today. Join us to weave the
myth and majesty of Peru into our hearts.  No one ever
goes away disappointed from the Andes.

If you are ready for this adventure, please give us your
mailing address so that we can send you a registration form.
We hope that you'll join us.

Best regards,

(Signed)      India

F.Y.I.,  Pure Space has the night off tonight.  Last week was bumpin'-- 
Jason, John Howard and Markie.

Anyone else see the Brand New Heavies last night.  I saw the early show, 
and was guardedly optimistic.  (How's that for an oxymoron?)  IMO, 
they're a very talented group of musicians, and I wish they'd jsut let 
themselves be that.  They seemd to be a little bit too concerned with 
"putting on a show."  All in all, a fun time...

Cheers,

Tony

                           Mayday 6 "Rave Olympia"

                 Report of Eye of the Shadow....IRC: Shadow_I


     I live in munich and it's a long ride to reach Dortmund. I went by car
and left munich at 10.30 am. The nearer I came to Dortmund, the more passing
cars greeted with their horn or waved to me, when they saw the MAYDAY badge at
the rear window of my car. When I stopped to stretch my legs or to drink
something, there were always some other cars with ravers at the parking. It
was no problem to find the location, I arrived finally at 5.30 pm at the
parking and had to pay another 4 DM. With my camera I went to the main
entrance and took some pictures of the crowd waiting there. There were ravers
everywhere, some danced near there cars, where they had opened the trunk and
put their loudspeakers outside.
     So it was a good start. Weather was fine (sun, but not too hot), some lay
in the grass and slept a little bit. One pickup stood near the main entrance
with one raver singing live to trance music.
     Often ravers asked me if I'd sell tickets, but I had none over. I asked 
what they would pay, and one said he'd pay 250 DM, but nobody sells his for
that price, but he had an offer of 300.- My ticket I got for 70 DM, so I would
have made quite a good deal if I bought one more to sell it. But I never
thought they'd sell all 25.000 tickets in advance.
     There were signs which forbid cameras inside the hall, so I went back to
the car and left it there. When I came back, the doors still weren't open and
the first people began to shout and whistle. At half past 6 they began to let
the people in and after 40 minutes I too was inside. They checked us for 
weapons and drugs, as always.
     At first I bought Pizza (5DM, fair price) and a raver-shirt (100 DM, 
quite much), because I thought the wear would soon be sold out and I couldn't
lose that shirt but my money. Finally they'd actually had sold out those long
shirts, so I was right. Some T-shirts were left. You also could buy MayDay
posters, CDs, Video-Tapes of former MayDays, caps, even cups I think. Nearly
everything. Commercialisation is becoming overwhelming, not too good if you
ask me.
     Then I went in the main hall. It was full from the beginning on, but it 
was not TOO full, so that you'd get claustrophobia, like sometimes in munich,
where you really can't turn your body any more. In the front was the DJ's
desk, in the rear the Live-Act's desk, left and right loudspeaker walls. They
had a lot of strobos, lasers and beams, I didn't count them. The top of the
hall was closed, so it was fairly dark. The music was not too loud, I had
louder raves already; the hall was too big and too high, so the sound didn't
hurt. The quality was OK, I'd say it was one of the best sound systems I heard
so far. They had two video screens (one the mirrored of the other) with sport
scenes, i.e. there was the scene of a water diver, always repeated the jump
and the way through the air just before he hit the water, then again the jump,
etc. They had soccer scenes, dance scenes, and such, I think they were taken 
from the Olympic Games. Above all they had the MayDay logo, which sometimes
was lighted colourfully. The DJ's or Live-Act's name was displayed with a
Laser-Scroll, so you always knew who's at the decks. I had a timetable, but
lost it, so I have to recall everything out of memory.
     In the main hall they kept the time totally. If the timetable said Live
Act "Members of Mayday" is at time x, you can be sure it will start at x
o'clock. That's germany. :) The first DJ was Pierre Morgan, after him came
Cirillo. I think I heard a little bit of him, but don't like him so much. Then 
came Miss DJax. Her acid-set was OK, and the rave started to begin.
     Franky Jones I heard for the first time. I didn't know he's got so many
techno hits and anthems. His style is techno (melodic) and mellow (according
to psyched's reference samples... ;-) He really kicked. The crowd went crazy
and he was the first positive surprise for me, I didn't hear of him before and
he was SO good.
     I needed a break, and went up, drank something (Coke .4 litre 5 DM,
that's expensive and unfair, beer 4 DM 1/3 litre), water in WC for free... :)
and sat down to relax. From the top of the building you could see the light
show. It was cool, although some ravers told me it would have been better
last year. I can't compare it, but the laser level was cool. The beams
enlightend the ravin' crowd. Everyone was in a good mood, you had the feeling 
of having 24999 friends. :-)
     That time I felt that I had a hard day. 5 hours sleep (I was in the 
cinema the day before and came home at 4am), 600km car ride, 2 hours raving.
So I relaxed one hour or so, the DJs during that time I was not interested in.
     After relaxing I went to hall number two. There was Laurent Garnier. I
think everybody knows him and nothing more must be said about his techno/
mellow/trance (everything around 160 bpm) music and his DJ qualities. He's OK
and he was as good as I knew him from his munich appearances. We raved on and 
everything was fine.
     During the different DJs sometimes there was a Live-Act, always in the
Big Hall. Because I lost my timetable I do not know the sequence the Live-Acts
were, but I heard live
- Ultra Sonic
     I remember nothing, but it was OK
- Members of Mayday
     I'd say THE highlight of Mayday 6. They spinned their
Mayday anthems (of course everybody knew them) & some additional
tracks and because of the shouting hall you sometimes couldn't
hear the music! BTW, some had whistles too but only few. Westbam
sat on one loudspeaker and sometimes stood up and waved or
clapped his hands. There were around 20 ppl at the Live Act
podium and the whole hall raved off.
- Genlog
     same as Ultra Sonic
- Raver's Nature
     they kicked. I wonder why I remember so little, but I think
they showed us some hardcore techno.
- Acid Junkies
     trance, if I remember right. It was really good

     Then I went to the other hall to Pascal F.E.O.S. Some on the net told me
he'd be so good and I missed him as he was in munich. Those dudes are right!
He spins ass-kicking hard-trance and we danced our ass off. =:-( The 2nd hall
had 10 strobos (I counted them... hehe) and 4 balloons where they displayed
some video animations. Good sound, even better than in the main hall, and the
strobos kicked better because this hall wasn't so high. There were a lot of
people, but not TOO much, you had enough place to dance and the music was
really OK. To reach this hall you had to go through the chill-out area, camel
cigarettes ppl were there and offered you some for free, but actually they
wanted to sell there stuff of coz. Pascal is really a good DJ. When you think
"wow, it's so groovin'" he mixes in another track, even more better.
     I think Pascal spinned during Marusha's event in the Main Hall. She's
well known by me so I could skip her, as I went back to that hall (going to
the other hall took about 10 min) everybody danced to her "Rainbow" song, they
were all in a good mood.
     After I did a little break Westbam was in the Main Hall. This time he
wasn't so excellent. Of course he was good and flipped some of his favorite
songs, but there were also some experiments (unknown styles for him, even 
breakbeat one time; BTW: I heard no bb, except Carl Cox for some short time) 
and he couldn't create tension. One month ago I experienced him at a rave and
there he really kicked. But this time there was too much unknown music and new
style of him, not his techno/mellow, but more trance stuff.
     In the other hall I shortly heard LTJ Bukem. He spins some cool music,
very low frequencies, so that the hall vibrates and your back shakes "from
alone", the walls convulse and such. You heard the qualtiy of the sound system
by that... Very new and unknown for me, nothing to dance (many ppl left), but
cool. Some new kind of trance?
     I skipped Paul Estak on the one hand because I heard him often at former
raves and know he's good, on the other hand because my power drifted away.
It's very hard to keep track on his music and dancing and I want to live
longer... :). Same with Carl Cox, but I danced a little bit when he spinned.
He was good as usual.
     So I really thought to leave Mayday 6, but the music and feeling were
simply too good! And I'm a lucky boy, because the pre-last DJ of MAYDAY 6 was
DJ Tanith. I never heard him before, but I think: he was the best DJ that
night I heard. He has trance, deeptrance and hardtrance. It is excellent,
simply excellent. We all were low at power, but gave the last stomp to his
beats. He knows how to create tension and mixes perfectly. I danced like mad 
and fell into trance. I got second power. After Tanith's set I experienced 
Acid Junkies' Live Act (trance, OK) and then DJ Tom (or Woody, don't know) was
the final DJ. He had some popular techno songs, mostly trance (deeptrance). It
was nice, I liked it, but then I knew "that was it" and left the hall at about
9am in the morning.
     And then the bad part of the day began. My car lock was destroyed by some
unfriendly person (I heard 40 cars were theftet that night) and first I tried
to find another raver who could open the car without a key. Many tried to
help, but all failed and said it's impossible without proper tools. So after
three hours the damned car was opened by an ADAC (german automobile club) and
to avoid a bill, I became a member of that club (costs me 37 DM a year). :-/
Then I drove two ppl I met home to Koeln/Bonn and slept in the park of Bonn 
(ppl looking surprised about my clothes... :-) and then drove home. In total
I went 1400km with the car, 200 droven by a friend. But it was worth it.

     Enough said. To summarize Mayday6: All music was pretty new, I'd say from
the last four months. The scene seems to go into deeptrance, nearly everyone
played it, gabber DJs excluded. There were at least 25000 ravers, perhaps
more, around 35000. Ppl I met said that at 1am, as they arrived, many left the
hall, it was like come & go. And the hall was always full, so in total there
must be much more than 25000 visitors. The music was OK, the sound system too, 
the Line Up excellent (though Dark Raver missing... :-( ) but the visual
system could have been better, especially the strobos in the main hall. Not to
mension my request for free water (at raves in general). 5 DM for 0,4 litres
Coke is way to much. And finally: They really could afford protection of the
parking cars!

Rave on at Mayday7: Universe Rave

Dear Adventurer,
          Here's some more info on the Peru trip from India
Supera who traveled to Peru and Bolivia to set up the trip
for us.  She will also accompany us in November as she knows
the territory and the local people very well.




INDIA SUPERA
FEATHERED PIPE FOUNDATION


Dear Friends,

Richard Edelman of the Rim Institute and I would like to
invite you to join Andrew Weil and ourselves on an
exciting journey to the Andes, the heart of Peru and
Bolivia, to celebrate the Total Solar Eclipse.  There is
a special significance to the eclipse here as the
Peruvian culture is rooted in a sun-centered creation
myth.  While most of us think only of the Incas when we
think of Peru, they were just the last of many great
civilizations spanning many thousands of years.  These
pre-Incan peoples thought of themselves as the Children
of the Sun.  The legend of the Sun says that the sun god
Inti sent his first two children to earth - Manco Capac
and his sister consort Mama Oello - to bring
illumination and light to the human race.  Their task
was to find the proper spot to place their gold staff
into the ground.  Cusco, where the staff entered the
earth easily, became known as the naval of the world
from which all life springs.  Manco Capac taught the men
to farm and Mama Oello taught the women to weave.
Archeologists know that weaving originated in Peru and
they think that agriculture occurs earliest in Peru.
This myth weaves strands of masculine and feminine,
light and dark, birth and death.  To be there for the
solar eclipse is like being awake in a dream.

We'll start from the peak experience of the Solar
Eclipse and rise higher. We'll climb to Macchu Picchu,
fly over the Nazca lines, skim across Lake Titicaca, and
cross the altiplano of Bolivia to La Paz, the highest

Are generators the only reasonable power solution for outdoors?  I know
you can use a car battery and inverter to run small stereos and appliances
so couldn't you use a bigger battery or a bank of small ones for outdoor
power?  Then, hooking up solar PV panels is just one more step for clean
no-gasoline power in the day time.  Doesn't Kotoja or some world/raggae
band in the area already do something like this?  It would be cool to get
off the gasonle-powered generators.  This would be quiter and probably
more reliable.  No moving parts to break or gas to run out of.

the amperage required is just too massive to run a sound system off of
batteries, or solar power.  on the other hand, there was a greenpeace
CD which had all acts recorded from a small portable studio which ran
off of batteries which were charged by solar cells.  the rig needed to
bake in the sun all day in order to run for a couple of hours... and
the power requirements for a small console and DAT deck is about
1/1000 what is necessary for a decent sound system.

(out of curiosity, ethan, what does SoundVision pull?  console + DAT
would probably snarf about 50W, assuming a small 8 track console.)

every sunday a large loud soundsystem gets set up in golden gate park
and runs from 10am to 6pm on a single 12 volt car battery

all you need are some modified turntables and mixer to run on 12volts
and you are set

the sound system in the park is the SFRollers sound system. and its always
there and always free. its in the rollerdance area near the bandshell

Hi all!

I'm new to this mailing list so I should probably wait a little longer
before posting, but here it goes.  My friends and I were going through the
MLOL (list of all music-related mailing lists) and we saw SFRaves.  We
decided we should subscribe because we've been talking all year long about
going to a rave and haven't gotten around to it.  Furthermore, after
getting Derek Chung's calendar, we decided we want to try one this weekend
(that is 5/20 or 5/21, preferrably 5/20).  Could some kind soul(s) out
there please reccommend which one we should go to.  It will be a first for
all of us; we're looking forward to the experience.

Thanks in advance,
Nick
cptcisco@leland.stanford.edu

sure.  whatever.  all i know is that the rave in a bag will run off of
two 12V 7AH batteries for 8 hours.  the batteries aren't huge, but
aren't small, and i don't consider it a "loud large sound system".

as you've noted, the mixer and turntables are really a minor issue.
they draw very little even if you used an inverter.  the bigger issue
is how many batteries / solar cells do you need to power three stereo
600 watts per channel amplifiers?

simple math gives the answer: lots.

my last post on this issue...  flame me in private, if you'd like,
Steve.

	Gee.. actually, Nick, my question exactly.  Great reading, 
this list, but this weekend is actually free for me to look for
funstuff.  So, those who're in the know, where's a newbie to go?

Hey Gang--

Well, the college year is over for me, so I'm outta here for a while. 
I'll still have net access, so if ya wanna chat or somethin, just mail me
at the address above and I'll still be able to snag it in Houston.  My
band should have some vinyl out this summer and hopefully a CD by the end
of the year--meaning, *lots* of work for us to do (I'm excited tho :).

Anyway, thanks for the stimulating discussion and the heated arguments
(j/k), and I'll be back in a few months.

Check ya...

A fully charged car battery or two ought to be plenty to run a decent
sized sound system.  We've run our ham radio Field Day in Portland here
that way every year for the last decade.  We run through an inverter to
get AC and probably draw around 2 kW peak with a 25% power factor (i.e.,
about a 500 watt average).  We've sometimes used a generator to recharge
the batteries and then *turned the generator off* :)

Good to have you! Lately, just about everything has been good.

If you're looking for a smaller friendly party, say 50-150 people, I'd
say your best bet is Launch Pad on Sat. It's outdoors, but the weather
forecast is good.

Alternatively, either of the events the MESS (Mother Earth Sound
System) crew is involved with this weekend should also have good music
and a nice friendly vibe.

If you want to twist your head right off your neck, Test 2 on Friday
ought to provide enough Acid and Techno-Trance to get you there.

And if you want a bigger more "Rave" like party packed with sweaty
people there may be a Wicked on Friday. Wickeds almost always go off.
Bring friends though, because the crowd may be a bit intimidating.

Myself, I'm thinking I may stop by MESS on Friday on my way in to the
city. Saturday, no doubt about it: Launch pad II!

i went to what was supposed to be the 'first solar-powered' rock concert
  in peeples park back in 82 in berkeley.  wavy gravy was the host, and
    country joe and the fish were the main act.  they had 6 or 8 arrays
      of cells, each about the size of 2 ping-pong tables; and had been
       charging from sunrize to about noon.  the show lasted for almost
         four hours, and it was LOUD!  
 so supposedly, if you get yer wattages rite and enuf panels, ya can do it!

i've heard this sound system, it sounds like absolute shit.  simple

Newbies:  before you go out, make sure you check to see if the
party has any "age requirements" if you are under 21.  Wicked,
for example, is held in locations that usually require you to be 21
to enter.  The MESS and Launch Pad parties, however, have no such
restrictions.  I'm only telling you this because it would really
suck to make your way to a party only to be turned away at the
door because you are under 21.

Reply-To: boccibob%groovy@us.oracle.com

I'm leaving the Bay area and moving (back) to Boston to start a
company with three friends of mine.

Last chance to buy tapes will be at Launch Pad this Saturday, $10 for
Connection 2 sets (set of 4) and $5 for Carlos...  please come and
lighten my load :-)

It's been great knowing all of you.  I'll inevitably visit and
inevitably will end up going out :-) so hopefully will see y'all.

My last day to read email at boccibob%groovy@us.oracle.com will be May
27th, a week from this Friday.

I will read email at boccibob@media.mit.edu when I arrive in Boston,
roughly around June 6th.  (This address currently forwards here, so
it'll work throughout the transition period, actually.)

I'll be travelling from May 28th until June 5th or so, taking the bulk
of my stuff up to my mom's place near Seattle, and then driving from
there to Boston.

For future reference, if you need to track me down, try fingering me
at boccibob@media.mit.edu.

I'm definitely going to miss the Bay area and all of my friends here,
but I'm excited to get involved with a new undertaking, too!

Bob

i can't remember exactly what the ampere/hour ratings for car batteries
are, but i vaguely remember that it's in the 50-80 range.

12v * 80A/H == 960 watts/hr

A typical 600 watt class A/B amplifier will waste about 1/2 it's power
rating --> in other words, your 600 w playing maxed out will consume
about 900 watts (especially because it'll be closer to class B
operation when it's cranking out 600watts!). Modulo DC-AC inverter
inefficiencies, you can expect a single car battery to last an hour or
so. You might be better off skipping the inverter and using some of
those "cars that go boom" style amplifiers...

PS: I saw one of those solar powered traffic diversion lights sitting
around unattended late at night in the construction area on Guerrero St
in SF. The solar panels ontop of it were pretty large.... Not that I'm
advocating stealing city/state property or anything....

PPS: yes i to have heard the rollerdisco system in GG park. Very distorted,
and not much power. a rave requires big big power. 

PPPS: nuclear power, that's the way to go, it's clean and efficient :-) :-)

	If a 12V battery is rated for 7AH (amp-hours), this means you can
	get 12*7 Watts for 1 hour or (12*7)*X Watts for 1/X hours.  I've
	read that a car battery puts out about 50 amps while you're 
	starting your car, this is 12V*50A = 600 watts.  But you can't 
	get 600 watts out or your car battery for long (re: starting 
	your car in the winter time...)

If it's converted power it may be because you don't get true sign wave
power from DC > AC conversion so it's not "clean" but there's a new
converter that supposedly does this now.

i've heard this sound system, it sounds like absolute shit.  simple

The MDR-7506 is an improved version of the original V6 and replaces it.
The V6 is no longer in production but if you can find it, you might want
to dish out a little bit more for the new & better version.  I had a hard
time finding it but when I did I was very satisfied.

Greetings, Ravers!

It appears that Launch Pad may well be the only "one off" this Saturday,
so we may have a large group of people attending.  It would be helpful
to us all if a few of you could volunteer a little bit of time to watch
the parking lot to ensure things are  going smoothly, etc.

Ethan and I could also use some help in unloading at the site.  As many
people as possible will make very short work of it.  We were imagining
getting the music going by 11, so if some of you could be at the site
around 10:30 to help us move equipment, we would *really* appreciate it.

If anyone has handtrucks/dollies that you could help us with, we would
also appreciate that.  One of ours broke, and is unusable.

Finally, Ethan's truck has broken, and is getting its engine replaced. As
a result, our usual low cost option of just a trailer has been upgraded
to a significantly more expensive requirement for a u-haul truck.  If any
of you attending this event could please donate some money to help defray
that cost (as well as the cost of a 5kW generator), it would really help
us out.  Any donations in excess of our expenses will be given to a
worthy rave-related cause (and not our pockets).

Thank you all, and I look forward to seeing you on the Launch Pad as we
Escape Velocity.

Ameba is near Haight & Cole, on the north side of Haight.  As you can
tell from the timestamp on this posting, I'm not spinning there now!
However, I hope to be there tomorrow afternoon.  Progressive/deep house,
mostly.  I didn't have much luck shopping at BPM today (though it was
fun hanging out there for "DJ treasure hunt" day -- new stuff from the
distributors generally shows up late in the week), but I did find a
copy of the Volume & Tension track that's a favorite of Donald Glaude
and which *I* really dig and will *definitely* play!

The way it works at Ameba is pretty informal so I don't know exactly when
I'll be on deck, but it'll be either sooner or later :)

see you in the future

Hi!  Sorry this is off the topic a little...but I've met a bunch of
people recently who are wearing hemp clothing.  It looks really good
and they say it's very comfortable.  Does anyone know who makes/sells/
designs such clothing and fabric?  I ask you all this mostly because 
these clothes seem to be popular with ravers.

These days I find that I'm wanting very sturdy, warm outdoor-indoor
clothes that have some style and don't look like they're straight out 
of REI or LL Bean or something.  Know what I mean?

Well, it's off to Salvation Army!!  (the one in Albany on Solano is
pretty good, by the way...)

Over the past umpteen years, i've heard lots of talk about
raves and rave culture being a social space that is somewhat
the opposite of standard bar/clubs in that the atmosphere
is less about picking up/being picked up

I'm kinda writing a paper on this, so what i would like to know is:
To what extent do you think this is true or not,
And how do you think the difference affects you?
(do you think it affects the way you dress? people you talk to? etc etc)

im not sure exactly what the point of the paper is going to be yet,
so anything and EVERYthing helps..
the stuff that seems really obvious
and the stuff that seems really trivial

my own experience is incredibly limited, 
so any ideas would be really helpful

also if you want to throw in reasons why you think you
are able to do this, or the reasons for the culture
being this way, that would also be really nice

thanks very much for your time/bandwidth :)

 ,
dana

Oh yeah.  And i dont really feel comfortable mailing this to
lists that i am not on, so if you are on a list other than
SFrave or Socal-raves, and think this might get response
and wouldnt be intrusive, please forward it on.

Thanks again.

Subject: late post on flaming homos
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Hi all, it's time to post:

Remember the discussions about gay ravers a few weeks back?  I bet you
thought that topic was over.  I want to pose a question to help bring
together two topics i've been mulling over, in a humourous way.

I know what a flame war is, after reading sfraves for a month.  

I know many gays that 'flame' in a social kinda way.

What would you call a flaming homo who ignites/fuels a flame war on the net?

Trip 2 last night was cool!  They set up a sweet little ambient room.  I was
in that kind of a gentle mood.  It seems that that 'floor' not the dance
floor was where the more enlightened aspects of the eve. occured.  My younger
friend needs to relax and realize that bigger is not usually better wrt
raving.  (you know who you are.) Friday outings are always a bit challenging.
 
Ananda was a fiasco.  Can you guys get better organized next time.  Maybe
it's not your fault; could be friday carma.  Fridays never seem to *click*.
 Anybody aggree/know why?

 Anyway, I was talking w/ a really *exhuberent* young fella, (very
imaginative dancing guy!,) and the topic came around to my boyfriend, who
just won't rave w/ me.  He just hasn't figured out what hips are for.  This
guy told me that he lives in Santa Rosa, and his best friend, who happens to
be gay, just moved away.  He didn't take the opportunity to hug him good-bye.
 Can he give me a hug.  (Proxie, sort-of maybe?)  He said it would heal some
unspoken feelings he had for his friend, but being straight, or what-ever,
didn't coalecse  A hug - you bet.  Grrrhhh!  Now That Was Unity.  Little
things like that keep me outa da gay bars, and coming back to this family.  

Following this stream of thought, I noticed someone noticed the Gay element
at Wicked these days and posted it.  Cool.  I have to say i'm kinda proud to
be part of the gay posse at clan-o-Wicked.  My buddies tend to put on a bit
of a show.  I don't mind, and I don't THINK other mind.  The problem is when
I have to peel my buddies off of my body; no slither piles on the dance floor
please, i'm trying to groove, okay?

Keep the faith.
Jivala, the first two of each three.

I tend to like Fridays a lot more than Saturday only because of the 
logistics.  Maybe Fridays are bad because people still have some sort of 
load on their shoulders from work, school, or other sometimes stressful 
activity.

I like Fridays because it allows me a chance to exert myself more and 
have all of Saturday and Sunday to recover.  By Monday, I will feel 
physically and mentally prepared to go back to school.  (I'm done with 
finals, hurray!)  But going out Saturday doesn't give me enough time.  
I've really let go sometimes and I feel lethargic when Monday comes 
around to go to class.  I'll feel sluggish, slow, and apathetic until 
sometimes Tuesday.

Fridays are just better.

Yeah, It seems like Wicked is the last remaining party where Gay people can
come and just be really gay without being hassled or shot weird vibes
(like *conform*), I  agree, I don't mind the blatent sex/senuality but some
guys really need to learn to keep their hands to themselves!  Having my
ass grabbed twich at Wicked's I kinda see what women have to go through
and it sucks.  Still waiting for the right woman to grab my ass though :)

Lawdy, testwo was good! A tip of the topper to the SoundVision tag-team 
knob-tweakers, Alex, Jonah and all the others responsible for this one.

I went through absolute owl bus hell to get there, but it was quickly 
forgotten once I finally arrived. Once inside, you can't help but feel 
that something is going right. It really says something when the majority 
of the folks on the floor are dancing and stay dancing. Not to say that 
dancing is the only way to appreciate the music, but it just seemed that 
most of the crowd was really affected by what was going on.

Great space. Great folks. Great job. Don't miss testhree.

Hello,

On alt.rave, Joe (Raver909) recently claimed that raves in the U.S.
rarely play any breaks/jungle/hardcore and that everything is "4 to the
floor, 120 to 135 bpm", ie house.

In your experience, is this true for S.F. Bay Area raves?

respect,

Hello,

I live about 4 or 5 hours from the Bay Area, and so I'm rarely near any
store that might carry any DJ tapes/CDs.

So, is there any place that sells them by mail order?

Or, if anyone has any that they are tired of, and would like to sell
used, then e-mail me.

DEEP FOREST - A Huge Green Brushstroke of Sound!

From a sticker on the cover: "A rare and unusual mix of ambient modern
music and the songs of the Pygmies of the Central African rain forest."

Deep Forest is based on an original idea by Michel Sanchez.
Arranged by Eric Mouquet and Michel Sanchez.
Keyboards and Programming by Eric Mouquet, Michel Sanchez and Cooky Cue
   on "Savana Dance".
Additional vocals:  Michel Villain
Produced by Dan Lacksman


From the liner notes on the Sweet Lullaby CD5:

"Deep Forest is not a band.  Deep Forest is not an artist.
Deep Forest is a concept ... a state of mind.
Deep Forest is music to dance to *and* to listen to.
Deep Forest joins together the hi-tech dance music of modern Europe with
the haunting voices of the rain forest Pygmies of Africa."


From the liner notes on the Deep Forest full-length CD:

"Imprinted with the ancestral wisdom of the African chants, the music of
Deep Forest immediately touches everyone's soul and instinct.  The forest
of all civilizations is a mysterious place where the yarn of tales and
legends is woven with images of men, women, children, animals and fairies.
Not only living creatures, but trees steeped in magical powers.  Universal
rites and customs have been profoundly marked by the influence of the
forest, a place of power and knowledge passed down from generation to
generation by the oral traditions of primitive societies.  The chants of
Deep Forest, Baka chants of Cameroon, of Burundi, of Senegal and of
Pygmies, transmit a part of this important oral tradition gathering all
peoples and joining all continents through the universal language of music.
Deep Forest is the respect of this tradition which humanity should cherish
as a treasure which marries world harmony, a harmony often compromised
today.  That's why the musical creation of Deep Forest has received the
support of UNESCO and of two musicologists, Hugo Zempe and Shima Aron, who
collected the original documents."

1.  Q: What does Deep Forest sound like?

A:  Deep Forest is Ambient Electronic Dance music which skillfully combines
centuries-old Baka pygmy chants from central Africa with Europop rhythms
and a synthesized dance beat.

________________________________________________________________________

2.  Q: How did the Deep Forest project start?

A:  "It was just for our pleasure in the beginning," Eric Mouquet, one of
two French musicians who helped create "Deep Forest," says of the project.
"We just put all the feeling that we wanted into this music, and after we
saw the success, we were very proud."

Mouquet says his partner, Michel Sanchez, found some tapes of Pygmy chant
recorded decades ago and played them after dinner one night.

"It was very quiet, very beautiful," Mouquet said in a telephone interview
from the studio in Brussels, Belgium, where "Deep Forest" was made.
Mouquet then came up with the idea of combining the sounds with their own
music.

They ended up cutting the tapes and mixing them with synthesized music,
drum beats and sound effects, all the while keeping as much of the
original melody and tempo as possible.

Then they took their demos to Lacksman and the songs were entirely
re-worked.  "It was the vocals and the emotion of the songs which attracted
me," he says.

They made a deal with Sony France, then sought to secure the rights to all
the vocals.  They eventually won the backing of UNESCO, which opened its
extensive library to them, and of two musicologists, Hugo Zempe and Shima
Aron, who collected the original documents.

Dan Lacksman comments,  "[Producing the album] has actually been quite a
long process (over a year to complete) and it's been one of the most
enjoyable jobs I've done because we had complete freedom to work on it
until we were happy with it.  We didn't have all the time pressures and
frustrations that you usually have in a recording session so we were able
to experiment.  We did lots of versions of the tracks to see what worked
best. We did four versions of Sweet Lullaby, for example, to try different
tempos. We did a fast version, but it lost its charm so we went back to the
current (slow) style.  While the album, in the end result, might sound
simple, we spent hours or even months on very small details."

3.  Q: How did Deep Forest write their songs?

A:  The songwriting process was unusual because they started with the
vocals and built the rhythms and textures around them.  First they sampled
all the vocals into an Akai S1000 in small sections, cut them up, and used
its time stretching facility to give them a rhythmic structure that would
work with time code.  Lacksman says he didn't know what the lyrics meant in
the first place and, by now, they may be quite meaningless because bits of
songs from different cultures were mixed together to achieve certain
textures and rhythms.

"This is not an ethnic album," he says in defence of his indiscrete
cut-and-pasting.  "But, we did absolutely want to respect the soul of the
songs and we hope that our music will inspire people who don't usually
listen to music from other cultures, to seek some out.  The funny thing is
a lot of African people have told us they really like the album.  Only
academics, purists and musicologists have been negative about it."

The voice samples have been use creatively - the usual cardinal sins of
sampling, like chipmonking and loop glitches, have been used to great
effect.  Sometimes, for example, a voice sample breaks briefly at the loop
point into a strange squarewave-type yodel.  But Lacksman says very little
was done to them in terms of artificial treatment.

There are no acoustic instruments on the album, some vocals were added.
"We wrote out all the lyrics phonetically for the (session) singers so they
could match with the sampled voices.  Then we did a lot of overdubs - 18
tracks bounced down to two, then 16 down to two and so on."

The sampled voices had been mapped out on a keyboard ant then played into
Cubase.  "The idea was to enhance the wonderful singing with the latest
technology and to really blend these old and new cultures."

4.  Q: How did they make the album?

A:  The making of Deep Forest's debut hit album happened in three stages.
Keyboard player Eric Mouquet got involved duing stage two, after fellow
keyboardist Michel Sanchez had laid the groundwork for some tracks by
putting synth ambience to the tribal tunes.  During a brief visit to
Australia, to promote the album and pick up a few didgeridoo samples for
their next project, Eric explained how he got involved and what happened
next.

"One day Michel played me the ambient version of Sweet Lullaby.  At that
stage it had no drums, just the vocals and synth pads.  I really liked it
because I thought he was trying to enhance the African voices, not just fit
them into his musical ideas."

5.  Q: Is Deep Forest sensitive to the cultural heritage of the people
       that they have sampled in their music?

Aware of the charges of cultural exploitation that have been leveled
against similar projects by such artists as Paul Simon and David Byrne,
the "Deep Forest" creators sought advice from experts on African music.

Mouquet says they took the finished album to Francis Bebey, an
internationally renowned journalist, author and musician from Cameroon,
whose 1975 book, "African Music: A People's Art," is considered an
important reference work.

"He said, 'Oh you're right to do something like that, because African
culture is not only for African people.  It's a good way to merge all kinds
of music with something new,'" Mouquet says.

[In order to really help the African people, Deep Forest] decided to give a
percentage of the "Deep Forest" royalties to The Pygmy Fund, based in
Malibu, Calif.  About $25,000 has been earmarked for the fund so far,
[according to] Golden.

The fund's founder, Jean-Pierre Hallet, was honored in Washington with a
Presidential End Hunger Award in 1987 for his work with the Efe Pygmies of
the Ituri Forest in Zaire.  He says he was dubious when first approached
about "Deep Forest."

"When I heard someone had taken their songs and cut them up and added a
disco beat, I said, 'Oh wow, that's terrible to do that to that beautiful
sound.'  Then I heard it," he says.  "It's almost magical music."

Hallet says he has yet to play the album for his Pygmy friends.  His last
trip to Zaire, in May, was cut short by renewed fighting in the country's
civil war.

"I cannot wait to go back and let them hear it,"  Hallet says.  "I'm sure
they will begin dancing -- automatically."

6.  Q: Will there be any more albums?

A:  The band has a contract to do four more albums and Lacksman thinks
they'll work differently next time.  They'll build a new studio for a
start.  "We'll do a lot of demos but this time they'll be recorded on
digital 8-track, so we can use the elements from them in the final mix.  We
want to use sounds from a lot of other countries, too, especially India and
Australia."

Excerpted from "OUT OF AFRICANS" by Leslie Sly from the April 1993 issue of
Sonic Magazine.

________________________________________________________________________

7.  Q: Will Deep Forest ever perform live?

A:  While this project was studio-driven during the recording process, when
they go on stage they'll have three keyboard players, an African vocal
choir, a drummer, a bassist, percussionist and a troupe of dancers.
They'll use the sequencer only to run in some effects and to run the Roland
RSS with the timecode so they can recreate some of the spatial effects on
the album.  "It will be a very high-tech band," says Eric, "but it will be
a real band!  Some of the songs may be longer and the dance aspect may be
more prominent, but it will still be ambient.

"We don't know yet if we'll use a straight-forward stereo PA system or
whether we'll also have speakers at the back of the room to enhance the RSS
effects.  We've got to work this stuff out."

They will tour Europe and the US, and hit Australia by November 1994.

8.  Q: Why did it take so long after its initial release to become
       popular in the U.S.?

A:  First released in the United States in April 1992, "Deep Forest"
attracted little mainstream attention, although the single "Sweet Lullaby"
made it onto the modern rock and dance music charts during the summer of
1993.

Still, the album sold about 200,000 copies in the United States, mainly
through word-of-mouth and alternative radio air play, according to "Deep
Forest" publicist Ellen Zoe Golden.

In the fall of 1993, Sony decided to give it a second chance by signing
hotshot director Tarsem to shoot a new video for "Sweet Lullaby."

-- excerpted from "African Pygmy chants go Europop in 'Deep Forest'" by
Paul Geitner of the Associated Press.

________________________________________________________________________

9.  Q: What is the background on the "Sweet Lullaby" video?

A:  Tarsem (who was born in India and goes by one name) won a Grammy and an
MTV award in 1992 for directing R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion" video.
Despite a deluge of offers, he has avoided the format since then,
concentrating instead on commercials for the likes of Levi's and Adidas.

"They had done a really bad video for it for Europe," Tarsem said in a
telephone interview from London.  "I saw the video and I heard the song
and I thought, 'What a great song -- what a crappy video.'"

Tarsem's version features a little girl (his 4-year-old niece) circling
the globe on a tricycle, searching for the perfect lullaby.  The haunting
melody of the Pygmy lullaby is combined with striking scenes shot in
Moscow's Red Square, at the Great Wall of China, in front of the Taj Mahal
and under the Brooklyn Bridge.

MTV latched on to the lush imagery in 1994, putting the video into heavy
rotation and fueling new interest in the album, which finally cracked
Billboard's top 100.

10.  Q: If I like Deep Forest, are there other groups that I might
        like?

         - Enigma (generally more dark)
    - Dead Can Dance (generally more dark)
    - Will (this is more gothic and dark)
    - Mouth Music - Mo-Di (doesn't have a dance beat)
    - Jean-Michel Jarre - Zoolook

Mathias Thallmayer said, "[Deep Forest] is similar in style and feel to
Enigma.  (If you like Enigma, get Deep Forest. If you like Deep Forest, get
Enigma.)  I prefer Enigma, but Deep Forest is still very nice.  It is not
earth shattering but still worth-while."

Gavin Stok said, "Enigma is VERY different to Deep Forest - I am still to
understand why people say they are so similar... The only similarity is
that they work on the same principle - music layered on top of traditional
sounds.... Enigma is more gothic and traditional than Deep Forest which is
more upbeat and lacking in tradition."

Ad Feelders said, "If you like Deep Forest, I think you should definitely
listen to ZOOLOOK by Jean-Michel Jarre.  More creative use of sampled human
voices. I know the DF-guys have listened to it (especially the title
track!)"

________________________________________________________________________

11.  Q: Where do the chants come from?

A:  The chants chosen come from Pygmies and other ethnic groups in
Cameroon, Burundi and Senegal.

________________________________________________________________________

12.  Q: What does the original Baka music that is sampled in Deep
        Forest sound like?

A:  There are two companion releases produced by Martin Cradick of Outback.
(Released on Hannibal, a division of Rykodisc.)

1. HEART OF THE FOREST
   The Music Of The Baka Forest People Of Southeast Cameroon

This is actual field recordings of the Baka people, on-site in Cameroon.


2. BAKA BEYOND
   Spirit of the Forest

Mathias Thallmayer said, "This album was recorded approximately a year
after Cradick and his wife returned from living with a Baka family group
for six weeks.  "

Comments by Cradick from the liner notes: "Some of these tracks were
inspired by listening to and playing with the Baka.  Some are pieces that I
wrote in the forest with them which I have developed further since
returning to England.  Others are 'covers' of their songs based on
recordings made after giving them our guitar and jamming with them on
mandolin.  I have tried to recreate the spirit of these occasions rather
than copy the music exactly and have included their performances,
especially their percussion, where it helps in this aim."

Mathias Thallmayer comments about the album, "I guess you could say that
this one falls into the World Beat category.  (It is not Ambient Dance like
Deep Forest.)  The music is sprightly, upbeat, and very enjoyable.  The
music is primarily guitar, mandolin, violin, flutes and percussion."

14.  Q: How did they use the equipment on the album?

A:  Eric co-wrote most of the tracks and says this was a long process of
experimenting and fine tuning... "because we wanted to keep the same
feeling throughout the record."  The initial keyboard parts were mostly
written on a Korg Wavestation because "Michel knows that keyboard very well
and gets good sounds out of it."  However, the building of rich
multi-layered pads a lot of vector synthesis via the Prophet VS... "so that
the sounds were constantly moving and we sampled Mini Moog effects and a
lot of our sounds came from the Multi Moog.

"We never used the factory presets and most of the sounds on the records
are combinations.  The flutes, for example, are a combination of samples
and Roland pan flutes.  We used the internal effects on keyboards,
particularly on the JD800 because they're so important to the actual sound,
together with external effects and the RSS.

"We spent a long time on rhythmic sounds and we often used cheap toy-like
keyboards for the loops.  We spent hours adjusting the offsets of the loop
so we could run up to three at once to get a good feel.  Then I'd lay out
drum sets on the Wavestation and play in additional parts to get a live and
not too sequenced feel."

First off, let me put in my two cents worth and say that I think Joe 
has been really reactionary and downright mean on alt.rave with his 
reactive bashing of all dance music forms that are not breakbeat.  

>From what I know from various experiences I've had around the US, 
breakbeat is not as dead as Joe likes to make it out to be.  It is 
happening in Houston.  One of the best DJs in the Southwest spins breakbeat.  
There's the Pittsburg/Toronto axis, there's got to be some somewhere in 
LA (as that is where R.A.W. is from), there's still some in Boston.  
People on alt.rave are always asking about such well-known breakbeat 
producers as the Prodigy (and from that starting point they can be directed 
to other less-well known breakbeat artists).

On the East Coast and in San Francisco house, progressive house, and 
tribal are currently showing a lot of popularity.  A year and a half ago 
on the East Coast hardcore and breakbeat were big.  In fall/winter of 1992 
all I'd ever hear in Boston was breakbeat, all I'd hear in Brooklyn was 
hardcore, and house was unheard of at East Coast raves.  Funny how when 
things change to something someone likes they say "it's about time" and "see 
I told you so" but when they change away from something someone likes they 
bitch and moan.  Human nature I guess :-)

But to answer your question:

>In your experience, is this true for S.F. Bay Area raves?

Until rather recently, it seemed it was hard to find any other form
of music other than the house/funk/trip-hop/disco vein, but over
the past six months I've seen a lot of new parties spring up that 
have been branching out into other forms of dance music. 

Breakbeat (in the UK hardcore sense), however, is rarely heard in San 
Francisco.  There is one DJ I know of in SF who plays breakbeat, and
that is Demigod -- the guy who was putting on the "Apocolypse" parties
at the Haze Theater last month.  He'd bring up R.A.W. from LA to 
spin breakbeat, too.  

Contrary to Joe Lesense's statements that breakbeat (or "jungle" as 
he calls it) brings out a livelier, friendlier, dancier, more diverse 
crowd, the people I saw at the Haze were pretty much just the average 
Haze bunch:  young (since there are so few places in town for under-21's 
to go out), nice enough yet insular (they'll smile and say hi if you talk 
to them, but didn't exactly give off open firendly vibes), and most just 
stood around and watched rather than really dancing.  The people responding 
to breakbeat at parties I've been to back East represented the usual 
cross-section of people who go to raves -- not any more or less wonderful or 
vibey.

After all, it's all just music -- a given genre of dance music isn't 
inherently bad or vibe-killing or extra-good-for-raving or anything like 
that.  It's what the individuals make of it.  Some people think that 
anything faster than 130 bpm is the spawn of the devil, yet I've seen many 
a happy party where people were bouncing along with huge smiles to that
"scourge" of the SF scene:  Brooklyn hardcore.  Some people think that a 
soulful house groove will make a party "right," but I've seen parties 
where someone will start playing deep house and people will leave the 
floor moaning in despair.  (For example, Garth's appearance at one of
the Essence parties in NYC was greeted by "what is this CRAP?" by some
and by frenzied dancing by others.)  I've been to parties where people 
leave the floor if the music is too hard, too dark, too happy, too 
discoey, too slow . . . It's all matter of taste and mood.

The best anyone can hope for is that a critical number of people will 
be happy with the music being played so that the party will continue 
onward in a lively and happy manner.  Claiming that one form of dance 
music is better for this than another amounts to declaring that personal 
taste and personal choice don't matter, and that the person making such 
claims knows the minds of hundreds of party goers better than they do 
themselves.

I was kind of in the same headspace but I trekked up there anyway on the
pretext of only staying for an hour (which, of course, turned into 4).

Lots of people, fresh improvement to the site, great sets from Meme, Will-E,
and Ethan(but I had to leave after that)...happy dancing people.

I'll be back as well...and you and I can help each other through our colds if
we both still have them. :)

Y'alll missed Buck's set which was as good as Ethan's and real different,
which was great.  Will-E was lower energy; I missed Meme.  But what a
great night.  Those irrepressible FluidGroove-sters must have *paved*
the site: four lanes of fresh bouncy asphalt, going nowhere in particular.
I wonder a little bit, tho, with no other 'name' parties, why there wasn't
an even bigger turnoout.  Maybe folks thought it would be cold and didn't
want to go over there an find out.....  There were a few power glitches
but when I left at 5, there were maybe 50 - 60 people there.  With a nearlyy
full moon and a few lights for the dj setup and with various light toys that
people brought, it was suitably festive & primitive at the same time.  a
tad upscale from YSH,, in other words.   Great party.  I'm looking forward
to the one at Kommotion next month.

	TestII was in a great artist loft space- the upstairs had lots of room
	to move around and great lighting.

	The SoundVision system was, as usual, perfectly tuned so that your whole
	body felt the music but your ears weren't damaged. Downstairs chill room
	was also a great atmosphere. 

	Launch Pad sound was the best I have heard at any party- period. The
	new tar pave job reflects the bass and low highs- and nukes the rest.
	It sounded like dancing with headphones on. Great crowd, and great
	djs of course. I only caught Will E and Ethan but both were in fine
	form as usual....

	Ethan and Bryce- you guys are the ultimate tireless NRG generators- 
	thanx for all the hard work! See you all on saturday

I was bored and had a few mintues to kill on my lunch break
so i decided to wander through our beloved campus bookstore.

Walking up to that wonderful section on computer books
(with the prominantly displayed and oh-so-colorful, Joy of X book)
and sitting there, also prominantly displayed, was this book
THE INTERNET WHITE PAGES
which i guess is a somewhat companion of the Internet Yellow Pages
made by some different people i believe

but anyhow...
in this wondrous book is a collection of email addresses
of everyone and their dog who has posted something somewhere
to somesuch public place... (actually i think it said
that they got some program to go through and snag
all the Usenet posters)

i dunno, it felt incredibly intrusive, but at the same time
kinda cool seeing my name there
although Greg Earle is much hipper, having two accounts listed
i looked for all my other accounts, but i guess i didnt post
during the right time frame or something

so anyways, if youre bored and want to go look up who the
person who sat behind you in geometry to see if they
have an email account, this seems like a nifty way to do it

everyone i tried to look for (whose account i didnt know)
i had no luck finding even though have of them HAVE email
but i guess they arent social enough or something

What Is Rave ? ( Non-serious post follows ...)

Rave Is : A Sex Orgy! according to a cover expose story in a recent
          issue of Hustler. I think they went to a party with lots of
          simulated(?) sex acts.

"Rave" Is : A new "men's" magazine (lotsa picturs of nekkid gals).

"Rave" Is : A women's clothing store in the big shopping mall a few
            miles from me.

"Rave" Is : A shampoo.

 Anybody else know of a commercial use of the word "rave" that really
doesn't have anything to do with the original meanings of the word , or
dance parties?

There must be a RAVE company that makes all these low priced products 
that make shampoo, cigarettes, hair spray.  I see them all the time for 
$.99 at my local convience store.  I get a big kick out of showing 
people RAVE cigarettes at raves.

Namco refers to their "Galaxian 3" mega-huge laserdisc ride/arcade game
(much like Operation Starblade) as a "Rave War".  Since they advertise it
on all their other recent games, you can see "Rave War" stickers on Ridge
Racer, Suzuka 8 Hours 2, and other games...

Whatever.  My favorite Japanese arcade game title was the ship from a 
deservedly forgotten laser game called _Interstellar Fantasy_.  You were
the "Ferald Runcer".

I had a wonderful time at launch pad!  it was great to see so many of
you.  I also want to thank those of you who helped load and unload
the sound system: phil, will-e, lane, and sun.  there were others who
helped, too...forgive my memory lapse. big thanks to sean for the
lighting and lasers...that was way cool fun.  next time we'll know that
we *must* have a bigger generator to run the sound system, lights, and
more, and not have to watch the generator so closely.  i felt really
bad that the sound cut out at all...an important fact for the collective
memory is that sound vision plus extras requires at least a 5kW generator.
and major props to the DJs, the dancers, and to several very special 
people.  At one of the Liquid Airs, one of the people who reside near the
site told us about the location we used for Launch Pad....extra special
hugs and thanks to him for that information.  And, a special thanks to
two other residents who helped us drive the truck directly to the location
of the sound system when we were done.  that saved us all a lot of work.
A big hug and thanks to them.

i also want to thank those of you on the list who responded to my request 
for donations.  Ethan and I were able to pay cash for all the items that
we needed to rent in order to provide launch pad with the full on Sound
Vision system, generator, juice, munchies, and whatnot.  We had $24 left
over.  We've been thinking of reinvesting the money in the next launch
pad (or similar party), or donating it to a rave related cause.  If you
have a strong preference with what we should do with this money, please
let us know, and we will follow the desires of the consensus.

i'm really thankful for a great party, and i'm looking forward to 
participating In The Light.

i can now think of three pieces of received (and named) wisdom from the list:

Resonate's Rule: "you know the sound is perfect when you don't wear earplugs"
Kawakami's Corollary: "You know it's a party when Captain Crunch dances"
Ramstad's Constant: "The first and last X minutes of a DJ's set will differ
                     from the body of their work"

pardon my paraphrases if i do not correctly reflect your original intentions.
any errors in quotation are purely mine. Any additions?

	You know Donald?  He must be one of the most unknown DJs outside of
his area (Seattle), thats also one of the best DJs on the west coast.
I'm serious, we've brought him out to Salt Lake City twice now, and
he's completely blown us away every time.  Not to belittle or put
them down, but I seriously think he's better than Garth, Thomas, and
Carlos (some other big names we've brought out here).  He knows how
to build the energy with european techno (not too fast, he pitches it
down a lot), and once you think you're going to go crazy from the
amount of energy that he's built up on the dance floor, he releases
it all with a beautiful house track that makes the party _go off_! 
You people in SF don't know what you're missing.  Not very many DJs
that I know can do the insane 4 or 5 minute long house mixes that he
does and keep the beats perfectly in sync.  Not to mention the
cutting and scratching that he is a master at.  I seriously think he
blows away most of the Wicked DJs, and his price is probably a
quarter of what they charge.  Check him out if you get a chance.  Bye
for now.

Ameba is near Haight & Cole, on the north side of Haight.  As you can
tell from the timestamp on this posting, I'm not spinning there now!
However, I hope to be there tomorrow afternoon.  Progressive/deep
house, mostly.  I didn't have much luck shopping at BPM today (though
it was fun hanging out there for "DJ treasure hunt" day -- new stuff
from the distributors generally shows up late in the week), but I did
find a copy of the Volume & Tension track that's a favorite of Donald
Glaude and which *I* really dig and will *definitely* play!

The way it works at Ameba is pretty informal so I don't know exactly
when
I'll be on deck, but it'll be either sooner or later :)

see you in the future

Kudos to all you wonderful people who put on the Launch Pad.  To those of you
I talked to, and met for the first time; Ethan, Bryan, Sean, Lee, Lane, Sean,
Alyssa, Bob, GeoffW  Tamara, Cap'n Crunch, and Brian, was I really having
that much fun? I sure thought I did. I was so happy to be back on the road
with my rave buddy Forest, crawling around the streets of the industrial
wasteland, looking for the Launch Pad. What a spot!!!! A kind of twilight
zone,  blending the beauty of nature; the stars, the ocean, and the twinkling
lights of Sf, with the belching smoke of a mamoth power plant, "the vast
 blackened runway of the launch Pad, and assorted gargantuan industrial
factories. I felt safe, and among friends, and was dancing from the time
Will-E started spinning. What was that first record he played anyway? God it
was rich, textured, and beautiful! Ethan just kicked it! Straight-ahead dance
your dance off music; that could of  knock you back like a stiff drink of
tequila.  Thanks to Bryce too, you guys wer just great!!! I'm gonna work hard
this week and hope to see you all "In The Light."  Robertj---Monterey

This took place Sunday night, May 22, at 55 Natoma.  My friend and I got 
there around 1am.  Neither one of us had valid IDs and it was 21 & up, but we 
both got in with no problem (that's a good start to any evening).  :)  

It seemed like a good crowd for a weekly party, but then I haven't been 
to Spundae's before, or if I have it's been so long I've forgotten.  
Probably 2-300 people, which is a lot more than were at Lift on a 
Thursday, the last time I was at the space a couple weeks ago.

I'll start with the negatives:  Most of the people there seemed more into 
style than positivity.  (Although on the bright side, there was a lot of 
skin and mouth-watering bodies on display!)  I didn't encounter any 
stuffed animals, goofy outfits or toys, and there weren't a lot of smiles.  
A couple guys got into a minor scuffle/verbal exchange in the hallway.  There
wasn't really an ambient space, although there were two separate high-energy 
dance areas.  And they were charging $.50 for water at the bar, although 
we got around that by picking up discarded cups and bringing them back 
for "refills", which were free.

Now the positives:  Yippetty-yay!  I had fun!  I would like to thank 
Carlos, Henrik, and Markie Mark, who were the three DJs whose sets I 
enjoyed enough to make it a point to find out who was spinning.  I'm not 
a music techie, but Markie's entire set was *amazing* :)  One track he 
played that I'd heard before called "What Is House Music?" that I 
especially like, was either a mix I hadn't heard or a helluva job 
scratching, it sounded totally preprogrammed like part of the record, but 
it looked like he was doing it himself... wow.  I appreciated Mike of 
Communion, who showed me some of his cool artwork, and also had copies of 
Martin's excellent FEEL newsletter on hand (check out the Signs of Inner 
Peace symptoms).  Mostly Spundae's was hot, sweaty, and full of energy.  
Reminded me of Geoff's and JSL's review of that Wicked party in the 
bassment of 1015 Folsom.  By the time we left, my legs were rubber.  
Guess we had to get our sorry asses home before the beats stopped 
kicking... ;)  I also found some X for $20.  I haven't taken it yet, so 
of course it could be bunk, but my intuition sez no.  My advice is, it's 
still around, don't pay more than $20 a hit.  Also, a big hug & smile out 
to Kirk, the hippie-lookin' dude who gave us some good vibz & a hug 
apiece on his way out.

Th-th-th-that's all folks!  8)-

Wow! What a party.

Many, many thanks to all of *you* who came out and helped generate the
thick, thick vibe, load the gear, dance, smile and help cover our costs.
Really, really appreciate it! 

Beautiful night: Clear skies, Oakland twinkling across the bay, steam from
the huge smoke stack surreal through the night, 3/4 moon slowly setting
behind the djs.....

Great music all night. Meme is really coming on strong; excellent,
excellent set. Really gonna miss Will-E and Phil: great guys, loads of
positive energy and Will-E is a hell of a dj :) I had loads of fun on the
decks despite a cranky generator; won't make that mistake again. Buck was
excellent as well, took him a little while to settle down but once he got
there he cranked. Probably see more of him in the future, he seemed to like
what we're about. Lee was killer as usual and his friend Gary gave us taste
of the LA sound which was an interesting change of pace too; real different
style than we're used to up here.

Nice to meet some of our more far flung sfr family, too  :)
Really one of the more positive expereinces I've had in a while.
Thanks again, couldn't have done it without you!

love always

Yes, Donald Glaude used to go by the DJ name 'Dominator' but in the last
year or so he's been just plain Donald which is fine by us.  He's the
best known 'underground' DJ in Seattle, and has played some elsewhere as
well.  To me, Donald is like the West Coast's answer to Derrick Carter,
as Luke mentioned he goes for the faster/harder "Detroit" techno sound
which still has that housey flavor to it (which is why Volume & Tension
is right up his alley, and yes I *did* play it yesterday at Ameba as my
final track in fact -- but it took my whole set to get the BPMs up to
that level :)

One of the better events I've been to recently was up in Seattle where
Donald had the clean-up position (4th in the order for you non-baseball
fans!) of an excellent Barry Weaver-Ernie Munson-Dub Tribe-Donald lineup.
You know how Carlos gets animated when he's spinning?  Donald is sort of
like that except he gets *pumped*, and he was pumped that morning!

Hi all, Phil and I are leaving Friday morning to go back to New York 
so the last party we hope to make is the FMR.  Anybody know when it is?

re: launch pad
Thanks to everyone for an amazing party.  You all have a wonderful scene
going here and I am very jealous and not looking forward to returning to 
the east coast.  Within the next few months you can be sure that we will
be thinking about moving here in the near future.  

It was great to meet a bunch of you finally.  What a party!  Wicked vibe,
space, sound system, everything was just right... except that I was way
tired.  Went to Test II the night before and stayed until the very end
helping pack the sound system away.  I haven't had this much fun since I
lived in England!  I'm certainly going to miss this community.  Special
big hugs to Bryce & Ethan for welcoming Phil and I, Tamara for coming all the 
way up from LA, and to everyone (especially Laura & Brian) for making us feel 
at home.  :)

I love opening with that track, a number of people kept asking me what that was.
It was "Sunrise on Epsilon" by Aurasphere (which I think is a pseudonym 
for Damon Wild or Bio-Dreams) on EX-25 (EXperimental records out of New York).
Every track on there is thick and beautiful.  This was a special anniversary 
double-pack that was pretty limited... I think only 500 were pressed.  This is 
a consistently good label to keep an eye on.

There are some great parties happening this weekend it seems and I'm a bit sad
that we're going to have to miss it.  We found a really cheap flight that only
flies once a week and we already have round trip tickets.  So you all have to 
have lots of fun for us!

not to "me too" but my sister used to frequent the record store Donald
worked at (in Tacoma) so i've listened to a couple of his tapes and
i've seen him spin a few times.  an excellent DJ.  probably one of the
best people at working a crowd i've ever seen --- and he seems very
aware of how the crowd is reacting.  many of the local DJs who get the
crowd off seem to do it without really looking at the crowd, they just
run through their stack 'o slabs 'o vinyl and either the crowd gets it
or not.  Donald adjusts what he is doing to how the crowd is reacting,
and can sense that energy flow that's so important.

if he was down here, he'd be a rave-household name.

for those Seattle scenesters, he went by DJ Dominator back in, oh,
around 1990...

Will-E mentioned Experimental and I also want to put in a positive note
for that label as well; I used their EX-27 release Shapechanger/Crystal
Dreams double pack yesterday @ameba; excellent stuff.  The track I played
was Analytic Groove; it says, "All tracks produced, written, arranged and
mixed by Cari Lekebusch.  Recorded in Sweden at Flow Motion Sound Studios,
Stockholm."  So there's some Swedish trance-techno for ya :)  One of the
things I find most intriguing about all this is the trans-national aspect
of recording now.  Detroit musicians go to the UK or Germany.  Swedes
get their stuff released in New York.  Ken Ishii from Japan gets his stuff
released from the UK.  Pete Namlook from Germany and Mixmaster Morris from
the UK collaborate.  A lot of this goes back to the UK-Jamaican reggae
connections that spawned the likes of the work that Adrian Sherwood has
produced for so many years at On-U, combining talent from all over.  
I think the Net may yet become a channel for further such collaborations.

I'd be interested to hear what you mean by the "LA sound" - if there is one,
which if there is I guess I just didn't notice, it's nothing very different.
But what did this guy play?

Launchpad-

        We (Lain, Tim, Glen & me)  got to Launchpad around midnight or
so while Will E. from New York was spinning.  The evening
was PERFECT- no wind, not very cold, but certainly not too warm either. 
The terrain, of course, is about as much like a blast site as I've ever
seen..no green stuff hardly at all, just water, gravel and a huge
asphalt landing strip type place.  When we arrived, there were maybe 100
or so people there with lots of people dancing.

        Then someone got a large fire going, which always makes
outdoor raves feel more communal, more like an urban festival.
The darkness was very beautiful, with the close-to-it  full moon shining
overhead behind the dj.  For future reference:  you know those wooden
platforms you can find outside stores, and so on...I don't know what
they're called, but they make decent fire wood.  Does anyone know
whether those are re-used?  

        Ethan went on after Will E., and his set was EXACTLY the dance,
then trance music I wanted to hear, although it was a drag  the sound went
 down  a couple of times, mostly because (I guess..) the generator was too weak
to power the sound system AND the nifty laser Sean brought.  People
liked the laser and black lights, and also the glow-in-the dark 
string in front of the turntables..a couple of kids  were twirling it around and
dancing with it.   After Ethan, Buck went on, but I didn't hear much of
his set as I wanted to catch up with some old friends.  When we got
back, someone had turned on the BRIGHT BRIGHT lights in the parking lot
of a nearby warehouse, which was kind of bummer.  It was just too harsh,
I thought.  

        When the sun came up, people who had been kind of standing
around talking suddenly got energized and started to dance...it was neat
to see 20+ people spread out over the tarmac all dancing the
morning together.  Also, a few new people arrived who were itchin' to
boogey and you know how infectious that is!

        More about the spot itself:

There's a power plant nearby there...it's most prominent feature
is an ENORMOUS smoke-stack that contributed a continuous column of
vapors to the atmosphere all night long and into the day.  Does anyone
know what that stuff is?  (steam, maybe?) It was separated from
Launchpad by an inlet of water..the only way to get to the power plant
was to go along a narrow  path that crossed over the outlet for a
drainage pipe. But of course, there was a fence there:  a single unit of
six-foot-high chainlink fence to prevent anyone from getting on to the
land where the power plant was.  

        I noticed this as we came in: Not far up from the Launchpad
site, there was a man (?)  sitting next
to his tent staring into a fire.  I suppose he lived there because he
looked very much settled in for the night, almost cosy.  It occurred to
me that if I were going to get kicked out of my apartment for whatever
reason, I would try to live like him...i'd use my last dollars for a
tent and camping gear and try to find a peaceful place.  But things
weren't especially peaceful Saturday night!  Anyway, I hope he came over
to check things out.  Does anyone know if he did?

        All in all, a good party!

They are called "pallets" and I've posted here before that you can
pick them up for free at a post office warehouse in SF.  Unfortunately,
at this moment I can't recall exactly where that office was . . . I
remember how to get there:  Go East on Army to 3rd, turn right on 3rd, 
the 2nd Left should be where the post office is.  It's really just a big 
warehouse.  By the side door there was a big stack of these things with a 
sign on them that says something like "free wood." If anyone's got a 
pick up truck they should swing by there.

If anyone happened to save my original message from March?? with the 
exact street address and directions it would be cool if you mailed it
back to me.  Thanks.

personally I LOVED Steve Austin.  the occasional person would think
that he was white, which led to some pretty weird situations, i'm
sure.

i think it might be fun to do something similar.  no reason why a male
DJ couldn't use a feminine name, or vice versa...

Oops guess I stuck my foot in it :) No offense intended. Generalizations
are so dangerous...but to clarify: seems a lot of the djs from LA that I've
heard are just a lot more *active* kind of in a hip hoppy sense though this
doesn't imply that the music is necessarilly hip hoppy...but in this case
lots a backspins, hard beat motivated transitions as opposed to long mixes,
very progressive/ravey housy, lots of hooks, and vocal gadgets...I'd be
curious to hear Lee describe it as I'm sure he could do a better job than
I'm doing...

Weekend rave report
===================

It was yet another sleepless weekend for me.   I decided to take in the Friday
Dakota event at 1015 Folsom which turned out to be pretty good,  although things
ended a bit early for me (3:30am).

Dakota had almost all of the 1015 facilities opened,  including the new upstairs
outside area which they did up very nicely with gas umbrella heaters,  tables
and comfortable chairs.   It provided excellent chill-out opportunities so one
can cool down from dancing.   In the front room was mostly funkey acid jazz
(but I wouldn't really call it that).    Jeno was spinning in the basement,
which explained by everyone left the main room at about 2:30 am.   Even down
in the basement was much much cooler than the last Wicked event held there.

Upstairs in the bar area,  Craig Larson had a video phone hooked up to a rave
event in Texas,   but they had problems with the sound,   so all we got to 
see was the pictures (very jerkey,  and low resolution).   They couldn't get
the ATT phone's video to patch directly to the wide screen monitor.

In the main room,  the graphics was reallky great.   As well as some insane 
house music that kept me on the dance floor most of the time.

At about 4:30,  we head over to the Alley Cat (1190 Folsom),  to do more
dancing.    First time I spent time in there,  when there were a lot of people.
Really great crowd,   although much smaller than 1015 Folsom (Space is also
smaller).   Front area is a restaurant,  and a bar,  serving food,  and the
dancing is in the back room (Rather small) surrounded by mirrors.

The DJ clan was the SPAZ group,  really pumped out the tunes,  and kept up
the beat all night long.

Finally,  around 6:30 We head back to Mill valley and went hiking for most
of the beautiful day.    Couldn't manage to get any sleep,  but in the life
of a dedicated raver,   sleep is something I do when I want to dream or
something.



Launch pad II
-------------

Saturday evening,   I get on the net a while,   looking to find the location
for Launch Pad II,  an SFRaves event which I really try hard to attend.
It was advertized via private Email to be an outside event,   and we didn't
learn of its location until about 9:30.    We learned it was to be in one
of the usual outside locations which I'll decline to mention because so far,
it's a good bust-proof site,   but now made even better when we learned that
it was paved over with asphalt which made dancing a lot easier.   Another
advantage of ths site,  is that you cannot hear the music from the street
(or any other occupied spot).    Plenty of parking available also provided
the spread of cars in such a way as to not attract police attention.

A large yard with huge unoccupied buildings shielded us from outside observers,
so not even the fire could be noticed unless one were to fly directly over.

The tide was out,  so from the Bay side,   boats couldn't come any closer
than 1000 feet.

Not far away,  a fire was burning and provided an ideal chill space (or 
warm up space).   DJ's were the SFRaves crew,   Ethan, Tamara, Lee,  and
Buck plus a few others I didn't know from before.    Dispite the fact that
these aren' the "big name" DJ's,  I like them better because they experiment
more with the music and come up with some brilliant and varied sets,  not
just sticking to the usual 123 BPM stuff.

Dispite this being my 2nd sleepless night,   I had an amazing amount of energy
digging the really trancey set of tunes.   With the site location not being
in the prettiest place,  the smoke stack against the sky produced a rather
eerie visual stimulation,  enhanced by a tune that Lee started off with
the sound of race cars and airplanes zooming around,  had me looking for
"things coming out of the sky".   Lee pumped out some incredible spacey
acid trance I've heard in a long time.    The weather was very cool, clear
and perfect for dancing. 

The Sunrise (3rd one since I slept last),   was awsome...  as San Francisco
started to wake up on a Sunday morning.   Things eerily quiet at our site,
nobody around at 6:30 in the morning,  but few people remaining,  and fewer
people dancing.    Most huddled by the fire,   or crashed out on pads
layed down on the asphalt parking lot which was empty of most cars.

Ethan went on the turn tables at 7:00 am and played some of his newer
and stranger trancey stuff,  and switched off with one of his friends
as we we started picking up the trash and shutting down.

I eventually leave around 7:30,   and later on,  hung out at the End Up
or Light-n-up after-party for most of the afternoon.   Still not ready
or capable of sleeping yet.    Finally got back home around 4 or 5,  and
after a refreshing shower,   finally crashed....   Ahhh!  What a GREAT!
weekend...

I thought it was definitely a British sound.  Hard progressive house I'd call
it.  Whenver I looked over I saw familiar British labels like Stress.
It started out kinda dark & hard but not too fast and then got a lot lighter
and happier.  It reminded me mostly of the more mainstream (by their standards
certainly not our standards  :) prog house that gets played in the bigger
clubs. I don't know how this relates to the LA scene since I've never been.

just my $.02

	When I first started spinning, my friends wanted to call me "DJ
Debbie."  It was funny because they tried to picture the reaction by
the crowd when they saw me spinning.  This is about what they
pictured happening:

Newbie: Who is that spinning right now?
Oldbie: That's DJ Debbie.
Newbie: DJ Debbie?  Are you sure?
Oldbie: Yeah, it is.
Newbie: But, he's not female.
Oldbie: No...
Newbie: Is he gay?
Oldbie: No...
Newbie: Then why does he call himself DJ Debbie?
Oldbie: I dunno, he just does, probably so people like you will get
their interest piqued and ask lots of questions about him...

It was pretty funny, maybe you just had to be there at the time...

In a similar vein, I thought about using the name "Matt Hardkiss" next

How-de-do,

i reference to Geoff's coment on wickeds being one of the last places
where there is a large visiable gay element: that is part of the reason
that i go to wickeds.  the group i go with tends to be very well mixed
up and when people are relaxed enough to enjoy themselves in whatever
way they feel things go off and great times are had.  Also IMHO a strong
gay mix in a party kills the pick-up scene, you actually might have to
get to know someone b4 crusing them, imagine that?!?

in a semi related story. The mayday wicked (beltan) i took a friend of a
very dear friend of mine for to the party.  She was suposed to take him
but needed to do other things that night.  this was his first party and
EXperiance of a wicked.  several hours into it he comes up to me with a
smile and a bewildered look: "a girl just asked me if i was gay straight
or bi?..............." wickeds are on of the few places where none of
that really matters so i told him "here it doesn't matter".  he bounced
away happy.

that is freedom

peace

Great! Now you've done it!  Now we won't be able to keep him here in
Seattle for small partys.  Everyone is gonna wanna book him.

Actually I was wondering when someone was going to find out our little
secret about Donald.  I have watched the man in awe for a couple of years
now, and still can't belive half the shit he does.

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Hello... I don't want to seem the dick or any thing but I think your public
review or Spundae was a little bit un-cool.  I love Spundae and would love to
keep it around for a while.  I know you meant well but posting a public
message saying that you not only got in under age (which personally I have no
problem with) but that you bought drugs inside is very un wise.  I hate the
Idea that one should be paranoid on the net but lets be serious... anyone
could have read that post.  Of course nothing will probably come of it but I
do know that it is not impossiable. All clubs in San Fransisco have a very
hard time with the age thing (I hate the age thing too and I'm over) and
Spundae has had real problems with this as well as drugs.  I know it goes
with being a club... but Spundae is often visited by the police and have many
times arrested people in the parking lot while they were doing somthing in a
cor or whatever.  I know I have been searched before.  For some reason the
cops "like" Spundae.  All it would take is for one of the nice officers who
often check out the inside to notice yo lookin young and ask for your ID.
 Any way I sholdn't go on like this but please in the future do not
advertise.  Why do you need to broadcast?  Besides $20 is not a "good" price
for X.  Thanks and sorry for the long windedness.
Love

I just wanted to add my thanks to the Launch Pad crew for a
really fine party.  Janie & I were still recuperating from a
4 day hiking trip so we couldn't stay much after Ethan's set,
but we had a great time.  The Djing was stellar (Meme, Will-E,
Ethan).  Will-E's set was a special treat, as I have never heard
him before - hope you visit us again :-) 

It was fun seeing lot's of SFRavers, as well as lot's of new,
young, unfamilar, friendly faces.  Many people were sharing
candy, toys, etc.  Lately, I've been getting a sense at many
parties that there has been an influx of fresh warm vibes into
the house/rave scene.  Even though the fad aspect of raving may
be on the wane, I'm beginning to see that we have a culture here 
that people want to perpeturate - a simple one of trust and the
sharing of good feelings towards one another.  If humanity is
ever going to spiritually evolve, this is how it might begin.

BTW, was I the only person who notice the crop circle patterns
in the gravel right next to the site?  Does anyone know the *real*
reason why that big slab of asphalt, the "Launch Pad" was put
there?  It would be pretty cool if the first encounter aliens
have with humans happens at one of our renegade raves.  I hope
the DJs have some special records set aside for such an occasion.

P.S. i brought a 10 lb bag of oranges to the last wicked. didn't it past
the door, although markie had mailed me with an okay.  The people who
own the space and therefore get the bar don't want anything that might
detract from the bar.  they have the ultimate say.  but on a lighter
note the door held the bag and it was quickly devoured by those of us
that stayed allnight.

man, I love this thread . . . 

The best part of Wickeds is the Music.

The second best is being gay, being weird, and fitting right in.  Breeeeep!

The third thing is not being sized up by everyone person in turn, the long
stare, the body wash from hairdo to crotch size, and then a yes/no this brain
is receptive to you look.  I went to Pleasuredome sunday night.  The music
was great. The vibe was way better than expected.   But I was by myself, and
I felt ice in the air.  After finding the faith with you guys, I can't handle
that other attitude any longer.

Thanks for being my friends.

>From SRL's FTP site: (JPG on CyberDen's anon ftp in the industrial pictures

	SRL will be staging a major performance in San Francisco on May 28th.
The location is tremendous (see jpg image file showing site). We are accepting
donations of just about any kind of stuff in large quantities that could be
perceived as having any connection with the apocalypse, or more precisely, that
point of intersection where the survival instinct nuzzles up to the death wish
(this is the general theme of the show, watch this site for a convoluted
phrasing that will be more specific). We are especially interested in unusual
signage or large pre-assembled props. We also need a doomsday clock, preferably
digital, for the countdown.
	We are also open to any borrowing from individuals or companies with
access to high-energy physics devices, heavy equipment, military weapon
systems, process equipment, industrial robots, and any and all electronic,
mechanical, hydraulic, components. 
	Further, we are accepting volunteer assistance of skilled and
non-skilled types. Almost any kind or level of skill is applicable. No careless
psychotics please. E-mail to mark@SRL.ORG or call 415-641-8065. Thank you, and
remember, your kind assistance can help make this an apocalypse to remember.

Aaaak!  Another post,

I seem to be online more and more. . . 

I rarely hear reviews about Thomas at Wicked.  Marky's always in the news.
Just wanted to say I enjoyed both of Thomas's last sets at Wickeds, missed
him at the last one, and look forward to hearing him next time.  Anyone know
where his spins outside of Wicked?  Let me know.

Thanks, discoboy

From the '24 SEVEN' May issue:

	MAY: so-called after the Roman goddess MAIA.
	  This is the month of morris dancers and
	    Maypoles, a month to CELEBRATE life
	     and FREEDOM, especially dedicated
	      to DANCING away your wintery
	      worries. This is the month of
	      LIFE! If you were born in the
	       first part of May, you're a
	       TAUREAN which means you're
	      likely to be reliable, depend-
	        able and determined. This
	      year, May 22nd marks the divi-
	      sion between Taurus and GEMINI
	       those born under the sign of
	   the twins are cheeky, gifted people
	 like Geminian GEORGE BEST. This sign is
	 also associated with good communicators
	including MORRISEY and BOB DYLAN.

OBRAVE: 24 Seven is a new (I think) UK magazine about music and fashion.
	Then, it remainded me the Gemini party held by YSH in this period
	last year. If I remember well it was the second, and the first
	outdoor. I had a great time.

	BTW: I missed (sigh!) Launch Pad II, but the description of the
	place remainded me the one I mentioned. I remember this stripe
	of cement, good for the turntables and as a small dance area.
	Was Launch Pad in the same place ?

Looking for 'In the light'...

Ciao,
	Raffaele

Told ya so! I don't know how many times people have said "rave is
dead", but as long as people want to throw and attend underground
parties, it is being kept alive. There is a very healthy underground
scene going on in SF, and even I am surprised at how good it's gotten.
The quality and variety of the DJing is outstanding. And people are
coming together and donating their efforts to make free and
inexpensive parties happen. Wow!

And speaking of good feelings, I want to suggest stopping by Ameba
when they have something going on or just about anytime. Every time I
stop by there, I just get the best vibes. And I've never written
anything about it, but Allen and Mark and the rest should get some
recognition as going above and beyond to bring people together.

To all those people making it happen, thanks. I know it's worth it to
you, and I want you to know you're part of a really good thing.

:)

I want to thank everyone who has been helping me with preparations for
In The Light.  To many of you who have offered your assistance, I 
apologize for not getting back to some of you.  We have an equipment
loading crew in place, and I'm pretty much out of flyers, but there are
still a few things that people can do.

We will have an information table.  If anyone was any interesting
literature laying around, old USENET posts, drug info sheets, artwork,
poetry, anything positve or educational, please xerox and bring a stack.  
If there is anything that makes SFRavers unique, it is our access to
information.  It makes sense that we should foster communication at our
parties (especially ones that take place in the light and amongst the
public).  It would of course be great if someone could duplicate the
sfraves info sheet that we've handed out in the past, or even the sfraves
or alt.rave FAQ.

Whoever has it, please bring the SFR banner.

Stuff to share: fruit, drinks, candy, toys, bubbles, flowers, condoms...

Garbage bags: And any help picking up garbage will be greatly appreciated.

Duct Tape - (P-ter & M, do you guys have any left from last time?).

Water jugs or plant sprinkler: There's a water fountain from which  we'd
like to take water to sprinkle  over the dance area to cut down on dust.  
Can someone come early to do this?  

We'll also need some people to come early and move benches back from the 
stage to create a U-shaped dance area.

I'm still accepting donations to offset the costs for all this (about $600).
Although I'm not permitted to solicit at the event, feel free to give what
you can to myself, Janie or Bryce.  I'll be wearing an aqua baseball hat 
with a question mark on the back and can be seen at times hunched over
the DAT machine.   Please come and say "hello", or something equivalent.

The most important thing is that you bring your positive vibes,
dancing shoes, and friends.  Divert all energy from your shields and set 
your Luv Phasers to maximum.  If there is ever going to be a party that 
you'd want to bring your parents or dubious SO to, this is probably it.  

The generator is being delivered to the site at 11:30am.  So yes, we fully
intend to get the music started by noon.  There's plenty of seating, and
shade (and bathrooms, food vendors & museums) - so come early, hang out, 
mix it up, and have fun!

I think I may have mentioned a track 'Volume and Tension' that Donald
plays.  Well, of course that's wrong, now that I have a copy it's plain
as the nose on me face -- the track is 'Bird in the Bush' by Django and
Jolly and the *label* is Volume and Tension.  I played it about half a
dozen times last night -- it's really cool at the very end to shut the
turntable off, spin it up fast and let it spin down through its own
momentum :)  Normally I don't go for DJ tricks like that but it seemed
like the right thing to do at the time . . .!

Donald's playing in Portland this Saturday, in case anyone is here.
I'll be in Seattle myself for the XLR8R/Choclit Factory massive.

c u in the future

Mark has been working at SRL preparing for the show this weekend so we 
have tickets for $10 and a funny story. 

The people who are renting the warehouse space are allowing the SRL show
on the condition that IT IS NOT A RAVE	.  Makes me think we are doing 
something pretty outrageous if Raves have a worse reputation than SRL shows.

They can pull apart a pig carcass with chains but we cant sit on bean 
bags on E. 

Its Late and we have lots of us here and were waiting for directions to 
the FMR.

NSA can crack PGP

A lot of people think that PGP encryption is unbreakable and that the
NSA/FBI/CIA/MJ12 cannot read their mail. This is wrong, and it can be a deadly
mistake. In Idaho, a left-wing activist by the name of Craig Steingold was
arrested  _one day_ before he and others went to stage a protest at government
buildings; the police had a copy of a message sent by Steingold to another
activist, a message which had been encrypted with PGP and sent through E-mail.

Since version 2.1, PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") has been rigged to
allow the NSA to easily break encoded messages. Early in 1992, the author,
Paul Zimmerman, was arrested by Government agents. He was told that he
would be set up for trafficking narcotics unless he complied. The Government
agency's demands were simple: He was to put a virtually undetectable
trapdoor, designed by the NSA, into all future releases of PGP, and to
tell no-one.

After reading this, you may think of using an earlier version of
PGP. However, any version found on an FTP site or bulletin board has been
doctored. Only use copies acquired before 1992, and do NOT use a recent
compiler to compile them. Virtually ALL popular compilers have been
modified to insert the trapdoor (consisting of a few trivial changes) into
any version of PGP prior to 2.1. Members of the boards of Novell, Microsoft,
Borland, AT&T and other companies were persuaded into giving the order for the
modification (each ot these companies' boards contains at least one Trilateral
Commission member or Bilderberg Committee attendant).

It took the agency more to modify GNU C, but eventually they did it.
The Free Software Foundation was threatened with "an IRS investigation",
in other words, with being forced out of business, unless they complied. The
result is that all versions of GCC on the FTP sites and all versions above
2.2.3, contain code to modify PGP and insert the trapdoor. Recompiling GCC
with itself will not help; the code is inserted by the compiler into
itself. Recompiling with another compiler may help, as long as the compiler
is older than from 1992.

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

That site (we all know where it is) has seen way too much use lately.
The people that found it can't even use it because now someone is
doing something there every weekend. It's almost summer and we're
going to start seeing schedule conflicts and promoters fighting over
it. And now that the FMR has graced it, it's likely to crash and burn
just like Bonny Doon. This site is not remote enough and can't
withstand the people pressure of a FMR. The FMR people should know
this, and shouldn't have used the site.

Oh well, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm being naive and everyone will
cooperate and the cops will look the other way.

Why am I bitching to you? Nothing I can do about it...

(Kind of makes one afraid to find a nice outdoor site, eh?)

I was wondering why Donald wasn't on the list for the XLR8R event <heavy
sigh>.  Well I'm still going to be there, if only to watch and be amazed
by Dubtribe (I'd go to a square dance if I heard Dubtribe was going to be
there)

You know, that's really insulting to the intelligence. If you must
post conspiracy theories to the list, at least make them entertaining
so we get *something* out of them.

I have passed this message onto some folks who can verify or debunk this
   drivel.  While it is possible that it is true, please be advised that
   this is almost certainly bullshit:
 - anyone who's ever met Richard Stallman (head of the FSF and the original
   author of gcc) would know better than to suggest that he could be
   coerced by anyone, much less the CIA or IRS.  The FSF makes far too
   little money to get into any serious trouble with the Feds.  It also has
   excellent accounting and management support.  Even if there was an error
   somewhere, the IRS would have a lot of fun retrieving that $52.16 in
   back taxes :-)

 - I have not received any confirmation of the Steingold story.  What
   probably happened is that he did something stupid, like used a computer
   that wasn't really secure.

 - the number of people who peruse the software packages in question in
   their work, research, maintenance, and porting efforts is astronomical.
   While possible, it seems unlikely that a hole would pass entirely
   undetected.

 - The story conatins factual errors.  For example, the author of PGP is
   PHIL Zimmermand, not "paul".  

At any rate, I'm awaiting official debunking, but I don't think people
   should worry: verified accounts have already reported several cases
   where PGP was unable to be broken in real law enforcement cases.
   (curious? go to the library and backscan the NYTimes and Wall St Journal
   for related material - I think the articles were published in the last
   month or two)

I'll post more info as I get it.

Enjoy,

NSA can crack PGP

A lot of people think that PGP encryption is unbreakable and that the
NSA/FBI/CIA/MJ12 cannot read their mail. This is wrong, and it can be a deadly
mistake. In Idaho, a left-wing activist by the name of Craig Steingold was
arrested  _one day_ before he and others went to stage a protest at government
buildings; the police had a copy of a message sent by Steingold to another
activist, a message which had been encrypted with PGP and sent through E-mail.

Since version 2.1, PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") has been rigged to
allow the NSA to easily break encoded messages. Early in 1992, the author,
Paul Zimmerman, was arrested by Government agents. He was told that he
would be set up for trafficking narcotics unless he complied. The Government
agency's demands were simple: He was to put a virtually undetectable
trapdoor, designed by the NSA, into all future releases of PGP, and to
tell no-one.

After reading this, you may think of using an earlier version of
PGP. However, any version found on an FTP site or bulletin board has been
doctored. Only use copies acquired before 1992, and do NOT use a recent
compiler to compile them. Virtually ALL popular compilers have been
modified to insert the trapdoor (consisting of a few trivial changes) into
any version of PGP prior to 2.1. Members of the boards of Novell, Microsoft,
Borland, AT&T and other companies were persuaded into giving the order for the
modification (each ot these companies' boards contains at least one Trilateral
Commission member or Bilderberg Committee attendant).

It took the agency more to modify GNU C, but eventually they did it.
The Free Software Foundation was threatened with "an IRS investigation",
in other words, with being forced out of business, unless they complied. The
result is that all versions of GCC on the FTP sites and all versions above
2.2.3, contain code to modify PGP and insert the trapdoor. Recompiling GCC
with itself will not help; the code is inserted by the compiler into
itself. Recompiling with another compiler may help, as long as the compiler
is older than from 1992.

Yeah I really tend to agree. It *might* have been able to sustain weekly or
bi-monthly gatherings in the low hundreds but there's no way the cops will
tolerate thousands out there...I'm awaiting the reviews with no small
amount of dread.

I have to say I was dismayed to learn it was "there" too.

Why?  Well, that site has been good to us and we've been good to it, having 
small parties (i.e. Liquid Air, Your Sisters' House) there every so often.  
Now, if history is any indication, there is a danger that we will lose the 
use of that site for throwing effective small parties.

Look at the trend:

FMR held at Palo Alto Wetlands -- Brian says there is now a ranger stationed 
	down there to make sure ravers never return.

Many parties, including many FMRS, held at Berkeley Marina -- cop cars now 
	sit there on full moon nights to prevent parties from being thrown.

FMR (and others) at Bonny Doon -- Santa Cruz police and local neighbors have 
	had enough so it's not safe to try a party there anymore.

Albany landfill -- location busted after 2nd FMR attempt there.

People who try to throw BIG RENEGADES are in a way doing the community a 
disservice?  Why?  Because it is just TOO DIFFICULT to consistenly hide 
parties the size of the FMRs and the free Basics, therefore the locations 
get busted and then watched so people who want to do smaller renegades with 
different musical focuses have fewer and fewer available spots in which to 
have their parties.

Sure, the FMR is supposed to be this big community gathering vibe fiesta, but 
it seems almost selfish to me that people throwing parties that big can come 
in, use a spot, and then get busted and ruin the spot for the rest of us.

Well, part of the reason he's not playing is that he has other 
commitments, but it really didn't matter to us that Donald wasn't 
playing.  We felt that we needed to open things up a bit, as Donald has 
played at practically every event here in Seattle.  This leaves room for 
John Howard (IMHO deserves to be heard up here more often), and 
up-and-coming folks such as Rod or Ryan... Things are definitely changing 
up here in Seattle....
Peace,
Matt

Another factoid that bears looking at is the bit about the hacked compilers.
This actually happened a few years ago- a widely used compiler was self
modifying. and would insert code to propigate that way. It would be
possible
to do this for PGP, I suppose, but there are _way_ too many sources for all
compilers to do this to them all. Esp. with the GCC- it would be trivial to
find the hack in the source. My guess is the poster couldn't be bothered to
be more original.

The site wasn't revealed (to me anyway) until after 3am.  I was
asleep at the time, but stopped by on my way to work.  At 6:30am Garth
was finishing his set for maybe 200 -300 people - a bit larger than the
Launch Pad crowd.  The music was a bit louder too (not as clean as 
SoundVision though :) I was barely able to hear it from the street.  
It was a pretty well-behaved scene, but one that I would have to assume
would be noticed as the day progressed.  I left at the beginning of
Mark Farina's set, at around 7:30am.  I did not notice the presence of 
any alien lifeforms while I was there.

According to Geoff, the site location info was delayed to avoid a party
of thousands - so I don't think the FMR folks were being totally 
irresponsible.  Maybe they learned something from the Bonny Doon loss.

Sean, chill out, the FMR used it, but guess what, the crowd that came
_really_ respected the site, there were maybe 300 at most, the cars
were parked neatly and there was a really good, strong, vibe, the best
I've seen in a long time.  Someone stole one of he "residents" fishing
pole but a collection was taken and given to him so that he could buy
another one.  There were plenty of garbage bags and lots of smiles and
dancing people, I'm sure it can be used again as long as people are
descrete.  The location wasn't announced until 3 a.m. to keep the crowd
size down.  The "owner" came arount 8:30 with two police officers in
tow, the "owner" was more of a dick then the police who just sort of
stood there and watched, the "owner" ws pretty pissed and wanted to
know who the equipment belonged to, he said he wanted it impounded,
when he said that Garth and I grabbed all the records and got them out
of there!  There was a stand-off for several minutes while diffeent
people talked to the guy, calmed him down and eventually he let us all
go with the equipment, a close call but well worth it.  There were
several SF high school kids who experienced their first full moon.
They don't get to go when it is way out of the city and this was a real
treat for them.  It was real surreal when the dawn came and we all all
dancing to some verry _deep_ house played by Mark Farina.  All in all a
good party.

This is an urban folk ledgend. I went by there yesterday and ther is no ranger
stationed.

Not just the FMR but _countless_ other parties were thrown there as well.

3000 people and 2000 cars were just too much for the county.  No one wants 
the FMRs to be big, the news of the location spreads like wild fire, 
WICKED released the info at 3.am. by 3;30 every one who stuck it out
knew.  Starting this late and being secretive wa the only way to keep the 
numbers and the people who don't give a fuck away, the result was a very nicely
sized FMR without incident.

It was busted before the second attempt when another group tried to have
a party there, the FMR was the first party to be held there.

Why is the FMR BIG, not the fault of the promoters, it is a free party, it
has the largest flyer in the solar system, and very popular DJs, it has become 
a tradition.  You can't have it both ways, complaining about it starting late
and being hard to find is silly, the easier it is to find the larger and more
out of control the party is,  I think this lesson was learned at BD but
note that Martin was the one who pushed the luck, (although I don't believe
that the FMR should have been held there that month).  This FMR was the perfect
size for the site, people respected each other and took care of each other,
even the police that did come were cool.

I'm tired of people dissing stuff they know nothing about.  I'm not defending
WICKED, when they fuck-up, I tell them so. but this time, they did good.

Maybe you should come and check out the party and then judge it instead of
dissing a party that you know nothing about becaue you weren't there.

That's another part of the equation in which I feel the FMR people
were irresponsible. That site cannot be used during daylight at all,
because it is private property and people (duh) go to work in the
morning and will see the commotion there. How smart do you have to be
to figure that out? Either the FMR people are really stupid, think
they are exceptionally lucky, or were just planning to run until they
got busted. I suspect it's the latter, but I hope not because it shows
a profound disrespect for the rest of the promoters in the scene.

To my knowledge, this is the first party there that has gotten busted.
Not only that, but a heated confrontation with the landowner to boot.
Good show. What are the chances of holding something there now? What
about the homeless people that live there?

It could have been avoided.

Security issues are important to a lot of us, and it serves no one any good
   to run around screaming things without substantiation of any kind.  I
   consider your post irresponsible: this is confusing the situation, at a
   time when such a story might well be true (or some version thereof).

Those of you who know your CompSci may know of the S.C. Johnson (what is
   kernighan?) trick of embedding the trapdoor propagator into the
   compiler- and a modern version is entirely possible.  Before we actively
   discount such stories, we need to positively discredit such hypotheses.

You call this good,or OK, or whatever? Gimme a break. This is the first
time anyone has encountered said "owner." He probably never even knew
because he's probably never there on *weekends*. Doing it on a weeknight
when he is there in the morning may have gotten him hip in a hurry. We

I was supposedly going to be very industrious and write a paper that isn't due
until next week last night, but when Robert posted that he had room to 
drive anyone near the Santa Monica or Westwood out to the Full Moon, I took
that as my sign to go so I phond him up, hopped in with him and Andrew, and
took off for the 100 mile trek to the desert.

At 12:30 we arrived to a sound system that was basically set up but hadn't
yet gotten going.  The first DJ opened with a song that had a lush ambient
beginning that broke into a super funky beat. Super funky. That is when
I didn't regret the drive out.

Like Dana said, I don't think I have ever seen so much energy, and natural
energy at that. It really got me going, I danced super hard for about an
hour or so and then my knees started hurting but it was hard to stop.

The site was beautiful, but then again, I have never been to the desert
before and I was just in awe of it all.  The moon looked beautiful, 
especially around 3 or so when it started to get obscured by these dark
grey diaphenous clouds...there were vast expanses of flat land which 
prompted Robert to live out his latent drag racing fantasies and send us
careening out at 95 MPH which was great until we hit that bump and then he
decided to make a hairpin turn. *Sigh*

We tried to estimate how many were there but it was such a big area it was
hard to tell...perhaps 200 people?

we took off at 5:30, and I thought I would be back in time to hit my 9
o'clock class, but we didn't get in until 9:15(!) at which point bed 
seemed like a much nicer invitation.

I think this puts the San Francisco FMRs to shame...it's perhaps what the
SF FMRs once were...I don't usually speak of vibe but it was impossible not
to have fun with these people. It was great to know that these kind of parties
are happening down here, and it was their one year anniversary to boot.

(BTW, site is *very* special - would be great to do a joint list party 
perhaps...)

HEY! everybody; a little update on what's up for EARTHSPACE.

It's definitely going to be On the Earth, Under the Stars, aka an 
_outdoor_ event.  We have _one and a half million_ square feet of 
grassy meadows to play in, about 50,000 watts of sound and hundreds and 
hundreds of pounds of _fresh_ wax.  We'll probably get started before 
sunset on Saturday and end about noon on Sunday.

Bring sweaters, pants, extra socks, a waterproof layer, blankets, toys, 
whatever.   We'll have bonfires, a lot of water, fruit, some food, 
hopefully coffee out there.   wooHOOO!!!  _Kicking_ it into a beautiful 
summer!!

As I said, I didn't see you there so how do you know what happened.
And besides you are taking a lot of things out of context. Launch Pad doesn't
own that space any more than any other promoter.  as to wheather people will
be able to use that space, that remains to be seen.  I'm sure the oqnr will mot
station 24 hour guards and I'm sure others will use it.  Just because one group
gets busted doesn't mean that the space can't be used by another group with 
success, if you look back over the years you will see his to be true.

Agreed.

The method employed in this supposed expose is similar to that used by
the LaRouchies and Scientologists, which is relentless lying that is
so extensive it's hard to refute it all, accompanied by seemingly
corroborative details which might be true but are irrelevant or unsupportive
of the position taken.

If this all was true about prz and pgp, does anyone *really* think it 
would not have been mentioned in the Wall Street Journal *front page*
article focusing on Phil and pgp and the battle over encryption?

The giveaway here, of course, is the mention of the Trilaterals and
Bilderbergs, long the whipping posts of the loony left and the weirdo
right.  

May I suggest such shite be sent to /dev/null . . .

There goes that "you" word. If you can't attack the argument, attack
the person.  I don't appreciate Geoff putting this slant on the
argument at all.  Geoff told us himself what happened, and he told us
enough to determine that the site was not used responsibly.

Out of the context of what? Please explain that first sentence.

I wasn't even thinking of Launch Pad specifically. I was thinking
about some of the smaller events that were held there, and that may
not ever happen again there.

Sometimes it is true, and sometimes it isn't. No one "owns" renegade
spaces. No one is claiming so. But it should be each promoter's
responsibility to make sure it isn't ruined for other promoters that
wish to use the site. Promoters should also respect those that found
the site in the first place. If the FMR finds an unused site and wants
to ruin it, fine. If they want to use a site that 6 other promoters
have used and will probably still use, and they use it with the full
knowedge that they are high-profile and likely to be busted, and that
it will probably ruin it for the rest, that's downright selfish and
antisocial.

That site cannot support more than a couple hundred people. More than
that and the police start circling. I've seen it myself.

That site is private property. Anything done there during the week is
going to attract a lot of attention.

Doing any event there past dawn is insane.

I'm sorry, Geoff, but the FMR people blew it. They shouldn't have done
the event there. Now the owner is pissed and the police have a
heightened awareness of it. If such happened during a weekend event
with 200 people, I'd say it was bad luck. But this wasn't bad luck, it
was negligence.

The FMR is a good thing, but the logistics of it have become a
nightmare. It's too big for most sites, it runs way too late for most
sites, and it's used up most of the sites. Personally, I think they
ought to look at renting some private land somewhere where they can
hold it undisturbed. I think it's getting a bit out of hand, and
the promoters need to think about it's impact upon the community.

Sean, if you're charging Geoff with personalizing this discussion as a
member of the jury I have to vote, "Not Guilty."  I've been to quite
a few gatherings at that space and the history of it is more complicated
than some people (I will NOT say "you") may realize.  For one thing,
it's quite close to a police station as I recall, and I know that *they*
generally know what's going on.  Second, I am not entirely positive but
it appears to me that not all of the site is private land.  Third, while
the FMR folks may be faulted at times, they have quite a task to handle
in siting what has become a large and at times unruly event.  The one
thing I would definitely agree with is that it's not smart to run
something like this into working hours (which might be as early a 6 or 7
am for a site like that).  On the other hand, from all accounts the
situation with the owner was handled as well as one might expect under
the circumstances.  

I would guess, given what I know about the lengthy history of the use
of the site and those around it (somewhere between 50 and 100 parties
have been held there in the last few years), that the police will be
more vigilant for larger turnouts and potential problems, but are unlikely
to completely shut it down.  It's not a break-in site, there are few
dangers (== liability concerns) and no nearby residents.

Finally, while opinions may vary on all this, I hope we don't get at each
others' throats over it.  It just ain't worth it.

Ya, I raised a skeptikal brow at that one too.  As far as the activist

what more can i say, tamara pretty much covered it all...
was an unforgettable night, period.
it would be great to throw a joint sf-socal at this location this summer!

around 4:30 or so, joachim and i walked out into this flat, dark nothingness.
it was surreal, brilliant full moon above, mountains far off in the distance,
we had walked pretty far away from the crowd but the music was still there
and amazingly clear, it seemed to come from everywhere.  as joachim said last
night, some deep trancy ambient out there would have blown everybody's mind.

let's see what else...
1. don't forget to bring water next time
2. ear plugs == no annoying, energy-sapping ringing on the drive back
3. gotta learn to dance like dana :)
4. reserve a small plane next time to avoid the traffic!

ahem, as for...

   grey diaphenous clouds...there were vast expanses of flat land which 
   prompted Robert to live out his latent drag racing fantasies and send us
   careening out at 95 MPH which was great until we hit that bump and then he
   decided to make a hairpin turn. *Sigh*

*sigh* what can i say, that was stupid...

otherwise...  was great *finally* getting to go out and dance with fellow
socal-ravers!

Yes! Thank you!

I almost *cried* when I read that FMR is going to be held there. It's 
such a cool spot for a _small_ party, but extremely inappropriate for an 
event as big as FMR. I think we can kiss it goodbye after saturday...sigh....

I was so looking forward to doing YSH there once or twice before this 
space went away... :( :( :( :( :( is there nothing that can be done?

This of course assumes that the methane-breathing polycarbonate
slime ravers on Titan don't have parties in honor of the planet
they revolve around; Jupiter.  And then there are always the
Venusian Sun worshippers.  Y'know, just because most of us were born on
Earth doesn't mean we have to be such geocentric bigots.

By organizational affiliation, if you are asking am I affiliated in some way
to choices or Basics, the answer is no, I am not.  I am just a friend (or
family, if you like) of some of those folks, helping out a little by
spreading the message.  Why do you ask ?

Bryce,

>> Why do you ask ?
>> 
>i wanted to ask to see if you were an interested or disinterested party.
>it appears that you are an interested party.  

I have already told you that I am not affiliated with any organization.
This doesn't seem to be enough, now you change the question to whether I am
an interested party or not.  The answer is still No.  

I have no special interest in Basics or any other party or group. I am not
affiliated with any party or group. I go to any and all parties. I have
friends in all groups.  If a friend in Wicked asks me to keep an eye out for
a good site for FM's, I do it, this does not mean I am affiliated with
Wicked.  If a busy friend asks me to send out a message to our colleagues on
the net, I help out by doing it.  It doesn't make me affiliated to choices
or Basics.

>the information that you are providing has different value to me if
>it is factual or promotional in origin.

The information I provided was factual in nature.  Is the sfraves calendar
promotional in nature ? Last week the calendar contained a date for a party
which has since been changed.  I thought it would be nice to let people know
as early as possible about that change.  How silly of me.  

Early and complete information distribution is a good thing.  At least
people know what the age limit for Basics is, and where it's going to be
before they drive all the way into the city, y'know ?

If you or anyone else has problems with the dj lineup, contact the dj's.  I
repeat, I have no affialiation with them or any group.  I am trying to
inform people about a change in date, with information on the dj lineup as
of last night.  If there is a date clash, work out your dj problems with the
dj's from here on, not me.  

You obviously found my posting of use, because you now know there is a
possible dj lineup clash.  I reckon you all should be happy that at least
you found out that last night, not in 2 weeks time.  Of course you are
welcome to ignore the tainted information, since you judge it promotional in
nature. 

Jeez, talk about jumping on the messenger... Some positive forum this is !
Consider me unsubbed, I have more urgent things to worry about than arguing
about the purity of information I receive.  If you have any further comment,
mail me directly.  Be forewarned, I am not a spokesman for and am not
answerable to any organization.

Later,

Pk.

As everyone basically left, I had a chance to talk with the permit
officer.  He said a permit to have a party at 24th & Illinois would cost
about $1500.  But he said there was nothing dangerous going on and people
were having a good time.  He said he didn't give a shit really.  He just
wanted some person to come forward to come claim the equipment.  He was
very fair.

Well, this is all very well and good but groups like Your Sisters'
House and Liquid Air don't HAVE $1500 to pay for sound permits.  Bryce
and Ethan have been steadily losing money throwing parties, but they
do it because they LOVE what gets accomplished.  The time could come,
though, when the money outflow would become too great and the free
renegades would have to stop.

The whole point of doing a renegade party is to get in and out without
being noticed and have a good time and to not upset anyone and to leave
the space better than it was found.

If we have to start shelling out $1500 to hold a free party then the
number of free parties will drop.  The number of opportunities to
hear new DJs and new music will drop.  The number of opportinities for
under 21's in San Francisco to be active in the rave community will drop.

i think i have some explaining to do.  firstly i did not read ethans post
regarding friends and family.  Ethan did however ask me a long time ago
what my plans were in june, im sure you all know the response, the 11th. 
since then certin circumstances have changed so i moved to the 18th.  all i
can really say is that i forgot about ethans party.  when i plan a party i
try to avoid the bigger promoters, this is not saying in any way smaller
parties are of less importance.  when i asked markie if he would play, he
said yes.  i then spoke to ethan to see if he would do my flyer, he
reminded me of friends and family and the line up.  it now looks like
markie is only going to play at basics, if i offended anybody i am sorry. 
i hope you all have a good time at friends and family.
In regards to paul kennedy posting the info.  I asked him to do that for
me.                            
        One of the reasons i personally do not post to the list is that i
envision getting a lot of responses.  i do not want to offend anybody by
not responding.  sometimes i read the list sometimes i do not. I take on so
much in my life that somedays i have to remember to breathe. I hope i am
making myself clear, as this is a new form of communication for me.
this may be a paronoid dillusion?
respects
martin

Everyone ought to come out on Saturday to In The Light - it'll be 
a great chance for you all to meet and dance without losing any
sleep :).  The bandshell is between the DeYoung and the Academy
of Sciences in Golden Gate Park.  See you all there!

Tonight, Your Sisters' House seems to have lost their location, so
you may want to check out Jeno, Garth & Spun at DNA.  On Friday,
the benefit has a great lineup of underrated DJs, and SFR's Tamara
is playing at SPAZ.  After In The Light, you can check out the
Funky Tekno Tribe/Come-Unity, a combination of two of the
good big parties.  And finally, if you get Monday off, try out
Spundae, with the largest DJ lineup I've seen in a while.

Misc stuff: I checked out Soul Purpose last week and it had a decent
crowd; Marques Wyatt was OK, decent music but wasn't really mixed.
Slide 5 played - they were good, and Mark Farina finished up.  
Together is still going strong.  I got there at 12:30 and it was 
sort of slow, but around 1:30-2 it was full and Dante and Aaron O
were working the basement.  The upstairs musik was good too, dunno
who the DJ was.

Here's a blurb for a film in the SF Lesbian and Gay 
Film Festival that's somewhat rave-related.  The
festival program is out in numerous locations in SF; I 
think I got mine in the Bay Guardian or something.


Wrecked For Life: The Trip and Magic Of Trocadero Transfer

Saturday June 11, 8:15pm, $7, Roxie theater.

Gay discos were all the rage in the late 70's
and early 80's, but a special kind of magic
permeated San Francisco's legendary Trocadero
Transfer.  John Goss's Wrecked For Life interviews
several habitues and employees from the Troc's
glory days.  There's a nostalgic tinge, and a 
sense of the club's enduring spirit -- one 
fellow carries his membership card in his
wallet to this day.  The interviewees regale the
camera with tales of sex and drugs.  They also
describe the tremendous feeling of community
the Trocadero engendered.  "In those days
the community wasn't so divided," waxes 
"Disco Connie" Norman.  Goss has rounded up an
engaging ensemble for this evocative soft-shoe
through a memorable moment in SF gay history.

So Markie was going to play at F&F, but since Basics moved its date
to the same night he cancelled F&F?

1. Yes, Markie had confirmed for F&F. 

2. According to Martin Markie also confirmed for Basics. 

3. Markie is out of town and has been unavailable for comment. 

4. Martin indicated to me and Markie that he did not want Markie to
   double-book that night.

5. Following a barrage of rather heated email Martin changed his mind and
   indicated to me that he wouldn't mind if Markie played both parties.

6. During the heated email I found myself wondering why I/we even bother
   with the "big" djs given the propensity for situations like the above,
   and concluded that we were better off doing our own thing. We have no
   shortage of talent and more experience will only make us better. So I
   indicated to Martin that he could have Markie.

7. If when Markie gets back and reads all this he still has a burning desire
   to play F&F I will be happy to accomodate him. It is unfortunate that he
   has not been here to speak for himself during these discussions.

8. Tony will not be playing F&F. Spun will be playing F&F if Cool World
   doesn't mind (yeah right), I'll know tonite.

9. Those are the facts.

take it easy

Looking on the bright side of things, there is going to be
a HUGE selection of fun things to do on June 18.

You want a mega-party with lots of live acts, thousands of people,
and that old carnival-out-of-control feeling, there's Cool World.

You want a more traditional gathering of the bastions of the SF
scene, there's the Basics anniversary.

You want a small indoor party with an ambient chill room and the 
"usual suspects" from sfraves, there's Friends and Family.

There's even MORE, but I don't have the calendar in front of me
to look up all the possibilities.

Once again, San Francisco is an embarassement of riches :-)  I have
a feeling that Captian Crunch will be very busy that night. :-)

Dudes, relax.  Can we say ESCALATION.  The way flame wars start is the
same exact way real wars start.

Let's not be so defensive.  I see people not having respect for differences
of opinoin.  I see people reading things in to other peoples posts.  I
see people getting even more worked up about a post or thread then they
might even have a right to actualy be.  I see people feeling that they
have to respond harshly because someone flamed them or responded harshly
to them and they have to "defend their pride".  Keep in mind that when
someone flames you the rest of us are thinking that you were innocent and
that that person acted like a jerk.  You can respond to them privately,
flaming them back usualy only makes the rest of us temporarily loose
an ammount of respect for you.  It doesn't prove that your witty or that
you "don't take shit".  I also see people nit-picking things that 
completely went by everyone else.  And, lastly, I see people having
disagreements or flames with one or a few people and then unsubing
because "the list" (of aprox. 300 seperate individuals, mind you) is
unfriendly or doesn't have good vibe.  I honestly feel sad when someone
unsubs in a huff because it's loosing a part of our group who can
contribute positivity.  As important as emotions are, it seems more
and more to me that the more we all acted like Spok, the less problems
we'd have.  "I believe you to be in error, logic dictates that some
poor choices were made regarding the use of the Launch Pad site as
follows...."  "Shut the hell up, you mother-fuckin-emotionless-pointed-
eared-freak".

Okay, this is a wimpy thing to do, but do it I must:
YSH's anniversary is next thursday. Of *course* we want to do a party, 
but as we are not having much luck on the space end (we're all 
techie-scum, not promoters :))  I am reduced to begging on SFR.
Does anyone have any ideas? (please please oh pretty please) :)
We'll grovel and lick your feet.... :) :) :) :) :)

Hello ya'll!
This is my first post on the list so I like to start off by introducing
myself. My name is Mike a.k.a. E.B.E. I run a teeny weeny visuals company out
of SJ. I've been going to raves in SF, every now and then, for about 2 years
now. You may have seen me around, I sometimes wear a neon yellow contact
lens. I'll be at the park on Saturday. So please look for me and give me a
big hug. I'll probablly have a name tag on.
  Anyway, I don't know if the topic has been addressed, but around July 19
there will be an astrological event  of massive proportions. As a matter of
fact, it will be the biggest occurrence of its kind in the history of
humankind. I'm sure you've heard about it. Jupiter will be hit by a large
group of asteroids, causing an impact stronger than the force of all of
Earth's nuclear weapons combined. Not to mention it may very well turn the
sky red! This will undoubtedly cause a MAJOR FLUX OF ENERGY here on Earth! 
         My question is WHAT KIND OF FUCKIN' PARTIES ARE GOING TO GO OFF THAT
DAY?! 
  If anyone knows of any plans for one, please tell me about it. Thanks.
  See ya at the park!

    MIKE
             a.k.a.
                      E.B.E.

$1500 for a permit for 24 & Chillinois?  Compared to how much for Golden
Gate Park, for example . . . or to rent out 1015 Folsom for a night?
Come on, that's not a use fee, it's a deliberately obstructive market
hurdle.  I pay one-tenth of that a year for $1 million of insurance on
my office.  Even if you hire someone for a couple of hours to clean up
afterwards, or a rent-a-hat to watch the place, it isn't going to cost
even one-fifth of that.

Thanks for the response, Martin.  Sounded completely reasonable to me.
I know this is sticking my nose in someone else's business, but isn't
there a way for Markie to play both parties?  Unless they're far apart
geographically it seems like that's a good way to go . . .

$400 to use the band shell site, plus $35 for a sound permit.

*IF* this $1500 fee for 24th and Illinois REALLY is the correct figure, I 
agree it's ludicrous.  However, if it is someone's private land (this has 
never been made clear to me) then the owner can charge whatever he or she 
wants.

But anyway, if this $1500 is some number the SFPD came up with, then think 
on it:  maybe they purposely have set the price so high so as to discourage 
raving.  In 3 years they've seen a lot of parties come and go, and it's a 
known fact that someone on the SFPD has it out for ravers (I say someone 
because I can't recall the guys' name).  I mean, if all the ravers goodwill 
and smiles were counting for something, then why did a place like 1015 Folsom 
recently need a Federal restraining order to keep the SFPD off their back?  
I can easily imagine that any incident in town where cop-meets-raver is not 
going unreported, even if it's only going unofficially back to that one guy 
who makes a point of trying to close down parties.

Dear SFravers:
		Just a note:  the Zoorave at Roble on Saturday at Stanford University is supposed to be for Stanford students only.  However, I presume that people will be pretty lenient about checking ids at the door.  There will also be some alcohol, and IDs will be checked if you intend to drink.  However, there is no minimum age requirement.  Harry is really great, and Bernard is good.  Besides, it's also FREE!  Check it out!

Dear Ken,
  
   I was afraid someone was going to call me on that little statement!  I 
probably shouldn't have included it, because I'm not absolutely sure 
myself that it's true, and I knew that it might arouse controversy and 
seem unduly negative.  Since I suspect others may want to hear my 
explanation as well, I'm posting my reply to the list.
   I will say that comparing the parties I go to now with the ones I went 
to around the beginning of 1992 when I started raving and during the 
summer of that year, the ones then seem better.  But it's an intuitive 
feeling on my part, and not one I can necessarily substantiate by 
pointing to irrefutable specifics.  Different people feel differently 
about what makes a good party, after all.
   It may be that simply that it was a new thing for me than, and the initial 
thrill wore off.  But I don't really believe that.  I've heard this on many 
occasions from others (that the scene has gone downhill), although, 
encouragingly, not so much recently as I heard it last year -- so it's not 
*just* me.  I'll list a few personal observations, which may or may not be 
accurate reflections of what's going on, since I haven't been going out more 
than a couple times a month for the most part:

(1) There are less people on Exstasy.
(2) The whistles seem to have disappeared. 
(3) I don't see as many goofy Dr. Seuss-style hats or weird, wacky 
outfits as I used to. 
(4) I don't see things like virtual reality and the moonbounce at as many 
parties as I used to. 
(5) I don't meet as many really excited people as I once did. 

All these things and others were/are important parts of the rave 
experience for me.  I don't remember dates well enough to try to estimate 
when I think the downward trend began, and I suspect it was more of a 
gradual thing than something that began at a given point anyway.

But as I hinted when I spoke of our positive energy being diluted, I think 
one cause may have been the rapid influx of new people to the scene.  I'm 
not one of those people who think raves should be kept underground for 
the privileged few, but I do think they grew too fast for their own 
good.  Instead of picking up the positive vibe that was there and 
learning to shed their inhibitions and open up to friendliness and love 
as a way of being at parties, the newcomers arrived in such numbers that 
the vibe was not effectively communicated to each new raver.  Of course 
this has a net effect, as it is harder to smile and be open and friendly, 
or have the courage to wear something really bizarre, if others aren't 
doing it too.

But whether or not these observations match your own, don't think I'm giving 
up on raves or let my opinion get you down!  This scene has changed my life, 
and I'm not going to give it up that easy.  I think/hope the best may still be 
yet to come, and this summer seems to be shaping up quite nicely.

So wear a smile this summer if nothing else!  :)

Rave On,
                               *** Starchild ***

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

	Sisters and Brothers,

	It's 6 am and I just read Courtney Reimer's article in XLR8R
	titled "Think:There are no rules on the dance floor" in it he
	talks about how people in the Scene are spending more time,
	energy, emotion, etc.  "Dissing" each other as oppose to
	sending love and positive energy.  I realized that he was right
	on and that we all, including myself, need to really check
	ourselves.  Can some of you remember your first party?  It's
	hard for many of us isn't it?  Most of you can remember the
	party or parties that really turned you on to the Scene, I bet
	it had a lot to do with the UNCONDITIONAL LOVE and the Vibe that
	you received from everyone around you, regardless of how "new"
	you appeared.  Do you remember how you felt, and any
	epiphanies that you had on the dance-floor?  Remember dancing
	all night long in the moonlight till dawn and seeing a blazing
	Sun illuminate each and every one of you equally in the
	morning?  It's been a long time since Connection I.  Have we
	been reduced to a pack of snotty, bickering fools arguing over
	the rights to a "space" that in reality belongs to each and
	every one of us and none of us simultaneously?  It's so funny
	to me that we can bicker about the correct use/misuse of a site
	and simultaneously totally abuse the one "space" that each of
	us have, which is our body, which is a temple in itself.  We
	now as a community must come to grips with the naked questions
	of what do we do when someone in the group does something that
	you don't like.  You can diss them and complain to others, you
	can complain DIRECTLY to the perpetrators, (that might even get
	a result) or you can live the example that you preach.  I for
	one must apologize to Laura and Sean for matching their
	negativity with my own, I realize now that that is not the way
	to "defend" any "wonderful feeling" that I might have had at
	the last Full Moon, sorta like killing for Peace.  So Laura and
	Sean and Ethan I apologize for my harsh words, I realize that I
	need to do more dancing and less analyzing.  Maybe I'm spending
	way too much time in cyberspace, so to that end I'm going to
	unsub for a while and spend more time on the dance-floor.  I'll
	still be around and it won't be hard to find me, and many of
	you know how to reach me by phone or other ways.  Remember to
	love and take care of each-other, it's sooo important, it's
	what this planet needs more than anything right now, also try
	to extend it out past your boundaries, it's easy to love
	friends & family, it's harder to love the stranger or the Cop
	or "that other posse" but if we don't learn this quick, we, the
	Scene, the human race, won't be around too much longer.  Just
	as the light of the Sun and Moon falls on each and every one of
	us on the  planet, providing life and energy, so can Love
	emanate from the Core of each and every one of us and provide
	support and nurturing for everyone.

	if we lose Love, It's all lost.


	Peace,

	    G

Thanks for your post, geoff.  a very thoughtful one.  i would add that
in addition to the "don't dis" philosophy, that we need to move to a 
space where we a) respect each other, and b) consider the consequences
of what we undertake.  I see lots of respect in the scene, but, frankly,
i see all too little of the "consider the consequences".  it's all very
well to love each other, but if in loving each other, and doing it on
the dance floor, we thrash someone else or thrash our sites or thrash
the neighbors, the consequences are sorely felt by at least one individual
or one site or by the entire community.  if i, as a sound person, thrash
the dancer's ears, that hurts many people.  if i, as a raver, pollute
the air in a closed space with unwanted smoke, that hurts many people.
some consciousness about the consequences of each and every one of the
actions we undertake must be in our awareness.  otherwise, people's bodies,
minds, emotions, or spirits are injured.

"Every now and then, when I think that the Scene is really bad, when I 
think that it is dead, it's over, fucked.  A party will come along that 
helps me remember why we are all here and connected.  This was the party 
that did that for me this summer..."

"The vibe was strong and I really got a good groove fix."
 
"...and *so* many sfravers in attendance!  i think many of us got our views 
of the scene pleasantly refreshed.  thank you so much."
 
"Sunday in the park was major FUN stuff.  BIG Thanks to everyone
who made it go off ...   I just love losing my head w/SFravers.  :)"
 
"Well gang, the park party was fantastic.  Great to see everyone.  I think 
we need to throw another one just to thank the crew that put up this first 
one! "
 
"Then we went to the GG Park rave. It was killer!  It was just a 
fantastic time from beginning to (Alas!) end."
 
"Ditto on the kudos, boyo! That was a great party!"
 
"The other reviews were right on. It was a good vibe all day with people
dancing and hanging out and just being family.  It's truly a privilege to 
have all of you around as you spread such a good vibe and so many good
feelings. That's what it's all about :)."
 
"I hope everyone who went to the GG Park rave had as much fun as I did. 
Good dj-ing, communal sharing of stuff to eat and drink, dancing  Praises 
and applause for all the people who made it happen.  Let's do it again."

I'm always amazed at life's ability to turn negatives into positives. 

It was, in general a fairly rocky week for me. As I'm sure many of you
noticed, the big boulders were rollin and I for one was feelin a bit
bruised.

However I'm sitting here Friday morning feelin pretty good. Communication
is never easy. Martin and I have been friends for while, but I feel as a
result of our recent interactions we both know each other a bit better now.
While in the short term that can often be tough, utlimately it can only be
a good thing. I for one have a much clearer vision (ha, ha) now of exactly
why it is that I do what I do. I'm also overjoyed to see him actually post
something to the list. It's always been a mystery to me that he could sit
by and read so much about his parties without jumping in and saying
something. I hope we see more of him. I'll say the same of Markie too, I
hope we see more of him.  

One thing that should be apparent from recent events is that we've got a
really lively scene here and as summer blooms full strength an unfortuante
(or fortunate) consequence wil be that we're going to see dramatically
increased demand placed on sites, and *potentially* increased competition
amongst would be party throwers for attendees/participants. Obviously the
best response to this is not to lay claim to and do battle for limited
space and other resources but rather to join together, pool our resources,
our flavors, our cultures. 

So it was with no small amount of joy that I yesterday encountered the
suggestion that it might be high time for YSH, Lauch Pad, Spiral Jive, SPAZ
etc. to start gettin together on parties. Really nice to have Maui from YSH
join us on the list and I also had the pleasure of meeting Dave from Spiral
Jive last night. So I'm really optimistic about some great things coming
together.

Yet another surprise greeted me last night too. I had kind of cynically
assumed that there was no way that Cool World would be interested in Spun
playing F&F the same night as their Cow Palace Ho down, but, they proved me
wrong. Sasson doesn't seem to feel threatened by what we're doing and Spun
is psyched to play with us. So Right Fucking On I say.

take it easy

MY negativity Geoff?

I do not accept your apology becuase it was couched in those terms.

I am not a negative person.  Realistic and pragmatic yes, but negative no.  
I fully believe that my cautions, warnings and complaints are valid and 
should be taken into consideration for the good of the renegade scene, and 
should not be wiped away.

All the happy love vibes and good feelings in the world will NOT change 
the fact that the rave scene must operate in a way that will 

	(1) be fair to the participants -- both party goers
		and party organizers

	(2) be fair to the environment

	(3) not cause undue confrontation with elements
		of non-rave society.

If you really loved someone you would not be so patronizing.

My hypothesis is that they cancelled because the location they found

Since I have been publically told today on this list that I am both
full of negativity and patronizing, I am wondering if I would truly
be a good representative for sfraves to spin at "In the Light" 
tomorrow.  

If enough people are against my participation, then I will gladly turn 
over my time to someone who more fully exhibits the right kind of spirit.  
It would be unfair to the community to have me continue if I am inappropriate.

laura you have it backwards. anyone who feels you are too patronizing, especially
people who dont' even attend SFRaves events, simply should stay home and listen
to their black flag albums instead of gracing us with their presence.


having strong beliefs does not mean one is patronizing.

Starchild wrote about old rave experiences ...
These are my comments.

I think the whole "downhill" idea is mostly about 
people having a hard time recapturing very strong
first experiences.

The following observations caught my eye.

>(1) There are less people on Exstasy.
Write to your congress-person!

>(2) The whistles seem to have disappeared. 
Although intergalactic whistle communication is
entertaining it gives alot of people headaches.

>(3) I don't see as many goofy Dr. Seuss-style hats or weird, wacky 
>outfits as I used to. 

Well, I think the "Dr Suess" hats sorta killed off the wacky outfits.
The idea (to me at least) is to create and contribute to the common
experience.  Fabulous costumes are the greatest.  Outfits are a
personal contribution to the visuals of a party.

Of course, everyone has to be comfortable themselves and there
is no down side to not wearing a costume.  No one is going
to disapprove if you don't bring fruit.

>(4) I don't see things like virtual reality and the moonbounce at as many 
>parties as I used to. 

It's not what there used to be.  
It's what we're not thinking up now.
Make it new, fresh, and clean.

>(5) I don't meet as many really excited people as I once did. 
See item number one ;)

Better than you may realize :-)

Laura,
I think it's important to realize that we're all capable of getting on each
other's nerves from time to time.  In fact, I would say that the bringing
together of diverse perspectives *requires* that this happens.  Ultimately,
none of us can be completely right because whatever words we post or speak
will always be interpreted in a variety of ways.  I'm not so sure about how 
useful this concept of "unconditional love" is.  What *is* useful is 
realizing that we can dislike one another (which is OK), and then find a 
space (i.e. rave) where we can love and accept each other *anyway*.  I think 
we can all agree that the petty bullshit that happens over the Internet is 
nothing compared to the intense feelings we get from dancing together to 
music that moves us.

And anyway, if we all got along so well and loved each other all the time, 
not only would life be boring, but raving wouldn't be as special as it is. 

> If enough people are against my participation, then I will gladly turn 
> over my time to someone who more fully exhibits the right kind of spirit. 

Your spirit will come through loud and clear via the killer set you
are going to spin for us tomorrow.  I can assure you that no one will be 
thinking about some stupid flames on sfraves when we're all freaking out to 
the music.  P.S. Despite weather reports to the contrary, it has been sunny
and warm all afternoon in the city.  See you all tomorrow!  d:-)

hi! i am an astronomy grad student and i regret
to inform y'all that there will be no parties
going on while the comet chunks are hitting
jupiter, because i will be stuck in west virginia
at that time looking at the planet with a radio
telescope.

sadly, the impact will be very unspectacular. the
comet will hit the side of jupiter that we can't
see from earth. the earth's sky will not change
color at all, but frogs and cooked pigeons are
expected to fall from the sky in some areas. (^_^)

Laura--
 
*That* (your not being one of the sfr spinners
for in the light) was *certainly* not the meaning of
wahat I now realize was an ambiguous, laconic message f
from me! I merely wanted you and all of us to examine
that one statement that I selected from your public reply
to Geoff in the light of the little quote below.
 
I have been on sfr since near the beginning and ususally sit
back and watch the flow and flames of this marvelous gift of
the communications explosion we have in sfr/e-mail ingeneral.
Since it tends to be such a "hot" medium, sometimes our actions
and reactions are as quick as they would be in face-to-face
communication, but without the other physical instrumentalities
that are there in conversation.  Result: flame wars, hurt feelings,
instant misunderstandings as well as the opposite at times:
the incredible lightness of virtually being at-one with each other!
 
Ihaven't heard your djing since the side that I haveon that
delightful Liquid Air double cassette I bought awhile back.  Your
spinning at In the Light--and Geoff's dancing/trancing there will
be part of all of our healing and health!

World's second oldest and wisest raver,
Will

My first 'rave' experience was in Cleveland (!) at, I think, the first
big event held there, put on by a local Church of the SubGenius and
maybe some other folks.  It was in this really nasty old warehouse in
the Flats, and only a few people could get in at a time because you
had to go up to the fourth floor in this really creaky old freight
elevator that would only hold about eight people.  It spread out over
two floors -- the top had been semi-renovated and had a nice looking
bar and some decor, the floor below was still all concrete and brick.
All the right things were there -- fluorescent chalk and blacklights
for drawing all over, neat crash spaces with couches and brain
machines, tables of people selling SubG, RAW, and other marginal lit,
video monitors showing psychedelia -- but the vibe was a bit strange.
As my friend sagely observed, "Everyone was just standing around
waiting for the world to end."  I didn't get The Vibe (tm) until I moved
out here and found SFR.

I was putting little cheese stickers everywhere I went, myself and
others included -- "Mellow Cheddar" and "Creamy Jack" -- and had a
blast of a time meeting people, but there wasn't quite the critical
mass of smiles that lead to 'random acts of kindness and senseless
beauty'.  I hope/bet the Cleveland scene is going off now.

So...I'm not longing for 'the good ol' days'.  For me they've been
getting better.  I still get that apocalyptic feeling whenever I go
into a normal rock/industrial club -- the feeling that everyone would
rather be watching civilization collapse in flames and riots but no
one has the guts to push it over.

// g

PS: If we make it a contest to show who's more full of Peace, Love, and
The Vibe (tm), we've missed the point.

Greetings, ravers!

My apologies to all, and to individuals for jumping down anyone's throats
in the past week.  I've realized i've just been to quick with my responses,
and too eager to prove my point.  

That said, i shall happily go lurk for a while till i recover my sense of
humor.

However, i *will* be at In The Light.  If you'd like to hear me spin (shameless
self-promotion here ;) ), please come to the bandshell in the park and help
us set up at around 10:30.  The sooner we get things unloaded and running,
the more i get to play :).  And, in any case, I hope you can all come to
SFRave's premier event--i know i'll have lots of smiles and hugs for you
all.  We do bicker, but life in extended families is never an easy thing.

Since I have been publically told today on this list that I am both
full of negativity and patronizing, I am wondering if I would truly
be a good representative for sfraves to spin at "In the Light" 
tomorrow.  

DEAR LAURA,

I'm not gonna be able to be there tomorrow,( waaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!) but I for
one, ( and I suspect  most sfravers) would be greatly saddened if you did not
spin.  In my little trancey heart, I kind of consider you as the fairy
godmother of the sfraves net. 

Always a voice of reason crying out in the darkness, always a calm amid the
flames and storms. We have all seen you intercede with clarity and compassion
innumerable times.

So,  A definition is also in order here: the dictionary  defines "patronize
as: to act as a patron of: provide aid or support for." 

 You see, even when we disagree strongly,
if our intention is provide aid or support ( the  sfrave community) it should
be interpreted as a positive gesture. 

Hardly some self-serving act of selfishness or negativity. If you're not one
of the best representatives of this net, then maybe we should all gonna sub
out too!!  Sooooooooooooo,

Spin Baby, Spin,... Cauldron burn and Cauldron bubble,
Turn that music loose............turn that music loose.

MANY of you have met my friends Phil and Will who have been visiting 
from NYC for the past two weeks.  They were at The Blue Cube and the 
Launch Pad parties.

Well, being ones to recognize a good time when they see it, they 
changed their flight plans to stay out here in SF a little longer.  
They were supposed to go back this morning, but instead will leave 
Saturday night.

They did this so they could go to SPAZ tonight (where Tamara will 
be spinning -- go see her because you might not get another chance 
as she's spending the summer in LA) and so they could hang with 
everyone at In the Light tomorrow.

They're the greatest.

(Well, I'm biased because Phil gave me a cat, but still . . . .)

C'mon Laura, we're not gonna buy this "I might not be a good representative"
stuff.  You're on the schedule, so be positive and be *prepared*!

PS  You really should consider accepting Geoff's apology.  

PPS  I don't want to sound like a Patronizing Voice or anything either,

Is it possible for a retail entity to love?

Probably not. But Robert,gary,matt,michelle, topher, tracy, mark and 
myself love you all and are proud to be associated with ya'll on this 
here internet thingamajiggy.  Some of us seem to be using this incredible 
technology to vent on eachother.  WE are all brothers and sisters.  Lets 
work together instead of against eachother--that's what it's all about. 
Love, unity, a beautiful vibe.

At ameba yesterday there was a very strong sketch element that made us 
here all pretty  uncomfortable.  We're going to have to start enforcing 
RULES (*$##@!!**) like no pages on the phones and stuff like that.
Our Manson Print is a reminder to us that we have some bad eggs amongst
us. They are hard to deal with. We Arent. Appreciate each of us who can
communicate.  Lets do this in a positive way and HELP EACHOTHER.

Okay guys, 
	This is for those of you not going to Come-Unity, tonight, since I'm sure that party's going to be kickin'.  Unfortunately, some of you may be like me, and don't have cars.  So listen up, if you're near the Stanford area.

From SF:
	101 South
	University Ave. exit in Palo Alto
	Go towards Palo Alto, NOT East Palo Alto
	Follow U. Ave, until it becomes Palm Drive
	Rt. on East Campus Dr.
	Follow it around until you hit Santa Teresa St.
	turn Rt.
	Roble Hall will be on your right.
	It's the building covered with Ivy

From SJ:
	101 North
	University Ave. exit in Palo Alto
	Same as above

And btw, no more gripes from people at Stanford about this thing
Be discrete.
Remember, this is at a university, and the campus police here are real s.o.b.'s
Take care, and hope to see you there
It should last all night, and I assume less checking of Stanford IDs will be done as the night progresses

I'm glad that people had fun today.  A big hand goes out to Lee for
doing what needed to be done administrivially and financially to
get this party off the ground.  A big hand goes out to Bryce for
getting the sound system "just so."  (Bryce, pick a night this week 
and I'll come over and help you clean all the dust and grit out of 
your gear.)

Hands also go out to SFRavers I saw helping haul gear, set up,
move chairs, pick up trash, break down, and otherwise deal with
the before-and-after of a party.  Every little bit of effort and
labor made the task of cleaning up afterward bearable.

Will and Phil say they're glad they stayed the extra day and a half
(they're on a plane now, heading back to NYC :-( ).

Big hugs go to the bunch that drove up from LA:  Bryan, Tamara,
Chris, Greg, and Jennifer. 

See you all around . . . hopefully at least some of you at Friends
and Family on the 18th.  I'll even buy some new records :-) (but
not any softer or slower -- sorry whoever it was that asked of me
"is she ever going to play any house?", but the answer is "possibly
someday but probably not.") :-) :-) ;-) (I mean really, would you 
ask Markie "are you ever going to play any techno?"  No, I didn't 
think so.) :-) :-) ;-)

Speaking of that infamous site, if you have any energy left you might 
want to wander by there tonight.

( They asked me to spin if I "didn't bring any of the hard stuff."
What, pray tell, constitutes "hard" in this City?  :-)  I haven't 
played any hard records out here since last September.  Regardless,
I'm too beat to do much else but read comic books tonight.  )

In The Light:

 Let me lead off with a big THANK YOU ! to Lee Fogel for getting the
site reservations and everything else . Thanks too to Bryce for the
sound system , and anyone else for the technical setup. And , of course
, thanks to the DJs - Bryce again , Laura , and Markie.

General Impressions:

 Music started around 11:25. Most of the "crowd" were SFRavers , only
20 persons at this time. Crowd didn't start picking up until 3:15PM.
By 4:30PM we had a good sized crowd of about 150 - 200 dancers, kicking
up a lotta dust ( someone in the crowd was wearing a dust mask , and
was nice enough to give me one of his spare ones - I'll have to remember
to bring one for the next time! ). Markie was on from about 3:45PM ,
and spun until the park rangers shut it down at 6:18PM. Almost seven hours
of great dance music!

 I wish it had been more overcast - thanks a lot to the person who brought
the public bottle of sunblocker! 

 Given the political bent of the leaflets on the table , I wonder if folks
will think SFR is a group of partying Libertarians? ( I should've gotten
some Republican Party leaflets to put on the table - that would screw
people's heads up! ).

 As usual for a Golden Gate Park bandshell event , we got a lot of passer
by onlookers , and even some joiners, which is always encouraging to me.
Parking was a hassle, due to the amount of folks attending the park on this
holiday weekend , and a nearby museum exhibit was on display for its
last weekend ( Dead Sea scrolls ).

 No uniformed police presence until the end , when the rangers came over
to call time on us. Once they saw us dismantling the setup they left. 

 I saw so many SFRavers together that I haven't seen in a month or more -
almost like a class reunion! It was great and good to see you all again,
and hope to see you folks again for many more!
 
Leatherman:

 Arriving at about 12:15 was a guy dressed in a motely costume of leather
patches and metal plates - kind of a medieval/road warrior look. He was
pushing a shopping cart loaded with metal parts , shards of mirrors , and
other stuff. He had a big hat made of leather patches. His face was coated
with an olive green substance. During the day , he painted his face with
increasingly elaborate designs.

 He endeared himself to us (not) immediatley by shouting out that the
cops were going to be here in ten minutes to shut us down , "seriously!".
( No cops showed up ). He spent the rest of the afternoon declaiming his
views on us and life and the universe to anyone who would or wouldn't
listen to him. Kinda scary and annoying at first , then just mostly
annoying. He also did some "performance" stuff , and made a little altar on
the ground . Some of his rap seemed amusing enough to some folks - and he
finally found someone at the end of the afternoon to actually have a
conversation with. So , I guess the day ended well for him too. 

Which One Was Larry?:

 I was the guy in the grey pants and the yellow sun/blue moon tshirt. Also
had a goatee beard that's going to get shaved off by the end of this week
( upkeep is a hassle , and it tickles my wife's nose ...). You may have
noticed me neurotically trying to keep the left-hand hot air balloon under
control for most of the afternoon.

Security Mode:

 I notice that when I'm at an SFR related event , I can get into a kind of 
a watchful "security" mode. I try to watch out for things that don't look
right - for example , one of Mike's friends was trying to find the candy 
next to the stage-left speakers , and was looking in the milk crates that 
had the spare electrical stuff in it. I'm afraid that I started to politely
hassle him about what he was looking for. ( he did find the candy ).

 I also try to keep a lookout for fights or folks who look like they had
one hit over the line - although what I would do if a fight actually
broke out is uncertain to myself. I guess I feel this way because it's an
SFR event , and therefore in a way "my" event , and I should do what I can
to make sure that nothing screws up. ( sure does disrupt the "carefree"
part of my dancing , tho' ...).

Summary:

 It was GREAT ,I liked it , and if you weren't there , you shoulda been!

URGH!@#@ After 1 1/2 hours of standing in the cold in a snaking line, we 
were told (by word of mouth) that many people had counterfeited tickets, the 
warehouse had filled up and the whole lot of us (who had legit $10 
tickets) would NOT be able to come in. A police car was sent to disperse us - One idiot 
started throwing bottles at the police car, the officer threatened to 
bring backups with clubs.

Most upsetting was the event went on without us (at a cool looking 
warehouse at Pier 70, near 3rd and 20th). While I sure everyone who didn't get in would like 
their money back, I think most of us would pay MORE money to see a 
make-up show (perhaps unlikely if machines get destroyed). I heard the 
last SRL show in San Francisco was 3 years ago.

I'm sure much wrath will be directed towards WIRED (a sponsor), because 
they are an easy target. The event is promoted in the current issue. In 
the future perhaps WIRED could help them design better tickets. The 
tickets we bought at Naked Eye were incrediblely inept. What looks like 
dot-matrix black output xeroxed on white card stock, UNNUMBERED, with an 
easily duplicated generic notary embossing.

Very disappointed I couldn't see what sounded like (from outside) 
an amazing show (lots of noisemaking sirens and explosions).

In the Light in Sight

        Gregg & I got to the park when Markie was spinning...we just
barely missed Laura's set, which bummed us out, because, believe it or
not...I HAVE NEVER HEARD HER SPIN!!... next time I'm gonna plan things
better!  

        As Alpha10 has already commented:  Markie was a dog.  He was
ruff.  (sorry...)

        Once he got going, there were probably over a hundred people
down in front and up behind him and on the bandshell, too, doing the
house boogey strut and wiggle.  Wow!  Was it my imagination?  Every time
he broke a new beat the crowd would stomp up a little extra dust.  

        My friend H. who arrived too late to hear the music told me:
Everyone looks so beautiful!  I mean, EVERYONE was RADIANT!  There were
lots of the people there that go to some of the same parties as me, but
you know, it's always so dark and it's hard to see people.  Was it the
weather that put people in such a fabulous mood? The day was perfect.
The sun (a much bigger flyer than that other thing, y'know) was shining
brightly but the air was light and cool; just the kind of day beloved SF alone
can produce.  In the Light was the perfect name...the name shaped the event,
it shaped the vibe, it cast some kind of magic spell on everyone there.
  
        *sigh*  I'm gonna remember those couple of hours a long time! 
It was good to meet you all (again) and say hi.  Maybe I'll see you at
Spundae tonite!

despite the fact that the promoter, Joe Matheny, is a flake,

i must say the SRL show was absolutely unbelievable. probably one of the
most amazing things I have eveyr seen.

i have worked at SRL on the BuzzBomb engine (the loud rocket engine that explodes sonic booms)

and have done other work for them but never have been to an organized show.

this was their largest show and truly was a masterpiece. 

the space was perfect and i got to see everything up close except the tesla
coil.

Here's my set list from "In the Light."  Some of you may notice that 
I played a lot of pretty old records.  I have some long-standing 
favorites that I thought deserved to see the light of day in San 
FranDisco.  I endeavor not to bore you all, and so have since
retired several of these -- new sounds for Friends and Family!

"Gravitational Arch of 10" - Vapourspace [Plus 8, Canada]
"Surveyor-4" - Equinox [Vortex, USA]
"Nuclear Sun" - Nightvision (Damon Wild) [EXperimental, USA]
"Off-Axis Gravitational Fields" - Underground Resistance [UR, USA]
"Fantasies of the Mind" - Alici [See Saw, Belgium]
"Opus(Velvet)" - Beyond [ESP, Belgium]
"Tone Exploitation" - The Nighttripper [ESP, Belgium]
"Acid Moon" - Juno Reactor [NovaMute, UK]
"Trancition" - Choci and The Freedom of Sound [Aura, UK]
"Into the Nature" - Hardfloor [Harthouse, UK]
"Guijada" - Subliminal [Trans'pact, France]
"Harlequin" - Avalon [IND, USA]
"Confuss" - Hardfloor [Harthouse, Germany]
"Afghan Acid" - The Rising Sons [EXperimental, USA]
"Alice" - Sub-Stance [Now! Records, Germany]
"Second Earth" - Quark [Mucho Vinyl, UK]
"The Cutting Edge" - Dome Patrol [XL, UK]

I've seen some of this on CD, so if you liked it please support the 
musicians and bring it home.  Vapourspace has CDs out, as does Hardfloor 
(_TB Recsucitation_ on Moonshine/Harthouse).  I've seen "Tone Exploitation" 
on _The Best of Techno Volume Three_, and there is an ESP Records compilation 
out on Instinct I believe.  "Acid Moon" is on a full-length Juno Reactor 
CD called _Transmissions_.  "The Cutting Edge" is on volume two of a 
compilation from EXperimental Records.  I've seen these CDs at many
Bay Area stores, including Rasputnin's and Amoeba in Berkeley, and
Tower and Streetlight in San Francisco.

I know I sound like a commercial, but the fact is that the DJs often get 
a lot more credit than the artists do, and that's not right in my book.

   I was quite bummed that I couldnt make it to In-The-Light this 
weekend.  The main reason was simple exhaustion (I went to Disneyland for 
Grad Night on Thursday.) 

   But by 6pm I was fully rejuvinated and ready for a good party.  I 
called the Funky Tekno/Come-Unity hotline and listened to Kevin preach 
about how great the party will be.  So I started calling friends and 
within two hours we were on our way up to Santa Cruz (from Monterey) to 
pick up some more friends.

   We arrived around 11pm and even though I brought about a dozen canned 
goods, we still had to pay $20. This was rather dissapointing since it 
was $10 before 10pm and I didn't think they would jack the price up that 
much.  But at least the security guys were REAL cool.  They didn't hassle 
us about anything, were polite and even chatted a bit.  I was truly 
amazed since most of the $15+ BIG parties I've been too have had total 
jerks for security.

   The inside was very nice and spacious and the sound was perfect.  The 
usual black light posters were in effect and they had a big tribal mask 
above the DJ which had lights coming out of its eyes.  The vibe was real 
good for a big event, people were friendly and I saw a lot of smiles.

   The chill space was nice, although I would of liked an ambient room 
but I guess the site didnt have room.  By the time we left the room was 
filled with a thick fog only matched by the fog we ran into on the way 
home.

   Unfortunatley, we couldn't survive the whole thing because we were all 
still burnt out from Disneyland. So we took off around 3:30 (which bummed 
me out cause I wanted to see Garth spin.. sigh..) the drive home was no 
problem, even though the CHP was out in FORCE! Crashed around 5:30 and 
allready began thinking about next weekend :)

NOTE: To all those people who sent me requests for one of my tapes, sorry 
I've been so slow, I've had finals and lots of other annoying work to do 
but I should have them all sent out by June 10th (thats when I leave for 
England). And when I get back from England, if you liked my first tape, 
I'll send you an all import tape :)... and speaking of..

 Does anyone know of ANY record pools in England??? Or Belgium??

  Peace out!

On May 25,  1:04pm, you proclaimed:

} 
} This is an urban folk legend. I went by there yesterday and ther is no ranger
} stationed.

Not urban legend... according to other people who have tried to have
parties down there, cops do patrol the area regularly at night.  Also,
there is a "ranger's residence" that was being renovated when the FMR
took place down there, which may be completed and inhabited now.

} > Many parties, including many FMRS, held at Berkeley Marina -- cop cars now 
} > 	sit there on full moon nights to prevent parties from being thrown.
} 
} Not just the FMR but _countless_ other parties were thrown there as well.

True, but none drew as large a crowd as the FMRs, nor as regularly.

} > FMR (and others) at Bonny Doon - Santa Cruz police and local neighbors have
} > 	had enough so it's not safe to try a party there anymore.
} 
} 3000 people and 2000 cars were just too much for the county.  No one wants 
} the FMRs to be big, the news of the location spreads like wild fire, 
} WICKED released the info at 3.am. by 3;30 every one who stuck it out
} knew.  Starting this late and being secretive wa the only way to keep the 
} numbers and the people who don't give a fuck away, the result was a very nicely
} sized FMR without incident.

The point remaining that it got overused.  Additionally, Wicked should have
had the personal responsibility to realize that overpopularization of that
site would lead to not being able to use it anymore - it might be fine one
night, but it won't be usable again by anyone else.  

I wonder how they found unique sites before I was doing site-hunting for
them, because they haven't found any unique sites since....

Oh well, it's not like there's a lack of smallish spaces around the
bay area.  Lots of sites that when I went site hunting I dismissed as
not being large enough for 1500 people but that could probably hold 
a few hundred just fine.  Hmmm...

Thank you to all of you who responded to my request for direction on where
to donate the excess money from Launch Pad.  The consensus was to give the
money to the "next party".  I have given $20 of the $24 to Lee Fogel to help
defray the cost of In The Light.  I didn't have the $4 at the time to give
him the full amount;  I will do that the next time we meet.

Thanks to everyone on the list who helped make In The Light the raging
success and fun party that it was.  Although I ended up with a rash and
a nasty sun-burn on the back of my neck (i'm such a red neck ;) ), it was
fun to help lay the foundation for a party that so many people enjoyed.
It was nice to see so many familiar faces, and even nicer to see so many
new faces at the SFR event of the season.  Almost everything went smoothly,
a fact that we SFRavers can take great pride in.  Congratulations on a
party well done!

On a less nice note, because of all the dancers kicking up dust, ethan's
mixer, and his and my decks and the amp rack took a real beating from the
dust.  As a consequence, the sliders on the mixer and on the 1200's have
a really gritty feel.  His equipment is going to have to get serviced by
a qualified person to restore it to tip-top operating condition.  If we
could all help defray that cost, it would surely help him out, and help
keep the equipment we have used for so many parties in good shape for
the many parties we'd like to enjoy.  His email is nrg@netcom.com. 
thanks in advance for your generosity.

To those of you who have told me that you still owe me a donation for In 
The Light, please redirect your efforts in Ethan's direction.  If it  
wasn't for the much cherished SoundVision sound system, ITL and loads
of other great parties would never have happened at all.  Thanx Ethan!

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


Hi all!  I'm back from Geneva now, and REALLY bummed that I missed In
The Light, but I am glad that it went off so well.  I followed and
contributed here and there to the other threads, and if anyone has sent
me mail yet hasn't heard back from me yet just be patient, I had about
1200 pieces of email to sort through despite having had occasional net
access from CERN. 

Anyways, my trip went great, better than I had thought it would be - 
there is a LOT of very cool stuff brewing on the horizon in the World
Wide Web that will make the interesting stuff we do today look like
the auto industry in the 1950's :)  I didn't get much of a chance to
check out "the scene" in Geneva, as I'm not convinced there is much of
any (I did see a DJ shop, but no fliers for local parties) though
there were quite a few young people with Sjobek shirts and the like...
I was considering shifting things around so I was in London Friday
and Saturday night but that didn't work out.  

And now for the weekly forwards.  They are arranged somewhat in 
editorial order...

        Brian

(Although I am no longer on the list, I thought that Lee deserved my public
props so, I am posting this, "blindly").

Thanks Lee for a good outdoor event!  The weather was great, the music was
good and there were alot of nice people there.  Nice One!

Lee's stress level rose a bit during the "Adventures of Markie" episode,
but other than that, he was a gracious host.  I saw him talking to many
people, making sure that things were in order, and that people were well
taken care of.  And by the mood of tyhe participants, he was doing an
excellent job.  The soundvision soundsystem was in its usual outstanding
form.  I got to talk to many who I had only seen as ascii, and that was a
treat as well.

Alot of people took the time out of busy weekend schedules to make the
party, and everyone was definitely in a mood to talk & dance a bit.  Once
again, good mood, good party.

Very Minor Gripe:
The are chosen had no grass, and was dusty.  I don't mind a dusty
warehouse, but I figure an outdoor event, if held, should have very little
dust.  Just vbecause you're outdoors does not stop soot from gathering in
your lungs (esp. when people start hoofing).  I would've preferred one of
the many meadows, surrounded by trees.  But this was only a minor problem
so....

Another Problem:
I have cited this before, and to me it is up to the promoters and his
closest pals to ensure this does not happen, but I found the crowd
racially/sexually homogenous.  There is really little excuse for it these
days.  Suffice it to say it was noticeable, and it should be corrected.


Nice One Lee, I look forward to your next event!,
John

Hayheyhay!
    It began on a dark and ominous nite as we crept undetected into the
wrecthedly beautiful bowels of stank industrial decay. Using our beat
detection sensors we picked up the faint emanation of energy. As we
directed our movement with our aural dowsing apparati it grew to a feeling
inside that we were in for a night of the SH*T!! Rounding the corner it 
seemed that a really crazy lookin' band of beings had laid down a asphalt
tarmac and we summoning something in for a landing, or no wait, maybe a
BLASTOFF! It was clear at that moment, with luv-phasers cocked and ready
that we were headed for a vibefest! OH the SOUNDS! What a beeeutiful nite
for a nifty little celebration to punctuate our little mundane existence. 
    I found myself continually drawn to the SOUNDVISION sweet spot of maximum
spectral overlap usually to be in the vicinity of a couple of guys (Bryce
& Ethan, of course!) that wavered between smiling big and doting over the
details of tuning the baddest mobile sound system I have ever had the
pleasure of hearing. I would continously find myself on the outskirts,
having a complete social BALL when BOOM - a track and DJ would begin their
emanation and I would then feel the most important thing for me to do at that
moment was to return and station my antennae for maximum absorption of the
mobile wall o' sound.
   As we arrived Will E was at the controls, as we started to get into da
groove it was damn nice to hear 4-5 tracks in his set that were fresh to my
ears and waaaay cool, the man has good form - especially how he brought things
down by gradually bringing the RPMS down to zero, strething out those
 bass notes w/ finger control, bringing us down for a safe landing down on
our LAUNCHPAD. But before that we heard some
grreat stuff from Ethan - it was really high NRG and really fun when he played
some fabulous track that we all seemed to know and love - during the break
in this song we knew that a viciously beautiful rhythymic crecendo was
inevitable and the dancers started to boil over with euphoria, howling like
primitive tribespeople. It was then that Ethan looked up at us and knew that
our minds were putty in his hands, giving us the beaming smile of approval and
knowing full well that the psychic vibe level of emanation was going to exceed
all known metering devices as the withering barage of the crecendo exploded
from the stacks, what a moment! I really don't think that any form of human
entertainment is as satisfying as what we are involved in in this scene,
WE ARE SOOO LUCKY! I'm giddy with the afterglow of this happenin'! :)
    This setting made for some killer socializin', it was great hanging out
with the various characters in attendence - Annthrax, Glen, Robert, Will E and
Phil from NYC (nice to hear about what's up on the right coast!), Sean
(and his cool collection of visuals), Neils, Jackie and Bob among others.
Mucho thanks to Bryce and Ethan for their superhuman equipment lugging and
general make things happen-ness. I hope you guys know that your efforts are
having a large positive energy amplification and reverberation effect!  
   
warmest personal regards,

Lane (and the rest of our Davis sub-posse :) )

This weekend's Financial Times reported Puma's quarterly earnings.
After poor performances in recent years, Puma is reporting a profit.
Part of this is due to restructuring.   However, it's 30 yr old CEO said
it's Puma Classics shoe first made in the 70's has been relaunched and
is selling especially well in the US.

It made me think about the economic power that the rave community has,
and maybe influence corportate policy.  We talk about giving back to the
community.  Puma has profited from the rave community, and I think it's
time they should give back.  It is my perception that Puma is the first
multinational company to profit from the rave community.

Subject: Forwarding: History of C++ & Smalltalk (casual reading)


Creators Admit UNIX, C Hoax
---------------------------

In an announcement that has stunned the computer industry, Ken Thompson,
Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan admitted that the Unix operating system
and C programming language created by them is an elaborate prank kept
alive for over 20 years. Speaking at the recent UnixWorld Software Development
Forum, Thompson revealed the following:

"In 1969, AT&T had just terminated their work with the GE/Honeywell/AT&T
Multics project. Brian and I had started work with an early release of
Pascal from Professor Niklaus Wirth's ETH labs in Switzerland and we
were impressed with its elegant simplicity and power. Dennis had just finished
reading 'Bored of the Rings', a National Lampoon parody of the Tolkien's
'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. As a lark, we decided to do parodies of the
Multics environment and Pascal. Dennis and I were responsible for the
operating environment. We looked at Multics and designed the new OS to be
as complex and cryptic as possible to maximize casual users' frustration
levels, calling it Unix as a parody of Multics, as well as other more
risqu allusions.  We sold the terse command language to novitiates by
telling them that it saved them typing.

Then Dennis and Brian worked on a warped version of Pascal, called 'A'.
'A' looked a lot like Pascal, but elevated the notion of the direct
memory address (which Wirth had banished) to the central concept of the
language.  This was Dennis's contribution, and he in fact coined the term
"pointer" as an innocuous sounding name for a truly malevolent construct.
Brian must be credited with the idea of having absolutely no standard I/O
specification:  this ensured that at least 50% of the typical commercial
program would have to be re-coded when changing hardware platforms.
Brian was also responsible for pitching this lack of I/O as a feature: it
allowed us to describe the language as "truly portable".

When we found others were actually creating real programs with A, we
removed compulsory type-checking on function arguments. Later, we added a
notion we called "casting": this allowed the programmer to treat an
integer as though it were a 50kb user-defined structure.  When we found
that some programmer were simply not using pointers, we eliminated the
ability to pass structures to functions, enforcing their use in even the
simplest applications.  We sold this, and many other features, as
enhancements to the efficiency of the language. In this way, our prank
evolved into B, BCPL, and finally C.

We stopped when we got a clean compile on the following syntax:
for(;P("\n"),R-;P("|"))for(e=C;e-;P("_"+(*u++/8)%2))P("| "+(*u/4)%2);

At one time, we joked about selling this to the Soviets to set their
computer science progress back 20 or more years.

Unfortunately, AT&T and other US corporations actually began using Unix
and C.  We decided we'd better keep mum, assuming it was just a passing
phase.

In fact, it's taken US companies over 20 years to develop enough
expertise to generate useful applications using this 1960's technological
parody. We are impressed with the tenacity of the general Unix and C
programmer. In fact, Brian, Dennis and I have never ourselves attempted
to write a commercial application in this environment.

We feel really guilty about the chaos, confusion and truly awesome
programming projects that have resulted from our silly prank so long
ago."

Dennis Ritchie said:  "What really tore it (just when AIDA was catching
on), was that Bjarne Stroustrup caught onto our joke. He extended it to
further parody Smalltalk.  Like us, he was caught by surprise when nobody
laughed.  So he added multiple inheritance, virtual base classes, and
later ... templates.  All to no avail.  So we now have compilers that can
compile 100,000 lines per second, but need to process header files for 25
minutes before they get to the meat of "Hello, World".

Major Unix and C vendors and customers, including AT&T, Microsoft,
Hewlett-Packard, GTE, NCR, and DEC have refused comment at this time.

Borland International, a leading vendor of object-oriented tools,
including the popular Turbo Pascal and Borland C++, stated they had
suspected this for a couple of years.  In fact, the notoriously late
Quattro Pro for Windows was originally written in C++.  Philippe Kahn
said: "After two and a half years programming, and massive programmer
burn-outs, we re-coded the whole thing in Turbo Pascal in three months. 
 I think it's fair to say that Turbo Pascal saved our bacon".  Another Borland
spokesman said that they would continue to enhance their Pascal 
products and halt further efforts to develop C/C++.

Professor Wirth of the ETH institute and father of the Pascal, Modula 2
and Oberon structured languages, cryptically said "P.T. Barnum was
right." He had no further comments.

As I thought, a part of 24th & Illinois *is* a city park (I think it's

I realized I hadn't posted anything about Launch Pad so here's just another
in the series of thanks to Ethan and Bryce and the DJs, it was really a
good time in spite of being a little chilly.  I'm sorry I didn't get to
hear Lee as I always enjoy his work.  But I did have a chance to talk with
Buck who says he's spending a *lot* of time in the studio these days
(good news, as that means he can build on the potential he showed on the
'New Frontier' release last year).  In case you didn't notice, he was
using some of that stuff -- on reel-to-reel! -- mixed in with the usual
vinyl.  First time I've ever seen *that* done!  Randy notes that Buck
commented on how difficult it is to mix in with reels :)  (I guess it's
because of slight mechanical variations in tape speed.)

On Friday night I went to SPAZ and saw Tamara struggle valiantly with
balky turntables and win over a good crowd.  Some very nice energy there,
especially early on.  I like the SPAZ crowd and thought they were more
music-responsive than most I've seen lately.  The old bar at 60 Sixth
is in a pretty down-and-out part of town but it's a nice place.  Looks
like SPAZ is pretty well organized and gets my recommendation.

I helped a very little bit to get In The Light set up and then had the
most enjoyable time (except for our friend the Leatherman, who pushed
the concepts of Haight St. craziness to their limit, but not one inch
further).  But even he mellowed out :-)

Another fine set by Bryce, and I was glad to hear Laura again since for
some reason this was just the second since Sunshine at AU last year (ancient
history now!).  And Markie . . . well, Buck played Sasha's 'Talk To Me'
remix, and I've remarked on the Well about how it's 'the DJ's friend', but
Markie did an extended essay on the 'Talk To Me' riff that was just sublime.
I was also pleased to hear the 'Feeling Good (Dub)' mix which is a favorite
of mine right now (and the only thing I played both days at Ameba last
weekend), and something that had that 'Bird in the Bush' sound near the end,
but was something else.  Anyway, the details scarcely matter here; it was
an excellent set that built really nicely from the foundation Bryce and
Laura had laid.  I saw lots of people wandering around the grounds sort of
slide up toward the benches and take a seat and just sort of hang around
for a long time and watch this whole phenomenon.  The sun rose in the sky
(none of the rain tentatively forecast in Friday's papers, that's for sure),
we hung out under the trees or did the raver toyi toyi out in the sun,
and everyone sure seemed to be having a nice time.  A little dusty, but
oh well!  I had to slip away around 6 to catch my flight to Seattle, but
on the way out I saw one of the park police cars parked up on the driveway,
the guy was just sitting there with his shades on, sort of smiling
bemusedly :)

I was the person who posted the original ad for the 1984 T Shirt
to this list, and I checked with the person I got the ad from, and
the artist/salesman is at one of the two addresses (according, again,
to second hand information)

jnblair@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu

or

jdblair@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu


Hopefully, you'll be able to get through.  I've noticed a strange
'feature' of muohio sites-- they tend to be unknown to large
portions of the net  (I cannot explain it)  Maybe someone on the
list knows how to get at the site if you cannot...

Thanx to everyone who participated In The Light on Saturday.  So
many people came together for this in so many ways.  The fundamentals 
were certainly in place for this one; the site, weather, great DJing
and sound system.  But what I feel really set this party apart was 
the community spirit: the table full of food & stuff, the way so many 
people helped set up, cleanup and watch over things, the continuous 
outpouring of positive energy the whole day.  We left the bandshell area 
*much* cleaner than we found it.  Sorry about the dust; we did try watering 
the ground but the Sun insisted on having it's way.  I thought the turnout
was great; I estimate that we had more than 300 over the course of the day.  

One thought that struck me during the height of the party was just how 
"right" it all seemed - there was a real sense of harmony - the general 
public seemed to enjoy what we were doing and  it seemed so natural and 
(excuse the term) "normal" to be doing it, a celebration ritual whose only 
motive is to bring out and share in the goodness that connects us all to 
each other.  

Although In The Light was put on by our community for the community,
there are two very special people that I have to single out: Bryce - who
is a goddam saint in addition to being a damn fine DJ, and my wife Janie, 
the person who more than anything makes my life worth living and was with
me on this (as always) every step of the way. 

Love to all of you *** d:-]

hi! i am an astronomy grad student and i regret
to inform y'all that there will be no parties
going on while the comet chunks are hitting
jupiter, because i will be stuck in west virginia
at that time looking at the planet with a radio
telescope.
-----------------------------------------------------
No parties for you, that is.


sadly, the impact will be very unspectacular. the
comet will hit the side of jupiter that we can't
see from earth. the earth's sky will not change
color at all, but frogs and cooked pigeons are
expected to fall from the sky in some areas. (^_^)
-------------------------------------------------------

But the atmospherical turbulence might be kinda cool looking.
