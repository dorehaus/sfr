Dear Friends & Family,

	My girlfriend & I are going to San Diego & possibly Mexico for a 
few days.  This is rather last minute.  If someone knows the address for 
SoCal Raves, or San Diego Raves, or whatever the appropriate list is for 
that area, if you could send it to me ASAP I'd appreciate it.  
	We're also interested in anything of a non-rave nature to do in 
San Diego or Mexico that any of you would highly recommend, as well as of 
course any events in the area known to be happening! 
	We are definitely on a budget, so if there's anyone from San 
Diego or thereabouts reading this who would enjoy putting up a couple 
friendly people for a night, please get in touch!  :)

Much love & thanks,
				<<< Starchild >>>

P.S. - I've been fairly busy leading up to this week (my Spring Break), 
and haven't kept up with this list at all, so my apologies if you've sent 
me email or responded to something I posted earlier and not heard back.  
I hope to devote some serious time to the computer on my return...

I have had good and bad experiences with introducing people to our family.
I introduced this girl (lets call her Jen) to parting in January.  I say I
did because her first party was acctually Cruel World and she wasn't too
sure about going again.  I explained her the difference between Cruel World
and the parties I go to.  I took her to Plastic on the 6th at the S.C.
Civic.  She loved it.  Then I took her to Chrystalis she had a great time,
however, she too complained about the Acme.  Since then she goes every
weekend with her stickers, whistle, trip toys, everything need for a great
time.  (I think Nancy and Shawna would get allong great with her.)  You
should see her now though - she insists she knows the meaning of life and
she thinks she's the shit when it comes to know-how about parties, raves,
drugs, love, etc.  Her head has grown a little too much but I still love
her.

IrieIrisGuy and I too his cousin to basics a couple a weeks ago.  He had a
good time, stayed till the end, wanted see what all the hype about e was,
got into the music a little, but over all it just wasn't his thing.  He
respected our life style, told us what he like and didn't like and that was
fine.  (Kevin ya wanna elaborate for us *lurker*)

This is the happy story.  There's a girl who I was seeing but stopped cuz
she had alot of mental problems and was very self concious (too he point of
belimicy [is this a word -sp?] was belimic).  She couldn't talk to
strangers, and couldn't respect people's coments even though she was very
good looking.  I introduced her to raves back in Dec. but she had a bad
time.  She just started going again last month and she is total changed.
She can now look at people in the eye because so many people have showed
her love and acceptance.  She has friends now, she is no longer belimic,
and she is a happy person.  What's ironic is her parents wanted to pay for
some theropy for her but a few all night parties and lots of love have
cured her non-social behavior.  I am happy for her.

Much love to S.F

Well, who could resist such a charming invitation!   :-)

My name is Marc Anthony.  No joke - that's my real name.
On the net, however, "Marc Anthony" doubles as my nom-de-plume, since most
people assume it's too wierd to be real when I tell them, and that I must
be giving them a fake name to remain anonymous.
So it goes...

I'm only a part-time partier - but a full-time Internet lurker, to be sure.
I show up at various SFraves - often with other people from Catch-22, where
I work.
There is a group of us that go to raves, regularly.
Sunsets are always my personal favorite.

Next time I'm out, I'll have to make sure I pick out a few SFravers and say
'hello'.
Thanks for encouraging outsiders to speak up.  Participation is *so* much
more fulfilling than a peepshow.   ;-)

Tah!

PS - I think this should be a annual event :  The "Rousting of the
Lurkers". Come one come all.

Marc Anthony                                                 "The suspense

I just joined the list a few days ago, and after reading Nancy's post I've
decided to come out of hiding and introduce myself.

I moved to San Mateo from Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario mid-november, but
only managed to attend my first rave here last night - the Chrysalis party.
It was a great party, and I was terribly dissapointed when I had to leave at
1 (yes, 1.. you may all laugh at me) to take my friend home, who had to go
to work early the next day. If you went to Chrysalis (before 1 <g>) you
probably saw me... I'm 6'0, with dark medium length hair, and I was wearing
an orange shirt with a big tooth on it.

some responses to various posts:
Nancy- Such a sad story about your friend. But it's best to keep trying. If
you can help one person realize something new it will be worth everything. 
I too brought a newbie to Chrysalis and she loved it. She kept going on
about what a great vibe the party had, and she's dying for me to bring her
to another party. 

John- " These bad vibes that we are trying to keep out of the party will
never go away, until we accept them and conquer them.  This doesn't mean
forcing them to see our enlightened way, but allowing ourselves to see
theirs.  When we can, we begin to notice that our ways are actually very
similar, if not the same, and thats when we can move together into the future."
I have to disagree with you here. I don't believe that we, or anyone for
that matter, should be trying to 'conquer' anything. That would be a
contradiction to the concept of love and respect. It's this kind of
my-way-is-best attitude that colonists who forced their religions on
indigenous peoples had. Do you really want to take that position? If the
rave spirit is really the best way, then people will naturally gravitate
that way, given the oppurtunity to think clearly.
Also, how can someone with a narrow mind and someone with an open mind have
the same ways? Doesn't the person with the narrow mind rely on their
prejudices to see the world while the person with an open mind does not?

Clinton- It was disheartening for me to hear that narcotics have infiltrated
the rave scene here. I'm glad you had a great experience anyway though.

Everyone- are there any Cyborganics sub'd to this list?
And can anyone tell me which DJs spin Goa?
Anyone feel free to email me, I need a little intellectual stimulation -
school certainly isn't providing it. :(

peace.
Brendan

Important notice for April 1, 1996.

Our annual system "spring cleaning" gets underway Monday here at 
community.net, and by about 11:30 a.m. we will be blowing the dust out of the 
modem cables. Some of the back-presure may travel along the phone lines 
affecting list members who are reading their mail at that time. This may 
cause dust to spray out of your keyboard, mouse and modem if it's an 
external one. In order to prevent this you might want to cover these 
items with a clean cloth or handkerchief during the half hour from 11:30 
to noon. This particular process will not run past noon and will only 
occur once this year. Thanks for understanding.

The location does contribute to everyone's enjoyment (or not) of a party,

When someone says "[insert venue here] sucks" they usually mean "[said

I'd agree with that.  I've been on the list almost a month now, but haven't
been terribly enthusiastic about posting (also, I haven't had much to say,
this stuff is still pretty new to me).

Anyways, for the _formal_ introduction: my full name is Voltaire T. Dacanay
(I go by volt).  I attended UCLA, got my degree in Russian Studies in 1993,
and for the past few years have been working in computer information systems
and as a gymnastics coach (it doesn't pay terribly well, but I derive great
satisfaction in knowing I can and have helped people on any level, plus I
would like to continue competitive tumbling if my ankle ever heals).  I've
been taking classes at a local j.c. so I can either go back for a second
bachelor's or a master's in *i really have no idea what*.  Physically, I'm
short (5'3"), 140 lbs (most of which resides above the belt -- I have
chicken legs), filipino, short black hair, no distinguishing body piercings
or tattoos, and love to eat, dance, tumble and play volleyball. (And yes I
can do a backflip -- you wouldn't believe how many people ask me that.)

Oh yeah, and at this particular point in my life I lack direction.

The initial attraction to raving for me was admittedly to check out the
hedonistic ritual currently in vogue, but after reading a few posts from the
list I saw that there was much more to it than just that.  I find that when
I'm searching for inner peace (which for me entails some semblance of
direction and/or decorum), I'll go to great lengths to achieve it, and after
reading some of the posts I thought maybe ravers are searchers too, only
more open and supportive of one another in their searching, and perhaps we
have more in common than meets the eye.  So that's why I've been checking
things out.  I could, of course, be completely wrong, which has been known
to happen not infrequently.

I must say I'm still not completely comfortable with "the scene", having
been to very few events.  I still feel like there's something missing when
I'm out there.  I see faces but I can't remember names so I don't go up and
say 'hi' too much, I'm still too inhibited and self-conscious to try.  But
I'd still like to try.  Who knows, maybe with time I'll meet more of you and
actually fit into your big happy community, but for now I'm on the outside
looking in.

PLUR,

It's so cool that Nancy posted to invite the "lurking audience" to show
themselves to the group!  I had the great pleasure of meeting Nancy recently,
and seeing her on Friday night at Nikita (where she was a little surprised that
the "club" scene that night was filled with some of us regular ravers too) - and
at Chrysalis, where we talked after her friend decided to leave, not liking what
was REALLY a good party with GREAT people (thank you Gateway Systems!) -- 

It is so amazing to me as I continue to meet and re-greet people I've first
gotten to know on this group -- I've been planning to move to Seattle, partly
because the scene up there is a little smaller and more open and welcoming --
but over the last 2 months, meeting more SFRavers and expanding my group of
friends at parties, I'm having second thoughts about leaving SF.  If you haven't
started to meet people from SFR yet, JUST DO IT!  

And I LOVE seeing the responses and introductions from you lurkers -- I know a
lot of people think others may not be interested in who we are or what we think,
but that's really not true -- share your thoughts and ideas!

And ... just in case you've missed my thousand and one descriptions of who I am
.... I'm hard to miss -- I'm a voluptuous (chubby?) older (than most of you,
anyway) woman, I (almost always) wear crazy vintage hats (a white straw derby
with a bow on the back at Chrysalis and an orange straw hat with fringe around
the edges at Nikita this week), I have tattoos on both shoulders, wear LOTS of
silver bracelets, and am usually found in a corner somewhere dancing my heart
out (or is that my heart open?)  So, don't be shy, I'm really nice and would
love to meet you!  

See you at ComeUnity!  Leslie  : )

David,

What time and frequency is "Over the Edge"? I'm a big old Negativland fan who
just recently moved to the Bay Area, and haven't gotten completely familiar
with the airwaves here yet.

Hi, my name is Krishna.  I've been lurking for about three weeks, but I've
been using sfraves weekly calender since last july.  Around may last year
I began to rave, although I went to a really fun new years party
in the city that was seed for my future.  I had a tight group of
friends who I went out with sometimes four times a week, after-parties and
all.  You may have met some of them; Oliver, Mark(green hair), Grady,
Jason, all totally xstatic Stanford students breaking away from years of
indoctrination and bullshit.  That summer was monumental for all of us.
It was the first time we had ever felt communal love,
and we we're swept up in the intensity of it.

Well, school rolled around all too soon, and we all freaked out in our own ways
I retreated to Mendocino and got really sick for three months.  My friends
thought that I bailed out on the friendship, and maybe I did, but I needed for
my own sanity to get healthy.  I had to catch up on numerous missed nights of
sleep.  I was pretty damaged.  School was not even an option.

Anyway, I'm feeling really healthy now, and have learned alot about
myself.  I realize it's not required to go to evey after-party that
exists.  Although, I would probabally be going out more frequently now if
I had a car.

I had a phenominal time at the sfraves cabin trip.  Moonpup, you're a gas.
Steveo, thanks for totally out doing yourself.

Oh, let me see, I'm 5'8, I have a blue spiral snake wrapped around my
right forearm. I have a long strip of bleached hair sprouting
out of the top of my head. Melissa tells me, "You have a
cute little pink rosebud" but I'm not so sure.  I can never stop
dancing.  I love to dance almost more than anything.
That's enough I guess.  Except that I'm currently working on a house
dancing video for a school project.  Does anyone have any crazy
dancing video footage they'd let me borrow?  It would never go public.
It's just for myself.

Hope to party with you all soon.  Don't hesitate to introduce yourselves.
Perky Boobs Flying Everywhere
Krishna.

[Non-rave portion]
        This past weekend was the best so far this year for me, in and
outside of the rave scene!  The bands I played in rocked at the party on
Friday, and everyone there had a great time.  My band's original guitarist
showed up (haven't seen him in months!), to my surprise, and joined us all
on stage.  He's exceptional, and a beautiful person, and will be living in
the Chico area for a while, from what I understand.  After the party, my
friends and I hung out at my drummer's sister's place, where some of us got
pretty fungal :)
[Rave portion]
        Marty, Todd, and I are no longer Chrysalis virgins after Saturday
night's party!  First, we all met each other for the first time at the
Golden Gate Park party, where I also saw some newer and older friends (hi
everyone!), but not many people I knew among all who were there.  Marty
spotted me by my ponytail :)  I enjoyed the park and the weather, and
thanks to Carin I'm not lobster-red!  I danced a bit, but the dust kicked
my butt (make that sinus).  I sneezed for days, and my nose wouldn't stop
running for hours!  The three of us got our tix and grubbed some Mexican
food (massive burritos on Haight, across/up the street from F-8), then went
to Mt. View to kick it at Todd's for a while.  We looked at photos of
Burning Man and the Tahoe trip, and now I'm even MORE sorry I missed both!
Not again...
        We met inside at Chrysalis.  Right when I got upstairs, I knew this
was going to be a good one.  The place was decked out just the way I like
it: dark, lots of glowing neon art, animation screens, incense in the chill
area, and friendly smiles everywhere :D  By the time I found the dance and
chill areas and set up camp with Marty and Todd, I'd already greeted three
friends!  I sat with leftjab and some people for a while, then started
exploring.  The dance floor was alive the whole night, but some of the
music was too fast for me to dance to.  I danced a while, then got too hot
(the drawback to the location: no fresh air!) and spent almost the entire
night in the chill area.  Every few minutes, I saw a friend; when I wasn't
greeting friends, I was making new ones!  The vibe was incredible, and
added so much to my happy state that for the longest time, all I could to
was sit, or lie back, and smile from ear to ear.  Friends would spot me and
come over to talk, too, which pleased me no end!  I became the proud owner
of the coveted SFR laminate, and feel honored to be among the rest of the
laminate-wearers :)
        I was more elated and blissful than I've been in a long, long time.
The big butterfly on the wall was hypnotizing when the light would flash,
the colors flashing brighter with each flash of the light.  I was
completely spellbound, and happily still able to communicate, so I got to
talk more than usual (but still not enough; I mean to talk with all of you
more in the future ;)).  The fruit shakes were delicious and refreshing,
and the muffins were great.  There were moments when I felt that I should
be sharing my good time with others, but there were so many distractions
that I feel I didn't pay enough attention to any one person in particular.
Just the same, I was overjoyed to be sharing such a wonderful thing with so
many other people.
        I finally mustered enough energy (which the heat was sapping all
night) to dance when I suspected the last tune was spinning, so I got in
the last of the set, and instead of exhausting me, it charged me a bit, but
nothing topped Jimi Hendrix' "Little Wing"!  It was heavenly, and was the
perfect ending as the morning light was exposed.
        I had the honor of driving Marty back to Todd's place, where we
crashed, and I gave someone a jump-start before grabbing my shut-eye.  Todd
arrived just after I awoke and made ready to leave, and went right to bed,
so I bade Marty farewell and drove home.  It's so nice to drive in the
morning, when there's no traffic to speak of, with all the wonderful
feelings still coursing through my body and mind.
        To everyone I saw at the party, I'm glad we were able to share such
an outstanding party!  To Gateway Systems, THANK YOU so much for giving
this to us; you guys rule!!  And to everyone who was there, whether I know
you or not: I LOVE YOU ALL!!!  :):):)

See youse next time,

- E

        That's too bad, i too have had similar experiences with 'old
friends' ("aren't you a little old to be going to those rave things?" or
"are those things still going on? i thought that was just a fad", etc). I
often see relationships with an other person as being like two different
sine waves, each going at different frequencies: sometimes you're in phase
with them but, as time goes on you may go out of phase. Such is the way
things change i guess. I suppose you just have to 'stick to your sound' and
hope you can find someone else to groove along side of you :)

        Well i work hard in emphasizing for myself the respect for other's
views, this is often helped when you understand that the position they
speak from is a subjectivity that is complex with subtleties that you may
not understand, for them they may feel that they're views are 'right'
because they only know their own selves and sometimes things that us
"positive people" may see as being negative is, to them, being 'realistic.'
        I suppose i've been fortuante enough to have had a wide variety of
feelings/thoughts/opinions about things in my life, so i can empathize with
your friend possibly. About two years ago i was a cynical depressive
weenie, yet at the time i thought that my world views were 'realistic.'
Negativity had been so embedded in my consciousness from experiences in
childhood and bein' a teenager and yadda yadda yadda that, to be honest, i
had forgotten what it was like to be happy. All things are relative (as
Einstein, not to mention a few buddhists would tell ya) so, for me, my
'happiness' at that time would have been what i'd call 'slightly depressed'
now (as opposed to 'totally whoa depressed' which would have been on the
other end of the spectrum).  I had been told that i was like this by
friends at the time and, naturally, i felt somewhat angry about it, and
denied it. My feelings were very real, and were just a 'natural' reaction
to my life experiences; i was justified in seeing things as being crappy,
because (in my mind) they were.
        Then something totally magical happened. Sorry for using such a
cliche (my creative writing prof would wince if he saw that ;) but that's
the only way i can describe it. Something changed within me, a few factors
somehow made me remember the kind of peace and happiness that a lot of us
feel as children, yet after years and years of negative experiences,
schooling and all that are buried.  With these new feelings inside me, i
could see what my usual mental attitude was _relative_ to these feelings.
And that new (well, remembered) feeling of happiness and positivity was
like a fulcrum on a see-saw; i had something to bounce off of to push me up
a bit higher. Before, my emotional state was pretty much like a big board
lying on the ground ;P :)
        I realized the simple fact that our views on the world can change,
and just the simple knowledge that there are heights of beauty that we CAN
attain but first we must allow ourselves to believe that they're "there" to
be attained.  To use another analogy, it's easier to climb up to a plateau
on a mountain if you know that it's there. And when you get there after all
that struggle, you'll probably realize that you can still go higher :)
        I think i turned out ok. Having friends around who love you helps a
lot, and so your friends sound like thier quite lucky to have you there,
but after everything if one is to start feeling love for anything one first
has to start loving themselves. Don't get frustrated with your friends,
know that everyone can change (and, actually, we don't have much choice in
the matter! :) and that even people that were like me can end up WAY
different almost overnight.
        Relatedly, i think that a lot of my negativity was caused by having
a lot of bad experiences; yet still having a little spark of light inside
me telling me that the world CAN be better and i was frustrated at not
being able to change other people. In the end, i realized that the only
thing you have much control over changing is yourself, your views,
behaviours and actions and the external manifestations of this light. So,
once i started changing myself from within, making that spark of light
grow, and not trying to change other people, i found myself happier and
that light attracted others who were looking for the same thing: happiness,
peace, positivity. In a way, i _did_ change the world, because so much of
what we call 'reality' is simply one's mental perception of it. I would
notice the beauty of a flower on the street, rather than the garbage that
clogged up the gutter beside it.  Just remember, light attracts light :)

>It makes me sad because it is not necessary, it is her choice
>to live life that way.
        :) Yeah, well _you_ know that and _i_ know that but (if she's at
all like i was) she probably thinks that she doesn't have a choice and that
'this is just the way things are'.
>I let her go because I no longer wish to pollute my

>with people who are on the same wavelength, about opening up to greater and

        Oh definitely, but i also find it _just_ as useful for spiritual
growth to be put in situations where others are at odds with your world
view; they act as foils for your beliefs, complexifying them and making
them stronger AND it can still be quite a boost for you because you see
exactly how positive you are. Every now and then i go back to this old
punk/industrial club that i used to hang out at and i see 'where i was' and
feel 'where i am' and i'm pretty amazed with the whole situation that i've
gotten myself into :) Yay for raves! :)
        How's this for a test of faith-->a couple of weeks ago i went to a
massive in montreal (where i'm temporarily located) which (supposedly) was
funded by bikers who also controlled the flow of ummmm 'stuff' within the
party. Word has it that a few 'independants' were roughed up as they were
encroaching upon a captive market. The sound system was like a AM radio on
a cheap ghetto blaster on the bottom of a pool, the smile-0-meter was
getting a few blips but not much. I did the old "smile at someone only to
have a hard stare returned to me and have me keep smiling back" thing all
night. I can only feel sorry for people like that but, in the end there's
not much i can do for 'em.  They can't bring ME down though, because i'm ME
and i'm a positive person! I ended up having a pretty good night, all
things considered. I suppose i could have easily found things to complain
about but that's not as much fun (or sometimes, a challange) as remembering
how lucky i am just to be healthy and alive and shakin my booty; even if it
was to really boring mellow house coming out of a bad sound system
(apologies to house-heads out there, just my personal taste).
        Well, this turned out to be a little longer than expected but i
just wanted to pass this along. Be positive and also never let anyone tell
ya that drugs have addled your mind, and that positivity is just a chemical
reaction. It's only a window to radiate out the light that's already within
all of us!
        Have a great day!
        your positive april fool,
                        brad

Well, it's a problem of semantics I guess.  But I feel that those negative
vibes arise because of our own judgements, and the only way they ever change is
by our own choosing not to see people in that light... So when I say conquering,
I mean recognizing that we are judging people, ranking them lower or
higher than ourselves, and then finding a way out of that state of mind.
It's an entirely personal battle, and has nothing to do with forcing
change on anyone other than ourselves.  It's the same thing as learning
to love, or just respect everyone else. Which on some nights, can be quite
a struggle.

I don't think that any way is truly best... but I do think that if
you want to move in any direction, you have to let everyone else move
in their own directions.

They have the same ways because the difference between an open mind and
a narrow mind is just a judgement on behalf of the 'open minded' side.
If you're sitting there with someone who you think is narrow minded,
chances are it's just you who haven't bothered to pay close enough attention
to who that other person is.  If you did, you might find that you are both
moving in the same direction, albeit along slightly different paths.

respectfully,
-john.

It was unfortunate to see that the nice, comfortable, clean dance studio
location used for Chrysalis was tagged and damaged by disrespectful
people.  The bathrooms were tagged, a mirror was scribed, and a window (!?)
was broken.  As a result:

1.  Gateway will have to pay for damages, taking money, energy and incentive
away from doing future parties.

2.  That particulary cool location will be more difficult to get for
future parties.

I know most people from sfraves would not disrespect a location like this.  
But there is obviously kids out there who do not know that damaging locations 
is the worst thing you can do for the scene... becuase the hardest part of 
throwing parties is finding decent locations.

Nancy & everyone-
I used to post things almost every day, then I stopped because 1) I felt 
as though I was grating on people's nerves and 2) I was spending far too 
many hours of my day writing e-mail. 

I dropped off the list; recently I have dropped back in to see what is 
up. 

Many of my thoughts are of a cynical and self-probing nature. I am pretty 
critical of everything, including myself. My reflections on the rave 
scene are usually mixed with good & bad... I also have somewhat of an 
attitude which I don't want to share with everyone, so there. :-P That is 
why I am lurking right now, be thankful. 

I was at Chrysalis with Wayne and his posse of folks; I was the rather 
tall woman with short blonde hair who was passing around a bottle of 
lavender oil & Skittles.

-Amy

all right then - i've been on sfraves since last fall, but haven't posted
much - i've been buried in my classes for the past couple of months,
since this is my first time back in college for three years - quite a
change in environment!

anyway, my name's matt - i'm about 5'6", black hair, and a goatee (for
shame) still in the process of growing out.  soon, i won't look like i'm
sixteen anymore!  i'm planning on being out and about a lot more this
spring, so if you see me please say hi.

met a few of you at chrysalis, but not enough!  hi to gonzo (the burger king)
if christian (with a british accent and a string of pearls) is out there,
please mail back - my friend mark thinks he might have gone to high school
with you - small world, isn't it.
matt

You might want to print out some of the responses you've gotten to this 
message and send them to her.  Ask her how "fake" these all seem to her.  
And if she still feels they're fake, ask her then to point to something real...

I disagree with some of the posts.  You were NOT acting superior.  Raving is 
just another experience.  It's like telling someone they have just *got* to 
try Italian food.  You're not saying Italian is better than anything else, 
but it sure hits the spot, and it's another thing to experience, to 
hopefully enjoy, and to enrich one's life.  If that person decides at that 
point that Italian is now their favorite food, well good for them and kudos 
to you for introducing them to it!  If not, at least they (hopefully) tried 
it with an open mind.

Wise saying for the day:  People are about as happy as they make up their 
minds to be.

I've always been, and always will be, a little kid.  I'm a professional at 
work, and a responsible adult at all times, but I love to play and be as 
friendly as I want to be without fear of rejection, and raving gives me 
that.  Within the bounds of "PLUR", if you choose to use that definition, I 
can be the wonderful, laughing, joyous kid inside of me along with all the 
other "kids".  I, at the time straight-laced, slightly cynical, and 
anti-drug, took to raves like a fish to water, and I've been swimmin' my 
little heart out ever since...

Much love, dear Nancy,

Todd

Wow.  I'm toasted (another slang word?).  Yup, definitely a dark toasting, 
but not quite burnt...

NIKITA: Not bad.  Saw some sfravers -- Nancy (in the men's room!), Leslie 
(bein' a Mac Mamma next to the speakers), and other good ravin' friends.  
Had a pretty good time all in all.  Did some dancing, but to be honest, I 
guess I had expected better from someone with the reputation that Keoki has. 
 He had his moments, and I *moved* when he did, but all in all it wasn't 
quite the earth-shattering dance-a-thon I was expecting.  And just before I 
left -- we pooped out early (3am?) -- there was the no-no of all no-no's -- 
the music got *ripped*.  Something hit the decks hard enough to REALLY send 
the needle flying.  Ouch!  There was this horrendous SCRATCH, and then 
nothing.  For a while.  And then music again.  Hm.  The mac daddy room 
upstairs was kinda cool to hang out in.  Lotion and slow groovin'.  Chatted 
with Tom & Stacey.  Met Jennifer and ... her boyfriend (dang, I'm bad with 
names)...  So, due to the cool people, I had a really good time, but Doc 
Martin put on the best Nikita...heck, the best club event... that I've been 
to since the MLK Spundae.  Keoki just didn't quite hit that mark.

ORGANIC AT GG BANDSHELL: Arrived late.  Spent THREE HOURS hanging out on 
Haight waiting for Chrysalis tix to show up.  Wandered around during that 
time, found a drum circle at the east end of GG, and it was *jammin'*!  
Danced a bit, shared a lot of smiles.  Finally gave up on the tix and went 
to the party.  Saw Jennifer again -- she's so funny!  Everyone was having a 
darn good time, but I was mainly there to pick up Marty.  She and I and Eric 
took off, picked up our tix, and headed for...CHRYSALIS!  

Funny story: Met up with Marcello at the GG party and he told me this one.  
He was dancing, flirting w/the ladies, and selling DJ tapes.  Someone came 
up to him and asked, "Do you have any Keoki tapes?"  Marcello replies the he 
doesn't carry Keoki because Keoki is on a perpetual ego-trip, or something 
to that effect.  The guy gets kind of a weird look on his face and sits 
there for a second, then says, "I'm Keoki."  WHOOPS!

CHRYSALIS:  DAMN!  I loved this rave!  The chill room was *perfect*.  I like 
*interesting* visuals in an ambient space, ok lighting, and good tunes.  
This hit the mark!  They had cheap water 8) fruit 8) and tasty juice 8)8)... 
 The dance space had good lighting, a laser (essential IMHO), and *really* 
good music.  I've never danced to trance until this rave, and I found that I 
could not only keep up, I got FFFFFFFUNKY!  I'm talkin' 
funkier-than-a-fat-man's-feet, FUNKY.  I got tribal, all body, stompin...  
The housier stuff later was excellent!  Two problems with this rave.  (1) 
The heat was slightly oppressive, but not too bad.  Better ventilation would 
have been nice, but the fans helped.  (2) For a while there, the fuses kept 
tripping.  Actually I found this amusing, that we were sucking so much power 
that the house couldn't handle it.  At some point the problem was resolved.  
I MET SO MANY PEOPLE!!!!  And folx, I have arrived: I now have a laminate.  
ooooooooo!  Hey, don't touch, just look...
Saw Nancy (cute stickers), Vince (the "dreaded" one), Wayne (tall and 
funny), Shawna (BIG hug), Black Adder (political discourses), Leftjab 
(kaleidascopes), Leslie (big grins), Chris (funny stories), Rikki (surely a 
Star) -- hell, it'll take me days to remember them all.  And Alex!  And 
Jennifer with her sunburnt nose!  Marty, Eric, and my GF Michelle all agreed 
that it was quite likely the BEST party we've EVER been to!  If you didn't 
go, you MISSED.  

Gateway Systems rules...huhuhuhuh...

Sunday: Immediately after Chrysalis, went to the deli that Michelle works 
at.  Volunteered to help get a catering order for 200 people put together.  
Worked like mad from 5:30 until 9am.  Ouch.  Staggered home, slept 'til 5pm. 
 Nuff said.

Hope yours was as good as mine!  See you all at SUNSET!!!

Well after the last wicked at dv8 I went to, I thought I wouldn't go 
back to that location, thinking it was too hot and smokey for me.  With 
a strong craving to dance from missing the weekend parties due to work, 
angela and I thought we'd give spundae a try at dv8.  
When we got there Jeno was mixing some good stuff, but having just 
gotten off work, I wasn't all that into it.  At one point I didn't know 
if I'd be able to stay very long as it seemed that angela and I were 
the only ones on the dance floor not smoking.  But we found a good spot 
up front with no smokers and some high energy dancers.  
By the time Markie came on I was finally starting to trance out.  By 
2am alot of the alcohol/smokers were leaving.  The vibe was growing 
stronger as the night went on.
After Markie's set which really had me trancing, Emma came on with some 
real funky stuff that got the house rockin.
It turned out, after a slow start, we had a great time!  
That drummer dude from the sunset party was there.  Fortunately he was 
set up in the back, so we didn't notice him all that much.
I'd definitely recommend this on a sunday night, especially with a dj 
line up like last night.  But if you get bothered by smokers, I'd come 
after 2am.

I can see why...  While at Harmony,  they had NO FANS,  it got steiffling
hot,  almost to the point where I blanked out...  I finally work my way to the
door,  and asked the owner if I could stand outside until I recover,  and
he said "No,  once you leave you cannot get back there...  is that a problem?
if so,  then you can leave right now",   He when pulled on my arm to get me
out,  I yanked it away and said "can I at least get my jacket?"  I went
back in with the intention of keeping away from that dickhead.   He's the
shorter dude with blond hair (looks like he might have had it dyed).

Eentually I HAD to get some cool air,  so Instead I sat on the stairs
next to the door "Making it more difficult for people to use the stairs,
but I HAD to get some air".    Since then  I made up my mind to NEVER
EVER go into that "Death trap" again,  and I urge all of you to please
boycott the Acme.    I also heard yesterday that the fire marshell
shut it down,  so "Stomp" got moved to somewhere else.

I went to Crysylis,  but the 24th st dance studio at least had some cool
places to go to,   but of course it was steiffling hot.

HEY FOLX!  I *highly* recommend these tapes!  They are all the way ON!  For 
the quality music on these tapes you may never see a deal like this ever 
again!  Better get them now before this stellar talent leaves for the UK!  
The Tahoe tape set includes an amazing live performance and several *really* 
good DJs along with Moonpup himself.  A must have!

S

PS. Moonpup: I've been borrowing Michelle's set to listen to, but I want to 
get a set for myself as well.  Could you bring a set to the Easter Sunset?  
It would be *much* appreciated.

Did anyone go (or try to go) to Lucky Charms?  I heard they had some problems
with the map point... like a riot or something?  Can anyone who was there
tell the list what happened?

I sort of think "it serves them right" for distributing a flier with
blatant drug references so widely...  I bet they put them in shopping malls.
Of course this sort of promotion will attract a bad vibe.

It was really awful to see the location not being cared for Saturday night -- I
take dance classes there, and really liked being in that space for a party.

I wonder if it would be helpful if the organizers at all parties post some
colorful obvious signs in the bathrooms and hallways to remind those people who
may not be thinking of the consequences of their actions.  For instance, a big
colorful sign on the bathroom mirror might have discouraged the young girls who
thought it was so funny to cover the mirror with soap... I think they just
weren't thinking. 

Thank you Chrysalis for having so many thoughtful things:

1. having ashtrays around, and for being so on top of cleaning up throughout the
night. 

2.  such a beautiful chill space, with such great light show

3.  Having as many fans as possible, even though those rooms REALLY are hot no
matter what

4.  Sharing such a wonderful breakfast - that's really my favorite moment, when
the juice and muffins go on the table, and people start moving toward it, and
soon we're all eating together like a family in the morning ... I really love
that.

We all need to be aware that parties belong to us all, and we should maybe be
more self-"policing" (is there a better word?) to care for our space.   

Hugs   Leslie   :)

some unnamed california beach -- an early, accurate, and positive
accounting of the rave scene in the press... There's mention of this in
the early SFR archives.

Woah there. I don't think you should make any assumptions about the age of
the people doing this. I am 31 and have been spotted tagging advertising
and the like as recently as last week. But I would of course never do
something like this at a rave.
 
One of the very special thing about raves to me is the great diversity
of ages everywhere. I have rave friends 17 to 40 and I am sure there 
are people older and younger than that around.

But maybe you meant "kid" in maturity, not chronological age.

Btw, great party, great location. I sure hope we can use it again.

Hugs,
Jim

It was very obvious that Bagok Tribes' promoters were disorganized, and have
no idea how to throw a rave.
The flier alone not only helped to attract the wrong crowd, but also gives a
weapon to people/authorities against our "scene".

I think the flier first started getting distributed a month ago, so it was
pretty obvious that is was going to get a large attending, which it did.
When you have a "massive" rave, it is ignorant to have 1 map point, which
opened 1/2 hour before the party starts.  
I got to the cafe at around 11:30, and it looked like the rave was in the
street outside the map-point.  The cafe was jammed full of people, and there
were hundreds waiting to get inside.  My friend and I stood and watched from
across the street, because it looked like it would only be a few minutes
before it rioted, or the police would come.  At around 12, the people in the
cafe gave up, and threw papers with directions to the party into the crowd.
As soon as we got the location, we left, because the numbers of police were
increasing...

When we got in line at the warehouse, it was pretty obvious the same riot
was going to from.   They had, once again, hundreds of people waiting, with
only 2 bouncers checking people in.  The security didn't know how to control
the crowd, and the delays getting in didn't make it any better.  The
promoters also kept bringing their cars through the center of the crowd, to
let them into gate behind the building, which caused more delays.  They
should have waited for the line to die downs, and then get their friends
cars in.  

  Just after my friend got in, and I was about to get checked, one of the
promoters, or possibly security, wanted everyone to line up single file.  I
want to know what he was on.  It would be enough of a task to get 500 people
to line up straight, but single file???  Of course, it never happened, and
it started getting uglier.  Then came another bit of entertainment from one
of the promoters, who decided he needed to make a speech.  He said something
about how much it sucked the "We" rushed the map point, broke down the door,
etc.  They shouldn't have had the map point in the first place, and can
blame only themselves.  There have been bigger parties, in smaller places,
without such problems.

  After he was done spewing, some of the intelligent people who attended
decided to start pushing.  At one point, the side door got opened, and about
a dozen people rushed in.  I had been pushed back about 20 people, and
decided I had enough entertainment, and went across the street to watch.  

One of the security people had been talking to an Oakland officer for a
while, and got him to help out. The officer, in his car with lights and
sirens going, played chicken with the people on the sidewalk, to get them to
line up against the building.  Luckily the person who threw the can missed,
and the cop didn't hit anybody.

They started telling people if they didn't have a ticket, they couldn't get
in.  Very few people had tickets, and were lined up in one line, people with
tickets in another.  I figured if I was going to get in, it would be hours.
I couldn't leave, because I drove my friend, who I assumed was still alive
inside.

At around 2:am I went back.  There were about 50 to 100 people still
waiting.  The guards were saying no one else could get in.  Something about
being full, and the police would shut them down if they did.  I went back to
rave a little more in my car.  At about 3, I tried again.  The line was
about 15 people, and they were letting them in.  I got in line, and when I
got to the front, it was the promoter who made the speech collecting money.
He said it was $30 to get in.   I was a bit confused, and asked what kind of
a discount I would get for my can.  He told me the deal was this:  
  Since the police threatened to close them down if they let anyone else in,
and they were "Full", the guards (Lyon Securities) would take the "risk", if
they got a $10 dollar cut from each person.  Raving blackmail is a new one
to me.  He told me that's the deal, he didn't make the decision, and wanted
to know if I was in or out.  I told him I didn't have much choice, and my
car was getting kinda lonely, and gave him $30.  

I got inside, and it was a lot like a "Cool world".  Same mixed crowd, and
mixed attitudes.  Found my friend inside rather quickly, he had been looking
for me for hours.  It wasn't full, and I doubt it ever got full.

The promoters had several of their own "areas", which explained a lot about
their apparent high egos.  I saw my friend, the promoter who made the
speech, dancing away in their area, giving the finger to the guy with the
cam corder.  Can't say I didn't get my share of entertainment out of the
whole thing.

I have lost all my respect for Lyon Securities now.  I used to think they
were pretty good too.  The only way I will go to a Bankok Tribe party again,
is if they change their name so I don't know it is the same group.

Hope my can was put to good use.


Anyone else have a good time??

Lucky Charms was wack!
I was planning to go to Chrysalis but
I brought a bunch of newbies and they wanted to go
to a "big" rave.

Anyway, we got to the map point(Yo Mama's Cafe) at about
11:00. The line was long but not that long. The problems
started mainly because the security(or lack of it) was unable
to control the line. Everybody, as usual in that situation,
started to cut, so much so that by 12:00 the line was more
like a mob all squished like sardines in front of the door.
Everybody started to become irritated, and soon everyone was
yelling and pushing. At this point I wigggled my way close to
door. Next thing I know somebody breaks the door down, and people
at the doorway start throwing what they called "tickets" into
the mob. I was able to get one these tickets, and saw that it was
just directions to the location. I asked the guy distributing these
what was up, he said that they would start selling tickets at the
location. At that point a shitload of cops zoomed up, closed
off the streets, and everybody scattered.

By now I ready to go to Chrysalis, but these hardcore newbies
were determined, so we proceeded to the "warehouse" location.

Did I say "warehouse"??? The voice mail did. quote - " a
virgin, 20,000 sq. ft. warehouse". The rave was held in an
inline roller rink. I was immediately reminded of nightmares
from the Pittsburg roller rink off of Railroad. On top of that,
as we rolled by, a massive line began to form at the entrance.
I jumped out of the car and ran into line. By the time my friends
got to the line, it had tripled, to about 300 feet back.

Everyone was pissed about the map point, so they tried to pull the
same shit that they did over there. I smelled bad vibe, and
wanted to go. At the request of my friend I stuck it out and
we got in about 2:15. The party was okay- a little too crowded -
way too hot. The chill rooms were more like sweat rooms, and it was
a bitch to get off the dancefloor as there was just one little
opening to the arena.

As I ran into my buddies, met new people, and spread and over-
abundance of good vibe(the party needed it). Everything started
to turn out okay. I talked to the owner of the building, and he
was pretty shaken up about the whole thing. I guess we lost that
location.(tagging didn't help either)

As you mentioned Troy, I think the promotions as well as the flier
contributed to near-bust of this party. I was thinking that they
probably distributed fliers at every local high school. Way too
many people showed up, and some of them just did not know what the
fuck was up.

The Bagok Tribe tried really hard to get this party to go off, but
they made a lot of mistakes reminiscent of Ex-Why-Zzz? As long as
they don't let this happen again, apologize, and maybe thow us a free
party, I wish them good fortune in their future events.

I'm sure if Lyons knew any of their guards were pulling that bullshit
they'd take care of it, but this sounds suspiciously like a convenient
excuse from a greedy promoter. If his party was full why wouldn't he cut
some slack and knock of some of the $20 he was getting from you? Whatever,
at least the flier gave me a couple minutes of laughter when I first saw
it. =)

Went to Chrysalis on Saturday, which was great as expected, with a nice big
chill room. Thanks to Claire for giving up her slot so I could play after a
scheduling mix up. Minor's set in the main room was great, as always. I was
sorry to hear that there was some tagging going on and I hope everything
worked out with the space. Props to Gateway.

Checked out a new ambient/electronica weekly called Techsture on Sunday
night. Tomas & Markus, old friends of mine from LA days are doing this and
it's quite the place to relax after a weekend of raving. It's at Cafe Abir,
corner of Divisadero & Fulton and it's free. Miguel from Single Cell
Orchestra is spinning this Sunday and I'll be playing on 4/14. It runs from
8p-12a

Actually, I saw the girls starting to put soap on the mirror (I wish I had
stepped forward to say something but I didn't realize how far they would end up
going with it, and since I'm older, I'm particularly careful not to appear like
someone's mother) -- and they WERE kids, giggly teenagers....  

As a really non-agist person (I'm 42, my friends range from 18 to 82, mostly in
the 25-to-30ish range) -- I think it's a fair observation that most vandalism IS
done by young kids -- it seems to be a phase of expressing why they don't want
to follow anyone elses rules or something -

- I would have bet we'd be hard-pressed to find people over the age of 25 who
would even consider defacing property like that.... but you're telling us
proudly that you do it...  I don't get it... 

Now, why you are out tagging private property -- at any age, but especially at
31 -- is pretty much a mystery to me -- I happen to love a lot of graffiti art,
and love the surprise of seeing quality, thoughtful work in special places, on
sides of buildings that would be blank, bland and boring otherwise, or on cement
walls, etc. --- 

but billboards, no matter what you think of advertising and marketing, are
private property, just like houses and buildings, and dance studios and bathroom
walls --- and NO ONE has the right to destroy someone else's property ...
remember, PLUR, the R is respect?  Do unto others?.....

And besides, most tagging is sincerely ugly. I for one don't want to have to
look at that visual scarring and clutter all over the city. I don't care how
cool some gangsta thinks his initials look, they're ugly.

You say you would never do this at a rave?  I think we should aim to have the
same standards for treating people and our environment with respect wherever we
are, Muni bus or Grace Cathedral.

You want to make your mark on the world?  Paint on a canvas that you can keep or
give away, create art that will stay around for a while!  

So much for not sounding like a mom -- hey, I can't help it -- but I really have
strong feelings about the line between art, expression and vandalism ....  

Sorry for going off on you here, hugs to you too, Jim.  

Leslie   : )

Whoa yourself.  Are you serious?  You're into vandalizing?  Where do you 
draw the line?  At what point do you say to yourself, "People probably don't 
want to see what I'm scrawling, and I'm writing on something that DOESN'T 
BELONG TO ME"?

Where does respect for others begin?  What criteria do you use in deciding 
who to respect and who not to respect?  And I'm not just talking about the 
people who own the property you deface, but the people who have to see what 
you write.

If this sounds like a flame...well, I guess it is...

In "honor" of the recent Lucky Charms fiasco , I thought I'd start a
new topic thread:

Signs Of A Bad Rave
 Some signs that might indicate that the rave may not turn out well:

1. Flyering and/or posters near intermediate and high schools.
2. Not so subtle drug references on promotional material.
3. Promotion material way before the event.
4. New or unknown promoters.
5. Size of promo material greater than an index card.
6. More than one DJ who is supposed to be playing somewhere else
   that night.
7. At least one DJ who's surprised at being listed to play!
8. Unintelligible phone message.

 The above is my opinion only , although others may agree with me. Any
one "sign" may not be the mark of doom , but a bunch together may be
a warning to forget this one! 

 Please add to the list !

Hats off to Leslie!!! Nothing makes me angrier than having to see someones 
scribble all over someone elses car, house, or whatever.  When I was last in 
Europe I took a picture of these Roman Ruins with tag marks all over them!  My 
only thought was that the people who did this didn't have any knowledge about 
their medium or respect for others who had yet to enjoy them.  This isn't the 
first time that this has happened at a rave and it won't be the last until we 
educate these people.  And please, don't tell me that taking these peoples pens 
or spray cans away will stifle their freedom of speech just their self declared 
freedom to masturbatorily scribble their names all over everything.

Hey everyone,

Nancy has seduced me out of hiding.

I've been listening in on SFRAVES for several weeks now and feeling a bit 
shy about joining in but here goes.

My name is Jess and I've been raving for just under a year.  Last spring 
I went to Nepal and India to trek and travel for 5 months (by myself!) 
before starting medical school in SF which is where I am now.  After 
month long trek in the himalayas I walked into this little trailside 
lodge to get a cup of tea and this amazing "dance" tape was playing.  I 
used to be the kind of person who would run screaming from a room if you 
played techno to me, but all of a sudden I found the music in my bones 
and I danced and danced. I spent another 4 months travelling with this 
overwhelming desire to dance and finally ended up in London (where I was 
raised) and hit the clubs (megatripolis etc..).  Sweet relief....ahhh

Since then I have returned to SF, have started medical school which takes 
up most of my time, and have tried desperately to find people to come 
raving with me.  Most of my school friends are way to busy and tired to 
come with me so I've only been able to make it out occasionally.  For the 
last two weeks I've had a friend from London staying with me and we've 
been out a lot (aborigine, pak-a-bowl, chrysalis etc..).  However, she 
left today and I'm back to having no raving partners (sob).


It's been great to plug into SFRAVES and maybe I'll be able to find new 
raving friends now.  Speak out if you'll adopt me!  I'm friendly and 
don't bite (usually!).

Two reservations:
First - I'm a recovering drug addict.  I've been clean and sober for 
almost nine years and it's really important for me to stay that way.  
Although I have no problem with others taking drugs, hanging out with 
people on e or acid can give me rightgeous cravings so I have to be 
careful to bring a drug and alcohol free friend with me to raves.  Are 
there any clean and sober types out there?  Or others whose main activity 
isn't the drugs.  Like I said, I have no problem with it from a moral 
standpoint but I need to keep my own head clear - ya know?  

Second - being a medical student, I have shitloads of work to do and 
SFRAVES is a pretty heavy load mailing list.  I'm worried that I won't be 
able to keep up with the time demands of the list.  I'd really like to 
meet some new rave partners on here though.  I guess I'll stay on for a 
while and see.

	Thanks again, Nancy, for the prompting to introduce myself.

	Hoping to get hooked up,


		Jess

Hi everyone,

went to chrysalis on saturday and although I dug the vibes and loved the 
space and great deco, I couldn't get into the music.

I tried really hard to get into dancing from about 12-2 and found the 
music to be way to ....  something.  I can't really explain.  I think of 
myself of a trance fan, and I couldn't put my finger on why I didn't like 
this music.  What was it?  Too a-melodic? fast? hard-housey?  Help!  I 
know it's silly to try to overcategorize music but sometimes it helps 
when you're trying to decide what events to go to. 

Any overcategorization appreciated.


	yours in academic servitude,

		Jess

 The vast majority of times at raves I'm not on anything illegal. ( I
may be in trouble if they outlaw caffiene, candy , or orange juice ).
So say "HI!" if you see me - I'm an older asian guy , about 5'7". 
Sometimes I wear red rimmed sports "raving" goggles , or glasses with
a safety strap to keep them on my head. The hair on my head that I
can see is black , with a few white hairs. I also have a little 
dark spot on the bridge of my nose . 

 Lots of folks rave without being on e or acid or ( drug of the month
here )!!!! Shocking , isn't it ?!!?

Yes it is. I found it even more shocking to discover that drinking alcohol
in California is not allowed after 2am. Although drinking/smoking is somewhat
of a taboo on this list, to me it seems that laws like this sort of force
people to use drugs to enjoy their evening to the fullest. Back in
Holland, friends who were not into drugs (or reacted bad to them) enjoyed
themselves thoroughly with the occasional whiskey or beer and still were
nice, smiling, talkative etc. till late. In California, these people get
somewhat bored/tired after 3am, no matter how good the music is, while their
chemically assisted buddies are still going strong until 7am. It doesn't
prevent them from partying though, albeit of shorter duration.
How the straight edge ravers here get by until early in the morning?

Perhaps I misused the word tagging or it means something different to you
and me. I don't mean putting my initials up on it. I mean reappropriating
the message.

No one has the right to cover every available space within my vision with
propoganda telling to buy buy buy either, but somebody sure does it. I don't
think this idea of "private property" is sacred either, unlike most Americans.
Mostly it is way that those on top (who mostly got there by stealing, killing,
and pillaging) keep their place. But _that_ is a discussion for another list.

I basically believe that forcing advertising on people is a profoundly 
disrespectful act. It is impossible for me to travel around, get to work,
go shopping, whatever, without being bombarded with advertising. I sure
don't have the resources to push my opinions on other people that way. But
more to the point, I wouldn't want that sort of power and would not use
it in that way even if I had it. I think creative vandalism is a very
powerful form of reappropriating a mind numbing technique and using it
to help people think. 

I am reminded of a famous billboard change. A new ad campaign came out
for Fiat(?) with the caption "If this car was a lady it would get pinched."
A "vandal" added "If this lady was a car, she would run you over." I think
this is great. What do you think? 

So yes, it all comes down to respect. Most advertisers have no respect
for us, they do not want to help make us think or make informed decisions,
they simply want to manipulate us and our desires. I think respect for 
ourselves and our fellow humans almost requires a response.

And in spite of what I just said about "private property", I would never
vandalize someone home or car or anything like that. I guess it is sort
of how I feel about most of societies rules. I think about them and if
they make sense to me, I obey them. If they make no sense I try to ignore
them. But when the rules are backed with jails and guns sometimes that is hard.

>And besides, most tagging is sincerely ugly. I for one don't want to have to

>cool some gangsta thinks his initials look, they're ugly.

Well, I think they're ugly too, but they also speak to the indominability of
the human spirit. And not everyone has our sense of aesthetics.

Well, so do I, so this might be an interesting discussion.

I agree with you about destroying other's property, but screwing with 
billboards can be truly subversive.  Have you ever picked up an issue of 
Adbusters (if not I suggest everyone check it out, seriously).  
It is a great magazine about the many evils of the ad industry.  
Extremely eye opening stuff, especially if you have never 
thought about the way ads affect your (or if not yours especially, 
other's) thinking and spending.  It tends to dwell on the big baddies 
like the cig and booze ads, but delves into the objectification of women 
in ads, as well as the unreal happiness of the american ideal.  A little 
subversive tagging of one of Philip Morris' 1,000s of ads is not going to 
hurt that giant, global, evil company, (too bad:) and it may do some good 
especially if it is done in a way that will make those who see it think 
for a second.   

just my .02

ps. not very rave related, huh?  Well, I had fun at Chrysalis in the chill 
room, way too hot for me to dance.  Hi to anyone I met!  Loved Joe's set, as 
usual. :)

You hit it on the spot! It was ... something :)

Maybe that's it, Jess. I too am tainted by trance. I'm so hard into it
that I get disappointed with other stuff so easily. I actually
prefered the chill room musically.

At the Golden Gate party on Saturday there was some music that I liked
very much from about 3 to 6pm ( the time I was there. ) Too bad the
sound system was broken. Was that Graeme ????? I think the guy had a
blue NY tee shirt on. All those baseball cap boys look the same to me.

> 		Jess

PS: Jess, I never do any drugs, or drink, or even talk to people. Just
dance and dig the music. I really love music.

PS: Nancy, I was one of the lurkers who said "hi NancY" to you at
Chrysylis. Actually, I don't think of myself as a lurker. I try to
contribute when I have some info or opinion. Only about music though.

>How the straight edge ravers here get by until early in the morning?



Those times I've done parties sober, I will usually have a cup of coffee or 
two before going out, and I've not yet had any problems keeping awake.  This 
is usually because the energy of the party is often so intense that I don't 
feel like I need food or sleep at all anyway!  I've experienced this several 
times, it's a stupendous feeling.  The energy just gets to me, imbues me with 
what feels like an unlimited supply of get-up-&-go!  So that's how I do it, 
anyway, don't know about others!  Maybe some take an hour off or so to nap in 
the middle of it in the chill room.

A lot of people get really surprised when they hear I go to parties
sober... I got stoned at a rave once, but it was no fun at all so I haven't
been to one *on* anything since... For some reason a lot of people I talk
to think that's really odd, since the "(stereo)typical" raver (a reasonably
accurate stereotype, from what I've seen --don't flame :) is into many of
the drugs that accompany the scene. I've never even *tried* e... not that
I'm totally against drug use, it just doesn't hold much attraction for
me...

So, what do y'all think? Do a lot of people party sober on a regular basis
or am I some kind of freek?

i go sober *alot*.  i think using certain chemicals as a spiritual tool or
if something happens to pop your way and it feels right that is cool but i
personally get WAY high on the music and i dance like a maniac!
personally, i've never been able to dance on 'you-know-what'...i prefer
hottubs and chill living rooms with ambient music...or sometimes  my
consciousness will be altered at a party and i spend the
time there guiding or being guided...it's all the same i guess!  do
whatever feels good to you!

I find that taking a couple capsules of Ginseng does wonders for the
past-midnight energy level. Caffeine works too, but I've always found it to
mess up my thinking a bit. I suppose you could always smoke tobacco... yick. :P

EXACTLY!!

One of the very many things I love about house/rave culture is that it is
not a bunch of slack mouthed people all facing one way staring at some
stage for an hour and then everyone go home.  It's about being yourself and
a place where EVERYONE is the show, not just some yahoo who got mega pr $$
through a record label. (see the quote about Keoki following.  For those of
you who don't know, super DJ Keoki slept his way to the top.  It was not
based on his talent, which people realize once they actually hear him live.
He was shagging the owner of the label.)

I do think it is important for DJs to get their names out because we want
to know the artists we identify with.  The music of the underground scene
is just as much about the DJs personality and style as it is about the
genre(trance, deephouse, progressive, etc.)  I just think it is sad when
some DJs and also club kids/ravers lose sight of that and bring that whole
"rock star" mentality to a scene it does not belong.

I know this is a basic repeat of what is said below, but I feel so strongly
about this, I just had to squak for a paragraph or two.

peace....arkay

techno sound, though overall a tad monotonous.  I particularly like the

I AGREE!!  And how COULD anyone pick THE BEST DJ IN AMERICA??  aside from 
the fact that it leaves out some of the big names from Europe .... 
certain djs are awesome for different reasons .... an awesome house dj 
might not be a very good ambient dj ... and vice versa.  And anyways i 
don't necessarily go to events for the DJ, although i'm more likely to go 
if i know someone i want to see will be there ... but if it's being put 
on by a bunch of money hungry promoters and the rest of the evening will 
suck, forget it.  The whole experience is what i like, NOT just the dj.

And if the DJ doesn't have a good happening crowd, what's the point of 
spinning?  isn't the whole fun of being a dj to mix and blend and play with 
beats and sounds and textures and watch how much fun everyone's having 
going off to them?  it much be SUCH a rush to see how much pleasure you 
can bring to the folk out dancing and grooving.  that's the sign of a good 
dj to me, is one who's having just as much fun spinning as i am dancing, 
NOT one who's trying to project some sort of demi-god image.

each dj has his or her strengths and weaknesses and it also depends on 
the style of music you like best ... someone who likes DJ Sneak 
may not like Jon Williams ... although they are both well-known, who's to 
say which one is better?

IMHO,

The author's name is Dudley Saunders -- perhaps you can do some kind of
search for that name (try alta vista off of http://www.search.com/ and
use the proper capitalization for a name) -- some of the early sfraves
archives are on the web so you should be able to get a search hit.

Then look at the date of the message and that should give you a pretty
good idea of the timeframe of that article ...

I quite frankly don't remember the dates, but vaguely recall that this
article was published in november-december-january-february-march
timeframe after that connection rave. Since I just moved and
undoubtedly threw away any nonessential paper encumberances, I doubt I
have that article any more.

I go stone cold sober often--half the time at least.  When I do indulge,
it's usually no more than some beer before things get started.

I am promoting a party.  This is my first one.  It has been very
enjoyable so far.  I think I like promoting.  I am excited to have
people come together and have a lot of fun.  Etc.

But there is one thing that worries me.  I have seen and heard of many
people going down due to drug abuse.  It is not the case that I am
against drugs.  I am sure they can be very nice :) And have positive
effects.  But some people overdo drugs; or let drugs take over their
lives.

Some think that house music and drugs go hand in hand.  Does that make
me, as a house promoter, directly or indirectly responsible for the
terrible effects that drugs can sometimes have on a person's life?
For when organizing a party I feel that I am, at least in some way,
responsible for the well-being of my guests.  I would feel terrible if
someone got hurt at my party.  Or if my party contributed to the
demise of their life.

Thanks and peace and love

I would like to add my .02 %..........I met Kioki once at the Gilligans 2
gig in La (about 4 years ago) and the first words out of his mouth
were........(i kid you not)....... 
 
HI, I'M KIOKI.....I'M GAY YOU KNOW......!!!!!!!! 
 
WHAT A POMPOUS ASS..........first of all, I don't go around stating
......I'm moonpup, I'm straight you know, or, do I have respect for a
person who anounces themseves followed by there own impression of them
selves.........(I'M SUPERSTAR DJ KEOKI) 
 
As far as I'm concerned, he could'nt spin his way out of a paper bag, I get
sick of frauds like this claiming to be the essence of the house
scene...........sorry but as long as people go to see a jerk like that
perform, the scene will have problems taking itself seriously as a world
wide movement..........I for example, may have never made the "A" list of
DJ's, but was always top of the "B" list........ 
 
.........I still can't believe that I have to go to the UK to be taken
seriously as a Proffesional DJ, and posse's like wicked etc.......have yet
to ever hire my ass once......(in 4 years).........I used to get
frustrated, and angry, and I self imploded, but now I just go with the
wind, and see what happens, I know I'm not Jeno, or Garth, or Thomas ,or
Markie, or Doc, etc........but I have rocked too many people to not know I
have a talent....don't get me wrong, I love the wicked DJ's MUSIC, in fact
I have been inspired many times over by the talents and tunes these boys
can play,  I just don't agree with there exclusionary politics. Unless THEY
deem you to be a SUPERSTAR DJ, who can bring $$$ accross the
door........(with all due respect to jeno, garth, thomas , and markie,
sorry guys, I had to say it.....) 
 
but I will never be SUPERSTAR DJ MOONPUP........yuk just the thought
alone.... .........cringes my nerves..............I hope to still be
considered one of the talents of our community, (hell, I'm going to the UK
to be considered a talent anywhere)....... 
 
San Francisco, (promoters especially)  I hope you are
listening.........treat up and coming talent with more
respect..........don't allow a Keoki to come in and be the
"superstar"..........I can list 20 NEW DJ's from the Bay area, who could
kick keoki's ass (musically speaking of course) 
 
Do I sound bitter ? probably........but if you get treated with no respect
by promoters in your own home base........and yet they pull out the red
carpet for a loser (yes I said loser) like keoki...........It makes you
wonder..........about all the love and PLUR we talk about...........aren't
we full of shit when superstars are amonst us......... 
 
by the way when I heard SUPERSTAR play, he was sloppy in the mix and rude
to boot 
 
I feel that all of the audiences (excluding the taggers) and all the
struggling Dj's and all the people who set up sound systems, and promote
with the right vibe in mind, as well as the people who create the
alters.....are the SUPERSTARS......I'm lucky to be invited.  
 
people like gateway systems, FnF, Santa Cruz Joint productions,
(raindance), even way back when.....wicked, new moon posse, sunsets,
etc.....these are the superstars.......no ego needed........or applied
for....... 
 
and Kioki if your listening.........check your butt at the door......say no
more..... 
 
(oh and practice a little more) if you want my
respect.........non-superstar dj moonpup.. ..........oh I'm special you
know.......#$%*(^^yuk%@#$^%&yuk%^(%^*&yuk%*&^%^*) 
remember without us the audience........KEOKI is  a nothing (as far as I'm
concered even with an audience, keoki is a no talent blaggard........)

I must say Chrysalis was a great party!  The dj's were great, especially   
James Dee.  I got there kinda early and was thinking i would be bored   
till later on when everything got moving...but it was great right from   
the start.  The chill room was probably one of the best ones i have seen   
in a LONG time....they did a great job!  The space was cool, but it felt   
like i was in a great huge sauna later on in the evening.......but all in   
all it was a great party.  Say, has anyone ever heard of James Dee?  I   
hope to see him at more parties...

Hello all,
I'm going out to Tucson for the "Toward a Science of Consciousness"
conference next week and I'm wondering if anyone else from the list is
planning on going or if anyone knows anything at all about fun things to do
in Tucson (a party would be ideal!).  I'm leaving  on friday...

peacelovejoy,

David

it was an interesting night for me, a little different introspective
experience than I've had before, so this is a little random . . .

i'll always have a soft spot for chrysalis since it was my first back in
December, but they never fail to blow me away with their total
transformation of their space.  the very high ceilings allowed for some
trippy visuals, the ambient/chill room soothed and beguiled as always, and
the place -- way too nice to be disrespected by tagging -- was made for
loud music and dancing.

the kaleidoscope was joined by an identical cousin (courtesy of a
non(pre?)-rave friend) and a new red space tube -- thank you marty for
taking good care of it during my wanderings : )

after my self-reflective period, i was brought back to earth by some nice
hugs, and then I surfed my second wave until sunrise.  i found my legs in
the last half-hour, and the music at the end, with the sunlight filtering
through (very early, time for daylight savings this weekend! spring forward
and enjoy!) was enervating.  There was a great vibe when the music stopped,
the wall-coverings were thrown down, the sunlight streamed in, and everyone
cheered and clapped.  I had to wait to drive some people, and cleaned up
and hung around for at least a half-hour after, not ready to leave.

[New theory for "rave drek" -- sticky wet event fliers!  When a pile gets
soaked with smoothies, it leaves this bizarre grey residue.  And IF YOU
CHEW GUM, PUT IT IN PAPER AND THROW IT OUT! ]

there were so many of you who i met that listing (and remembering) all the
names is futile -- just thank you all!

I'm probably going to lay fairly low next weekend and save my energy for
Harmony -- see you there  = )

                        GENERATION OV NOISE
                          TEKNIVAL USA '96

The ever growing world of death culture is catching up with us and the time
for exodus is soon.

The only way to grow is to expand beyond the boundaries of what we know
into the uncharted areas of the unknown.  The unknown being the only source
of new knowledge.  Our life support systems on this planet are organic.  To
regenerate cell walls, divide and multiply - old barriers fall away, ancient
pillars crumble and new structures stand up in their turn.  One generation
gives birth to the next.  The old gives life to the new.  We live in the ever
transitional moment connecting past through present to future.  It is our
mission to discover the ever changing horizon.  To continually re-establish
new parameters and to explore and secure each new level as we find it.  It is
our purpose to destroy the inertia that has been responsible for the demise of
our lifeforce on our Planet.  It is time to wake the Planet UP!
We - The Generation ov Noise - using technology, combined with organic life
systems deliver a massive jolt to Human sensory circuits, providing the extra
energy input needed to make the Quantum leap from Terrestial Consciousness
to Extra Terrestrial Consciousness.
(Taken in part from spiral tribe 23 "techno terra" ...Modified for G.O.N.)

Havoc and Mayhem shall occur on American soil in '96... This is a call to all
sound systems and people to come and annihilate the land of the so called
"free"...
We request your presence, attendance and participation in the travelling free
festival.  All are welcome and none shall be turned down.  The states are in
need of some TRUE anarchy and chaos...there are 9 dates being planned out...all
sound systems, DJs, bands, vehicles, firstaid, mobile kitchens, hackers,
promoters, live acts, vendors, and general PEOPLE POWER are requested...
no egos, just one huge agGrow tribe, we need your help to create a fire in the
american underground.

            NO COMPROMISE -- NO COMPROMISE -- NO COMPROMISE

YES we could spend more time trying to secure the neccesary permits and
going thru the proper channels and avoiding unpleasant friction - but this
would only dilute the required intensity and vibrational quality of our
gatherings - the only permit we need to gather is the First Amendment to
the United States Constitution.  We know what we are doing - We know how
it needs to be done.  Our so called "leaders" and  "authorities" have had their
chance and have basically failed to impress.  We have the  knowledge.  We
have the resources.  We are now taking control of our destiny and will accept
nothing less.  We are tired of clueless, powermad control freaks wasting our
time.  We are a true and Positive Life Culture --- The Death Culture seeks to
repress us because we threaten it's existence and power structure.  It's time
to establish our rightful place on this planet.

----------------------NO COMPROMISE--------------------------------

OUR GOALS

FREE THE LAND...
The vast plains, forests, and other wildlife areas are being
Hoarded by dominating and selfish individuals and groups
who have little interest in the health and well being of our
habitat, as well as the habitat of other living beings.  We
have every right to reclaim and commune with our Mother
Earth...     NO COMPROMISE!

FREE OUR MINDS...
We respect no "authority" which attemps to regulate our
state of consciousness.  We will alter our minds in any way
we see fit at any time with any plant, substance, dance or
meditation that we choose...   NO COMPROMISE!

FREE OUR PARTIES...
Our Gatherings are sacred to us.  NO individual or group
will insult or disrespect us by disturbing or attempting
to control our parties.  Our parties are spiritual...
NOT commercial.

FREE OUR FREEDOMS...
The ridiculous and unreasonable laws that are attempting
to control our movements and basic human rights are
disrespectful to us -- their sole purpose is to alienate
us from one another -- We will show no respect to those
laws or anyone attempting to enforce them...
NO COMPROMISE!

OUR TOOLS FOR CHANGE ARE  --MUSIC--DANCE--LOVE--MAGIK--

THE COMMITMENT ONE MUST TAKE TO SERVE THIS EXCURSION
INTO FREEDOM AND CHAOS

  1.  THEE JOB...
       Stop thinking about it...DO IT! Quit your job.  Quit your life -
       start anew... You must undertake this death of your responsibility
       to the system.  You can not take part in the system and survive this
       trip at the same time.. To endure this mission you must drop out of
       their way to form your own...NO COMPROMISE!

  2.  THEE MENTAL STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS...
       To control your freedom to ingest chaotic chemistry you must know
       when not to over indulge and when to blow your mind.  You must know
       the times to do and not to do.  You must at all times know how to take
       care of yourself and others.

  3.  THEE INDIVIDUAL...
       There are none.  This is a synergy of many.  This has to be a close knit
       family.  Everyone must come prepared to take care of themselves, and
       be prepared to take care of others.  Everyone is a Family.

  4.  THEE COMMERCE...
       If you want to spend money and make money, then barter, sell, trade on
       your own accord.  If you are a vendor selling food...It is advised that
       you give some of your wares to those who are needy.

Jim,

        Again I find myself in agreement with you.  Our prehistoric
ancestors didn't have the possessive concerns that contaminate modern
societies.  The indigenous people of this hemisphere pretty much believed
in owning just what you can carry (and maybe some horses), and similarly
weren't that concerned with private property, especially areas of land.
The great power which created this world on which we live made us
custodians, not overlords.  More people need to share a vision similar to
ours, that it is better for a greater number of people to share rather than
to keep some things from others.  I felt it sufficiently relevant to post
this to the whole list, as I encourage everyone's feedback.

As long as it harm no one, do what you will!

That's it!  Pure VIBE!!!  I haven't tried it yet, but at some point I'm
going to experience a party and let the vibe itself sustain me.  I fully
expect it to be a warm, surreal, and fun sensation, surely enough to
inspire dancing feet, embracing arms, and a smiling face :)  I know I can't
depend on caffeine, because it hardly ever affects me noticeably, except to
make my heart do some pretty frightening things :O

You know it, Bren!  I can hardly contain myself, and it's such a joy to be

The way I see it, Sasa, as the host, you should be concerned for the
guests' well-being, but you're not expected to personally take care of
everyone.  It just can't be done.  You are not responsible for what people
choose to do to themselves.  Ostensibly, the party is a dance, so how are
you to know whether people are sitting around playing cards or shooting
heroin?  The music stands for itself, and doesn't go hand-in-hand with
drugs any more than any other form of music (I've been to Grateful Dead
shows and been sober the whole time...and had a blast, I might add!).  Just
do what you can to make sure the best kind of a good time is extended to
all.  That's what it's all about, right?

Peace and good luck to you,

Alright, as long as we're all posting intros, I may as well step up to the
mic.  I've been lurking on the list all of four or five days now, but I'm
certainly no stranger to this whole thing.  I just moved out to San Francisco
from Washington DC about five months ago and have been totally enjoying the
party scene here, which I knew I would.  Some of you may remember me on the
net
from my old (still functional) email address, inhuman@mindvox.phantom.com.  I
used to do the weekly calendar for NE-Raves back in the day, about two and a
half years ago.  And I've even popped into San Francisco a couple of times
over
the past few years, even luckily falling into attendance at Connection II.  So
I know I've met some of you old timers before, but I've hardly met any
sfravers
since I've officially moved here.

If any of you are planning on coming to that Sunday night thing at Cafe Abir
(Divis & Fulton) that Joe Rice posted about, look for me, because I live right
across the street and I certainly plan on being there every Sunday.  I'm short
with short brown hair and fly clothes.  ;)  Anyway, maybe I'll meet some of
you
at those structured sf-raves events.

Major problems with the sound.   Too much dust,  whatever,  so it kept
getting cut-off and attempts to "patch" it failed,  but I commend those
working on it for keeping the tunes going while working on it.

Aww Moonpup, quit feelin' sorry for yerself dood!  I have here the instant
road to Supahstah DJ success for ya, and it ain't gonna cost ya one thin
dime.  SO -- consider the price of the advice, check yer self-respect at
the door, and MOON the audience at the beginning, middle and end of each
set, and soon you too will be rising the ranks of the Supahstah DJs.
Everyone's gotta have a gimmick to make it big on the scene.  Like
Sven Vath's haircut, your heiney will soon be on the cover of every slick
DJ rag this side of the English Channel.  Punters will crowd to the
front to see the show so much they will build bleachers around the
turntables just for your set!  Soon, you'll be featured at Wembley and
the Love Parade with Pink Floyd show-sized screens for the cheap seaters!
Keoki will fight back by painting his hindside dayglo colors to match
his hair but it won't matter!!  You'll be the pioneer!!!  Come see
Supahstah DJ MOON Pup!!!!  Rekkids?  Mewzik?  Who cares??!!!  You could
mix Donny & Marie into frog fart noises, for all the crowd cares . . . 
just don't forget to give 'em a SHOW!!!!!

I just thought that I'd add something interesting to this topic.  

Grafitti is an old and historic occurance.  When I was in my high school 
Latin class, I did a project on Roman grafitti.  Some of what they know 
today about Latin came from ancient grafitti written on walls. 

Anyway, the mention of Roman ruins below made me remember my project.  

I *don't*, however, appreciate or condone disrespecting others' property 
and I find tagging ridiculous.

I like to party sober and let the music carry me away.  Since my 
biological rhythm is not entrained to staying up all night, I often get 
tired.  To remedy this I either 1) go home early 2)take ma huang (herbal 
energy) or 3) sleep for a bit and then go hard once again.  I have been 
raving on such an irregular basis as of late, but when I was going out a 
bit more I found that with my increased knowledge and enjoyment of the 
music I could use the music as my "upper" and was not tired.  There is a 
bit of "mind-over-matter" too.  If I think I am going to be tired, I will 
be.  But, if I don't think about it and think that I am not tired, I am 
usually not.

Raving sober is a dear topic to me because I've seen too many of my 
friends focusing on the drugs.  I am not trying to be self-righteous 
because I don't think that drugs are inherently bad, nor do I consider 
myself ignorant to their attraction.

The United States is a drug culture.  It has and will be.  Drugs are 
symbolic with the fast-life.  Their allure is strong.  Not only do I 
think that ppl *shouldn't* limit themselves to amazing mind-opening 
experiences that some drugs offer, nor do I think that they should be the 
only gate to these experiences.  Nor do I think they are a good remedy 
for "fitting-in" or improving your self esteem (alcohol is a good example 
of this).  

Anyway, I will cut this off right now as I see myself moving farther and 
farther away from the rave-relatedness of this topic.  

chau,

Hi everyone,

I have had such a tremendously loving batch of replys to my intro and 
plea for drug-free freakazoid rave partners.  I want to thank all of you 
for letting me know that I'm not alone.

I can be cynical sometimes about PLUR. I used to hang out in the grateful 
dead scene when I was into psychedelics (don't laugh, raves had hardly 
been invented back then!) and there was much talk of PLUR etc... I 
personally found people to be rather cliquey and quite indifferent to 
newbies or others who weren't part of their "family".  I must say that 
the incredibly positive and supportive responses to my intro message have 
restored some of my faith in PLUR - concepts on which I base my every 
waking hour and which found much of my motivation to study medicine.

So thank you all for your vibrant welcome.

I'll post an e-mail when I want to go out so one of you can be my 
designated support person and introducer for the evening, then I should 
be launched.


Love,   Jess

Yes, the promoter who took my $30 handed one of the Lyon securities gaurds
$10 of it.  I know it was a Lyon gaurd, because I remebered him from several
other parties, and used to have respect for him...

I always ask this every month becuase when I call Bahia, they just
don't know...

Is Body Electro going on at Bahia Cabana again Wednesday night ( April
3rd)? I seem to remember seeing somewhere that Freaky Chakra is
playing, but I can't find that info now.

Anyone know the line up???

Last month it was Ecstatic minds ( filter sweeps and a well rosined
bow go together very nicely), Planet 6 (ever smooth, dancable, and
inovative, especially for just playing a bunch of cheap calculators
and a flute :) ), Turbo Ted (gets you all stirred up like a loose
tennis shoe in the dryer), and simone 3rd arm ( is shaking hands
appropriate for this culture? ).

Thanks,

9.  At the map point, they give you directions to a 2nd map point.
10.  The background music for the voicemail is a Moby song.
11.  They describe their location as a "A clean, comfortable location
     with it's own sound system.... in Palo Alto."
12.  Nobody has said anything about it on sfraves.
13.  The line for the guest list is longer than the line for ticket holders.
14.  When you arrive at the remote, outdoor location, you see a lot of
     Confederate flags and kids with short haircuts and orange-lined jackets
     who keep telling your African-American and Asian friends "You know,
     I had a grandfather who faught in WWII, he was on the German side."
     (that could NEVER happen!)
15.  One word:  Ticketmaster.

actually, the first rave i ever went to was a big event in Toronto. Apart
from being a little too large to meet anyone, it had a really great vibe and
good djs. The security was very good, and the best part - Orbital "played"
live. And tickets were sold at Ticketmaster.

i suppose there are exceptions to every rule.

cool... I tried to get into the last one, but my friend and I came too
late, and we waited in that horrid line until our feet hurt and we decided
it wasn't worth it... I was sitting there calculating how many $/hr of
raving it would cost me as time ticked by. :)

Not only will I most likely never go to another Tribal Funk, but I advise
everyone not to go.  It's getting to be one of those big production numbers
we've been talking about.  It's kind of sad, because the first one I went
to, at the Cow Palace, was wonderful (anyone remember the cat lady and the
cat man?).  The second one, advertised as an evening of "Nothin' but Love",
was weird, and the few friends I found there didn't enjoy it much.  The one
high point was when two djs (was it Garth or Donald Glaude, or someone
else?) spun on two turntables EACH!  That was cool, but the rest of the
party didn't do much for me, and I tried, Lord how I tried!
If you're really hot to go, then I say go, but cautiously, with no
expectations, and just experience it as you will.  If you enjoy it, great!
I want to hear about it.  But if you don't, learn the lesson and avoid
Tribal Funk.
I missed the most recent one (a while back), but friends went, and didn't
like it, so among some of us, it's unanimous...

$.02 and more,

YES!  It's perfect!  It's simple yet controversial, eye-catching with just a 
touch of the rebel.  And it's how you got your name anyway, isn't it?  
You're already an expert.  You've probably got mooning positions and

Hey,  I think I'll take this opp to drop a line as to who I am...  Yes, Yes, I am a 
"lurker" ... but most newbies are ...
My name is Dave and I'm a MS NT Administrator at a local Milpitas company... I've only 
been to one Rave, but damn that was the time!!! Problem is living in the south bay and 
heading north for all the parties.....  Hopefully I'll get to some more... Anyways, 
the big 2 5 birthday is coming up .... so I've better get with the scene before I'm 
too old to stay up all night ... 

Since we're doing a "lurker rousting",  let's get some of you vets out there to help 
bring us newbies into the "group" .. I for one definately need some help in getting a 
clue ... So step up and make yourself REALLY useful!!

Dave

Just for the record:  I've got three beautiful (see for yourself . . . attached
gif.) tree frogs, and to the best of my knowledge they don't fart.  ;)

Something that seems to be a recurring theme is having the map point at Your 
Mama's Cafe.  So far, they're two for two.  Lucky Charms, and a party I went to 
a while ago that was by far the worst rave I've ever been to!  Guess out of 
superstition I'll stay away from parties where the map point's at Your Mama's 
Cafe!

Is this what you do with your spare time, hold frog butts up to the side of your 
head for long periods of time in hopes that they will emit various bodily gasses 
for you??

I just got the best rave item in the world - a camelbak. It's a small
backpack that contains water, with a tube that leads out to your mouth, for
those who haven't heard of them.
I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to interrupt their trance on the
dance floor to go get more water.. :)

This will now be my defining attire. If you see me with my camelbak, please
come up and say hi! I'll tell you lots of stories about the great white
north.. ;)

and speaking of the desert, how many people are planning on going to Burning
Man this year? I'm dying to go (my first time),, Let's organize a big
caravan out!

hello-
  I've been pulled through the lurking glass a few times in the year that 
I've been on the list.  Nonetheless, I am reintroducing myself.

  I am a student at UC Davis, and time and distance have prevented me from 
frequent SFRaving.  I rave mostly free of controlled substances, but have 
had many positive experiences in many different states of awareness.  As 
far as going till morning is concerned, I rather enjoy napping at 140 bpm 
(the 2.3 Hz frequency approaches that observed in the brain during slow-wave 
sleep).  

  Since I'm done with classes this quarter I hope to y'all a bit more now.

cheers!  -alberT

hey...

well i've been lurking for quite a while, maybe a year, i guess i've posted
a few times in there, but i mostly subbed for the calendar and deleted 
the rest, mostly.  i'm 22, live in berkeley, moved to cali a year and
a half ago to try to land a tech job while i finished school...ended up
getting a good job and so now am trying to find the time to finish my
bachelors.  

i'd never been to a rave till i moved out to the bay area, although i knew
i wanted to, i didn't live anywhere conducive to throwing a good one :)
i still hadn't been to many until fairly recently, but i am digging the scene
more and more as time goes on.. had my best experience yet last saturday
at chrysalis, it completely (well and the L) blew my mind.  i had been 
planning to go with a friend but was flaked on at the last minute, so i
decided not to waste my $dozen and went alone.  i liked the music at
chrysalis more than any other rave i'd been to, can anyone help with 
telling me what you'd classify it as?  whatever you'd call it, i couldn't
help but dance till i thought i'd drop, rest a while watching the fine
visuals then do it all again...  the vibe was just incredible, so many 
smiles and introductions...  oh, by the way, a description might be 
helpful, in case i met any of you, i have long brown hair, a stud in me
nose, was wearing a trippy white-ish long sleeve shirt with an even 
stranger tshirt underneath.  

i rilly hope to meat more sf-ravers next time...until then !

Speaking of the full moon...tomorrow night there is a total lunar eclipse
visible in entirety to humans living in most of Africa, Europe, a bit of 
Greenland, and a bit of South America..also a bit of the Middle East.
Here in Pacific Standard Time, the moon will rise while leaving the 
penumbra stage of the eclipse..  What a dance...the Sun, Earth and 
Moon....!  --Maureen

I've been away from the list for a long time, so I thought I'd re-introduce
myself, since I scarcely recognize any of the names I see posting anymore,
and I'd love to get to know those of you I missed in my absence!

I've been raving since high school in Santa Barbara, and when I moved up
to Santa Cruz to come to school, I was amazed at the wonderful vibe and
acceptance I found among sfravers and scruz geeks alike. I started on 
sfraves sometime in 1993, when I went to my first Friends and Family, 
which was small enough then to be held in a friend's garage...  I spent
practically every weekend after that at a different party for almost the
next two years!  There was nothing that made me more excited than hearing
the dim whoom whoom whoom when I knew I was getting close to a good party.

This June, for reasons I'm still not sure of, I decided it would be a
really good idea to move to Chicago.  I got a job, a great apartment, a
boyfriend (someone I'd actually met at a halloween f&f!) and settled into
my new place in Chicago.  I even went to a couple parties out there, which
were fun, but somehow lacking in the same wonderful giving vibe I've always
found here.  After three months, I came back and decided it was time to
seriously work on finishing my biochem degree from ucsc.  That's where I've
been ever since, and I just haven't found the time lately to go out on
weekends... that pre-med thing, you know.

This Saturday was my last weekend of spring break, and I decided I *HAD* to
get out, go somewhere, DANCE, SMILE, anything!  I made a beeline for
Organic in the park, and as soon as I came upon that crowd of *beaming*
dancing funky dusty bouncing ravers I knew I was home.  I can't believe
I had forgotten what kind of energy that could give me.  Anyway, I'm back,
and hopefully back for good.  It's so great to see how the extended family 
has gotten bigger, even in the few (very very long) months I was gone!  I 
can't wait to see new smiles and new faces.

love

kia

And I too will have a soft spot because Chrysalis was my first "small"

(even those who were not very friendly...not you Shawna :P )

YES!  This was also the first time I ever spent time in the chill room.  
I'm usually a dancing fool in the other room but it was way too hot.  
This lounging around made for a whole new experience...espcially with 
Leslie and her pipe next to me :)  Oh my.....what a night!

Ny pleasure Jonathon.  I really enjoyed looking though it.  Isn't it amzaing 
how certain toys take on a whole new meaning at these events?  I brought 
Floam and everyone loved it.  We are so easily satisfied these days!  And 
I'm so glad everyone liked the "rave blanket".  It's become a welcome treat 
at the parties I have been to.

I ditto that :)
Don't know when I can make it up again to see all of you.  I'm hoping to 
come for Harmony, but right now I'm scheduled to work. 
We'll see.....

Biiiigggg Huuuug,
Marty

i know this is kind of an old thread and im sorry if im floggin...but ,it
has to be done...

society raises girls not to be outwardly competetive in the same way boys
are...not to say they don't compete but it is in a different way....not
only is djing nearly all male...(daunting to begin with...but the
competition for gigs is very stiff...something which most girls, including
myself, aren't used to or raised to half to deal with....this explains a
lot of things..why there aren't more girls in rock bands, dj's, and why
women have a lot of trouble in the corporate world...i think this factor is
even stronger than the discrimination that exists in these sorts of
fields...this is speaking as a possible sociology major although being a
girl dj just reinforces what i've learned...isn't an education wonderful?

	I don't really think it the responsiblity of promoters to have to
remind each and everyone one of us that we shouldn't smear stuff/scratch
tags into the mirrors. There were a lot of younger people at there that
didn't have a clue to what they were doing (for whatever reason), and most
likely a large group of aged people as well (though they were not as
visible). One group of circle dancing girls who who mow down people as
their circle roamed around the dancefloor, one girl who flipped out on
someone asking for a drink of her water then strutting away with her
enterauge <spelling?>. There were a lot of younger people that were really
cool and respected the place and the other people with them.
	While the organizers might want to provide an environment in which
people can grow and a community can form, I don't think it is the place
for the promoters to have to put such signs up, if anything that removes
the requirement for people to stay responsible for themselves and their
actions even when high (a state which some people use as an excuse for
their actions which in turn makes people start talking about how drugs
make people fake and delusional).

	Bringing the fact that people must be responsible for their own 
actions has been a side issue with a few organizers (especially those 
that are throwing camping parties/festis as far as I have seen) and it is 
not an easy thing to do without being overbearing, preachy, or putting 
someone into a defensive mode where they aren't going to listen to what 
you have to say. At the end of the day, the way the space is left will 
have some impact on future parties, whether it be the cost of renting 
the venue (for indoor parties), the willingness of park rangers to 
let outdoor parties go on, or just the general image that raves have 
to people (not just people outside the raving community but to those 
people inside the rave community that look at parties like the last 
Sunset and wonder whether they can be a part of a community that 
leaves a carpet of cigarette butts when they leave).

bagok tribe? lucky charms... let me say that they have been put on my 
RAVE blacklist and boycott list... Saturday night was a fantastic display 
of how the 'scene' here has changed for the worse and how greed blatantly 
ruled the day...
me and my buddies get to the map point 'Your Mama's Cafe' around 11p... 
we see a line of about 600 - 700 people... my initial thoughts 
were..'COOL...they moved the rave here... now where is the 20,000 sq ft 
virgin location'. It was only then, we realized that this was the MAP 
POINT! we had initially planned to go to chrysalis, but then decided to 
try a 'massive'... hoping that 'lucky charms' would be similar to 'the 
gathering'... boy were we WRONG!!! so we decide to line up... the crowd 
was getting restless because the line was not moving... after an hour or 
so...(yeah..we should have left) we hear someone shouting ..PUSH PUSH 
PUSH... some of us rushed to the front to find that the 'door' has been 
broken down...and some  'idiot' was standing on a chair inciting the 
crowd by telling them to push... of course there were a LOT of 'gangsta' 
types who decided to 'blindly' follow this moron and pushed... i believe 
a lot of people were crushed... then the organizers give up and throw 
what appeared to be tickets in the air... everyone of course goes wild 
and people are scrambling everywhere.. some people fall, a buddy of mine 
is pushed from behind..he falls and someone steps on his hand...hard. 
thank god it didn't break. the cops come soon later and the crowd 
disperses... the 'tickets' turn out to be jsut directions.
we rush to the 'inline skating rink' and manage to get to the front of 
the line... and even then, we are made to wait... the obviously INEPT 
gaurds try to make everyone form a line, and we kinda do..but by then, 
the crowd keeps swelling. other gaurds come and they seem to think that 
it was all in fun... there was NO crowd control... NO boundaries marked 
out whatsoever..and only 2 gaurds to pat down about 1000 people freezing 
in the cold who ahd been lining up for an hour or so at 'your mama's 
cafe'!! needless to say people were NOT in a good mood... we manage to 
get in... and sad to say..there was NO VIBE whatsover... just a lot of 
gangsta rapper types walking around trying to look cool... we got in the 
middle of 'tony's' set... but after half an hour, the music is turned off 
and some guy comes on the mike and says that there is a riot 
outside...and he wanted everyone to be cool...the lights go on and people 
get pissed... some of the 'smarter' kids start hitting the sides of the 
skate rink in unison to make noise... (i did NOT have a good feeling 
about it then) thank god the music started after another 30 mins or so... 
i couldn't really get into the vibe later that night... too bad.
i meet some people who told me they were 'forced' to pay $30 to get 
in...and that the gaurds wanted the extra $10 to 'risk' letting them 
in!!! HOW COULD YOU HOLD SOMEONE HOSTAGE FOR HAVING FUN?? that REALLY put 
a damper on our night... we left around 5am..sorely dissapointed and 
DISGUSTED!!! my feelings are..
1) the promoter kept blaming the people for causing the problems, but he 
should have know that this was a massive and to have enough UNCORRUPT 
security to handle the crowd problems if any.. 
2) how could you possibly have a map point at a tiny place for a 
gazillion people? if someone had gotten hurt in the stampede there, the 
whole scene would be jeapordised!!! and other promoters that are decent 
and looking out for us would be blamed too..
3) with the 'type' of people expected, the promoter should have beefed up 
security..and i repeat..UNCORRUPT security
4) Bagok tribe needs to come out with a personal apology for what happened.
5) The Security Company people who asked for a $10 bribe to let people in 
should be revealed to everyone on this group and boycotted... lets make 
sure that they are not used at other raves.

WELL, i've let off some steam and i feel better now... the only saving 
grace that saturday was the ORGANIC party in the GG park... NOW that was 
AWESOME... well i guess you can't have it all huh?

	Then look at festis like Ashton Court Festival anbd this little 
one called the First Faire which is pretty small but more than one person 
I know still says it had been the best party to which they have ever 
gone. There is a lifestyle to match, the crusty soap-dodging 
travellers. Whether or not there are going to commerical parties (hmmm, 
let us look at Cool World, Funky Techno Tribe, and to an extent Martin's 
parties) does not have much bearing on what might or might not happen to 
the more underground parties that happen in this city. Just depends on how 
the people involved feel about what they are doing and why they doing 
it... If you don't like how things are going, find people who agree with 
you and have some type of network to find or buy sound equipment, lasers, 
and lights (or if you're network is good, you might be able to get away 
with just a nice sound system) and throw a party or two the way you would 
like to see one thrown. The most important part is building some type of 
network that will draw the people that will support the vibe you wish to 
have at the space where you lug the system to (or if you working with a 
strong community behind you, they might help you lug the system to the 
spot where it is going to be set up)...

Hi there....

I'm not a regular sf-raver, but I have followed sf-raves since it was 
conceived back in 92.....  

I've spent the last two days browsing Hyperreal, old sf-raves archives, 
and the like...Ya know, living this life day in and day out, we (the 
net-rave community at large) are aware of who we are, what we're about, 
our potential as a community....but it's only when you take a moment to 
step outside yourself and look at us from an outsiders perspective that 
you really get just a purely overwhelming feeling of positivity, energy, 
community, nurturing, connection, togetherness, and, of course, peace, 
love, unity, respect.

Yesterday I was reviewing the Spirit of Raves archive *all-at-once*, and 
by the end of it, as I said in an email message to Lee, I was sitting 
there physically *throbbing* from the overwhelming sense of Goodness.  

I encourage all of you to take a moment to do this.  I know we all 
spread plur on a daily basis, but, even if you were the source of all 
plur energy everywhere, you can still find something new to expand your 
consciousness by taking an hour or two out of your life to look over 
net-rave archives....the testimonials, the essays and accounts, the 
posts from the local lists.....it helps bring together our past, 
present, and potential future in a way that's capable of transforming 
your soul.  

Most importantly I wanted to send my love to those of you, the old 
skool, who have been the foundation of sf-raves and the larger net-rave 
community the past 5 years.  Your contributions to the world, to 
humankind, have been vital in creating and expanding cultures, in 
changing people's lives at the very root of their definition of self, in 
making the world a truly better place.  Take a moment to think about all 
that you have shared and brought to the world as a net-raver, all the 
parties, all the people you've met and shared experiences with, all the 
conversations on the lists from spiritual evolution on down to "can 
anyone give me a ride?"  Think about all the hugs and all the laughs...
It may take a week or two to really think about all those memories, but 
just do it.  It'll change you.

Net-ravers stand out in my mind, and many others I know, as the most 
beautiful examples of what it is to be human.  Thank you.

And this message couldn't be complete without a simple, deeply heartfelt 
"props to Brian."  Brian has been somewhat of an idol of mine for I 
guess 4 years now. I don't like to put people on pedestals like that -- 
we are all the same -- but I feel Brian really deserves it for giving 
birth to this new global community and culture of net-ravers.  Someday I 
will meet and hug this man who's changed my life for the better.  

Thanks for listening. I hope you all have a beautiful day.  Smile and 
pass it on.
     
With deepest love and respect,

Andy Hawks

That seems a bit hasty, the map-point for basics a couple weeks back was
at your mama's...

It's a cool place too, it's not their fault certain promoters don't know
what they're doing.  But I would think after what went down last weekend
they're going to be more careful about being used as a map-point...

Hey guys.

I need some advice. I have a male friend, an e dealer and 
ex-boyfriend, who needs help. Now I don't know what constant 
use of e can do to your system, but he does this at least 
twice a week. And not only does he do this, but he does a lot 
at a time. He has a high tollerance for it, but I don't think 
taking 10 hits is cool. Last night he called my friends, 
Michelle and Jules, at 5am to ask them for their 2 hits of e, 
that he had GIVEN them this last weekend. He was so desperate 
for more.....I don't understand.

I am really worried about him. He's a good friend and I don't 
want anything to happen to him. 

In need of help or advice,
amyp

Amy,

        The most common word is that e drains spinal fluid (!!!).  It makes
most people very ill if they take more than one at once.  Because it's
often cut with speed, it strains the heart and increases blood pressure,
also straining veins/arteries/capillaries.  A friend of mine was told that
a guy took a hit of e that was a little old, and it paralyzed him.
        My opinion is that it's best to space multiple hits out by AT LEAST
three and a half hours, and to do no more than three in a twelve-hour
period.  It's also highly advisable to wait at least a few days till taking
it again, but more like a week (funny how this all fits in with weekend
party schedules, eh?).  The body needs time to recover from each
Experience.
        Your friend will be in for a world of harm if he remains on his
present course, especially because of various side-effects that hit the
different systems of the body.  I hope he'll change his ways and stay with
us (and retain his friends!).
        I hope others on this list will elaborate/correct me on all of this.

Peace and concern,

- E

Hello??  When talking about such an important subject, if you don't
have definitive facts you should not spread info you "kind of" know.
"A friend of mine was told that a guy...."  C'mon, eric... it is silly
to take this kind of third hand information seriously.

"Drains spinal fluid"....  A myth as far as I know... no medical research
has backed this up.  I think this rumor was started becuase to do 
research on the effects of MDMA, spinal taps are often involved.  "Very
Ill if they take it more than once"... again, this is pretty meaningless.

This is a very important subject, and if you don't know what you are
talking about, you should leave the discussion to those that do.

nothing personal, eric... just trying to keep fact strieght and accurate.

OK, thanks.  That's why I asked for correction.  I imparted all the most
common feedback that I've gotten on this subject, hoping that meant that it
was all based on some kernel of truth.  From everything I've read, no one
knows anything definitive, but at least I wasn't wildly speculating.  As
far as people taking more than one at a time, everyone I know who's done
this has vomited, and had more an unpleasant experience than a pleasant
one.
I could have said "There's nothing wrong; let your friend do what he
wants," but my nature demands that I offer whatever I can, however tenuous.
Do you have anything to share, Dr. Sheets?  :)
I will now invalidate everything I've said by saying that I've never read
any published studies/findings on the use of MDMA.
So, am I a clueless idiot?

Always hungry for knowledge,

You definatley have me to back you up on the claim of the Gathering being 
a good massive.  I've attended every single Gathering sincince NYE 
1992/93 (my very first Gathering and rave in general!) Hell, I even 
passed up a Friends and Family rave back in Dec. 1994 so I could make it 
to the 3 Year Anniversary.  The dj line up looks really exciting, too! 

Does anyone know if this rave will have donations for a discount like 
they did in December?  Nothing was mentioned at their homepage or on the 
calander.

Who else on this list is planning on going?  Don't know of much else 
besides Wicked that is happening. Its going to be a mighty fun weekend 
and the week is *already* half way over (ever heard the phrase "Wednesday 
is Hump day"?  It always makes me giggle!:)

love,
Amy

just like all the rumours about lsd, i think it's probably best to ignore
the ones about e. however, you should be truly concerned about e being cut
with shit that isn't e. the dealer probably doesn't even know what it's been
cut with. be careful, some people sell drugs for maximum profits without
caring about quality.

spacing it out sounds like a good idea. as with any drug, too much at once
can be bad for you. i believe i read that e tends to hang around in your
sytem for about 10 days, so if you try any more in that perioid, you'll have
to take even more to compensate for drug resistance.

well.. i hope i'm not contributing to rumour-mongering here. i've read all
this from what seemed to be fairly reliable sources, although my memory
could be less reliable and muddled up some stuff.. <g>  The Netherlands has
a government drug information page with a lot of good info on it. Everyone
should check it out. Lost the URL though. sorry.

take care of yourselves.

I even think that doing it once a week is a bit excessive!!
Moderation is the key and most of us know our personal limits and respect 
them.  Amy, you can get a *PLETHERA* of information about ecstacy in the 
hyperreal drug archive.  http://hyperreal.com/drugs.

I've heard that the spinal fluid drainage that Eric mentioned is a myth.
Read the archives and go from there.

This is a myth.  I remember reading how it became a myth, but don't 
remember right now.  There are many drug faq's and archives on hyperreal 
if you would like more information.

Sorry, gang!  Regarding Amy P.'s appeal for help, I realize that everyone's
gonna have something different to say, and I'm no doctor, etc.  What I
should have said, and what I say now, is: find and read whatever documented
research you can on the effects of any substance which concerns you.
That's likely to be more reliable than polling people for their individual
take.  Yes?

My advice to you, and to anyone in this situation, would be to contact

There could be a world of banter back and forth as to the effects of drugs

I gotta say one more thing on this, then that's it.  I've found that the
item in question diminishes my immune system, making me more vulnerable to
nasty viruses.  Between January and March of '95, I lost fifteen pounds due
to two multi-week bouts of flu, which under normal circumstances lay me out
for only three days to a week.  I am convinced that the Excessive weakening
of my immune system was the cause of this.  It may not be that way for
everyone, but as I'm human like most others on this list (if not all :)), I
feel it relevant that I relate this, as I am absolutely certain of it.
I still have five pounds to regain...but I'm more responsible to myself
now, and haven't been ill since.

Hope this helps,

Amy, his usage seems abnormally, extremely high, high enough that it 
might suggest what he's addicted to (yes, at that level, it's addiction, 
even if it were playing video games or eating chocolate) is not MDMA but 
something else.  MDMA has something of a built-in addiction resistance 
feedback mechanism - unlike most drugs, you usually *don't* feel the need 
to do it again right afterwards, or even for a few days afterwards, and 
taking it a couple times a week can cause the experience to drop 
in intensity.  But, I can imagine in cases of extreme emotional problems 
and ready access to lots of MDMA it could be abused - and if this is the 
case he needs to get some level of professional help, as well as private 
help from those around him in his life.

To everyone who responded-

Thank you guys so, so much for all the info and advice. Even 
though he is my ex, we are still good friends and I think at 
this point I could probably sit him down and talk to him. 

Right now though, he is in a tough-guy mode(e dealing and car 
buying) and I don't know how much of what I would say would 
make a difference. But he is very intelligent and smart and I 
know some of it would stick in his brain. I just hope he 
realizes what's up before it's too late.

Sorry about all the mishap, eric...I have heard the same info 
about fluid on the spinal tap too. Don't know if it's true or 
not.

I guess all I can do is be a friend and be concerned. I care 
about him and hope the best for him. Hopefully, he'll get out 
of this phase or whatever it is, soon.

Peace and love and BIG phat hugs,
amy   xoxoxo

I'm planning on being at the Gathering. My first rave, and first
massive was the Gathering last December. It proved to be a fabulous
initiation for me. Wicked can be fun (I went to the January one), but
the rave vibe just isn't as strong there as at the Gathering. I wonder
if they'll be doing it behind Home Base in Oakland again... (Shouldn't
that store really be called "Home Plate"?)

I sent a more personal letter to the originator of this thread, 

but addiction, or whatever is posible. I have a friend who used to spend
well over 3 grand a year on e (back when we called it x, and it went for $10 
a hit)

The problems can (and usually are) emotional at the base, and in some
cases friends can help, sometimes its deeper. With myself, when I found 
myself getting too deep, I had friends who puled me aside and said they 
were worried. I told them to fuck off.
but at some level it stuck, and I started 
noticing that sometimes I was having fun, 
someitmes I was taking it too far. 
And my friends helped me through. helped me stay
safe and sane, and keep things under control. Not by yelling, or pushing, but 
by letting me know when I was pushing things. Letting them know they cared 
for me, and that they werew worried. This isn't a born again freak
post. This sint an anti sugar, or caffine, or H post. Its a 'sometimes
you can help your friends who are in too deep' post. 

God this sounds like im preacing to the perverted, 
but please dont forget that things can go too
far. D is a wealty , mserable , fucking lawyer in NY. 
A, (an se raver) OD'd last year.
Sometimes people need a little more help.
Remember, we take care of eachother.

Boy, it sounds like most people had a terrible  time. I guess I got 
really lucky because when I showed up just after ten it took me 4-5 min. 
to get a ticket at Your Mama's and even less time to get into the 
actually location. There were only about 150 people when I first arrived 
but the place filled quite steadily. I didn't realize there were any 
problems until they stopped the music for awhile due to the outside crowd.
Inside as well some people though the vibe was uneven. I guess it depends 
where you were. I had a wonderful time, met several friendly people, got 
hugs (which I felt were really sincere), water, candy, etc. right in 
front of the turntables where I stationed myself the entire night. Also, 
lots of smiles up in front :) In light of the other posts, I will have 
second thoughts about future Bagok events, but really I enjoyed my night 
extremely well. (Really enjoyed all the trance that started the night 
off GOOD GOOD GOOD)

On another topic I am always sober during my raving (I find the music is 
my drug), and as was mentioned before catnaps are what makes an 
allnighter  possible (although, energy from the crowd has sustained me
on many occasions or sets that you just can't stop for even when you know 
you need a break). The physical activity of dancing usually will work for 
much of the night (for me). Usually, my friends get tired first 
(chemically aided or not) and often end up sleeping in my car for a while.
I just want to take everything in, don't want to miss anything.   

Trying to make it to the Gathering!

umm...this may sound really weird, but, i need some collective sf-raver 
advice....=) big time...=)

i'm debating whether to uproot myself or not....

here's the deal:

currently i live in denver, colorado...i have a nice stable job as a 
webmaster that pays decently....but, california has been calling me the 
last few years -- each summer since i was 17, 5 years ago, i've *almost* 
moved out there, but different things have held me back (money, fear, 
school, parents, etc.)....i'm thinking of moving to san francisco with 
some mtn-raves friends from albuquerque this august....

i was wondering if i could get people's opinions on the spirit of the 
city, just everything about your overall experiences in sf, especially 
from people that've recently moved out there or that, like me, said "fuck 
it let's just go".... was also wondering if i could also get some average 
cost of living figures from sf-ravers, a feel for job market prospects 
for a young kid with about 6-7 years internet experience and some writing 
experience.....career-wise, i love to design/architect/maintain web sites 
and i love to write things along the lines of wired/mondo 2000/urb/
project x (i've written for mondo and urb, i guess you could say...if 
scene reports count for urb...) and my heart lies at the center of 
alternative-internet culture (i started futureculture a long time ago, if 
anyone know what that is, and wrote the first alt.cyberpunk faq =) and 
rave culture (i started the tribe global rave culture email list, i'm 
writing for our local scene zine in Colorado, i'm heavily into the scene 
out here without being involved in promotions)....all that is why i know 
that's why i need to be in california....but that doesn't mean anything -
- everyone in california is like this...i'm a little fish in a big pond 
out there, and that's my biggest fear...

so i would really appreciate any feedback you could give me on the city 
itself and surviving out in california....i've pretty much lived in 
boulder and denver, colorado all my life, so....this is a huge change and 
i'm trying to get a lot of different feedback from a lot of different 
sources...

Eric!,
    E does not drain spinal fluid!!!! There are no reported documents, 
at least that I have researched that lead to this conclusion. Even if E 
did drain Cerebral Spinal Fluid it would be insignificant. I know this 
because I have resently had a spinal tap, (for serious health problems 
that we really don't need to go into right now). The amount of spinal 
fluid that was taken from my back was more than I thought was even in 
my back. And there is plenty more where that came from!!! I asked the 
doctor the oh so important question, "What will happen to my spine?" 
She said all the spinal fluid will regenerate and you will be back to 
normal in no time!! 
    So all in all, it has not been proven that E drains spinal fluid, 
and if it did, I don't think it would be a problem.  

Peace,

Greg :)

I checked out their homepage earlier today (www.communion.com/gathering)
and it said it is 20 minutes east of San Francisco.  Sure sounds like the 
same location to me.  I don't mind - it was big and airy! :)

All of us down here in S.J. are ready to dance our asses of @ the 
Gathering on Sat. We will be there in force, once again, as 
Crayons!!!!! So look for us. I think there are five of us, maybe more. 
We'll see!!!

DJ's Tomas and Abstract doing the tr/hip hop mo' waxy drumnbass thing. Not

You're right. well.com is not only the center for the Dead puter culture,
it is also the provider where you're most likely to find the real 
Inet lurkers (the people who really don't want you to know that 
they're there...).
And oh, if you care, well.com was also one of the puters that "master 
hacker" Kevin Mitnick broke into and abused before his capture last year.

  Hi!
  Brian I just thought I would point out that you are generally right 
about most folks not wanting e for a while after one (I'm one of those 
people-- I usually wait a year or so between Experiences), everyone has a 
different bio-chemical system and so personal experiences can vary wildly.

I don't post very often, but I have to say something about this.

I know most of the promoters in the area, and even if all of them aren't
throwing the best parties, nearly all of them *at least* approach their
event with a positive attitude. This extends to the flyers they create, the
decorations they provide, the DJ's they invite to play, and the people they
hand their flyers to.

I don't know BAGOK TRIBE, but I don't get that kind of feeling from them.

All I can say is when I saw my first (of about 10 I have found on my car or
forced into my hand at a party) damned flyer of theirs, I just wanted to
throw up.

The *blatant* drug references gave me the impression that they were much
more interested in selling drugs (or helping their friends sell drugs?)
than throwing a party. If you haven't see it, the flyer is basically
criminal.

On the front, there is a bowl of cereal on the thing and it's topped with
what are meant to be tablets and capsules! And the entire bowl has a
"rainbow" over it with more tablets and capsules! And there's a little
cartoon character next to it with a pot leaf on his hat and a necklace with
a big "e" medallion on it! And he's actually got a tablet with an "e" on it
in his hand! WHAT THE FUCK!?

And oh, did I forget to mention their jingle? Nothing about peace,
positivity, community, or vibe. It says "Magically delicious crunchy beats
wiht extra fortified vitamin treats!" Huh, vitamin treats! Wow, I think
that I get it now!

Down on the very bottom of the back of the flyer it says, "Open your mind,
your ears, and your hearts as we bring the east & west coasts together
under one house with unity, love, respect and happiness!" Well, by this
point, those words don't mean much coming from them...

These kind of parties are the reason that "RAVES" have a bad name. These
are the kind of parties that draw unnecessary attention to "the scene" by
concerned parents, civic groups, law enforcement, and media. These are the
kind of parties that make people thank that raves suck, and that we're
goofy for being so dedicated to them. An outsider can't see the difference
between a "Lucky Charms" and an underground party.

When you throw a massive, you have an *even greater responsibility* to do
the right thing since your event falls under the scrutiny of so many
people.

I'll be damned if I would *ever* give someone $20-30 to go to some vibeless
teenage gangsta-kid tagging, Adidas pimp-clothes wearing, circle dancing,
skate rink party -- even if there were *nothing* else going on.

This was most likely the kind of party/problem that caused the scene to
literally consume itself back in 1993, leaving the "rave scene" dead,
except for the undergrounds. And this is a damned shame, because the
underground is growing, and the correct vibes and messages are being shared
at that level, and we have the chance to really do great things for a lot
of people if we can spread this message.

Unfortunately, it only takes one "Lucky Charms" (or their flyer in the
hands of law enforcement or the media) to fuck it all up.

thanks for listening,

I went to a Gathering party in Richmond and it was to benefit Maliki.
Would anyone happen to know how he is?  If my memory serves me right, he
was in a tragic accident after coming back from a full moon party back in
92 or 93?  I was just curious as to how he is.  I really have a special
place for Gatherings because of that time I saw him and he smiled at me...
it broke my heart!

Subject: Ecstasy Rumor and Fact
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk
Status: O
X-Status: 

There are many baseless rumors circulating about e...an overfortunate but
understandable side-effect of the drug being prohibited by law, and
therefore having no useful information on dosage/safety etc. distributed to
the thousands upon thousands of people who take it each weekend.  (The
government sees fit to compromise the health of its citizens by maintaining
a puritanical silence on drugs).

In that environment, people (naturally hungry for knowledge) merely repeat
what others have told them.  We make our choices based on the netherworld
of half-truths, rumors, some fact, and suspicion - because that is all we
have to go on.  Rumor here is not nefarious but is offered to each other as
our only guidelines to help take care of each other.

But reliable information is available if you search.  I have read _E is for
Ecstasy_ by Saunders and did independent research in the health library at
UC Berkeley prior to ever ingesting the drug.  (I believe in INTELLIGENT,
INFORMED decisions about drug use!!).

1) Spinal fluid draining is an unmitigated MYTH
        but it does have the distinction of being the longest-lived rumor.
Back in the 70's when e was legal, preliminary tests were conducted tapping
peoples' spinal fluid.  This led to the connection between e and spinal
fluid, an assertion which has been repeated ever since.

2) addiction is virtually impossible
        One of the distinguishing aspects of ecstasy is the fact that its
effects diminish with increased use.  Several days-to-one-week seems to be
the necessary spacing between doses in order to achieve the same effect
(and many people recommend one month or more).  People can take 3 pills
over 12 hours, for instance, but 3 pills two days later will not achieve
very much.

3) Illness
        Some people have been known to vomit after overdosing on e, but
"seriously ill" is an extreme overstatement.  Unease seems to clear within
a few hours, and "hangovers" are virtually unknown.  Emergency room
admissions are remarkable rare, and if do occur are usually linked to the
presence of _other_ drugs.

4) e is rarely pure
        _This_ is the cause of most problems.  Often cut with speed, it is
advisable not to ever ingest more than 2-3 pills (dosage should be directly
proportional to body weight).  There is often acid and, rumored, heroin.
Since you don't know what you're popping in your mouth, BE CAUTIOUS.

4) E makes you depressed
        I have at the moment forgotten the term for the chemicals released
by e (the ones that regulate your mood and make you happy - not
endorphins).  But many people swing back to a "low" the next few days, and
rumors abound that e causes _long-term depression_.  NOT VERIFIED.
Short-term depression is alleviated by vitamin concoctions that replenish
your temporarily low chemical supply (these are found in smart drinks,
fruit, and orange juice, conveniently :) .  Rats who had damaged receptors
for these chemicals were found to have them REGENERATED within a year, i.e.
no long-term damage verified.

Contraindications for taking e:
1) History of epilepsy, seizures, heart problems
        In very rare cases, in people with a history of these problems, e
can bring on epileptic/seizure attacks (no recorded deaths have occured
from this).   Because its of the amphetimene family, one should also be
aware of any heart/blood pressure problems.

2) Only deaths have been attributed to extreme DEHYDRATION
        about 6 deaths in England in the last 10 years, due to extreme heat
and overcrowding, hours of dancing with no breaks, and lack of water.
People, take frequent rests and a lot of water (that is why bottles are
everywhere!!).


Information on e is not authoritative.  Because of the government's
prohibition on it, very few tests have been performed.  However, there does
exist a body of information.  Look it up at your local alternative
bookstore or on Hyperreal (lots of info).  This is just a sketch - there is
TONS of info on all the tests, medical stories, and history of and
synthesis of the drug.

Play safely!!

Love, Nancy

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

X-Status: 

Does anyone else know if this is going to be another $25 RIP-OFF?!  The
location is the same (or at least, is also noted as "20 minutes east of San
Francisco"), so expect a ridiculous price.  And I don't know if bringing a
toy at Christmas for a generous $5 off of ___!!!$25!!!_____ constitutes a
"discount!"

Apparently Gatherings started with the best of intentions.  But all I know
is that I went to several of Martin's events last year, and felt exploited
each time.  I don't like calling a voicemail and hearing, "Oh, the family's
coming together tonight!  It's going to be so BBEEAUUUUTIFUULLL!!  Tonight
we're creating love and unity, TOGETHER, yeah!!"

And then I arrive to find 3000 other people lined up, clutching their $25
in hand, to be patted down by big guards and thrown into cavernous space
without adequate sound and with the teeny vibe of the few earnest ravers in
the crowd attempting to make itself heard in the hugeness of the
massive....

The Gathering in December was a HUGE disappointment for me.  I didn't
notice any attempt on the promoters part to promote PLUR.  A LOT more could
have been with visuals, toys, vibe patrols, fruit, etc. to really enhance
peoples' experience and bring the thousands upon thousands together.
Instead, that location, not adequately decorated, was like several airplane
hangers, separating the crowd (with chain link fences!!).  The sound got
lost, sounding almost metallic because the huge space didn't provide
cushioning for it.  The only vibe came, as I said, from ravers who were
determined to make _something_ out of it.  I know the several newbies that
were in our group did not have a good time at all, and did not understand
what the rest of us saw in raving.

I just don't think unity should cost $25, and if it does, we should get a
little more for it!!  Can someone tell me what they see in these events
that deserves our support??!!  Because honestly, when I hear his messages
of "love" I only hear a conjob, and I can only wonder how rich he's grown
off of the scene.  Please tell me if you think I'm wrong about Martin and
the Gathering Scam, because right now I wouldn't go to this thing if you
paid me (and we certainly won't be the ones rolling bank at the end of the
night!!).

Your thinking of ComeUnity, wich was put on by Maliki and Simon.
Maliki is paralized from the neck down, but has gotten some feeling back in
his arms.
He's living in Scottland now with his familiy. He keeps in constant contact
with Simon (who is still keeping ComeUnity going in his memory).

I just found a very good Ecstasy information web page as I was poking 
around in order to get more information for myself.  The URL is:

http://tdg.uoguelph.ca/%7Epeak/issues/22/ish3/ecstasy.html

It is kind of a research project investigating the published research 
that has been done on MDMA.  I will quote a bit of it below, but you 
should really read it for yourself.  The research seems sound and has a 
bibliography.  It talks of ongoing scientific research being done around 
the world that has yet to be published.  Being from a scientific 
background, I prefer stuff like this to inform myself of risks rather than 
things like "E is for Ecstasy" by Saunders (but that is MY bias!!).  The 
page is well researched and says both the known and unkown.  Here is a 
snip of it:

"...There is little doubt that MDMA has the potential to cause 
neroanatomical changes and permanent serotonin deficiencies in the 
primate brain.  It remains to be shown whether there are functional 
consequences that correspond to the neroanatomical changes that 
characterizes excessive ecstasy use.  It also remains to be determined 
whether humans exhibiting MDMA-exposure damage are capable of 
compensating for damage via still undetermined pathways.  Research on 
this matter is ongoing at Johns Hopkins, the U.S. National Institute for 
Drug Abuse, and research labs worldwide."

I'll let anyone interested read the rest.  I found it in my search for an 
article about neural damage caused by MDMA that was supposedly published 
in Science magazine.  I still can't find the article, but I read about it 
last August sometime in the newspaper.  If I ever find it, I'll let 
anyone know who is interested.

My apologies for the "drug-talk".  The scientist in me is always looking 
for evidence!! he he

        Well, sorry to not clip out all this letter but it pretty much
describes my situation as well, apart from the fact that i'm in Montreal.
If anyone's has any help they could give me as well, i'd appreciate it.
I've basically decided to uproot (i don't have much roots here anyways).
I'd also be looking for HTML/Webmaster/Design/Writing work.  I'm not so
much worried about being a little fish in a big pond, because the SF pond
seems to be populated with a lot of cool fish! ;)
        thanks and much peace,

I had a beautiful time at the Dec. Gathering.  I'm not a big fan of huge 
parties like this, but every now and then, it is really fun.  I love 
seeing all of the different ppl, and I felt a great vibe.  I, however, 
stuck really close to some beautiful friends and this was perfect for 
me.  The music in the harder, non-house room totally moved my lil' ole' 
body.  

I guess it just goes to show you, that in many cases a party is what 
*you* as an individual makes of it.  Sometimes when things aren't going 
right for you (this happens for me) everything seems lesser.  Everyone 
has personal tastes, too, that enter in the picture.

I've enjoyed Martin's parties.  Basics was my first rave ever and I 
really enjoyed both the Dec. Gathering and the Feb. Vision.  I even liked 
the Home Base location.

Nancy's lack of enjoyment at this party (as well as someone earlier 
talking about having a good time at Lucky Charms when everyone else hated 
it) goes to show you how 
individual perceptions very so hugely.  I find that intensely interesting!!!

hasta la vista, I'm leaving this oppressive office for some sun right 
about NOW...... (you can tell how bored I was today, by my number of 
posts).  Ahh, tax dollars at work  (JUST KIDDING!!!)

It's my understanding he's moved back to Britain. Martin (who does the
Gathering) mentioned he spent some time with him when he was over there
this winter and that he was doing well.

I disagree. How about the rumor that LSD contains strychnine?

"Oh my muscles ache, boy that acid had a lot of strychnine in it."

The manufacture of LSD-25 is very involved and prone to errors. One of 
those errors is that impure manufacture can result in other 
amines(someone knowledgeble correct me if the terminology is off) of LSD are 
created, with effects that have not been fully studied, and this is where 
you get that crampy, achy feeling. Also, LSD is one of the few 
compounds that is active in *micrograms*. You can't fit enough strychnine 
on a piece of blotter to have any effect whatsoever on you.

Actually you are more likely to see MDMA cut with synthetic mescaline 
rather than LSD, given that it comes in powdered form. 

And please, for the millionth time, there is no MDMA in common 
circulation that is cut with heroin. Herion is very costly and addictive. 
*WHY* would anyone cut MDMA with a more expensive substance, when the can 
sell it to regular users at a higher price? This is a very common myth: 

"Oh my, I feel sick, and the E that I got had a lot of brown specks in it, so 
it must have heroin in it." Ten to one those brown specks are safrole. 
How many people that make the above statement have actually done herion 
to make such a statement?

MDMA reduces serotonin levels.

There is no medical basis that I have ever seen for the above statement 
regarding vitamins. Certain B-complexs are believed to *aid* in alleving 
depression, but not eliminating it altogether. While it may indeed work 
for you, making a sweeping statement as fact is in no ones best interest 
if taken as gospel.

Untrue. There have been a few cases of deaths attributed to an 
asymptomatic reaction to MDMA, including that of a person whose father 
occasionally posts on S.F. Raves.

This is the one thing I can agree with. Know what you are doing to your 
body. For most of us it's the only one ya got.....

Little Johnny was sitting in class doing math problems when his teacher

"Johnny, if there were five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with
your gun how many would be left?"

"None," replied Johnny, "cause the rest would fly away."

"Well, the answer is four," said the teacher. "But I like the way you are

Little Johnny said, "I have a question for you now. If there were three
women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one licking her cone, the second
biting her cone and the third sucking the cone, which one is married?"

"Well," said the teacher nervously, "I guess the one sucking the cone?"

"No," said Little Johnny, "the one with the wedding ring on her finger, but

Sorry, gang!  Regarding Amy P.'s appeal for help, I realize that everyone's 
gonna have something different to say, and I'm no doctor, etc.  What I 
should have said, and what I say now, is: find and read whatever documented 
research you can on the effects of any substance which concerns you.
That's likely to be more reliable than polling people for their individual

As someone who used to be where you are at, Andy, I think I can give you some
good insights.  I just moved to San Francisco back in October from Washington,
DC.  Like you, I'd been in love with the city for a long time before I moved
here.  I'd visited it a couple of times, fallen in love with the scene, the
scenery, the people, everything.  I'd been planning to move out here for about
two and a half years, but various things (mainly my own trepidation) conspired
to keep me away.

Finally, last September I packed everything I own up into a big 15 foot U-Haul
truck and drove it cross the country with a friend of mine (an experience all
its own).  I was/am in a slightly different position than you, merely taking
time off from school rather than having embarked on a career or anything.  So
I
was also a little more cavalier about finding a job or a place to live.  In
fact, I was pretty much expecting to take a big cut in my standard of living,
since I had heard that San Francisco's job market was oversaturated and its
cost of living high.

But things turned out completely in my favor.  I had the benefit of knowing
someone who had a room for rent before I arrived in SF.  So although it was
still a temporary place to live, I didn't have to fret about inconveniencing
anyone or staying in a hotel or something.  I did temp work for a while,
through which I found a permanent job, which in fact *raised* my standard of
living, much to my surprise.

Moving out here has been the best thing I've done in a long time.  I've met
lots of cool people, made plenty of good connections, and generally been
supremely happy.

To answer your questions more specifically, yes the cost of living is fairly
high.  For me, coming from DC, it was about the same that I was used to
actually.  I don't know what Denver is like, though.  If you're looking to
live
inside the city, studios and one bedrooms are about $500 and up, and you can
expect to pay pretty close to one month's rent X 3 as a move in cost.  (It is
in fact illegal for a landlord to charge as much as rent X 3 to move in, but
many ride the line just below that amount.)  If you're willing to live in a
group living situation, you could probably reduce your rent to the $350-400
range.  One thing about San Francisco housing is that it's a bad time to be a
rentor.  Vacancies are scarce.  But, as with anything, a little hard work and
you'll find what you're looking for.  You had mentioned moving out here with a
bunch of people; one word of caution: big 3/4/5 bedroom flats or houses are
*extremely* scarce.  One advantage to living in the city is that you can jump
around on the questionably reliable but unquestionably far-reaching public
transportation system.  Even outside the city, there's BART and CalTrans.  If
you're willing to live outside the city, everything is much cheaper, except
perhaps transportation costs.

As for the job market, everyone I know has had little difficulty finding a job
out here.  I'm not into web stuff, but I'm sure anyone can tell you that this
is the place to be if you are.  Sure, the market is a little more saturated,
but I haven't heard of any scarcity of jobs in that field as of yet.

As for the state of San Francisco itself, it seems to be on a tremendous
upswing, even since I moved here.  We have a new major, which most people seem
to be happy about.  California's economy is improving.  According to recent
surveys, civic pride and general satisfaction is increasing.  As for the rave
scene, it definitely seems to have matured a lot over the past couple of
years.  There is now a much wider range of music, and the previous lock-down
on
promotion and dj's seems to have been broken.

So my final recommendation: DO IT!

  Heya, Andy! And Bonjour, Brad!  I've had a good job for years, so 
maybe I'm not the best person to dispense advice. But recently I've 
watched several folks, of varying abilities and personality types, go 
looking for jobs in the SF Bay Area. Based on what I've seen, and what 
you describe as your strengths and interests, here's my take on the 
situation. Corrections and additions from other SFRavers cheerfully accepted.
  1)  There are lots of folks who know weblore, and they are getting 
more numerous by the hour. Many of them have a good sense of design 
and what prospective employers might want. But these days, if you want 
the edge of employment, you have to be on top of as many of the 
following as you can:
  UNIX
  CGI 
  Java
  C and/or C++
  DOS/WINDOWS/MAC (all 3) experience
  SUN and/or SGI workstations
  Previous experience helping out people less knowledgeable than  you are.

   2) Folks won't hire you sight unseen. They want to look you in the eyes
and assess how you'll fit in with the other people in the workplace. So 
best of all = come stay with a friend (preferably one with connections) 
in SF and start looking. You may even have to go to a temp agency to 
start with. Count on at least a solid month of hard looking plus 
disappointments before you score.

   3) Show confidence without arrogance, and enthusiasm without naivete.

   Caramba ... now I'm sounding like Dear Abby.  :<(
   Enough for now.

Had a mixed time at crysalis (coulda just been me)- met some really neat
people, though, and there were some ambient sets that were beautiful.

my big question is there was this movie thery were showing of people locked in
a cage wearing bio-hazard suits throwing bowling balls through TV sets. I was
quite amused.

The footage looked like it was from an event Vince and I went to in late
1994 here in SF (on Illinois Street, near the corner of 3rd and Marin!)
called "Kill Your Television".

Those people were in the "Crush Cage" killing old TV's, and all the while
the local industrial band "Sharkbait" played along. I remember the lead
singer yelling "Fuck it up! Fuck it up!" over and over again as brave
participants killed TVs to the crowd's amusement.

It was pretty cool.

Thanks for the clear, informative post Nancy!

I have a few little additions:

        >One of the distinguishing aspects of ecstasy is the fact that its

>the necessary spacing between doses in order to achieve the same effect

Ahem, "physical addiction" may be virtually impossible, however "psychological
addiction" is something that many ravers have seen or experienced.  This is
very real! Some people feel that a psychological addiction is actually worse
than a physical addiction.  This is due to the fact that a true physical
addiction is temporary and lessens with time spent away from the drug;  whereas
a psychological addiction can last ad infinitum.  I don't mean to argue
semantics, this is just my two cents.

warmly,

Actually, speaking as someone who's been looking for good one-bedrooms, 
I'd say the other end of the scale is just as scarce, with 2-3 bedroom 
apartments or flats being the most available.  The cost per person 
certainly goes down with the larger places too.

Nope!  Not here.  :)

Same here.  I've never regretted it.

I have never been to a Martin party -I mean rave- that I have not 
enjoyed.  I came into the scene in 1993, the year I later learned was the 
scene's low point.  I did attend some rather crappy raves, but there was 
usually a Basics, Gathering or Vision every other month or so, and each 
party more than made up for any lame raves.  I've had some of my best and 
most memorable times at these raves. They cannot and should not be 
compared to smaller, more underground parties.  If you do go in with that 
expectation, prepare to be disappointed. 

I've paid $20 for parties that delivered **MUCH** less than Gatherings, 
Basics, & Visions. I look at what I am getting for my money (which you, 
Nancy, see differently).  I am getting an ENORMOUS sound system - I've 
never seen them as huge as that (the ones they use at the outdoor 
Livermoore location and @ Richmond Civic Centre) and they still don't 
hurt my ears.  I get plenty of free water, I get a nice wide open space 
to dance and it is NOT TOO HOT!! I get really REALLY good vibes from many 
many people, the dj's ALWAYS deliver and get the crowd worked up into a 
frenzy.  Plus I have never EVER been to a massive rave other than 
G,BorV where at the end eveyone forms a giant circle holding hands.  My 
$20 is also going for a legally rented out space that is SAFE to use and 
will not get busted. I also usually get to see an incredible laser 
show (one of my secret passions!) And the visuals in general have 
never been a disappointment.  Most of these factors, including the security, 
costs alot of money.  It also takes alot of time, effort, energy and 
dedication to promote a party of this size. Raves this size have a 
certain awesomeness *BECAUSE* of its vast size that cannot be found at 
smaller parties.  The excitement is different and even the acoustics are 
different sounding in such a vast space.  Almost echoey.  You can loose 
yourself if the crowd and be autonomous if you wish, or you can join your 
group of buddies. It is like being on the very edge of chaos and it still 
retains enough control to keep from falling off. :)  

Wayne had mentioned in his Lucky Charms post about how promoters who put 
on such massives have an enormous responsibility for how raves are 
percieved by society at large since so many more people are exposed to a 
massive.  Cruel World failed miserabley in the past as has Banok Tribe.  
In the 4+ years that Martin has been throwing raves of this size, he has 
yet to majorly fuck up.  I think he and his crew are doing a MARVELOUS 
job of "Always, always keeping it alive." :):)

See you all at THE GATHERING this Saturday night.  I am truely looking 
forward to it! :):) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!

love,
Amy

I have to agree with Nancy.  A massive necessarily means lots of people.  It 
should either 1) cost less, or 2) be IMPRESSIVE.  In fact, IMHO, anything 
over $15 better be pretty darn good: killer sound, huge visuals, serious 
lighting, two or more LARGE dance rooms and at least one good ambient space 
with it's own visuals.  It should come complete with the "community" message.

Nancy hit it dead on: if it's going to advertise a given theme, it should be 
produced in the spirit of that theme.  Towards that end, maybe some of the 
massives should have a single sound before giving directions: KA-CHING!

(ooo I'll probably get flamed for that statement...oh well...)

I would *like* to go to the Gathering Saturday night just because so many 
people said so many good things about it last time...  but if it's going 
cost that much...  eeeesh.......

By the way, who's the guy that's on the Gathering voice message?  Is he 
Irish or Jamaican?  Or both?  Or what?

You're not over 21?  You suck.  And we wouldn't want to party with you anyway.

JUST KIDDING!

Ok, lessee...  I think Quantum was the only thing, and that's moving to the 
weekend.  There's an FMR tonight though...  Don't know the number...

Does anyone here have the number for the FMR tonight?

I'm not going to say too much, only that Martin's heart is in the right
place and he's definitely not getting rich off of these parties. Part of
why they're expensive is because he does things _the right way_. All
permits, cooperation with local city officials and police departments,
insurance, etc.

He's also flying out two pretty damn big names from England for this party:
David Holmes and Alex Paterson (Orb).

Martin's Irish - that's who you hear on the message.

OK...here's the deal.  I've been tossing around the idea of moving to SF, 
or in the near area of it, for about 3 weeks now.  Now I've been reading 
that others want to do the same and thought I'd share with all you 
San Franciscans (and to others in surrounding areas) what I'm debating with.

Right now I'm in the Nursing Program at CSU Fresno.  I hate it...the 
school, not the program.  I totally disagree with the teaching rationale 
here, and I also dart up to SF every chance I get.  Hence, my grades just 
aren't that great this semester.  Oh...I have 2 years to go (been going 
FT for 3 already).

I live in a great 3 bedroom condo (my share is 250 + util) with roommates 
whom I get along with relatively well, and I have a great job with a 
promise of a "Nurse Apprentice" position after this semester.

The dilema is this:  If I move, I'll be paying more rent for a MUCH 
smaller room I'm sure, I'll be living with strangers, and I'll have to 
find a new job that pays as well if not better than mine.  What's the 
hospital situation there?                Just scared to take the plunge.... 

What should I do friends?  I feel like I'll be making my life much harder 
than it needs to be, but I love being up there.  It kills me to read 
about all the parties people are going to. Would I even graduate if I 
were there.......:)

Input would be appreciated.  Thanks friends.

Marty

That's great, but I still don't believe he isn't make a *substantial* 
amount of money off these parties. I sent a message to Martin 
asking him about the price of his parties, and offering suggestions, after 
the last $25 dollar party. A message that I spent 2 hours composing. I sent 
it a total of three times, and never received a response. So color me 
jaded as to his intent.

$25+ is too much for a party. Pay it, or get in on the guest list, as 
many of the people attempting to justify the cost do... Have fun. Enjoy. 
Spread all that PLUR talk to those that can afford that $25 right along 
with you.

Just a little note on seratonin levels after taking e: not to condone 
taking medicine that is not prescribed to you, but my friend in NYC 
sends some of her Prozac for me to take after taking e. Since Prozac does 
the opposite of e (it increases seratonin levels), taking *one* afterwards 
seems to make me feel better. This has absolutely NO scientific basis, 
that I know of, but it helps ME recover. Again, I'm not condoning or 
advertising this, but it sort of makes sense.

Also, while I'm here, I may as well introduce myself: I used to go to 
parties all the time, but a combination of being with the wrong people, 
who were on the wrong drugs, plus getting tired of worrying about not 
being 21 (I'm 19) and a medical thingy made the scene sort of lose its 
luster...Well, I still haven't gone to a party in months, but I'm 
regretting my hasty abandonment and I'm re-evaluating the place that 
raves have in my life. I miss it, ya know? So I've joined this list to 
create a different foundation for myself. By communicating (or mostly 
watching, as of late) with SFRaves, I'm starting to re-establish why I 
started raving in the first place, instead of keeping my not-so-great 
memories. When I find faith again, and trustworthy people, I foresee many 
wonderful experiences. Tell me what you think.

AND, lastly, to anybody thinking of moving here, as I did recently from 
Massachusetts (any New Englanders out there?) there is a service called 
Roommate Referral which is very helpful to find nicely located places in 
your price range. It means moving in w/ ppl you don't know, but that can 
be kind of an adventure. Also, I had NO problem finding work, but my work 
is completely un-computer related, so that might be different. As far as 
the feel of SF, it changes all the time, in each neighborhood, yet it is 
usually good and beautiful (talk about some over-used ajectives, eh?). To 
me, it seems that California can be everything sometimes, and other times 
nothing. Basically, it is a place, that can offer you a lot, but you have 
to be willing to grab it. I guess anywhere is like that. If you've been 
thinking of moving here, do it, because that way your questions will be 
answered.
Sorry to have rambled...Talilla

        No, it's not semantics i think. With the one (physical) addiction
there is a lowering of the bodies homeostatic levels so the body REQUIRES
something to be ingested in order to maintain balance.  I'm guessing that
because e doesn't affect the neurochemical homeostatis (like the way
nicotine and heroin can) your body won't crave it. Your mind, though,
because it may (in a kinda pavlovian way) associate those feelings of
peace, love and connectedness with a pill, can crave for it because it
wants those feelings. I think the truth of it (for me at least) is that
happiness and peace _doesn't_ come in a pill, it's something you have to
look inside for. I suppose, though, that because peace and happiness aren't
'buyable' that makes those feelings all the more valuable :)
        :)

Just a note, my friends at Platinum here in Portland (who sell more
1200s on the west coast than anyone except Pro Sound, or so they say
and I have no reason to dispute it) tell me that Technics is raising
the wholesale prices considerably, and retail costs for new 1200s
*over* $500 are coming in the near future.  I think both Platinum and
Pro Sound will continue slightly below that mark.  But strong demand
for the unit and changes in the dollar/yen exchange rate are leading
to the increased prices.

At the risk of helping to reignite the long and huge convoluted wrangle
over MDMA, there are two things about Nancy's post that deserve comment.

First, there have been a lot more than six deaths in E-related circumstances
in Britain over the last decade.  Not hundreds, but a lot.  Dehydration
may be one proximate cause, but it also appears that *overhydration* may
also be at issue.  There is also strong evidence that a very few people
may have a toxic and even fatal reaction to E itself. 

Second, contrary to Nancy's statement, it appears that the "bunk E" issue
is also misunderstood.  Testing in Dutch clubs and elsewhere has shown
that "cut" or otherwise tampered with E is rare if not unknown.  The
process used to make the compound may have more or less purity, that's
for sure.  But quality control problems should not be confused with
dilution issues.  I have yet to hear of a reliable instance where
MDMA has been commingled with other substances, though it's not impossible
to imagine.  What usually seems to be the case is other things being 
fraudulently sold as E, from Vitamin C (don't laugh, I've heard of this
happening) to speed and many other possibilities.  

I think it is critically important to neither understate nor overstate
the problems and characteristics of this drug.  The same goes for any
other.  

Again, as Brian pointed out, hyperreal has an excellent source of *solid(
information on this and many other substances.

I am hoping someone could recommend a good ambient buy.  I am looking

want a compilation CD, but am open to the idea if someone knows of a mixed
one.  I can't stand when you buy an ambient CD and there's a pause after
each song.  Ruins the whole thing for me.

SO, who are your favorite ambient DJs, do they have mix tapes, know of any
good CDs, all that good stuff.

Oh, yeah, P.S. - Hate to ask, but I'm new to the list.  What is PLUR?

well.. prozac does increase serotonin levels, but it takes at least a week
before the drug takes effect. when you take a serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor
(like prozac) you slowly rebuild your serotonin levels and keep it there.
what you are probably experiencing is the placebo effect. actually, i felt
the same placebo effect when i started taking prozac while seriously
depressed. Two hours after taking the pill i felt great, even though there
was no way that the prozac could have taken effect yet. however, if it makes
you feel good, one pill is virtually harmless.

some ginseng taken after e would probably make you feel better too.
supposedly it raises serotonin levels also (i think it can fix your car too...)

but yes, serotonin does seem to be linked with depression, as do other
neurotransmitters, though seemingly not to as great an extent.

with regards to what serotonin does:
serotonin is a neurotransmitter. basically what it does is facilitate (sp?)
the "sparks" that jump between neurons. if your levels are low, your
neurotransmitters won't be as responsive (i.e. you feel like shit). there
are other neurotransmitters, which i cannot remember the names for at this
point. Various other anti-depressants which are newer than prozac attack
both serotonin and other neurotransmitters.

Incidently, it is believed (by some, anyway) that an overabundance of
serotonin can cause people to think more clearly and feel better. This could
be partly why LSD and E feel so good, as both raise serotonin levels
(temporarily). LSD and E do to your serotonin levels what sugar does to your
glycogen levels when you are playing sports- bring it up for a while, but
then send you down lower than before. It is essential, just as in sports, to
recover to your 'normal' levels before throwing your body out of whack again.
Of course, other drugs are purported to raise serotonin levels, most
infamously the 'smart drugs'. I don't feel like going into this at the
moment, although they certainly do have a visible effect on rave culture..
smart drinks anyone?

Generally, use caution when dealing with your brain. It's the most delicate
part of your body and it is in your best interest not to fuck it up.
If you are depressed to start with, E will make you feel good for a while,
but for a couple days afterwards you are going to feel even worse. This is
not such a good thing. Better would be to deal with the depression (yes, it
can be treated as a medical illness) before tweaking your mind further out
of shape. I have had a fair deal of experience with prozac and similar
drugs, and can say that they are very useful in pulling yourself out of a
depressive state.

regarding prozac again, if you don't need it, don't take it. prozac will not
have a positive effect on serotonin levels if yours are 'normal' already.
you'll probably just get a couple unwanted side effects. again, why fuck
with your own head?

be careful out there!
peace
brendan

I'd just like to point out that it seems this thread is all too much 
trying to attach a monetary value to something that can't be expressed in 
terms of money (i.e. PLUR).  I'll admit that $25 may be out of someones 
budget, but I can easily see how Martin can come away with little to show 
in the pocket book from parties I have done.  There are several different 
ways to throw a party and different people have different ideas on how to 
throw a party.  I recently had an interesting conversation where a person 
I'm working with in Oregon thought it was *really* rude that we dont pay 
our djs.  While I would disagree it just goes to show that niether one of 
us is really right how ever you argue it is what I am trying to say.  

Whether or not you agree with Martin and how he throws his parties, you 
should be thankful that we have a scene diverse enough that you can 
choose another party as an option, usually one that might be free.

Trust me as much as I'd like to reply to all the Cloud Factory, and 
Daydream mail I get there is no way I could...with 150+ emails a day 
average in my mailbox it just doesnt work, but Martin not emailling you 
back is not any sign of his intent imho.

there really is no need for it.  and oddly enough i've seen you

Hi,

My 2 cents:  Martin is one of the last promoters who actually is able to 
throw massives these days.  He's managed to build a good history of 
bringing them off without ruining his reputation or hurting the rave 
scene.  Can other big promoters say the same?

He is one of the few "commercial" promoters I would trust to throw a big 
party.  He knows his stuff.  And he is way way into raving.  I would 
gladly shell out 25$ for one of his parties.

People often don't bother to question the seller in enough detail.  
Another wise precaution is to find out who at the party has taken the 
same stuff and then ask them how they are doing with it.  If you must 
indulge, you should be very careful about what you're buying and you 
should try to get a good recommendation from other customers.

And if you are trying something for the first time, then you absolutely 
MUST be sure to let your companions know what you are doing so that if 
you have a bad reaction, they can tell the emergency room folks exactly 
what you took.  And if you are really smart, you should save a bit of it 
so that it can be analyzed later.

I have a CD by a David Holmes called "This Film's Crap Let's Slash the
Seats".  Stupid title, but very nice ambient/techno music.  Is this the
same guy?

Anyway, I'm looking forward to The Gathering.  I've been to many of 
Martin's parties over the years, and while many have been duds IMO,
many others have given me some of my most magical rave experiences.
The Gathering parties I've been to have never failed to deliver the
kind of vibe I rarely find at legal massives, and I know many people 
who rarely go to massives or to any event over $10 that will
come out for a Gathering.  

Ultimately, it is the people that make the party.  The last Gathering
didn't have a lazer or free glowsticks at the door, but that didn't
seem to matter much at the end when we danced together as a family.
Big parties rarely have the Unity of smaller ones but if they
can come close it can be pretty amazing.  I'm happy to pay a premium
for a safe, legal, comfortable environment where this can happen.

Of course, our own attitudes will alter the experience. "Martin
didn't answer my email, this party sucks!" "Not enough teddy bears, 
this party sucks!" "Martin's making money..." etc.  Each of us has 
the power to tune in to the things that matter to us.

For this weekend's Gathering, the experimental/ambient room has an
incredible lineup so I'm going to have a hard time deciding where
to plant myself.  Seeya!

Lee

     Andy and Brad,
     
     I've said "Fuck it" and I'm moving to SF by myself from DC at the end 
     of April.  A lot of what you said, Andy has been the way I've felt 
     over the past years.  California's been calling.  And its been pretty 
     hard for me to break away from everything.  But it's now or never.  I 
     know not a sole in SF and I don't have a job yet (but I do have an 
     apartment) and it scares the shit out of me.  But I gotta do it.  If 
     it doesn't kill me, it will only make me stronger.  I've come to trust 
     myself and I know that it may be rough at first, but I'll pull 
     through.  My true friends in DC will always be good friends.  And 
     moving to a new place, I can only meet many more.
     
     I can't wait to go.  I've been lurking on the list for several weeks 
     now and I've been blown away by what I've read.  I feel a great sense 
     of community, respect, maturity, sense of one's self and love of life 
     from this group.  And I'm anxious to be a part of it.  What a journey 
     it will be!

It sounds like "White Light" which from what I am told contains 5% 
synthetic mescaline.

Dear Nancy, I wouldn't be so quick to criticize Martin for his parties
"vibe".. I think he's only reacting to a situation in which he has to deal
with a lot more variables than most of the "fly by night" promoters.

And that costs...
He has a (IMHO)fairly good record in throwing parties... Remember, Martin 
actually hires quite a few people from the communities he throws parties in,
and gets permits for them, etc... You know when you poy for one of his 
parties that at least it will go off.. unlike quite a few others..

I agree with you that a lot of the newer parties don't do anything near 
what they could do visually, etc... What do you expect? They don't have
the competition they used to, and can get away with less... A lot less..


Give them shit.. and maybye they'll start spending money again..
When we were doing ToonTown, we would typically have a $7-10,000 budget for
lighting alone... The last parties Ive seen with that kind of energy and 
visuals were the benefits for Malachy three years ago...
Give them shit... maybye they'll listen..

-Chris.

Dude, what is up with you? Do you have a personal vendetta against Martin?
Where were you when these fools threw Lucy Charms? It may have not been
$25 but people seem to think that they didn't get their money's worth.  How
many people do you know WHO HAVE BEEN to one of Martin's parties  do you
see complaining about the price?  If it cost too much then don't go.
I know another promoter who threw a $25 party that wasd absolutely wonderful,
It was a large massive and I must say that it reminded me of the large 
Toon Towns of Old.  He did it in a place that requird all kinds of insurance and
off duty police and fees, and in the end THE VENUE TOOK ALL THE MONEY, made
sure the IRS and ZFTB got paid took out their fees, some unexpected and 
gave them the rest 30 days later, the promoter broke even though the place
was full.  The naked truth is that if you want cheap parties, that's what
the underground is for, have it in a park or some other place but you the
promoter
and the party goers are taking many calculated risks.  Martin is one of the few
(only) promoters that has the kind of record that he can challenge a permit
denial in court because he dots all the I's and crosses the T's and his
record with the community is impeccable.  Martin makes a living through throwing
parties and his clothing business,  I hope he makes more than enough money to
fullfill his dreams and to help build the infrastructure that we as a community
will need when the parties are over some day.

Yep, same guy, although he'll be DJing and I suspect it'll be more techno
than much of his album is. btw, his new single "Gone" is essential.

Speaking of rumors and hearsay. =) I've heard similar tales, but basically
the trick is to never trust a dealer. They usually don't know what they
have and are just repeating what someone else up the line has told them.
Now if someone can show me an NMR I'll be convinced. caveat emptor

That does not mean that I should not be able to voice my opinion on the 
subject. I simply do not see the necessity to charge what is being 
charged, nor I have I been shown that necessity. So maybe it isn't 
anyones job to show me a damn thing. Fine, so I *ASKED* the promoter 
directly, and received no reply.

I have attempted to understand any reason that it is necessary to charge 
the amounts being charged. I can't get anyone knowledgable to respond. 
And I don't mean "Well I can see where he is not getting rich, etc." I 
mean real information, figures. And again, no one is obligated to show me 
squat. Fine, given that no one will show me anything, please don't expect me to 
suddenly change my opinion, or be any less vocal about my opinion.

Good question. (a condensed bit of history):

When I first started going to parties, Toon Town and such, 
I had a decent job and could afford to go out. Well, this all changed and 
I went through a period of long-term unemployment. I was not "in the 
know" and the only parties I heard of were of the $20+ variety. And I 
really wanted to go out, but couldn't afford to(sounds of tiny violins 
playing in the background, I know...) To be a part of that community 
everyone was talking about. But I couldn't afford the price of admission. 
So guess I was out of luck. 

Well, my fortune changed again, I finally got an auto-accident insurance 
settlement(2+ years), a job, and a shiny new computer, a whole hell of a 
lot to be grateful for. So I was able to go out again, got more 
"connected," and found this great thing called S.F. Raves. And know what? I 
found all these great parties that we charging $5, $10, or were even *free* 
Imagine my amazement and suprise! Here all this time I thought it was 
necessary to pay $20 to go to a party, when the truth was that there were 
people out there putting on these parties out of pure love, out of their 
own pockets, making little or no money, just for the sheer pleasure of 
giving. Man, what a beautiful thing thinks I. "Where do I sign up?" So I 
found out, and did so. 

Please do not take my earlier statement as a blanket inditement of 
massives or $20+ parties. I have seen parties(NYE Toon Town) comes to mind, 
where I saw the money going into the party to justify the price of admission. 
I have been to a few of Martin's parties, Basics, Vision, and Freedom in 
the past. At no time did I see anything to justify the $20+ price of 
admission. The party at the Vallejo fairground especially comes to 
mind. One room, concrete, and little seating or lighting. Yes, I most certainly 
felt taken advantage of.

So why do I care?

Interesting, never thought about this- what will happen when we start to
get into positions of power and start getting the financial means ect. to
make powerfull decisions?, hopefully we wont just end up like the yuppies
of the early 21 century.

It seems that most ravers do not follow the traditional path to getting
into positions of power and making money.  I know many people who do
their own thing, get successful by doing their own thing, and then put
money back into the scene by buying soundsystems or generators ect.

There are many people like this on this list.

I think ravers have seen the path from hippie to yuppie and do not want
to follow it.  Not that ravers do not want to become financially stable
and successful...  We do.  The difference is that ravers want
to keep true spirituality in their life... something that many Yuppies
(who are now more accurately described by the term "overclass"), have
lost.

Well, I guess everything is relative to one's point of view. I thought
the price was steep, but it was well made up for by the excellent DJ's
that were on that night. And, at least, they weren't hitting you $2-3
every time you wanted to refill your water bottle, like they do at 914
King for Wicked. I found the ventilation very satisfying, too.

I expressed back then that a few improvements could have been made. It
seemed that those suggestions did get heard, because when I went to
Vision last February, a lot of missings -- more exciting visuals
(i.e. lasers), a larger soft chill-out zone, fruit, etc. were
fulfilled. It isn't as though Martin has a lot of control over the
fencing thing -- I like to think of it as a secret garden to descend
into. 
 
There were moments at both The Gathering and Vision when I had random
people come up and make all sorts of contributions -- either excellent
neckrubs, lotion rubs, hugs, meditative momemts. The crowd may be more
diverse here than at the underground parties -- but the spirit and
vibe are definitely in there. 

I really hope you change your mind about going. I feel that we can all
be a major influence on the vibe at a massive. When you notice someone
not being in the vibe, why not introduce yourself, and contribute
something? By bringing more awareness of PLUR and spirituality into
the mix, we boost up the vibe for everyone.

What you mean "we", paleface?  :)  When you get to a position of power,
please be kind to those of us who have no desire to hold such positions.
In other words, I won't lead, but I'll follow...

	Yeah, it's so diverse and immense that it's just not very feasible,
how about this......Anyone heard any good tunes lately that just knocked
their socks off?  One of my all-time favs is Sun by the Ambush.  It's
labeled as a trance-sedated jungle album, and that describes it perfectly.
Definately a must have IMO.  If anyone's interested, I could dub a bit of
it and post.  The FSOL ISDN album makes for good background listening here
at work, and helps relieve stress too! :^)

        Without repeating more of his post, Black Adder has valid points to
make, just like the rest of us.  I, too, would be interested in seeing a
balance sheet (the accountant in me talking) or other breakdown of the
costs associated with a massive, and compare to the costs associated with a
small UG party.  It's fruitless to swat this ball back & forth if no one
can provide sample data (witness my clueless post about MDMA recently).
        I was also not sufficiently impressed with the Vallejo affair to
return, were they to hold another one there (I heard "we" lost that space
due to tagging, but that's just what I heard).  I feel the same about the
Antioch party, though I don't recall the price of admission.
        Adder, sounds like your interest truely lies in the subscene we
find at the more intimate UGs.  If that's the case, as it is with many of
us, and since IMO therein lies the true sfraves spirit, then perhaps you
should say "Stone the crows" and stick with those parties (I'm leaning that
way myself).

Dig,

I agree.
The reason psychedelics work is because they "disrupt" serotonin
transmissions in the brain. The molecule that makes up a psychedelic is so
similar to a serotonin molecule that your brain's receptors can't tell the
difference (until after transmission, then, oh yeah, your brain can tell).
 
The only difference between serotonin and psilocin (mushrooms) are a
slightly different mixture of atoms, however the structure of the molecule
is exactly the same.

The difference between serotonin and LSD is a slightly different structure,
but still not enough of a difference to be rejected by the receptor.

FYI: 
other neurotransmitters:
Acetylcholine   
Dopamine
Norepinephrine
Epinephrine - also known as adrenaline 
Glutamate
Gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) gabba-gabba-hey!
Substance P - the shittiest one, reports pain 
Leu-enkephalin - all you Deepak Chopra fans: this is the body's own opium.
Met-enkephalin - also opiate-like  

YES, I AM THE SOURCE OF RANDOM MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE.

This is one reason why I think it is so important to have chill rooms!
Too often when people throw parties they forget the need for a space where
people both on and off drugs  can relax. I have seen many a bad situation
diffused because a person was able to be taken to a  chill/ambient room
for time out.

Why should we laugh that you were in the Grateful Dead scene?  In many
ways, I think the Dead scene and the rave scene have things in common.
I think in many ways both scenes were/are searching for many of the same
things and you shouldn't be embarassed that you were in that scene.
Though I must say I am glad you found rave . . .:)

To everybody:
The arguement is so futile!
If you want to go, then go.  If not, go somewhere else or stay home. San 
Francisco is blessed to be filled with *CHOICES*.

How much money Martin made is none of my business and it is none of yours.

The only thing that IS my business is whether or not to support his 
rave.  See some of you there!

Martin provided this kind of info. a year or so back when this topic came
up before (check the archives), which he didn't have to do but so anyways. 
It seems unreasable to expect someone to provide this kind of data for
every party they do...

ps why does this seem to come up before *every* gathering? deja-vu...

I have no vendetta against Martin or anyone else I can think of off the 
top of my head. I feel as I have for some time, that the parties are not 
worth the price of admission. I am free to express this opinion and I 
will. I did not start this thread, but am merely agreeing with the poster 
who also felt that $25 was too much.

I saw the flyer for Lucky Charms and laughed. Like Wayne, I was extremely 
turned off by their advertising, and from the sounds of it they ripped 
people off *BIG*. What more can I add to what has already been said about 
Lucky Charms and the motives behind it? I think quite a few people summed it up 
nicely.

Yes I do think $25 is too much, and I am as free to say so, just as you 
are free to say it is an incredible value. Can we agree to disagree?

I also have "candy flipped" and agree that it was awesome but I could
see how that intense experience could be overpowering if you sre not
prepared.  Candyflipping (at least for me) is very different from x-ing
and can be disconcerting to many people who otherwise enjoy e-ing.

Yes!!! Coffee would be so nice to have at a party!  It lends itself well to
socializing, smells and tastes pleasing (to me, anyway), and it's not just
for breakfast anymore :)  The caffeine does nothing for me, because I'm so
naturally sedate (definitely a type B personality, but not a sloth), but I
love drinking the stuff, especially flavored!  Maybe we should set up
shop...

Make mine a double-cap!

IDEA!!!!  
If you don't like someone involved with a party, then don't go to the party!!

How much money one makes is his/her own business. 
However, if you charge a substantial amount, and a shitload of people come,
then yes, you are in the bucks!! But so what?

If you dont agree w/ that, then maybe a big mega-rave is not for you.
If you want to go and freak out and dont give a shit about who makes how
much money and you just wanna rock the house, then do so!

You pay more money for other things that make higher profit all the time.
Food, utilities, car, the computer you are staring at, etc. 
At least the gathering will have a huge sound system. PG&E don't got dat!

If you are jealous about how much $ one would pull in at a mega-rave, then
hell, throw your own!

and why does it only come up around Gatherings and Vision, and not the
ton of other $20 parties that show up, rip everyone off, and dissapear.
Because they have a reputation, because they are one of the few massives
that actually hold their own and stick around to be remembered.
Massives have always cost $20... that never changes.  and these $20
massives sometimes make money, and sometimes lose money.  That's just
one of the facts about a massive... if you don't like it, don't go to
them.  But stop complaining about it because some of us like what goes
on at these big parties, especially Martin's parties, and don't deserve 
the bad wrap.  I always manage to find an extrodinary vibe and truly
believe that overall nature of these parties is positive.  I'm sorry if
you don't see that too.

and to Martin's defense... Basics usually always cost $15... the "lousy"
one in Vallejo (compare it to a lot of other $15 parties and it really
wasn't that bad) as well as the one in Antioch (where I had a wonderful night).

If you must rant about the evils of money, please choose a more
deserving focal point.

Meanwhile, I'll be at the gathering enjoying the hell out of the night and
that mysterious vibe that's just so hard to come by these days.

take care,
-john.

Just remember to drink lots and lots of extra water!  Coffee is a diuretic
and will dry you out immensely, which is very dangerous if you're dancing
around and losing a lot of moisture through sweat..  It's hard to remember
that sometimes when you're drinking something anyway; sometimes you don't
realize that you're losing water because you're not thirsty..

	I think what a lot of people get hung up on is the fact that if I, or
most people here, were to throw an event, we would charge just enough to make
back the money we had spent.  To me this seems like the ideal case.  For the one
event I got to help produce, we didn't even make it that far.  I think we were
in the hole a couple hundred bucks, but who cares?  I think what bothers people
is that in an environment like ours, people have frowned on the idea of 
profitting off one another, then when someone comes along charging $25 bucks 
ahead, and obviously collects thousands of dollars, it should either be an
incredible scene, or else for a very good cause.  So what it boils down to is
does it bother you that the "commercialization" process is gaining a hold on
the rave scene, and do you want to do anything about it?
	Just my random rambling, your milege may vary! :^)
Love to all!!!  (WHAT AN INCREDIBLE DAY!!!!)

 Bringing some coffee to a rave is a good idea actually...wonder why
 I hadn't done that before...(maybe lack of a thermos I suspect)
 Before going out, especially if driving to the far-flung reaches of
 the Bay (like Oaktown), I often brew a pot to drink.

 Espresso at a rave is a nice idea, too.

 My couple of pennies...

 Oh, and just to chime in on the original topic of the subject line...
 All but twice I've gone to a rave I have gone sans any sort of
 injested or inhaled enhancement, and I still manage to have fun. :)

There are many "ravers" who are running businesses of there own, some are
self employeed, some are fortunate enough to be able to employ others.
Many have realized thru the medium of throwing/going to parties that, like
the Greatful Dead Scene, as we get older we can choose to work for "The Man"
or we can try to build some companies, organizations and institutions that can
employ, empower and nurture the principles, families and lifestyle
that we have come to believe in.  some of these companies are:

        Not to mention several organizations and individuals who need to
        go unnamed for various reasons, there have been ravers in the White
        House, ravers in state government, ravers in the phone company, ravers
        who own and manage property (that many ravers in SF live in), doctors
        lawyers, nurses marketing firms and yes even ravers on Police forces 
        (can you believe that :)

        I own one of the companies above, it is my personal goal to try to
        eventually employ as many people who have been enlightened by party
        going as possible.  To sustain my T1 and ISDN lines I have to pay 
        PacBell $1000/month and TLG $600/month. Not a small sum, I have to
        make a profit in order to keep the company going, if i were to make
        4 times the amount that I current make on v-site (it brings in about
        $2000 a month) then I could stop working my other TWO jobs and devote
        more time to this business (or maybe hire someone and create a 
        situation where another person doesn't have to work at Kinko's.  
        One of the problem's that all of the above businesses face 
        (except for maybe a couple :) is undercapitalization, that is, not 
        enough money to pay the rent and buy additional hardware/software, 
        hire more people, etc. So ask yourself this... 5 years from now
where                 would you rather work, for a company based on the
precepts of 
        (dare I say it :) Peace Love Unity and Respect or
        for some (multi)national like Sony.  If the answer is the former
        then how will these companies grow if they don't make substantial
        profit? If they need capital from outside then we have banks and VC
        firms investing in our companies solely as potential profit making
        items, these companies care little about the lifestyle, they care
        primarily about the bottom line.  If some of the "family" strike it rich
        then maybe they are in a position to help out the other elements, this
        is my goal and I know it's Martin's goal to some extent as well.

my friends and family,

it's so sad to hear everyone bickering about this money thing.
i unsubbed from my other rave list cuz that's the only thing they
talk about....bitch,bitch,bitch.

but if you need to get it out of your system, this is a good place to
do so.

i plan on posting a funny list next week of "a raver's little instruction book"
modeled after "life's little instruction book" by that one guy.

it was posted on mw-raves a few months ago and is pretty funny. anyway, i had
a story:
i got a kick out of everyone's shocked posts about Lucky Charms and how bad it
was. then someone submitted a list of the top reasons you know a party is going
to be bad. one of the reasons was similar to.....when the flyer is bigger than
a postcard you know it will be bad. i laughed because most of the flyers
that came out of Chicago are poster size. literally! and minneapolis flyers
are usually 4x9 or bigger. just a cultural difference? maybe not. chicago parties
have a history of being busted and having the exact same problems Lucky charms
had.  :)

then there was the time the ppl doing map point left for the party in Minneapolis.
at a stop sign, they were carjacked and many thousands of dollars (from the money
box) was stolen. the police were of the opinion that it was an inside job. none of
the dj's, lighting guys, sound guys, or any person of importance was paid that night.

amyp,

it's really great that you reached out for help because it can be really 
scary when someone you love seems to be acting so out of control.  As 
someone who used to act a lot like your friend, I can also sympathize 
with him.  It seems that certain people (like myself and possibly your 
friend) just can't get enough of that good feeling they get from drugs, 
to the point that they are willing to sacrifice their health, their 
relationships with others and their hopes and dreams just to get high 
again.  

It sound like your friend might be addicted to his habit in which case he 
needs some help.  The only problem is that he won't be able to accept 
help unless he wants it.  The best thing you can do for him is to give 
him -information- about drug treatment options (Narcotics Anonymous 
specializes in drug addiction of all kinds, is composed only of 
recovering drug addicts, no professionals or teacher types and helped me 
get off the stuff), love him, remind him that there is another way for 
him to live his life well and happily and wait until he's ready.

Also, E can be responsible for brain and nerve damage and at the doses 
and frequencies he is taking it -is- something you should be concerned about.

It's weird - it just seems that some of us can use and enjoy drugs and 
live a balanced life, and others want to get high to the exclusion of all 
other activities.  I've never been able to figure out why people turn out 
the way they do.

Good luck with your friend, and e-mail me if you want more info about 
treatment for drug addiction.

Jess

Martin throws parties for a living.  He doesn't have a trust fund.
He doesn't have an 80K job at Oracle, he doesn't have rich parents.
he has to pay his own health insurance, sel employment tax. Not to mention
all the fee for his events (can you imagine what it must cost to insure
an event like the gathering?). How do you propose that he be allowed to continue
if he can't turn a profit.  I can clearly see that most of these people have
never run their own businesses before.

It should aslo be noted that recent deaths related to ecstacy had been

depleted.
 There is some specialist advice group based in Manchester in England
who are probably on the net (somwhere).

One last thought about addiction:

Just because a substance hasn't been proven to have physically addictive 
effects doesn't mean that you can't be addicted to it

Addiction is a complex psychological, spiritual, possibly genetic 
condition.  The physical addictiveness of a certain substance has very 
little to do with whether or not a person will develop a dependance on 
it, or rather an obessesion about it.

I personally am addicted to sugar, techno music and lots of other 
things.  If I don't get my music or sugar fix every so often I find it 
consuming my thoughts and I find it hard to concentrate on other things until I 
have gotten some relief.  I have been know to leave a movie in the middle 
to run down the street to get some chocolate.  But see, I am an addict - 
an ex-drug addict but still an addict in personality.  sugar and music 
don't fuck up my life the way drugs did, so i've made my choice.

Subject: The Rave Scene -- Instant Replay of the '60's

I'm Bruce Eisner, author of Ecstasy: The MDMA Story. I was interviewed in
the current issue of XLR8R. 

I have a few comments about the rave scene that I want to append to the
interview and ask for comments.

1. It appears that the Rave scene is beginning to resemble the Rock scene of
the 60's. Big promoters with money interests are becoming the rule in rave
promotions, with only a few "special" parties for insiders lacking the
veneer of commercialism. This was true of the 60's. Rock started out as
"underground" and became "establishment."

2. The Levi Web site is an example of how raves can be exploited for large
corporate interests. Again, this parallels the 'sixties. I feel sad that
SFRaves own Brian B. is involved in this obvious exploitation.

3.The herbal ecstasy scam is another example of commercialization. Herbal e
is bunk, worse than bunk, it feels bad for many people and is unsafe. Yet it
is hawked by rave magazines, psychedelic magazines, rave oriented shops,
even health food stores.

I have also had personal negative experiences with promoters I won't go into
publicly. Suffice to say, as an elder of your tribe, with my roots in the
'Sixties, I say -- young man or young woman --it's time for something new.
The rave scene needs a transfusion or perhaps it's time to look around for a
new form to express your feelings of need for community and for the
experience of transformation. Pleae direct comments to my personal e-mail as
well as on the list as I recently had to go off the list because of a jammed
up disk drive.

I personally go to the parties these days for "community", dancing, the 
ritual of celebration and the lack of "commercialization" in most of the 
scene.  I have to spend too much of my day paying for computers, 
overpriced food, transpo and the like........ the "rave scene" is not a 
place I care to support that culture or that lifestyle.  I have met 
Martin on occasion and he does seem to be a decent enough of a fellow 
but....I'm NOT into paying $20-25 for a party.  So, I don't usually attend 
those.  I save spending that kind of money for New Year's and 
mind-blowers like Burning Man.

It's good that people are *expressing* their concern over prices and such. 
That's how views get shared and how other people are able to make more
informed and well thought out decisions.  I don't think it's  "complaining".
It's just a different point of view.  All perspectives are needed to make this 
community. It was probably people who didn't want "commercialization" to 
take over the scene who started all the great small parties we have now.

Same as it ever was... people were decrying this as a problem back in 
1989.  The truth is always less stark than a sweeping statement can ever 
capture - and in my opinion and many other people's opinions, the scene 
in SF today is farther from this than it ever was.  There are big 
parties, there are *tons* of smaller parties, and there are very few 
promoters doing this for a living.  Which is as it should be - throwing 
parties for a living means that your focus is on something other than 
having fun, incidentially with "n" other people.  The traffic on this 
list should make that obvious...

I feel sad that someone feels like they need to cut down folks for running a
company which employs quite a few people from this scene, and a company
without whom there would be no bandwidth provided for a machine to distribute
the SFRaves mailing list for you to attack me on... the fact that I had to
forward your message by hand to the list only adds to the sweet irony.  
Yes, you know, we do sit around all day and dream up ways to milk the 
rave teat to sell more jeans... uh.....

Tone said....I often bring a thermos full of coffee and find it quite nice and
stimulating.

I've often thought about selling espresso shots at parties.  Even just
plain old cups of fresh joe would would be nice wouldn't it.  (The drink
that is, not the Rice.  ;^)

Wonder how others feel.   Hmmmm...

one of those church-social-style coffee pots could bring one along sometime and

the wee hours.......  I'd surely chip in on that one!

I disagree.  No argument (actually, discussion) is futile here on SFRaves!
I thought this was our forum to discuss all the issues pertinent to our
community.  I am hopeful that what we are doing here is building something
special TOGETHER.

What I'm worried about with the massives is some promotors (_not_
necessarily Martin) growing rich off of exploiting our ideals.  And part of
that gnawing suspicion is the fact that, like Black Adder, I really haven't
seen _ANYTHING_ at a party that seems to warrant $25 per head (3000 people
= $75,000 gross).

I believe promotors will charge what the market will bear.  And attitudes
like, "massives have always been $20, just accept it or go elsewhere,"
simply reinforce our position as subjects.  Raving means, to me, ACTIVE
PARTICIPATION.  It is UP TO US to protest when we feel taken advantage of.
It is UP TO US to let promotors know just what is acceptable and what is
not.  (i.e. confiscating water bottles, overcrowding, etc.)  It is UP TO US
to collectively create a healthy, happy scene (NOT just the underground!)
And I think $20-25 massives are a NEGATIVE to our image and our personal
experience.  I do not believe that you ever need to charge more than $15
(please, someone provide figures if you think this is wrong).  And I don't
believe that we should meekly shut up and simply not go.  Let's always
SPEAK UP when we feel something is wrong!!  (And maybe, for example, I'll
be convinced that $20 is perfectly fine).

Some of you have expressed that you feel $25 is completely justified,
whether in production of the party, or in someone making money (either to
reinvest in a growing rave "infrastructure" or just for personal wealth).
Thank you for your viewpoint.  I think this thread has raised several
issues that we should think about as a community:

1) Is our proper role as ravers participatory/advisory, or is it more like
a consumer?
2) Is it acceptable for someone to make money from the scene?  Are the
values of raving and capitalism (mainstream society) necessarily
antithetical?
3) Can massives reflect the ideals of the underground?
4) Does there appear to be a growing, enduring rave infrastructure
(businesses, ethics, communities) sprouting from this dance subculture??


This is _our_ community.  Let's try to make it the best we can!!

Much Love, Nancy

If MDMA causes brain damage (IMHO, not proved or unproved), then Prozac
(fluoxetine) probably eliminates that effect:

    PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OTAGO MEDICAL SCHOOL. 1991 69(1):7-8.

BTW, for most of the studies that i've seen that claim neurotoxic effects,
the doses of MDMA range from 8 to 30 hits (10-40 mg/kg).

Now, there is such a thing as a reputable drug dealer. They are as rare as
gold, and should be treated accordingly. My basic policy is _never_ buy
from someone you don't know and trust.

I knew one guy that used to literally do NMR's on all his stuff. Of course,
this was at Caltech, where we all had access to the NMR machine, but it
was still pretty neat.

And yeah, these is some crap floating around at raves, so be careful.

I don't do this often! And as I said in my original post, when I do I 
take *one*..I'm not a complete idiot running around popping pills that 
have been prescribed to others in massive dosages...

I've been here all along, it's just the time I've had open to participate 
has been pretty limited, so I find myself on saturdays going through a 
month's worth of messages only being able to read certain ones... and 
even then when I find something interesting it's two weeks old ("Oh, 
that's *so* February!") so I usually can't contribute.  I'm trying to get 
better about that...

I have been a lot less active than I was a year or two ago, I admit - the
last party I went to was the New Year's Pacific party at the space near
Howard, and I felt so unsafe there I left after an hour :( I still admin the
list, and I'm still maintaining hyperreal deep behind the scenes (and taking
the fall for the bandwidth load hyperreal puts on organic's T1's - at peak
it's roughly half a T1), etc.  

Many of you out there who throw parties have probably formed a close bond 
with the people who go to your parties - to the extent that you might 
have a feeling of duty or responsibility to make sure they have a good 
time in a safe and responsible way at your parties.  Imagine that now 
translated to being an owner of a company, as I am.  There are 38 other 
people whose livelihoods rely upon this company succeeding - and if it 
comes to a choice between a Sunset on Sunday and finishing a proposal for 
a client who will keep us afloat another month, the latter usually ends 
up winning.  So, the time that I can spend usually goes towards 
behind-the-scenes work for this list and hyperreal - which is still 
tremendously rewarding, even if it is low profile. :)

I'll try and get out to Sunset on Sunday - I can't make it to the 
gathering Saturday night as there's another smaller event happening 
closeby :) but maybe I'll get to meet some of you there.

I think the thing that irritates me the most about this whole thread is
black adder's supposition that Martin's parties are a "scam."  Quite
the contrary, he's far more above board than not only almost all "rave"
promoters -- maybe only Lonnie of Ultraworld meets the same standard
for the larger party crews I know of -- but far more than most musical
event promoters *period*.  How many of those folks would be willing,
as Martin did, to give us a "peek at the budget"?  It was an eye-opener,
even for me.  Martin does it by the book.  I have never heard a complaint
about a DJ or lighting or sound or other person hired to help on his events
not getting paid or otherwise feeling ripped off.  He gets permits and
works with local police.  All of this is far more hassle than I would ever
go through.  Even if he was walking away with $10,000 cash after expenses
three or four times a year: (1) it's none of my business, this is not a
fly-by-night thing, much of his crowd is repeat business and who am I to
say they are wrong -- they know what they are getting and they *still*
spend the $20 or $25; (2) it's not all that much anyway, given, say, 
a 200-hour time commitment to pull off each party.  And that's what it
takes, when you add it all up, including not only the time getting the
permits, finding the space, lining up equipment, hiring people, doing
publicity, but the many additional hours of *promotion* necessary in the
scene.  And as I say, I doubt he's clearing $10K per event.  

Now, I myself am not a big fan of his parties but I am damn glad he's
doing them.  black adder's continued attacks on Martin's integrity go
against what I've heard of his work, and observed for my own damn self.
I'm sure plenty of things can be said to criticize his style, various
things he's done, etc.  But at the end of the day, Martin delivers what
he says he will.  It'
s not my cuppa, so I don't usually go.  I find that many who *do* report

they had a great time.

Isn't that enough?  Can't we leave this topic behind for good now?

  Though Brian's answer to the unwarranted charges of "selling out" is 
complete and needs no addition, I can't refrain from adding my own "elder

  The same was true into the 70s. Though the media and social pundits were
fond of singing the "sellout!" blues, in fact, the scene continued
unabated in many, many smaller venues. My own group, THESIS, played at
off-the-wall and out of the way places. But it never occurred to us to be
resentful or envious of the Grateful Dead or Bill Graham. They continued
to play righteous music and made huge bucks at it -- and why not? We felt
they had earned it, and glad they could be self-supporting and continue
the scene. But those of us who were playing in the boonies for much less
were also having a very good time playing the music we wanted to play. 
  When I went to the GG Park rave last Sunday, I flashed back on my own
experiences playing in the Park a long time ago. There was plenty of good
energy, people dancing and laughing and making friends. To most people in
both scenes, that's what the music and "vibe" were/are about. If you focus
on those who are trying to make $$ on the action -- well, that's your
lookout.

  In the 60s and 70s, I saw this same kind of armchair-quarterbacking --
"Hey! If I were down there instead of Steve Young, I woulda made a
touchdown instead of getting crushed by that 290 pound linebacker" says
Joe Sixpack watching the game on his Sony Entertainment Center -- and am
still struck by how easy it is to diss folks who are trying to make a
living at something they love, without having to go through the 1001
complexities of actually pulling it off. 
  I saw the same dissing-from-a-distance last year when some of the people
from Cyborganic spoke to a class at SFSU. Cyborganic's synthesis of
communitarian ideals and biz practice evoked outcries of "Sellout!" or
even "Treachery!" from people who had never yet tried, long-term, to do what 
they love and get the rent paid without help from parents. 
  So... I'm sure that Brian is pulling down $200 K a year, has an 
apartment in Paris and a Lamborghini named "Laura".... but isn't he, just 
maybe, doing us a favor by putting his energy into this list, the 
archives, the Hyperreal site....? 
  Come on, Bruce -- put some reality and some gratitude into your mix.

Now wait a fucking minute. I never, *NEVER* claimed Martin's parties are 
a *SCAM* . I feel that the parties cost too much given what I have seen 
of them. To put this whole thing in a "business" perspective because that is 
what this whole issue has devolved into(and I most certainly consider 
viewing the issue of raving as purely business devolution,) he is 
delivering a product, and I don't think that product is worth $25 *IN MY 
EXPERIENCE*. And I would tell that to anyone who asked.

You have no right to attribute words I never typed to me, and I do resent 
it, whatever difference, if any, that makes.

So what do you suggest Phred? I be blacklisted because I have a different 
opinions and am firm enough in those opinions to voice them publicly, and 
stand by my beliefs?

Understand this:

(1) I do not support any party costing $25 without some mitigating 
circumstances, put on by *ANYONE*  

(2) I do not apologize for this view and will voice my opinion wherever 
and whenever the hell I feel it is appropriate, rather the majority 
agrees with me or not. The topic is relevant to this list, and given the 
amount of traffic it has generated, of some interest. 

> Isn't that enough?  Can't we leave this topic behind for good now?

Go right ahead, leave the topic behind you. If you have a standard 
keyboard, it contains the "D" key. Use it.

I'd buy one!

There have been times when I've *longed* for a coffee -- would have 
probably paid any price too. Lacking it, I usually end up going home. 
Is there any particular reason they don't sell it?

The concentration of LSD found centrally is too small after "normal" 
dosage to directly manifest the effects of increased serotonin levels.  
According to more recent research, LSD-25 actually is a competitive 
antagonist to 5-HT at the 5HT-1A autoreceptor.  In human speak, this 
means that LSD prevents serotonin to bind to its autoreceptor, which 
normally tells the raphe nucleus how much serotonin is currently 
circulating centrally.  Because LSD binds with such high affinity, no 
serotonin can bind its autoreceptor, and the brain thinks there is no 
serotonin circulating.  As a result, the brain nearly all of its 
serotonin in bulk.  THus, the "pleasurable" effects felt after dosing LSD 
come from the brain's own realease of all of its serotonin.  This is why 
serotonin is so depleted following LSD (or MDMA) intake, and can be for 
up to six months.  This may also account for why subsequent LSD or MDMA 
doses have less effect than the 1st time; the brain has not 
remanufactured enough serotonin before the second dump.

 From what I've read, there have been no statistically 
measurable effects of long term serotonin depletion, but that doesn't 
mean they don't exist.  

Take care

I find myself staring in disbelief at the latest missive from Bruce/Bruce
Eisner/Ehrlich.  Talk about hit-and-run, passive-aggressive flaming.

I could not agree more that the scene needs rejuvenation.  Hello, Bruce!
That's old news!  It's the theme of sfraves since nearly the beginning,
if you ask me.  The difference is that we've all tried to do something
about it.  I'm not trying to puff up our efforts or this list or whatever,
as the old cliche goes, "just fact, not brag."  But 'tis truth.

As for the commercialization of the scene, well, heh heh, SF remains 
probably the best scene in the world that is *not* totally overloaded
with commercialization.  I am truly appalled at the changes that have
occurred in the UK since 1994.  Just take a look at any issue of Mixmag
or DJ Magazine and you'll see what I mean.  What happened to hip hop
here starting in the mid-1980s has happened there with house and techno,
replete with all the insincerity, faddishness, superficiality and
outright corruption of not just the rock scene but the "rap" scene here,
which trades on the indisputable authenticity and vision of the early
hip hop/rap pioneers to mint commercial gold for investors who don't
give a shit and "stars" who take their fantasies of fame far too
seriously.  All that has happened in Europe as well -- with OUR kind
of music providing the wallpaper for a gusher of money.  

But let's keep it in perspective.  Where parties the size of Martin's
could be easily found in the general media in the UK, where Pete Tong and
others are media supahstahs because of their ***national*** radio
broadcasts (and I have a fair bit of respect for Pete Tong so don't get
me wrong!), NONE of that can be found here, even in San Francisco, where
the "Friday nite mix show" is about the most media coverage any of thje
music we remotely associate with our scene gets any serious attention.

We are underground because we want to be and, quite frankly, there isn't
much choice.  Thank whatever deities you like for that, believe me.

There's an underground scene for hip hop and rock too -- but it's a lot
harder to sustain when everyone is deafened by the shouting from MTV
and Rolling Stone (who??) and Details and Vibe and Spin and all the
rest.  

Unlike England, where the commercial suckathon is in full swing, the Levi's
Web site doesn't bother me much.  The company has plenty of warts but as
big companies go, it's head and shoulders above almost all.  They gave
the project not to a Big Time Advertising Agency but to a small and nearly
unknown, nearly *underground*, startup.  My own personal opinion is that
the money-suck aspect of the Net is a serious issue we all have to deal
with.  Trivializing it by sloganeering like Bruce/Bruce did helps us not
one little bit.  And as for Levi's, Organic and Brian B, I especially
resent the statement that this represents a copout and a sellout.  Aside
from the cheekiness of attacking the manager of the very mailing list
this is being spouted on, it simply doesn't fit the facts.  As it happens,
I talked with DRC, one of the featured DJs on the Levi's site, about all
this just a few days ago.  She didn't think it was really that big a deal.
I don't believe it's that big a deal.  The site itself has some advanced
technical and creative work that most everyone agrees adds up to a pretty
neat URL in a sea of Webjunk.  Am I pissed because Brian is a friend of
mine and I'm standing up for him?  You bet.  But it's also because this
aspect of Bruce's posting is so shallow and unfair.  I'm *happy* when my
friends get well-paying gigs to do seriously creative work that promotes
a pretty decent product (ever worn and *liked* Levi's clothing or its
many imitators, Bruce??).  Hey, I'm as radical politically as anyone,
but this is not the time or the place that the masses are going to rise
up and play Smash the State.  We live in a context where, to my way of
thinking, getting paid for doing something you really like and are
actually given leeway to do without being hammered by a bunch of fluffbrain
marketroids is actually pretty damn cool.

Ya wanna crummy product promoted by marketroid fluffbrains?  Herbal E is
yer deal...  On that one, I totally agree with Bruce.  Too bad he can't
apparently see the difference between that and Levi's.  Big is (often
but) not (always) bad, necessarily, and small, nasty and greedy is to
be avoided like the plague.

I will say this: Bruce/Bruce is damn good at pushing emotional buttons,
especially those of us with roots in the '60s who remember that one of
the POINTS of that time was to state your case honestly and with respect
because the System thrives on bullshit, bad attitude and hidden agendas.

Sorry for the rant.  I just hadda do it.

:c bruce@mindmedia.com

peace out.

  [Scene: A ministry office in Whitehall. Michael Howard is receiving
 his weekly briefing from his top adviser...]

MH: Now, Sir Humphrey, what's the latest on the youth of the nation?
Are they still revolting?

HA: Certainly minister, quite appalling in fact. A load of idle,
unwashed, scruffy ....

MH: No, no, no Sir Humphrey. I mean are they still rebelling against
our authority? By what means are they expressing their rejection of
conventional politics these days?

HA: Apparently, sir, they are ''raving''.

MH: Raving, eh? Well I can't say I'm surprised. When you consider
the damage that we've wreaked upon the NHS, the education system, the
economy and so on, you would expect them to be pretty angry...

HA: No, no, no minister. I don't mean that they're raving mad. I am
referring to these new-fangled so-called ''acid-house rave parties''.

MH: You mean they're starting parties? This sounds serious. Do you
believe they may damage our chances of winning the next election?

HA: Oh no minister, I don't mean political parties. I mean party-type
entertainment-type, loud-music-and-dancing type parties. You know?
Fun?

MH: I don't quite see the relevance of that, Sir Humphrey.

HA: <sotto voce> I rather thought you might not, minister.

MH: I beg your pardon? Speak up.

HA: Sorry, minister. What I mean is that they gather together in
large groups, and play loud music, and all get quite ''on one
matey'', as I believe the current slang has it...

MH: Yes? And then what?

HA: And then nothing, minister. That's all. Generally they sit around
doing nothing, or ''chill out'', to use the trendy slang again.

MH: I'm not quite sure I understand, Sir Humphrey. How is this meant
to stop us from doing quite exactly whatever we please?

HA: It's not, minister. In fact, many of them are under the
impression that there is no need to pay us any attention at all. Only
the other day, Nigel <nigel.chaos@dial.pipex.com> was observed on
Uk-Dance saying

HA: One does ones best, sir.

MH: Indeed. So the so-called radical youth of today are under the

Good day friends and family!

I just wanted to say I will be attending Tribal Funk this friday.

Yes, I disapproved of the way it was handaled last time in Richmond
however, my very good friend Essence is spinning 10-12 and I want to
support(BP I guess).
I have been hearing him spin for the past 2 weeks at a friends house and I
can't wait to hear him for a full set - great stuff.
Also apperring  DONALD GLAUDE (seattle)
                JOHN HOWARD
                BUCK (strictlt rhythms)

info -415.905.4476

The only draw  back for some ppl is the location (The deli where ORIGIN
was) but I still will have a great time.  See anyone there? I will have my
laminate so say hi.  I will be up front till 12 to hear my frind.  :)

I have to work sat. night and easter morning (main draw back of waitering)
however,I still want to make it to the Gathering.  (I too haven't missed
one in a year.  I loved basiics and the ladt Gathering in December.  It is
at Home Base I guess.

Have a good weekend everyone....

Perhaps this is the crux of the disagreement then; your insistance
that raving be analyzed purely as a business product.  There is a
legacy of experiences people have had at raves that transcend
business issues; issues of inspiration, community, family, tradition,
friendships...  For many people, Martin's (and many other's) parties
have been, and continue to be part of a legacy.  Breaking down a
rave into it's financial piece-parts loses sight of such intangiables.
I could easily argue how many of our favorite underground parties fail 
miserably as "product", but I never go to raves to get my money's worth.

as arthur said, brian's reply to bruce's comments are complete and stand on 
their own, but i wanted to openly express some "new skool" thoughts on the 
matter.

first of all, because this conversation relates to xlr8r and bruce eisner makes 
it no more important for our culture than this same dialoguge appearing time and 
time again with regularity on alt.rave and any given regional rave list.  
however it does make it more notweorthy because the people and media involved 
are greater attractors in this community, and that's what makes me sad on one 
hand and happy on the other  -- that you can find more passionate, more 
thoughtful commentary on this age-old subject Bruce mentions among 15 year-olds 
on alt.rave or on any regional list.  it makes me sad in that i think bruce 
knows better than to make blanket generalizations more sweeping than the AIDS 
quilt, xlr8r knows better than to immediately turn their attention towards 
someone solely on the basis of their credentials and not the substance of their 
thought.  (i have not read the xlr8r article -- xlr8r is hard to come by here in 
Colorado -- available at one store nowadays -- but i'm going under the 
assumption the rest of the article follows a pattern of opinions similar to what 
bruce expressed here).

this is all that needs to be said ("same as it ever was").  commercialism, 
appropriation of that commercial interest, grass-roots organization, and family 
organization have all played important parts in the development of this global 
culture.  they each stand as a central element of this culture's past, present, 
and it's prosperity in the future. each has contributed positively globally, and 
positively or negatively locally depending on: where you live, how long you've 
been paying attention to this culture, your overall worldview, who your friends 
are, etc.

acceptance of all these elements (grass roots->big commercialism) working 
together symbiotically has helped this culture grow over 4 or 5 or 6 continents 
the past 10 years.  loss of the commercial interest in the scene is loss of an 
arm or a leg -- which makes it harder to dance.  loss of the family element is 
loss of the heart, and loss of life.

when i ran an email list entitled FutureCulture, i used to get accused of 
selling out when i was a source for media or when articles of mine appeared in 
any media that did not have it's roots within our small elitist circle we 
admired that consisted of things largely along the lines of Mondo 2000, 
Fringeware Review, bOING-bOING, that sort of thing.  

It's not selling out.  It's taking advantage of the resources at your disposal 
to give something back to the community and hopefully make yuor life better in 
the process. It's still community.

I've said this time and time again, but, when i first got onto the net back when 
I was a freshman or sophomore in high school and had an intense interest in the 
viability of virtual communities, Brian was someone who's example I followed in 
community-building.  Brian has done more to actually build communities then 
almost anyone, communities which have had a rippling effect in expanding rave 
culture, and net culture, around the world on and off the net.  

It bothers me that someone (esp. like Mr. Eisner) would blatantly slam *anyone* 
in this one-dimensional way.  Noone here is defined solely by rave culture, and 
I think Mr. Eisner conveniently lost sight of that diversity of the self.  To 
look at anyone on sf-raves as "Mr/s. Net-Raver Person" is a disservice to their 
other projects, hobbies, interests, and defining characteristics BEYOND the rave 
community -- multi-dimensional people in a multi-dimensional world.  I think 
Brian articulated well that his two interests that Bruce sees as being at odds 
with each other actually work together positively.  Most people wouldn't even 
bother to look back if they were in the position Brian is -- ideally everyone 
should be thankfull that Brian is still Mr. Net-Raver Person alongside his other 
growing and expanding interests.  We should all be thankfull that we all have 
that in common.

OK, Nancy wanted a review ....  so here's my review of ComeUnity...


I LOVE JENO (have I said that before?)  Let me say it again.  I LOVE JENO.  He
totally rocked the house, he was smooth and funky and never stopped, great music
and great mixes, the perfect combination. I could not stop dancing.  Then Simon
carried it on.  Then I had to leave (gotta get rid of this 8:30 in the morning
job!), but my friends who stayed had a great time all night.

Really, there was such amazing energy at ComeUnity this week -- people were just
slamming, screaming, waving their arms in the air, there were some really
intense moments.  I know a lot of people don't like the club atmosphere at 1015,
and it does get WAY crowded, but the music can be so right on for my tastes.

I saw Moonpup outside as I was leaving and he was on his way out because the
sound system was really bothering him -- fortunately for me, my ears aren't that
sensitive, and so the problems that he could hear with the bass and the system
weren't obvious to me, so I was totally happy.  

I always feel so blessed that I can go out somewhere right in the middle of the
week, and dance so hard!

You'll find me at Wicked hoping for more of the same! 

Leslie   :)

<warning - lurker posting alert!>

after reading this latest thread about 'senior ravers' informing me that the
scene is completely sold-out, commercialized, and not hardly as good as it
used to be, i'm reminded of why i decided to started using my delete key so
freely on sfraves mail.   from time to time somebody seems to feel the
need to post some comments to the effect that sfraves is just a big bunch
of cyber-whiners - and by and large, i think that's bunk.  i actually
appreciate hearing about parties that bit as well as parties that were
incredible, since apparently they can't all be wonderful and given that i
would much rather only be at the parties i'll enjoy!  (imagine that ...) 

but it's these 'grass was greener' postings that really are a downer -
what's the point?  if you were there, then you _already_ know it used to
be better - if you weren't, then reading the message is only a
bring-down.  wouldn't it be more productive to make suggestions aimed at
improving the current scene, or developing alternatives, or whatever,
instead of fixating on nostalgia?  save it for the couch, thanks much.

or perhaps the grass really wasn't much greener, and certain people need
to start having a little more fun these days?  an interesting possibility.

anyway, sorry about that ranting :)

NON-RANTING HAPPY COMMENT!
you might want to check out the shamen-arbor bona arbor mala album - it's
the second cd in the double with axis mutatis, which i thought was pretty
spotty, even given that i like the shamen a fair bit.  but that second
disk!  all instrumental, well crafted up- and down-swings in intensity and
drive - also i could swear i heard several tracks remixed to excellent
effect during the middle to late sets at chrysalis.  check it out!

 Well from my own expereiences at both home and at Parties, I would suggest:
1) Lots of beanbags
2) Lots of pillows- the bigger the better
3) Good lighting-dim but not too dark
4) Enough cool air either provided by open windows/doors and/or fans
  **** hey-without this part we couldn't call it a *chill* room;)
5) Candles
6) Perhaps a nice alter-ie.- the one in the chill room at Chrysalis was 
beautiful!
7) Last but not least- Loads of people to share the time and experience with!

                just my 2 marks

hey kids,

I just got a copy of Christopher Lawerence's (LA) new mixtape "Odyssey"
and I just wanted to share with everyone that this tape rocks!!

I think there is a deffinate "LA" sound in los angeles.  Recent tapes
I have purchased including Scott Free/Andren, and Thomas Michael all have
that acidy sound over funky and progressive beats that I can't get
enough of.

The best part of "Odyssey" is the incredible synth sounds.  This tape does
not rely on 303 for acid sounds.  Not that I have anything against 303,
it is just great to hear artists squeezing incredible sounds out of other 
synths.  There are portions of this tape that are truly awe-inspiring...
I know C.L. was spinning at Dune... and while listening to the tape this
morning I could, through the music, totally project myself onto the desert
at sunrise.  Those analogue synths slowly building up and coming down
like gentle waves of positive energy.  The tempo of this tape is what
I consider "ideal"... not too fast, but with plenty of energy.  There
is a good balance between "trancing you out" to get you into good mindsets,
and "breaking it up" to keep the music interesting.  There are a few
tracks on this tape that I am sure you will recognize as very recent
"instant classics."  

Now, I don't want to diss SF... but this is just an observation... it seems
that music in SF is just a little too "all over the place"... CL's
Odyssey has a deffinate continuity in the tracks... they all seem to be
of a particular style... a style that I, personally, find ideal.

*** Blantant Promotion     ***

this 90 minute tape is availalble by mail from Ken of Pure Acid Mixtapes (LA) 
for 12 dollars.

Phred, you are absolutely 100% correct. My apologies for flameage.

One word: Respect.

I have my own views and opinions. Others have their own. I respect 
anyones right to say that I am wrong, way-off base etc. I do my best 
to keep an open mind when presented with *facts* that contradict the basis 
of my opinions, and I am quite willing and prepared to discuss those 
issues privately and publicly. What this "discussion" has been about for 
quite some time is personal experiences and perceptions. No one can 
invalidate anothers experience. No one can say "You only thought you were 
having a good time" or any other such nonsense, just as no one can tell 
me "It was worth your money, even if you don't think it was."   

I have been noticing a very common trend here lately and to paraphrase 
this is it:

"These are my opinions, now would you shut up about the whole thing?"

Where does this leave us? Is any understanding created out of someone 
saying "these are my views, but I don't want to talk any further about them."
I find it disturbing. It's like those one-side arguments with your parents: 

Kid: "Why?" 

Parent: "Because I said so, now go to your room, I don't want to talk 
about it anymore!"

In my estimation at this point that person has closed their mind. The 
really don't care about understanding where the other party is coming 
from, they just want to play parent(per the illustration above).

I have no desire to do that. If someone gets fired up about something I 
say, or the reverse happens, and a discussion ensues about it, 
GOOD. Know why? Because they care about something deeply enough to 
express their feelings. Because they give a damn. 

To me this can form an important basis of understanding between myself and 
others of differing opinions. I want to know what people think, how people 
thing, and why they think the things they do.  

All that I would ever ask someone is that if you see something that you 
feel strongly enough to post about, try to keep an open mind, and please 
at least be willing to discuss your opinions if you are going to give them.
The thing that seems to be forgotten sometimes(I find myself guilty too) 
is that there are thinking, caring people behind those keyboards, and 
they have opinions too.

95% of my comments were made in a generic fashion, and I make them 
applicable to anyone charging $25 for a party. I will make a specific 
statement however, and this goes back to my original problem with the 
prices being charged: When everyone around (with very few exceptions) 
seems to be maintaining the price of $20 for their massives, why are the 
prices going up for parties put on by one promoter? Is it because costs 
are indeed going up, and eveyone else is just absorbing those costs, or 
is it that the parties have a good rep, and the market will bear it? 

Phred, I totally respect your experience. If you are not interested in the 
discussion, I respect that too. In turn, I ask you to respect my right to 
discuss my views with others in this public form, without asking for everyones 
silence on the matter.

        This is just the way things are.  The situationists c. 1960's paris
called this 'recuperation'. This is how culture grows and complexifies: you
have an establishment, which creates an underground which is incorporated
into the esblishment which then creates another underground. Rock, punk and
rave are all like this (though i don't think that rave culture is
COMPLETELY recuperated yet).
        This whole process is just a 'natural' part of how a chaotic system
like culture evolves: 'noise' is created to disrupt the current order which
is then reincorporated to form a new 'order'.  That's how humans learn,
that's how cultures devolop.
        By thinking that there is going to be some underground forever and
ever in the same way is pretty silly.  Rave is going to be recuperated, but
the new order will create another 'underground'.  You must know this, if
you were a hippy in the sixties and have ended up in this 'new' rave
underground, right? I'm not so much interested in 'protecting' rave culture
from recuperation, but appreciating ALL the things that it offers that the
'establishment' doesn't, with the knowledge that i'll be involved in a
DIFFERENT but similar subculture in the future.  I think that if more
hippies had been able to envision raving then they would have had an easier
time letting go of recuperated parts of their culture. Then again, this is
only my opinion and i'm only a 23 year old dork who wasn't even a glimmer
in my dad's eye in 1969 ;)

>2. The Levi Web site is an example of how raves can be exploited for large
>corporate interests. Again, this parallels the 'sixties. I feel sad that
>SFRaves own Brian B. is involved in this obvious exploitation.
        I think that, again, one has to redefine one's vision of what
'coroporate' is. A corporation in 1996 is very different from a corporation
in 1966. I think that there are actually money-making businesses that seek
to co-evolve with culture and provide just as much as they take from their
clients, and i see examples of this everywhere.
        I also see corporations as being more and more shrewd in terms of
marketing, to the point where the product that is to be sold is not so much
a 'thing' as an idea and an image. I took a look at this web-site. Ok, so
they want to sell jeans. So they want to use PLUR to do it. Do the means
justify the end? As long as we're aware that this is a business interested
in making money we can be aware of the 'ethics' of the situation but,
honestly, i think the web site is pretty interesting. I don't have a
problem with it in the least. If one stray net-surfer searching for a pair
of jeans learns more about the rave scene and PLUR and the information
presented is well-balanced and accurate, than i think it's GREAT. Yeah,
it's a marketing device, but then again so is the degradation of women :(.
All things are relative.

        I'm completely in agreement with this but i would also caution
against throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Understand what is
working about rave culture, what you love about it, why you brought
yourself to it, and use that as the foundation for something new.
        Don't fear the future. :)
        peace,

I have to agree 100% with Phred.........5,000 people parties are not my cup
of tea........but you can't argue with success....he get's 5,000 each
time....that say's something for his ability to give a decent
product......over & over.........now I take my hat off to ANYONE who can
oull off even a small vibe party.......It is no cup of tea.....that's why I
DJ and don't promote (gee, I should think about that !!!).......I say more
power to martin for pulling off the parties........I don't neccesarily
agree with some of the politics, of many promoters, but so what, I'm
entitled to my opinion, and If I think I can do better, I should shut-up
and just do it. 
 
If gathering or $25.00 is to much to pay, just look around, there are some
good parties going on.........It's about how connected you are, not in the
COOL sense of the word, but in the Vibe sense.........I have raved for 4
years in the bay area and I rarely go to large events.......(as a DJ or as
a attendee) 
 
I'm sorry I won't be at yet another Gathering, (iv'e only been to one), but
I asure you I will be having the time of my life at a smaller killer vibe
party.....you see, it was never about the size of a party, it's about a
vibe........ 
 
.........now I helped in a small way with the famous original Community
party held in Richmond.............and while it fell short of being 5,000
people it was one of the best large parties I was ever associated with, the
vibe was all about coming together in the name of healing and helping a
fallen brother. 
 
So if you enjoy a large gathering, have a good time, and if you don"t find
an alternative source of entertainment........I certainly don't go out
every single Sat nite to a club or rave...........only when I find a type
of party that turns me on...... 
 
like.....FnF, new moon, full moon, raindance, sometimes wicked, sometimes
roots, sunset, etc... etc... etc... 
 
I hope where-ever you go Sat, and whatever you do,................... do it
well.......enjoy the moment............and spread good vibes........moonpup

I also think that along with good lighting that Reagan suggested, I'd
include visuals (3-D imaging/motion) for sight and incense for a mmmmm

Has anyone ever used a Gemini PMX-15a mixer or have comments about it?  I
can pick up a new one for $100. And thought I'd ask. Also, are you able to
listen to the two channels at the same time. Hear both records at the same
time in the headphones. That way if you can't hear it to will in the monitor
you can at least hear them both through the headphones before you actually
mix. I forget what it's called, but I'm sure some of you know what I'm
talking about.

Actually, vigorous debate is a good indication of a strong democracy.  I 
wish I could find the quote where one of our forefathers said that a 
little revolution is actually very healthy - questioning authority and 
demanding a change to the status quo are as american as mom and apple 
pie.  Similarly, I think a community which constantly questions the 
assumptions it is asked to live with is a very healthy community - even 
if the issues have been gone around before.  So, I have no problem with 
people asking about the economics of the bigger parties or other issues 
that crop up every now and then - I do have a problem if people say "it's 
been discussed before, end of discussion".  That's no excuse, of course, 
for not exploring history... :)

If you take Prozac regularly and, I think, MAO-inhibitors (other types of 
anti-depressants), e will not work.  

Also, in scientific studies on both 
rats and primates, the number of serotonin receptors greatly diminishes 
with heavy MDMA usage.  Most are regenerated within a year, but there is 
still an 
overall loss.  So far they don't know what this means in regards to 
humans or the functional results i.e. possible long-term depression.

We are in complete agreement, Brian!  No one is born with any freedoms;
society gives them and takes them away.  We are fortunate to live in a
society that gives more freedoms than any other.  Let's make the most of
it!

Peace,

I probably shouldn't talk about Mad since I'm obviously biased, but I was
really happy with it this week. A great crowd and some nice tunes from
Alex, Takeshi, and Jon Santos.

Checked out Body Electro on Wednesday to see Freaky Chakra play - he played
some excellent downtempo tracks. Ran into Miguel from Single Cell Orchestra
there as well and was lucky enough to get to hear some new stuff he's
working on. I don't know when it'll be out, but he just keeps getting
better and better.

Went to ComeUnity after that - just when I though I'd met at least half of
all ravers in SF I go to a club and see maybe one person I know. Maybe it's
'cause it wasn't really a raver crowd - you could tell it was spring break.
I arrived at about 2:30 and it was still packed, but had a decent vibe and
1015 has enough nooks to chill in when the main floor gets too hot. Heard
the full moon went off nicely on Wed. night as well.

So is someone archiving all these Gathering posts so they can be
automatically resent to the list after each of Martin's parties to save
time? =)

I also want to thank Black Adder who has been very gracious in email
explaining his position a bit more.  It was not my intention to shout
him down or cut off the discussion; I still feel we've gone over all
this quite a lot, but the list is here for everyone to express their
concerns and insights.  

Just wanna make that clear.

I don't think that analogy is correct.  To paraphrase: 

A: "No party should cost $20/25".

B: "Most parties shouldn't cost that much, but massives, when done correctly
    (ie The Gathering) *do* cost that much, as Martin has previously shown
    on this list. 

Now personally, I don't blame Martin for not responding to your requests
for a cost breakdown for the last Gathering, he's already done it before
(how many big promoters would be willing to do that?).  It basically comes
down to whether or not *you* feel the parties are worth it.  If not,
*don't go*, you've got plent of other options.  That's it.  Lots of do
people think his parties are worth it and know that he isn't in it for the
money, and he has the rep. to show for it.  There are other promoters much
more deserving of that kind of criticism. 

Anyhow, you may feel this is a topic worthy of discussion but some of us
have already seen this hashed out like 3 or 4 times now and it's getting
old hearing the same complaints from the same people.  Spend a couple
hours digging through the archives, there's some great stuff in there... 

Just to clarify, this isn't intended to be a flame, just my take on
this... 

respectfully,

Andy

_I_ am the one who entitled my post the Gathering "Scam."  And that was
meant to be provocative - _is_ it a scam?!  Is $25 appropriate?  _Is_ it
allright to make money off of the scene?  _Do_ we as ravers have the right
to actively contribute to the making of parties, or just passively either
go or not go?

I used "scam" because I have felt CHEATED by these prices.  I wanted to
raise the issue to see what the community thinks.  Obviously many of you
feel these prices are completely justified.  I still find it excessive. And
I would still like to see more thought on the underlying issues involved.


>I don't mind a good tough verbal joust over these issues,


Discussion does not need to be "jousting," people!  It is not a
competition, a duel, a fight to the death.  It is a way for us to express
our opinions to enlighten each other, and if we feel similarly, take action
together!  It is POSITIVE and only HELPS OUR SCENE!!!  Everyone has a voice
and deserves to be listened to - let's not have this degenerate to personal
attacks!!


but what bothers

But many of us are new and have not engaged in this discussion yet.  I'm
sure EVERYTHING we talk about has been gone over ten times since the
inception of this list YEARS AGO.  But for the ones engaging in dialogue
RIGHT NOW, it is relevant!

Wishing all of you love and continued free expression,

People-
I must agree with this one. 

When I re-subscribed, I promised myself I would not post unless I had 
something REALLY important to say. So far it just hasn't been happening, 
so sue me. I am not afraid of this list or anyone on it. After reading 
Deepak Chopra's book: The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, I learned some 
things about myself and my own ego. Now I think very carefully about 
passing judgments on others, whether this comes in the form of 
constructive criticism, scene-building or opinions. 

Cut the lurkers some slack. Mebbe they just wanna have fun! If they don't 
feel the need to say anything, who cares. Maybe they like being quiet.

Dear Nancy, and all:
Does anyone on this list ever go to concerts?  Tix are usually in the
$20-$30 range, and hordes of people think very little of paying that much
to see a show.  Personally, I've gotten MUCH more out of the Gatherings and
some other "massives" than I've gotten at any concert except for Dead
shows.  I've never felt cheated, though, after attending a concert, no
matter how much money I spent (maybe I've been lucky).  It seems to me
that, when you're weighing the potential of a party against the price of
admission, you need to ask yourself what you think you should be getting
for your money, especially since everyone has a slightly different point of
view.  Can you compensate for a feeling of being cheated while at an event
by doing what you can to enhance your enjoyment, thereby succeeding at
getting your money's worth in spite of the event's shortcomings?
Maybe we can try to be aware, while at a party, of whether it appears that
everyone is enjoying themselves.  As a caring community, I think it makes
sense that we should try to help each other out in that respect.  On the
other hand, you can throw up your hands and say "This particular party
doesn't give me pure chewing satisfaction, not enough bang for my buck, so
I'm through with it" and there's no harm done.  Or, maybe you can see about
becoming involved in putting on one of these events, and get a better
picture of what goes on and why it costs what it does, then decide for
yourself if the price is justifiable.

OK, enough for now.  PEACE!

I know that there are mixed opinions concerning the life of Mr. Leary,
yet his influence on Psychedelic culture (and therefore indirectly on
rave culture) is indeniable.  This update was sent out today by an 
acquaintance of mine.  I thought some of the people here would be
interested  - Lee

-------------------------------------------------------------------

speaking of Good Friday and Timothy Leary...

perhaps a miracle is underway.  when I saw Tim the last week of february 
i thought it would be the last time. by his own quality of life 
scoreboard he was in the last inning. since he doesn't want 
to be
miserable or a burden, it looked like he would deanimate soon. 

by early march he could 
not walk, or even stand. from open sores on his belly and ankles leaked 
what we thought was the last of his life. he told a friend he'd 
leave in march.  the cryogenic tank to store his frozen body was set 
up in 
what was his dining area. (i call it the meat department). looks like a 
high tech tomb, momentos and playthings scattered about.

but he's also said, regarding cyogenics, "I'm just keeping my options 
open and at the time of my death I may decide to fuck this freezer 
business and have them stick me in the blender."

at a harvard reunion party three weeks ago, confined to a wheel chair, 
surrounded by loving friends, students, colleagues... a time warp... there 
was 
a most beautiful old dying man...  still can't describe the energy, the 
presence 
of that day... tearful, joyous, numinous... like a deep strong clear 
ayahuasca or mescaline vibe, 
similar to when a child is born.... death seemed near. he was existing on 
psychic force 
but he told everyone to come back same time next year for st patty's day.

he said at one point, with smiling sarcasm, "7 million people I turned on 
and only 100,000 have come by to thank me..."

two weeks ago, watching the academy awards... when his good friend susan 
sarandon won he laboriously stood from his wheelchair and tried to dance...

this past saturday night I arrived at 1:30AM and was shocked at what I 
saw. he looked five years younger.  strangely he was alone, but as usual 
wide awake at that hour. "Look at this"... he 
stood up 
from his bed, easily, and patted himself robustly on his side where he was 
too sore to touch the week before. took a long drag from the NO2 tank, 
then he DID dance.  "Well I WAS sick," he said,  "Now I'm only
afraid people will think I'm a fraud."

not to indulge denial but he is stronger, mentally and physically, and 
more joyful than 
he was five weeks ago... he is having a ball.... is dmt a rejuvenator?

early saturday night he was out wheelchairing down sunset blvd

sunday afternoon he was racing wheechairs around the house with former 
Dodger great Johnny Roseboro....

remember him on good friday, he could go at any moment, but he's not dead 
yet....

>planning to save $25 on the Gathering! :P).

Well, here's my $.02 ($.35 with inflation):

ComeUnity:  It started out with some really...well...bad music.  I just 
don't really care for a lot of vocals and disco beat.  I danced a little, 
but it just wasn't happening.  That about sums up the first 45 minutes.

Then the disco melted in the increasing heat and the BPM accelerated.  And 
the crowd got funkier and funkier.  It got bigger and bigger too, but it 
never got so bad that I couldn't find a place to stomp.  By 1am, the music 
was HOT!  I didn't go check the DJ, so could someone help me out:  Who was 
spinning at 1:30am and at 3am?  Whoever it was, was ON!  Also, dancing on 
the balcony between the mac daddy bar and the patio, across from the stage, 
looking up at the skylights: the reflection of the lights across the heads 
of the crowd looked like magic lightning underneath the waves of the ocean.  
That's the only way I know how to describe it.  It was BEAUTIFUL.  I'll 
never forget it.

Negatives: The mac daddy room with the couches and mirrors wasn't open 
(pout) and the basement was playing this horrible music at eardrum 
shattering levels.  That wasn't a chill space, it was a torture chamber.  
The only cool part was the acid visuals.  During an event like ComeUnity, 
the booths need to go and the bean bags need to come out.  The music needs 
to be more like the stuff they played at Chrysalis.  And it needs to be 
SOOTHING, not PAINFUL.  I went back upstairs and grabbed a napkin, stuffed 
it in my ears, and went back down to join my crew.  In the minute that it 
took me to do that, they had already decided not to spend anymore time 
there, and we went out on the patio to chill.  And *chill* we did.  It was 
freezing, but it was the only place to really relax.  So it was either dance 
or die.  Hm.  :(

One other negative:  The guy that spins the glow-stick numchucks - what's 
with the ego?  Does this guy think he's a star or what?  I like to take 
pictures of people at raves.  I don't take pictures of people chilling 
unless they say ok, but when people are dancing I've never had a problem.  
Especially someone that's so into grabbing attention.  But when I went to 
take his picture he got quite angry and stomped off.  Too big a star I 
guess.  Damn us papparazzi!  <heavy sarcasm>

All in all, it was ok, nothing special, but a good time.

Have to cut this short, I've got a meeting to go to...

i so agree!  i am also a "lurker" and i find sfraves to be of great 
interest.  and though i do agree that everyone has the right to state 
their own opinion, i feel that the scene is in no way"sold out, unless we 
choose to make it that way.  u create your own reality.  does this make 
sense to anyone?
dont fret! enjoy your parties--at least u have them!  some of us in these 
nether regions aren't so fortunate (oh, the blissfull joy of the 
ozarks--and yes, i wear shoes! haha!)
well, anyhow, thanx 4 your time

party is too crowded, hot, or smoky to dance, then I have to go home early
:(

For my two cents, I agree as well.  Regardless of how much money anyone was
making--if Martin or anyone else can get rich in this business, more power
to them--$25 was too much on a strict value-for-money basis, and I think it
would be too much for any event.  Of course that's an opinion that depends
on my own tastes, finances, etc. and if you can have a great time at $25,
go for it.

(Regarding the Dec Gathering, I was particularly peeved by the water
situation, which was inexcusable at any price.  The info expressly stated
"plenty of free water" and yet I was told several times by staff at the bar
and elsewhere that no, there were no taps available.  Apparently there
actually were, but I never found them and had to wait hours and pay
inflated prices for bottled.)

The Sharkbait Crushfest has been around for quite a while, five years at
least, though I haven't encountered it for two or three years.  It's always
involved a lot of television destruction (other appliances too), but I've
never seen people in biohazard suits doing it, just random audience
members.

Sharkbait, BTW, had an awesome set (sans Crush Cage) at the last Burning
Man, for those who were there.  They were the extremely loud, noisy,
pounding band who started up a bit after the man was torched.

Up to a point, I have to agree with Nancy.  I have no problem with making a 
little profit off raves.  That's cool; wish I could do the same.  For me, 
the point is, are the parties representative of the theme they claim to 
portray?  Does the party itself really promote love and growth of a 
peaceful, united community?  That's the message on the voice messaging 
service, but is that the message once you get through the door?  Or is it 
nothing more than a huge room with loud music and disco lighting, with 
security guards to treat you like gangstas and promoters charging $20+ at 
the door?

If what you expected when you went to the party was something more than 
that, if what was advertised was something more spiritual, something deeper, 
and the price was relatively high, I believe you'd be a little irritated if 
the  production values were profit-oriented and the theme was non-existant.

For myself, I've got different expectations at a massive than I do at an 
underground rave.  At a massive, I've come to expect a concert-like 
atmosphere.  I don't expect widespread raver attitudes.  I expect it to be a 
party with most people coming to dance, .  With raves like Chrysalis, on the 
other hand, I expect a very different look and feel.  With those 
expectations, I'm rarely disappointed.

All I know is I've had amazing times at the gatherings I went to.  If I 
couldn't afford $25 every 4 months for parties like these, I think I 
might put more energy into making more money.  Or I would eat a few 
more ramen noodle dinners to save some money from food.

For what I've gotten from the gathering parties I went to, I've felt it 
well worth the money.  If I didn't think so I wouldn't go.  I don't 
think I'd be into these kind of parties every week, but every now and 
then I love being in an enviroment with the kind of high energy only a 
big crowd can give.  It might not happen all night but when a big crowd 
clicks and comes together sensing the oneness of the vibe, sharing the 
love of the music with an incredible sound system, and getting to be a 
part of that, the joy and extacy I experience from that is priceless.

It was Jeno, Simon, Garth at approximately 11, 1, 3, I think.  It was
probably Simon spinning at those peak moments.

Hey everyone.

I pulled out my old copy of "Rave 'til Dawn" the other day, and I realized
how much I miss that kind of music. :) It took me way back to HS, junior
year. wow. what a rush.

Does anyone ever spin that old stuff anymore or am I living in a dream world?

I think some of you might be missing a very important fact about the last
Gathering in Dec. 95.
 One point of the whole party was to collect toys for the needy at
Christmas time.  It was blatently stated on the voice mail that the party
was 25$ if you DIDN'T BRING A TOY.  Other wise it was $20 if you did.  I
brought 5 toys along w/ my friends and I saw alot of people didn't.  I
think Martin could easily of charged $20 a person with no toy drive however
he was tring to give back to the community.  I respect Martin because he
works with us and the community to promote the good side of "raving".

See ya all there Saturday - got m=EE l=E5menate   :)

In fact, at the burning man last year, my friend Chris and I were the very
first two people to start drumming along with the Sharkbait. At the very
begnning of their show I went off to the side where they had stashed all
the hundreds of drum sticks an I got one of their road guys to give me to
pair. We started drumming on some old metal things in the middle of the
audience and a I think that a lot of the people there thought we were part
of the band! As we drummed along to SharkBait, the Lingam burned behind us.
It was a *total* blast!

i gave up a while ago reading thru the "gathering scam" and related mail 
as i have over 2oo messages to contend with, but heres an idea anyway...
IMHO:
i love teh underground scene and thats where most of my energy will 
continue to go, i think the gathering is a different kind of rave than 
the undergrounds we so well cherish, but still im many respects it is a 
*great* party, i think the fact that martin is working so well with teh 
authorities, and the social establishment, is giving *us* a wonderful 
immage, wether you support him or not. yeah, we are countercultural and 
oppose what teh establishment represents, but yet the establishment has 
the say in wether there is a scene or not - anyone venue hunting is aware 
of this. martins ability to throw good massives is a positive light on 
our scene. i hope that makes sence...

anyways, enjoy the wonderful weather.

positivity,
tom

Unsubbing because I'm gonna be off of work for the next 4 months (on 
medical / disability leave).

I'll miss all of you fine sfravers while I'm out, but don't forget 
me! I'll be back soon enough!

But prolly I'll see ya on the dancefloor sometime soon because 4 
months of no work means that I'll have more time to play!

Take care and STAY IN TOUCH!

I stated that my questions regarding the pricing went unanswered. Given that, 
my opinion remains unchanged. And the matter takes on a new dimension 
when I see people maintaining the price of their parties, and one person 
raising them. In that instance I do not think a re-evaluation is out of 
order.  

More importantly, many feel that I am striking out against Martin 
personally. For the umpteenth time, I question *ANYBODY* that throws a 
party costing this kind of money. I have heard the horror stories of Cool 
World and that ilk, and question their motives just as much if not more.

No, actually the issue has *NEVER* been hashed out. It had faded away, 
like so many other threads. If it had ever been resolved, it would not be an 
issue now.

Would like to echo Fret Coozer's post about what people are thinking about
Wicked tomorrow.  I am leaning against.  A LOT of people I know want to go
hear Harvey, so I expect that little garage is going to be packed to the
gills.  It's just not a fun "packed" space for me.  Why o Why did they not
have it at a larger venue?

Anyway, as anybody heard of possible venues where Harvey will be spinning
beside Wicked.  My friends from the UK all say he is super, duper tops and
creates awe and wonderment on the dancefloor.

thanks...

Have you read Martin's breakdown in the archives?
As far as parties are concerned it's more or less down to 
what you learn in Econ 101 "Whatever the Market will bear",
In 93 most Toon Towns were $20, the large event's were $25, then
at one point everypne refused to pay that much and a few large
parties flopped miserably, the price went down.

Wicked has only raised the price of their party by $2 over the last
3 years (from $13 to $15) but people still bitch about them :)
The prices of parties ebb and flow.

It has been hashed out many times you just seem to have your point of view
and want to stick to it, that is fine but don't get upset if people tend to
think of you as a whiner because of it.

Hey all!

My friend and I are going to the Chili Pepper concert tommorrow (Saturday)
night and I was wondering if anyone on the list was going and if we could
meet up with you.  Since both of us are rather petite females we would feel
safer in a larger group and the group we were going to go with decided they
didn't want us around for some reason or another.  So, if anyone is going
drop me a message.  I will check my mail at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow so please
reply before that.  Thank you.
               Megan             Czefir

You know, as a new member on this list, responces like this frighten and
discourage me from partaking in discussion.  PLUR?  R as in respect?
blkadder's honest opinion should never be called whinning simply because
you don't agree with it.

Subject: massives and prices.
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

When i attended my only "massive", it was in Toronto, I payed $18 and for my
money I got a huge warehouse with two giant rooms, lots of lasers and other
lights, a couple of giant screens with sync'ed video, and two live bands -
one notably being Orbital.

It also seems to me that when I picked up flyers and such, pricing for
massives seemed to hover around $20, with many events being around $15.
perhaps someone from the t.o. area can confirm some of these prices?

anyway, the point being that kick-ass massives can be put on at a decent
price for everyone!

note: all prices are in canadian $ as well. a canuk dollar equalling about
75 cents US.

	As you may remember from my intro I'm doing a video project on
house dancing.  Or, at least what I consider to be house dancing.  Two
months ago if asked to visually describe what house dancing is,
I would have shown a select few of the most stylish circle dancers.
My fascination with their attitude, ability and creativity is what
led me to become enamored with, and want to become a part of, that
select group.  Thus, I started scruitinizing their dancing, mimicking
certain moves and attitude, and eventually got caught up in the
whole ego-based performatitive thing that is circle dancing.
	What I've begun to realize is that circle dancers are only a
small group of ravers, and definately not representitive of the raving
community as a whole.  So, to call them house dancers is wrong, and
possibly a disservice to the community.  Their dancing is visually
beautiful, but hardly better than say, someone who for the first time
in their life has mannaged to break away from their insecurities, enter
into the music, and dance with abandon.  Is this what I should show
in my video?
	I guess I'm wondering what other people think of circle
dancers, and, if they can be considered house dancers.

Confused about this,
Krishna

Correction:  Unless Adder or anybody else approaced Martin with their
concerns, before posting to the list, they are guilty of lack of recpect,
decency, and honor.  Whiner is quite appropriate.

I have to chime in at this time.  I ALSO consider this constant bickering
about price whining, because it IS whining.  Simply put, if you don't like
the price, don't go!  If you don't like the promoter because he does not
live up to YOUR ideal, don't go!  If you don't like it that DJ's make money
when they spin, don't go!  Don't go if you don't like the fact that for
many this is one of the few ways some can make a living.

The problem is, this subject is constantly rehashed, right up there with
what is good music, what is too fast, what is too slow.  To me it is all
very, very tedious.

I don't know if Adder even knows Martin, or if many on this list know the
people they gripe about.  I doubt many on this list who make 'observations'
or aspouse an 'opinion' have even TRIED to talk to the person face to face.
History tells me that in general, they never do.  The reasons vary, but
all I can say is, if you can't say it to the persons face, then don't say
it at all.

Commercial, non-commercial (everything in SF is commercial at this point,
UG?  There hasn't been UG in SF for a couple of years now...)...who cares?

If you can go out to the parties you respect, that speaks more than all the
"observations" and "opinions" one could ever utter.  Martin nor any other
promoter should ever feel inclined to show any books just to satisfy the
few who would dare request same face to face (Where I am from, if you can't
confront someone face to face, you're simply a "punk", as in gutless.  Due
to being on the left coast , "griper" or "whiner" is appropriate.)

I think that one has much greater clout by saying "Hey, Martin's parties
cost too much.  I have talked with him about it and..."  at least you get
some points for approaching the person before talking shit about them.
That roundabout anonymous e-mail to the world crap, under the guise of
"opinion" is disingenuine at best, backstabbing at worse.

Is that respect?  When you talk about someone, but never make an attempt to
talk to them face-to-face?  I dunno, I KNOW Martin.  I have KNOWN Martin
for YEARS.  I have had in general, a good time with Martin, and have found
Martin to be a nice guy.  Oh yes, there are some things I don't agree with,
and I talked with him about these issues when it arose.  But I ALWAYS took
it to his face, like I take it to anybody's face who I disagree with
strongly.  If it's that important, the person deserves, out of RESPECT, to
hash it out with me first, before I go around with my "comclusion" (read
opinion).

I know Adder didn't call Martin's parties a scam.  I know the orignal
poster was trying to be provocative.  Adder was just adding his two cents,
with the same antagonism and vitriol he usually does.

To the original poster, try something new.  Try RESPECT sometime.  You got
a problem, take it to the source, then, if you could, let us know the
result of your ACTION.  Make yourself known to Martin and address your
problems with him before you get on the list and talk noise.  The
information you would then provide will be of some value to all, and would
probably be of some value to Martin as well.  I also know Martin will
address your concerns, even though he may not know you from Adam.  Of
course, he doesn't have to say or prove anything to anybody.  The man has
DONE his job! (he has brought more happiness, and more new people in the
scene, and made sure so many could pay rent, it's not funny.  He has help
raise tens of thousands of dollars for a friend, and helped keep this scene
alive with music.  There's really only one question to ask yourself,
namely, "What have *I* done?").

PLUR?  Just another slogan for people to use when the tenents of said
psuedophilisophy cannot be adhered to even slightly.  talk about
commercial, even the Levi's site uses this term now.  Now THAT'S
commercial. (IMHO - A captialist company like Levi's, inherently, cannot
subscribe to PLUR, since profit in our system requires the subjugation and
exploitation of people.  Mostly, people of color).  Don't talk about it,
just do it!

PLUR?  Some space debris that landed on this list.  Something present in
many people's minds, but vacant in their actions.

PLUR?  A term that reduces the complex problems of a diverse society to a
simple minded acronym.

Commercial party = Any party you know about.

UG = Any party you don't know about. <- rare indeed, epsecially on this list.


I do hope we can stop all this mindless bickering about who's real and
who's not, who's more commercial and whose not, whose better and whose
worse.  Whose PLUR and whose not...all of this is just another symptom of a
society in complete disconnect.

And the epitaph of the human race will read "They could've been contenders."


Done,
John

P.S.  Right on GeoffW!

To avoid flamage to this list, please spare me your comments of "Hey JSL,
wrong side of bed today?" or "What bug crawled up your ass?" ro anything
along those lines.  That shit is old too, if you're gonna gripe about me,
then please come up with something original.  To help you do this, out of
the concept of R E S P E C T, I offer a synopsis of my morning:

1 - I ALWAYS wake up on my side of the bed.  My wife is on the other side.
I love my bed, and I love being in bed with my wife.  I never wake up
angry.  On the other side of the bed is a wall.  I cannot get up on that
side, besides, I don;t want to wake up the Mrs.

2 - I had a physical yesterday, I have no known bugs up my ass.  If I *DID*
have bugs up my ass, they would surely die.  I eat meat on occasion, and
the bugs, simply, don't have a chance.  I do deal with bugs everyday, but I
cannot go into detal.  Apple pays me to keep my mouth shut.  Their dollar
has bought my allegiance to that principle.

3 - Intimidating?  Thank you.  I do not try, but I like the characteristic
usually saved for people like the Great Minister Louis Farrakhan, Malcolm
X, Martin Luther King, my Grandmother, my Father, Miles Davis, Angela
Davis, Bell Hooks, Alice Walker, and any other person of African descent
who dares to speak his/her mind.  I could only aspire to the aforementioned
greatness and will, epsecially in the face of this place, this United
States of America.

4 - Angry?  Not really, but if I wait two minutes, I'm sure you could drive
me to the brink ;).  No, I am angry.  Angry at the inujustices of life.
Angry at the apathy of humanity.  Angry that people talk the talk but have
a hard time walking the walk (hypocrisy).  Angry at slogans and perpetual
sloganeering that offer no real solutions. Like 1984 by Orwell this
newspeak says a whole lotta nuthin'.  Angry that there is a REAL holocaust
going on in this country, albeit slowly, against people of color.  Angry
that some of my white sisters, often times (according to polls at least) do
not relate to the struggle that has allowed them to contemplate the
struggle.  Angry that they have eyes, yet they do not see.  Angry that they
have ears, but do not hear.  Angry that they have mouths, but use them not
to solve problems, but to spite those whom they would never utter a single
syllable when face to face.  Angry at humanity for she squanders her
greatest asset, her children.

This world needs a high colonic.

"I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor.  That is my
dream, that is my nightmare.  Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a
straight razor, and surviving."

Well, IMHO, I would say "Yes" they are "House Dancers"........ but not 
the only ones  :)  Everyone in that room/wharehouse/beach (if you must 
label them as such) are "House Dancers".

  This could be an interesting nostalgia thread. The first rave/techno 
music I ever bought was jeno's *Inside the Mind* tape. Then I bought the 
Quadrophonia CD. In the early days, when I went into a record store 
looking for techno, it was a scavenger hunt. Most stores had no techno and 
had never heard of it. The few who had often filed the discs with rap, rock, 
new age or "etc." When I found a techno CD I bought it, because there 
were so few choices. Now the racks are bulging. I wish more outfits had 
www pages with RealAudio so I could taste before I buy.

I just wanted to respond to this and echo an overwhelming agreement to
Troy's posting regarding Christopher Lawrence and the "LA sound". It's my
first posting so let me introduce myself...Juliet...live in SF...finally got
a computer so I can have access to the list I've heard about for a couple of
years now!

Anyway, if anyone saw Christopher at Spundae a month or so ago you'll know -
not only are his mix tapes great (check out CONTACT also) but his live sets
are even better. My friends and I first saw him in LA opening for Josh Wink at 
Futurama in December and were more than impressed. Let's hope he plays more
gigs in the Bay Area!!

juliet   :)

I am not calling Black Adder's opinion whining because I don't agree with it,
I call it whining because in the face of blatant evidence put up before him:

        1) From the archives where Martin pesonally answered this thread
           some 2 years ago.

        2) From people on this list who are the epitomy of your so called PLUR
           who have worked for and with Martin FOR YEARS and have a very good 
           idea of where the money goes, this has been communicated to BA 
           both publically and privately.

        3) From people who threw _very_ large parties at the same level as
           Martin, who IMHO, I would stake my life on their integrety (
           not a idle comment for those of you who know me) have come out
           and mentioned their budgets.

        4) Besides the fact that I have known Martin for years, have gone to his
           parties, not gone to his parties, gotten in free and paid full price.
           I know, for the most part, how much is spent  on these parties and 
           approximately how much is made.  In the face of all of this
           it becomes apparent to me and other who have thrown both large
           and small parties that Black Adder seems to be out of touch with
           the politics and the economic climate of the San Francisco Event/
           Venue landscape.  Sure, if you cut corners and don't go through all
           of the hoops that the Establishment wants you to go through, you can
           throw a cheaper party.  That is not what Martin is up to.  I don't
           think _any_ promoter around has a better reputation with the local
           authorities than Martin, (maybe the FTT posse), if you have ever delt
           with city/state government in any capacity you will understand that
           if you want to be "legit" you have to do it THEIR way, which very
           often means you have to spend ALOT of money (anyone had their car 
           towed by City Tow recently).  Martin throws permitted, safe, LEGAL
           parties, these are expensive because the authorities know full well
           what takes place at these parties and don't like it one bit, one way
           that they make it difficult is that they make you pay large amounts
           of money for insurance, and city "services",  Martin is also a shrewd
           businessman, he, like some of the others, would like to turn a
profit.
           When you come to think of it, there are only a few promoter groups
           who ARE STILL operating on a regular basis, who throw LEGAL parties
           in San Francisco on a REGULAR basis, they are:


                Choices (Martin)
                FunkyTecknoTribe (Kevin,Jerry,Hector)
                Wicked (Jeno,Markie,Garth,Thomas)
                CDC sound system (Carlos Dutch)

          People always have shit to talk about all of these groups but I don't
          see anyone really trying to find out the truth, ALL of the above
groups
          are still around because they exhibit some basic intergrety to the 
          people who work for them and to the crowd that goes to their parties.

          Everyone who works for them get's paid (whether they MAKE MONEY OR
          NOT) which is a BIG plus if you've worked in the Scene for promoters
          for a while.  MArtin can throw a party and make a lot of money on that
          one party AND LOOSE ALL PROFIT ON THE NEXT.  This is a given  and
          anyone who throws parties for reasons other it being a hobby knows
          this simple fact.

	Your whole flaming post is based on the assumption that blkadder never
attempted to contact Martin, that he guttlessly started whinning.  Have
you been reading your email?  I seem to recall the blkadder saying that he
spent hours composing a personal message to Martin that was never
responded to.  Kinda hard to approach someone with your concerns if they
ignore your existance.

It is possible that the blkadder doesn't know what Martin looks like-

Out of curiousity, I went looking for that message.  Maybe I'm just not 
looking in the right places.  Could someone post for the list -- since this 
has become such a high-visibility issue <only a little good humored sarcasm> 
-- which message this was and where to find it?

Thanks so much!

Did anyone check out the party @ the armoury in modesto last night?
I had heard rumours of a pretty good lineup (of dj's) the week before and
fell upon directions at a cafe on McHenry around ten last night.

oops.  hi, my name is stephen X~) .  I'm not wearing anything right now Y~) .

i was dancing up front with a yellow yoga center shirt on.
great vibe, good people, even in the sweltering heat and blatent
exploitation.
they wouldn't let us bring water in 'cause they were selling it inside a 2
bucks a pop.
no chill space either.

Hi, all!

Time for my intro.  This is really a big step for me.  If the following 
seems superficial it's because I tend to be rather reserved at first.  As I 
get to know everyone here I'll likely become more vocal.  Soon you won't be 
able to shut me up :)

My name is Michael and I'm a chronic lurker.  I've been lurking for about 2 
weeks.  (Here's where the other lurkers in the 12-step program all say "Hi, 
Michael!")

I'm 28, though not very exposed to the "rave scene" (sorry if that soundss 
like a  cliche).  In fact, the only thing remotely resembling a rave that 
I've ever been to was this commercial thing held in China Basin a couple 
years ago (music: good; space: awful).  I've been primarily a club-scene 
person ever since I moved to the Bay Area around mid-1992.  Before that was 
a part of my life that didn't even have a club scene, much less raves.  As 
for clubs, when I do go out (which lately hasn't been very often), I usually 
go to Universe on Saturdays (there's a clue here :)  That's about all my 
commitment to my career will allow.  Unfortunately, this has led to my 
fulfilling the old adage, "All work and no play...."

So.... I pulled out my trusty web browser and went searching.  I found the 
SFRaves page and this list.  Heaven :)

I'm planning on going to The Gathering tonight, so I'll keep an eye open for 
people who've left their description on the list.  As for me, I'm 6'2", 
~210, blond/blue, mustache/goatee, sideburns that flare out and point to the 
corners of my mouth.  A friend told me I look like a gangster (just what my 
boss wanted to hear).  I'll probably be wearing something simple like jeans 
and my favorite bowling shirt.

If there's anyone down here in San Jose (I'm near 880/280) who needs a ride, 
contact me via any of the means below or here on the list.  I'll be driving 
a Toyota King Cab pickup, so there's room for 1 or 2 more people.

Love and Hugs!
 --Michael

Almost forgot the other distinguishing features: an earring in each ear and

I had a good time at this party, however, I was falling asleep near the end
so I left around 5.30 [(what can I say but it was a long night)Re:UnDruged
when ever I am designated Driver I stay sober for the evening :) - I was DD
last night].

Got to the deli on Jerold, just after 10 to hear Essence.  I could hear the
system down the street from the building a block or two.  Very loud.  The
sound was good but just too loud for that space.  I had to get my earplugs
for this one.  Lighting was done really good for this space.  Lasers were
very fresh and interesting throughout the night.  Not a whole lot of people
so it stayed very comfortable throughout the evening.  Tribal put a lot of
planning and love into this party, however due to cicumstances beyond there
control(a fight, takin care of some f*cked up friends) I left unsatisfied -
like I needed more - (Know what I mean?)

Essence was fun to watch.  He looked so happy back behind the decks.  Then
came Donald Glaude  who steped in with some funky break, jungle (here and
there) and some other abstract/house/weird tunes.  At 2 they stopped the
music to anounce the joinning of Chris and Trina in holy matramony - great
couple.  This stop of the music was sort of diturbing.  It kind of slowed
the energy of the party down, however it did bring everyone out to the
dance floor.

One thing that buged me was there wasn't enough dancers.  I love to dance
and that's what i come for but last night I got a wierd vibe from alot of
people.  It seemed many people were just waiting for some one to say "o.k.
you can all dance now!"  I say just dance and have a good time and not
worry about anything or anyone else.

Well Buck came back with some sick trance and I couldn't stop moving to his
funk.  Where's he been?  Does anyone know?  I remember him from a year or
two  back but I haven't heard him lately.  Essence came back for about
10min. to kill some time - get some people out of there trance and John
Howard came next.  Soon after I left.  All my close friends were there and
it was good friday night party.

My final Bitch:  The owners of this space.  They suck. Period.  Exploting
the ravers all around.  I was told twice not to fill my water back up in
the sink - I didn't want to pay $2 for a Crystal Geyser.  $1.00 candy bars
- I was sooo hungry I had to buy something, and the last straw - I wanted
to get a friend another tootsie pop cuz hers droped on the floor.  I asked
the lady for two and she said: $2.  $1.00 a piece for a stinkin' tootsie
pop.  I tried to barg with this lady.  Saying I had already purchased a
water and 2 candy bars, and all I wanted was 2 lolly pops 4 a buck.  She
said "We have to make money.  There is no other place to go. Right? $2 for
those, no deals."  Bitch.  I don't want to go back to this place again
unless I really can't help my self.  nuff said

Sorry i cant make it to the Gathering - gotta work late.  Have fun everyone.

One who always has a good set, Simon was on from 1-3(approx) and it was some
of the best music I've heard in a while (anyone know if he'll be selling it
as a mix tape?)...the vibe was also one of the best ComeUnity vibes in a
long time (maybe because it was less crowded than it's been in a long time). 

Garth's first hour was OK, but we wanted to keep dancing and he slowed it
down so much he put us to sleep! We tried for a while but the beat wasn't
there so we ended up sitting till it was over at 5. If people want slower
music there's always the chill room - why can't there be dance (house) music
in the main room so people can have a choice? We were literally forced by
the music to stop dancing and sit!

Overall a roaring good time-even though work at 9AM was a little too early.

Yes I have, black adder tried to contact Martin via e-mail.  Being artin'sservice
provider,  know he reads his mail seldom (too seldom) plus if I were Martin,
I would not answer any such inquiry form someone ovwer the net that I have never met.

Maybe but research can be done, do you know what Martin looks like? Maybe yes,
maybe no, but you girlfriend Mellissa knows what he looks like and you can ask her,
Black Adder if you don't know Martin, I will be glad to introduce you two at the
next opertunity that you are both at the same party.

What you and others fail to understand is that e-mail is NOt the same as
face to face communications.  Simple as that.  You have to communicate with
people the way they are accustomed to.  I have always found it easier to
talk to someone face to face, rather than e-mail.  It may be fine for you,
but it may be inefficient to others.

And YES, I read the mail saying HOW Adder communicated.  If you read MY
message correctly, the emphasis was on face to face communication, not
e-mail.

The rest of your characterizations of my mail are rather moot.

So he could ASK someone.  Or maybe even attend his party.  Look stop making
excuses for people, and ask that at least people should really try to talk
to someone instead of all this vaporous e-mail blather.  He could get
Martin's number and talk to him on the phone.  Ask for Martin's number, or
leave HIS number with someone who knows Martin.  There ARE REAL avenues
that exist for more 'real' conversation.  BlkAdder and others just cannot
sieze or even consider the many possibilites or opportunites available.

Besides, he didn't say that he got in touch with Martin face to face.  So I
knew from his message how he communicated (or tried) to Martin.

Reading is fundamental.


>> Adder was just adding his two cents,
>> with the same antagonism and vitriol he usually does.
>

>Personal vendetta against the blkadder?

Personal vendetta agianst his angst, his attitude, and many of his posts.
I usually keep quiet, but since someone who I consider a friend is being
maligned, I decided to speak up.

As for vendetta, moot.  I don't know him well enough to have a vendetta
toward him.

This is tedious.

If you knew how to relate to people, or even read the post, it was a jibe
against Levi's and aginst the aqusition of PLUR by anyone.  The word has

It's always amazing how what we think about something is changes the more we
know about it -- dancing is the most important form of self-expression in my
life -- and I thing our entire world would change if only everyone allowed
themselves to dance ....  it opens your heart, your mind, your chakras, it
triggers your body's health and immune systems, and IT MAKES YOU HAPPY!

I love to watch and learn from dancers, I'm always amazed that EVERYONE DANCES
COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY - just like no two people are physically identical, no
two people move their bodies the same --- And I watch the evolution of how
people dance -- it's not just changing styles, although that's one element --
it's also that, as people become more open with themselves, more confident, more
able to reach that "trance" state where the mind gets quiet and the body moves
on its own, more skilled at rhythm and motion -- then their dancing changes to
reflect their own growth --- 

I have one friend who started raving about 1-1/2 years ago, and he was
ex-military, had always been a very controlled person -- his "dancing" them was
very simple, small movements, stepping and swaying to the rhythm -- now he's
much more open, fluid, free with his movements -- you'd never find him in the
middle of a circle, but I love to watch him because he's now freely expressing
himself.  I can't wait to see how he dances a year from now.

Are circle dancers house dancers?  Of course -- but circle dancing is more about
style and skill, showing off your most extreme and outrageous moves, watching
and being watched and appreciating other people's dancing.  I like to see it,
because it's like the difference between being an artist and hanging your work
on your walls at home, and having a big opening at a gallery.  It's a public
display of your self-expression through dance.

However, only a small percentage of dancers circle dance -- they're almost
always people who know each other, and they're dancers who throw themselves
full-out into a minute or two of frenetic expression, then take a break while
they watch the next dancer -- they're also usually guys, and most often they're
not ravers, they're more like street dancers.  So most of the great dancers will
never be found in a circle, but a lot of circle dancers are well worth watching.


Hmmmm....   a long rambling dissertation?  Dancing is everything to me, and I
have lots of thoughts and observations about it.  See you on the dance floor!

. . . so it's not $25.

Much love and respect for all who expressed their views on the subject of
money, commercialism & raving (even those who let it get a wee bit personal
for the list IMHO).  This subject will unfortunately come up repeatedly
given our society, and even though SFR may have discussed this before,
times and people and perspectives evolve.  Raving doesn't come for free --
financially or otherwise -- but it's a given that more expensive parties
will exclude a certain part of our family, even if they deliver in terms of
sound system, djs, visuals, and smart organization for those who are there
(the vibe factor not able to be purchased, of course).

My batteries are recharged and I've decided to go tonight, with eyes open
as to what goes on at a massive.  At some point in the chill room the
kaleidoscopes will make their appearance.

peace,

jonathan

p.s.  what a beautiful day  :)

Geeeeeeezzzzz.....   what is up with all of this vitriolic caca coming through
the wires about massives and all of the other issues that have been unearthed?
I feel like I've slipped into some slimy muck and everywere I look another
creepy crawly is coming out...

A couple of points, if I may:

1.  Everyone is entitled to express their opinion -- even if it might reflect on
someone you know, or don't know, or wish you knew, or whatever. 

2.  If someone thinks $25 is a lot to go to a party, that's ok, isn't it?  I
mean, IT IS A LOT no matter what that money pays for!  It's a lot to me, and I
have a good job and income, so I know it's a lot to a student on a limited
budget.  Isn't that a fact?

3.  I don't know Martin.  Never met him, probably never will, have no opinions
on his business acumen or integrity or anything else.  Blank slate.  However, if
I had an opinion about one of his events, I'm entitled to it, and I'm entitled
to share it here on SFRaves.  That's what we do here, express our opinions.  I'd
hope not to be flamed for expressing myself here instead of in whatever way
someone else thought I should, and certainly would hope not to be criticized for
not having a personal conversation with someone I don't even know.

4.  If we don't want to spend $25, we have that choice.  Duh.  We can still
question the reasons, can't we ... why do I have this weird sinking feeling that
the same people who say "question authority" somehow think that only means
certain types of "authority"?

5.  Making money is NOT WRONG!!!!!! I think it's great when parties are
profitable to the people who put themselves on the line to put them on.  What's
wrong is ripping people off.  As a businessperson, I get really worried when I
see so many young people associate financial success with evil.  I would like to
wish for each and every one of us that we all make huge and copious amounts of
cash for doing whatever it is that we love and that makes us happy, without
exploiting other people.  And employing people to help you do you business is
not exploitation.  There are good big companies and bad little companies, and
the difference is in their values, not their profit statements. If you walk
around with an "us and them" mentality about business, or politics, or whatever,
you're never going to make the transition into a position of have the power to
effect change in the world.

Anyway, may I suggest that some of the recent threads have been more appropriate
for a personal post rather than the whole group?  I also second SDream's request
that someone pull out that archive, and send us a copy of Martin's note from 2
years ago ... now that the can of worms has been opened, I'm curious to see
what's inside......

Respectfully,    Leslie   : )

Hello All,

I just wanted to wish you all a great weekend.  I'm stuck in Fresno 
working the whole time, but thinking of you all none the less.  I'm 
listening to the new Keoki CD I bought a couple of weeks ago.  Guess 
that's about all of the rave scene I will be exposed to this 
weekend...hehehehe  :)

Anyway, I hope you all enjoy the Sunset boat party (thanks again Leslie 
for offering to pick up my ticket), and also The Gathering.  BTW, I went 
to the last Gathering and had an excellent time.  I do agree 25$ is a lot 
to pay, but it's a definite choice that one can make.

Looking forward to seeing all of you soon.  Have kind of written off 
going to Harmony, but now that I'm writing this message I realize that I 
want to come see you guys.  I'll work on my schedule.

Hugz to all,
Marty

p.s.  Drink your water and take your vitamins this weekend  :)

I did not join sfraves to incite this kind of anger.  All I was

I feel really bad for being a part of this war.  Please forgive me if this

Having just logged on and read even more of this ridiculous name-calling stuff
and obnoxious behavior .... I would like to **respectfully** ask that you guys
KNOCK IT OFF!!!  PLEASE!!! NOW!!!

Excuse me if I'm missing something, but to me it's nasty, it's personal, it's
extremely unpleasant,it's making my stomoach turn, and the OTHER 438 people or
whatever probably would also feel a little happier without reading this crap...


May I suggest that the next time one of us (any of us!) starts to feel our
hackles being raised by whatever (insults to our right to blow a whistle,
insults to our close personal promoter friend, insults to our mind-alteration of
choice, whatever) ... we try to compose a message that does NOT include the word
***YOU***.  

Because when it comes right down to it, we only have a right to write about our
own opinions, thoughts and feelings, ...  where the written word disintigrates
is when we get these emotion-filled posts that say...   what YOU don't
understand is ...  what YOU always say is ...   what YOU should do is...  (and
how lovely to end with such a poetic new PLUR acronym translation, that just
made my day - not)

And, please consider leaving the whole list out of your cyber-brawl -- because
it's really not appropriate.

Frankly, I'm pretty offended by the language and the nastiness in these last
threads.... this is nat SFR is about..... 

Trying to shake the stuff off my shoes so I can dance tonight....

My understanding of the 'Life on Jupiter' story is that it was concocted 
by a scientist (which is why it was so believable) on April's Fools Day 
in honor of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds broadcast.   --Maureen

I will neither be told nor dictated how to conduct my communications.  If
someone attacks one of my friends, I will respond in kind.  With facts, not
fiction, libel, or slander.

As for the suggestions, I guess that's what we need, even MORE rules about
how we are to communicate & live.  I think we have enough rules.

You is very effective and useful, less one draw grand conclusions based on
generalities.  If I have a gripe with a person, then it will be them, it is
only proper to use YOU in these cases.  Not everything can be painted beige
for easy digestion.  And the fake civility, when one os really mad or
upset, is even more phoney.  Say what you mean, mean what you say, and
accept the consequences of your actions/inactions.

"It is better to live on your feet, than die on your knees."

(I wish she just would've said JSL said or something, instead of the vague
references...I bagged on PLUR.  I think the written word degenerates when
people use useless commerical acronyms, or are so vague as to defy
description.  I don't want tasteless bleached bread, I want jerk chicken
and wheat bread.  The stuff of life.)

I am basically sick of seeing PLUR, PLUR, PLUR everywhere as if it was some
mantra.  But if you or others want to continue doing so, please go ahead.
As much as I am sick of seeing it, I feel little need to respond to every
incidentthat mentions the now near-mythic PLUR.

The problem is one should be able to differentiate opinion from blatant
accusation.  For instance, you did not cite the original title of the
thread which said "The Gathering Scam".  This is not a statement of
opinion, but slander against someone.  It would be one thing to say
"Gathering charges too much money."  since that is very subjective.  But
saying that someone is pulling a scam is a completely different animal, and
is slanderous at best.  I and others, took offense.  Especially those who
KNOW Martin or those who have been to enough of his parties to know.

Once again, this PLUR thing, if it was in effect, which it is not in the
case of the start of this thread, would not have started all of this
upheaval.

In any case, this list is not only about your ideals, but about other
people's ideals as well.  We are communicating.  The history of this list
shows that people can be really steamed up, and then , all told, get back
together as if things never happened.  Shit flares up sometimes, and it
subsides.  Just the natural pattern of the list.  The archives are my proof
of this theorem.

>
>And, please consider leaving the whole list out of your cyber-brawl -- because

When a public accusation is made, it deserves to be answered in public.
Sorry if this affects you in the negative if the discussion is not all warm
and fuzzy.  Life ain't smooth all the time.  If you don't like what you are
reading, you can excersize the option of NOT reading the thread.

you always have that choice.

>
>Frankly, I'm pretty offended by the language and the nastiness in these last

I took offense at the very fist slanderous message.

How did you determine what SFR is about for all 400 or so people who are on
the list Leslie?  SFR is one thing to you, and others may certainly share
your view, but it may very well be differnt things to others you do not
know.  Do you know all of the 400 or so people on the list to make draw
that conclusion?  In any case, SFR is many things to many people.  The only
universal I can apply to SFR is a medium of communication centered around
dance culture.  But it is not just & only about that.  We live in a larger
world, and that world seeps in from time to time.  For the better IMO.

Hi!

  I think this is a good spot to make my pitch --- As some of you may 
know, I sometimes do ambience at parties as Dionysus Dreams. I always 
like to think of what I do as a multi-media, enviromentally interactive 
artist. I DJ (CDs mostly), perform live music and soundz, create visual 
enviroments,  and invite 
people to participate with me in the creation of some incredible public 
art forms that are very ephemeral yet very deep in their lightness. In 
responce to Cassandras's posting I find myself in deep agreement. I 
really am not so happy when chill rooms turn into trip-hop, trance, 
whatever dance rooms (although a short taste now and athen can be tasty). 
I really strive for a beatless (mostly) atmosphere sound that blends with 
the ambient room sound rather than forcing  (this may be an exageration 
of others efforts) the vibe. My rooms evolve and grow and continue to do 
so long after the party is over.
 I try very hard to be the yin to the yang of the kinetic energy on the 
dance floor. Now I like the trip hop and trance stuff Enourmesouly ;), 
however I thing any decent rave needs an ambient room that is peaceful 
enough to nap, have heavy cuddles, socialise and more  =).
  I would like to encourage others to communicate their desires for rooms 
like these at any given event.
  Oh yea, I'm performing at Harmony on April 12th. Please come by and say 
hi! I have a brown pony tail, a blond imperial, and a nose screw. I think 
I'm doing lights as well and I will be performing earlier on, I have to 
be at work at 8:00 am the next day ;(

        Anybody going to the Gathering?

        As you know most DJ's spend way too much money on records to afford
a car.

        Three examples are Josh, Jon Williams, and ambient honcho
Darkhorse, who all live in the Haight area and don't have a ride to the
Gathering tonight.

        If any one, two or three (cos there are five of us) people could
help us out, we should have three places on the list for your trouble. We
are all playing between 3 and 6 a.m.

        If you have any room, please give Graham or Jon a call on 415 626 7707.

        Thanks

ok. i just read over all "The Gathering Scam" thread.
blkadder never slandered martin, the only mention of martin he made was that
he emailed him and got no response. everyone just started jumping into the
fray, making assumptions and reading things into the thread that were never
there in the first place.
the essence of the thread was "$25 is too much to pay for a party", not
"martin is trying to rip us off". 
i know everyone here is a mature individual. just look back at the thread
and try to find where these misunderstandings took place. there is simply no
reason for this flame war - yes, i believe, judging from the last few posts,
that it has aspired to that status - to continue.
also, remember that this list is provided as a free service by someone who
has to pay for the bandwidth. it's somewhat irresponsible to thank that
generousity by chewing up their bandwidth with a flame war. intelligent
discussion certainly has a place on the mailing list, senseless aggression,
on the other hand, does not. so, let's all be rational about this and cease
the hostilities.
and on a related note: remember that organic (it is organic that hosts
hyperreal, correct?) has to forward each piece of mail you send to the list
400+ times. i think we owe it to organic to be as bandwidth-friendly as we
can be. not that this means that you should truncate what you are going to
say, only that it's a little wasteful to quote and entire message only to
add 3 lines at the bottom. although, in a situation where misunderstanding
could take place, quote as often as you can to reduce the likelyhood of
misunderstandings.

peace everyone.

ambient space had couches and cushions but no music.  The other dance area 
had good music, but only a handful of people were dancing there.  At one 
point, I even had the whole room to myself.  About an hour after we got 
there, the police showed up, then the fire marshall.  Something about 
permits.  The population on the inside diminished as the population stopped 
at the door while trying to enter increased.  We left.

Tribal Funk:  After the fiasco at Good, anything would have been an 
improvement.  I was not hopeful though, since this rave took place at the 
same place as the Origins rave on March 9th.  The Origins rave was hot (it 
felt like it was over 100 degrees, 100% humidity), packed to the point of 
being a death trap in the event of a fire, and overpriced at $20 in light of 
the ok music, weak visuals, and poor lighting.  Well, again, I was wrong -- 
Tribal Funk was ON.  The lighting was well coordinated, laser included, and 
the music laid down by Donald and Buck was stupendous!  A little loud -- I 
had to get a napkin and fashion some earplugs.  I chatted just briefly with 
Donald -- helluva nice guy!  

Cool moment: Looking down from the 2nd floor railing.  Donald throws some 
great break beats, then does a build up and slams into some truly funky hard 
beat.  He throws his arms open to the crowd and everyone goes nuts...

Security was coooooool.  Really nice guys, *very* professional, but friendly 
just the same.  The crowd wasn't very thick, all things considered, but I 
didn't mind at all.  There were enough people to call it a rave, and I 
danced all over the place.  I had good friends with me, made some friends 
while I was there, and boogied my bootie off.  Did more dancing upstairs 
than down.  And there was NO HEAT!  Fans and A/C were in plentiful supply.  
Security wouldn't let you fill up your water bottles, but then they didn't 
try too hard to enforce that either.

A quick warning about the space on Jerrold: The folks that run the deli come 
in two flavors, thieves and closet nice people.  The thieves are the ones 
that will charge you an ungodly amount for water (and anything else from 
what I've heard) and they're the ones that tell security not to allow anyone 
to fill up their water bottles.  The closet nice people appear to be more 
thieves, but when no one's looking, they'll cut you a quick and cool break.  
One time, the guy behind the counter looked around, took my bottle, and 
filled it with wonderfully cold water at the sink behind him when the boss 
wasn't paying attention.  Don't count on that kind of treatment though...

One bad thing:  This is the first rave I've been to where a fight broke out. 
 Some big burly white guy with a shaved head and a long stringy goattee was 
involved.  I've seen him around at other raves.  I don't know what his story 
is, and I'm not trying to say the fight was his fault, but he always looks 
pissed off -- a regular walking negative vibe.  He was trying to mix it up 
with some folks.  I didn't see how things got started, but security 
surrounded him and encouraged him and one other guy very quickly -- and 
rather peacefully, actually -- to exit the building.  It was over in half a 
minute.  More kudos to the security guards.

<yawn...>  Well, my hamstas are sleeping, and I think I'll follow suit...

But at what point to you say to yourself "Gee self, I sure am getting 
sick of ramen noodles? $25, $50, $100 ? At what point do you say enough 
is enough, without some justification of the price?

look you guys, JUST BE GLAD!  here in Vancouver we get folks throwing $25 
parties quite frequently which are worth about a buck fifty.  i NEVER pay 
more than $15 for anything these days, and not even that unless i know 
it's going to be FUCKING AMAZING, because we have money-grubbing 
promoters up north who do the minimum amount of organizing and the 
maximum amount of sitting on their asses ingesting drugs so THEY can get 
ripped at the party too.  *sigh* how i long for San Francisco ...

Yes. And I think it was really nice of him to do so. But we are not

Geoff, again, I did not start this thread(this time around.) I was 
voicing my agreement with Nancy. The issue has been "hashed out" to you 
because it was never an issue in the first place to you. There was never 
any "resolution" of this issue in my mind, and in at least one other 
person it would seem.

Regarding whining, comments like this are really non-condusive to 
discussions. And honestly, I am secure enough in who I am not to be 
too concerned if you view me as a whiner because I do not share your 
views and am willing to express my own.

I absolutely AGREE.  I usually have a delighted smile on my face reading
through all of your posts.  But today I am frowning and I feel slightly
ill.  I hope we can deal with issues and debate amongst ourselves without
this type of anger.  And I find it disturbingly ironic that the ugliest
posts reiterate the need for "PLUR"!!

Price is a legitimate and relevant issue for us to deal with as a
community.  It is not only for _one_ consumer and _one_ promotor - it
concerns US ALL.  I brought it up because I did feel ripped off (along with
wanting to discuss underlying issues, as I stated a few times) but some
posts have provided me information that has made me re-evaluate the
validity of that feeling - thank you for the info.

SFRaves is many things - a forum for us all to collectively create
"raving," a way to meet other ravers, a method to share information, and a
place for debate.  I did not think it was meant to _only_ share the hardest
facts, not voice opinion, and never discuss something that may have been
discussed earlier (i.e. "check the archives from ___TWO YEARS AGO!__").

If we're wrong about something, then please enlighten us.  I _do_ feel
differently about Martin now (too bad this went from generalized massives
to just concerning him).  I had cynically taken his messages of unity to be
an example of exploitation of our beliefs based on my belief that $20+ was
unfounded.  If I hadn't started this thread I would still be of this
opinion!

I believe SFRaves values each of us - NOT just the "real" ravers who have
been (so-called) "raving" since before some of us knew the word.  I believe
it is a place for us to explore what we love and what worries us - NOT a
place that discourages discussion.  I believe it is a place to be
enlightened by others - NOT to only post when we can back up everything we
say based on extensive, outside research.  I believe in PLUR.

I want to apologize to all the newbies who are understandably sickened by
the tone this thread has degenerated into (and I guess to all the "real"
old-school SFR'vers, I'm a newbie too!).  Like what I think of as raving,
SFRaves is dependent on the good-will and positive contribution of each of
its members to create something beautiful.  To me, peace, love, unity and
respect is not a "pseudo-philosophy," it represents the highest ideals that
I'm trying to live and help create in this lifetime.  PLUR is also, I
understand, the guiding philosophy of this list.  Let's each remember that
before posting, respect each others' inquiries and right to voice opinions,
and teach and love each other!

(And I send this dreading the mean replies I am sure to find :(

Love to you all,
Nancy

uuuh... name-calling, how mature. John, I did attempt to contact Martin 
via e-mail on more than one occasion. Geoff was the one that suggested 
I e-mail or call Martin and provided me with the information to do so. 
When I received no response, I emailed Geoff who runs Martin's web site. Geoff
told me that he would make sure that the letter got passed along. I made an 
honest attempt.

The small fact that seems to escape you is that I did attempt to get into 
contact with Martin. Personally. 

I have always prided myself on the fact that I will say anything 
that I do in e-mail to a persons face so, no issue there.

So let's get this straight.:

A) It is my responsibility to get in touch with someone who I think is 
   overcharging for their parties, given what I have seen of them from 
   personal experience. My experiences and opinions based on said 
   experiences are invalid nor should I mention them, until such time as I 
   have contacted the person in question. 

   However:

B) The person in question should not feel any obligation to acknowledge 
   my concerns, nor should they feel any obligation to address my concerns..

Your logic baffles me.

Yes, but this would assume that you are the one keeping score. 

John, I could go through every obstacle course you could think up, and in 
the end I don't think it would really change your perception of me as a 
"whiner"  
 
> That roundabout anonymous e-mail to the world crap, under the guise of

I find very little "roundabout" in my actions. I made a statement in a 
public mailing list. Anyone who cares to respond to what I feel has my 
e-mail address, and as this letter to you should attest I am quite 
willing to discuss my feelings with practically anyone, even those that 
choose to delve into name-calling.

Well, lessee.... We are disagreeing strongly... You have made your 
"conclusions" or opinions clear... Gosh, I don't seem to remember any 
attempts by you to contact me so we could hash things out between the two 
of us..

And I would not expect you to. You have seen enough of my statements and 
opinions to draw an opinion of me. If I had to talk to every person in 
the world with whom I disagreed with strongly about something, I wouldn't 
have a whole heck of a lot of time to live my life. Many politicians, 
the DMV, every wacko on daytime t.v., etc. Yup there sure are a lot of 
people I disagree with. And by your logic it would be DISRESPECTFUL not to 
talk to each and every one of them face-to-face before I formed or 
expressed an opinion, my personal experience and/or their actions and words 
nonwithstanding. Now, if given the opportunity to speak with the person 
and the other party was to turn down that opportunity if even the 
remotest chance that something productive would come out of it, *THAT* 
would be disrespectful.  

I would invite you to consider your thinking in this matter. The way I 
see it, if we choose my approach neither one of us are wrong. If we 
choose your method then: 

a) Plan on spending a lot less time with the family, cause your 
   gonna be talking with people you disagree with

b) You would be just as guilty as I, and hey, I didn't choose that paradigm.

You paint the picture of an altruist. My understanding is that in this 
regard we are discussing a person that is making a living off of members 
of the "community." I am not saying this is a bad thing. However, like so 
many other businessmen out there, it would appear to paraphrase Geoff has 
that he is charging "what the market will bear." Just another person out 
there trying to make a living. Nothing wrong with that at all. Also, charity 
contributions like you mention above should not go unnoticed, and is 
exactly the type of information I have been attempting to discover.

Hey, since you just went off on a totally unrelated racial tangent:  

Statistically, as a whole, people of color make less money then 
anglo-americans.

Since they make less money, less people of color will have the financial 
ability to go to a party as the prices scale up.

Wouldn't this mean that by exclusionary pricing that the promoters of a 
party were engaging in discrimination by economics?

Sound silly?

Ahh yes "Great Minister Louis Farrakhan" Doesn't like Jews much does he?

 Boy it's hotter than ever around here....


  All this discussion about $20-25 parties.... personally I find the massives
rather boring - others find them a dream ....

  The REALLY amusing thing about it all is how many people bitch about the
$25 cost of a party only to spend 2-3 times that much on their party
"vitamins" and toys .... now that's what I call a real budget ;-)


  I can tell it's Spring time - the plants are working over time to make 
extra oxygen - they must be 'cause the flames are burning brighter than
ever......


  IF more people come do I get a discount ticket ?  Volume buying doesn't
seem to work for raves....  but then it doesn't work with CA taxes either...


  It's good to see everyone's having a good time....

I would like to start off by saying, more power to you Nancy!  I'm also
doing my best to uphold PLUR, because to me it represents an important set
of values conspicuously absent in so many people out there.  That's one of
the reasons I'm still on this list, because I thought I found it here, in
you guys.

This is my first post on this "Gathering Scam" thread, but I've read most of
the posts concerning it, and many seem really accusational (is that a real
word?) not to mention disrespectful of the rights of others to express a
disparate opinion.  I personally find it disruptive to the sense of
community and well-being that seemed to carry the conversation on this list
when I first joined (about a month ago), so I'd just like to express my
opinion as being in agreement with Nancy here, that we should really just
try to help and understand each other in spite of our differences instead of
trying to convert someone over to your point of view because of those
differences.  (Did that make any sense?)

Anyways, I hope that whole thread dies real soon, or at least picks up a
positive tone.  A big, warm, fluffy hug to all my brothers and sisters on
the list!  Keep PLUR alive!

Here's looking at all of you,

volt

I am out of touch? I think $25 is a lot of money. I don't consider 
wanting to justify that kind of outlay being out of touch. I have never 
argued that the parties are not done "properly" from a legal standpoint, 
nor have I ever claimed it was "cheap."

True. But do higher costs contribute to or alleviate the problem? Guess 
it all depends on what the market will bear, huh? 

At any rate, little if any of this relates to "whining." I do not share 
your views, and will be the first to say so to you or anyone else that 
brings the matter up. You express your opinion whenever I express mine, 
and I don't accuse you of whining. Because you're not. You are expressing 
a differing opinion. Just as I am.

For the record Geoff, you told me to ask Martin directly, and provided me 
with Martin's e-mail address in order to contact him. After repeated 
attempts to contact him, I wrote you about my difficulties, and you 
stated that you would see that the letter got passed along. I also 
included personal contact info in the letter. You attenpt to argue that I 
should get the "facts," and yet when I attempt to do so *per your 
suggestion* the result was bounced mail, which I was told would be 
forwared to Martin. Now you go so far as to state that you wouldn't 
answer any such questions over the net. If you felt this, why tell me to 
contact Martin at all?

I understand that you like e-mail, and can easily converse in person.  My
sources indicate you do so easily and readily (and from personal experience
I do attest).  All I suggest is try to do a face to face with Martin,
that's all.

I bought a book today called "Silicon Snake Oil" by Clifford Stoll.  He has
struck a chord with me.  He says, in the intro:

"Perhaps our networked world ins't a universal doorway to freedom.  Might
it be a distraction from reality?  An ostritch hole to divert our attention
and resources from social problems?  A misuse of technology that encourages
passive rather than active participation?..."

I tend to agree with him.

I guess I'd rather press flesh (ala handshake, and please make it firm, I
hate weak handshakes), be close enough to hear you breath, see your eyes as
you think, and watch your body gestures as you talk.  I suspect, like Stoll
I am not the first.  I think many may find e-mail uncomfortable, epsecially
with those they have not met face to face.

Just a differnt view of communication.  I think virtual CAN be fine, when
you know the person.  At least that has been my experience.

I replied to Krishna's post to GeoffW. And agreed with GeoffW's assertion.
I know you well enough to know these comments would never sway you to tone
down your vitriol against Martin.

You have a right to your opinion.  I guess we are both in the same boat.
We suffer for our opinions sometimes.  I kinda take the good with the bad.

The tag was not against you, but of the general subject matter that goes on
the list time after time.  And I do ignore you most of the time.  Although
I read your posts with great interest, I do not feel the need to respond to
each and every one.  Some I ignore (but read), others I respond to.  I've
been pretty quiet on the list of late.  It takes quite a bit to bring me
out of the lurker mode.  I'm too busy deleting messages about PLUR most of
the time ;).

I do not remeber you mentioning it.  I know you tried to get a hold of
Martin through e-mail, and thought that was your only attempt.  I aplogize
if I jumped to conclusions by stating you had exhauseted the options, if in
fact you did not.

I have done enough partying to last 10 lifetimes.  I have done enough
dancing in UG's and "commercial" venues in SF to last 10 lifetimes.  I have
seen the best and worst of it.  I have seen g-d, the blue buddah, and
matrix horses on the submixer (huh? can I get a witness GW).  I go out
rarely since I have other things to do.  Partying is much less important to
me because I have a large netowrk of friends in SF (which BTW, I got
through dance culture).  I am not negative on dance culture, on the
contrary, I promote it!  But I tell you this much.  UG use to be a massive
phone netowrk in this city.  Yeah you found out, but it was usually by a
phone call.  Which, by today's standards of e-mail and such, would seem
organic.

Things change, as do perceptions.  I guess if someone on the list posts
about a party that at LEAST 400+ people will automatically be notified, as
different from calling someone on the phone, which could take hours to
complete.  There is something about the 'work' of it that I miss.

I am still connected, I just keep my phone unplugged these days.

I guess it's the old paradigm:

Q: "Can I ask you a question?"
A: "You can ask."

In other words you can ask, he is under no obligation to oblige.
That is my logic.

Sir, I do not think of you as a whiner per se.  Even I whine at times.  I
bitch and moan and complain about many of the things going on this list
(see my tirade of late against that ridiculous PLUR rubbish. <- NOTE: I am
whining AGAIN!).

You sir are provocative, antagonistic to name a few.  But you are also a
humanist, and idealistic in as many ways from what I gather of your
e-messages.  I would never reduce you to a single adjective.  That would
deny the other things you surely are.  Both good and bad.

Understood.  I have only suggested that for some face to face might get you
the results, and answers you desire.  Especially in SF, a place small
enough that you could very well arragne to meet or talk to Martin on the
phone.  We're all very lucky (those of us who live here at least), in that
regard.  All I suggested is a different approach.

We both can do e-mail, and as I recall you and I have had at least a few
sessions privately about Affrimative Action as I recall.  I see no problem
in our channel of communications Adder.  We usually disagree strongly on
many point, be it drugs, AA, or promoters, or what our scene should be.  My
gripe was not with you, but with the subject of scamming, which you added
your .02 worth, which I added mine, and others added theirs.

Got rather messy as these things go.  But the sea is much clamer now IMO.

I say you can form an opinion, but to make accusations about them from said
opinion is irresponsible.  There is a difference between opinion, libel,
and slander.  There is plenty of legal precedent for this idea.

I have been able to manage both.  Since I have little time for partying, I
have plenty of time for mind expaning debate, thought, discussions,
whatever.  I prefer the human element (when Apple allows...workin' fo' da
mastah, night & day...).  Discourse and argument are the stuff of life.  I
have learned much and have so much more to learn from humanity.

My method is as valid as yours.  Maybe it is for those who have a time
allotment similar to mine than yours perhaps.

>
>b) You would be just as guilty as I, and hey, I didn't choose that paradigm.

Since you are versed and like e-mail, and I can use same said medium, there
is little chance of mischaracterization IMO.  We can and have communicated
via the medium.  We have both outstreched our hands and talked before.  I
classified your speech as whining, but that was for the moment.  That does
not make you a whiner altogether.  One can whine and not be a whiner, one
can be provocative and not be a provocatuer, one can be agressive and
passive.  I have drawn no conclusions about you other than human really.
The rest is my perception of your tirades, commentary, etc.

I actually enjoy seeing the result of what you say.  If nothing else, it
certainly does entertain.

I have, I know Martin, and have talked with him about many subjects/things.
He has come to my defense on certain things, and I have come to his.  I
respect those who respect others.  I live it and walk it.  Get to know me
better (if you dare), and you too will know this truth.

Sometimes the virtual world sux.

Once again.  You can ask.  Nothing is stopping you from doing that.  Your
real concern is will you get a reply.  That is between you and Martin.  You
would always be welcome to tell us the outcome of said communication, if
attempted.

A little research goes a long way.  All one need do is ask, or at least

Correct.  Most of us can't even go and see the hip-hop stars.  Especially
here in SF.  All one usually sees, on many occasions, is a sea of white.
But then again, guess who is buyin hip-hop is disproportinate numbers?

Many shows in SF are quite mixed though, but prohibitive ticket prices keep
the number of brown in the house down.

>

Oh yes, I do agree!  However, no real attempt has been made to make the
minority community aware of the dance culture here.  I mean Ameba, for
example, is in Upper Haight, not the Fillmore or Hunter's Point.  Most
parties are thrown in the city, and not the outlying areas, where there are
ample minorities (crime nothwithstanding, this is still a fact).  So I
think it is many factors.  I think that there is another section of the
dance community that has done a goo djob of infusing brown, and that is the
acid jazz & jungle movements here in SF.

Being a Jew myself, I do find him refreshing in many ways.  His
anti-Zionist tactics are worrisome, but I do agree with much of what he
says, sans the scapegoating.  He is a very strong African man here in
America who will not shrink or shirk his responsibility to his people.  The
whole of congress is afraid of this man because he would, if given the
opportunity, tell the truth about this country and what evils it has done
to the people fo color around the world.  They dare NOT bring him forth,
for he surely will shine light on this country's sordid dank backroom
doings.

He also talk of his Ethiopian Jewish brothers, who are being persecuted in
Israel.  He talks of the Great Prophet Moses, and Jesus (both jews), and
their contributions, words and sayings, and uses same to hammer home
brotherhood, respect, loyalty, self-worth, and responsibility for one's
actions.

Once again, I do not agree with him totally, but I have read his writings,
talked to his people (I have access to some levels others might not have),
and understand where he is going, without the predjudiced filter of the
media. A media who is biased against anything black and strong.

As for comparing him to Hitler.  Farrakhan has caused no person to be
killed or beaten, EVER.  No Black Muslim has ever killed any of my Jewish
bretheren, or attempted same.  They are unarmed, using the mind as their
weapon.  For us, be it African or Jew, there will ALWAYS be something the
world does not like.  Such is the road of the semetic peoples of the world.
This too shall pass.

The Rihgt Minister John S. Lee is stepping down now...

Peace out Adder,
John

Ladies and gentlemen, I have a request.

Could the folks currently engaged in the "Gathering Scam" thread please take 
further responses offline?  Perhaps I'm the only one that's getting a little 
weary of the negativity, but I doubt it.

I've dutifully read or at least scanned the various messages.  It started 
off interesting, but at this point I see very little new information being 
communicated, and I'm not surprised at all at the rise in frustration and 
even name-calling that has ensued now that this thread has come full circle 
several times with no further progress.

I've really enjoyed e-conversing in the past with each of the individuals 
involved in this thread.  I've come to like and respect each of you, and I'd 
hate to see this argument (no longer a discussion) continue to the point 
where really hard feelings develop.  You are each nice, intelligent people, 
but on this topic you've really come to verbal blows.

So, again, please take the negativity offline.  And if you do continue the 
argument offline, please try to be respectful and informative for each 
other's sake, ok?

Love and a huge v-hug to each of you,

S

I wish many of you would at least understand some of the dynamic of the
list.  For years we have had good times and bad.

For years there has been an ebb & flow of this list.  In the end, there are
usually no hard feelings, really.  I have found the folx on this list, if
nothing else, genuinely concerned with our little soicety we have formed
here online as well as the larger dance community.  Moreso, how this
society is reflective of the one around us, and how it influences same.

I have seen the list degenrate worse than it is now, with me being just one
of the provocatuers in the upheaval.  The one thing I have noticed is the
capability of each of us to get over it and move on.  This happens most if
not all of the time. (It's about Respect).

What I don't like is the constant "Hey. Let's keep it positive..."
movement.  If we are a family, then like any family we will bicker.  If we
are a unified family, on the lookout for each other, then we will forgive
each other of our idiosyncrasies and faults.  Eventually, we all come
together in the end, please try to remeber that.

I know may of you dislike my virtriol and commentary.  I know I come off as
stubborn, antagonistic, provocative, name-caller, whatever.  But remember
also, I am usally silent, except when certain issues are raised.  As
always, I will be out of your hair soon.

I love this list for many things.  I love it that people can argue like
enemies, but in the very end, a "peace out" or "peace" or "hugz" or "love"
or "kisses" is the final retort.  Sometimes it cannot just happen so
quickly and needs a thorough hashing out.

Yes, It would be better to do these things privately, but really, what is
one to do when a public accusation is made?, who really has the last word,
and what should it be?

My last commentary to Adder was honestly concilliatory in tone.  And that
is how I meant it.  There was the usual sarcasm at points, but in the end
it was all about peace and maybe reaching an understanding to disagree.
Could it have been accomplished off the list?  Surely, but then WHY do we
have a list in the first place if not for public discourse of issues.  AS
in real life, it can get down to "nyah, nyah, na na na!" but it does get
turned around.  Just go with it.
(It's about Unity)

There is really no need to read every thread.  You see the subject, you can
kill it or skip it.  You see the author, you can do the same.  You are not
obligated to reply to every thing, much less read it.  As I often do, I
would mildly suggest excersizing some discretion.  If you see a thread
blowing up into madness, stay away from it.  Usually as it becomes overly
personal, it will end up private.  It always does.  Be patient, would be my
other mild suggestion.  If anything the list is organic, and moves at it's
own pace. (It's about Peace)

Remeber we are a family and arguments shouldbe able to be worked out in
public AND in private.  The real trick is when to do which.

This so-called, flame war, was so minor as to be trivial in the overall
history of this list.  I would hope that this list NEVER boils down to a
strict positivity, since that is NOT the real world.  I would hope that
things never get to a point of just one view and one way of saying  or
doing things. I hope it remains as alive and vibrant as it always was/is.
With many views, and many counter-views.

Over the years it seems these things start, but never seem to end.  I would
remind some of you that there have been times when things have taken weeks
to hash through before going private.  Now we see things being solved or
going private in days.  Not a bad progression.  That just means that the
level of communication has gotten so well refined or perhaps, even better,
we've gotten to know each other so much better as to resolve things in a
much more expeditious fashion.  Whatever the reason, it is far better now
than in the past.(It's about Love)

So I would say to the nayayers of percieved negative commentary, if you
don't like it, you can skip it.

Telling the more vocal group of us to tone it down, or take it private,
just becuase you do not wish to excersize discretion in what you read, is
tantamount to parents letting the congress take responsibility for the
activities of their family (via rating, v-chips, etc.).

I know the stuff gets old quick, but blink your eyes, and it's over before
it was ever started.

Positivity is nice, and all good.  But life is about taking the good with
the bad and learning from it.

This list is an good mechanism for learning.

My credo is:  "If I don't like it, say something about it. Better yet DO
something about it!  If it is of little concern, there is little need to
reply.  If it is of no concern, there is little need to read."

(NOTE:  This MAY sound negative, but I DON'T read messages with PLUR in the
title.  If you want to start a coup against me, as if I am even that
important which I am not, make tPLUR the subject matter, and you're
guaranteed I will be clueless.  Since I never, ever read those messages!)

I could go on about the sickly sweet positive messages, but there has been
enough rain for one day.

My brothers and sisters, I will check you ALL out later.

Right now it's time for a Newcastle, a baked potato, and greenery.  The
REAL stuff of life.

Live long, have fun, & much peace, I'm REALLY done,
John

P.S.  Unless otherwise stated, all is IMO.  Now will you guys stop all the
"take it to private" messages.  It's really getting tedious ;).

Peace...

Hey all,

I've run into a bummer of a situation.  Just recently I was given an 
offer and accepted a seasonal job at Donner Memorial State Park.  The 
interview and the offer were both over the phone last month.  Some 
forms to fill out were sent to me along with rules on uniform and 
GROOMING standards. The grooming standards is for males and stated that 
my hair could not go past my collar, could not be in a pony tail or 
braided, ect.    I have not checked on the female grooming standards 
(plan to go downtown tommorrow and look it up) but I don't think that 
they would be required to have short hair.  

Since I've been hired if they tell me I must cut my hair to keep the 
job would this be a case of discrimination according to sex?  Not that 
I could afford a lawyer.  

My biggest problem is I want to make a career in parks and recreation.  
I may have to make a sacrifice and cut my hair to gain something I 
want.  I can't express the ammount of frustration and anger this 
situation gives me.  Any ideas, suggestions, knowledge?  Thanks 
everyone.

love chris

Not that I am a lawyer, but this is how I understand the situation.

Employers have a right to enforce dress codes as long as they are
reasonably related to the "business purpose" and so long as it is not a
guise for outright discrimination.  Here, it is not something which you
could not "help" - like saying that you have to be a certain height.  The
government is saying, whether you're a boy or girl, does not matter to us,
we just want you to look a certain way.

Not that I agree with any of this, but I think this is the current state of
the law.  I know that a couple of years ago San Francisco was trying to
pass a "look discrimination" ordinance - like you couldn't deny someone
housing/employment just cause they had long hair/short hair/no hair,
piercings, etc.  I don't think it ever passed.

Now I know this is getting long, but in closing I just wanted to add that I
have had a male friend who have worked for NPS before, and I thought they
he had long hair at the time.  Just a random memory, can't rely on it and
I've lost touch with him.  Otherwise I would have called him.

Sorry to hear about this bogusness.  My final thought is that maybe you
should call and ask how strictly they enforce these "grooming" standards.
Some federal regulations are not followed the same in all places.  A
National Park in Georgia, for example, might very well stick to the book,
while your chances of them being a little lax in California are much
greater.

Would like to know how it all works out for you.  Which I hope is the best.

peace...

Hello All,

Forgive me if this sounds "preachy" . . . don't worry, it's pretty short!

I feel as though we (as a group) may be getting a little too critical lately.
 IMO, sometimes it is good to take a step back and let your eyes focus on the
larger picture.  One of the things that attracted me to raving, was the lack of
"stars".  Raving, to me, involves developing a creative community space with
other people  . . . dancers, djs, promoters even security guards:)

If we want to be a community in resonance, we must attempt to keep ourselves
balanced.  IMO, we need to avoid the traditional "rock & roll concert
positioning" . . . what I mean is that IMO we need to avoid putting a
particular person or group on a pedestal (or conversely, on the proverbial
chopping block).
I believe that this "positioning" can have a negative effect on the raving
community because it can degenerate into merely audience and performer, static
object and passive observer.  We're all equal participants in the community,
whether we realize it or not . . .  hugs or eye contact or a great smile can
influence a person just as much as a DJ's music or a promoter's prices.  To end
this little preach session, I'm going to quote Howard Thurman:  "Don't ask
yourself what the world needs.  Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go
do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive."

On another note, a BIG round of applause to the gang at the "Other Organic"  .
 .  .  thanks, I had a great evening full of dancing and communication!  It was
definately worth the five hour drive!

regards,

I was also at Tribal Funk... I have to say I agree with the posted reviews.
I loved the space (the balcony was nice). The lighting was *great*
(especially when they turned the spotlights on the mirror ball and evryone
the whole place looked like it was caught in a snowstorm. The music was
fantabulous, too. I've never heard that type of mixing between house and
breakbeat (and I usually don't like house much, too).

I do have some gripes though. This party had *no* vibe. It seemed like
everyone was there just to dance and show off a little, and I just didn't
feel that comfortable. It was like a little scenester club and I hate that
sort of thing. I'm not saying it had a bad vibe, just _no_ vibe. People
weren't really "interacting." Also, the guy at the door wouldn't let me
take my BIG water bottle in. :P

So basically, I spent the whole time on the dance floor (near the middle...
I had a black baseball cap, blue jeans and a simple grey t-shirt on) having
fun in my little personal space. No one seemed too friendly, except the
_one_ girl I met towards the end. Didn't see any familiar faces though.

all in all a good party though. Shoulda gone with a big group like everyone
else.

I just figure a rave should cost about the same as an equivalent concert.
Most *big* concerts are around $20-$25 so I see no problem with promoters
charging that kind of money for a party... assuming it has a good vibe good
music good lighting and a good space. Basically, if the promoter puts the
work into it (s)he can justify charging that kind of money.

Hey, speaking of concerts, who's going to that big Tibetan benefit this
June? Beasties, Bjork, Fugees... I'm totally going to be there! It seems
like something a lot of SFRers would be attracted to... we should agree on
a meeting pount or something... yeah, I know I'm thinking way in advance.

Well I went to both the Gathering and a smaller free party afterwards.

I enjoyed the Gathering immensely.  I spent the whole time in the "Not so
Thumps" room which was actually "Thumpy" the whole time I was there =)  The
Dr. rocked the house so to speak and the dj before hand (I believe it was
Jonah Sharp) was also pretty good.  I was impressed that Alex played for
almost 3 hours!  The setup of the event was really nice and they had very
nice visuals and a really nice lazer...nicest one I've seen in a while.
All in all it was interesting for me as it was the first party in over two
years that I have paid more than $10 or $15 dollars to get into.  I didnt
feel as though I was not getting my money's worth though...the event was
well planned and the staff were friendly and the sound was *amazing*.
Seriously one of the best systems I have heard. period.  Very clean bass
and not too loud that it hurt.

The smaller party was fun as well, Moonpup was playing some nice stuff in
the dance room and I got to spin the last set in the ambient room along
with my friend Michael Anthony.  It was nice to see a lot of familiar faces
as well.

Thanks to the organizers of both events!

love drenalin

 Hello everyone!  I have been hanging here for about two weeks and can say
that this is the heavest listserv that I have ever been on!  (Good thing
it's for raves and not the NRA!)  Well as you can see from my address I am a
mear two hours from the San Francisco Rave scean, but that's too bad
considering some of the distances people come to go to a good rave.  While I
have never been to a rave, I have always liked "techno music (boy this
sounds corny, but true).  Hopefuly, now that I have more time to play, and
more money to play with this will change.  Now for the discription:

        Hair: Brown, long, curly
        Hight: 6'
        Body type: Lenky, skinny, Drawn out, yet somewhat normal
        Face: Nose, ears (2), Eyes (2), Mouth, goatee, (no percings)
        Distinguishing features: Scar on left fore arm and BLUE mole!
        General look: middle class republican (voted green party!)
        Hobbies: Ridding my bike (yes it is a hobbie defined by the IRS),
swimming, 
                 Hanging out at the Java House (yes it seems like most of my
pay check
                 Goes here) and fixing my car(kind of a hobbie out of need)
        Favorite album so far: William Orbit's Strange cargo III

I have a few questions that maybe someone can answer.  Is ther any place in
Santa Cruz that has a collection of rave type music/ House type music.  I
have been to a few stores, but have never been able to find anyhting really
that interesting.  Mostly just get trapped into the dance party type music
and nothing really looks that good.  While I'd love to get into Frequency-8
or some of the other shope up north, I have yet to travel the distance.  How
about mail orded stuff?  Is there anyone in the Santa Cruz area (perferably
at UCSC) that wouldn't mind letting me tape some stuff?  I can also carpool
with anyone in the area to head to raves if things work out.  Well I think
that just about does it for me and the Rave scean.  Take care.

Steve

My, oh my!  I think Martin outdid himself with this one!  Nancy would have
enjoyed it.  There was a nice, friendly vibe going that I've never found at
a massive before.  I saw only a small number of people I know there, but I
spent most of my time with my friend Sara, outside.  I missed all the
brightest moments of the party (really wanted to see Alex Patterson :( ),
but the music was good.  I can now say that I can identify jungle!  I got a
kick out of seeing a long line of people, joined by hands in a chain, with
Martin at the front, running around through the dance floor with a burning
bunch of desert sage!  After my friend Dennis and I got in, we saw Martin,
and he said he could have gotten us in for free, as Dennis and he know each
other...I danced to the first dj giving way to the second, hit the chill
area (I thought the sound was too loud), had a little snack, and found
Sara, who I met at the last Gathering.  We sat outside and talked, got very
into each other, and went back inside in time for me to catch the last
dance on the floor, and the last of Joe Rice's (was that him?) set in the
chill area (or was it the other way around?).  Said my final
hello/good-byes, bade Sara good-bye & agreed to see her this coming
weekend, and returned to the South Bay with Dennis, both of us feeling
satisfied from the experience.  It was my first non-e rave, and I enjoyed
it!
The space was better than before, and the decorations, lights, animation,
just everything was outstanding!  Way to go, Martin & co!

Peace, y'all!

 Well , there's a store in San Jose ( still closer than San Fran ) called
Solid Grooves. To get there , drive over the mountains on HW880. At the
Hw280 interchange, take HW280 South. Stay in the right hand lane , because
the very next exit off of HW280 is the one for Bascom Ave. Take the
Bascom Ave. exit, and do the left hand turns per the signs to get to 
Bascom Ave. At Bascom , make a right hand turn and stay in the right lane.
After two intersections is the store , between the Mexican restaurant and
the Pink Poodle strip joint. 

 Don't forget to bring your headphones!

My impression is that the circle dancing is a leftover of the horrible
break-dancing era, and that those who circle dance are just showing off
their moves.  If there's a more honorable motive for it, I'd like to
know...

Don't worry, friend!  That Gathering thread drew lots of fire from all
directions.  I don't think it's anything personal, just lots of venting.
Last time I checked, everyone here still loved and respected each other.  I
don't think anything has changed :)

Peace,

So what are you saying here? Should every promoter post their balence sheet
after each party if they charge above $15, and as I have said there have been
$25 parties thrown by just about every major promoter since 1992.

Martin was on the Sunset boat party yester (he, like I and about 150 others
each paid $20 to the Sunset crew for an absolutely WONDERFUL party, hmm no
lasers, no fog machines, no food, cash bar, where does the money go :) He
says that he never received any mail form you, (quite possible since
Martin's computer is shared by several in his house hold and their e-mail is
often messed up). I told him that some people were still questioning where
the money goes for his
parties, he seemed a little exasperated nad wanted to know how to get on
sfraves so maybe you will hear from him soon.

If you want, come to the next gathering and I will pay your way and personnally
introduce you to Martin, then you can ask him where the money goes.

I paid $20 of my hard earned money for the Gathering and each and every
penny brought some of the finest moments of experience I've ever had.
I had an amazing time.  and some of you may be saying, yeah, but,
those amazing experiences are there every other weekend, and they just
lose their fantastic quality after a while.  Well, after four years
I'm still impressed that I can go out and still manage to experience 
something entirely new and profound in that same old routine.  Every
party just gets better and better as you learn to put more of yourself
into it and then learn to notice how all your energy gets returned a
thousandfold.  So I just let myself go to a new extreme and the results
left me dumbfounded.

and now for logistics:

The sound system was set up so that the DJ was in the center of the room
and the speakers were at the corners pointed toward the center.  I remember
this setup from a Basics a few years ago but haven't seen it since.  I thought
it was a nice twist on the structure of the crowd... usually there is a small
crowd in front of the DJ and then it gets less crowded as you move back,
finally into chaos and sitting people at the other end.  But this setup
spread those concentrations of energy out into rings around the center,
and it was neat to see how people reacted to that.  It did make a difference.
and the sound itself, as already mentioned, was really nice.  Not too loud, 
but definately bone resonating and well dispersed through the room.
I really liked DJ Dans set... his style has been changing in a good way.
The not so thumps sound was also really nice.

The multicolored laser was pretty, but combined with that tracing effect
it made me miss a simple big green laser.  The tracers scatter the beam
so much it loses it's singular intensity, and then with the multicolored
beams it begins to look like just another light effect.  oh well, it's
still a very impressive lighting effect.  Lighting otherwise was nice,
simple and following modes in the music.

The people... quite a few of them, I really couldn't guess how many,
more than a thousand, less than a million... but most all were really
into it and at times really going wild.  It was an honest and powerful wildly
moving vibe, from my own humble perspective.  The thing about massives
that I really like are those moments when you finally let go of your
judgements, and the vibe just locks itself into place and you become one with
everything... It's harder at the larger parties but more fulfilling.  All
that energy just focuses itself through you and when it involves all those
thousands of people, it can be so extremely moving.  This night had more
than its fair share of that for me, hence my empassioned praise.
It's amazing how easily we get caught up in criticism and denial.  
anyway... The end had the room still packed full of people throwing their
arms in the air, facing the center, to the last song.  It was a good end to
a good night.

With that, I wish all of you a good week and leave you with the title
of an 808 State song from 1988...

Let yourself go.

Yeah, that was me. It was nice to play on such a killer sound system in an
ambient (though not very ambient for most of the night) room and everyone
there was into it.

The party was pretty good overall. Perhaps a tad overpromoted, but a pretty
good vibe nonetheless. There was free water, as promised, and bottles were
only $1. I liked how the main room DJ booth was set up in the middle of the
dance floor. I didn't really get into most of the music I heard, but Alex
and Jonah played some interesting stuff in the ambient room and Darkhorse
played a great set.

The Sunset boat party was great - an ideal group of people. Wish I hadn't
been so tired.

Joe

Hello...

I am a newcomer to sfraves, but have been in the scene for about 3 years now. 
For the longest time, I heard so much good stuff about sfraves, but now that I
am on, I am a little disappointed.  When I came back to work this Monday
morning, I had 145 posts - 95% of which were either bitch sessions (regarding
The Gathering mainly - sacrilegious in my opinion), or lame bits of
information that EVERYBODY does not need to know.
It took me over an hour just to weed through all the bullshit.  Now don't get
me wrong, there was interesting information on there (MDMA info, etc.), but
for crying out loud...

IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING GOOD TO SAY, DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.

The scene has always been about positivity, love, friendship, music, and
togetherness - not about complaining, bitching, slashing, or singling
people/parties out.  

LUCKY CHARMS IS ONE THING, BUT THE GATHERING?!?!?!  COME ON!!!

If you have something negative to say, keep it to yourself - there is no need
to share it with everybody on sfraves.

Thank you....

Peace, love + positivity,

Jason Green

PLUR IS NOT alive here.  If someone saw a person in your family (like your
sister) and implied that they were doing something that the society of your
immediate group of friends considered to defaming to her charecter you would
defend her, most likely by charecter reference, or other such actions, if afer
several iterations of this the person says "I'm not convinced, she's still a
slut/bitch/skeezer/whatever" To me, this is the height of disrespect, it shows
no Unity because the person has already made up their mind they cannot see
the forest for the trees Love and Peace, well what can I say, Martin came
through when people were paralyzed in horrible accidents, when people were
killed in motorcycle accidents, where people were thrown in jail for
promoting freedom of consciousness, most of you don't know fuck about these
things all you are focused on is whether the stupid party is worth $25 or
not, what about the lives 
and families of the people who throw the parties?, who risked going to jail 
(and did go to jail), who wound up sick, injured or dead becaused they LIVED
this so called PLUR with their being so much and gave of themselves so much.
Malachy, one of martin's former parents still sits in a wheelchair, he doesn't
throw parties, he doesn't have a stack of money from the parties that he threw,
all he has is the memories and the friendship of his extended family here.
For many of us, Martin is family, we don't always condone his actions but he
has come
through time and time again, and proven his commitment to what you all so
readily refer to as Peace Love Unity and Respect BY HIS ACTIONS, NOT SIMPLY BY
WORDS. Maybe one day some of you will reach out past this e-mail list and meet
some of the people that have been throwing parties here for years anc come
to understand, why they continue to do it, in the face of adversity,
authority and
inconsiderate, naieve and sometimes ignorant opinion.  Strong words?
Pehapse, but
sometimes the scene has fangs, sometimes your motorcycle goes off the road,
or the DEA comes to your door and takes your girlfriend away in the middle of
the night, or your friend needs an emergency operation and they don't have
health insurance and the hospital wants $5000, sometimes you spend your rent
money to throw a party and it floops, it's these times (most of you don't
know what
I'm talking about but some of you do).  People like Martin have been there
time and time again for people in this community, I honestly can't take
someone's
blatherings about PLUR seriously in the face of what I have heard on this list
yet seen demonstrated by many people off of it.

At most parties you have people who are beautifully coordinated and can do 
all the right "moves."  Some of these 
people are circle dancers, others are people with less attitude who 
really know how to dance.  Watching these bodies in motion is beautiful 
and is a true talent.  There is a definite style of dancing at raves that 
differs from other scenes or cultures.  However, there are also those of 
us who have our talents placed elsewhere and are a bit more 
"rhytmicly-challenged."

At the October Friends and Family I really tuned into how I felt dancing
and also I watched closely at how others danced.  At the beginning of the
night my body felt awkward, the motions I was performing didn't *feel*
right, but by the end of the night I had reached a state where everything
felt perfect.  As I watched others, I realized what a wonderful form of
self-expression dancing is.  You could tell people who completely let
themselves go and danced their hearts out.  Even people who couldn't do
the right "moves" were beautiful when they danced from their heart.  It
was the ultimate form of self-expression, and you cold see peoples'
personalities and uniqueness from their motions.  When I had finally 
reached a state where my body felt the perfect motion, I know I had 
reached my true form of self-expression.  Sometimes this expression is 
not as methodic nor trained as those who know how to do the right moves, 
but it is highly unique and therefore truly beautiful.

I know I will never be a very structured, rhthmic dancer, but I also know 
how it feels when I reach a state where my body is in *MY* own unique 
motion.  To me it is this unique self-expression that defines "rave" 
dancing.  Motion does a body good.  I love to move my body in many  
different ways and feel the pleasure that I can create for myself.

Well, I've been very amused by all the posts regarding the worthiness
of paying $20-25 to attend a Martin event. Here's my review of the
event itself:

Having difficulty getting the entire entourage of mine to get it
together, and having made a pit stop at a friend's cast party for a
dance performance, we finally made it there around 12:30. The parking
lots were already jammed, so I knew there was a big crowd inside. The
security line at the time was moderate (about 5-10 min.), and the
guards were quite friendly by that time. Only one ticket seller,
though, which caused another delay. Hmmmpf.

We finally enter, and are immediately taken up by the vibe. Lots of
cool herbal drinks and fruit smoothies, someone giving away fruit at
another table. Someone selling shirts. It was like a bazaar outside of
a Dead show.

The Thump Room was really thumping. Lots of lasers and strobes were
completely dazzling the crowd. Almost everyone is moving and grooving
to the deejays, who were -- unusually enough -- located right in the
middle of the dance floor. The vibe was particularly strong and steady
throughout the night.

The Not-so-Thump Room was the big surprise. It was like one giant
living room party. The deejays were sitting low, with their tables low
with them. Lots of trance and ambient flowing here. The chill-out
space occupied the rear of the room, with lots of mats, soft chairs,
and stuffed animals :) all over the place.

After attending The Dec. '95 Gathering, and Vision last February, I
felt this was one of the best Martin parties yet. The $20 I and my
friends spent was definitely worth it -- even though the party was 1
hour shorter due to the time warp. The only thing really missing was a
slightly better water flow at the free water bar (they ran out several
times during the evening, causing long waits for a refill).

As far as things are concerned, I think that value is in the mind of
the consumer. Some people will be content driving in a $10000 Dodge
Neon, while others will prefer plunking $19000 down on an Acura
Integra. Both types of drivers may (or may not) get a sense of having
gotten good value for the car they own, regardless of the price.

Kudos to Martin for an all-in-all well organized and executed event.

The Gathering and Sunset review
==============================

We showed up kinda late,  around 12 mid.   There was a small line to
get in,   but we finally got in,  and WOW!!    We immediately headed
for the "non-thump" room,  which was thumping and getting off BIG
TIME.    Later on,  I head for the big room.  WOW!  The visuals were
insane,  and they got a multi-color laser system that gave my brain
and eyes some real treats while dancing.

In talking to Martin,  he says that 2400 people showed up,  as this is
the most crowded I've seen for this great venue.

As usual,  they had opened up the side doors,  letting in that cool
fresh air.

The music was great,  danced a long time,   but there were too many
breaks on some of the sets.    The music was not as loud as it was in
the previous times I've been at this venue.    It was just about right.
Good clean sound.

Over in the other non-thump room,  some slower funky toons were
really getting down..

The rave ended at 7 am,   and we headed back to Marin to chill,   go
hiking later,  and eventually headed out to where the boat was
waiting for the Sunset boat party.

Sunset Boat party
================

I've never seen such a happy and energetic crowd.   The boat was
incredible,   Galen started things off with some really good thumpin
house,  and I immediately started dancing as everyone else was still
getting on board.

The boat eventually got underway,  as we chugged out over the Bay.
The FOG cast an eerie finger out over the Bay.

Down in the main room,   things were really getting hot until I asked
one of the ship people to open the side doors,  and things really
cooled down.

Jon Howard went on after Galen,  and did an incredible thumpy
funkey set.    For some reason,  the music didn't seem to be so loud
down in the main room.

Upstairs,   Allan was spinning some of the most bazaar toons I've
heard yet.   Sorta sounds like a humpback whale getting flushed
down the toilet...   :-)

The boat at this time,  was just crossing under the Golden Gate,  and
laying back looking up at the bottom of the bridge was a real head
trip.

In the meantime,  Solar was on,   spinning some great house toons,
and everyone was GETTING OFF big time.    The music could have
been a little louder,  but I suppose they had to keep it turned down
low for some reason.

Anyway,  the boat party was much better than I expected,  and
dancing on a moving boat was really cool.

Great party....

The Crunchman

Yeah: lose the attachment to your hair.  My hair has been really long (past 
my shoulders), really short (flat top) and every variation in style you can 
imagine except bald.  What matters is what's under the surface, not what 
people see on the outside.  Cut it.  It's just hair.  You may find, after 
you've passed the probation period at your job, that you'll be able to grow 
it back out with little or no flack.  In fact, why not have fun with it?  
Since it's just hair, and it CAN grow back, get it really butched.  Go for 
something really short on the sides and back, longish on top, and style it 
straight back with a little gel.  Or go for the buzz cut.  Then take a 
picture of it so you can show your buddies and laugh your asses off after 
you grow your hair back out.

Change is good...

Yeah I saw that guy too.  Obviously I got there after things had already 
been mostly resolved.  I think that guy got escorted out as well.

Hm.  It definitely didn't have a big vibe, but I went with 3 other people, 
and together we did ok, vibe-wise.  I rarely go to anything alone -- I take 
my vibe with me.  We met a few people, saw a few familiar faces, but I have 
to agree, there wasn't a real "close" feeling like there could have been if 
there'd been more people.  In fact, I was at two raves that night and 
neither one had a big population.  I guess everyone was saving it for the 
Gathering the next night...

We got there about 1am.  There was the usual great sound systems, 
though alittle too loud in the somewhat of an ambient room.  I say 
somewhat because most of the time the music that I heard there was 
pretty fast to chill to, but I did hear some nice slower stuff, but had 
to stay on the outskirts of the room cause it was too loud.

In the big room I felt there was a lot of a chaotic energy.  People 
were moving all around, facing different directions.  I didn't like 
having the dj in the middle of the dance floor.  Found it a little 
disorienting at first, and I think it kept people walking around more 
on all sides of the dj.  Near the dj it was several rows deep of people 
watching the dj.  Outside of that, it was grand central station.

After sitting a little outside the chill room, feeling on the negative 
side, watching people go by, thinking that alot of the people there 
didn't have much of a concept of the spiritual aspect of raving I was 
feeling tempted to go home.  With angela's enthusiasm I decided to give 
it another try, and as we walked toward the big room, I readjusted my 
expectations of the party.  I decided that I didn't need to have a 
great vibe with everyone dancing together to have a good time.  If it 
was still too crowded to not be bumped every 10 seconds while dancing, 
I would stand around like many others and listen to the music and get 
off on the visuals (which were really good).

It was about 4:30 now, and we found a spot not too far from the dj.  As 
I was standing there I noticed it wasn't as crowded, and people seemed 
more focused on the music.  At that point I senced a nice vibe, and 
decided to make the most of it, and started dancing wild to the fast 
trance music, trying to send out as much happy love vibes as I could to 
as many people as I could.  From 4:30 on I had a GREAT time.  I think 
it took a while for people, myself included to settle in.  Also I think 
by 4:30 alot of people who probably aren't into raving that much might 
have left.

There was plenty of water, easy to get from the dispensors.  Last time 
I had to pour from the big delivery type water bottles.  The visuals 
were great.  

Near the end the camra man was up on top of the dj booth encouraging 
everyone to raise the energy.  Then Martin got up there as  well giving 
a lot of encouragement.  This was nice, but after a bit it felt alittle 
mtvish as people were exicitingly waving at the camra.

The time I had from 4:30 on helped make up for the previous 3 hours.  
Looking back at it and after reading a few wicked posts, it seems that 
wicked might have been the party to got to.

OH MY GAWD!!!!  I forgot about Day Light Savings and I did not realize it 
had occurred until I read this post.  I had it written on my calendar, 
which I obviously forgot to check.  That answers why there were so many 
people already at the library yesterday at exactly 1 p.m. (when it 
opens), it was actually 2 p.m.  And, I came into work an hour late and no 
one said anything.  Duh, I am a total idiot, but I thought I'd share it 
all with you, so you can have a good laugh.  Just think, if I hadn't 
read this post, I would have continued my day one hour behind!!!

After a night of dancing sunday was a great day to hang out in gg park. 
Upon entering the park by where the roller skaters skate to music there 
were a bunch of people watching and listening to the funky discoey 
dance tunes.  We got there just as they stopped the music to introduce 
this new sound system that will be in the park every weekend.

Only tapes were being played, but it had a great sound.  Anybody know 
why this rollerskate area can have amplified sound every week?
>From my understanding rave parties need permits in other parts of the 
park.  It seems like none is neccessary at this roller skate spot.
GG park is a big park.  Why can't they accommodate a techno spot?

Futher down by the that big green house thing there was this trippy 
band called Thoth playing under the bridge.  They have a spacey middle 
eastern sound.  After they finished I bought their cd then tranced out 
a bit at the drumming circle at hippy hill before leaving.

Wow, that was a long-winded harangue in response to a simple attempt to 
share my positivity.  I regret that I did indeed draw your fire, my 
intent was not to draw such negativity.  Regarding what was said below, 
however, I can't speak for everyone, but I'll agree that I am probably as naive as you so 
eagerly point me out to be.  I don't know Martin, so I don't pass 
judgment on him either way.  I can't say that I like your blanket 
generalizations of what amounts to "everyone on this list is a 
hypocrite" (especially since we've never met), but I respect that you 
feel that way for whatever reasons you do.  

What I do know is that PLUR is NOT dead here, I think it still lives in 
some of us, even if not in you, so I ask that you do not include me in your 
overgeneralizations where this is concerned.  I'm not perfect, but I'm 
trying to the best of my ability, as I'm sure many on this list are, to 
live up to the set of ideals based on PLUR.  Most of us may not live 
completely by those standards, but I'd like to think a lot of us are 
trying.  Dismiss it as foolish naivete if you will, but I'd rather go on 
fooling myself that I can achieve these ideals than to mindlessly submit 
to the bleak picture of reality that you have painted below.

Respectfully,

volt

Oh, excuse me!

Wanted to thank everyone who made it out to the small get together for the
Organic On-Line new office space party.  It was a fun night, in a great
space that will be a new office for Organicians.  Unfortunately it won't be
used again for parties.

It was a *free* party on the fifth floor of an old building in SOMA.  The
main dance area was long and wide and it never got over crowded, so wasn't
too hot.  There were big windows at the end that looked out onto the Bay,
to the DJ's back, and Moonpup played a great sunrise set.  Bryce threw down
some elcectic stuff including...Rock Lobster!?  Very unique, but definitely
not out of line.  The party seemed to be sort of unique.  There was an
interestingly good mix of people.  As you can imagine, with Wicked and The
Gathering going on, there were a lot of new faces mixed with those that
weren't up for the massives.

The vibe took a while to get rolling, but it fanned out and managed to keep
people smiling.  The chill area was nice and broad and cozy and is now a
quite reception area between offices.  WBL played a GREAT ambient set and I
think it was from the chill area that the vibe spread through out the
party.  Greg and Cindy arranged a beautiful alter.

Main room line-up: Phred spun first, followed by I think DJ Forrest, then
Bryce and finally Moonpup.

One funny note:  A young guy walks up to me as I was dancing, with a wig on
and these dope pistachio green sued Hush Puppies my friend gave me for my
birthday, and asks:  "Do you do this for a living?"  Looking around, I was
like, "Hell, no!  I work for a software company in Berekeley.  But if you
can think of a way to make money off dancing at parties, I'm all ears!"

Cheers!

Tony

P.S.  Are there pre-sale tickets to Harmony?  Anyone know the details on
that?  The voice mail doesn't say.

Thank you Pacific and everyone who put that party together yesterday!
Everything about it was really great!  The music was right on, and the two rooms
were always completely different -- between two rooms of dancing, a front deck,
a back deck, and a roof deck, there was always some place to go to for a new
sound or scene!

THe Red and White Fleet is a good boat choice, lots of outdoor seating, and the
crew were really nice, security was mellow -   I'll never forget sailing under
the Golden Gate Bridge with that amazing older windsurfer guy pacing us and
waving!  Or coming up along Angel Island, looking like we were Gulliver landing
on a fairy tale island.  Or going under the Bay Bridge, a totally urban feeling,
hearing the cars overhead, then it got silent as we went underneath -- the woman
next to me said "It's an eclipse!"  And it was.

And it wasn't too crowded!  

Thanks for a wonderful end to my weekend!

Leslie   : )

p.s.  Yes, Wicked rocked as always -- I have to say, guest djs are a nice
change, but I'm always happiest with our local heros!

To which Eric replies:
        What I meant to say was that I'd like to think there's more to it
than people just trying to look cool or compete for whose moves are the
dopest.  If self-expression and fun are the motives, I'm good with that,
but I'm not good with a "Yo, check me out" attitude.  But I do like to
watch everyone dance.  They all look like they know what they're doing.
Some look like they've spent lots of time and effort to learn what they do.
I, on the other hand, don't know any "moves," so I let the music move
me...

All good,

I do like e-mail. I conduct many of my day to day activities via e-mail, 
have made business deals via e-mail,etc. etc. It also has the advantage 
of allowing one to gather their thoughts before speaking. 

I am not at all opposed to meeting Martin. I think much of this whole 
thread has been obfusicated by the feeling that I have something 
personal against this person. I don't at all. I have attempted to keep 
my comments general, but have been put in a position where it appears to 
some that I am striking out against him.

It really is a double-edged sword. Many of the interest groups/info 
really can move people to action by offering a community of people with 
like interest and concerns. OTOH, it can definitely be used by those who 
sit behind keyboards, throw insults at people, and take no action to 
change or understand the things they don't like (much of USENET today....)
Like any tool, it's all in how you use it.

I do understand and think you have a valid point. It is much more 
difficult to express tone in e-mail. I also have met quite a few people 
through e-mail, including many of our own S.F. Ravers, and am comfortable 
with this medium also. But I see what you are saying.

Again, I feel this is another instance of misconception. This whole issue 
has been made to be about Martin, and this was not my original intent.  
As Geoff pointed out, where is the Bagkok tribe or whoever they are?
I would like to see their justification for their actions more than 
someone who is widely recognized as throwing a good party. The only 
reason this whole issue became about Martin is because he happened to be 
throwing a party that I see as being expensive with questionable 
truth in advertising(everyone puts similiar things on their fliers), and people 
were talking about going. The second iteration of this thread started because 
of the same thing, but with a different person bringing up the issue.

Yup, but we both stand up for what we believe in, something that I find

No issue here, I remember a few years back... Just saying that things are 
still going on where the info is not widely disseminated. Also I would 
question anything that is not "underground" automatically being 
commercial. I associate commerical with profit.

I don't see you whining. You are expressing an opinion. 

I wouldn't call PLUR "rubbish" at all, but find it very tired sometimes, 
especially when people use it as a weapon in an attempt to shut people up.

I see no problem with this form of communication either, and find it a 
very valid method. It's analogous to a phone. While one may prefer to 
discuss matters in person rather than through a telephone, it is still

There is also a very fine line between opinion and accusation, and I feel 
we may not agree on what that line is. Further, my understanding of libel 
and slander is that they involve "malicious intent." I have never had any 
such intent.

Valid and to be encouraged when possible, but useable on a larger scale, 
unlikely. At least we can agree that both our methods are "valid."

I was referring to you getting in contact with someone you had a problem 
with(me) before making statements publicly. I do have a better 
understanding now that you felt I was attacking Martin personally, which 
is why you came out swinging. I hope that my statements to the contrary 
have done something to alleviate this.

John, I have been asking, but again, my original intent was not to 
single out Martin. I do apologize if this was not previously clear.

I think that locating spaces, and safety of such spaces may definitely 
contribute to some of this. 

At any rate economics is very much a part of the issue. I see lots and 
lots of flyers from lots of different production companies. And on a very large 
percentage of them, I see things like "we want to bring ALL people 
together," or something very similar, rather it be a free party or a 
$50 NYE mega-rave. And it got me to thinking on the above lines. How can 
someone desire really be to bring all different kinds of 
people(economically AND culturally) if they charge prices that prevent 
this from occuring on any significant scale?

I agree that the media is biased. I would add that they are biased 
against much more than just blacks. They are also biased against illegal 
substances, and the 2nd amendment to name a couple.

Hate is a path as any other. Hitler was not born with a dislike  or 
hatred of Jewish people, and Farrakhan was not either. When however I 
see the fruition of someones hatred as with Hitler, I bring it up, in 
case it can spur the evaluation of where someone else is on that 
path before and if they are handed power and respect.

Peace John.

P.P.S. To anyone else who has bothered to wade through this post:

Much of the above really is between John and myself. However given all 
our past "discussions" I feel compelled to post it publicly just to leave 
things on a more even note. Thank you for your indulgence.

thought I may be losing my hair :(   It is only hair and it can grow 
back. My only problem is I have such little concept of style and don't 
know what to do with short hair.  Part of the reason it's long is cause 
I don't know what to do with it.  I just don't want to look all preppy 
and conservative.  I've been that way and it just isn't me.  Mabey 
shaved and bleached like someone mentioned.  

    I'm going to give my employeer a call tomorrow and talk to her.  If 
I'm lucky they will let it slide.  If not than I think it will have ta 
go.

Thanks again!

I have been through the exact same thing. I have contacted the 
State Labor board  about it. Currently you have no legal recourse unless you 
live in Santa Cruz(?) I think, who has passed an anti-apperance discrimination 
law. Someone correct me on the city if it is incorrect, I am not positive.

Basically you are left with a couple of questions. 

1) Is your hair more important than this job? 
2) What kind of organization is it that will not allow you to be who you 
   are(assuming of course you are clean and not stinky ;-)
   and will you be happy with them in the long term? 

I found a different job. And have managed to ever since, although I have 
encountered this discrimination again. But if you are making a career 
of what you are doing, and everyone is going to require you to cut your 
hair, then deeper consideration is in order.

I hope this is true because when I dance I often lose myself in what feels 
like spastic abandon. It's certainly heart-felt and ecstatic and perhaps 
beautiful because its so free and wild but I'm not sure I'd try out for a local 
dance competition - ya know..

It's nice to see that you can really read people that deeply.

hey Everyone,


  Well my 2nd gathering, and another solid party. 

In the main room, the dj in the center of the dance floor. this
is my favorite set-up, but i think a platform putting the dj about
4 feet above the crowd is more effective then on the ground (via
Liquid Holiday in DC (whatta party!!;)).  Dj Dan and John Williams
were on tight.  When Dan played South Side was the highlight :)

The chill room was rather beat-y with plenty of place to chill and
hang out as well as dance.  I really was excited to hear Alex
Patterson play and he did not disapoint!  Amazing set, mind-fucking
the way he mixed IMO. 

  Over all a good party.  I wasn't sure how i was going to feel
about it at the beginning of the night, but by the time i left
i was glad i had come.  something about these (Gathering, Vision)
parties that make me introspective about my rave goings, and always
a bit more positive about it leaving.

peace,

A week or so ago, I was going to comment on how the vibe on this list had 
taken a very positive turn.  During the winter there wasn't necessarily 
negativity floating around, but rather a pervasive "blah-ness."  There 
was party reviews (always nice IMO), but that was about it.  No spirit.  
Then, somehow, with the advent of spring, things changed and things got 
much cheerier.  It was really cool.  Everyone was talking about how they 
got to meet everyone else on this list, and moral was amazing.  There was 
a bunch of good-will and really great threads.

I didn't bother to read the Gathering thing because it didn't interest 
me.  A few people posted about how the whole thing sickened them, and a 
couple of newbies were really disillusioned.  Well, when I first subbed to this 
list about 8 months ago, I was put off by things like this.  But, now, 
that I know things come and go, I don't really care.  I just take it for 
what it's worth and partake in what interests me.  When I first subbed, I 
was also new to the whole internet thing, and extremely skeptical of this 
whole information super highway bullshit.  But, since then, I must say 
that I have learned quite a few things.  Some reinforced my skepticism, 
but some also taught me quite a bit.   

I have subbed to other lists (not necessarily rave lists), but I 
usually end up unsubbing because they loose their interest.  But, there 
is honestly something unique about the people on this list.  I have 
never "listened" to such intelligent people with so much insight.  I 
have truly enjoyed this.  I have enjoyed expanding my music interests 
and participating in political discussion.  And somehow everything almost 
always relates to some aspect of raving.  I am sure a lot of this has to 
do with the fact that it centers around the Bay Area, which in itself is 
a unique place that we are all drawn to.  

For anyone who is disenchanted right now, just wait around.  This is a 
neat place to be.  So, I guess my post is kind of a "tribute" to the 
intelligent, generous, and unique atmosphere that is generated here.  
Each person plays a part, and I, for one, enjoy everything.  (But, alas, 
I am a perpetual optimist!!!!)

I soon hope to meet many of you.  I will once again appear from hiding 
this coming weekend (thank gawd) and more in the future.  But, in the 
meantime, my energy still goes out to everyone.



Cheers, 
kc

Just saw this on Hyperreal and don't think it's been posted lately...
Just what I needed to make it through the rest of this hellish Monday!
	Enjoy!!!

-------
Top Several Signs Your Rave Is About to Get Busted.

 -  Those guys in suits standing next to the front door.
 
 -  The laser prints 'Raid...get...out...now....' on the back wall.
 
 -  When you go to watch the DJ spin, and all you find is a mixtape on on
    auto-reverse.
 
 -  The people shouting 'ECSTASY, GET YER ECSTASY HEAH!...'
 
 -  Spritely teenagers run around shouting "whee, I'm so fucked up"
 
 -  The deaf little old lady in her housecoat and slippers comes
    over to see what "all that racket" is about
 
 -  The local TV station arrives to do a fluff piece on "evil all-night
    dance parties"
 
 -  A parent walks around with a flashlight checking out every E-ing
    couple making out in the chill room
 
 -  Those neat new flashing lights *aren't* intellabeams
 
 -  Your thoughts mysteriously turn to bacon
 
 -  You begin imagining cold metal on flesh
 
 -  You hadn't noticed those siren sounds in that song before
 
 -  You're on a roof top and the live drummer starts up
 
 -  Someone just offered a balloon to the fire marshall
 
 -  People are setting off fireworks in the ecological preserve 
 
 -  The guys from mixing lab just found out where your location is
 
 -  Your power fails, but the streetlight is still on...
 
 -  Your beeper goes off and the number is "50505050"...
 
 -  The cops are talking to your liaison people for the fourth time, but
    this time they're pointing into what all your maps said was nothing
    but undeveloped forest...

Hello everybody,

I just thought I would throw this out to the group, in the hope of 
finding some leads. My boyfriend and I would like to move into a 
warehouse and it is turning into a daunting task to find live-in places, 
matching the criteria we have. We would like to live in the SOMA area, 
not have it be too exorbitantly expensive, have a drive-in garage. My 
boyfriend is in a band, so it needs to be very noise friendly (sound 
studio). Does anybody have some clues or some better resources than I? It 
would be *greatly* appreciated, and it could be a place for future 
parties, if anything works out...Or is it futile...? Thank you, Talilla

this is pretty random, but at least it's not about the gathering flame wars!

i was just sitting here cracking my trick shoulder (yuck!) and thinking ...
i was just remembering that at the black dog show (last year?) there was a
full-on, licensed masseur/physical therapist giving brief massages for, i
dunno, five bucks or so.  he brought his workbench and everything, and i
was a damn fine experience to have all the kinks worked out of you by
somebody who _really_ knew what he was doing.  i also never realized until
then exactly how much the headpiece on those tables looks like those
deluxe padded toilet seats. :)

anyway, i just thought that it would be really great if this guy -
or one of his compatriots - came out to one of the rave events upcoming 
(harmony?)  

of course, if wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets.  let there be spam!

since you're gonna do it anyway, i think you should shave the top and braid
the sides and back up into a samurai-style top-knot. i mean, how often do
you really get to walk around acting like one of the seven samurai for a
week?

you could tell everyone you want to be called "yojimbo".

Having the DJ on the dancefloor (at the same level as the dancers) is sort
of traditional here in SF.  It is symbolic that this is not a rock concert
and that the DJs are not to be worshiped as rock idols, they are just like
everyone
else and above all, there should be no "spectators".  've found that in practice
this seems to work well, most DJs I know seem to prefer this arrangement in that
you can feel the crowd and the crowd can feed you energy (especially the folks
down front :).  Sometimes it opens you up to unexpected attacks (like when some
dude who has had too much of whatever and decides the DJ is Satan and must be
destroyed, or when God speaks to some gal and tells her to lift the tone arm
so she can deliver his message) but in the long run many wounldn't have it
any other way.

  Is the arrangement unique to San Francisco -- or, at least, is it 
practised here more than elsewhere?

Straight from CCH Human Resources Management report (a report on the law re: 
HR) para. 2384A:

>> [re: federal discrimination laws] A dress code that prohibits jewelry on 
men but not on women, or a regulation that restricts hair length only on men 
is not sexual  discrimination against men.

Enforcement of different grooming or dress policies for men and women is 
permitted under discrimination laws if the policy is not:
        - used to inhibit equal access to employment
          opportunities between men and women;
        - an employer's attempt to deny employment
          to a particular sex; and/or
        - a significant employment advantage to either sex. <<

A few lines later:
>> [a company's] rule, in all likelihood, will prevail if there is 
reasonable justification for the restriction, and [the company has] not been 
lax in enforcing the rule. <<

I can empathize: I was in the U.S. Navy for six years.  Women could grow 
their hair to the ground if they wanted, with the only requirement that they 
keep it above their collar when in uniform.  I did let my bangs grow to my 
chin (_way_ longer than the max. length allowed for men), but had to use a 
gallon of gel every morning to keep them glued to the top of my head :P

Good Luck!

Does It Matter?
     written by an anonymous high school student and apppears in the book:
     Growing Up Gay.

My father asked if I am gay.
I asked, "does it matter?"
He said,  "no, not really."
I said "yes."
He said,  "get out of my life"
I guess it mattered.

My boss asked if I am gay.
I asked, "does it matter?"
He said,  "no, not really."
I said "yes."
He said, "you're fired, faggot!"
I guess it mattered.

My friend asked if I am gay,
I asked, "does it matter?"
He said,  "no, not really."
I said "yes."
He said, "don't call me your friend."
I guess it mattered.

My lover asked "do you love me?"
I asked, "does it matter?"
I said "yes."
I told him, "I love you."
He said,  "let me hold you in my arms."
For the first time in my life, something matters.

My God asked me, "do you love yourself?"
I said, "does it matter?"
He said, "yes."
I said,  "how can I love myself? I am gay."
He said,  "that's the way I made you."
Nothing again will ever matter.

I've seen similar arrangements at parties in Seattle, Columbus, Austin, 
and Houston--and have been to parties in SF where this was not practiced.

Hey all

I recently found a flyer for an upcoming party called Progress.  Found 
this little tiny 2"x4" green flyer with a simple black design 
photocopied onto it amongst a huge number of enormous multi-colored 
computer graphic flyers for such parties as Lucky Charms.  According to 
the voicemail recording, there have been 8 Progress parties so far, and 
this one is their one year anniversary.  Has any one ever been to any 
of these Progress parties, & if so, how were they?  So far this sounds 
interesting to me, the party's on April 20th, would be interested in 
hearing if anybody else has any opinion on them.  Each party appears to 
be based on each of the Celestine Prophecy's Nine Insights (I think 
this one addresses #8), which seems pretty cool *so far*, but as usual 
you can never tell about a party if you don't know anything about the 
people who put it on.  The voicemail number is (415) 974-4391, maybe 
some of you can tell "The Signs" to look for with voicemail recordings 
as well as the signs you all have listed for flyers? ;)  According to 
the voicemail, Ethan's spinning, among other recognized names, can't be 
all bad, eh?

So, anybody have any opinions or experience with these particular 
parties?


Love,
Shawna

Actually, in the last issue of the Beastie Boys' mag "Grand Royal" there's
a 5-page article devoted to the "schlong." in it they list almost all of
the popular names for the haircut. I can remember the following:

schlong
safety cut (safe from parental disapproval while still maintaining an air
of faux teen rebellion, that is)
soccer rocker
hockey haircut
ape drape
neckwarmer
butt cut
mullet
Billy Ray Cyrus

Hi!
  There have been massage people at every Harmony that I have played at 
(including their first one :)  ). I don't know if Greg and friends have 
had them at the last two or three (which I couldn't make :(  ) and I do 
not know if they will have one this time but lets hope. My back gets a 
little funky now and a then (from a mountain bike accident -- do NOT 
tumble 150 feet down the side of a cliff). I had a massage therapist help 
me at Shamen (in SF at the Warfield Theatre) and it put my head in such a 
magnificent space, especially since he was doing it for free =) !!!!!!!

Now, I can't let you go off and diss breakdancing.  Ol' Hannibal Selecta 
and I took a breakdancing class here at UCD last quarter and it was quite 
fun.  True, the only thing I really learned how to do with any skill is a 
simple side slide, but it was pretty darn fun.  I even went and rented 
Breakin' (Boogaloo Shrimp went to Portola Jr. High in my home town of 
Orange, CA !!)...  So don't go puttin' down breakdancing... maybe you 
should try it! :D

I don't know if this was talked about yet, and I'm too lazy to read all 
the posts about the Gathering, but did anyone catch David Holmes' set?  I 
really wanted to see him (I don't think he's been out to SF anytime in 
recent history), but I didn't want to fork out the $.  So how was he? Anyone?

Maybe practiced more, but not unique to. Earth 2 Sea, Doc Martin's afterhours 
in LA back in '92 (and incidentally the club that got me to appreciate house music) was 
set up so Doc was in the middle of the dancefloor, which created a great 
energy.

The now seemingly in disguise Brian Darkness gives incredible massages.  I
had the pleasure of experience about 15 minutes worth at a Crysalis party
once.  He opened up some channels and doors I didn't even know I had....and

I played live ambient and dj'd ambient at two of these parties, along with
Consciousness Lab Ambient Sound Research.  Both parties were really good as
far as I am concerned.  Everyone I knew that went to them with me had a
great time as well.  The only beef I've had is that the two I went to were
held at Acme, and I don't like that location....but otherwise, they were cool.

Funny you should mention massage, Matt!  I'm studying techniques on my own,
and hope to put them to good use at parties in the future, for whoever
would like whatever level of massage.  My only fee would be a hug, and
maybe some water :)

I'll second Leslie's comments; this was probably the best boat party
Janie & I have ever been on.  Sold out, but not oversold, 2
good sound systems, excellent Djing, beautiful crazy
vibe.  (Hey Brenda, it was nice meeting/dancing with you!)

Galen started the off downstairs with a set that rocked while
Allen excreted some trippy weirdness - everything from jungle to
King Crimson to ??? - on the upper deck which went very well with the 
moving floor.  John Howard followed Galen with some rollocking house,
But it was Darkhorse who may have been the musical highlight for us. The
shit he's been spinning lately, dubby funky chunky crunchy munchy with 
tons of cool samples (Clink Eastward westerns, guitar feedback, etc.),
and some noisy nutty hip hop.  Solar finished up downstairs
with some more house and up above I finally got a taste of Professor 
Smith - great stuff: he spun some stripped down jungle tunes giving 
me the opportunity to figure out how to dance to the stuff.  I'll get
it one of these days.

Besides all the great music & people, there were the wonderful
sights of the bay: the city, the fog, the bridges, the water.
I never get sick on boats (unlike Solar who thankfully did not
puke on the spinning turntables), but I do become quite a klutz -
so apologies to everyone whose feet I stepped on, must of been about
150 of you.

The only downer was that I had some equipment I had to bring to/from
the boat, so I had to park nearby in the heart of the Pier tourist
area.  $25 garage parking for a $20 party!  Guess we'll be eating a
lot of ramen noodles for dinner over then next few weeks. ;) 

And for those of you who love Sunset but are getting bummed by the
size of the crowd: this Saturday, from 1 to 8pm there's a free
(food donation for Open Hand) party at the Presidio.  DJs
include Tracy and Solar, and they have a permit.  I don't have
the flyer, but hopefully it will get onto the calender.  L8er ;)

Personally I think DJ's (unlike children) should be heard and not seen.  One
of my (only) dislikes about Wicked is that everyone seems to stand in lines,
facing the dj booth.  It feels terribly regimented and because of it there
seems to be a lot less interaction between people than there could be.

I seem to remember one Wicked (Masters at Work?) where the Djs where upstairs.
This, to me, works much better.  People focus at lot less on *who* is spinning
and more on what is being played (which helps avoid the 'rock idol' syndrome).

I would recommend checking it out...I went to two of them, which 
were good (albeit the Acme thing). When I did the map-point for one of 
them, I noticed a great-vibey-type of group going in (no yucky 
attitudes...). Jane, who throws this party, usually gets DJs who do 
their job :) and she is concerned with the atmosphere of the party. I'm  
glad she's still able to throw Progress, and it's not too Celestine 
based, but there is usually an alter of some sort. Basically, the odds 
are in favor of this being a party you might enjoy! Hope that helps, Talilla

So that brings up the question of whether or not to post reviews of these 
"super secret underground parties" on sfraves. 

If I had not been "in the know" about this great little free party and 
then kept hearing all kinds of wonderful things about it posted on 
sfraves, I would be feeling pretty bitter and it brings up those feelings 
of elitism.  

I kind of have a rule of thumb that I live by: if it is not a party that 
we can post about on sfraves prior to it happening, then we should not 
post reviews about it either.   It is kinda like rubbing it in everyone 
else's face..."nya nya nya! I'm more connected to the cool stuff than 
youuuuu are!!"

This is just how I feel about it....any other thoughts or comments?

love,
Amy

Subject: A Green Door Review

   I've been wanting to check out the Green Door on Friday nights for weeks 
   and finally got a chance to last Friday.  The cover was only $5 (I think 
   we came in after midnight, so it might have dropped in price) and the 
   venue is that wonderful little restaurant in Stevenson Alley nr 10th.
   
   The space is great w/r/t the lighting, mirrors, loungey booths, and 
   simple classic architecture with the exception of the location of the 
   dance area but that can't be helped due to the floor plan of the 
   restaurant.  Groovesters should note that the dance area is also on 
   carpet.  The space is very conducive to conversations in the bar/booth 
   area which is great for socializing.
   
   While I came specifically to hear Thomas play (I've got a thing for his 
   style these days!), the entire time I was there, Felix played.  The 
   style of music (to me) is funky, trip-hopping, deep grooving music 
   that's similiar to what's played upstairs at Roots (though it's been a 
   while since I've been to Roots, too!).  
   
   Since it's only been around for a short while, things haven't quite 
   picked up #'s-wise but I hope so 'cause it's a sweet set-up I'd go to 
   again to dance and schmooze a bit w/o having to deal w/an all night 
   crowded dance.  From my assessment of attendees it's more diverse than 
   any other club I've been to for a while w/clubbers, trendy fashion 
   plates, ravers, and even a few artistes.  The mix of people made it a 
   delight for me to go "clubbing" again.
   
   See ya on the dance floor,
   Diane

Thanks. 
Only problem is, (perhaps a new study), do headtrips get worse when one
knows exactly what is going on inside his/her brain? (OH SHIT! I'M RELEASING

Given the response to the coffee "undrugged" question, I think I will be
bringing a coffee maker and the accompaniments to parties I help with (FnF,
Chrysalis - to start).  I think espresso would be a much bigger commitment,
in that it would require a machine that could recharge fast, and keep a
steady stream of steam (say THAT three times ;^)  Plus someone would have
to be with it all night.

My thought was to have a 20 cup coffee maker, and then a thermos to hold
about 20 cups.  That means at any one time we could have about 40 cups of
coffee available.  Also, that means one person doesn't have to stand around
making coffee for everyone, but once in a while someone could make a fresh
pot (or should that be a "dope" pot?)  I don't see myself standing around
making coffee for everyone, but rather making it available to everyone.

Coffee maker, thermos, filters, good fine ground coffee, sugar, cream and
cups are the only other requirements I can think of.  I'll package it all
in a milk crate to make it easily portable, like the alter material.

Thank for your thoughts on the matter.  Now all we need is a name.  Hmmm?
How about: Kophee, Coughy, Caw-fee.  Tag line:  Fuck that herbal E, drink
coffee!

I really should focus this energy on work...

Peace!

Don't know about the above, but here's another interesting thought...Imagine 
being able to develop the ability to stimulate the release of Serotonin on 
demand!  Like the people who believe every part of the body is controllable 
and can control their heartrate, etc...  What fun!

I think that you all should here this. So I'm going to lend my keyboard and 
posting rights on this list to a close friend. My appologies in advance if it 
bums some of you out.  But I think it's important. And yes, it is rave related. 
-C.S.


Hello Friends...

Beware... On Saturday evening I attempted to introduce a friend into the raving 
world via The Gathering.  My friend, a pretty heavy Deadhead and very open to new 
experiences, talked me into heightening our experience in a rave way.  Nothing 
new to either of us but the consequences of our actions would be.  Having failed 
to plan ahead, we then did something that I rarely ever do, trust my health, 
safety, and sanity to some completely unknown individual (that may sound stupid 
but I think you know what I mean).  The following experience was hellish to say 
the least, and lasted all of the way through to Monday morning. In fact my hands 
are still shaking as I type this meassage.  Poisoned would be an understatement.  
Three times as bad as my worst flew experience, maybe.  I am completely and 
totally angry with myself, for after 5 years in the scene, being naive enough to 
think that everybody at such an event operates under the same morals and ethics 
that my friends do.  They in fact do not.

Beware... Both my friend and I have been through some pretty serious stuff in the 
past and are in no way new to this scene and the experiences often associated 
with it.  I am forever in debt to my friend and while I considered myself and old 
pro (pretty jaded huh?), I couldn't have made it through without his help.  With 
the "Bro your gonna be all right" mantra still in my head my sympathies go out to 
those who were unlucky enough to run into the same person that we did that 
evening.

Beware...I remember being at the Fashion Center in '92 when some punk pulled a 
gun on a friend of mine because she was trying to make him smile.  That's when I 
knew that things had changed.  I stayed away for a little while but slowly made 
it back.  After last Saturday it's gonna take a whole lotta convincing.

Beware and be careful.

i can buy that - it took me a while to work up to it myself.  and well it
should - it was an extremely intense experience.  not to knock amateur
massages, which are delightful of course, but the pros really do take it
to a completely different level.  you could feel muscles and joints moving
around and relaxing that you didn't even realize you had until they got
worked on!  it's probably just one of those things that you have to get
rolling, and then people will say, yeah, i gotta try that too.

anyway, i'll conclude my random blithering by saying that if you get n
opportunity to try this out while _altered_ :) or after intense physical
exertion (groovin'!), DO IT.  you won't regret it.

heard a sound bite from a rave promoter a while back, saying that a rock
concert involves thousands of people all facing the same way and looking
at the stage, while a rave is more orientation-neutral - interpret that
how you like.

seems to me that the lighting shows are more to blame for getting
everybody to face front and zone than the dj stack - i think it would be
nice (although prob. tricky) to get more of a surround lighting effect so
you wouldn't miss much by not staring at the speakers.

of course, you can always just turn around and dance upstream like a
salmon.  try it sometime when nobody else is - it's sort of a neat little
head trip, especially at really big events.

        You always have the BEST quotes to give out :) Thanks.  Recently
i've been learning that this idea is applicable everywhere, and has
somewhat of a scientific basis. The idea of 'following the beat of your own
drum and dancing in harmony with the universe' is totally a complexity
theory (next step after chaos theory) idea. Complexity sees things as being
systems and processes, all interweaving on various micro-to macro scales.
Your human body has certain processes and cycles going on and if you're in
touch with those cycles you're also in touch with the cycles around you.
So, if you look within and feel like you should do/be something, no matter
how 'illogical' it's possible that this is the sensing of larger
socio-economic and whatever 'psycho-spiritual' cycles that are 'around us'
(but also part of us). So, by listening to that inner voice, and following
it, you always end up being exactly at the right place, at the right time
and doing the right thing and that, to me, makes me feel really alive. :)
        Thing is, i think, is that everyone's 'calling' (in the large
'career' picture or what they should be doing at a rave) is different, so
one can't really tell someone else what's best for them, one can only speak
from personal experience. To make this a lil' rave related, when i don't
have a ton of fun at a party, and someone else asks my opinion on it i'll
say "well i didn't have the best time, did you?" because i know that 'in
reality' a party can be BOTH good and bad, depends on your subjective
experience :)
        Well, i guess it was my 'calling' today to babble pointlessly ;)

        peace,
                brad

        I totally think so. I'm not a biochemist (or even have any training
related to science really, just an inquisitive mind) but everything works
on feedback, why should the neurochemical/experiential brain/body work any
differently?
        Sometimes you can even convince yourself that you're high when
you're not, and soon (i think) your brain will make itself high by
releasing/inhibiting the right neurochemicals just as you would if you were
high. Getting "high" is only teaching your brain how to do something.
After you have to try to get it to do it on it's own, without the training
wheels ;) IMHO, of course, but i know that thinking certain ways brings
'natural' highs that are totally wild :)

Here's a good example why it is important to have a responsible
promoter who can work with the authorities to throw legal,
safe, permitted parties in cooperation with local police.  Keeping
the scene completely underground (i.e. illegal) can have dire
consequences for the entire scene, as it apparently has in Salt Lake 
City.  Ignorance breeds suspicion.  - Lee 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Please forward this to whomever else might find it interesting.

We've been having quite a controversy in Salt Lake City Utah RAVES.
The Rumor is that we SERVE alcohol and GANGS intitiate their members.
How realistic Does this seem to you?
The past three months or so almost every party has been busted.  Some
Ravers have  lost hope.  We need help out here in SLC to prove to our
community that RAVES are not what they think they are.

Subject:  What is your knowledge of RAVES? -Reply

Dear Ms. Lynch:

Thank you for your inquiry regarding Rave parties.  Governor Mike
Leavitt has requested that I respond to your questions directly.  

Because the Rave party phenomena is taking place mostly in the Salt
Lake City area, I contacted the Salt Lake City Police Department Vice
Squad to discuss your concerns.  Sgt. Kenneth W. Hansen responded
that Rave Parties are a problem for the police department because they
have found that the individuals who sponsor the parties do not have
business licenses, therefore, putting those who attend the parties at risk.
Through licensing, businesses are required to meet certain health and
safety codes.  They must also meeting bonding requirements to protect
them from liability issues.  An unlicensed business could be a potential
death trap.  The issue, therefore, is not Constitutional.  

Sgt. Hansen also indicated that there is a historical record of alcoholic
beverages being served to minors at these parties.  Not only is this in
violation of state laws, it poses a serious threat to the safety and
welfare of the drinker and the public at large.  It is also my understanding
that Rave Parties are intentionally covert and secretive to avoid scrutiny
by officials that are charged with public safety, licensing and taxes.  A
Rave Party would be considered a legal function if those sponsoring the
party complied with all city, county, state and federal laws.  

In regards to gang activity at these parties, officers from the Salt Lake
Area Gang Project have reported that gang violence and recruiting have
taken place at Rave Parties.  There is also residual activity occuring
outside of the Rave Party location where rival gang members have been
involved in violent and criminal activity as of a result of being attracted to
the Rave Party in the first place.

I do not believe it is the intent of our cities to deny young people the
opportunity to congregate and attend parties.  It is, however, the
responsiblity of local and state government to ensure that the health and
safety of young people are preserved.

Sincerely,

Susan Burke
Anti-Violence Coordinator

Subject: seeking pioneer cdj-500 mk II DJ CD player in the bay area

I want to look/touch/feel/play with this unit before laying down the
big $$$. THe problem is that absolutely nobody in the Bay Area has a
clue about this unit. The pro audio stores that I called snickered and
said crap like "we do not stock karaoke equipment" or "we're purveyors
of only the finest in digital audio equipment", etc. DJ/Music stores
didn't have a clue, or at best stocked the Denon or the NuMark.

So anybody know where one of these beasts lives or is sold so I can
check it out?? Seems like Pioneer is doing a great job in trying to not
sell these units....

I did manage to find one source that could mail order these units (with
an additional 2 week delay for special ordering):

	J&R Music/Computer World, NYC (1-800-221-8080)

	CDJ-500 mk II	-- $599.95 ea. (need 2 of these CD player units)
	DJM-500		-- $799.00 ea. (need 1 of these master controllers)
	
they also mentioned 
	
	S-500 -- $2299.95 (2 CD player, controller, mixer (?), & case)

Shipping is 3%, Non NY residents need not pay sales tax.

Are these good prices? Any suggestions on other places to look for mail
order, as well as any Bay Area locations that has this unit on
display??

PS: what do people think of the S-500. Is the mixer and case worth the
additional money?

PPS: where on earth can i get more information on these units. The
folks at Pioneer Amerikkka didn't even know they produced that kind of
unit....

PPPS: anybody know if these have a digital out? how about remote
control? (i now have the additional need of replacing my stereo's CD
player since it just conked out and isn't worth the $139.00 fixing fee
Sony is charging...

PPPPS: please make $$$-offers or tech suggestions on fixing/recycling
the following pieces of semi-functional audio equipment:

	* Technics SL-1100A turntable (that's right, an old 1100, not the 1200
				       ... works ok, tonearm gimble was abused)
	* AIWA ADF-800 3 head tape deck (1 channel of output is silent).
	* Sony CDP-75 ES 5 CD changer. (goes crazy after playing a CD for 30
	  minutes).

My thoughts have fluctuated on this one.  There once was a time when I 
read everyone facing the same direction as a vestige of the 
_hierarchized_ spectator/performer dichotomy epitomized by rock concerts.  
However, I have had a change of opinion.  It _can_ serve to minimize the 
self-consciousness of other dancefloor environments (where the moves have 
names, and where people are there to be seen, whether they like it 
or not), while at the same time, heightening and making most diffuse the 
_presence_ and _energy_ of the collectivity.  Everyone is in the 
periphery, making the group, rather than any individual, the _object_ of 
attention.  This said, everything has to do with _context_, 
particularly the specific spatial arrangement of the given party 
environment.  My desire that everyone more-or-less face the same direction 
is not universal.  The mainfloor setup at Come-Unity is one example of a 
mixed set-up, where you have two dancing groups -- let's call them the Jets 
and the Sharks -- facing each other.  Unlike in Westside Story, however, 
there is no competition between the groups, and no one has knives ;).

Depending on the situation, I'll occasionally feel compelled to do the 
same.  However, I am conscious of how the direction of my gaze can have 
an effect on other individuals' level of self-consciousness.  Rok.

Amy, 

Thanks for posting!  I feel the same way.  I have been attending raves 
for 2 years, but I have been a raver in my heart for all of my life.  I 
believe it is bad form to talk publicly about something that was not 
available for the public.

I don't know.  I mean, this is a newsgroup, not a party line, so if a party
doesn't get posted to SFR does that mean it's exclusive?  I'm sure there
are lots of parties that don't get posted, mainly because when that
happens, there's the potential for hundreds upon hundreds of people showing
up.  Some venues can't hold that.

>If I had not been "in the know" about this great little free party and

But if it's a word of mouth party, then I guess people just have to realize
that there was a good party that happened that they didn't know about
becuase they didn't know anyone involved.  It's not elitism, it's just the
nature of life.  You can't know everyone or get invited to everything and
have to be comfortable in accepting that.  If someone is truly bitter then
maybe that should be a call for them to become more involved in the scene,
by helping a group, or just showing a sincere commitment to the cause,
getting to know people.

Believe it or not, we all have missed lots of small parties.  Even you Amy!
;^)  And would you feel bitter if someone posted about a party they had
fun at, or would you say, "Right on!  I'm glad a party went off.
Hmmm...maybe I'll email the person that posted and let them know I'd love
to get involved with the next little party they throw."

The really interesting thing about this scene is that we are extremely
fortunate on SFR to have access to where most of the parties are happening
here in SF.  Prior to SFR, what was there a phone tree or something?  I
just recently met a guy who says he raves but didn't know how to find out
about them.  I have a friend visiting from Australia and he wanted to know
what was happening around the city.  Was there a paper he could get to find
out about parties?  And you know, there really isn't, at least that I know
of.  The Guardian will list what's happening at 1015, or Bahia, but where
is The Gathering listed?  How do new people find out about even massives?

Anyway, I guess the question is whether people should post about
undergrounds that aren't listed here on SFR, and I think that's my round
about way of saying I think it's all right, that most promters in the Bay
area are not intentionaly exclusive, but rather have to keep in mind
spacing and crowd control issues.

Tony

we also had this problem in detroit with alot of our raves being 
UG.  once there was a report on the 6:00 news about our "rave parties" 
having underage drinking, gambling, and *prostitution*!!  funny what 
people will create out of nothing 2 make a story.  it is definately 
necessarry to have a good, safe, legal venue and all the proper permits to 
keep insane stories like this from killing the familys rep. (but the UG 
parties are so much fun!!)

I generally prefer openness to cliquishness, unfortunately the fact
that the police are undoubtedly reading this list means that some
secrecy is needed. An open invitation to an underground provides a
much-too-easy tip-off on what they consider "illegal activity" (i.e. an
underground party that isn't greasing the palms of SFPD for protection,
and bribing the SF Fire Department to overlook fire regulations). I'm
of course speaking about undergrounds/raving in general -- not about
the legality of particular the underground party in SF on Saturday
night.

At least when it is spoken about online & after-the-fact one can ask,
"say friendly raver... remember me?? ... next time one of these
happens, could you let me know...."  while at the same time, not giving
a heads-up advance warning to the police infiltrators on SFRaves. At
least in that way, if the person is a cop, the wise would proably at
least get to know them well enough to vibe them before inviting them to
one's parties. Of course, the best undercover/infiltrators are really
good at being two-faced about this (so please, everybody, be careful!).

Although this is a bad analogy, the "underground railroad" that helped
free slaves in the Southern US and bring them to the north was an
illegal and secretive activity that required such measures of
cliquishness to guard against a clearly immoral and unjust "law". The
underground railroad activities were illegal and prosecutable in those
times, but are seen as heroic nowadays. Perhaps the fight to freely
assemble and party/dance/whatever in any location at any hour may be
seen as illegal nowadays -- but who knows how stupid your laws may look
in the future.

Hello, a friend of mine from Los Angeles is coming up to SF this weekend
and he would like to hook up with some plurry sf-ravers.  Andy is
a well-known socal-raver who's soundsystem and DJ skills have powered
many free, outdoor ODP parties in LA.  Unfortunately, I will be in
socal this weekend... sucks huh?  

Andy's email is: andy@intelenet.com... he is not on sfraves.

hi -

i had originally agreed with amy as far as the concept of the intention
behind the post.  but, when i read tony's post, i didn't feel the energy
behind it was "na na na na na, i went to an underground party and you
didn't!"  i felt he was truly sharing some positive energy about an
experience that he felt good about.  so, i don't think it's that there
should be that you should or you shouldn't but your reason or intention
for posting or not posting.  did that make sense?

Hmmm, not sure about the lighting.  Look at Wicked, where the projections
are at the back, yet most people seem to face forward.  I think what would
really help this would be speakers all round, rather than lighting (and
moving the DJ booth).

Not if they're facing the DJ, which would make him/her (the individual) more 
the focus than "the group".

To be honest, I can't stand having people all face the same direction.  I find
it really boring and am more or less constantly changing which way I'm facing
while dancing.  I find I pick up more "energy" looking at other people, all
getting into the same thing.  Everyone's so different, that's what I enjoy
about it (confessions of a chronic people-watcher :-).

I'd never thought about any possible effect on someone else's self-consciousness
 - I don't stare at people, I'm usually just looking around, smiling a lot,
having a good time.  It's the individuals that make the whole experince fun -
the ones you meet, the ones you share a dance space with for a while, etc.

yeah.. then you could have panning effects moving back and forth through the
crowd. now _that_ would be fun. :)

Thanks for all of your concern you guys, I'll make sure to pass the vibe along.  
I invite you to make the mail you sent to me available to the group as well.  It 
seems that quite a few of you HAVE RECENTLY GONE THROUGH THE SAME THING.  That is 
scary as hell so let others know immediately! Illegal or not a life comes first 
period.  

When JC wanted me to post this to you guys I was hesitant my reasons being 
twofold.  First there are those on this list who feel that it is best to keep 
quiet about this sort of thing, in most cases I agree.  And second I didn't want 
my name forever associated with this topic on the infinite annals of the 
Internet.  BUT YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THESE GUYS (even the day after) SERIOUSLY!! A 
happy EEEAster they did not have. I really can't beleive that other people have 
been through this and I've read nothing of it on this list. 'Nuff said. 

I'll make sure to pass your concerns along.

You know I hadn't thought about it that way before.  (*sigh*) I was just so
happy to have finally gone out to a little get together. . . I hadn't been out
since September!  I hope that no one took offense!

This is a good point.  Facing in the direction of the dj may, 
however, be partly symptomatic of something else you bring up -- speaker 
location/orientation.  Also, when the dj's are situated on the ground level 
-- as I like them to be in most situations -- you can't really see her/him if 
you're beyond the first few rows of concentric circles/semi-circles.

Yup, I like eye-contact, too, and getting off on how other people are 
going off.  I didn't want to make it seem like I wore horse blinders or 
something.  It's just that, in general, having my body generally 
oriented in the same direction as everyone else's makes, IMO, for the 
highest degree of dancefloor selflessness.  Once again, this depends on 
circumstances, and is far from a rule for me.  

Let's examine the act of freaking.  On a couple of occasions at a 
rave/rave-style event, I've been approached by women seeking to do the old 
bump'n'grind.  Nothing inherently wrong with this form of dancefloor 
intimacy -- it was just the wrong dancefloor.  I felt kinda selfish dancing 
this way, since my energy was being focussed on one individual (not to 
mention body region) and not to the body-at-large.  This may just be my 
own strange over-analysis of the situation.  Stangely enough, I kinda like 
when heterosexual men or women get together for a good same-sex freak cuz' 
I'm down with people feeling free enough to toy with such boundaries.  
(Same could be said for homosexual "transgressions").  _Elevated 
same or mixed group dancefloors hugs (not too long) and freak sessions are 
cool, too, cuz' it's fun to see just how fucked up they are ;).  I draw 
the line at drunk-funk-mac-daddy-gap-band-party-trains.

Tony's post also enlightened me and my stance on the topic.  I think it 
boils down to how the person who posts intends it to sound.  The person 
may *have* that attitude of "I know about these cool parties and you 
don't" or have the attitude that Tony does when posting about these super 
hush-hush raves. Thanks, Tony, for a better, healthier perspective. :)

Wow, whatta party! The trippiness started early for me, as my friend
decided to "find parking" rather than take a bus. Well, we found it
finally, after half an hour of driving around Fisherman's Wharf. The
tourists found my bright hair mesmerizing, and I even saw a couple of them
pointing and taking pictures. Which is fine by me, but still unsettling.

So after walking blocks and blocks through a sea of camera wielding tourists,
I finally saw a guy wearing a silver jacker and funky sunglasses. His
clothes just screamed "Raver!" and sure enough, he was there for the boat
party and pointed me in the right direction (please no flames about what
kind of clothes ravers wear). In fact everyone there seemed especially
colorful and beautiful and dressed up. I have always been struck by the
beauty of the people at raves, which I think is more of a consequence of
our smiles anything else, but this group was dazzling.

The trip around the bay was great fun. I liked dancing in a rocking boat,
since we would get tossed around and gently into each other. It helped
break down the barriers even more than dancing usually does.

We broke into fog just before passing under the Golden Gate Bridge
and having its ghostly presence hovering over us, with fog horns 
blaring, made me feel small and special at the same time. We circled
back into the sun near Marin, missing sunset under the bridge (which
we couldn't have seen anyway) and instead got a close view of the
brilliant greeen, shining hillside. "Shangri-La!", Samona said, and
I had to agree. Marin has always seemed sort of like Shangri-la to me,
but it really looked the part that day.

We had some interesting guests in a seagull that drafted us for
miles, never flapping its wings and a couple of sail boarders who
seemed to get a kick out of our enthusiasm. We made a turn on a dime
in Tiburon (?) harbor. I didn't konw you could spin one of those
boats around that fast. 

Later that night we drove around Alcatraz and passed under the Bay Bridge.
I was inside dancing mostly after dark. The music was actually a little
too quiet for my tastes, first time that has ever happened.

Now, this was a $20 party and "worth it" at least to me. But I think
that charging this much definitely changes the party. Perhaps
it is just me, but at every Sunset I have ever been at, I have felt
an incredibly powerful "love vibe" flowing outward. Sometimes I really
fell like we are creating some sort of magic spell or something. I really
didn't feel that this time. Maybe it was due to the way we were all sort
of broken up around the boat or something else, but while the crowd was
friendly, happy, and beautiful, the vibe wasn't really there for me.

Peace,
Jim

Hello!  I live in Southern California and frequently visit SF for all of
the great parties.  I was supposed to come up last weekend for The
Gathering but didn't make it so I want to attend KUNDALINI this week!  My
problem is that I got the info from the SFRaves calendar and both of the
phone numbers that were listed are disconnected.

Could someone either involved in the party or that has a current flyer,
please get me a working phone number so that I will be able to get
directions to the location on Saturday night, when I arrive in town.  Or if
its not happening let me know, so I can plan to go to A State Of Divinity.

Please reply directly to me (kevinvascon@earthlink.net) because I am not on
SFRaves mailing list.

PLURry Thanks!

i just pulled out a flyer, and the phone numbers on sfrave's web site are
indeed wrong.
the phone #'s should be: 510-895-3550 and 415-337-4928

more from the flyer:
"Beyond Space-Time Productions
What grand temple has been erected for his greatness esteemed principle, his
awesome beauty? Can any place capture the morning rods of golden sun? Or the
beams of the enchantress when she is in full bloom at midnight as her
children, the stars, twinkle and dance in the heavens? There is no place
that has ever been made that could honor such an entity that is all things,
except in you.
Ramtha from the school of enlightenment."

hmmm.. what's the general feeling about this party? has beyond space-time
put on good parties in the past?

I prefer a party where people stand in line facing the DJ booth! Not only
does it give a focus for people's energy, but a lot of people appreciate
being able to watch how the DJ is mixing..especially if he/she is a
technical wizard.  I've only tried mixing a couple of times myself, but that
was enough to realize how hard some of the stuff the great ones do (and make
look easy). I don't feel I've had a complete party experience if I can't see
what's going on. I agree with Neil about the 'rock idol'syndrome, but I
think (hopefully) people aren't focused on _who_  is spinning, but on _how_
they are spinning.  Also, how else can you find out what the name of that
amazing track is if it doesnt't have any words! That's why you'll always
find me front and center...

To any global ravers...

A couple of friends and myself are going to Dortmund, Germany for the
bi-annual Mayday party (you might have seen the video of last years party on
the Spundae video monitors) on Apr 30/May1 and then up to Oxford England for
the Tribal Gathering on May4/5.  We were wondering if any other sfravers
might be going to either one because it would be great to hook up! We are
also in need of an extra ticket to Mayday...any suggestions on how to get
one from here?

Hello Everybody!!! A few of you might remember about a post or three I 
made awhile ago about Reno's deceased rave scene. 
There was a party Saturday night that had a VIBE that left many virgin
ravers in a state of AWE. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I took a few friends with me who had never experienced a rave before, and
wandered off into my own little reality.... only to have them pop up a
little later amazed by it all, and caught in a groove that wouldn't quit! 

The energy in that place was insane!!! It had one of the best vibes I've
ever experienced... I think it had something to do with Bobby Reno from
Salt Lake. He tore the place up!!!! He just kept building and building on
the vibe until almost everyone was jumping up and down screaming and
hollering!!!! It was... to quote my friend at dawn... In-fucking-credible! 

They twisted my arm and apparently we're road tripping to SF & Santa Cruz 
either this weekend or next. So, if anyone has any suggestions as to any 
good parties going on, I'd love to hear about em. 
I'm kinda leaning towards Harmony-- I just got their newsletter about 
Friday's upcoming party and it made me smile. :)

Y'know I've got a list of phone numbers of the cool people I've met off this 
list.  It started with the phone list for the folks from Tahoe, but it's 
growing.  I've also got each of the person's email addresses.  If I was to 
communicate an underground rave, I'd send it the message to people I'd 
actually met.  I don't think I'd be particularly discriminating in any other 
way.  If this also sounds "cliqueish", well, ok, but I see it as being safe.

I know and you all know that, while there may be certain illegal activities 
occurring at some raves, in the grand scheme of things these parties are so 
much safer and more positive than your average beer bust.  For that reason, 
I'd take some sort of precaution to communicating some party information.  
There are some events that deserve to be underground in the sense that 
knowledge of the event is distributed as widely as possible yet carefully 
protected at the same time.

>describe how bad it was. thank goodness i was able to return it!! 
i suppose i should revise my review then.
if you love house and hate breaks, or if you bought Dubnobasswithmyheadman
only for Cowgirl and hated everything else, don't get this album.
On the other hand, if you loved Skyscraper, Born Slippy, and thought
Goldie's Timeless was dope shit, then get it.

i keep forgetting breakbeat/jungle isn't huge around here like in t.o.

Dear Ms. Burke,

	I'm sure most members of the rave community appreciate your 
concern for their welfare.
	I think many of us would also find that concern seriously misplaced.
Government authorities like yours have created a climate in this country 
which does not value free celebrations of life, dance, and music.
	You have created a bureaucratic process which deadens life, and 
laws which seek to restrict our freedom  to do in our own lives and with 
our own bodies as we see fit.
	Not only do you make no attempt to experience or enjoy the rave 
experience yourself, you attempt to prevent others from doing so, in 
violation of both the letter and the spirit of our country's highest law.
	The concept of public service in America today has been twisted 
into a perverted concept of benign paternalism by many of our 
ever-growing number of public servants.  Citizens are not respected and 
looked up to as the rulers of this nation, as we were intended to be, but 
rather looked upon as irresponsible inconveniences hindering the march 
toward a grey new world of method, order, inoffensive blandness and 
complete government control.
	Well, despite your best efforts, there is a vibrant culture 
out here undreamt of in your commission studies, white papers, and 
environmental impact reports.
	It is a culture more sensitive to real quality-of-life issues 
than your drinking laws, health codes, and permit requirements.  This 
culture is not preoccupied with physical and economic security as is the 
establishment.  We are more concerned with protecting people from the 
very real danger of losing touch in our society with what it means to be 
human, to be alive, to *appreciate* and cultivate beauty, creativity, and 
joy.  You mean to safeguard us, but you are only guarding our bodies.  We 
are the watchdogs of the mind, the spirit, and the soul.
	I challenge you to show me where in the Constitution, either in 
the letter or spirit of the highest law of our land from which all our 
other laws derive their legitimacy (or lack thereof) and which is in turn 
dependant on the consent of the governed, it is written or implied that 
you Ms. Burke, or any other elected or appointed official of the state of 
Utah are empowered to disrupt a nonviolent celebration of life.
	The fact is you have no such mandate.  What you are engaged in is 
crimes against humanity -- not (yet) on the scale of those tried at 
Nuremburg, but crimes agasint humanity nevertheless.
	In the name of the ravers, the deadheads, the drug users, the 
poets, the artists, the writers, the freethinkers and free spirits among 
us, I ask you to stop.
	Because we will always be with you -- even in the slave fields 
and the gulags we are with you.  And however much it is expected of you 
to do your job, you always have a choice, no matter how the Hitlers and 
Stalins of the world (both those in a position to reveal their brutality 
and those constrained from doing so) would have you believe otherwise.
	I do not expect you to listen to me seriously.  To do so would go 
against years of training and the culture of the government for which you 
work.  But ravers are an optimistic bunch. We like to find the love in 
everyone.  Freeing this love is what our gatherings are about.  We call 
it "vibe".  If the vibe in your workplace is not on this level, do you 
ever ask why not?  Do you dare to dream that it could be?
	I've never met you Susan, but I know that as a human being you 
are capable of more than processing paperwork, that there have been 
moments in your life when you were too happy to even consider interfering 
with someone else's happiness.  I hope you live to have many more such 
moments, perhaps even at a rave.  If I saw you at one, I would like to 
give you a hug to remind you that the best things in life are free.
	Please, let us be free.

Much love, & best wishes, 
				<<< Starchild >>>

We've been having quite a controversy in Salt Lake City Utah RAVES.
The Rumor is that we SERVE alcohol and GANGS intitiate their members.
How realistic Does this seem to you?
The past three months or so almost every party has been busted.  Some
Ravers have  lost hope.  We need help out here in SLC to prove to our
community that RAVES are not what they think they are.

                                                Your friend,

Subject:  What is your knowledge of RAVES? -Reply

Dear Ms. Lynch:

Thank you for your inquiry regarding Rave parties.  Governor Mike
Leavitt has requested that I respond to your questions directly.  

Because the Rave party phenomena is taking place mostly in the Salt
Lake City area, I contacted the Salt Lake City Police Department Vice
Squad to discuss your concerns.  Sgt. Kenneth W. Hansen responded
that Rave Parties are a problem for the police department because they
have found that the individuals who sponsor the parties do not have
business licenses, therefore, putting those who attend the parties at risk.
Through licensing, businesses are required to meet certain health and
safety codes.  They must also meeting bonding requirements to protect
them from liability issues.  An unlicensed business could be a potential
death trap.  The issue, therefore, is not Constitutional.  

Sgt. Hansen also indicated that there is a historical record of alcoholic
beverages being served to minors at these parties.  Not only is this in
violation of state laws, it poses a serious threat to the safety and
welfare of the drinker and the public at large.  It is also my understanding
that Rave Parties are intentionally covert and secretive to avoid scrutiny
by officials that are charged with public safety, licensing and taxes.  A
Rave Party would be considered a legal function if those sponsoring the
party complied with all city, county, state and federal laws.  

In regards to gang activity at these parties, officers from the Salt Lake
Area Gang Project have reported that gang violence and recruiting have
taken place at Rave Parties.  There is also residual activity occuring
outside of the Rave Party location where rival gang members have been
involved in violent and criminal activity as of a result of being attracted to
the Rave Party in the first place.

I do not believe it is the intent of our cities to deny young people the
opportunity to congregate and attend parties.  It is, however, the
responsiblity of local and state government to ensure that the health and
safety of young people are preserved.

Sincerely,

Susan Burke
Anti-Violence Coordinator

                Hi all,
                This is my first time writing to the list. I come from 
     Dublin and I stumbled across SFR messing around in work one day.
        I think it's brilliant that you have a means of communication for people 
     involved in the scene other than relying on word of mouth (which can be 
     less than reliable) for info. on parties etc.
        I have been into dance music and going clubbing for 3 years now and I 
     have been DJing for the last year.
        From reading the list it seems that San Fran has a very healthy dance 
     scene. Here, unfortunately, it seems that things are beginning to fade a 
     little, although the Temple of Sound in Dublin is one of the best clubs I 
     have ever been to.
        I spent two weeks in San Fran last Summer and I am coming back for 3 
     months this year (with about 15 of my mates) which is why I want to suss 
     out the scene a bit before coming over.
        I only got to go to one club when I was over last time which was 1015 
     Folsam St. one Saturday night. I had a shit night because i got dodgy E's 
     and was on a bad buzz all night. How does that place rate with the other 
     clubs in SF? I like most types of dance particularly Detroit techno jungle 
     and house.
        I have to get back to work now, the fat boss is lurking.
                
                See ya
                        Adam.

I'd like to think that I'm a pretty decent person, I have to live with me 
so at least that's what I tell myself. I don't sell crack, I don't have a 
gun, I don't say "hella" a lot. I get upset every now & then & have my 
bad hair days just like everybody else on this planet, but for the most 
part I'm a pretty mellow guy.

Sometimes all it can take is a few words from somebody and all of a 
sudden you're in a parrall univerise where Spock has a goatee and you're 
an asshole. I don't know, I think some people rave to much, sometimes 
myself included.

On top of that I lost my backpack with *both* my jackets. It's like 
losing your best friend. And it's not like I'm one of those people who 
just carelesslly drops it on some random place on the floor. I put it on 
top of the speakers, so that it can be seen from most corners of the 
room. First time this has ever happen to me. Sun had his backpack gone 
through and his jacket & cash taken. Spent 60 mins. afterwards looking 
through the homebase with no luck & according to security at the lost & 
found some 8 different people also came up with missing possision stories.
Thank you Oakland.

Just got a new Pro Sound and Stage Lighting catalog for DJ's & Nightclubs
They have just about everything in there from Cassettes to Sound Systems to
Complete Lighting and Visual systems and not bad prices either.(IMO)..  for
example
 
1 MTX MX-750 mixer
1 Pro4 DJ case 

2 Soundtech B2 12" 2-way 160-watt full range speakers
2 Technics SL1200-MKII
2 Stanton 500AL Cartridges
1 EV 140-watt power amp
1 microphone
1 HD16 headphones
and speaker, adapter, and patch cables for $1986.72
 
Can someone tell me if this IS a good price? I havn't did much shopping
around, and need to upgrade my turntables and mixer. I was also thinking of
getting better speakers for just home use really. So if you know of any
better ideas feel free to comment.

giving away some records...

bouncy rhythms with highly abrasive jagged drum tones and samples." 

In any event, if you'd like to win a copy of this 4-track 12" single 
here's what you have to do...

	Write a review of a DJ-oriented record that is
	approximately 100 words in length.  Send it to 
	imr@world.std.com and we'll award records to the 
	five best written reviews.  

Good luck, and don't hesitate to enter since it seems that the more effort
the giveaways require the less competition there is.  We may even ask some
of the winners to write for 'slipmat' in the future since we're planning
on turning 'slipmat' into its own e-zine around the same time we convert
imr into a new Web-oriented e-zine. 

If you'd like to check out imr just send the message "subscribe" to
imr-request@world.std.com (note, though, that the e-zine covers a wide
variety of music and therefore some of the content may be of interest to
readers of this list while other content may not).

[ to sfraves list ]

 Who's going to Negativeland this Thursday evening? I'm driving up from 
Sunnyvale and wouldn't mind carpooling with someone. I've got to get into 
work by 9:30AM the next morning , so I would want to head home fairly
soon after the concert. I usually stop off at Sparky's on Church St.
after a S.F. event for a late night snack and a cuppa java before driving
back down south.

 I'm really looking forward to this , especially because the Hardkiss
bros will be "jamming" with Negativeland ...

I also suggest contacting Platinum at 503/222-9166 for equipment prices.
I don't work with the store but I know them well and they have good deals.
Not as big as Pro Sound by any means, but they know their stuff and the
prices are competitive.

 i just moved down to the area from the portland, OR.  platinum is the store 
which i bought my mixer and turntables.  this is how their deals work.  usually 
they are able to give low prices for cash purchases, with credit/check 
purchases being only slightly more.  the owner is a great guy, cuz he said that 
if i'd ever want to sell my decks, he'd buy them back at a good price.  give'em 
a call, it's worth it.
 well that's my two cents worth on equipment.  does anyone know of any good 
spots going off this weekend? (i've been out of town for a long time)

One thing that I really like at raves is that you really can dance 
ANYWHERE.  It doesn't matter if you are by yourself, in a group, near the 
music, far away, etc.  If you feel like dancing, you just do it.  Now, 
when I am at some other party or even in a club, I do this.  It always 
elicits weird looks, and that in turn reminds me of how much I appreciate 
the "rave-atmosphere."  :)

The last Kundalini I went to was in July of 1995.  It was absolutely 
horrible.  I think they had lost their space and had found a last minute 
small dance club to have it in.  This place could only hold about 150 
ppl, but they let in what seemed to be 3 times that amount.  It was so 
crowded that you could not walk one foot.  It was truly the feeling of 
being a herd of cattle.  The heat and humidity got so intense that water 
was dripping off all of the walls.  It was the worst party I have ever 
been to.  I'd be really hesitant to go again, unless I knew that the 
July incident was a freak occurance.  Does anyone have any more information 
about this?

The last few Kundalinis have had bad reports, but the first
three were all very good... The first was at the Trocadero, then Caesars,
then the roller rink at Antioch... and they were a lot of fun.
So... they have the capacity to throw a good party.  Whether they
will again or not remains to be seen.  If it ends up being in a
known good space, I would probably give them the benefit of the doubt,
and give it a chance.

Good Luck,

I've been to three Kundalinis -- the one at the Troc was ok...  the one at
Ceasars, I'd have to say was one of the weirdest parties I've ever been to --
average age 15, hanging out in little clusters -- there was a discount before 11
or something, but then they held the line up and charged the higher amount even
though we'd been waiting in line, saying "you should have come earlier!" --
plus a gangsta element, perhaps due to the geographical location) -- I left that
night at 1:30 a.m.!

But I went to one Kundalini 2 hrs south of Seattle outdoors at Rainbow Valley,
which I'm pretty sure is the same people, and it was really great.... music was
great, well-organized, beautiful location with no hassles....

So I have to concur, the location would make the difference, 'cause the dj
lineup has some of my favorite names in it -- Spun, Garth, Donald Glaude, Quest
(Donald and Quest are from Seattle) -- these guys all really make a place come
alive!  

good luck!  Leslie  : )

Precedence: bulk

A friend needs a bunch of extras for a film she's producing.
Here's your chance to be a star.

---

From: patti@sonic.net (Patti Tufty)

FILM EXTRAS NEEDED ASAP!!!!!!!!!

What is it?:

A film to be shown at the General Motors Pavillion at the Olympics in
Atlanta this summer.

When is it?:

Sunday, April 14th starting at 8am. Extras must be prepared to spend the
day there. Shooting could end early, but may go as late as 5pm.

Who do we need?:

About 100 extras at Stanford Stadium. Friends and family can be in it too..
but children must be old enough to withstand being in one place for an
extended period of time.

What do they get for their trouble?:

Besides the fame? There is no fortune... extras will not be paid. However,
extras will get a free lunch,  and could win some valuable prizes!   They
get the fun and excitement of being part of a real film shoot, and could
get their 15 seconds of fame at the Olympics!

What should they do?:

Contact me, Patti Tufty at 707-664-8519 to get more information and
register. Time is of the essence, so call as soon as possible!

A good thing to do is get a couple of sound catalogs and find the 
cheapest prices and a place like Pro Sound in LA will match your lowest 
price and ship the next day.  I like Pro Sound because their salespeople 
are on the ball and know what they are talking about and are willing to 
bargain if you make a $1500 order.  

love drenalin

ps I'll try to post a couple of phone numbers of a couple of east coast 
places that have equipment and one place I got my 1200's for $389 in 
Sept.   The numbers are at home so I'll try to do it in the next coupla days.

     Well I've been lurking now for 5-6 months, wonder if that's some sort 
     of record ? - also wonder how we would ever know (? :)). Anyway, time 
     to out !!
     
     I'm fae' Scotland & that's where I first got into the scene circa `92. 
     Don't have much of an accent as I've lived in England for `bout half 
     my life (Durham & Portsmouth) - so you'll probably be able to 
     understand me !! Best party I've ever been to would be the Hogmanay 
     (New Year for all you sassenachs !) 93-94 bash held at Prestwick 
     Airport  - Prodigy, Shades of Rhythm and more, while to cap the event 
     our "designated driver" managed to crash the car, not once but, 
     *twice* on the way home !! Rezerection also rooled. Guess you can tell 
     I like massives - the buzz from a couple of thousand people all going 
     off to some serious techno just gets me where I live. Hmmmmm.
     
     Prior to hauling ass down here I spent almost 3 yrs in NYC - took me a 
     while to get into the scene & find a posse but we had a lotta lotta 
     fun. Never really enjoyed the Sound Factory (Junior was a bit too soft 
     for my tastes), but once the Tunnel became an all-nighter it was (and 
     is) just *the* best !! The Roxy on Fridays is also thumping but was 
     shut down for a long time while I was there (boo-hoo).
     
     Have hit a few parties down here starting with Exxon back in October, 
     best so far would have to be those Wicked things. Excellent vibe !! 
     Personal hates include 1015 & Sound Factory (I didn't know any better, 
     honest Guv !!) Oh, bio for wetware would be : 27, `bout 6' tall, with 
     short brown hair (used to be real long (...sob, sob)), generally rave 
     in pretty boring togs - jeans / whitish T with design. Spot me by 
     green pumas or purple Docs and, of course, the silly smile.
     
     This list is fantastic - you guys really have a *nice* thing going 
     here. Respect.
     
     Btw: Check out an article in this weeks Economist mag comparing 
     properties of & attitudes to Prozac & E. Interesting angle.
     
     Btw II - The Sequel: Anybody have any info on amateur foottie (SOCCER 
     that is !!) leagues in/around SF ?? Would be much appreciated, Ta  !
     
     Btw III - Etc: Can I have a laminate now ?
     
     Shouts out to Volt & I hope to meet a lot more of you soon !!

** Mainstream Alert **

Every day between 5 and 6PM KMEL (106.1) has a dj mix show: happy club
house and hip-hop.  I've caught this show a few times because, I have to
admit, sometimes I like that mainstream clubby simple house music (silly
lyrics, relentless house beat, obligatory siren and drum progression).

But you wouldn't believe the stuff morphing into "house" these days!!
Salsa music, ballads, rap songs - with full house beats under them!
Basically, they're recycling known musical quantities, and simply adding a
house beat, creating bizarre hybrids.

And the other day they played that club song..."you gotta lick it before we
kick it..." (you know the one!)...with a chant interpersed, "RAVE ON! RAVE
ON! RAVE ON!"

AAAAHHHHH!!

I personally thought underworld cd was rad and I love jungle etc. but it did 
have some inane vocal stuff that sort of put me off so I could see how 
the love/hate thing works on this one.

However, I love a spirited debate about music as I'm always on the

Well, it's good to see we're opening a healthy dialog... er, wait, no, I 
wouldn't exactly call that healthy... 

Seriously, Starchild, someone who took the time to personally respond to
Heather has at least some sympathy and concern for her questions and this
culture, and does not deserve the language you used on her.  If you really
want to start a conversation, you have to start from understanding where they
come from, what their knowlege of the situation and environment is, and not
make any presuppositions of their intent.  In the above message you ascribe
the many frustrations we have with a deliberate conspiracy to deprive us of
happiness - which presumes an awful awful lot that just isn't substantiated. 

The tone of Susan's message, to me, was "play by the rules - get permits 
- and you will be treated with respect from the government".  This is 
true anywhere - you have to play by the rules to drive a car, you have to 
play by the rules to do just about anything.  Sometimes those rules feel 
pretty arbitrary or even just plain wrong, but sometimes they do make 
sense, like limits on maximum number of occupants in a building.  I know 
you are a staunch libertarian, and favor as few rules as possible, but 
what will you tell me when the floor eventually caves in at the Acme 
warehouse?  

The answer to this is to do what many people in different communities have
done - approach the community authorities as equals, *respecting* their
opinions and belief systems and mores, and working within them.  I do not
feel that there is a fundamental disconnect between raving and the rest of
the population.  I have seen too many cops come across a renegade party, see
that it was safe, and decide to let it continue, to think that there is some
biological switch that makes you one way or the other. 

Show the Salt Lake community why raves have nothing to do with gangs (and 
who knows, maybe in SLC there really is a problem with that - it was 
certainly a problem in LA when I was there), why it is a safe 
environment, etc.  Get a permit to have a daytime party on a Sunday in a 
park in the center of town.  Go through the right steps to have at least 
some of the parties 100% kosher with the local jurisdictions.  This has 
*certainly* worked in many places, such as Richmond here in the Bay 
Area.  

And it sounds like there is someone at the other end of the phone line 
willing to listen.  Hey, if Susan can be convinced that having 100 people 
dancing at a party leads to fewer acts of violence amongst the population 
than having 100 people on the streets or 100 people watching football, 
she might become a big supporter.  

But don't fritter away the opportunity by comparing them to Hitler and 
Stalin.

FDA Warns Against 'Natural' Euphoric Drugs

WASHINGTON (Reuter) - U.S.  health officials warned Wednesday against
using diet supplements containing ephedrine sold as alternatives to
street drugs such as ``Ecstasy'', saying they posed serious health
risks.

The Food and Drug Administration said the products, often targeted at
adolescents and young adults, are marketed under brand names with
implications that they produce euphoria, heightened sexual sensation and
awareness or increased energy.

It said they contain botanical or ``natural'' sources of ephedrine, an
amphetamine-like stimulant that can have dangerous effects on the
nervous system and heart.

The FDA said the possible adverse effects ranged from heart attack,
stroke, seizures, psychosis and death to less serious ones such as
dizziness and irregular heartbeat.

It said the risks were serious and it was investigating the production
and marketing of ephedrine-containing products sold as alternatives to
illegal street drugs.

The FDA said that many of the products bear labels implying they can
produce a ``high'' and it said it considered this type of promotion and
these claims to violate the food and drug law, even as amended in 1994.

It said it was committed to take any action needed to remove such
products from the market.

But the agency added that under the amended law it has to act
product-by-product to show that something is unsafe rather than be able
to require a manufacturer to prove its product is safe before it can be
marketed.

The agency said that ingredients listed on the panels of the products
may include ma huang, Chinese ephedra extract, ephedra herb powder,
epitonin or ephedrine, any of which indicate the present of ephedrine.

The FDA asked that consumers who have had an adverse reaction after
taking a dietary supplement or any product containing an ephedrine
alkaloid to call the agency at 1-800-FDA 4010.

It said health professionals who have treated patients with adverse side
effects should call the FDA's Medwatch hot line at 1-800-FDA-1088.

Good vibes about the Progress folks!

I went to one last August (their sixth party...?) after hearing about them
for a while (they were going off monthly last spring and summer).  For some
reason I cannot remember the exact location or even who spun :(, but it was
in a smallish SOMA warehouse, 3 floors.

Lighting was minimal, but the sound was good, the music was going off, and
the dance floor vibe upstairs was really strong (_that_ much I do
remember!)  Downstairs in the chill room were some amazing instruments that
I have wished to see at parties ever since...a round stone bowl with a
mallet that emitted this amazing deep tonal sound, more like a vibration
that filled the room (!)...and a looong blowhorn-type thing that also
created an ethereal, deep sound.   This _really_ helped create a sacred
temple-like environment...There were microphones set up and people
accompanied ambient with their voices, and then there was even freestyle
rap!

I very much dig the union of rave parties with spirituality... Progress,
which was envisioned to echo each of the Celestine Prophecy's Nine
Insights, is one of the only parties I know of (any others?) that has so
visibly highlighted the connection.  I know many of us have experienced
spiritual awakenings during parties (I sometimes refer to them, only among
those who know, as my "temple"), but often it is left for us to find that
on our own.  A more active approach, like Progress', could bring many to
the same awareness, IMO.

Also, the Progress I went to was only (!) $8.   One thing that really
proved their integrity to me was the fact that, after one in the spring got
busted, they subtracted I think $5 off of their next party for people who
had bought tickets for the busted one :).   If memory serves me correctly,
didn't they also throw a free daytime party to also make up for it?  (Fuzzy
here, anyone know?)

I haven't seen the flier - can someone post the info?  Thanks!  Love.  Nancy

Hey

Was just wondering, does anybody have any facts regarding the number of 
brain cells killed from e versus the number killed by alcohol?  
Assuming equivalent doses of course (do you suppose two hits of e would 
be the equivalent of getting fairly drunk?).  I had heard somewhere 
that out of such items as alcohol, cocaine, pot, & a coupla others, 
that alcohol killed more brain cells than any of these others.  Don't 
know how factual that is, but got me curious nonetheless.

Please do not email me personally about it (reply to sfraves instead) 
cause for the next five days I will not have access to my own email 
account, just my friend who is also on sfraves, so I'll get 
sfraves-addressed mail but not personal mail.  Thanks!

Love,
Shawna

While T think it is silly and futile for the FDA to attempt to
"ban" these  suppliments, it is my personal belief that Ma Huang
is far more dangerous then MDMA itself, especially if you are prone
to hypertension, eurythmia, or other cardiac problems.

This sounds like the Acme, no?  True, I have always immensely enjoyed parties 
I've gone to at the Acme, but my guess would be that a lotta people would 
boycott this particular party simply based on that location.

I've not heard a lot about this particular aspect of these parties, actually, 
except one person said that the party he went to itself didn't really seem to 
have much to do with C.P. at all with the exception of having the pertinent 
Insight printed on their flyer.  But obviously a rave can be plenny spiritual 
without being required to relate to the Celestine Prophecy specifically! :)

I've gotten several responses about these parties, the reviews have been really 
mixed.  Several people said they were pretty mediocre, and several seemed to 
really think the ones they attended were really good.  Of course, several of 
those parties from what I heard were thrown at the Acme, so that's gonna color 
a few opinions anyway.  So far, it still sounds like there's possible hope for 
this one, I had a chance to talk a little to the girl who was handing out 
flyers for Progress at MAD on Monday, she said the price would be about 
$10-$12, and the number of people they were expecting was probably about an 
average of 800 or so, not too small but certainly not massive.  Wasn't 
January's Chrysalis somewhere in that number range?  However, from what she 
said it still sounded like it could be at the Acme, she mentioned there being 
three rooms (all you previous Acme-goers can visualize all the rooms!)  Coupled 
with the numbers they're expecting and the fact that historically they've been 
known to use the Acme, I'd say it's a definite possibility that this one'll be 
held there too.  Wayne also said he knew the girl throwing the party & would be 
attending, so I am assuming he would not support them if they weren't 
worthwhile to some degree.

Anyway, this party still sounds like it has some definite potential, albeit w/ 
a coupla drawbacks.  I'll probably check it out if there's nothing else going 
on that weekend.

Love,
Shawna

Whoa there!  Before going off on e killing brain cells or any others on the
list *** except alcohol does kill 'em - toxic stuff that it is ***
 best to get some good resource info which might include BUT not be limited
 to :

 Andrew Weil's book on drugs from A-Z  Chocolate to ??? ( can't remember it's
    exact title but it's easy to find )

 PDR - any discount book store has em

 Merck index - has lots of drugs & chemicals including LD50 toxic info

 Check the Hyperreal archieves for some info....

 Any user should have good info sources such as these to turn not - NOT
 data passed around from raver to raver... I much prefer Weil's book 
 to those of people like Eisner **who has far too much of an agenda to
 get out **  and Weil ( who I've personally met and is a wonderful man )
 is an MD with a passion for mushrooms of all varieties so I easily
 recommend his book...

Hi ya'll. I was just wondering if anybody has seen the single for missing 
by Everything But The Girl on CD or tape.  I've seen the record at solid 
grooves, but I don't own a record player.  I would be so very happy if 
somebody knew where I could get a copy of this, or tell if it even exits 
on a CD single.  And if it doesn't exist, I would love to copy it if 
somebody else has the record and a record player.  Thanks.

Much love,
Matt

Well ... if you're going to choose a substance to ingest which will kill 
brain cells at ALL, why not choose to be happy and bouncy and full of joy 
and laughter instead of slurring and vomiting and getting pissed off 
easily and hating your fellow hunans and waking up feeling like someone's 
stuffed a red hot bag of nails into your head?  The choice is clear to me ...

Hey there Mike. Sorry your stuff was either stolen or lost at the 
Gathering. It happened to me a long time ago, June 1993, Lower Haight, 
Your Sister's House..(open party, street people).  

SUGGESTION:  PAINT YOUR BELONGINGS

The following will not prevent theft, but perhaps it can deter it a bit.
And also this suggestion can add to a party's ambience.   Use black light 
paint to turn your backpack into a work of art.  So when you  set it down, 
or place it on a speaker, you will be ble to see it or keep an eye on it.
Also makes it a more obvious target...and one less likely to be chosen.
Same goes for jackets, purses, bean bags (mine has florescent green hands 
airbrushed all over it) etc.  

Oh, one other thing to do is hook up with a smilin' posse and ask 
them to keep an eye on your bag and you'll help out as well throughout 
the night or day...  --Maureen

Epherine (Ma Huang) were first used (abused) in diet products, massive 
doses sold in new age weight loss products....  my symptons ranged from 
intense nervousness to being completely spaced out, and often times 
mynegative emotions intensified as well.  Many remedies are meant to be 
taken in small doses.  This is a big IMHO, but I believe that lots of 
folks are taking advantage of the buzz some of our mother's plants 
produce without testing them properly and the result could very well be the 
illegalization of more natural herbs and plants.  Best to avoid Guinea 
Pig products....  --Maureen

Some of the earlier Porgress parties may have been at ACME, but ACME's no
longer a party space.

Well, the Celestine Prophecy theme at the Progress party that I went to
last summer was all it took for me to buy and read the Celestine Prophecy.
This was one of the things that kick-started my quest for spirituality.
With that in mind, I'd say that was enough of a Celestine Prophecy theme
for me, especially at a time where I was in no mood to be 'preched to'
about spirituality, but rather could be turned onto spiritual themes
one-clue-at-a-time, which is kinda how all this worked out in my case. If
it had been too much, I would have quickly rejected it all instead of
giving spirituality in general and the Celestine Prophecy specifically a
chance.


I also remember the voicemail message was REALLY REALLY long and it went on
and on about spirituality issues, the Celestine Prophecy and how her
parties fit in.

Although I haven't been to all of them, I definitely support Progress
parties and what they're about. I'll be dragging our party crew out there
for the next one on April 20th, so look for us!

It's not at ACME. Guaranteed!

Hello trainspotters...

I am on a search for a relatively obscure track on the Briish House of
Naughty label by a duo called Shrill and I think the track is called
Tweaker. I've heard Carlos and Dimitry(Dee-Lite) spin it in their sets, and
Carl Cox when he came here last Oct. It came out about Nov-Dec in
England...does anyone know where it can be found?? I tried e-mailing Tag
records in London and even went in there in person when I was on vacation
but they were all out. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks :)

Reagan Reid rightly pointed out that Andrew Weil & Winifred Rosen's 1993
version of "From Chocolate to Morphine" only has a page on MDMA, but it has
some good common sense advice about psychedelics in general (set & setting;
problems because of risk of fake drugs; "Psychedelics do not necessarily
produce any particular mood or state of mind.  They act as intensifiers of
experience.").  It mentions raves in part of what it said about
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (yes, folks, ecstasy is an amphetamine
variation):

        Taken by mouth in reasonable doses (125 milligrams) and in good
settings, MDMA rarely causes bad trips.  It has gained a strong reputation
as an enhancer of empathy between people and an aid to psychotherapy and
counseling.  In other circles it has gained an equally strong reputation as
a party drug, being used especially in dance clubs that feature "acid
house" and wild dancing.  The acid house phenomenon has been growing in
Europe (particularly in the Netherlands and the U.K.) and in some American
cities.  A newer version, called "rave," features synthesized music and
light shows.  MDMA has also been very popular in the gay community and in
gay bars.
        For a number of years after its introduction MDMA was an
uncontrolled substance.  It became illegal when government scientists
suggested that it caused permanent damage to certain nerve cells in the
brain.  Research has failed to support this idea, but the drug remains
illegal, and strange stories circulate about it.  One is that it causes the
spinal cord to liquefy.
        There is no truth to those stories, but both MDA and MDMA can cause
bad reactions at high doses.  Some people snort them or (rarely) inject
them intravenously, intensifying their action and potential for harm.
Combining these drugs with alcohol or other depressants also increases the
possibility of adverse effects.  As sexual drugs, both compounds may
enhance the pleasure of touching, but they interfere with erection in men
and with orgasm in both men and women.  A few cases of dependence on MDMA
have been reported; they resemble cases of amphetamine dependence.
        MDMA remains one of the most popular illegal drugs in Europe and
America, and some physicians and psychotherapists are still trying to
convince the government that it should be made available for both research
and treatment.  The most common complaint about it from longtime users is
that sensitivity to day after fatigue seems to increase as people get
older.  Some enthusiasts have sworn off the drug entirely because they feel
so run down after using it and find themselves more susceptible to colds,
herpes outbreaks, and other infections.

Yeh, where they describe me as "a somewhat bashful middle-aged man".

Ouch. That hurts.

I'm not bashful!

If alcohol makes you feel like that, then you're consuming too much of it.

Not to be anti MDMA or anything, it just surprises me how people tend to
become anti everything else when they find something new that they like.

Acid can make you slur and act more stupid than the typical drinker.

MDMA has caused some of the worse hangovers ever, much worse than red hot
nails in the head. And other times, you feel great the next day.

I think it's great that there is a variety of drugs (and I include alcohol,
caffeine and nicotine) that affect us. It's not as boring that way.

__________________________

my point was that if you consume enough alcohol to "equal" an e high, 
that's what you're going to get ... lets face it $40 worth of booze would 
set a lot of people flat on their asses pretty quick :)

and in the over 20 times i've taken e, i have never ONCE had an e 
hangover.  The only person I know in my circle of friends who tke e 
regularly who had a hangover also spent eight hours dancing without once 
stopping and barely drank any water during that time .... and i have a 
feeling she'd have felt just as awful the next day if she'd have been sober!

But i'm not against alcohol completely, i'm against the ABUSE of alcohol, 
which sadly is a common problem ... same as any other substance.  I just
prefer to take e and save my liver the trouble at least :)

Just to let you know, that was me and the rest of Consciousness Lab playing

        Yes, i have been known to drink a lot of scotch and have found my
non-slurring self completely cognizant, sending out peace and luv and hugs
and kind words, the only difference is that i smell stinky and my saliva
could probably strip the wax off of your lineoleum floors. :)
        To each their own i guess!

I'm writing an article for Colorado's local scene zine about net-rave 
communities.

Since SF-Raves is the quintessential net-rave community, I'd like to get 
some feedback, if possible, and just how much sf-raves or another net-
rave community means to you.  

We have all met tons of people, some of us have even met life-partners 
over the various net-rave communities, we've all experienced a lot with 
net-ravers...but beyond that, more into the community itself, how has sf-
raves or another net-rave community impacted your life?  More than 
anything i'm looking for a few quotable phrases and sentences at this 
point.

I'd really appreciate your feelings on what these communities mean to 
you.

thanx, and have "a groovy, groovy day and a lovely evening"

plur

Hey there- (2 posts from me in 1 day- egad!)

If you don't think your stuff will get stolen from you at a rave, that is 
pretty naive. I went on an outdoor rave/camping trip in Pennsylvania 
where someone stole my wet, smelly clothing (4 shirts and a jacket). I've 
also had my wallet stolen. You always need to keep your wallet in a 
secure location on your person, thus the need for those chain/wallets 
that you see. My friend had a leather jacket stolen at a Wicked. My new 
tactic for jackets is to buy $5 vinyl jackets at thrift stores. Nobody 
wants these things, if anyone did take it I wouldn't care. If I put my 
backpack down, I take my keys and my wallet out first. Also it might be a 
good idea just to take your driver's license and whatever cash you need, 
and leave the rest of your wallet at home. 

I used to think I could trust *everyone* at raves, but my experiences 
have proved otherwise. It's a good idea to be careful. 

Love-
Amy

Hi-
Just like everything else, moderation is the key.

If you have ever seen a person who has consumed too much E, they don't 
act much more intelligently than a drunken person. In fact, they may be 
vomiting as well as lying around on a floor all night, talking nonsense. 
At least they don't act as obnoxious as drunk people... (unless you 
consider someone blathering about how much they love you to be annoying). 
Then there is also that depression which can sometimes accompany E, and 
makes it less than a bowl of friggin' cherries. 

I think one or two beers is great for chillin' out at Sunset or 
something... but I have cut down greatly on my alcohol consumption 
because it makes me so dehydrated. 

How about endorphins, the natural high? I have a theory that since E 
causes changes in your brain's neurotransmitters, it is quite possible 
for you to do this yourself in some mind/body connection. Witness the 
phenomena of the 'contact high' you get from being in a room full of 
people on E. It is within your power to realize this kind of love and 
happiness... just make it happen! I know endorphins are really powerful 
things, I have been hiking in the woods and literally stopped to hug a 
tree (sorry for this bit of sappy stuff). 

Love ya-
-Amy

I heard on their line that the party will be 50 mintues
south of San Francisco.

Does anyone have the 411 on this party?

I've been to only one Kundalini before (at Club Arte)
and the vibe was good but the venue was just too damn small.

Also, has anyone heard of Inner Sircle(State of Divinity)?
I've never heard of them before and was wondering if they 
ever threw any other parties.

Anything else happening on Saturday?

                                         Thanks and Hugs,

my residual deadheadedness compelled me to buy tix for Bruce Hornsby's show
at the Fillmore Friday night (and i really want to see Dionysus Dream's
ambient space, after his description; i'm sure he'll surface again!)  I'll
be leaving immediately after -- or a little earlier -- to go to the "south
bay" for Harmony (either taking my pre-rave friend, or dropping him off in
Berkeley or at a BART station depending on where the party is and the
time).  If anyone else is going and/or needs a ride, e-mail me.

Just read an article in the paper about how it looks like they are going 
to ban outdoor drumming in Santa Cruz between the hours of 10 pm and 8 
am.  Looks like a sad day for all those drummers.

Greetings Friends!

As many of you may know, MAD was shut down early last week. For numerous
reasons, some of them old, some of them new, this represents the end of the
line for MAD at the Bahia.

While we have certainly enjoyed ourselves there, the management has been
extremely difficult to work with at times, in addition to which, there is a
60 room hotel directly across the street, most of whose inahabitants are
poeple coping with terminal diseases, who are well sick of us cracking
their plaster every monday, resulting in numerous call to the authorities,
permit hassles, etc.

None of which we begrudge them - we sincerely hope that our absence brings
them peace (and quiet!) and accelerates their healing. As noted above
however, it's definitely time to move on.

The good news is, we have a wonderful place to move to: "V" which is a new
club at the corner of 11th and Folsom (formerly the Oasis).

The space has been radically renovated and is, quite honestly, gorgeous
inside. The pool has been replaced by a beautiful blue wood dancefloor -
the real kind. There is an amazing lighting system, and an *awesome*, and
I do mean awesome, EAW Surround Sound System. Truly sick =)

There is also a second room which we will be doing ambient stuff in, as
well as an outdoor rooftop with lots of comfortable seating, plants, trees,
etc. which will be great as summer rolls around.

Another real plus are the people that run place who, beyond being friendly
and very easy going, are also *conscious*; socially and politically active
and aware poeple.

The bad news is MAD will now have to be 21+.

I think those of you that know myself, joe, alex, and jon, as well as the
numerous other people who have helped MAD be what is, know that, as
individuals and as a group, we go well out of our way to avoid drawing
arbitrary and unsavory lines like this; it *is not* what we would have done
if we had a choice. Unfortunately it came down to stopping MAD altogether
or doing what we have decided to do. We offer our most heartfelt and
sincere apologies to those of you that this change in venue will exclude.

Please know that as individuals, and as a group we remain committed to
throwing underground, all ages *Everyone Is Welcome* parties including
MADNESS one offs, Friends & Family, and Justice League events to name just
a few.

We'll be taking next week (April 15th) off and return on April 22, at our
new location, with Alex, Ethan, and the Red Man himself Dave Clarke.

Pricing remains the same: $2 before 11, $3 after (though for Dave Clarke,
as with other "big name" guests) it will be $3 all night. Up-to-date info
is always available at:

  http://www.bass-station.com/fnf/events.html#MAD

  As well on our voicemail line: 415 281-9432


                                    ***


It is our sincerest desire and our firmest intention that MAD continue to
be a thriving, weekly home for the amazing and diverse collection of energy
and talent that comprises this wonderful community of ours. None of us are
doing this for fame, glory, ego, or The Money (that's a good one!) We all
have full-time day jobs that we go to exhausted every tuesday. We need your
energy, we need your enthusiasm, and we need your support to keep making
this work.

So we invite you to join us in taking MAD into its next iteration; so
please, come down on mondays and join us in dancing together, in laughing
together, in celebrating, together.

Your input is *always welcome*. You can reach us online at:

ethan@bass-station.com      (ethan)
ambient@netcom.com          (joe)
jon@netnoir.com             (jon)

Alex doesn't have email (yet!) but feel free to bug him at the club =)


warmest regards

ethan, alex, joe and jon

The way I look at losing things at a rave or club, is that you have to 
carry with you your possesions, thus when you see me at a place, I will 
have my backpack on.......  
  
it's been proven all too often, that if you leave a jacket, or a backpack, 
or whatever, chances are eventually something will happen, it may take 
months, even years if your lucky.....but sooner or later the odds will get 
ya.....  
  
.......now I do from time to time have major trust in my fellow humanity, 
and leave something somewhere, (as I'm a DJ, I usually will stash it by the

Dj booth somewhere)  
and overall my luck or intuition has been good.......  
  
.........intuition plays a major roll in my even staying at an event, let 
alone tempting fate by leaving my shit unprotected somewhere.......I 
recently left a small underground party because I was vibed out by some of 
the people.........I didn't feel comfortable somehow, and I left shortly 
after arriving, only to hear days later that a nasty fight broke out and 
the police showed up and busted the party...........  
  
so you have to look at what you yourself can do to protect yourself and 
your property.  
Fortunately, it's been a long time since I've had more than a few tapes 
stolen out of my backpack when leaving it somewhere.  
  
unfortunately, when you wear a backpack in the busy club, you are taking up

valuable space, and you bump everybody over trying to get through the 
crowd.......  
  
heres a typical list of what a prepared raver needs:  (typical moonpup 
backpack)  
  
1.)    wallet/money..........  
2.)    keys   
3.)    pipe/lighter/backup lighter/kgb/small container/     /etc....(fill 
in the blanks)  
4.)    lazer pointer  
5.)    flashlite  
6.)    cassettes.......(DJ's only)  gotta have your latest tape to give out

to   
                                                            people with the

vibe                                      
7.)    jacket  
8.)    ski cap/gloves..........(outdoor events)  
9.)    pen  
10.)  dat machine (optional....if DJ-ing) + connectors/blank dats etc....  
11.)  room for flyers  
12.)  camera......(special events)  
13.)  water  
14.)  fruit/food....... (optional)  
15.)  toys.........things to amuse  
  
well you could add blankets, beanbags, etc........depends how serious a 
raver you want to be..........  
                                    .................moonpup        
......ramblings of a lunatik

The way I look at losing things at a rave or club, is that you have to 
carry with you your possesions, thus when you see me at a place, I will 
have my backpack on.......  
  
it's been proven all too often, that if you leave a jacket, or a backpack, 
or whatever, chances are eventually something will happen, it may take 
months, even years if your lucky.....but sooner or later the odds will get 
ya.....  
  
.......now I do from time to time have major trust in my fellow humanity, 
and leave something somewhere, (as I'm a DJ, I usually will stash it by the

Dj booth somewhere)  
and overall my luck or intuition has been good.......  
  
.........intuition plays a major roll in my even staying at an event, let 
alone tempting fate by leaving my shit unprotected somewhere.......I 
recently left a small underground party because I was vibed out by some of 
the people.........I didn't feel comfortable somehow, and I left shortly 
after arriving, only to hear days later that a nasty fight broke out and 
the police showed up and busted the party...........  
  
so you have to look at what you yourself can do to protect yourself and 
your property.  
Fortunately, it's been a long time since I've had more than a few tapes 
stolen out of my backpack when leaving it somewhere.  
  
unfortunately, when you wear a backpack in the busy club, you are taking up

valuable space, and you bump everybody over trying to get through the 
crowd.......  
  
heres a typical list of what a prepared raver needs:  (typical moonpup 
backpack)  
  
1.)    wallet/money..........  
2.)    keys   
3.)    pipe/lighter/backup lighter/kgb/small container/     /etc....(fill 
in the blanks)  
4.)    lazer pointer  
5.)    flashlite  
6.)    cassettes.......(DJ's only)  gotta have your latest tape to give out

to   
                                                            people with the

vibe                                      
7.)    jacket  
8.)    ski cap/gloves..........(outdoor events)  
9.)    pen  
10.)  dat machine (optional....if DJ-ing) + connectors/blank dats etc....  
11.)  room for flyers  
12.)  camera......(special events)  
13.)  water  
14.)  fruit/food....... (optional)  
15.)  toys.........things to amuse  
  
well you could add blankets, beanbags, etc........depends how serious a 
raver you want to be..........  
                                    .................moonpup

Why imagine my suprise, when I saw that Moonpup left out one of the first
things that should go into a raver's backpack:  SUNGLASSES!  ;^)

Why, as an experienced raver, how many times have you walked out into the
dazzling sunlight at 7am and thrown on a dope pair of shades only to have
friends bemoan their lack of forethought?

It's first on my list.  Well, that is, right after beer.  :^)

Peace all!

The key is moderation and knowledge of what a substance does to you!
Not everyone who has a beer or 2 gets all pukey and pissed off. It's true,
alcohol kills quite a few (like about 100,000) neurons per drink or so (no
one knows exactly how many) but we lose about 100,000-200,000 neurons per
day already, just cause thats how nature works and neurons dont reproduce.
So, yes, alcohol would enhance the mass death, but that is all up to the
person who chooses to drink.  Theres nuthin like having a nice cold brewski
in my backyard during the middle of summer.

But, let me tell ya, I have felt like someone not only stuffed a red hot bag
of nails, but nailed each one of them into my skull with a meat cleaver
after some hits of E. And I know lots of people who are happy and bouncy and
full of joy after a couple of beers. It all depends on what you choose as
yer poison... 

Lemme just say, I am only a light drinker (a nice J. Lohr estates 1993
cabernet is my fave) and a light E kinda guy (like once every 6 months or
so). But when I take either, I enjoy it.

Just had to add one more thing re: alcohol: 
I think it depends a lot on the quality of the alcohol. We all remember
puking back in High school because all we could afford was crap like
Budweiser or Blatz or Lucky or if we wanted to splurge we would get Miller
Genuine Draft! (yuk)And for some people, I believe that that's why they hate
alchohol so much. There is a difference between Budweiser and Pete's wicked
Red, and there is a difference between St Supery 1993 Merlot and Grape
flavored Cisco.
 Other people are true alcoholics, and they should stay away from it, no
exceptions. (my friend's father has Korsakoffs syndrome from too much
alcohol- which is a result of malnutrition from drinking too much and the
liver not being able to work properly, therefore the brain does not get it's
fuel and starts dying in the form of lost memories which are replaced by
memories that are made up by the individual's brain and cause a big mess).
        Other people are well educated about what they are doing, and have
no problem with it.
Just my opinion

Hi everyone!

I've been lurking on SFRaves for a couple of weeks now and
thought I'd keep that delurking trend going!

I'm pretty new to the whole rave thing, my first rave was the Gathering
back in December, so it's really cool to hear what you all think
and feel about the scene.  Although some of my friends went to raves
back when I was going to school in SoCal, I was too caught up in the
hell that was my life back then to go along... ah, if only I had
known ;)

I remember one time when I was sitting in the lounge of our dorm when
everyone was coming back from some rave in LA.  One guy, who usually
had a big chip on his shoulder, snuck up behind me and gave me
a big bear hug.  I am ashamed to say that I was so surprised that this
huge guy who usually seemed to have something against me, was hugging me
that I didn't hug back.  I guess that he figured that he had crossed some
line and said "What are you looking at?" and then left.  I stood there
for a sec, having no idea what had just happened.  Of course, now it
all makes sense.  :)  But a missed opportunity :(  I guess that's a
strange thing to all of a sudden pop into your head three years after
the fact, but I guess that's why they say that writing is an act of
exploration, right?

Anyways, finally this december I decided to check out a rave.  I admit that
I was pretty skeptical.  I mean, hey, it's just a party; music, dancing,
lights, yadda yadda, right?  But by about 30 minutes later, I realized that
raves aren't about black lights, or laser shows, or drugs, or even
necessarily (Blashphemy ahead !) about the music, it's about the PEOPLE.
The VIBE.

And, regarding the big-party vs. small-party vibe question, I've since
tried a smaller party and found it more to my liking, but an important
thing to remember is that hey, maybe the vibe at big parties isn't as
consistent as at the smaller ones, but compared to the rest of the world
it's still AMAZING!  I remember just walking around astounded at the
contact high I was getting off of people!

Anyways, i've blathered on long enough, but I plan to be at Harmony
tomorrow, if anyone would take the time to introduce this newbie
around I'd greatly appreciate it!  I don't know what I'll be wearing
but if you see a chinese guy, about 5'6-5'7, crewcut and maybe wearing
a banana-in-pajamas, please say hi!

                        Peace,

                                Chin

P.S. Oh yeah, I live in Sunnyvale but spend most of my free time in
Santa Cruz, if anyone wants to get together or car pool to a rave or
something, drop me some e-mail!

Why do ravers need to bring a backpack when they got those huge baggy jeans
with pockets all over the place? ha. Except moonpup cause he's naked.

Forgive me if this topic has already been hashed out on sfraves, but I feel
the
need to address this almost uniquely San Franciscan phenomenon.

How do people feel about those folks who cheerfully lug their drum collections
along to just about every mid-to-large sized party, plunking themselves down
either in the middle of the dancefloor or near the dj in order to bang out
their own accompanying tribal rhythms for the duration of the evening?

As you may have guessed, I've already made up my mind on this issue and
generally find their presence annoying for the following reasons:

1.  I don't like to hear every track, from acid to new york house to trance,
turned into a "tribal remix".

2.  Something that I doubt any of these drummers realize is that no matter how
skilled and precise their drumming may be, if you go about 15 - 20 feet away
from them, the drumming sounds *completely* off rhythm from whatever the dj is
playing, due to such factors as the echos created by high ceilings and
concrete, the fact that there are 2 - 4 groups of speakers versus one drum
(which is often off to side, outside the "cone of sound" described by the
speakers).

3.  I understand that not every dj may feel this way, but I tend to think of a
dj's set as *his* or *her* own personal performance.  Some djs are true
masters
of control, able to hypnotize a crowd and then work it into a frenzy.  When
there are other performers besides the dj, he loses that control, and unless
they are working in synergy, the result is weak.  For the same reasons, I even
think that it's a little rude for someone  to assume that everyone is as
excited about  bongo drums as they are.  I mean, drums are loud; you can
usually hear them throughout an entire party.  Would people feel the same if
someone brought their bass guitar and amp, plugged in, and started jamming
along, or if an aspiring vocalist brought along a microphone and amp and starte
d their own vocal accompaniment?

I know there are probably some djs who would welcome it.  Derrick May, when he
played at that party (I forget the name), brought along his own drummer.  So
if
these freelance drummers are so eager to perform, why not approach djs or
promoters and be a real part of everything, get hooked into a mic that goes
through the dj's mixer so that everyone can hear their precision and skill,
and
then after a two hour set, put down the drum and go dance or something.

I'm curious to hear other people's points of view on this, especially djs.

By the way, I honestly don't have any real hostility towards drummers or
anything, just spouting off.

If someone wants to accompany a dj, my opinion is that the performer should
work it out with the dj and promoter in advance.  I play bass guitar, and
was asked to accompany a dj to an upcoming party.  Sounded like fun to me.
Since I knew one of the people who put on this event, I asked him what he
thought, and he rejected the idea.  So, I cast aside all the musical
inspirations I had and decided that I would be an attendee at this party,
not a participant.  I have no idea why I was denied, but I'm not gonna
argue.  If other people anticipate performing at a party, and are asked not
to, I hope they won't be offended, but will take the opportunity to enjoy
the party.
Maybe some future events could be set up that feature live instrument
performance as a set, part of a set, or a whole party.  Does this happen?
Should it?

Peace and Harmony,

Hi,

According to the SFRaves calander,  Sven Vath is spinning at Spundae
this Friday.   Is he from the UK or Europe?    According to some
excellent reviews in UK Dance mailing list,  Sven Vath is exceptional
and I really want to hear him spin,   but I also want to go to
Harmony this Friday.    Does anyone know what the lineup is going to
be for Spundae (IE: when he's going to spin?)   Or does anyone know
how I can get in touch with the promoters so I can find out when
Sven Vath is going on?    Perhaps I can go to both,  although they
are 50 miles apart....   Arghhhh!!

Perhaps Sven Vath might be spinning at some other gig while he's out
here,   I don't know,  but I did look at the calander and didn't see
him on any other lineups.

Harmony and out-a-sight on Friday usually do good parties, and Sven Vath
swings by 1015 Folsom that night too.  Saturday has some larger events;
Kundalini has gotten mixed reviews, and I don't know much about Iner Sircle
except that they have a funny way of spelling things.  Tonight's 
Negativland show might be a good place to start the weekend...

New in the weeklies: the Beat at Big Heart City and the Light'n'up Lounge
at 111 Minna.

i thought you presented this very well...altho, i've never seen this
happen at a big party but a friend of mine had a small gathering in which
he invited a bunch of drummer people to have a drumming session before we
started spinning and they just kept drumming!  i think drumming is really
cool and even like to do it myself but it made dancing confusing for my
body with the echo factor.  my poor bud was spinning with this kind of
erked look on his face and he's such a sweetie he just grinned and bore
it!

so, i think it's something to think about...

peace out,

bren

Sven is going to be in LA the next day.  (see below)  Friday is his only 
day this year he'll be in SF & Saturday is the only day this year he'll be 
in LA.  

I've heard him spin a couple of times now & he goes off!!!!  (he's from 
Germany.)  He is definitely worth hearing.  I wish I had tomorrow off...I'd 
drive up to SF to hear him tomorrow night, then drive back to LA Saturday 
to hear him there!!  (hee,hee)

hmm...

well it was fun while it lasted, too bad I'm not 21. Maybe I'll get a fake
ID or something :)

anyway, It was a great club and I'm really sad that it's been shut down.

Hello to all of you I saw there over the last few months:
Brian, Wayne, Ethan, Shawna, Matt, Sarvi (what's your e-mail, sarvi? you
never post), Jan, Nancy, Troy, Jon, Doug and anyone I might have forgotten.

moonpup's list was great!  and the sunglasses are important too..

here's my list...

money
 i.d.
pipe and fixin's
 sunglasses
 candy (lollipops, lifesavers, gum) to share with everyone (come and ask!)
flashlight
cigarettes (again, plenty to share, and yes I know it's a nasty habit)
toys (I've got cool kalaidescopes for this weekend to the first 3 wonderful
people!)
bandaids and ibuprofen
...and most important (esp if you're going anywhere near the Wicked sound
system!)  .... earplugs!  be nice to your ears!

And I stow them all in a clear plastic backpack with outside pockets, the
doormen/security people love it, but it's falling apart!   waaah!

Bye!   Leslie  : )

   Just so you know, some clubs and a couple of particular dj's have rules 
   about what types of drums are allowed to come into a club.  And 
   sometimes the motivation to bring a drum is that you can get into a gig 
   for free 'cause you're helping out with the vibe (it helps if you're a 
   scenester and a good drummer)...but then again, it all depends on how 
   you look at it.
   
   I know sometimes drumming can be a drag if the drummer is off but 
   sometimes it's fun to find the syncopating rhythms dragging or rushing 
   the beat--playing with movement/dance off of that and the music.
   
   Bottom line is if you don't like drumming, 1)  don't dance near them; 
   and 2)  try to find gigs that don't allow drummers...but then again, can 
   we ask this of a fellow raver since we don't restrict ravers with 
   annoying whistles, shakers, vocals, etc.?
   
   There's a few clubs that don't have drumming and on the flip side, 
   sometimes there's raves or parties w/opening percussion circles.  To me 
   it's all out there, and it's all good...probably 'cause my basic rhythm 
   pulsates through my veins and that's what initiates my movements.

Forgive me if this topic has already been hashed out on sfraves, but I feel 
the
need to address this almost uniquely San Franciscan phenomenon.
   
How do people feel about those folks who cheerfully lug their drum collections 
along to just about every mid-to-large sized party, plunking themselves down 
either in the middle of the dancefloor or near the dj in order to bang out 
their own accompanying tribal rhythms for the duration of the evening?
   
As you may have guessed, I've already made up my mind on this issue and 
generally find their presence annoying for the following reasons:
   
1.  I don't like to hear every track, from acid to new york house to trance, 
turned into a "tribal remix".
   
2.  Something that I doubt any of these drummers realize is that no matter how 
skilled and precise their drumming may be, if you go about 15 - 20 feet away 
from them, the drumming sounds *completely* off rhythm from whatever the dj is 
playing, due to such factors as the echos created by high ceilings and 
concrete, the fact that there are 2 - 4 groups of speakers versus one drum 
(which is often off to side, outside the "cone of sound" described by the 
speakers).
   
3.  I understand that not every dj may feel this way, but I tend to think of a 
dj's set as *his* or *her* own personal performance.  Some djs are true 
masters
of control, able to hypnotize a crowd and then work it into a frenzy.  When 
there are other performers besides the dj, he loses that control, and unless 
they are working in synergy, the result is weak.  For the same reasons, I even 
think that it's a little rude for someone  to assume that everyone is as 
excited about  bongo drums as they are.  I mean, drums are loud; you can 
usually hear them throughout an entire party.  Would people feel the same if 
someone brought their bass guitar and amp, plugged in, and started jamming 
along, or if an aspiring vocalist brought along a microphone and amp and starte 
d their own vocal accompaniment?
   
I know there are probably some djs who would welcome it.  Derrick May, when he 
played at that party (I forget the name), brought along his own drummer.  So 
if
these freelance drummers are so eager to perform, why not approach djs or 
promoters and be a real part of everything, get hooked into a mic that goes 
through the dj's mixer so that everyone can hear their precision and skill, 
and
then after a two hour set, put down the drum and go dance or something.
   
I'm curious to hear other people's points of view on this, especially djs.
   
By the way, I honestly don't have any real hostility towards drummers or 
anything, just spouting off.

 Generally the drumming and whistle-blowing by some on the dance floor is
 kind of annoying, but I haven't complained about it.  Rather I relocate to
 some different area if possible.

 Hope to see some of you at Harmony (if the lost-space rumor isn't true)!

With a new dance dance ensemble I am helping found in the city, we are
considering
playing with the idea of making light another dancer and cheoreographing
the dancers to react to the light.  With the right kind of lighting board
and lights perhaps sequences couls be programmed which flashed light
around and hence create a sense of space that is not so focused on the dj.

Hi!
 I tend to not like drums in a small space unless it is worked out in 
advance and respect is paid to the DJ. Generally I really love drums at 
outdoor parties and if it is worked out drum circles can be a lotta fun! 
Once again the key is cooperation and communcation with a healthy dose of 
respect; not just taking advantage of a captive audience to drum to. 
However the spontaneous is sometimes special at times.
 Is it just me or is there an anti-drum vibe in the air? What with 
this thread and the Santa Cruz city council shooting down public drumming...

As far as I know, the original trainspotter is someone who's hobby is watching
out for every train and marking it in a little book or schedule. They also
know every little detail about the different trains and lines. The term
comes from England and they are usually males and perceived as slightly
geeky and antisocial.  It is also used as a term for people who are so into
music and records that they know every detail of every record, label,
artist, etc.that exists. I think XLR8R mag had a good description a couple
of issues ago. It's also the title of a great book and new movie.  I was
hoping someone who knew a lot about records could help me look for the one I
can't find anywhere.

Hope that helps  :)

even if you can trust 99.5% of the people you meet at a rave, what about the

good luck all.

The remixed version of "Missing" is the last song on the cd version of the
album "Amplified Heart".  It's not on the track listing, but it's there..
I assume that's what you're talking about since I haven't heard the
original version get any airplay.  I'm pretty sure it exists as a cd single
too.  You might check out http://www.cdnow.com or telnet cdconnection.com
if you wqant to find out if it's been released on cd as a single; they have
a pretty up-to-date selection..

Subject: Suggestions/Precautions for use of hallucinogens
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

By request & FYI, the following is a list of "Suggestions and Precautions
for the Use of Hallucinogenic Drugs" in "From Chocolate to Morphine."  The
chapter on psychedelics discusses both "indole" hallucinogens (containing
the "indole ring" on a molecular level; related to pineal gland-made
hormones) such as LSD & shrooms, and amphetamine/andrenaline-like
hallucinogens including peyote, MDA & MDMA:

1. Know your sources.  Many fake and adulterated versions of psychedelics
are sold on the street.

2.  Do not attempt to pick wild psilocybin mushrooms without knowing what
you are doing.

3.  Cultivated psilocybin mushrooms vary greatly in potency.  Get advice
about dose before eating any.

4.  Do not take psychedelics unless you are in good physical and
psychological shape.

5.  If you are trying one of the hallucinogenic drugs for the first time,
take it with an experienced companion.

6.  Take psychedelics only in comfortable settings on occasions when you
have no responsibilities for at least the next twelve hours.

7.  Remember that you may feel tired and drained of energy the following day.

8.  Do not psychedelics on a full stomach; you are less likely to feel
nausea or other discomfort if your stomach is relatively empty.

9.  Do not combine psychedelics with other drugs.  However, the interesting
effects of psychedelics sometimes wear off while their stimulation
continues.  If you feel agitated, restless, and unable to sleep at the end
of an experience with one of these drugs, it may be appropriate to take a
hypnotic dose of a sleeping pill or minor tranquilizer.

10.  Remember that hallucinogenic drugs can affect perception and thinking.
Do not drive, operate machinery, or engage in hazardous activities while
under their influence.

11.  Take psychedelics by mouth.  They are more likely to cause bad
reactions by other routes of administration.

12.  The best experiences with these drugs result from saving them for
special occasions and the right circumstances.  Taking psychedelics just
because they are available is less likely to produce valuable results.
Taking them to get out of bad moods may intensify those moods.  Taking them
frequently and carelessly reduces their potential to show you interesting
aspects of yourself and the world around you.
END LIST!


and drink your water and take your vitamins . . . : )  and think for yourself!

the book also includes this quote from Peter Furst's "Flesh of the Gods":

>You get out of the drug experience only what you put into it.  The

Hello-Hello everyone...

I would just like to say I will be leaving my home to go to a better house
- house music that is.  I will be in attendance at Harmony and if my energy
levels are up to it, a free party on Sat at the Presidio.  I am bring my
sister to Harmony - she hasn't been to a party since the Kunalini last year
at the roller rink.  I hope to met some/any/at least one new fello
sf-ravers this weekend.  I will wear my laminate which has a butterfly and
basic's ticket on it as well.  Other distinctive trates - Black baggy jeans
and a hat (the ones that older golfers used to wear but now have grown
popluar by today's youth kinda hats).

=46or any reason I don't get to Harmony (I gotta work a double shift fri. an=
d
a morning shift Sat.///or those pesky rumors) I will be going to Kundalini
with my best friends....

Have a great weekend this week...

Subject: (Long/NRR) Beasties/Bondage
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Thought a tale of my adventures in the City last night might be somewhat
relevant; each caused me to reflect on some aspects of our scene...

Beastie Boys at Bottom-of-the-Hill!  Now _this_ was a _super_underground
party!  I was told about it and given five minutes to jump in the car.  I
looked at my books spread in front of me, and jumped!  We get to the club
close to 10PM and encounter a bad scene.  The club is packed inside
(apparently), there are a hundred desperate people crowding outside, and
the cops in their infinite wisdom have decided this is a dangerous
potential riot.

We manage to elude the piggys (for the moment), wiggle our way to the front
of the line (with the help of my super-flirtatious friend), and meet the
doorman.  The doorman, for his part, thought the crowd situation was a
great opportunity to be the biggest asshole imaginable.  He favored the
crowd with sentiments like, "get the fuck away from _my_ door!  Why are you
touching _my_ door?" and "You all are pretty fucking stupid to think you're
getting in here!" and "Give me a blowjob, maybe then you'll get in!"  Ahem.
I couldn't help but reflect on the vibe being created around this club by
the attitude of their workers.  The ones who got inside were lucky, the
rest of us were fucked, get out of our face and go home.   No compassion or
friendliness, but then, what did I expect, a rave? ;)  My friend (who
raves) offered him a big plastic blinky ring as a present to "make him feel
better."  He announced, "you can't bribe me!"  She said it wasn't a bribe,
just a present to brighten his day.  He sneered, "Impossible!"  In his
world, no-one just gives anyone a little present out of love.  At raves,
this is common.  (big happy face).

Then the riot brigade of thirty cops arrived to clear the people out from
the front of the club.  Now, this was disturbing.  I'm from L.A. and have
observed many disgusting police brutality incidents.  In fact, the only
time I was ever hit by a man it was a fucking cop (at a demonstration for
women's rights! symbolic, eh?).  I thought San Francisco police would be a
lot more laid back, but I guess it's true about power corrupting... These
cops were unnecessarily aggressive, rude, mean and totally infuriating.  My
friend got stuck behind the police line, alone on a scary unlit street.
The line of cops moved down the street, pushing the rest of us like cattle,
screaming, "MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!"  I stopped and pointed behind them, saying
my friend was trapped around the corner on that street by herself, let me
please go to her, instead of up and around the block out of her sight
(where the cops were forcing the rest of us to go).  The response was a
reddening face screaming at me, "MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!", then threatening me
with arrest.  I ran around two blocks and finally met up with her, thank
God.  Basically, the San Francisco Police Department saw fit to jeopardize
the safety of my friend and the rights of all of us because...why? oh,
yeah, we were standing peacefully on a sidewalk outside of a club. :(  (And
they wonder why the rave scene doesn't cooperate with the nice
authorities...)

To salvage the night we headed over to Bondage-a-Go-Go.  Woo!  _This_ made
us forget the previous unpleasantness in a wonderland of fishnets, leather,
gyrating dancers, and live bondage sessions.  I was a Bondage virgin (so to
speak) and was put-off at first by the (club) environment.  Loud, grungy,
metally industrial techno, red lights, and lots of black, spikes,
deathrockers, and goth queens.  It was all so _dark_, and got me to
thinking about the whole dilemma about sexuality at raves (yes, I know this
was a recent thread topic).

I think of raves in terms of pink and baby blue.  It's Disneyland, full of
toys and happy children, with many psychedelic rides.  It's innocence.  It
allows us to get in touch with that inner child, that freedom, spontaneity,
joy, self-confidence.  But shouldn't this process of getting more in touch
with ourselves _also_ include sexuality?  In other words, is raving an
experience that actually only connects us with _part_ of ourselves, not the
whole?

Bondage is a club celebrating sexuality.   What I originally thought of as
alienating darkness became a necessary element for a realm of fantasies:
people exploring the "dark" side of their natures, the "sin", with all its
fetishized latex and nudity and harsh edges.   Upstairs volunteers waited
in lines to be dominated in front of an audience - whips, chains, clamps
and mindfucks -- the binary division into dominant and submissive/master
and slave.  It made me wonder (not for the first time) if sexuality is
dependent for its thrill on appealing to the taboo, the dark and nasty
side.  Is this dialectic of light/darkness in all of us?  I suddenly
imagined a whole person as a human yin-yang: baby-dressed happy raver with
teddy bear and big hugs on Friday, black-corset-wearing, red-lipsticked
night goddess on Saturday.   Just as people are freer with sweetness at
raves, I noticed people acting differently at Bondage.  No silly laughter,
just smoldering gazes.  Or maybe all of these experiences (raves, bondage)
are one-dimensional, made more intense for their singularity, easier to
explore only particular aspects of our selves.

Random thoughts...
until tomorrow, everybody!
Love, Nancy

That track is also on the CD - "It Came From Amsterdam"
with DJ Jean. It's an import so look around,
but I know Solid Grooves always has it.

I went to Cal Poly SLO for 4 1/2 yrs and _loved_ it, but it was so long ago
I doubt any of the same spots are hot or even lukewarm. But the beaches I'm
sure are still great...try Avila beach.  If you are a meat eater there is a
great Hofbrau restaurant in nearby Morro Bay on Embarcadero St. with an
amazing view of the water, Morro Rock and sea otters swimming by. Go
Mustangs!   Juliet :)

Free party for those 23 and under, but if you look young enough nobody will
care! Anyway, im spinning...YEAH! it is for Gay lesbian bi trans and
questioning youth, or anyone else. Free food free music...its going on at the
Eureka Valley rec center, off of the Castro. Call 1-800-246-PRIDE for more
info. ITs on 4/20 from 7pm-12am. Then afterwards its off to GAIA! See you all
at Kundalini, which by the way, a lot of love and care is being put into.
This party has gotten a really bad rap, when the people throwing this party
really have good intentions. The line-up is great, a coo location and
transportaion for those in need. Give Kundalini another chance!
Peace, respect and in Love with Justion,
Jonathan

P.S. I hope everyone had a blast at The Gathering, really sorry about the
water situation,we worked our asses off....Not to sound mean or anything but
in the course of the whole night.....only two people thanked us for the
water. I'm not asking for people to now thank us and shit, but when your
working really hard, your tired, and all you can do is watch everyone
danceing and haveing a good time.....A thank you can really be comforting!

The problem with a lot of those books (Chocolate to Morphine, etc.)
is that their information is just too old.

I would recommend that you check out this organization:

MAPS
1801 Tippan Ave
Charlotte, NC 28205
(704)358-9830


They're an organization devoted to psychedelic research an have a
monthly publication you can subscribe to. I think you can also buy
back issues related to topics you are interested. They do a lot of
research on E, acid, shrooms, GHB, etc. and their info is far more
current. Check it out.

                                            Hugs,

OK everyone,

  i know that for some of you this might be a trip but Ultraworld 
Productions based in Baltimore MD  is planning to throw their biggest
and most ambitious party ever called ECLIPSE on Saturday April 27th. at
the DC Armory in Washington D.C.

   Ultraworld Productions has been throwing the best raves on the 
East Coast since 1992.  I have never been let down by one of their parties
ever.  I am planning on attending it and encourage any
of you who have the ability to make the trip to ECLIPSE also do it.
If anyone is going let me know. =)  Maybe Ill have a suprise for you

Now Let me tell you about this party


   E C L I P S E  - Ultraworld  - April 27, 1996


	In the beginning there was darknes...
	And the forces of the universe looked upon the darkness and 
said, "What a great time to celebrate!"  And many parties were had in 
the darkness, and they were good.  Then light was created, and it was 
really bright.  And so dancing continued in the darkness until one day
a force known as Ultraworld decided to brave the light, to call everyone
together for an event of  great illumination.  The event is called ECLIPSE.
	The space is the massive DC Armory, with its super high ceilings,
all wooden dancefloor, safe parking, and clean facilities.  The space is
so good, that when they told us we could only go until 2 a.m., we decided
to go ahead and do it.  Bringing you a full 12 hour event, Eclipse will
start at 2 p.m. and go until 2 a.m.  We urge everyone to get there at
the start, there is no "opening" dj.  This event is going to kick ass

and their caling the measure "Bedtime for Bongos".  It brings up the 
concern that they could possibly be targeting outdoor parties also. :P

A friend told me last night about seeing Sven Vath spin once, and he had a
dancer who was wearing an amorphic michelin-man indeterrminate body suit wired
with lights -- and he came rolling onto the stage (i guess it was a stage) and
did a performance that ended up with him being surrounded by other lights -- he
said it was really cool and totally different - (he said that same night Moby
did a set that ended up with him stripping naked, which apparently is not
unusual, true Moonpup? --- I like seeing performance-based stuff when the space

I was kind of disappointed with the negativland show at the Troc.  I think
the worst part about it was that people were not DANCING.  This was
mostly due to the fact that the music was not DANCABLE.  I guess
there can be shows where people don't dance... but I just don't enjoy
those types of shows.

It seems funny that Negativland, who seem to be into the whole "the entire
country is programmed by television" would do a show where everyone is just
standing there mezmorized, hypnotized, zombified watching them.  You 
could stay at home stare and a tv and be brain-dead... or you can go to the
troc, stand around and stare at Negativland and be brain-dead.

This is in contrast to a band like say, Front 242 who combats television
complacency with driving body-gyrating sounds.  It seems like Negativland
wants to battle complacency with.... more complacency.

Okay, okay, I know that is just their "sound" and it is not meant for
dancing.  But, many times I thought they were pretty unprofessional
and unorganized on stage... there were LONG, boring pauses in which they
were trying to get things fixed or setup or whatever.

Then, on top of all this, you are in "the troc", a club where it seems
nobody ever has a good time.  Too many people, all standing around... 
drinking, smoking... I guess I just expected something else.  I think
this whole event would be VERY COOL if it took place in a movie theater
or planetarium.

The film projections were really cool.  Lots of old EE movies and stuff.
Did you see that one movie where they were explaining orders of magnitude
by zooming in on this guys's hand... to his skin texture, to his cells,
to his chromosomes, to his DNA, to the atom, through the electron shells,
and finally into the nuclius...  with the order of magnatude (in meters)
displayed on the screen too.... then they zoomed out into the universe,
with orders of magnatude going up.  I saw that film in a physics class
in college... very cool.

We left early from negativland becuase we were not having that much fun.
They should really consider doing these non-dancing events in more
relaxing, non-dancing venues.

yeah, i though it was kinda amusing though. I mean, you really can't take negativland seroiusly. Crotechty
old man ranting about 180 and G, sampling 'this is crap' over the other dj's musik. and 'drop dead' to the
audience. no- not a dance environment- the vibe is confusion IMHO. 
Also one of the few times where
the guy yelling at people on the fire escape fits in with the music theme.

Once I gave up trying to dance, and just relaxed and listened to the distortion
and various samples fighting for attention, I enjoyed myself.

was also really pleasd to see some Norman McLaran (sp?) clips in there.

my boss is crawling around under his desk.
i find this confusing

Yup -- all these are kept in my raver's kit. I usually leave my
sunglasses in my car, and bear the gremlins in my head yelping,
"Bright Light!" as I walk out of the venue..

Hmmm...this is a good one to add for future events. I especially like

Well, I don't smoke tobacco, so I omit these... Sometimes the clove

I have neglected to bring toys to raves. I see the value in them --
especially feathers, koosh balls (especially the day-glo kind), and
visual aids. [My girlfriend brought her feather boa to The Gathering,
and it was a big hit in the chill space.]

Bandaids? Are we raving, or slamming?

> ...and most important (esp if you're going anywhere near the Wicked sound

Yes! 

A few additional items I like to bring:
	lip balm
	eye drops (especially for my contact lenses)
	kleenex
	business cards, so the new friends I meet can contact me
	menthol & euclyptus oil -- especially yummy at hot parties
	massage oil or body lotion :)

I've discovered that fanny packs are very convenient for carrying my
kit.  They are often innocuous enough to evade the prying eyes and
fingers of the security guards (especially the black ones). In
addition, you can easily wear it around, allowing for security
and freedom from the weight and bulkiness on  your shoulders.

Ralph had it once, Len and it before, Paul had it afterward, and Bryan never

Mulligan had it twice in a row, and DR. Lowell had it before and afterward,
but he had it twice as bad afterward as he had it before. What is it?

The answer will be given at 2pm or around there.

Sometimes I carry my goodies in a black leather sporran (Class?  Who can
tell me what a sporran is?).
It's usually a good place to carry stuff, but at the first Tribal Funk I
went to (SF, Cow Palace), they took the leather-and-chain strap and held it
till I got out (could be used as a weapon, I guess...like I'd use a
weapon).  Fortunately I have friends who are happy to stuff my sporran
inside their daypacks, but unfortunately that means that I have to track
them down whenever I want to get something...
So, now I usually just stuff my pocketses with my precioussssss...

Here's a riddle I came across and thought I'd share


Ralph had it once, Len and it before, Paul had it afterward, and Bryan never
did have it. Girls have it once, but boys can't have it at all. Mrs.
Mulligan had it twice in a row, and DR. Lowell had it before and afterward,
but he had it twice as bad afterward as he had it before. What is it?

The answer will be given at 2pm or around there.

I'm pretty sure they are only targetting drummers downtown on Pacific Street
after 10pm.  I read an article in the paper (same one?) that said the police
get a lot of noise complaints from elderly people trying to sleep in the
apartment buildings across the street from the main sidewalk hangout area.

So... the ban seems reasonable to me.  I mean, people can still drum
until 10pm, which I often enjoy while walking downtown in the afternoon,
and then they just have to move away from the downtown area to let people
sleep.  They could go to the beach...

I personally go for the minimalist look with my drivers license and ATM 
card (for emergencies) and a enough dollar bills (no change pleeze) in 
one pocket and the key to my front door in another.  If I'm feeling 
really amibitious I might bring a water bottle.  This way I can dance free 
and unattached all night long...no gear to worry about.

Although a couple of Progress parties were held at Acme, the one I attended
was not.
Also I heard Acme has a new owner who is not interested in hosting parties
(though one wonders if he realizes the income potential...?)  I heard an
estimate that previous Acme owners walked away with close to $200,000 a
year off of rentals. - N

	that's interesting.  there was a guy in the very very front

	clearly pronunced phrases like "that drum rhythm is very
	boring"  and "i payed eleven dollars for THIS?"  he diddn't

	that was on his plate.  to much jonah for him.  too much
	-land for you, it sounds like.

	first off, negativland's music has never tried to be dancable.
	their early albums are just cut-ups.  and for a -land show,
	this *was* very dancable.  jonah and those other dudes did
	a good job of popping some rhythm into the fray.

	wow. i'm sorry, but i feel like you are just gravely missing
	the point.  also, if you were braindead there, it's your own
	fault.  "i stood there barely able to manage cohesive thought"
	is something i would be ashamed to admit on a huge mailing list.

	*sigh*
	doyou have any idea of the history behind -land?
	have you ever seen them before?
	were you expecting a rave?

	no rehersal, five hours of improvisational collaboration...
	the weatherman has not performed with them for TEN YEARS.
	what you thaought was "unprofessional" was art, and you
	really cannot justify your opinion otherwise, not to me
	anyway.  besides, pauses, even silence, are an important
	part of a performance.  but i guess when you get used to
	teevee you get kind of scared when there is a pause, at
	least without a colorful logo in it.

	i definately agree here, that was a show that had not enough
	breathing room at least.  sit down would have been cool.

	last i saw -land was at the oasis in san jose.  it was crowded
	but not packed, they were easier to see. in a way it was a
	better show - though the collaborative, improvisational nature
	of last nights event was fantastic.  that's art in realtime,
	by the seats of their pants.  many aspects of my own musical
	group were visible on that stage last night - improv, live
	radio scanning... for which of course we bow in deference
	to those pioneers who came before us.

	who did the visuals, anyway?

	we left after about 1.5 hours.  that lummox heckling kind of killed
	it for me early on, but the main factor was that we were were just
	plain bushed.  that and the big crowd just made it too exhasting.
	i'll just get the show tape, that's music you have to focus on
	anyway...

That sounds a little high to me, but they were definitely making mucho
denero.  Tempting isn't it?  Friend of mine went to his first rave and
immediately stated he was going to look for a loft in SOMA to have parties
at.  I said, "Yeah, but then you'd have all these freaks, that keep wanting
to hug you, in your house all weekend, every weekend..."

Doesn't that sound delicious?!   :^)

 Opinions of the Negativland performance

 My anticipations of the audience mix were verified by the comments made
by two guys who were standing behind me in line:

 ( Looking at show poster on telephone pole ) 
 Guy 1: "Whos this Hard Kiss band? And Jonah Sharp?"
 Guy 2: "Hardkiss Brothers. Them and Jonah Sharp are DJs"
 Guy 1: "Huh ..."

 This was a NEGATIVLAND concert , with "special guest" support by the
great "Hard Kiss" brothers and Mr. Sharp . So , I knew right at the 
beginning that it was going to be more of a sound collage / ambient
industrial show than a rave. 

 Inside , it was hard-core Negativland fans and ravers in the audience
mix. I like old school ambient industrial as well as techno and breakbeat,
so just about anything coming off the stage was OK by me! There were
times that I thought the uncharted jam between all invovled had a 
"train wreck" effect, at other times all meshed together quite well.
Some times , I actually thought the Hardkiss bros and Jonah Sharp were
turned up too high!

 The Troc was the Troc , albeit with no chill rooms or basement open. 

 I wonder if there was any cross-pollination of fans between the two
groups in the audience? I know there must have been more folks there
than just me who could appreciate both styles that collided/collaborated
last night.

 This is just a request to you folks out there in SFRaves land. Does
anyone here use speakers for mixing music that they would like to 
recommend to me? I am dabbling in audio manipulation and creating
music with my home computer. I have a Digidesign Audiomedia II card
in an accelerated Mac II. So far , I'm just using a boom box as my
amplification and speakers, with Sony MDR v6 headphones to hear any
real low bass.

 Just email your recommendations to me , and I'll compile the replies
and post them to SFRaves.

Okay, since we're spouting riddles, here's one:

	A bum rolls cigarettes out of cigarette butts which he finds lying
around.  It takes 4 butts to make one cigarette.  If he finds 16 butts,
how many cigarettes can he make?


	Feh.

try this riddle...
Three men go to a hotel because they're sleepy. The night manager tells them
the room will be $60, so they divide it three ways and each pay $20. As
they're on their way up to their room, the manager realizes the room was
only supposed to cost $55, so he sends the bell boy up with $5 to give
them. Realizing that three does not divide five evenly, the bell-boy
gives them each a dollar, and keeps two dollars for himself, so each man
winds up paying $19, and they payed $57 total. Since the bell boy has the
other two dollars, and $57 + $2 = $59, what happened to the other dollar?????

George added great stuff to the list, some of which I carry all the time....  

The flashlight is for finding stuff that dropped, as well as checking out the
port-a-pottie situation (I'd rather see it before it gets me!) and the kleenex
comes in handy there too..  I keep a little keychain type squeeze light on the
zipper of my pack, and a bigger one inside...

Toys can be great .. my friend Keith has this cool plastic toy for babies that
is a ball with bumps on it, and it vibrates ...  

"Bandaids? Are we raving, or slamming?" Honey, we're dancing all night, and our
feet might get a little blister! Or any kind of boo-boo

Hand cream ... yep, especially helpful to "freshen up" funky hands, too -- I
ought to get some of those little wipe things in the foil packs, too..

Business cards -- yes!  I carry cards that just have my name and home phone on
it (with other cryptic glyphs only some people can decipher) --and add a pen and
some paper to that too ... I get asked for that all the time....

I also try to carry a light funky shirt or something I can put down to sit on in
questionable places -- I was glad I did that at that Deli place one night,
'cause the funky sweater got hella gum on it, and protected my nice satin
skirt...

I know people get their stuff stolen sometimes, which is why I like to either
have a very distinctive backpack that I can also stuff my coat into (like my
plastic one) or a black pack with some distinguishing mark (mine has a Giants
patch) that I can cram into a dark corner -- and I never leave it out of my
sight...

I know all about negativlands history and used to be pretty into them.  I
thought last nights show was pretty boring and uninspired. Nice idea, but
after witnessing an hour of so of it I would have to say it was a failed
experiment, at least imo.  It seemed like a pretty random mishmash, and I
saw some pretty frustrated expressions on stage at times...

I saw them live on their last tour in socal and thought that was pretty
weak too, I don't think their material goes over live very well.  And
their brand of humor doesn't do much for me these days, the same routines
just aren't very funny anymore.  I think they should stick to radio... 

I personally wasn't expecting it to be very "ravey", but I thought I'd
give it a chance on the slight posibility that it would be cool, it
wasn't.  The last time I was at the troc (lame ebn/banco de gaia show a
couple months back) I promised myself I wouldn't go back, no matter what. 
I should've stuck to that promise and gone to pack-a-bowl instead. Live
and learn... 

Andy

ps anyone know for sure if Harmony is happening tonight? Someone posted in
the last day or so saying they lost their location, is this confirmed?

                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
This logic in this equasion is incorrect for the circumstances.  They paid
$60, got three back, wich equals $57, and the bell-boy kept two, which
equals $55.  It should read $60 - 3 = 57 - 2 = $55.

     --Good People--
     
     Hello!
     
     I've just returned after my customary winter hibernation, and I just 
     wanted to mention how nice it was to rejoin the list and find the same 
     generous atmosphere, coupled with a healthy flow of stimulating 
     conversation.  While never much more than reticent in the past, after 
     reading the first few messages I felt compelled to post something, and 
     to find out what's goin' on.  Recently my friends and I have been 
     itching for a good outdoor event we could go to and get ourselves 
     properly dirty.  Will Frequency 8 be resuming their parties soon?  Are 
     any alternatives (near the City) possible this weekend?  Apologies if 
     this has been discussed much already, but I don't know how long we can 
     go before the jones gets fierce.
     
     Corey

Unfortunately i dont think this worked.  Especially at the Gathering where
there was a five deep crowd of people watching the dj's.  I think that 
the problem with this set-up was that if the dj is supposed to be the
"center" of the party then you should at least be able to see him without
having to stop and crowd in close and look over three other people.

  Its always nice to know that the dj's is there and having them a few
feet above the crowd would allow me to see them while in front of a 
speaker 100 feet away

It wasnt ACME.  it was a warehouse on Mission between 4th and 5th I believe.
it was a nice location and larger then the ACME.  I also went to the 
August party there and had an amazing time dancing also on the top floor!
everyone else was also bugging out.  i think some of it had to do with
this certain guy and his sugar cubes tho ;)

  I have to agree with Jess.  I usually do the same thing also.  After
partying for awhile and hearing about bags and cameras and jackets etc.
etc. stolen any pretense i held that "no one would ever steal an item
from me at a rave"  is gone.
  after all it only takes one person to ruin it for all.

Hello all,
	I haven't gone out in over a month whilst preparing for a grad 
school exam.  I have always been the epitome of self-control when it 
comes to things like this, but about now I am starting to feel like a 
caged rat!!

	Anyway, tomorrow is the big day and afterwards I am going to finally 
cut loose.  I think it will be to State of Divinity basically because I am 
too wary of Kundalini, and I also really want to hear Tracy.  It sounds like 
it is going to be a big affair, but I am taking a few of my best friends 
who have never gone, and I think they will enjoy a big production.  
Anyway, I am hoping Inner Circle does good, but also I am in such great 
spirits just at the thought of finishing my test, that I am 
full of great vibe and will have a marvelous time wherever I am!!  If 
anyone thinks this is going to be a terrible party, please let me know!!

I would love to meet anyone who ventures to this party.  I don't really 
have any funky hat or clothes that would make me stand out.  I will have 
a ladybug puppet that is really cool. Also, I have earrings with my name 
in rainbow colors-kirsten.  If you get close enough to see these, you 
_better_ introduce yourself! :)  Anyway, I am 5'4", 120 lbs, shoulder 
length brn hair, brn eyes.  

Send me vibes tonight so that they will permeate my brain and help me do 
well tomorrow!!  


Wishing everyone the best...

kc

Me too. After a backpack of mine was stolen at a party, I realized maybe 
I don't need the clutter...it depends though. One thing people may have 
forgotten is tissues, especially at outdoor events; the dust often 
irritates my nose. Gorgeous day again...can't wait for the commitment 
free weekend! Talilla

Hello everyone,

    Well, as some of you might have heard, Harmony has been postponed 
for a couple of weeks. To make a long story short, we had contracts 
signed for a space in the south bay. However, the management of the 
facilities decided to not go through with the party leaving us without 
a space, two days before the party. So, we tried to get another, but 
came up short, and decided it would be a better idea to postpone the 
party and do it with careful planning and consideration, rather then 
bring you a quick, "throw-together" production. We feel it is important 
to have everything as perfectly planned as possible. 

    So, on a sad note, we have to postone tonights party. On a happier 
note, we are going to try to set up a FREE PARTY on Saturday (April 
12th). It will be somewhere in or by Santa Cruz, and will start as soon 
as we get there (noonish), and go until sunset. Call the Harmony lines 
@ (408) 486-9591 and (408) 450-3044 for more info. 

    We would really like to see all of you there to show your support 
and join us to create harmony...

Peace, love, and harmony to all,

Greg :)

Think of it...

Harmony does a daytime party on the beach in Santa Cruz on Saturday,
everyone piles into cars and heads down to the beach in Santa Barbara
Saturday night/Sunday morning, back into the cars and we all head up to
Santa Cruz where we find out Sunset is having a beach party on Sunday!!

The first two are distinct possibilities and the later, well, we could only
hope for.

Depending on a friend's work schedule, this may be a reality.

Maybe others will join?  ;^)

hey there everybody!

Just writing to say hello, this is a message from Shawna, not Brad!

Up here visiting, gonna go to a party prolly tonight and tomorrow night, so
will probably have an interesting review of a Quebec party to describe. The
city's different too, everybody's hella quiet and nobody smiles here.  We
have to get Ecto back to the Bay Area! :)

Anyway, just wanted to say hello, and Brad says hello too!

Love,

Does anyone own the Essential Mix Uk import CD featuring Carl Cox, Pete 
Tong, Sasha and Paul Oakenfold?    

Sasha's mix blows me away.  Question is I can't quite figure out what 
style it is...does anyone know.  I'd love suggestions so I can hone in on 
more music of this type.  I often hazzard guesses but in truth I rarely 
know what I'm talking about.


Yours in musical ignorance and hoping for some light to guide me,

Jess

:( :( :( :(

Was _really_ looking forward to this one!  A couple of friends of mine
(newbies, but with open hearts and minds) wanted to see what it was all
about.  I've made them wait a little while for Harmony.  A great crowd of
five of us were hyped for tonight...  But I guess anticipation just makes
it sweeter, right?  Only thing is, four weeks from now is finals, and this
was to be our last pardy-hardy week-end before term papers and finals kick
in.  And after finals, everyone disperses out of the Bay Area - three of
the newbies I was to bring tonight are actually leaving the country for a
year.

Much sympathy and thanks out to the Harmony crew for what I'm sure was lots
and lots of preparation, just to be screwed over by the owners of the
space.  It is especially nice of them to offer a free party to make it up
to us, when it was not their fault _and_ none of us have bought tickets
yet.  You all are the best!

We really need to work on the location issue!!  This is, from what I
understand, the only reason we have not had the number of Friends &
Family's, Chrysalis', and Harmony's that are possible...

Could some party planners list suggestions for how to go about finding
spaces??  Then maybe the 400 of us on this list can put our collective
energy to work and help find our party spots!!

Love, Nancy

One of my friends is throwing this.  It's his fist party but he's got alot
of support from other old skoolers helping him out on it.  The space is
large, and very nice (nice as in ti's a place of business) and I hope the
people who go take care of it.  I unfortunatly will be in San Louis Obisbo
and can't make it.
Those breakbeat/jungle/trip hop/dancesters should love this party. and it's
on the 19th.
Peace,
Austin

I dunno... my friend Maryam went and she wasn't on a guest list. She was
all stoked because the Beastie's gave her personal approval to tape their
show... I think it was some kind of Hardcore punk thing, taking them back
to the early 80's...

I just heard the voice mail, and it looks like they lost their space.

I have been workin' all week and haven't had the time to work on my weekend
plans.  Is there anything else going on (under 21, my sis is 18) tonight?
I really wanted to take my sister to Harmony tonight.

Thanks,

in another kitchen!

Happening again tonight and for the following few weeks...

10PM 
Josie's Cabaret 16th/Market

another episode of Heather Woodbury's performance novel on the topic of
"jazz, rave, and brussels sprouts". One woman, one hundred characters
--  partially inspired by her and Dudley Saunder's journey to
Kalifurnya during prime beachtime raving season -- attending SF Raves's
and perhaps the bay area's first rave at bonnie doon. 

Below is someone's comment on this (author name is call by reference):

|i cannot recommend this more highly. the woman is incredible. i only saw a
|couple of episodes, back when it was a weekly show at a bar in the e
|village (which then became a much shorter, tighter series at PS 122--i
|think that's what she's doing at josie's) but she's got an incredible ear
|and is a kickass storyteller and delightful actress. old ladies and little
|ravers and pimps and prostitutes and yuppies all coexist and cross paths in
|this incredibly coherent universe she creates. it's very satisfying. you
|needn't catch all 8 episodes (whittled down from like 32!)--you can drift
|in anywhere and immediately get your bearings. but GO GO GO GO!!!!

"Absorbing ... Seamless... Amazing"
	Cynthia True, Time Out NY.

--------------------

PS: Some of the inspiration in this
one-person-many-characters-performance was inspired by Heather's
positive experiences at the SF Raves "Connection"  rave at Bonnie Dune
Beach in Santa Cruz (damn, when was that 92? 93?). Heather came with a
friend who writes for Spin Magazine and he ended up writing a  1-pager
on SF's rave scene that predominantly mentioned an underground rave on
some unnamed california beach -- an early, accurate, and positive
accounting of the rave scene in the press... There's mention of this in
the early SFR archives.

search for that name (try alta vista off of http://www.search.com/ and
use the proper capitalization for a name) -- some of the early sfraves
archives are on the web so you should be able to get a search hit.

Then look at the date of the message and that should give you a pretty
good idea of the timeframe of that article ...

I quite frankly don't remember the dates, but vaguely recall that this
article was published in november-december-january-february-march
timeframe after that connection rave. Since I just moved and
undoubtedly threw away any nonessential paper encumberances, I doubt I
have that article any more.

bzzzzzzzzzzttt!

the correct answer is *5*

the hobo makes the 4 cigars with the 16 butts, then makes one more with the
butts from those four.

where it gets strange is that i heard this riddle in elementary school and
hadn't heard it since, but just happened to remember it a couple days ago
and told it to a friend.

synchronicity abounds,

Nancy,

    Thanks for your good thoughts! It is really hard for a promoter to 
keep a positive mind in this sort of situation, but we are really 
trying. I think the only salvation of our collective positive conscious 
would be to throw a free party. That always makes us happy!!! That is 
why we are doing it!!!! 
    As far as the postponed party, keep your ears open for a few weeks. 
It will be real soon!!!

See ya all tomorrow,

Greg :)

At the end of it all, they said "thanks for taking part in this experiment.
We think some parts of it worked well, others didn't work at all."

But it was cool for me to be part of the experimental process... almost
like hanging out in the studio with them.

The mix was a lot better if you were right near the stage and not in front
of the speakers.

Yes, there was cross-pollination! Kind of cool to see some
industrial/grunge fans dancing to the Hardkiss beat. Cross pollination is
important, if you spend too much time doing one thing, you lose the
opportunity to find new things you might like.

Also, everyone I talked to agreed that the visuals were excellent. "Rave"
party promoters take note: visuals on this level could really make a party
stand out.

PS- I heard an interesting comment that night. "For a group that is acting
all anti-corporate / anti-media-conglomerate, they sure are merchandising
themselves well."

from the alt.hemp CANNABIS/MARIJUANA FAQ (available: http://hyperreal.com/drugs/faqs/FAQ-alt.hemp)

    The part of marijuana that gets you high is called
    `Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.'  Most people just call this
    THC, but this is confusing: your body will change
    Delta-9-THC into more inert molecules known as
    `metabolites,' which don't get you high.  Unfortunately,
    these chemicals also have the word `tetrahydrocannabinol' in
    them and they are also called THC -- so many people think
    that the metabolites get you high.  Anti-drug pamphlets say
    that THC gets stored in your fat cells and then leaks out
    later like one of those `time release capsules' advertised
    on television.  They say it can keep you high all day or
    even longer.  This is not true, marijuana only keeps you
    high for a few hours.

Jess,

I can't help you with the CD you mentioned, but if you've got a PC/Mac with a 
sound card and 28.8K Internet Connection then you can listen to 24 hour UK & 
US Dance Music over the Net.

Most of the mixes are by our resident DJs Alex and Dan, but there is some 
excellent work by SF's own DJ Moonpup.  We are currently talking to most well 
known UK DJs (inlcuding the one's on the Essential Mix CD) so watch this 
space.

Point your browser at :

http://www.griffin.co.uk  and follow the links for Audio/Music.

See ya

Adrian.

well.. it's 4am and i just made it back to my house.. and here i am, eating
cheerios :)
the party was not held at acme, it was held on a warehouse on minna street.
i got my ticket from acme about 12:30ish, and got to the warehouse pretty
quickly (it's just down by 10th). there wasn't a line outside, but as soon
as i got in the door i found myself in a small corridor, with people on both
sides waiting to get in, while people were trying to get out through the
same corridor. i couldn't wait to get out of the line and into the party.
inside the party was just as bad as the waiting line. it was packed!
it was very difficult to find a place to dance. i eventually did, met a
couple people, and shed a couple pounds of water.
the place was hot and humid. there were no fans, and no effective
ventalation. the floor was slippery with condensation and i got hit by a
couple drops of water from the ceiling too.
for the hundreds of people there, there was _one_ bathroom. i waited in line
for about 45 minutes so i could get in just to fill up on water. completely
ridiculous. the organizers were selling bottled water. i didn't bother to
check the price, tap water's good enough for me, and water should be free,
anyhow. The organizers really should have provided a more accessible water
tap, especially because of the intense heat and humidity.
as to the vibe. what vibe? i didn't really sense anything in the way of vibe
here. ran into many people who were nice (especially after i offered them
water), but as a general feeling, the party just didn't have it. some bad
vibe being churned out by a few guys who were drinking 40oz'ers of malt
liquor. manly acting up and such bravado. woo hoo. i didn't see them after a
while, or maybe one of them was the guy who was leaning his head up against
the speaker ... (he'll regret that in the morning!)
oh yah. there was no chill space either. just one big room.
*sigh* too bad harmony wasn't on tonight instead.. :(
oh well. it wasn't a terrible time, just not a memorable one.

yeah, it was pretty frustrating. def not as neat as the something special
that was there. It definately picked up towards the end. Music got better,
wasnt as packed, just a lot more fun. (and I think I heard an ' i dream of
jeanie' sample which made me smile for a long time.)

Subject: Brad's birthday! :) (from shawna)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hey all, I'm back again, just gotta make a quick note to all to wish Ecto a
happy 24th birthday!!! :)  Doin my best to bring a little bit of SF to
Montreal & give him a happy birthday!

Well, went to my first party last night, it was actually a small house
party.  There really are a lot of differences between raving in SF and
raving here.  All the beautiful decorations that parties such as Chrysalis
are almost entirely missing, there are a few visuals, but full-on
decoration & black lights with the black light art & altars & all that
groovy stuff is completely missing.  The chill room is very different too,
in sf I'm used to big old piles of love pretty much filling up the whole
room, here people just sit by themselves & lay there, or if there is
interaction with other people, they just sit there individually and discuss
things.  It was kinda weird.  Apparently this is totally standard for
montreal, people just don't get like that, they all keep to their own
defined personal space which is totally alien to me for a rave.  They were
nice, I met several of Ecto's friends.  And this was considered to be a
really good party!  Most, if no all, parties here, are MASSIVE events with
huge 11x17 flyers that have huge 15 dj lineups, that cost $25 or more.
We're probably gonna attend one of those tonight, I'm sure I'll have an
interesting review of that one! ;)  I had a lot of fun at last night's
party, it was very mellow & relaxed, gave me a chance to have some quality
hanging-out time with Brad, it was just really weird to observe the many
differences.  One big difference (!!) was that this was a private party,
someone's house party, yet they were asking $10 donations.  Is this a
common thing that I just haven't seen in SF?  Usually, aside from paying
for e if you get it, I don't remember people charging for house parties.
And really, it was a charge, not a donation, even tho they said it was a
"donation", cause they were prepared to not let you in the door if you
didn't pay your money!  Definitely a different mentality up here, maybe
it's just me, but if I invite a bunch of people to my house for a party,
I'm not gonna require them to pay $10 each!  Nobody dresses up here either,
no fun outfits to look at!  In fact, there was one guy (whom everybody else
called the "Miami Vice guy" due to the way he dresses)  who dressed in a
suit!  Now who on earth would wear a fucking suit to a rave?  He had the
pants, jacket, tie, shoes & the whole shebang.  It just doesn't make
logical sense to me to wear anything other than something fun &
comfortable.  It's just funny the perspective one has, to Brad this was a
really great party, a lot closer to the kind of party he looks for, while
to me (even tho I enjoyed myself) it was really lacking that which really
gives a rave its soul.  Boy, I can hardly imagine what the massive is gonna
be like tonight!  Definitely an experiment in different cultures.  Well, at
least the music'll probably be good, hard techno & some goa! :):)

Well gotta go, time to take a shower & figure out what to do with the day.
So all you guys out there in SF, hello to you, I love you all (& appreciate
you more than ever! ;), and like I'm sure you actually do, "APPRECIATE
THIS!!" :)

Love,
Shawna

we were unable to do this party, unfortunetly, and we sincerely 
appologize for any inconvenience. everything was together, and i had 
access to two generators here in the south bay, but both options fell

moonpup's list was great!  and the sunglasses are important too..

here's my list...

money
 i.d.
pipe and fixin's
 sunglasses
 candy (lollipops, lifesavers, gum) to share with everyone (come and ask!)
flashlight
cigarettes (again, plenty to share, and yes I know it's a nasty habit)
toys (I've got cool kalaidescopes for this weekend to the first 3 wonderful
people!)
bandaids and ibuprofen
...and most important (esp if you're going anywhere near the Wicked sound
system!)  .... earplugs!  be nice to your ears!

And I stow them all in a clear plastic backpack with outside pockets, the
doormen/security people love it, but it's falling apart!   waaah!

Bye!   Leslie  : )

=============================================

never forget STICKERS to stick to folks, preferably small shiny ones .... 
and a water bottle of your own if they'll let you take it inside, cos 
it's much cheaper to find a tap and fill er up, dontcha think?  :)

Hello everybody!

Harmony will be held at Bonnie Dunes starting about now.
I'll be there so if you see me pass by and say Hi!
I have a little red cooler with a tumor popping out
of the side.(My cooler got cancer at a full moon a while back
because it was too close to the fire) I'll try to bring as much
food for everybody as I can.

                                          Hugs,
                                           CT

Hi folks!
 According to the research I've read, THC is stored in fatty tissues so it 
is retained for a long time, I've read up to 30 days. The Psychedelics 
Encyclopedia and other books (available at better book shops) have the 
exact info and refrences.

The visuals were by Craig Baldwin, of Artists Television Access.  He is
quite a master of found footage collage, and he also made a documentary
called "Sonic Outlaws", about Negativland, John Oswald, and other
musicians working with "appropriated sound"....

If any promoters got him to do visuals at an event, I would be *very*
excited!  especially after seeing what he did at the Negativland show.

To sfraves...

This is a "dumb" (basic) question, but as a fairly new user of e-mail, etc
I'm not sure and thought it better to just ask.

If I'm writing a response to a posting on sfraves, how can I tell if the
response should be sent back to sfraves or directly to the person's e-mail?
Also, how can I tell if a response to one of my postings has come directly
from the person or was posted back on sfraves and came to me that way? Does
this question make sense?

managed to make it out to kundalini last night. picked up krishna on my way
to san jose (melissa had a sudden attack of alergies and was a mucous
monster). drove quite a ways to get to the party. the voice message said it
was going to be 50 minutes south of SF, which it was not. :(  as well, it
was held at a virgin space, which ended up being a roller rink in sj. i'm
sure there are lots of roller rinks in the bay area, are we going to have to
hear about a virgin space everytime one gets used? since all roller rinks
are pretty much the same, the feel of the location isn't new, even though
the building might be..
we got there and there was a pretty big line waiting to get in. An
interesting crowd. Lots of gangsta types.. I went back to the car to take
some ginseng, and by the time i got back, krishna had met some people (who's
names i've forgotten :( -all except sparkles, who gave me some sparkly
spinkles for my face) and we chatted with them while waiting for the line to
go in. after a bit of waiting, the line moved a little bit, and then one of
the promotors (or someone in charge) came out and said that there would be
no smoking or guns inside (gum? no gum?? one of our newfound friends was a
little concerned for a second. <g>). the fact that they had to mention that
there were no guns allowed inside seemed a little scarry to me. after a
little while longer, someone came out and told the line to split up into two
lines - "girls against the wall, and guys right here". yep. they segregated
up. how about the male/female issue at raves. apparently we aren't equal. :(
apart from many line-jumpers who slipped in during the confusion of
splitting up the line, the line moved pretty quickly. when we got to the
door, i saw it was lyon securities (of lucky charms fame). to their credit,
they were very efficient and courtious. the guard even let me bring in my
camelbak! i'd folded up the bladder inside it and i don't think she had any
idea what it was (maybe some fancy bong of some sort??). big ripoff that
noone could bring in their water bottles though.
inside, krisha bought a water bottle for $2.50 (highway robbery). you could
refill it in the washroom and a water fountain, good news for me since i
dumped my water to add the mysterious element to the nature of my camelbak.
the washrooms were big enough to handle everyone, which was a big plus after
out-a-sight. :)
the vibe was pretty non-existant. our new friends were radiating it, but the
bad was oozing out of a few circles. lots of circle dancers there, krishna
remarked once we were in that it was like a high-school dance (albiet more
expensive). krishna met some of his breakdancing 'friends', ("yo, wassup!
gonna do some dancin', or wat?") and did some breaking at the end of the
night. krishna can do some pretty amazing stuff! if you see him, definately
ask him to do some breaking. he can do some pretty crazy spins and flips,
and he makes it look so easy!
just after we got there, spun started to play. it was terrible. it was like
spun was trying to play every single song he had. he'd start up one tune,
keep it going for about a minute, then stop the beat and start up a new
track! it was like he was practicing all the new starts he could do for his
sets. really disruptive to dancing. at one point, he had this cool scratch
going with this awesome (electro?) beat that was really moving me, but he
just stopped after about 20 seconds. and stopped literally. the music just
hit a wall, stopped, and then started on a new song. it was awful. dj dan
came on next, and he was _much_ better. he was playing better music, and he
kept it going long enough to dance to.
it cost $20 to get in. someone was definately making money off this one..
there were only two video screens, two strobe lights,  one bank of lasers,
and a few hangings lit up by some black lights. the money certainly wasn't
spent on a good light show. or the sound system, which consisted of two
speakers at one end of the arena. again, there was no chill room. :(  the
speakers were so far away that you could have a conversation.
the vibe improved as time went on (krisha attributed this to the fact that
everyone started to peak on their e high <g>) and people started to get more
friendly. i was just dying for the dj to play some gabba, just to see what
all the breakdancing kids would do. ;)
krisha said that when he went to his last kundalini, he promised himself he
wouldn't go to another. i'm going to make the same promise to myself now, i
recommend everyone else stay away too.

Subject: DUNE pictures online!

Okay guys and gals the day has arrived!!  I picked up my 5 rolls of film
developing from Thrifty today and they turned out AWESOME!  I used the
great new KONICA PC PictureShow service, so all of my photos are also
digitized on disk.  Tonight I am converting several of my favorites from
DUNE into .GIF format so that you all can come and take a look at them.
Since I leave tomorrow for SF, I dont have time to make neato icons and
stuff for them and will just make a text menu (with a description) of the
photos that I put online.

So come check out my website on Friday and I several great (very crisp)
photos will be online for all of you to see.  Then I will add more later,
once I return to Los Angeles.

The Deeper Network = http://home.earthlink.net/~kevinvascon/raves

>From the menu, click on the icon that says 'PHOTOS' and you will get the
menu of pictures to select from.  Enjoy!

That's a pretty narrow attitude and will get you nowhere in life.  I've
been to many enjoyable shows where the point was to WATCH the spectacle
being presented.

Hell, The Residents did a gig in an auditorium where there were SEATS...
imagine that... I sat down THE WHOLE TIME... and it was one of the best
experimental music shows I've ever been to...

The difference is that Negativland (on a good day) give you something to
THINK about while you "stand around and stare".

(Last night was not a good day for them... I'll get into why later.)

F242 are about as pre-packaged and formulaic as Madonna, in their own way.
You could quite easily say that Madonna combats TV complacency with
driving, body-gyrating sounds.  People do dance at Madonna shows as well...

>It seems like Negativland
>wants to battle complacency with.... more complacency.

That is totally false and pretty much antithetical to the whole spirit of
the band.  See http://sunsite.unc.edu/negativland/ for info.

I've seen Negativland twice before last night.  First time was at a
cafeteria at Hampshire College, second time was at a small club in San
Jose.  Both times were pretty spectacular and mind-blowing.  I think when
Negativland are left alone to be themselves, they are godlike.  I don't
know whose idea it was to shackle them with the Hardkisses and Jonah but it
was really lame.  Scott and Jonah's ideas of collaboration seemed to be
"play music as if DJing or performing live and ignore everything else
that's happening."  Neither of them seemed to show any sort of sympathy or
involvement with Negativland, which was a real shame, but it was pretty
much what I expected.

At least I got to see The Weatherman live finally...

I just thought I'd pass on a note to those of you wondering why I might ask
$10.00 for a cassette, or just in general let you future DJ wanna be's know
what your in for.... 
 
I just calculated how much I have spent on records, cd's and cassettes so
far this year. 
 
(thats 100 days.....) 
 
on cassettes I have spent     $ 767.97 
 
on 12" singles                        $1123.51 
 
for a total of                           $1891.48                    thats
approx $600.00 per month 
                                                                           
                            or $150.00 per week 
 
that doesn't include the $200.00 I spent on mailing my tapes to the U.K. 
 
and I don't even consider myself a working DJ, it's more of a hobby, 
 
well not entirely, I've recieved at 4 parties (out of about 20 gigs so far)
a total of $320.00 this year to date........ 
 
I hadn't noticed till I got layed off from my job........so folks next time
you see a dj (like me) hawkin tapes, help spread the music, the vibe and
the wealth.......cause I'm goin broke givin out too many free
tapes............ 
 
                                                                           
        thanks...........moonpup

Hmmm. What, then, do you think of hardcore/evil (not happy) gabba and
rotterdam? Of Lenny Dee and DJ Skinhead? Of giving tracks names like "Kill More
People" and "The Realm of Darkness"? (Not to mention "Cocksucker," "I'm the
Fuck You Man," and "Fuck Them")

I think maybe in the global "rave" scene, there's a harder, darker, or more
aggressive side that's not as apparent on the west coast, or in SF, at least. I
mean, having events called "Nightmare" and "Terrordrome" says something,
doesn't it?

Just a thought. (Please don't shower me with flames about negativity...)

Well, it was just a guess, the same way I'd guess that if you heard Mars (the
F-8 one, not the NJ one), you probably heard cybertrance, even though I haven't
heard Mars spin before (and I'd have a harder time defining cybertrance). And
if you heard Ron D Core, it was probably acid. Derrick May and techno. Lenny
Dee and hardcore. DJ Rap and jungle. Keoki and a bad attitude. =) Just like how
people on this list who've never been to (and now maybe never will) Acme might
associate it with the image of a hot, sweaty deathtrap. It's not raver's
intuition, they've just heard and read about things from other people. But one
time I was at Acme, downstairs watching Astral Matrix perform (I think), and
the crowd was fairly sparse, so it didn't seem too hot to me. Does that make
all those people who think Acme is unbearably hot, wrong?

I would have to totally disagree with you. I spent at least 5 hours working
there, and there was a big fucking chill room in the back, we created a
tunnel that feel apart, but there was a ton of bean bags and feathers and
stuff. Spun didn't go on until after tony, and Donald Glaude, Dan, and Tony
and Spun and every other Dj there went off! The Music was fucking amazing.
The 2.50 water was being sold by the skate rink. There rules not Kundalinis.
They didn't want cigs or whatever else. The music was low because it would
have been shut down if it was louder, there were apartments 20 feet from the
building. The lazers were amazing too. I really enjoyed the light show... I
talked to the guys doing it and they were totally going off! I thought the
vibe was cool...Everyone was real friendly. I wasn't down with the circle
dancing but some people felt the need to show off, (anyone check out the
karate guys?) Well anyway, I think Jeff and Rich should be commended, they
both threw a really good party. If you all could hear what Jeff was thinking,
about the party meaning so much to him, and people enjoying it.

Hey again all!

Well, went to my first actual quebec rave last night, quite large!  Not
quite as big as the Gathering I went to in december, but over 1000 people
I'm sure.

Main most annoying difference:  these people love to buy Vicks vapor rub
and slather it all over themselves and run around like that!  Boy does that
stuff stink, and since everybody's into it there's no escaping it.  After a
while the smell starts to burn your eyes and you have to go in search of
clean air.  They use it like we use lotion, giving each other massages with
it, I dont know how they can deal with the bad smell and burning eyes.
They really should discover plain ol ordinary lotion!

Anyway, the vibe is completely different.  The vibe we're all familiar with
from sf is definitely not there, this is not a warm & mushy bunch of
people!  The whole thing is very hard-edged, actually.  People chill a lot
less in the chill room, people don't really smile, & they certainly don't
just start talking to you (unless they're trying to hit on you or
something).  That entire vibe is definitely not a Quebec thing.  However,
having been a little forewarned by Brad as to how raves here operated, I
wasn't really expecting it anyway, so I was not disappointed by not running
into happy smiling ravers who'd spontaneously give you a hug.  And
actually, I had a really kick-ass time at this party, because one thing
they do have here is HARD music!  This includes all genres, hard trance,
techno, house, and I'd swear they had hard ambient!  I really don't hear
enough of this stuff in SF, this was a real treat! :)  I couldn't stop
dancing all night, I would literally have to make myself stop so I could
rest & get water (party done without "indulging" incidentally).  Basically,
the music was so good (imho) that even after the fact that all I had eaten
the previous day was 1 muffin, and I had partied & indulged the night
before, I still kept going hard till about 6-6:30 the next morning!  Now if
music can do that alone, I'm *very* impressed! So now I've just gotta
figure out how to get the sf vibe here and the montreal music to sf! :)  I
didn't like the ambient room so much tho, like I said I swore it was hard
ambient, which wasn't what I wanted in an ambient room.  When I needed to
make myself stop dancing, & would go to the chill room, what would I
encounter but more music that'd make me dance again! Not what I was looking
for.  One thing that really sucked was having to stand out in line for 1
1/2 hours while it snowed! :(  That was really obnoxious.  Only the music
made any of the rest of the party worthwhile, & it did a fantastic job of
it, but I still definitely prefer sf parties!  They had one of those
shuttle buses too, like the Gathering.  This was nice to not have to drive
there & back, as I don't like driving in other countries cuz I don't know
the rules very well (esp since it was snowing), but apparently this is the
only way they do things as far as actually getting to the party is
concerned.  I hafta agree with Brad that it is definitely missing a certain
element of surprise & adventure when you just walk out your door, hop in a
bus, and are deposited at the rave.  No having to find map points, make any
phone calls to find where the party's gonna be, no frustrating ordeal
trying to follows incorrect directions given thru the party's voicemail,
etc.  While these things may sound negative, I still kinda enjoy having to
actually put a little work into getting to a party! Like with that Harmony
party a month ago or so, where you had to get a presale ticket which was
only to the map point, and then you could get to the party from there, this
did ensure that only people who *really* wanted to go would be there, not
just bored people who don't know what to do with their friday night, which
is what last night's rave was filled with.  People who rolled outta bed,
thought "Hmm.  Wonder what I'll do tonight. Oh there's that bus, guess I'll
go check out whatever rave that is."  Altho I do have to comment, there is
definitely a vibe at the party I went to, albeit a very different vibe from
what I'm used to.  This was the vibe of a huge crowd of people who were
*really* enjoying the music & boogying their asses off!  Even if these
people were a bunch of assholes, I still really enjoy watching other people
really enjoy themselves.  The bored people who hopped on a bus to see
what's going on sat on the sidelines looking bored, but the people on the
dance floor emitted this very powerful, kind of hard-edged vibe that I
actually enjoyed.  Makes you even more likely to get off your ass and dance
that much more.  Definitely a crunchy party.

anyway, I've blithered enough, hope to attend a nice vibey sf party soon,
but I've just gotta figure out how to get this music back to sf with me!
Anyway, see y'alls later!

Love,
Shawna


p.s.  Despite the size, an incredibly small amount of rave drek!  One point
for Montreal on that one!

I haven't heard any of that kind of music.  ("Terrordome?"  Yuck.  All of
our parties have names like Harmony, Family, United...)  Maybe the Bay Area
is an oasis - it definitely is all about peace, love, positivity and
respect out here.  But the Bondage experience did get me to
ruminating...seeing all these people glorying in darkness and evil --
everywhere was black, metal, hard hard music.  Perhaps that side needs
expression, just as the innocent child needs expression.

But expressing it in the rave atmosphere is sacriligious to me.  Negative
lyrics, I think, would just be so
jarring, so out of place.  The music induces a trance, and it has always
amazed me that there are no real lyrics, no silly superficial story being
told.  If there are words, they are things repeated, like "deeper" or "feel
the love" or some sentiment so deep, so real, so spiritual...  "Fuck you
all" just would not fit with vibe created at all!

>Just a thought. (Please don't shower me with flames about negativity...)

Now why would I do that? ;)

oh. i see. i was talking a chill room more along the lines of a separate
room with separate music. that's cool that there was one though. i didn't
venture back there because there were a bunch of gangsta types giving me
nasty looks. maybe i'm too timid.

spun wasn't on then? my apologies to spun then. someone told me he was
spinning because they just saw his name come on the screen. i guess they
were mistaken.
however, i felt the music was only average. maybe it's just because i'm used
to another sort of music. read shawna's message (via ecto) today and you'll
see what i mean. music so hard it pounds your body like a jackhammer, and
you can't help but move.

wearing roller-rink shirts.. obviously kundalini wasn't making the money off
the water. i thought it was great that no one was smoking inside! it helped
keep the air much more breathable. :)
as to the music, my point about the speakers is that it was inadequate to
only have one bank of speakers for such a large space. if you have more
speakers, you wouldn't have to blast the music as loud to reach all areas of
the location, etc.. at one point i was up close to the speakers and the
treble was painfully loud, i had to move back. most of the night the volume
level was perfect (for dancing) if you were in the front 1/3 of the building.

well, i agree. kudos to jeff and rich for putting on the event. even though
it wasn't the greatest for me, it obviously did give a great experience to
others, and that's what it's all about.

Actually, now having been to Montreal, and based on the descriptions I've
heard of other city's raves, I'd have to agree so far.  Definitely a harder
edge to it, not so light & fluffy.  Musically, I actually enjoy this, as
that same hard edge comes out into the music too, but yeah, it's not nearly
as dark in SF.

with regards to the flyer size proportion <g> the flyer is about 4"x6", and

Hi!
 I got to experience a pieceof Craig's work "Sonic outlaws" in a lecture 
at UCSC. Craig was there and gave a short lecture. Very interesting and 
his cinematic work was intrieging.

I just drove through there and back this weekend. The signs said San Luis

hey there everyone,
	Boy i5t has been a long time since I have posted here but finally 
pulled myself away from the schoolwork and my computer and decided to go 
out and see sven vath at 1015 folsom last friday...WOW, that guy really 
kickedc my but, i danced harder and faster than I have danced in a long 
while! It was such a great release, the hard pounding technoo...whew! I 
went there with a good friend of mine, we hung out and had a beer then 
once sven came on  we chilled out for a while just listening and getting 
into his groove, after a little while, he really just started pumping in 
the juice and I couldnt andnd it anymore and completely lost it and had 
the time of my life dancing until my jeans were soaked with sweat:p...
	Unfortunately, once sven weas done we couldnt make the transition 
to the slower sf house groove and we decided to call it a night...well 
that is my review I hope you enjoyed it.

FASTER FASTER! tony rose

Here is a tale of ravers in love...of a boy and girl going to a rave
together with a mutual friend...and the boy warming the girl's heart with
his floppy hat and big happy smile, and how he ran all around the party in
glee and bounced up and down on the dance floor...and the two then going to
Sunset, and Mad, and Chrysalis...of sitting in a car the morning after for
four hours, still soaked in sweat and covered in sparkles, discovering that
the love they shared for raving was based on their deepest personal beliefs
and experiences, and the bond that created between them...of touching each
other for the first time with Orbital playing softly in the background...of
knowing that they found each other because of the openness of their hearts
and the willingness to give love a chance...

Yeah, I too thought the visuals were really amazing Thursday nite. How many

Television Access is

I think it would be severely cool if that kind of visual-collage thing
happened at a rave party....

Negativland fans might also be interested in Phineas Narco's email tape
catalog.  He has a big selection of Over the Edge recordings (The
Experience remix, two tapes devoted to Hendrix, is fantastic), the U2
stuff, and various other things (lots of stuff from the KPFA SubGenius
Show, if you're into that).  Send mail to phin@west.darkside.com.

Friday:  With greatest disappointment that we would not spend the evening
at Harmony, we did the usual: co-op party in Berkeley.  Heard killer ska
band; got injured in the pit (I am perversely proud of my bruises).  DJ's
spun hip-hop - I stayed out of the dance room.

Saturday: The usual, again: a party at a different co-op.  DJ spinning
happy house in a room appropriately called "the Dungeon."  Its heat and
tiny size drove us out, though we wanted to dance.  Outside a band dressed
as astronauts with capes and tin foil on their heads ground out some
noisecore as drunken punk rockers looked on and screamed.  We decided to
head out to a little private warehouse partee.

I hadn't planned on going to this get-together precisely because of the
atmospherE.  Not that I mind that type of thing at all ;), but I didn't
want to partake this particular evening and at this point I was pretty
buzzed off of a stronger substance - alcohol.  I have never mixed alcohol
and raving, and in fact have come to believe that the primary reason our
vibe is so special is the ABSENCE of alcohol.

But we went anyway, and when we got to this party the music was going OFF!
I love dancing to trance, I love dancing drunk, and this was the first time
I had both together - and it was GREAT!!  We were in a fabulous mood, the
music sounded unbelievably intense, and we danced and danced and danced.
My friend turned to me and yelled, "We should rave drunk!!"  Before last
night that would have been heresy, but now...?

Often I have encountered the problem of choosing between a very intensE
experience or utter sobriety.   But e's too expensive, acid lasts 24 hours,
speed's addictive, sobriety makes you sleepy...Maybe now I'll bring some
beer bottles along with my water bottles...?

Hey there Tony...  I have yet to experience the sci-fi club, however, I 
KNOW it will be 'f a s t !'  Two regulars are F-8 DJ's, trance, fast and 
sometimes hard.. no doubt, mixing in some sci-fi sounds from the 
seemingly infinite store house of movie, tv & radio soundtracks, etc.
Being a hard core science fiction lover, I can't wait...  --Maureen

I had mixed feelings about this one =3D 20 bucks :(
Well there was no bass at all. It sounded like there were pillow over the
speakers.  It just wasn't loud enough for me to get into the music.  I
thought Tony, Dan and Quest did a really good job.  I liked the effect of
the lasers in this big rink.  A little too big for a good vibe.  Everyone
was so spread out there was no interaction.  People seemed to be too far
away to make body/eye contact, which too me helps to create a good energy
between the people and a good vibe.  I met a lot of friendly people - no
sfravers though :(.  I would say there was about 700 - 1000 ppl there.
This was a good party just not a memorable one.  I don't think I want to
bay this much for a massive again untill maybe Gathering again.  Ohh yeah!
one thing that really bugged me was Bagok tribe recruting partiers for
their mailing list.  I got bombarded for an hour in the beginning by 3 guys
with clip boards =3D "Did you go to Lucky Charms, bro?" 'No' "OOH man you
missed out - It was phat.  You wanna get on our mailing list for our other
parties." 'No, sorry bro.'  "Come on, were gonna have a free party soon."
Well sorry but I will pass.  I got this solisitation for about an hour and
got really anoyed with it.  Come on, Recruting at another party. Well I
would talk mo' but I have to work.  See ya soon

Well, there was no bass at all. It sounded like there were pillow over the
speakers.  It just wasn't loud enough for me to get into the music.  This
is what we pay for and go to hear(well at least I do).  You can't book a
party next door to an apartment complex and have satisfatory sound levels
to please and move the crowd.  I thought Tony, Dan and Quest did a really
good job and I danced mostly during their sets.

I heard about a bay area underground sat 27th. called Meridian.  anyone

Forgive me if this topic has already been hashed out on sfraves, but I feel 
the
need to address this almost uniquely San Franciscan phenomenon.
     
How do people feel about those folks who cheerfully lug their drum collections 
along to just about every mid-to-large sized party, plunking themselves down 
either in the middle of the dancefloor or near the dj in order to bang out 
their own accompanying tribal rhythms for the duration of the evening?
     
As you may have guessed, I've already made up my mind on this issue and 
generally find their presence annoying for the following reasons:
     
1.  I don't like to hear every track, from acid to new york house to trance, 
turned into a "tribal remix".
     
2.  Something that I doubt any of these drummers realize is that no matter how 
skilled and precise their drumming may be, if you go about 15 - 20 feet away 
from them, the drumming sounds *completely* off rhythm from whatever the dj is 
playing, due to such factors as the echos created by high ceilings and 
concrete, the fact that there are 2 - 4 groups of speakers versus one drum 
(which is often off to side, outside the "cone of sound" described by the 
speakers).
     
3.  I understand that not every dj may feel this way, but I tend to think of a 
dj's set as *his* or *her* own personal performance.  Some djs are true 
masters
of control, able to hypnotize a crowd and then work it into a frenzy.  When 
there are other performers besides the dj, he loses that control, and unless 
they are working in synergy, the result is weak.  For the same reasons, I even 
think that it's a little rude for someone  to assume that everyone is as 
excited about  bongo drums as they are.  I mean, drums are loud; you can 
usually hear them throughout an entire party.  Would people feel the same if 
someone brought their bass guitar and amp, plugged in, and started jamming 
along, or if an aspiring vocalist brought along a microphone and amp and starte 
d their own vocal accompaniment?
     
I know there are probably some djs who would welcome it.  Derrick May, when he 
played at that party (I forget the name), brought along his own drummer.  So 
if
these freelance drummers are so eager to perform, why not approach djs or 
promoters and be a real part of everything, get hooked into a mic that goes 
through the dj's mixer so that everyone can hear their precision and skill, 
and
then after a two hour set, put down the drum and go dance or something.
     
I'm curious to hear other people's points of view on this, especially djs.
     
By the way, I honestly don't have any real hostility towards drummers or 
anything, just spouting off.

     Matt,
           I don't know if this will be of much help seeing as I'm from 
     Ireland but I have the CD single of Missing which has on it 3 other 
     dance mixes (not as good as the Todd Terry mix though).
     Ah well, at least you know it's available
     
                Good look hunting,
                                  Adam.
     
     P.S.  I'm arriving in San Fran in June so if you still haven't found 
     it by then I'm sure we can arrange something.

Hi ya'll. I was just wondering if anybody has seen the single for missing 
by Everything But The Girl on CD or tape.  I've seen the record at solid 
grooves, but I don't own a record player.  I would be so very happy if 
somebody knew where I could get a copy of this, or tell if it even exits 
on a CD single.  And if it doesn't exist, I would love to copy it if 
somebody else has the record and a record player.  Thanks.
     
Much love,
Matt

Jess-
 i've been a large sasha fan for the past four years.  i just got back fro the 
UK and i heard him a couple of times.  his style used to be more house related, 
hands-in-the-air music, mostly stuff with alot of piano breakdowns and the 
like, but like the music he has also progressed.  i've heard that essential mix 
CD myself and it's great.  
 sasha of late has been moving towards a more progressive style of music.  more 
melodic trance stuff(Brian Transeau-BT), less handbaggy, garage style music.  
personally, he's my favorite foreign DJ hands down.  if you want more sasha mix 
grooves, check out the older stuff on moonshine records.  he did one half of 
the mix on the first stress release, he also worked with another great uk dj 
named john digweed on a 3-CD mix set from the Renaissance Club, and he mixed a 
wonderful track of 3 songs on BT's album Ima.  
 has anyone else heard sasha live?  reply's would be wonderful!

Here we go again!  In my efforts to spread misinformtaion and draw flames,
I'll say fourteen to 30 days, as that's been most commonly quoted to me.
However, as I have no data to support this, I'd use it as a rough estimate
(it's best to over-estimate in this case).  Let's see what the more
informed sources have to say...

     Hi guys,
             Firstly I would like to thank you for your warm welcome,     
     my you are a friendly bunch :)
        Now, I'm not quite sure if one is supposed to answer peoples' 
     questions using the list or by mailing them directly (guidance would 
     be appreciated) so I'll answer them any:
     
     Carol; We are arriving in mid-June, all 15 of us and I'm afraid I've   
            never met you're friend Des.
     Justin; Sorry, no brother called Jon and I've never even been to       
             Montana.
     
     Now, I something to ask you guys.
        As I mentioned before, I have been DJing for the last year. My 
     friend Karl who is coming aswell is also a DJ. We have been gigging 
     for a good while and we know what we're at. I want to know what our 
     chances would be of getting slots at parties/clubs. I'm sure that we 
     have a lot of tunes that you guys would'nt have heard but I don't 
     fancy the idea of lugging my records all the way over (not to mention 
     the expense) if they are going to sit in my room for the entire 
     Summer. There is nothing I would like more than an opportunity to DJ 
     in San Fran. I reckon we could stir things up big time if we got the 
     chance.
     
                Luv.
                     Adam.

Alcohol?  Poisoning our scene?  Boooo!  Nooooo!  Please say it ain't so :(
It's so symbolic of American society, it's a wrecker of families, destroyer
of lives.  A drunk driver killed my father in a head-on collision four days
before my eighth birthday.  How I hate it!!!  And I've seen too many people
at raves trying to be cool with their beers in hand.  Security loves to
find ravers with beers, wait till they crack 'em open, and confiscate them
after just the first sips (that's what a security person told me this
weekend).  It is my strong belief that alcohol would corrupt the purity of
the scene.
Now, a little good wine, on the other hand, might be very joyous, though
harder to bring to a party...

Pass the water!

The Todd Terry remix of this song is on the CD Platinum on Black
that came out not too long ago.  As for the rest of the cd... except
for a couple bad songs, probably two thirds of it is very very good
house music.  so you might want to check it out if you can't find the
single.

take care,

Hey all,

This may seem dumb but....  how do remixes work.  Lets say I have The 
Art of Trance's song "Octopus" written by the Great Simon Berry remixed 
by the also Great Man With No Name.  Does this mean that Simon wrote a 
cool song and MWNN remixed the song.  I get the feeling that the 
remixes are released at the same time as the original's (some times).

Thanks a million!

I promised myself I wouldn't post until I got some serious work done, but
this just has to be said:

Where the hell did these guys find 400+ under-18 kids, and why the hell did
they stuff so many of them inside that hot, hot (as in heat, not "the bomb"
hot) space (is it 937 Minna?  Minna between 10th & 11th.)?  I shit you not,
they must have flyered all the high schools in the Bay area to find that
many kids willing (or not I guess) to wait an hour to go to the bathroom,
sweat profusely and pose.

Don't get me wrong, I love people of all ages (really I do), but I felt
sort of like a chaperone at a high school sweat-a-thon.  However, I just
pulled my hat down a little further and said "hella" a lot and no one
pointed and said, "Hey!  Who let in the 20 year old?!"   ;^)  I danced for
about 20 minuets and realized that it just wasn't going to work.

Fortunately a friend let me upstairs (thanks Sweety!) which was much nicer
and I stayed there for a bit and then split, weaving my way through the
bathroom line that I swear started somewhere near the sound system.

The real question is though...why was I there for an hour?

TR

P.S. Indicator #1:  If the kids working the map point weren't on speed,
I'll be missing you all this summer while I'm in Altanta on the US
Basketball team.  Eye contact was so out of the question, they had trouble
looking at Hamilton's face on my 10 spot.

;^)

Wow -- what a great story! It gave me such an awesome flashback to
those first magic moments with my girlfriend, lover, soulmate, and
life partner, Jamie. We had known each other for a couple of months
prior to last New Year's Eve. At a private rave, we, for the first
time, we touched and felt each other's warm energy.

The following weekend, at Wicked, we fell in love, drinking in each
other's pleasure. While we were on the dance floor, she revealed a
chocolate peppermint candy in her mouth, and we had the sweetest,
yummiest, most sensual kiss amidst the vibe set to the beat of Doc
Martin. It was very clear for both of us that we had surrendered our
hearts to each other very openly -- this was definitely not a
love-at-first-sight kind of thing.

And then their highs wear off and they realize that they have nothing in
common and one of them has horrible BO and the other halitosis?

No, I'm just giving you shit Nancy.  ;^)  Congratulations.  Take it slow,
the foundation of any strong relationship is a strong friendship, and both
those things take time, energy and communication.

Peace!

Another great Sunset at the Marina. It started sort of late (4ish), don't
know why. There where very few people there, even then: I thought I had gotten
the place confused or something when I walked up. People started drifting
in as the afternoon progressed and there were probably 3 or 4 hundred
by nightfall.

The music was loud enough this time. Pacific often is a little too quiet,
even for these sensitive ears, but this was juuust right. It was some sort
of undancable stuff early on (maybe this is on purpose?). Only one brave 
soul was dancing for the longest time. Finally, about 5:30, I decided
to join him just as the music changed to something a little easier to
dance to. After dark, it changed to housey dancable beat and everyone
left was out there dancing. I will let someone more knowledgable about 
out the music fill you in on DJs and all that. Before I realized it, it
was 10 o'clock, and we were still dancing. Maybe because we were all
having such a good time, maybe the daylight savings change, whatever
it was, the time snuck up on all of us, I think. 

A crack crew of us scoured the place for trash and things seemed mostly
finished up and out of there by the time I left at 10:30 or so. Still no
sign of The Man (park curfew is 10, right?). 

I was kind of low energy and this is the only thing I did this weekend,
but the vibe was in effect. If I only do one thing all week, I want it 
to be this. Thanks Pacific!

Peace Out,
Jim

Thats exactly how it werx...
The reason wy we get it at the same time is...
Prolly that this track was released and then remixed...but because it was 
done in the UK...they were sent over here at the same time.

Hello again,

Just thought I'd finaly get around to reviewing some of the records 
I've picked up recently.  All of them were scored at Frequency-8 
records on upper Haight.

Platipus Records--Volume Two :  If you haven't heard this on yet than 
you are missing out!  I could be wrong but I think we will be hearing a 
lot of music off this set in the near future.  Features PHAT tracks 
from Union Jack and The Art of Trance as well as remixes by Man With No 
Name.  10 tracks on the record, I'm not sure how many on the CD.


Eat Static--Bony Incus :  Eat Static evovlves with the times and comes 
out with Jungle and Trance at one time!  This double set which only 
cost me $13 is splendid.  Man With No Name has a remix on the trance 
record and Mucor has a remix on the Jungle one.  Excellent music 
throughout.  

Flying Rhino Records--Green Nuns of the Revolution  :  HARD ACID!!! 
This stuff sounds great at 33 or 45 but when you get it going at 45 it 
will just eat your brain away with some seriously insane Acid sounds. 

Etnica--The juggeling alchemists under the black light  :  This is 
smooth trancy mellow music perfect for chilling and trancing to.  

Dragonfly Records--Experiments that Identify Change:  pretty hard 
trancy double set featuring "jack-in-the-box" by Man With No Name.  
This song is so smoothe!

A list of other good trancy records:

Koyote records--encens

Dragonfly records--Phreaky

Symbiosis records--Trancewave

Psychic Deli records--Subcouds

Love chris

At sunsets when the  sun started going down.  House is cool but man oh 
man would I lose my head if trance was mixed in.  I left at 8 so I 
don't know if any trippy trancy stuff came on after but I get the 
feeling it was house throughout.

I love sunsets so much that it ususaly turns out to be the only party I 
go to.  Hopefuly Galen and crew will want to pick things up near the 
end and really rock out worlds with some driving psychadellia.

love chris

Hello everyone,

	Just wanted to introduce my self. I been lurking in the list for
a couple of weeks now. Moved to Oakland from LA to weeks ago. Had the
best of times with the SoCal raves people and how to do the same up here.
So far I havent found time to go to any raves but maybe I'll do so this 
next weekend for my b-day. One of the things I was scared of comming up 
north it to much house music. I am a GOA trace head what can I say. ;)
So if someone would be  nice enough and point out to me what local DJs play
GOA trace and hard trance I would be greatful. If you want to point out a 
few GOA label, artists, or cd titles that would be good to. Think I'll buy
my self some cds this weekend. Oh, BTW, do you guys have the equivalent 
to SoCal's Full Moon Gatherings? Thats one thing I will miss.

Howdy all!
I just "found" F-8 on Friday, and boy am I in heaven!!  I picked up a couple of
CD's, and got motivated to start saving for turntables!  (Can't wait!!)  Eric P.
and I each picked up a copy of Return to the Source.  I've really enjoyed this
one so far!  Others I am trying out include a great disc called The Dark Side
of the Noom.  This one's very speedy hard trance in some spots, and almost
housy on other tracks.  It was a real treat.  I can't wait to make my next trip
to S.F.!  (My first time on Haight too.  How fun!!)
	-Jeremy

Yes, the original Octopus and the MWNN remix were released as separate

Does anyone know of a good place in the South Bay area that I can actually
goto to look at some equipment that isn't radio shack or the good guys
generic brands. I have a Pro Sound catalog but there in So. Cal near LA or
someting. I don't mind looking at the picture in the catalog, but seeing
some good quality equipment is much better. I don't want to order something
for Pro Sound until I can see it first hand. After using a Numark mixer this
weekend, I want to buy a better mixer then the one I have. So, if there's a
store out this way, I'd love the info. I guess I could just take a chance
and order the one that looks good and seems to have everything I want, but I
really would like to touch it and see it in front of me first. Well enough
rambling, later.

Well, not quite worth 20$ IMO.  The music was melodramatic.  From about 1
to 3 the music would build for a few minutes then turn into sirins or stop
or something.  It was quite annoying and impossible to dance to without
getting frustrated.  But the music got increasingly better later on.

Jondabomb, those weren't karate guys-  They were playing capoeira, an
afro-brazilian martial art-- Capoeira is what originally inspired
breakdancing.

It was so wonderful to dance in a smoke-free environment.  This was the
highlight of the party for me.

Howdy all!
After being an avid fan of all techno for a couple of years now, I've been 
bitten by the DJ bug....So, as soon as I can rustle up the $$ I'd like to
invest in a small setup.  The only problem is, lacking the experience!  What
kinds of things should I look for in a mixer?  I know the more $$ you shell
out the fancier things get, but what options are really necessary, and what
are just nice to have?  I've seen Technics' turntables, and seems like, they'd
do just fine, of course, $600 is a little steep.  I think PSSL is about $100
cheaperd...Anyways, any info/advice people could relay would be greatly appreciated!
	Thanks!! :^)

Awwhhh, yeah!  I thought his set was EXCELLENT!  I expected a mixed 
crowd, and found one, but I was able to find nice pockets of people who 
were seriously rockin' out.  Kudos, once again, to the Spundae family for 
bringing us the outside flava.  Though not perfect, 1015 is a much 
better venue to hold special events than the Soundfactory (greater 
sneaker:gold-chain ratio:).

Kirsten,

        Thanks so much for your thoughtful response.  You are an amazing
person!  You reminded me of something of which I am deeply ashamed, and I
wanted to share it with you, and with everyone else, since you've made this
public.
        When my younger sister Wendi was becoming a young woman (we're five
years apart), she listened to my ignorant, narrow-minded, teenage boy ideas
of what was beautiful in a woman.  She has brown hair, and heard my MANY
offhand comments that blond hair was the best.  She would hear my comments
about what was and was not attractive in a woman's figure, make-up, etc.
So, she spent lots of time and went to lots of trouble to try to make
herself "more beautiful", unfortunately following what her big brother
thought.  She really believed that she wasn't beautiful, just because she
didn't fit my distorted vision.
        Wendi confided this all to me recently, and it nearly broke my
heart.  She arrived at a point herself along the way where she became more
comfortable with her natural self (as all people should, IMHO).  It has
occured to me that what I did helped to propagate the ignorant,
narrow-minded view that many people have of what constitutes beauty, and
that disgusts me, so I hereby apologize to everyone for being part of that.
I want it known that I love and accept everyone just the way they are, and
focus far more on someone's inner beauty than on the wrapper.  Thank you
for your attention.

Most humbly yours,

- E

you read it right 1st room djs from the Cloud Factory ->
	cloud, swoops, and supermonk
and in the second room ->
	flux, rich, shoam, benji, bonnie and tim mcknew (cloudfactory)

I've met the person organizing this event and it should be a nice one, 
although I'm slightly biased about the djs =)

u are very right about not all scenes globally being all love and 
happiness.  what i have discovered in my expeiences with the "rave scene" 
is that the further west u go, the nicer it gets.  not necesarilly better 
or worse, just nicer.  it depends on what u are looking for.  do u want 
hardcore intensity with a little bit of a chill?  go north.  how about 
everybody free dancing, but not really interacting with too many others 
that they don't know too well?  midwest.  and from what i can see here on 
sf raves, if u want a family unity and love style, go west.  it's all a 
matter of taste, or mood maybe.

just some thoughts....

luvz and sunshine,

sarah f.

Yeah Wayne, I missed ya buddy! :(
It was held in Berkeley Marina on the other side of the hill.  It was 
BEAUTIFUL! :):) Incidently, I loved the music.  Those English dj's whose 
names escape me now did a good job.  Perfect music for the atmosphere and 
setting.  I had to leave at 8 becuase I had a long drive back to 
Sacramento ahead of me and i was tired.  Looking forward to the next one, 
as always.  I can't wait to LIVE there!!

love,
Amy

Actually, I like the Acme myself, the two parties I went to there
(chrysalis & harmon) were amazing.  There's really two aspects of the acme,
how it's set up for the party, and the safety/heat issue.  For a party set
up, I think it's great, cause it has all those different rooms.  This way,
even with 900 people, every time you go into a room, there's a little rave
going on in it, rather than 900 people all in one huge room.  That way you
end up with several small vibey parties all interconnected into one big
party, and you can choose any one you want.  Also, every time I've been at
the Acme, they've decorated it absolutely beautifully!  Both chrysalis &
Harmony were gorgeous! :)  For these reasons, I find it tragic that it's
such an unsafe place and so overheated, along with owner problems, of
course.  I hope they can find another place with those qualities I really
dug about the acme without all the problems.  (altho oddly, I remember that
at chrysalis, I got so cold I had to put on a jacket. (!?)  Now if it's
possible to get that cold at the Acme, how is it they could never get it
that well ventilated other times?)

Well I bought my tables used for $700.  And an MTX MX-35 mixer new. All
together about $840.  I suggest not getting the MX-35 I have had trouble
with the crossfader since I've had it.  Its on its second crossfader, and
thats already bleeding and getting scratchy.  I don't know about other MTX
mixers, but this one bites.  I'm saving up for a RANE MP-24. =)
If your just learning you don't need no sampler/effects/laser/fog machine
on your mixer.  Just go simple but get quality!

Late,

Subject: out-a-sight: a positive spin?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


I guess I was the only person who had a great time at out-a-sight friday
night.  Sure, the space was hot and overcrowded, but I still managed to find
plenty of room near the front to dance.  One thing that usually drives me
crazy
at larger spaces with two or more rooms is that inevitably the main dance
floor
will lie in the direct path of some other destination such as the bathrooms or
the chillout rooms, so people are constantly plowing through the dance floor
to
get somewhere else.  That at least was absent at this party, since the dance
floor was at the far end of the space, farthest away from the entrance.
Personally, I thought the vibe was great; I met lots of people and saw lots of
smiles.  I think it was because everyone I ran into was on E, but you can't
really fault that.

Yes I was drenched with sweat all night, but that didn't stop me from
thoroughly enjoying terrific sets from Jeno, that guy from Philly, and Spun
(the beginning anyway).  Am I the only one who actually gets some pleasure out
of extreme physical exertion?

And this whole age thing is so ridiculous.  I've met asshole 16 year olds,
asshole 18 year olds, asshole 21 year olds, asshole 30 year olds, asshole 40
year olds, etc.  In my grand and elevated wisdom as someone who has survived
his teenage years, I conclude that age doesn't correspond to anything.  The
only thing that age seems to bestow upon people on this list is further
disenchantment with the rave scene.  A party is only as good as you make it,
no
matter what.  File this one under taking more personal responsibility.

Youth is wasted on the young?

Good parties are wasted on spoiled San Franciscans?

Don't make it true!

As usual, take this post as nothing more than my monday morning catharsis.

The doors, the number of people and fans.  Fans and number of people are
rather obvious, in that you need several big ones of the first, and lots of
little ones of the second ;^) (a little short joke there).  As for the
doors, it's hard to keep the small door open, when working the
line/entrance and stuff, sometimes the garage door can be opened, but
usually later in the party.  You being cold was most likely due to the
garage door being opened a bit.

It's a little out of the organizers control (especially when there are lots
of people in da house), much like the dance studio at 24th and Mission,
though they are working on better ventilation there.  Acme is moot at this
point, right?

Yeah Todd, I've heard Sasha a couple of times. I've never really
been all THAT fond of him, and he sure isn't the best "foreign"
DJ there is. (one of my favorites happens to be a certain German
DJ whom I did NOT get to see/hear last week due to a major 
problem...my age!) But all that is of course, a matter of personal
taste. *smile* I have to say though, the work he's done with BT is
great, and so is some of his own material. =)

Well, I guess that's all this lurker has to say for now! =)

That's nice that that actually could happen!  I do the above-described like
*all* the time, but it never seems to have anything to do with love in that
respect (like "in-love" kinda love).  Hmm.

Yeah Todd, I've heard Sasha a couple of times. I've never really
been all THAT fond of him, and he sure isn't the best "foreign"
DJ there is. (one of my favorites happens to be a certain German
DJ whom I did NOT get to see/hear last week due to a major 
problem...my age!) But all that is of course, a matter of personal
taste. *smile* I have to say though, the work he's done with BT is
great, and so is some of his own material. =)

Well, I guess that's all this lurker has to say for now! =)

Oh, the visuals!  Now they fucking rocked.  Very cool film projections were
being shown on the far wall, the whole wall, with a rotating color wheel
behind them lighting them up, making it look like a really cool sort of
moving trippy PhotoShopped design.  I was lucky enough to check his
equipment out and I was trippin' on the fact that he had film going from
one machine to the other unprotected and looped a couple feet down a wall.

You're right, and there wasn't a "thing" that I was trying to start.  I was
remarking on just how many younger individuals that were there.  In no way
would I ever want to project the image that the FACT that it was made up of
many younger ravers (and non-ravers alike) would have anything ANYTHING to
do with the vibe.  I didn't even say the vibe was bad (in a general sense,
for me it was too crowded and hot to get into MY vibe).  I firmly believe
that all the things I saw that were trouble spots with this party were in
the sheer number of people, and I've shared email with Stephanie about it
and hopefully, we are communicating clearly and honestly.

Please let this server as email nipping that thread in the butt.  Er, I
mean bud ;^)

To know me is to know that I feel raving, parties and the positive energy
we have to share should be spread to any memebr of our society that is
willing to accept it.  Young, old, I have raved with them all and loved
most every minute of it.  In fact, I was remarking to more than one person
(both ravers and non-ravers alike) about the amazing number of (amazing)
children (read: 5 year olds) at Sunset and how I love to see that.  Not
only are they honest ("You have no hair!"), cute, cuddly, funny, and fun to
play with, they help let people know that we are not some vagabond group of
drugs fiends, but rather made up of families, friends, and are responsible
contribting beautiful people that have much love to offer.

Peace Ya'll

Thanks everyone who gave me the info on where I could find the song 
Missing.  I ended up getting it on the Platinum on Black Vol. 2 
compilation disk.  I didn't find the single and the few record stores 
in Santa Cruz couldn't order it.  O' well, I like almost all of the other 
songs on the POBV2 anyways.  Well thanks again for your help.

Love,

	Hi all!

	As promised a few weeks ago, there is now a French raver in the 
	City! ;-)
	Many thanks to all the cool guys who welcomed me even before my 
	physical arrival, it was very nice from you--thank you Matthew, 
	Eric, Timothy, Robert and Milton!

	Well, I have to say that I'm not disappointed... WOW, SF's *great*!
	It's incredibly changing and diversified--cross a street, and you
	have travelled from Pekin to NY! SF is the only city where the
	streets are 4000kms large :-)

	So, be ready to see a tall, brown guy with orange trousers in
	your parties; give a "hi" if you see me--I'll try to hack an "SFR"
	t-shirt for wearing at parties, but I still have to find time to 
	do it...

	I'm now housing in center-SF, near Civic Center (Market @ 8th), so
	if some of you are in the neighborhood, mail me! (no phone yet,
	sorry).

	See you all,

--

Hi!
 I tend to disagree with Eric on the drinking issue despite the fact that 
alcohol was a contributing factor to my fathers death (when I was sweet 
16 ;) ), and a direct cause of my grandmothers death (whom I was very 
close to) just a couple of years ago. Also my sister has a drinking 
problem which cause's her to give her boyfriend fat lips and scare our 
mother. And I basically don't like the stuff that much (I average about 
2 beers a month and a shot of tequilla once every 2-3 months)
 However I do not feel it is the drug that is the problem but the 
motivation for drinking and self control of the individual. Under the 
proper conditions, for certain people, booze can be a transcendent 
element of one's experience. Let's stop blaming the things we create for 
ourselves and take responsibility (and control) of our own personal 
experiences.

Hiya Guys!

It's been a few months since I had to unsub from sfraves and I have to tell
you it's good to be back and feel the warmth of the SF spirit.  I've been
gone for so long, probably a brief re-introduction is in order.

I am a musician/dj in Austin, Tx and I've been raving since 92.  What
brought me to raving was the music, what kept me coming back was the people. 
Never before in my life had I felt so free, content, loved, and complete
than in a rave environment, and all this from people who didn't even know
me. :)  But the scene in Texas was really not much compared to what you guys
have, but it was still better than anything I'd ever seen.

Finally, a friend of mine started Txraves and our small family grew and
grew.  We would have pre-parties for raves with 40+ people, all from the
net, many meeting for the first time.  It was such wonderful bliss.  The
scene grew and grew til we were having parties with thousands, not hundreds. 
Then there were those few parties that were just out to cash in on trusting,
innocent, adventurous souls and people began to mistrust what was happening. 

Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect were replaced by Cynicism, Apathy, Mistrust,
and Fear.  (CAMF!  Heh heh.  Anyway...:) ...Txraves soon began to mirror
this trend until finally it became everything that I started raving to get
away from in the first place.  COMPLETE lack of respect was the norm.  I
began to see posts with subject lines like "F*** YOU (person's name
here)!!!"  I never once tried to shake the notion of "PLUR" in anyone's
face, in fact, it became so bad that if you mentioned PLUR, some people
would post to the list that PLUR is a bag of sh**, and anyone who believes
in that crap is a fool.  I hated to leave.  I had stuck through literally 
dozens of ugly, ugly flame wars trying to hold my family together, but that
fight was just making me miserable.

So now I am reaching back out.  I have kept my closest friends and anyone
else who still had a desire to love and live life as one of the happy
people. :)  As it stands now, our closeknit group has taken it back
underground and is keeping to smaller parties (which I prefer most of the
time anyway.)  I believe too much of anything can be a bad thing.

Anyway, I've missed the openness that you guys share here.  I got used to
closing myself off from the world just trying to avoid those people who are
looking for *anything* to start a scuffle.  I just couldn't live like that
anymore.

Sorry this has been so long.  I didn't intend this to be therapy, but thank
you for listening anyway.  My purpose in sharing all this, was not to be
depressing... I just wanted you guys to know how special you are, not that I
feel like you needed me to tell you that. :)

I found a lonely pair of sunglasses at Sunset on Sunday 4/14. Almost 
stepped on them in the dark actually. If anyone is missing them email a 
discription and we'll reunite you with your shades.

Gad, I'm a blabbermouth!  I didn't even get around to why I was posting in
the first place!

I've got my first out-o-state gig coming up in June and some of the guys I'm
sharing the bill with are from the bay area.  I thought I'd check and see if
anyone can give me some info on them as far as their style and such, just
because I'm curious. :P  They are Kenneth Paul (SF) and Jordan (Fresno).

Thanks in advance, and again, it's great to be back!

Dear Randy:

I agree with you.  Addiction can be to anything.  Abusive
behavior runs through my family as well; however, unlike how it seems  in
your family, the addictions have ranged from cleaning to drugs to alcohol
to food to sex.  Pretty exhaustive heh.  We shouldn't criticize the use of
alcohol in the scene, only if it destroys the vibe.  However, I would
qualify the statement by saying that in my observation, the type of person
who has used drinking in the scene vs. other things or nothing has usually
not been the person I would hang with.  Too voyeuristic or detached from
the vibe for my tastes.  Only my opinion. ;)

In reply to Michael's message, I have to say that getting the most out of
rave is our personal responsibilty as long as the promoters have created a
safe and welcoming environment.  The people who attend raves do need
somerthing to work with when trying to enjoy a personal experiance.

Cassandra

P.S. On the question of age, a group of my friends and I were discussing
the age at which someone should be introduced to consciousness altering
drugs.  One conclusion seemed to be that under 21 or even 25 was too young
because one's identity was not developed enough yet to derive the right
lessons from the experience.  What do you think?

Hi!
 Welcome back! Your perseverance was (I'm sure) gratefully felt by some 
and I know you touched some lives. The effort to create PLUR sometimes 
has to take 'baby steps'.

Hi!
 Thanks for your input Cassandra! As usual you have some clear, insightful 
things to add. I'm sorry that your family also suffers from abuses but that 
seems to be the norm for most people =( Which makes what we accomplish 
through raving and sfraves all the more important. Please believe me when 
I say that we are moving some sociological mountains here today!!

--------SVEN -------

Just had to add another note of how over-the-top Sven Vath's set was Fri at
Nikita. Except I can't find words to describe it! I had high expectations
after seing him salvage an otherwise abysmal ENIT festival at the Warfield
last August (high expectations can sometimes lead to dissappointment), but
the music and the vibe (at least near the front) were so much more than I
anticipated, I'm still digesting it.  Definately on my top 10 list! If you
were able to watch him you could see he was enjoying the evening as much or
more than everyone else.  It's great to see a DJ enjoying his job.
Hopefully he'll come back soon and do one of his famous 12hr sets (3 hrs
just left us wanting more). Thanks Spundae for great music (as always).

Did anyone go down and see him in LA Sat?

Did anyone else enjoy the visuals as much as I did? The Dimension 7 group
seems to outdo themselves each week at Nikita.  The giant balloons with the
projections seeming to come out from inside of them were sooo trippy..and
the laser with cool shapes and pictures were fun to watch (love the alien
face, the globe, and the messages that flash almost subliminally...was that
an ad for Progress?) I kept switching my attention between Sven and the
sights up above (those are the kind of dilemmas I can live with).  Keep up
the good work!

I'll remember this one a long time..... jd         :)   :)    :)

hey all

I'm back from my trip, and I have one question:  has anybody here heard 
of a track called Birds on E, by Mike Deerborn?  Heard it on a stereo 
while in Canada, now I've gotta find a dj that'll play it in their set! 
Total mind-fuck music, gotta love it! :)

Aleph,

We are just getting into Goa trance up here...  A new record store
"Freq-8" opened up in the Upper Haight.   A lot of the people in that
record store are DJ's and in 3 weeks or so,  will be hosting an outside
rave
on the beach...  Usually about 40 - 60 people show up,   and Mars,
Mystr-E,  and ALien Life force play good trance.

Chech the SFRaves calander for details...

     Well, seems the best way to get things going is to send a tape over to 
     give you guys a listen, all I need is a kind soul to receive the tape 
     and pass it around for me.

Galen and Crew play the music that they are into since it is their party.
This is not to nock trance in any way but to be honest if you want trance
played outside under the sun you might want to organize your own outdoor
shindig, maybe you could start on the sunday's that sunset doesn't happen.

Hi everyone,
Synethetic Pleasures is coming to town with the SFIFF and lots of other
great movies.  Synthetic Pleasures should be an interesting commentary
on [modern] society.  Check out the little blurb below or the longer one
in the SFIFF catalog.  The sound track is layered with "trance and
Belgian disco" (yow what a combination!).  I'm going to the Sunday
screening with panel discussion.  Maybe I'll catch some SFravers there!!?!?!

Yeah, it has a lot to due with the individual's (in)ability to exercise
self-control; seems the more one drinks, the more control one loses, then
that person tries to believe her/himself still capable of doing routine
things, tries, and fails miserably oftentimes...it's serious business, and
should be handled seriously.

I was nineteen when I first experienced anything other than alcohol, which
my family introduced to me at about age ten, and I felt that I should have
experienced it sooner.  I think sixteen is the absolute youngest age that
someone should investigate, and then only if that person is mature and has
some understanding of her/himself within.

NO KIDDING!
Why is it that there seems to be this universal belief that you HAVE TO play
house in the daytime?   TRANCE!   TRANCE!
(breakbeat & acid would be good too)
I would go to a lot more Sunsets if the music was better!

At sunsets when the  sun started going down.  House is cool but man oh 
man would I lose my head if trance was mixed in.  I left at 8 so I 
don't know if any trippy trancy stuff came on after but I get the 
feeling it was house throughout.

I love sunsets so much that it ususaly turns out to be the only party I 
go to.  Hopefuly Galen and crew will want to pick things up near the 
end and really rock out worlds with some driving psychadellia.

love chris

I find it interesting that so many people regard house as the definitive SF
sound, and yet (especially among members of "The Crew") so many people
remark about how much they loathe it.  What's with the contradiction here?

you know I'll get flamed for this but here goes anyway......... 
 
.........trance music is cool, but.........it's not my favorite, so I don't
go where I know thats what will be played. 
 
on the other hand deep house with wailing diva's isn't to my liking either,
so I don't go where thats predominately what I'll hear......... 
 
..........I feel that if you like trance .....go to trance clubs, or create
your own trance outdoor party, but it gaulls me that here in San FRan where
we have so many choices of styles and DJ's, that people are compaining that
sunset parties etc....don't play enuff trance etc..... 
 
house music is and always will be the cornerstone of our scene.....it may
branch out into.........deep, techno, garage, acid, breakbeat, triphop,
gabber, jungle, happy hardcore, whatever........you should be so f*cking
lucky to have it ALL, we are one of the most diverse cities in the world,
and our music, and dj's reflect that........ 
 
jesus F*cking christ.......what the hell do you want....all trance all the
time.......boring, boring boring......... 
 
............just like triphop (my personal fav) all the time.....boring.
It's the variety that makes it so wonderful 
 
lets cut sunset some slack, I think it's one of the best vibes I've ever
seen. but people dis it because it's not playing "trance".........how
completely rude and insensative. 
 
I would venture to bet that those people who dis the music (within our
family) are the same people who might leave their garbage for the promoters
to pick up......no respect. 
 
.......I don't think it's all about the music, it's about the vibe that a
posse can create, and I give a round of applause to sunsets (and Galen) for
being able to pull off the parties with seemingly little hassle from the
authorities, and I feel it's about time we respect what is played.....even
if it's not our favorite "STYLE" of house........ 
 
I feel in addition that until you can respect that ALL the club and dance
music we hear is closely related (like a distant cousin) to the ORIGINAL
house music that came out of chigago back in the day.........it was gay
blacks making music for gay black audiences, and until a DJ can understand
and respect that aspect of history, you can not fully appreciate any kind
of music that is rave related.......a dj must understand what they are
playing and why............and fully respect the background and evolution
that brought us to styles like "trance" 
 
this is why guys like Garth, Jeno, Doc Martin, Markie Mark, and Thomas has
been around for so long, (yes they can all spin incredible sets) but if you
notice, they all have that cornerstone and understanding in their
music.......they have never abandaned the original history, and play to an
audience's sense of history...... 
 
........even I have had trouble understanding the vibe, and the styles, and
how I can manipulate the stuff, that only I like.  It has taken years to
respect and honor the tunes 
 
I still (in some peoples opinion) don't fully understand, and I've been a
DJ for over 10 years. maybe it will always be a growing experience, and I
will never get it, but you won't see me sitting here dissing other DJ's or
other styles of music that I may not particularily like, rather, I will
continue to buy what turns ME on. 
 
I'm lucky, as a DJ, I can program exactly the styles I like, and do. but I
would be bummed to sit here and listen to someone dis my shit because it
wasn't "trance" 
 
In short, (too late for that)........I would love to see more people take
charge of there own destiny and create a party that plays trance, rather
than dis someone elses succesful attemt to bring you the vibe as they see
fit...........(aka sunsets) 
 
in addition we are all different ages and at different places in our life,
and have different values and priorities, we have different reasons why we
like this or that,  
it's ok to like one style of house and not another, it's not ok to dis the
creators of a happy vibe.........more power to the sunset parties and more
power to you as an individual 
 
just imagine if we all liked the same thing how boring this world would
be........all the Dj's would still be playing elvis presley or big band,
etc.......evolution and diversity are the very freedom that allow us to
express ourselves as DJ's.......... 
 
i will stop my ramblings here, and I truly don't know (other than crunchy
dude) who is dissin the non trance vibe, but take a look at the bigger
picture............trance is merely another hybrid of house......wouldn't
it be boring to only hear trance all day and night everyday and
everynite......just as house can be boring all day long everyday etc.....it
is the variety that makes it so interesting.........and in SF you are lucky
to have a major variety of styles to pick from...............as well as
some of the best DJ's in the world who bring it to you.......be happy and
respect a posse for what it is.....not what it isn't

OK y'all, before youse start the flame war on moonpup, think about the
message behind the words, and realize also that he's brainstorming here.
That's what we all need if we want to shake things up and bring some
freshness to the scene, if that's what's needed.  I agree that the
diversity of our community calls for more diversity in music, parties, life
and love.  We can have it all if we want, so let's take it, let's make it
happen!
Even I make sure I listen to at least one song per day that isn't by Slayer
(hahaha!).  Yes, that was humor, but you see my point?  :)

Live long and prosper,

different strokes for different folkes...

Basically in SF, HOUSE RULES, and this has pretty much always been the
case. Over the last couple of years things have diversified a bit (a good
thing imo), and now there are lots of alternatives for the non-house
crowd.  But as far as a "definitive SF sound", I don't think there is one. 
There's something for everyone, if you can't find it you probably just
need to look a little harder... 

The SF scene everyone knows and loves was built on House music, sometimes
I think people forget that.  Granted House isn't for everyone, but even
those people should understand and respect the enormous influence it has
had on the scene and "the vibe" in SF. Personally, I wouldn't want it any
other way...

Two unrelated topics in one concise post:

Sven Vath was outrrrrrrageous and 1015 looked amazing last saturday.  
Good visual, good vibe, danced with some lovely people.  However, the 
mixed crowd was weird for me.  It was strange to see people swaying to 
techno with margaritas in their hands.  I agree with others that it isn't 
the alcohol itself which changes the vibe, rather the people that tend to 
abuse it.

Phelan.  Who heard phelan spin at Aborigine (acme..) a few weeks ago.  I 
had a really good time dancing to his funky style but I'd never heard of 
him before or since.   Who is he?  Where does he DJ?

I find it ironic that Sven Vath played in the Bay Area while i was in 
Montreal, and he is about to go play in Montreal in a week or two while 
I'm in the Bay Area!  Go figure...

Miguel Fierro (Single Cell Orchestra) did some of the soundtrack to this

Yep, moonpup, you'll get flamed for your ranting about trance etc....

but I have to agree with your points here ...  it's pretty amazing how spoiled
we all get! I'm catching myself getting more and more picky about music, and I
don't know how to move myself into a more open perspective, rather than a more
specific and refined taste....

... because when we limit our expectations, we miss a lot of good stuff...

.. many of you know I'm a big house-head --- I went to Club Universe last week
(yep, crazy cruisy gay club) because Little Louie Vega was spinning -- it was
four hours of the most wonderful, deep, funky, dance your butt off music --
awesome and totally a blast... 

... but I also go to occasional trance parties, partly because so many people I
like love trance, so I get to spend time with them, and I'm trying to open
myself up to appreciate the beat and energy of trance....

... and I'm trying to educate myself about other new kinds of music, too ..
because bottom line, I love music and what it does to me!

Yes, I know the feeling when you yearn for a different sound in the music... but
I have to agree about leaving the Sunset crew to create the party they want,
when they want, where they want ... and let them play the music that they feel
like playing at that moment!  The boat cruise showed the great repertoire of
styles they are happy to offer for our enjoyment, given the option of multiple
rooms ... but frankly, I'd much rather enjoy the gift they give us with their
outdoor parties!  Thank you Sunset!

hey all,

i have a humorous bit of prose for you all:

i work for a small DJ company that books lots of weddings, class reunions,
school dances, and the like.kinda boring because there is just a formula
to follow really when dj'ing those kind of parties. anyway.....

i called the owner today from my college dorm room. i told him i still wanted
to work for him this summer. he said great.  (this guy;s about late 30's)
he said "good news!  i went out and bought a 7000 watt JBL sound system
recently, also 55 feet of trussing for lights and a new array of intelligent
lighting."

i said, "that's wonderful, the business is really on the up and up!"

then he sorta whispers into the phone..." i was wondering if you would like
to do some semi-legal raves this summer when you come back."

*hahahahaha*

i chuckled, and said it sounded like a good idea. problem is, this man
has never been to a rave, he only believes they make tons of cash.
he is the nicest guy in the world but, if you were me, would you support
someone who doesn't understand.  his concept of a rave from what he's
told me is a teeny bopper dance party. i think i'd puke if i saw that.

well. good story huh?
(ugh, that kinda bombed........)


later all,

well, my first experience with any drugs was 16, and they were all 
presented to me w/in a matter of 6 months.  i don't know if this was 
"good" or "bad" for my personal growth, but i wouldnt trade any of those 
first experiences, or any of the many that have followed for 
anything--not even a truckload of fruity pebbles!:)

i guess it just happens when it's suppossed 2 happen.  i know people who 
stared at 13!!  so, thats my 2 cents...

I could have sworn we went through this crap last month. Sunset is great
"IMO"  Galen and the others are doing what they like to do. It is house
music. If people want to have Trance, gabber, ambient, jungle or whatever
then they should get everyone that has the same taste in music together and
throw there own parties. Why keep bringing up the Trance issue about Sunset?
Don't get me wrong, I like Trance myself, I actually have be spinning Trance
now for 5-6 months, but I also like House as well. Which I'm starting to get
more into and even spinning it alittle. Do you goto Wicked and complain that
they don't spin Jungle or Gabber? Wicked, correct me if I'm wrong, is about
house music. That's what they chose to spin and that what they choose to
spin at Sunset. So, if you want to hear YOUR favorite style of music, get
together with others and throw your own party.

Like the old saying goes, "You can please some of the people some of the
time, but you can't please all of the people all of the time."

    Why do you think we loathe house?  I event mentioned that I like 
house, infact, I LOVE HOUSE.  Espicialy with deep grooves and jazzy 
pianos.  The point is we are wishing that there was more variety of 
music at what happens to be the best weekly event in San Francisco.  
Personaly I'm just hoping for trippy music.  Be it Acid, Trance, House, 
Break-Beat or whatever.  

People say, Start your own party or go to another one.  That's great.  
I will be going to F-8 events when I can.  But I happen to love 
Sunsets.  I've been going for two years and will continue to go this 
summer.  I was just commenting that I would have more fun and dance 
more if the music was more psychadelic.  

love chris

Who denies that?  I think you read way too much into peoples comments.  
Do we not have the right to want to hear psychadelic music at sunsets?  
Hell, I drive out from Sacramento every sunday to be part of the party. 
If they play House and only house than that is my loss. I will still

Exactly!  People our commenting on wanting more trance at sunsets 
because there is no variety!  It's plain house and more house.

Sunset is the best vibe I've seen.  It is consistently an excellent 
vibe.  I love sunset so much that we go and party even though they just 
play house.  check yourself.  I happen to pick up all my trash and 
other people's shit as well. And as far as I can tell I must be one of 
those people you mentioned who "dis" the music.

Who Dissed anyone???  Why do you think we are dissing on house?  Just 
because people commented on wanting to hear more trancy music doesn't 
mean we don't like house.  It's all good.  I feel lucky to like all 
styles of house from straight house to pschadelic trance.   

.trance is merely another hybrid of house......wouldn't

Oh, I know not everyone dislikes house, but I'm just surprised when I hear
anyone expressing dislike for it, whether pertaining to a certain
environment, or to the form in general.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised,
and think of it the same way I think about more "popular" music: it's not
so much a regional thing as a matter of personal preference.
So, is the SF area moving away from focusing on house?  Was that ever
really the dominant form in this area, or was it just more exposed at a
certain point in time?

All good,

I would:

1) say "great! a semi-legal rave sounds like oodles of wholesome fun!"

2) take over all operations and planning while keeping your boss around as
an easy cash/equipment source.

3) Hire me to do a flyer (BSP! BSP!)

4) throw a ragin' party that establishes you as the
promoter-du-jour-and-beyond in the midwest

5) wake up and say "hmmm, what a nice dream that was. now back to the day job."

just my $.02...

but seriously, if someone has no idea what a rave _should_ be like, we end
up with ridiculous fiascos like LuckY Charms or Cyberfest...

I think there's something wrong with me...  I like house music, trancy harder 
house is o.k. but not hard trance sets. I guess I just don't get it.  I like 
sunny days like last Saturday in the SF Persidio with happy dancin' people, 
friends, and conveniently located facilities.  I'm noticing that I don't make it 
through the whole night that often anymore but I still dance pretty hard whenever 
and wherever I go.  It doesn't freak me out to have to go to a club to hear a 
famous DJ nor that they serve ALCOHOL in such a club.  Heck, now that I think 
about it I think that given the choice I'd rather run into one of those Julio 
Iglesias no shirt with a jacket cocktail swillin' weirdos at a club at midnight 
rather than a speaker column speed freak with that far away look that can't stop 
at sunrise even though he wishes he could guys at a rave. Second thought they 
both pretty much suck but that doesn't make the music or MY vibe any different.  
I like running with my dog across the waterfront with a killer acidy house tape 
groovin' through my bones thinkin' how great it is to live here.  My dog loves 
house too I swear.  I'm happy that I make money finally and that I make it doing 
something that I like to do.  Hell I'm proud that I've been able to do both! That 
I took that shower and cruised into work the next morning and endured the torture 
rather than blow the day off and yet another opportunity. Heck, I like a lot of 
stuff!  

But I think there's something wrong with me...
  
Am I an SFRaver still or just a happy San Francisco raver?  Lately, it seems like 
the two are mutually exclusive. Maybe it's just me. Not quite sure if that makes 
any sense.

There's nothing wrong with you!  You can be both.  There is no
hard-and-fast definition of an sfraver; possibly the only thing that all of
us have in common (besides being human...maybe?) is our interest in coming
together at these parties, because each person's approach and taste is
unique.  To make a tired expression more tired, it's all good!

Peace out,

	I doubt this is the case because the two do not go hand in hand. 
After cleaning up after numerous sunsets, and watching the garbage that 
is left, way the garbage is I can make a few observations but none of 
them relate people saying that they would like to hear some trance on 
Sunday to leaving garbage. If people are coming out for the party even 
though they don't like the music, but instead to come see people, I would 
venture to say they are going to be a little more responsible for their 
trash as they are coming for a gathering of people instead of to party 
(see, its just as easy to draw the opposite conclusion based on the 
evidence at hand). I happen to find that a hell of a lot of trash comes 
from the picnic tables, from the trendy looking people's blankets (ok, 
that's a blanket statement and I probably offended a few, and I am sorry 
to those of you who don't litter and have the trendy fashion). I wouldn't 
mind hearing trance at sunset or even gabber when the sun went down I 
wouldn't even mind spinning that gabber (though the transition might be a 
little difficult). Now I have "dissed" Galen and the whole Pacific crew 
somehow because I have said I would like to hear something besides house 
I assume, but as many people can verify, I don't litter (anymore).

	Well, then, I think a DJ  had better understand disco and the early 
techno-pop... In fact, she or he better go back in time to experience it 
because one cannot get a full understanding unless they experience. 
Seriously though. Each DJ can spin whatever they want, and it is because 
we each take our own understandings and misunderstanding and wonderings 
and the like that each of us a different style. I don't spin house, and 
the vibe it tends to produce is one I like in the morning or at someplace 
where I am not going to dance because house does not bring out any forms 
of the energy that makes me move and why should I force myself to move? 
I don't see why Chris cannot ask if Pacific will vary their format, 
though I don't know if anyone from Pacific is on here so this may not be 
the correct place to ask. If Pacific does not want to have anyone play 
trance, it is their right. If they don't mind a second small system, then 
maybe I will talk to people about dragging a second on out. So that we 
can remain as a community all gathering on Sundays (eek... That is almost 
religious) but there will be something for everyone...

	I would still like to see multi-system parties with a 
house/trance area and a harder jungle and gabber area... I just need 
people to give the hard hard music a chance in the right environment...

	Ok, here comes that whole, if you don't like the music, throw yer 
own party... And guess what, that does not work! Because it is too much 
of a shock to people here in SF it seems, to have both a new group of 
people throwing parties and a new style of music - ie, I could not come 
out and throw a party with gabber at peak hour AND have my brand new 
system pounding out tunes under a brand new name. It takes a lot of 
people to support some types of music, and you need an entry point to 
have lots of people. People who throw parties tend to not want to throw 
harder music out here because they don't know if the crowd will take it. 
So you are caught in a loop...

	Hmmm, SF does not seem to have this great variety ingrained too 
well. I have yet to go to a party besides Freinds and Family that has 
everything from house to gabber to electro... I have yet to go to a party 
in SF which ever has gabber and house in the main room in one night. SF 
has variety but it is not integrated and moving toward intregation at 
parties is something I would like to see, even if it at first it is with 
separate systems at the same party.
	And how do people work out what they want it to be WITHOUT saying 
things like "I wish sunset had some trance". If we all shut up and didn't 
say what bothered us, the scence would never progress and we would all be 
raver slaves with no input and soon, raves in SF would be house 
concerts... Well, that might be a bit of an exaggeration...

	For many of us out here, raves are definitely not Disneyland. I 
know for myself and some of my friends, raves bring out a primal, 
primitive energy which is the same energy that comes out during some sex, 
though I must say the energy is not transfers as such, but it is what 
keeps us going through the night. It is a force that drives us to dance, 
a force which wells deep inside and makes a most intense experience. The 
faster, harder techno tends to bring this out the best, though if it is 
diluted with someone yelling "fuck you" or random swears it would really 
kill the effect. Its like this group release of the primal energy that we 
all have building inside somewhere. I think the last time I saw this was 
during Minor Minor's set way back in December at Chrylisis...

	There was this sound system in Edinburgh (ok I will make this 
quick) called Sativa that did a fortnightly club and some free festis 
(with a few other systems). In their club, for ~6 hours each Friday 
night, they ventured with you into that space and ended by 6 or 7 
drummers coming into the music and drumming on big bass drums, toms, a 
keg, and whistling, etc while the crowd gathered in closer and tighter 
and kept dancing....

	Imagine that vibe on the dancefloor and the sf vibe in the chill
room, a great union of two worlds... And if we could get the bored people
(assuming they are bored and just not taking a break) into it, we would 
have a most wonderful situation...

ROHYPNOL

      1.  You DON'T need to take it with alcohol for the effects to work
      2.  It doesn't take 1-2 hours for it to take effect...only 10 minutes

RAPISTS SLIPPING VICTIMS MODERN-DAY MICKEYS

CHEAP PILL BLOTS OUT MEMORY OF CRIMES

MIAMI-Imagine all the fears of parents whose daughters have hit
dating age packed into one white pill the size of a dime.
It may be the mightiest Mickey Finn ever concocted.
And it is not the fiction of Sam Spade novels and Humphrey Bogart
movies.

These days, it costs about $3 at the high school water fountain.  It
is colorless, odorless and quickly dissolves in a can of Diet Coke.
In about 10 minutes, it creates a drunk-like effect that lasts eight
hours.  It enhances the effects of alcohol, causing loss of inhibition,
extreme sleepiness, relaxation and - perhaps worst of all for its victims -
amnesia.

The pill is made of a drug called Rohypnol (pronounced ro-hip-nol).
Your kids know them as "roofies."

  And police are concerned - particularly about roofie rape.

In Broward County, Fla., 10 men have been arrested on roofie-rape
charges in the past year.  The most recent came Feb. 1, when two brothers
and a friend were charged with repeatedly raping a 15-year-old girl after
they secretly put a roofie in her soft drink. A 26-year-old Broward County
man who pleaded guilty to roofie rape in a 1995 case - Mark Anthony Perez
of Plantation - told authorities he used it to rape as many as 40 women.
The problem has not been as prevalent in Dade County, where police
departments reported a handful of suspected sexual assaults related
to roofies in the past six months.

A 17-year-old Coral Springs girl raped Jan. 7, 1996 while she was
under the influence of roofies lost 10 hours between having dinner with
friends and waking up in a strange hotel bed.  Police are investigating a
29-year-old suspect who was at the dinner.

"Her panties were around her ankles and a condom next to her,"  said
the girl's mother.  "My daughter didn't know this guy.  She doesn't
remember a thing.  This man is a rapist and he's going around doing this
to other women," she said.  "I want people to know how dangerous this is."

"It's a big, big deal out there right now," said Bonnie Lashbrook, a
student peer counselor at Cooper City High School.  "Parents of teen-age
girls should be scared."

College officials also note a concern on college campuses.  Reported
sexual assault have increased and may be linked to Rohypnol.  Officials
estimate that this may just be the tip of the iceberg.  Since, the
victims suffer amnesia many women may have no idea that have been raped.

Rohypnol is a potent and hypnotic sedative used in some countries to
put out surgery patients.  They are prescribed as sleeping pills in
about 80 countries, but not the United States.  The emergence of the
once-obscure sedative has thrown police agencies for a loop.  Florida law
officers have seized tens of thousands of the pills in the past year.
Rohypnol is also easily available from Mexico and parts of Europe.
In one raid, the pills were packaged in vitamin bottles and labeled
in Spanish.  They were shipped from Colombia and distributed by two
suspects, said sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal.
It has proliferated to such a point that the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have
joined forces with police to have Rohypnol's status as an illegal drug
enhanced to make penalties equal to cocaine and heroin.

"It's just that we have a chance in law enforcement to get ahead of
this thing before it gets too out of control," said Cooper City police
Capt. Jim Harn, whose agency is investigating several roofie-rape cases.

The incident involving the 15-year-old from Cooper City happened in
June at a Sweet 16 party at the Merrimac Hotel on Fort Lauderdale Beach.
Charged with her rape are brothers Sidney Harmon, 19, and Scott Harmon,
17, of Pembroke Pines, and Moises Ventura, 18, of Miramar.  The Harmons'
mother has said her sons are innocent.  The Ventura family has declined
comment.  According to friends, Scott and Moises were inseparable friends
who like to start fights and cause trouble.  Sidney, who aspires to be a
paramedic, is a quiet, sensitive boy, friends say.

Erica Verriotto, 17, said she was good friends with all three boys
for over several.  "Scott was kind of a troublemaker sometimes, you
know?" she said.  "Nothing really serious.  He used to like, start fights.
You know, yell at people who cut him off in traffic and stuff." "But
Sid, no way," she said.  "trust Sid no matter what."

Cooper City detectives say several other girls have come forward
with similar stories about the group of boys, but no charges have yet
been filed.

"A lot of times the guys don't think they've done anything wrong,"
said Cooper City police Det. Kregg Lupo.  "This is not a rape in their
eyes They think if the girl is not awake or alert enough to say, `No,'
it's not rape."

Police say they were able to arrest the Harmons and Ventura
primarily because the rapes happened while the victim's best friend
watched - an eyewitness.  Another teen at the party said Scott and Moises
bragged about slipping the roofie into her soft drink.

Other roofie-rapes are more difficult to prosecute because of the
victims' loss of memory of the incident.  "It's very difficult making these
cases," said Dennis Nicewander, an  assistant state attorney in the Broward
sex-crimes unit.  "Usually these victims don't remember a thing.

"It's almost like the perfect crime,"  he said.  "Because they don't
have to worry about a witness testifying against them.  And don't think
these guys aren't figuring that out."


The drug also has the potential to make rapists out of men who
without the drug might not commit the crime, he said.
"Usually, they aren't the kind of guys who would force themselves on
someone for sex.  They seem to be the kind of guys you'd see at
happy hour with their buddies, the kind of frat-boy mentality that thinks
it's fun to get a girl drunk and have their way."

The drug also works it's way out of the human system usually within
24 hours, he said, which makes any delay by the victim a problem.
"Many of these kids start out in a compromising position to begin
with, then this happens to them and they are scared and embarrassed and
unclear as to what happened," said Stan Peacock, a Broward prosecutor.
"I have told my 17-year-old daughter never to accept a beverage of
any kind from anyone unless it is in a sealed container that she opens
herself," he said.  "Does that give you any idea how concerned I am about
it?"

I dunno about y'all, but I like the music they play at sunset! I don't
think I'd want to hear gabber in the park, thank you very much. Perhaps
at a toxic dumpsite, but not Berkeley Marina (damn, i hate
contradictions)!

Last Sunday, when those two guys from DIY were tag-teaming, I dug it
mucho, but couldn't put a label on it. Certainly not "house".

As I was hurriedly leaving at 8:40PM (arrgh -- i wanted to stay
longer!) I caught a phrase spoken by some clueless onlooker hanging out
on the sidewalk --  "I call this kind of music heavy metal techno"...
This made me laugh, because it was so completely off base.

Hi there,
     
I know most all the promoters in the area, and I am also a part of throwing 
many parties around the SF area. If you have DAT source, I'll take that, 
otherwise, send a cassette and I will make sure that people hear it!
     
ps: I tape almost all parties here on DAT, so I am already kinda known as a 
tape head around here.
     
My address is below.

Yep, sounds like my home state/city to me!

When I went back recently (two weeks ago), my brothers were telling me
about 'roofies', and how people used them.  The shit seems very widespread
in use, from recreation to assault, you can find a 'roof head'.

Only in Miami would someone come out with a new way to vicitimize people
(and I still love that place in a strange way).

# rule for living there:  Kepp your head up, eyes open, and be prepared for
anything.

(Miami seems number one for 'in your face' living).


Out,
John

Just more of the same.  There will always be someone somewhere who doesn't
lkike what is going on.  Whether it be too much house (a common complaint
here by some people), or too little house (a common complaint by some
DJ's), I've relegated myself to saying "Uh-huh" to both camps and let them
go their merry way.

I think there is plenty for everyone.  I also think some portions are
underrepresented musically (I won't even *GO* to the ethnicity; a flame war
every 2 months is about my limit), but think that if there was *really*
that much interest in a genre, if that can be easily defined, it would
start, and blossom into something  significant.

Techno? I always though FTT (Funky Techno Tribe), spun much harder shit
than other parties, I would even call it hard trance.  As for House music
(or deep house or whatever), there seems to be plenty of that as well.  The
real problem is music definition, which with house (i.e. house, garage,
techno, breakbeat, etc.) is even more difficult to define IMO.

At this point in my music appreciation, I just refer to things as
downtempo, uptempo, or use bpm's.  I have heard many a learned DJ say that
a track is 'deep house' when , to me, it is trance.  This stuff goes on and
on.  Tedious.  In the end either I like it, and buy it, or I'll pass.  I
could care less whther people call it Jungle, Jungle Sensibility, House,
Deep House, Trance, and all the flavors thereof, my rule is 'If I like it,
I'll buy it!".

Stuff I personally don't like is fast stuff (anything over 130 bpm's is
useless to me).  Yet I still like some of the Bass & Drums and plenty of
Jungle that is put out (some portions are well over 130 bpm).  Buy some of
it as well.  Music is good food.

If you like it play it, listen to it, etc.  If you don't, find someone who
is catering to your flavor and go for it.  If that still doesn't work, a
party of 10 close freinds is often good enough.  At least for me it is.

Outta here,
John

P.S.  This is the thread that will never die.  SFR list will always have
some people who don't like what is going on, or are unhappy with some
aspect of the scene.  I am no exception.  This thread though reminds me of
the BPM flamage that happens every so often.  So far though, even though
the discussion is cyclical, the flames have been kept to a min.  Is this
progress?  I'll wait and see.

Peace.

Maybe you can enlighten him to how wonderful raves can be.  Then he 
wouldn't think it's just a way to make cash.  Help him dispose of his 
erroneous ideas, eh?  Could be fun for you too because you'd get to dj 
and share your experience.  It might be a great chance for a great 
learning experience.

Why not? You never know what you might hear.
I used to be the exact same way...with house music. I used to hate it, with a passion.

Wooooah wait a second...you mean because I dont know the history of somethin, I cant 
appreciate it? Come on...not to mention...what about the arguement between Chicago 
House and Detroit Techno? Its a classic case of which came first...the chicken or the egg?
I had the opportunity (altho quite cloudy) to ask Derrick May about it when he came 
around...quite interesting. But to say House music started everything? Its a bigger picture 
than that.

I know we could get into the whole thing here...but come on...Trance a hybrid of house?
I am not starting the argument...but you sound as tho you believe all music is an arm of 
house. Techno the forfather of Trance has been around in many forms a lot longer than any 
house music has. Its a closer race here in North America...but the Detroit/Chicago argument 
will rage on forever. Right from the words of one of Techno's originators...Derrick May 
can go off forever on how Chicago has always been a rip off of Detroit. Trust me...he did :)

Dear Brian,

	I appreciate you taking the time to give me such a full 
response.  Since it is long, I will intersperse my comments with yours 
below...

My computer tells me that on Wed, 10 Apr 1996, Brian Behlendorf shared:

It may or may not be true that Susan Burke responded personally out of 
sympathy and concern for us.  Didn't she say she'd been asked to respond 
by someone else?  Also, I wouldn't be surprised if it was part of her job 
to respond to such inquiries.
	I agree that my language was strong, perhaps undeservedly so.  
But I stand by every single word of it.  While I could have communicated 
the same basic idea in a less confrontational manner, this does not 
detract from the truth of what I said.  Preventing people from enjoying 
themselves when they are hurting no one *is* a crime against humanity!

I never intended to imply a conspiracy.  I'm saying that depriving us of 
happiness is the effect that the culture of government -- in which Ms. 
Burke is presumeably a willing participant -- has created.

	This is a fair point.  Certain rules actually do follow common 
sense logic which when followed helps ensure safety.  But consider the 
reason *why* people get crammed into unsafe spaces like the Acme 
warehouse:  It is because government restrictions have made spaces in 
which to hold parties scarce, and because leaving the doors to the space 
open and allowing people to spill outside invites getting busted.  The 
Acme warehouse has a big garage door, and if this door remained open 
during parties it would alleviate much overcrowding and make the space 
safer, but that can't be because of the cops.
	Clearly having too many people in a building is unsafe, but we 
all know this, and are capable of making judgment calls for ourselves.  
There is no law against jumping around in your bathtub (as far as I 
know!) even though this activity would be extremely dangerous -- more 
people are injured in bathtubs than from accidental gunshot wounds.  But 
there doesn't need to be a law -- if you use your brain, you won't do it.

I respect the opinions of people in authority, but I recognize them for 
just that -- opinions.  Not papal decrees informed by divine wisdom, or 
mandates that I must live by, just opinions which I try to follow when I 
think they are right and disregard when I think they are wrong.
	Of course cops do not bust *every* party.  Nor do I lump all cops 
into the same category.  Some cops are clearly worse than others.  But if 
one party gets busted for not having a permit, that's one too many.

This whole thing with gangs is guilt by association.  It is punishing 
groups of people for the misdeeds of individuals, just like stereotyping 
African American males as criminals because some black males commit 
crimes.  There is no excuse for shutting down a rave due to gang activity 
nearby.  If the cops there were doing their job, they would deal with the 
individuals causing problems.  Closing down an entire party may be 
easier sometimes, but it is wrong.

	Maybe Susan and others like her will realize that they more they 
"crack down" on raves, the more people out there will agree with me.  On 
the other hand, the more the authorities loosen up, respect our right to 
party, and leave us alone, the more the rave community will tend to agree 
with you.
	So by seeing both our perspectives, and the type government 
action that reinforces each of them, perhaps she will make a decision as 
to who she would rather deal with, me or you, and then act accordingly.  
I hope she decides she'd rather have the rave community agree with you! 8)

For those of you who attended Dune....

---------------Original Message---------------
Ok everyone, I finally had the time to do a large update on the Dune 
Web Page.   Check it out for (Proffesional?) Photos from Dune, 
Reviews from Socal-Raves, ect..

I'm sorry If I didn't get your post into the review section..I had 
over 100 posts to sort through.  (It's a pretty big section with the 
few I did pick)

Also:  Could someone please forward this message to SF-Raves? 
(Quite a bit of people from SF-Raves made the trek down here for 
Dune)

Now I have to get off my butt and get those T-Shirts made.

I was goin to mention a condom, but 2 things entered my mind 
 
1.)    If I carry one it's because I believe I would need it, yet that
means I believe I'll be having sex with someone at or after a rave, and
that kind of goes against the thought process, that it's a non sexual
atmosphere. and besides....... 
 
2.)     If I carry a condom, I beleive that I will eventually need it, and
inveriably I will never need it, because I'm looking for it
(sex)..........I find when I'm thinking....."i need to take a
condom.....just in case I might get lucky",    thats when I will never get
lucky, I have condoms that I carried for months in my wallet, and never
needed them. It's like a kiss of death......something to do with the male
sexual brain disfunction 
 
then when you least expect it, (and you naturally don't have a condom),
thats when I find myself in a needy condom situation, and only because I
wasn't looking for it (sex)........it's a kind of cruel irony 
 
so my philosiphy has become.........carry a condom, never get lucky 
 
                                                                never carry
a condom, your chances improve.... 
 
does that make any sense, or am I just rambling another
thread.......moonpup

All this condom talk got me thinking...
As an RA I often get quatities of condoms from the Student Health Center 
so I can give them out to residents at STD awareness programs, etc.  
Because of this open kind of mindset about condoms, I started carrying a 
few around and would give them out to people from time-to-time...
So I guess to modify moonpup's statement:
	Carry a condom: you might not get lucky but you might be able to 
	help out the person who's chances were improved because they weren't 
	carrying one!

love, latex and life folks!

*** Reply to note of 04/17/96 13:19
FROM: Robert Brown

SUBJECT: condommania!

 In addition to a condom some lube would be handy as well.  Even if one
 doesn't "get lucky" it can be used for hand massage/rubbing.  :)

 Dispensing condoms...often (especially at gay clubs/gatherings) some
 organization is giving out free condoms/lube  (typically AIDS Awareness
 groups).  Could be a thought to consider for future events.

 Also, mentioning carrying condoms in wallets, I read at some time some
 where (there's an exact reference for you!) that this was not recommended
 as it could deteriorate the condom.  *shrug*  Might want to confirm that...
 the consequences may be unpleasant if you're using a condom in less than
 perfect condition.

 And if one is caught sans condom there are always other alternatives (safe)
 that you can do to...uh...satisfy each other. :)

 Y'all have (safe) fun now!
  :-)

moonpup said...
	so my philosiphy has become.........carry a condom, never get
lucky --- never carry a condom, your chances improve.... 


I hear what you're saying moonpup -- but here are a couple of other thoughts...

1.  I agree that sex really isn't part of the rave scene (exept for those who
occasionally get carried away in the chill room!), but we all go somewhere in
the morning, and sometimes it isn't our own house ... and I know I sometimes run
into people I didn't expect to see when I'm out, and my plans for the evening
change... [ he he ; ) ] 

2.  Hmmmm..   a dilemma ... carry a condom, never get lucky ...   to me, it's
not at all lucky to want to have sex when you don't have a condom, 'cause
frankly, unprotected sex is about the UNLUCKIEST thing I can think of ...   so
with your logic, assuming you would not have *unsafe* sex, then you'll never
have sex!  If you have a condom with you, you're jinxed, and if you don't have a
condom with you, you're not gonna do it because it wouldn't be safe!

Solution?  Ask me and i'll give you one when you need it!  

That way you aren't jinxed by being prepared (by the way, I carry one in my
wallet, so it's always there, to be replaced if it gets funky before it gets
used) so it's not like I make some special effort for parties... I just don't
leave home without it!  I carry the best too....  (Magnums, they rule, even guys
who don't like 'em, like 'em!)

(Maybe I better put a couple extra for this weekend since I'm making this
offer!)          

Leslie    : )

With this philosophy, if you give the condom away, obviously you wont have a
condom any more, therefor you'll get lucky.  But you wont have a condom.  I
guess its a no win situation.

This is true!  I've been in situations before where I've had to be more
creative in pleasing my partner.  This is where foreplay becomes "play", as
it's not leading up to anything, but is the main event itself.  OK,
enough...this isn't alt.sex!

Sorry to jump in but I must also agree. Ahh nothing like just playing around

This is only rave related in so much as I make music, and you may see me
playing at some rave in the future, cuz I have in the past.

I'm looking for a keyboard stand.  In particular it's called an "Apex" and
it's made by the company Ultimate.  If anyone has one of these they want to
sell, let me know cuz I may want to buy it.  Thanks for the band width.

So true, so true.....
I have to agree 100%, I've never carried one with me cause I always thought
it was pretty presumptious of me...Here'a a solution.....If it seems like things
are working out, you could notice that, "Hey, we're almost outta gas, better

Bowls of condoms and lube at raves? Ugh.

I am all in favor of sex, a great proselytizer of it, in fact, but I don't
want raves to feel like sex parties. It is confusing enough as it is.

Maybe I am just being a prude. Hmmm..

Peace,
Jim

No, you're right!  This goes back to that "child's world" vibe thang, where
sex would presumably have no place.
Now, a sex party, on the other hand...THERE'S an interesting prospect!

Derrick May may have said that Detroit techno started long before Chicago
house did, and others may agree, and with MUCH due respect to Derrick May,
that's simply wrong.  As far as I can tell, and I've dug down into this
issue quite a bit, what we now call house and techno started roughly
around the same time.  You can hear them both in tracks from 1984 or
so, and both have emerged full-blown by 1986.  Detroit borrowed from
Chicago, Chicago borrowed from Detroit, and New York has a LOT to say
about ALL of that too!  

The precursors of both styles go as far back as you care to go.  Myself,
I agree with Ramon Wells, who was DJing WAY back in the day (in the early
1970s in Portland and Seattle), and is now the head of Bold! Records, who
said at the Billboard convention a couple of years ago and repeated to me,
"When you get down to it, it's ALL disco!"  And you know, he's right.
All of these forms have many influences, but disco is a dominant one.
If you look at it simply from the point of view of how it's made, disco,
house, techno and all the many variants are producer- rather than musician-
oriented production forms.  

Now, finally, on "Chicago versus Detroit."  Nonsense.  They are historically,
geographically and economically separate, and the musical scenes there have
always differed.  Chicago had the blues, Detroit had Motown.  Did anyone
talk about "Chicago blues versus Motown" in the 1960s?  No, they obviously
had differing styles but interrelated aspects.  Same as now.  

There has always been some interaction between Chicago and Detroit in
the development of electronic dance music.  That's obvious when you hear
Detroit house or Chicago techno, and both of those forms exist and have
their own interesting characteristics.  But the bigger issue to me is
*techno* vs. *techno* -- that is, what techno was when it started in
Detroit, the motivating forces and influences that underpinned it, and
what is has become.  Much techno I hear is soul-less, has lost the
very foundations of the music in order to focus on the forms while
losing the meaning.  The foundations of house too have been compromised
on the altar of commercial accessibility and pop sensibility.  

Just read the interviews or ask Juan Atkins or Mike Banks what they think
of what has happened to techno, or at least what people *call* techno,
over the last few years.  They'll just mutter and shake their heads.

It doesn't have to be from Detroit to be techno, in my view (and in the
view of the people from Detroit, I might add).  It has to be from the
*heart*, just like all great music.

Dear Nancy,

	I loved your tale (the good, the bad, and the ugly)... As another 
raver who's been known to frequent Bondage-A-Go-Go, I've had some of the 
same thoughts as you:  Noticing the differences between that scene and 
the rave scene and asking "why?"
	Rave parties are not as asexual to me as they seem to be for many 
people, but they certainly are not sexy the way Bondage is.  On the other 
hand, Bondage is a very cold place -- people are not terribly friendly, 
and the smile factor is very low.  I think it is also falling into the 
dreaded "routine" syndrome of having found a successful formula and not 
trying anything new or creative at their parties (we can do better here 
as well).
	What I'm wondering is why can't we have more luscious, ripe, smiling 
girls and boys sucking on lollipops and toting teddy bears as they flirt in 
minimal attire at raves?  Betty Boop could be a good role model.  8)  
	I certainly don't want to see our scene become infused with a typical 
nightclub "meat market" atmosphere, but... is wanting the sex without the 
attitude asking too much?

Polyethylene condoms.  Plastic, in other words.  I believe you can currently
get them at Good Vibrations in SF.  (Great store!)

 No,You're not being a Prude James. I felt the exact same 
way when I saw the first post from this thread. A friend of mine, who 
went to Lucy Charms, told me that in the chill room there was a table 
with loads of condoms on it. I just thought that was totally lame. Raves 
aren't meant to be one big make out session.

Eric - there is a new kind of condom on the market made from poly* (I 
forgot the rest). There were begin test-marketed in California for a 
while, but are now available across the country. They are supposed to
offer better heat-sensitivity than latex, and can also be used with 
oil-based ludes, like Vasoline (if you'd really want to do that). I 
believe they are just as STD-resistant as the latex kind.
Anyway, my gf just bought some, but we haven't used them yet ... I hope 
they're good.

That's why you carry many with you.  A couple to give away & a couple for 
yourself.  You need two, just in case one breaks...or....;-)

I do think it would be cool if they were supplied at raves.  Some people 
don't like the association of Raves & sex, but unfortunately (or 
fortunately :-)) sex is a part of life anywhere you go.  Sometimes it's 
just more "in your face" at raves.  Instead of hiding it, I would rather 
have condoms be available & have people be safe...

Just my $.02...

Yes, carry many!  You may go through as many as six in a single encounter,
more or less.  Have at least four, you never know...

Interesting choice of words.  :^)  Um, yeah, i think a bowl of condoms on
the juice bar or something wouldn't in any way ruin the mood of the party.
I think they would probably disappear pretty damn quick too.

And no, Eric, they can't go near the coffee station.  You know what a
leathal combination those two make.  Latex and caffeine!?  "Get me
started!"  :^)

As for Moonpup's original theory on pre-meditated possession of condoms
being inversly proportional to one's chances of getting a ride, I believe
that the same algorithm (do you think Al Gore has any rhythm?) holds true
for making one's bed before going out.  That is, the cleaner one's room,
the less chance one will have a visitor; the messier one's room, the more
chance one will have a visitor.

No condoms, messy room, carry half your houselhold possessions in a
knap-sack, have wild staring eyes and stickers on your face, hug people in
line at Safeway at 7AM, dress like a freak, uncontrollably bust a move to
the Muzak version of Stairway To Heaven...

Ah to rave and be raved...

However, for the woman, foreplay is not "play," but IS the main event -
along with everything else.  Our sexuality is experienced as a totality -
all body, all sensation, from alluring looks to hardcore sex.  Many women
are extremely frustrated by the masculinized version of sexuality, which
emphasizes intercourse as the "main event," the focal point, the inevitable
conclusion which is often too quickly rushed toward (by men).

I know through speaking to many girlfriends, and in taking two classes at
Cal around women's sexuality, that women have a very difficult time
accepting their OWN sexuality, and stopping castigating themselves for not
responding to the same stimuli (i.e. media images) and
sexual-response-model as men.  It is difficult, but liberating for us to
reclaim our sexuality, by expressing what WE need in bed: which is often
more "foreplay" (a misnomer because the "fore" implies it is something
lesser than the "real" thing, and because of the term "play."  "Sex"
meaning intercourse is also a misnomer, for the woman "sex" comprises much
more).

Because women often don't ask for what would turn them on in bed, I have
heard many women express HAPPINESS that a condom wasn't available, because
that forced the man to pay attention to other aspects.
(Do NOT take this to mean women are anti-sex.  We just tend to have a
sexuality that responds, initially, to different stimuli than men - and
that is something that is hard for a lot of women to personally claim and
to ask for in sexual relationships).

I've solved this problem personally through honesty, communication, and
claiming my right to be pleased and to please.  And sex has gotten WAY
better since the days of passive frustration, for me and my partners.  When
foreplay becomes a main ingredient to love-making, you'll find worlds and
worlds of experience...what was once boring (i.e. no foreplay and
intercourse too soon) has become endlessly pleasurable.

I say leave the condoms aside from time to time.  :)

Been to one. Excellent vibe.  The vibe was actually quite like a rave.  
It centered on music and dancing (nudity optional, although not for many). 
YOu need the right ppl and the right attitude and then it can be quite fun. 
The crowd has to be centered in its desires and ready to give to the 
party, not greedy and therefore taking away from the party.  Quite fun, but, 
definitely not for the weak at heart!!!

hello all-

within our "condommania" thread, i've seen 2 distinct modes of thought

either--

1)sex isn't really a part of the rave scene, and condoms at a rave
sexualize an encounter that shouldn't be

or

2)sex is part of existence, and raves being part of existence, sex is
still an issue.

i, matthew d. p. k. lanier, being of sound mind and body, would have to
agree with the second viewpoint.    when i go to raves, i go to hang out
with people, but i could never deny that there is a sexual element between
me and the people that i talk to, both male and female.  i have been in
circumstances at raves where i have, through choice of both parties, ended
up in a more intimate situation than i expected.  that's not what i go
for, but it happens occasionally.  i find it unhealthy, for me, to deny
the sexual component of raves as i find so many jumping to do.

i must aggree that, for me, sex has never been hurtful nor has it ever
been used that way against me, but there are some people who have had
experiences where sex was hurtful, and they might, or for other reasons,
not want their rave experience to be in the least bit sexual.

i respect people who don't enjoy a sexual element at raves, and hope that
they respect that i neither encourage nor discourage sexual energy at
raves, i just accept what happens.

perhaps, i should expand, saying that i have a rather broad definition of
sex, coming at it as a psych major.  study some Freud, and you'll
understand what i mean.


peace, love, and lots of other fun stuff, whatever that means to you!-

i agree with all of this, and I find the statement regarding losing the
soul, is especially deep to me, the music I like to hear and play has a
funky and (I suppose a soulful) cornerstone, this is why I like the
breakbeat so much, I often hear a trance song and think to myself "if only
this track had a breakbeat insteat of this 4 to the floor". 
 
it's as if a breakbeat can add a funky edge that gives off a soulful
ora........I find alot of the popular dance styles now (techno, trance,
jungle, happy hardcore, even house) lack that soulful/funktified ora to
it........just kind of formula music...... 
 
pleeeeeeeeease no flamage on the trance ..........moonpup

Techno: Space and Flow in the Radical Frame by Ian Kerkhof
Enter the world of South African filmmaker Ian Kerkhof as he traces the 
rise of techno music as a mass cultural phenomenon in Berlin and 
Frankfurt since the fall of the Wall. Sampling both experimental film 
classics, and interviews with premiere Euro dance producers and artists, 
the film is a visual and aural tour de force that muses, among much else, 
about the implication of a generation growing up without lyrics in their 
music, the role of drugs in pop scenes, and the increasing demand for 
trancedental melodic experiences.

Hi all!
 Just some thoughts to share here... As someone who has a great deal of 
sexual energy I have had to learn respect for others who do not. I feel 
that this has been a good (but very difficult, sexual feelings [for me] 
are so strong) process and I thank all the people who are sharing their 
perspectives on these issues. I do think that society in general could 
use a more healthy perspective of sex. Those of us who are members of society
have a responsibility to bring this perspective to other members (in a 
respectful way of course). I feel that raves are multi-faceted events 
that, at times, can include the all too human aspect of sexuality. If we 
learn and grow from our relativly safe rave enviroments, on how to 
deal with these issues in a sane and respectful way then we can bequeth 
our shared exoeriences to the rest of society through our daily 
interactions with each other. I feel that this would be a great gift to 
out society. However we do need to work out the problems between those 
who love sex =) and those who find it offensive at raves. Communication 
will help that process along.

Oh, they exist around here, no doubt about that.  The problem is, if you
think it's hard to get a good crowd of in-tune-with-the-vibe ravers, you
should try to get a good crowd of comfortable-with-nudity, non-pushy,
sexually-outrageous, exhibitionistic, respectful, safe people together
for a sex party!  Ain't easy.

Most of the sex parties I've been to require you to sign a form stating
that you've read and agreed to the party rules (which usually include:
safe sex only; no touching without asking first; no intrusive behavior;
etc., etc.) before you can enter the party.  It's possible to create a
safe space for public sex, but very tricky.

Mixed signals.  The question is, what kind of social context are you
setting up?  What are the expectations?  Most ravers don't want to be
groped.  Most sex party denizens don't either, really, unless they say
"yes" first.  One big problem with combining rave energy with sex party
energy:  if you have to yell all the time, it's pretty hard to make your
desires--or boundaries--known... and if people are dancing wildly, where
do you go to lie down and make out?  Oh yeah, that's what the chill room
is for :-)

Is it too much to want the sex without the attitude?  Not at all.  But
if you _really_ want the sex, you need to go to a place where there is
a lot more space (and more social context) for it.  It takes practice
to be publically sexual; it ain't something most people have ever done,
and if there's a lot of clueless, bozo energy around, it destroys the
sex vibe WAY faster than you can blink.

Hello...
	well, after much internal struggle and intrapersonal debate, I 
have finally decided cease my shameless voyuerism and jump into the mix 
here on the SF Raves list.  My name is Monty, some of you may know me and 
some may not.  I moved up to the bay area about 7 months ago from santa 
barbara, where I went to school, went deeply into debt, worked at a radio 
station, threw a few parties and paid some dues as a dj.  now, i live in 
berkeley with the man joe rice(among others) and am learning the ropes of 
life in no. cal.  
	it took me so long to actually post anything list-wide because 
i'm actually frightened by some the behavior i've seen.  people i know 
who seem mild-mannered in-person take on a different persona when on line 
.  why is this?  why engage in pointless rhetorical debates on issues the 
participants sould never ever really have any tangible impact upon(i.e. 
why trance isn't played @ sunset)?  Are my questions in fact rhetorical 
themselves?  then let me know in person, not via some lame flame.  i like 
most of you, really, and i'm a nice guy.  
	anyhow, overall i like being a subscriber.  interesting stuff.  
shout outs to my peeps who know me throughout this region of cyberspace.  
and those who don't know me, please feel free to communicate with me via 
anytime.  also, those of you who are gonna be in the haight on saturday, 
i'll be spinning @ ameba(happy b-day Andrew!) starting at maybe noon or one 
pm, so stop by and say hello.  in addition to that, i'll be playing in 
portland with ethan, joe, jon carel and frank minor next weekend at the 
gateway system party called gateway.  bye.
	p.s.-ethan! I can help out at Mad on Monday gimmie a call or mail 
me with more info

it souds like a joke to me... I've seen this forward many times but I've
yet to hear of "roofies" in real life. if it's true, it's pretty fucked up
to do something like that to someone, but I think it's a clever hoax or
something. just a gut feeling I have.

our RA handed them out last semester... some friends blew 'em up into BIG
balloons (and I do mean big... those things are strong!) and let 'em out
the window and they just flew away... there was no wind and they just sort
of floated around. very beautiful.

anyone here ever read "out of the silent planet" by CS Lewis? (if you
haven't, read it. if you have, read it again :)

It's got a scene where dr. ransom is talking to a resident of mars about
sex and marriage and such, and the martian is shocked that humans can get
pleasure out of sex with many people. He patiently explains that among his
people, sexual gratification includes courting, marriage, foreplay, sex,
bearing, and raising children, all with just one person once in your life.

I'm not sure how this all relates, but it's an incredible book and after I
finished the trilogy i thought "gosh wouldn't it be nice if the real
universe worked like that?"

hmmm...

random thought for the day.

CS Lewis rocks.

Actually...I could stand corrected...did I say Chicago copied Detroit?
I know they all came out vvvvvvery close to each other...I WAS hearing it straight from the

Welll.....thats what I actually was gettin at :)
I thought I too was getting a little long winded...but even still...many techno artists who we 
label as techno today anyway were making music before disco even...
Kraftwerk...Eno...Jarre...then it was called new age...today ???

I have read many of them :) along with personally talking with Derrick and Stacey Pullen

You couldnt have quoted them better.

Being that I was not an adult in the 70's, I was wondering what some of 
our older members of this list, who came of age in that decad(enc)e, feel 
about the relationship between the safe sex revolution, if you will, and 
the evolution of "raving."  I know this is a complicated question, 
one that might be better asked on a final exam, but I think that there 
may be something to it...  

(e.g. Question 96:  Would raving as such have come about without AIDS, 
and the attendant changes in sexual mores??)

Raving is a complicated phenomena, which has just as much to do, I 
think, with the economy, changing family structure, transcendance of 
the everyday (esp. among gays, but also among alienated workers), 
individualism gone amuck, popular music, religion lost/found, and a bunch 
of other junk, as it does with sex.  But since it's spring, and sex is in 
the air, can I get a witness?  

The sex drive (or vibe), quite simply, is one of the stongest around.  
My feeling is that in the 90's, if sex were as free, relatively 
safe, and multiply practiced as it was in the pre-A-bomb 70's, then 
we might be less interested in the "communual" vibe, and more interested 
in what some of us condescendingly refer to as the "meatmarket" or 
"clubby" vibe.  Perhaps we just wouldn't be able to help it?  
Actually, the "love" vibe is pretty strong, too.  

Am I the only one to ever think that raving was a form of safe (group) 
sex?  (I am conscious of perhaps having constructed raving as 
"heterosexual," even though there are obviously other sides of the 
triangle.  I just wanted to avoid making my question too complicated 
to handle in this medium, something I fear I may have already acomplished.  
Sorry for rambling.  It's late and i'm bored at work ;)

-Rok.

I actually read about roofies a while ago. I think there were two 
articles in the paper--one that introduced the problem and one that 
talked about FDA? DEA? response. I seem to remember that one of those 
agencies took action, but I'm not positive about that. Does anyone know 
for sure?

Wishing it were a hoax...

okay, nobody has said anything about GAIA this weekend (at least that 
I've seen here... maybe I lost it amongst the condoms...)
The flyer has no drug references, but one of the flyers does have rekkid 
company logos, which I think is a good sign :)
So here's who it says is spinning:
recording artists Progression featuring dj's Micro & Vicious Vic, LXK, 
Barry Weaver, Tony, Simon, Jeno, DJ Dan, DJ Liquid, Matthew, Jeyson 
(YAY!), Stevie, Dyno
Ambient/Experimental/Dub Chamber: Nexus, Kitara, Percussionist Alex 
Kalafus, dj's Shilo Maggi, Mark Ameba, Andrew Johnson (of Astral Matrix)
Anyway, just wanted to make sure word was around...

Ok, now we've covered the issue of condoms at raves, as well
as the subject of foreplay. ;) What's will be the next not
really rave related thing to take up 85% of the posts for a
day or two? Personal ads? *grin*

  Oh yeah, technics turntables are actually satellite receptors that tap
into gaia-one and draw energy out through the conductive receptors in the
tone arm.  The disc (or vinyl/record/wax/UMMM THATS GOOD DRUGS I CAN KEEP
FOREVER!) is actually like a key or access node into the massive amounts of
energy in gaia-one.  The art of mixing comes from the dance the dj must do
in order to attract hyper dimensional space elves who are masters of
aligning musical energy.  The dance is done by holding your hand on the
pitch slider and moving it really slowly.  The elves decide when the beats
line up and you must put your faith in them.  Then if you take your time
and appeaze all the forces that be circling around the room as your mix, a
dimensional portal may be opened if the musics align properly (but nothing
will happen if they are not).  This dimensional portal gets created when
the energies flowing from one disc can find room to continue to flow as the
other disc gets louder.  If one disc pushes the other disc "off" it's river
of sound the effect is ruined.  Through this dimensional portal you have
direct access to the ear/energies of the gods and godessess of gaia (most
people call them aliens/angels)   Once you do this once they can reset your
internal compass so that your path goes to, hmmm, the happy place.  This is
how I mix.

  Watch out which records you play or you may end up in a dimensional of
beautiful busty bondage biker babes with bad additudes, whips and hmmm,
maybe I should just let you explore...

Since you mentioned this and with the recent thread  about going to 
trance events if that is the style you like. Blue Room Released is one of 
the Record companies listed on the flyer (they are of Psychaos fame). 
Does anyone  know if GAIA will have more trance than Progress  which has 
Mars and  Surge for  the  trance addicts. I  am personally undecided and 
would appreciate any input.

Did anybody catch the Herbal E segment on the news last night.  I cant
remember what channel it was on, it was one of those Dateline, 2020 type news
shows.  They had a segment on Herbal E and other 'ectacy' legal alternatives
and how they related to a few deaths.  They interviewed the 'CEO' of Herbal E.
 He was blatantly honest about his product.  Saying that they are selling an
'image'.  and all the sayings on the box were 'catch phrases' to sell the
product.

        Reply to:   BLUE ROOM LOGO???

I have noticed the Blue Room Recordings (makers of absolutely BEAUTIFUL music
of the goa/psychedelic trance nature) Logo on the GAIA flyer.  I actually did
the two different one-color teaser flyers, and the promoters said nothing to
me about anything to do with Blue Room or any artists on the label.
I have noticed the logo on other flyers, and it always catches my eye, but
never are there any Blue Room artists performing or mentioned.(?)
It's not very cool in my opinion, because I am a huge fan of that label, and
thier logo always catches my eye...then a big LET DOWN.  I suppose there is a
possibility that the symbol means something else (before it was used for the
logo?), but I really don't know...
Does anybody know the scoop?
(If you are reading this Eric or Shilo, e-mail me and fill me in...)

I agree entirely, except you don't need beats to make it happen.  The elves,
who I believe actually live in the vinyl (because each record is an entire
reality/consciousness itself) communicate with each other as the new record
is being cued up, and try to come into agreement as to how the mix will
work.  If they agree, the portal opens up between the two records even
before the new one is turned up.  Sometimes you can even hear sounds from
the new records seeping through even before it's turned up.  (this has
happened a few times to me, and I tell ya, it is totally wierd when it
does.)  Oh yea, it also doesn't take "technics" to make it happen either.
My tables are Numark.  Technics are probably just higher quality receptors.

Even though I'm a newbie and lurker to the list I thought I'd put my $.02 in.

We've been talking a lot about herbal E and ephedrine lately on our Tejas
list here.  It seems that a lot of people want to ban the use of ephedrine
saying how deadly it is  blah blah.  However, these news stories focus only
on the rave scene and the herbal E aspect ;  they never once mention weight
loss products as deadly even though they can contain ephedrine.  Just
another attack on us poor misunderstood ravers.......   Love Toy =)

Speaking for myself as a young sexually active adult in the 70's, I
was never into the meat market, cocaine-fueled, egocentric, vibe of
the disco scene.  I went to clubs to see my favorite bands, and the
forms of music I was into (progressive rock, electronic, punk, some
new wave, and jazz fusion) did not really focus on sexuality all that
much.  Sex was something that took place in college dorms.  Since I
pretty much missed out on the 60's thing, what was lacking at the time
was a flourishing scene that supported a shared transcendental 
thing where people could connect to each other through some kind of
shared positive sensory-overload forward-looking technology 
influenced experience.  Back then, there was the choice of getting lost 
in the crowd at a Pink Floyd concert, or spacing out with a few 
hallmates in dorm room with blinking christmas lights and Frank Zappa 
on a cheap stereo.

In other words, I think that raving would have filled a void for
many people in the 70's.

I was able to help it, as were many of my friends.  There are people
who feel that there is much more to be gotten out of life than sex.
One thing that attracted me to raving was the lack of a pickup vibe
and more focus on music that had evolved beyond the superficiality
of disco.

I don't know.  There *are* sexual undercurrents, but I think the
attractive part of raving from a social/sexual perspective is the
lack of pressure to *immediately* focus on sex in our interactions.
It just seems so much more freeing and (ironically) unrepressed.
But then what do I know?  I was already married when I started
going to raves.

	And to others of us, a lot of "soulful" music is just too damn 
happy and lacks that tribalness, that force that pulls energy from deep 
inside. Again, it is a matter of tastes. Anyone can say that a certain 
type of music has lost its character, but labeling something as formula 
music is dismissing it and what experience does anyone have that would 
make them an "authority" on whether funky is better for everyone than 
primal, tribal beats? I might easily turn around and say "House lost its 
essence as soon as soul came out, well, no, as soon as that refined 
classical stuff came out because classical music was set in a restrictive 
era and the music was meant to move only certain aspects of your emotions 
while leaving you appearance unchanged. Ever since then we have simply 
been trying to get back to primitive forceful sound." So what's the 
difference? I have been involved with music since I was born, both 
performing and listening and in many styles. Does that make me an 
"authority"? Only to the extent that my ear is refined and I can play a 
whistle pretty well because of it, and it makes some things easier and 
some people tend to like to listen to me do those things. But that is the 
extent of it.

Unfortunately it's true. They went through a popular phase in the English
(I'm thinking actually more Scottish and Irish) club scene last year - they
were called jellies over there.

One of the nicest things I ever got out of raving was the ability to go 
up to a total stranger and talk to them. No "I am just talking to you because 
I want to pork you" meat-market-thang. 

Putting bowls of condoms out like party favors changes the whole vibe. This 
is neither or good nor a bad thing, it just is a different. Personally, it's 
not the vibe I am looking for.  I like the freedom to talk to anyone 
without them wondering "what do you want from me" or visa-versa. 

I guess as with everything YMMV...

It must be true.  There was a case on the news recently of a (13, 14, or 15
year old) girl who was drugged and raped in northern CA.  That might be the
substance that was used.

	Which is based on the book Trainspotters, which is written by the 
guy who wrote The Acid House. Both good book and I think trainspotters 
was recently released domesticly. If is wasn't, one could pick it up at 
Dark Carinval on Claremont St. in Oakland (just a couple blocks down from

There was another show last week, I think it was PrimeTime or 20/20, that 
did speak specifically to ephedrine and it's use by people (the focus was 
teens) for, among other things, weight loss.

>>Just another attack on us poor misunderstood ravers <<
It seems (IMO) the overall focus of recent reports has been more on teens 
taking an excessive amount of ephedrine in a variety of packages than on the 
association of Herbal E. with the rave scene.

I think the solution is education, not a ban.  People need to know that 
toxic levels of ephedrine can be reached quite quickly.  A ban would likely 
reopen the attempts to regulate other dietary supplements (vitamins & 
herbs).  _That_ would truly suck :)

	Ugh jellies... A prespection drug, tripdamine <spelling> if I am 
not mistaken. They were all the rage in Glasgow a year or two ago because 
their buzz is supposedly just like alcohol but no stomache effects. Made 
people quite aggressive as well, so we saw a lot of fights due the stuff. 
Doesn't sound like gang rapes would be too far from that if you got a

If you mean the recent case of the two high school girls been drugged and
raped, one of whom drowned, the papers reported that methamphetamine was
the substance there. Fuck speed - I don't like placing value judgements on
substances, but I've never seen anything good come out of speed use.

The Examiner reported the other day that methamphetamine related deaths
increased substantially in SF (I'm thinking around 100%) from 92-93 to
93-94.

Hmm, I'll have to go look through my old UK mags - I thought jellies
referred to rohypnols, but I could have easily been confused. It's so hard
to keep up with all these damn drug trends. =)

	Chikako and I were also at this show, and I feel about the same 
way Troy does.
	I wouldn't say the music was not danceable, because we did dance 
for a bit, but it didn't even come close to the groovability of the tunes 
at your average rave event.
	Knowing the reputation of the Hardkiss Bros., and having an 
appreciation for the campy creativity of the guys in Negativland, I felt 
this was a big let-down.  
	Part of the problem, IMO, was the mixture of musical styles 
without any effective means of coordination.  They described what they 
were going to do as an unplanned, five-hour freeform jam, and that's 
pretty much how it sounded, except we didn't stay for the full five 
hours, we got bored and left.  From what I heard, either the band or the 
DJs would have sounded better by themselves than they did together.  
	The main thing though was just a lack of vibe, minus any creative 
attempt by the promoters or the performers to create one.  After this 
show, I've come to the conclusion that I really don't like "concerts."  
When I go out, I want to party and interact.  If I just want to listen to 
music and be entertained, I'll stay home and save the $11.00 for someone 
like the Orb, where I know the atmosphere will be more like a rave and 
people will be dancing.
	By the way, I still think Negativland is a very interesting band, 
and I particularly recommend listening to the long, rambling track 
"Helter Stupid" for those of you who haven't heard it.  The best time to 
listen to it is in the car, when you can concentrate on the intricate 
nature of the recording and not be frustrated trying to dance to music 
not really suited for that activity. 8)

Peace, luv & grooviness,

This was in Potter Valley (near Petaluma).  Girl's name was Raina 
something.  All the news stories said she was drugged with 
methamphetamine.  She and her friend were then raped.  The friend was 
found in a drug-induced stupor.  Since this has been brought up, I've been 
wondering...How can speed make someone so drugged that they are in a 
stupor and don't remember a thing?  Having never done the substance, from 
my limited knowledge I am still doubtful this happens.  Could someone 
clue me in?  

(you can take it off the list since I doubt anyone wants to hear this!)

Mical,

This is very real.  I read about roofies out here before I wnet home.
There was a small article in the paper about the drug.  It has been used at
university frat parties for one.

It ain't hype,  I was talking to someone in Miami who uses it to get high.
I don't like downers and near tranqulizers (never had a Qualude), so I
ventured no farther than examining the pill.  It is very real.

Peace,
John

P.S.  The guy & his girlfriend indulged.  My brother and I did not.  We
left shortly after they dropped.

Not very clever of a criminal to feed a person speed and then try to do
something to them, think of the WWII german soldiers who were given speed
to improve their courage, strength and relieve battle fatigue. I have a
hard time believing this to be honest, it's not the kind of drug that
puts people to sleep or renders them defenseless. One would have to give
someone a few grams to really put them out of business I guess.

As with any drug it is the dosis and frequency of use that counts, not
the drug itself. Nevertheless speed is not a very interesting or safe
compound I would say.

It's cheap and it seems to be an innocent stimulant. This country could
spend a bit more money in educating its people instead of putting them
in ever more jails.

Roofies have been popular by soccer hooligans in Holland, usually combined
with lots of alcohol etc. It usually made them very aggressive and strong,
tearing down places and the people in them, and inducing deep sleep and loss
of memory of the events subsequently. Also not a very nice drug I would say.

George Bernard Shaw said...

	Dancing is a perpendicular expression of a horizontal desire.

And I think he was totally right on with that, 'cause we should dance just like
we have sex (and vice versa) -- free and open, honest and sensual, happy and
uninhibited, expressing who we are.

Does sex belong at raves?  Personally, I think sex is a private thing, and I'd
never want to encourage public overt sexual behavior on the dance floor or in
the chill spaces. And like so many who have posted on this topic, one of the
wonderful things about raves is the lack of feeling like sexual prey, which so
often happens in cruisy club environments.

Like everything, sex is about choice.  Whether you're sexually active or choose
not to be, whether you have multiple partners or are monogomous, whatever,
that's your choice to make, and you need to follow your heart on that.

The most important thing is that people have the easy resources to make the
right choice.  And safe sex is *always* the right choice.  Unsafe sex is
*always* the wrong choice, but I know that it's a choice lots of people,
especially young people, make because it is a hassle to be safe.  No condom?  Oh
well, next time.  Hey, I've been there and I understand the temptation.

Solution?  Condoms discreetly and easily available.  Free.  Having condoms
available isn't about pushing sex on people.  It's about their safety and
health, and making it easy for them to do what's right when and if they choose
to have sex.

Someone was pondering on how raving may have been influenced by our safe-sex
restrictions in the 90s, vs. the free love of the 70s.  Having been part of
both, I think the peace-love-communal vibe in the 70s was a lot the same as
today's rave vibe, but the issue of deadly STDs has certainly squelched much of
the free sexual behavior.  I think that's good because it makes us think twice
about who/what/when/where of sex, and sexual communication is a very powerful
and sacred thing.  

But the sad side to me is when I talk to young kids who have just cut their
sexual side out of their life, because it's just easier that way.  

Somewhere there's a middle ground, and we all need to seek the spot that's right
for us.  I am the mother of an 18-year-old daughter, and I want her to make the
choices that are right for her, the choices that fill her with self-respect, and
choices that are safe.  I want the same for every one of you, too.  

Just don't start screwing next to me in the chill space, ok?  Geez, that makes
me uncomfortable!  ; )

Hi All!
Just thought I'd share some personal experiences I've had with pseudo-ephedrine
as of late...I first started taking "Mini-Thins" when I was in college.  My 
friends and I would take between 4-6, sometimes 8 before we would go out at 
as you can imagine, it did the trick!  The combination with alcohol was pretty
fun, except for the fact that we were doing HORRIBLE damage to our bodies, and
taking a lot of risks.  Ephedrine comes in many forms, Pseudo-Ephedrine, 
Ephedrine, and Norephedrine are chemically very similar.  Someone once told me
the molecule for Ephedrine and Pseudu-Ephedrine are mirror images of eachother,
same chemical formula, different arrangement.  Anyways, we did this for about
2 months every weekend, until it started really disagreeing with me.  Stomach
upset, and hot flashes were beginning to appear, so I reduced my dosage to 1 or
2 at a time. (Can't remember the MG equivalence).  So to make a boring story
short, it's gotten to the point now where 1 is too much, and the results are not
very predictable.  Just a word of caution!  This stuff, in any form, can 
seriously harm your cardiovascular system...We don't want anyone dieing!!!
	Love and hugs to all!
-Jeremy

I'm writing an article at this very moment (well, 1.3 moments ago, 
actually) about the energy behind dancing......And there definitely is 
that sexual element to it...But I think it's very easy for people -- 
especially people new to clubs and aprties -- to confuse the energy 
behind that expression as sexual, when it's so much more -- it's jsut 
mildly sexual on the surface...First and foremost, dancing is a means of 
communication as valid as a poem..It is part indvidual expression, part 
tribal identity, part art, it's a way of letting yourself and people 
around you know what you're thinking and feeling...Thus that's a very 
shortsighted statement by George Bernard Shaw....

>And I think he was totally right on with that, 'cause we should dance just 
>like
>we have sex (and vice versa) -- free and open, honest and sensual, happy and
>uninhibited, expressing who we are.

hell yeah, but ideally we'd live our whole lives this way....it's 
difficult to make the jump to that level when everyone else hasn't 
reached that point, it ends up doing more harm than good...

Last year at the Wicked party in Colorado (a year ago this weekend 
actually -- Wicked's in Colorado again in 2 days!  woo!), two people had 
sex on my backpack....and my water bottle (which I needed badly many 
times throughout the night =) was literally lodged between this girl's 
legs....I wouldn't've really cared, but, their whole attitude afterwards 
was pretty disrespectful and anti-PLUR....

Not very good for the environment, though. Letting bits of plastic float 
around, especially clear plastic, is harmful to animals who think that 
it's a tasty jellyfish dinner, or something. I'm saddened by the release of 
any balloons into our air, despite the cosmetic effect. Talilla

        I totally think you hit a lot of good points. The sex drive is one
of the most primal forces in humankind (and all the animal kingdom) and if
it can't find some sort of direction (as in typical sexual relationships;
and this process of typicality has been upset by numerous sociological
factors including AIDS and a general openening up of awareness of gender
identity and orientation) then this drive will cause us to evolve into
certain ways of living in which this energy can be channelled. I *totally*
think that raving is one of these manifestations of this energy.
        I think that a lot of people, from all disciplines, who are doing
'creative hobbies' like djing, flyers, making music, etc etc (both in and
outside of the rave scene) is another way for people to focus this energy.
It's cool to have EVERYONE seeing themselves as some sort of 'artist' (at
least for me, having gone through art school and really not liking the
intellectual heirarchy there). Anyways...
        Think of this equation: orgasm/intercourse based sex is to tantric
sex as clubs and meatmarkets are to raving. At least IMHO. :)
        A non-raver friend of mine who's never been to a rave described an
e-party he was at and tried to imagine a rave and said "it seems like it'd
be like a big orgy, but without the sex." HA HA HA
        True enough for me :)
                orgies of energy =),

        Well if she does play nearby, i hope that the sound crew know what
she does to the 1200s sometimes. When i saw her she modified the tables to
go to +16 and -16 instead of the usual +/-8. It sounded cool but i think
the sound rental co. was a bit put off. ;)
        And whoa, she played Spastik (plastikman) and i think i almost lost it.

One of the things I like the most about raves is that the sex vibe is low
key - i.e. it's not being pushed in my face because people don't tend to
hit on me the way they do at clubs and because the writhing body in come
hither seduction isn't the main way people dance generally (exceptions I
know)

HOWEVER - SCARY PERSONAL STORY

I always seem to need a condom when I don't have one and last year found
myself crossing my personal safe sex boundaries in order to pursue more
fluid exchanging activities with an ex-heroin using, current womanizing
fling - knowing full well of his past but being WITHOUT CONDOM and carried
away in the heat of passion

one month of agonizing pregnancy scare and six months of even more
agonizing HIV/STD scare- all's well thank god.

I now carry a condom ALWAYS - EVEN TO A THREE YEAR OLDS BIRTHDAY PARTY 

BECAUSE YOU NEVER, EVER KNOW WHEN YOU'LL NEED ONE. 

Along those lines I also try and wear a decent pair underwear whenever I
go out... you never know who might be seeing them later on.

So please guys, whether you think of raves as being sexual or not, carry a
condom and be willing to use it.

It's just not worth the risk 

Jess

Andy said ... (about how the energy of dancing is more and different than
sex)...
	First and foremost, dancing is a means of 
	communication as valid as a poem..It is part indvidual
expression, part tribal identity, part art, it's a way of 	 	letting
yourself and people around you know what you're thinking 	and feeling...

I love that description of dancing, and I think sex can be like this too...

 -- don't get me wrong, if I had to choose between one or the other for the rest
of my life ... I'd think long and hard, but I'd probably pick dancing ...
because of the additional musical depth inherent in it and because of the
varieties of human contact and communication that aren't possible with sex
(after all, I love dancing with and around all kinds of people, but I'm way
picker about sexual partners!)....

He says....(about being free, open, honest, uninhibited when we dance, as well
as when we have sex...  in short, being ourselves).... 

	ideally we'd live our whole lives this way....it's 
 	difficult to make the jump to that level when everyone else
hasn't reached that point, it ends up doing more harm than 	 	good...

I'm not sure I understand what you mean here, how can we do more harm than good
when we open our minds and hearts?  Maybe my original post implied that open
sexual behavior was ok to me -- that was't what I meant to imply.  I just feel
that the same place that our sexual/sensual feelings come from is often the same
place our dancing vibes come from, and by keeping these open, we're more in
tuned with ourselves and we're more integrated.  

Last night, Jay-J played a song with a voice track that I loved, it said
something like "make an example of yourself" -- and that inspires me, because
that's the highest goal I think we can have, to make an example in our behavior
to other people.

And those people who had sex on your backpack at Wicked were either obnoxiously
self-centered, or way too high -- in either case, I think it's totally
reasonable to interrupt people who are behaving inappropriately and suggest that
a different time/place would be in order... in a respectful and gentle way, we
can still be assertive.  I don't want people screwing on my backpack either!

Last night, I went with a couple of friends to The Top on Haight Street, to
Thirsty, and we had a ball!!! 

DJs are Jay-J and Jellybear, and they played some of the grooviest, most
dancable house music, full-on all-night kind of music...  great to hear such
good tunes in a little, comfortable funky bar, with a nice little dance floor
and a totally casual vibe. 

Free, too!  So if you're a house-head like me, check it out!

Count on seeing me there again next week (maybe I'll have one less martini
though next time .....   oooooooooccccchhhh.......morning comes so early.......)

Ok here goes - to decode my last message

frottage and tribadism are both the rubbing of ones genitals on someones
body part other than a hand, mouth or genitals.  There may be subtle
differences between the two but basically they are the same.  However I
have heard some men in the gay community refer to frottage specifically as
rubbing ones penis between anothers legs to get an intercourse-like effect
without the exchange of fluids

great example of it between two girls in the movie "Liquid Sky"

Explicitly yours,

Jess

Is Ma Huang the potent herb in herbal E?


PS - I dont trust those news shows (20/20, Dateline NBC, etc.)
A couple of years ago Dateline NBC did a segment on GM cars having faulty
gas tanks when involved in a collision (ie exploding) so what did they do?
they rigged the cars to ensure that they would explode and staged a crash.
As far as relating them to death, you can tie anything to death if you
wanted to.

        Hey, i thought frottage was a surrealist painting technique
invented by max ernst. hmmm maybe some people are into that. hahaha.

I saw a television program on young girls in Texas who had been raped on
roofies that had been smuggled from Mexico.  They are very real
unfortunately . . they are illegal here but across the border they are a
legal sleeping aid.

I'm not a chemist or botanist, but here's what I know: Ma Huang is ephedra. 
 Similar to/identical to/converted to ephedrine, I'm not sure, but it's part 
of what gives you the go.  Gotu Kola is caffeine.  That'll also get you 
going.  I don't remember whatever else is in Herbal E.

 Although I'm not a condom expert , here's my opinions anyway!

1. If you're not in a sex/love relationship with someone , then it makes 
   sense to me for a guy to bring a condom with him. Especially if he's
   the type of fellow who'll carry a pack of stuff with him - if you
   haul asprin or candy around with you , ya' mind as well carry around
   a rubber or two ( just don't confuse the candy and condoms in the 
   dark ! ).

2. If you are in a relationship , the implications are somewhat more
   complicated. If you bring a condom with you to an event that your
   significant other is not attending - is there a (sub)conciouss 
   intent to have a sexual experience with someone else? 
    I don't bring a condom with me when I go out, because I don't plan
   any interactions of that type .

no kidding; the space trilogy starts out as a cute little mars adventure
and turns into a really heavy "universe at war with itself" armageddon type
story that manages to consolidate every world religion I can think of into
one view of the world that somehow totally makes sense to me.

I've gotten so much mail in response to my initial skepticism about the
existence of roofies...
but I guess I just haven't heard enough about them.

OK, I believe now, thanks everyone.

	Ok, these are Tomazapan <spelling again> not tripdamine (part of 
DMT). They are the same thing as the jellies of the UK. In both the US 
and the UK, I believe they are perscription sleeping aids...

Lots of new names in the lineups this week, so it seems like a good weekend
for variety.  I'm not sure what to recommend, but at least you have lots of
choices!  Note MAD's new location this week.

I've updated the radio and TV section - thanks to those who have sent updates.
I think it's still a bit out of date, so please send me any new info.

	The fact that SF has managed to build a beautiful, huge
library and a gorgeous art museum within a five year span means (to me)
that this city has its priorities straight.  :)
	I love SF!

I just remembered that I can go!! My friend from London will be arriving 
on May 31st, just in time for the party.  So I want to know, are tickets 
already on sale, and if not, when do they go on sale?

love,
Amy

...according to all the posts about always having a condom handy.  I 
mean, that is good and all(safe sex) - I'm just surprised at the numbers of 
people who are willing to share such an intimate experience with someone they 
*just* met.  Hmm... I guess this girl's just a little old fashioned in 
that department.  I'm not being judgemental toward those who like that 
sort of thing (no flames please) I'm just making a comment on my 
*observations*.  

love & respect,
Amy

 IMHO i dont think human energy begins as sexual, it begins as just 
energy, and each individual can channel that energy into different things 
like sex, creativity, love, friendship, dance... funny how closely those 
things 
are related, as they stem from one source, the original energy which is 
you. its like you can set your energy to vibrate at different 
frequencies, or emminate from different chakras (sp?)

just a humble thought.

love,
tom

Hey fellow ravers and the likes.

i'm off to San Luis Obisbo this weekend(Friday) and I'll be in La Saturday
to see friends and attend a local underground party or two.  Kinda excited
cuz this will be my first LA party in 2 years (the last one left me with
bad thoughts about the LA scene so I hope this weekend is better). Have a
good weekend!!!

Re: condommania

Always were one, usually always carry one or two - for my girl friend and
I. Personally I wouldn't try anything sexual in/at a rave becaue the couple
of times I did I really got bitched at by some annoyed ravers.  I see were
they are coming from cuz this type of stuff is more personal and not to be
displayed or shown to those who don't wish to see it.  What I'm trying to
say is do it in private unless you can get the concent of 200 or more
ravers...

Re: Ravers in love

Cool story... This is the first time I found a person who enjoys partying
as much as me and is a raver.. Usually I meet girls in clubs or other
places that don't enjoy house/techno/trance.  Enjoy it while it lasts -
It's kinda cool.  :)

it called? I am already going to be in the city, so why head

Thanks!

I swear this is my last post on this topic ... hmmmm....


but Amy said "I'm just surprised at the numbers of people who are willing to
share such an intimate experience with someone they *just* met" --

Amy, I know I for one never said people were preparing to have sex with someone
they just met (obviously not that it never happens) -- 

but as so many of us meet each other again and again at parties, and build our
friendships over time, there would certainly be no surprise if one of those
friendship sparks turned into a fire one night -- even for the most
old-fashioned of us!

So being prepared isn't always synonymous with being casual about sex....

And Amy, I'm glad you're coming to the Mendocino campout!  I hope to see you
again before then!

I and some friends are headed into SF tonight and I seem to be the leader. I'm
fairly new to the Bay Area and could use some suggestions for this evening--->
morning. I went to see Sven Vath last Friday and had a sweet time, I'd rather
not hit a club tonight but I'm not sure where else to head. Enchantment? Can 
anyone tell me about DJ Dimitri?

many thanks in advance,
Sarah

Oh yeah, I'm delurking...moved here from Vancouver, BC to go to Stanford where
absolutely nothing happens! Should be moving to SF soon.

--It really is wonderful to have cool friends who enjoy doing what you 
do.  My boyfriend finally enjoys going to raves (this was a tough one!!) and 
I've found some good friends who like to go too.  This was all I ever 
wanted, but it sure is great while it lasts!!  My favorite thing is to 
feel, all of a sudden, this great vibe or energy, and turn to your friend 
and go "Wow!" And they know exactly what you are feeling!!!  It doesn't 
get better than that!!

Shroomarama shirt ;)  Maybe a big, white, KSJS tee-shirt instead...hope to
see some friendly faces and meet some new friends!  If I don't get out
there, everyone have a blast, and I hope they play some trance for you

Dear Friends & Family,

My computer tells me that on 12 Apr 1996, Edwin shared:

> I think maybe in the global "rave" scene, there's a harder, darker, or more
> aggressive side that's not as apparent on the west coast, or in SF, at least. I

Edwin, I think you're right.  Even here, tracks with what I feel are very 
negative lyrics are widely played.  I'm thinking specifically of a 
popular tune that went "I'm bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher in 
other words sucker there is no other/ I'm the one and only dominator/ I'm 
the one and only dominator."
	It had a nice beat, sure.  Fun to listen to -- but if I were 
DJing at a party, I'd find something more positive to play.  There's lots 
of great tracks out there.
	And I'm glad to see that the shirts Ameba Clothing on Haight 
Street used to have prominently displayed with mass murderer Charles 
Manson's face all over them seem to have been replaced with more friendly 
designs.  
	Really, if we want positivity in our scene, we need to be 
concious of the imagery and the content we bring to the scene.
	Or PLUR (peace/love/unity/respect) will remain just a slogan, not 
a way of life.  
	Shawna's recent posts from Canada should serve to remind us that 
the global rave scene needs our infusions of love!  8)

PLURally yours,
				<<< Starchild >>>

I went to this same "sex" party as Kirsten.  I had expected something
sleazy, but as it's a much-loved twice-yearly occurence among certain Cal
students, I wanted to check it out for myself.

I had originally envisioned greasy guys grabbing me without my consent or
enjoyment, and a repulsive gangbang-type environment of graphic sex with
every woman in the room.

Nothing was further from the actual experience.  With wine, grapes, and
chocolate sauce in great abundance, the only rule was that someone else
must feed you or pour wine in your mouth.  Shedding clothes, getting
together, and sex were all absolutely up to the individual.  The vibe was
intensely _sensual_, not sexual, as great soul music, soft red lights and
candles created a luxurious atmosphere.  What surprised me the most was the
fact that nudity became unbelievably LIBERATING, not exploitative.  The
atmosphere was one of total acceptance.  People (both sexes) shed their
clothes with abandon, moving freely on the dancefloor in beautiful
nakedness - it being a sensual celebration of their humanity, not
voyeuristic exposure.

People touching became an extension of the heightened sensual ambience of
the party.  Bodies moved together, people were lapping chocolate sauce off
of each other, and there was a lot of kissing and caressing.  It was erotic
rather than pornographic.  "Foreplay" rather than intercourse.  People
explored their new liberated sexuality in groups of three or more: women
together, men together, mixed, threesomes and couples.  The energy in the
room was absolutely intoxicating - group sexual energy, rightly channeled.

I think when people object to sexuality at raves (myself very much
included), what they are objecting to is the destruction of the open,
accepting environment of the party that mainstream "sexuality" would bring
us.  Mainstream sexuality - as opposed to what many of us experience
privately - is primarily a power hierarchy: the male objectifying and
subjugating the female body through leers, gropes, and an attitude of
conquest.  _That_ sort of "sexuality" is what many women unhappily
experience at clubs and on the streets.  The objectification of the male
leer, the anonymous hand groping you from behind on the dance floor, serve
as reminders of your status as sexualized OBJECT.  These sorts of
encounters are by no means consensual, nor are they meant to be.  They are
a warped type of sexuality positioning the male as negative sexual actor
above the female subject (who is further judged primarily by her physical
attractiveness) - a power play reminding women of their sexualized,
secondary status.

Objectification is utterly insulting, but it is also, IMO, a symbol of the
sickness of our society's attitude toward sexuality.  A different group
definition of sexuality is needed, much like the intense, respectful
sensuality of the "orgy" Kirsten and I attended.  If sexuality at raves
meant exploring this new form of relating to each other - of celebrating
the individual's sensuality, absolutely consensual, with the objective of
mutual pleasure and respect - then perhaps raving could serve to enlighten
on this other, very crucial plane.  I don't think this would mean doggie
style in the chill room!  It may just mean more passionate kissing, more
holding, than we see now.

The atmosphere will never be graphically sexual - but a critical element of
this new definition of sexuality may be the incorporation of SENSUALITY
into the meaning.  As this acknowledges women's sexual response*, it
nullifies the patriarchal power relation inherent in the contemporary idea
of "sex," and could evolve us into a more equitable, happier society.

*see my post entitled "Foreplay" for elaboration.

Girlfriend,

This is more about you than I needed to know. Thanx for sharing, but is 
this still a rave mailing list or what? :-) All this talk about sex makes

Although it IS true that the remix was done by Elektric Music (Karl Bartos'
current group), it's not true that it was a promo only. It was released on
a COMMERCIAL CD called "Afrika Bambataa - the remixes" or something like
that. Other remixes on that CD include on from LFO. =)

        Yes, and this reminded me to give you a bit of a scoop on what's
happening in my 'soon to be ex-home' montreal. This is somewhat of a long
post saying 'appreciate your scene' (which is BEAUTIFUL, may i add :) Then
again, it's the people that make it cool, people like SFravers :).
        Anyways.  The past few raves here in montreal have had a large
influence of bikers in them. Either bankrolling the party (with the intent
of having a non-free market economy in place for their bad e :P) or just
dealing at the party.  I was told that a large percentage of Montreal's
illicit comestibles in the rave scene are provided by the Hell's Angels. :9
Yum!
        So, the situation has become rather tense, with eager partygoers,
frightened promoters and bikers asking for a 'cut' so that parties (if not
put on by them) won't get busted. I heard the figure was 200-$500 per party
that you'd have to pay them. Then you have to pay off the cops ;) Actually,
there's one security company here that everyone uses because they've
already paid off the cops so there's one less thing for you to do as a
promoter.
        Yes, so the tension has reached a point where on the 'Rant Line'
(which is like an alternative weekly papers "open forum" for calling in)
someone has called in to say the following:

        "First of all, let me say that if i find smeone at the next rave
telling me i can't deal my ecstasy, not only am i going to punch them, I'm
going to follow them outside and put a gun to their fucking head. I don't
care if it's a fucking Hell's Angel or a little punk. I have the best
prices, it's supply and demand, and if they want a fucking war, they're
going to get a fucking war."

        Whoa there rambo! Methinks this is one of the numerous "big guys
half naked slathered with vicks" i often see at parties. I think the
testosterone took a couple wrong turns with this guy and it's all backed up
somewhere.  Oh well, this is only one in a series of long rave-related
calls that the rant line has got (and oddity for montreal, as the
alternative papers are totally punk/grunge/whatever kind of nihilistic
self-effacing music is popular at the time.  Two weeks ago it was two girls
calling a promoter a motherfucker because he oversold a party (5000 people)
and had one water bar ($2.00 each, no refills) so they had to drink out of
a hose (?) and got really really sick. (Geez, didn't your mother teach you
never to drink from strange hoses at raves?).
        The week after someone else called to tell the girls that they were
'hosebags'. Ah yes, that punny canadian humour (?)
        Anyways, don't let this happen to your city. Man, that sounded like
something from a 60's propaganda film ;) Yes, so i'm moving out of here and
hopefully will be joining my SF brothers and sisters at some point in late
summer.

        Be good to yourselves :)

Hi!
 Thanks for the very enlightening post. The element of sensuality that 
you hilight in your post is , I think, what I was trying to say in my 
post asking for people to explore this aspect of humanity at raves and 
then bring what we learn to the rest of the world.

Hello to all of you that I met at the last Gathering and Harmony.
I never expected to meet so many people from a simple post.

Anyway, I'll be at Gaia tonight, and so I'll be 
wearing my green Full Circle "People X-ing" shirt.

I'll also be bringing a tonload of newbies so they can use
all the "vibe" they can get. If you see me make sure you
say Hi!.

Claire, I'll have your cards in a week and they look TIGHT!!!!

Sorry, I wasn't trying to be mean to Nancy or anyone else. Her post was 
interesting and a lot of thought obviously went into it. It's just... 
reading that post and others about 'sex parties' makes me uneasy. What 
about AIDS and the host of other veneral diseases? Syphilis, gonorrhea, 
and herpes just to name a few. I am reminded of this cartoon I saw in the 
70's where there is a man standing in the middle of an orgy with a sign 
around his neck saying "Penicillin." 

I know there are a lot of youngsters on this list. I certainly don't want 
them to think that all of us are having group sex. You don't need to have 
engaged in intercourse to get a disease from someone. Even oral sex will 
do it. I admit I am somewhat of a prude... I guess it's a pretty uptight 
notion these days to say that sexual experiences are meant for people you 
care about. 

I'm not trying to impose my morality on anyone. I just want us to be 
careful. :-) The combination of drug use and casual sex= a weakened 
immune system. 

Love, Amy (<-- sounding like your Mom)

While it is true that the only truly "safe sex" these days maybe dancing :)
There are a lot of misconceptions about STDs and AIDS/HIV especially.  I just
went and got tested for HIV (I hadn't had a test in about 5 years and even
though
I haven't done anything that is considered _really_ risky...) Well after
I discovered that I was negative (whew!) I spent the rest of the time asking
questions about the nature of transmission, etc.  It seems that as far as 
risk factors are concerned the riskiest activity (from highest to lowest is)

        Unprotected anal sex on the receiving end
        Unprotected vaginal sex on the receiving end
        Unprotected anal sex on the sending end
        Protected anal sex on the receiving end
        Unprotected vaginal sex on the sending end
        Protected anal sex on the sending end
        Protected vaginal sex on the recieving end
        Protected vaginal sex on the sending end
        Unprotected felatio on the giving end
        Unprotected felatio on the receiving end
        Unprotected cuningulus on the giving end
        Unprotected cuningulus on the receiving end
        Protected felatio on the giving end
        Protected felatio on the receiving end
        Protected cuningulus on the giving end
        Protected cuningulus on the receiving end 

The reason some "protected" risk factors ar high is because there is a
moderate chance that the condom could break*

I was also told that HIV infection by oral sex is possible but unlikely
(The Center for Disease Control has only 2 recorded cases, both on the
giving end, one case had the person performing felatio 3 - 5 times a day
on multiple partners, 4 - 5 times a week AND the person had gum disease
and did not use condoms.

One is at risk for Herpes,and possible gonorrhea by having unprotected
oral sex, by and large it is a GOOD idea to use condoms when having sex with
_anyone_ with whom you are not absolutely sure of their HIV status. I would
include all strangers in this catagory. However I don't think that people should
shy away from sex because of these things no more then you should avoid riding
in a car because of auto fatalities.  Be careful, don't do things that are
stupid, be loving aware, and caring of your partner, whether you just met
them or are engauged

Sex is great, it eliviates tension, releases endorphines, and helps th keep
people well rounded, just think what the world would be like if all of the
world leaders were getting their brains fucked out of them by someone
that they loved and loved them :) I tell ya it would be a different planet!

Hi!
 Thanks for your post! One, of course, needs to be careful about sex and 
drug use (licit or illict). The ideal I'm searching for is an honest 
exploration of the issues in our community -- and your caution that you 
express is an intregal aspect of that exploration. I feel that sfraves 
and raving in general have a great oppertunity to make ouselves more 
cognizant of the issues and that can only be good.

Don't be silly  :) Your own attitude for yourself is as important and 
relavant as anyone else's. I know that many people share your perspective 
and I, at least, respect it. I think it is good to say "I don't believe in 
casual sex" if you don't. Your voice is important and welcomed.

Last night I was watching Channel 5 news, highly amused at what passes for 
"news" on Network television, and they had a "story" about "Mexican Black
Heroin", or some such drug horror.

They proceeded to interview some ex-junkies, with their stories, and talk about
how heroin can ruin your life, which I don't doubt.

But *then* they said:

"A lot of modern media images like to glorify the use of the drug to the 
teenage audience, such as its use in 'Pulp Fiction', and Kurt Cobain's death 
due to a heroin overdose"

Now correct me if I'm wrong, but as I recall, Kurt certainly *DID NOT* die of
a heroin overdose!!!  And I personally would like to say that Kurt never 
enamored the notion of shooting heroin in any shape or form!!!  What *are* 
these
bald faced lies!?!?!?!?!  To spread drug hysteria and propaganda... I guess I
shouldn't be so surprised...

And further, as far as I remember it, "Pulp Fiction" didn't even come close to
romanticizing heroin use.  Again, I watched a woman attempt to snort heroin, 
and
immediately keel over and almost die.  Gee, that looks like fun!

Did anybody else see this awful report on The Way Things Are With Kids Today?

Thank you Amy!
There are two of us Amys on this list who are uncomfortable with this whole 
topic.  I'm not a prude either, by any means - I just don't think that a 
rave mailing list is the appropriate place for discussing this sort of 
thing. Private email is fine, of course, for those who wish to persue 
sexual discussions - but for the rest of us - it is yet another arguement 
as to what is appropriate for this list.  Please, no offense, Nancy. :)

love,
Amy

Now I know I've heard it all. From a benign topic such as sex & dancing all
the way to orgies and sex parties with chocolate.  Yummy, just what I want
to do, have anonymous sex (safe or not), with a bunch of people, whose
hygeine and sexual history I am completely unaware.  And I do not think
there IS a such thing as safe sex.  You can wear as many of those
semi-permeable membranes all you want.  They still break, and you can still
get nasty shit by fucking these days (like genital warts, which can be
on/near the area of sexual contact, places a condom doesn't cover).  And
there has been plenty of nasty stuff flaoting around our dance community.
I won't go into details. E-mail if you're really interested.

With that said...

I do wonder about those people who say that sex has little to do with
dance.  I dunno where this idea comes from that there should be sensual vs
sexual enegery at parties.  Geez, from time incarnate whenever men & women
have dnaced together it has ALWAYS been a sexual thing.  That sensuality
stuff IMO is just a coverup or made by people who are uncomfortable with
the overt nature of sexuality of dance.

I really cannot think of a dance that is divorced from sexuality.  Whether
that be Bavarians doing that lederhosen dance thing, or the polynesians
doing thier originla dances, to the dances of my ancient home of Africa.
Yes, there have been dances about the harvest (sexual), dances about the
seasons (sexual), and still I cannot think of any form or type of dancing
that does not involve sex & sexuality.

Rave is, IMO,  no different that any other form of dance where sexes meet.
It doesn't matter the intent, we are so westernized and have come up with
so many barriers, so many excuses, that somehow some of us might say aloud
that rave ain't about that.  But when you see that person, that special
person with some special vibe, the way they move, the way they look, the
way they are, to deny that you get some form of arousal is being naieve,
IMO.  Hell, I KNOW I'm in touch with my sexuality, and when I see the right
BBB (bra booty betty), who can shake it, sweat it out, smiling, in sheer
ecstacy from the music, there is only one thing going though my mind.  Of
course that's usually the only thing going through my mind, but that's
another story.

Anyway there should be a sexual tension when the exes meet.  G-d, I would
hate going out if its all about non-sexual, non gender vibe.  I'd feel like
a friggin robot or worse a eunich (is there anything worse than either?).
I like being human, and all of the complex things about being human,
including sex.

Anyway enough of my pontification.  Sex & dance...that is what I want.
That is what dance is about.  It wouldn't be called shaking the booty,
getting in the groove, feeling the vibe,  makin' it funky, if it weren't
about sex.

But then, I do have the most purient mind.

Peace

P.S.  BBB <-  I have been using this term for years, and have no plans to
stop.  It is not meant to denigrade or objectify.  It is an apt description
that refers to a time when it got soo hot in places that many ladies of
dance would shed their outer skin, to reveal their bras.  The booty comes
from what they were shaking, and betty's is what they were, very nice
looking (IMO) ladies.  Most recently at some UG called Sandbox (didn't see
anything about it on the list) here in the city, I got a chance to see
actual real breasts (not the first time mind you) at a rave.  They were
actually quite nice, but I did wonder, since it really wasn't all that hot,
why sister chose to shed almost everything.  Same for the fire dancer, fire
eater, no top just tips (read nips).  I just didn't get it.  I could
understand it if it was really overwhelmingly hot, and people had to shed
something, but I see that as a last resort almost.  There were no problems,
and after the initial shock, people just kinda ignored it.  As soon as she
noticed that she was being ignored she put her top on (or it coulda been
she got cold, it looked like it).

One other thing about Sandbox, since it was not reviewed here.  It is
something I have always despised, something that actually started happening
at Martin's parties a long time ago.  The pow wow, in the middle of the
dance floor.  At Sandbox, some nondancers, decided to build a sand altar
right in the middle of he dance space.  It prevented people from dancing
(the primary objective), and the girls set up some candles etc, etc.  It
was all I could do not to stomp on the whole thing, but I'm a nice guy.
After she built this, er, thing, she decided to trance out by sitting with
her legs folded, her and a couple of guys I guess, and that took up even
more space.  My g-d folx, please have respect for some of us who just want
to dance.  I am not trying tantric nonsense at raves, nor am I trying to
get in touch with my shakra, shakti, or my mufti.  All I want is to shake
my booty with some friends.  Can we all just dance together without the
altars?  If you DO want to pray and trance, can you do it so there is
minimal impact to the dance experience.  Same thing for stretchers (people
who have to warm up by stretching on the dance floor), same thing for
people who want to do yoga, same thing for calisthetics.

And people wonder why I don't go out anymore.  There's no place to dance,
that's why.

A moment of your thoughts, if you are so inclined, for the memory of
Bernard Edwards who passed from this life a couple of days ago.  He
was the ground-breaking bassist and co-producer for Chic, along with
Nile Rodgers.  They began producing dance music which both fully
partook of the disco style and went well beyond it, starting in the
mid-1970s.  Sure, many of their tunes were radio fodder and were 
overplayed, but I think most people would agree that even overexposed
tunes like 'Le Freak' set a standard for both production and feeling
that go well beyond the usual limits of dance music.

I played the awesome "Sometimes You Win" from Chic's 1978 album "C'est
Chic" last night during my chillout set in Eugene.  It's still as awesome
as ever.

Edwards and Rodgers fell out over creative and personal differences in
recent years, but what matters most to me is that when they were on,
there were none better.  

Next time you hear a particularly funky b-line that makes ya wanna get
up and sweat, remember Bernie Edwards.  He was all that.

peace out

        They arent the greatest sales people but have decent prices,
although I usually use their prices at Pro Sound to get it shipped faster
(they are in Maryland) and Pro Sound will almost always match their prices.

Sammans Electronics (ask for Adam ext. 240) 1-800-937-3537
        I ordered 1200's from here for $389 in September and a couple I
have given this numer to have ordered them for same price since then.  They
don't come with any cartridges (but most that do come w/Stanton 500's and
they suck anyway) but with the savings you might get you could buy Stanton
680's!  If they have jacked their price like everyone else and you call
them please deop me a note so I stop giving their number out =)

I fully agree :) i can't imagine why one would dance if not for the fact 
that it's sexual in nature to begin with, although i don't think a polka 
is all that SENSUAL :)  the idea that moving one's body in a pleasurable 
rhythmic way isn't sexual is just wrong!!

it's the safest sex there is sometimes ... i know i have had one 
experience dancing whch was pretty darn orgasmic ....

my humble 2 cents

Have you ever thought about trance-dancing -- moving in such a way as to 
release endorphins and Goddess only knows what other mind/body chemicals. 
Shamanic traditions abound with stories of dancing to get out of the body 
to find solutions to an individuals health problem or problem's 
confronting the tribe. Very powerful stuff.

If your ,IMHO, narrow perspective does not allow you to see the good and 
enjoy it at raves, then perhaps it is best you do not go out any more.

Well, I'd have to disagree. I think they're total assholes, and snotty
to boot. Their attitude put me off enough that I never bothered to
order from them. 

I recently ordered a Pioneer CDJ-500mkII rig from J&R Music World in
NY. THey seem to have prices that Pro Sound couldn't match (esp. when
you factor in the fact that you're not forced to pay CA sales tax and
that ProSound charges a lot for shipping). I knew the folks at J&R
weren't BSing me about the price or their delivery times because I've
ordered stuff from them before, and so have other family members.
They're rock solid (check em out if you're buying
computers/printers/audio/etc 1-800-221-8180). Of course, they don't
have a very broad range of Pro sound or DJ equipment, but they did have
the Pioneer CDJ-500MkII's, so who cares. (Plus they were extremely nice
and helpful).

Meanwhile the assholes at Pro-Sound are telling me that the J&R folks
are lying to me about their prices and delivery times and that ProSound
wouldn't and couldn't match J&R's prices. WHen I tried to put the
squeeze on them and tell them exactly the "out the door" quotation and
the delivery times that J&R had promised... the sales-guy even had the
audacity to go into a 5 minute rant about how little he cared whether I
ordered equipment from them and that it didn't personally matter to him
whether he completed a sale or not, etc. SO I'm like ok, I guess I
won't buy from you <<click>>. The first time I called this asshole, he
immediately went from giving me pricing information to asking me for my
address and my credit card #. I asked him why he wanted my credit card
# when I was still shopping, he said "because you want to order this
now, right? why wait..." and went into a long buy-now pressure tactic.
One of my basic rules of life is that when people pressure me, I
immediately apply equal and opposite pressure in return, so I started 
telling him that I had already gotten a lower quote from J&R and that
he had to match that quote. He tried more pressure... i didn't know
they hired car salesmen at pro audio shops.

I also sent e-mail to their address asking for pricing/ordering info,
plus I ordered a catalog. This was approx 2 weeks ago. No reply
to the e-mail. No catalog.

Too bad. I already dropped my $$$ somewhere else. I guess I wasn't
pro enough for the likes of Pro-Sound. Fuck them and their attitude.

PS: although their prices aren't great, Leo's Audio in SF are a very
nice/helpful set of people. They're straightforward about the prices
they can and can't match. Check 'em out.

PPS: if anybody's gonna give me shit about trying to squeeze the last
penny out of some mail order retailers lineup. Let me remind you that
these guys are typically marking things up 40-60% over their cost. This
may make sense if you're getting lots of service and showroom support,
but that's not what happens in most mailorder transactions. So when
somebody can't match a price it's time to <<click>> and go elsewhere,
especially if they come off like complete assholes like the folks at
ProSound.

PPPS: of course, I may have gotten the wrong sales droid, and all the
other sales droids at ProSound aren't assholes...

Hi folks!
 First let me say that I appreciate the feedback (despite my schorched 
hair) from Michael Clay and John. However I am in disagreement (still) 
about the inherant sexual nature of dancing. It may seem to some 
(including Masters) that the energy involved with dancing comes from the 
sexual chakra but that is not the base chakra (I believe there is one 
more lower?) and as I understand it the chakras do not generate energy 
they transmute it from the universe at large into personal energy. Myself 
I think that we get a lot of our energy from the planet and our sun and 
who knows where else. In leaning towards John and Michaels point of view, 
I would say , if anything that this vibe is not a sexual one (although 
one can certainly restrict one's view in that way) but an impulse to 
survive (which all life seems to have in some degree) that is typically 
recognised as sex (proceation). I feel that one can remain focused on the 
pleasure aspects of fulfilling the sexual drive in some way (daancing) or 
one can dig a little deeper to explore where this impulse of life is taking us 
(if anywhere) through trance and meditation.
 As far as trance goes, it does not need to be a disconnection from the 
day to day reality around us. My favorite game is to trance dance and not 
bump into people or things around me. The deeper into trance I go, while 
remaining in contact with the here and now, the happier the vibe for me 
and the longer lasting the effects of integrating my intuitive and 
rational modes.
 Also this equating dancing and sex as one makes me think of all those 
guru's who preached love, happiness, meditation, fastimg, world peace, 
whatever and just made phat bucks and fucked the cute devotee's.
 John I didn't address your sandbox problem for a variety of reason's. It 
seemed like a silly personal thing, I like feedback from people on events 
in order to get a feel of what is working. The sand alter was most likely 
an experiment for someone(s) and was probably very cool for some folk. 
I'm sorry but your comments sound more like whining than anything else. 
If you just want to dance there are plenty of clubs that cater to just 
that. I think of raves as more experimental and free form public art 
forums and I think experimentation is good. Again I REALLY appreciate 
hearing anybody's feedback but saying that you are not going to go due to 
something "relativly" minor sounds kinda like a lame threat.

Hi sfravers,

I (finally) installed realaudio on my system today and wonder
if any of you could recommmend some sites to check out... so
far my poking around has not turned up anything too exciting.
I'd like to find something related to ambient and / or dance
music or else just something bizarro to treat my ears to.

thanks!

Hi!
 I felt my last post (sex and dancing) was long, weak and not well thought 
out. There are, I feel, perhaps a decent idea or two in there but overall
I not happy with myself for posting it. So I would like to offer my 
apologies for putting it on sfraves and I promise to think a little (more 
like a lot) bit before posting.

However, it was uncool for many.  She could've had it on the side where
less people were dancing, she could have shown some consideration of
others, as she tries to with great space mind you, catch her own groove.
It really prohibited others from joining in dance.  But you were not there,
you would not know.

I am all down for experimentation, as long as it does not interfere with
the group groove.  And is not disrepectful of others want/will for dance.

As for being silly.  I will ignore that comment...for now.

>I'm sorry but your comments sound more like whining than anything else.

We JUST had an episode of this.  Discretion is the better part of valor.
I'll leave this jibe alone...for now.

>that.

Really?  I didn't know there  were actual clubs that played house music.
And I can go there and there will be no tranced-out hippie (wanna-bee's)
making altars in the middle of the dance floor?  Kewl d0od, tell me where
the party's at and I'm there!

(chuckles)

Man, did you miss the point.  The point is , respect for others.  I try to
catch a groove, but I really try not to bump into people, I try to give
myself some room, but give others some as well.  If I need to move into a
crowd, I will always say excuse me as I pass.  I guess I just have too many
expectations.  I better get rid of those before they get me into real
trouble.

>I think of raves as more experimental and free form public art

>hearing anybody's feedback but saying that you are not going to go due to

A lame threat?  Naw, reality.  I am not going to go because it is far to
religious for me.  I mean, all these people have gotten into my little
scene, something I really loved, and turned it into a free form public art
forum. It distresees me that things aren't the way they were.  Before there
were chill rooms, there was music and a dance floor.  No Zamfir pan flute
music and a bunch of gropers on bean bags giving massages and reading tarot
cards by blacklight.  Before rave became a free form public art forum, it
was just there for the dance.  I guess I was limited in my thinking that
this would last.  The only constant is change, and you can expect certain
change with a free form public art forum.  No, I guess you're right, rave
is dead, long live rave.  Now we truly have a direction, a vector in which
our free form public art forum can go.  To flourish and blossom into a new
type of free form public art forum, where dance is no longer the purpose.
Where sex is an abstraction to be enshrined inside the wrappings of
psychobabble altar paper, to be used whenever the subject is broached so it
can be neatly presented, logical and clean.  And I can see now how these
very ideas can exist within the context of a free form public art forum,
can not only free us from the confines of limited thinking but free us from
the problems and intricasies of humanity, where everything has an
explanation, where there are a million answers to everything, where there
are no answers at all.  I am saddened at my loss of parties, rave or
whatever, but I do have some reassurance that the old ways have paved the
way to a new vista, a new adventure, a new free form public art forum.

cmon...

People go to parties to hear some good music, see some friends, dance and
have a good time.  Everything else is bonus.

This is all IMO of course.  I'm still looking for clubs with house music.
Forget underground, I can't stand to get dirty, I need a club that sells
booze and stays open till 2 a.m.  Where there are high heels and stockinged
legs.  Where sage & wood necklaces have given way to sparkling gold
apparel, and capped teeth.  Where I smell Gendarme cologne, instead of
stinky old arm & body hair sweat.  I need a night on the town, where I can
wear some good clothes, and meet some top drawer people.  Now this is REAL
house.  And that's what I want!  Dj of the evening?  DJ P.Como, slammin the
cold rock stuff from 12-2 (who listens to music before 12).  Martini's are
half price before 11!

People should respect everyones right to have a good time and catch a groove.


Out,
John

P.S.  One of the reasons I don't go out is that I am surrounded, even
harassed by trancers and trance energies.  I mean the brightness of the
auras, and all that vibe they send out is rather unnerving.  I can't
concentrate on BBB's while they are around, filling the air with their
energies, essence, reaching higher plateaus of hummus.  I just find it way
too distracting.  Once, when I almost kicked one, a while back before I was
in the know about these things, I would learn a lesson I would not soon
forget.  While trying to circledance, my foot was heading toward the back
of a trancers skull, my foot bounced off of some invisibile force.  I can't
explain it, it just bounced off like it hit hard rubber.  I got up from the
floor after losing my balance with that flying scissor kick rebound.  The
trancer then looked up to me, calm, serene, and said, "Did you knock?".  It
was like they were talking out of an echo chamber, "Hello, hello, hello!!!"
It was!, they were talking out of an echo chamber, but I didn't see one.
I knew then that I was dealing with something greater than myself.  Humbled
, I slinked away, into the dark confines of a corner, trying to put myself
together.  As I looked toward the dance floor, I couldn't see the trancer,
just a big blue ball hovering over the dancelfoor.  I knew then that I
witnessed the birth, at that very moment, so crystalline, so clear, it was
the start of a free form public art forum.  I knew then as I know now, that
I really was limited.  I start my juggling classes and General Ed.
requirements for Urban Attention Getting.

I knew then, to respect one and all trancers.  They do good stuff.  They
helped me get into juggling.

...


no more altars!, no more altars!, no more altars!, no more altars!,...

Hello all,

I just bought a Technic SL23A (FG Servo) turntable at a garage sale.  
It was only $30 and looked in good shape so I figure it will be a good 
table to practice mixing with.  The people were very friendly and 
sincere so I didn't bother trying it out (just took there word).  
Unfortunately the belt is broken.  Does anybody know if I can replace 
that belt?  I will be contacting technics to see if I can get a belt 
and some directions on replacing it.  I could bring it back but I kind 
of want to fix it and keep it.  Thanks!  

love chris

Hey Chris,

There is a place in Oakland that repairs Sl1200's and has PLENTY of parts.
I forgot the name, but if you call 411 for (510), and ask for Technichs
authorized repair, you'll get the name/number.  They are also in the yellow
pages.

They should have the replacments part for any Technic gizmo made.

Peace out,
John

Haven't seemed to find it yet.

I've taken numerous trips to the Vegas area over the years, and searched
and searched for a nice place to dance. This trip I decided to really make
an effort. I checked my favorite coffee/cafe hangout Cafe Copioh. This is a
really cool spot on Maryland Parkway near UNLV. Nothing that even resembled
a Rave flier, I asked around and a few folks said Utopia. Hummmm, so I
flipped through a copy of SCOPE, (kinda the Vegas Guardian). I found a few
prospects, one a used clothing store called The Haight (gotta check that
out) the other a new clothing store called ECO Style. So I head up north to
check out the Haight, They are not open yet so I cruize the thrift store
accross the street and find a cool shirt (silver lamay $3.98). They are
still not open, so I check out the antique store downstairs, the lady there
says they usually open around 11:00, so I hang a few minutes, then wait
upstairs on the balcony. Julie arrives around 11:15, we immediately hit it
off. The store is way cool, and her prices are good. We go downstairs and
hang out with Holly next door who also has a cool used clothing store
called Rags. I hang around there for about 2 hours talking about Vegas and
the people there. Trying to figure out what makes them so uptight and
nervous. Julie couldn't believe my openess, and said thet most of the
people who find her shop from the SF area are all this way. It caught her
offguard, like "What do you really want ?" So anyway, I bought a Velvet
jacket from her, and a cool orange shirt and a VW toy from Holly. Oh Yeah,
I picked up a flier for "Utopia" its a weekly, club event down town, Sat
nights. Looks cool. Different DJ's each week, from all over, this week a
local, one from Chicago, and another from Austrailia. Next stop was ECO
Style. Nice shop, nice clothes, got a shirt there as well, marked way down
:)  (I'm becoming quite the little shopper these days). The girl there
asked if I was going to Utopia. I guess it's the only thing going. She
agreed. I asked if there are any UG parties, all ages?? outdoors maybe??
She said there used to be some but not any more, just Utopia. Hummmm, one
night a week, downtown, and over 21. Everyone was very enthusiastic, so I
decide to stick around another day to check this out.

Sat night, a cup of tea at Cafe Copioh, a bite to eat and I'm off to
Utopia, but first I decide to have a little fun with the tourists (and
locals) and take a stroll down the strip in the wackyest rave-ware I could
find. Much wispering and snickering as I wander down the street. I few
times I was almost confronted, by 5 or 6 very cleancut-American looking
college boys, but I think they decided it wasn't worth the effort. (good
for me) I arrive at Utopia, and wait in line, short, quick. A few cool
looking kids are floating around, we say Hi, and see ya inside. Once I get
inside, the place is done up really nice. The folks putting this together
really want it to happen. Great artwork, big chill room, big couches,
beanbags. The permanent looking artwork (sculptures) are nice as well. I
proceed to the fairly empty dance floor, and bop around with some of the
cooler folks from out front. Then I really start to notice that about 10%
(or less) are really into it. They are all decked out, in the coolest of
thrift store fashion, and dancing up a storm. The other 90% and hanging
around one of the 3 full bars dressed in black and high-heels. I might as
well have gone to the Shark Club. I thought, maybe it's just me, lighten
up, so I cruize around the place, just checking things out. I got stranger
looks inside the club than I did out on the street ?? Really sad. It was
like any BAR in town, except it had better music, great space, nice
visuals, but the same uptight crowd. I wanted to grab the 10 or 15 cool
kids there and bring them back here with me. We gave it our all, but the
room just wouldn't respond.

So to sum it all up. Has SF and SFRaves totally ruined my going out
experiences, once I leave town. Will anything ever measure up to the SF
scene ??  I couldn't wait to get home, and to think I almost moved to Vegas
!! Utopia was by far the best thing I've found in Vegas, but compared to
what I am used to, on an almost daily basis, it was really sad.

Sorry for the long post, I think it's rave related. I just needed to vent,
and tell you all that I miss you.

luv,

Vince



PS: I guess I shouldn't say there is no Vibe in Vegas. There is no Rave in
Vegas, I found some very vibey people, and some nice places to hang out.

Having just left SF for Chicago, the MWRaves list has me thinking that 
nothing matches up to SF. Apparently one has to drive hours to other 
states to find a good event. Appreciate the vibe you have.

Hello!
I think that raving encompasses so much of life that to limit the 
acceptable topics on this list would be to limit our views. Whatever 
evolves on here is part of what people are thinking and projecting at 
parties, so should it be catagorized? Raving is one part of a complete 
life, so everything has its place....Talilla

progress was quite nice. it lived up to my expectations quite nicely, even
though there were only minimal decorations.. i had expected it to be a bit
more "spiritual" in nature, because of all the hoopla they made about the
celestine prophecy. the jungle room was a bit too small, IMO, but there was
obviously nothing they could do about it, given the space they had (which
was very nice).
i went up with Jess and Renauld (i hope it's that. i'm so terrible with
names), who has an awesome pair of orange pants, and ended up meeting Nancy,
KC and some others (whos names i forget - sorry all. again, i'm just
terrible with names). everyone was really having a great time, and there was
lots of energy flowing around. however, i didn't experience any of that
sexual energy that everyone is talking about! surrounded by beautiful women,
and not a twinge. maybe i'm just an anomaly (sp?).
overall, a great party. it's just too bad i had to work the next day. :(

Dear Friends & Family,

	This strikes me as one of those instances when the spread of 
information might prove helpful... 
	Only a few days ago, Ethan tells us that due to noise complaints 
and other unspecified difficulties with management, MAD would no longer 
be happening at the Bahia on Mondays.
	Now Jim tells us there will be a new weekly event, same space, 
same night, different name.  I'm wondering, does Jim know what caused 
Ethan and crew to pack up and move?
	If he does, and decided to use the space anyway, is it because 
the problems have somehow been resolved?  Or has this new group of 
promoters somehow compromised in a way that the old promoters would/could 
not?  
	If it is the latter, I would like to know the nature of the 
compromise in order to determine whether Movement is a party I want to 
participate in.
	On the other hand, if Jim and his fellow Movement promoters don't 
know why MAD left (and let me add here that I don't know myself, or I'd 
be more than happy to share it with you all) I suggest that they find out 
but quick from Ethan or Joe Rice or someone in the know so that they 
will have an idea what's in store for them using the space.

Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

No sex vibe ????  but you DID notice that you were surrounded by in your
words "beautiful women"...... now imagine a rave with ONLY men  attending

Too bad that most US raised males think sex is ONLY about genitals or
genital involvement - it's far more subtle than that and lots more fun 

Just had to comment ;-)

HAHHAHAH!! this is sliding off the original topic but it was such a funny 
mental image i had to comment!

i think a rave wih ONLY GUYS, at least with only guys like the ones _I_ 
know, would be a VERY SERIOUS RAVE :) since a lot of my male friends 
spend their time enjoying the HUGE amount of females at raves there 
wouldn't be anyone to talk to so they'd all just dance grimfaced, face 
front. :)

on the other side of the coin, if all the WOMEN i knew had a rave only 
for women, it'd degenerate into a huge gab-fest .... or possibly 
grope-fest if i know a few of my friends :)

an interesting concept, but really, i hope the sexes remain equally mixed 
in this scene ... it's lots more fun ;)

Amy,

        Don't be sorry!  You're absolutely right that people should be
careful.  We've been discussing this for a while now.  Have you seen the
condom thread?  We care just as you do.  You're not sounding like a prude
or an old-fasioned person or anything; you sound like a concerned, caring
individual.  I, for one, admire and encourage such behavior, especially as
it contributes to the PLUR vibe many of us seek to further.

Love and respect,

- E

Ouch!  I don't think that's what he meant, Randy (right, John?).  There's
been talk before about obstructions on the dance floor, and it's a BIG
DEAL, because that's where we all come together, whether as one (as it
should be, IMHO), or in our own separate-but-still-together worlds, to
celebrate life through this thing that we call dance, one of the most
important activities people have engaged in since we could dance at all!

Boogie down, y'all,

I'm sure the vibe will be unique from place to place, wherever we go.  No
expectations and an "open mind for a different view" (to quote Metallica of
all sources!) will stand us in good stead whenever we explore the scene in
different areas.  Yes, let's appreciate, cherish, and nurture the vibe we
have, and remain inclusive, not exclusive!

>No sex vibe ????  but you DID notice that you were surrounded by in your

does beauty stem from sexuality though? i had original considered writing
"beautiful women and men" but since that didn't really apply to my sexual
orientation i didn't include it. still, men can be beautiful as well as
women, as can material objects. i could find a building aesthetically
pleasing - certainly no one would argue that i was sexually attracted to an
office complex... (hmm. better start alt.sex.fetish.architecture now..)

>Too bad that most US raised males think sex is ONLY about genitals or
>genital involvement - it's far more subtle than that and lots more fun 
proud to say i'm not a US raised male, and that i don't share that viewpoint. =)

anyway, why does dancing have to go hand in hand with sex? our whole body
works in rythm (cycles), not just sexual function. our hearts beat, blood
pumps, cells live and die. our whole existance is not only about sex! (well,
mine at least. hmmm.. does that mean everyone picking up these sexual vibes
is a nympho? uh oh.. i'm on a list full of deviants!! =) )
going back to the music style thing again, maybe everyone listens to a bit
too much house? ;)  IMO, house is a more "sexy" form that say, gabber or
acid trance. just imagine trying to have sex with gabba in the background.
those 240 bpm might make it a bit difficult...

and other thing about progress: i was drugless again, bringing me up to 100%
straight attendance at raves.

Just wanted to thank the Renegade Sound System for such a great afternoon!
The sun finally decided to peak out from behind those clouds around 5:00.
Yeah!
  The music and vibe were mellow and it was nice to see some familiar faces!

I live up in Novato so the 10 minute jaunt was so nice!!  Hope there are
more outdoor events out there.  Question:  How did the sheriffs respond?
Noticed one walkin around from time to time!

Thanks again!!

Reports on the 420 evening event, anyone?

Looking forward to F-8 this fri!

Hello everyone,

    Well, it's been a good week of relaxation, after we had to cancel 
the last Harmony (4-12-96). (Pretty disturbing, but you do what you 
gotta do!) So anyways, we are bringing all of our thoughts and energy 
together again for another party...

     On May 3rd, Harmony Productions presents... "Beautiful People"

    Djs:    Deaks   Ethan   Greg   Trent   Graeme   Shilo Maggi

            (408) 486-9591              (408)450-3044

    We have a space in the S.F. area that holds 1000, and has a.c.!!! 
But, we are only letting in 800, because we don't want everyone to be 
over-crowded. Our party at ACME was way to packed and we don't want to 
do that again!!! (And no, this party is NOT at ACME!!!) So get there 
early, to ensure that you get in!! Also, the first two-hundred people 
through the door get cool free stuff!!!!! :) 

    We want to see you there! So come out and help create a night of 
love, energy, and harmony!!!!!


Peace,

Greg :)

i have to disagree. it's a well kept secret, but when we guys get together,
we do needlepoint. really! ask to see my numerous accidental self-inflicted
stab wounds!! =)

seriously though, i do enjoy the huge number of females at a rave, but in
aesthetic sense, not a sexual one. am i alone on this?

hmm. sure. we know you really sit around drinking beer and watching football
when you're alone. you can't fool me. i know that all women are really

Starchild's post, re: Movement replacing MAD at the Bahia Cabana, echoed my
thoughts exactly. If MAD was shut down cuz of noise, won't Movement? I'm
confused.

I've had a great time at MAD in the past and my pal, Rusty, and I plan on
checking out tonite at its new spot. Anyone else?

I've got really short dark hair and black-rimmed glasses. I'll probably be
wearing my Hello Kitty crop top. Rusty is a big guy with long
red(surprise!) hair. I'd luv to meet y'all, so say "Hi"!

I just wanted to add my personal experiences about dancing and its 
relation to sex.

When I dance, I really feel the music move my body.  I used to not even 
know how to dance.  I was a bit intimidated by the dancing "form" at 
parties because I felt like such a clutz.  It took me many months to 
squelch my intimidation, but what did it was the music.  I have always 
been infatuated with music that made you want to MOVE and that gave you 
energy.  When I first heard house/techno, something clicked.  It took me 
awhile to truly appreciate the music, but when I did, I stopped caring 
about what I looked like when I danced.

Sporadically, I'd achieve movements that "felt" right.  I honestly don't 
know how to explain the movements, it's just that they evoke a wonderful 
feeling in my body that makes my body never want to stop.  I have no idea 
what I look like, and I guess I just don't care anymore.  I enjoy myself 
by moving my body, and that's all I care about.  

A friend of mine just recently admitted to me she was really nervous 
about dancing and how she looked.  I told her that if she worried in the 
least bit about what she looked like, she'd never really be dancing.  
After I told her that the only way to dance is to move your body until 
you reach this feeling where everything feels "just right," she tried 
it.  Now, I swear, her dancing has improved and she reaches times when 
she really enjoys herself.

Anyway, when I dance, sex is the last thing on my mind.  It isn't sexual 
to me at all, and I really hope someone doesn't see me in a sexual 
light.  I've run from that for a long time.  I'd rather be me, Kirsten, 
with all of my imperfections than a pretty object to look at. 

Although, I really do understand the beauty of dance.  Second to dancing, I 
LOVE watching other people dance.  It absolutely enthralls me to see people 
enjoying themselves in this way.  I love seeing all of the beautiful 
people (which is everyone) let down their barriers and dance in their own 
way.  If this is sexuality in a larger form, than it is a form completely 
unkown to me.  I feel completely devoid of sexual feelings while dancing.
But, maybe there is a level of sexuality that I have yet to reach!!!  

cheers,
kc

You are not alone here, this is how I see it too.  I don't know how many 
women would admit it, but, I think we always look at one another too.  
Face it, women are beautiful.  But, so are men, and I look at plenty of 
guys, too!  (please, let me express admiration here, and not 
objectification! :)

For me, this is what its all about. Hitting that state where I forget that i
am deciding to move at all. Just being jumped and pumped and moved by the 
music. Its like I hit this slick spots in the areas around me and the space
pushes me into it, moving my body without my conscious will, but with all
my energy and approval.

Its kida neat that such a physcial activity can at times make me forget 
my body exists at all. 

take care

We brought in a pretty hefty sound system for MAD, and while sound
complaints were one factor leading to our decision to move they didn't
constitute the whole story. At V/SF we'll be able to provide high quality
sound and a great environment and as promoters we're much more comfortable
with our relationship with the venue management.

Hello everyone,

It has taken me awhile to get to around to writing this post, but here it 
is.  It is just me writing about my experiences, but I thought it was 
something interesting to share!!

Last weekend I attended State of Divinity put on by Inner Circle.  
Knowing full well that I was running the risk of a terrible party (met 
all the requirements for the "you know it's going to be a terrible party 
when..."), I decided to be adventurous and check it out anyway.  

The dj line-up was amazing, the map point was at F8, and they only charged
$10.  At first glance it seemed like a nice party, everything seemed to 
be pointing towards that.  It was held at Pier 66 in the city.  I think 
there has been another party there, but I'm not sure.  The place it was 
held in was a boat storage place, I think.  It was a really neat place.  
There was lots of outdoor space.  They had built a fire and were 
projecting video clips (saw MLK once) on another building.  The darkness 
hid all of the industrial waste, and left, in its place, a serene night 
over a sparkling bay.  You could see city lights reflecting off of the 
water, and the dark imprints of the many boats surrounding the area added 
to the surreal effect.

The building where the party was had the main dance area opened to the 
water.  I imagine it's where they work on the boats because up above 
there was a balcony.  This dance area was like a huge hall and people 
kept walking through it, which was annoying because it was hard to 
dance.  But, seeing the water and the lights as you danced was really 
nice, albeit a bit cold later on!! Further back, there was a smaller, better 
lit room with more dj's.  There was also a wonderful chill room that they 
had decorated with lots of black lights and posters and a couch, and a cool 
oriental rug.  There was also a dj in the chill room, and the music was 
really nice.  In the two dance rooms, there were a couple lazers, and the 
sound system was good.

So, *physically* it had the makings of a nice party.  However, the party 
had no soul.  I guess you could call this "no vibe," but, honestly, no 
soul is what it felt like.  I knew this from the beginning when we heard 
one of the drug dealers say, "Cool, everyone is going to be high 
tonight!" as they supplied to the demand!

"Oh well," I thought, "a party is only what you make of it!"  I was with 
two female friends, and we were determined to have a wonderful time!  
However, as the night went on, that lack of soul really was hard to 
overcome.  

In the small room no one but a couple of breakdancers (admittedly very 
good!) were going off.  I really like that room better than the other one 
that was open to the outside because the music was better, and it was 
better lit.  But, it was the age-old dilemma of no one would dance 
because no one else is dancing.  The three of us just started dancing, 
and, sure enough, people trickled in.  It was fun being the first 
ice-breakers, but we were really determined to get some vibe going!!

As the party progressed, I looked around me for happy faces, but found 
NONE.  The place was filled with *takers*, people who demand a good time, 
but aren't willing to give of themselves to have a good time.  They just 
take and take and take, and expect to be entertained.  This was all a 
learning experience for me, and something I am happy to have 
experienced.  What they didn't realize, and maybe something that I 
didn't realize before this, was that you have to give of yourself to 
receive.  The more you give, the more you receive.  

Giving can be in the simplest way; all it takes is enjoyment and 
expression of your enjoyment.  I honestly felt sorry for the dj's because 
they were giving of themselves (the music), and putting work into their 
sets, and all the crowd could do was take, in a "give-me-more" kind of 
attitude.  Talk about no appreciation.  Seeing this around me really 
opened my eyes to this situation and I guess to "vibe" in general.  

Not willing to give up, and sure *I* wasn't trying hard enough, I went 
around trying to talk to people, or ask them for water, or anything.  I 
was just met with blank stares.  No one was friendly at all, no one 
wanted to chit-chat about the party or if they were enjoying themselves.  
It was really strange, and I felt a deep sadness for a group of people 
who couldn't reach in themselves to find what they were looking for!  (I 
hope I am not over-generalizing by saying "group."  If any of you folks 
were out there, I was desperately looking, but didn't find you!!!)

My experiences in the chill room are even worse.  I was hanging out with 
my two friends, and we were partaking in ordinary chill room type 
activities: hugging, talking, drawing on ourselves with flourescent 
markers!!!  All of a sudden, I felt a weird feeling, and I turned around 
because I was facing away from the door.  Looking behind me I saw 3 or 4 
*huge* men.  They were obviously gangsters, and not just the people  
who dress like that because it is in (please, excuse me again, I am not 
trying to stereotype or offend:).  One of them looked at me, and said, 
"Look, bitches!"  Now, if that isn't enough to frighten someone, I don't 
know what is.  We felt really threatened at that point, and quickly got 
our stuff together and found a small dark corner to hide in.  We didn't 
see those guys again, thank god, and we weren't willing to give up just 
yet, so we stayed.  One of the reasons they pointed us out in the chill 
room, is that we were the only people having fun.  We were lost in our 
own world, and I guess, in retrospect, were making somewhat of a 
spectacle of ourselves in that situation.  No one else was hugging, nor 
did it appear that they were having an iota of fun.  When you stand out 
in a chill room for appearing happy, something is wrong!!!

After that experience we went back to the small room to await Tracy, 
because that's who we had wanted to hear all night.  When she finally 
came on, she was able to get maybe 1/2 hour into her set, and then the 
electricity went out!!  I think the whole block went out!!  At that point 
all signs pointed to LEAVE, which we did.

The party had such potential, but the crowd was horrible.  Finally, I had 
seen an example of how intricate the relationship is between the music 
and the people.  This place had the former, but not the latter.

Anyway, I do have to say that *in spite of* everything, I still managed 
to have an amazing time with my friends.  It was an evening I wouldn't 
have changed for the world, and I actually enjoyed myself quite a bit.  
Besides, I love learning experiences!!

I had a great time at the 420 party (amazingly beautiful spot) and also a 
wonderful time sharing dances with Brendan, Jess, Sarah, Nancy, and some 
others at Progress.  The jungle room didn't seem to attract too many, but we 
gave it our all.  Right Jess?!  I'll most likely be at Mad tonight 
(Rok-do you hear me?!!) so I hope to see some of you there :)

luv,
kc

Hi Brian and SFR...

(This comes not as an official missive from HotWired, but as a blatant
self-promotion by me exclusively.)

We have lots of interesting RealAudio clips, in both 14.4 and 28.8
versions. We have an interview/DJ set with Derrick May and Jon Williams
that was broadcast live this last Feb 29th. at:

Subject: NON-RAVE: Frisbee golf?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hi all,

Well, I just returned from one of my weekly sojourns down to LA, and one day
some friends took me out to play frisbee golf.  I had quite a good time.
There's something rather relaxing about a sport played in the park on
Saturday afternoons, with several of the participants carrying 40's or
various smoke-ables around the playing field.  So my question is, are there
any frisbee golf courses in the SF area?

Thankya much,
Jake

Subject: LA Blew my Mind - Much LOVE in the family
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

I gotta say I had the best road trip to LA in a long time due mostly to
LOVE on Saturday night.

The last time I went to a party in LA was two years ago.  Bad vibe, lots a
speed and very acidy hard core music. No fun and since then I hadn't been
back because I love SF so much.  Well... this all chanbed Sat. night.

The saturday 420 party was postponed because the access road was, well,
unaccesable :(.  I got to Santa Monica and couldn't get a hold of anyone I
wsa supposed to met down there.  Stranded, I called Kevin on the SOCAL
RAVES list and hooked up with him.  Thanks Kevin, I don't know how I would
ever of found anything down there with out your help.  After dinner we went
to LOVE which combined with RaveRats to create a bigger party...

I felt like a newbie - strange town, new people, new location.. I didn't
know what to expect.  Went to a back alley map point for this one (I'm so
used to going to F-8, Housewares, established front door locations for
tix).  Right off, people were cool - wishing a good trip.  The location - a
mall.  WOW! the promoters for LOVE secured a section of a mall and set up
three sound systems - up stairs down stairs and the main love room- with
plenty of bass I might add - Yeah!  For 15 duckets you deffinetly got what
you pay for - Lasers, Lighting, good visuals, execllent space, great dj
line up, great people....It's monday and my mind is still flipped about
this.

Got there about 10:30 - 11  Most memorable Djs =3D Right when I got theere
Alison was upstains and just brought me home.  Her set reminded me of many
a SF styled dj's, great stuff.  Thomas Micheal was the shit - got me movin'
most of his set, Sky Lab 2000 (live) - excellent - I love to hear music but
when you see it created it's just that much better, Trance - heard him
before and he's never disapointed me, just great trance, and SF's own
Graeme was a fav of mine too.  There was so much more I just can't list
them all.

Vibe - couldn't be better. Left and right I was meeting people, shakin'
hands, givin' hugs, just reminded me of the old skool days in SF.  I say
old skool cuz only parties like Chrystalis, Harmony, Gathering and others
bring out such an excellent vibe now.  For the size of this party, it went
off.  Every one seemed like they belonged there and everyone was equil.  No
circle dancers, no showing off, no frontin', just great people having a
great time.

I met a lot of SOCAL RAVERS-
Kevin - thanks for helpin' me out and introducing me to soooo many people.
Keep in touch.

Kidee- you got so much energy, nice to met you,

Robert-  saw you blowin' those huge bubbles, and I love your mind gear.
Where did you get em'

Mason- excellent make up

uhhmmm... I know there's a few more but I can't remember sorry I guess when
you take in so much info, love and energy your head can only handle so
much.  This doesn't include all the wonderful people not on the list that I
met but LA's got their shit together.  Memorable stuff- ooohhh the whistes,
ooohhh the whistles, I know now what you guys mean about bass worshipers -
in SF everyone centers around the dj but at this party every one centered
around the speakers and hardly anyone crowds the dj - its all good you
might have seen me right up front too.

All in all excellent party. There's no place like home but i can't wait
till I go down again.

                Austin

 PS When I move down to San Luis Obispo I now have a very tuff decesion -
Do I drive 3.5 hrs to SF to party on sat or 3 hrs to LA?

I'd like to clarify a few things about Movement's entering the space that 
MAD is leaving.  First of all, I should say that I don't really know the 
details of this myself;  I'm speaking for my friend Julio Feferman (DJ 
Julio), who doesn't have an e-mail account.  I saw the posts from 
Starchild and Joe, so I called Julio to ask what was up.  This is what he 
told me:

It is unfortunate that MAD is moving out;  the reasons would best be 
explained by Joe et. al (I think Joe's post began to do that).  Movement 
is supportive of the scene as whole, and hopes that MAD will continue to 
do the excellent job they have done in the past.  Hopefully, this will 
just enrich the scene by bringing more variety.  The compromises were 1) 
don't play too loud and 2) maintain a good rapport with the house.  Bahia 
Cabana is a great space, and it should be preserved.

Let me just say personally that I hope Movement can live up to MAD's 
tradition at Bahia.  I don't know Joe Rice, but he did spin a few years 
ago at an event  called Overdrive at the Claremont Colleges (where Julio 
and I both went) organized by our friend Mark Stracha, and he kicked ass. 
 Best of luck to MAD at V/SF!

Jim

Actually, one of my best friends is from Vegas, and he bought his favorite
article of clothing there.  A black velvet shirt for $6.  And as far as
clothes go, it kicks some serious ass.  If clothes can do that, I mean.

Frisbee golf is similar to regular golf, except that you throws a
frisbee instead of hitting a ball with a club. You starts at a "tee",
and throw the frisbee towards the "hole", which is actually a round
metal basket surrounding a pole. Repeat until you land your frisbee in
the basket. Scoring in both games is similar.

Serious frisbee golf players use specially designed disks that are
somewhat heavier, and more wind-resistant, than your standard Whammo
Frisbee. They often have a collection of several disks they play with,
each having distinct travel, weight, and accuracy
characteristics. This is analogous to a golfer carrying a bag of
clubs.

The great thing about frisbee golf is that the low risk from being hit
by a flying disk allows golfers to share their courses more easily
with other park visitors. However, this can add to the number of
hazards you must face in play. :)

 Austin - right on! _Love_ was a really, really fun party. I was in LA to 
visit my girlfriend, and it was the highlight of our weekend.
 The LA scene does seem to have a lot more 'speaker tweakers' than I've 
seen in SF, and they are so much fun! They are all really into the music, 
and help keep everyone's energy level way up all night. There is one guy in 
particular called "Baby Hardcore" that I've seen in action twice now; at 
_Dune_ and now _Love_. He's usually dangling off the side of the speaker 
stacks with his tongue hanging out, urging everyone on, and just 
generally going fucking insane. The best thing is that he's not at all 
interested in being the "show", just helping everyone get as crazy as he 
is. If I were a hardcore DJ, I would PAY Baby Hardcore to do his thing 
during my sets. In my mind, he is what all those("one two, one two") MCs who 
rap along with Jungle DJs want to be; minus the ego.
The image of these guys (and girls), their hands on each other's shoulders,
surging back and forth towards the stacks is one I'll always remember. It
almost looks like some crazy sport, except everyone's on the same team - 
and everyone wins! right on.

In short, the LA scene is one worth checking out. I've met some really 
nice, friendly SOCAL people, and the rave scene seems much less "LA" than 
most of Los Angeles.

We (MAD) were at Bahia last monday night to make sure folks knew we had
moved MAD. It was quite obvious that Bahia's management was hoping that
ravers, being just so many ignorant cattle, wouldn't  notice the difference
between MAD and (whatever); they even had a dj there, and at one point, a
man who appeared to be the "promoter" came out  and asked us where all the
people that usually show up were. ??? Alas, they couldn't even get the
sound system to work so it's probably a good thing that the folks that did
show up looking for MAD weren't so easily duped.

That's putting the friendly face on it. From a different perespective,
Bahia has proved unwilling to change their print advertising, and are in
fact still advertising MAD as being there on monday nights.

Sleazy, which is about how I rate movement putting "Replacing MAD..." on

Subject: Is discussing sexuality offensive/NRR?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I am very sorry that this thread ("Orgies/Redefining Sexuality") has upset
people.  But please read this because because I really feel misinterpreted.

The topic of sexuality at raves had already been raised.  The reason why I
brought up the "orgy" I attended (although I specified it was primarily
sensual, not sexual) was to illustrate what a healthier, more consensual
type of "sexuality" might look like in a group setting - to add a new
notion of sexuality to the questioning of mainstream values that goes on in
raving.

I strongly believe that what we are doing in the rave scene is exploring
our identities, our society and our notion of community.  Implicit in that,
I believe, is a questioning of the hierarchical gender order that
undergirds our society - ESPECIALLY evident in mainstream sexuality.  When
people express discomfort with "sex" at raves, I believe it refers to what
we have come to think of as "sex" - nasty come-ons, leering, casual sex
with strangers.  I was trying to bring up the idea of a transformation of
our idea of sex to include sensuality (rather than focus on
intercourse/objectification).  This concept of sex, I wrote in my post,
incorporates FEMALE sexuality (which I believe is more sensual, less
inclined to have meaningless encounters).  This new idea that is equal
female-male sexuality rather than the current male-oriented definition has
revolutionary potential for our society.

I did not feel this topic advocates overt sex or is NRR.  I did not mean an
orgy at a rave.  I was trying to expand the discussion of whether there is
sexual energy at raves, etc., to a new definition of sexuality - one based
on peace, love, unity and respect!

For many of us raving has been an all-encompassing journey where we have
learned MANY lessons about our lives.  How can we say our attitudes toward
sexuality are not affected by what we learn there?  This thread was not
pornographic - no-one offered graphic detail of sex acts or propositioned
people.  It was an exploration on the role of sexuality IN RAVING.

Peace to you all, and apologies again to any who are offended --
Nancy

>From my personal experience I seem to have two very distinct styles of
dancing.

The first would be a more self-conscious and more overtly sexual kind of
dancing. The kind of dancing when you go to a disco and do all the right
moves and try and be the most attractive and sexy person on the dance
floor - MTV style.  I
think I am able, at least in some degree, to pull off this kind of dancing
although I've never enjoyed it and until I discovered the Grateful
Dead and then Raves I considered myself someone who HATED DANCING.  It's
sort of marginally fun to attract sexual attention to oneself but in no
way compares to the ecstatic experience of dancing style #2.

The second kind of dancing which I do at raves is not exactly
devoid of sexuality but IS devoid of self-consiousness (at least when I've
caught the groove and things are flowing well).  I probably look stupid to
the uninitiated with limbs flying every which way and body writhing in a
seemingly uncontrolled fashion.  However, this is the kind of dancing that
made me change my mind and decide that I am in fact someone who LOVES
DANCING at least when there's enough room to and permission of the
group for me to truly let go. 

So the point is that my sexuality is probably present in both styles of
dance but in the second it is un-self-consious and so if someone perceives
me being sexual in my dancing then that's cool because that's the real
me and the uninhibited me.  We are all sexual beings and our sexuality
will show up in all our acitvities -especially ones which directly involve
us moving our bodies.

Wow!  I had a great time at progress.  It was so much fun to meet sfravers
- Brendan, Renaud, Nancy, Kirsten (and cool friends), Crunchman - and to
see some friends Paul, Sarah, Steve et al.  

I love trance, I love techno, I love jungle, I love dancing.  I have a big
smile on my face still... I hope it lasts until the weekend,

and I (although I may be alone in this) like minimal lighting.  A black
light suffices for me.   It helps me stay connected to the people and the
music when I'm not also being overloaded on the visuals even though that
can be fun too.  I like it when the main lighting event consists of
dancers in their glowing clothing.  

So... anybody going to F8's 1st beach party of the year?  I went to their
last of last year and it was really sweet.  We are so lucky to live in a
place where outdoor parties can happen so much of the year.  I want to go
and dance in the moon light with the sound of the waves mixed in with the
trancey beats.  Who's coming with me???

Nancy, I know you got a lot of flack for your messages but I have to say
that I find your point of view both refreshing and well thought out.  I
think you have a very right on attitude about sex - positive and feminist
in its stance.  Thank you for being willing to voice your opinions.

        I got it; did anyone else get it?  Apparently some did not.  Nancy,
you have no need to apologize.  If anyone was offended, IMHO that means
that they are too uptight, or perhaps not comfortable with their own
sensuality/sexuality.  Your point is valid and very important to raising
conciousness, which is a healthy and necessary thing for individual growth.
That individual growth contributes to the growth of the community as a
whole, as it helps us to understand ourselves and each other.
        Thank you, Nancy.  Thank you very much!  :)

In shining armor,

- E

Whatever you do, do it well!

In Santa Cruz there is a frisbee golf course at De La Viega county golf 
course.  I think it's free, but I'm not absolutely sure.  If you want to 
find it, get a map of Santa Cruz or call information and then talk to the 
people at the clubhouse in the golf course. It's a nice course to play in 
and not that far from the Bay Area, well, sort of far, but it might be 
worth it.

Subject: Progress Review

Precedence: bulk

Disclaimer: opinionated personal review to follow, including views on how
to throw a party and what sort of music I like.  Be forewarned!  ;)

I'm glad to see that so many SFRavers had such a good time at Progress.
That makes me feel a little guilty about this review, but in fact I thought
it was quite mediocre.  (I have come to have high expectations of a party -
maybe that's the culprit).

This was a minimalist rave.  The space was good, nice and clean, but it was
devoid of any decoration.  There were just dark, dark rooms with music (and
very little lighting).  There wasn't even a chill room! (Where water was
sold, there was a couch - but that's it!).  I was disappointed with that.
I like candles and incense and bean bags and posters.  I'm spoiled, yes.  I
want to see love in a party.   I _have_ heard good things about the woman
who throws this party, I mean no disrespect to her, and I like the
spiritual basis - but that part was only on the flier and voicemail.  There
was absolutely nothing at the actual party to remind people of the REASON
behind it all - I really was expecting a bit more emphasis on that.

Security was a bit tough, too - searching everything and projecting a
controlling vibe, and patrolling the party.  (I am ambivalent here - I
dislike the vibe this introduces, but do recognize the safety it brings).
Combined with the absolute austerity of the environment, the effect for me
was alienating.

So that left just music, and people.  Three rooms - hardcore trance (insert
orgasmic happy face here), jungle (tiny tiny room - testament to jungle's
underrepresentation in SF!) and house.  Nice to have variation - props to
Jane on that.  I stayed in the trance room.  Here I was piqued by the
scheduling of Ethan to end at 12:30, and the fact that Mars had gone on
first (at 9!).  (I  have become quite an opinionated little raver - even to
having definite opinions about when certain dj's should spin!)

Ethan and Mars are two of my FAVORITES, because they spin that incredible
energy trance.  I think they are two for the prime dancing hours, which in
the rave world are from about 1 to 4am.  I got there at 12 to hear the last
of Ethan, who absolutely went off (as usual).  The energy was building so
high, and then Jon Santos and Serge followed.  They are both very good at
what they do, but (until the end of Serge's set), the trance became
minimal, a lot of repetitive beats with some tripped out effects.  I found
a lot of this undanceable, but it WAS very enjoyable to LISTEN to.
However, I really wanted to dance and was frustrated by that.  There was
nary a hoot or a yell from the crowd for hours.  I didn't feel that group
vibe, that high energy, until Serge finished off with the driving, dancing
trance stuff.

I realize this is very personal taste which colored the party for me.  But
the crowd was not really responding either, and I have discovered that I am
absolutely dependent on the group high.  I fucking LOVE it when everyone
starts screaming and jumping up and down and the energy goes sky-high.
This is directly proportional to the music played.  I like a crowd-pleasing
dj, and I want one at the height of the night.  Is that too much to wish
for?

We left at five (unbelievably early for me).  Oh, we still had fun (ALWAYS
have fun at a rave!), but it wasn't special - the five of us were in
complete agreement.  Getting home in time to relax in the hot tub with my
raverboy as the sun rose was special, however :).

I was glad to meet more of you - hello Jess (great dancing!), Sarah,
Brendan ("drugless 99"), Renaud!   We will meet again (most likely on the
dancefloor!).  Hey Wayne, where were you?  Thought you were supposed to
work there...?

Bye all,
Nancy

Wow, I didn't expect to stir up such controversy my first week on the 
list.  Ethan, we put "Movement takes the place of MAD" for two reasons:  
First, we wanted people to recognize that the location was the same.  
Second, we wanted to make it clear that MAD wasn't there anymore, so we 
wouldn't be doing what you're saying the club owner is doing--making it 
ambiguous as to whether MAD is still there so he can ride off of what you 
built.

I've never met the club management--if they won't change their ads, 
that's bullshit.  One thing I do know is that Julio is for real and you 
should meet him before calling him sleazy.

There's one at the Berkeley Aquatic Park, across the freeway from the
marina.  If you're lucky you'll be able to rave and golf at the same
time!

Stanford's campus has a well known official course as well through the
campus which you can get a map to.  It is a very wacky one I must  warn
involving things such as the QUad and certain sculptures on campus.

Well, my take on it is that dancing shouldn't really be qualified as "sexual" 
or "non-sexual".  As with most things, IMHO, it's never really just one way or 
the other.  For me, rather, I'd have to agree with what Tom said a while back, 
that dancing doesn't come from sexual energy or vice versa, but rather both 
come from the same source of energy.  Therefore, while one does not come from 
the other, the two are still related without actually being dependent on each 
other.  For me, that one energy source seems to fuel both.  Therefore dance can 
be a very sensual experience without actually being a sexual experience, at 
least for me.  That energy makes it feel good to just move your body, whether 
it be dancin or boffin! :)

Well, I hate to tell you this...but in less than a month (5/20)
I leave this beautiful country to go back to my native country,
Sweden. And although I've subscribed to this list for more than
6 months, I still haven't attended ANY events in the bay area,
and I haven't met any of you. =( That's why I'm asking you all
for help. I want to party lots and lots these last 28 days, and
YOU are the people who can help me figure out what to do and 
where to do it! =) So, if anyone has a suggestions for what I
can do, please let me know! Thanks!

reeeeespect, jonas

p.s. Oh yeah, I guess I should tell you that according to my ID,
I'm only 19 years old. (I'll be 20 on 5/22, and my b-day is one
of the reasons I'm going home!)

Hi!
 As someone who regularly throws or helps throw parties I can relate to 
the feeling of "gimme gimme" with no return or help. But one can only 
keep trying since I do know that I'm reaching and touching some folks out 
there. Most important is the grace it takes to learn from and enjoy those 
moments that are not sought or desirable. If only more folks could learn 
to apply this perspective we would really be rockin'  =)
 Very nice post Kirsten  :) I really enjoyed reading about your experiences!

...and you'd better watch out because my doggie is definitely gonna get 
your frisbee!!!

Anyone interested can check out frisbee golfers in action at Aquatic 
Park in Berkeley that runs alongside 80 from University to Ashby. There 
was a sunset party there last year =-)

Love Lydia, Stephan

My God!
I have seen the light. I can only hope and pray that someday I am as free 
and uninhibited as the rest of you are. I'm going to go cry into my 
chastity belt now... if I am ever as cool as you guyz I will just get 
down on my knees and have an orgasm. I have obviously learned nothing in 
my 4 years of going out to parties. Silly me, just going out to dance. I 
obviously don't know what is going on. 
:-P!

Frisbee golf is played just like regular golf,  except the "Holes" are
baskets with chains hanging over a flat top that "catches" the frisbee
when tossed into it.   If you hit it squarely in the middle,  it will
catch the frisbee,  but if you miss,  it will glance off.   Golf frisbees
have evolved into these things that are smaller and heavier and look a lot
like a discus.   There are 18 "holes" with "hazards" like the Bay,  marshes,
thick brush and other inaccessabe areas you can lose your frisbee in.

My frisbee glows in the dark,  and I remember losing it one time,  and
returning in the night.   Using a spolight,  I was able to locate it by
shining the light around,  because when light strikes it,  it glows
brighter.   It was under a small stream.

Each hole is marked with a "Par" and some are more difficult than others.
I highly recommend it.    In fact,  several raves were held there,  like
the summer Solstice last year,  but nobody noticed the "holes" or
wondered what they were....   :-)

The Daytime party was really GREAT,  although the weather was cool and
partly cloudy,  I managed to get a ride with a non-raver friend who
dropped me off ad picked me up later.

The location was primo,  by this lake near Novato,  and totally inaccessable
unless you had a car.   I got there late (Around 4 pm) and the music was
really good.  Galen spun,   and another dude in dreads spun the sickest
trip-hop style set that was quite interesting to dance to...  then later
on,  spun some jungle until Buck went on.    Then,  galen went back on
to finish the party...   I would say about 250 - 300 people showed up,
but it's remote location made it hard for the city folks to make it.

It was free (Except the parking or park fees of $5),  but with a car full,
it was a bargain.   I heard they got a permit,  as the park rangers were
really cooperative and supportive.

Friday night and it's time to DANCE....

So we head out to catch "All in the Family", put on by In Touch Prods., the 
same fine folx that brought you the "Planet Rock Strikes Back" rave at the 
Home Base in Oakland.  Map point: Ameba.  Immediate problem: the space was 
busted.  As we arrive at Ameba, everyone is hanging out out front waiting 
for a new space to be determined.  The folks at Ameba were getting 
frustrated with the mob that was being generated out front, the cops were 
cruising past keeping an eye on us, and the crowd just kept getting bigger.

Not good.

Now, I have a little question I'd like to pose to the group at large.  A 
rumor was going around that some other promoters had the party busted.  
Those promoters are on this list.  Anyone have any input, pro or con, 
regarding this rumor?  I don't find the rumor hard to believe since I've 
come away with the impression that these promoters are far more interested 
in the dollar than in a quality event (they are NOT in Martin's league), as 
evidenced by every event I've ever been to that they put on.  There is never 
a good vibe.  There's only fair music, poor lights, and as many people 
*crammed* into a space as it will hold.  

Is it just me that sees something evil in a "rave promoter" that would get 
other raves busted?  I have their names, but I'd rather not say who it is 
until I see solid evidence.

Well, just when things were starting to get a little tense, a new location 
was found.  After attending one horrible party there and one really 
fantastic party there, I had mixed emotions about going to the deli on 
Jerrold.  Turns out there was already a hip hop party going that wouldn't 
adjourn until 1:30am.

And off we went to a rave on Howard St.  I don't know what this party was 
called (anyone know?), but it was pretty cool.  It was more trip hop/jungle 
than anything else.  Underground, low budget, nicely done, very small crowd, 
good vibe.  The problem was, my crew was just not that into the music, so we 
left after about an hour to head back to the deli -- just in time for the 
party to begin!

And I beheld the party, and saw that it was good...

Donald Glaude was all the way ON!  That man was tearing it up!!  Folx, this 
guy is one of the DJs I look for now.  He does more than just spin an 
incredible set, he puts on a show.  The guy that followed was also dynamite, 
but I didn't catch his name.  Could it have been Buck?  The lighting was 
good, the visuals were decent this time, and the A/C was on -- huge relief 
there...  Not too many people.  Only the diehards would wait until 2am for a 
party to *start*.

My one complaint: The price.  $15 for a party that started at 2am.  Not 
good.  And from  what I understand, it was not the promoter's fault.  In 
fact, due to the reduced attendance, he lost money.  Rather than give him a 
price break, the owners of the space gave him the space from 2am to 10am.  

I think we can chalk this up to the greed of the owners of that space, 
something I've heard from other people that have participated in putting on 
parties there.  I saw the promoter having a chat with someone who appeared 
to be one of the owners or a representative of the owner.  And it was not 
exactly a friendly chat.  In fact, I really thought there'd be a fight right 
there in the front lobby.  Well, kudos to the promoter for putting up with 
that crap to bring us what turned out to be a pretty decent party.  I hope 
this doesn't put him off of promoting entirely...

So anyway, I'll be waiting for the next "All in the Family" knowing that, 
even in the face of dire evil owners and villainous rival promoters, it will 
not disappoint!

but they didn't!

they made us leave at 6ish, which wuz *way* too early, just cuz up til
then the party was so sweet.  and for some reason we only had to pay 10
bucks--$2.50/hr was definitely worth it.

I think john is commenting on people who are putting their own enjoyment
ahead of everyone else's.  John is opinionated tis true but most of the
bravado is limited to the list (which needs some shaking up from time to
time IMHO) as far as the dance floor is concerned, I think he's right.
I have no problem with people errecting altars, lying down, standing,
circle dancing, etc. just don't do it in the middle of the dance floor.
If you are doing this, I think it's more about people SEEING YOU then about
any communal or spiritual experience

Yes, that's the problem I have with circle dancers, and why I've been
skeptical as to whether they're in it for fun and artistic expression, or
for being in the limelight.  I guess both are true.
And yes, there needs to be room for all of us to dance, especially those
who flail about and need more space!

Ok, this makes me really mad.  First, for the promoters and those that 
attended, that the owners only provided the space for four hours.  Second,

Ok, this makes me really mad.  First, for the promoters and those that 
attended, that the owners only provided the space for four hours.  Second,

I too am one who was very self conscious about dancing until I
discovered raves...

I remember those high school dances of 15-odd years ago (oh god, I'm
getting old), with lots of disco and new wave, strobes, and flashing
gel spotlights. I was only slightly trained in any of the fad steps of
the day, and dancing for me was simply expressing the music through my
body. There were those moments when my partner and I were the only two
on the dance floor, and everyone else seemed soooooo uninspired...

Somehow, I lost that feeling during my college days, and dancing for
me degenerated into that body exhibitionism, demonstrating the right
moves. I recall that breakdancing was getting really popular around
that time. I lost interest, and stopped dancing at all venues, except
at concerts, where everyone was focused on the band, and no one was
looking at each other. Two concerts that particularly come to mind
were Skinny Puppy and Ministry (around 1988), since both had an
incredible vibe present. [I didn't consider myself physically brave
enough to endure slamming at hardcore shows, although I attended them,
too.] 

The few times I attended crowded dance clubs in New York City while I
lived there, I really hated the dancing, and would often drink lots of
alcohol to deaden my mind and the experience. [I retch from just
thinking about those scenes.] I rarely danced at small parties,
because I knew everyone was looking at me, and I couldn't deal with
the attention.

At my first rave, my friend Jerry told me to close my eyes, feel the
music, and let my body react naturally to it. When I did this, I
discovered my body moving in ways I never imagined, and felt really
turned on! I now use this practice whenever I feel self-conscious at a
party or rave -- it works every time.

The sensation of letting every thought in my mind go, and letting my
body take over to the beat, is what attracts me to raves the
most. Having a scene where no one cares how I look, dress, or dance,
contributes in a big way.

I would just like to point out that being in my late thirties, and having
facial hair, and long wacky hair does not make me a non raver........while
I may not be a drunken stewbum, its descriptions of  this kind that upset
me because there is no age, or drug, or alchahol perameters that make up a

should I shave and lie about my age, to be accepted as a "raver", should I
only wear baggy pants and a t-shirt to be a raver.......should I only do
the accepted raver drugs...........I've seen many a drunk raver, I've seen
many an old raver, and I've seen many a stubbled raver....... 
 
so I ask you to be more careful in describing a person who turned you off
as a (phseudo) raver, you could inadvertanly insult a fellow human being
who shares some of the same qualities of life as you........moonpup

Last night I made a rare mid-week club excursion to witness the double whammy
of Dave Clarke's 2nd (3rd?) U.S. appearance and Mad's slick new space.  The
space is indeed slick as hell, reminiscent of a Latin disco from some Al
Pacino
movie, replete with red vinyl wrap-around booths and courtesy telephones.  Of
course the more relevant amenities included 6 (?) intellibeams, dataflash
strobes, other lights I can't really describe, and a fat healthy sound system,
bass booming at your feet, mids and highs hanging above your head.  Wandering
around the space, I found the upstairs/downstairs chill room, the tripped-out
flourescent-explosion pool room, and the outdoor patio (nice!).  Definitely a
classy joint, the only major drawback being the 21+ policy, still a problem
for
a wee lad like me.

The crowd was definitely a different set.  I missed the energy of some of the
younger kids (no offense to you old fogies!).  ;)  But all that was forgotten
when the red man Dave Clarke threw down.  What a set!  It has been soooo long
since I've heard music like that at a party: fast (140++), minimal, fun
techno,
almost reminiscent of the sort of stuff you'd hear at 4 a.m. at early hardcore
"raves" in '92.  And Dave tore up those turntables, cutting records fast as
hell, working it true midwest style.  He did this one trick where he had two
records going, but they were out of sync by half a beat, so he'd cut them back
and forth, creating this crazy breakbeat out of two four-on-the-floor techno
records.  Then he would grab one record, pull one of the beats back, scratch
it
for one beat, and then drop it back in on beat, then do it again and drop it
back in so that they were off by a half-beat again.  Describing it doesn't
really do it justice.  I'm not really sure too many people really got off on
it
the way I did either.  I heard some people saying that he kept breaking the
"groove" by doing shit like that.  Oh well.  I guess some SFers are too well
fed on slow geriatric mixes that last two minutes.

Anyway, it was a fun night.  The space is cool, but I hope perhaps a search
continues for an 18+ location.

Nancy, I think it took a lot of courage to tell us about your experiences
in the light of what societal conditioning has done to some people. In general,
I believe in the slogan "Fight Sexism, not Sex".  To those that were offended
by Nancy's post, I'm sorry that you feel the way that you do, and I can
understand that you feel that way, but I don't think that Nancy's self
expression
was impinging on your rights or on the rights of the group. If you felt that
the post was inappropriate you can always hit delete (something I do a lot of).

Well our society is male dominated that's for sure, not sure that it would be
any better if it were female dominated, but we definitely need more balance.
This reminds me of a party I went to a few weeks ago called :The rebirth of the
Goddess" where Female sexual/sensual energy was in full effect! It went _way_
beyond mere issues of groping, come_ons, and physical contact, many of the women
who participated were truly transformed into _goddesses_ (not just sex
goddesses)
and the level of sex/sensuality was clearly raised an octave. In this
environment, I noticed that the men in the room were in awe, they realized
that they had to opperate at a level beyond simple physical objectification.

There is tremendous sexual energies at raves (at least the parties that I like
to go to :) In fact, one of my laments is that the energy has decreased over the
years. (Some of my fondest memories were the basement Wicked @1015 on friday
nights starting at 2:00am, where you had sexuality totally across the spectrum
all "cuming-together" in one hot-house sweat-box, many a person use to "see the
light" at those parties :)  Sex, like eating, is a GOOD thing!, now some people
have sexual disorders, like some have eating disorders, some have special diets,
some like bland food, others like it *spicy*, some like variety some eat the
same meal(s) day in and day out.  It's all good.  People change when they
want to,
if someone offers you candy at raves, you can always refuse!

I have learned so much about myself and especially my sexuality at raves that it
isn't funny. I think people tend to be way too in their heads about this stuff
and could do well to follow the age old axiom...

Hi, Nancy. I've been enjoying your posts on the list for quite some
time now...

I don't feel at all offended by your posts about orgies. In fact, I
agree with most of what you have said on the subject. This is an
important topic for discussion here, since we all have different views
on the subject, and may not be aware of them. The fact that some of us
ravers are also offended by sexual acts at parties may be absent from
the minds of those participating in the act!

If I saw a couple engaging in intercourse in the chill space at an
event, I would feel uncomfortable. However, when I see two people
kissing and touching each other in a sensual manner, it doesn't bother
me at all. [Hell, I've been involved in a few of these moments
myself!]  I feel much more sensual than sexual at raves, and I love to
explore and express that sensuality with other people. What I mean is,
while I enjoy the experience of giving and receiving touch from
another person, I never develop the urge to screw at raves.

Raves are excellent opportunities for people to explore all their
senses -- touch included. Consider the possibility that those people
who express "offense" at the subject are actually expressing their
discomfort with their own feelings about the subject. They have yet to
confront their own emotions and views on the beautiful, sensual
experiences that are often had at raves that are not sexual in
nature.

        In this scene and in all scenes, broadening out to every aspect of
life, when are men gonna realize that women are where it's at?  Women are
all goddesses, just as men are all gods, because we all spring from the
divine energy of the multiverse, and carry some of it with us in the
essence of our being.  Women are complex and special creatures in far more
ways than are men.  Women are to be revered and respected, not worshipped
or degraded.  To go a step further, everyone has value, unless he/she
devalues him/herself.  Women are still making breakthroughs in our society,
though many times they are met with resistance, and many times for no good
reason.  The human species cannot grow and develop to our maximum potential
unless men and women are encouraged to contribute unlimited.
        MHO?  Yes, but more than that.  My Viking and Celtic ancestors

Speaking from a woman's point of view in her late twenties, I'd just like
to comment and respond by saying thank you to Eric.
I'm in the multimedia field and although it is quite competitive in general
over here in Marin, I'm finding that respect is given to both sexes who
"know" their shit.  I for one have always strived to be strong and
independent.  I practice viewing people not by gender but by their skills,
talent and kindness...we are all special human beings and we should all
utilize the freedom we have to excel however we want whether we are men or
women!

Speaking of Traci Lords, will someone please explain to me why I always 
see an album by her included under the techno section.  There are lots of 
copies always.  What's up?  She isn't honestly making techno is she?

very curious,

yah, she did make an album.
Juno Reactor produced it, so that is probably why it's any good at all..

I'd have to reiterate how beautiful the spot was.  It was held on a very 
green baseball field.  The dj was under some trees (willows, possibly) 
and faced the water.  The lake is a reservoir (Stafford Lake) and the 
whole area was the brightest green ever.  It was absolutely a beautiful 
spot, and the rangers were very supportive.  When we arrived, they told 
us where it was, said it looked like a great party, good crowd, etc.  
Very friendly.  They kind of wandered around a bit during the party, but 
as far as I saw, never harrassed nor interfered with anyone.  They did 
close it up at exactly 8 pm, but that didn't really matter to me because 
they were so cool about everything else.

The music was excellent, lots of house.  To me it just seemed like the 
music was perfect for the day and the setting.  I love all kinds of 
music, but this just seemed perfect at the time!  It was really great 
dancing on soft, but firm grass.  You could really bounce!!!  Dancing on 
concrete is so hard on my body :(

The one thing I had a problem with was the nitrous tanks (which I did see 
one get confiscated at the end by a ranger).  Is it just me, or does 
nitrous turn people into greedy, selfish imps?  Nitrous is fun and all, 
but whenever I have seen it at parties, the people are always greedy 
about it.  (duh, maybe that's why it's called hippie crack!)  It is a 
strange occurance that I've seen wherever there is nitrous.  Maybe it is 
because a lot of people want to do it, and the ones who get it know 
this and can use it to their advantage?  Maybe it is its ephemeral nature 
and ppl want to continue doing it?  (maybe I am blabbering?!!)

cheers,

Oh how I love to read about everyone's experiences.  What happened at 
Gaia?  Anyone, anyone?  Bueller? Bueller?  

I saw Krista at about 4 am at Progress.  We had never heard her 
before and we really thought she was great.  The room she spun in was 
pretty empty, but when she came on, more people came to dance, although 
it was never very dense.  She was really good, spinning progressive 
house.  I will definitely look for her again.

*BEGIN*
                The Search For Happiness

        Now the day had come at last
        To put this problem in the past--
        To solve for good the question deep
        Regarding joy's eternal keep.

        From far and wide the people came,
        Each to try and make the claim--
        Each one with a different thought
        Of where this treasure should be sought.

        Some looked in vaults and mined for gold,
        Sure that money would this treasure hold.
        Others tried a far resort
        Or vacationing of a different sort.

        Still others went to parties all
        And looked in bottles short and tall.
        Some even searched through books of lore,
        For guidance to that distant shore.

        Some said it came from a simple game
        Or freedom, love, or power and fame;
        But none of these endeavors brought
        The answer to the question sought.

        For happiness cannot be seen
        In seas of blue or fields of green;
        Nor even in the star-lit skies
        Or in a loved one's sparkling eyes.

        Far more treasures hold the soul
        Than physical creation whole.
        And though those things may draw them out,
        They can't alone these treasures sprout.

        Happiness is one of these;
        The soul alone can hold the keys--
        The keys to open every door
        And let the happy spirit soar.

        Many people yet remain
        Entrapped by fear and mortal pain.
        But none need linger in the dark;
        They only lack one crucial spark:

        The key to happiness, you'll find
        Lies not on earth but in the mind.
        To understand this is to be,
        In thought and spirit, truly free.

She sure is. Her album isn't terrible (for a former porn star that is), but
it's nothing I'd recommend to my friends either. =)

She spins at clubs as well. A friend of mine saw and heard her late last year,
dunno know what he thought though. =)

Sure.  Your viking ancestors raped your celtic ancestors, i think
that could be one area where things went wrong.

I'm not sure exactly which history books you read, but there are 
plenty examples of civilizations/societies that gave a high status 
to women.  Most of them were long killed off by the
people who raped your Celtic ancestors after the Vikings,
(The Normans and Anglo-saxons.) because (esp the anglos) were
pretty good at absorbing other people's cutlures.  

Or were you only talking about European societies?

We should all respect each other.  Some people in society have been
show a lot less respect and therefore deserve more respect and consideration
because they've put up with all this disrespect for so long.
Women, making up over half of the population, are the largest
group, but there are more than a barrelful of others.

just some thoughts...

speaking of Juno Reactor:
I have oodles of songs by OTHER bands (killing joke, etc.) remixed by Juno
and they are all favorites of mine, but the Juno Reactor original stuff
I've heard (luciana) is all pretty slow, ambient stuff. Good, but totally a
step aside from Juno's usual breakneck remixes.

what gives?

does Juno Reactor *not do* trance on his/her/their own?

She got *roasted* in an issue of Xlr8r not long ago.  More by letters to
the pub than the pub itself.  They said she was very bad, and then came out
when Keoki was spinning and did shit like bend over for the audience.
"What-EVER!"

For anyone who can be in the San Jose/Santa Clara area tonight:
        Stella Luna will be performing at Cafe Leviticus, at 1445 The
Alameda, San Jose.  The number is (408)279-8877.
        Stella Luna is a musical adventure, very ambient/eerie/mysterious,
with soundscapes created by many differnent instruments.  The atmosphere of
the event is permeated by an incredible, unique, ethereal vibe, a feeling
I've never experienced from anything else.  I've seen them perform twice,
and they thoroughly impressed and satisfied me, as well as the rest of the
audience.  Dancing/trancing out is encouraged during their show.
        It's free :)  It starts at 8:43pm, and should go for a couple
hours.  One of the members is a very dear, beautiful friend named Jonathan,
and he says the band is very excited about this event.  If you can make it,
I highly encourage you to come out and experience.  You'll be glad you did!

Thanks (I'm not getting paid for this :)),

 On the Alameda, but what's the cross-streets? If you get onto the Alameda
from HW880 , do you go towards downtown SJ or towards Santa Clara?

Ooh, good point!  I believe it's toward Santa Clara, as it's north of the
downtown SJ area.  Best bet is to check a map or call the Cafe, but I am
100% certain that it is north of downtown SJ.

the problem with hippie crack is that unlike the DJ's or the equipment that
are being donated to a free event, the hippie crack owner will not just
give away his product. 
 
I've had my hippie crack days (mostly during 91' at flamable liquid in L.A.
etc...) and when I am DJ'ing for free to help create a vibe, I expected the
hippie crack dealer to donate the gas, I REFUSE to allow gas to be sold, so
one guy can make a profit off of a free vibe.......(i know, what about a
pot dealer or an e dealer etc.......) I feel that at least they don't
display there wears the way balloons do......an obvious physical entity
(like a lot of strewn around beer bottles) it's just bad
advertizing......every-one including cops can see that were all doing
drugs......... 
 
even if they are free (which is totally rare) it's a drug you can
see........being done.....it just creates a bad vibe........greedy dealers
and greedy users, those that pay get hassled by those that don't (can I
have a hit of your gas ???)  etc..... 
 
                        overall,  bad news..........moonpup

Hmmm. I'm glad you liked our performance there.. We never ever get booked

and have been doing this for two years..

Not sure why San Fran promotors ignore us..

actually, I just picked up Juno Reactor's "Beyond the Infinite" (on 4
12 inchers!), and it has some stompin trance songs as well as ambient
stuff.

Hey everyone!

My name is Graham, I've been lurking for a while getting a feel for
the list.  I currently live in Greensboro (Greensboring), North
Carolina, and am fairly active with SEraves.  What am I doing on
SFraves, you ask?  Well, some friends and I are going to come visit.
  My friends will be taking a road trip for a few weeks in may.
Unfortunately, I can't get that much time off, but I am going to fly
out to SF to meet them and check out your town.  We'd really like to
meet up with some of you and go to some west coast (especially SF)
parties.  We'll be in town May 16-20.  I hope to catch Carlos while
I'm out there, as he lights my night up every time he comes here to
the east coast.

Love from out east,
  Graham

Yeah, actually ENIT was such a disapointment (No Banco de Gaia, Sven Vath
spinning after 2 am, meaning everyone else I was with would have had to
leave because they were under 21, etc, etc) that we managed to talk the
manager of the Warfield into giving us our money back using Traci Lords'
and Keoki's sets as examples of how horrible it was. No Bass refund though,
just the ticket price, so someone still made their money. Unfortunately,
she does appear to get gigs, I know that she opened for the Thrill Kill
Kult the last time they played (as a DJ, not live)...I guess some people
think that sex appeal goes before skill.

As a completely heterosexual female, I've certainly had my share of 
crushes on women.  I love watching a beautiful female - If I see one, I 
usually watch her more than any of the guys. Like a godess among mortals....
I'm like kc, though, and have gotten to where I love watching EVERYBODY.  
Because EVERYBODY is beautiful in their own unique way.

love,
Amy

Well, ever think that SHE's not any good at all?!?!?  I would expect 
nothing more from that gutter slut piece of *trash*.  She's proved that she 
is good at only one thing - and how anyone can respect her after that is 
beyond me. If I want to hear a female dj, I would have the choice of many 
sisters who know their stuff *in dj'ing*.  Give me dj Tracey from Ameba ANY 
day over Traci Lords.

Amy

Yeah,  i thought that it was some sick mixing also.  I was talking to
one person who went to Mad last night and she was like "The scratching was
cool, but it was a bit messy, and the beats were off and all."  When i
told her that he intentionally did the off beat mixing, she was suprised
that it was intentions.  Just goes to show you that there is more to 
mixing then just puting them together flawlessly.  something id like
to see more SF dj's do.

get all hyped up beause i happend to give a desription of some of YOUR 
physical attribues as a coincidence, as it's perfectly obvious (at least 
to me) that i was describing a WINO which i assume you are not. you 
yourself are making an assumption about me which is incorrect - that i am 
not open to older people who aren't ravers.  you could not be more wrong.

major flame bait. come now, we can't go dissing everyone because of choices
they made in their past, or even for the life they live. we should accept

life, etc..

Cafe Leviticus is about 1 mile south from the Alameda exit
off of 880. It's on the right hand side right after a Shell station.
Hurry up! It's about to start.

I didn't like 420 much.  Everyone was huddled in little circles far
from the speakers.  Few dancers.  The crowd was  mostly
nitrous-huffing local youth and a few hockey-coiffed exurbanites with
nothing better to do than sit around and drink beer.  Or maybe I was
just too tired, because I didn't feel like trying to help the vibe. I
left early, maybe it improved later.   My walk in the nearby hills was
much more enjoyable.

					--Oscar Wilde


hey everyone!
i sent out a post re. the gateway party but it never made it so here goes 
again:
i thought this party went off! tho i dont get into house much, the energy 
of everyone made it a great party.. seems like everyone knew eachother, 
like a family, which is something i missed over the winter months, 
but see coming back with the return of sunset, and free outdoor parties!
summer is almost here, lets make it a good one!

lots and lots o energy,
tom

You are right, brendan-
The rational, compassionate side of me agrees with you entirely.  But 
there are some things in life that disgust me so greatly that it is 
extremely difficult to get past it.  I've been flamed about TL before on 
sfraves about a year ago, and my stance has still not changed.  Once a 
person is so severly tainted, it is hard to wash off the stain.  Sad, 
yes, but to many people, that is the way it is.  I don't care if Traci 
Lords became a saint.  I would always see her as a washed up ex porn 
queen who helped in degrading women.  Really, I do try and see the good 
in people and I give her credit for trying.  I'm sure not perfect either 
-  I sincerely try not to judge and like I said in a previous post: I try 
and see beauty in all people.  Just with someone like Traci Lords I have to 
sit down and try really really really hard to see it because it is minute 
to me. Her beauty as a human being is quite less obvious to me than with 
most people (kinda like saying a murderer is still a beautiful person, 
see what I mean?)  Hope this explains my position, and if not, well, I tried.

love,
Amy

Hi all!


	Does anyone know how many people attended these events and if they
were shut down early (e.g. the police)... If the party was large, can you 
estimate to the nearest 100?  Thanks everyone...you don't know how much 
you are helping us out...if anyone has any questions regarding ravedata 
projects two out of the three "rave info compiler's" will be at Eclipse 
in DC on Saturday...if you are unable to make it and have a question send 
it to the address below. Thanks!  
All resposes can be mailed to "ravedata@partnercomm.com"
Love-
Nicole

rather groovy day.  wanted to share it with you all.

I have to disagree with you here.  I don't find a woman doing what SHE
wants to do as degrading or trashy.  What IS degrading is for one woman to
pass judgement on another as if it were a truth and to have that woman
thrown in the proverbial trash heap because of it.  We want the rigt to
assemble and to "rave" yet we are so ready to condemn another for their
choice in profession and their proclivities?  Is PLUR only extended to
those that we find FIT in our moral paradigm?  An it harm none (I
translate this as everyone involved is consenting) do what you will.

Is beauty defined by chastity or monogamy here because if it is... I am
now officially stepping down from the "beautiful human being" category.
;)  Lump me in with the porn-queens, murderers and the like. 

All sexed up all the time

How many sex workers do you know personally, Amy?  How many porn
stars?  Do you know from personal first-hand experience that these
women are all unfit to associate with?  (My personal experience is, in
several cases, quite otherwise.)

If not, then it's that pornography (which Traci made) is itself 
degrading to women, right?

Nadine Strossen, female head of the ACLU and feminist lawyer and
warrior for the last couple of decades, has written an excellent book
named _Defending Pornography_.  I would like to discuss this book with
you... but not here.  If anyone wants to know how I feel about all
this (hah!), read this book, or email me.

Enough said: these are my last words in this thread.

ObRave: (that stands for "obligatory rave content")
...not much.  Last party I went to was Organic.  Excellent vibe all
through and through.  See you all at a Sunset soon!

Hi all,

Warning--this is very long, and really only related to raving in that 
it responds to comments about DJ Traci Lords. So disclaimer having been 
made, read at your own risk!

Obrave: hmmm, let's see. Had a great time at Nikita Friday night. 
Didn't find it too clubby, although the front room was a little scary. 
Thanks again to Sarah and Paul and your friends for bringing the vibe with you, 
thanks to Andrew for being Andrew, and thanks to the djs for playing it 
hard hard hard and FAST all night long! I love it when there's no let up 
in the music's intensity until the needle goes up for the last time and 
the lights come on. I danced til 6, which I haven't done in ages. 

See you at "Wish" May 1--Doran's spinning! 

The rest of my post is below.

Kathryn

(snip)

Well, you'll get no argument from me about whether pornography is 
degrading to women. I think it's also fairly degrading to men. Be that as 
it may, I wanted to relay something I read recently about the women who 
participate in pornography and/or prostitution, namely, that an incredibly 
high percentage of them had been physically or, more often, sexually abused 
as children. I can't remember the exact number, but I'm sure it was over 60%, 
and perhaps higher. I'll look around for the study if anyone's interested. 
Perhaps their experiences during childhood led them to feel valued only 
when they perceive themselves as sexual objects. This is not at all 
uncommon for children who have been abused, and I think the study was 
formulated around that idea.
 
I've also read Linda Lovelace's autobiography (Deep Throat) and a 
biography of SF's own Mitchell Brothers, plus other assorted materials on 
pornography. My sense coming away from all this is that, while some women 
(and men) may go into pornography willingly, many more are somehow duped 
or forced into it. Regardless of how they arrive, they are soon 
controlled by the larger interests that be. I have serious serious doubts 
about whether the actors/actresses/posers/etc. are really in control of their 
careers or most of their so-called choices. How freely did Traci Lords make 
her decisions about her body and her life? Was it she who made the 
decisions, or the lucrative Traci Lords industry that grew up around her? 
Who really has the power and the money? I'll bet Hugh Hefner has more 
money than all the Playboy bunnies combined.

Finally, I have to say that I think pornography, and other industries that 
exploit women's bodies and souls will be around just as long as we AS A 
SOCIETY exploit women's bodies and souls. By degrading women in myriad 
ways every single day, society sends the message that women are not 
valuable, that we are just bodies (and we'd better be skinny, 
big-breasted ones), that someone else has to tell us what to do, that we 
are not worth as much as men, and by extension, that we should despise 
ourselves and our sisters.  

United we stand...

A song of hers is on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack.  It actually sounded 
alright.  Better than some of the other tracks I heard from the album.  
Strange shit, huh?  I wonder if Axel Rose will be posing on her new 
album covers?

Yeah!!! I ran into two cool vibe events in Sac this weekend so i 
thought I'd share it with you-all.

1st was a decent size 420 party at a really cool guys house.  About 50 
or so people (I'm not a good estimator) and chill ambient grooves by 
different local area dj's.  The whole thing felt like one big awesome 
chill room at some Sf rave.  The vibe was laid back and friendly.  
People were having a good time and i got to meet some groovy 
individuals.  Talked with Rick from the list (about an hour long song 
with a German name).  All in all I could see what might be the 
foundation for a good scene in Sacramento.  At bigger parties too many 
fronters and hommies get in the way of the vibe but at smaller "house" 
events the energy gets concentrated and focused.  Hope to go to more 
stuff like this in the near future!


2nd event was on Sunday.  There was a really phat drum circle in Fair 
Oaks park in old town Fair Oaks.  I'd say about 50+ people were there 
hanging out on blankets while drummers went at it all day long.  It was 
so beautiful!  The energy was laid back, friendly, and without 
attitude.  It was a perfect gathering of hippies, ravers, skaters, and 
grunger/alternatives.  It seemed like the future of a Sacramento scene 
of peace, love and happiness may evolve out of an event like this that 
draws together people from different groups.  People were drinking 
(including me) but no one was out of hand or rude.  

The best part was that you can go up to the circle and grab a drum and 
start beating.  No one cared as it appeared that people brought extra 
drums to throw into the circle for whomever wanted to play.  I got 
behind some phat congos and fell into a cool groove. Can't wait to go 
again!  The drum circle happens every Sunday from sometime in the 
afternoon till the sun goes down.  As far as I can tell the locals 
don't seem to mind and it may be going on all summer (I hope).

If anyone needs directions to the park send me some mail.

Folks PLEASE be careful here because many of you know not of what you speak!
While it is very true that many women in the world (especially poor women)
are forced into the sex trade, many DO choose it willingly, in fact MANY
a young raver RIGHT HERE IN San Francisco has made money performing before
men as either "exotic dancers", "strippers", "lap dancer's", etc.  In fact it
seems like it is a rather common way for some women to make money and many
like what they are doing (for a while at lease :), in fact I'm sure many of you
out there know some of these people and can attest that they are very nice,
intelligent and MORAL people.  As far as degrading women, well some of the
women that I know stopped doing it not because they thought it was degrading
to women but because they thought it was degrading to Men, (many of which
would give them a significant amount of their paycheks each week as this was the
only source of female companionship in their life.) In fact, being the door
person at a few parties, I've been surprised at how many women in the rave
scene make at least part of their living as "dancers, hookers and hoes".
Sometimes $600+ a day (tax free) for "shakin it" is just too much for some
people to pass up. Also please remember that there is a big wide awsome
world out there in
Earth' (Earth Prime, the opposite of Cyberspace) and many things may not be what
they seem to be, perhapse if some of started talking to people outside of your
own cliques, you would discover that SOME strippers are not gutter trash at all,
some have more honesty, integrity and vibe then many of you put together.

(Don't feel bad Amy, it blew my mind when I discovered this fact as well :)

Yowsa,

HAte ex-porno stars huh?  Words were kinda harsh, but I guess that's how
you felt.

I don't buy her dreck because she's a horrbile DJ.  The rest of your
characterizations of her, are IMO, mean-spirited.  Why the vitriol?  The
girl is pure hollywood, plain and simple.  I see little difference between
what she does, and what other people have done in front of and behind the
camera.  I mean, Madonna, literally slept her way to the top, and is seen
by some women as some type of liberated soul.  Whatever...Ol Norma Kuzman
(Traci Lords), is just trying to make a buck at the music thing.  Her porn
career is over for now, she might return if this music & movie stint she's
on doesn't pan out.

I just see it as being mean for being mean's sake.  What makes you think
she's a slut?  Becuase she was on drugs at one point and made porno, or is
it that she might have actually enjoyed making porno?  Also, why is it
whenever we see women who are sexually liberated enough not to care what
anyone thinks and is sexually active & enjoys it, she's a slut, but when
guys do it, they are labelled studs or at worse womanizer?  Who the hell
came up with the notion that you should have a steady mate anyway?  There
are very few animals that are monogamous, and we KNOW that our monogamy is
a socially imposed strcuture.  Woe is the woman who would dare go against
such mores.

The longer I live, the more contradictions I see in the world.

Now mind you, I would not want any daughter or son of mine to engage in
such activites, but I would still love them and never disown them unless
they were bringing harm to others.  And calling them slut, when in fact if
you work you are somebody's whore, is a contradiction in the worse sense.
When it comes down to it, in capitalism, there is always a whore and a
pimp.  And I can tell you this, Uncle Sam is the biggest pimp around, he's
got EVERYONE working for him!  As for calling her trash, have problem with
that and other sayings that dehumanize someone, as the term trash certainly
does.

I do NOT think:
-People are never trash.  Trash is disposable.  People are not disposable!
-There is no such thing as an illegitimate child.  ALL children are legitimate!

We gotta get out of this ghetto of the mind.  It is making our world most
insane.

But then again, that is my opinion.

Peace,
John

Such as what?  Having sex for money.  Or being paid money after having sex?
Or enjoying lots of sex?

Not to cast stones, but it is the judgement of folx that taints people.
She did NOT kill anyone.  All she did was fuck.  And for that she's
tainted?  My go-d, this ain't rave, it's puritanism all over again.  So
much for sexual liberation.

>I would always see her as a washed up ex porn
>queen who helped in degrading women.

Er, IMO, she ain't washed up.  There are plenty of people who would buy any
porn movie made by her if she came back.  And from what I hear, in the
rumor mill, that is always a possibility.  After all, it can pay better
than the record & movie industry.  At least for her.  Plus, the girl really
does like sex.  Why not?  Probably becuase she's nasty or something.  Good
girls never like sex that much, huh?

>Really, I do try and see the good

The only thing she is trying to do is make a buck.  I guess it's the method
of that maddens you so?  In capitalism you are either whore or pimp.  And
we're all whores for uncle sam, at least for 4 months out of the year.

A murderer?  Did she kill someone?  Did I miss something?  Why do I get the
very strange feeling that you have something aginst porn? (Probably becuase
you made it so obvious I guess).

Let me tell you something:  Porn MAY be exploitative of women, but we KNOW
it is exploitative for men, and discriminatory too:

- Men get paid 66% of what women get paid to do porn.
- It requires the capability of the MAN to orgasm on cue.  99% of the time,
this is not faked.  A guy, to survive in that business must train himself
and be able to perform on command.  Do you know what that does to one's sex
life.  As for women, some screaming, a faked orgasm here and there, and if
you aren't really ready, there's always KY.  But for the most part, all you
have to do is be there for the camera.  Hard work...
- Men have a much shorter porn shelf life than the women (check the
expiration dates on some of these guys), AND once they are done, and choose
not to perform again, they must go out and make a living like everyone
else.  Do you think that jibes and barbs are only at women?  Do you think
any of these guys could ever go into mainstream business and become the CEO
of a very public company?
-  The guys in porn are basically machines that must be able to do any task
on cue.  They are automatons, whose sole purpose is to ejaculate in front
of the camera.

Yeah, and women are being exploited.  Please.  Exploitation is ALWAYS a
double edged sword.

People choose what they want.  As long as they do not interfere with my
right to life, liberty, and happiness, then to me, it's all good.  Making
porn is much better IMO, than all the Schwarzenbugger & Stallone movies.
I'd rather see two people fucking, than two people trying to kncok or blow
someones head off with a bazooka.

We're all exploited.

Peace,
John

I have to totally agree with Chris on this one.  My friend Russell organized
a great party.  It was for the most part all ambient. (which many of you
know just makes me so happy :) :) :)  A couple of the dj's that played were
getting thier first experience at playing in front of people, and everyone
did a great job.  Another friend of mine named Jonny (sp), spun an
incredible ambient set. He's rad cuz he's all over the place changing from
beats to ambient to world music and lots of crazy stuff, but the cool thing
about him is he makes it all flow together perfectly, which not everyone can
do.  The space, was Russell's front room, which had most of the furniture
removed except for the couch.  There was a futon matress or two on the floor
proped up against the wall, and many pillows.  The Turntables were set up
low on a coffee table type thing, and black lights lit the room.  There was
the most incredible black light painting hanging behind the dj that covered
the entire wall (about 12 feet square.  I was told by Russell that it was
painted by the same guy who does those painting for the Gathering.  It added
a really nice feel to the space.  The Sound system was perfect.  Totally
clean, really nice sound....and that is so important for ambient music.  And
last but not least, the people.  Totally cool, friendly people.  We all sat
in that same room, which wasn't very big, all night and it never felt crampt
or closed in.  The vibe was definately there.  I look forward to more
parties like this in the future, cuz they have a really personal feel to
them.  Like Chris said, the energy is more focused.

Rick

	Really? She personally went around degrading individual women, one at a
time? Or are you talking about the _opinion_ that porn somehow degrades "all women
everywhere by objectifying them"? In that case you should have said "who in my
opinion helped degrade women". I, more than many people, would have a perfect
excuse to hate sex and sex-related "degradation" (and in fact I am virtually
asexual) after growing up abused, raped several times, etc. But I refuse to
take the "easy" way out and claim that "porn" or "prostitution" is the evil
rather than the people who are unable to handle it. How nice that you are willing
to support one "vice", exstacy, while denigrating and condemning another which
doesn't interest you. In both cases the problem is not the compound/activity but
rather the people who can not use it responsibly. As a sex worker and a woman who
has done porn, I have to object to your putting down whole industries on the
basis of questionable (and equally disputed) "research" and the results of a
minority of "users" who have problems.

	That said, I would still be happy to talk to you for a bit when/if we
run across each other at a rave (about this or just friendly chat, whatever),
I'm not mad at _you_, but rather the intolerance your writing indicates. Remember,
P, _L_, U, _R_...

I think the problem with trying to assess the character of celebrities is
that we usually don't know much about their private lives or about their
inner selves.  Some are easy to read, and others have infinitely more depth
and authenticity than we could ever imagine.  It's easy to see how opinions
are formed of some people when all we know of them is what they show to us
publicly.  I'd like to think that everyone has at least one redeeming
quality; even I have my honorable moments.

I know I said I was done in this thread, but this is just a "yes!"--
I've met more than one raver sex worker, and they're among the most

I think it was Melissa who had mentioned that alot of how you view the 
world and what you get involved with depends on how you were raised as a 
child.  If there was abuse, etc.   Well, I was raised opposite.  I was 
raised viewing sex as something not good and to even wait til you are 
married.  The whole sex industry is seen as bad(in the way I was raised) - 
run by people who didn't have any respect for themselves or others.  That 
has got to have an affect on a kid and how she sees her world.  I've gotten 
past alot - but all of your comments/flames still sit uneasily with me.  I 
can't change my mind just like that.  I'm sorry for those I have made angry, 
but I was being honest with how I felt - even if some of those opinions I 
had were made out of ignorance.  (I have no interest in reading porn 
biographies - I haven't the time)  And gee, thank you so very much for 
saying I have no Love or Respect for people.  That *really* makes me feel 
good. :)
I'm not going to reply to all the private posts - I would be in front of 
this computer all day long and I am not the type who enjoys conflict.  
This is the last I am saying on this whole subject and if that means some 
of you now hate me, then so be it.  At least I am being honest.

love,
Amy

I can't agree.  One is defined by one's actions and the choices one makes.  
Look at Vanity.  She used to be the queen of slut music.  She was big on sex 
and drugs, any and all she could get.  Now she's a gospel singer, mother, 
wife, and she has made a complete break from her former life.  She's a role 
model.

Take Amy Starkey for instance: She long ago stopped doing nude layouts in 
"Hot Hamstas" magazine and now does charity work for "Weasel Lovers 
Anonymous".  (!!!!JUST KIDDING!!!!)  :0  ;)

No, the day that Traci Lords stops using her sex to make a dollar, I think 
then she'll begin to accumulate respect.  I agree her past shouldn't be held 
against her, but only when her present actions bespeak the kind of person 
that DESERVES respect.  She may be real nice in person when she's not in the 
public eye, but her occupation(s) are tinged with a liberal dose of sleeze.

Just my $.02...

Sorry for the cross post everyone, but this weekend if any of you happen to
live in the Portland, OR area, "Consciousness Lab Ambient Sound Research"
and "RE:" will be performing live ambient/idm as well as dj'ing the same
kinda stuff at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.  We will be doing a crazy
marathon 20 hour set starting Friday night and going to Saturday afternoon.
Then we will head over to the "Light Party" somewhere else in Portland for
another 4 hour set.  There are five of us in all so it will be a little
crazy, but it should be mega fun.  I think the space we will be playing in
is called the Black Lodge or something like that.  The event is some kind of
fair that will last all weekend.  I am also told there will be some sort of
rave area "techno tent."  I'm not sure if the event cost's any money.  Hope
to see some of you there.  Take it easy.

Well if you insist. The party was not at Home Base but rather
a huge warehouse nearby. I always become hesitant when I hear
"virgin warehouse", but to the best of knowledge this was the
first party thrown there. 

My friends and I got there about 11:15 and waited in line for less 
than 5 minutes, pretty cool. When you walked in there was a huge
foyer, with all the dealers, of course. To the right were two chill
rooms.

The first was a living room sized room full of couches. The floor
was covered with matresses. The adjoining room looked pretty trippy,
but that became the spot where someone sold nitris all night long.

The other chill room was much larger, also with couches, and a
fairly large sound system for that space.

As for the main dance floor...They had a giant Buddha behind the DJ
where the lasers shot over the dance floor. They had a row of several
large translucent pieces of cloth hanging from the ceiling that the 
laser shot through. Pretty interesting effect. The place was pretty
packed, it wasn't too hot, and our buddies Lyon security were pretty
much keeping to themselves.

I personally thought the vibe was great. I ran into a lot of my old
raver friends and met many new ones. Everyone seemed to be having a
good time.

As for the music, DJ Dan ripped it up again as usual, and I was
particularly impressed with Vicious Vic's set. I heard more breakbeat,
not as much trance, But a good mix of different styles. But then again 
I was bouncing around all over the place that night so I might have
missed something..

I don't know how many but there were tons of people there. The space 
was so big it never got too packed. I'd guess somewhere around a few 
thousand attended???

We left around 7am, when the place really started to thin out. I saw 
two cops as I left looking around but they didn't do anything.

All in all I feel it was a great party. Props to Full Circle for 
pulling this event off. PLUR

I'd have to disagree with this.  Delineating a particular group as
"deserving of more respect" than other groups sounds like an abortion
of logic similar to the notion of "more equal".

Both perpetuate the problem.  A better idea is to treat people with respect
and not worry too much about their particular group affiliation.

Hey y'all,

        Friday, April 26th - Origin presents _Fusion_
        Doc Martin, DJ Dan, Tony, Simon, Garth, Matthew.
        415.675.5605 415.541.5646 408.236.3398 916.484.4213

I haven't heard any talk about this party, but the lineup sounds killer!  I
was wondering if anyone's had any experience with parties thrown by this
crew.  I believe that they were formerly known as Nomad Interactive...

The reason I ask is that I've heard a rumour floating around that this
party *might* be hosted by people of the "swine" persuasion.  Can anybody
confirm or refute this statement?  Also, has anyone heard of any other
parties which were thrown under similar circumstances?  Please post
responses to the list, since such information needs to be efficiently
disseminated in order to thwart such underhanded practices by those who
seek to "protect and serve".

Rave on.

Oliver

I have heard these rumors also and I find them interesting.  I have
no idea if there is any truth to them.  It does sound far-fetched, though...
narcs throwing parties to infiltrate the rave scene?  

Even if they were narcs, they throw decent parties.  I went to a NOMAD
party several months ago and it was fun... smallish but a good vibe.
I would expect Fusion to be similar.

Let's not spread unfounded rumors... No one who does decent parties
deserves that.

I agree. IS worth noting that it isnt a far fetched idea. Thats how
vice works, actually. But the good news tis that i don't think they can 
oversell tickets :)

I guess since the tracy talk wont go away I'll put in my 2 cents worth. 
 
I guess as a DJ, I am insulted by her, using her fame as an ex porno star
to exploit the rave culture. to pretend to be a DJ is an insult to my
craft, just as I'm sure if I made porno flicks, I would be an insult to
porno studs......... 
 
as far as her choices and womanly being, more power to her, she must have
been a  good porno star or we wouldn't be talkin bout her.....

well first of all, gaia was not at the home base location. it was at a
virgin warehouse located by the colusium bart station. the place was
absolutelly amazing. i think they did a great job of setting it up and
decorating it. it get's a bit difficult to decorate 64,000 sqft.  plus
they had some of the most amazing lasers i've seen to date. they had the
main room with most of the dj's performing in there. it was so big that
there was never a problem finding a place to dance. that i liked a lot.
they had a fair sized second room with the ameba boys in there and others.

as far as the ppl and the party itself were concerned...i was pleasently
surprised. =) i spent some time working the door for a while so i had a
chance to see a great deal of the ppl as they first walked in. it was nice
to see such a diverse crowd (esp. one of that size) be able to pull
together and create such a fun environment. the music of the nite had a
lil something for everyone. we got a delicious taste of everything from
house to a bit of electro to hard trance to breaks to acid. the highlight
for me was being able to hear micro and vicious vic after hearing so much
about them. they both played amazing sets. once agian, dan also played a
wonderful set. barry weaver started out with a strong set, but lost me
shortly into it.  in the end we were givin a wonderful -hard- closing set
by liquid. it was the perfect way to close out the evening. 

all in all i would have to say that this was one of the best parties that
i have seen in a while. full circle did a wonderful job with gaia.
everything seemed to fall into place nicely. if gaia was any indication of
things to come, then i look forward to the sankofa one yr on june 15th.
hoping that everyone had as much fun as i did.....

I learned this lesson the hard way one time when I met Walter "Chekov" 
Koenig at a Star Trek thing and found out that he is a real a** hole (at 
least at times) to his adoring fans.  Kind of sad when you think that 
Chekov is one of the most loved/lovable characters from the original Star 
Trek series...
okay okay sorry to waste space...

I talked to the promoters about this and they are very distressed about 
these malicious rumors.  Please do not spread these non-facts, as the 
promoters are very nice people whose hearts are in the right places.  
They tell me that the person who started this rumor has recanted but it 
is now out of control.

Wayne (and the rest of SF Raves):

I most certainly am *not* irresponsible for asking a question which I, and
the rest of the SF Raves community should have answered.  When I asked
several friends about the event in question, I got the same response:

That they heard rumors about something sneaky going on with those parties.

If SF Raves is a free forum (as the hundreds of posts pouring into my
mailbox attest to) about the SF rave scene, then it is most certainly
appropriate to appeal to the group for their input on what, in my opinion,
is a very serious issue.

I did not intend to slander anybody.  In fact, I did not.  What I did do
was put a rumor before the mailing list and ask for responses.  To quote:

>The reason I ask is that I've heard a rumor floating around that this
>party >*might* be hosted by people of the "swine" persuasion.  Can anybody
>confirm or >refute this statement?

Notice the "might".  See -- that means I don't know anything for sure.  I'm
asking for help.  Several other people have responded that they've heard
the same rumor, so I'm not just pulling this out of my ass.  Anyhow, I've
received enough positive responses that I feel comfortable attending.  And
the issue here really isn't the drug/illicit activity thing.  What really
bothered me is that authorities *might* see fit to entrap hundreds of
people who have their lives ahead of them and much to offer the world in
exchange for a bit of publicity and a "victory" in the war on drugs.

I do agree that rumors can be very damaging.  I did not intend to
perpetuate this one.

Oh, and Wayne -- yelling is terrible netiquette.

Warning, long and rambling, sorry...

One thing I like about email is that I get to compose our thoughts, and others
read our whole post before responding -- 

In person, we might be talking over each other, interrupting, thinking about our
next words, and degenerating into a pointless argument instead of listening to
the other person's ideas.... (yeah, I know, we've had some cyber-screaming
matches here, too!)  

so..... I wanted to say that these dialogs about condoms, sex, dancing,
pornography are fascinating.... 

Some of the posts really get my hackles up, some of them are totally right on
(IMHO of course), and when I read some of them, my heart breaks a little and I
want to wrap my arms around the person.  

But mostly, my goal is to read these posts with an open mind, and learn ....
this is hardest but most important when the person is coming from a completely
different set of beliefs and values than I am....

I know nada about Traci Lords, but I do know that the opinions being expressed
about sex, pornography and morality are touching some very deep and emotional
issues, and several posters have shared some very personal background with us to
help us understand their point of view.  

We each see the world through our own experiences, and we can never really
understand another's viewpoint without sharing their experiences. 

Here's a tool I use when I find myself being judgmental about others ... I ask
myself, 

	what if ...

	my mother/father/sister/brother/lover/child/lover

	        is a...    or was a ...

	hooker/porn star/junkie/gay/Marine/Jehovah's Witness/whatever

Would it make my judgment different?  Would I give more respect to their
opinions or actions if I knew them, loved them, already respected them?  
So...  what if my sister decided to make porn?  or my best friend?  What are my
judgments then?  Funny how my mind opens up a little when these dilemmas are
personalized. 

Bottom line, seems to me, is that when it comes to issues of morality, which
would include sex and sexuality, pornography, drugs, etc... these are personal
decisions, and each of us must do what is right for us... AND... we need to keep
our minds open and try to leave room for other perspectives.   

And maybe we also need to remember that, when we feel ourselves reacting to
something with anger and strong judgment, there may be more going on than meets
the eye, and we've been given a good opportunity to dig a little deeper and
understand ourselves a little more.

                     The End   ; )               Leslie

Hello fellow ravers,
This is Stacey and Tom from Nomad Interactive. We felt the need to 
post a public response after the recent onslaught of online rumors
regarding Nomad Interactive.
We are working professionals living in the SF area for the past three
years. We were definitely inspired by the local rave community because
of the good people we met and the positive experiences we have had.
We have been putting parties together over the past year with the
intention of bringing people together under one roof to experience
something positive through music. You may know some of our parties
under the names of SPLISH boat party, FREAKOUT, XNTRK, ORIGIN, and
FUSION.
Although most of our events have focused on house music we truly
enjoy hard techno/trance as well as most other styles of music.
One of our favorite parties is F&F which we attend whenever possible.
In fact, some of our F&F friends who have helped us put the parties
together are people like Wayne Correia, Tim (Knucklehead), Micheal 
Clay, just to name a few.

There are a few people in the scene, who for their own reasons or self
interest, do not like us. These people continue to perpetuate rumors
against us. We have gone out of our way to prove that these rumors
are not true. We will be glad to give any information to whoever
is concerned regarding the truth of the matter. There are responsible
people in the scene who know the facts and are willing to talk to
anybody who is truly concerned.

Meanwhile, we are working very hard to put these events together and 
anyone who has been in that position understands all the struggles 
that face promoters during this process. We will continue to do our 
best to provide a safe and fun environment for people to come together.

We are part of the scene. We are here to contribute to the scene, not
to take away from the scene and we continue to learn and grow day by
day and appreciate life.

We want to thank all our friends who have believed and trusted in us
through everything we have experienced together over the past year.
Please feel free to email us if you have any questions.

Sorry for the cross post everyone, but this weekend if any of you happen to
live in the Portland, OR area, "Consciousness Lab Ambient Sound Research"
and "RE:" will be performing live ambient/idm as well as dj'ing the same
kinda stuff at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.  We will be doing a crazy
marathon 20 hour set starting Friday night and going to Saturday afternoon.
Then we will head over to the "Light Party" somewhere else in Portland for
another 4 hour set.  There are five of us in all so it will be a little
crazy, but it should be mega fun.  I think the space we will be playing in
is called the Black Lodge or something like that.  The event is some kind of
fair that will last all weekend.  I am also told there will be some sort of
rave area "techno tent."  I'm not sure if the event cost's any money.  Hope
to see some of you there.  Take it easy.

Just a quick note to agree about Gaia...thought the Dimension 7 team did a
great job with visuals (as usual)..the music was great especially from about
1AM onward. The place was so huge it never seemed crowded or hot, twice as
many people could have fit comfortably, but probably not in the dance area.
I heard 3-4 thousand was the turnout but I don't know how accurate that is.
Where did they get that giant gold Buddha?????? The only problem was BART
didn't start running in the morning until 8AM, so we had to stay longer than
we planned.

I'm not a lawyer (but I play one on TV).

All I can say is:

If "cops" were throwing parties, that would really constitute entrapment.

If they were getting leaked information and using that to nab people
driving away from parties while still "on drugs", that would be another. Or
using that leaked info to nab dealers.

Authorities with their war on drugs need to get the most bang for their
buck. They can't afford to arrest everyone who uses, especially people who
_aren't_ being (or looking like they could be) a nuisance to society. Most
drug charges come from being stopped or arrested for something else - maybe
you're insulting the officer or you are driving too fast (or poorly).

If they just wanted to make some mass arrests, they could come to any party
- let's face it, most happen at one of several known venues anyway.

Stop being so paranoid about "The Man" and learn how to cooly deal with the
situations you encounter him in.

But look at how many "sting" cases get thrown out of court because it was
considered entrapment.

They could have vice officers posing as dealers waiting for someone to ask
to buy.

(With all due respect to SF Vice: have you met any SF Vice officers? You
can usually tell, they're somewhat hip but lacking- maybe they are overly
groomed for the event or their shoes don't seem stylistically propper!)

[ to the other lucky folks on the SFRaves list ...]

 This weekend, I will be chaffeuring my Dad around the SF Bay area - 
he's visiting me from out of town. So , no raves for me this weekend!
All you lucky folks out there who can get out and dance this weekend,
step some steps for me! And don't forget to be patient and semi-nice
to each other....

 I especially wish I could make it to the SPAZ thing at the Golden Gate
Park bandshell , just to hear DJ theta blip again . Of course , maybe 
I could bring my dad to the Asian Art museum ....

 "It's a great museum dad ... just wander around a bit, I'll catch
  up with you in an hour or so ..."


 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - I think I've accidently posted a reply to private email to SFRaves
 once or twice - the posts/email volume of a "flame war" can get the 
 email addressing section of the brain a bit confused at times. So I
 would give Amy the benefit of a doubt for her inclusion of pivate email
 into an SFRaves post. In person, she seems to be a nice soul.

NOTE:  Please remember that I am not talking about the Origin people,
I am placing forth a purely theoretical situation:

I don't think that cops would throw parties to bust people at the parties.
What scares me is narcs throwing parties and building a circle of
friends, ie, a scene, that has complete trust in them.  From this scene
they could slowly work their way up into higher and higher levels of 
the network, until they find a source.

I mean, really, if you wanted an MDMA bust, where would you start?
How would you infiltrate?  Now that I think about it, such a idea is
NOT too far-fetched.

Ever read Phillip K. Dick's "A Scanner Darkly"?  The Vice scene is
completely and entirely 100% insane.

In response to Stacey and Tom from Nomad Interactive......

(first, allow me to say we have never met to my knowledge, and I have no agenda
here)....


In contrast to those who may think that the original questioner was out of line,
I am glad that these rumors were brought to the surface on SFRaves ... we hear
rumors and we often make decisions based on them, in the absence of other
information or personally knowing the people involved, and I know I skipped the
last party because of vague rumors (hey, when my money and time is involved, I'm
pretty careful, bad parties ruin my whole week!)

Stacey, your response was totally classy and upfront.  Your direct response and
professionalism is enlightening and encouraging.  Thank you, you sound like the
kind of people I want to support, and if I can make it to the party, I'll try to
find you and introduce myself so I can know you personally.  

You've sure got a phat lineup going there!

Hi!
 It might be good to keep in mind the rumors of "them" buying land up 
north in order to infiltrate the herb market. Never did hear anything one 
way or another on that -- as always the best is to be discreet and aware.

Subject: Consciousness Lab at Progress?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

In my unhappy review of Progress, I forgot to mention one of the major
disappointments of the night!

Did Consciousness Lab play at all?  The promotor told me they would be in
the front room (the small jungle room) from 4:30 to 6.  I stayed WAY later
than I wanted to just to see the performance.  At 5, when a jungle dj was
still spinning away, I decided to give up and leave.  Rick, what happened?
Did anyone see this performance?

Consciousness Lab performed at the other Progress I went to last summer,
using tibetan bowls and aboriginal horns to create meditational tones and
intense vibrations in the chill room.  VERY VERY cool!!  I was very excited
by this element of the sacred in the rave.  I had always wondered what the
instruments were...and then in my spirituality class at Cal a few days ago,
a Daoist master spoke to us and ended the talk with a group meditation
accompanied by the tones of the same bowl.  Synchronicity!  So I was hyped
for it on Saturday...

Also in my review I had mentioned that the music did not help build a group
vibe, IMO.  But I neglected to mention that I saw no evidence of people
personally creating a vibe.  The smile factor was very very low.  In fact,
people weren't even meeting each other's eyes.

It only occurs with our openness...  Even a "bad" rave contains lessons!

Love to you all,
Nancy

Ok.  Some days I'm on, and some days I'm off.  Today was *NOT* a good day...

I mentioned in an earlier post that a rumor had gone around that some 
promoters had managed to have the original space for All in the Family 
busted.  I also went on to criticize the *unnamed* promoters for events 
they'd put on.  Well, I have been straightened out on both scores.

Anybody got any ketchup?  This foot isn't exactly tastey...

First, it was pointed out to me that I've been to a couple of functions put 
on by these promoters that I really enjoyed.  I didn't know at the time that 
they were responsible for pulling those parties off.  This definitely makes 
the sentiments I expressed earlier seem pretty spiteful.  Somebody slap me 
on the back of the head, ok?

Second, I put the question out in general but I also sent a few mail 
messages off to specific people, and I've gotten no hard facts.  Somebody 
said this, and somebody said that, but no hard and fast names/dates/places 
or first-hand accounts.  On the other hand, several people sent me mail 
telling me, in no uncertain terms, that rumors similar to this one have gone 
around before, and they couldn't be further from the truth.  

I figured that, since I hadn't named anyone, I wasn't adding fuel to the 
fire.  Unfortunately, it seems a lot more people than just myself heard the 
same rumor, and I did in fact add to the tension by the tone of my message 
and even inspired some more vitriolic missives.  Did anyone slap me on the 
back of the head yet?  Could you also kick me a couple of times?

Tom and Stacey, my heartfelt apologies.  Now that I've got your email 
address, if I have any questions on this sort of thing I'll send them to you 
directly.  I honestly did not intend to stir up the kind of negativity that 
went around today.  I too have heard other rumors, but I've also met and 
chatted with you, and you're real nice people.  I've been told, in the 
course if the day's correspondence, that you've received some extremely 
hateful voice and email messages.  I'm sorry to hear that, and I hope 
everyone just calms down and remembers:

        RUMORS AREN'T FACTS.

Hm.  Could someone hurry with that ketchup?

Forwarding someones private mail or response to a public forum is the 
height of rudeness. It's right up there with spamming. Wayne can hardly be 
blamed for being upset. And for the person in question to accuse *Wayne* of 
poor nettiquette!?!?!

All I can say is, if 1994 was the year we got the Zippies out of our
hair, I sure hope 1996 is the year we get Keoki and Tracy Lords out of
our hair!!  I wish them all the success they deserve <snicker>

Ok, enough cattiness, judgements, and negative vibes for one day!  Since I 
did my part to make today less that pleasurable on this list, how about a joke?

A young couple was driving down the road one day, happily, deliriously in 
love and due to be married the next day.  Suddenly, a large truck swerved 
from the oncoming lanes into their car!  BOOM!  And they both died.

At the Pearly Gates, the young couple confronted St. Peter.  "Sir, you have 
to help us!  We were to be married tomorrow.  Is there any way we can be 
married in Heaven?"

"Hmmm," replied St. Peter, "I don't recall there ever being a marriage in 
Heaven.  Well, let's take it up with God and see what he says."

So they approached God with their plea.  God sat for a moment, pondering the 
request.  Then he looked down and said, "Come back in five years and ask me 
again."

Five years later, the couple approached God again, even more in love than 
ever and pleading that he allow their marriage.  God paused for quite a 
while, musing over their request.  Then he spoke, "Come back in five years 
and ask me again."

And once again, five years later, the couple was again in the presence of 
God, more in love than ever and begging God's permission for the third time 
to marry.  This time God smiled broadly and thundered, "Yes my children, you 
may marry!"

Well, the wedding went off beautifully, the reception was huge, everyone 
thought the bride was simply breathtaking and the groom was soooo handsome, 
and everyone was happy!  What a fine couple!  What a splendid wedding!  Until...

Two years later, the couple was back before God, and things were not looking 
so good.  The couple had come to the realization almost immediately that 
marriage was not what they were made for, and in spite of their struggles to 
come to terms with the situation, they had decided there simply was no 
alternative but to get a divorce.

Black clouds fractured by lightening rolled across the sky, and the ground 
shook with explosive thunder.  God glared down at the tiny couple before 
him, his face becoming dark and angry, and he roared, "Divorce?!  It took us 
ten years just to find a priest in Heaven!  Do you have any idea how long it 
will take to find a LAWYER?!!"

Just thought I'd share that today sucked, until I played softball today. The
first game of the season for my team at work and we kicked butt. I struck out
4 or 5 people for one...and for two we won 35 to 9.....YES!! off to a good
start this season.

Well, I would also suggest that there are others who do the craft far
worse.  For instance, many of the big names who come into town.  Yep, they
make the records people buy, yep they make the music that makes tears go
down one's eye....but they couldn't spin their way out of a box, much less
mix.  Now who is the poser?  These guys ask for $$$, and do doo-doo on the
dex.  Now that, IMO is wack!

Doing porno is easy...when the director tell you to get it up, do it.  If
it takes 2-4 hours to finish a scene, stay 'up'.  And when it's time for
the 'money shot' you better deliver on cue.  Not so bad.  Oh yeah, don't
forget the crew of guys standing around watching you, and watch out for
camera two, hey pup, move your leg over to the left, that's it, hey keep
your voice down, too much talking....

It's my opinion that SF doesn't book many live performers.  I just checked
the calendar and from now until June 1st these is only one live performer -
Miisa and that was last Thurs the 18th.  The only memorable live persormers
I recall were y-Ziq (uk) and Freaky Chakra, and of course now Sky Lab 2000
(hehe BP)... and I would have gone to see Eat Static but they were
cancelled.  :(

 Am I right here SF? Do we ignore live performers or is there no demand for
them and this is why no one books them?  There seems to be a steady flow of
import DJ's to SF (However, I would love to hear more from the LA scene;
Christopher Lawerence, Thomas Micheal, Trance, Doran, Ron D. Core to name a
few I have heard and like).

IMHO, Sky Lab 2000 rawks da house, and someone should definatly look into
getting them up here.

Hello All!

I'm new to the list...so I've been a "voyeur" of sorts, trying to get a
feel for it. And Erik...you've finally coaxed me out of my silent shell!
Kudos to you!

It seems that "industrialized" society has definitely taken a wrong turn
at some point in time towards its treatment of women.  Just thought I
would share with you all some examples of AWESOME female status in past
societies.

"Ecstatic" dancing has been part of ancient Japanese, Chinese, and Korean
cultures during shawmanistic rituals during which female priestesses would
display their powers.  These women priesteses were STAR.  

The Ah-Goot women of ancient Korea would practice drumming fests in which
women were the sole musicians and dancers.  Peace and harmony were said to
follow these rituals.

Legends say the "Wu" priestesses in ancient China would slash
themselves and emerge from their ritual dancing unscathed and completely
beaming with positive, healing energy.

I don't know about the masochistic part, but that's definitely how I feel
after a full night of receiving and sending out good vibes at a RAVE!
Could it be our modern day interpretation of such "healing" practices?
I'd like to think so! :)

Other random tidbits:

-The first novel ever written, Tale of Genji, was written by LADY
	Murasaki.
-Pharoah's rule originally passed through a matrilineal line.
-The Beloved Women were the head of Cherokee counsel...and they would
	ultimately approve or negate the tribe's decision to go to war.
-Pueblo societies laughed at the notion of their men being sent off to
	do the heavy work of building houses by the Spaniard
	Conquistadors.  Such work was the pride-filled responsibility of
	women.
 
So basically, I'm trying to make a point that WOMEN'S and GODDESS power
crosses the barriers of race, culture, time, and form. Does anyone out
there think that raving goes beyond expression and into the field of
WOMEN'S empowerment?  I'd like to hear your thoughts.

Power to you all-

Ivana

Thanks for the responses in regard to Mos Eisley everyone! Now a new 
question. Since we didn't go out Tuesday we were interested in Seismic. 
Does anyone know the line up this week. The info line is not working so 
again I am not sure if they are even doing it this week although the 
flier I got a couple of weeks ago says they should be going off this 
week. If some one could check with dj Dan or DRC (I don't know how to 
contact them) and write back with info before six tomorrow I would 
greatly appreciate it.

Hi!
 I may be dating myself but this info is important. I used to see the 
Grateful Dead fairly regularly, from the late seventies on up to the late 
eighties. There was quite a community vibe amongst the deadheads, what 
with the communal market place that always popped in any parking lot of 
any dead show. At first it was really wonderful. As time wore on (as it 
always does) the dead became more and more popular and the parking lot 
crowds grew -- some to hang out and enjoy the vibe -- others to cater to 
the unique consummer market that the dead heads provided. Eventually this 
attracted the attention of law enforcement officials including the DEA. 
Eventually the joke (and not a funny one) was that the DEA was on tour 
(with the dead heads). A LOT of arrests went down mostly because dealers 
and ordinary folk were not discreet and downright sloppy in their 
attitudes. If you are breaking the law, you will be busted if you are 
habitually sloppy.

he is _the man_. The dedication at the back of scanner darkly is
frightening. Ive heard some really neat urban ledgend about pkd. House
filled up with water. locked manuscripts blowing up. aliens talking to him.

Last three books of his are amazing. You can watch his brain on overload,
trying to explain and absorb the light from the satellite speaking to him.

Got back from roots a little while ago, and I got to say I had a BLAST!
Jeno had MIND BLOWING INCREDIBLE set!  
The crowd was great.  A nice ecclectic crowd with alot of positive 
energy.  It seems almost every time I go to 1015 folsom lately, the 
interior looks different.  I like the way it was set up downstairs, and 
there was a nice chill space upstairs.

One of the members of C-Lab (Brad) was scheduled to DJ, and as far as I know
he did.  A friend of mine who went said he did spin and a great set at that.
C-Lab is a collective of artists and dj's.  When you see the name on a flier
it can mean one of many things.  The two Progress parties that we played
live at were parties where C-Lab was givin the ambient space for the entire
night.  If you see C-Lab scheduled amoung 5 other dj's, it probably means
that one of us will be dj'ing and representing C-Lab.  We probably (but you
never really know) won't play live if we only get a two hour set.  For
instance, I'm sure you saw my bsp yesterday where we will be playing a 20
hour set in Portland.  That's more like it.  If you ever have any questions
as to whether we will be playing live or not at an event, e-mail me and ask.
Actually, if we are playing live, I'll probably say something to the list.
Take it easy, and sorry for the confusion.

Sure, would be more than interested. I live in the city and would like to

Subject: Re: condommania!

 At the risk of giving new life to the dreaded 'condommania!' thread, my
review of a new polyethylene condom is below. Those of you who don't like 
sex-talk on the list should probably bail now ... Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

These were 'Avanti' condoms, and came in a package of six. The price 
worked out to ~ $1.25/ea.

misc observations;

*These seems to be cut a bit wider than conventional latex condoms, but a 
bit more narrow than Trogan 'Large' variety. 

*The material these are made of is a plastic, and therefore has much less 
'stretch' to it than latex. If you were much smaller, or much larger than
the condom, this might be a problem.

the good;

*I liked the lubrication a lot. There was less of it than on the Trojan's 
I'm use to, and it was odorless. Lately the smell of either the 
spremacide or lubrication on those Trojan's has been bugging me, so this 
was nice. I also would rather have less lubrication, and add more if 
necessary, than be sloshing around in it.

*For me, sensitivity was noticeably better than with latex ... As much as 
20-30%. Heat-transfer was also better. Obviously, these are BIG 
plusses.

the bad;

*The packages were really hard for me to open. The wrapper had a little 
'tear here' cutout, but I kept just ripping the corners off. Neither my 
fingers nor teeth did a very effective job.

*Out of the six we used, one broke (thankfully, not at the wrong time). 
It should be noted that we were going at it pretty aggressivly, but we've 
put many latex condoms through similar paces, and haven't had one fail 
yet. 

the conclusion;

I say give 'em a try. We're going to consider the one breakage a chance 
happening, and cross our fingers. They felt better to me than the best 
latex I've used ... Hopefully they will prove to be as durable.

-Dan

How many do? I don't know any stats.  I used to assume that shit
like that would be thrown out of court.  But cases don't get
"thrown out of court" for entrapment.  People get acquitted
when they can prove they were entrapped.

But point is, you have to say that you WERE guilty of doing something wrong,
but that you wouldn't have done it if it weren't for the officers.

So if you start off your defense saying that you are "Not Guilty"
you can't yell "Entrapment" later on.  And how easy is it to
prove that it's entrapment?

"Officer, did you approach the young man and flirt with him,
and hint that you would have sex with him if only you had some acid?"

"No"

"Defendant, did the officer approach you and flirt with you,
and hint that she would have sex with you if only she had some acid?"

"Yes"

And it's not just a matter of what the law says, it's a matter of
what the jury thinks and what the jury thinks the law says.
If the jury buys into the "Drugs are Evil" scheme of things,
chances are, they aren't going to be that nitpicky over
the details of how things happened.  YOU bought/sold drugs.
THAT is illegal.  Who cares WHY or HOW you did it?

And even if the jury isn't the type to just say "Drugs are Evil",
they would have to be told and proven that the way the
cops arrested you was illegal.  On a jury, you can't just say:
"Hey that was entrapment!"  I mean, you can, but chances
are teh otehr jurors won't beleive you unless the lawyer
brought up proof of it.  (Not to mention that you aren't really
supposed to make presumptions about the law yourself :)

I wouldn't really trust entrapment to get you out of much.
There are too many ways around it using third parties 
and out and out lying.

For 5 grams of crack cocaine, you receive a minimum 5 year sentence without
parole.  For powder cocaine, it takes 500 grams to receive the same sentence.

After living in the UK for some time last year, I can sympathize with their

that TG can go off as planned.

And now that the massives are not even working out over there, it sounds 
like they are really stuck.  

I'm really excited about the first weekend in June.... My friend from 
London, who I hooked up with over alt.rave is coming over to the US and I 
will be showing him raving San Francisco style!  Practically as soon as 
he gets off the plane we are heading out for Tribal Future.  What a 
change from those 30,000 person massives over there.  (or the clubs for 
that matter)  I'm REALLY excited and really *PROUD* to show him what we 
get to have on a regular basis.  As Tony Rotundo's famous quote goes: 
"Appreciate this!!"

love,
Amy

Hmm, in the last year or so in SF I can recall performances (in addition to
those mentioned above) by:

the Orb
Velocette
Space Time Continuum
Torsion
Moby

hmmm, that's not that big a list, is it. Maybe you're right!

Hello all on sf-raves!  I hope I don't tick anyone off for posting here 
because I'm not from the bay area (not even close, in fact).  I'm from 
Green Bay, Wisconsin, which is my primary reason for writing this.
	I'm an aspiring dj who has a majority of the equipment.  The 
thing I am lacking is a collection of the San Francisco house I love so much.
The midwest is very hardcore and trance oriented, and aside from shopping 
in Chicago for records (which makes for an expensive and infrequent trip), I 
have an extremely hard time finding the right tunes.  Mail order is cool 
and all, but when you don't even know what artists or labels to ask for, 
it doesn't do much good.
	
	So anyway, to get right down to it, I borrowed a mixtape from a 
friendthat was mixed by one DJ Dan, who I am told is from San Francisco.  
I loved the entire tape and finally was able to hear a whole 90 minutes 
of the house I want to spin someday.
	If any of you would be so kind as to help me out, I have one or 
two questions:

1.  If any of you know the playlist for the first side of his tape, I 
would really appreciate having it mailed here.  This kind gesture would be 
the equvalent of giving up one of your kidneys for charity.

2.  Would any of you be interested in sending me a list, large or small, 
of San Francisco house labels, artists, stores that carry this style of 
house, and/or anything else you think relevant to my search?


	If you've gotten this far, thank you for reading my post, wether or not 
you are able to help! :)  I will really, 
really, really appreciate any help you west coast ravers can offer me!

		Thanks again, Brian   :)

Single Cell Orchestra, Dubtribe. . .

That's only one a month, I guess.  More is great!
(I'm a sucker for live techno!)

Aren't Single Cell and Freaky playing at MAD on Monday??

Is anything exciting going on tonight that is 18+. I haven't been out in 
ages and I just cannot wait until the weekend:) Thanks, Talilla

If anybody is feeling negativity from recent posts, look out your window. 
It's a wonderful, sunny, hot day. I feel summer upon us!

IMO, DJDan is the best DJ the west coast has to offer.  There's a lot of 
talent out here, but with all the monotonous noNRG trance out here Dan 
will make any party a bomb.  As far as giving you the playlist for the 
tape you're asking for, I can do that if I know which tape it is.  (I 
have just about every Dan tape there is :)  Dan plays music from all 
around the world, not just from SF, but there's a ton of good labels out 
here.  Try:

www.dnai.com/~twitch
http://tripNspin.com/trippy/
http://hyperreal.com/music/labels/oobe/

Those are just a few anyone wanna help me out with some more?


Hope this helps!

You should consider yourself lucky Larry.  My dad's in town and he wants
to come to a rave! (and grow his hair and pierce his ears etc)...Although
it's kind of a fun idea to bring him I really don't think I'd have as much
fun with him hanging around ya know!

sympathetically,  Jess

I had to laugh at Jess's note to Larry...

>  >  This weekend, I will be chaffeuring my Dad around the SF Bay area - 
>  > he's visiting me from out of town. So , no raves for me this weekend!

As a full-on, no-holds-barred raver, with way more than my ears pierced (though
my ear piercings are pretty awesome, I must say)..... and at 42 years old,
though my best friends are all 25-ish, and several more true friends as young as
18.... I always have to laugh that my own daughter, who's 18 in June, really
can't/doesn't want to hang out with me --- not just because she's not really
into raving, but more because, when it all comes down to it, I'm her mom -- and
there's something about that that's different, no matter how cool your mom is,
and no matter how cool your friends think she is ... she's still your mom.
(Though I did get her to go to the last F-8 beach party with me last year, which
was a highlight of my life, I think!  I wonder what would happen if she was a
raver, maybe we'd have to agree to go to different parties, or just work this
out somehow?!)

My own dad used to smoke pot with me when I was young, and he was pretty cool
really, but I remember how I really didn't want him hanging around, though my
friends thought he was great .... they still do, but to me, he's still my
dad....

Some things never change, eh?  When people I meet out say "wow, you're almost as
old as my mom" (hey, if I'm actually older than your mom, don't tell me,
ok?).... I remind them that I can pretty much guarantee that's as far as that
resemblence probably goes! 

With age and youth all wrapped up in one.....

Leslie   ; )

This is not a rumor and this post is directed to the wellfare of all ravers
who wish to partake in the taking of E for a good time.  If you have a
problem with this post direct it to me personally other wise feel free to
discuse.  I don't want to justify my post because most of you know E is a
part of our scene and I am sure everyone on this list knows some one that
has done it.  All I am saying here is be very careful, I love you all as a
family and would never want any harm to come to my brothers and sisters...

I just got informed of some very bad news regarding some of the E going
around in SF these days...
A friend of mine knows for a fact that some of the E going around is not E
at all but straight heroin and some tylenols are a mix of the two.  I know
this is going on in NY and LA however the pills are marketed as heroin,
however, some scrupless dealers are selling them as E here in the bay area.
One friend of mine took 2 of the mixed pills and was so f#@ked up he
couldn't move for hours and if you tried to look at him he just looked
through you.
    I am sooooo pissed this shit goes on.  These people who do this have no
respect for people's safety.  Yeah, drugs are bad and illeagal but that is
no reason to ignore a problem that occures in our community.  Two other
ways I know this is possible - A dumb ass friend of mine took a capsule of
"E" a week before a drug test.  Well the test came up positive with 5 drugs
in his system.  Besides the weed, the rest was in the E he had been taking
which included - MDA, heroin, and two types of amphetamines - notice no
MDMA...  Also, a friend of a friend told me (not a very cretable sorce), he
had his E tested and it contained a little MDMA, crank, and heroin.  These
were all seperate instances.  <**I appologise, I have no chemical names for
you or the acctuall tests but my friend is very reliable and I have known
him for half my life**>

By the way my friend lost his job but is now in rehab for drug addiction.
Can I just say I HATE SPEED!!  aaaaaarrrrhhhhh!

RE: narcs  was April 26, Fusion
I don't wanna post twice so I'll add this to my post-

Early last year at Cearsars on Market?? I went to this party.  Dunno what
it was called now but I ran into this short guy on the way up the stairs.
He said excuss me and then asked me where he could get some "ecstacy".  I
said I didn't know and went on my merry way.  Larter on in the night I saw
him crusin' around by himself, dancin' here and there; when a girlfriend of
mine pointed him out to me and she said he was a narc and told me not to
talk to him.  thought nawww, she's just parinoid, there's no narcs at
parties.  Half hour or so passed and the same guy walked up to me again and
asked me where I could get any acid.  I thought ?[didn't he just ask me for
X].  Nope I said to him.  He sat next to me and proceded to tell me some
fantacy/need about getting some acid that night for his girlfrind and I
asked him "didn't you ask me if I had any X earlier?" He said no, but could
I get him some of that too.  This guy was too desperate.  In the course of
the night(till 3am or so) three different people told me not to talk to him
cuz he was a narc AND I saw him leave and come back by himself twice during
the evening(what does ths mean, I don't know).  Well I don't know if anyone
was arrested cuz I left rather early but there was a deffinate police
presence outside.   Hhhhhmmmmmmm....

Good luck to you all..
Love,
Austin

I have heard about the bad e, and had a person close to me who's on the
East coast get it.  It does suck.

About the party at Ceasars, um, yeah Austin that guy does sound fishy, and
I know in typing that post you were/are very upset, but this statement:

>it was called now but I ran into this short guy on the way up the stairs.
                                       ^^^^^^^^^

Doesn't do any good.  Better to leave it out, or offer further description.
You know.  I mean, now everyone might run from me when I try and hug them!
:^)

Now I know you meant that since he was a short guy you would have thought
him more cool, because we all know short men and women are just naturally
more cool than most people, so I'll let it slide.

Please don't take my humor as a flippant attitude toward your post, you've
brought up some very important points.

Peace!

Tony

Here we go again...
Baybe someone should put the heroin in E rumor in the FAQ.

Once again, there is no heroin in E and if there was you wouldn't get that
much of an effect from it since heroin in not very active when taked oraly.
A high dose of MDMA will definately get you really fucked up just like your
friend did. You might want to check out
ftp://hyperreal.com/drugs/mdma/mdma.heroin
for more info on this.

Yes, this is going to sound negative, please do not take this personally, 
I just cringe when I see such unfounded disinformation:

The definition of a rumor is "1. a story or statement in general circulation 
without confirmation or certainty as to facts, 2. gossip; hearsay" 
Austin, everything, *EVERYTHING* you have posted with regards to the 
content of the E going around is hearsay. "My friend says this, my friend 
says that," this is the very definition of rumor.

Let's examine this from a few standpoints:
 
1) Financial feasability: Heroin is generally considered to be a 
   highly-addictive drug that can cost significantly more than MDMA. It is
   most commonly distributed in a form condusive to intraveneous use, or 
   use by inhalation. What financial motive could a manufacturer of heroin 
   possibly have to produce heroin in an entirely different form from normal,
   and then sell it for less than they could receive by producing it its
   more common, and financially lucrative form? And to sell it to persons 
   that have no interest in the high produced by the use of heroin?  

2) "My friend knows": How? Has he had an analysis of the substance in 
    question made? Where are the results? 

3) "My friend took two pills and got fucked up" : And what does this prove?
    That he had a negative reaction to whatever constituted the substance
    he ingested, most certainly. But does a negative reaction to a substance
    indicate that it contains heroin?

I find this most interesting. Just what kind of drug test did he have 
that tested for the presence of two different type of amphetamines, and 
also the presence of MDA, and MDMA(both of which would register as 
amphetamines)? Austin, your statement is contradictory and simply doesn't 
make sense. 

I can produce a list of legal substance the length of my arm that 
can produce false positives in drug tests including poppy seeds(opium or 
heroin), decongestants containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine(methamphetamines), 
and the list goes on.  

Also, a friend of a friend told me (not a very cretable sorce), he

More rumors.  

Austin, I have no doubt your intentions are good, but you do no one a 
service with disinformation.

There is definitely some stuff out there that is not MDMA, or at 
least not very good quality, but it is not herion.

But not all people take E orally! Many sniff it. Just a random comment...

I'm not sure of this, but isn't the street value of heroin higher than
MDMA?  Immean can't one make more money selling H to junkies then to
raver's as E?  Chances are the "E" was some other shit like horse tranquelizer
or something.  Folks should not take substances that they don't know the source
of anyway, if you are not absolutely _sure_ of what is is your taking, don't
take it, especially some sketchy shit that Joe Drug Dealer sells you at a
large party.



        Whether the drug comes form your dealer or Doctor...


        Know Your source!

Yo-
        just wanted to put my two cents in about the recent visit by Dave
Clarke at MAD last Monday. Overall, I thought it was a very good night.
I like the club, the sound was pretty good and most importantly, people
seemed to enjoy themselves.  I think a lot of people have this impression
that because MAD is a techno/trance club, that the venue it takes place
in should be made entirely of corrugated aluminum siding with toxic waste
on the floors inside and rabid vermin scurrying underfoot.  I disagree.
As a venue, the bahia was booty because(among other reasons) it was a
restaurant converted into a club.  I didn't find it at all very
comfortable; sitting on those rattan chairs getting splinters in my
gluteous...trying to dance anywhere near the dj was at best hazardous;
the potential for busting the dj's groove being too high.  Not to mention
all the organizational tete-a-tete's that occurred on a frequent basis.
The new place comparatively is a gosdend.
        Anyhow, I had a good time on Monday, and I thought Dave Clarke
played pretty well.  And, I might add, contrary to popular belief he's a
fuckin' really cool guy.  Either that or we caught him in at a good time
in his life 'cuz I went to dinner with the guy before MAD and he was
more than cool~  He really liked san fran.  so much so that he made us 
drice him across the Golden Gate bridge while he told about how the U2 
remix he did recently paid for his new Volvo.  All in all, a good night 
indeed.

*sigh* this sort of thing is the problem with the fact that things like e
aren't regulated in some way.  there are SOOO many people who know someone
who heard from a friend that they put this stuff in the caps/pills, this
person told that person that e makes hair grow on the palms of your hands
... i actually had someone try to convince me that their friend who is a
microbiology major knew that e in your system will cause chewing gum to 
turn squooshy and pulpy if you chew it for long enough.  Listen, bro (or 
sis), if you chew chewing gum STRAIGHT for seven hours it's probably gonna 
get a little tired :)

I never EVER buy at parties, only from the most reliable sources i have
(which, i admit, are only as reliable as the next link in the chain) ... 
and so far i have only gotten burned once *fingers crossed*.  I think ppl
who are sooo desperate for a high that they buy from just any ole person
who looks like they might know what they're talking about pretty much
deserves what they get.  That may sound harsh, but if _I_ can't get 
"reliable" e, i'll do without, thanks ... i'd rather just have a grand 
boogying time straight than take something from someone i've never seen 
before.

Now, lets see how many people flame me for THIS one :)

Anyone interested might wanna check this site out: mdma.org

There's lots of info on E, and some recent tests on pressed pills.  It
looks like all the Doves they found were MDMA or mostly MDMA, while
the Playboys were some or mostly MDEA.  If I was going to Europe I
think I might be coming home with a balloon up my ass full of white
doves :)

Does anybody know what exactly is in "White Lights?"  I've noticed
that people that take more than one seem to MESC *just* a little bit :)

This I had to comment on, this happens. I think that when your on E (IMO)
you tend to chew and suck on that gum alot more then if your straight,
therefore it gets "tired" alot quicker then normal. I have had it happen to
me in both cases. I most of chewed a piece of gum for many hours and it got
so nasty I spit it out, and it was like spitting out water. I also had it
happen when I indulged at a party and I only chewed it for not even half the
time and did the same thing. I do remember that the gum was of the same
type. Sugarless or not sugarless I just don't remember which one it was. It
wasn't the same flavor though. So it's either the sugar free or not sugar
free. All I have to say about chewing gum until it turns into liquid is that
it is NASTY! yuck.

Anyway, just thought I'd throw in my .02 in since it happened to me.

You might be right, but any time I have heard of things going on here
is has been a flop. I didn't know that anything went on in Stanford,
but I am glad to hear it. Also the main problem is that people WILL
travel to the city from here for an event, but not the opposite (RE:
Sign of a bad rave: "1:The map point is in Palo Alto" this was not by
me!!!!). I really wish there was something to do, but problems with
police...etc add to the difficulty (actually Stanford probably is the
only place to get away from this).  I do know people here who put on
events, but they do it WELL away from Palo Alto.

One thing to do is try to get as many people from this area in one
place for an night just to see what support there is, otherwise this
thread is just guess work. I am definately not opposed to trying, have
done so in the past and I am still working on it (although lately I've
been looking further afield). 

If you feel that your not connected to other people of similar social
tendencies I suggest hanging out in Rudy's bar on University Ave. as
there is a fair sized group of rave attending people there (mostly
Brits like myself). I'll probably be there tonight (as I cant put up
the effort to go to SF) and there has been talk of a house party (with
DJ's, 1200's...Etc) possibly later on.

Respect
Stephen

PS could you send me info on this Stanford event? Thanx

I don't see any reason you should get flamed for this.  I agree 100%.
Another good method for getting good pills from a source you don't
know is to find a guinnie pig that already bought from this person
this evening and find out how they feel.  It's not 100% reliable, but
hey, what actaully is in this market?
I've gotten out of even *trying* to find pills.  When they "fall into
my hands" from someone I trust, then I'll lay out some money, but
otherwise, I'd much rather play straight than ingest garbage.

hugs & smiles,
  Graham

Fellow SF Ravers...

I think that you'll recall a posting I sent three weeks ago in 
reference to two of my friends incredibly terrible experience with some 
bad e.  These were two seasoned ravers who have been taking e since the 
early 80s. What they went through that evening and the following days 
was scary enough to make one of them swear off substances forever. I 
had a total of 23 responses to that posting of which 14 mentioned bad e 
experiences in the bay area within the last 3 months.  I COULD CARE 
LESS IF E HAS HEROIN IN IT OR NOT that's not the point. The message to 
take home from Austin's post is that at this point in time there's some 
seriously bad e in this area. BE CAREFUL!

On a much lighter note than my last posting...

[WARING: IF YOU'RE NOT A DJ YOU CAN PRESS DELETE AT THIS POINT...]

Wanted:
1-2 DJS needed for an afternoon-into-the-evening house party in S.F.  The two 
DJS scheduled have decided to go to Tahoe instead.  Just a mellow sunny spring 
afternoon barbecue kind of a thing. I have a soundsystem (amp+monitors) you'd 
need to bring 2 turntables and a mixer and music of course, preferably house but 
something else might be interesting.  Basically our clothing company, Solle 
Clothing Co. (club/surf stuff)is just throwing a little spring thank you party 
for some of our vendors and suppliers etc.  The crowd will be very mixed from 
Deadheads to surfers to marina yuppies.  So if a killer dance vibe is what you 
need than this probably won't be it.  But if a chance to practice your craft, 
grab some free t-shirts, and make some people happy on a sunny SF afternoon is 
your cup of tea than you might want to consider this opportunity.  Please e-mail 
me [solle@solle.com] up until noon on Friday or page me thereafter 415-227-6567  
(party=sat. 2pm on)

Thanks

hey, gurus and guru-ettes... ;b

does anyone know of any s/w that can convert an image into
  a text representation of the image, where different characters
    are used based on how many pixels they have, so you end up with
      a big grid of text in a sort of halftone pattern?

To All Interested,

I know people in PA who have tables, have experience in throwing
parties in the bay area, DJ's (even got one coming from UK in May),
know anough people to get about 30-50 people there (not quite enough),
all we need is more people and a venue (sorry cant think of everything,
and I know this is the difficult bit).

What Say?

and I know this is the difficult bit).

What Say?

i know at least 15 more people that would be into something like that

and i know 2 dj's who have spun at some intimate parties around here who
rip and would also like to participate or whatever.

i mean, throwing shit down here in palo alto wouldn't replace my friends
and my travels to the city, but it would be cool.

I have to put in a ditto because i was about to say the same thing.

Why do WE (as in most of the discussion groups on the net i've been in)
always spend more time denouncing the fact that Drug X could be 
being sold as Drug Y than dealing with the fact that Drug Y
did not react as most would expect?

It IS really important, i think, to not have people creating more
or repeating the same rumours about drugs and to have the right
information being spread since it's not going to be spread
by standard information spreading sources.

I would hope that would be the main goal.

But i think it's usually because people (like me for example)
just get fed up and annoyed with hearing the same rumour over and over and over
again. (Which is, i presume, the answer to the above question)

But responding in an annoyed manner usually doesn't help
the forementioned goal of spreading information.

The scenario i usually see:

> > My friend's friend bought some QQ last weekend and got really sick,
> > my other friend's other friend said that it had Boopies in it,
> > because they are just one molecule off and Boopies can show up

Well, more or less.

I dont think the reaction on sfraves was bad in the least, but it
often gets ridiculous.  

The one thing that WAS pretty bad though, was that everyone was saying
"THAT CAN'T BE HEROIN!" and not talking about what it could have been.

Saying "Don't Buy Drugs From People You Don't Know" or 
"Well, Sure You're Sick, BUT It's Not Heroin" isn't going to help
your friend who was really jonesin for something and got something
bad and is now lying in your arms paler than a ghost, sweating
so much that your getting soaked.

So fuck the "dissemination of accurate information" idealist answer,
think about the totally selfish reason that it may happen to someone
you care a lot about.

Don't pull a peter parker, start talking NOW about what
the stuff could actually HAVE been.  Okay, so not much information
was given, but maybe some people on here know the right questions
to ask or just some questions to ask, so we could all be more
informed about what is going on around us.

peace... or annihilation... it's your choice.

For 5 grams of crack cocaine, you receive a minimum 5 year sentence without
parole.  For powder cocaine, it takes 500 grams to receive the same sentence.

Hmmm... I wonder which one lawyers and judges do.

So anyone have any ideas for an allnighter venue. I think it should be
a freebie for a start off.

Because we're getting such glorious weather, outdoor spots might be nice.
There are TONS of beautiful parks from which to choose.  As far as indoor
locations, I'd prefer to avoid clubs/bars, but that's just because I'm
bored with the whole drinking/meat-market scene, which is huge in such
venues in the South Bay.

My guess would be Ketamine. It sure makes you feel like sitting on your

I remember these things called 'disco wafers'. They really sucked!

  I think the lack of suitable locations might be a factor.
  If you consider that the South Bay is more suburban in its
  set up, then a lot of the warehouses might be situated too close
  to residential areas.  Maybe the local law enforcement and
  city codes are more strict than SF...?

  However, given that San Jose is the largest city in the Bay Area
  I wouldn't think that there is a lack of people interested in raves. :)
  It certainly would be nice to see a few more down this way.  Beautiful
  People last August was certainly a highlight!

  My couple of pennies...

Hey Hey,

Why is it that there a REAL lack of events in the
south bay, like south of the Bay bridge??  Is there
not alotta locations to secure??  Is the vibe from
community that bad??  Let's see if we can't get
some places down here ... Cuz if we don't, I'll be
forced to move to SF just to get my spirital

I'd be totally up for this!!!  There's alot of really nice Coffee shops in Downtown San Jose.  Cafe Zucko on 1st street has a nice atmosphere.  Friday nights they have DJs spining ambient and trip hop.

I've heard the Heroin thing a LOT, so i'm really wondering
where it comes from...

random story:

A friend of mine took a pill that he thought was MDMA, 
even bought it from someone whom he trusted.  
He hadn't done E before, so he didn't really know what to expect.
People kept saying "Do you want to hug everyone and plant
flowers at their feet?"
He said "Uh.. no, but my hands feel tingly, and my body temperature
is really high, and different surfaces feel fun to rub"
He spent a few hours curled up in a ball, dripping sweat
and just feeling absolutely miserable until things calmed down.
He then was pretty sick (although not close to that bad) for the next
few days.

Being the experimental little pup that he is, he took the second
pill he bought in the hopes that there was just some wierd
reaction the first time.  But the same exact thing
(including the following sickness) happened. 

Many, many, many people said: "That must have been heroin."

(Quite a few people also said "Heroin isn't really orally active,
so that couldn't have been heroin."  but didn't have any
other, better or worse, suggestions.)

Said friend later went into a hospital for a leg injury and was 
prescribed oxycodone for the pain.  He noticed a lot of the same
tingliness, tactile enjoyment and pure misery that he
experienced before.  But didn't experience the same sickness
for days.  Everything else, though, seemed pretty much the same,
just a slightly milder version.

The pills presumed to be MDMA were pressed and had a similar appearance
to the oxycodone he was prescribed.

Don't know the connection, but my completely uneducated/uninformed
little theory was that seeing as how heroin is a narcotic
and oxycodone is an opiod analgesic, there might be a connection there.

Presumably the unknown pills weren't heroin or oxycodone, 
but guessing that it might be someone's codeine prescription
or something like that seemed right.

Just some random thoughts

There are some warehouses in Santa Clara where paintball games take place.
Such venues might be suitable to host events, if space rental/permits/etc.
can be negotiated.  Someone aught to explore this!

There is alot of open space up in the foothills on the west side of highway 
280.  i haven't been up there lately, but i'm sure we could find an outdoor 
location up there.

Because we're getting such glorious weather, outdoor spots might be nice.
There are TONS of beautiful parks from which to choose.  As far as indoor
locations, I'd prefer to avoid clubs/bars, but that's just because I'm
bored with the whole drinking/meat-market scene, which is huge in such
venues in the South Bay.

Look, this may be a joke to some people, but I got some _really_ bad QQ
once, so I took the rest of that batch in to have it tested.  Sure enough,
it was a good 90% Boopies.  Why the hell would anyone do this?  I mean, I've
seen my share of substances, but Boopies just aren't my scene.  I know a lot
of people who they've really messed up, to the point of them having to go
into Boopies rehab. Sure, QQ is cool, but you've gotta watch out.

Coming from someone who's taken his fair share of Vicodin (hydrocodone) 
in 500mg pills (6 at once one time) there is no way we're talking about 
the same kind of drug.  People take around 100-200 mg of this "heroin" E 
are swaying back and forth and feeling tingly, hot, and tired.  I'd be 
willing to help to pay for one of these things to be tested, just so I 
know.. I'm so curious...

Last weekend, a friend of mine's mom had some of us throw a "rave" for
her birthday (there were maybe 30 people there, tops). It was really neat
meeting mom's friends and have them meet us. Her mom stayed up late and
watched how we all interacted with each other and was pleased. I thought
it was neat, sort of throwing a bridge across the generations. Now if I
can get _my_ parents to go for that sort of thing....

Did anyone who went to this notice how good the musice was and video.  I 
didn't like how it ended right at two with a screaming stop.  This is 
what I noticed and did not like about it otherwise I like the groves and

What is QQ? And what are boopies...? Please help this clueless girl out...
Also, bad experiences from E (real E) could be from taking too many. It 
causes you to peak really hard and then to CRASH really hard if you take 
two at once. Better to take one and take another later, when you are 
coming down from the first.

Having been involved in the activist community for a long time, I have
run across this sort of thing before. We call it "copbaiting". Do not 
do it. It is _fucked_. If you have evidence (personal evidence, not
a rumor you heard), that is one thing, but to pass along bullshit
rumors just undermines the scene and creates unneccesary paranoia.

It is an old cop tactic, one used with great success in COINTELPRO days,
and the _fear_ of police sting operation is probably far worse than what
the actual thing would be. Think about it: what would happen if the police
were to do such a stupid thing? There would be a great public spotlight
put upon us, and society would see us for the bunch of responsible, loving,
"good citizen" types that we are. It ain't gonna happen. Especially not
in San Francisco, where the DA ran on a "drug laws are the lowest priority"
platform.

Please do not do this.

Peace,
Jim

I'd be totally up for this!!!  There's a few nice Coffee Shops in Downtown San Jose.  Cafe Zucko on 1st st has a nice atmosphere, and damn good coffee!!  Friday nights they have DJs spining ambient and trip hop.

they used to make cough syrup out of it for babies (and others)
it was the edgar poe poison if i remember correctly.
i dont know if what you get off the street is particularly edible,
but heroin is cheap. 
just a random thought.. i dont think it would be ketamine. It isnt very active
orally, and the amounts that you would have to put in to make it worth while 
are higher than the street value of the k (though that seems to
be much more of an eastcoast thing, people have talked about this occuring
in the east too)
i dunno.

The foothills are an idea.  I would also consider some of the less
populous areas on skyine further down south.  If we wanted to try Frost
AMphitheatre and the Mausoleum/Rodin sculpture garden have been used for 
some smaller events but we could be running into some problems there.
Or maybe the knoll whivh is a beautiful white mansion that happens to
double as the Computer Music Research LAb - whose composers by the way
should be heard.  Very interesting electronic equipment.

Actually, it seems like every third person I meet at a rave is from
San Jose.  The people I trek to raves with were all pretty stoked when
we heard that the April Harmony was going to be in the South Bay, it
was like "Wow, a cool party we don't have to drive > 1 hr to get to!"
(Oh well, better luck next time ;)  )

There are certainly the numbers here, the only problem might be the
"It can't be a cool party unless it's in SF/Oakland/whatever" thing.

But hey, count me in!

hi,
	I'm new to the whole Sf scene but not to raves with the spiritual ocean
near by. If anybody heard of Ko Phangan in Thailand (rave island in
Asia, yeah a whole island ) would know, well i,m stuck in San Jose, left
dreaming of hearing the ocean against some trance in the spirit world. 

If 's anyone getting ready to head down to the F-8 party and has anyroom 
I'm willing to chip in for gas and tolls and whatever.

lot of love to all the givers out there.

hugs,

[ to sfraves list ]

 It's good to see some more folks interested in doing events within 
"striking distance" of San Jose! As a Sunnyvale resident, I'd be interested
in what you folks develop. 

 Also , for "nuts-and-bolts" discussions of event logistics , who's 
doing what, etc. , you could try using the dormant 

 sfraves-planners@hyperreal.com 

 mailist. I think the way to subscribe to that list is the same procedure
you used to subscribe to sfraves ( send a message to majordomo@hyperreal.com ).

 I forget whether you have to put "subscribe sfraves-planners" in the
subject line or the body of the message - probably doing both can't hurt!

[ to sfraves list ]

 Just to add a bit of paranoia to the present mix ... I've read that the
usual way narcs bust up a "drug ring" is to arrest some users , looking
for someone with a lot of dope in their possesion. Then , they pressure
that user into narcing for them. So - cops don't have to infiltrate 
someone into a scene , they pressure someone who's already a part of that
scene to inform on the dealers and , worst , their fellow users.

 Have a nice friday ( and have any of your friends been acting , well,
 ODD lately ????....????..??.. )

[more editing}

As I have stated before, every body is a different, chemical-based, 
biosystem. There is always the possibility that someone may have an 
allergic, or otherwise dissimilar, reaction to any chemical that is 
ingested. I'm not saying that is the case here or everytime that someone 
has a wierd reaction to a given substance, but it is one of the many 
possibilities. 

 The above reaction sounds like a reaction to a stimulate to me, but I'm 
no doctor (or pharmacist).

 I know that I need to take less E than most folks (about 100 milligrams) 
to have a great time  =). If I consume 125 milligrams (1/8 gram) or more 
than I start to have similar reactions described above. I usually 
describe it as a reverse of a good experience where I DO NOT love 
everyone and feel generally BAD. Just as a context, I used to get E when 
it was only $8 a dose. The good 'ol days =), before Raves had even hit 
the US of A

The Devil went down to Frisco
He was lookin' for a soul to steal.
He was in a bind, he was way behind
and he was willing to make a deal,

When he came across this young man
circle dancing and playing it hot.
The devil jumped up on a 6 foot speaker,
said, "Boy, let me tell ya what!

"I guess you didn't know it
but I'm a circle dancer too,
and if you care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you.

Now you're a pretty good dancer
but give the Devil his due,
I bet a whistle of gold against your soul
cause I think I'm better 'n' you!"

The boy said, "My name's John S. Lee
and it might be a sin,
but I'll take yer bet and yer gonna regret
cause I'm the best that's ever been!"

John S. Lee you better stretch out
and dance with all your heart,
cause Hell's broke loose in Frisco
and the Devil's dealing hard.

If you win you get this shiny whistle made of gold,
but if you lose, the Devil gets your soul!

The devil whipped out his tennis shoes
and he said, "I'll start this show!"
And fire flew from his fingertips
as he tied the laces in a bow.

He slid across the floor
and those shoes made an evil hiss
The he danced and he twirled and he jumped
and everyone one in the crowd he dissed.

When the devil was finished, 
John S. Lee said, "Well you're pretty good old son,
but sit down and get a backrub from those pretty rave chicks
and let me show you how it's done!"

John danced like a man possessed
but suddenly he couldn't dance anymore.
In the middle of the circle someone built an altar 
and plopped their butts in the middle of the floor!

John S. Lee hung his head

Is pornography degrading to women or sexually liberating for our society?

>From my perspective, what I think is important to understand is that being
disturbed by pornography does not mean a woman is anti-sex or repressed.
The disturbance for me comes from the fact that pornography, almost by
definition, OBJECTIFIES women.  It is a VISUAL medium, focusing on graphic
sex acts and body parts.  Narrative, thought, is largely absent.  This
seems to correspond to a more masculine sexuality, i.e. being turned-on
visually, bodies and acts arousing rather than minds and personalities.
For many women, this impersonal sexuality is inexplicable - and actually
threatening.  Unfortunately for all of us, male sexual response has
translated to a hierarchical social structure (i.e. sexism).

Women experience that objectification based on our bodies - the
dehumanization - every day of our lives.  When we walk down the street, we
are sexually harassed; a blatant power play emphasizing that men like to
impose their sexuality on us without any regard for our consent, simply
because we have female bodies.  The extreme emphasis on our looks
overshadows every aspect of our lives.   Feminism and the women's movement
is our struggle to be evaluated and advance on our merits and talents, to
escape that objectification so that we can actually be acknowledged as
equal human beings.  I strongly suspect that the objectifying male
sexuality is a subconscious basis for the unequal status of women in our
culture.

*Not that there's anything inherently wrong with male sexuality - men are
how they are, getting turned on by seeing breasts is not evil.   However,
the problem arises when that concept of women extends beyond actual sex to
encompass how we are viewed in our entirety.

Also, mainstream porn (made almost exclusively for men) is damaging in that
it is NOT A REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF FEMALE SEXUALITY.  The women are
portrayed as having the exact same sexual response as men.  i.e. there is
no foreplay required, a woman is ready to go at a moment's notice, she is
willing to have sex with anyone in the room without having to have any sort
of relationship with them, and she has uncontrollable orgasms from
intercourse.  As this is, for most women, the diametric opposite of our
actual sexuality, this portrayal discourages paying attention to women's
actual needs.  In that way it is a sexist institution that continues the
dehumanization of women (i.e., does not respect or acknowledge our
different needs from men).  Set that against a backdrop of society
discouraging women to be sexually assertive, and you have tons and tons of
women who cannot communicate just what they really need from a lover.

As for women in porn and prostitution, many claim personal liberation in
the experience.  I think we have to listen to individuals and not pass our
own judgements on their choices.  It is important to realize, however, that
many women in these professions are exploited: someone (a pimp, a producer)
gets most of her earnings, many women are drug-addicted, and many have been
raped or abused.  There ARE, however, healthy people who choose sex work
based on their own morals.  I have known a couple of women who have my
utmost respect as it is their own thoughtful, intelligent, informed
decision (they are students, in business on the side with their own steady
clients - different situation from most street-walkers).

Sex work IN ITSELF does not seem, to me, inherently terrible.  Human beings
need sex, it's pleasure.  So why not contract with someone for the service?
It's just touching, it's being LOVING to someone to give them pleasure.
Pornography is filming people having sex.  The problem seems to lie not in
the fact of sex work, but in its MISUSE - exploited streetwalkers, sexist
portrayals of women.  It is telling that our society feels that any sex
work is disgusting - the only way we can conceive of it is as something
sick, perverted and abusive.  People enjoying pleasure and being kind to
each other without exploitation does not seem to be possible within that
societal mind-set.   Sex work in a culture with a different view of
sexuality would look, I think, entirely different!

Hopefully as a society we can move beyond our current model of sex as a) a
display of dehumanized women for the man, and b) nasty and degrading to
women.  This whole concept of what sex is evidences, to me, the sickness of
our society.  Hopefully we can move toward a healthy, loving, equitable
sexuality - and hopefully the mindset that will birth it is what we are
creating in rave.  (This was my exact topic in a previous post and I caught
a lot of flames for being "offensive"! ).

Change starts with the individual.  For myself, I have thrown away
societal's pressure on my sexuality and proudly claim MY real desires - a
loving relationship, my own pleasure (foreplay), respect and consensuality,
and absolute enjoyment of sex.  I will support erotica and writings and
photography from women - a sexuality that is beautiful, arousing, and
equitable.  I refuse to believe that being disturbed by current pornography
means we cannot be sexually liberated.   Instead, perhaps it means an
entirely new concept of sexuality.

Awaiting angry flames,
Nancy

Nancy,

  I like your overall viewpoint .... but sadly while many people agree
with you - their METHOD for improvement seems to be to create a new form
of puritanism... sort of like dieters or alcoholics - if food or whatever
is being abused just avoid and deny it.... This path leads us into a
spiral of sexual denial which all too often is the path we are lead down...

  So the way we use, express and control our sexualities as a society is 
pathetic at best. I am also still shocked at the double standard - that
a woman who enjoys and/or engages in open and frequent sex acts is "tainted"
which was implied about T. Lords ( if not actually said ). Apparently
the idea that sex is dirty.... and the "will you respect me if I do IT with
you?" question still has a healthy life in our society. Women who become
sex objects of our society all too often end up not only exploited through
objectivication but also end up wearing a modern scarlet letter of 
disapproval.

  On the other hand, many people who express their sexuality publicly such
as Madonna do very little for me at least.... I don't find her sexuality
particurly liberating or respect oriented (IMO of course). I don't think
of her as bad but merely representing a sexuality that lacks real 
romantic sentiment, respect or deep person to person contact. So from male
pronographers to female sex mistresses we too often lack good models for a
healthy sexuality ... and let's not even begin to talk about religious or
at least christian training regrading sex.....


  What we need is a really great tantric master on Channel 50.... ;-)

 Mike

Warning: kinda long...

After a rather bad week, I needed to do some dancing.  Our plans of keeping 
the night a sedate one were changed when our non-rave visitor from Kansas 
decided she didn't have the energy to bop, and suddenly it became a RAVE 
NIGHT.  So all the little kiddies skipped off into the night in search of 
adventure...

I was overruled on the beach party.  As much as I've always wanted to go to 
a rave on the beach overlooking the ocean at night, it still hasn't 
happened.  <heavy sigh>  No, the draw last night was Doc Martin, so the 
target of our mission was ... Fusion!

This was held at the Jerrold St. deli <quiet grumbling>.  The music was 
*very* good, the lighting was ok, the acid visuals were good, and ... drum 
roll ... the A/C was working!  :)  Ok, I figured I ought to say that since 
that was the major gripe going around after one party a while back...  ;)  
It still gets pretty toasty upstairs, but heat rises, and with 700+ bodies 
(my estimate), you have to expect that.  Also, a new twist in decoration, 
there were these beach blowup toys, (a few beach balls, a shark raft, a 
hippo raft) and they were spray painted in DayGlo colors and hung across the 
dance area right where the black lights would hit them.  Very nice effect, I 
thought, a la DV8 and the dolphin room with a psychadelic touch.  There was 
some fun artwork upstairs where they were selling smart drinks and fruit -- 
always a welcome addition.

Prior to Doc coming out the black lights were turned off.  :(  I like black 
lights, but I guess it was just a little bright in there for someone.  
Still, by that time, I was so into dancing and boogying, the strobes and 
acid visuals were just fine.

Cool moment: some guy was going around selling glo sticks, so a lot of 
people were playing with them.  Since they were on strings, some folks would 
just spin them in circles over their head or whatever.  I was looking up and 
tripping on the guys overhead that had two glo sticks in one hand, red and 
green, and spining them in a circle.  Faster, slower, depending on the 
music.  The effect was weird...

Cool moment: I chatted with a pixie!  Ya gotta give it to people who come to 
a party with a gimmick.  There was a girl in a fairy outfit, complete with 
wings and sparkles on her face, informing people that she was a pixie.  
There was also a guy there with the cat-in-the-hat hat and the four fingered 
cartoon gloves.  I love that get-up -- I should get one for myself...

Cool moment: By coming to Fusion, I got a chance to talk to Stacey in person 
and get things straightened out regarding the stupid rumors going around and 
the negativity online the other day.  She was very sweet about it -- no 
karate chops or kicks to the kneecaps. 8)   So let's set the record 
straight: Tom and Stacey did NOT get the original space for "All in the 
Family" busted.  They throw parties.  'nuff said.  And Tom and Stacey are 
NOT narcs, like that should need saying.   Although she did share with me 
that they are in fact aliens who are intent on stealing all the pop rocks in 
the world -- seems pop rocks are beyond their technology...  (oh no! another 
rumor!)

The Vibe: It was ok.  I think there's just a certain vibe at events like 
Sunset or Chrysalis that are tough to come by.  I had a good time, but there 
wasn't a group energy that I could detect.  I came across some ravers with 
toys and candy and we hung for a bit, but even they didn't really seem into 
it.  It was just a good night to dance...

Unfortunately my crew pooped out before Doc came on, and we left about 5 
minutes before he was supposed to start.  :(

Bad moment:  Can I gripe about how the deli is run?  This has nothing to do 
with how the party itself was produced.  I got a clear cut example of 
immediate inflation last night when I bought one orange for $.40 and then 
five minutes later tried to buy another one and was told it was $.75.  Not 
that $.75 is going to break me anytime soon, but I was offended.  This is 
the treatment I have come to expect.  Look, there's a guy that works behind 
the counter with a moustache.  He's cool, he doesn't size you up and try to 
figure out how much he can take you for.  He charges you a fair price.  
Shoot, I bet he'd be cool to party with, even.  There's a woman behind the 
counter, and she's Satan in drag, the Anti-Raver.  She'll jack the price up 
on you in a heartbeat.  She tries to stick it to me everytime I walk up to 
the counter.  She'd probably try to charge you for a napkin...  And of 
course, water is $3 (probably more if Satan-woman is selling them) with no 
refills allowed -- at least in the guys restroom.  Fortunately there's 
usually a lady in the group I go with, so we're covered, but it's a hassle 
just the same.

Hi everybody- my name's John, and I wanted to (re)introduce myself,
having just (re)subscribed to sfraves...  I'm moving to the South Bay
from Vail, Colorado, where I was on mtn-raves, which is a very 
beautiful community of people!  (I will miss dancing with them!!!!!)

I'm really excited to be living in the bay area, and psyched to reconnect
with the sharp minds and warm hearts of this area's community...  I've 
been on the WELL since 1991 or something-- and plan to be there forever.
I was on this list before-- in 1994 while traveling with some infamous
(and slightly mis-judged) UK rave promoters and performers called the 
"zippy pronoia tour"...   (yeah yeah, I know I know).  We threw a few good
parties in the Bay region, in conjunction with the awesome SPAZ crew,
most notably the "Jupiter Bash" in downtown SF the night that comet
smashed into the planet Jupiter.   

Anyway, I've been meditating up in the Rockies, snowboarding and weaving
websites for the company I'm a producer for-- Eagle River Interactive.
We've just opened a Mountain View office, and so I jumped at the chance
to come out here.  I hope to move into the City by the end of the summer
and commute via Caltrain.

Looking forward to meeting lots of you, and groovin at some of those
famous beach parties this summer!!!

PeaceLoveUnityRespect
John

I just realized this morning that in about 6 weeks I will be leaving 
Northern California and returning (at least for a little while) to my old 
stomping ground behind the Orange Curtain in southern California.  I was 
wondering if anyone could give me info on good rekkid stores in the 
Orange County area.  I would be looking for the usual stuff:  progressive 
house, electro, some drum&bass etc.  Anyway, thanks!

Hey all!

Ok, I'm finally intrigued enough to find out how to do it.  So how 
exactly do those "signatures" work?  Is that something your ISP should 
provide you, or is it a separate program you have to obtain?  Can 
somebody help me figure this out?  Thanks!  :)


Love,
Shawna

acme


(I thought about just leaving it at that one word, but realize that there 
is more to be said)

one bottle of water included with entry fee:  very cool

wasn't very crowded, which is good, but it took a toll on the vibe 
factor.  I got my dancing in but I can't say I got my hootin' and 
hollerin' in.

alittle bit sticky but nothing unbearable.

since the building is basically a long hallway, lots of traffic causes 
disruption to dancers, however last night it was not so pushy, just alot 
of weaving.

concistent beats.  I suppose that would be house in the main room.  
alittle bit more techno-y in the basement but still housey speeds.  I did 
catch a break in there and that was a joyous but brief moment indeed.

can't wait to do the Wickedslip(tm) next week...

Hi, it's your favorite(?) Swede with yet another REALLY
stupid question. ;) Does anyone know where I can get a
good record case for an even better price? See, I'll be
bringing a few records with me across the Atlantic when
I go home, and I don't have anything but my trusty record 
bag to carry 'em in. The bag will work fine for part of
my collection, but the rest will have to be checked in at
the airport. So obviously, I need something that's sturdy,
and has locks on it. Any ideas? Anyone have a used one for
sale even? Thanks a bundle! =)

reeeespect, jonas

p.s. I still have them 1200s. =)

This is probably not the right forum for this kind of thing,
but since it's kind of music-related, I'll take my chances.
=) When I leave (in exactly 3 weeks), I'll have to leave some
stuff behind. And I'd really like to get rid of it. Preferably
to people I like, and then YOU sprung into mind! =) Well, here's
what I need to sell:

* 1 Harman-Kardon 3250 Receiver. I paid $319.97+tax for it in 
February '96, and the warranty will keep it running right up to 
Feb 2001. =)
* 1 pair of DCM KX10 speakers. They have a 10" bass woofer, a
6" midrange, and a 3/4" tweeter. Bought them at the same time as
the receiver. They are WONDERFUL, and if I had any choice, I
would NOT part with them...
* 1 Packard Bell 14" monitor. This one is going REALLY cheap! It's
about 4 months old.
* 2 Technics SL1200Mk2 turntables. =)

If you're interested, let me know! =)

reeespect, jonas

I am dileariously excited and a little nervous as my impending moonpup uk
tour begins....(no dates thus far.....and counting) 
 
I just wanted to thank those of you who have contributed to the discusions
and debates during my first 4 months on the net........you have helped give
me a crash course in mac internet 101........ 
 
I have learned a lot about comunication (both good and bad) and you have
all helped me to move into the 21st century. I will miss having my computer
so readily available, but after I arrive in the uk, I will get set up with
some kind of ability to post from the uk so look for me soon..... 
 
......meanwhile, I would like you to welcome the person who has helped me
to make this trip possible by sub-renting my house. His name is Eric D and
I met him through SFRaves. (he is from DCRaves, and has posted on SFR) he
is going to move here, and he will use my pad to transition himself to S.F.
 
 
please help to give him a warm SF welcome, and show him why we are
considered such a progressive and friendly place. 
 
As I will not be un-subscribing to SFR, Eric will be posting on my
computer, starting after wednesday (may 1st)........until my return.... 
 
while I am gone, (until approx burning man time) my phone # and e-mail
address will stay connected, and so you can still leave me messages, and
Eric will help relay info to me........... 
 
I hope you all have a delicious summer, and I look forward to seeing some
of you at burning man later this year........moonpup     I will not leave
till Tuesday at 3pm if you need to contact me.........moonpup

"Paranoia strikes deep, into you life it will creep"

Another thought...
Sorry to say that a lot of younger than I ravers think that because 
someone is in their mid thirties or forties that they are a narc.
 
I remember a Sunset a while back where a male friend of mine age 44 was 
actually asked, "Are you a narc?" He just laughed.

People need to become more observant and much greater readers of 'energy'.
I don't care how polished in a role a cop or rat might be, they can't hide 
their hearts.

Also, many folks need to be a  
bit less judgemental...I just have to talk about this here even 
though I know non of you have made such acusations.  Anyway, I recommend 
that these folks take an hour to observe the aledged narc and see who 
they are hugging at the party, or perhaps who they share their heart pipes 
with.  

Now on a possibly really paranoid side, I did see two folks this evening 
who radiated a narc-like vibe.  What I thought I was reading was a spying 
energy...Believe me there are organizations within the walls of right 
wing fascist Christian churches who do in fact gather the sinful facts & 
information (pagans, drugs, sex, indescent clothing) which is used during 
sermons against us (remember these people have increasingly enormous 
clout as voters).  Perhaps it was parents spying on their sons and daughters 
who just don't like their kids being there.  E.g. my dad once spied on me 
from the Hermosa Beach Pier when I was 12 having just a little too much 
fun on the beach--grounded for two weeks)  Anyway, I bear a watchful eye 
all the time, as a warrior a macumazon (he who sleeps with one eye open)  
as a guardian watching for anything potentially 
harmful to our House.    

And to end on a positive note....  I arrived after 6 tonight and when 
Galen went on, it was simply amazing, one of the Bay areas's best Dj's 
IMHO... Anyone taping  tonight?  Man I would love a tape of his set...

If interested, at the next Sunset, you can find me... I always wear a big 
straw hat with lots of weird and interesting shit hot glued to the brim...  
until sunset..

Lastly, often folks ask for good energy sent their way...my mom (age 67) 
is visiting this Saturday for a week.  From the deepest place in my heart 
I want to share my 'church' so to speak with her..  take her to a day 
small party.  I humbly ask for the energy of patience be sent my 
way..good thoughts, so that I can give this to  her in a gentle beauty way.

Thanks and always peace...

Maureen

Mr. Kirk?

Yes?

Do you have a son named Robin, Robin Kirk, age 17?

Yes.

I'm sorry Mr. Kirk.  You'd better come down to the station house.  Your 
son is dead.

Dead? H..h...how?

He died of an overdose.

Ah...

Another great sunset...

I'm also wondering if anyone taped this particular Sunset. Specifically  the first set by Felix. I 
just love this more downtempo dub/funk stuff, especially on a beautiful hot sunny afternoon. 

It was a very nice change of pace musically and should have satisfied the many who have 
mentioned in the past a desire for more musical variety at Sunsets.

Anyway... If anyone knows someone who taped the earlier sets yesterday...

peace,
martin

Greetings Friends!

Freaky Chakra and Single Cell Orchestra LIVE tonite at MAD, plus Joe Rice
and Jon Santos.

We've made some significant changes to the set up including moving the djs
out of that horrible booth... yuch.. and a few other important tweeks.

One other important note: the owner is super freaky about drug use. If you
want to smoke or wahteve please go outside (there are ins and outs) as
anyone seen using inside will be asked to leave (by the management not us!)
Also bring those ids!

None of us are very happy about any of the above, so this may be the last
MAD at V.

hope to see you there, shoud be a great show
ethan

After driving home from Portland and dropping the SF members of C-Lab off,
my friend Eric and I thought we'd check out Sunset for a little while before
we drove back to Sacramento.  We got there just as the sun was setting, and
cashing a few karma points, scored a great parking place really close to the
festivities.  We proceeded to dance to the sounds of Galen, and almost
immediately were entranced.  It was really tribal at first with lots of hand
drum type sounds, then after a couple of songs I heard a nice round 303
sound going WOUMP WOUMP....WOUMP WOUMP.... And for some reason, more than
usual I started to really get into it.  I was flailing all over place, and
the croud started getting a little crazey too.  People seemed to be really
"in it" at that point.  I danced really hard through that song, then out of
know where, this oh so familiar breakbeat comes in and the sample "this is
it", and the crowd goes nuts.  It was "Helter Skelter" by Meat Beat
Manifesto.  This is one of my favorite songs of all time, and I have only
heard it one other time at a rave in my life.  Needless to say, I went
ballistic at this point and so did everyone else.  People were screaming and
buggin out and I just loved it.  I was so tweaked after that song that I had
to go rest.  Walked around, ran into some friends from Sac, then headed home.  

Thank you Galen for playing that song, it really caped off the weekend in
all the best ways.

Thanks for listening.

Rick

Oh the love I felt and shared! I had a great time! There were so many
beautiful people! I couldn't believe I was hearing Helter Skelter, what a
classic! The sunset was so awesome....True storie...I had brought with me a
backpack full of candy....I was planning on passing it out, well I never got
a chance too, and I think there was a reason, because, when I was leaving I
heard someone screaming,"Does anyone have any candy??" I thought oh I do, So
I said yes, I looked down on the street and some girl had  gone into insulin
shock(diabetic shock) Im not sure, but I busted out my Andes Candies, my
rocky roads, and my kit kats, and this girl ate chocolate like mad! Well I
guess it helped her, because she seemed to be doing better after 20 candy
bars! End of true story! Hope you all had as great a time as I did!
Peace love and chocolate!

Bounce was an odd party ....

First, it was NOT $5 before 11, they said they have no idea why that got posted
- and it was at the Acme, but it wasn't ever really crowded, so that was ok, but
it kept you wondering when people were going to arrive...

I actually saw NO ONE I even recognized until 2:30 a.m. when I saw Spun (which
is part of the reason I went) ...  

But the house music upstairs kept me very happy all night long...  I had a fine
thoughtful, primarily solo night, a nice change...

Have to mention there was a beautiful and amazing live ambient performance by a
group called Soulstice with electronic drums, violin, keyboard and a wonderful
vocalist --- they played for hours, it was so beautiful, I felt blessed to be
there!

The mark of a good DJ is that they know what song to play next, ulitmately
it doesn't matter what type of music one is into, if you play from your heart
and are sensitive to the crowd, you will be guided to the Next Record in your
crate, when this happens, you go beyound being a "trance DJ" or a "House DJ"
you simply identify with just being a DJ.

Hummmm, I had a mixed time.

I went with Renaud who really is a blast and he made the evening good fun
but the party?.....

When we first got there the music was EAR BLISTERINGLY LOUD.  It was
postively painful and most un-fun.  After a while I asked them to turn it
down (telling them that people were leaving because of it - little white
lie in a good cause) and they did a little.  After that it was just
extremely loud.  In fact you couldn't even hear people whoot and holler or
whistle - to me that just killed the community vibe - no aural contact
between fellow ravers.

And people seemed to be very withdrawn.  I had to basically stand right in
front of people and force them to smile in order to connect.  Dancing was
low key, with very few people really letting loose except to amazing
circle dancers who were fun to watch but - again - no community feeling.

Also, people puking in the toilets and talking about puking and many
people so fried that they didn't even seem to know where they were.

EVEN SO - the music was good and trippy, the visuals were quite nice and
the space was lovely - an old victorian town hall type building.  What the
hell, I danced hard and had a good time anyway.  BUT it DEFINITELY wasn't
worth $20. 

Where's the PLUR?

Jess

So true, so true, and yes indeed there DO seem to be some "crispy critters"
walking around our Scene these days.  I don't know whether they are "Narcs"
or Spies for the Right or just unskilled Drug Fiends but some of them tend to
give one pause.  I don't think it's anything to get paranoid about, a little
common sense and some observation should do the trick.  Share your heart most
of all, show them that the Scene _is not_ simply about how many drugs you can
score/take/sell, etc but something that runs much deeper than that.  Maybe
eventually they will come to understand (maybe not)...

All in all...

                Be vigilent/send love.

        My friend Jeremy and I got to the location just after 10pm.  Only a
few others were there, and the people setting up on the beach.  We went
down the trail, and a guy was setting glo stix along the trail to help
people find their way.  We helped move the turntables to a place that
wouldn't get wet, and explored the area a bit.
        Very nice place!  There were lots of little rock statues all over
the place, and the left half of the area, just before the cliff rose from
the beach, consisted of small cleared spots in the rocks, perfect for
people to spread blankets, stash their stuff, and chill (or should I say
warm?) between dancing, etc.  There were some tunnels and climbs up the
cliffs, and the entire area was a large alcove, with the water meeting the
rocks on both sides.
        I was very happy to hear lots of trance, at just the right speed to
dance to.  My friend Nicole and I found each other, and were very happy and
impressed by the music and the location.  Before we parted, she called my
attention to the music and said "THIS is what I mean by 'beautiful
trance'!"  I concurred and enjoyed.
        This was my first beach party, and dancing under the moon and stars
(some of them shooting!) was fun and very special!  I found that it's hard
to dance on the sand unless you don't do much stepping/stomping.  People
were mostly moving from the knees up, with some easy steps, but not
elaborate as on a floor.  It was a nice change of pace.
        Somewhere in the middle of the party, the music was faster, and I
couldn't keep up, so I rested and hung out with Jeremy at our spot.  We
invited the people below us to hang out, and we sat and talked for a while.
When we felt we could brave the cool night some more (it never got too
cold), we went off again.
        I found Crunchman, and he gave me a body tune-up.  It helped my
circulation and loosened my shoulders, and made me good to dance some more.
Gradually, the tide encroached upon our dance space, reclaiming it little
by little.  The moon was well gone, but there were lots of beautiful stars
out.  Many of us danced at the edge of the water.  I noticed that people
were still friendly, smiling and groovin' to the tunes.
        I stood on a rock in defiance of the tide, and when the water hit
the rock, it splashed up and thoroughly drenched my jeans from mid-thigh
down :P  I thought it was hillarious, but couldn't dance very well after
that, so I returned to the little campsite for the remainder of the
morning, as the sky was brightening.  Jeremy and I were among the last to
leave.
        There were lots of people sucking on balloons that night, but those
days are long over for me, so I just observed amusedly.  It seemed that
people weren't as sociable as usual overall, but maybe that was due to the
cold, or the small number of people there (the crowd never got too big,
which was nice).  The size of the event made it feel more intimate, though,
like it was our event instead of an event put on for us.  A good time all
around, I must say!

looking forward to more beach/outdoor parties,

- E

	Right.

	I would just like to add that these "dual-sets" don't seem so
	wonderful to me... (two DJs spinning together). Three of them 
	were advertised for _All Together Now_, but the sample I heard 
	has not been convincing at all.
	I personnally think that what I listened to was mostly 2 mixes 
	played together, not one mix played by two DJs.. It didn't
	sound *correct* except during short periods of time (minutes,
	I would say).

	Well, I guess it depends on the DJs too, of course.
	But Surge who done a good job at _Progress_ wasn't impressive 
	at all when mixed (I would say, destroyed) with another guy
	last night.
	Any DJ's opinion about those NxM mixes?

	All in all, the music at _All Together Now_ seemed quite diversified
	to me--i.e. too diversified, lacking of an homogeneity on which 
	to grow even your personnal vibe (hopefully, Jess is a vibe
	by herself--she saved the party ;-).

	So it was not worth 20 bucks, even if the lights 
	were great!

Speaking of that party, could you believe that voice mail?-all he talked
about was how fuckin awesome Depth Charge is(hey I like him to, but he's no
fucking GOD)  and how may record labels he's on, exactly which record
lables he's on, that you should definately go to you nearest record store
and check him out..bla bla...is this a party or a promotional event for DC
records??..how fuckin cool the visuals will be (by this time I know it was
$20), it was ~7-8 min. before this guy shut up! Just tell me who's spinnin,
how much and were it is-thats all i need.
Hype hype and more hype, after that i decided on a quite night.

Mark

______________

I agree with Mark here ... I've wanted to share some suggestions for voice mail
messages from promoters....  I'm sure not everyone will agree with these, but
these are my thoughts .....


1. TELL US HOW MUCH IT COSTS!!!  If it's $20 say so!  Tell us you wish it could
be less but at least say how much it is!  Why is this kept a secret so often?  

2. I'd prefer you don't ramble on about your philosophical beliefs -- if you
want to share a spiritual message that is the theme of the party, that's great,
but please make it brief and thought-out.  (I do like when we're reminded to
bring a smile and positive vibe, that can't hurt!)  There was a voicemail for a
party a few months ago that went on and on with the oddest, most vague greek god
story that my friends and I called it three times just for laughs -- needless to
say, we didn't go to that party.

3.  Be punctual -- if you say you'll post directions after 8pm, please do that.
If it's 9pm and there's no message yet, we have to wonder if you've been busted,
lost the space, or are just not organized (not a good sign for the party in
general)

4.  Keep the music at the beginning to a minimum -- I swear I've heard messages
with two or three full minutes of music (a long long time when you're waiting to
get information) before a word was said.  (It's also nice if the music you play
represents what we might hear at the party.)  And make sure the music isn't so
loud we can't hear you talking!

5.  Please tell us where the party is first... then give directions.... if it's
in downtown SF, why start with "if you're coming from Sacramento.... " in the
directions first.

6. Don't insult us or overstate the lineup -- the guy on the All in the Family
Line said something like "if you don't know who this guy is then you don't know
music and you better get on it" or something ... yep, that made me feel all warm
and fuzzy ....  

The voicemail is our first introduction to lots of parties, and it's always nice
to get off on the right foot!  Thanks for listening....

Leslie  : )

Subject: Reed College is Crazy (weekend recap) (long)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Spent the weekend up at Reed College for thier annual "Renn. Faire".  Can I
just say these people are completely nuts.  We (Consciousness Lab) were
scheduled to play ambient music as part of the festivities for the event.
We played live music and dj'd for about 20 hours.  It was totally fun and I
met several really cool people.  They had a big tent with a pretty large
sound system set up and dj's spun there both Friday and Saturday night.  I
was told that the Saturday night tent got shut down early by the cops
because of several noise complaints. 
It was really cool for the time it was going though....although it was quite
cold at night there.

I experienced more out of the ordinary things this weekend than....well..
uh..than I get the pleasure of normally experiencing.

This Renn Faire thing.....I just couldn't belive it.  I was told that the
college funds the whole thing.  There were over 70 kegs of free beer. (I'm
not into alcohol, but still....wow!)  There was a big bug eating contest,
which I wasn't into either, but had to watch a little just for the
experience.  People were seeing who could out bid each other to get to eat
the bug.  They would start at like $10, then the next person would say "I'll
eat it for $9...and so on all the way down to like $1.  There were bugs that
were several inches long involved in this thing.....  Yuck!  It was amazing
to see so many people gathered around to see this spectical.  

They had naked blue people.  About 30 of them....naked, painted blue that
just ran around the campus shrieking and halloring, jumping up and down, and
being generally mischievious.  They chased lots of people.   I wish I would
have known before hand about them, cuz it looked like alot of fun.

They had a 200 foot long naked slip-n-slide down this grassy hill.  I don't
know if any of you have ever naked slip-n-slided before, but I highly
recommend it.  It was a blast.  Why am I thinking of Karen from Canada...I
have a feeling she would have liked this.

They had a free feast.  Tons of free food on Saturday.

They had bagel carts.  These people with tons-o-bagels in a cart just
pushing it around giving them away day and night.

And Water people...walking around giving out free bottled water. 

They had a crazy custome bicycle race.  They made psychotic looking bikes
out of other bike parts.  Crazy chopper bikes with the peddels two feet off
the ground.  One guy wrapped his bike in construction paper, lit it on fire
and proceeded to ride it around with the flames all around him.  I was
amazed that he didn't catch on fire himself.  Once the paper had burned
through there were many bottle rockets attached to the frame which shot off
in all directions.  COMPLETELY INSANE!!!!!

M-80's going off all around. BOOM!

There was free expression in every shape and form immaginable.

The dorm we played in was co-ed with co-ed bathrooms.  Not that spectacular,
but I thought it was cool that they were that open.

People smoking what ever they wanted at all times and places.

Free warm air!  There was this vent thing that people were just standing on.
It was shooting warm air up to the sky.  About four people could experience
it at once.  We stayed there for about 45 minutes.  We had no idea where it
was coming from or if it was toxic or not....but we, in our ....uh...well
the state of mind we were in...didn't really care.  The free warm air was
fantastic.  We poured water on it and it split into millions of little drops
and hovered a few feet off the ground then disbursed.....or I could have
just been seeing things....but the other people saw it too.

The nicest people.

A totally beautiful campus.

Music of all kinds everywhere all the time.  Several different areas with
lots-o-bands galore.

One of the greatest experience yet so far this life.

On Saturday night, Gateway Sound put on a Light party in the same area of
Portland, and Brad and Seth from C-Lab went and dj'd ambient music.  The
seemed to have alot of fun, but we didn't talk much about it.  I think the
party "went off" though.  When we picked up the boys around 4:30 a.m. the
whole building was thumpin and all the windows were vibrating.  I think it
was good.

I'm sure there were many more things that happened but I really havn't slept
much the past three days, and I'm sure I'll remember later.

Bye.

Rick

Hey hey!

I went to the party as well and I had totally amazing time.  Maybe it 
was just because it was my first outdoor night party, or maybe because I 
am pretty new to this entire rave scene...  

I spend most of the time next to the fire because I was cold and tired and 
dancing on the sand was a little hard at times :).  I met some really fun 
people and although I don't even know/remember many of their names I 
would like to thank all of them for creating the friendly atmosphere. 

About balloons....  the only thing that bugged me a little bit was that 
the guy was very closed to me and the sound of the baloons beeing filled 
up got to be a little annoying (it felt like it was destroying the magic 
of the place).  But I guess it made many people happy, so...

I loved it and I can't wait for another outdoor, night party...  I wish 
more of my friends were there, because it was *beautiful*.

Hugz,
Branka

P.S.  Thanks to Melissa for taking me and to everybody who participated 
(I have no clue how all that equipment got dragged to the beach - I had 
hard time getting my back-pack and myself down).

Nice thought, but generally false. I actually had opportunity to ask a cop
about this once and he basically laughed at the suggestion. I've read that
legally they may have to, but there are several exceptions, such as if they
feel they'd be endangering themselves by admitting the truth.

y'know, i wondered about that myself, but since everybody was smiling, i
figured they were just quietly enjoying themselves....would've been nicer
if they'd shared the warmth.

Yeah, that's the difference between being required to do something and
actually doing it.  In theory, they're supposed to divulge, but in
reality...

  Bring old cardboard boxes, straighten them out, and place on the sand.  
Makes for a wonderful personal dancing platform!!  Great way to make 
use of the 3 R's: Reduce, REUSE, Recycle.  But, don't forget to take it away 
when your done so as to not cause any more littering to our environment!

However, by law they cannot partake of any of the substances they are trying
to bust someone for.  In the case of marijuana, this is easy enough.  If
whoever is selling it thinks that a potential customer is kind of sketchy,
he could just offer him a hit off his pipe.  I guess this doesn't work as
well with ingestible products, though...

Just a thought,
Jake

First, please excuse me for wasting bandwidth with this.  But, I needed 
to tap the wisdom of the ppl on this list. :)

My student email account is going to expire on May 20th because, well, I 
ain't a student any more!!  I was hoping they wouldn't find out, but they 
did, and now I need a new IP.  Could someone/anyone give me some advice?  
I know very little about this whole thing.  What I need is something 
cheap, I'm not interested in WWW access.  I DO NOT have windows, but only 
DOS  (yeah, I know--a wood burning computer, but I'm saving my money for 
a new one!!)

Any info would be *greatly* appreciated.  I will be doing my own research 
on the topic, but I wanted to get any extra advice I could.  Please, send 
me the info personally, I don't want to waste any more space than I 
already have :)

Thanks in advance... :)

luv,

(BSR = Blatent Self Review)

Hey kids!

As a member of Gateway Systems, I know it's a little unprofessional for me
to do due a review of our party in Portland, but someone's gotta do it, and
so I will try and be as objective as possible...

Gateway shredded the fucking walls off Portland Saturday night!

Okay, maybe that's a little vague.  And let me start at the beginning...

I was looking forward to this event because it would give me some quality
time with some of the people I've come to love in the SF rave community.
Since most of our time is spent frantically setting-up, frantically dancing
or working shifts, or frantically breaking down, I was excited about calmly
sharing meals and just plain relaxing with the likes of Claire, John,
Ethan, Jenny, Minor Minor, Monty, Michelle, Joe Rice, Greg & Cindy, Wayne,
Dave, Joel, Holly, and a host of others.  It was to me like an SF rave
field trip, and that made it all the more special.  It even felt a little
like a field trip when Monty started telling us sick and twisted stories in
the back of the van on the way from the airport to the space.   (Use your
imagination, but unless you have a penchant for Milkbone Dog Biscuits, you
won't even come close...;^)

The space was an Acme style, art studio that supposedly has no one living
there, however it seemed like there was an endless stream of people coming
out of the multitude of rooms through out the day.  They were all cool and
friendly and were down with the party, so that was nice and made set-up
(and the party) go smoothly.  There was a sizable hallway in which the
ambient area was set-up, and Claire and Michelle worked the usual Gateway
magic with the space (it was beautiful, replete with shrine.  Definitely a
labor of love.)  Upstairs there was a large dance area with a gymnasium
style floor (good for dancing!).  The sound was amazing.  I honestly felt
that since it was so crisp, and so clear, it was actually *good* for your
ears.  Like a little eardrum work-out, without over stressing them.  Four
stacks in the corners; balanced perfectly.  Lights (by Dave) and laser (by
Joel) made the room into a den of visual treasure.  Juice bar by Holly for
tasty treats.  Upstairs, from the main floor was a nice chill area that
looked down on the dancers in revelry.  Upstairs even further was a huge
roof deck.  (Which people were thoroughly enjoying until some asshole threw
an orange peel at a security guard below and that forced us to clear the
roof in a hurry.  Kudos to the party goers for not questioning our request
that they vacate the roof quickly, so that by the time the three security
people got up there it was barren.)

The stage was set for a wonderful party, the place decked, the sound ready,
energy was at a high-vibe level.

Appreciate the SF scene - reason #1:  The door

We had more fucking excuses, stories, and blatant lies than I've ever seen
at an SF party.  Part of the problem was that the Modish building is known
for parties, and the people that live there have lots of friends, so, many
people came up saying that they knew so-and-so and should get in free.  We
tried to explain that $10 was very reasonable and that we were only
covering costs, which we were, but that didn't seem to have much of an
effect on people.  What we later realized is that Portland's scene is at an
interesting point, and so people are not accustomed to respecting the
promoters/party (maybe?).  It made me realize how nice it is in SF where
the majority of people respect the door and don't try and weasel their way
in.  We didn't let the door hassles bring us down though, relying on karma
to take its revenge on those that lied straight to our faces.  (I don't
know, maybe they'd pull a muscle or something.  Or get a parking ticket.
:^p)

Appreciate the SF scene - #2:  The music

Ladies and gentlemen, I have to say, I have not heard such flawless DJing
out of every single DJ in the same night.  The line-up went Joe Rice, Minor
Minor, Ethan, John Carel, Monty.  It was amazing.  The people were frantic,
out of their heads.  I don't know if they've ever heard such quality
workmanship.  Combined with the quality of the sound, all one can say
is...sublime.  Unfortunately I missed most of Joe's set because I was
listening to lame excuses at the door, but what I snuck up to hear was nice
powerful techno.  Frank took the stage next and spun an amazing set.  So
good was his set, that John was dancing as I had never seen him dance
before.  The party by this time was (excuse the expression) balls-out!  We
knew it was heading totally off the Portland charts and I think that lent
even more energy to everyone there.  (The excitement in knowing you're
setting a benchmark, or rather, making history.)  If you've seen Frank
spin, you know the more into it he gets, the lower he gets to the decks.
Let's just say that Frank and I were seeing eye-to-eye through most of his
set.  ;^)

Meanwhile C-lab sent down a representative from Reed to spin a long set in
the chill area, followed by Darkstar [? Darkhorse], followed by Rob.  Very
swarthy, cool, ambient music too, from Portishead to Paul's Boutique and
everything in between.  Again I lament not being able to be in two places
at once, for I always miss the best ambient areas.

(Special moment for Tony:  In the middle of Frank's set I turned around and
saw Ethan, Joe and Monty all in a line dancing that sub-dude DJ dance and
couldn't help but feel proud to be friends with some of the top brass in
the SF scene, and paused for a moment to appreciate how cool, and
unpretentious they are.  I turned around again a moment later and John
Carel had joined them and that made my smile even wider.  You should have
seen Frank's smile when he looked up and saw them all smiling at him.
Unforgettable!)

The music was fast by this time, fast and hard and driving and
techno/techno trance/acid trance -- Fucking Acid Trance (FAT!) -- what have
you.  Ethan took control after Frank and spun to the hoots and hollers of
the crowd.  The party was in full swing.  It was amazing to see the
syncronicity from DJ to DJ.  Ethan picked up and took the party higher, and
higher and higher.  People were literally turning in amazement and
shrieking and dancing.  John came on and amazingly kept the energy
building.  It was toward the end of John's set that reliable sources stated
that "this may be the best party to ever happen in Portland."  Now I won't
go so far as to say that, but shit, given that this would have been one of
the best parties so far this year in SF, there most likely is some basis
for believing what they say.

John drove the decks like an Italian race car driver: fast, furious,
flawless, with confidence and passion.  The man was the shit!  (I really
must say, the *men* were the shit!  It would be an injustice to single
anyone out, it was amazing teamwork.)  If this were a Crunchman review,
insert "this is when I really started moving my ass."  I later learned John
dusted off some old records, pre my indoctrination to the scene, and man
did they rock.  At one point he mixed something so powerful it truly
sounded like a freight train was running through the building.

Appreciate the SF scene - #3:  Musical Diversity

Monty came on and dropped some seriously housey records.  It was a slight
change-up from the previous DJs, but it was a great way to show the
diversity that we can bring from SF, and how the DJs, working together can
offer more than one style in a night.  (I know it's heavily debated, but
the music you like is out there in SF, you just have to go find it.)
Toward the end Monty spun some fast-house/acid house -- Phat Housey Acid
Trance (PHAT!) -- that had the majority of people dancing at that late
hour.

When it was all over, a big circle and some thank yous sent the Portland
ravers on their way, and there was no lack of broad grins and wild staring
eyes as if to say "did that really just happen here, in Portland?!"  We
were proud, happy, and tired.  Clean-up, slept, eat and came home.

Appreciate the SF scene #4: The People

I can't say enough about the people in the underground scene in SF.  I am
so proud to say that I'm a part of it, the words flow out of me coated with
pride like a donut coated with sugar.  It takes a party away from the scene
to help realize what you have at home.

Appreciate the SF scene #5:  The Scene

Keep it alive people, and appreciate every moment, for it will not last
forever, and when you're old and crusty, you will have the most amazing
stories to tell someone else's grandkids.  Plus, it's so nice to have
someone ask "When would a good weekend be for me to come visit SF to have a
good time?"  and be able to respond, "Dude, *any* weekend!"  :^)

Thanks to Gateway, the Modish people, Manage' [sp] (our host and liaison)
and everyone who made it a trip worthwhile.

Peace and love!

Tone

P.S.  Sunday afternoon, as we were all hanging around resting, a woman came
up to us and said, "I have lived in this building for a long time, and
there has never been a better party in all that time.  Thank you so
much...when are you coming back?"  All we could do was smile, thank her,
and assure her very soon.

I completely agree with all of Leslie's suggestions.  I have one more 
reason to shorten the voice mail message:  Many MANY of us are calling 
outside the area code!  I swear, I could spend about a buck on just 
finding out where the party is!  Not all of us are fortunate enough to 
have a 415 preceeding our phone number...

love,
Amy (a 916er for now)

Y'know, this smacks of the "ten commandments"...

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF PARTY PHONE MESSAGES:

1. Thou shalt include the ticket price information.
2. Thou shalt refrain from rambling about thy philosophical beliefs.
3. Thou shalt be punctual.  Tary not after the promised hour.
4. Thou shalt keep the music at the beginning to a minimum.
5. Thou shalt play music representative of the music played at the gathering.
6. Thou shalt keep the background music low enough for callers to hear thy 
message.
7. Thou shalt summarize the location before going into long-winded directions.
8. Thou shalt not insult the caller or overstate the lineup, lest bad karma 
accumulate against thee.
9. Thou shalt not record the message if thou hast an heavy accent; be not 
full of pride, but let thy non-accented brother or sister record the message.
10. Thou shalt not speak of PLUR on the phone message, only to hold a party 
that looketh like no more than a beer bust, lest thy fellow ravers strike 
thee for blasphemy.

No, this is also incorrect. Police have specific legal authority to do drugs
in undercover operations, if not doing so would blow their cover. This has
been documented many times, including a couple of movies where undercover cops
become addicts in the course of sting operations.

Please people, don't just spread rumors you heard about the law. Unless you
have specific knowledge and can back it up with sources and/or disclaimers,
this is dangerous advice that could land someone in jail. There are no
clear-cut lines you can give like "Cops can't do XXX or your case will be
thrown out of court." Previous posts have shown that there is always a special
case or circumstance that allows cops to skirt the law. Believe me, the laws
are stacked in their favor. If you haven't noticed, there has been this war on
drugs going on for a while now, and the courts seem to have no problem with
taking away individual freedoms in the interest of fighting drugs. The result
is frightening.

So, if you want to give advice, please give it in the form of anecdotal
evidence (like, "I/FOAF got busted for selling XXX and it was thrown out
because the cops screwed up and did YYY.") or some other kind of authoritative
support (magazine/newspaper/journal article, etc.) I don't want to seem like a
hard-ass, but people here are giving specific legal that they are not
qualified to give. I guess smart people will not act on any advice given in
such a non-legal forum, but I don't like people spreading rumors that might
land someone in jail.

Ummm... not that this is really easy, but citing sources on 
"by law cops have to..." statements is really helpful.

By stating inaccurate info on things like drug stings,
you could be costing someone a LOT if they trust what you post.

----------

>From what i have seen on TV and talking to folks into drugs,
and from recent posts on SFraves, i'd believe:

Undercover Cops have to tell you if they are a narc.

Undercover Cops can't do drugs themselves.

Undercover Cops can't have sex with people they are investigating.
(not mentioned on SFraves :)

>From reading around on the net for however many years,
i've come to believe:

Cops have to tell you they are a narc unless their lives are in danger.
(as Joe stated)
ANY situtation involving a drug deal is considered life threatening.
   .
  . .
If an undercover cop is trying to buy/sell drugs from you,
they don't have to tell you anything.

Also from reading accounts of drug busts and stories of undercover cops
who got addicted to drugs:

Cops can and do use drugs in the presence of people they are gathering evidence
on. 

(They aren't likely  to bust you if they are high/fucked up,
but if it's a sting operation, they'll catch you on videotape.)

On the sex thing, i still think that's true, but wouldn't
necesarily encourage people to abide by that becuase
it would probably just make you a very popular/unpopular dealer
if you slept with everyone you sold to.

---------------

Aside from actual laws...

A cop can do whatever she wants.  She can put you under arrest
and take all your drugs and do it all in a manner that isn't legal.

You lose your drugs and have to hire a lawyer.

The cop gets a slap on the wrist for a sloppy arrest,
and a pat on the back for taking some drugs off the street
but not crowding a jail already full of drug offenders.

11th & Folsom club named "V".  I may be there-too hot in my apartment!  Dress 
for heat, I can imagine if the dancefloor isn't extremely well cooled it'll be 
pretty hot.  I'm asian female 5'1" (don't plan what I'll wear).  Haven't been 
danccing in a long while, so I'll be on the dancefloor with my eyes closed-
groovin'.  Come say hi.  It'd be nice to put some faces to the e-mail addresses!

Jacqui

Could somebaody please post the address of the new location for MAD
tonight?  I want to bring a friend who's here from Egypt to check it out,
but I haven't been since it moved from the Bahia.  Thanks much.

 Oh god YES--I was waiting for a friend to go down to the water with and 
when I heard this song I picked my tired self up and ran up to the front
of the crowd and just went off. I was extremly happy that Galen played this 
song.
 That was the first time that I've heard a Dj bring any of Manifesto's 
songs into their set. After that I struggled back and collapsed:).

They have quite a few songs that still sound fresh - "Helter Skelter," "God
O.D.", "Psyche Out," their mix of MC900ft Jesus' "Killer Inside Me," even
"Now" works great in ambient sets. Plus almost all of Storm the Studio. I
think they're a much bigger influence on house and techno than they get
credit for. Jack Dangers lives in Mill Valley. Wonder if he ever makes it
out to parties...

an actual party! :):)  Just beeyootiful!

Yeah, I usually play one or two HIA songs - Colourform's one of my favorite
albums. Check their newer LP, Freefloater as well. A little less
accessible, but
also quite good.

[ to sfraves list ]

 Just to add a bit of paranoia to the present mix ... I've read that the
usual way narcs bust up a "drug ring" is to arrest some users , looking
for someone with a lot of dope in their possesion. Then , they pressure
that user into narcing for them. So - cops don't have to infiltrate 
someone into a scene , they pressure someone who's already a part of that
scene to inform on the dealers and , worst , their fellow users.

 Have a nice friday ( and have any of your friends been acting , well,
 ODD lately ????....????..??.. )

[more editing}

As I have stated before, every body is a different, chemical-based, 
biosystem. There is always the possibility that someone may have an 
allergic, or otherwise dissimilar, reaction to any chemical that is 
ingested. I'm not saying that is the case here or everytime that someone 
has a wierd reaction to a given substance, but it is one of the many 
possibilities. 

 The above reaction sounds like a reaction to a stimulate to me, but I'm 
no doctor (or pharmacist).

 I know that I need to take less E than most folks (about 100 milligrams) 
to have a great time  =). If I consume 125 milligrams (1/8 gram) or more 
than I start to have similar reactions described above. I usually 
describe it as a reverse of a good experience where I DO NOT love 
everyone and feel generally BAD. Just as a context, I used to get E when 
it was only $8 a dose. The good 'ol days =), before Raves had even hit 
the US of A

Hi!

The Devil went down to Frisco
He was lookin' for a soul to steal.
He was in a bind, he was way behind
and he was willing to make a deal,

When he came across this young man
circle dancing and playing it hot.
The devil jumped up on a 6 foot speaker,
said, "Boy, let me tell ya what!

"I guess you didn't know it
but I'm a circle dancer too,
and if you care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you.

Now you're a pretty good dancer
but give the Devil his due,
I bet a whistle of gold against your soul
cause I think I'm better 'n' you!"

The boy said, "My name's John S. Lee
and it might be a sin,
but I'll take yer bet and yer gonna regret
cause I'm the best that's ever been!"

John S. Lee you better stretch out
and dance with all your heart,
cause Hell's broke loose in Frisco
and the Devil's dealing hard.

If you win you get this shiny whistle made of gold,
but if you lose, the Devil gets your soul!

The devil whipped out his tennis shoes
and he said, "I'll start this show!"
And fire flew from his fingertips
as he tied the laces in a bow.

He slid across the floor
and those shoes made an evil hiss
The he danced and he twirled and he jumped
and everyone one in the crowd he dissed.

When the devil was finished, 
John S. Lee said, "Well you're pretty good old son,
but sit down and get a backrub from those pretty rave chicks
and let me show you how it's done!"

John danced like a man possessed
but suddenly he couldn't dance anymore.
In the middle of the circle someone built an altar 
and plopped their butts in the middle of the floor!

John S. Lee hung his head
because he knew that he'd been beat.
The devil picked him up and 
slung over his shoulder by his feet.

A gate to Hell opened.
As the Devil descended into the ground
he said, "If you kiddies ever want to try again
you know where I can be found!"

John S. Lee's still dancin';
he's dancin' day and night too,
but you can bet when someone sits in the floor now,
John comes kickin' through!

Is pornography degrading to women or sexually liberating for our society?

>From my perspective, what I think is important to understand is that being
disturbed by pornography does not mean a woman is anti-sex or repressed.
The disturbance for me comes from the fact that pornography, almost by
definition, OBJECTIFIES women.  It is a VISUAL medium, focusing on graphic
sex acts and body parts.  Narrative, thought, is largely absent.  This
seems to correspond to a more masculine sexuality, i.e. being turned-on
visually, bodies and acts arousing rather than minds and personalities.
For many women, this impersonal sexuality is inexplicable - and actually
threatening.  Unfortunately for all of us, male sexual response has
translated to a hierarchical social structure (i.e. sexism).

Women experience that objectification based on our bodies - the
dehumanization - every day of our lives.  When we walk down the street, we
are sexually harassed; a blatant power play emphasizing that men like to
impose their sexuality on us without any regard for our consent, simply
because we have female bodies.  The extreme emphasis on our looks
overshadows every aspect of our lives.   Feminism and the women's movement
is our struggle to be evaluated and advance on our merits and talents, to
escape that objectification so that we can actually be acknowledged as
equal human beings.  I strongly suspect that the objectifying male
sexuality is a subconscious basis for the unequal status of women in our
culture.

*Not that there's anything inherently wrong with male sexuality - men are
how they are, getting turned on by seeing breasts is not evil.   However,
the problem arises when that concept of women extends beyond actual sex to
encompass how we are viewed in our entirety.

Also, mainstream porn (made almost exclusively for men) is damaging in that
it is NOT A REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF FEMALE SEXUALITY.  The women are
portrayed as having the exact same sexual response as men.  i.e. there is
no foreplay required, a woman is ready to go at a moment's notice, she is
willing to have sex with anyone in the room without having to have any sort
of relationship with them, and she has uncontrollable orgasms from
intercourse.  As this is, for most women, the diametric opposite of our
actual sexuality, this portrayal discourages paying attention to women's
actual needs.  In that way it is a sexist institution that continues the
dehumanization of women (i.e., does not respect or acknowledge our
different needs from men).  Set that against a backdrop of society
discouraging women to be sexually assertive, and you have tons and tons of
women who cannot communicate just what they really need from a lover.

As for women in porn and prostitution, many claim personal liberation in
the experience.  I think we have to listen to individuals and not pass our
own judgements on their choices.  It is important to realize, however, that
many women in these professions are exploited: someone (a pimp, a producer)
gets most of her earnings, many women are drug-addicted, and many have been
raped or abused.  There ARE, however, healthy people who choose sex work
based on their own morals.  I have known a couple of women who have my
utmost respect as it is their own thoughtful, intelligent, informed
decision (they are students, in business on the side with their own steady
clients - different situation from most street-walkers).

Sex work IN ITSELF does not seem, to me, inherently terrible.  Human beings
need sex, it's pleasure.  So why not contract with someone for the service?
It's just touching, it's being LOVING to someone to give them pleasure.
Pornography is filming people having sex.  The problem seems to lie not in
the fact of sex work, but in its MISUSE - exploited streetwalkers, sexist
portrayals of women.  It is telling that our society feels that any sex
work is disgusting - the only way we can conceive of it is as something
sick, perverted and abusive.  People enjoying pleasure and being kind to
each other without exploitation does not seem to be possible within that
societal mind-set.   Sex work in a culture with a different view of
sexuality would look, I think, entirely different!

Hopefully as a society we can move beyond our current model of sex as a) a
display of dehumanized women for the man, and b) nasty and degrading to
women.  This whole concept of what sex is evidences, to me, the sickness of
our society.  Hopefully we can move toward a healthy, loving, equitable
sexuality - and hopefully the mindset that will birth it is what we are
creating in rave.  (This was my exact topic in a previous post and I caught
a lot of flames for being "offensive"! ).

Change starts with the individual.  For myself, I have thrown away
societal's pressure on my sexuality and proudly claim MY real desires - a
loving relationship, my own pleasure (foreplay), respect and consensuality,
and absolute enjoyment of sex.  I will support erotica and writings and
photography from women - a sexuality that is beautiful, arousing, and
equitable.  I refuse to believe that being disturbed by current pornography
means we cannot be sexually liberated.   Instead, perhaps it means an
entirely new concept of sexuality.

Awaiting angry flames,
Nancy

Nancy,

  I like your overall viewpoint .... but sadly while many people agree
with you - their METHOD for improvement seems to be to create a new form
of puritanism... sort of like dieters or alcoholics - if food or whatever
is being abused just avoid and deny it.... This path leads us into a
spiral of sexual denial which all too often is the path we are lead down...

  So the way we use, express and control our sexualities as a society is 
pathetic at best. I am also still shocked at the double standard - that
a woman who enjoys and/or engages in open and frequent sex acts is "tainted"
which was implied about T. Lords ( if not actually said ). Apparently
the idea that sex is dirty.... and the "will you respect me if I do IT with
you?" question still has a healthy life in our society. Women who become
sex objects of our society all too often end up not only exploited through
objectivication but also end up wearing a modern scarlet letter of 
disapproval.

  On the other hand, many people who express their sexuality publicly such
as Madonna do very little for me at least.... I don't find her sexuality
particurly liberating or respect oriented (IMO of course). I don't think
of her as bad but merely representing a sexuality that lacks real 
romantic sentiment, respect or deep person to person contact. So from male
pronographers to female sex mistresses we too often lack good models for a
healthy sexuality ... and let's not even begin to talk about religious or
at least christian training regrading sex.....


  What we need is a really great tantric master on Channel 50.... ;-)

 Mike

Warning: kinda long...

After a rather bad week, I needed to do some dancing.  Our plans of keeping 
the night a sedate one were changed when our non-rave visitor from Kansas 
decided she didn't have the energy to bop, and suddenly it became a RAVE 
NIGHT.  So all the little kiddies skipped off into the night in search of 
adventure...

I was overruled on the beach party.  As much as I've always wanted to go to 
a rave on the beach overlooking the ocean at night, it still hasn't 
happened.  <heavy sigh>  No, the draw last night was Doc Martin, so the 
target of our mission was ... Fusion!

This was held at the Jerrold St. deli <quiet grumbling>.  The music was 
*very* good, the lighting was ok, the acid visuals were good, and ... drum 
roll ... the A/C was working!  :)  Ok, I figured I ought to say that since 
that was the major gripe going around after one party a while back...  ;)  
It still gets pretty toasty upstairs, but heat rises, and with 700+ bodies 
(my estimate), you have to expect that.  Also, a new twist in decoration, 
there were these beach blowup toys, (a few beach balls, a shark raft, a 
hippo raft) and they were spray painted in DayGlo colors and hung across the 
dance area right where the black lights would hit them.  Very nice effect, I 
thought, a la DV8 and the dolphin room with a psychadelic touch.  There was 
some fun artwork upstairs where they were selling smart drinks and fruit -- 
always a welcome addition.

Prior to Doc coming out the black lights were turned off.  :(  I like black 
lights, but I guess it was just a little bright in there for someone.  
Still, by that time, I was so into dancing and boogying, the strobes and 
acid visuals were just fine.

Cool moment: some guy was going around selling glo sticks, so a lot of 
people were playing with them.  Since they were on strings, some folks would 
just spin them in circles over their head or whatever.  I was looking up and 
tripping on the guys overhead that had two glo sticks in one hand, red and 
green, and spining them in a circle.  Faster, slower, depending on the 
music.  The effect was weird...

Cool moment: I chatted with a pixie!  Ya gotta give it to people who come to 
a party with a gimmick.  There was a girl in a fairy outfit, complete with 
wings and sparkles on her face, informing people that she was a pixie.  
There was also a guy there with the cat-in-the-hat hat and the four fingered 
cartoon gloves.  I love that get-up -- I should get one for myself...

Cool moment: By coming to Fusion, I got a chance to talk to Stacey in person 
and get things straightened out regarding the stupid rumors going around and 
the negativity online the other day.  She was very sweet about it -- no 
karate chops or kicks to the kneecaps. 8)   So let's set the record 
straight: Tom and Stacey did NOT get the original space for "All in the 
Family" busted.  They throw parties.  'nuff said.  And Tom and Stacey are 
NOT narcs, like that should need saying.   Although she did share with me 
that they are in fact aliens who are intent on stealing all the pop rocks in 
the world -- seems pop rocks are beyond their technology...  (oh no! another 
rumor!)

The Vibe: It was ok.  I think there's just a certain vibe at events like 
Sunset or Chrysalis that are tough to come by.  I had a good time, but there 
wasn't a group energy that I could detect.  I came across some ravers with 
toys and candy and we hung for a bit, but even they didn't really seem into 
it.  It was just a good night to dance...

Unfortunately my crew pooped out before Doc came on, and we left about 5 
minutes before he was supposed to start.  :(

Bad moment:  Can I gripe about how the deli is run?  This has nothing to do 
with how the party itself was produced.  I got a clear cut example of 
immediate inflation last night when I bought one orange for $.40 and then 
five minutes later tried to buy another one and was told it was $.75.  Not 
that $.75 is going to break me anytime soon, but I was offended.  This is 
the treatment I have come to expect.  Look, there's a guy that works behind 
the counter with a moustache.  He's cool, he doesn't size you up and try to 
figure out how much he can take you for.  He charges you a fair price.  
Shoot, I bet he'd be cool to party with, even.  There's a woman behind the 
counter, and she's Satan in drag, the Anti-Raver.  She'll jack the price up 
on you in a heartbeat.  She tries to stick it to me everytime I walk up to 
the counter.  She'd probably try to charge you for a napkin...  And of 
course, water is $3 (probably more if Satan-woman is selling them) with no 
refills allowed -- at least in the guys restroom.  Fortunately there's 
usually a lady in the group I go with, so we're covered, but it's a hassle 
just the same.

I just realized this morning that in about 6 weeks I will be leaving 
Northern California and returning (at least for a little while) to my old 
stomping ground behind the Orange Curtain in southern California.  I was 
wondering if anyone could give me info on good rekkid stores in the 
Orange County area.  I would be looking for the usual stuff:  progressive 
house, electro, some drum&bass etc.  Anyway, thanks!

Hey all!

Ok, I'm finally intrigued enough to find out how to do it.  So how 
exactly do those "signatures" work?  Is that something your ISP should 
provide you, or is it a separate program you have to obtain?  Can 
somebody help me figure this out?  Thanks!  :)


Love,
Shawna

Hi everybody- my name's John, and I wanted to (re)introduce myself,
having just (re)subscribed to sfraves...  I'm moving to the South Bay
from Vail, Colorado, where I was on mtn-raves, which is a very 
beautiful community of people!  (I will miss dancing with them!!!!!)

I'm really excited to be living in the bay area, and psyched to reconnect
with the sharp minds and warm hearts of this area's community...  I've 
been on the WELL since 1991 or something-- and plan to be there forever.
I was on this list before-- in 1994 while traveling with some infamous
(and slightly mis-judged) UK rave promoters and performers called the 
"zippy pronoia tour"...   (yeah yeah, I know I know).  We threw a few good
parties in the Bay region, in conjunction with the awesome SPAZ crew,
most notably the "Jupiter Bash" in downtown SF the night that comet
smashed into the planet Jupiter.   

Anyway, I've been meditating up in the Rockies, snowboarding and weaving
websites for the company I'm a producer for-- Eagle River Interactive.
We've just opened a Mountain View office, and so I jumped at the chance
to come out here.  I hope to move into the City by the end of the summer
and commute via Caltrain.

Looking forward to meeting lots of you, and groovin at some of those
famous beach parties this summer!!!

PeaceLoveUnityRespect
John

one bottle of water included with entry fee:  very cool

wasn't very crowded, which is good, but it took a toll on the vibe 
factor.  I got my dancing in but I can't say I got my hootin' and 
hollerin' in.

alittle bit sticky but nothing unbearable.

since the building is basically a long hallway, lots of traffic causes 
disruption to dancers, however last night it was not so pushy, just alot 
of weaving.

concistent beats.  I suppose that would be house in the main room.  
alittle bit more techno-y in the basement but still housey speeds.  I did 
catch a break in there and that was a joyous but brief moment indeed.

can't wait to do the Wickedslip(tm) next week...

Mr. Kirk?

Yes?

Do you have a son named Robin, Robin Kirk, age 17?

Yes.

I'm sorry Mr. Kirk.  You'd better come down to the station house.  Your 
son is dead.

Dead? H..h...how?

He died of an overdose.

I am dileariously excited and a little nervous as my impending moonpup uk
tour begins....(no dates thus far.....and counting) 
 
I just wanted to thank those of you who have contributed to the discusions
and debates during my first 4 months on the net........you have helped give
me a crash course in mac internet 101........ 
 
I have learned a lot about comunication (both good and bad) and you have
all helped me to move into the 21st century. I will miss having my computer
so readily available, but after I arrive in the uk, I will get set up with
some kind of ability to post from the uk so look for me soon..... 
 
......meanwhile, I would like you to welcome the person who has helped me
to make this trip possible by sub-renting my house. His name is Eric D and
I met him through SFRaves. (he is from DCRaves, and has posted on SFR) he
is going to move here, and he will use my pad to transition himself to S.F.
 
 
please help to give him a warm SF welcome, and show him why we are
considered such a progressive and friendly place. 
 
As I will not be un-subscribing to SFR, Eric will be posting on my
computer, starting after wednesday (may 1st)........until my return.... 
 
while I am gone, (until approx burning man time) my phone # and e-mail
address will stay connected, and so you can still leave me messages, and
Eric will help relay info to me........... 
 
I hope you all have a delicious summer, and I look forward to seeing some
of you at burning man later this year........moonpup     I will not leave
till Tuesday at 3pm if you need to contact me.........moonpup

"Paranoia strikes deep, into you life it will creep"

Another thought...
Sorry to say that a lot of younger than I ravers think that because 
someone is in their mid thirties or forties that they are a narc.
 
I remember a Sunset a while back where a male friend of mine age 44 was 
actually asked, "Are you a narc?" He just laughed.

People need to become more observant and much greater readers of 'energy'.
I don't care how polished in a role a cop or rat might be, they can't hide 
their hearts.

Also, many folks need to be a  
bit less judgemental...I just have to talk about this here even 
though I know non of you have made such acusations.  Anyway, I recommend 
that these folks take an hour to observe the aledged narc and see who 
they are hugging at the party, or perhaps who they share their heart pipes 
with.  

Now on a possibly really paranoid side, I did see two folks this evening 
who radiated a narc-like vibe.  What I thought I was reading was a spying 
energy...Believe me there are organizations within the walls of right 
wing fascist Christian churches who do in fact gather the sinful facts & 
information (pagans, drugs, sex, indescent clothing) which is used during 
sermons against us (remember these people have increasingly enormous 
clout as voters).  Perhaps it was parents spying on their sons and daughters 
who just don't like their kids being there.  E.g. my dad once spied on me 
from the Hermosa Beach Pier when I was 12 having just a little too much 
fun on the beach--grounded for two weeks)  Anyway, I bear a watchful eye 
all the time, as a warrior a macumazon (he who sleeps with one eye open)  
as a guardian watching for anything potentially 
harmful to our House.    

And to end on a positive note....  I arrived after 6 tonight and when 
Galen went on, it was simply amazing, one of the Bay areas's best Dj's 
IMHO... Anyone taping  tonight?  Man I would love a tape of his set...

If interested, at the next Sunset, you can find me... I always wear a big 
straw hat with lots of weird and interesting shit hot glued to the brim...  
until sunset..

Lastly, often folks ask for good energy sent their way...my mom (age 67) 
is visiting this Saturday for a week.  From the deepest place in my heart 
I want to share my 'church' so to speak with her..  take her to a day 
small party.  I humbly ask for the energy of patience be sent my 
way..good thoughts, so that I can give this to  her in a gentle beauty way.

Thanks and always peace...

Maureen

[ to sfraves list ]

 It's good to see some more folks interested in doing events within 
"striking distance" of San Jose! As a Sunnyvale resident, I'd be interested
in what you folks develop. 

 Also , for "nuts-and-bolts" discussions of event logistics , who's 
doing what, etc. , you could try using the dormant 

 sfraves-planners@hyperreal.com 

 mailist. I think the way to subscribe to that list is the same procedure
you used to subscribe to sfraves ( send a message to majordomo@hyperreal.com ).

 I forget whether you have to put "subscribe sfraves-planners" in the
subject line or the body of the message - probably doing both can't hurt!

 Well , I just tried sending something to sfraves-planners@hyperreal.com,
but I haven't gotten anything back yet. Maybe it's no longer working.

Whoa weirdness!


Is it just me, or is everybody else getting messages today that they've 
already received in the past three-four days?  Like the one from the 
Amebas thanking us for coming to Packa-Bowl *last night*?  (???)  Every 
single of the 20 messages I pulled up are ones I've already read & 
deleted from Friday on.  Hmm.

Is it just my server or is something the matter with hyperreal.com again? I
just got about 20 messages that sound VERY familiar... golden oldies? feh.

Maybe we should include the time & date in the body of our messages, if
they're "I need a ride" or other time-specific messages... so people don't
get confused, y'know?

I've been asked to give Crunchman a ride two or three times today, and
about 10 times over the past half-week.

Okay, all my fellow raver-types, from my messages over the past few days I'm
sure you are all well aware that I have a large project due on Thursday that
still needs tons o' work.  Since I didn't have any takers on my billion
dollar offer to finish it for me, I'm going to be here working on it for
most of the night.  If anyone gets bored and just wants to say howdy, you
can either drop me a line at reicja00@usfca.edu, or call me at (415)
666-6062.  I'm sure it would make the time go by a lot faster.

Wish I were in the Bahamas instead,
Jake

P.S. My day was significantly improved, though, by the fact that I found out
about a Slowdive 7" I don't have. YAY!!!

Subject: Gateway/Portland
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Portland has always had such great *potential*.  Portland has always seemed
to get some momentum going and then . . . just not get going.  

I think the Gateway party Saturday night finally achieved the potential
for a really great event in Portland.  I'm kicking myself a bit because
it was my friends from San Francisco who put it on, and for a variety
of reasons, none of them very good (like "being busy" and so forth)
I didn't help out with this one.  

They did just fine without me, though!

The Modish Building, 333 Park Ave, has a long and complicated history in
the local scene.  The only real "rave club" we ever had in town was there
in the early 1990s (other places had "rave" nights but generally were
normal club spaces at other times).  The upper floors of the Modish have
gradually been taken over since then by a variety of organizations, 
musicians, bands and whatnot, so the building has gradually evolved into
a sort of alterna-cultural center.  Meanwhile, the ground floor has gone
through several ownership changes and is now a pretty nice live music club
but catering more to a professional audience.  

There have been lots of events at the Modish, but none that ever came close
to jelling like Gateway did.  It's kind of hard to describe the scene here,
everyone says "young" but young is not a problem, inwardly-withdrawn-
insecure-unsocial *is* a problem.  About halfway through the night
I recognized I was actually having a really good time and didn't feel the
emotional drain I usually get from being at Portland events.  Not to
overdraw this or anything, because there have been some good events here,
but it always seems like a struggle to keep the vibe flowing.

All the logistical aspects were totally covered -- awesome, I mean *awesome*
lights and sound, by far the best sound I've heard in Portland, even
eclipsing the excellent job that Jeff from Platinum did last week for the
4-20 event DRC spun at.  Excellent use of serious lights and lasers in
a small space.  It was great to go up on the balcony and watch the show
from above -- just like my best moments at 1015 . . . The DJs, well what
can I say, all excellent.  I only regret I had to leave before Monty
played in order to catch some sleep before my Seattle trip (business
business business!).  

And the crowd?  Well, sure there were about 30 SF and net-ravers there,
but for the large part it was the same locals who usually go and are part
of the same downcast crowd, but there was enough production, good music
and good feeling from the Gateway crew and Manoj and the Modish folks
that it completely changed the atmosphere.  

A really big win for Gateway, for Portland and for the Modish crew,
especially Manoj, who've put a lot into making things happen there.
Having an event like this one was, I think, an eye-opener for everyone.
I sure hope so.

I was asking my friend Phil where he would put the party on a scale of
Portland parties, and I put my hands out about a foot apart to give
him a 1-to-10 type scale.  So he started at 10 and his hand went up
and up and up . . .

Right around the time the party started, I was around the corner at
Umbra Penumbra, a coffeehouse, which has live ambient/electronic events
every couple of weeks.  My friend David ("Mr. Pharmacist") did one of
the performances, playing live analogue stuff (101s and the like) as
a backdrop to a couple of animated films.  Sort of like the theater
organist for silent movies, except for the 1990s instead of the 1920s.

Now if we could put together an event that combined that kind of live
stuff with house/techno and the ambient and the sophisticated funk from
the ground floor of the Modish . . . yow!!

Anyway, thanks so much to all of the Gateway crew for coming up here and
making it happen.  I just wish I'd been able to spend more time with y'all.

c u in the future!

Hey Randy, I'm not sure your there now, but I'm up rendering at home for my
senior project. What platform are you working on? What is your animation
about (I'm assuming its an animation). The following are picts from my
senior animation. They're B-17s I've been modeling that fit into one of the
four scenes I'm creating. I'm interested to see what your up to...

Thanks for the delightful review...
Except for the dorm, co-ed and campus references, sounds like a Burning 
Man review...wow  

Ya know, if you felt compelled to be blue and nekid, it could be 
way cool to have a bunch of ravers painted blue, among other things, 
inviting everyone at Main camp and other camps (they are estimating 
10,000 people this year) to check out rave camp.  My understanding last 
year, as was discussed some months ago here, is that many ravers never 
actually participated in the other camps.  For many of us, our goal is 
to contribute even more to the festival...

More on this later.  Are there any artists on this list who 
will be going to BM?  I will post this again.  Please send private email 
regarding same.  Thanks!  :)  --Mau

This message is to all the fellow ravers who experienced the blissful
state of oblivion that i was at on friday night at the f-8 party. It was
the closest that i ever came to experiencing the homo-gestalt feeling.
After experiencing huge events like Lucky Charms, Gaia etc. I was
delighted to find that there was such a feeling of community flowing
through the crowd ( if i can call it a crowd) on the beach. I was glad
that I didn't stay at home and go to bed like I had originally planned
to. Me and two friends of mine go there about 11:30 and were amazed at
the intimacy that the venue provided. The people at the entrance told us
that the event cost $6 but that we could pay whatever we wanted. When I
attempted to give them $7 I was given a dollar back and told that there
was no reason to pay more than $6. I knew this was the start of a good
night. The trek down did not even begin to prepare us for the unexpected
sight of a cul-de-sac so perfect that it might have been designed for
that night. I was pleased with the people tha I met and their overall
attitude. Like I told this very nice lady, that I met, seeing this
turnout gave me hope for the future of or society, sentimental as that
may sound. After the sun had been up for some time, we helped the Dj
carry his equipment back to civilization. All in all, it was one of the
more spiritual experiences that I've had in the last couple of months.

>> Is pornography degrading to women or sexually liberating for our society?
>>
>> >From my perspective, what I think is important to understand is that being
>> disturbed by pornography does not mean a woman is anti-sex or repressed.

Certainly not.  But when you hear someone call a person who does pron,
dirty or slutty, I think it is very clear the puritanical if not
self-righteous tone of such phrases.  Who's objectifying who now?
I think it all depends on the person.  Obviously there are people here who
feel that sex is still a very strange and alien thing.

I am disturbed by many things I see portryed in film.  especially the
respresentation of black people.  I however refrain from saying that the
people hwo do land roles are "uncle tom's", etc.  Or that there is some
type of Jewish conspiracy (ala Brando & others), guiding this whole thing.
We see what we want to see sometimes.


>> The disturbance for me comes from the fact that pornography, almost by
>> definition, OBJECTIFIES women.  It is a VISUAL medium, focusing on graphic
>> sex acts and body parts.

All movies ever made are of the visual medium.  Sound was added much later.
"Regular" movies focus on body parts as well; faces, eyes, arms, gestures.
There really is no difference.  The focus of porn is sex/entertainment.
The focus of mainstream movies is personalities/entertainment.  The real
argument here is about sex, and somehow porn , because it is sex based,
having greater impact on the society at large.  Unfortuantly all studies
are very mixed and haphazard.  There are plenty of philosophical arguments
for and against porn.  But like everything else, there is no conclusive
evidence to say whether the people who watch porn are affected.  We *do*
know people who do not appreciate porn are affected though.

The only fact is that porn is porn.  All movies objectify something, and
most woemn in movies are usually whores or helpless victims.  And people
call it mainstream because of the narrative?  Whatever, it's all the same
stuff to me.

>> Narrative, thought, is largely absent.

Looking at the current crop of movies (mainstream) of late, I think this is
true of most films made.  Mainstream and porn.  And WHO decided that a real
or good movie needs narration.  Some of the most powerful movies made were
silent films (See Dr. Caligari).  I go to movies to be entertained.  I f I
learn something, bonus round.  But the main reason is entertainment.
Mainstream movies, as lilly-white as it might be, along with porn , as
lilly-white as *it* can be, both entertain.

The rest, whether porn is less becuase of it's focus, is all a matter of
opinion.

To me, it is no more or less than anything else out there.


>> This
>> seems to correspond to a more masculine sexuality, i.e. being turned-on
>> visually, bodies and acts arousing rather than minds and personalities.

Not a porn afficionado huh?  There are plenty of female producers now.
Porn encompases many different genres, from the raunch to the romantic.
There is a whole line of erotica (read pron), put out by Candida Royale,
ex-porn star (you should see her in "Hot Rackets"), and she is trying to
cater to women.  There are other female producers.  These ladies focus less
on the act than on the interaction.  There are vidoes where people don't
even have sex (see some of the wierd tantric stuff...) per se.  Anyway
there are many different genres of porn.  You are grouping all of porn into
one neat box so you can argue against it.  By not being aware of the
variety, all you are doing is making a gross generalization.

Generalizing is a very narrow path to being wrong.


>> For many women, this impersonal sexuality is inexplicable - and actually
>> threatening.

And for many women it is not threatening, but liberating.  LArger and
larger numbers of women are making thier own porn movies now. Whtere it be
professional or amatuer, women are in it.  Please try not to speak for all
your sisters.  Many would disagree with you from jump.

This whole conversation sounds like one of those "Feminists Against Porn"
arguments I've heard over and over.  The end result?  The lefties of F.A.P,
join right up with the far right X-Tain Coalition and others, to stop the
common disease of objectification and sexually oriented movies.

Yikes!!! It's 1984 all over again! ;)


>> Unfortunately for all of us, male sexual response has
>> translated to a hierarchical social structure (i.e. sexism).

I see, and what of the female sexual response?

At this point, it seems like nothing more than an anti-porn, anti-male
response.  Ther rest of the analysis does not examine why women go into
porn, or even why many women enjoy it as much as men.  And it doesn't
answer the question as to why the industry, from all accounts, is growing
in acceptance for the most part.

I dunno, puritanism is far from dead.  I just wish people would leave each
other alone, and respect each other, instead of casting judgement after
judgement against each other for all kinds of weird resons.

Movies, all movies, are entertainment.  Some are even informative (porn is
no different).  If you don;t like it, don't watch it.  But before passing
judgment, I would suggest spending some time researching the subject.

Out,
John

P.S.  The Pilgrims have landed on SFR.  And they are as right as ever.

Anytime you think you are going to be narced siimply go up to the person 
who you think is going to narc you and say to him, "if your going 
to narc me narc me but for fucks sake get on with it if you are."  This 
instantly has the effect of a) shocking the guy because you recognized 
him in the first place and b) if he really is a narc he has to tell you 
there and then; if he doesn't that's entrapment and, while he may still 
get your stash, the case will be thrown out of court.
More star ideas from your friends at united way.

yup, it's all true :)  i want to thank all the gateway people for helping
us kick off a new era in Portland.  loving Portland as much as i do, *my*
community, we have alot of work to do here and alot of love to
spread...and knowing how to throw a good party with such a positive intent
is a great begining.  i feel that for those of us who live here, staying
centered and loving and holding each other up and helping each other learn
is equally important...and being ready to pick each other up when we fall.
this was a very new and fresh experience for our community...a catalyst
for change...a night to remember, and model as we create our future and
draw out the highest aspects of ourselves individually and collectively.

so, again, specifically, i want to thank all our new and old friends...i
LOVE you wayne and marcy and i'm sooo happy i had the best of both of my
families together!  ican't remember everyone's name i met...the dj's
were all delightful to meet...of course, much of the time spent by the
gateway people was taking care of the production.  monty?  hard
house...thanks for letting me massage your crown :)  thanks for the extra
special happy vibe from the woman with the short red hair (name???) ethan,
thanks for the hug on the dance floor, you have great energy, and clair
and everyone who decorated...you guys know how to create ambience :)

so now you guys know why i come to SF so often!  but, also why we're
working towards things here.  i know i speak for everyone at Ahau when i
say thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

peace out,

bren, aka, shakti
the Ahau collective

OOps - my review of All in the Family this past weekend was obviously
supposed to be for All Together Now.

they were AMAZING!!! it was such a great fusion of the paganistic ritual
meets the cyber space future.  perfect combination.  their ethereal blue
body paint and sprite-like movements completely enchanted me.  i've never
seen them before...but i would love to in the near future if anyone knows
where they will be performing!  

without a doubt, the fire-eaters spawned on this intense energy with the
crowd.  after their various dances, did you all notice the heightened
vibes that were coming out from everyone dancing?!? 

i had a great time that night playing with firefly finger toys, lights,
prisms and all the fun-loving huggy souls i met...:)

i didn't stop dancing but for water and bathroom breaks! 6 hours straight.
it was a total physical catharsis.

If we get enough advance notice of the end of the world, someone should
throw and End of the World Party!  It could be a synchronized event
occurring in every major raving city in the world.  Would they be massives
or undergrounds?  Would we want whistles?  Drums?  Clapping?  Live music of
any kind?  How about the music?  Techno?  House?  Trance?  Trip-hop?  What
would make the best end of the world party?  It would definitely have to
last longer than any party has in history; maybe it could incorporate
everything that everyone likes the most.  The spaces would have to be
fairly large, cool, and unusual.  Anyone want to start a planning
committee?

Peace in the end times,

why don't we just start a party NOW, then wait 'n see when the Big Event
happens? if we're lucky, we should have a few years run before anything
happens....

Hey everybody-
	(sorry for the cross posting BUT this is the bes and only way to 
get the question out to all the lists that I know of!!)
	Everyone has been doing a super job helping us and we appreciate 
it so much!!! And as we get responses to our questions, our numbers go 
down by the hundreds BUT as you all know new parties are always happening 
so our number goes up very quickly again...SOOO..I know that a lot of 
people are cramming for finals (Good luck!) but this should be the last 
question for awhile (at least from me since my budget is technologically 
behind the times and I don't have net access...but Matt does) so please 
if you know where are any of these dj's are from (city and state) we'd 
really appreciate...the dj number is up to the 1400's now, so anybody 
that doesn't see dj names that were on here before don'y worry that means 
we just have the city now thanks to you guys!!!
	Again Thank you so much and good luck to those of you with finals!!!
Love -
Nicole

MAD got off to a nice mellow start, most likely due to the quality of the
weekend here at home and abroad.  I figure one can tell just how good the
weekend was by the size/energy of an early-in-the-week party.

V is an intesting club, and *could* be a great place for a weekly, or even
a larger event, but there are enough limitations to it that I don't know if
it will ever become a choice venue.  The 21+ rule is a major issue for the
guys doing MAD and it's to their credit that they want this party to be
accessible to more people.  The security is pretty hard-ass as well, and
the cheapest beer one can score is like $3.75.

It's a nice looking place however, with several side rooms with black
lights and trippy carpeting, and a nice big roof deck which was great last
night in the unsually warm SF weather.

Jon Santos got things rolling with his creative, fast paced, eclectic
flare.  Joe Rice came on next and kept things moving along nicely, working
the mixer in a unique esoteric style; flipping switches this way and that
to create some cool effects.  By this time the majority of about a 100 or
so people were either dancing or watching people dance (others were milling
about, or on the roof, or playing pool).

Around 12:30 Freaky Chakra and Single Cell Orchestra came on and brough the
pace down to a very slow, whoomping, swaying sort of start.  They
gradually, slowly, teasingly picked up the pace, and as I left, the dance
floor was almost entirely full of swaying, swinging, gyrating hips and arms
and smiles.  I got to my motorcycle parked just outside the door where the
DJ was set up and the pace in a span of about five minutes had picked up to
a very dancable level.  I could only smile and think of the people inside
flailing and bouncing and rocking out to the live performance.

I couldn't help but smile on the way home. :^)

Peace!

Tone

P.S.  Thanks to MAD!!

Out of curiosity, where is all the compiled info available?

I am *REALLY* suspicious whenever someone cross-posts like this, I just 
fought the urge to air my first impression, and now I find out I was 
right. *sigh* 

<sarcasm mode on> Gee, it's so nice to have people being tricked into giving 
these people info, talking like they are your friends,  just so they can make a 
buck. I bet they "appreciate" the help... how sleazy....

Hang on a sec...what if it's worth it?  What if it's a good thing?  I
understand where you're coming from, but don't condemn it before you see
the product.

I'm not defending it, I'm just saying that it could be a good way for DJs
and promoters to find one another, and those CDs ain't free.  Not to
mention time, and other expenses.

I could be wrong, I guess...

:^)
Tone

P.S.  Maybe someone could offer details about cost, content, etc?  (Or did
I miss that post.)

Well here's a brief guide to *Koh Phangan*.

1. Take a plane to *Bangkok*, the capitol of *Thailand*. That's near
Vietnam and India.

2. Next take a bus to *Haadyai*, but that's not where u take the boat.
The boat has to be taken from *Surathani* so if u can get a bus or
train from *Bangkok* to Surathani* go for it.

3. If u have made it this far, It's almost over. Take the ferry to *Koh
Phangan*. The journey takes about 5 hours so pack a bowl and relax.

4. Upon landing on Koh Phangan, u need to catch a ride to Haad-rin
Beach across the island.

5. If u made it, go to the beach, take off your shoes and give everyone
around u a hug. Next find somewhere to stay.

here's the address of The original full moon party place

Paradise Bungalow
Haadrin Beach
Koh Phangan
Suratthani 84280
Thailand
tel: (66) 1-725-0661

The journey is half the fun, oh boy will u have some trippy stories to
tell after that.

The Party never stops on Koh Phangan and one can live off fresh air the
sun, ocean, crstal clear ocean,calm waters, beautiful people, no
police,love, positive vibes, goa trance and this could go on foever.


Love 
Ben aka ionX

PS I will be down there this summer hope to see some of u there.
Or if interested buzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

PPS: Great job by F-8 last friday, I felt true bliss once again.

What bothers us is that they never said it was for a CD-ROM.  Most of us
assumed it would be for a free database like Hyperreal.  It would have
been different if they would have stated outright "We are trying to
produce a scene-positive CD-ROM"... and even "We will offer the CD-ROM
at a special discount for all net-ravers, as a thanks for helping us
compile this information."  It could be a great CD-ROM, but I guess 
net.ravers are used to people doing things in a commmunal sort of way,
in the spirit of hyperreal.com

Anyone who books DJs knows that a list on CD-ROM is a joke because it'll 
be outdated so fast...

 i don't have the number on me right now, but if you call (415) 723-2300, that 
will patch you directly through to the stanford university operator.  i don't 
know who has control of the mansion, either the music department or the 
computer music lab, but i took a class in their once and it's an interesting 
place.  still has alot of earthquake damage that hasn't been repaired:(  
 it's worth giving someone a call to find out more info.

I NEVER said that.  I don't believe in "dirty" or "slutty."  Sex is
beautiful, it is pleasure.

Yes, I was thinking this as I wrote it.  But what I was trying to get
across was a sexuality based on visualness which then
objectifies/fetishizes women's bodies, which has serious ramifications for
women's struggle for equal rights and respect in the whole of society.

Yes, I've studied this, too.  I refrained from stating that porn actually
causes violence against women.  I know men who enjoy porn and strip clubs
who are absolutely respectful - they just enjoy seeing sex acts and naked
women, but don't take that to their entire relations with women.  Porn as
actually dangerous depends on the individual watching it, but I still think
we should be cognizant of its messages (like what women respond to
sexually, because it is very misleading in most cases).

Yeah, most Hollywood creations are fluff.  What I meant was that there was
no character development, emphasizing a sexuality based on bodies only,
which is primarily a male sexuality.  (By "male sexuality" I mean what's
accepted in the mainstream, I know many men whose sexuality is much more
complex and subtle than society allows them).  Bodies-only sexuality means
individual personalities don't count, turning the women into
interchangeable objects (the men are positioned as the actors, and the
consumers).

Perhaps you didn't read my entire message, which concluded that an
alternate view of sexuality is found in women's erotica, etc.  I should
have also mentioned gay & lesbian porn.  When people talk of "porn," they
usually are referring to the male-oriented pornography.  Women's writings,
films, etc., have flourished in the last ten years - a self-liberation of
claiming our own sexuality and our right to be aroused.

I would appreciate it if you would pay attention to the entire argument
rather than misinterpreting things so that you can be offended.  You could
easily be accused of generalizing (something you'll probably take offense
to, even though you quickly accused me of the same!).

I am very hesitant to even respond because I have seen you absolutely tear
apart people, for no other reason than something (sometimes seemingly
inocuous) riled you.  I know that to even answer your post will mean a
heated response.  I think you have some VERY interesting and important
insights, but I am also disturbed by the ferocity of your tone.  I wonder
where the respect is.  I find it ironic that in the name of justice, you
feel justified in belittling and abusing people, and twisting their words.
Puritanism?  How did you get THAT out of a feminist critique of mainstream
porn? (NOT necessarily anti-porn!).  Don't you see any common ground
between feminism and civil rights/the position of black folk?  Or are you
too blinded by watching "betties shaking it" (at a RAVE, where women hope
for respect) and calling porn's portrayal of women "entertainment" ?  Why
is YOUR concept of injustice the only one that matters?  And why does it
only encompass capitalism (I agree with you) and racism (I agree with you),
but not sexism?

John, I read your posts with interest.  You have an incisive wit, and an
analysis of society that is needed.  But often these ideas are couched in
anger and disrespect.  I feel you contradict yourself by being for social
justice while viciously tearing into somebody/some position you have
invented for them.

Yes, but the sexuality is envisioned differently, right?  THAT's what I'm
referring to!!!  One way to equality is acknowledging women's own
sexuality.

I qualified my arguments with statements like "many" or "some," not "all."

I said I was "disturbed" by that certain kind of pornography - not opposed.
If you think I support puritanism and repression, you haven't read my
posts!  What exactly are you responding to, because it's not what I wrote.
Censorship?? No!  I wrote of changing consciousness, transformation of
ideas.  We are dealing with the realm of thought, how to change societal
mind-sets that may be destructive (like sexism).  That is not about
silencing people, it's about putting forth alternative ideas.

To point out some of the elements of porn that are sexist is not
puritanical.  I am not anti-sex -- far from it.  I am interested in how all
sexualities can be celebrated.  I am supportive of all pornography - I
specified the problem with mainstream pornography is when a certain
mind-set translates to women's role in society.

Questioning assumptions about sexuality is not puritanical, but the opposite.

Being anti-sexist is anti-male?  That's pretty insulting to men.

um, yes it did.

I have taken classes on Feminism and Pornography and on Women's Erotica.
However, it is too bad one must credential themselves before their opinion
is valid.

Then I would like to publicly apologize for any negative statements 
regarding what you are doing. My understanding was that this info 
was to be distributed via CD-ROM only. Sorry....

Tony-
	Thank you for having the faith in us that I thought everyone 
would have...I have responded to both Black Adder and Troy, but I don't 
know if what I said got through. The on-going project will be available 
on the WEB and on CD-Rom making it available for both netravers and for 
ravers not able to be on the net! And as I have said before the only 
reason for us charging for the CD-Roms is because it costs to get them 
pressed, we are not in any way trying to make money. We love raving that 
is the simple fact we are tryng to make it easier for felloe ravers to 
get in touch with who and what they need to. Why would we take advantage 
of people we respect. We cross post for the simle reason that dj's are 
located across the US and we want to make sure we have them all with 
correct information.

I don't think there's anything wrong with charging to cover your costs, 
but don't you think you could fit this database on one disk?

It pleases me to have read so many positive reviews of the F8 party.  In 
some ways it makes me wonder, "Are we talking about the same party?"

Perhaps it is far from fair to compare parties, for many are intensely 
unique in all ways.  however I was at the same site for the NMR the 
previous Friday and was still basking in the glow from that experience 
when I descended, unbeknownst to me at the time, into F8's littered hell. 
As I descended, I ran into two friends heading up and elsewhere, inviting 
me along.  The man spoke and expressed concern that if we didn't stop 
trashing this space, we would no longer be allowed to have parties there. 

Having seen this spot for the first time the previous week, I now 
understood why residents are extremely protective of it.  For
this location is magical, powerful, beautiful and more.  It embodies 
so much of what we all believe as we dance to heal ourselves and the 
injuries to our planet...that it simply boggles my mind..

Descending further, the music could be heard, glow sticks marked the way,
and the darkened majestic rock formations came into view. I believe they 
look like turtles, especially during the day, sea turtle heads..The surf 
was quite large and hammered the formations which are in their own way, 
crumbling into the sea..The sound was amazing..and the water was forced 
back out from under the land under greater pressure and 
speed.hissing loudly..Knowing there are hot springs down below  
defines the land even further.

Making my way down the somewhat trecherous steps (Deep appreciation to 
those of such sound body able to carry such loads so we can dance), and 
onto the first smaller cove, you could see these wondrous rock sculptures 
made by humans.. two last glow sticks lead the final leg to the larger 
cove which revealed the beach I have seen in photos (nudie beachg during the 
day) however the F8 crew back lite the cliffs in the cool colors of 
green and blue, with the campfire providing the warm colors. 

Looking around, I recognized two people I had met before, two F8 
DJ's, however over the course of the night, I had a few deeply 
interesting conversations with new friends.  At one point, I was given a 
vision for yet another painting, I sat with it for a long time, judging 
by the moon's descent into the sea.

Musically I have heard better weaving by everyone there, where it is 
seamless yet builds from one journey to the next...and while IMHO the 
mixing was so so this time around, the music itself, trance, as always
was fantastic...I especially liked Cyr's choices for the AM, however I 
was exhausted and left about 1/2 hour into his set...

What I took with me I had gathered during the night as the tide came in 
over the course of several hours.

When it was dark, and the sea sent one huge wave about every 20 minutes 
that touched more blankets than the last time, I walked the cove and picked 
up garbage which would have been washed out to sea rather shortly.
The pile of garbage grew as I placed them around the tiki torch I 
brought. I even asked for help several times and was met with blank faces..
Nothing hurt more during the night then to hear the glass breaking in the 
distance over the rocks.  I thought about the local residents who 
might cut their feet by noon on the same day. It is irrelevant that 
mother nature's natural rock tumbler will turn the glass back into sand. 
Second was having to listen to the nitrous balloons. Third was the 
silence of few smiles and laughter.

As I ascended, early light revealed beautiful plants and natures 
fractals.... Ferns...  I made peace with the plants as my hayfever slowly 
kicked in..Perhaps next time there won't be such a blatant disrespect for 
this sacred place...and I won't have to carry up such a load...more than 
the bottles, cans, and water botles and 'rubber balloons', but a 
heaviness in my heart, and a sadness that too many in the house really 
don't give a fuck.

Tonight, some 30+ rave waste items finds their way to a recycle bin instead 
of someone else's beach on another day.  Yes I counted them as an 
interesting statistic and one which I have been observing for some 
time.  It seems as if about 25% of the people who attend parties litter.   

I believe that something has to be done with those who are asleep 
environmentally...no excuses, no matter what age.  Being a hormone 
crazed high school student is no excuse, being too stoned is no excuse
there are none.  Teaching must begin immediately by all of us in a beauty 
way to these non-Green lost souls. 

I spoke with Mars briefly at Sunset about an idea I had for their next 
outdoor party regarding the above.

For now, I send those 25%, sweet green peace....

--Maureen

I was not questioning you, but the others who seemed to chime in after your
initial post.  I am looking at the impact and adressing it.  If you didn't
say it, then fine, leave it at that.  I think, I yourslef, and others, know
what YOU said and what you DID NOT say.  I accused you of nothing, I
addressed the impact and responses of the general audience, much as your
essay did.

Yes, yes.  And what about the struggles of humanity and the striving for
all of us, to be treated euqually?

Movies fetishize EVERYTHING, and that is probably where you and I disagree.
None is worse than the other.  Your tone however seems to indicate that
you do not feel the same way.

So now you have a respect metric that you determine what is good and what
is bad.  I think we can both agree that some things are bad (i.e. where one
person has no choice or will in the matter).  But beyond that your
statement denies the fact that there may be women who enjoy a certain level
of interaction with men.  Same with men.  There are some people who live
for desire sake alone.  And how someone deals with their realtionships is
no business of mine.

If a guy doens't want permanence and likes objectification, there are
others in the world that will feel similarly and they might be of service
to each other.  The world, IMO, is to wide and varied for me to interpret
the motives of others.  And engaging in such tactics, determing what is
healthy/good by looking at how someone processes their sexuality is the
height of arrogance.  As if we can ever really understand the complexities
of any given individual.

I just ain't that smart.

Basically if a guy likes porn and doesn't want to integrate it, fine.  If a
guy like porn and wants a woman like the kind he sees in movies, fine, as
long as the one he ends up with really wants to be there with him, by HER
choice.

Micromanagaing and overanalyzing sexuality is beyond my mortal capabilites.
As  far as I understand nature, we eat, we fuck/multiply, and we die.  One
we need to get to the next phase so that others may continue the struggle,
the other is a direct end result of such pursuits.

Yes, you are correct, I stand guilty.  I did give you props in a later
message.  I read what I wanted to read, but adressed my main concerns to
your opening statement (vitriol).  I guess we are both guilty in some
respects.  But I did give you props later.  Sorry for saying that you were
unlearned.  I do wonder whoever how much of your book learning translates
into everyday life.  For instance, do you know some/alot of sex-workers to
make any conclusions?

I think experience surpasses many things you read in books.  I do consider
them a solid foundation, but the quest for the truth is often  not found in
books, but in living.

You opinon.  But I've been told this happens quite a bit.  My only
suggestion is that you don't really know me.  And e-mail, IMO, is a
terrible way to know anyone.  It is a great way to talk some noise though.

You see what you want to see.

I see.

Thank you, and I feel the same about you.  The respect comes from replying.
Obviously it is something that is important enough for me to reply.  And
that is respect enough.  After all, there are other things we all could be
doing that are much more important and vital to our lives than argue about
sex, booty, and raves.

Ferocious?  The last time I understood that word it was in relation to an
animal.  I never knew humans could be ferocious unless they were exhibiting
an animalistic capacity.  Hmmm...

I am not an animal.  Animals are ferocious.

As for my tone, you will see and hear what you want see and hear.

>I find it ironic that in the name of justice, you
>feel justified in belittling and abusing people, and twisting their words.
>Puritanism?

And what abuse is that you're talking about?  And what belittling?  Did *I*
post t the posen "John Lee went down to Georgia"?  Did I even post anything
than a happy retort to someone who *poked fun at me*.  I don't think you
know me well enough to start casting allegations.  As a matter of fact, I
don't think you've been here long enough to know me well enough.

You said what you said and I interpreted it.  Maybe we've both said quite
enough.  Then again...she continues with her attack....

>How did you get THAT out of a feminist critique of mainstream
>porn? (NOT necessarily anti-porn!).  Don't you see any common ground
>between feminism and civil rights/the position of black folk?

It all depends on how you interpret civil rights.  Basically what one wants
out of civil rihts is recognition/respect outside of race/gender/etc. as a
human being.  But the other end of that sword asks that you be judged like
all other humans responsible for their own actions.

So in one way I see the struggles similarly, although the feminist movement
has left out sisters of color for some time now, and this is straight FACT.
Look at the memebers of the major feminist organizations.  You will see,
much as you see in most corporate boardrooms, a sea os sameness, with
little variation in hue.  The feminist movemnt could do much, with it's
mighty $$$ warchest, to bridge the gap of cimmunication with their sisters
of color, who have been all but left out.

>Or are you
>too blinded by watching "betties shaking it" (at a RAVE, where women hope
>for respect) and calling porn's portrayal of women "entertainment" ?



Hope for respect?  Is that what you go to parties for?  Self-validation
isn't enough.  Lookee here lady, I go out to have a good time and to shake
my ass.  I like other PEOPLE around me shaking their asses.  If I think the
girls all that, then fine.  If she didn't want to be looked at then she
shouldn't dance in public (There was a time when I couldn't look at no
woman, less massah either hang me or kill me.  Now that those days are
over, I intend to do some extra looking for all those brothers who
couldn't).  Same goes for guys, don't want people looking at you, then
don't dance in public.  Don't want people to call five-oh on you while
puffin' up?  Don;t do it in public.  Don't want people watch you fuck?
Keep the windows closed and don't fuck in public.

Geez, whatever happened to personal responsibility.

I don't see women at parties as objects.  Some are my freinds, my friends
wives, etc.  Some are not.  Some are called Betty, and I might like her,
especially if she's "shakin' it".

Please.

Other than that your assertion is true, I am easily distracted by booty.
If it's flat, it ain't all that....

>Why
>is YOUR concept of injustice the only one that matters?

Mine is the nly one that matters. Simply said, I cannot account for others.
Some of my brothers AND sisters in Africa think that denying a woman a
circumsicion is an injustice.  I do not agree.  Therefore, I try to only
account for my rules, and ways of being.  If others agree fine, then maybe
we can form a union, a country whatever, maybe even a govt.  But I have to
start somewhere, might as well be with me.  Dig?

>And why does it
>only encompass capitalism (I agree with you) and racism (I agree with you),
>but not sexism?

My posts in the past noted sexism.  But I see sexism as a two way street.
There are as many men who objectify women as women who objectify men.  This
is all done under various guises.  But for women, I certainly do wonder how
many of them would enjoy the lifelong company of someone who couldn't earn
a buck (like the bums who sleep in the park near my house).  I don't see
many SF women seeing them as a prize.  Men have often felt that we are
assumed certain tasks and responsibilites ($$$).  One of them is earning
power.  Yeah, yeah, personality is all fine, but it don't pay the bills.
Objectification at some levels serves a purpose I think.

Men are often seen as money, and women are often seen as sex.

Like I said, objectification can take many forms.  And both sides are
guilty.  What I find absent from your commentary (all that which was not an
attack on/of my character), is this dual edged sword fact.

>
>John, I read your posts with interest.  You have an incisive wit, and an
>analysis of society that is needed.  But often these ideas are couched in
>anger and disrespect.

Let me say something now so you and others can at least stop the baiting,
for all of you will surely drive me to anger.  I am not angry.  The only
thing anyone can accuse me of is being me.

I am straightforward and to the point.  I don't fuck around and expect
nothing less from those I talk with.  Solar has called me a "very serious"
guy, but is puzzled at my capability to laugh, even at myself (touche'
SDream :) ).  I tell you what is on my mind and in a direct fashion.   I
don't couch my speech with anything.

I am right as often as I am wrong.  Like everyone else.

Well that's pretty much it.

You will know when I am agnry, and I can say, that I haven't been really
angry in a while....but maybe my time is near.

>I feel you contradict yourself by being for social
>justice while viciously tearing into somebody/some position you have
>invented for them.

I only hold you to what you say.

Contradictions are a part of being human. Neither I nor you are free from
them.  I do feel that I have been straight up with folx.  And if you show
me the passge where I contradict myself, I would be pleased to know, and
correct myself if necessary.

And I gave you props in another message.  I still stand by my analysis of

But what is the net effect.  I think this needs to be analyzed as well.
When you say that somethign does something, one must consider how people
will react to change the situation.  The porn = objectification has been
used quite effectively to stifle certain forms of speech/art.

I am sure you are aware of this historical fact.

I think that you made certain assumtions about the male psyche. I can point
them out to you if necessary.  Inherently sexist, since males follow all
kinds of patterns.  It all depends on how one was raised.

You made males the subject.  I certainly need no qualifications of my
retort.  Maybe you might want to broaden the discussion to include all
genders?

Being anti-sexist means that you must also account for objectification
wherever it occurs.  And it happens with men, moreso than women.  The
effects are different becuase the expectations are different, on both sides
(or many) of the gender isle.

Just a thought.

Oh no, I am glad you credentialed yourself.  And I see that you have good

Strippers (dancers)?  Phone sex workers?  Peep show workers?  Etc.

Only so much can be found in books IMO.

                          !!!RIGHT ON NANCY!!!

 You GO girl! Damn that was good! I loved reading your post on porn and 
your response to what seems to be a common " I'll bury my head in the 
sand response when I hear something I don't like. " reply from John.  =)


 Just a couple of thoughts -- I did a research paper on pornography.  
Unfortunately it was not as in depth as I would have liked it to be. One 
thing I did learn, however, was that the word 'pornagraphy' originally meant 
stories told by prostitutes in order to incite men to lust (and 
supposedly encourage them to buy their services). We should keep in mind 
that the only surviving records of these events were supposed to have 
been written by men (who were absolutely unbiased ;) ). Eventually  porn 
became synonymus with violence and domination of women (by men). I 
believe this occured first in Europe and eventually moved to 
America via monograms and eventually photographs, during the Victorian 
era. If anyone is interested, e-mail me and I can dig out my old paper and 
more accurately remember the contents and refer to sources.

Dear stephen and todd:

meet and talk and go from there

I plan on going to England next year around the time that they're having 
the Tribal Gathering (if they attempt it again in '97).  If they don't 
have it, I plan on going to other parties, clubs, record stores, etc. 
etc. and sampling the local "cuisine."  If any else is interested in 
going with our group, let me know.. I'm just trying to get an idea of 
exactly how many people will go.  If you start saving now, all you'll 
really need to do is get a little money for the plane ticket and some 
more for spending money, and there you have it....  Even if you're not 
POSITIVE, just interested, let me know....

John
