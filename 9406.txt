hi! i am an astronomy grad student and i regret
to inform y'all that there will be no parties
going on while the comet chunks are hitting
jupiter, because i will be stuck in west virginia
at that time looking at the planet with a radio
telescope.
-----------------------------------------------------
No parties for you, that is.


sadly, the impact will be very unspectacular. the
comet will hit the side of jupiter that we can't
see from earth. the earth's sky will not change
color at all, but frogs and cooked pigeons are
expected to fall from the sky in some areas. (^_^)

But the atmospherical turbulence might be kinda cool looking.

Thanks, Lee and Janie--

For all you did to make In the Light happen;
thanks, too, for summing up so eloquently what
it meant both for our community and the larger
community who experienced it with us in the light
in the park!

Thanks, everyone who participated in any way! To
those who worry the vibe is dead, etc., etc., I
hope you were there!

Will

We mentioned 2CB as a possible ingredient in some tablets being sold
as e.  After further research, we think it's probably DOB...which is ok I 
guess- but not in that atmosphere.  Seemed like more of a nature thing 
really.  And it lasts a LONG LONG LONG time.

THANKS!! To Lee, Larry, and everyone else for a great In The Light - It 
seemed as though the participants and the public enjoyed the positive 
energy radiating out from the sand lot. It was sort of appropriate that 
we were there with the Dead Sea Scrolls... It did make parking a bit of a 
challenge ( I am still on crutches so had to park close - and the parking 
police even helped me get into the spot I found after circling for an 
hour :-) ) The only negative moment was when I spotted 5 very healthy 
appearing people get out of a shiny new car parked in a Handicapped spot. 
Yes, she did have a placard and maybe has a deadly heart condition for all I 
know,  but IMHO, if you're not truly handicapped, placard or not, you 
should not abuse the parking priviledge.. But I shook it off and kept 
circling.. Sorry to contribute to our atmospheric pollution.. I really 
enjoyed Markie's set, will have to catch Meme and Laura next time! Later, 
after waiting to get into Survival Research Labs show for another 2 hours %-)
( I bailed) I went back to Funky Techno Tribes/ Come Unity's party at 
Ceasars. I was there early, and enjoyed seeing all those youthful ravers 
that were mentioned recently in sfr discussions having a GREAT time! Good 
for them, and for us! On sunday, I had the pleasure of meeting Robert 
Jesse( Monterey Posse) at A Groovy Summers Day at Miss Pearls. So it was 
a fab weekend, even if my foot was killing me by Monday!! Thanks again!
Peace. Lady Trash

 I just wanted to mention that I won't be bringing myself or the "boom

Hi boys & girls

I work in one famouse russian newspaper. Some days ago I suddenly realise
that it would be very good to write a big article about american &
european music groups (and singers too) which aren't famouse & wellknown
all over the world. I'm sure that russian young people would be glad to
know something about it. So my suggessions are: 1. In every city, town or
campus there're couple (or may be much more) very good unknown bends which
play in some cafes, clubs & so on. Please, send me a discription of your
favorit bend from the place your live in. 2. I'd be very glad to learn
about their music style, lirics (could some one send me four-five lines
from their best song?), what they are singing about (for example,
suicides, drags, love or greenpeace). 3. Then I'm interested in details.
Discripsion of their conserts, their privit life & of course all your own
thoughts are welcome. Sorry for mistakes and bad language. Great thankes
in advance. With big love from Russia, Anna

EarthSpace
Seattle 5/28/94

We arrived at 10:30pm and were among the first 30 or so people.
The site was 45 minutes northeast of Seattle - a huge meadow
surrounded by trees, hills and streams.  The weather was drizzly
and chilly but the enthusiasm was clear.  Notable planning and
consideration were put into this party.  Two main sound areas,
a chill tent and a food pavilion.  The main sound system was
already running with Shocka from Portland at the helm.  For some
reason (intuition), I danced lunatish from the getgo while friends
gathered at one of several fires (olts of wood on hand).  A steady
stream of people kept the energy rising, and a few dozen people
were dancing in the wet grass as Jon Howard took over, though the 
majority were sticking near the fires.

Things started going a little wrong when the two main sound stacks 
failed around 12:30, remaining intermittent for the next hour or
two.  Fortunately, there was a third tower set out from the main
dance area and its fire which carried on.  I would say the party
peaked between 2 and 3:30 when there was a small but definite rave
happening by these working speakers, and we had the longest period
of no rain.  Major thrill as this group hooted and jumped through
a favorite song of mine I can only identify as "Never Gonna Let It
Get Me Down."  What a jam!!

Masa from Seattle was calmly kicking the butt of unhapiness when I
noticed the main speakers were working, so we moved around the fire
to the front again.  But with everyone (moving) still on the other
side, we were quickly drawn back.  Then someone got on the P.A. and
asked everyone to please come and share their energy with Masa.  
This was cool, as a lot of people responded, including those who 
had not been dancing before.

Things were totally groovy at this point, around 3:45, with about
half of the estimated 300 people there hanging near the sound. Then
disaster struck.  The sound cut off, and someone came on the P.A.
saying "The police are here.  Seems the sound can be heard by a
neighbor a mile away, which is a good thing if you happen to like
house music, but not a good thing if you don't happen to like 
house music.  We're on private land, so we don't have to leave, 
but we can't resume the beat till 9am.  Everyone hang while we 
figure out what to do."

We warmed by a fire while people conferenced.  It was decided by 
the group mind (yes!) to wait it out rather than try to move the
party.  It was getting light when we moved to the chill tent.  This
ended up being the highlight of the experience for me, as about 20
people lying under and on a tarp enjoyed the fantastic psychedelic
ambient music, the pouring rain and the marvelous green.  It was
one of those times when I realize again why we sometimes jump 
through such big hoops to end up in scenes like this.

We left around 7am, as some in our group were pretty shagged.  It
seemed at least a hundred or so were still there as we left.  I 
been told earlier that Dub Tribe was going to play for two and a
half hours, but I don't know if they did.  The sun broke through
as we drove home, so I'm optimistic that the faithful were treated
to a beautiful morning.

	Wow, that's quite the middle name.. :)  I know exactly what you
mean, though.  That's really cool to give us a listing of the tracks
you play, because a lot of djs, even though they might not tape their
labels, sort of try to keep their music a secret.  I don't live in
sf, but I must say, you delve into some pretty hard trance compared
to the "popular" underground music on the west coast.  This is a
great thing.  Progressive house and progressive trance are my
favorite types of music, but I have a lot of respect for DJs that
stay true to the underground.  I'm not saying that all the big name
DJs (wicked posse, etc) aren't 'underground', but when you hear the
same high energy house all the time it can become almost like 'top
40'.  Just for an example, how many of you could hum or sing 2 fatt
guitars on a moments notice?  Even though people might pester you to
play house, or to play music that they can get into more, I really
enjoy a DJ that has a _unique_, experimental style.  Some people just
aren't open-minded enough.  Variety is good in all things :)

Hello everyone,

I have just joined the list and had a few questions.  My first one isn't exactly
related to the SF scene but has anyone heard of how Circa 94 is going to be here
in LA?  It sounds pretty big, but wondered if anyone knew more about it up there
in SF.  Also, does anyone know of a mailing list similar to SFRAVES that serves
the LA area? it's awful hard to find out about events down here... maybe i'm
just not looking in the right place... thanks for your help...

P.S. - In The Light was great - thanks Lee and everybody.  I had fun
at Spundae too.  I hadn't been to DV8 since the days of
Osmosis.  It's actually a pretty good space, and Spundae almost
maxed it out with four dance floors (I think there's a fourth
floor and a roof space they weren't using).  So anyway, there was
plenty of music to go around - I heard Garth, Carlos, Jeno, Markie,
Gavan and several other DJs while I was there.

Here's something that came from alt.drugs: the address of a testing lab. Many of
you have probably seen it before (anyone actually use it? Let us know...).

>>S.P. Lab, 55426 N.W. 79th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33166.  They
>>      ask for a sample wrapped in foil or plastic, enclosed in an
>>      envolope, with a slip of paper telling the alleged content,
>>      cost, any undesirable side-effects noticed, $25.00 per sample,
>>      and a five-digit number to identify the sample.  After 14 days,
>>      call (305) 757-2566 for the result.

Of course, if you already shelled out the $ for the drug itself, shelling out
more to find out if it was what it was sold as is annoying, to say the least.
Too bad dealers (or the makers) can't be more honest. Any honest dealers out
there?

hi all, 
        this is just to let you know of the california hemp fest this
saturday June 4th.  It is at the bandshell in golden gate park and it's
free.  Live entertainment by Fishbone, Fungo Mungo, Total Devastation, DJ
Markie Mark ( full moon ), Asphalt Poetry and the Marginal Profits. There
is also going to be a lot of different booths by hemp importers, retailers
and producers etc.  The event is put on by The Cannabis Action Network and
High Times Magazine.  Communion will have a booth with a small sound system
and dj's josh, galen and markie.  It starts at noon and go's to 6pm.
        That night I am putting on a party to celebrate the festival and
the 20th anniversary of high times. There will be 4 bands there, a fusion
of hip hop, acid  jazz, funk and rap. House will be provided by markie
mark, tony and bam bam.  Markie will be playing an obscure set of different
music to fuse from the bands to the dj's.  This event has a lot of
potential.  We are making an attempt at integration, by exposing  different
cultures of peoples to the same experience.  I believe a lot of cultures
are portraying a similar message, going the same direction, we are just on
different paths.  I deeply believe in the rave culture, but we alone are
not going to bring about enough change to sustain the survival of humanity.
 Integration of like minded peoples into a global consciousness of
community is the only way forward.  
info  415 267 4800
$5 18 & over, no alcohol, all profits to cannabis action network 
respects

Things got started up a again around 8:00am with Jacquelyn Christie(WOW)

Well, thank you! :-)  I was pretty bummed when they had to shut down the 
sound system, we thought we were far enough out there to not cause any 
problems... oh well... I played for the first 2 1/2 hours of "the long 
noiseless period" in the ambient tent and I could really feel that 
everyone in the tent was well-immersed.  I'm glad you had an enjoyable 
time in there, because I sure did... I was worried that ambient music 
would never be seen in high regard in this area, but I'd like to thank 
the Choc-Lit Factory and especially Ethan for seeing that the ambient DJs 
got a nice tent and a wonderful sound system.  With no bleed from the 
main system and an interested crowd, I'd have to say that Earthspace was 
the best site I've ever played on.  It's really hard to articulate how it 
feels to play for the sunrise.. it's just brilliant.

Peace,
Matt Corwine

Hi does anyone know of any mailing lists for Raves in England? Or a way to find 
out info on Raves over there? I am going on a trip there in July for 3weeks and 
would like to go to some.  Thanks in advance.

All five listings for this weekend look pretty good, plus Pump on
Saturday night, and there should also be a boat party this weekend
(check with Bulletproof).  Sadly, Light-n-Up has ended before it
really got going.  The list of weeklies looks pretty healthy right
now, although there might be a little dead wood in there.

About 900 people now get this list via sfraves or sfraves-calendar.

Thanks to everyone who's been sending in info!

Some of us, myself included, have what are called "invisible 
disabilities" that are not readily apparent to the ignorant. I myself 
quit using my placard (and I've regretted it) because of dirty looks from 
people who I guess just don't know any better. So basically, I decided 
that even though I have a very painful messed up foot and profound 
inner-ear damage (I get disoriented very easily) and asstd. other health 
problems, I got so sick of being the target of nasty vibes and worse 
looks that I just don't bother to get another one, even though I am 
legally entitled to it. (now you all know why I hardly ever dance and 
don't stay late and stumble around like a drunk when it's dark) :)

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest... :)

Are you referring to the stuff that has made two of my friends quite 
sick? It takes about 9 hrs. to go away and is profoundly dysphoric.

Whoever is putting this stuff out had better hope I don't find them... :)

VERY GOOD NEWS FOR The Sisters and SFR folks

   Here is some interesting info for you...   It turns out that the
Kennell Club at 628 Divisidero has just turned under new ownership,  and
I had a very long and most interesting meeting with these folks.   We all
sat around the bar (Drinks complimentary),  and discussed some pretty 
amazing new concepts.   Details to follow later.....

   They plan to call their club "The Crash Palace",  and will be featuring
a large variaty of entertainment groups.    This also includes raves,  but
right now,  they are fighting noise complaints from their former tenants,
and work is being done to contain the noise problem,  and build a better
repiour with their neighbors.   

   They started asking me questions about how to set up the dance area,
I suggested they put in some floor fans.    When I suggested what kinds 
of fans were needed in the dance area,  they asked me where to get them,
and sincerely intend to make things much better.    

   When I mentioned that the Sisters needed a space for their parties, 
they said that as long as it wasn't EVERY WEEK,  the Sisters would be
invited to use the space.    They are also amienable to holding SFR
parties,  Basics,  or any Martin o Brian production,   but held
some reservation about having a WICKED held there.

   The space is fantastic,  if you haven't been there.    It is primarily
one large space,   high ceilings,   and well ventilated.

I agree with John that the former Kennel Club has potential. BUT, as a former
resident of that neighborhood, i doubt they'll ever get the permit for going
all night.  even if they *do* succeed, it will eventually get yanked.  I lived
not more than 250 feet from that locale, and all i ever heard from it was
"thump, thump, wah, wah" and the sound of crashing bottles.  the population
density in that neighborhood is quite high (it's primarily residential), and
mostly people who work during the day.  Parking is also extremely tight in
the neighborhood, and was only saved by the fact that after 2PM, we could
find a legal, safe place to park.  i do wish them the best of luck in their
endeavors.

Here's the entry from Pihkal,  check the duration. Its a doozy.

DOB; 2,5-DIMETHOXY-4-BROMOAMPHETAMINE

DOSAGE: 1.0 - 3.0 mg. (which is a really small amount)

DURATION: 18 - 30 h. 
	  ~~~~~~~~~
	  ~~~~~~~~~


QUALITATIVE COMMENTS: (with 0.4 mg) There was a distinct enhancement
of visual perception, and some strengthening of colors.  A clean, cold
feeling of wind on the skin.  I felt an enriched emotional affect, a
comfortable and good feeling, and easy sleeping with colorful and
important dreams.

(with 2.0 mg) There was a continuous tremor at the physical level,
and an incredible Moebius strip representation of reality at the
intellectual level.  I was able to enter into personal problems
easily, and get out again when I chose to.  During the next day, there
were brief lapses of attention, or little fugue states, and it was not
until the following evening that I was completely myself again.

(with 2.8 mg) About three hours into this I had a severe cramp, and
had a near fainting response to the pain, and yet there was no pain!
I felt that I was very near a loss of consciousness, and this was most
disturbing.  There were flashes of depersonalization.  I saw rings
around the moon with prismatic colors, and there were long-lasting
Rafter-imagesS following any viewings of points of light.  I was still
a good plus 1 at 14 hours, but did manage to sleep.  It was the next
day before I was again at baseline.

(with 3.0 mg) This was a complex, but a very good day.  It involved
making a large pot of chicken-vegetable soup, and listening to H.L.,
my favorite Saturday morning fundamentalist Christian radio preacher,
bless Tim.  The Democrats are not exactly all anti-American dupes of
Moscow (or the Devil), but to H.L., they are practically, almost,
next-door to it.  The Rapture is supposed to happen tomorrow according
to a certain book, newly published (just in time, looks like) and he
is busy softening the possible disappointment of those who may find
themselves unchanged Monday morning.  Wunnerful.  It's been one heck
of a good experiment, and I canUt understand why we waited nine years
to try this gorgeous stuff.  Without going into the cosmic and
delicious details, let's just say itUs a great material and a good
level.

(with 0.5 mg of the RRS isomer) I am underway, and this is a smooth
intoxication.  I am completely functional, but still really a plus
two.  I would not choose to drive a car.  Not very far.  I felt a
rather quick dropping to a plus-one at the fifth hour, but there is a
residual stimulation still the following morning.

(with 1.0 mg of the RRS isomer) By the fourth hour I am absolutely a
+++ and am searching the kitchen for food.  But what I eat is only
so-so.  There is not the introspection or intensity of 2.0 milligrams
of the racemate material, but this is a rewarding place nonethless.
At the 18th hour, there was some fitful sleep, with bizarre dreams.
The next day I was still hungry for altered spaces, and successfully
challenged the residual plus one with LSD and, as is usually the case,
acid cut right through the detritus and allowed a direct shot up to a
+++ again.

(with 1.5 mg of the RRS isomer) This is a +++ but it is vaguely
irrational.  I feel a heavy body load, but then the temperature
outside is over a hundred degrees and I may not be in the best of all
physical environments.  I would not wish any higher dosage.  There
were cat-naps at the twelth hour, but most symptoms were still there
at the 18th hour.  A good experience.  It would be interesting to
compare this, some day, with 3.0 milligrams of the racemate.

(with 0.5 mg of the RSS isomer) There are no effects at all.

(with 1.0 mg of the RSS isomer) There is something warm and nice at a
couple of hours into this, but I am no more than threshold, and the
effects are very slight.  By the fifth hour there are no longer any
effects.

EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY: The stars had clearly lined up in favor of
making DOB and exploring its biological activity.  This preparation
had been completed in 1967 and the report of this compound and its
unprecedently high potency published in 1971.  And very shortly, two
additional papers appeared completely independently.  One described
DOB made via a different route, and describing high activity in rats.
The other described DOB and a couple of closely related brominated
amphetamines and their action in man.

This is one of the last of the experimental compounds within the
phenethylamine family on which any animal toxicity studies were
performed by me prior to human studies.  A mouse injected with 50
mg/Kg (ip) showed considerable twitching and was irritable.  Another,
at 100 mg/Kg (ip), had overt shaking at 20 minutes, which evolved into
persistent hyperactivity that lasted several hours.  Yet another, at
125 mg/Kg (ip), lost much of her righting reflex within 15 minutes,
entered into convulsions at 50 minutes, and was dead a half hour
later.  A fourth mouse, at 150 mg/Kg (ip), entered into spontaneous
convulsions within 10 minutes, and expired in what looked like an
uncomfortable death at 22 minutes following injection.  What was
learned?  That the LD/50 was somewhere between 100 and 125 mg/Kg for
the mouse.  And an effective dose in man of maybe 2 mg (for an 80 Kg
man) is equivalent to 25 ug/Kg.  Therefore the index of safety (the
therapeutic index, the lethal dose divided by the effective dose) is
well over a thousand.  I feel that two mice were killed without
anything of value having been received in return.

Actually, it is very likely that the damaging, if not lethal, level of
DOB in man is a lot lower than this ratio would imply.  There was a
report of a death of a young lady following the snorting of an amount
of DOB so massive, there was the actual recovery of over nine
milligrams of the drug from her body tissues in the post-mortem
examination.  It was said that she and her companion had thought that
the drug they were using was MDA and, taking a dosage appropriate for
this, effectively overdosed themselves.  He survived, following
convulsions and an extended period (several weeks) of being in a
comatose state.  Tragic examples have been reported that involve
arterial vascular spasm.  But in most overdose cases ascribed to DOB,
the identity of the drug has remained unestablished.

As with DOI, the presence of a heavy atom, the bromine atom, in DOB
makes the radioactive isotope labelled material a powerful research
tool.  Studies with DOB labelled with either 82Br or 77Br have been
used in human subjects to follow the distribution of the drug.  The
use of a whole body scanner permits the imaging of the intact body,
with the travelings of the radioactivity easily followed from outside.
A fascinating finding is that DOB goes first and foremost to the human
lung where it accumulates for a couple of hours.  It is only
afterwards that the brain level builds up.  There is a strong
implication that some metabolic conversion occurs in the lung, and it
is only after this that the truly active metabolite is available for
central action.  This is consistent with the relatively slow onset of
effect, and the very long duration of action.

As with all the other psychedelics which can and have been studied as
their optical isomers, it is the RRS isomer of DOB that is the more
active than the racemic mixture, and the RSS is certainly much less
active, but it has never been run up to fully active levels.  The
alpha-ethyl homologue of DOB is mentioned under ARIADNE.  The
positionally rearranged isomers of DOB are discussed under META-DOB.

okay-seems there  is something dodgy going around pretending to be e.  It 
is definately psychoactive, but it's difficult to describe exactly what 
it is that it's doing.  You are high-you feel strange.  Sounds are 
intensified.  It isn't a touchy-feely thing 
(definately not e).  And yes, it lasted for over 20 hours.  DOB is 2,5 
Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine.  It can be eaten or snorted and the 
recommended dosage is .5mg - 1mg.  50mg is an OD.  It can ccause 
vasoconstriction of the extremities which can result in gangrene and loss 
of limbs.  Onset: 1-2 hours
           Plateau: 8-12 hours   
           Baseline: 16-18 hours
it causes no loss of lucidity-it keeps you awake-but sitting and tripping 
on nothing very stimulating or interesting.  Our sense was "Yeah, we're 
tripping.  We feel funny.  So What!"  For us this drug held no 



 
enlightenment-no magick.  That might have had a lot to do with the 
environment we were in.  We began enjoying ourselves when we were out of 
the club environment.  Sounds had a powerful layered quality--and both of 
us found that we were extremely sensitive to the unconscious body 
language that people used.  It was as if a lot of people were 
caricatures instead of actual human beings.  Maybe it wasn't DOB.  We 
thought it was 2CB for awhile-but it lasted too long and there was no sex 
vibe present-which I've heard is present in 2CB.  Oh well, go figure.
Know it's out there-beware means BE AWARE.
peace love and lots of joy

Did anyone call those numbers that were listed on sfraves a short time ago?  They are quite odd.  One is Pixar's complaint dep't, in which the computerized answering machine hangs up on you.  The other is something in which you are told about the theory of "okayism".  I highly recommend that you don't call either.  Quite a waste of time.

DOB--I think--Okay, we were given these white tablets that looked like 
oversized aspirin--horsepills.  Ever eat a big fat codeine?  It looked 
(and tasted) a lot like that.  I don't remember there being any numbers 
or distinguishing marks on the pills -- but they could have been there.  
I made the purchase from someone who hasn't let me down in 2 1/2 years.  
Took him by suprise as well.  Good luck kiddies.

also, please remember that when you call those numbers, they have your
phone number, by virtue of it being an 800 number. if they pay for it
they somehow have a right to know who called.

so, if you're paranoid enough, you can find reasons to be uneasy w/
numbers being distributed on lists such as sfr, and then having various
marketeers/spooks 'n' weenies adding another correlation between you
and your number and your interests.

just last week, i called a very strange number from MCI that someone
had posted by e-mail -- i was piqued with the description "looks like
MCI has lost it" so I called to find out about what the weirdness was.
That evening, I got a call from MCI asking whether I wanted to switch
to their service, and I have never gotten a call from MCI before. Could
be coincidence, but I doubt it.

Hi Everyone,

I am writing what will soon be a quarterly club and event guide for the West
Coast for a house music industry magazine called Underground News. It's going
to be a very small (too small) sampler of nightlife in several U.S. and 
International cities printed in an insert booklet intended for people to
pull out and take with them on vacations.  My job is to describe around
10 or so places in each city that I would take someone to if they were only
visiting for a short time.  I would like it to be a better representation
than just the places that I think are cool because let's face it, I don't
necessarily know where the real cool places are.  I am asking for your
input - if you could name off 5-10 clubs that you like to attend in your
area and perhaps one or two reasons why (space, vibe, DJs, price, whatever).
Additionally, I am interested in those local haunts for food, coffee, 
drinking or just unique nightlife. To give you an idea of what I have started
with, these are some of the clubs that I will probably talk about:

Los Angeles

Brass
Public Space
Moontribe events (don't worry guys, no phone number!!)
Sketch Pad
Respect
Sweet Sundays
Parliament
Small Factory of Sound
Ambient Lounge

San Francisco

Come-Unity
Wicked
SPAZ
Spundae
Spiral Jive
Pepper
Organic
Test

If there are serious objections to any of those, I would love to hear it as
well. I am going to mention sfraves and socal-raves as invaluable resources
in learning about events, and perhaps give the (calendar-only?) addresses? Do
you think this is a good idea. Please forgive all of the questions and please
do take the time to let me know what  your favorite spots are!

Thanks,


Tamara


P.S. I guess I will also be doing radio too but I think I've got that covered...

Hey Hey!

     I'm curious did anyone go to Pure Space last night at the DNA?  Since I
live down in San Jo it's hard to get to the city on a week night but I'm sure I
missed something.  The Djs were John Williams : Jeno : Ernie Munson!!!  If
anyone went and can give a report that would be cool.  

Thanx in advance                          Tamotsu

1-  a note from the editor---
 
Dear fellow pronoids--
 
As one of our rainbow netweavers recently said, life is a resource to
discover, not a problem to be solved.  A pattern is emerging from deep
within the chaos, and when it finally gels into something recognisable, the
cultural virus will be on a forever-groove.
 
When I last saw Fraser Clark, he was warbling a melody with Lady Miss Kier
of Deee-Lite over the phone: ...people are conspiring to he-e-e-e-elp
you...!
 
The net is being woven in increasingly strange and wonderful patterns, and
if one of the patterns should suddenly shift while still on the loom,
please
forgive and realize the nature of chaos is... well, chaotic.
 
On THAT NOTE, there is a Major Change in the tour schedule (Item 5),
specifically, the first gig.  The NASA event fizzled, no fault of the
Zippies!  But, we must have ashes from which a phoenix can arise... so a
HUGE loving welcome to the crew at Liquid Sky in New York City.  The reggae
gig we have been invited to will not be a BIG ZIPPY EVENT, but it will be a
meeting of the subcultures, and a hell of a good jam, mon.
 
The next newsletter will be written from the steaming bowels of New York
City.  Look for the butterfly squirming from the core of a rotting apple...

2-  The Whole Earth Lectronic Link (WELL) feedback
 
Q:   What do you call one zippy walking down the street?
A:   A virtual riot.
 
On the WELL, in the g house conference, the topic The Zippies has surpassed
the 100-person mark.  Linked to topics in g wired and fringeware, we have
been seeing some *sirius* personalities appear to give their two cents.
>From famous cyberpunk science fiction authors, to underground zine
editors,
to granola-munching rainbow warriors---  the Cyber-tour has been underway
for weeks.  Thanks to all who are participating in this and other areas of
the NET (like alt.rainbow, alt.rave).  The tour is much more empowered due
to the honest dialogue in these virtual communities.  Special thanks to M
Normal, the hostess of g house.

3-  some zippy personalities
 
Everybodys got something to hide, cept for me and my monkey.
                              -Lennon/McCartney
 
What the- who are those strange people looking befuddled at the hustle of
Times Square?  Are they tourists?  Are they extra-terrestrials?  Are they
Illuminati agents?  No, theyre pale Brits with colourful clothes and BIG
attitudes.
 
Fraser Clark, Igniter of tinder---  From the recesses of your foggy 60s
memories, here comes the blond Scotsman sporting a perprtual grin, giving
hugs to all.  From his mouth flows the rolling language of the Zippy
spokesperson extraordinaire-- the promoter of the Megatripolis club in
London--- the editor of Encyclopaedia Psychedelica.
 
Angus Dunwoodydun, the Tech Czar---  Fresh from mixing the live feed of MTV
Europe in the new all-digital studios in London, its the director and
producer of the official zippy documentary film.  Look out for his low-key
delivery and incredible resourcefulness.  Remember to smile for the camera!
 
Catriona Morgan (Kate), the Welsh Weaverwoman---   If she doesnt look right
at you during a conversation, thats ok-  shes probably writing a verbatim
transcript in her little day-planner book.  Tour management never looked so
zippy.  Shes the one negotiating with the Buddhist accountant.
 
...more to come...

This is my first post!  I have been observing the list for a few
months and I just wanted to comment on the SRL show.  Except for the
waiting and the conterfit tickets that messed things up, the show was
really good.  I saw the one 5 years ago in SF and although it was
interesting I couldn't see anything up close.  The show 5 years ago
was held under a freeway overpass and the sonic booms were defening!
I was glad that they had to forsight to pass out ear plugs for this
show.  The SRL people tried to cram everybody in- even the extras but
I guess the fire marshal wouldn't allow it.  The highlight was the
Lightening generator!  There was a giant dinasour like machine, a
sonic canon that spit fire.  a walking cat like machine, multiple
flame machines, a giant spinning top that had neon letters all over
it.  a "Last Supper" effigy that was burned to a crisp. Noise, smoke
and machines.  They did well!  It is very hard to describe the overall
effect, but I enjoyed the show.  Try downloading from the SRL archive
for some cool pictures!  anonymous ftp srl.org if you want them.

                                             Mr Klinik

P.S. does anyone know where Earthspace was at?  Was it in Seattle?

Hello everyone,

I have just joined the list and had a few questions.  My first one
isn't exactly related to the SF scene but has anyone heard of how
Circa 94 is going to be here in LA?  It sounds pretty big, but
wondered if anyone knew more about it up there in SF.  Also, does
anyone know of a mailing list similar to SFRAVES that serves the LA
area? it's awful hard to find out about events down here... maybe i'm
just not looking in the right place... thanks for your help...

I refuse to have anything to do with something that caters to
"zippies". The concept is okay, but the term is as annoying as using
"New Age" to describe ambient music.

Likewise, I won't attend events that have clowns on the flyers.

A fellow has to have his standards :).

I recall a few days ago someone questioned someone else
as to their affiliations and motiviations for posting 
about  a party.  Well, here are mine for the Zippy thing:

I am only re-posting the information I am finding out
because so many rumors and so much mis-information has 
been circulated.  I'd hate for someone to drive down there
or buy plane tickets or something based on hearsay.

I personally have NO connection with the Zippies, I
just don't want anyone to get messed up because 
they heard the wrong rumor or the wrong dates or something 
like that.

Just trying to be helpful to the net-rave community,
where mis-information traels at the speed of light.

this may have already been covered and I know its not a rave related 
question so what the hell is a zippy.  Thats got to be one of the 
funniest names for a stereotype I've ever heard.  In the context of 
dialogue it sounds like this:

question:  "Hey, who are those people over there?"
response:  "Oh, don't mind them.  They're just zippies."
 
I don't know, maybe I'm the only one who finds this word extremely funny

Indeed, I agree, and always try to give people the benefit of the doubt 
that they may have a disability that is not apparent. But there *may* be 
way too many people using Grandma's handicapped placard though she isn't 
there, despite the possibility they may be asked to show the accompanying 
card. I'm sorry you suffer and do not feel comfortable to use a placard, 
as you are certainly entitled to it. Peace. Lady Trash

I agree! I am appalled by the use of clowns (they are evil) and the term 
"zippies" is so, well, _manufactured_.  :)

Yes, the Kennel or Crash Palace ( I kinda like it.. ) is a GREAT venue - 
Did Yerg leave the 3 video screens and installed light show? We ( IMPACT 
Lighting ) had installed 4 Trackspots ( Moving lights )recently. If not. 
there is a great balcony from which lightshows can be shown. Did anyone 
see Ozric Tentacles there? They do like ambient music jams! 
Unfortunately, they have always had noise complaint problems with the 
neighbors.. Good Luck! ;^) Lady Trash

Great, just what The City needs-- cops fucking with innocent people for

solving...
Hey, everybody-- read "Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do" by Peter

I'm definately feeling an  onslaught of OVER-AGE drinking and prescription

would be so gratified if they would.

Thank you. You not only gave *me* a chance to gripe, you opened the door

Thanks Matt/Jess/GreySix; it was a really fun way to celebrate XLR8R, 
which has connected us with each other all over everywhere and given us 
all a forum through which to say some of the things that we feel need 
to be said...

Thanks and props to all of _you_ who came out ready to go for it 
despite the inclement weather conditions (which in some ways worked out 
beautifully; did anyone get a really long look at the suspended 
raindrops in the cone of the laser?) and the relentless hassle by bored 
King County police.  All of us who worked the party were really glad to 
be there handling the little details whilst all of the rest of you 
cooked up a phaaat vibe.  Hope that everyone got a chance to hang out 
around one of the bonfires (especially on the beach) and talk with 
someone they'd never met before.

I'd say that there are definitely more outside events in store for all 
of us, and once the weather becomes reliably nice...<whew>...

Peace!  And Love to you all...

Rhythm&BASS!

SOMEBODY EMOTED THIS EMAIL ELECTRONICALLY:
Indeed, I agree, and always try to give people the benefit of the doubt
that they may have a disability that is not apparent. But there *may* be
way too many people using Grandma's handicapped placard though she isn't
there, despite the possibility they may be asked to show the accompanying
card. I'm sorry you suffer and do not feel comfortable to use a placard,
as you are certainly entitled to it. Peace. Lady Trash



I understand handicapped placards can also be bought for approx 50 dollars
at flea markets, if you snoop around enough.  I read this in I believe the
Chronicle months ago.

FLAMER DISCLAIMER: however this is no slag on the raver who had one
legitimately.  Just the facts, maam.

I too, have always hated clowns.  Maybe it's our generation.  I hate
Disney shit too.  I used to dread when the circus came to town because I
hate those too and I never told my parents (one of those weird kid things)
and so my week-end dad would always see it as a bonding oppurtunity and
think we'd be way pshyched to go so he'd take us.  It's funny when you 
look back and wonder why you just didn't say "No, I don't want to go, I
hate the fuckin circus".

OB rave, seems like we should somehow try to spread the word and notify
the community about this crackdown shit.  Too bad we there aren't more
promoters on-line.  They'd have easier communicatin access to each other
and could get important news like this.

Prozactacoatl and Co:

I went to the bandshell for the into the light ravelet last Sat for a few
minutes. The mix was pleasant but too bad about the dust; at any rate a
wunnerful way to spend a Sat afternoon.  

I was curious about my own peripheral participation at the event, that is:
some artwork of mine was printed in the Whole Earth Review and I have
hundreds of comp copies to give away.  I brought ten to the lit table at the
bandshell, and put them down.  Before they hit the table 4 or 5 inquiring
types grabbed e each (after hearing the magic word FREE). I had to leave
soon, and there were still a couple on the table when I left.

So my question is, did getting a magazine like the WER free make their day?
Or were they just discarded later? To me it would seem like free stuff at a
free event is in keeping with the general vibe.  

On a vaguely related note, are there ra scene fanzines that are not A) gig
listings or B) glossy 5 dollar fashion/nightlife coverage?  like for
instance, xeroxed or color artwork and writing like one would find in most
fanzines.  It would seem with the graphics available via ftp and the ones
used on all those handbills such a thing would exist. The only zine I have
seen like that would be Jason Koehn's "The Imaginal Rave", but he only did
one and then moved away. (It had an orange cover with a woman dancing on top
of a swirl, the inside was a rant positing raves as potential
mind-liberating Dionysian revels of good cheer, etc, etc.) Does anyone
indulge in computer graphics outside of making advertisements?


Yr time and consideration ti this matter would be greatly appreciated :)

actually, there's lots of promoters online, and subscribed to SFRaves.  
There are also plenty of folks who have a close association with the major
promoters on the list, too.  The people who *really* need to get notified
are the clubowners (i don't think any are on...could be wrong), and most
importantly, Josh and Jen Q. Raver.  We have a fairly representative sample
on the list, but not hardly the bulk of the SF Rave Nation.

Hello everyone,

(I had posted a similar message before, but I don't think it got through for
whatever reason... in any case, sorry if you ended up with double messages...)

My questions aren't related to the SF scene exactly but I have a few
rave-related questions.  One, has anyone heard of how Circa 94 is going to be
here in LA?  It sounds pretty big, but wondered if anyone knew more about it up
there in SF.  I heard some DJ's from SF were going to play.  

Also, does anyone know of a mailing list similar to SFRAVES that serves the LA
area? it's awful hard to find out about events down here... maybe i'm just not
looking in the right place... thanks for your help...

Well, the Chronicle is 99% garbage anyway. The fact is, CA has for some 
reason decided that it's more important to crack down on illegal placards 
than it is to arrest rapists, child molesters, etc. This does *NOT* mean 
I condone illegal use of disabled parking! I have "keyed" many a car 
owned by callous jerks who abused these spots.
I'm sure that "black" market placards are out there (seeing as you can 
get a *green card* so easily [supposedly]) but I don't believe them to be 
nearly the problem the news would have you believe.

Any way, let's move on to more fruitful topics-- like, let's talk about 
making sure our parties are fully accessible, and other productive things.

One thing that has definitely kept me from going to events is knowing I 
won't be able to *sit down* near the main area. Who wants to be limited 
to the chill-out room?
I would like for all of us that give/assist parties to try to remember to 
bring some kind of thing for people to sit on-- even if it is just a old  
comforter or whatever. It would encourage more folks to come out. :)

Okay, 'nuff said by me....

Peace!

Maui

It should be pretty big. I am down in LA as well.
Study constraints are keeping me home, but it should be a good event -

hiya all...i am in dc again for vacation! and have been partying my tush off..
(in fact what is sleep? crunch maybe you can explain (: ) as you guys know i
run the dcraves list *dcraves@american.edu* (shameless plug) and the net-ravers
have a nice little scene going on here...

on thursday night, lonnie (ultraworld) my favorite promoter in the *world*
held a party called "rave the bay" (a take off on save the bay) on a boat in 
baltimore harbor all night long...3 decks of music...first floor was breaks
(with our fellow netraver dieselboy) and some trance...second floor wink with some get this housey stuff (house in the east coast...i can't explain it either)
and some ambient/acidjazz/jazz on the top deck...

 needless to say it was amazing to dance the sun up on a boat...and they netraver posse was in full effect...about 20 or so...free lays were given out as we got on the boat (and as dan said "gee i never got laid on a boat" har har)
and after lonnie handed out neato bumper stickers...it was really good to see
the happening scene in dc after reading about hoaxes like pleasuer dome and
the tripotronic parties....

tonight we have rented speakers and are holding a renegade somewhere (hey location to be announced (: ) and people are driving in from phili and stuff...
*3-8 hour drives are nothing for ne-ravers to go to a party*

so i am having a fantastic time...(but i will be home soon)

partyon...susie(:

Okay, it's June, so it is far enough into 1994 for.....

Your Top 3 of 1994 So Far !

This can be either singles or albums.

AND, I'd also like to see you add your "Three Most Heard in 1994 So Far".

This is the three tracks that you have heard most often in 1994, whether
they be good or bad.   This does NOT include anything YOU have played,
whether at home or as a DJ.

Top 3:

        "Plainsong (Sine Bubble Embossed Dub)" - Seefeel [Too Pure, UK]
	"Trancition (Mongolian 303 Heaven)" - Choci and the 
		Freedom of Sound [Aura, UK]
	"Harlequin" - Avalon [IND, USA]

Of these three, only Seefeel is readily available, try their CD
_Quique_ for a My-Bloody-Valentine-meets-This-Mortal-Coil-meets
Brian-Eno experience.

Most Heard 3:

	Ummm, I can't think of anything because I either don't
	go out that much or I haven't heard much that sticks in
	my head except for things I've liked enough to buy and
	spin out or play at home, which disqualifies them from 
	this category.  :-)

>get this housey stuff (house in the east coast...i can't explain it either)

yes susie, house on the east coast.  In fact, I guess you missed the
mini-flame war on ne-raves when people were complaining that there's too
much house being played at raves.

Funny too because I was just reading an article in the June issue of Urb
called, "House of the Rising Sons" which I think accurately summarized our
scene.  Some quotes, "New York, the city where club culture was created,
where the concept of the DJ was first born..." (Bart Blackstone:
blkstone@netcom.com)  "In New York, it's just house, and it's pure deep
house.  Or if it's going to be techno, it's gotta be extremely hard, angry
techno" (Digit EFX says).  But that's New York and you were talking about
DC but you did generalize to the whole east coast.

More common on the rave scene these days is hard house, tribal house &
progressive house than deep house.  That's reserved more for the clubs.
Shall I take you to some when you're here???

:)

A tough call on the top 3, so I'll just pick 'em and toss in a few
more. These are all late 1993 or 1994 releases as far as I know
(it's not always easy to tell!) . . .

  Eastmen - U Dig (Tribal America)
  Graylock - Rising Horizon (Mental Radio)
  Deep Freeze Productions - Feeling Dub (Sure Shot)

Also . . . Capricorn - Hara Kiri (Global Cuts) . . . Boiling Point - I Am
(Nice'n'Ripe) . . . Pluto - Plutobeat EP (Plink Plonk) . . . Rachid Taha -
Voila Voila (Barclay) . . . Luv Tribe - All Things Nice (Hubba Hubba) . . .
and excellent compilation sets from Twitch, Experimental, Toronto
Underground and Moonshine . . .

Most often heard tracks:

  Dub Tribe - Mother Earth 
  Shi-Take - Don't Look Back in Anger
  Hysterix/Sasha - Talk To Me  (really a 1993 track but the
    Deconstruction re-release b/w Must Be the Music is *everywhere* --
    Talk To Me is 'the DJ's Friend' :-)

We were at the Hempfest today and got this flyer from Galen:

Pacific Soundsystem presents:  SUNSET

This is basically Galen's sunset party featuring his new soundsystem,
which will be at the Berkeley Marina pretty much every Sunday from
now on, he said.  Except for Sunday the 12th...confused?  Call:
415-985-5264.  Oh yes, it goes from 2pm to sunset.  

It's a beautiful place for a party, if a little bit windy sometimes.  You
get a great veiw of SF and the bridge.  

Sorry if this is already on the calendar:  Ananda (a state of spiritual
bliss) is Friday, June 10.  Also a free outdoor party!  # = 415-267-6168.

Seeyou!

Well, you're right, I did word it that way...

What I meant was -- don't include any of the times YOU've played it in
the total quantity.  IE if you've heard it once at a club, and you've
played it two hundred times at home, that doesn't make it the winner :-) .
However, if you've heard it at every party so far this year, it's not
disqualified by also being played at your home...

It's been a week since WILL-E and I visited San Francisco for two wonderful

the background :)

I want to say that the people I met there, mostly sfravers and their
friends, were amongst the warmest people I've met!   The parties we went to
(Blue Cube, Test 2, Launchpad, In the Light) were excellent, with a nice
vibe running throughout and a lot of people dedicated to happiness and
dancing.  We were made to feel very welcome.

Special thanks to Laura for putting up with us the longest and playing some
of my favorite records :)  and to Bryce & Ethan for so clearly illustrating
the proper intentions to have when throwing a party.  And to everyone else
for the good vibe and making me want to come back so much !!

yes it is time again for susie's annual ravers voting guide...

the election is from 7 am to 8 pm on june 7th

here are some interesting issues in san francisco to think about...
 
prop d "Shall the city be required to employ a minimum of 1.971 full duty 
police officers, with an emphasis on assigning officers to neighborhood 
policing an patrol?"

personally, i don't remember how i voted on this issue (absentee) but i 
just wanted to remind people that it is the police who break up our 
parties...and who knows maybe a community based officer would be nicer????

prop i "Shall the City be required to take all actions necessary to 
extend BART services into the Airport terminal area, and shall the 
Airports Commission be required to  take all apporpriate actions to 
generate the revenue necessary for this BARt extension, which shall 
include using any available Airport, regional, state, and federal funds, 
and if necessary, adopting a passenger facility charge, if approved by 
the federal government?"

personally, i say vote YES on this issue so all those ne-ravers who come 
out here don't have to ask cindy and laura for rides all the time (:

just a few thoughts...susie (:

The 2 events: "INDONESIA" and the other "FUNDAMENTAL" are both scheduled for

i just wanted to say that this party stuff is genetic...

taken from the san francisco voters guide...

"B.Y.O.B" (Bring Your Own Ballot)

     There's an election coming up soon, so it must be PARTY TIME! PAUL 
KAMENY [yup that is my DAD!], a San Franciscan voter wrote and suggested 
that voters organize "Sample Ballot Parties."  I have heard about such 
gatherings for years and when Mr. Kameny came up with the suggestion of 
promoting these ballot parties throughout the city, I thought it was a 
great idea.  The party is an opportunity for everyone to learn about 
issues and/or candidates.  

1.  People invited to the party may be assigned a candidate or ballot 
measure to "become the expert on that subject."
2.  Each person brings there state and city voter information 
pamphlet/sample ballot to a gathering spot-someone's home, a neighborhodd 
church, a community center, or any place you name.
3.  While you eat, drink and socialize, either pot luck or compliments of 
the host, a moderator is chosen and everyone takes turns leading the 
discussion on a candidate or measure.
4.  The party may be nonpartisan or partisan, depending on the people you 
invite.
5.  Some parties only cover ballot measures, others concentrate on 
candidates, but many review both candidates and measures.
6.  No one needs to disclose how they will vote.

    I hope some of you organize "Sample Ballot Parties."  Let us know if 
you find your party as informative and fun as it has been for others who 
have attened past parties.  

     Your vote counts only if you cast your ballot,

                                           Germaine Q Wong
                                           Registrar of Voters

Actually my dad wrote a better blurb than this one but that is the jist 
of the idea...and don't forget to vote on june 7th.....
partyon...susie (:

Japan really isn't good at "one offs" in large warehouse type spaces because
all spaces are in use 24 hours per day.

Osaka is the hippest city with the widest underground dance scene however
Tokyo has the Cave- which has at least one night per week where trance
djs spin till dawn. The Cave club is in Shibuya district across from the
Bunkamura hall- at the top of the hill of the shops bordering on the 
hotel area. Most club listings have the Caves address.

Also check out the San Ni Pa club at 328 Roppongi Dori near Roppongi-
get off the Hibiya line at Roppongi Station, walk from the Almond landmark
store past the Wave record store and keep going- at 328 is a set of stairs
going downwards. Also in this district is club Yellow which has good
dance music.

Check out TKO Tokyo Knockout magazine for more listings of clubs

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Well, I finally made it to an event in Portland that satisfied me
pretty thoroughly.  Natural High was held at the Roseland Theater,
which used to be a holy-roller temple until the early 1980s (it had
a 'Jesus Light of the World' sign on top of it like Gene Scott's
Church of the Open Door in LA), then it was Starry Night for a long
time (because of the previous management we used to call it the
Scary Fright).  Mostly it's a place for local metal and 'rock' bands
and touring groups of all kinds.  The last thing I saw there, in fact,
was Ken Kesey's traveling 'Twister' roadshow about ten days ago.  I've
seen all kinds of bands there over the years, from King Sunny Ade to
Gang of Four to Graham Parker to Fishbone.  Never thought of it as a
potential 'rave' site although it's apparently been the location for
a couple of parties in the past.  Anyway, it was quite an interesting
contrast!  

The Roseland is the upstairs part of a two-storey building downtown,
about six blocks from my office.  It's got a square shape inside, with
a big dance area and a balcony that wraps around on three sides, with
the stage on the fourth.  The sound system was basically the house's,
and it took a while for the sound guys to figure out how to EQ the
place for this kind of music, but when they did it was GOOD, though Buck
had to suffer through the worst of it and told me it sounded 'boomy'
up on stage where the mixer was.  I think this would be the KILLER place
for great sound if they could set up a quad, and I said as much to the
sound crew.  

I arrived right before 2 and unfortunately caught just the end of Taylor
playing, which is too bad because I've never heard his stuff and thought
he would be playing later.

Buck set up using a reel-to-reel deck (like at Launch Pad) but used it
only sparingly.  When you're set up on a stage things bounce, and in
this case the needles were noticeably bouncey whenever anyone stepped
on one of the loose boards.  I thought the second half of Buck's set
was really top notch.  Spun came on and did the *best* I've ever heard
him do -- his techniques are greatly improved from months ago (he's
always had great records).  I was out kickin' the dust on the dance
floor most of the night, which is not all that common for me.  The
message from the turntables was 'SF Funk, loud and clear' for both
Buck and Spun's sets.  Really good stuff.  Local DJ Mike Stevens 
followed with a very fine trance-y set, closing with the Delta Lady
track 'Anything You Want' which is a favorite.  Pasta finished off
with a good trance/house mixture.

I continue to be amazed at the skill and variety shown by the DJs 
on the west coast.  While we stick to our lower BPMs, there was a wide
range of music covered and it was well done all the way through.

The crowd was typical for Portland, very low key but not comatose, and
even a little vibey near the end which was kind of neat.  I think
attendance peaked around 400, and at least 100 were around at the end
around 7:30 (another unusual thing for Portland, where events often
shut down at 4:30 am as recently as last fall).

I did see Jess but didn't find you Vancouverites!  Sorry about that.
I was wearing my set of tags for the first time in quite a while,
complete with the nw-raves one.

After last year's optimistic start to summer with the awesome Get Down
Get Down Get Down Get Wicked at the Sonoma fairgrounds on Memorial Day,
things really went downhill for a while.  But I'm more hopeful about
this summer, not the least because a *really good* event was held within
walking distance (for a change!).

see you in the future

Get any of the "Cream of Undergound House" CDs.  There are three in the series
so far, and all of them are pretty good.

Passing this on...Your assignment, should you choose to accept it ....  ;-)

Hello folks.  An interesting peroject has come my way that I believe is of
interest to all Bay Area Internet folks - both experienced and curious.

A new resteraunt has opened in San Francisco, on the con\rner of 9th Street
and Folsom (where the Limbo and Billboard used to be).  This resteraunt, the
"ICON Byte Bar & Grill" is run by Joegh Bullock and Marcia Crosby, the main
folks behind the Climate Theatre.

When Marcia & Joegh came to me with the idea for this resteraunt a few months
ago, they described wanting to have a place that had a strong techno/cyber
feel to it and also *very comfortable* - a warm friendly place to eat really
good food, not a spiked-chrome-the-future-hurts place.

And they wanted to have Full Internet Access  in the resteraunt.

Well, months later and many strange events have pased, but it is a done deal
now and the place is open.

We have installed a dedicated Internmet connection (low speed -14.4K, but hey
it's a start :-) and a Macintosh running Mosaic etc.  This is all at a table
in the middle of the resteraunt and is available to customers to use.  At some
point there may be a rental fee for the keyboard, (like you leave your drivers
licsense at the bar and pay $6/hr or something) but at present it is part of
the meal :-)

I'm asking netheads and other curious people to come by and play with it - and
leave feedback.  There will be a notebook at the table to write stuff down,
and/or you can send me e-mail. (The resteraunt will have e-mail very soon:
icon@bytebar.com)

We have NCSA Telnet running so you can telnet anywhere in the world.

Sometimes the video gets routed to a video projector, so whatever you are doing
will be on the wall, 5 feet wide.

I'm working on a VERY BASIC and VERY READABLE cheat-sheet that wll be
laminated and hung by the table, saying things like "Please be patient - if
the little thing is spinning, don't click all over the place :-)".

We are building a home page that has pointers to cool stuff and we have a very
interesting "hotlist" installed.

And the food is really really good.

This is a interesting new opportunity to bring network communications into
everyday life, a little bit further.

So, y'all come by now.


ICON Byte Bar & Grill
299 9th Street (at Folsom)

 (in a week or so:  icon@bytebar.com   need time for the MX records to filter
out)

Anyone know who does that song with the Dead Can Dance fem. vocal sample
that I believe is from the song called something like "_________ of the
iconoclast" from "In the Realm of the Dying Sun"?  Sorry, I'm at work
and my memory of the song tittle is sketchy and I could be wrong about
the sample source to beging with.

Bonus points:  How many other songs can you think of that sample Dead Can
Dance?

Subject: Followup on police crackdown on south of market clubs...
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control reports that surprise
joint weekend inspections with San Francisco police at 12 South of
Market night clubs have resulted in numerous citations of club owners.

According to ABC Director Jay Stroh, on several occasions near riots
have broken out, forcing police to call in tactical teams to disperse
crowds. On May 7, a disturbance at the Sound Factory at 525 Harrison
St. took police 2 1/2 hours to quell.

In a statement, Stroh called the situation ``out of control,'' adding
that it is impossible to prevent these clubs from serving alcohol to
minors or control the use of illegal drugs and the overcrowding that
sets the stage for a potential catastrophe.

On Friday and Saturday nights, ABC and San Francisco police visited
the Sound Factory, the Oasis, DV8, De Ja Vu, City Limits, 1015 Club,
Club Q, Pioneer, Paradise, City Nights, DNA and the Holy Cow.

A total of 28 arrests were made for violations involving minors in
public premises, minors drinking alcohol, public drunkeness, marijuana
possession, possession of a concealed weapon, resisting arrest and
assault on a peace officer.

Like the illegal ``rave'' clubs of Southern California, the South of
Market clubs charge entry fees and pack as many patrons inside as
possible, the statement said.

The clubs' setup makes enforcement or undercover operation difficult,
ABC reports, because of sophisticated security systems, with personnel
equipped with two-way radios and headphones.  Some clubs use metal
detectors.

On several occasions, ABC investigators trying to conduct a ``walk
through'' at a club were stalled by security personnel asking repeated
questions about the investigator's identity and purpose.
Investigators believe this was a delaying tactic while security guards
talked to those inside by radio, allowing them conceal anything
illegal, according to ABC.

[I believe here the police are more of a problem than the clubs ever
were. Reminds me of the recent Oakland "riot" which wasn't a riot
until the police showed up and started throwing their weight around.
Oakland police Capt. Michael Myers said ``later in the evening the
regular family people leave and you get the thugs showing up around 4
p.m.''  Call your representative and tell them your vote will go for
the candidate that works for real positive change and not one who
supports policemen who view people as "thugs". -Sean]

Now... i REALLY do like to give police and other power people the
benefit of the doubt and try to see stuff from their position
but whoever is being cited is being slighlty biased in presenting
metal detectors as means for keeping undercover police out..

yeah. right.

Ummm.. Yeah. Again. I imagine the police would wonder why people
would hassle them. but there's so muhc bullshit thrown around in clubs
that i would be suspicious of anyone trying to walk in
threatening to shut it down..

where was this from?

I don't know why they're called that since they're mostly prog house, but I
highly recommend them.  The ones before weren't so good but these redeem
themselves.  Most of the tracks on each of them had just come out on 12"
when the comp was released.

Hay Ya!!!!

I went to Wicked, and although it was disappointing in many respects, i.e.,
the sound system,  little or no lighting or visual effects,  no bar (because
of the 18 over crowd)   I,  nevertheless,  managed to have another great
magical time.

 It seemed  that many of the Wicked regulars stayed away. I don't know if
they didn't wish to mingle with the teeners or what,  but the core Wicked
group, and the vibe they generate was't there.  Maybe they didn't want to get
coodies.

It's interesting that relativity is an absolute. By that I mean,
you don't know how good something was until it gets bad. No, I'm not talking
about love affairs, I'm talking about the sound system.

Rumor had it that the Wicked Posse didn't check the sound system before they
fired it up. That Jeno wanted to stop the music and put in a another mixer. I
imagine that would have been too much of a breach of rave protocal, anyway
the sound wasn't very alive. Highs and lows sounded homogenized, or a
 critical view would be it lacked crisp, clear definition, or
in other words, IT SUCKED.  "There's no place like Townsend, There's no place
like Townsend." Just click you heels together
and keep chanting that. But, to all the people I danced with and around, rox,
kenneth p. kristine, & teddy, you saved the evening!! Oh!! Thomas did stop
the music at 6:30 and kicked out the last set. Thomas; the anchor man, the go
to guy, closing another one out. Thanks, and kudos to him.

I talked to Preston a little, and bemoaned the loss of Light N Up. Now where
was I going to spend my hard earned after party dollars?

I was fortunate that Teddy and Kristine suggested the Sunset party at the
Berkeley Marina. Just the view across the bay was enough to get you off. I
understand they used to have they speakers turned north, so the wind would
blow the needle around, and blow the sound back toward the water.

Turning them up at the hill was the ticket. It was a beautiful day, and that
mellow summer vibe was starting to creep out of people's pores. The smell of
some roasting burgers or weenies would have done it.  Janie was bouncey and
bubbly enough to conjure up the summer spirits.

Thanks to John Howard for the nice outdoors set. It was fun dancing with
friends, and being able to see them.

We left about 8:00ish, but before we left everybody seemed to get the same
idea, to go to the top of the hill, and dancing together in the "remains of
the day." I looked like the closing scenes of Ingmar Bergman's SEVENTH SEAL,
where all the medieval peasants and serfs are dancing along the fortress
walls as blackened silhouettes. What a sight!!!

So, I give the Wicked party a 5 out of 10, and hope it serves as a
professional wake up call to the posse. No flame, just it's easy to become
complacent, and fly by the proverbial seat of your nickers.  Somebody told me
they were going to stop going to Martin's parties because they were dark and
beginning to feel depressing. I guess it begs the question: "Whose party is
it anyway?" The promoter's or the party goers? I thinks it's how parties can
begin to lose their center, and begin to fall apart.

Definite thumbs up to Sunset and the Sunday Dj's. Let's make it better by
having more people show up, and doing some serious outdoor trance dancing.
 (don't forget to bring goodies) Thanks SF.

Ah, yes. A shameles plug will follow:

I just started doing the late night 2am-7am lighting shift at 177 
Townsend for Pump, promoted by Dave Peterson, for all you promo types ;)
Immediately when I walked ( OK , I crutched...) in, I commented on the 
warm, cozy feel in the club. In Townsend, you say? Indeed. Dave of 
Hyperdelic Video had a large screen hung between the bar and dance area, 
with two smaller screens on the walls on either side, making for a nice, 
colorful separation of the club. The sound system sounded GREAT  - kudos 
to John and Michael Krische,the latter of Terminator fame. DJ's are Pete 
Avila, Neon Leon, Swing Kid, Aaron O., and Jan Cooley. Dave had belly 
dancers on the platforms, which I thought was rather fun. According to my 
friends who investigated the dance floor, it had a great mix of fun, 
looking-good men and women. Townsend is 21+, but didn't seem to be 
targeted by Frank's gang of thugs. We'd love your support, so come down, 
every saturday, doors at 10:30 and $10.00 cover. Thanks. ;^> Peace. Lady 
Trash
P.S. Look out for info on a joint Care*free/Rhythm party on Friday, June 
24th. Groove on :)

Hello Everyone,
	My name is Troy and I have been involved with so-cal raves
and the los angeles club scene for about three years.  I already know
many of you from so-cal raves and vrave.  I just got a 6 month co-op
position with IBM in san jose and, needless to say, I am very excited
to get involved with sfraves and the san francisco scene.
	I am anxious to meet some of the sfravers, and get to some
clubs in san francisco.  So, if anyone wants to further he 
trans-california community, and show an LA kid what SF
has to offer, let me know!  I'm planning on going out this weekend,
both friday and saturday nights.  I'd also like to hear about some
of your favorite clubs.  I like progressive house music, with trance
and funk elements.
	Hope to meet many of you soon!

-troy

Hey!

I'll be in the city as well for a short stint (end of June to beginning of
July) and am looking forward to hitting as many sights/clubs/raves as I
can handle. Any info sent to this Chicagoan will be _greatly_ appreciated.
The updated list of sf-events is looking quite inviting...

an excellent suggestion.  i hardly ever go out to "mainstream" parties
myself...they're just not my cup of tea, usually.  perhaps you might
suggest this to the list at large?

Call me old fashioned but I think if you're gonna charge 2000 people $15
you oughtta make damn sure you've set up and tested the sound system well
in advance. When I got there they were still pullin cable. That's what I
call a *rip off.* If you ask me they should of rebated at least 50% of what
they charged...

I'm sorry but is just *lame*. Wicked if you're listening: Get your shit
together. Where's this famous sound system we've been hearing about (and
financing) for 2 years?

2 of the last 3 times I've seen Jeno he's had his set *destroyed* by a
fucked up a sound system. In this case it's really too bad too, cos him and
Markie rolled some *sick* tribal trance. I would have loved to have *heard*

	At a couple of events we've done here in Salt Lake City, we've had
couches and other chair-like things (beanbags, etc.) by the side of
the main dance area, but we found that it didn't work out very well. 
The reason why is because people will all be dancing, then some will
get tired and sit down, and those people sitting down will sort of
mentally drain the energy from the people still dancing.  I don't
know exactly how this happens, but it seems that it isn't as easy to
dance all night in front of people that are watching you like an
audience.  If everyone is grooving together, it's much better, but
when the crowd is split and half are sitting down and half are
dancing it doesn't work out.  Just my 2 cents.

>>> Maui-Your Sister's House <ysh@netcom.com>  6/3/94, 08:07pm >>>

One thing that has definitely kept me from going to events is knowing
I  won't be able to *sit down* near the main area. Who wants to be
limited  to the chill-out room?
I would like for all of us that give/assist parties to try to
remember to  bring some kind of thing for people to sit on-- even if
it is just a old   comforter or whatever. It would encourage more
folks to come out. :)

Okay, 'nuff said by me....

Peace!

	The song you're talking about is the classic (1992, that's old for
us young'uns...:) "Papau New Guinea" by the Future Sound of London. 
As for other Dead can Dance samplers, I've heard one ambient song
that sampled an entire 2 bar phrase from Dead can Dance and looped it
over and over to a simple drum-beat.  I can't recall the name of the
song, but this is a classic example of a Vanilla-Lice rip-off artist
in action.  Anyone can make good techno or house music if they steal
it from someone else... Papau New Guinea is a great song because they
simply took bits and pieces of a vocal sample and rearranged them in
a unique and creative way.
	While we're on the topic of Future Sound of London, be sure to keep
an eye out for their new album "LifeForms".  2 CD album for the price
of 1!  If you're into ambient music, this stuff will rock your
world... (yeah! rock on dude!!! :)

Anyone know who does that song with the Dead Can Dance fem. vocal
sample that I believe is from the song called something like
"_________ of the iconoclast" from "In the Realm of the Dying Sun"? 
Sorry, I'm at work and my memory of the song tittle is sketchy and I
could be wrong about the sample source to beging with.

Bonus points:  How many other songs can you think of that sample Dead

	This a bit from an e-mail letter I sent a friend...
	Please excuse the bit of hyperbole ;-)

        Forgot to tell you about the most amazing, stupendous,
        horrendous event we went to Sat. before last.  Yes, it was
        A CALCULATED FORCAST OF ULTIMATE DOOM!  Sickening Episodes
        of Widespread Devastation Accompanied by Sensations of
        Pleasurable Excitement.  In other words, a Survival Research
        Labs event!  It WAS truly amazing!  It was held in this abandoned
        steel fabricating building about 500 feet long and 80 feet wide
        and 60 feet high.  These nuts had built about 30 machines, some
        as big as bulldozers with huge metal grippers, spikes, rippers
        etc.  They built sonic cannon things that made huge concussions
        and screaming engine sounds SO LOUD it sounded like your head
        was stuck in a jet engine!  There was this one machine that looked
        like a huge jet engine that shot out flame about 6 feet in diameter
        in a HUGE blast.  It and all the other machines were under remote
        control and moved around on the concrete floor.  The flame cannon
        machine they had aimed against the back wall and it shot a jet
        of flame about 20 feet which hit the wall and spread out into
        a huge disk of flame about 20 feet in diameter.  At one point
        there was so much smoke inside the building and the heat from
        the flames so intense that people ran out the building to
        avoid getting their hair singed!  I can't tell you everyting
        they did but it was insane.  Barb wouldn't stay in there as
        she was too afraid of the one of machines going out of control
        and blasting the audience.  From outside (we could see in through
        huge open doors on the side of the building) we would hear blasts
        that were SO LOUD I couldn't believe the people inside could stand
        it!  In other words, IT WAS TOTALLY EXCELLENT!!!!  PS: they
        also had a huge clown head about 15 ft in diameter from the
        outside of a old amusement park that they had rigged on cables so
        they could move it up and down inside the building while huge
        machines torched it and whacked at it!  Now THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!

        Enuff for now!  See yah!

I don't know where to start...so I'll just do it.  That blurb about raves 
getting busted for drugs the other day, my dad has been in on it :)  He 
works for the ABC and he has been involved in the arrest of some dealers  
at raves.  He mentioned that this will be going on for about another  
month.  so I guess this is just a warning to everyone on the net that  
buys, sells or takes that he and the rest of the force wil be out to 
get all those bad people who sell.  I am totally serious when I 
say this so don't think I'm playing head games, and don't flame me 
either.  I don't exactly appreciate my dad busting the places I want to 
go.  This will be an interesting summer to see if the parents will 
approve of my visits to the city.  Oh boy, I can hardly wait.
L8r,
Brian

Well after last weekend's SFPD and the ABC's action against SOMA, I've been
talking to some informed folks, (club managers etc.) about the ultimate goal of 
such action and most feel it's a prelude to a request by both agencies that 
afterhour action be ended in San Francisco. SF is one of the few cities in
the country
that allow people to stay in clubs past 2am. There have been several
comments by 
the ABC official in the press about how the clubs can't control drug use and 
afterhour drinking in the clubs, and the SFPD Southern station Liet. Hallisy 
is quoted in the Independent saying "It's a place for gangs to cruise and kids
from out of town to come and stay up all night. Booze, drugs, and being out all
night add up to violence."  There's a good chance this propaganda is
leading up to 
action to shutdown clubs at 2:00 am.

howdy all,

not to sound parinoid but there's a real election coming up.  any
incumbents pushing this kind of movment, another "get though on crime" by
going after nonvoilent crimes of consent thing

keep your ears open, and those people with special access to people who
would know find out what is going on.

it also could be merely timed with the begining of summer break for the
underage types.  force the clubs to be extra tight for the rest of the
summer.  does anyone know if this is a cyclical pratice?

I would like to see if the police have any direct proof that people who 
leave clubs late engage in street violence, like " They left 1015 and 
help up a store" I have never seen any violence at a rave, but 
unfortunately they are lumped in with all late night events. I always 
thought it wise to let clubs stay open after 2am so the people can dance 
off their buzz, esp. alcohol, and leave safely. I realize that there have 
been some problems at some clubs. I guess once again the sins of a few 
will be paid for by the many. Not trying to flame, just dissing the police.
Let's hope we can keep cabaret licenses. In the mean time, I suggest we 
all be extra cautious at all times...

Possible point of interest? We used to have punk shows at the space 
Wicked was in , in about 1986. I can remember seeing MDC, Verbal Abuse, 
and Token Entry there. I think skinhead violence may have ended it's use, 
but don't quote me on that. Talk about people drinking and then going out 
and being violent... The old daze so often seem better when reflected 
upon than they probably actually were. ;^) Enjoying Today. Lady T.

Huh? I thought that leaving the Chicago clubs at 5am (legally) was still too
early...

Sheesh. What would 24 hour clubs mean? 24 hour violence?

I support what the cops are doing right now with the SOMA clubs. 
I have seen the violence in these clubs and it should be stop. Here are
some of the incidents that I saw:   

While in line, someone drives by and shoots a gun in the air, and everyone
falls to the ground.  No cops in sight and they do it again. (Galleria)

One guy gets beat up inside the club, the security kicks them out and
the guy gets beat up again.  No cops in sight and the guy on the ground
is bleeding while the security just watches.  (1015 Folsom)

Five guys jump on 2 guys.  The 2 guys are knock out with bottles.  Another guy
try to help and he also gets knock out.  Security guards are scared, so they
watch.  Also no cops. (Galleria)

3 guys calls another 2 guys fags.  The so-called fags talk back and they get
beat up. (Outside DNA Lounge) 

My friend's friend is parking his car, someone approaches him with a gun
demanding to get out of his car, he says no and then gets shot. RIP :-(
(Sound Factory)
 
3 of my friends's cars are broken into.  Broke $400 windows just to get
some sunglasses and shirts. (DV8)

Remember these all happened in SOMA nightclubs, not raves.  The cops are
there to also protect us.

When I was living in Austin, TX, clubs would stay open all night.  They'd
be required to close the bar during certain hours, but the premesis would 
stay open and the DJs would keep playing dance music all night . . . people 
would stay around until noon the next day.

In Chicago, I've gone to clubs that had live bands, and the headliners
wouldn't even come on until about 2am or so (to be specific, I'm 
thinking of a Pop Will Eat Itself show at the Caberet Metro).

New York City clubs close at 4am, not 2am.  They've had after-hours
problems lately, too, though.  It's funny that the NYC and SF after-hours
problems have "cropped up" at the same time that house/rave culture has
left the warehouses and moved into the clubs.

>the ABC official in the press about how the clubs can't control drug use and 
>afterhour drinking in the clubs, 

They can control afterhour drinking by totally closing the bar down 100%,
and having the last call being at like 1:15 or 1:30 if the drinking needs
to be over and done with by 2:00 am.  That's what they did in Austin.  If 
there is no way for people in the club to get the booze after hours, then 
there is no way there can be after-hours drinking then, eh?

As for the drug problem . . . I find it amusing that during the big
cocaine days of the 80's nightlife and clublife-all-night flourished,
but now that people are doing other things the police in places like
New York and San Francisco are getting all worried.  Back in the 80's
when doctors and lawyers were doing coke in clubs no one really cared,
but now that "crufty raver types" are taking those "nasty psychedelics"
then "it must be stopped."

Two-faced law-enforcement agencies.  Bah.

Agreed.  In fact, I would love it if the cops would come by and check out
parties every now and then, if they do it right.  In the same vein, I
feel better for some reason when the cops come to a renegade party, 
check it out, and leave, than if they never come at all.  A good example
was witnessed Sat. night at Wicked - there were a couple cops (both
uniformed and plainclothes) outside the door that night, just making sure
things were cool while people were waiting in line, but they weren't 
doing anything intrusive at all.  In fact one cop was seen laughing 
for minutes after he was hugged by a girl out of the blue, setting off his 
radio transceiver.

However, the flip side of the coin is that police cheifs and politicians
aren't interested in distinguishing between "good parties" and "bad
parties".  As we've seen, they consider all organized activity after
2am to be a contributing factor to violence and disorderliness.  This
is the problem.

A slight distortion... :) 

What really happened is that the woman in question was wearing a modern
rave interpretation of the clasic handshake buzzer device. This one hung
from the neck on a cord and had a large, rubberized, bubble-shaped buzzer.
So when she hugged the cop, he got a good buzz !-) and staggered up the
street laughing hysterically. What a sight.

	No, it isn't God Within.  I love that EP, a classic example of a
great dance song that makes you think on a higher level than just
dancing your ass off.  Props to the Hardkiss brothers (and Jon D) for
making that great song.  The song I'm thinking about is on the
Galaxies: Excursions in Ambience compilation, and it's fairly close
to the end if I remember right.  As a side note, that compilation is
pretty good, especially the track created by Eric McCormick, a friend
of mine from Denver (his track is called Aion - Flux).

You're probably thinking of the God Within 12" on Hardkiss Records.
That track is fairly yawn-inducing.

	Why don't you wake up, "dude."  Miles posted his simple opinion, and
even mentioned "IMHO", meaning that it was his humble opinion, and
not fact.  You outright flamed him for no reason.  If you'll notice
Miles' address is in the UK.  I don't know if you're aware of what
events are going on over there right now, but the government is
attempting to make it illegal for any group of people to gather if
they are throwing a "rave", or planning a "rave."  With all the
negative publicity that's been spoon-fed to the American public by
the government-controlled media in our country, I could easily see
the same type of law being passed over here in a few years.  There's
no way that our house/rave community is big enough for us to just say
"ravers unite and start a revolution," but in the UK, it possibly is.
Just because you live in SF doesn't mean you're in the center of the
world's cultural community.  Almost every aspect of rave culture that
is dominant in America came from the UK, and we have a lot to learn
from their successes and failures.
	Hearing someone else's opinion, no matter how stupid, isn't going to
hurt you one bit, and it might actually help you.  Why don't we
espouse a little more of the values we claim to, rather than jumping
down somebody else's throat whenever they say something out of the
ordinary.  I don't mean to be rude to you personally, Brian, it just
bothers me when people get flamed for no reason.  They might actually
have something good to say, but after being flamed once or twice like
that, who knows if they'll ever post again?

Peace,
Luke

ok, I fucked up.  Several people have made it clear to me that I

that it  was something said without cause too.  Sure the govt. can 
oppress, but so does society.  I thought that it was a hollow statement

Two of my ex-roommates were bartenders for DV8, Crazy Eights and 
Sound Factory (free booze *chuckle*) and once two am hit, they and the 
other staff would always go around pulling cups right out of people's 
hands. Rude, yes, but noone I knew at any of the 'publicly-accessible' 
clubs would have been crazy enough to risk their jobs and substantial 
fines by selling alcohol after 2. The catch is: its not illegal to DRINK 
alcohol in a bar after 2 a.m. It's only illegal to SELL it after 2 a.m. 
The cops instantly assume any alcohol in a club was sold by the club and 
thus have the meat for a trumped-up sweep of every SOMA bar listed in the 
Guardian.

This action is total crap as they obviously plan to do nothing else but 
harrass people and make the pissed-off element even more pissed-off. When 
that anger turns violent, as it always does, they're conveniently 
elsewhere (usually busily writing parking tickets). The bigger clubs here 
are crime-ridden (I've got an inch-long scar under my eye thanks to 
SoundFactory), but this little show-of-force is only going to make it 
worse in the long run.

There's obviously an ulterior motive involved...

	something that would seem not to support the sfpd/abc

	at the division/townsend/8th street traffic circle, kitty-
	corner from the fashion centre.  it has dj's spinning and
	alcohol and intellabeams and a regular following, they 
	shut down at two am.  each and every night that club
	happens, sfpd has to completely shut down the block of
	henry adams street (also known as kansas street btw) and
	often their presence is in semi-riot gear.  they seem to

Because it blows away their theory that shutting everyone down at 2 will
solve the non-existent 'problem'.

Crime is, by definition, a conflict.  Police rampaging through a club
of happy party people creates conflict, and some percentage of that
may very well be crime.  "See?  People are doing bad stuff!  We've got
to stop it!"  Well, had you not goaded them, they might have gone on
happily partying, but now they're fearful and pissed off, and will react
badly.

Most crime can be traced back to the _imposition_ of law.  If we make more 
crimes, we make more criminals.  What proportion of these busts are for 
victimless crimes like drug (including alcohol) use, and what proportion
are for actual violation of another's rights?

This, Brian U., is why I'm an anarchist, but only as a byproduct of my
other beliefs.  I take responsibility for myself -- I do not expect
anyone else to rescue me from my stupidity -- but I enjoy the fruits
of free action -- I do not expect anyone else to stand in my way.
Well, there are many organizations around right now whose sole purpose
is to coerce your behavior by threat of force; they're called
governments, and have no other function.  I try to live up to my
responsibility, and am trying to find modes of life that do not depend
on these institutions that oppress us.  If you have a big
agglomeration of millions of people like SF that cannot support itself
(must import its food and export its waste), and that people must compete with
each other merely to get a roof over their heads, _of course_ you need
police, governments, big corporations, and other dominance-hierarchy
based organizations to keep it from disintegrating!
	If we don't change ourselves first, any revolution will be just that:
a full circle which returns us to our starting place.

Rant off.

As a followup to my short post yesterday, which, admittedly I fired off a
little hastily ( State oppression....) I ought to explain what's happening
in the UK.

At the end of last year our beloved Home Secretary announced that his
government would be launching a full-scale crakdown on "Ravers, Squatters and
travellers"

The Criminal Justice Bill now making its' way through parliament and due to
become law contains some of the following.....

- Clauses 47-50 make it a criminal offence to hold a party or rave without a
  licence (punishable by a prison sentence and/or 2500 pound fine).

- If a police officer 'believes' ten or more people are gathered making
  preparations for a rave or merely waiting for one to start the police can
  declare an exclusion zone of a mile in radius. Anyone remaining in the zone
  can face arrest and be punished by a prison sentence and/or 2500 pound fine

- Clause 61 removes the duty of local authorities to provide sites for
  travellers. (i.e. the homeless).

- Clauses 56-57 makes a squatter or homeless person a criminal if they do not
  leave their temporary home within 24 hrs of being served a possession order.

- Clause 54 makes it an offence for more than 20 people to gather on land of
  what the police believe to be of'historical, architectural or archaeological
  importance'.

- Clauses 52-53 make a new offence of criminal trespass which would make
  criminals of people demonstrating against the destruction of our environment
  such as obstructing a truck or digger. Punishable by prison sentence and/or
  2500 pound fine.


Part of the Crininal Justice Bill attempts to define dance music and to outlaw
the playing of it in the open air. It's definition.....

"SOUNDS WHOLLY OR PREDOMINANTLY CHARACTERISED BY THE EMISSION OF A
SUCCESSION OF REPETITIVE BEATS"

The police and government of the UK are determined that there will be NO MORE
raves in our country.

The last 'legal' raves here last year cost the organisers ten thousand pounds

 So I'll attempt to take my foot out of
my mouth and apologize with sincerity (sp?) to Miles.  Next time I'll
just keep my big mouth shut and lurk about.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry to use you as an example Brian, BUT, that's the kind of thing
(above) that everyone always does.  It wasn't your expressing your
opinion that everyone objected to, it was the method, the wording you
used.  By all means do not hold back if you strongly disagree with
someone, just respectfully explain your position, which you did in
the other part of the body of the above message.  That should have been
the way to word your disagreement in the first place, it was polite,
respectful, and made sense as a valid differing view as opposed to an
attack.  And again, don't ever feel that you shouldn't express yourself
here.  That is all.  Peace.

Police crackdowns - 
I was warned last weekend that it was a bad time to go
out because this was gonna happen.

The most reasonable idea I have heard was the "set the tone for summer"
explanation - where the police are making themselves very visible 
right now.

I don't think they are trying to scare the promoters.
That seems silly.

It would make more sense that they are just trying reduce the crime
by making it unhospitable for a bad element.  The police are never 
capable of true enforcement - their actions are usually more political.

Doesn't it make sense that the best use of their time would be a
coordinated (abc/cops) *highly* visible short term effort to make it
seem like a bad place for committing crimes.  It would be like
the sobriety check points which are 100% P.R. 

I don't believe this is an effort to stop the parties altogether.
I don't think it is similar to what is happening in England.

Anyway, this will unfortunately result in a few ridiculous/petty/unfair
busts because they have to do something besides hug people.             
Just be very careful (like you always should ...)

A mutual friend is looking for Amethyst, a guy who
knows me.  The only phone number I have for him in
the Haight has been disconnected.  If you know him
please ask him to contact me at the number below or
if he prefers would you act as an intermediary so I
can get the information to him?  Thanks!

I am looking for a new CPU for my system. I currently have a Hyundai 286.
I am wondering if any of you fellow geeks know of or work at a place 
where I could get good help, a good deal, and maybe even service. As 
well, if you have any suggestions as to what I should be looking for, 
feel free to give your 2cents. I am not the most computer literate 
person, but I understand the basics and then some. There are just so many 
dealers, and I don't want to go to a place that will try to blind me with 
computer lingo. ( Or would it be deafen me?) I just want something with 
more speed, some power under the hood, a good stereo, and a large trunk 
for storage, so I can cruise down this info highway at a nice, steady pace.
Please respond privately so I don't clutter all our mailboxes with 
non-rave items! THANKS!!!! Peace. Lady Trash (trash@netcom.com)

The new moon party and Ananda are both supposed to be free and outdoors,
with good DJs, so both should be great.  On Saturday, there's a lot of 
choice: ambient at King Street, a techno-leaning lineup at Indonesia,
and a house-leaning lineup at Fundamental.  Go whereever you like...

One word of warning: supposedly the SF Police are cracking down on
"violence at clubs" which means that they're going into South of 
Market clubs and looking anything they find illegal... so be careful
and be peaceful.

Subject: Followup on police crackdown on south of market clubs...
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU


>I support what the cops are doing right now with the SOMA clubs. 
>I have seen the violence in these clubs and it should be stop. Here are
>some of the incidents that I saw:   
<various incidents of bodily violence recounted here>

Well, I for one, do not wish to live in a situation where there are police
everywhere looking at everything you do to see if you've done something that
someone has written a law against (eg. it's illegal to pump your own gas in
Oregon). 

I personally do not think that cops are out there to protect you.  The only
way all these fights could be prevented is to have a cop everywhere all the
time.  Through my perception, cops are not out there to keep you from getting
hurt - they are here to ENFORCE the law.  There is a huge difference.  

In my opinion, when cops go and bust a lot of clubs to make splashy news, they
did it because their sergeant told them to.  And their sergeant told them to
because in some meeting with the sergeants, the commanding officer said, "let's
hit the clubs ... that's the word from the chief"  And the chief told them to
bust the clubs because he wants to further his career and the careers of his
superiors who want to show the public that, "You see, I'm doing something about
crime!"  Thus high profile club busts is politically motivated, in my 
opinion.  I mean it was the weekend before the local voting took place.
You can call that corruption or you can call it the way the system is
running these days or you can call it silly or you can disagree with me.

I believe that the ultimate responsibility for one's physical or mental safety
should rest with oneself.  You can lazily delegate it to a force which is 
quickly gaining more and more power in the last 2 decades and hope that they
don't overstep your bounds someday.  But for my sake puuhleeeeseee don't do 
that in the same town that I'm in cuz I'm for personal freedom.  Until a person
has a weapon such as a gun, s/he has only as much power as you allow him/her.
Note that all cops wear guns.  That's far too much already, in my opinion.

Don, if you don't want to witness all this violence, then I suggest you visit
other more peaceful house venues of which there are many.  Stay away from a
crowd sporting a macho vibe and I noticed that most of the venues you listed
are at places that have a large section of clientelle suscribing to the 
macho 'tude.  I personally haven't seen much violence this
year at all, I've seen a total of maybe 4 fights so far and I happened to be
right there in between the two contestants at one Bonny Doon fight and I kept
them apart and their fighting energy was dissipated. 

At Sunday's Spundaes on memorial day weekend, I saw a fight (one of the guys
seemed to be looking for anybody to fight with and he got a taker) and 
many people kinda stopped dancing and started rubbernecking.  My question was:
if 2 people are going to fight, why give them so much energy by giving them
your attention units?  I mean, there's also babies being born in the local
hospital, there's people are giving eachother love over there, there's so 
much other stuff to give your attention units to.

Here's my motto on violence:
Do not hate or fear violence - you will only bring it towards you, in a 
round-about "coincidental" fashion that fear and hate tend to do.   Instead, 
love peace.  

There are many subtle shades of delicate paranoia - don't get caught up with
them, unless you want to, of course.


Love, peace, acceptance, unity, forgiveness,

 Ooops - My recent post about the South Bay lunch was a mistake - I
was trying to recycle an old message and remailed it instead.

 What I really meant to say was ...

--------------------------------------

 Meet The Raver Baby!

 Next week Wednesday at the SFR South Bay lunch , the originator of
the Greer Park lunches will be bringing her 10 month old son to the
South Bay lunch in Greer Park. Elizabeth Mendel has been away from 
Internet mail access for quite awhile , but she is working on developing
an at-home business , which will give her more time with her new son
Conner. ( You SFR old-timers may remember her old name of elizabet [no "h"]
 - the name field of the system she was one wouldn't allow her to spell
out her whole name ). I think her husband Gilbert will also be there.

 Elizabet(h) told me that little Conner is already proto-bopping to
the music that Mom likes to play - must be than pre-natal influence! 

 I would like to arrange a pot luck South Bay Lunch for Elizabet(h) , 
Gilbert , and little Conner at Greer Park next Wednesday. Please spread 
the word to anyone who you think would be interested. Also , could those 
who are coming please let me know what you're bringing to eat or drink.

 The directions for the South Bay Lunch are shown below.

sobriety check points also serve to catch a lot of outstanding warrants
and minor infractions for tickets. Captive audience...and money is money.
The use of sobriety check points is, at least to legal theorists, on
shakey constitutional ground, and one of the few places the police can
use a guilty until proven innocent approach, and the milk it.

I have an idea for a lighting effect for f+f that I'd like to try out. I 
need as many of the ol' standby Radio Shack square strobelights as I can 
buy, beg or borrow. If you have one, could you please bring it? I would 
be very thankful (especially if the idea works). If you can bring one, 
make sure to label it with your name and telephone number. I'll bring 
some extra tape and a marker. Thanks. jmar.

Just a side note on sobriety checkpoints:

It was ruled in court that it is NOT grounds for a traffic stop if you
see a sobriety checkpoint and turn around to avoid it.

You are right- after looking at my last message I realized
I made only a little sense. "But what I meant to say was"

There was a court decision somewhere (forget the specifics)
that established the police right to require one to stop to
prove sobriety to move from point a to point be via a specific
route, where they can't in (most) other situations. This was
decided based on the percieved risk of drunk driving overriding
consitiutional right. And they use it for all sorts of things
that don't have a whole lot to do with alcohol.

Wendy reminded me that I forgot something important (what isn't)
in my Why I Wasn't at IN THE LIGHT (EarthSpace Seattle) post last
week.

How many times has this happened to/with you/yours?

When the music was cut at 3:45 or whatever, people kept dancing!
One man (Ferdous) had a drum - the only one!(?)  Lots of people
clapped - I mean clapped together - nice patterns 'n' stuff, y'know?
Trying and succeeding to keep "it" going.  Then a couple of people
started chanting.  It went on for a nice long time and darn it, it
was sweet!

I remember this phenomena at the end of the Marx Meadow dances those
long two summers ago.  And at the end of Boggie Buffet sometimes.

I think we're on to something here. (something old, something new...)

Oh yeah, so Ferdous stopped drumming a couple of times, and you could 
feel the vacuum just like when the sound cuts out.  I think he did, 
too, because he would start again and you could just feel this "Whew!
It's still going" uh... something  in the... ayer

Actually most NY city clubs actually close between 4:45 and 7am not
including after hours clubs.  The Sound Factory still stays open until 12
noon the next day.  There was a bit of trouble when the new mayor took
office a few months ago and he wanted to make an impression by digging up
some old laws to close anything that stayed open past 4 am.  He was using
the excuse that crime had to be stopped... but that didn't last more than a
couple of weeks.

I'm sure things will go back to normal in SF too.

Santa Cruz on Friday, June 17...

Additional info numbers:

Brad is out of town until late July and will not be playing.

Hope to see all you South Bay outdoorsy folks there (and SF/East Bay

weather is so nice we have an _obligation_ to do outdoor parties!

Peace + respect,

 Grey Six's post about live drummers reminds me of a similar incident
at a Richmond Civic event ( a "last" Gathering? ). At the end , after the
music was cut off , a guy continued to drum on an overturned plastic
drum - he was good too! They asked him to stop so that Martin could
be heard saying his thanks - yous .

 MOTION in San Jose has occasionally had live percussionists - the promoter
just asks them to play someplace away from the DJ , in order not to be a
distraction during the mixing. I've had the best dance/trancing at MOTION 
by dancing near the drummers and the speakers.

 I should have gone to SPAZ , cause then I would have finally heard 
Goa Gil again , after not hearing him for a long long time. I was trying
to save my energy for ANANDA , which was supposed to have Goa Gil
spinning , as well as Galen , who I like a lot.

 Well , Ananda didn't get started until about 3:45AM , and then the cops
shut it down at about 5:00AM - no Goa Gil for me! ( Tho Galen got to
do some great mixes before being shut down ).

 The party was supposed to be moved to another site - I took a nap in my 
truck , and when I finally got to the new site , nobody was in sight
on the street , and no thump-thump to be heard. Oh well - can anyone
else who went to ANANDA post how it finally came off?

 There's a discussion on another mailist about the musical style of
breakbeat - and I must sheepishly admit that I don't exactly know what
folks are refering to when they use the term breakbeat! Can someone 
recommend some typical tunes/artists/compilations that are clear
examples of breakbeat? Hey - maybe I've been liking this style all
this time and didn't know it!

PS: My ignorance extends to the definition of "progressive house" too!

I believe a breakbeat is something that has syncopation in it--ie, a beat that 
doesn't conform directly to the meter.  Jeno's "Energy" and Garth's "Break It
Down" both have songs with 'breakbeat' in them.  

As far as "progressive house" goes, who knows?  I thought it was all 
"progressive".

I'm sure others have different definitions, but my sense of 'breakbeat'
as a style is fairly fast (140-160 bpm) stripped-down tracks with drums,
bass and very little other instrumentation.  The amount of syncopation
varies a lot.  I almost never hear breakbeat played in SF and the Northwest.

'Progressive house' is a vague catch-all category for a style of house
that is less vocal-dependent or takes a more 'alternative' production
approach to the track than the usual club-style house.  Many people in
the east think that 'progressive house' is all that gets played on the
west coast, though that's hardly true.  The dividing line between
'progressive house' and what some call 'deep house' is more a matter of
gradient than kind.  I wonder what other people here would consider to
be representative tracks of 'progressive' and 'deep' house.  I suppose
the Sasha remix of 'Talk To Me' is progressive . . .

A Very Long New Moon Reveiw  

Well, I should say first off that since I'm part of the group that put
this on, I'm a little biased...but I wanted to post on it so you all
know how it went and might get influenced to go to the next one!  Which
may be at the end of June at Gregg's house.  It's not the new moon then,
but we want to have a going-away party for Glen and Heather.  

The crew, et. al. assembled at Heather & Glen's apt on Stanyon St.
beginning around 2 pm.  We were hoping to be on the road by 3, but you
know how that goes!  Since the party was also supposed to be Glen and
Heather's wedding, it took a lot more preparation than usual, but it
turned out to definitely be worth it in the end.  

Heather and Glen were busily making last-minute calls and wrapping
presents when we got there.  Has anyone out there been in a wedding? 
You know how stressful it is!  The bride and the groom are always
stressed (a little to a lot) and the others invovled pick up on that and
get stressed because it's supposed to be a SPECIAL DAY, you know, the
day the married couple remember for the rest of their lives, and this
knowledge somehow makes it harder.  But Heather and Glen were holding it
together incredibly well...they have been living together for many years
and they have the couple thing down now, no problem.  They've also
organized several parties besides this one and know exactly what to do
and when to do it.

After arranging the rides for people, the generator, the sound system,
the presents, the altar, etc., we finally got on the road about 4:30. 
The party was to be held at Goat Rock, which is out by Bodega Bay.  A
word on the location:  it's beauty is astonishing, and worth the drive. 
I would say this would even be a good spot for the FMR at some point,
but I want to give a word of caution:  the tides there are very
treacherous.  The ranger gave us a very solemn warning:  several people
die there every year.  Also, the tide comes in pretty far in some
places, and if you don't know the site, you might be tempted to set up
on a beach that will pretty much vanish during high tide.  When the tide
comes in, you have to climb over rocks if you want to get to the one
safe spot about 1/2 mile down the beach.  At one point in the evening,
we set up a string of candles to guide late-comers.  Gregg led a group
of already slightly drunk kids over the bad part around midnight, and
they were having some trouble.  Once again, this confirmed for me the
dangers of alcohol.  How I wish wish wish that pot (and other things)
were decriminalized.  *sigh*  Finally:  use of this site requires a good
dose of responsibility on the part of the organizers to make sure those
with altered judgement and motor skills make it through the night.

The site of the party was a cove maybe 1/2 to 3/4 miles from the parking
lot.  Much thanks goes out to those who helped haul everything that far.
 (If you read this, thanks thanks thanks, Lain & Phillip, two Sfravers
that helped out big time! You helped set up and helped break it
down..you are the coolest!)

On the system:  Galen brought Pacific Sound, his new
soundsystem.  Everyone there commented again and again on how good it
sounded.  It's been getting a lot of use lately:  last weekend he took
it to the Hemp Expo and played an awesome set there and the next day he
did his Sunset party with djs Dante & Buck.  And this Friday he did
another set with it at Ananda, despite being dead tired I expect from
the New Moon party.  

Everything was all set up a little bit before sunset, and Charles
Alexander started us out with an increasingly more mellow ambient set as
the afternoon faded into night.  The altar was set up against the base of the
cliff..there were sunflowers plus the usual candles and other meaningful
objects.  The main piece, though, was a large print of the same image
(two children holding hands before a glorious sunset) that was on the
cover of the wedding invitation/flyer-for-the-party.  

Heather & Glen were to be married by Dave Washer (the surfer/clothes
designer/artist who suggested the site) and Mona Love, mother of the New
Moon party.  Our unofficial flower-girl was beautiful Jasmine (nicknamed
Jazzy, and only 2 anahaf) who spied the wedding cake before anyone else!
 The ceremony began after everyone assembled before the altar.  Dave
told us all a little about Heather and Glen and about all our roles in
the ceremony.  He said that we all, not just Mona and himself, were to
be the ones marrying them.  He said that the ceremony was to be about
healing, both ourselves and the planet.  He also said that love is
necessary for healing and that simply being present was an expression of
love.  We all joined hands and he instructed us to meditate on this
thought as Heather and Glen, in soft voices, exchanged their vows.  Then
he asked us all to pronounce them married.  The crowd all said, pretty
much in unison, "I now pronounce you man and wife!"  Then a little giggle
went around as many of the women, including myself, said "I now
pronounce you HUSBAND and wife." 

 Then Mona sent into the crowd a piece
of cord and asked everyone to tie a knot into it to symbolize the
binding ties of love.  When this had returned to the altar, Heather and
Glen stood up and told us all about how they first met and also what it
has meant to them to be part of this "rave community," which to them is
about collectivism and cooperation and love and healing.  They told us
all that they hoped to someday be part of such a community again, as they are
moving to Philadelphia soon so that Heather can attend medical school
there.  Then Dave laughed, saying that "you seem to attract this kind of
thing!"  And then Glen said he has never felt so much love from so many
people and will remember us always.

Then Dave announced that as part of the wedding ceremony, Heather and
Glen would be passing out pouches that Heather and a friend had made. 
Everyone was asked to find a stone or shell or some other object from
the beach to put in this pouch, which they hoped we would then place on
our own altars or other such place to keep forever to reminds us of
their wedding.  As another keepsake, they also gave each person a
fimo pendant containing a pattern of flowers and painted with the
symbols "G & H 1994."    

The ceremony ended when Morgan suggested that we all stand up, join
hands, and make a circle.  We did, and all were astonished to realize
how many of us there were...maybe 70 or so.  We all started whooping and
when it stopped, the wedding was over.

Then the party began.  The music was ambient until 2 or 3.  Ambient djs
were Graham, Nick Philips and Charles Alexander.  People settled in
around the fires, talked and got to know each other during this time.  A
couple of people were antzy..."when's the house going to start!?!" they
were asking.  But most agreed that some hours of ambient set the
mood...sort of like foreplay and thus are absolutely necessary to
achieve the perfect New Moon effect!

The first house/dance dj to start was the incomparable Scott Hardkiss. 
His set was the sleekest of house shot through with veins of funk &
hiphop.  The generator crapped out a couple of times..after one breakdown, he
put on a housed-up Stones song that people really dug.  He was
absolutely amazing.  Then Galen went on.  His set was straight-up house.
 Galen wins the Iron dj award..he spun for five ana half hours.  (No
wonder Ananda got off to a late start..sorry guys!) In the morning,
Dante took over with some incredible acid jazz.  It was worth the wait. 
Now I know that acid jazz is the thing for me!  Then Mark Farina spun. 
A couple of us danced it all the way through out in the surf, 'cause the
sand was burning our bare feet.  A few folks walking their dogs gave us
funny looks...I wonder what they thought!

Around 2 we started breaking it down.  The thirty or so people there
pitched in with the haulage of items back to the parking lot.  Thanks!
Thanks also  go out to Allen of Ameba and Michelle who transported the
sound system back to SF.  Thanks also go out to Rick Webb, who stayed
til the very end, hauled stuff and made sure the beach was as beautiful
when we left as when we arrived.

Whew!  What a party!

love,

annthrax

Brian Sassone, Johnny Turpin and I are looking for a large space 
somewhere in the city. We hope to find something around 3-5000 sq ft at 
the $.50 to .75 /sqft range. At over a buck a square foot, my loft is 
quickly becoming a strain on my wallet. If you know of anything, anyone 
we could talk to or even have any advice for us, it would be *much* 
appreciated. We've been digging around Portrero, China Basin and lower 
SOMA trying to find some leads or just someone to talk to

Of course there will be a... er... umm... housewarming party (or two or 
three). hint-wink-nudge.

thanks. john.

Breakbeat is a dance subgenre that is characterised by syncopated
hip-hop style beats -- in fact, many early breakbeat tracks contained
loops of sped-up hip-hop beats.  In 1991-1992 a lot of breakbeat 
featured sped-up vocals that sounded almost like Alvin and the
Chipmunks.

When they refer to "hardcore" in the UK, they mean what we call
"breakbeat."  "Jungle" is another term for breakbeat.

Most breakbeat is fairly fast by San Francisco standards -- 135
to 210 beats per minute.  The REALLY fast stuff, though, was only
popular for a short amount of time I think.

The only breakbeat DJ I know of in San Francisco is Demigod.  
He played at Apocalypse from time to time.  The slower funky
groovy syncopated stuff Jeno plays can also be thought of as breakbeat,
but the breakbeat DJs I know prefer to call it "that San Francisco
breaky stuff" or "trip-hop" due to its hip-hop style beats.

"Progressive House" is a sort of follow-on from house.  It 
really isn't clear why it is named this, but it's a more technoy
trancey form of house, with harder "fatter" beats and a bit faster
than other forms of house, and less use of vocal samples.  A lot
of what Lee An plays can be classified as progressive house (and
also as a few other things -- he has a good amount of variety of
styles in his sets :-) ).

Will can probably define prog. house better than me . . . if you
heard him at the Blue Cube or Launch Pad, a lot of what he played
are good examples of progressive house.

I think we need to stop fighting each other-- let's unite against our 
common "enemies", and stop beating ourselves up.

It is going to be up to us to get this dealt with-- the Powers That Be 
would just LOVE to see us divided and conquered.
Let's see if we can hang together, because I think that the clubs will go 
under without our support. (they want to close the clubs at 2 am I'll 
bet) It's just exactly what the "Business Community" want to see happen 
to us-- this town is really starting to become beholden to the Money People
big time. Let's not let that destroy what we've got...

Peace!

Maui

lived up in Portland,Oregon back when progressive house meant you were 
playing a kick ass set consisting of some depeche mode new order a little 
red flag and some early techno like the classic "ACID ROCK" by Rhythm 
device still one of my favorite songs you never know you may even hear it 
on thursday but no dm or new order i'll leave that to live 105. any way i 
would really like to see ay many of you there as possible and since i 
don't think i've ever met any of you before please feel free to come up 
and say hello. and if i've met you be for i'm sorry if i don't remember

I think you did a pretty good job.  Let's see...

it's known by a number of people as just plain techno house if that makes
more sense to you.

yes, yes, yes.
Progressive house in England is comparable to the amount of house that gets
played here.  Most of it comes from the UK while some from Belgium,
America, & Italy.  The more commercial variety (like Sasha) comes closer to
deep house as it has more wailing divas, pianos, etc. while the more
underground variety has no divas and borrows more from trance, tribal, &
acid but keeping with house beat.

some labels:  guerrilla, hard hands, soma, limbo

i must say i really enjoyed that ambient thang at king st.
the sound was great, graphics good (except the endless video feedbak loops)
great music especially cheb-i-sabah
and great free-cd fu

the whole concept of people showing up to a large room bringing blankets
and pillows and water and going in and crashing out for a few hours is truly
a step into the future. its so prime for relaxing and socializing that i must
say i was very impressed by both the concept and the execution of it.

should i have a 12 hour ambient night at the blue cube?

I was in on the impromtu drum circle.  Me and a couple others got blocks
of wood ment for the fire and joined in with Ferdous.  Sweet isn't the
word.  I got the biggest natural high from it, and when the two girls
started chanting with the beat... Mind blowing...

It proves that the long arm of the law can't kill the vibe if the people
won't let it die!

Actually it now goes up to 170bpm (and I hear of faster tunes).
But "very little other instrumentation" is not at all accurate.  There
are vocal samples, acid synths, strings, etc.  I think what you say
might apply to "gabber".

This is a very "circular" description.  You are assuming that the
questioner, who does not know the "progressive house" term, nevertheless
understands what you mean hear by "alternative" or "deep house" for that
matter.  I've seen Steve Hillage and The Orb describe their 777 album as
"deep house", but I don't think they mean the same thing as you do. :-)

Finding myself in SF on a Saturday night, and not having been to a
'commercial' event in several months, I tossed a coin and went to
Fundamental last night.  It's the same place as the last Wicked,
a Latino cultural center at 2929 19th between Florida and Alabama,
only about six blocks from 16th & Harrison, actually (which had
Indonesia last night and was totally packed, all rooms being used,
according to what DRC told me today).

About the only good thing I can say for Fundamental is it wasn't too
crowded, thanks perhaps to the big turnout at the Haze.  Aside from
the usual lackadaisical and snotty door security, it was easy to get
into and the price ($10) seemed right.  Upstairs, a large rectangular
room and a smaller one, each with a sound system.  Jeno and Doc were
going toe to toe when I arrived (around the same time as Ethan, as it
turned out).

But the sound wasn't good in either room and to make things worse, Jeno
had it cranked up to the point of painful distortion (it got a little
better when Markie took over).  Doc was trying but had turntable problems
(more on that in a bit).  There was virtually no vibe to be found, 
except for Carlos, El Faro del Sur, who was flyering for his new Thursday
club.

Ethan left shortly thereafter, and no more than two minutes after he did
this woman (clubber type) who had come in the small room when Neon Leon
took over from Doc, comes over to me and demands to know, in the 
Immortal Four Words, . . .

"Are you a COP?!?!?"

I've told you all about my experiences with this line of inquiry in
my lovely but suspicion-ridden hometown, Portland.  She followed this
after my protestations to the contrary with, "Well, do you have any
drugs on you," and I realized this is now the two-part colloquy in a
certain part of the scene.  

All I can say is, it wasn't so long ago when this was a scene where you
were presumed to be what you acted like.  Since I was bopping along to
the ultra-hard house Leon was laying out, it looked like I was a devoted
if somewhat goofy looking out-of-towner, which I am.  But I am also a
scenester of some considerable experience.  And to me this little encounter
epitomizes what is going wrong with the big parties (or even medium sized
ones like this).  They have frozen into an unchanging pattern and allowed
a great deal of mischief and bad feelings and dealings to emerge.

Shortly after this I moved closer to the DJ setup.  Someone either bumped
the table or stepped on a board causing the needle to skip, right as Leon
was about to crossfade.  He immediately stepped back in disgust and
began motioning people away from the table.  I thought this was in good
fun, as Doc had grimaced but gracefully moved on when this happened a
couple of times, but instead Leon decided to pout.  He went to the
back corner for a minute or two before resuming.  The vibe in the room
just *sagged*.  Hissy fits from DJs may make for dramatic moments, but
this seemed a bit beyond.  Perhaps I misconstrued what happened, and
Leon has earned my respect as a DJ over and over again in the past for
his very perceptive selection and mixing techniques, but this just
aggravated what was rapidly becoming a downward trend.

Finally, in the big room, Jeno chose to finish up with the ugliest,
rawest stuff I've heard him play.  I'm not demanding that every cut
he or any other DJ play be in the happy-vibe category, but this just
seemed destined to bring out the adrenalin/testosterone response from
the crowd.  

Jeno and Doc at 4 am in a decent space and not too crowded, sounded like
a winning combo, right?

I left soon after Markie began his spinning.  He wasn't doing much better,
although at that point I'll admit my attitude was soured on the whole 
thing.

It seems petty to write all this up this way, but I'm simply trying to
reflect my honest response.  A kind of Gresham's Law syndrome has prevailed
over the commercial party scene in the last 18 months.  In thinking back
on it, the last truly memorable one I've been to in SF was a Funky Techno
Tribe at the Galleria where Tony just put us in orbit, and that was last
September as I recall . . .

The thing that impressed me most last night, after filtering out the
little incidents I mentioned here, was the absolute lack of good vibe
among the crowd.  It reminded me of the first time I went to NAF in
Seattle last summer, when only Donald Glaude spinning wake-up house
at 6 am outside managed to salvage a nearly worthless night.  

And yet, commercial events *can* go off, as an excellent one here in
Portland just last week proved.  

Having watched the Grateful Dead more or less disintegrate into a
pleasant but bland outfit just the previous night at Cal Expo in
Sacramento, it reminded me of what happened just two years ago when
I went directly from a Dead show at Cal Expo to an excellent Thursday
night affair at Townsend with Garth and others spinning, when it 
really was more for fun.  

And it still is fun overall -- I love my DJ practicing and record buying,
the small events this year have been great, and it's exciting to make
contact with folks both at home and around the world who are tuned into
this wave.  But it's sad to see a great if short-lived institution like
the SF rave massive turned into just another all-night warehousing of
atavistic citizens on the loose.

I think that SF is in the hands of Big Business at the moment. I think 
they are pretty much calling the shots at this point.

The cops, IMHO, are trying to get rid of an element they can't control. 
Things like 'raves' are just by their very nature _not_ in their control, 
and man, they *really* hate that! They want everyone to be knocking their 
heads on the floor toadying up to them... case in point-- my stepmom used 
to manage the Keystone way back when, and they used to pay off the cops 
on a routine basis to keep from being harassed. This stuff with the SOMA 
clubs really makes their political agenda obvious.  Mayor Frank Jordan 
needs to be soundly *thrashed* for his knee-jerk right-wing actions. 
Like, we now have fingerprint scanning devices that we pay for to 
supposedly catch 'welfare cheaters'. That system has cost *alot* of 
money, and so far they've found 1 (ONE) person who was getting benefits 
illegally. Can you say "blame the victim? I know that you can..."

Also, there's that stupid "smoke a joint, lose your license" crap too. 
I've been writing/faxing our alleged representatives for weeks on that one.
I don't even know what's going on in The City at the moment; they managed 
to "lose" 10ks worth of absentee ballots, so I and many others just 
couldn't vote. Coincidence? I don't think so...

Enough for now... Gotta go...

Peace!

  I really wanted to do YSH at Arte, but the woman who runs the place says 
that she can't get a cabaret license (esp. not for thursdays)

Do you know something I don't?

We are not having Your Sister's House of late because of scheduling 
problems...

HEY!!!! ALL YOU WOMEN OUT THERE!!!!

YSH is a collective of women DJ's and women techies, and I _know_ that 
there are alot of folks out there that would love to be involved.
Well, stop dreaming about it and get real! It's SO much fun :) :) :)

Let's get together and get YSH back on full steam ahead!!!  There is 
nothing like _empowerment_. (I get Permagrin just thinking about it)

Hope to see y'all at Friends & Family...

Not to be picky, but I sure would like some of the dancefloor to be 
non-strobed so that crips like me can dance-- I have to balance myself 
via my eyes (rather than my inner-ear) and the strobes really screw that 
up. I would be happy to help with the setup if it's needed.... if not, 
well.... Who Cares?!!!?  I'm with my friends-- I don't really mind looking 
like a drunkard when folks know *why* I can't dance! :) :) :)

That reminds me-- we should make more of an effort to have chill-out 
spaces for the folks who want and need it... I know I'm not the only crip 
around! Do you think that there's even a chance we might be able to go 
indoors partway?

I want to have this be your decision as well as mine-- I sure would have 
a hard time doing this without Soundvision!!

Hell, I wouldn't _want_ to do it any other way..  :)

Let's have another meeting-- people like Laura, Scottie, and the SPAZ 
folks totally didn't get to have their say... not to mention the FMR 
folks and asstd. others.

I would like to have DRC spin as the YSH DJ... is that cool with 
everyone? Susan is in the Twilight Zone right now, so I don't want to ask 
her to spin...

I am in Sac for the early part of this week and will be in Nevada City 
this next weekend. You can reach me at 916.265.5670 (mom) or 916.488.8184 
(Sean Casey's). and of course, there's email.

Peace!

World Groove will be a huge party held at the Cow Palace, which is 
where they have professional basketball games, so it is BIG.  It
will have lots of bands, so it could be intersting in a concert
sense, but many people are doubtful of the vibe.

Back-to-Basics 2nd Year Anniversary will be a medium sized party, not
sure of the location.  The fact that one of you is only 17 might be
a problem, as sometimes there are 18+ age restrictions, you should
call the phone line or even email Martin himself to make sure if you
decide to go to this one.  The last Basics party I went to they did
check IDs.  Basics parties seem to be very consistent, so I'd pick
this over World Groove -- good DJs, good overall production, and a
good group of people usually attend.

I am biased (being one of the DJs), but I'm going to be at Friends and
Family.  Even if I weren't spinning I'd still be there.  It will be
a small party, I believe with no age restriction, and it's put on
by a big bunch of SFRaves people and that produces a family sort of
vibe.  The the music will be a mixture of the acid/trance/progressive/
experimental vein along with some more straight-up house.  Spun will 
be spinning, along with Alex from Gaia Mantra, the usual Liquid Air
DJs, and Tamotsu. There will be a seperate chill area with ambient 
all night long, featuring all net-DJs including Joe Rice from LA; there 
will be a special live performance by Weird Blinking LIghts and also a 
sort of guided visualization of quantum physics by Ovid with music spun
by M. Normal.  It will be cool.  And all this for only $3.  Finger
my account for the flyer.

Sorry to pitch in on a negative tip but I feel even more strongly than fred
does about just how bad fundamental was not only as itself byt also as a
representative of commercial parties in general. I only stayed 20 minutes
but here are my observations:

Sound:
Like Wicked the sound systems *sucked*! While at least in this case they
"worked" they were overdriven at the amps and then to make it worse, by the
djs. My ears are still ringing.

Space:
This space is from hell. Call me oversensitive or whatever but this space
exudes a bad vibe. It's dark, it's cavernous, there's no ventilation. It
feels trapped in 1970. The installed tracklight spots of yellow and red
that both Wicked and fundamental used just feel totally cheesy. Adding *a*
blacklight just doesn't make the diffference. The smaller room is decidedly
better and, used by itself might be workable. Architecturally it's much
more interesting, acoustically much more promising, and generally just
*feels* better. But to put it in real perspective: the trocadero blows this
space away...

Vibe:
This is what really hurts. For the first time I was surrounded by people
who were obviously (and by their own admission) twisted. I certainly have
no objection to this but at fundamental I couldn't escape the perception
that I was surrounded by a huge illusion. There was no vibe anywhere yet
everybody was totally glazed jumping up and down ferociously, sweating,
their eye's bulging, drunkeness obvious in many cases. School is obviously
out and I shudder to think that the numerous absolute newbies I encountered
there went home thinking that this is what raving in SF is like...

Cost:
This is the only good thing I have to say about fundamental. As compared to
Wicked: fundamental delivered two rooms, twice the number of DJs,
drastically better visuals (Lon of PURE is a toal genius), actually did
something with the halls (instead of just leaving the flourescents on for
chrissake) for $5 *less*.

In sum:
If this is what the summer has to offer, then this scene at least as far it
relates to the "big" promoters is on its way down. And guess what: it's all
about *money*. The big promoters are using this space cos: it's big, it's
relatively cheap, it's got police protection, and it's all ages, ie. they
can count on making their money. I SAY SCREW THEM! They're ripping *you*
off, they're ripping *me* off and worst of all they're making this scene
look (and sound) like shit. Promoters if you're listening: it's time to
start taking some chances again. I for one will *never* return to this
space and, given recent experiences, am abandoning massives in general.

I know I've been bitching a lot lately and I'm sure many of you are sick of
it. Sorry. I'll try and shut up, put my energy where my heart is, and let
evolution take care of the dinosaurs. ;-)

Friday - Ananda: We were pretty psyched for this; great DJ lineup,
outdoors, free.  We napped till 1:30, showered, and watched Beavis &
Butthead while waiting for the map point location to be given out.  
Finally, at around 3:00 or so, the location was revealed to be Ocean 
Beach, in the vicinity GG Park.  We scratched our heads in bewilderment
since this site seemed like a sure bust.  In warm weather, there are 
always people hanging out at that beach and it is always patrolled.  
Back to sleep.

Saturday - The ambient party at 174 King St. was quite enjoyable.
Consistantly excellent music, good sound, decent visuals.  YAP did
a rousing semi-live set that I just *had* to dance to, but for the
most part we just spaced out.  Hearing some of FSOL's Lifeforms played 
loud on a big system was particulary intense.  Over the entire evening 
the music seemed to leaned toward tribal/trance with slow but often 
heavy beats - great stuff.

Security was strict, but not horrible - a friend did have her pipe 
conviscated, but considering the recent SFPD activities, I can kinda 
understand this.  In fact, the SFPD did come later and swept the place 
with flashlights, eventually leaving without incident.  It was pretty 
ironic that shortly after the pipe incident, we were compelled to change
our location to escape the very heavy tabacco smokers who were 
engulfing us with a nonstop cloud of poison.  Eventually, the lack of
fresh air in that space got to us anyway, and we left around 4:30.

The thing about chillout parties is that there is a greater amount of
intimacy involved, unlike at raves were constant motion makes one
less likely to feel trapped by a localized annoyance.  There was a small
amount of sexual slithering and a couple of mouth flappers who didn't
seem to understand the meaning of the word "chill", but overall, the vibe 
was respectful and serene and quite appreciative of what was being
performed.  I would have like some more lighting effects to add to the
video/slide projector screens, but other than that, it was a very
well-produced event.  Looking forward to the next one.

A few additions:

Small in this case means 200-250 people max. This party will be packed. We
are bringing in *truly massive ventilation* however we are recommending
that everyone dress in their finest silk boxers and favorite brassiers
(sp?) as partial nudity is a definite possibility. ;-) I will be wearing my
glow-in-the-dark, happy-acid-face boxers !-)

Given the lessons of our recent society, isn't it almost a certainty
that anything reaching massive proportions is going to get an influx
of bad energy?

I think it's amazing that there have been so many good massives. But I
think that the ones with a truly good vibe are rare. I don't even
bother any more.

The future is: underground parties!

Now I'm *really* excited about that. :)

1 - a note from the editor

Dear fellow pronoids--

It's been a week since the first beach head was established
here on the East Coast.  NYC is this cold, hard city, right?

Not if you're pronoid.

We've been jacked into the core of the cultural matrix in
such cauldrons as Liquid Sky, Greenwich Village, Soho and
more...  The NYC natives sense Zippies are filled with the
light side of the force.  The Death Star is doomed.

New gigs in the NYC underground scene will send us off
towards the Rocky Mountains at the end of June, and points
west.

Try Spun's Loosely Spun tape. 

IMHO- Spun qualifies as someone who often plays breakbeat.
His sets and tapes have that trip-hop/breakbeat influence, 
probably because he was a hip-hop DJ before he was a house/rave DJ.

Off I go-

My party impressions of the weekend.

Thursday I met some friends at Flour.
A skinny bar with a skinny dance room and a pool room in the back.
30 - 40 people dropped by while I was there.
Some were dolled up (I am a sucker for any effort).
House that wasn't perfect for the loungy crowd but improved later.
I wanted to go to the $5 bday party but we called it an early night.

Saturday we tried the chill party but wanted to dance so we didn't go in.
Then we tried the IBeam - it was $7 for hiphop but only until 2:00.
Next we went to Fundamental.  We waited in line for 15 minutes with
500 high school kids talking about grad night and yearbooks.  We left.

We drove down Howard Street and saw at least 10 cop cars and a paddy wagon
just fucking storm some club (6??).  It was like a swat team invasion as they
charged the door - we got out of the area quickly.

hi folx,
went to nickie's last tue. and had a truly good time. cheb-i-sabbah
does his north african trance musick. the vibe was on and
the location, lower haight is good if a bit crowded. past tue.
tho' there was a nice surprise: around midnight, four women dressed
in burgundy red dresses, coins, heavy eyeliner/makeup - i guess
arabic wear - came out and did this great set of dances while cheb was
spinning some intense trance. wow! shekinah in effect y'all. this went
on for about half-an-hour, after we all resumed dancing at a higher
intensitiy level, that's for sure. don't know if these dancers will be there
every week, but it's worth checking out.
take care/shalom/acid+bass

If I'm correct the four women were "Fat Chance," belly dancers that used to
do a regula gig at the Cafe Istanbul on Valencia street in the city.
Definitely great. [Cheb and Laura] (aka Kwan Yin) definitely stole the show
at saturday's ambient party as well, I thought :)

take it easy

===================

   This Saturday evening,   after checking out the info numbers to 
determine the locations to our big Saturday evening events,   I find
that....

  The Chill Shall Inherit the Earth was at 174 King St (one of my
      blacklisted venues - so THIS one was not a go...)
      
  Indonesia was at 16th and Harrison (Yet another blacklisted venue by
      any self respecting "Old schooler")
  
  Zig Zag/Trix was at the DV8 - Now THIS was promising,  but the DJ list
      didn't have anyone I thought I would enjoy.
      
  Fundamental - WOW!  Great DJ lineup....  But as of about 7 pm,  the
      venue wasn't put up on info line yet.
      
      
   Eventually I learn that it was at the new 19th and Alabama venue,  some
Latino Cultural center.    Hmmm!  After attending Wicked there last weekend,
I had some reservations about the very high "Faschist goon factor" or in
other words,  the security bozos were WORST than NAZI's.   Last weekend,
I was able to find a reasonable "Chill" space to cool down,  dispite the
fact that the goons had it shut tighter than a dungion,  with little
or NO ventilation and exceptionally high humidity (A Tradition with
WICKED parties -  I have NO complaints about that as long as I'm dressed
cool,  and can get some outside air during chill times).

  As I arrived (About 1:30 am),  I found the line very long and slow,   but
as I went up to the front of the line to check on the price,   I was immediately
grabbed by a group of young ravers who offerred me a place in line.   This was
promising.    All wanting to know and talk to me.    All were eager to find
out about why I'm called Cap'n Crunch.   One dude handed me inscence and
as I got to the front of the line to get searched,  the goon said I couldn't
bring the inscence inside.   Sheesh!!  What the fuck...  do they really think
I was going to burn the place down?  ...with all the tobacco smoking going on.

  Inside... It was PIG CITY,  as Mayor Frank Jordan was keeping to his obsession
to "Clean up SOMA (South of Market Area)".   As usual,  it was crowded,  and
a little hard to move around in the narrow hallways to go between rooms.   The
only water source was the wash basin in the over-crowded mens room.

  This week,  they had stationed a goon near the door,  so ALL doorways were
"Gooned" I would say.    Ocasionally,  I would lean on the door,  and 
"Accidentely" lean on it too hard to get even just ONE gasp of fresh air,
but was warned that I would get kicked out the next time I committed the
evil and hidious crime of breathing fresh air.

   Later on,  I discovered an open door behind the projection equipment,
situated on a stage like area.   In this little room,  the had some chairs
and a big wide open window,  letting in some nice and welcome fresh air.
I noticed this after I hopped onto the stage and discovered a nice cool
breeze and traced it to its origin.

  The sound SUX big time....  Horribly distorted,  almost an embarrassment
to the great efforts of the DJ's which tried to deal with it.   There were
two rooms.   One small (Which Buck was spinning) and had tinney, and crappy
sound with NO bass.   In the larger room,  I found Garth cooking up a
wonderful trancey brew (As he always does).   My energy level,  turned up to
the MAX (As Usual) was highly instrumental in generating a great number
of smiles and good vibes in a venue that is somewhat lacking in same.

  I eventually leave around 6 am,  where I was to get picked up to help
my partner Aaron get ready to run the Dipsey Trail,  a 7 mile run from
Mill Valley to Stinson Beach over a part of Mt Tamalpias.    It's an
85 year tradition,  but this time,  I passed on the opportunity.
Aaron did it in 1 hr 10 mins (record was 45 minutes).   Exceptionally
good.    Some 68 yr old dude named "Sal" won it (3 times so far,  as I
was told.

  Eventually,  we head back into SF to hang out at the End up for a few
hours so Aaron could use the car to visit with his friends from out of town.

  Later that afternoon we head out to the Haight St fair and had a killer time
hanging out and was also invited to Ameba's (A rave related clothing store on
the Haight) backyard party.    It was KILLER!!   About 300 people were there
when I arrived,   and Garth was dishing out some insane funk,  mixed with
some killer trance that blew my mind.   The dance area Sucked,  was very 
uneven ground,   but the luv factor was turned on to the Max,  and it
was a very happy scene.   Exceptional sound,  and had a great time dancing
my ass off (OR TRYING TO).

   Later on,  it was moved up the I-Beam,   a very large night club,  good
ventilation,  and reasonable sound.    We eventually left around 9:30 pm,
and head back North over the Golden Gate,  back into Marin Co.

   All in All,  it was a wonderful weekend,  although my knees were complaining
today from dancing on the uneven ground.

Till next time...  Keep the scene alive...

I was SO RELIEVED to read the negative reviews of Fundamental.
Until I read those reviews, I thought that this event might be
representative of the entire san francisco scene.  A few additional 
comments:  At 1:30 the line was the longest line I have ever
seen for a house club, so I went down the street to Indonesia.
Indonesia had good production (sound system and projections
were top-notch), but it lacked any real vibe.  The crowd
seemed more high-school aged... which by itself is not bad at all,
but I think they were the high school kids who don't have a clue.  
At 4:30 I went
back to Fundamental, only to find nasty argument between
the promoter, the venue manager, and a few DJ's (including
Ernie Munson).  Apparently it was an "I gave you the money/no you
did not" thing.  No one wanted to take my 10 bucks, so I just walked
in.  A few people up in the house room were pretty cool, and we kind
of produced our own little vibe, but then (excuse my language)
the most FUCKED UP thing I have ever seen at a club happened.
This guy kept dancing around the floor, being real annoying and 
bothersome.  A girl stopped him and (I assume) asked him to 
to dance in a way that didn't disturb others.  A small shouting
match ensued, and he shoved her clear across the floor.  She barely
kept her balance, only for him to come up to her, and start yelling
and threatening her.  A friend of his quickly stopped him.  What an
awful thing to witness on my first weekend in SF.
	The weekend wasn't all bad though.  I thought Anada was very
cool.  Renegade parties on the beach is something you don't see
in southern cal.
The music was hard-trancish, and the climate was relatively warm,
thanks to record-heat on friday (56' at 3:30am.)  Certainly the
most fun I have had on the beach for a while.  I'm still 
pulling sand out of my Vans, though. :)
	Also, on Thursday I found Lift to be fun.  Good house music, 
about 30-50 people dancing, and generally happy attitudes.  This is a 
good club for a Thursday night (the vibe was certainly higher than
anything I went to on Saterday night)

Despite all of the problems at Fundamental I must give props to Ernie 
Munson and Markie Mark who spun together on 4 turntables. Some serious DJ 
skills were exhibited. Too bad it was ruined by a horrible sound system 
that was harmful to your hearing:(

I'd appreciate some help on IDing some artists that I heard at the
Chill event on Sat 6/11 at King Street.

When I arrived about 12:30, two guys were playing -- one dark curly
hair, the other long blonde -- they had tons of gear.  Is this 
the Chill-Core-Collective?  I thought they were great, so whovever
they are, I'd like to hear more.

Later in the evening, a single artist with about 3 "keyboards" played
a very fine set -- I assume he is Young American Primitive, right?

Between these two sets, I enjoyed a tribal/worldy sound with Alaura
and ???? -- 

I really was there and paying attention -- but didnt take notes!
So, thanks for the help

  Meet The Raver Baby!
 
   This week Wednesday at the SFR South Bay lunch , the originator of
 the Greer Park lunches will be bringing her 10 month old son to the

 an at-home business , which will give her more time with her new son
 Conner. ( You SFR old-timers may remember her old name of elizabet [no "h"]
  - the name field of the system she was one wouldn't allow her to spell
 out her whole name ). I think her husband Gilbert will also be there.
 
  Elizabet(h) told me that little Conner is already proto-bopping to
 the music that Mom likes to play - must be than pre-natal influence! 
 
  I am arranging a pot luck South Bay Lunch for them tomorrow. Please spread 
 the word to anyone who you think would be interested, so far I've gotten
 only one response for attendence. Also , could those who are coming 
 please let me know what you're bringing to eat or drink. Someone is b
 bringing soda and juice , and I'm going to bring garlic bread.
 
  The directions for the South Bay Lunch are shown below. I will be bringing
 the cassette/CD/radio "boom box", so bring music is you want to.

I am still confused by one of Laura's statements that UK "hardcore" is 
like US "breakbeat". I really thought they  were totally different - We 
don't hear much hardcore over here. But all the labels confuse me - my 
criteria - does it make you wanna dance....? Then it's O.K. Peace Lady Trash

	One thing that will help you tell breakbeat is that it's generally
really fast... about 150 + beats per minute.  You probably don't hear
very much of it on the west coast, it isn't very popular there. 
Typically the way people make breakbeat is they take a house beat,
and speed it up to double speed, then they take this double-speed
beat, and play it at 150 bpm or so, so that's where all the
syncopation comes from.  You might notice chipmunk-like voices in
some breakbeat, because some breakbeat djs like to play their 33 rpm
records at 45, giving it that "double-speed chipmunks on acid" type
sound...  One type of breakbeat that's very popular in England right
now is called Jungle.  It's based on reggae music that's been sped up
quite a bit...  I'm not very into breakbeat, but Jungle is pretty
cool.  By no means am I an expert on the subject, so if anyone cares
to correct me, feel free.

>>> Larry Ching <larryc@netcom.com>  6/11/94, 12:01pm >>>
 There's a discussion on another mailist about the musical style of
breakbeat - and I must sheepishly admit that I don't exactly know
what folks are refering to when they use the term breakbeat! Can
someone  recommend some typical tunes/artists/compilations that are
clear examples of breakbeat? Hey - maybe I've been liking this style
all this time and didn't know it!

Hello friends,

Sorry it's taken me so long to post this, but:

A big thank you to everyone who came to the Benefit Warehouse Party on 
May 27.  The event raised over $1,500 for the Lyon-Martin Women's Health 
Care Center, a non-profit primary care clinic.  We truly appreciate your 
support, and I hope those of you who attended had as much fun as I did.  

Thanks again,
Kathryn

It is a bit confusing.  Breakbeat and hardcore (US definition) are quite
different.  What the English call "hardcore" is what people in the US 
call "breakbeat." What people in the US call "hardcore" is what the English 
call "Rotterdam" or sometimes "Gabber."  

In the UK:  hardcore is different from Rotterdam
in the US:  breakbeat is different from hardcore

I wonder how much most breaks are directly related to house beats, which
typically are in the 115-130 bpm range.  Ragga and jungle both depend
on reggae riddims which are often in the 70-85 bpm range which conveniently
doubles to the 140-170 range favored for breaks and jungle.

As for faster beats, I'm a contrarian, I've been known to play faster
45s at 33 and 'Autobahn' at 45 :-)

Rather than batting around verbal descriptions of musical genres, I find
that actual examples usually work a lot better.  Here's what I would consider
to be good examples of some of the genres that have been asked about lately...

progressive house: Get any of the "Cream of Undergound House" compilations.
	There are three volumes so far.  All of them are good examples of
	what I would consider to be progressive house.  Unfortunately they
	are imports from the UK, which means they're a bit expensive.  For
	cheaper (domestic) progressive house compilations, I would recommend
	Epic Records' "Futurhythm" compilation or Profile Records' "Future
	House" compilation.

breakbeat: I'm not an expert on this one, but I've seen lots of recommendations
	for Moonshine Music's "Speed Limit 140 bpm+" series of compilations.
	(These are all domestic and pretty easy to find.)

house: The best house CD I have ever heard is a DJ-mixed CD called "Spiritual
	Tracks Volume 1."  It's an import and may be hard to find.  (There's
	also a "Spiritual Tracks Volume 2", which isn't quite as good as #1.)

trance: Get "Trance Europe Express."  This is an import, but it's not over-
	priced at all.  You get 2 full-length CDs and a 200-page booklet that
	has interviews with the featured artists, all for only $22 or so.

tribal: Get Twitch CD #6.

If you're searching for any of the above CDs, I'd suggest starting out by
calling BPM (415-567-0BPM) or Tweekin' (415-626-6995).

I've finally got it figured out... *no one* knows what breakbeat is. That 
seems to be essential to the whole genre.

Seeing that (1) I am a DJ (2) between Brian and I we have a HUGE
music collection (3) I can digitize sound on my Sparc-10 at work
and (4) I think I have *some* pull with Mr. Behlendorf, I hearby

Sounds like Graham (long-hair) of Natural Music and Charlie of Anarchic 
(curlyish).  Missing from the group was Winston who was asked to leave 
because he didn't have ID.  [Fascist goon commentary omitted =) ]

I believe they're writing as "The Cube Project" and tapes I've heard have 
been excellent.

For a good breakbeat sample that many people on this list probably all now,
get your Exist Dance compilations out and listen to the beats in High
Lonesome Sound System's "Psychic Dreaming".  This is much slower than you
normally hear for breakbeat.

>Typically the way people make breakbeat is they take a house beat,
>and speed it up to double speed, then they take this double-speed

Actually, I'm pretty sure the beats in breakbeat are sped up hip-hop beats.

I was in England when breakbeat (which they called hardcore at the time
because it was so fast) was taking off and many DJs were just taking
hip-hop records that played at 33rpm but they played them at 45rpm.  That's
why the vocal samples sound like "the chipmunks".  I don't think breakbeat
has changed much since '91.  It's only gotten faster.

Ha. :)

Making a hypertext version of the alt.rave FAQ is high on my list
of priorities - and making all the genre examples links to song
samples is an obvious thing.  Actually turning the entire archive into
a hypermedia representation of this culture we're a part of is the way
to go.  But that has to wait for something first....(which is coming
soon)

ok lets just face it...there is little to none breakbeat in the city

Hi -

re:
>Does anyone know anything about the Oregon Country Fair. I've picked up a few
>interesting comments about it from here and there and it's got me interested.

The 25th annual OCF is Fri, Sat, Sun July 8,9,10 (always 2nd weekend in
July) on a site owned by OCF approx 15 miles west of Eugene.  I think the
hours are 11am to 7 or 8 pm.

Friday is usually fresher and less crowded, but starting last year they
have limited the number of tickets sold for each day (several thousand) and
tightened up on the IDs for staff/vendors/etc who have overnight access. 
Tickets ( $7 Friday, $10 Sat & Sun?) can be purchased in advance (if
interested, I'll try to find more info).  There is no camping or overnight
parking on the grounds.  Free busses run regularly from/to Eugene.

Much fun! (from my biased perspective as a 50 year old who has attended
approx every other year since 1975 or so).  Colorful! When we lived in
rural Oregon the fair was THE event of the year.  A large main stage/dance
area and several small stages with variety of music all day.  A drum area
with constant drumming and dancing.  Food (try Tofu Tia special). Crafts.
Massage. Community village.  Alternative energy.  Layout is a large figure
8 trail with side loops.  One of my favorite off-the-main path (often
missed) attraction for relaxation is the Ritz sauna with large group
outdoor showers and firepit gathering area (often live music); usually only
available ($3) until 3pm? for fair attendees.

Usually good music (Radiators and rave this year?) in Eugene area that weekend.

Enjoy.

- Ed

I went to my first Country Fair last year and had a b-l-a-s-t!  I'm going 
up again this year. Don't get your hopes up for a rave on the grounds, 
though.  Preston talked to them about it last year, and despite the 
appeal of another alternative culture, the technology/electronic nature 
of the thing seemed to scare them.  I was walking around with Mark Farina 
who was playing beats on a boom box, and despite the fact that he 
recevied a lot of smiles and knowing winks, some people working for the 
fair asked him to turn it off.  :(

If you can go, go.  If you can't, don't.

According to one of the Zippy newsletters, their scheduled summer tour
includes:

>July 8-10 	 Indian Summer Rave
>                Oregon County Fair, Oregon

Whether they meant "country" is up for debate, I guess.  I'm certainly
not going to vouch for its correctness or likelihood of happening...

I was wondering if you are allowed to bring your own bottles of water into
Kommotion. Unfortuately, at King Street garage last week, the security 
was very tight and they wouldn't let you bring your own water in. 

I will be there at the party on the *18th*. I will be wearing my black 
"just Say n2o" shirt:).

Our Party on Sunday during the haight street fair was well attended,
and officer Gannan was there to take the credit. "It's my party , did
you have fun?" was Gannan's response even though he was battered by 
numorous complaints from neighbors. We gave half the money to the I-beam
security and half to the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic. The Director was
shocked to recieve money from ravers.(we are not on many peoples list
of respect due) Sorry If I was rude to anybody at the gate , I know I 
might have been.

My Uncle who owns the property where Penelope's Web was thrown Has 
invited us to play again (and pay 1000$) for a weekend this summer.

I will go to Peek tonight at the Oasis, am I alone?

New Moon Party was incredible!

salutations, allen@ameba

Dear Sindar,

    I'm sorry it's taken so long to reply to this, but I'm *way* behind 
on reading my email.  I just came across your post (above) responding to 
my review of Spundae's last month, and I think you deserve an explanation 
of my feelings on this.  Talking about illegal actions being committed 
was not an unintentional "mistake" on my part; I have thought about this 
issue before, and I am comfortable with my approach.  Before I go on to 
explain why, I want to thank you for the positive and non-judgemental 
tone of your message, which I will strive to maintain.
    I too, by the way, am over 21 -- I just happen not to have any 
picture ID as a result of having my wallet and my passport stolen on two 
separate occasions, one of which I regret to say was at a small, intimate 
rave.
    But anyway, to the point.  I am aware of the fact that theoretically 
anyone, including law enforcement personnel, could be reading the sfraves 
mail.  I don't think this is particularly likely, considering the size of 
the list, its lack of visibility, and the fact that the SFPD has many 
other things to worry about, but even if I knew for a fact that some 
government official was poring over my posts, I don't think I would 
delete any references to illegal activities.
    This month marks the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in New 
York, a historical event whose significance is perhaps just beginning to 
be recognized on a broad scale.  This was, in effect, when gays started 
to come out of the closet in modern times.  I can easily imagine in 
pre-Stonewall times a lot of conversations taking place along the lines 
of:  "You better watch your mouth!  I overheard you telling those guys 
about the gay scene at our bar, and you never know who could be 
listening.  The cops have had their eye on this place, you know, and if 
word starts getting around that it's a homosexual pickup joint, we'll get 
busted!"
    Do you see my point?  Laws against drug use by adults and laws 
forbidding people under a certain age to enter certain establishments are 
as wrong as laws against certain types of sexual activity.  Bad laws 
deserve to be broken, and in fact these laws are broken regularly.  But 
the #1 weapon in the arsenal of the authorities who want to tell us how 
to live our lives is our own silence about our behavior.
    To return to the example of gay rights, as long as gays remained "in 
the closet," and broke the unjust laws against same-sex relations only 
covertly, it was relatively easy for the bigots to keep them in their 
status as second-class citizens.  Only when gays stood up for their 
rights openly, and confronted the law head-on did they achieve real 
change.  
    The same unwritten code of silence exists today in regard to drug use 
and many other "victimless crimes."  Now maybe I am not brave enough (or 
martyr enough) to get up and say, "Hey, I'm in this club, and I'm using 
Exstasy.  What are you going to do about it?" to a cop, and when I was 
under 21 I didn't advertise that fact when I got into a bar, but I am 
brave enough to speak out publicly on the fact that these things go on, 
and I am a willing participant.  What this does is build momentum, and 
create a stronger consensus in the community of what 99% of us already 
know is true:  that these laws are unjust, and deserve to be broken.  
When enough of us get up and say that, and refuse to be denied our human 
rights any longer, then things will change.  I look forward to that day.

"You can stop the party, but you can't stop the future."

"You can pledge allegiance to the flag -- I pledge allegiance to freedom."

 I got a question about Friends and Family this Saturday - is it OK
to bring food &/or candy , or will the venue frown on it? I was thinking
along the lines of bread , bananas , and peppermints.

Thank you, Starchild, for so eloquently raising the issue
of the immorality of bad laws and the imperative for each           
one of us to break them to the extent that we can!

Thank you, too, Sindar, for giving Starchild the opportunity
to address the issue! Each of us must go as far as we are
comfortable in confronting immorality. At a recent party I
attended last week in the City, whilst enjoying one of the
most spiritually evolved djs I've had the pleasure to dance
to, it became obvious to me and others that at least two
narcs were present, one who was chain-drinking bar drinks,
blowing continual blasts of smoke in dancers' faces and
lurking continuously in front of a speaker stack.  In my
heightened state of awareness it gave me a surge of hyperkarma
to stand next to this moral neanderthal and stare at him
until he became aware of me (about one and a half minutes)
and then calmly tell him that it takes much less effort to
respect others' rights to enjoy the music, breathe the air,
and dance without being stared at, and that one really has
to work at being an asshole. He left his unfinished drink on    
the speaker, smashed his cigarette under his heel, nattered
something about this being his kind of music, too, and stormed
off the dance floor--for awhile.  Mine was just a minor and
random act of poetic terrorism, but as a person who has come
to see that the closets I have been walking out of are largely
self-created (even though they are constructed by our immoral
culture) I believe my "coming out" to him was a positive and
entheogenic epiphany for both of us.

I hope Starchild and Sindar have touched a topic that will
kindle at least a minor thread here, because even if this
subject has been visited before, and especially because it
makes some sfr people uneasy, it remains pivotal to our
very being in the "rave community."  The comparison to
Stonewall and gays is apt; as a gay man whose own self-
oppression has been the most crucial immoral judgment laid
down by an unjust society I know that--as is etched in my
high school's marble entry walls where some of the names of    
the dead are former students of mine--"Freedom Cometh Not Free!"

World's second oldest raver,
Will

I have a bit of a problem with you saying that there is no problem with you
being open and frank about your illicit activities, but why then do you call
yourself Starchild? How risky is it for you to say whatever you like on here
with your identity hidden? I am not trying to attack you at all, I just find
that a little curious and it's late and I am just trying to be devil's
advocate here...

It definitely is a blast, and we will be doing a show up there this year

We won't actually be on the Fair's land, but relatively close.  More info

The zippy thing is a result a communication between them and someone

Eugene for the fair, there will be a show; but as far as the show being a
Zippy `event' that's questionable.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Doesn't sound like a narc remark to me.

This brings us back to the discussion of things like - is everyone
obligated to dance all the time at a rave.

>and stormed
>off the dance floor--for awhile.  Mine was just a minor and
>random act of poetic terrorism

Maybe ya had to be there.  From what it is written here, you sound like
the one who is the moral neanderthal, not him.

If you don't like parties with bars serving drinks, don't go to them.
If you don't like cigarette smoke, only go to smoke-free parties.
If you don't like being stared at, stay in your bedroom.

>World's second oldest raver,

Maybe you should go on tour with the Zippies, it's just as pretentious.

respect to all,

You've been reading the posts . . . you've been agreeing/disagreeing/

NOW MEET THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE EMAIL ADDRESSES!!

A bunch of us know each other on sight, but a bunch of us don't,
so think about coming down to Friends and Family on Saturday
to see the humans behind the addresses!  It's fun / it's 
practically free ($3) / it's going to have a great soundsystem
and a REAL chill area for when you get tired of dancing or
for talking or meditation or just pure enjoyment of great ambient
tunes.

Oh yeah, and for everyone who posted and said "I'm so sorry I missed 
Laura at 'In the Light'" -- I'm fairly sure I'm spinning first so
get there at the beginning!  None of this "fashionably late" stuff:
you KNOW that Ethan, Bryce, and crew have their act together and
that the set-up will ocurr on time, but the party REALLY doesn't get 
going until people start showing up, so don't hesitate, come on
down at 10:00 pm!  If you get there at the beginning, you can also
catch a live performance by Weird Blinking Lights who are opening up
in the Chill Room. 

See you there!

Laura

Hey Hey Ken!

I got *you* out of the closet!  Whassamatter, bad
day Friday?  While I appreciate the trouble you
went to explaining language and spirituality to
me, I guess I am too much of a Cro-magnon to under-
stand your point.  What did I actually say that--
besides all the miniscule details you carp at--set
you off? And who the heck are you?  You've been
cyberlurking for long?  Must be slow at work if you
can come out like this this morning!

Question: did you understand the moral analogy between
sexual identity and entheogenic use?  Now, how
you answer *that* will show who's on the moral high 
road!

Ciao,
Willy

Subject: Re: breakbeat
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Breakbeat is most likely called breakbeat because it uses breaksbeats.  I
suspect that the Brits call it hardcore because breaks are nothing new, its
just a very hard fast form of breakbeat driven music.  I suspect many
Americans went straight from synth/drum machine house to hearing the British
hardcore sound and the most indentifiable element was the double-speed
breakbeats.  What's a break beat anyway?  It's the part of a song where
everone takes a break except the drummer(who didn't need to light up a cig
anyway.)  You know, James Brown says" Break it down" and the players slowly
drop out till you get that killer 2-bar break with just the drummer which is
perfect for sampling. The earliest disco DJs first started extending songs by
buying two copies of the record and alternating between the two to make the
break section go on and on and on - yeah.  Its the life blood of hip-hop and
most house, while often not using breaks,  was influeneced by the sound these
early DJs created.   Lots of the big anthemic, over-the-top tracks of the
late 80s/early 90s used breaks too.  The 33/45 thing has been going on for a
long time, but jungle/hardcore breakbeat went double-speed on the break often
accompanied by a dive-bomb near-subsonic sine tone bass and chipmunk vocals.
 The later stuff used insanely sliced up snippets of breaks (half a bar or
less at double, regular or other speeds) that usually don't start on the beat
the orginal break started on.  In a very long tradition of copying our
American talent, many of the British tracks get their breaks and sometimes
vocals off the latest hip-hop tracks.  Hope that helps.

Greetings Friends!

Aside from an obsessive compulsion to absolutely bury you in hype ;-) two
things have prompted me to issue this final invitation to Friends & Family.

The first is that numerous people have been sending me email asking for
details on a variety of topics; so I hope I can now answer all your
questions.

The second is that, last week, I noticed in the introduction to the
calendar that, counting both the calendar and the main list, there are now
more than 900 of us here! I personally know maybe 100 of you. So I thought
it might be nice tp provide, for the other 800 of you, some history -- the
context in which this party occurs and also introduce those of you who
don't already know us to the people involved in this party. 

Back in December on a lovely Sunday afternoon Bryce and I (and some of you)
threw the second of two indoor Liquid Airs at he 3rd Wave Dance House in
the mission. The first one had been very well attended and we had high
hopes for the second; it featured a great line-up, was in a wonderful
space, and had been (we thought) well promoted. 

Well, nobody came. We were very disappointed. So much so that we took our
dissapointment to the list expressing our belief that this "community" had
let us down by not supporting what we had intended to be a community and
specifically an *sfr* party. Needless to say this sparked an impassioned
debate on the list as to whether we (on this list) are in fact a community
or merely a group of people that use email like we use telephones, like we
use cars etc. 

Out of the untold *skads* of feedback we received, one thing became clear:
if you want to do a "community" party, you've got to actively *involve* the
community and in turn the community has to actively involve itself. I think
I can safely say that since then, Bryce and I have tried to let this idea
be the guiding light in our party coordinating efforts.

The next party that (the now greatly expanded) 'we' threw was the first
Friends & Family. As the name suggests it was intended to be, and was, a
massive celebration of this most intimate relation we share: friends,
family, community.

And what a night it was! For 12 solid hours the Blue Cube, nestled in the
heart of residential Noe Valley, *rocked hard* without *one* complaint.
Truly, that night we opened up and disappeared into a deep and acidic
ripple in spacetime...Down in the bassment laura's laser sparkled on the
sfr banner while upstairs in the kitchen live ambient trance, deep dub and
house bubbled among the salsa and the pretzels !-) Out on the porch,
shrouded in the densest fog I've ever seen, two didjeridoos added their
voices to the evening...all in all, well over 14 musicians/djs -- many from
sfr -- but others as well, played that night. So many people helped flier,
helped set up, brought lights, brought friends, brought their postitve
energy. Yeewoooow. What a party.

Lets do it again.

You,Me:Us:We: Friends & Family

When: Saturday, June 18th, 10pm til at least 7am
Where: Komotion: 16th at Folsom in SF -- *not* the Haze Theatre
Why: Because we love you :)
More info: 415.985.5244
Who's welcome: *Everyone*
What can you bring inside: *anything*
Cost: $3 benefits the space (Komotion) *entirely*
Dance Music: Laura, Alex, Lee, Ethan, Tamotsu, spun
Ambience: Weird Blinking Lights, Joe Rice, HDW, M, Ronan
Ambient Guided Visualisation: M & Ovid
Visuals & Lighting: Donovan, John Martinko, Sean Casey

Lots of you have been asking if you can bring fruit, toys, candy etc. The
answer is YES! YES! YES! *Please* bring lots of fruit, toys, candy,
positive energy, beanbags, pillows, cushions and other chill gear plus
anything else you think might be fun. Also, please dress in cool clothes
(No. temperature you geek ;-) boxers & brassiers recommended) and COME
EARLY!

And, one final note: WE NEED PEOPLE TO HELP SET UP! There're speakers that
need carrying, floors that need sweeping, couches that need moving, banners
that need hanging...we're going to get there around 6:00 to get started; if
you can come then or thereafter please let me know as soon as possible. 

On that subject: I need at least one person to volunteer to help me get the
sound system from bryce's (in SF) around 5:00pm; he's in SoCal til Saturday
and should his plane get delayed we'd be *screwed* as there's no way I can
lift those suckers myself...


We've done our absolute best to get as many people involved in this party
as possible, and I think the results are going to be spectacular! So
please, join us: bring your magic, your energy, your love and lets take
this party right off the deep end. I truly look forward to meeting all of
you there!

lots of love

Well, I am a new member to this list, but yes, you did 
flush me out. What is 'entheogenic' ?[its not in the dictionary
nor in the thesaurus]

the 'epiphany' part could be understood, in a fumbling sort
of way. In any case, a propensity to verbosity does not 
imply the validity of the argument(it usually muddles it), 
or for that matter hide the 'condescension' of the poster.
in other words, keep it simple. do you really think 
reading thru one of your confusing paragraphs leads to 
"moral high roads"????:)


But to revert to sfraves-list, since I am new to it, and dont know
yet, is asking for the location of the F &F inappropriate?


thanks to you all,
harsh deshmane
looking forward to a great weekend:)

You know, I really like discussing music, even if it is the questionable
pursuit of trying to define  genres.  I have yet to find a good list for
this(talking about the music we love, not defing genres.)  This list has so
much traffic that a continuous discussion of the music is probably too much,
the analogue synthesizer list is overly concerned with the equipment, the bpm
dj list strangely has very little on the actual content/intent of songs.  Is
there a list I'm missing?  I was looking for something more than, "I got the
new xxxxxx. It's really good, you should get it."  It really is possible to
discuss music with intelligence and depth, though sample snippets would be
cool.   This list does an amazing job of capturing the feel of the scene, a
seriously nebulous, hard-to-express entity if there ever was one, in text
format .

Subject: Re: breakbeat
Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

Breakbeat is most likely called breakbeat because it uses breaksbeats.  I
suspect that the Brits call it hardcore because breaks are nothing new, its
just a very hard fast form of breakbeat driven music.  I suspect many
Americans went straight from synth/drum machine house to hearing the British
hardcore sound and the most indentifiable element was the double-speed
breakbeats.  What's a break beat anyway?  It's the part of a song where
everone takes a break except the drummer(who didn't need to light up a cig
anyway.)  You know, James Brown says" Break it down" and the players slowly
drop out till you get that killer 2-bar break with just the drummer which is
perfect for sampling. The earliest disco DJs first started extending songs by
buying two copies of the record and alternating between the two to make the
break section go on and on and on - yeah.  Its the life blood of hip-hop and
most house, while often not using breaks,  was influeneced by the sound these
early DJs created.   Lots of the big anthemic, over-the-top tracks of the
late 80s/early 90s used breaks too.  The 33/45 thing has been going on for a
long time, but jungle/hardcore breakbeat went double-speed on the break often
accompanied by a dive-bomb near-subsonic sine tone bass and chipmunk vocals.
 The later stuff used insanely sliced up snippets of breaks (half a bar or
less at double, regular or other speeds) that usually don't start on the beat
the orginal break started on.  In a very long tradition of copying our
American talent, many of the British tracks get their breaks and sometimes
vocals off the latest hip-hop tracks.  Hope that helps.

I think I saw a flyer for Apocalypse declaring it to be a weekly
break-in party.  I'm pretty sure Apocalypse is more hardcore focused.
Someone, i think Laura, also pointed out that some of Jeno's stuff
approached breakbeat.

Ok, hardcoa techno fiends,

Finally, an outlet has appeared for hardcore techno.  Turbo Ted creates the
music right in front of your eyes.  The techno he creates is very good hardcore
techno, in my opinion.  It's on Tuesdays at 60 6th st. between Market & 
Mission.  It's $2.

The next time he'll be playing is Tuesday June 28th, and Tuesdays after that.
It starts at around 10pm and goes till he gets tired or 2am.  I went last time
and it felt like he was literally playing the music just for me for a while 
cause I was the only person on the dance floor for about 20 min.  There were 
about 10 people there.  I don't think the hardcore techno fiends have found 
out about this yet.

Another great weekend coming up - the highlight is the second
installment of Friends & Family; anyone who made it to (or heard
about) the first one won't want to miss this one.  Come down early, if
not to help set up, then to hear Laura :), or if not that, then to
make sure you get in, since it's not a huge place.  If you don't make
it in, Basics is the next best bet (has it been 2 years already?).
World Groove has some great acts and DJs, but it'll be more like a
Lollapalooza or Womad than a 'rave'.

Friends & Family pre-parties and after-parties :) - Pure Space, 
Inspirations, MESS/Vivid, The Hut and the full moon party...

I want to start this post by saying how much respect I have for anyone who 
legitimizes gay rights by "coming out of the closet" and putting themselves 
in a position of rejection and even possible violence for personal freedom.  
I would, however, have much less respect for someone who forces others 
"out" when they may not be ready.  This brings me to the point of naming a 
particular club as one where drugs are bought openly.  Now, the club owner,
the promoter as well as other club goers are thrown into a position that
they may not want to deal with especially with today's South of Market   
climate.  There are so many ways to show support for the legalization or 
decriminalization of drugs, i.e., starting or signing petitions, marching 
on City Hall/Washington, D.C. or writing letters to people who are in a
position to help.  Openly talking about paying $20 for a hit of MDMA after
getting in without valid ID as being a courageous way to make change, in my
opinion, is NOT.

Thanks, Janie, for focusing us on another--and 
immediately important--aspects of SOMA, clubs, cops
and closets! We hould clarify our intentions in communicating,
whether to ourselves or with others! While I know what I
am doing is not immoral, it is still illegal!  What a
paradox--just like it used to be what I was was a mortal
sin and a "crime against nature" in California courtts!  
I took the esoteric road, the inward path out, and it took
almost 50 years and I still see the cave opening only as an
occasional magic moment when ego becomes eco and harm
becomes herm. Perhaps the openly committed have to rant as
well as rave, eh?  Both "voices" are hard to hear, and I
admit I incline toward the path your message suggests, the
path of the heart, not just of the spirit *or* the soul,
a path that includes all, inclusiveness being the way of
karma.
Part I'm responding to most, from Janie:

There are so many ways to show support for the legalization or
decriminalization of drugs, i.e., starting or signing petitions, marching
on City Hall/Washington, D.C. or writing letters to people who are in a

Thanks, all!

Hey friend,
Sorry if my email caused any distress. I did not have any intention of
that happening. This is an apology, for flaming your flame on the mailing
list. I was wrong in doing that - I should have 1) kept my nose out of it.
2) emailed you personally.
once again, I am sorry for the unjustified attack..
hope to meet you at the F &F.

Well I think that the SFPD has demonstrated to some degree that they do not
have anything better to do...  Look at what is going on with the SOMA thing.
 If I were an investigative reporter for ABC or a cop whose job was to do
nothing but infiltrate the "evil" club/rave scene (which I am NOT) I might
catch on to a conection between the computer and the scene in SF.  The Net
will with out a doubt tell you at least what is going on and a little bit
about who's who.  It would certianly be easier than actually doing it the old
way...  Well in truth I do not really think that SF Raves is a big thing to
these people but it would seem that if they were smart and wanted to know
what was going on this would not be a bad place to start.  I mean these
people (reporters and cops) have been known to go thru peoples trash and love
it... I do agree with you that openess could help bring down these really
lame laws.  I have thought long and hard about ways to dissmantle the current
system that puts out these neggative commandments.  Taking out these laws
would in my view be a very good thing...  personally I believe that it is
drug laws and not drugs that cause most of the "scurge of drugs".  I will
stand by my origional point which was that I think that even though it is
good to be public, sometimes it is just as good to not show all of your cards
just yet.  More than my thinking about the police I worried that you were
spreading the word that Spundae was a club who let in minors.  Of course if
they did then that is there own fault, but because I would rather the place
remain open I would not try to swamp the place with minors who heard they
could get in thus putting Spundae at risk even if it was by there own
stupidity.  On a different slant of Spundae...  I was thinking about how
Spundae has lost a lot of it's origional more friendly crowd...  I mean the
crowd is still great as far as most club clubs go but it might make things a
little bit fresher if more SF Ravers started showing up.  No I don't work at
Spundae although I may be performing at Spundae latter this summer I'll let
you know.  8 )

 RE: Outer Rhythm Records , a techno vinyl store in West San Jose 

 Scott Nozawa recommended this store in a recent posting - I was just 
there today , and I'll have to eagerly second his recommendation! They 
seem to have a lot of the latest vinyl , including GAK , Future
Sound Of London's Lifeform , The Dust Brother's "My Mercury Mouth" ,
Courtney Nielsen & DJ Spun's "Central Fire" on Twitch Records , and
other stuff. Finally , a good techno vinyl source in San Jose! 

 Three previewing turntables for the customers, and a friendly staff
( at least the guy I talked to was OK ).

 The store itself is very unobtrusive , and mislabelled to boot! It used
to be a car stereo installation and sales store , and the old sign
is still on the roof ( "Mobile Audio" or some such ). It's at 
368 South Bascom Avenue , a few doors south of the notorious Pink
Poodle strip club , near the intersection of Bascom Avenue and San 
Carlos . They're open until 9PM Mon - Fri , until 8PM on the weekends
( call ahead to confirm these hours ).
 

 The ironic thing is - I used to live in the house behind the store -
but I've just moved out! I live in Sunnyvale now - but San Jose is still
closer than San Francisco or Berkeley. I'll be doing most of my shopping
for vinyl at Outer Rhythm before I try up north.

Subject: NETherworld *update* 2.0 - song selection is done

i am proud to announce the song line-up for the upcoming NETherworld tape-
there was so much high quality stuff sent to me that i am still in awe!so,
without further ado, the NETherworld lineup (in no particular order):

1. axon "pygme up"
2. symbion project "the infinite number of truths that remain to be discovered"
2. method one "new day"
4. john sweeney "phylum"
5. logarithmic sound source "biogene" (genesplice mix)
6. glowball "tripping backwards"
7. induction "106"
8. audio tribe "vision quest"
9. offworld "etheria"
10.kingsize "cocopuff"
11.tintinnabulation "mantis"
12.1.8.7. "jungleman" (wicked jungle mix)
13.sean simmen "blue skies"
14.francois dion "geoide"

i think there might also be a song from one of taylor's projects, but like an id
   iot i forgot to mail him.....so im not sure aboout it

due to space limitations, iwasn't able to use all the songs sent to me-to
all who didn't get in, dont worry....there will be a netherworld 2 at some
point :)

to all those who DID get in-there are a few things i need from you:
1. i need a good copy of the song that was accepted.-completly produced, on
no less than a type II (high bias) cassette. unfortunatly, i wont have
access to a DAT machine like i first planned...but i can make high quality
tape copies, so if you send a good-sounding cassette to me, the song will
still sound good in the comp. now, if you think that the version you sent
me already is produced well enough, let me know and you wont have to send
me a new tape. remember, you are basically responsibe for how your tracks sound,
so make sure it is good :)

2. for the tape insert, i need a mini bio from all of you: name, song title,
e-mail and snail mail addresses, people involved, and all that. feel free
to add any other info, like shout outs, equipment list, sayings, proverbs,
whatever you want to say...just dont make it too long (about a good paragraph)

3. please get me the master copies AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!i wanna actually
stArt producing these things in say, mid july

	I am really glad to see someone else tackle the drug issue 
headon.  The comparison Starchild has made of talking about drugs and 
talking about homosexuality in an open forum backs up my firm standing on 
the issue:  just because drugs are "illegal" does not mean they are 
"wrong".  I believe the fundamental problem with the drug issue is that 
too many people have been fooled into believing that drugs=wrong=lack of 
family values=have to get rid of drugs because they are what is wrong 
with our society today.  

	If you check your history books, people throughout time have 
"broken the law" because what they believed in was more important.  In 
the pre-Civil war years, the underground railroad "illegally" freed 
thousands of slaves and brought them to the North.  The masters had full 
legal rights to go reclaim their property.  Was this freeing of people 
from oppression "right" or "wrong"?  That question is up to each 
individual to answer for themselves.  However you choose to answer that 
question, though, you still cannot escape from one fact.  People who 
cared enough about the well-being of others broke the law to protect 
them; more importantly, enough people (or at least the right ones) said 
this law was wrong and abolished slavery.  

	There are many other examples in history where people 
broke the law to stand up for what they believe in.  The women's 
movement, the Civil Rights Movement, Ghandi and his followers are some 
examples.  What about the complete disregard in this country of 
Prohibition?  Do you really think anyone who liked drinking alcohol in 
those times were going to stop drinking just because the government 
suddenly said it was wrong?  

	Anyway, I seem to have much more to say about this subject, but 
rather than make this a 10-page email that you probably won't read, I 
will make this message as short as a "sound bite".  I hope I've made my 
point about this.  We cannot go around fearing what the government will 
do to us, although we don't want to go right up to the law and spit in 
its face.  Times are changing.  I can see it around me.  People are 
realizing that drugs are no big deal for the most part, and the more you 
restrict people from doing them, the more they will want to do them.  

Look for future articles from me, deepfog.

though some would say jeno's breakbeat isn't truly representative because 
it isn't fast enough.

I agree.  DJ EFX definately used to spin some breakbeat, chipmunks and 
all back when he had a radio show on "wild" 107.somethingorother.  He 
seems to spend more time in the studio than behind the decks these days, 
but he might he might be worth seeking out if he comes around.

Since the dawn of human knowledge, we homosapiens have been trancing out
to music, feeling our conenctiveness to the forces and cycles of nature, 
becoming conscious of how these forces also exist within ourselves;
forces that have meaning beyond the limits of our lives, like spirituality.
Ultimately, there is no difference between science and spirituality, no
difference between raving and being connected to the essence of existence.
It all comes down to how aware we want to be about it.  

SFRavers come from all walks of life, and this is one of the things that 
makes this information crossroad a unique and enriching, as well as 
volatile, place to interact.  We are very fortunate to have Ovid Jacob
amongst us, a Theoretical Physicist from Stanford.  I'd like to encourage 
any knowledge seekers or reality surfers out there to participate in the 
visualization and discussion Ovid plans to lead at Friends & Family this 
Saturday.  In addition to getting his Phd. in Physics from  Princeton 
University, Ovid is well versed in various world religions and 
philosophies, and has given talks on some of these topics.  My 
understanding is that rather than explore the intricacies of Physics, we 
will be taken on a journey that will explore some of the modes of thinking 
and experience that surround our connections to science, philosophy and 
raving.  

Ovid will probably be a little annoyed at me for this post, for he insists
that this is not about him at all, nor does he feel that knowing about
his "credentials" are important.  But I just wanted to make sure that 
people understood that this will not just be the ramblings of a space cadet 
on a soapbox.  With M Normal providing an ambient backdrop, this will be an 
opportunity for us to combine the rave experience with an exercise in mind 
expansion; sometime between 3 and 4am in the chill room of Friends & Family.

EFX moved on to KMEL.  He sometimes mixes on Fri/Sat nights, playing acid jazz.

Also, on the subject of what's breakbeat, how about Prodigy?

Anyone got a disco ball of any size (even teeny tiny, christmas ornament
size) that they could bring to F&F? I Want to bounce Laura's little laser
off it in the chill room  :)

thanks in advance

The top of my head might work, but I don't think I can sit still that long.

hi lee,
gee, don't know what to say. i will try to say some reasonably coherent things
on sat.. i hope your mentioning my scientific training won't lead people to
 think that this will be some sort of 'lecture'. i really hope to keep it as a
performance, with a strong 'artistic' component. a sort of 'trip' of
consciousness/spirituality (psuchoalckemy) with stops on the 'left' and
'right' side of the brain.
meet you all on the hyperplane of gaia,
take care/shalom

I saw at a party I was at that a bunch of old useless CDs were hung
by strings from the ceiling.  Perhaps if you were to do that and have
a little fan blowing them around, you might see a cool effect.  
Just a thought.

I think the idea is to move around, so you might serve as a qualified

Well folks, things are looking like there won't be a free Corduroy City
show this evening.  It was a very last minute idea, and things aren't
coming together in a very cohesive manner.

If things change for the better at the last minute I'll be sure and let you
know.  Otherwise I might head out to Sacramento to check things out there.

Have a great weekend evryone!  I hope to see some of you at F&F.

important revision to the F&F DJ schedule:

It's been a few days but we wanted to thank all you ravers who came to 
the party here during the Haight st fair...so thank you.  Spiral jive set 
up the sound in the back yard and it was pumping--We even had some crazed 
lunatic neighbor run out onto the street in his underwear demanding all 
of us out back under arrest--Luckily OFFICER GANNON was on our side that 
day.  Allen & I spent most of the day at the ameba booth BUT Bahg, DRC, 
Tracy and Garth spun and the vibes are still floating around out there.  
The profit from the party went to the Haight Ashbury free clinic--and 
they thanked us so we're thanking you.  Later on the party moved to the 
I-Beam where David spun a mind blowingly superb set...Basically, all I 
gotta say is Mark Metz knows how to throw a party.  RAVE RAVE RAVE.  Love 
you all.  Peace Love :0  :)  :(  :)  :)  :) and lots of joy  :)  :)  :)

I'll be there along with The Freak Out! and Shake Your Booty Sound System
possie. I guess I'll be wearing a black SLAP t-shirt with black shorts and
Adidas. I might be wearing some rediculous rave accessories but that depends
on my frame of mind Saturday night.

See ya all there -

	Ok, listen everyone, Mother Earth on June 17th was a great party. 
It was just the kind of party that doesn't come around too often, and the
best part about it was it was GOON-FREE. 

	Of course, there were many other good things about it, too.  The
location was great.  An undisclosed location somewhere north of the now
world renowned Bonny Doon sat the sound system on a little clearing next
to the cliffs about 400 feet above the beach.  The view was spectacular
here, folks, and the nice thing about it was you could walk right from the
dance floor to the cliffs to watch the waves come in.  The waves were
really small from our bird's eye view.    

	The music was typical sfrave music at its best.  When I got there
at 5:15 (right when the sun was cracking), it was thumpin house, and then
about a half hour later when I started to get tired (no pick-me-ups for
fog today), a couple of dj's (maddie told me one of them was drew) did
some killer mixes of trippy acidhouse with lots of percussionary beats and
other stuff.  That woke me up real quick.  I thought the soundsystem was
really nice, too.  It sounded really clear for the amount and size of the
speakers.  

	I think the people was what topped it off.  When we were walking 
to the party (and believe me, we walked quite a way to get there) we 
could tell it was going to be a good party just because of the size and 
the type of people.  Jason said it reminded him of the full moons he went 
to when he first started going:  35, 40 people at the most.  Good vibes.  
Smiling people, attitude free.  Everyone may or may not have been on e.  
It didn't matter, because everyone was just happy there and COEXISTING 
with their neighbors (isn't that what we are all raving for?)  :)  It was 
really nice for me to see a fellow raver picking up trash at our party 
site.  Another guy was handing out incense to everyone.  People have 
always been the most important part of a rave, and this crowd was great.  
I don't run around meeting people as much as I used to when I first 
started partying (my first was Sharon in Sept or Oct 1991), but I mostly 
just smiled back at people here.  Reminds me of the old days.  

	So anyway, this party was just right.

Just more of these forwards... if you know your mail From: header
is going to be different, please let me know or change your
address on the list.

Before they begin, though, I thought I would let you know that 
techno.stanford.edu is going away.  Stanford is finally asking
to reclaim their Sparc 1+ and the disk space and processing power
the list and the archive takes up.  Fortunately, we don't have to
scramble for a new home, as a long-time dream of mine is about to
come true - I will be setting up a machine on the net entirely
my own in about 2 weeks called hyperreal.com, and its sole mission
will be to support hypermedia development in the online community
(ew, that reeked of cliche terms, but it's true! :)  The SFRaves
list will live there (in fact, I may be able to CNAME it to 
sfraves.org :) as will the IDM list, and the related sublists - 
the archive will also be there, and I'll be able to give out a
few accounts to people willing to maintain parts of the archives
and put up projects of their own.  It won't be a for-profit machine,
if I do any revenue-generation on it it'll go into paying for
the capital costs and upkeep.  It'll be connected to the net via
T1 from the Little Garden, sharing bandwidth with Wired Magazine.
I'm putting a down payment on the machine tomorrow - a Pentium
with 16 megs of memory and 2 gig drive running BSDI - and I should
have it fully online in two weeks.

I'll send out details and move the list over when it's up and stable.
Until then, if you have some web-related non-commercial (though if
you're a commercial artist it might be okay) projects you'd like to
put up on the web, or have ideas for new web-related software you'd
like to work on, develop them and as hyperreal comes online let me
know if you want an account.  There are some Very Interesting Guests
lined up for the system, too.  :)

Anyways, on with the forwards.

-- Please distribute widely.

	After many months of planning, thinking, frustration, and hard
work, Community ConneXion: The NEXUS-Berkeley is now on-line and ready
to begin its work.
	We've been thinking and dreaming about this for the past two
years. Finally we've made it into a reality.

	Community ConneXion (c2, c^2, or c-squared) has been founded
in order to build up a strong community in the internet both locally
and globally. We are linked into the worldwide NEXUS-Gaia movement
which is building up a worldwide community of like-minded
network-oriented individuals.

	We've realized that the internet is not about the protocols
nor the universities nor the corporations nor the politics which form
the basic infrastructure. All these things are merely the
facilitators, the parts which come together to produce the whole; the
internet is about people communicating and making connections with
each other-- forming the social infrastructure.
	We've appeared in order to facilitate these connections.

	We've setup shop here in the SF Bay Area and we will integrate
virtuality and reality. It is possible for virtual communities to
merge into, supplement, and sometimes even create "real"
flesh communities.

	In order to build up this community we've put some computers
on the internet and have started offering services. These are quality
services provided at a low cost, with an emphasis on community
involvement. We emphasize privacy because there can be no strong
community where people fear their neighbors. By allowing people to
selective reveal themselves, we make easier for them to break down the
walls of prejudice which come between people in social interactions.

	We're offering mailboxes, shell accounts, anonymous remailing
services, ftp space, domain names, mail exchanging, strong
psuedonymous identities, and more as time goes on.
	We're building up a barter-coupon system so that volunteers
who help our community can earn credits to use to buy more services
from our system or, as the NEXUS-Gaia project grows, from Nexi around
the world. The barter-coupon system is implemented using a secure and
private anonymous digital cash scheme.
	We're asking for help from people to build our community. It
can't be done with only a few people. Everyone involved can help out
to build the system. A community is a group effort. As we build the
community we improve our lives.

	For more information and to sign up, use your favorite
World-Wide-Web browser to look at http://www.c2.org or, if you don't
have access to a WWW browser, telnet to c2.org and login as
"guest". Most services are offered with an initial two week free trial
period.

That pretty much sums it up, Maui!  For anyone who's interested, that 
book is available at Freedom's Forum Books, 1800 Market St. & Octavia, 
S.F.  (Yeah, this is a little bit of a plug -- they occasionally employ 
me -- but they have lots of other great titles too, you should check it out.)

 last night i was in the perfect mood to go a party because i spent hours
geeking, and heard lots of things about about our scene. then i headed out
to a party that was free, outdoors, and just across town from me. wait...
it gets better. when i got to the party (around 5:00 or so) i was so
entranced by the 180 view of the horizon that it took me a while to notice
that there were no tanks hissing, no flyers/garbage on the ground.  we
were a group of about 50 or less, dancing, pumping out energy, feeling the
music inside...we got down! to me this party was a real treat because i
had never heard any of the dj's w/ the exception of scottie. the sound
system was perfect - living up to its name. the music flowed out of the
speakers which balanced the bass and treble very well. in short, the 
party was simple and beautiful.

	mother earth afterparty?...friends & family or basics?...  my
choice is the least expensive party (how can you beat $3?) well see you
all tonight :) :) :) (: (: (:  jason davis.

Dear Tamara, 

    That's a reasonable question, but actually the issue of my identity 
online being "hidden" by not using my legal name never occured to me.  I
guess I pretty much assume it would be easy enough in our hi-tech world
for anyone who really wants to track me down to do so.  I certainly don't
keep a bunch of phony passports and Swiss bank account numbers around the 
house (although I'd like to, if anyone has any extras - :) ) I go by 
Starchild off the net too, it's not just a computer handle, although I 
realize it sounds like one. 
    My philosophy is that it makes more sense to name yourself than to 
simply use a name chosen by your parents when they knew little about you, 
and when you might not even have much in common with them.  Of course 
changing your name is a hassle if your're used to being called one thing, 
and perhaps even more of a hassle for others to get used to, so I don't 
go by Starchild with my family and longtime friends who've known me by my 
birthname, unless they seem conducive to "Starchild."  And I don't 
usually go by Starchild on the job, again unless people seem receptive to 
it.  Unfortunately there are a lot of people in our society who are not 
yet enlightened enough to respect someone's choice of an unusual, or some 
would say "silly" name.
    The oddity & silliness of my name, however, are two of the things 
which endear it to me.  When people ask, I'll usually mention that it is 
a "ravename", or a name which grew out of my experience of going to 
raves, which is mostly true.  Although I used it sporadically online & 
such before I raved, I doubt I'd be calling myself Starchild now if I'd 
never attended a rave.  I've since met other people with "ravenames", and 
it always gives me a positive glow to meet them, as I recognize them as 
persons who, like myself, are in a small yet important way, poking at the 
fringes of what society considers "normal".
    Just like it's hard to take yourself too seriously when you're 
dressed like a Dr. Seuss character, it's hard to take yourself too 
seriously when you have a name like Starchild, or for that matter, R.U. 
Sirius, Wavy Gravy, DJ Fiasco, Captain Crunch, "Weird Al" Yankovic, "leg 
of eel", or many others I could name...
    I strongly suspect that if everyone took themselves a bit less 
seriously, the world might be a better place.

READ AND REPLY ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!
_______________________________________________________________________________
UPDATE:18 JUN 1994 

e  l  e     m  e  n  t: step 1


   OK folks, stuff is starting to roll.  We've received some submissions
for our free bi-monthly journal/magazine (net version and real physical
paper). Step 1 is due to come out nationally at the beginning of July, but
WE WANT MORE!!!!!!!!!! We want you to be a part of it!!!!! We know you're
out there....
   This is a sum up and update of what's up, with some technical specs. 
   If you read our first post you should know what kind of stuff we're
looking for but we will sum up here:


   *ele ment* is an attempt to bridge the gap between disciplines as far-
ranging as Detroit tekno, computer-aided design, John Waters movies,
skateboarding, and post-constructivist architecture (these are just a few
examples, among many).  It is a dialog between all the shit we're trying to
get together, from San Fran to London, all around and in between.  It's
about everything: what we're doing, what we're seeing, what we're thinking.
It's about the past, too, and how we can learn from it in the face of the
new millenium.
   Submissions can be ANYTHING legibly written or typed, on any subject, or
any theme.  It could be a review of your favorite record from 6 months ago
or 60 years ago. It could be a cool anthropology paper you wrote last
quarter.  It can be a poem, a photo, a CAD design, an editorial, a
diatribe, a letter, and so on.  
   
   All we ask is that you keep a couple of things in mind while considering
what to give us.  
   1) We plan to distribute nationally, in a selective manner such as
Camera Work in the 1900s or Emigre today (1000-1500 copies).  It's going to
look very nice!  We're using decent paper (slightly off-white stock) with
ring-binders (trust us, these look good and they are very distinctive).
This will be "coffee-table" material, or close to it, so we want quality
material that takes a world-wide perspective if possible.  
   For example, a friend of ours in Nashville wanted to write something
about his dance/rave (hate that word) scene.  We suggested he do something
like write it from the perspective of someone explaining the trials and
tribulations of trying to get that type of scene off the ground (as opposed
to just saying "Nashvlle sucks!").  We also scoured some women's studies
classes to get the female perspective known (there seems to be an unequal
balance of men on the electronic airwaves...). 
   Top ten lists should be avoided, unless they're informative.  If you can
make one like "my 10 faves of the last 6 months and WHY" that would be much
better than just a list with no descriptions or anything (notice that the
WHY is what we're more interested in).
   2) We want crazy amounts of diversity, in text and design.  It's your
opportunity to "design your own page."  Here's what's been decided on that
subject:
        
        -page size is 7.5 x 10 inches vertical.
        -radical is good (think Dada, Starn twins, or the new Creem...)
        -text or written entries that have not been pre-designed will be
distributed to other designers we know, or sometimes one of us (depends who
wants it!)
        -the only linking element besides maybe a "key" approach to the
reviews section (ie lump all reviews together and identify by a key code)
will be a small logo on the bottom of each page, unless your submission
specifies otherwise.
        -you have the option of telling us NOT to proofread your piece, if
your interest is in making anal grammarians cringe.
        -we'll print nearly all the submissions we get (unless they totally
ignore what we've said so far) so your chances of getting in with the
minimum of interference from us is like 90.25% or something. 
        
ADVERTISING:
We're trying to keep this minimal, to keep things clean and uncluttered,
but we will consider an ad if we can see it or talk to you first. This
being our 1st step we are offering dirt cheap prices, to cover our costs a
bit.
        
        -1/4 page is $15.00, 1/2 page is $30.00, full page is $60.00.
        -remember that the page size is 7.5 x 10 inches vertical.

THAT'S IT! Pretty simple recipe, actually. This mag is really made by YOU,
with us here to help corall things into a nice package. It may look
hodgey-podgey in the end, but that's OK--because, if you look at us and the
variety of our situations and influences, we look pretty hodgey-podgey
ourselves.



LAST LAST LAST DEADLINE is JUN 28 1994!!!!!!!!!!!

APOLOGY ON THE SHORT NOTICE, BUT...
We posted this on MWRaves a while ago, while forgetting everyone else.  If
you cannot get a submission to us on time send it anyway.  We'll put it in
step 1 if we can, or wait and put it in step 2 in September. 

It's up to YOU to make this happen.

hope to hear from you soon,

	-- Community ConneXion: The NEXUS-Berkeley is now on-line --

-- Please distribute widely.

	After many months of planning, thinking, frustration, and hard
work, Community ConneXion: The NEXUS-Berkeley is now on-line and ready
to begin its work.
	We've been thinking and dreaming about this for the past two
years. Finally we've made it into a reality.

	Community ConneXion (c2, c^2, or c-squared) has been founded
in order to build up a strong community in the internet both locally
and globally. We are linked into the worldwide NEXUS-Gaia movement
which is building up a worldwide community of like-minded
network-oriented individuals.

	We've realized that the internet is not about the protocols
nor the universities nor the corporations nor the politics which form
the basic infrastructure. All these things are merely the
facilitators, the parts which come together to produce the whole; the
internet is about people communicating and making connections with
each other-- forming the social infrastructure.
	We've appeared in order to facilitate these connections.

	We've setup shop here in the SF Bay Area and we will integrate
virtuality and reality. It is possible for virtual communities to
merge into, supplement, and sometimes even create "real"
flesh communities.

	In order to build up this community we've put some computers
on the internet and have started offering services. These are quality
services provided at a low cost, with an emphasis on community
involvement. We emphasize privacy because there can be no strong
community where people fear their neighbors. By allowing people to
selective reveal themselves, we make easier for them to break down the
walls of prejudice which come between people in social interactions.

	We're offering mailboxes, shell accounts, anonymous remailing
services, ftp space, domain names, mail exchanging, strong
psuedonymous identities, and more as time goes on.
	We're building up a barter-coupon system so that volunteers
who help our community can earn credits to use to buy more services
from our system or, as the NEXUS-Gaia project grows, from Nexi around
the world. The barter-coupon system is implemented using a secure and
private anonymous digital cash scheme.
	We're asking for help from people to build our community. It
can't be done with only a few people. Everyone involved can help out
to build the system. A community is a group effort. As we build the
community we improve our lives.

	For more information and to sign up, use your favorite
World-Wide-Web browser to look at http://www.c2.org or, if you don't
have access to a WWW browser, telnet to c2.org and login as
"guest". Most services are offered with an initial two week free trial
period.

Hello all!

Thanks for coming to Friends and Family and making it a HUGE 
RIP-ROARING SUCCESS!

The most amazing thing to me was how quickly the party got going. 
I'd encouraged people to get there at the beginning, and they did!  
The floor was well-occupied and dancing hard well before 11pm.  
Sometimes DJs don't like to go first because people often don't
straggle into parties until two hours after the announced start
time, but Friends and Family got up and going right away.

The people who run Komotion were GREAT and looked like they
were having fun, too.

A huge hand goes to the set-up crew who really made the space
special, from sweeping the floor to hanging lights and banners
to moving furniture and gear around.  When 10pm came around you
all had the place more than ready to open up for fun.

I'm sorry I left a bit after 4, but I had a house guest from
the UK who doesn't club or rave and I had to get back so I could
wake up Sunday to spend some time with him.

So once again *thanks* for the great music, the great setting,
the great dancing, the great party.  It took every single person
who came, from those dropping by to dance for a bit to those who 
stayed to the end and cleaned up to make the night as great as it 
was.  I met a number of sfravers whom I'd only known as email 
addresses or who have been lurking, that really made the night 
special for me.

Laura

P.S.  Next Up:  MetroVision goes HARDCORE (in both the Brooklyn and
UK sense of the word) -- Bryce, Lee An, and I got together and decided 
we are going to pull out our old breakbeat, gabber, Rotterdam, and German 
acid records and go forth on the industrial speedy noise tip.  If you've 
ever wondered . . . stay tuned for details.

 Good Hot Sweat At Friends and Family!

 I got to Club Kommotion at about 11:30PM , too late to hear Laura , so
I started the night with Ethan laying down some great music. 

 To get to the dancefloor , I walked through the "ambient hallway" where 
the ambient DJ turntables and equipment was set up. This was where Weird
Blinking Lights did their performance , and Ovid later did his feedback-
plaugued spoken piece with audio stage setting by M Normal. 

 The posted advice about wearing shorts was accurate - it was definitely
humid & hot! I wore my shorts under my pants , so it was easy to change
to a cooler mode. But it was so warm that I eventually took my checkered
Goofy t-shirt off my chest and pulled it back over my forehead , pharoah
style. It was the first time that I've done the bare-chested thing at a
party - there's much to recommend it!

 I don't think I'd go as far as one fellow - a slim guy with dirty-blond
shoulder length hair and short beard. The first I noticed him , I
thought he had a strange skin-tight set of leggings on with a dark
design at his crotch. The next glimpse , I realized that he was naked
- "skin-tight" indeed! Nobody I know seemd to be overly bothered by him
or harrasing him , I think he even got some encouraging remarks.

 Next to the DJ was a small table with florescent paints and a day-glo 
Slinky (tm). I had a lotta fun playing with that slinky ; by the way ,
later on in the evening , I saw a group of three huge football-linemen
types leaving the club , and one of them had the slinky. Since he seemed
to be about 3 times my body mass , I let him go by ...

 Lots of day-glo fun , with people playing with green glowing string, and
painting designs on themselves. Of course , there was soap bubble solution
as well ( thanks to Sean? ), which JUMP IN THE FIRE and Sean put to good
use later , when they found a good spot for the fan breezes to carry the
shiny bubbles over the crowd.
 
 The selection of DJs provided the dancers with a good variety of music,
techno and house. And all the DJ's doing it for free! Thanks! ( By the way,
did the benefit make enough money for the club ? ).

 Mucho SFRavers there : Maui , good to see that you were able to make it!
Welcome back Susie ( how long were you gone? ).Will Penna brought more
rave newbies from Santa Cruz - how did they like it? Scott N. - it was
kind of dim there - that was Loren with you , wasn't it? The only SFRaver
that I didn't notice there was Capt'n Crunch (?). Hello to everybody else I
didn't mention.

 This Friends and Family party reminded me of my third rave - Vortex ,
that was in a small warehouse outside of San Francisco. They both had
good vibes aplenty, a humble setting, and a hot, humid atmosphere. I'm
looking foreward to more of 'em!

Hot sweat indeed!  You know the party is good when you can't lean against
the wall because of the moisture condensing... :)

But thanks to the airplane-propellor fans, the air circulated enough to
make it quite enjoyable.

I apologize about this - the problem was that M's minimalist ambient
music had at times a slow surge in the same frequency range as the 
feedback frequency - so it was very hard to tune just right.  Apologies
to anyone who got blasted.  BTW, I hope transcripts are made available! :)

I had a great time, too.  Congrats to all - you know who we are :)

Greetings, Ravers!

I had the most amazingly good time and friends and family--it was such a 
delight to see so many people having such a good time!  i had been working
lots of overtime in orange county for a client for most of the week prior,
and drove back on saturday.  i was really quite tired, but committed to
setting up the sound in the ambient hallway.  after helping set up and 
whatnot, i lay down on a couch in the lounge around 10ish.  i remember 
hearing a bit of scuffling and what not.  i got up around 10:20 or so,
and wandered into the dance room and saw quite a few people there already.
i was really very surprised to see so many people dancing so soon--although
i had said on the voice mail that we were to start at "a real 10 o'clock",
so many parties don't seem to take off until midnight, or even 2AM.  effandeff
was going full tilt, it seemed, right from the start....and stayed going full
blast until almost 6AM!

wowzee!  this was one of the most amazingly good times i've had in a long
while...everybody's energy just carried me through the night.  i just woke
up (it's about 2:30AM on monday morning) from an extended sleep...that's
how tired my body was.  komotion is a great space.  i heard from ethan that
komotion made what they needed, and more! at the door.  thanks again to
everyone who contributed financially to komotion's benefit...they really
appreciated it, and i'm sure they'd thank you all personally.  i loved the
entire setup.

for me, i knew we had gone over the top when:  i was fiddling with Sound
Vision during ethan's set.  i heard something hit the floor, and looked 
over to see what it was....i was sitting on the floor (pre-condensation),
and only glanced, but it was someone's clothes.  i saw a bare body, and
KNEW that we had achieved a real comfort zone that i've *never* experienced
at a house party in san francisco.  i've seen it happen at faery parties,
but never at "generic" parties.  i was really happy that everyone was
so comfortable (and, hot!) that this was ok.

i loved the lasers, and donovan's light show, and the art work, and all the
DJ sets, and all the folks who came by to dance and hang out with us.  i 
really look forward to more good times with you all!  i really wish that i
had had more energy and time to hang out with you all, and i'm looking
to the next one so i can do that.  thanks, everyone, for taking another
SFR party over the top!

Everytime an SFRaves party goes down I keep thinking "wow this is amazing
I can't believe how incredible and perfect this is." Yet they keep getting
better and bigger.

I'm glad that Kommotion is nearby because it really was perfect space.
I don't mind the heat as long as smoke is kept out of the hot area- which
it was. All of the DJs and sound were excellent. The Kommotion staff were
very accomodating and friendly. Everything was great.

The only complaint that I have is that even though i had "RSN8" painted
on my shirt in glow-in-the-black-light letters, I didn't meet any of
your LURKERS out there!

Weird Blinking Lights (my emusic ensemble) played from 12-1 and I had
a blast! everything sounded *perfect*. The electronics behaved themselves
and the lights kept blinking. I do have a DAT of that set and a portion
of it may be on the next WBL CD.

Nice underwear, ETHAN!

It was crazy, it was wild, it was out of control! This was no house
party, this was a RAVE!

People showed up early, and kept the place packed with about 200
people all night long. The music was outstanding. Tomatsu was
especially on, relentlessly making me dance even though I wanted to
sit down :).

Here's what $3 bought you:

Great dance and ambient DJs, live music, toys, banners, lasers,
visuals, two bathrooms, a party that started 1/2 hour EARLY, a
beautiful altar with free fruit, ins-&-outs, friendly doorpeople, free
water, body paint, the storm-O-bubbles (tm), lots of fans (we told you
it'd be hot), no police, and a smooth running crazy wild fun party all
night long.

And not only did the party pay for itself, it made enough money to
save the space.

Many thanks to everyone who made this party happen. It was a truly
cooperative effort, everyone had a part in it.

We'd just finished dropping off the sound system afterwards, and I
said to Ethan:

"You know, you can't buy [a vibe] like that."

He said, "And you can't sell it either. You can only give it away."

:)

Well, you know it would take a lot for me to miss F&F II, but I was
previously engaged with the Grateful Dead shows in Eugene . . . and
I must say they delivered beyond expectations!  Great scene, great
weather Saturday and Sunday after we got drenched during the show
on Friday.  I don't think the sound system from Seattle ever showed
up, and I didn't bring my records anyway due to a mixup on my ride
down (I ended up taking the bus from Portland at 5 am Friday morning!).
And the Dead delivered one of their longest and best shows in years
yesterday!  We even had a rainbow directly overhead during the show --
a friend of mine tells me that's called a 'sundog' -- never even heard
of such a thing before . . .

I'm very pleased to hear how well things went at Kommotion.  This is the
kind of event that's going to head us into new directions  . . . 
props to EVERYONE for doing it!!

see you in the future

Good Morning SFR! 

(he, he; just call me rumplestilskin).

WOW! What a party :) This one exceeded my wildest dreams; it was, I think,
everything we wanted it to be, and then some...

You know, I often say to people, "Thanks, we couldn't have done it without
you" and I think that we're so used to hearing this phrase that it's
meaning goes right by us. So I want to pay special attention to that phrase
now. We could not have done it without *you*: the people that showed up at
6pm, spent the next *4* hours setting up, danced all night and then helped
us clean up and take the gear home; everyone that brought decorations and
alters and helped make the space beautiful; everyone that came and danced
and smiled and helped create the *vibe*, all the djs and musicians,
speakers, thinkers, dreamers, and nude guys ;-) You *all* helped make this
a really special night that will bring a smile to my face and warm glow to
my soul as long as I live. Good job.

I also want to extend special thanks to all the folks at Komotion.
Unfortunately, one of the things that commerializes our scene is the fact
that spaces cost money (and big spaces cost big money). From the get go
Komotion was willing to do this party on a very low cost, no-cash-up-front,
whatever-happens-is-cool basis. This kind of attitude, this vibe is what it
takes to do Saturday night parties with all the trimmings for $3. However,
what I treasure most about Komotion's attitude is that it contains
something I place special value on: trust. The real bonus is that we lived
up to the trust they placed in us. We gave them an awesome demonstration of
just how good a job, we as a community can do and, more importantly, what,
exactly, the acid house vibe is all about. And guess what: They loved it!
Without a doubt they had as good a time as we did and, not surprisingly,
they want to do it again :)

Music was killer all night long. Laura already a good vibe goin when I took
the decks and, despite spending 5-10 minutes in the twilight zone (weird) I
had a pretty good time. Lee pulled off the best and longest mix into Circus
Bells I've ever heard and generally cooked us with nice, hard, acidic,
tribal trance. Alex spent a little longer in the twilight zone than I did
but soon settled down and and as usual unleashed the kind of music you'll
be hard pressed to find anywhere else in SF. Having not heard Tamotsu in 6
months I have to confess to being *blown away*; Tamostsu, you shred! I hope
you get the exposure you deserve! Spun had a hard time escaping world
groove and so arrived at us a bit (too) late, which, all in all, was okay
as things were starting to wind down at that point anyway. Not to worry,
he'll be back. Excellent visuals by donovan who, by the way, is an
amazingly cool dude. I really look forward to working with him some more in
the future; his heart's definitely in the right place.

One final note: one of the things that made me *really* happy was that, by
and large, I think the vast majority of the 200-250 people that came to
this party were list (sfr) folks. I met tons of people from the net that I
never even knew existed. Nice folks too! SFR RULES!  ;-)

lots of love

Weekend Rave report
===================
  
  I can't believe I missed F&F,   I'll never forgive myself for
missing this event,  as I had fully intended to make a showing,
but Craig wanted me to hemp him with the technical end of the 
video.

  This Saturday,  I had attended "Cool World" at the Cow Palace,
where my friend Craig Larson did the video,  so I was spared from
having to pay the exhorbenent $25 admission fee.    Instead,  I
had an "All Access" badge that got be backstage,  and also access
to a free food buffet,  ins-and-out's and other perks.

  The promoters had mentioned there was to be an orbitron and
gravitron,  but (sigh!) these "rides" never showed up.   Nothing
love better,  than to twerl around on an orbitron.

Other than that,  "Dee Lite" put on an awsome show when they went 
on stage around 5 am or so.

   The main arena was mostly hip hop towards the end,   with Techno
DJ'ing between the live music acts.     

   There were 3 areas,   one a hip hop/ Acid Jazz area on one side of
main arena,  the other was "house" on the other side,   and then the main 
arena,  which had a ferris wheel and tilt-a-whirl with waiting times
of about an hour for each of the rides.

   The "House" section was killer,  but the very large room didn't do
the sound much justice,  as the echoing effect made for a somewhat 
muddy sound.   The space (Cow Palace) was killer,  with lots of room,
little or no smoking (Actually there was no smoking,  but few people
obeyed it).

   As usual,  I went insane in the house section,   but the first few
DJ's failed to keep my interest for long,   then at about 5 am,  I saw
Garth coming down the ramp in the backstage area,  and I knew that
my wants for good continious beats would soon get answered.

   I had fully intended to leave Cool World and head over to Friends
and Family,   but my partner Aaron had the keys to the car,  and
couldn't be found (sigh!) so I got bored around 3 am and couldn't
get over there.     I heard that F&F was THE place to be,  from reports
I've gotten from Robert,  who I met the following morning at the End
Up.

   After the Cool World,  we headed down to the Mission area for a big
breakfast,   Aaron and my other friend Mike,  wanted to hang out in the
Castro,   while I met and visited another friend before eventually
heading over to the End up.    My stay was short,   as this is Gay 
Pride weekend and the Gay parade was to start soon,  so I head over to
the festival area and hung out till the parade started.

   The parade was of course totally insane (As only San Francisco can
provide.    Very entertaining,  the costumes were totally out of this
world,  and we were blessed with wonderful warm weather (Unusual for
this time of year).   I found a great spot to view the parade,  and
chilled out,  until I got restless and headed up Market street.

   After the parade, we headed ofer to the festival area,  and lo
and behold,  the sound of house music was drawing me towads it,  and
I wound up dancing my ass off until 6 pm.    I thought most of the
DJ's SUX bigtime,  as few could keep up a good beat for long.   As
frequent announcements were made,  chastizing those folks for sitting
on the speakers and hanging out to near the DJ area.    As usual,
it was super crowded,  but I did manage to find enough room to dance
and had a great time.

   My only regret was that I missed F&F,  as I had fully intended to
make an appearance.

   So,  for those wanting to know about "Cool World",  you didn't miss
anything good,  as I would say it was mediocre (At best) and NOT worth
the $25 (Plus $6 for parking),  but I know you all knew that anyway.

What can I say, Friends and Family was awesome. I am glad I went and saw 
everyone and I met a few outta town ravers (Troy Sheets, Jeannie Finks, 
and Grant (vravers)). Everyone sets were excellent, and the people.. what 
energy.. Like resonate said, I really did't meet that many lurkers 
either. Then again, .I did take off my "Just Say n2o" shirt. And there 
was a 2 there, you just couldnt see it too well. So I painted it over 
with Sean's glow in the dark paints.:) For those who didnt come this 
time, I hope you make it to the next Friends and Family.. (amaranth.this 
means you too! ;)) Thanks to everyone who made it great, the DJs, the 
people setting up, Ethan, Bryce, and the people at Komotion.

I agree with everything good that's been said about this party. d;-)  Lotsa 
visuals, props, smiles, people - the communal effort was obvious making the 
space as fun and stimulating as any indoor venue I can remember being in.  
The fans, free water, ins & outs, and no smoking policy made the heat quite 
tolerable.  We even found the slippery wet concrete fun to dance on.
  
The music:

Family obligations limited our attendance to the 2:30 - 5:30 slot, but
I was very impressed with the DJing.  It was the first time I heard
Tomatsu spin, and he *really* kicked making it difficult for us to leave. 
 
The ambient DJs had to battle with the main room, which was too bad, 
because M Normal, our ambient queen, gave us a truly beautiful set.  I 
really like her style of beatless mixing, music you can really float away 
and bliss out with.  I thought that her selection for Ovid's talk was 
perfect, even inspired.  I'm gonna have to start bugging her to make me 
a tape. 

The "talk":

The ambient hallway may not have been the most ideal venue for Ovid's 
spoken work performance, but I thought that this still ended up being 
a very special event.  M spun some eeringly beautiful space music while
red laser blobs streaked over Ovid's head like fiery comets.  The nearby
dance room entrance flared the energy of new born stars at us and 
occasional humans walked by like rocky asteroids drifting through 
our hallway region of the galaxy.  And in the midst of this swirling
turmoil/harmony of sound, light and motion, Ovid spoke to us of yourneys 
to Infinity, of the place between experience and understanding... he was 
a vortex of consciousness amidst a pulsating and chaotically organized 
Cosmos.  To me, this represented what I have always felt the ultimate 
transcendental experience should be about: getting to a "place" where 
there is total synergy between Mind and Universe.

Even when it was difficult to hear everything Ovid said, I would catch 
phrases of a metaphysical nature that would triggered various esoteric 
themes existing at the limits and core of our minds and reality.  More than 
a poetry reading or a lecture - it was a word performance based on deep 
scientific and spiritual understandings.  As far as reality explorations go, 
Ovid's excursion had much more meaning for me (even when I could only make 
out peices of it) than Terrance Mckenna's psychedelic court jestering.

Thanks Ovid, and thank you Ethan for enthusiastically embracing the whole 
idea of this from the very start.  Isn't raving cool - silly, fun, sensory,
decadent, technological, scientific, artistic, social, spiritual... pick 
one, or pick 'em all.

What a beautiful thing when reality overwhelms expectations.  Due
to family obligations we arrived a little late after taking a nap,
in time to see Ovid give his talk with M Normal doing a terrific
job setting a truely wonderful mood.  Too bad it was a little
hard to hear, but I know that there was enthusiasm for this type
of performance and i'm sure that Ovid will do it again in the future.  

As soon as we walked into the club we were struck by the vibe - WOW!
so many smiling faces and pure joy.  I truly felt that we were all
in this together, feeding off of everyone's infectious good feeling.
It was also so sweet to see so many SFR's in one place; its been a 
long time since i've seen so much community.  We arrived too late to
meet the naked guy, which, when i read about it, thought it was
absolutely hilarious (what a scene this is).

Unfortunately, the only DJ we got to see was Tomatsu; he was
spectacular.  I have never heard him spin before and truly hope that
i get to see him again soon.  While true, it was very hot in the
large room, i never felt uncomfortable...the fans and the fact that
everyone adhered to the no smoking rule as well as plenty of free water 
was probably why.

Lastly, my biggest congratulations to Ethan and to Bryce.  Two people
who continue to embrace the concept and hope of continuation.  They
have endured dispite some disappointments and a whole lot of hard work. 
Not for recognition or money, but for their devotion to the scene.
I love you guys.

Wow!

     Even though I was totally beat from running around all day, I managed to
dance through most of Laura's set and a little into Ethan's.  After that I
chilled with my fiance on the risors and twitched and watched the crowd go off.
 NO SMOKING!  This was a big plus in my book because it allowed me to breath
and enjoy the party without having to choke.  The heat was definitely in the
house, but I like what it adds to the vibe.  Bryce & Ethan, the sound was
PERFECT 8*)  I have been to few clubs were the sound is EQed as well and sounds
so tasty *Long live the Bass*.  Even on the turntables, where sound can be a
nightmare, it felt like my head was surfing on a standing wave of music 8*)  It
was great to have so many people there right from the start.  It made the party
start at the begining, imagine that ;)  The ambient room was too cool, next
time there should be more room so that more people can enjoy dream land at the
same time!  
     Bathrooms, soap, free cold water, friendly workers, no goons, very
friendly vibe(let's hear it for smiles), big cool fans, dayglow paint(which was
cool to spin with on my hands), glow sticks, flourecent slinky(Go Larry!!),
Lasers, ambient and dance Djs KICKED!!!  
     I had a great time and can't wait for the next SFR event.  I had some
non-SFR friends drop by who really enjoyed themselves.  Everybody give yourself
a hand!!!

Peace & Strength 'till we Trance again !              Tamotsu


Next time I'm raving naked 8*)

Family and Friends--

That's what we all were Saturday night at Klub Kommotion,
thanks to a lot of loving work--and working love--that a
lot of people put in. I cannot add to the kudos; the names
are a litany of the known and the unknown: Laura, Brian,
naked guy, Greg the glopainter and his friend Scott who
were newbies that I had fun guiding around a bit, Alan and
Jim who were newbies I brought for their first rave, Larry,
RSN8, M and ovid who took us on a trip where music and meta-
physics and subatomics and spirituality intersect, Ethan, Bryce, 
Tomatsu, Lee, Alex and forgive me for whoever I don't mention!
Two special personal highlights for me were meeting fellow English
teacher Robert (who's only existed in cyberspace for me so far)
and a new friend, met recently in the ether on the occasion of
flaming some rather provocative stuff I had to say last week!
Whew!

Will

]]]]]]]]>>>>>>>>THUS SPOKE XANAXATETRIS<<<<<<<<<[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[


First my apologies for continuing to lurk in RL and not show for what is now
regarded as one of the better events of the 20th century. Like RN and I went
to Pink Saturday, and waited for the 24 for EVER, and slowly our feets
almost turned eastward for Komotion/F&F, but we copped out: sleep, sunday
with mom took precedent. We wimped and headed home. :(

Plus Friday I was all set to make a badge in Freehand of my email address,
but had to leave work too early and couldn't do it.

I promise to come to the next F&F (or free park party). Onwards:

1) DAT tapes??? Please, get tdk 90s from costco and dub! Some other guy on
the list did same a year ago and by all reports were most appreciated. In
keeping with a three dollar rave, couldn't the tapes be like five bks or so?
Or have interested parties send their own blank tapes? 

2) It sounds like the show worked very well for the Komo people, in terms of
cash and fun; more gigs in the future? For SFRave listers who put these on,
keep in mind how well the show went and contrast that with any
less-than-sterling experiences you have had with more money-oriented bigtime
promoters/club owners. Maybe a free GG park rave til sunset followed by
another 12 hours at komotion?  

3) Komotion puts out a fanzine every 4 months or so that comes with a
cassette of selections of shows they have recorded there. I believe they
have their own DAT machine  and/or special mics.  MAybe some of the F&F mix
will be on a future Live and Kicking fanzine/tape release? I can only cross
myfingers. WE(WELCOME TO PLUG CENTRAL: I have a short fiction in the upcoming
issue called "Forget the Past, and just say Yes".)

Well, everything sounds wadshooterrific!!!! Over n out,

PHL

What?  You mean it was right up the 101 the whole time?
Actually, I found the heart and soul of San Francisco, what the San 
Francisco people always talk about when they compare it to
Los Angeles.

I'm posting this to SFraves and So-Cal raves, because while in
LA I never really knew what made the SF scene so great, I didn't
really understand why everyone was moving up there.

Until Saturday night.

I went to both Friends and Family (put on by SFravers) and Basics.
First, let me say that I had agreat time at F&F.  I want to thank
the people who put it together.  For 3 dollars they provided a 
secure location, 2 good sound systems, lights, DJ's, and a vibe!
Many times I am lucky to get one of those things for 15 dollar.
A special "Hi!" to everyone I met there.  

Now, I don't want my opinion of Basics to undermine F&F, because
they were really two altogether different events, both special
in their own right.

Basics was simply the best even I have ever been to.  Basics seemed
to have a format, a program if you will.  It was not like a typical 
club where people come and go throughout the night.  Basics was
more like a service.  It had three distinct parts.  

Pat 1:  When I arrived I was a bit surprised that more people were 
not dancing.  But looking around I saw most of the people talking,
socializing, meeting up with friends and meeting new people.  
There seemed to be a feeling o knowing, of anticipation, maybe
the way a family might act before a wedding.  A feeling that everyone was about
to have a really good experience.  The music at
this point was a faster, progressive house.  

Part 2:  Large baners with fluorescent paint were lit up by many
blacklights up until this point.  At about 2:15am, when most people
had started dancing, the blacklights went out, the club fell into
darkness, and a large cheer came from the crod.  Something was
happening.  The music changed.  I had heard this music a few times
before.  Nothing terribly different, just another step in the ever-
evolving realm of progressive dance tracks.  It was a bit darker,
trancier, almost pagan, but, amazingly, it retained funk and house
elements.  I guess this is "The San Francisco Sound", whatever
that means.  But this was, above all else, dance music.  This was
music that got me moving unlike anythig else I have really
heard.  My mind let go and my body took over.  
I'm not going to try and explain how I felt.  I thought how I would
explain this in a "xxxxxx-raves" post.  The one comment that
came to mind that seemed realy appropriate was "dancing
with God".  I was in a state where I could not think of anything
that could possibly make this experience better.  A feeling that
everything within me and around me was in perfect balance.
I was not he only one.  The vibe around
me was unlike anything I have ever experienced, so much so that
the term "vibe" was totally redefined for me.  I could ramble on for
a long time about how I felt for the next 3 hours, but it is on of 
those things that you have to experience to really understand.

Part 3:  At around 4:45 the black-lights went back on, the DJ
poured on the House.  House spun just like I, personally, love it.
It was the perfect music to ollow up what we had gone through.
The one word to describe the atmosphere was "celebration".  We
left our euphoric trances to share and dance with each other.
A more perfect sense of acceptance and co-existance I have
never flt.  We had experienced true joy for ourselves, and now it
was time to share it with the people around us.  Morning came,
and the club was over.

There is a either a new generation of raves ("Raves:TNG"?), or the
evolution has passed over Southern California.  Either way, there
is something happening out there, up here, that is wonderful.
I hope to see many so-cal friends visit up here soon!

hi.

i suppose i'm one of the many referred to as "lurkers"..  but i did 
manage to make it out to friends and family, and i must say i thought it 
was incredible.

the music was fantastic and the crowd was so energized ...  i couldn't 
help but smile.  it seemed everyone else couldn't help but smile either. :)  
it was a bit hot at first, but it didn't take us long to forget about the 
heat and we spent the next few hours dancing our bums off.  it was the 
type of situation where my brain keeps telling me i'm tired but my body has 
control and  won't stop..  i felt so wonderfully comfortable and content...

never got around to meeting any list folk..  maybe next time (which i 
hope isn't too far off)

just wanted to say i had a great time all around.  appreciated all the 
smiles and general friendliness.  :)

thanks to all..  really, thanks so much for providing such a great and 
satisfying party.

Troy:  

Feels good to know that other people feel as I do, that the rave scene 
is, not better than the rest, but has an extremely healthy vibe.  And a 
large part of what makes the scene here so healthy is the contribution 
from the people that put on the Basics parties.  

Every time I go to Basics I see more and more people that I have at one 
time or another met there.  I call it a "rave family" or "Basics Family", 
or whatever.  The point is the same people go there, so it is not only a 
rave, it has become over the past 2 years a gathering of friends.  

I'm glad that you had fun up here.  I have never been personally to a 
s-cal rave, so I can't give my opinion on how the vibe is there--but the 
vibe is alive here, and what I ask of people is to take that positive 
energy with them and spread the word.

SF Guardian, 6/8/94, p.16  (Nude Beaches '94 article)

	At Santa Cruz's Boony Doon, volunteers are picking up trash
	rather than planting seeds.  Since it began five years ago, 
	this annual cleanup, led by the South Bay Naturists, has been 
	nothing short of miraculous.  In previous years the patrol 
	has hauled about a ton of bottles and other trash from the 
	outskirts of the sandy cove.  "Last year we found just 500 
	pounds," says Richard Pasco, head of the San Jose-based 
	naturists group.  This season, the battle to transform the 
	site continues.  If you'd like to help during a daylong 
	cleanup on Sept. 17, contact SBN [South Bay Naturists]...

Two points:
  According to this article, Bonny Doon has been _cleaner_ since 
  raves started happening there!  This certainly doesn't directly 
  imply that all events there leave the site "cleaner than when 
  we got there", but it does argue that this is _not_ a case of a 
  pristine site trashed by massive raves.

  i recall a thread a few months ago about the possibility of 
  having a clean-up day down there.  Were plans ever finalized? 
  Perhaps those interested might want to join this cleanup in 
  September... (a clothing optional trash pickup -- interesting 
  concept :)

Hi Gregg--

Thanks for the paragraph from the article, but I wish you
had quoted the part you alluded to:

 According to this article, Bonny Doon has been _cleaner_ since
  raves started happening there!

If you still have it, would you please send along that part?
Thanks!

Will
Interested because I'm a Santa Cruzan sfraver!

That guy from So-Cal reminded me of a party where I had one of those 
godly experiences, last year at the 4th of Jul "Let Freedom Rave" in 
Livermore at a dirt racetrack.  This was a party that almost ended right 
in front of our eyes, but the ravers stopped that from happening.  

First of all, what reminded me of what Troy said about the music was a set
at the Let Freedom Rave party last year.  I believe the lights either
dimmed or went out, and there was this incredible "space-techno" (I create
a new musical genre almost daily) that was just incredible.  I think it
was Spun spinning, but I am not sure.  Anyway, I think that happened about
1:00 or so. 

Then, about 2:15 am, people began pointing up in the hill next to the 
party.  People had been lighting fireworks all night, and one of them got 
into the dry grass and started the hill on fire.  It started really fast, 
and before anyone knew it, the fire was going.  

People began running up there to try to put the fire out.  Some people 
kicked dirt on it, others used buckets or bottles of water that were at 
the front.  The fire spread to this big tree, and I thought that it was 
over then.  The music had stopped by this time and Martin told  
people to get off the hill over the pa.  

However, there were already tons of people on the hill.  They soon had the
tree problem out of the way.  The rest of us sat and watched in suspense,
and when the tree stopped burning, the entire crowd cheered with complete
ecstatic joy.  Martin got on the pa and said "Let's put the fire out
together" so we could start the party again.  About 10 minutes later, the
music started again, and that changed the entire mood of the party. 

When the sun came up, some of us climbed on the hill to watch the party 
from up there and reflect on the night.

SF Chronicle Sunday Pink Section, 6/19/94, p.34

"_The Reel Deal_, a renegade reply [to MTV's _The Real World_] from the 
South-of-Market subculture, purports to portray the San Francisco scene as
it is, not as glossed over by a slick Hollywood crew and cast of out-of-
towners."
  
arggh, this is too long to quote, i'll just  paraphrase -- 

This is being done by Nitty Gritty Video (the same group that did the 
Connection and FMR/GGP videos (um, i think -- verification, anyone??)). 
Following the same premise of filming the lives of a group of six (mostly)
twenty-somethings including DJs Pollywog and Ernie Munson.

_The Reel Deal_ will be shown every other Thursday through December at
10 pm on cable access 53 in SF (same time slot as _The Real World_). 
They hope to move it to 10:30 soon, so people can watch both for 
contrast.

The article says the first episode ran May 26th.  Did anyone catch this?
Also, is there any way to get SF 53 in the East Bay (Albany)?  And if not,
anyone out there planning to tape this stuff?

	Ooops, that part was my conclusion based on the stuff i quoted -- 
that last year the Bonny Doon cleanup only found 1/4 of the trash they 
had in previous years (and the fact that it has been a rave site for 
a little under two years now).  There was no mention of raves at all in 
the article itself, and only a few more paragraphs on Bonny Doon.

 Yes and no - the store still exists , but it's moved down to a huger 
store next to Quement Electronics , past HW280 and the hospital , across
the street from World of Fantasy comics. Bascom Ave is getting to be this 
strange kind of "auto row" of prerecorded music - Outer Rhthym at one end , 
then Rowe's Rare Records , then Streetlight , and finally Tower Records in
Campbell.

 Streetlight has about 24" of techno/ambient CDs - they used to have a
seperate techno section , but they discontinued the seperate section
some months ago ( their hearts were never into techno , I guess - the
divider marking the Techno 12" had this written on it " This is the 
TECHNO section - it's just a flash in the pan , anyway" ). Too bad -
they used to have all the Twitch remix 12".

Two weekend party reviews:
(my psuedo-vacation of not working on weekends continues)

Friday I got into 1015 Folsom for free around 12:30.  I had never been.
It is a bit of a zoo.  The basement is House.  There is a chill no roof
with heaters room that I checked out just before they closed it - it was
suitably chilly ;) 

My impression is that this space has been bagged on alot on this list.
I thought it was great.  A bar with lots of ice water, AC into a little 
screened off area that stayed cooler.  The screen had visual stuff.
There was a harsh black light but plenty of places to look away and it
is fairly key to be able to turn into a bright light at an appropriate 
time.  There were enough people to keep things On and have space to
move.

The crowd worked me!  I was inspired.  Beautiful people.  
Dressed to go OUT.  I was on this decadent disco head trip.
Each moment was a picture - frozen - 
the *Fabulous* contorted into insane boogie
manuevers - droplets of sweat winging through the air -
Brazilian jet setters and international soccer stars -
I got off hard

To compare it to my (quite) limited party experiences I would say 
it was closest to a Toon Town - at least people wise.  
I guess this makes it old school.
DJ's Taj and Thomas.  
How does it go?
Thomas is the shit!

This is not a weekly (I think) but it will be
later in the summer ..??

Saturday I went to F&F - $3 was nice as were the ins and outs
The chill room was loud.  The chill-chill room had bathroom traffic.
The main room was hot as hell at least early in the night.
The music just didn't do me right (no flames please).  
I stuck around until Spun came on (I think).
Bong Bong Bong come-dance-to-me house.
I was tired so I left.
I had on baggy blue jeans and a tshirt.  Didn't meet any sfravers
but I did meet some nice folks from Pacifica.  Also (pet peeve coming)
some guy asked me Several Times to sell him drugs.  
After one "sorry no - good luck though" 
what is up with asking me again?
This only seems to happen to me
at places that allow under 21
I must look like a shady character ... ;);)

Howdy--

I believe I might have not mentioned Sean in my
little litany of thanks-all for the splendiferous
thang that F&F2 was.  Now in a fit of solstice events--
one just over that was the outdoor to F&F's indoor,
and the next tonight with drums and old chums--please
accept my heartfelt tahnks again for all the devotion
in our community.  It always seems that just when I
bark there's nothing to yap but rather a lot of things
to clap about! Our imagination amazes me even more than 
the dozen

Ok folks,
I saw a very funny commercial.  Actualy, I liken it to severe negative 
propaganda.  It's composed of 3 commands:  Get High, get stupid, get aids.

Does anyone know who's gonna obey those commands?  <--- rhetorical

Does anyone know who's paying for these commercials?

Dave--

Sorry I didn't see you at F&F2. I think the same guy asked
me for drugs at least twice, too.  So there yuh go; you
figure it.  Sorry you didn't stay longer, I'm not flamin'
yuh--sounds like you knew your groove that nite!

Your review of Fridays at 1015 (Is it still Glamourama?)
was *perfetto*!  I've gone a couple times with a 23
year old rave queen whose friends let us in "for your hats!"
It's glitzy and clubby and all the things you said--and,
as I believe you suggested, a lot of fun when you go ready
for that kind of effervescence!  Pop! Pop!

Thanks for the rap...

Will

Susie et al--

We all know al, but "et" doesn't mean...well,
it means "and" and "al" is short for *alii*
and means "others," natch?

Well, anyways, Susie named it right: things go in seven
year cycles and it was 1966, the year before the "summer
of love," that morpho genetic fields built up in the
whole SF scene (not just the Haight-Ashbury) to make
that scene then.

Well, this is now, but count 'em!  I was at my big
turning point entheogenic opening by 1966 when I was
28 and when I hit 56 the next phase hit me.  Ever see
that Brit documentary "28+," then it was "35+," etc.?
28 is when most of us transit to "adulthood," and 56?
Well, 1994 has the portent of 1966....

Susie  :) it was good chatting with you, too, at F&F2!
No, I *won't* say "partyon"!

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

hi folx,
really enjoyed friends and family. got there around 1 am and felt a really
good vibe in the whole place. i really liked the musick being spun in the
dance room. the ambient room was cool too, tho' a bit busy with  people
going back an forth. saw quite a few people, even some folx who came to their
first  rave. the spoken visualisation went pretty well, tho' there were some
technical problems at times with feed-back.
earlier last week i was in seattle and got a bit of taste of the nw scene.
i must say that i was staying at a place near u of w and was not that mobile,
so i got to go to the underground ONLY. 1 out of 3 ain't bad in baseball,
bit not so good in dancing . the acid house night on wed.'s was good, but the
'alternative industrial' night on tue. and the fri. were so so only.
hope there are more vibey place, since at the undgnd people were not that
friendly. i did pick up some mags up there, including a neat hip-hop
magazine, THE FLAVOR, which had a neat article i want to share with you all
about hip-hop, jeru and such:
" i express myself freely or i just won't do it...if something's on my mind,
i say it ten times out of ten."
i hear lots of talk about the uprising of the black race and the means by
which we  plan  to take back our freedom. and all i can say is , i hope
motherfuckers don't think this is going to be a shoot'em up free-for-all,
going around killing innocent people and reacting to our pain and confusion
like uncontrolled animals. hell yeah, you'll scare the white politicians;
you'll scare them so much with out violent, uncontrolled, unpremeditated
revolution that they will drop a bomb on our black asses so fast there will
be just craters where ghettos were. don't you see all this gun shit is not
the way. they gave them to us so we would act up and when everyone asks,
"why did they bomb the black people?" they will tell them we got out of hand,
and they did it to protect themselves and their country, and americans  will
nod in pacified agreement and go back to sleep.
  we as black people don't know enough about ourselves to be talking of an
 uprising. we embarrass ourselves too much everyday, from kids killing each
other in the streets for nothing for a substance they must rush to sell other
black people as if it were healing them. but all crack gas done us stagnate
the growth of our culture, and destroy our families. and the sorry-ass r&b
and rap has made a self-mockery of our real music such as jazz, funk, soul,
reggae and hip-hop that we execute with such inexperience that it's as if
we stole the music from them and don't understand what it means or where it
comes from. this is sad because they have stolen our heritage and will gladly
sell us a piece of it for the price of our soul and dignity. we then turn
this regurgitated soul against each other and these shallow compositions of
confusions have become anthems for black people. millions of balck people have
been tricked into throwing away themselves, but in so many different ways all
they have to do is sit back and watch in suspended relief until the last black
person drops.
  for this very reason the so-called revolution must be a mental one, and must
be constructed of such power and love for each other that we cannot fail and
will reclaim our right to live on this planet like we belong here. jeru is
one brother who has already made steps in the direction of building his
intellect into a protective force-field he can use to protect himself and
others who chose to listen. but the year is 1994 and there isn't much time left
and it seems that true hip-hop has stepped up to take its place in the battle
against ignorance, but must fight ignorance within its own genre to survive.
when i asked jeru how he felt his new album, "the sun rises in the east,"
would stand against the wall of ignorance and chaos that has been erected to
keep us out, he said "it's gonna stand in its own spot.. amongst all that.
everything has got its own place and time and so does my music. so it really
doesn't matter, there really is no chaos because chaos is just a different
aspect of order."
  that makes a lot of sense, but at the same time people find it frightening
to even go outside, and it's not even a night thing anymore. you could get
took out in broad daylight, which is truly disgusting because a lot of older
people and children can't go outside. some of us have actually adapted in a
chilling disposal of emotions, except fear that we try to disguise as anger
among other things.
  "fuck that, fuck being scared of my people," said jeru."it's like the time
for that is over..., being scared of one another and all that. there ain't
really shit to be scared of," professed jeru. "it shouldn't be your brother
bustin' you in the head for something like a jacket of something. motherfuckers
make you dead for something already dead."
   it's very confusing to me, though, 'cause it seemed like between the years
1988 through 1991 brothers were rhyming about mental shit, but were led
astray. but why ?
   "it's got to do with the masses. it got too large. so the ignorant are
going to embrace ignorance. it's like a wise man embraces intelligence," jeru
said, commenting on the sudden disappearance of the intellectually-strengthened
balck minds that we so desperately need to lead us out of this confusion and
into the righteous domain of constant growth and enlightenment that we have
been removed so far from. that without our true, original way of existence
that we have been brought here brainwashed. therefore without our supernatural
mental capabilities we have been rendered defenseless, and have seemingly no
other choice  but to flip. like when jeru says, "homicide central, east
new york, where the manic-depressive-psycho-murderers stalk " in he song
  "come clean. " now think about that, "manic-depressive-psycho-murderers,"
that could be any of us. when i asked jeru if he thought that would grab
people's attention, he knew it had to. he said why. "in fact that could be
some dude fed up with work or whatever, and he's gotta feed his family, so
he needs to do what he's gotta do. brothers is just fed up with being
niggas instead of men or gods."
   if this is the case, then we need to come together, not to fight a physical
war, so they can wipe our bodies from the planet with such amazing ease that
it won't matter now many we bring, but through our love for each other, our
culture, and most important, the mental and spiritual elevation we experience
and can share with each other through our music. until then, we will suffer
for lifetimes into eternity and the revolutions we speak of will be nothing
more than occasional fits thrown by black people who are fed, but not enough
to feed our minds souls, and hearts with the beauty that lies within ourselves
and each other.
                                       THE FLAVOR

Well, compared to everything else that goes on here in Seattle, such as 
the UFO/ATOI parties, the Choc-Lit factory events, Mind Body and Soul and 
whatnot, the Underground is crap crap crap.  Basically it's a teen dance 
club not unlike another in town called The Oz.  Nothing "vibey" about it 
whatsoever.  Anyway, enough bitching.  It's a shame you couldn't make it 
out to Starseed, which was held in a Port Authority park by the water 
(framed by these enormous loading cranes) and came to completion with 
*the blessing of the authorities*... Michael Manahan, Dervish, Ryan, and 
Rob spun incredible sets and the vibe was just *incredible* (this may be 
a bit biased, as my main joy in the party was to hear my own record get 
played as the sun rose :-)) You should definitely come up to Seattle 
another time and actually check out the scene.  I hope the Underground 
didn't scare you off :)

And as the The Flavor, we share an office with them just a few blocks 
from the Underground! :-)

Susan & I (of YSH) are trying to locate Craig Larson, as it's possible he 
has (or knows the whereabouts of) her video projector. We've been trying 
to track it down for quite a long time now, ever since Susan loaned it to 
Malachy (a long time ago)

*Any* help in this area would be ecstatically appreciated...

Thanks,

Maui

     Shalom, Ovid!
     
        Your article from THE FLAVOR brought me out of "lurk" mode much 
     earlier than I intended, so please pardon me if I sound like the 
     newcomer to rave that I am.
     
        It's good to see the messages of nonviolence continue to spread 
     where they are needed.  Dr. King and Gandhi would be satisfied (were 
     they still functioning in this existence) to know that their 
     philosophical and moral legacies continue.
     
        As an interesting side note, I saw a broadcast of one of 
     Ferrakhan's speeches during last Christmas vacation.  [He's an 
     excellent orator -- I learned a few things watching him.]  Once waded 
     past the initial reactions and started thinking on the core of that 
     speech, I felt that he said the same:  first give yourself back your 
     mind and refuse to give it away or sell it, then the rest will follow 
     as you work to give yourself back your humanity and your dignity.
     
        My housemate is going through a much milder case of this in his 
     transformation from introvert computer jockey into a dynamic open 
     hypnotherapist.  It works -- I'm starting down a similar road myself.

 If I can make it - I'd like to be at something for this Full Moon / Solstice
time , even if it isn't the "official" FMR. Can "someone" let me know when
the /where the FMR will be ( I've read Geoff's post , so I guess it's after 
1AM ). A number I can be reached at then is at MTI - (408) 746-3833. If
I'm not at the phone in person , please leave a message - I might just
be out of the room at the moment.

Call me lost in the dark... but if anyone wants to post info
on the FMR I would most appreciate it.  I can also give rides
for anyone around Santa Cruz, or maybe I should meet up with Will
and be environmentally conscious.  Is it just up HWY 1 somewhere?

Last month the location of the FMR wasn't announced until like
2:00 or maybe it was even 3:00 am, so it's a little early now
I'd think :-).

I have no idea where it will be.  I'm very far out of the loop.

The sound system from Seattle DID show up.  Where were you Phred?  =]

Unfortunately 4 me my train into Eugene from portland Saturday was five 
hours late (engine problems due to Amtrak's ineptitude) and I missed my 
United flight to SF that night 4 F&F and Basics.  Oh well.  The Seattle 
Setup at the dead was cool 'cept the fact we couldn`t get it too loud 
because the dead heads would bitch too much.

There was another setup going closer to the street that was pretty cool 
early sunday by some promoters from Minnesota.  Heard some really cool 
Chicago hard house.  Was kindof bummed I wasn't it SF, but I'll be down 
there in a few weeks anyway 4 the 4th.  Glad to hear that F&F went OFF tho...

late.

Or even easier than calling all the interested people in this FMR,
could someone just post the phone number?  Or tell
us uninformed people that the phone number is the same
as the normal Wickeds?  Is this the case?  I don't know,
I'm clueless.

Hey all you Wicked Full Mooners,
	Is there anyone someone could call me once they know where the full moon is?  Also, is there somebody from the Stanford/Palo Alto area who is going to the FMR, who could possibly give me a ride there and back.  I will be forever in your debt. I was really bummed last month, when I missed the last one, 'cause I couldn't find a ride.  If you can help me out, I would greatly appreciate it.  Please call me, because I'm not going to check my email again tonight.  My number is (415)497-1162. Thanx:)
							-Bobby Benjamin

 Folks - Don't bother calling the number posted here by Tony Garcia as the
FMR info number - the message has nothing to do with the Full Moon Rave.
The bogus number Tony posted was (916)-484-4086. Save yourself a long-distance
phone charge.

PS - Tony : If you posted that number in good faith , then at least call the
damn number first to find out weither it's OK or not.

Hi Folx--

I can only echo what Larry said so well earlier:

> I didn't get a call last night about the
FMR , so I guess I need to set up my place in a phone tree. This post
is a general request to those who've known me for these two years now,
to give me a positive reply about including me in an FMR phone tree.
I'd really appreciate it.


I was on a phone tree until the beginning of this year, but that doesn't
exist any more, so what's the deal with the PacBell thing?

Wsa the Sacramento FMR tthe only one?  We all got directions 
about *that* early-on.  Then someone said that whoever went to
the 60 6th thing would find out there about where the (Wicked)
FMR was.  Was it?  Whassup? How wussy!

Outofitedly yers,

Willi

Larry et al (whoever *he* is!)--

Tony evidently miscopied the 916 FMR number from an
earier sfr post to all of us.  The number posted was

916 484 4006

and Tony mistakenly put the last four digits as 4086 I uess.

This is just to say that the *evidently* correct number 
(I never phoned, myself) was on in the early evening.

Sir Will

 It Was My Fault ( AGAIN )

 I must have copied the number wrong from Tony Garcia's post , so he is
not guilty of flaking out - I am. 

 By sheer coincidence , the number I mentioned gets you an answering
machine greeting from someone involved in the business of music! It 
being late and there being no obvious FMR info , and it being a long
distance call , I didn't call it again , but the guy is obviously
some kind of professional musician . 

 Once again - Tony is not responsible for posting a wrong number - I 
posted a mis-spelling of the number he originally posted.

I bet we have more than enough support for a free rave on July
2nd, the main thing is a big, hopefully outdoor site which will
keep us till dawn. So Lets all start hunting and then we can all
converge .  There are so many people out there who have been doing
freebees who should come and contribute, If you are reading this and
are interested keep watching for postings and we will wait for the
one that sez "Site Found"!

salutations, allen@ameba

I think I'm missing some stuff cuz I don't see most of the big-shot DJs
listed for this weekend's things.  If anyone knows anything else, let
us know.  The return of Carefree and Rhythm, and then Equinox and the
Bulletproof Boat party ought to be good enough for you, though :).

I'm gonna be down in LA this weekend, so someone collect SF flyers for me
this weekend...  (or else there'll only be three things in next week's
calendar :( )

Once again, see the note at the bottom to svbscribe or unsvbscribe.
Bonus question for good students: figure out how to svbscribe and
unsvbsribe from the main sfraves list based on those instructions.

Yo,

I don't know about inspirations, but having missed the full moon hoe down
last night and having not gotten any rave activity in in many moons, I'm
definitely into finding out what's happening tonight... anybody?

The little party on el camino is I think, in santa clara, for
anyone who wants to check it out.

It's a little hard to find (behind a taco bell) and is near
a street called Calabazas  (sp?)

I think it may be at this neat little middle eastern restaurant
(great lunch special) and Its a small intimate type place.
It could be fun if people can find it...

see you

 I just called the number of the restaurant , and it is a Middle Eastern
food place , behind a Taco Bell , between Kiely and Calabasas in Santa
Clara town. 
 It does sound interesting , and it probably won't get the usual 
Friday night office worker club crowd . And for $3 ...

I went to a weekly last night - Kit Kat at the Endup

Acid Jazz outfit Mod Squad played for awhile and then a
DJ with a live percussion section.  The DJ was into
the less funky side of Acid Jazz.  The percussionists were
good at times and distracting at others.

They made me tuck my shirt into my pants in the name
of some abstract dress code that allows people in shorts
and goofy tassled leather shoes but not loose tshirts.

The place was packed.
It was a heavy drinking singles pick-up scene.
Only a very occasional SuperStar was to be found.

One more interesting thing about santa clara
I dont believe they have a mandatory shut down at 2 AM law
like san jose... ( I dont know what the restraunts permits allow)
but if this club were to get going, perhaps it could turn into 
a weekly ALL NIGHT thing?  Wouldnt that be nice, for people
like me who live down here where nothing happens after 2 
but dennys.

They made me tuck my shirt into my pants in the name
of some abstract dress code that allows people in shorts
and goofy tassled leather shoes but not loose tshirts.

Haven't you heard?  The justice department has determined that untucked
t-shirts are a reliable sign of gang affiliation..., details in Details

I want to thank and congratulate everone involved with Friends & Family.  
It's the best party I've been to this year.  I have just joined the mail 
list after having got the calendar a few months.  I have been trying to 
make it to all the sfraves events.  They seem to have the right vibe so 
missing at commercial raves.  I've had it with the lines, high door 
prices and yellow jackets sticking their hands in my pockets.  I was at 
the Vortex that Larry mentioned, it was similar.  Actually F&F was 
probably better.  I'm looking forward to the next one-I'll have to get 
some toys!  I went to the Apocalypse warehouse break-in a couple ov weeks 
ago.  Great idea, unfortunately a menacing police appearance at the map 
point kept people away.  The sound system wasn't up to the huge space, 
either. (It was at the huge pier 70 space that hosted SRL recently).  
It's good to see some techno breaking into this area.  So a techno theme 
for the next F&F is a great idea.  The house groove has become a rut 
around here.  I liked the Acid House theme of the last one.  Love that 
tr-303 sound.
If nothing interests you on this week's sparse list, you should check out 
Crash Worship Saturday at the dreaded Haze theater.  If you haven't seen 
'em before, you'll be amazed.  Especially if you like the nude guy.  
All I'll say about it is wear old clothes and show up about 1 or 1:30 to 
avoid the crusty metal bands opening.  

David

or is nobody sending anything out?

What do you guys think about the show AMBIANCE and what KWOD is doing for 
techno/ambiance...  The set David X plays at midnight to 2am is good, and 
it's nice to hear a variety of music, rather that replaying last weeks 
compalation...  Sorry, i can only take so much Moby...

Hi!  Sounds like the KALX dj is playing a housey/techno something set
right now, in case anyone (like me) is stuck at home right now.

I don't have a playlist so i don't know who/what this is.  

Also, can anybody recommend a good ambient comp?  (i like vinyl!)

Sender: sfraves-owner@techno.Stanford.EDU

I had such a hard time sending this posting that it's totally late by now,
but here goes anyway:

Hi all of you SFRavers,

Friends & Family was the first SFR event that I attended.  I can't thank
everyone enough for putting this incredible evening together.  It was just
plain fun!
I got there rather late so unfortunately I missed Laura's set but was pleased
to have met her.  Ethan was already spinning when I entered and I went wild.
 I thought he was absolutely incredible.  I think I may have told him 100
times how great he was.  "Ethan, forgive me for repeating myself but YOU WERE
INCREDIBLE". 
The atmosphere was very much ...HOT... The decor, the lights, toys and
all...and of course the "Naked Man" (I hope he is starting a new trend), was
absolutely ...COOL...
I took a very short break after Ethan's set but hopped back on the dance
floor to end Lee's Set, also very good.  Then came Alex...wow, wow, wow
again.  I've heard Alex spin in his own store "Gaia Mantra" but never heard
him Live.  He was also most incredible.  (Alex you're a genius).  By that
time I think I danced for about 4-1/2 hours and I was done for.  I wish I
could have stayed longer to listen to more djs but I guess it will have to be
for a next time.
Again thanks to all sfRavers involved.  I got to meet Laura, Brian (wired),
Cindy Kawakami (she intruduced me to many great people but I forget some
names), of course Ethan and Alex and probably a few others I forget.
This is an evening I will not forget for a long time.  Let's do it again.

Yes, Boogie Buffet is returning soon!!  Tonight Markie Mark, and Neon 
Leon will be playing in the Main Room at TenFifteen, and I'm not sure 
who's playing in the other rooms.  I believe the police are still making 
us close at 3:30 til July , in which case there will be an announcement 
at closing that the party moves to another SOMA club, our djs continue 
there, and free passes are given as you exit.

Check out the Sunset party at the Berkeley marina every Sunday.  Galen's 
been putting these on since May.  More people keep coming every week, but 
it's still small enough to feel intimate (maybe 50-70 people last week).
they start around 2 and go till sunset.  Good house music, good location,
good sound system, great people.

Oops!! Just called the info line (415)985-5264 and today's party is 
cancelled :(  However, it also said that there'd be a special sunset 
party July 3rd :)

 This is a review of a little club rave that will be happening every
Friday in Santa Clara.

 The place is actually a restaurant , not a club per se. It's the Sultan
restaurant , and they serve Middle Eastern cuisine. It's at 3099
El Camino Real in Santa Clara town - unfortunetly , the place doesn't 
have it's name in the curbside list of shops - it's a small place in
a corner , way behind the Taco Bell. The little shopping center is
located south of Calabasas and north of Kiely.

 As I walked in at about 10:30PM , I noticed what I took to be the
owners of the restaurant hanging out at the far end of the bar. Very 
un-show biz looking folks. About 10 patrons were already there , either
in the restaurant or just hanging out outside. 

 Nobody was dancing.

 The place had a middle-eastern motif - cloth hangings gave the impression
of a tent , small metal lanterns suspended by chains from the ceiling.
The dance area had been created by moving the tables out of the main room,
so there was mostly institutional-pile carpet to dance on , as well as the 
regular 10'x12' parquet dance floor. 

 An attempt was made to set a mood with some nice candles and incense.
However , the lighting was run by someone who didn't seem to be a 
professional - he had a multi-color-beam stage light that he would fuss
with every once and awhile , and a really annoying light that spun spots 
of lights in circles - the darn thing was aimed too low and into people's
eyes.

 And he had a fog machine too. ( I hate 'em )
 

 So , I and this one other guy stayed out of the way of the lights and
tried to get some dancing done in this vibe vacumn. Two couples who
gave the impression of walking in from the street danced for awhile
and left. It was dire.

 The first DJ was Alonzo - he seemed 18 or early-twenty-something. Mostly
housey stuff - too bad nobody was in much of a mood to dance, since his
set was good. The dance action seemed to pick up a bit after Harry Who
started spinning , and the dance floor finally came alive around 
midnight. Harry Who played mostly trance & techno , also put in a good
set ( Harry Who seems to be involved with Outer Rhythm Records in some
way - is it his store? ). Around 12:30 AM , Spun took over , and I and 
a whole bunch of other folks hit our peaks - excellent music!

 The lighting situation had improved by Harry Who's set - the annoying
light had been aimed higher over people's heads. The fog machine was
still being set off occasionally - too much fog for the small place,
in my opinion. ( Maybe he should rent the new water-vapor fog machine
next time ). 

 I had the feeling that the event was put on by amateurs with good
intentions. Sure enough , the gal at the door was the owners' daughter ;
she had talked them into trying this for a few fridays. She said they made
some money - that should encourage mom & dad to keep the thing going.

 I will try them again next friday ( hey - $3 and in Santa Clara sounds
OK to this south bay guy. ) , and will make another report.

Ok I've been lurking here for awhile and after reading Larry's post
figured I could jump in on the south bay rave wagon.
For the past several months I've been going to raves in SF and it's been
real good and well worth the one hour drive for me.   But when I head
about this thing in Santa Clara I felt this aura of convenience come
over me and decided to check it out.
(hey, $3)

I too got this tent feeling.

Hey that other guy was me! I was hoping that more people would get into
it early since the party was only going til 2am.  At least with the few
people dancing and the floor fan it was easy to stay cool.

> a whole bunch of other folks hit our peaks - excellent music!

One thing I enjoyed was at the very end everyone yelled "one more!" and
what came on was this mega-funk-bend-over-backwards-trip-yer-feet song
that just made my night.

ok thanks for listening.

I was there, too. 

As per the space- I liked it- more than ample dance floor and 
seating area for the size of the crowd, relatively few 
"traffic-congested areas," food for those prone to late-night 
munching, and a non-smoking environment.

I'll agree that the lighting wasn't terrific, and, 
personally, I thought the incense somehow added to the 
heat and humidity of the dancefloor. I only caught Jason's 
set (Spun), which was good- the only problem was that he 
put the system into sonic overdrive on the console(?). 

For me, the major drawback was the vibe (there was one, but it 
was negative). While the crowd's vibe ranged from non-existent 
to somewhat positive at the end, this vibe was pretty much 
co-opted by the tension, nervousness, and anxiety 
of both the restaurant owners and their daughter, Suzanne. 

Anyone who, as a teenager, had a parentally-chaperoned 
party at their house can probably sympathize with Suzanne.
She was definitely put in the position of mediator for 
the evening. It was painful just to watch. 

When I came in at about 12:15, nobody was at the door to 
take my $3. I almost gave it to Harry, because I mistakenly 
thought he was working the door temporarily. Harry (Who) 
said he would take it if I really wanted him to, but then 
set me on the straight road- into the reataurant/club/bar 
without paying (after we conversed for a bit about our 
pets- we love them doggies!). About twenty minutes later,
Suzanne and her father started making rounds asking from 
one person to the next- if they had paid or not. this 
was to be determined by an easily-copied, pen-marked X 
on the hand, which also washed off very easily. 
I, of course, forked over the money without much to do-
despite the way it was asked of me. At this point, 
Suzanne seemed near hysteria; making criminals out 
of the patrons for something that was her and her parents' 
oversight- namely, having somebody at the door.

After she finished these rounds, she took a break outside-
where I was at the time. I talked to her a bit about being 
stressed-out and basically tried to get her to take a deep 
breath and relax a little. She explained to me that the 
one of the primary motivators for the party was money for 
her mother- I got the impression that the restaurant might not 
be doing too well. I also explained to her that positive profit 
margins and the house scene were two things that are difficult 
to couple. 

All in all- it could have been really good, and would be if 
the owners were more organized and prepared. Lastly, it
seemed that the owners were afraid of the patrons, or, 
at least not comfortable with our presence. This vibe 
is what for me ruined it- I felt unwelcome and I think 
many others did too.

The ending was definitely the best part- that was A.J. 
who started everyone asking for one more. I was 
dancing at this point- I had on a green shirt/jacket
and some black tights, black skirt, shoes.... 5'3",
and a plain-Jane bob.

It was Shoshana who started everyone chanting, " I'm yours, 
you're mine" after the final vinyl was pulled off the deck. 

Larry- how did I miss you! Willis- maybe next time?

Take care-

jocelyn

I just spent a long weekend down south and had a great time!

Thursday night I went to an ambient lounge called "Dub" where Joe Rice was 
spinning.  It was actually in a restaraunt/bar near the corner of La Brea 
and Melrose.  The actual lounge was upstairs:  candles, big couches (I took 
a nap on one), cushions, good sound.  Go if you get the chance.

Saturday night I went to "Landing," which was held at the Improv in Santa 
Monica.  Wow, garage parking for my car at a rave!  What an excellent concept!  

Anyway, I really liked Landing.  Downstairs was the dance floor: Shredder 
Sound System and green lasers and that really hard trance and borders on 
hardcore.  Oh it was wonderful, I felt like I was back in New York in late 
1992.  I've really really missed that hard sound and the complete insanity of 
the people into it -- bass bin worshipping and all.  Lots of younger guys all 
facing the speakers and making spidery motions with their hands or banging 
their heads against the bass bins.  Women sprinkled around moving like 
lightening with sweat and smiles on their faces.  This isn't some sugar syrup 
groove, it's rave-aerobics . . . no wonder I've gained 25 pounds since I've 
moved here: I used to do this two nights a week for 6 to 8 hours at a clip 
(and not on speed, either).  Man I'm out of shape!  It made me feel really 
great, and had made me vow to pull out the stops and start spinning in that 
vein again.  Peace through hardcore and all that :-).  The only bad thing
was that some guy was MC-ing a bit over Jonah's set, but he was quiet and
harmless compared to some infamous MC's like Romeo Romeo and Frankie Bones.

At 2 am Mark Gage (Vapourspace) played about a 30 minute set.  It was heavily 
based on his "Gravitational Arch of 10" suite, which is my all-time favorite 
piece of techno.  I loved it.  People danced like crazy but I was tired so I 
just sat on the stage and bobbed around.  It was trippy and spacey and full of 
weird swirly sounds.  

Upstairs (up two levels, actually) was an ambient room that would have been 
perfect except it was too hot and eventually got too loud.  But there were 
pretty oil projections (haven't seen those in AGES) and some film loops.  Glow 
in the dark toys abounded.

In between the two levels were a few vendors seeling the usual rave junk:  
fimo jewlery, t-shirts, and mix tapes.

Brian B. tells me that Landing was "average" for an LA party.  Well, if that 
was average then I'll definately go back again, because that party was on par 
with what was average back when the East Coast parties were all doing really 
well.  It was the most enjoyment I've gotten out of a party I wasn't directly 
involved with since I went to the final Back to Basics in New York last 
October.

This club doesn't sound quite as bad as "Baked Raindrop" which took place 
at the "Real Rock Cafe" last year.  Pew.  That one reaked.  $3 for Spun 
sounds ok.  Maybe whoever throws this party will get better.  

When I was at the "Real Rock Cafe" (I paid ten bucks :( ) the guy at the 
door informed me that he will be having more of these "rave gigs" because 
"the kids love them".  HA HA   HAHA  HA     HAHAHAHAHA (do this while 
rolling on concrete or grass)

Our back yard now has restricted use imposed by our landlord. I guess our 
party on the street fair day was too much. So our tofu barbeque is not 
happening any longer. 

Mark Ameba had a party this sat in a warehouse which could be a possible 
site for "lets Have a free rave" july 2 . The gatekeeper was gone when i got
there so i never got in and never saw the space ... did anyone else see 
it and have feedback?

                            me and jen and chris and shobhan went by 
marks party on sat. night. it wasn't in a warehouse, it was at the 
familiar 24th and illinois party spot in the field.they paved a bit of it 
over for us to make it easier to dance i suppose and a couple of local 
indigenous people were trying to get everyone to pay  
$2 to get in the field.those who could afford it paid, the rest of us 
sneaked around the other way.it might be cool to do the party there, but 
it would be nice to have a place outside the city too.either way, we'll 
have to set up our own system because we MUST HAVE TECNO!!!!!!!ACID 
STYLEE!!!!

Do any of you percussionists or DJs want to buy a Yamaha purple drumset?  It has 7 pieces, and comes with a high hat, Splash cymbal, Crash cymbal, Ride cymbal, China cymbal, stool, and all stands.  All cymbals are Zildjan and Paiste, except for the hi-hat.  When I bought it two years ago, I was told that it used to belong to the drummer for The Tubes.  Interested?  Give me a call or email me:

Sounds like Dave Tristram on Electropaint! It just gets better and better! 
Years ago when he was working at NASA Ames, he wrote a user interface toolkit
for the SGI that had *real* raised 3d beveled edges, drawn with GL, so the
control panels can fly around and you can operate them in perspective! 

There'll be alot of neat computer shit in the Electric Carnival tent at
Lollapalooza! Paul Allan of Interval Research is sponsoring it, as a
first class "user interface research" opportunity! Check it out, tell them
what you think, and help shape the couch potatoes of tomorrow!

As far as party sites the 24th and illinois is a great spot (also a short
walk from where i live).  The new pavement is sort of odd but does serve a
purpose at parties. I was riding my bike there saturday around 2 PM and
someone was setup and spinning. The sound was great, but I too was hassled by
the locals who lay claim to that entire area.  Another good spot is the cargo
st. location. Beach spots are great and with summer here ... but I'm always
pleased with the east SF locations.

peace

did everyone miss the full moon or what? This outdoor was packed, packed, 
packed. We had a lot of fun, but the evening started out a bit shady. As 
we were trudging out to the site, we noticed way too many people heading 
back. We found someone we knew and asked what was going on to which he 
replied, "he just nearly got jumped by a couple guys with knives." 
oh-kee-doke. Since we were almost there we decided to just go and check 
it out for a minute anyway. I couldn't tell what was going on but there 
was definitely an agressive feel in the air (carried by the chilly winds 
from the bay). Everyone was basically standing in front of the dj 
(working off of the back of a pickup) or milling around further down the 
little jetty. I guess I've been spoiled by the friendliness of our sfr 
shindigs. At that moment, this place had none of it. 

Unfortunately, one of our drivers broke rank and took half of our group 
with her. sigh. But we stuck it out, and as the crowd began to thin and 
warm up to each other, things got much better. The site was good - plenty 
of room, parking, no noise at all to the street, but it was pretty windy 
and in full view of some prime Hunter's Point residential shoreline. 
Knowing how easily sound carries over water, I was surprised we weren't 
shut down earlier, but apparently, the cops had arrived before we did, 
looked around a bit for alcohol, and left. 

A high point was an amazing acid/techno set by Tony. Jeez, if Wicked 
let him spin a little earlier in the night, I might actually start 
looking forward to them again. meehhhh-moowwww-reeeez 

All in all, not bad. Outdoor, new location (at least to me), decent music 
(needed the SoundVision though), and 15 mins. from home. Just wish 
someone would clue Mr. Weather in on what season it is. Scarves in June, 
yuk. 

Adios, jmar.

Quotes of the night: "Say, could we have a sip of your water to... uh... 
                      swallow something?"

                     "No way man, I gotta get home. I don't wanna violate 
                      my parole..."

I'm very sorry to hear that 24th street has become such a hell
hole.  i mourn the loss of a TAZ.  that people who are living
in a place freely and outside social convention are trying
to squeeze money out of other people trying to use the space 
freely and outside social convention is *very* sad. it sounds 
like it's become just another pay venue. sigh.

A Reply Is Requested ...

 I've been eyeing the Sunnyvale Baylands Park as a site for some type of
SFRaves event , and I would like to  know how many people would be
interested in attending if -

1. I could get a Saturday in August ( before school starts )

2. I could only get a "sunshine" permit ( must stop by sunset or somesuch ).

 If enough people send me replies that show enough interest ( at least 50
positive replies ) , I'l go forward with trying to arrange it with the
parks folks.

 There are some nice sites there , one in particular is right next to the
restrooms , a neat jungle jim , and easy access to a nice big meadow!
The park is at Highway 237 and Lawrence Expressway/Carribean Ave. in
the bay end of Sunnyvale.

Were you the one who twirled around and around ballet style? Someone did

I just heard  that same trip-hop-funky song  on tha radio and it seems
to be the Dust Brothers' remix of "Jailbird" by Primal Scream. GOOD

The space is just a bit further down than we normally use but the thing 
that might be good is that this guy will provide parking so that the
chaotic parking on the street wont give us away. I think We will pay him off
so that he will not charge and let us park and thus be free to all yon 
ravers who perchance fancy a raveth of naught coppery obligatories.

salutations, allen@ameba

Mushroom Jazz - $5 crowded $1.50 Budweiser 
the music was not very good in the main dance area
lots of missed beat matches and a general lack of coherence
earbleed levels of top40 acid jazz later in the night
despite this, dancing was pretty fun
music was mellow and excellent in the front area
lots of (good) free food - veggies, cheese, fruit
friendly crowd
light weight social drinking
low budget - end of month vibe
lost my $3 thrift store jacket ;(

( I feel like I'm doing a PBS pledge break ...)

 The count so far is 10 positive replies for a SFR picnic at Sunnyvale 
Baylands Park in August. The date I'll be asking for is the 20th , alternate 
date being the 27th. So , I'm 40 positive replies away from commiting to
reserving a picnic site at this park - keep those replies coming!

	Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com
----- **** -----

More Sunnyvale Baylands Park information:

 Cost for a two-sectioned single large site is $130. Fee to vehicles 
entering the park is $3.00 each , so carpooling may be wise. The site
I'm looking at doesn't have a whole lot of parking next to it , but the
park does have a large parking lot near the entrance. 

 My first-choice site is located around the far end of the park. It's
located near restrooms and a cool jungle jim , and it has shaded picnic 
tables, two barbecue pits , and 25 amp electrical service ( is that 
enough for a sound system ? 25A * 110V = 2750 Watts ). The site is
right next to a nice green meadow , perfect for chilling and frisbee 
tossing and other open spaces stuff. One of the closest sites to the
park ranger's building.

 My second-choice site is their concrete "amphitheatre" - actually a large
triangular area where two park paths intersect . Nice hard flat dustless
dance area , but no tables , benches , barbacue pits , or shade. Some
grassy areas nearby . Close to the entrance and the big parking lot. 
Site fee is $50 , versus 2 * $65 for the first choice site. 
Park information gave me the impression that louder sound levels might
be tolerated there, as it's far from the other sites and close to the
Twin Creeks softball complex , which generates it's own levels of noise
anyway.

 I get the feeling that LOUD music ( Golden Gate "In The Light" ) levels
might be frowned upon , but something softer may be OK. The park folks
would take action "if other park users complain" , and since the other 
picnic sites are at least 75 to 100 yards away , maybe a little 
judicious aiming of the speakers and riding the volume slider may allow
us to have good dance music! ( Just dance closer to the speakers , and
maybe put the speakers higher than ground level? ).
 
 Keep those positive replies coming! 		Larry

 To which event? I assume Grateful Dead? You must already have tried
rec.music.gdead, how about ba.music? Although , I don't know what the
attitude is for ticket solicitations - buyer requests are probably OK.
 I have one ticket for myself - I thought BASS still had lawn tickets?

Hey now!

     I get the feeling everybody got drained by the last big moon, but the pull
is subsiding and it's time to get your body moving again!  Moving to Motion! 
Tonight should be alot of fun.  Three great Djs for your listening and dancing
pleasure.  

Rick Preston     
John Howard
Phil Smart

..in that order most likely.  Even though it's his party, Rick will open-up to
let the imports have the spotlight so get there early, the music will pound
from the begining and with a line-up like this you won't want to miss a minute!
 If anyone remebers (I know it's hard) AfterLife a couple summers ago, Phil
used to play with Simon in the morning at DNA.  Let's not forget John (one of
my personal favs)!!!  If my body will still work after dancing to DubTribe last
week...

..I'll see ya on the dance floor!!!

Peace & Strength      Tamotsu

see ya on the dance floor  (

  Well, I'm back from a three week trip to the land where they have a LOT 
of good fucking dance music!  I went to a varied assortment of parties 
including: 1 Hardcore Jungle Rave (avec 3000 other persons)
           2 Trance/Acid Sessions in dark basements of London
           2 US House parties (I thought I was leaving it behind..)
  And half a dozen pubs where they played semi-mainstream dance music for 
a bunch of drunken brits :)

  I also happily returned with dozens of new tracks, a few tapes and the 
new Orb. Not to mention dozens of cool contacts..  Anyways, the report on 
all this goes as follows:

  Jungle : The Jungle scene is BIG in England. Everyone I talked to told 
me it was about to explode in the states. While I did have a lot of fun, 
and the vibe was good (except for the asshole who put his cigarette out 
on my back :P) I couldn't envision myself getting REALY into the whole 
scene.  But they did throw a good party, great sound, decent lasers and 
lights and lots of friendly people. It was also interesting to note that 
the crowd was a 50/50 mix of blacks and whites and it was almost 90% male.

  The Progressive Scene : These parties were very personal and friendly 
(lots of E's) although much smaller then the Jungle rave.  I made a lot 
of contacts and heard tons of great music.  The DJ's were usually 
'acceptable' to 'incredible' and at most of the parties there was only 
one realy great set. It took a while for people to start dancing though, 
I talked to someone who told me the people in London cant dance until 
their E kicks in. Oh well, London's never been known for its bright 
uplifting aurora ;)

  Garage and House - This was interesting because to me, Strictly Rhythm 
is often pretty boring, but to these guys, it was the SHIT! I knew I 
should of brought some of my vinyl over, but oh well.  The DJ's were 
realy good and liked to scratch and cut the tracks up, something you dont 
see very many US house DJ's doing. Again, good vibes all around and the 
people I met were realy interested in coming out and staying with me and 
spinning at some SFRaves parties!

  And some other stuff - I sampled 5 different record stores and got a 
plethora of different tracks. The store owners were usualy very cool and 
gave me promos and stuff that was just coming in. I also had a 
conversation with Billy Nasty (one of my fave Prog. House DJ's) but I 
didnt even know I was talking with him till I was told he worked at Zoom 
records and I made the connection. Anyway, he was a realy cool guy and I 
got his new tape which is not his best ever, but has LOTS of good acid on 
it. (poor quality tape however..)

  For all the people who wanted tapes - Sorry I couldn't get those off in 
time, but I have a new tape with all the new music I bought on it, so if 
you want a copy, just hollar. I can't send them to everyone though, so 
its first come first serve.  The tape has a lot of trance and 
progressive, a bit of funky house and some tweekin 303's and a Bagpipe or 
two ;)

 p.s.

 When's the next SFRaves party? Or any small, cool party? I'd love to 
play some new tunes for y'all =)

Hello,

A friend taped me a few cuts from a CD he has called "SF House Culture",
and he says the artist is "Dub Tribe Sound System".

Is this the same as the Dub Tribe who did "Mother Earth"?

And, can anyone tell me anything about this CD?  Is it representative of
any particular "sub-genre"?

Thanks,

    Ken

More or less, under various pseudonyms this IS dubtribe.

Precisely.

Um, euro-techno ska dub jazz (ambient).  I dunno.  Some overstudious 
fellow at Urb calls it "the California Flow" if you're into dumb genre 
names, but if you're curious about Dubtribe, their full-length should be 
out within the next few weeks.

What *I'm* confused about if the CD we got in the office today by with Sf 
House Culture as the *artist* name... Don't know anything else about it...

Peace,

martin,  thanks for the info.  it'd be useful if you could add a little more:

- what is the admission price?

- what are the age restrictions, if any?
  (does no-alcohol mean all ages, 18+, or...?)

in the past we've heard of people being quite disappointed after driving some  
distance to a celebration only to find they lack dollars or years to get in.

the persistent practice of advertising parties without disclosing the price -  
neither on handbills, in email, nor on the telephone info line - feels  
manipulative to me, at least when i'm in less charitable moods.  how would  
sfravers feel about a Better Rave Bureau policy of requiring that all  
sfraves-calender listings include admission price, age restrictions, and price  
of water?  (we would not publish listings that do not disclose these terms.)

I agree with Robert Jesse... There should always be info on how much the rave
costs, and the age restrictions, and how much water is (I guess).  These are
important things to know before attenpting to go out all night.

i don't think it matters if you give a number that tells you all that jazz

Hoss Sarbaz-
     Can you give some more info on the event that you are putting on?
     I live just south of Modesto in Turlock and have been looking for
     something to do around here.  I am sure that other people are in
     the same situation as me.  This town sure doesn't have a lot in
     the way of things to do for the aroud 22 crowd.  Please post some
     more info and maybe I can even get some of my friends from SF and
     Berkely to come.  Best of luck in getting the scene going in
     Modesto!!

over downtown san francisco?  it reminds me of the good ole acid house 
have a nice day yellow smileys (except these ones are frowning)...what 
the hell are they there for?  i tried to read the literature under the 
sign but my asian language skill are nill...i hypothesis that they are 
some type of ad campaign by the chamber of commerce to warn visitors 
about evil parts of downtown...????? who knows...??? anyone? anyone?

*personally, i think  they should be smiley and not frowning and pointing 
to places that have good acid house music* hehehe

one more question...thinking about 1988 can anyone explain why "house" 
people were takings yellow smileys and putting bullets through there head 
and wearing these as fashion....(i am hoping someone will remember this)

viva la acid house

Susie asks:

>can anyone explain why "house" people were takings yellow smileys and putting

These weren't "house" people at first.

The yellow smiley with the bullet hole through the head comes from the
now-classic comic novel, "The Watchmen," which came out in like 1986
or even earlier.  I readit a few times but don't recall the significance,
of the bullet-ridden smiley, but I remember seeing it in the book.  Fans
of the comic started wearing such t-shirts a while ago.

Yellow smileys come from way before the acid house scene.  When I was
a little kid in the 70's I remember they were everywhere and often
had "have a nice day" written by them.

Yeah full discloser is important but I don't think lack of information
should get a party dropped from the weekly rave guide. We may just as
well censor events for having 5 phone numbers or being advertised on 
commercial radio. We all have things we look for when choosing where 
to go. I prefer to choose for myself.

There is a difference between essential information and information that
is a little more subjective. If I am going to a party, water, age and
price are key information that allow me to plan my evening. The
fact that a party is bigger or more commercial is an important fact,
but definitley not in the same class as whether there is water
(or washrooms even) at the party or not.

I think that from previous experience at Gathering parties, this party 
will cost $20.  Most big event parties cost that much nowadays.  As for 
the water question, I've never been to a Gathering party that had a lack 
of water, but water only costs a few bucks at the supermarket.  

All of you out there in computerland must remember that this is a RAVE, 
not a concert.  The difference between the two is that it is underground, 
so a lot of the information that is normally facilitated to people is not 
given.  I beleive that is done to either weed out cops, or to weed out 
people that are not ravers, and therefore would not contribute to the 
social, giving raver atmosphere.  

Anyway, the big parties are always going to be expensive, because they 
have to rent a big space and pay the djs that get new music all the 
time.  So knowing that, I would not be concentrating on how MUCH it will 
cost (if you must know, always bring $20 to cover admission, then maybe 
an extra $5 for emergencies, plus however much other money for what-e-ver 
else you might want :)), but which party will give you that feeling and 
atmosphere of a RAVE.  Don't just assume that all raves are created 
equally.  They must be put on by a promoter that cares, and people that 
care must attend.  

Fighting to keep the scene alive and healthy,

hope to see you july 2nd.

i have no objection to large events (often in spaces expensive to rent, with  
big sound & expensive lighting, lots of top-name DJs, security, and so on)  
that charge a fair price.   i think everyone can understand the costs of a  
large event that are not present for a smaller one say in somebody's home, and  
most of us appreciate the financial risk that rave producers take on our  
behalf.

it's just that i can see no honorable reason for failing to predisclose price  
(this has been a consistent habit of certain producers despite repeated  
requests to preannounce prices).  what does being underground have to do with  
keeping the price a secret?  that somehow the cops will leave it alone if they  
they think it's a free party but not if they think admission is being charged?   
lots of other producers of "underground" as well as commercial events announce  
the admission cost and they don't seem to suffer for it.

the feeling i get is that some producers don't want to scare away the  
potential revenue from (stereotype warning) suburban teenyboppers who will  
pile into dad's car to "hey man let's go to one of those rave things", perhaps  
with little suspicion that it will cost $20, and water more.  once they've  
gotten psyched and driven there, they'll overcome their shock and cough up the  
bucks, whereas they might not have even gotten in the car if they knew the  
cost in advance.  apologies if i'm falsely ascribing motivations here but  
that's the only explanation i can think of.

previous email to sfraves has documented people arriving at big raves only to  
turn around and leave dejectedly if not angrily when they find out that it's  
$20/person to get in.  you could frame this in at least two ways:

1.  stupid would-be ravers - next time they'll know better.
2.  manipulative producer who could've saved some folks
    disappointment and gasoline money.

more frequently, we read reports here of folks who are disappointed when they  
arrive at an event and find age restrictions they don't meet.  wouldn't a  
responsible rave-spirited producer want to minimize these misunderstandings?
