i just checked mail and it sounds like lots of folks are heading to waldo. 
after calling the X-MEN number, that sounds interesting as well - only ten
bucks, and indoors in case the cold sea air at waldo becomes a drag.
The X-MEN map point is at the Chevron station at 6th and Harrison - by the
Coke machine.

Since I really don't like "The Baud Squad" for some reason,
I've been thinking of different names for the group.  

"The Cathode Addicts"? 

"The Key Clique"?  

Nah. I think my best idea is "The Virtual Circle".

It suggests some obvious graphics ideas to go with it...

Subject: Vortex - too hot!


That's both good and bad - the music was pretty good, but darker and more 
LA-like than most other SF DJ's play, the crowd, though smaller than I was
expecting, were fun, and it had the "feel" of an underground (shabby map point
on lower Haight, the actual location was in this ballroom at the "Hungarian
Events Center" - totally inconspicuous from the outside). The bad side - it
was about 130 degrees inside, and there was only a very tiny stairwell for
people to relax and chill. To their credit they had free water and a huge fan,
but still it was so humid and hot that it took all the dance energy out of
this raver. 

They had a very inelaborate visual setup, consisting mainly of two single-tube
TV projectors (brand new - they project a clear, BRIGHT, chromatically
correct picture) displaying live-mixed computer animation which was VERY well
done.  However, this was it for visuals, which made it hard to see other
people on the floor, etc....

I got his phone #, I'll see about getting him to help with the rave, maybe...

Josh played the UltraViolet Catastrophe B-side, Jon, and the crowd went apes
over it!

I was going to go to Where's Waldo 2, but when I got there at 12:30 it looked
absolutely _deserted_ - was the crowd on the far side of the boat or serving as
ballast or something?

        I heard the most bizarre thing on the radio last nite. I'd just
gotten in at around 2:30 in the morning and had turned on the radio to
KALX (the UCB college station) when the DJ came on with yet another one of
those "call in and win tickets" promos. But, (here's the strange part) the
tickets he (she? I don't remember) was offering were for ToonTown next
weekend! I was seriously considering calling in, but I remembered that I
wasn't going to be in town next weekend. Too bad.

	However, could this be the future of raving? >;-}

	I can see it now - "For the freshest raves, in the mix, call us here

Subject: MRR & Connection: Problems and Solutions

The party at Mission Rock Resort, as everyone knows, was busted a few
weeks ago.  Now they require 21+ID and it's ruined.  The crowd is full
of the likes of beergeeks, leathergeeks, and standaroundgeeks, and there
is a noticeable lack of fun and interesting people.  I thought the DJ got
better as the night went on (he must have been letting the record go
from song to song or something -- he's learning, I'll say; name David?)

When I used to go there, I was hearing the people who used to go there
say `this was great until everyone found out about it.'  Now, I think
a lot of people are ditching it, despite the body count being really high
(too many people I'd say tonight.)

But, they're after a late-night permit and should go to at least 4AM
(as a goal, next Sunday.)  Clearly, this will give time for the boozers
to leave after 2AM, but I'm apprehensive about whether there's going to
be anyone left.  This party may have grown old and strangled at the same
time, and may be effectively dead.

Hey, no time to morn!  The Top sounds good on Tuesdays, and better yet
this Tuesday there's a Come Unity!  That's right, TOMORROW NIGHT.  Go,
if you're up to a rave and ok with the schedule, these are good.
Definately, one of my favorite regulars.  The DJs are good for the Come
Unitys too.


Now to the SFRAVES Rave:

Brian, and those who promote, please, please please please, don't
advertise for this randomly, or to anything with two legs and two arms.
Make sure it has a head, first.

Perhaps it's a good idea not to make flyers, just to avoid the temptation
of giving them out to people.  Word of mouth is the best way to do things,
and there's no need to waste the money on the poor form of promotion
anyway.  Just my opinion, of course, but I think it's worth something.
(P.S.  I hope the East Bay phone # doesn't scare people off.)


I'm looking forward to both of these!
Tell me how I can help ...

I called all the numbers above, and they all said call back the day of
the event, except for a few just rang.

Rules of thumb are not absolute, but generally good producers have
less expensive flyers, greedy producers have more expensive flyers,
disorganized producers have anything, and it's hard to tell absolutely.
Sometimes big producers aren't greedy.  Sometimes greedy producers
make a good party, but this is probably by accident and very rare.
Sometimes good producers attract bad people (rare), or bad producers
attract good people (rare).  Anything might happen.

I would agree, word of mouth would be more romantic, but we're not exactly the
Full Moon Massive, either.  They know they can bring in a lot of people with
just a few bits of info released the day before.  I'm not sure we can do that.
The flyer _won't_ be some full color ToonTown/Wacky Citrus/Feel-X deal.  It'll
be a small 2x3 inch postcard of a flyer, printed black on flourescent paper,
with just the name, the DJ's, the date, the phone #, maybe "presented by..."
and maybe a blurb about the buses.  As soon as I finish the flyer I'll GIF it
and make it available....

The promotion would consist mainly of: handing them out to people at small,
friendly events (such as: Come-Unity, FMR (one scheduled for the 12th), etc.)
maybe giving it to people at large events who are _obviously_ in the core
crowd, and giving them to owners of stores like Ameba, BPM, etc., to keep
behind the counter and give out only to those who ask or something...

As for the 510 area code, I _can_ get a 415 phone # if people think it's worth
it...

Trance Formation: Great tunes, bad vibes.

Pip and I went to hear Goa Gil spin on Saturday.  It was at 1300 8th Street -
the (old?) Flophouse = when I called, the guy called it the Jack
London Club, the old flophouse, but when we got there a woman we
met said it was still the Flophouse.

As we got out of our car, we met this very nice woman named Jade who 
was doing the ambient room.  We helped her take her CDs and art
work upstairs, and thus got in for free.  (Admission was $7.) 
Jade spins on KKUP (91.5, I believe) in Cupertino, playing a lot 
of electronic and ethnic/world music on Monday mornings.  For her 
art work she uses old computer chips, laser discs and CDs and paints 
with neon colors and sparkly materials.

After helping Jade, she showed us around.  When we got to the dance floor,
there was no one there.  The walls were covered with neon paintings of
masks.  We had the luxury of dancing around for an hour by ourselves.
Goa Gil plays the most incredible tribal/trance music.  I found that
once I started moving, I found so much energy in the music - I was
transported!

Then people started showing up.  It seems that with Waldo, Vortex and
X-men happening, the only people showing up were kids with nothing
better to do (ie, beer guzzlers with an attitude).  We went up to
visit Jade, where the ambient room became horrific - she had to
continually babysit her stuff from abuse.

We got to meet Goa Gil.  We talked about his mixing style - he
doesn't do as much beat matching, which stems from his experience
in India where it's sometimes hard to carry around crates of records,
so a lot of the time he has to mix from cassette or DAT; he does
believe in sequencing the tracks so that they become an emotional
trip - and during his time in the States he has been working on
the technique.  About his tastes - he doesn't like too much of 
the hardcore (too much of those sharp whirring noises), and he 
thinks a lot of the dance music out there sounds a lot like retro disco
- he seems to go for more smoother, trippier grooves.

Pip had to work the next morning, so we left at 2am, which was just
as well because the kids were becoming rowdier.  It was also harder to
dance when 7 of the 10 people on the dance floor were just standing and
gawking at the three who were dancing.

Glad we didn't pay $7 for this, but we supported Goa Gil by buying 
a couple of tapes.

So how was Waldo?

i liked it best from 4-6AM because it got alot less crowded. music was
very good but not great. overall i had a very good time; the scenery
was beautiful, and the great outdoors, bay bridge, water and seagulls make
for the best chill room in existence (IMHO).

Not strange at all for kalx.... Kalx gives away tickets for all kinds of strange
shit. Back when Mr. Floppy threw the first flophouse, I won tix on kalx for it.
And I was going anyway - convenient, eh? The other aspect of this is that you
alrady CAN win tix to Evoluton on KMEL.. Don't they have some kind of simulcast

Subject: Feel-X

I went to Feel-X it was up on a ranch in Santa Rosa, we drove up
late and got there around 2:30 am.  It was cold but the spirit seemed 
high energy (from the road at least) we paid our $20 and went in,
The crown had a LOT of Macho beer drinking male
energy (even though no alcohol was allowed) the all of a sudden the music
was torned _way_ down.  I thought to myself, I knew it. Feel-X bombs again
well, they`ll never get my money ever again.  I was with some friends
(my rave "family") so it wasn't too bad but I came the closest I ever did to
having a bad experience on e,  I was really sensitive and open and the energy
around me was aggressive and pushy, since the music was real low a lot of people
were just standing around and not dancing.  Usually, when I feel this way I just
get real close to the speakers and retreat into my own world  (I just surrender
to the beat and let it take me) but it wasn't loud enough to do that. 
But then around 4 am I guess this DJ from london La Paix can on and he 
totally switched the energy.  He played this great tribal/trance stuff
that I really like (morning techno?), they turned the sound up, it started
to get light and I was surrounded by cute women so everthing turned out alright.
Moonpup came on after that and he was really good as well, Neo Leon followed
and played "We are Family" and everybody started dancing in a circle and
hugging each other, It was genuine and felt good.

All in all not bad but I would keep the travel advisory for Feel-X in effect
and see if they can go two in a row.  This one teatered on the edge of being
a bummer and I'm not sure if they have their act together.

Brad,

Unaccustomed as I am to writing on this distributuion list I have been
sufficiently aroused by your review of Mission Rock to make a reply in defence
of it for its organisors. Of all the parties going on right now in the city, for 
me at least, the ones at Mission Rock have the best heart, the greatest 
understanding of what the parties are all about. The atmosphere at Mission Rock 
is comfortable, caring, and the price ($3) is cheap showing that the organisors 
are not in it simply for the money. I have talked extensively with the people who
run it, no boast, just a statement of fact and I feel that their influence has 
created the atmosphere that has been talked about on the net and elsewhere. To
support such people can only help our cause.

How you could have seen last night in the way you did is totally a mystery to
me. Is it just that you did not know enough people and could not find it in 
yourself to talk to anyone? Maybe finding interesting people requires an open 
mind and not making judgements about people from simply their appearance. As a 
regular to this party I have noticed changes in the people attending especially 
after the bust by the police but all things must grow. Any party is made by the 
people creating and attending the party. The more open and friendly they are, the
more one can be oneself and allow that self to have fun. The crowd at Mission
Rock is always friendly I find personally I can say hello to anyone there without
the familar strange look common at the more commercial affairs.

I would suggest rather than looking at people who are "ditching it" you look at
what is there and make your own decisions. Trends are all well and good but the 
good things in life come only to those who stick with the path that leads to the
goal. The goal for me is community, friendship, love, and peace for everyone.
That includes the "beergeeks, leathergeeks, and standaroundgeeks." If we can
integrate all people and give them understanding we can create a better world
for ourselves, those around us and those who come after us. 

Love and Peace,

Keep it alive,

Richard

p.s. Obviously this is simply one man's opinion. Was anyone else at Mission Rock

Subject: white water raving



Waldo kicked rave butt again - on the raging waters of the San Francisco Bay,
aboard a ferry off pier 3.  The cover was $20 again.  What do people think
of high covers?  Obviously we don't like to pay big covers, but what kind
of effect does it have on the rave?  A lot of people don't want to pay the
big bucks, so the people that go are either serious about their rave fun or
else are wealthy yuppies.  This time the crowd was good, so I think it was
more of the former.  I guess it has to do with how it is publicized.

Actually the moosic was good but not exceptional, I think it was the 
friendliness and energy of the crowd that made it fun.  Again, the reward
at the end was seeing the sun rise over the bay; since the ferry was 
fully windowed you didn't have to stop dancing to be surrounded by the
sunrise.

Subject: GG Park -> Beach Rave


We Arrived at Marx Meadows only to find a sign that indicated that the "RAVE"
was at some beach.  I nearby friendly person told us to make a left at the
water and go 4 miles.  I bit of searching revealed the location of the small
gathering and we hung out for a couple of hours.  It was a pleasant crowd:
no jockheads proving how hard they can dance and falling into the dirt, no
idiots on harleys revving engines and spraying dirt on people, a sound system
that actually worked, a speaker system that was not pushed into total 
distortion... etc.  *And*
they actually played rave music, i.e. techno, not hard techno, but techno
all the same.  No offense to Santana and George Clinton fans, but the first
signs of a dying music scene are often signified by the retreat to the cheap
thrills of nostalgia.  Anyway, my friend and I had a nice time spacing out
and tossing a frisbee by the ocean to the backdrop of a rave-like atmosphere.

Subject: RE: Feel-X

I actually like those a whole lot -- the ones where I can go, have clear
mind, and can be there to experience the whole night -- and the people
start out kinda strange (like you said), but later, like much later
(three to five hours usually) these people change and they get this
really awesome energy.  I think it really does take all that time for
those people to realize what's going on. Then, it's even better than
usual, at 4AM!  Because all these people are tripping off of this really
new experience that they finally understand and are just taking in as
much of it as they can get! 

This is like what happened with the Aborigine event at Townsend a few
months ago, and others I've been at.  I'll see someone I know leaving,
I'll ask why, and then something makes me have to go in anyway (like I
have to meet someone), and surprise!  phenomenon happens. I like that in
you, Geoff  -- you're always willing to wait it out and be there when it
gets great. 

It reminds me of all the times I say, with great pride, `I was at
blablabla!' and five people turn to snear at me and say `>That?  Ew!<',
which they always admit to have leaving early.  The Care*Free on Gay
Pride Day comes to mind as one of these (although I think everyone liked
that), as well as a few others. 

Too bad there's not more time for these things.

Subject: Re: MRR & Connection: Problems and Solutions

moment to think

I've a cold heart at times.  I think the artificial limitation
of only accepting people 21 and over didn't sink into me more
than halfway. While I realized it may have changed the people
who are there in general, I didn't realize what it did to me in
specific and thus refrain from generalizing from there.  What I
now realize it did to me in specific is disallow many people
who I'd become accustomed to seeing there. My sense of loss
wasn't counteracted by my realizing that I had a sense of loss;
thus I generalized from there. If I had realized this earlier,
then I would have not had an unreasonable review as I had,
since I would have instead compensated simply by only expecting
people my age and older. 

Already I see problems with my experiment of not thinking
beyond the end of a single thought (I've been doing this
experiment of stopping thought whenever I've thought of a
thought, and not consciously going off into thinking land
like I'm so accustomed to.  It makes for a much nicer time
at many places, the world is a nicer place, etc. etc.)

Now, I can also see this as a new place in time, albeit with
many similarities to an old familiar place.  I agree with your
thoughts about the organizers of this event.  What I haven't
tried is your optimism, since as you say, it's all these people
who continually exist that need to be accepted and thus let
down their own shields.  Somehow this reminds me of what I've
done with the ethic I've been learning from raves as applied to
general life: when someone who is racist against me attacks me
somehow (verbally, nearly running me over, honking) I simply
learn to see that as part of what needs to be ignored as far as
responding is concerned, and to instead look for the heart in
all those who don't or when they're not honking, running me
over, hitting me or yelling at me.  It's a strange cold world
`out there' on the streets, and yet this warmth has on occasion
shown glimmer from people I would not expect it from! I need to
do that everywhere, I suppose. 

I'm sorry.

Subject: Truth of Raves


My name is T. Miller. A friend of mine just gave me a bulletin to this
address that raised my eyebrows since it was about raves and Timothy
Leary's involvement and interest in them.

I'm a reporter with the SF Chronicle and am interested in doing a story
along the lines of
raves and how they could spill over into a social/political thing.

A little more background on me: I just graduated in May from Berkeley
and have been raving since about Jan. I'm fascinated by what the raves
represent and how they are so much more than just a nightclub scene.

Plenty has been written about the raves by folks who think they are just
another hip, new fad. I'm interested in taking what I've learned, the 
people I've met, the things I've seen and doing some Tom Wolfe/Hunter S.
Thompson style journalism on what's really going on out there.

I think the word needs to get out and this story needs to be told. I'd 
appreciate any help from anyone (or anything) along these lines. People
who have something to say or know someone who'd be good to talk to. Thanx.

Subject: rave update 

First off:  When you tell non-sfravers about the event, please don't tell
them it's at Bonny Doon.  We will have a map point set up in Santa Cruz
where I want _everyone_, except those taking the bus from SF or wherever
else we have them starting, to go to the map point so we can hand them a
flyer explaining the parking situation, and so we can ask each person for 
the $5 donation.  If everyone knows it's at Bonny Doon, they'll all drive 
there first.  When we tell them that we won't let them park on the highway,
they'll simply let all their people out and the driver will go down to the
map point, meaning we'll only get one donation.... the map will also have
lots of info about the site, about what to not do, about respect, and about
us, the sfravers, so I want everyone to have a copy.

and on to the more interesting stuff...

rave name:  Connection got 8 votes, edging out the others which got 1-3 votes
each. So we'll keep it at that (chmod u+x was next, and maybe that can be our
next one..) "Presented by the Baud Squad" got only two votes, the same as 
"presented by the Web", so I'll leave it as "presented by sfraves" pronounced
"Es-Ef-Raves" on the answering machine.

phone line:  Going great, I guess... I'm going to look into getting a 415 area
code too.

flyer: almost finished, I will be handing stuff out at that Woopy Ball Acid 
event thing tonight, and maybe get it to someone to hand out at Come/Unity
tomorrow night (unless I can sneak in somehow... :)  I will put a "GIF"'d
version on the FTP site by tomorrow, so you can download it, print it, and
hand it out yourself too (or I can mail people some).

DJ's: Carlos is still all gung-ho about this, and he's managed to get support
from Moonpup (from LA) and Dutch (from Sac).  They both also understand the
money situation, so that's way cool by me.  We now have seven DJ's: Carlos,
Spun, Dutch, Moonpup, DJ Drew (also from Sac and _very_ enthusiastic about it -
willing to DJ for free), El Dorado (Edan Cassidy) and our very own Jon Drukman
(note new spelling :). Spun is kinda waffling, Carlos hasn't spoken to him
yet, but he said he WILL get Spun to go, so I'm putting him on the flyers...
if he doesn't show, this won't be the first rave where all the named DJ's
didn't show....  Now the hard part will be figuring out when all the DJ's
will play, and how much time to give them. If anyone has thoughts about this
let me know. I was planning Carlos for around 1-3 or so, and Spun for 4-6 or
something. I'm very excited about Moonpup - he's quite popular in LA and 
supposedly is a GREAT morning DJ.  For anyone who stayed at Feel-X until the 
morning hours (around 6?) he was the DJ then.

Lighting: many exciting things which I will announce when confirmed....

Bus tickets: M Normal is finishing them up, and I talked to Mark on Saturday
and he said they'd be willing to sell them. As soon as I finalize who we're
going to do busing with (we may get the Floppy Buses, which are well-known to
ravers and will cost half as much (and we pass the savings on to you!!:)) 
Ameba will be selling them.


A few questions:

	I think we could make terrific use out of a set of walkie-talkies;
preferably with enough range to communicate between the car drop-off site in
S.C. and the beach (about 7 miles of coastline). Two would work, 4 would be
great. 

	Anyone who hasn't contacted me yet and is willing to serve as staff
for the event, please let me know so I can estimate how many people I will have
for the jobs that we'll need.  For example, I'll need several people just to 
help manage the buses, someone who's willing to drive Spun in at 3 to our rave
from SJ, a few people to help "watch" the highway to keep people from parking
there, etc.  I swear that no one will be forced to work the entire night or
even longer than a few hours... but I will need help, yes.  About 8 people have
already offered their services-in-general, and that's great.  I would like  
about ten more.... 

	Also, refreshments!  We must at least have water, and Kool-Aid is
_not_ expensive by any stretch of the imagination.  I think we should make
water/Kool-aid free, and maybe fruit as well if someone can get a huge discount
on fruit, but if someone would like to make a small profit I don't see a 
problem selling juice drinks or soda or something (just keep it at or near
a dollar).  As for something like water, we'll need to get some big water
jugs or those things they store coffee in at conferences... just not a keg. :)

	Finally, in my first post I mentioned to possibility of a bonfire; I
still like this idea, and I think it would be really easy to set up: lift some
of those shipping pads from a supermarket (or ask them, they throw them out
anyways), assemble them with some nails, fill them with crumped newspaper or 
more wood, douse it with some gasoline and it'll burn for hours.  If any of
you have ever been witness to a bonfire, I mean a REAL bonfire, they can be
religious experiences.  Bonny Doon is PLENTY big for the affair.  All we
need is a cheap source of wood. (I dunno.. drive around a woody residental
neighborhood offering to haul any excess backyard wood they might have? We
always had tons of it at my home).  Anyone with a pickup truck willing to
offer?

	So anyways... that's it... Goa Gil called _me_ today and left a message
(I wasn't home and I tried calling him back but he's not home either) so if he
wants to do our gig I'll let him, but not for long and not for money... maybe
he can be the last DJ or something, I hear he's great for mornings.

I also went to the beach party and had a wonderful time... does anyone know
who the dj before Carlos was?  He played a very nice set of a soul/chill-out
nature [he was playing when the generator ran out] and Carlos also played a
stellar set [I know, I always say that... anyway] he was really cranking and
even did some scratching!  There were also these 2 rapping guys that took
turns and Carlos was mixing them in and out of his set as well.  At the end
they kind of indicated there'd be another ["see you all next week!"] but
they didnt actually say it'd be there.  I hope so, if you arent coming from
the park it's quite convenient to public transit and a beautiful spot with
the ocean, gulls and pelicans and hang gliders...

Subject: Flyers now ready to be downloaded....


I have them in not one, not two, not three, but _four_ different formats on
the FTP site, waiting to be downloaded, as sfrflyr. They are in EPS 
(encapsulated PostScript - I'm not sure this is a standard but it's the only
PS file Corel Draw would make) a TIF, a GIF, and the original CDR (Corel
Draw) file.  The CDR file needs a couple of fonts that aren't standard
with Corel Draw, so you may have to resize the words and choose other
fonts if you want to use that.  All the files are compressed (except the
GIF which is already a compact format), and if you don't have uncompress
Soda will uncompress it while downloading if you type the name of the file
without the ".Z".  I put so many different formats up because I want people
to be able to print it and distribute themselves, too, if they want. If you
print the design on both sides of a piece of paper, you'll have 8 flyers ready
to be cut out.  I'm printing them on flourescent paper and cutting them with
scissors.  I printed out 200 last night, but was too tired to go to the
Woopy Ball/Acid thing to hand them out.... 

If anyone's going to Come/Unity tonight from the Berkeley Area (Phoebe? Andrea?)
get in touch with me and I can give you the flyers. Also, the design is VERY
easy to change, if anyone thinks it's necessary. Knowing me I probably spelled
"San Fransisco".... jeesh...

Here's the text of the flyer:

The GIF's are set at 300 dpi, so a laser printer would probably work best...
I'm sure there is a ton of available software at wuarchive under msdos/graphiccs
or something like that.  A TIFF file may be preferable to some programs...
I really don't know of any programs other than CorelDraw, but I'm positive
they exist.

I can also mail copies of the flyers out (a reasonable amount).  Send me your

so ..  oh yeah .. Moon Pup is great! he is not tremendously
big, but a lot of the serious ravers love him down here

also those palettes are all you need for bonfires
we had a few of those and had a bonfire that could fry you ten feet away
any place that gets a lot of shipments will have them in the trash
all you have to do is take them

On the suggestion of several of you I got a 415 number, and you all are

	1-415-267-4889

compare this to ToonTown's number:

	1-415-267-4886

yikes! :)  Now we need to think of a cool letteringscheme for this too...

Also, the flyer designs don't have this number... I'll try and get a revised
flyer design up by tomorrow.  I'm printing up a whole new batch for 
Come/Unity tonight.


I'm starting to get nervous about the buses... $530 is the lowest price I've
been able to find, and the guy who does the buses for floppy's hasn't called
me back. The $530 place, Pacific Coast, wants full payment 7 days in advance.
I mean, I'm sure we could get enough people for two buses out of SF by the
actual date, but I don't know if we can get enough $$ by a week before.  
I'm going to take flyers to Ameba tomorrow and have them start selling bus 
tickets.  Even without the tickets printed up, we can have them take money
and names... So any and all of you who are planning to take the SF buses,
get back to me as soon as possible!  If we get 70 prepaid people we are SET.
As far as getting a bus for Mountain View... I dunno, let me know how much
interest is there, if it's 35+ you can have your own bus. I guess conceivably
we could have one of the SF buses stop in Mountain View...

Also, DJ Drew from Sacramento is going to try and get enough people from there
to organize a bus from _there_, too.  So all you Sacramento people call 
916-369-1031 and try and work something out with him.... It would probably
leave early, around 9PM, and get back around 7am...

Other than the buses, all the pre-rave stuff is almost all taken care of!!

  You have to be really careful about using shipping palettes in a
bonfire.  I don't know if it is statewide law, but down here in LA,
posession of palettes is illegal.  Apparently too many people had been
taking them from the back of supermarkets to make bonfires.
  I saw a cop write somebody up for using one to make a fire once and
asked him about it. 
  You might want to find out just in case.  No need to screw up
on something this minor if the police show.

What?!?!  We always had palettes at my house in LA.... and private companies
use them too, so they have to at least be _legal_, but maybe burning them is

Subject: Be-In tickets

For those of you interested in attending Thee Cyborganic Be-In on Friday:

I have a feeling the event may sell out. I encourage you to buy tickets
beforehand, at the locations mentioned on the flyer. You can also get them
from me (if you can find me in the next two days, which may be no mean
feat...).

If for some reason you can't get advance tickets but still plan to come, I
can hold tickets under your name at the door. You'll still have to pay for
them (as will everyone who isn't working), but at least you won't have to
stand in a scary line or risk not getting in.

If you want tickets held for you at the door, please email me by FRIDAY
NOON at the absolute latest, including YOUR FULL NAME and the number of
tickets you want held.

I'm doing this as a favor, and I have no way to check to see if people
decide not to come and reroute their tickets accordingly, so please don't
ask me to hold tickets you won't use...

See you there!

although i dont understand the "(yuck)" after the statement
cuz frankie bones is the best dj i have seen to date
not too mention the fact that he also can rap while mixing
which makes it even better
and thats also not mentioning the girl with the big 
gazongas that was with him last time i saw him
(j/k, she's a cool girl, but that is personality based,
not gazonga based)

anyhow... Bones is a local dj to SF who came over from Manchester
if you like softer housier (?) grooves he is definitely the man
he is a doctor spinning on the turntables and he knows how to make
you feel good
he just lays down one groove and kinda tweaks it and distorts it every once
in awhile, but over all it is just one loooonnnnnggg groove
for you to chill/dance to
i highly reccomend going wherever bones goes
if you are into that kind of thing
(which i wasnt until i saw him spin and was just chilling in the park
with this stick figure of a man with some really cool shades on
laying his hands ever so precisely down on the vinyl)

This is actually the second manifestation of ReUnion, the brainchild
of Mark from Ameba.  Stompy (= Preston), Dianna and Destiny are listed
as co-producers.

The cool thing about the flyer is that it not only lists the DJ's, but
what time they're scheduled to come on.  I've always wanted access to
that information so I can time my coming and going based on whom I want
to listen to.  I'll post the schedule next time I log in from home
(where the flyer is).

The first one was excellently organized if sparsely attended, so this one
has a lot of potential (considering the co-producers).

Successful flyering last night at Come/Unity.  ~150 flyers passed out, and
the many people I talked to sounded very interested in it (but...wait...
I thought Come/Unity was 21+.... you're thinking...:).  I also swung by
Ameba today and gae Mark a bunch of flyers, and I'll get some to BPM tonight
or tomorrow.  All in all, I feel very confident that the flyering went well, 
and even if we stopped now we'd get a somewhat big crowd (Mark was telling
me people had already been calling him about tickets... ack!)

I may be close to getting the Floppy Buses, which would be a lot less
expensive, on a lot easier payment terms, and also a lot more "ravey"
than the other buses I was looking at...

Back to flyering: let's not worry about spreading them out at ToonTown or
that Salad thing or whatever BIG THING happens to be going on...

Just keep it at the small events, spread amongst friends...

Subject: Psychic TV, in Three Part Harmony


Prior to their big event at Senor Floppy's, Psychic TV appeared tonight at 
the Edge club in Palo Alto. They were great! The show started at about 9:40 PM.
Prior to the show, there was some music played for those inclined to dance, 
which seemed to be a small subset of the PTV audience. In fact, a lot of the
black-clothes-and-lipstick contingent was smirking at the few folks that were
dancing. Of course, there was one tall, really INTENSE guy who may have inspired
most of the dismissive attitudes.

 During the first song of the first set, Genesis P. Orridge climbed off the 
stage and into the audience. He invited folks to sing into the mike with him -
I got to do a short scream of "Intoxication!". There was another SFRaver and
his friend  who got to do a lot more harmonizing with Gen P. ( I didn't hear
your name clearly - would you like to post your own impressions of the PTV
show? ).

 In another instance of audience participation, Gen P. saw a guy with a small
drum in the front of the audience. Gen P. brought the guy onstage, and 
miked the guy's drum, so that he was part of PTV for a song! ( I wonder how
many people are going to show up with instruments at the SF PTV shows ? ).


 The music ranged from techno/house to industrial/grungy rock to old-timey 
arrythmic industrial. Between the first and second set, they played more 
techno; the music was provided by a DJ, then the members of PTV, as they 
individually returned to the stage.

 Other than the music, there was a lot of use of Intellibeams (sic), fog, and
video monitors and projectors. As for the crowd, I'd say that about 1/4 to
1/3 was really prepared to dance . Howeve, I left after the second song of
the second set, so the crowd may have gotten more physically motivated after 
I left. Giamma was there - I'll have to ask him at the lunch this afternoon!

As much as I'd like to see Psychic TV again and meet

Cyborganic Be-in is going to be a zoo.  Major articles 
in SF Weekly and the Gaurdian will assure that 
*everyone* will be there.  Since it is a 24-hour thing
anyway, it might make sense to pass on Psychic TV and 
not show up until 4 or 5am.  

So I was wondering... is there a Mission Rock thing this 
Friday?  Or does that usually happen on Saturdays?

City Ov Palo Alto
---- -- ---- ----

As you are probably aware, PTV played at The Edge on Wednesday night,
August 5. I'm pretty sure this was a warmup show for Thee Cyborganic
Be-In on August 7-8 in San Francisco. 

Now, I'm not very objective when it comes to Psychic TV: they're
certainly the best of the T/G related bands (Chris & Cosey and Coil
being the other two), and I've been listening to T/G since I was in
college. Also, I saw them at The Oasis in San Jose about 2 years ago.
I danced my butt off. So did everybody else. So, I view a Psychic TV
show as more of an _event_ then a show per se.

I saw the poster for the show at The Edge a couple of Sundays ago, and
I knew I had to go. I bought a couple of tickets immediately. I
thought, "Hmm, maybe I won't have to drag myself up to the city for
the Friday show..." So I called a friend, and asked him what he was
doing Wednesday night. He said, "Nothing." I said, "Yes you are.
You're going to see PTV."

Wednesday evening, we meet at my house in Santa Clara. We grabbed some
soup I made the night before, and headed out to Palo Alto at about
7:40 or so. We got to The Edge by 8 PM, and realized we were going to
miss David Gans on the radio :-(. Got inside, and the DJ was spinning
some techno, which improved my attitude. Headed up to the front of the
stage. Sure enough, PTV was going to be here: Paula's tape decks were
ready to go, complete with tape labeled "Ian Curtis." :-)

I met an SFRaver who was wearing an 'SFR' button, but I really wasn't
able to talk to him, since the music was loud. Let me repeat that for
emphasis: it was LOUD. Not as loud as Ministry, but definitely getting
there. 

Tom went to go talk to the folks who were running the t-shirt table in
the lobby. They didn't have any books, so he mentioned that he had
"Esoterrorist," and all of the CDs they were selling. They invited him
to join TOPY :-)

At this point, PTV's crew started testing the lights. They had 6
Intellabeams scattered around the stage... I thought, "Uh oh. PTV with
Intellabeams. I have a feeling they're going to be in my face
later..." They also had 4 more computer controlled lights hanging from
the light bars above the stage.

About 9:40, the band came on to do its first set. I didn't recognize
most of it, but it was the usual dance-beat-tribal-noise we've come to
enjoy so much. During the second song, Gen jumped into the crowd and
sang with us (we were right down front). He hopped back on stage and
did another tune, and then dove back into the crowd again to dance
with the girl behind me. At different times during the set, audience
musicians (small horns, percussion instruments, etc.) would join the
band for short jams. At the end of the first set, they went wild with
the lights and went straight into the Drumspace Zone. It reminded me
of a Rhythm Devils solo so much that I kept expecting to see Bill
Kreutzmann walk on stage with a train whistle. 

At about 10:50 or so, they left the stage, and we hit the chill room
for some sorely-needed time off our feet. The management announced
that the band would be back in about 30 minutes to do a second set,
but we already knew that :-). We talked about the show so far: "Boy,
Fred sure seems to be mister cool tonight." "Do you know who the other
guitar player is?" et cetera.

We heard the DJ slowly being outshouted by Gen playing "Infinite
Beat," and we decided it was time to hit the floor again. In the
center, this time, dammit: in the first set, I ended up near the left
amp stack for a couple of songs, and my ears are suffering for it now.
They played a couple more songs from _Infinite Beat_: "Horror House",
most of the samples for "Alien Be-In" and "Money For E." More guest
musicians, lots'o'dance energy. The only thing that was missing was
the smilin' face o'Dobbs. 

This morning we kinda decided that we need to go to Thee Cyborganic
Be-In, too. :-)

here is my official announcement of my boston-SF trans-national rave 
visit.
camper english will be raving in SF aug 7-17.
because i only have two non SFR friends in SF, i have to go to their
rave preferences. the only things i have scheduled so far are:
friday-Revelation sorry i can't come to PTV. 
sat-toontown- yeah i know, teen-town but what the hey.

if anyone goes to either of these raves look for me at a booth selling
techno t-shirts (texaco design, but say "techno"), or ask for me there.
i am easily identifiable by my BRIGHT Blue Hair. i'll probably be
wearing a poka-dot hat(my father won it in a turkey raffle!!).
i'll look for your buttons. PLEASE find me, as we have a completely open
agenda, nothing but a Let's Go tour book to guide us, and a preference for
being out all night rather than meeting the midnight youth hostel curfew.
if anyone wants to do something, it is possible that i can be reached at
my friend amity's apt. (415) 431-3983. ask for camper.

2. thanks so much to everyone for there SF fun suggestions. i look
forward to meeting you soon.

Subject: Examiner Rave Article

While flipping through the San Fransisco examiner last night, I came
across the following article. After reading it, I found myself both
amused and enfuriated. I thought that some of you might be interested
in what the main-stream media and the local authorities think of our 
community, so I've re-printed the article in its entirety. I've
refrained from inserting my own editorial comments into the text, so
that the author, and her quoted sources could speak for themselves.
Oce again, this article appeared on page A-4 of the August 5th, 1992
edition of the San Fransisco Examiner.

'SMART DRINKS' PARTY UPSETS SANTA ROSA AREA RESIDENTS
-----------------------------------------------------
Rural Neighbors Complain to Sheriff About Load Music
-----------------------------------------------------
By Donna Birch
of the Examiner Staff
---------------------

    Sonoma Country Sheriff deputy Phil Groat didn't know what a "rave" party 
was until 2,000 people showed up last weekend outside of Santa Rosa.
    And after nearby residents flooded his office with more than 70 complaints
of loud music and throngs of cars parked throughout the area Saturday night
and well into Sunday morning, Groat and other city and county officials knew
they didn't want to see another one in their neck of the woods.
    The all-night dance parties - weekend rituals in San Fransisco - are
notorious for the designer drug known as Ecstasy or XTC. But the party held in
a field eight miles west of Santa Rosa had the proper permits, and deputies
didn't see any Ecstasy, alcohol or fights.
    Still, Groat said, raves are "something to be concerned about." His office
will continue to investigate the incident to "discourage any future rave 
parties" in the area.
    Groat spent the last two days reading articles and watching television 
programs profiling raves, and he figures the parties promote "drugs, sex
and music."
    "Ravers" were initially linked with Ecstasy, but now the craze seems to
be focusing on "smart drinks" - amino acid, vitamin and protein-packed
beverages - to fuel the long stretches of dancing to bass-heavy, fast-paced
music.
    Raving is a largely word-of-mouth party scene that gained enormous 
popularity overseas by 1989. As raving died down in Europe, it sparked a new
wave of interest in the United States.
    But what's hip in San Fransisco, may not be Santa Rosa residents' idea of
a good time. Last weekend's outdoor party generated an unprecedented number
of complaints from neighbors.
    Before the first complaint came in, Groat said the sheriff's office had
heard a rave party was being planned and sent two undercover officers to
attend.
    They, amd other party-goers were charged $20 to get in. "Smart drinks"
were sold for $4.50.
   While the officers said they didn't see anyone using alcohol or Ecstasy, 
some people were inhaling nitrous-oxide or "laughing gas."
    Sheriff's deputies said they didn't break up the party because they didn't
want guests - who came from all over the Bay Area - wandering through the
area causing other problems.
    On Monday, the daughter of the property owners, Joyce Louise Swicord, 34, 
of Santa Rosa, was arrested and charged on suspicion of disturbing the peace
and maintaining a nuisance. Swicord, also known as Joyce Louise Carver, was
released later in the same day after posting $3,000 in bail.
    Groat said Swicord contacted the county planning department about 
obtaining a permit for the event, but downplayed the size of the party.
    On Tuesday, Swicord said the gathering was not a rave and, on the advise 
of her attorney, declined to make any further comment.

---------------------
end of quoted article
---------------------

Not only does this article give us yet another reason to avoid
large-scale raves by certain promoter, it also reveals the
closed-minded attitudes of the local gentry towards anything they
don't understand and the police-state tactics they are willing to use
to fight them. I, for one, am very concerned that the police are using
undercover officers to investigate raves. Maybe I'm being naive and
this is common knowlegde to experienced ravers, but it makes me very
uneasy, to say the least. Anyway, I'd like to hear some of your
comments on all of this.

Damn!  I forgot to bring the article I was gonna post.  Someone cut it out for
me and it looked (by the newsprint) like it was the Chronicle/Examinier.  
It's about a rave in Sonoma county a week or two ago that had a record 75
complaints against it but the cops wouldn't bust it up because so many people
looked intoxicated and they didn't want everyone wandering around with no place
to go.  It also goes on to say that the owner of the ranch where it was held
was arrested for disturbing the peace and some other bullshit charge that had
to do with assemling too many people.  She should of been commended for
creating the peace if you ask me.  Did you know that almost every city, county,
state has some kind of law against people gathering together in large numbers?
Hmmm.  Wonder why. ;-( The council members are supposedly taking steps to 
make sure that this doesn't happen again by researching and invoking laws
against this sort of behavior.  There was a quote that went something like
"There must be laws against this sort of thing" and of course there was the
usual press-like discription of mostly young, ecstasy crazed, weird people
that dance to loud music with a fast, heavy beat.

Well, your list administrator goofed it big time.  After updating the list of
addresses who get the calendar only, he did a:

% cp sf-cal /usr/lib/aliases.include/sfraves

instead of a 

% cp sf-cal /usr/lib/aliases.include/sfraves-calendar

In other words, for a few hours none of you were on the list, but everyone on
the calendar-only list got sfraves mail!  Eiya...  It's fixed completely now,
don't worry, but four posts went through sfraves in that time. Hey, I'm only

Great!  We needed a word to replace "rave" anyways!  No more raving, sorry,

So that's why they turned the volume down drastically....

Phil Groat wouldn't know.... yes, well. You know.

>and well into Sunday morning, Groat and other city and county officials knew

Oh no! Dancing and music and loving oh my!

The second and third I can believe, but the first?!  I believe maybe that they
didn't see anyone actually putting it in their mouth, and X dealers usually
don't actively pursue clients, so I guess it's possible....

>    Still, Groat said, raves are "something to be concerned about." His office
>will continue to investigate the incident to "discourage any future rave

i.e. let's think of some horrible things we can associate with this and get
it abolished....

>    Groat spent the last two days reading articles and watching television 
>programs profiling raves, and he figures the parties promote "drugs, sex

Oh, an informed cop!!  There's two possibilities: he could have read the
Image article on raves in February and seen the TV report on Let Freedom Rave
on July 5th (yea!), or he could have read several badly misinformed articles 
(or maybe a misinterpretation of something in Mondo 2000 maybe?) and seen the 
Los Angeles Channel 7 news reports on the scene down there (boo!). I think it
was the latter.... who do you suppose was providing him with this info?

Um... huh?  Smart drinks are cool and all, but hardly replacing X...

Hey, at least one semi-accurate fact here...

You can say that again.

>of complaints from neighbors.

Good move.  They should send undercover cops into Disneyland next.  And hey,
movie theaters would be good too. 

>    They, amd other party-goers were charged $20 to get in. "Smart drinks"
>were sold for $4.50.

Ah, but did the officers _try_ any smart drinks? I thought not! 

>   While the officers said they didn't see anyone using alcohol or Ecstasy, 
>some people were inhaling nitrous-oxide or "laughing gas."

This is easier to tell because it's more obvious than when someone's taking X.

>    Sheriff's deputies said they didn't break up the party because they didn't

Those nasty miscreant ravers!  Like there would be something in Santa Rosa that
we'd _want_ to do something to. :-)

Of course, the cops never told her during the night that she should turn it
down or else... entrapment, maybe?

>    Groat said Swicord contacted the county planning department about 
>obtaining a permit for the event, but downplayed the size of the party.

"Uh, hello? Yes.. a few of my friends and I are having a party, and, uh, what
kinda permits do I need for, uh, say, 25 people?"

>    On Tuesday, Swicord said the gathering was not a rave and, on the advise

That's right! It was a smart drink party!  Yahoo!

The full article, sans my commentary, will be on the FTP site....


I am also concerned about the close-mindedness locals have; I mean, if there
genuinely is a noise problem I completely understand that, but making a
blanket ban on raves is really silly, considering there are FAR worse things 
2000 people could be doing at 3am besides raving.

How "Connection" won't fall into anyone's traps:

a) We have precedents of other large parties on the beach wholly ignored by the
cops and lasting until morning.

b) No parking problems outside for them to complain about.

c) No houses within a mile and a half.

d) No money (besides donations) taken at the site itself - money will be
collected either when cars enter Bonny Doon road, or when the buses load
up in Santa Cruz.

e) As for the bonfire, word has it a UCSC group once burned down a two-story
wooden edifice with no trouble...

Anyone think of anything else I should be concerned about?

I'd rather have police actually in the raves than not; that way
they see the nature of the rave and its actual values; we're not
all about drugs, depending on who's organizing it and what kind
of people they attract.

For instance, did you see any blurbs about the one that
Mark puts on (one happening on the 15th-16th w/ Preston up & coming),
or some of the better events?  The neighbors wanted to check it out,
there were police there, the neighbors walked in, and they came back
happy telling the police it was all right, and I heard y'all left the
place cleaner than it started out as.  What are the authority's opinions
of that?

I remember the Vortex one out in a warehouse -- not bothering anyone,
not many people, not many drugs or much anyway.  Certainly not up to
fire code, but not much wood to burn anyway (it wasn't like the recent
Full Moon where we were all scared to hell about a fire catching).
The totally obvious `undercoover' police van drove around and around
and around, and never bothered anyone.  I like that!  Protection without
botheration.  In that respect, I like having the police around.
(This was near Candlestick over a month ago.)

The recent Full Moon Rave.  I don't know who was bothered by that.
Some road had a larger amount of traffic than usual, but well within
its safe operating limits.  We couldn't have bothered anyone except
perhaps an oil refinery worker on the eastern edge of the factory who
happened to have a personal distaste for techno, and even then it would
be so quiet I doubt they heard it over the roar of the freeway.
It was probably barely audiable to the neighboring communities (actually
not too far away -- just a hill or two).  Who did we bother there?

I think it does matter which rave on which night we're talking about.
It does have something to do with organization.  If the police are
actually in the raves, they'll eventually realize that, rather than
just tag everything to one term that has a lot of variables to it.

I don't know.  I feel a lot less oppressed by police watching a rave
than I do by a lot of other things.  Perhaps it's my underpriviledged
poor person's point of view which sees this.  Raves by comparison are
a safe zone, a wonderous place.

I don't disagree with your fear, but I wanted to at least show a side
to it that isn't anti-police.

Brad

I still think the keys are making a really unobtrusive event,
with people there to enjoy the event rather than the drug they
are just learning how to use and overdosing on, and making sure
it's as legal as is practical and that we still don't let the
authorities know about it (unless we have every last leetle itsy
bitsy tiny spec of a permit required for the event).

I called the the harmonic convergence number (415-281-0293)
on Friday night, and found an interesting message about a
beach gathering on Sunday.  

Something about a Birthday celebration, I guess for the
convergence organizer. 

Anyway, the directions are something like, start at GG park,
go toward the coast, get on the Great Coast Highway (or
whatever) and go down untill you pass the construction on
the right.  The last Parking Lot before the cliffs is the
place. 

(If you're into it, call the number to check these directions.)

I expect I'll be there.  Maybe I'll make an sfraves T-shirt
today... I kind of like the mutated SFR symbol (like a cross
embedded in/protruding from a womb?).  

Basics/The Gathering sounds cool, too, since I skipped the 
Psychic Tube... 

(Kind of off the topic, but Front Line Assembly is going to
be at the Edge next week, for those of you into the harder
side of things... Gonna be in my neighborhood, I gotta do
it...)

See y'all.

Buses:  The Floppybus people called, and it turns out the two buses will
be _exactly_ the same price as the previous bus company, $520 each.
(Actually, $490 for the first, $550 for the second).  BUT, they have
much easier payment terms; they only require half down, and 3 days
in advance, rather than full payment 7 days in advance like the
other one.  So, we'll go with the Floppy Buses.

Tickets are now at Ameba for $15 each (I made it $15 because the Floppy
buses only hold 33 and 42 people compared to the other one's 47).  

Does the corner of 4th and Townsend seem like a good place to launch the
buses from in SF?  There's plenty of parking around there, and it doesn't
suddenly become 1-hour parking at 6am either.

I also thought of a good way to let people stay at the rave beyond when
the last shuttle bus goes back to SF - allow people to park in front of
the beach starting at 6am, when it becomes legal.



Phew...


I came up with a rough budget for the event:

	These are all the things that need to be paid for: I probably
missed a thing or two but nothing major.

(Must-pays)

	Sound

		generator: 				$35

	Buses						$490 + 550

	Lighting

		oil-and-water light			$25
		generator				$50
		video projector/maybe WBL		$125

	Misc
		gas					$100

							$1375

This is a list of what I want to pay people, depending on income

want-to-pays

	DJ's
		Carlos					$200
		Spun					$200
		Moonpup					$200
		Dutch					$150
		DJ Drew					$50
		El Dorado				$50
		Jon Drukman				$50

	Sound						$200
	Lighting					$200

							$1400

As you can see, we need $1375 to break even.  If the buses fill, we will
have about $1200 taken care of. So, we need $175, or 35 paying people, to
break even, and another 280 to fully pay everyone.

As far as initial outlays go, half the buses need to be paid 3 days in 
advance, so $520 (I can handle), and everything else can probably be
paid for after the event.  If I need more outlay money I'll scream.

can anyone else think of any other needs?

	As many extension cords as possible
	    (I'm serious! This is a relatively big beach.)
	Strobe lights
	    (Lotsa power!)
	Lots of flashlights
	Screens
	    (For some of the projections)

Food

	O.J.

One thing I noticed at the beach on Sunday. Cardboard boxes make a nifty
dance floor when you lay them down over sand, far better than dancing in
just the sand. Maybe someone has access to a bunch of boxes?

it sounds like this rave thang is really going off
i hope everything goes well...
when is it again?

you _might_ want to invite cool vendors if it looks
like there will be enough people there
because a lot of the stuff that is sold make great trip toys
and people dont have to buy to play with them
(but only invite people you know are cool,
i mean who are not totally into ripping people off or anything)

one caveat, that really isnt about the rave, but kinda is
at a 'gathering' that was held recently (not THE gathering, just
some people getting together, it wasnt a rave, but there
were a few hundred people there, but anyhow...) someone had a seisure
it turned out to be a close friend of the dj's/promoters/me
and was a pretty scary/bad energy time
PLEASE be careful with the drugs you are doing
experimentation is fine, but experiment slowly
dont take a sheet of acid unless you've already taken 3/4's of one
ya know...
scary thing is, i dont think he did anything new, so it was just a
bad week, but watch what you take and what you do and watch your 
friends.. dont get down on them or anything, just remind them
to be careful

People are getting busted left and right
be forwarned.
At least two people were busted at the beach, the guy was a 
tall 5-10 - 6' white male dressed all in black with black baggy pants.
He sorta stood off to the side and then would suddenly walk up to people
and ask them for X.

Also, our friends (the two lovely ladies from Creation) are out and
about again.  I saw the Asian/Phillipino one at Eden and heard from
an EXTREMELY RELIABLE source that they are indeed undercover cops
and will be attending some Gay rave tonight (don't know
what that could be?) So be careful out there!!

Be very careful what you bring to raves, leave large amounts at home.
Only "relate" to people that you know.
Don't send people you don't know over to others...

forwarded by request of the author....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yesterday was a beautiful day at the beach.  It was a warm sunny day, the
ravers were relaxing and the music was great!  The view of the ocean and the
mountains in the distance combined with the ravers hopping up & down made me
feel like I was in paradise.  It was a rare Sunday at the beach because there
was no fog and it was warm!  There were at least 100 people there, including as
I was told by informed sources, four undercover cops.  I heard they were asking
people if they knew how to get A or E or "stuff".  They busted one guy who sold
some to one of them.  After one of them was pointed out to me, I started
observing him.  He was pretty much standing at the edge of the crowd all the
time, never dancing.  He had a white T-shirt and blue jeans with short blond
hair, he's a big guy about 6 ft tall, and with large muscles.  He would slowly
get closer to a small group of ravers sitting at the fringe of the crowd until
he was standing about 2 feet from where they were sitting.  Then he would ask
them a question and then he would do this to the next group.  I was observing
him get closer to a group of friends of mine so when one of my friends walked
away from the group to talk to someone else, I ran after him to warn him, and
the undercover cop ran after me and was right behind me (I didn't know he had
followed me) and he was right behind me when I told my friend that there was an
undercover cop trying to get close to them - he probably heard me warn my
friend.  Anyway, as I turned around, I was surprised to see him RIGHT behind me
listening in to what I was saying.  Then he goes, "do you have any stuff?"  I
didn't even answer him.  He stared at me for the next 30 min even when I was
about 40 feet away.  Maybe he thought I was a dealer or something.

It kinda detracted from my day in paradise but it was still one hell of a great
Sunday beach rave due to lack of fog.  I didn't see any sfraver buttons around
and I don't have one.

On a sadder note, I found out yesterday that a raver friend of mine who I had
been close to until he distanced himself for reasons he wouldn't tell me, is
now in a mental institution after a spaz out.  That happened 3 weeks ago.

Anyway, only 10 days till the sfraves beach rave.  I'm looking forward to it.

Love & acceptance,

Ted

Subject: weekend update

friday: thee cyborganic be-in at cesar's latin palace.  walked in to
hear fred "spinning" (i use the term loosely).  he basically would
play a record, then fade into another one without much consideration
for similarities of tempo, style, etc.  not an encouraging start.  i
did see many familiar faces, however, and it's always nice to hang
with your friends in a smoky room where loud techno is blaring.
psychic tv came on and did their shtick.  i wasn't much into it.  i'd
seen them live before anyway.  after ptv, dj carlos took over and the
evening began to cook for me.  i know all the faithful sfr crew are
going to be at our beach rave, but if you were at all dubious, this
should change your mind!  carlos is *incredible*.  he really knows how
to work the energy of a crowd.  a good mix of really fast hard stuff,
salsa music and popular rave hits.  wow!  he saved the night for me.

saturday: basics at an ex-metal foundry in livermore.  i don't know
what strange fascination livermore holds for The Gathering staff, but
this is the 2nd time that i've driven out to that god forsaken
butthole for one of their raves.  the dj lineup was most impressive on
paper but not nearly so compelling at the actual event.  for some
reason, the flavor of the evening seemed to be very repetitive and
minimal mid tempo techno.  i was sort of on the edge of being too
tired to dance, and the music didn't help.  had carlos been spinning,
i'm sure i would've been a manic ball of energy on the floor, but the
music just remained uninspiring for most of the evening.  on a happier
note, both sides of the ultraviolet catastrophe record got played!
strangely, for an event that was so heavily pushed as being totally
non-alcoholic, the crowd was rather reserved.  maybe it was the cold
and rather grim atmosphere of the warehouse.  oh well, better luck
next time.

sunday: went looking for the park rave but it wasn't at either of the
usual two locations, so i went home and consumed a large meal before
passing out.

so, let's hear about the ones i missed.  did i just pick some losers
or was it not a good weekend for raving?

So Sunday at the beach was indeed cool, though I didn't really start
enjoying dancing till I found my own lil' piece of cardboard to dance on
near the "core"... All in all, great energy, lousy soundsystem.

But, face it... I think the GG-park raves are a hell-o-nicer because of the
solid ground, good sound, shady trees, lack-o-fog, and grass shrilling
verdant while you float through roiling crystalline coils of reptiles,
yawning involuted self-engulfing cavernmouths, profusely bursting blooming
flowerballs without end...

Yes, that's why I like GG park better.

So why aren't GG-Park raves happening any more?

Subject: My weekend: Psychic TV, Band Shell, ToonTown, Beach

My weekend would have started with an awesome beginning on Thursday
when I would have gotten apples, a hair cut, and danced wildly happy
for free, except I decided to wait for the last minute and come after
they started charging a whole $5 for admission to Eden.  I heard it was
a ``Really great rave for that price!!'' after someone asked me how much
it cost to get in who did get there before they charged.  It was 21+ and
many without proof of 21+ were milling outside.

Pre-Psychic TV party:  Giamma had a really great house.  The people
who came made a really wonderful party, and I had trouble since I was 
trying to be multiple places at once there without succeeding.

Psychic TV:  I have no opinion, since the performances weren't intuitive
to me.  I also had a load of crap on my mind which prevented me enjoying
new things (usually quite simple for me).  Also I was tired.  This is the first
time I've heard Carlos spin and know it (well, I think I have seen him spin
before too but didn't know who he was.)  Well, I >>loved<< it!  Him and
Hardkiss (I don't know which one) spun so well that I almost got out of my
bad mood, and that is some awesome feat!  Perhaps it helped that I hadn't
heard great dance music for almost 14 days ...

Band Shell:  I had fun talking to people while waiting for things to be set up.
Psychic TV performed again and I was only somewhat better at watching it.
Someone played some really fast beat music for a few minutes (20?) and
I really loved it (I can let loose and dance better at higher-than-
sf-techno-average tempo much happier and easier).  This caused me to go
dance.  At some point I realized the people watching dancers to dancers
ratio was about 50:1, and I got self conscious.

ToonTown Carnival:  Can you believe it?!  I went!  $25, and, well, um.
How do I put it?  For those who love carnival stuff, this must have been
an absolute blast.  For those who need a bar serving alcohol, techno was
the music of choice.  For those who like to sort of stand around in the
dance area, you should have come early and stopped standing around by about
2AM.  There were many fems dressed for something else that were obnoxious.
The males which were obnoxious were also there.  They bothered me somewhat
less than the females on the dance floor, probably for biological reasons.
For the first four hours I was apprehensive (10PM-2AM).  I was told
to enjoy it.  That didn't work.  I didn't recognize anyone but Tim, his friend
who's name I've almost memorized, and about one other people.  There were more
than a couple thousand people there.  I decided to get some sleep, and found 
the quietest most private place to do it was behind the speaker stack (about
a foot from the speakers -- strange place to be quiet!).
Markie Mark didn't spark it for me that night.  I learned that while Thomas
is excellent at what he does, what he does is not the style I liked (he
played some carnival-sounding techno quite well.)
At 3AM, there was hardly a standing stud to be seen, and Jeno and Jan Cooley
sent me beyond all expectations whatsoever and I had a really great time.
This was a very good rave for anyone who likes techno after the ``beginning
part'' was over.  This must have been a great event for the ``beginning part''
for anyone who loves carnivals and techno, and I'm sure there's a lot of
such people.
The whole thing (except the alcohol) was up and running until Jan reluctantly
played her last of about 2-3 encores, with exception to a few rides which
shut down after the sun made it totally irresistable to do anything but
participate in the wonderful bunch of dancers.
For a queer like me, this was as Tim H. put it, `very heterosexual'.
However, like I always predict, this `very heterosexual' part seems to
sort of seep away as the night goes on, and by the end I was trying to
prevent myself from being overly cruizy.  I think it backfired, since
some people seemed disappointed at my conservatism.  Oh well.
Whenever I got interested in someone I just sort of danced instead of
watched.  This works much better -- gets my mind off of depressing things
and frequently causes fun interactions.

Beach:  wonderful.
Reminds me -- perhaps someone should go to the back of Berdicks and Sears
in Santa Cruz (County) and get big big cardboard boxes (like what's used for
big household appliances).  These can be part of our dance floor.


I learned something really neat this weekend:
When one is healthy and eats appropriately, lack of sleep can be quite
productive  and fun.  This is because the mind operates differently when 
doing this sort of thing.  Warnings:  this does require being healthy to
start off with, does have a longer than 8-hour recovery period, and usually
will result in a bit of a sickness when over (since the taxed body picks
up bugs easier).  Sleeping half an hour to an hour and a half every
8-12 hours helps a lot.
I've found yet another way to save money -- drugs are so expensive.
As Tim put it, he just shakes his head from side to side or spins around
really fast -- that's fun too.  But I admit, it would be much funner to
take certain things.

I'm going to stay away from this stuff for a while.  I noticed the
moon was nearing full, which is too bad, since I don't want to go
to any raves for a while.  Come the 20th, I'll be extremely busy
going all over the place (well, Santa Cruz, and then back up here
for the 21st -- `Raving Homosexuals' to see what that's about.)

Looking forward to the future,
Brad

Geoff, is it possible to obtain GIFs of these people and put them
in a directory on the FTP archive called "Vultures" or something
equally nasty (say, Pirannah, etc.)?

Someone could bring a simple Poloroid camera and get snapshots ... then
someone else could scan them in ... and then we can all `watch out'.

This reminds me.  Everyone ought to really pay attention to where they
get their controlled substances from.  Get good sources and plan ahead.
This has at least two advantages:  legally safer; physically safer.
The physical part is really important:  there is a LOT of junk being sold
out there.  I recently heard of someone getting what sounded to be PCP.
Someone tried to sell me some laced speed one day as ecstasy.  Yeah right.
Know your vendor.  'Tis what I suggest.

I liked the fact that ToonTown put three stacks of the latest Info E flyer
on the first flyer table coming into the recent big Carnaval rave.  I hope
that people picked them up and read them; there's some important information
in there that people ought to know.  If this flyering continues, then the
worst offendors will soon be all the non-youth who don't go to raves ...
(That last sentence is a snide remark to offset the complementary snide
remarks.)

What! Basic/Gathering was at Livermore?  I tried going there but couldn`t
find that damn Basco exit.  The phone message said that it was 20 minutes from
the Bay Bridge.  I drove for 40 minutes going 60-70mph and didn`t see any 
Basco Exit, so I turned back and went to toontown instead. Made it there at
around 4:00am and it was still crowded.  It had more energy than the last 
toontown.  There was a choice of an indoor or outdoor dancefloor and about
4 carnival rides.   The dj was okay, but good enough. (I think it was Jan 
Cooley).  I was surprised that there were over 100 people still dancing
at around 7am.  I finally had a great time at toontown.

Who went to PTV?  I didn't see any sfr button-wearing ravers. Did you all forgetit or just didn't feel like wearing it.  I was at the smart bar at around
3:00. Also, I still have not seen any connection flyers.  Maybe we should assignsome of us to pass it out at other specified raves. 

I had great success passing out the flyers this sat.  I passed out over 200
flyers at DV8. Just kidding. Ha! Ha! Ho! ho! :-)

Subject: RE: "What we need" list

Steel/stiff rakes to get glass/garbage away from beach;
I wonder if the rock for the DJs is "too far away" from the dancers.
Just a thought;
I know generator power was suspected to be a problem at some raves where
the generator supposedly didn't have enough eumph for the sound system;
(Just don't make this mistake, that's all I'm saying) -- is it possible
to bring a backup generator, or would that impede on costs?  Is it necessary?

Otherwise, this looks really really good.  Do we need TV screens when we've
got cliffs?  Ham operators -- great idea.  Do you have the equipment?  This can
help in case there is a life/person threatening problem to be taken care of
(i.e. Emergency Medical System calls).  We need a few large and medium sized fire extinguishers, 
and for some people to know where they are and have read the directions
on the fire extinguishers (hey, reading those instructions is important).
Also, having a red + for the hams might be reasonable.  No need to
advertise them -- just put them near one of the frequently accessed points,
such as the walkway to the place, or the drink place, or the bathroom place
(we need to designate bathrooms?  Yeah, how does bathrooming work?)
People will notice them, and if there is a real problem someone will
undoubtedly say ``hey, let's bring them to the red +''.  Now, that may
be a bad idea if the ham actually has no medical knowledge and starts
telling the whole world that there's this guy dosed out on laced pill #37
``right here on Bla Ble.  His name is ... Send some officials ...''

Many people now know this event will be at Bonny Doon Beach. Planning for
people who seem to be going directly to the event will have to take place (i.e.
a sign which says "connection meet at x & y streets" and put that location in
the voice announcement sooner rather than later?) 
Having a few kind souls able to dodge all forms and sorts of cars
and to go to their drivers and passengers and give full instructional
details with great amounts of cooperation from the recipients of
such glop, will be most useful -- if passengers can be siphened for
the few bucks appropriate for the poor people who posses them in this
``car drove to wrong place'' situation,  and the driver can be given 
very EASY ACCURATE SIMPLE EFFECTIVE directions how to park his car
7 miles south of here and get a bus back.

Oh, Brian -- from experience, I need to ask you to have people
who know Santa Cruz very very well to test your directions
when you do put them in recording.  This is important.  I once drove
45 miles East by your wishes, when I should have been going the
opposite direction.

I grew up there, and undoutedly have an abundance of maps floating around
my belongings despite the fact I'm homeless.

Someone else can verify the beach part -- I'm clueless to that (I don't
think I've ever been to Bonny Dune Beach.  Yes, I was born and grew up
in Santa Cruz County, no I've never been to Bonny Dune Beach, or if
I have, I didn't know it -- I was never invited!)

Err, on to topics which I know a tiny bit more  about:
I don't think we need any canisters of gasses, if you know what I mean.
I've heard rumors this is a very brain damaging drug, unfortunately
becomming popular (is this because of the increased risk caused by the
police agencies busting people with Ecstasy?)
It's cheaper, too, which might be why.

No, don't do any sheets of acid, or take any gas, or take 150mg of
MDMA, or ... etc.
That would be very bad.  Such a person would go to hospital, perhaps
die and/or go to mental institution.  (Well, 150mg MDMA is only two
doses worth -- and when I took that much my first time I didn't die
at all -- just I was worthlessly happy for two hours, which while at
the time was fun, I could have found better uses for such time since
it didn't last and I was incapacitated.  Way way way way way too much.)
I know someone who was told ``don't take any of this stuff'' to smoeone
in a serious manner -- first was one quite knowledgable in chemical matters,
latter was a kid who likes to do things he was told not to do.  He
also went to the hospital, and was lucky not to have gotten so much
brain damage that he would now be a totally useless body of flesh
regardless of heartbeating status.  This was gas.  This is the same
damn thing that two blockheads (well, perhaps they were ignorant nice
guys, I dunno) took inside the cab of a pickup truck (ok, they were
blockheads), and ever since have been related to the south as what
raves are, when they are obviously not rave material (they're now
either worm material or a tiny contribution to the dust pollution of
this planet).

I definately agree with Wantabe on this one.  Be careful.
Of course, I get worried about these grownups I know personally
 ...
I hope they really know what they're doing.  They are fairly knowledgeable
and careful, but I've seen what can happen when these people err on the
side of abundance.  Not really fun to be around.
Otherwise they're wonderful people, and can be even better when they don't
go off the deep end.

Note:  I am not knowledgeable in drug mechanics, and do not proport to
be an authoritive source.
All I know is that ignorance=death, knowledge=life, and that there are
many people who like to hurt us with their ignorance causing our troubles

Actually, I've heard of this law before; it's used in Davis all the

I don't know what it's like in CA, but from what I've seen here in CO, it's a

take turns having a designated driver every night, someone who can also
serve as a babysitter for trippers that might need it, and also someone who
can talk coherently and normally in case Mr. Narc comes near ya....

Oh yeah-speaking of getting busted -here in CO there is just basically one
group that puts on all the major raves-Poor Boy Productions, and recently they
got busted...Dn't know what for, since I only talked to one person about this,

It's possible that this message was elaborate satire since it is so
staggeringly ill-informed, but as someone who *does* know what the
hell they're talking about on the subject of drugs I feel I must
reply.  Also, I tacked some notes on the end about those troubling
narcs.

If you've got a question about drugs and you have access to the
USENET newsgroup alt.drugs, post your question and you will get a
well-informed reply, probably a lot of them.

>A >sheet< of acid?  Oh my god!  I don't know that >anyone< could >survive<

>you can handle it; get off drugs if that's what you need!  One sheet

>I'm thinking of these things they make into little 2mm^2 pieces of paper.
Your average sheet is 50-100 hits.  For your standard weak-ass
modern LSD doses (50ug on average) that's 5000ug (micrograms or
"mikes") of the demon hallucinogen.  That's an infintesimal
fraction of the amount it would take to kill you.  Basically,
you'll never see enough acid in your lifetime to make up a lethal
dose.

If you chew up a blotter, you will not, repeat not, go insane.
Unless you were headed for the loony bin anyway.  You will
hallucinate quite strongly and will most likely have a dysphoric
reaction (panic attack).  Most people tend to panic when all their
sensory referents go haywire.  If you or your ground team (the
people you should have around to watch over you; smart trippers
work with a net) get you to a doctor, he'll shoot you up with
Thorazine and your panic will go away.  You'll be a little rattled
but you won't go nuts.  This is standard procedure for all *major*
acid freakouts.  Minor dysphoric reactions, which includes most
normal dose flip-outs, can be better handled with a dark
environment and some gentle, reasoned talking.

Acid does not drive people nuts.  The few cases where people have
dosed once and gone hopelessly loony were people with schizophrenic
tendencies.  You've got to realize that a certain small percentage
of the population have a biochemical prediliction towards
schizophrenia.  These people shouldn't take LSD, but inevitably
some of them don't get the message in time.

OK, have we killed this old wive's tale?

Yeah, if nitrous was brain damaging then why has it been used as a
medical anesthetic for almost a hundred years?  Nitrous oxide is a
safe, legal anesthetic and deliriant.  It may give you a headache.
Extreme, exteme abuse may result in a slight B12 deficiency.  It
will *not* kill you unless you breathe nothing but nitrous.  The
same can be said for nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.  Suffocation is
suffocation.  Yeah, some clowns closed the doors of their truck and
opened the valve on a tank of nitrous.  This is not death by drug
abuse; this is Darwinism in action.  You need oxygen to live, so
don't tie a bagful of nitrous around your head.  Dump it into a
balloon.  I've never found the stuff particularly funny or
enjoyable but your mileage may vary....

>No, don't do any sheets of acid, or take any gas, or take 150mg of
>MDMA, or ... etc.

If you think 150mg of X is two doses, you guys are getting really
ripped off.  125mg is a normal dose.  By the way, if you're not
already aware of the neurotransmitter depletion side effect of X,
you should be.

On the subject of narcs:

No, they are not legally required to inform you if they are police
if you ask them.  This rumor is so persistent that it's possible
that it was once true somewhere, but it is no longer.  You could
ask someone if they are a cop, have them deny it, sell them dope,
and be busted by them quite legally.

Can you take pictures of cops?  You bet, as long as you do not do
so in such a way as to constitute obstructing them from doing their
job.  This does *not* include blowing their cover.  You can follow
a narc around a rave with a big sign saying, "This person is a narc!"
and they can't do a damn thing about it.  Obstruction usually means
really getting in their face while they're trying to arrest
someone.  But you can take pictures of narcs and post them as
warnings.  This was done in the 60's.  

Ah, but the really flash thing is, rave promoters could throw out
narcs for trying to buy drugs!  Yes, attempting to break the law,
especially attempting to purchase drugs, is a legally accepted
reason for evicting someone from a public event.  They'd have to
identify themselves as a police officer and state that they were
there on police business to have a legal right to remain on the
premises.  

Identifying narcs:  Yeah, muscular white guys are really suspect,
but most dealers know this.  I'm a fairly stout white guy and I
can't get a dealer to even talk to me when my hair is short.  Next
on the list is muscular black guys...basically, any middle-age
built dude is suspect unless they have really long hair.  Cops
*will* grow their hair out to go undercover, but this is usually
Feds and they're not normally going after small dealers.  And those
damn barbershop quartet mustaches that cops love, those are a real
tip-off.

I'm talking about local cops, by the way.  I really doubt you're
getting any DEA heat cruising raves to make busts, unless they're
looking to roll people over so that they can work up to busting the
underground chemists.

I was surprised to hear that there was an asian woman cop cruising
raves.  That's tricky, but cops aren't totally stupid.  They'll use
people who don't fit the stereotype, but unless they're really good
they won't be able to pass themselves off as a raver.  There's a
certain tight-ass ambience to narcs that always seems to emerge
regardless of gender or race.  Five minutes of chatting about the
latest house tracks will winnow out the imposters.

I hate to put this all in categorical terms, but one really safe
indicator of narc-ness is sexual preference.  Yes, of course there
are gay and lesbian cops, especially in San Francisco, but they
rarely, rarely work drug cases.  Straight cops don't pose as gay
unless they're absolutely forced; if they did, we might have a lot
fewer gay bashing incidents.  So if you're *sure* someone is gay or
lesbian, they're probably not a narc, although they may be a cop.

But, jeez, "be prepared" is more than the Scout credo.  Whoever said
you should come with what you expect to find has it right.  You
shouldn't be buying from or selling drugs to anyone you don't know
anyway.  It's just not smart.

I'd ask my wife, the lawyer, except her answer to any legal
question is, "I'd have to look it up."

Anyway, this came up in misc.legal and it's a myth.  Cops
don't have to identify themselves when asked.  They do have to
identify themselves if they expect you to cooperate with them
because they're a police officer.  But you could take pictures
of the entire SFPD narco squad and post them at every rave and
it would be legal.  They'd just use other cops, though.

DJ Monitor & amp - the sound guy (Derek) won't be able to bring a monitor for

a 100 watt amp and a single speaker?  Just something to replicate the highs 
and kick....

dancing barefoot on soft sand (and for those of you altering your senses

Finally, I decided once and for all to slay the police break-up deamon...
I called at Santa Cruz County Sherriffs office about 5pm and had a talk with
a certain Deputy Sargent Bonar... anyways, I had a friendly chat with him,
where I sorta asked about what happens to groups of people on the public
beaches around there after dark, and he said that as long as we followed a
few basic rules (the parking situation, not letting things get "out of hand",
not allowing alcohol to be served to minors, etc., no complaints from
neighbors) then they would not bust us.  I didn't give too much away; I didntt
say exactly where and exactly when.  But I did feel he was speaking 
truthfully.  He also said that no matter what happened, they would not
confiscate equipment or make any arrests (short of a serious crime, like 
murder or something).  He even said a bonfire would be okay...  I told him
that we were a very peaceful group, that we would leave the beach cleaner 
than when we arrived, and he seemed very impressed.  So, I feel confident
that if they do decide to check us out, we'll be relatively safe from harm.
I even said we'd have amplified music, and he seemed unfazed by that...

Subject: re: predosing (was re: ***narc alert ***)

Aha, that's why people come to raves on fire.  That never made sense
to me until now.

It causes many problems to come to a rave while high on ecstasy;
first, you may not get in for quite some time, and it's wasted;
second, it lasts so short, that if you don't come in at 2:30 AM then
most of it is wasted on a boring section of rave; third, there's the
possibility you'll decide to go elsewhere after seeing what it's like
where you went, and all of a sudden you find yourself driving while
quite unable to do so safely, once again wasted. 

I had a discussion about this with some people I was with.  My initial
conclusion had to do with the idea that older people have more items
scheduled in their life, and for other reasons generally have less
ability to stay up as late as younger people, and therefore tend to
do everything as early as possible (including drugs); this naturally
leads to them taking advantage of the privacy of the place they are
launching off from to go to a rave in order to take the stuff.  This
now makes much more sense to me.  At first I was calling them crazy.
Now I see there's a whole reason behind it.

Well, if I use ecstacy again, it will be after 2AM most likely.  No
reason to waste it on overboozers!  (For some people, alcohol is
ok/good, but quite definately not all.) It makes no sense to risk that
one month wait, my safety and fun just for the paranoia of being caught.

Found out that Evolution at  177 Townsend was having a *real*
rave thing Friday (as opposed to the Frankie Knucklehead sleep-house
thing they tortured me with 2 weeks ago), so I passed on PTV to
check it out.  Good choice.   The chill out room upstairs was
open and the booths and smart drink bar was back.  The sound
system and lights were great and the DJs were fabulous.  
Jeno started things off with one of the best Techno sets I've ever 
experienced, and after that I kinda lost track of things in a magical 
world of sight, sound and hyperspacetimeconsciousness. 
  
A Techno band called React 2 Rhythm played live (at least in part)
and gave out free cassettes of their and another band's (D.O.P.)
music.  The show was OK, entirely ego-less in that they didn't
even attempt to put on any kind of act.  They seemed to be there 
mainly to have a good time and be a part of the scene;  4  happy 
guys poking at some Roland Synths. The cassette isn't too bad either.

Friend who stayed to the end says that the music and energy remained
consistantly good.  He was also approached by someone who acted 
suspiciously like a narc.

I had to leave early (3:30) cause my parents were visiting  early
the next day.  They have never even heard of the term 'rave'
I described it as people who trance out for hours dancing to electronic 
music and wild light shows.   Mom: "At least its better than taking
drugs."  Ahem.


BTW, did anyone elso notice that the SOMA was swarming with cops
friday nite?  We went out early, about 11:15 and circumvented two
police checkpoints.  One on Folsom and 10th, the other at around
3rd and Bryant.  They were stopping everyone and looking at them
with flashlights.  There were also a lot of single cop cars pulling
people over all over the place.  I didn't stick around to find out
what they were looking for.

despite the fact that I attended my criminal procedure class maybe
all of *three* times, I did pass the damn class, and I can tell you
that there is NO law that prevents an officer from lying through
his goddamn teeth if he's not under oath.  and, guess what--he's
not under oath when he's trying to score a drug bust.  *especially*
an undercover cop.  they'll tell you anything, and no, it's not
entrapment.  to my knowledge ( and correct me if I'm wrong, since
it's been seven years since I took "crim-pro" ) entrapment means 
plotting to coerce an otherwise "innocent" person to perform a
devious deed.  entrapment is _not_ lying to someone who appears
to be inclined toward illegal behavior.  

and no, if a lying-through-his-teeth-cop busts you at a rave,
the evidence he acquires is *not* tainted, and *will* be used in
court if you end up in court.  << and please don't jump on
me for using male pronouns.  I don't care about pronouns.

my "legal" advice is to assume anyone who's asking you about anything 
illegal in a public place is a cop.  sorry to come across as so paranoid, 
but if you don't know them, don't trust them.

for instance, at the psychic tv show, friends of mine were approached
by a stranger and asked what they were "on."  hey, just say "nothing."
you can lie too, you know.

This is a very true point which not many people are aware of.  I don't think
there has ever been a death causes by an overdose of LSD.  Obviously, there
have been deaths because people had accidents because they were too tripped
out to do whatever they were trying to do, but no one has died from taking
too much.

before we get carried away here...
i wasnt serious about taking a whole sheet of acid
although im sure SOMEONE has done it
i dont know for any certainty whatsoever
but i think both acid and extacy have cut off points 
where if you take more than Z amount (sorry i have trouble using
X as a variable anymore too confusing)
then the positive effects of Y drug is the same no matter how much 
more you take,  the negative effects that X has increase
but the wonderful feeling is just as wonderful

of course i think everyone has their own threshold to be reached
so...
but basically, there's no need to take a whole sheet unless
you have been dosing much too often

the biggest thing is watching what drugs you mix..
valium, qualudes, extacy, pot, and acid mixed together
might replicate my friends seisure

OH YEAH, i remember what i wanted to post

IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS DOES HAPPEN at connection
(drug induced medical problems)
TELL the paramedics what they are on, if you can
it really helps, kinda hard to treat what you dont know
it could save a lot of money and pain 

and this is a rumour that was being discussed as teh cops and
paramedics drove away with my friend, 
but i believe that they can not arrest you while you are
too fucked up to understand them reading your rights
and they also can not hold any of the medical records
against you unless they have arrested you before you get into
the hospital
likewise if you tell them you are on all these drugs,
they cant hold it against you until they read you your rights

of course the first thing we did after calling the paramedics was empty
his pockets and make sure he didnt have any drugs on him
just some thoughts

I guess we've all heard the new urban legend -- some random at a Dead show
approached a deadhead and said, "where can I score some acid" and the head
pointed out a dealer. Voila, deadhead in jail.

Now, I don't care how true this is. It does provide a really interesting
lesson for us all. I am approached often and frequently by kids looking
for drugs. Hell, once on 280, driving about 100 MPH, a pickup pulled alongside
my convertible and the driver offered me a 6 of beer for some acid.

The answer to any such question, unless you personally knoe the asker, is
"Nope. Sorry. What did you call that drug again?" ESPECIALLY if you are
"on something".

If you want to mindfuck a cop, you can play dumb: "Oh? What is that stuff?
I heard about it somewhere, but nobody I know has ever seen it. What's it
LIKE?"

Then again, being smart at a cop usually just scores you some extra suffering.
Sure you get time off in the next life, but hey. I do enough purgatory time

This is a very pedantic point, and one likely to be misinterpreted.
It only takes ONE hit of acid to scare the living shit out of you
enough that you do something really dumb, like run into oncoming traffic.

Taking 500 hits of acid only seems to make the same experience, a little
more intense maybe, last a little longer maybe.

What I am saying is, don't be fooled by advice that "nobody ever died because
of an acid overdose." Plenty of people have died, because they took a drug
and got a trip they weren't prepared for.

O.K. I talked to someone at CopWatch an organization that keeps tabs on the police.

They told me the following:

	   true in antiquity but it is true no longer.

	2. We can watch them OUT them take their pictures, tell our friends
	   in their presence that they are cops.

	3. We can distribute their pictures, keep them in a file, etc.

	4. If we do confront them in this manner make sure our hands are 
	   visable.  Try to take pictures without the use of flash since
	   the cop can say that we tried to blind them with the light
	   or he/she might mistakle the flash going off for a gunshot
	   and return fire.

	5. We can even photograph an arrest but should keep our distance
	   at least 10 - 15 feet away.

	
The person also asked me not to use the name CopWatch in our dealings with
the police.  In other words don't say to them CopWatch says it's O.K. for
me to take your picture. Or stuff like that. 

He also said to realize that if you take Cops pictures' they will definately
be aware of you so make sure that "Your house is in order" so to speak.

A promoter doesn't know if someone is a cop, theoretically.  By
throwing out someone who is trying to buy drugs, they're being good
citizens, ostensibly.  If the police informed the rave promoters
ahead of time that such and such persons were undercover cops
trying to make undercover drug buys, then the promoter would
probably be guilty of obstructing justice if they tried to throw
the cops out.  But if the rave promoters don't know that such and
such people are narcs, they're doing the right thing, in the eyes
of the law, in throwing them out if they're blatantly trying to buy
drugs.

Practically speaking, if it becomes obvious that rave promoters are
trying to clear out the narcs, they're going to get no end of
quasi-legal hassles.  Their permits will have to be letter perfect
and fire inspectors will shut them down if they can.  But if rave
promoters just make a policy of chucking out the most blatant
buyers and sellers, which they are well within their rights to do,
the cops will have no choice but to applaud.  It wouldn't be such a
bad thing.  It would make it a lot harder for cops to work
undercover and it would get rid of the clueless dufes who wander
around shouting, "Anybuddy got drugz?"  The cognisceti would still
be able to make subtle connections.

I just *knew* that someone would take my statement and jump right
on their high horse, no matter how many caveats I put in.  I'm sure
you just love to exercise your sanctimony whenever you can, but did
it occur to you that you're making exactly the same assumptions
about sexual orientation that you're accusing me of making?  I
purposely phrased my comments to be preference neutral because I
don't think I should have to trot out my orientation constantly to
assert my legitimacy.  You can go read my posts in soc.motss if you
feel you must make your damn judgements about me.

Are you a faggot narc-head from hell?  If you aren't, I'm not real
interested in your "insights" into GLB cop or GLB dealer culture.
Bluntly, I *know* gay dealers and I know of the relative impunity
with which they ply their trade because of the insular nature of
the gay community.  Hell, we could all learn something from the gay
community.  They have the solidarity not to roll over on each other
if they get busted, and thus they know that if they deal
exclusively with each other that they're mostly safe.  I also know
that gay cops are almost always locked out of the hard-core bureaus
like homicide and narcotics, so there're rarely gays working
undercover for drug buys.  It is one of the few positive side
effects of the bias blight.  It's also rare that gay cops are asked
to use their sexual preference as cover in any kind of duty that
specifically targets the gay community; they're not asked to be
Quislings.  This wouldn't necessarily include posing as a dealer at
a rave but it's still a consideration.

You're always taking a chance in buying or selling drugs.  I was
just trying to lay out some clues to make it safer, not recommend
whether you should or shouldn't.  If some white beefy hick asks you
for "stuff," avoid 'em like the plague.  If some young Latino
hipster with floppy hat, pink triangle button, and a nipple ring is
quietly dealing doses, he's probably safe.  Between these two
extremes are a host of variations you have to be aware of so that
you can make informed judgements.

>there are some assumptions in your comments that I don't buy:
>	
>	1.  homosexuals act in an identifiably "homosexual" manner 

Smooching your same sex honey is usually a good sign that you're at
least bi.  Besides, GLB folks identify each other by behavior and
dress all the time.  It's great that everybody pays lip service to
the idea that GLB's are indistinguishable.  They should 'cause they
walk past lipstick lesbians and suit-and-tie gays every day without
ever knowing their preference.  But it's also true that if someone
is a screaming queen or totally butch, they're probably gay or
lesbian.  When you're talking about drugs, you can't let political
considerations get in the way of evaluating people because the
stakes are too high.

>	2.  heterosexuals do not act in this manner 

Yeah, all those white hetero narcs are going to neck furiously just
to fake out everyone.  Not bloody likely...

I've never heard of cops posing as gay or lesbian for any duty other
than cruising for queer bashing.  Male cops would rather quit the
force rather than pose as a fag.  So, no, that bearded guy with a
pink triangle button isn't necessarily queer, but I'd stake my
freedom (and I do) that's he's not a cop.

Did I say this?  Did I even imply it?  All I said was that it was
unlikely they'd be a narc.  I didn't even say GLB folks wouldn't be
cops.  You had absolutely no grounds to draw this conclusion.
Queer preaching, the blight of the 90's.

There are some sleazy gay dealers out there.  You've got no
guarantee that someone is reputable just on the basis of their
orientation.

Sorry, but this is totally false.  Entrapment is solely
determined by whether or not the police officer was enticing
you to break the law.  If you buy drugs from a cop, they can
legally bust you.  If they're hawking drugs to all comers and
you buy, they can bust you.  If they pick you out and
repeatedly offer you drugs and you finally succumb and buy,
that's entrapment.  Whether or not you ask if they are police
beforehand and whether or not they correctly inform you, it
has no bearing on whether or not they engaged in entrapment.

You shouldn't rely on the entrapment exclusion anyway since
it's been almost totally eroded.   If they want to target you
specifically, they'll bust a dealer and get them to try to
sell you drugs.  The dealer can follow you all over the place
trying to sell you drugs and if you do, they can bust you.  If
the cops do it, it's entrapment; if their agent does it, it's
legal.  Ain't the law grand?

   but i think both acid and extacy have cut off points 
   where if you take more than Z amount (sorry i have trouble using
   X as a variable anymore too confusing)
   then the positive effects of Y drug is the same no matter how much 
   more you take,  the negative effects that X has increase
   but the wonderful feeling is just as wonderful

Let's be clear.

As a couple people have said, LSD is somewhat unusual in that there is
no physiological overdose point: after you take as much as your brain
can process, additional amounts have no effect, except to make the
trip last longer.  This saturation point is somewhere around 500
micrograms.  (Psychologically is another matter -- I wouldn't
recommend taking more than 1/10 that amount for something like a rave
-- any more could easily be "too much" in the psychological sense.
Actually I don't recommend LSD as a party drug at all, but if you
must...)

Physiological overdosing on MDMA most certainly *is* possible, as it
is with most drugs.  Fatalities are rare, though I have had a friend
end up in the hospital after taking some 500 mg.  Above 200-250 mg.
(depending on body weight & personal biochemistry) there can be loss
of consciousness -- the experience is most definitely *not* fun -- I'm
afraid I speak from personal experience.  (All years ago -- I don't
use any of this stuff anymore.)

Bravo to Gert N. for setting some things right.  The only things I'd add
are:

Think of acid and other psychedelics as amplifiers of your current mental
state (hopefully happy).  Don't take them if you have a mental histroy
or if you just broke up with someone or if your way stressed in general.
Nothing is absolute but if you have thins going on in your life your gonna
think about them when you trip and if thinking about these things when your
tripping will bum you out then wait and trip next time.  Also the toxicity
of LSD is about that of water.  It would literaly be easier to drown in it
then it would to fataly O.D.  And about that gas (one of my personal faves),
sure it kills brain cells but not from some toxic reaction, from oxygen
deprivation.  You would get the same results from holding your breath that
long or inhailing helium.  Killing brain cells sounds worse than it realy is.
We all do it every day.  In fact, you kill brain cells when you sneeze.  Oh, 
ya and doing the gas to much can be hard on your liver, I just recently
found out.

Some of us have difficulties finding "good, safe sources."  I
feel sort of in a vacuum here in geekland.  Universities seem
to have a closer-knit culture.

Another reason I look forward to legalization... I'd like to be
able to walk into an intoxicants store, buy some beer and some
doses, and know exactly what I'm getting, what the dosage is,
and what the non-active ingredients are.  

And an information sheet, to remedy the ignorance of people who
think that 500 hits are "a little more intense" and "last a
little longer" than one.  Ugh.  Maintain a healthy skepticism about
the information you read here, people.  Some of it is less than
useful.

But until that utopia, these transactions are going to be
dangerous for both buyer & seller.  The only people who benefit
are the Drug Warriors, who get to confiscate people's property &
keep the proceeds, without the trivial inconvenience of a trial
first.  (I think of Rome at some of its more corrupt moments when
I hear these stories.)

A message for Doc B-
Thanks for setting me straight about entrapment, 'cause 
I sure don't wanta be misleading as far as that subject 
is concerned.

On a Lighter Note:

What's everybody going to be doing this coming weekend?

The next two upcoming Fridays are confusing me.
21- Warp Factor X vs. Destination Venus vs. Juice???
28- Anythyst vs. Cool World(no) vs. 12hr. mystery salad(no) 
vs. Messsiah vs. Juicy Fruit????

Does anyone else feel a little overwhelmed? I feel as though 
I'm being caught in a late summer get-it-while-it's-hot promotional war
with everyone making that last ditch attempt to sell their summer stock 
before they get hazed out by the Back to School/Fall fashions...

Lately, I've been feeling like I'm at the rave sale rack.
Is it just me? Am I crazy? Or maybe depressing?
Actually, it's not that I haven't been feeling high energy 
and having fun and smiling gleefully while dancing heartily
at the raves I go to; it's just that I sense a strange feeling 
of desperation in the energy at raves lately. I'm probably 
embarassing myself, right? 

I think the sfraves rave will really hit the spot for me.

Anyway- I got my Saturday planned-

Drive up early to rave at Russian River- set up house (my tent). 
Lounge, nap, help the production people get it together (if they 
want me). Dance like a silver thimblefull of joy. My favorite part- 
watch the silhouettes moving against the light of the sunrise. Dance 
some more. Crash in the tent. Wake up- drive home safely, sound good? 
Maybe I should just skip WFX, DV, and Juice on Friday so I have 
energy Saturday/Sunday?

I'm in need of direction!

Thanks-

Jocelyn

Subject: It's a white thing.


I've been in the Bay Area for a little more than 1 year, and have been
to a couple raves. I would like to get some comments on one troubling
observation.

In New York I used to go to a lot of what were just called 'parties',
(I actually don't remember them beign called anything) but in the CA
sense they would be called raves. These parties were typically put
together for the purpose of exposing some neighborhood rappers.  They
were great. I love rap music, and I especially love being in a club
with people of all races and zero racial tension. (The bathrooms were a
problem, but all you had to do was stay out.)

The rave scene here is so white, and there are no live rappers.

Am I just going to the wrong places? (I hope so. If so fill me in!)

The techno sound is okay, some do it better than others. But the
thought I had at Teen-Town was, out of >1000 I don't see a single black
person.  Coming from NYC I thought this was a statistical
impossiblity.

Then, the total absence of lyrics hit me. I thought, are we escaping
the social issues inherent in rap music?  Most rap is boasting, but of
course a lot of it today is dealing with issues most (white) people
don't want to deal with.

Maybe a better question is who's spinning rap around here? If I get
some responses I can at least seek out the DJ's.

I hope no one takes any offense, I certainly don't intend any.

I'm not trying to stir up any paranoia (well, not more than a healthy

have computers too.  I'd be willing to bet that alt.drugs and alt.rave
are monitored by the DEA, and since this mailing list was recently
publicized there, they probably have either already subscribed or will
soon.

Recently a fellow in one of the Usenet newsgroups made a remark in a
posting that could be construed to mean that he wanted to kill the
president.  He was visited the next day by federal agents who wanted
to discuss his post with him.  Remember, although something may seem

a different take:  one of the reasons i like house is precisely because
most of it has no lyrics.   during some of my favorite times dancing -
after hours of tireless movement, consciousness heightened, possibly
eyes closed for stretches of time - the mind freewheels in directions
that come from within.  were there lyrics, this direction would be
externally imposed.

sometimes it's kind of fun to have just a single word or short phrase
in a song:  like tossing a pebble into a still pond, thoughts ripple
out from the disturbance.  again, what happens mainly comes from within. 
linguistic Vorticism.

this is not to berate the value of lyrics as a medium of social and
political expression - it's just not what i seek while i'm dancing.

Paranoia! How can you judge an innocent person from a cop? Maybe the
person is just sort of stupid and asks for drugs at a rave. Do you
convict them? That just destoys the scene.

Unfortunately  your observations are true but I think that the scene
here will metamorphasize.  I see more and more African-americans
at each rave that I go to and more POC (people of color) DJ are showing up.

I myself love rap but don't care to hear some DJ or Rapper boasting
while I'm in the throws of ecstasy.  Although I don't mind vocals in my
house music, I heard this GREAT Deephouse cut on KPFA (that's right!
KPFA) today, it was on the hiphop program and the DJ that was filling in for
Davy D spun a little Deephouse and some HipHouse (we need more Hip House
at raves!).  Now I don't want to start this flame war over wailing diva's
again but I think the rave scene (which is supposed to be about all
groups and races comming together) should be able to tolerate some 
DIVERSITY in it's music. Anyway this deephouse song had this wailing
diva going off about how it was time for a CHANGE! It was great!

I agree wholeheartedly and I am glad to see so much music coming out
these days without vocals, despite my indifference to most techno that
I hear.

Last month on the net someone simply could not understand why I don't
like to have someone on a record screaming 'EVERYBODY DANCE NOW!!'
 (or what have you) at me. Oh well, in matters of taste there are no disputes.

Exception that proves the rule, IMHO:

that catchy Opus III song, 'It's gonna be a fine afternoon...' (which
has only just made it to Seattle) and somehow transcends its banality.
I like it.

Surprisingly enough, people loved it.  Whistles blew really hard, etc, ;-).

Subject: Only doping their (#$!@!) job..

  You know I hate to say it, but these cops..although obviously we have
serious distaste and reservations about what they are doing...are\
only doing their job...


I mean, what do you expect...Raves (and any pay-for event..) are public spaces...
and people openly selling drugs to people they dont know are only
asking for trouble...I'm just surprised that there has been so little
scrutiny of the rave scene..honestly...

  If people want to take the risk of trying to expose these people..
(and I am sure that there is a risk of pointing out the wrong people..)
they should be a lot more than 90% sure that what they are saying is true..
I mean.. they could be inciting mob action that could result in people
getting hurt...
  And bringing a lot of undeserved scrutiny to the rave-list, I might add.

  I mean, it is a drag seeing Joe the Ecstasy Dealer getting hauled away..
but lets face it, these people go to events figuring that risk into
their lives...that's why they charge so much for the damn stuff..

(too much, in my opinion..to warrant buying it anymore..)

So maybye we should all get off our damn soapboxes and just realize that we
live in America/Amerika... All that energy would be far better expended
trying to change the drug laws....in my opinion...

  Just my 0.000002 cents worth...

where oh where is the FMR? where oh where could it be?

			--------------------

PS: y'all missed out bigtime if you skipped the following advice in my
last post:
| PS: for those of you into the funky jazz-thang, check out Maceo Parker,
| Pee-Wee Ellis, Fred Wesley (aka, the James Brown horn section, the
| Parliament/Funkadelic horn section, aka, the Horny Horns, aka, THE BOMB!)
| Tues 8/11, 8PM, Great American Music Hall, SF. Tix are still available
| as of today...

The show opened with Maceo announcing that this show would be 98% funk, 2%
jazz -- he told no lies...

They had the FUNK turned up full blast, with -- amazing concept these days
-- all live virtuoso instrumentalists! You know all those funky drum
breaks, horn lines, bass riffs and such that have been lifted/sampled/mixed
into modern hip-hop/house/deep-house/etc -- well this band is pretty much
*the* *source* for a lot of that material and it was pure LIVE PERFECTION
that caused the booty to swang, the heart to skip-n-jump, and the
tears-o-joy to well.

They played all their funkiest James Brown tunes, a couple of Horny Horns
tunes, a couple of Fred Wesley tunes, an excellent rendition of Marvin
Gaye's "Let's Get It On", etc. etc.

Basically, the best live show I've seen in a few years... amazing crowd
dancing energy too!

If you caught Maceo's "roots revisited" show at Slim's last year, this one
basically blew the roof offa dat muthasucka. (Pretty easy to do since
Slim's is such a worthless venue what with all their
attitude-laden-shit-fer-brains-employees.)

Subject: RE: It's a white thing.

I especially like your quote, ``free your ass and you mind
will follow''. It has such a multiplicity of meanings ... 

Besides my agreeing with Geoff (of course, including the part
about wailing divas), I have a theory or two of my own
regarding your question.  Perhaps there are concrete reasons
why raves as we know them are not as mixed race as the
population in the area.  What matters is whether those reasons
are reasons of basic discrimination or are simply matters
which will go away with time.  I think it's a lot of the
latter, if my theories are correct.  They are that most ethnic
non-white people have had a good base of music that cutting
edge (e.g. younger) people could appreciate, but that most
vanilla (er, white) people do not have; there is a plethora of
"top 40" radio stations which basically didn't hack it and
sustained a certain level of crapola, until something came
along which replaced it like a flood. The next reason is
economics; ecstasy costs a lot, and not everyone can afford to
give it out for free.  Other reasons I'm sure are much more
complicated, aren't very pretty, and probably wouldn't even
help to know about them (or would it), since it's like walking
backwards through a network of bridges without protective
sidings. (I guess one could stand still for long enough to
catch a little glimpse to see how much progress has been
made.) I too have been seeing a larger and larger number of
colored people showing up to raves (besides the narcs!); I'm
especially happy to see some DJing, organizing raves and all. 

I don't know.  What is England's racistometer?  If it's high,
that might imply some of the reasons this scene started out
askew this way. Anyone around when the first couple of raves
hit the area, who saw the way it was promoted, and perhaps why
interesting-colored people were left out of it? 

Certainly we know the roots of rave music, as with most, came
from very non-white places.  Like, Africa.  Also, I've heard
the rave scene someplace in Spain (geeze, can I be a bit >less<
specific?) was or is going really well.

I'm also into hiphop, and used to go to similar jams in NYC.  Every friday

that would rent out a church or a high school and throw down...

Yes and no.  There are some clubs that book hip-hop DJs, and one or two
will even have live rappers, but there seem to be fewer and fewer.  I know
that a lot of clubs avoid hiphop due to fear of gang violence - I hope the
'increase the peace' gang truce helps this.
As far as the rave scene goes, I think its whiteness is a by-product of its
affluent-ness. Patrons of raves tend to be in (or be children of) middle to
high income brackets.  I've seen more diversity at the park raves than the
$25 GoonTown events.

I think that hiphop's more about power and confrontation, and techno is
more about hypnosis and trance.  I think that they'll continue to influence
each other, as we hear more and more funky beats layered in with 4/4 techno
trax.

Check out The Top on lower haight - on Thursdays (I think?) they spin
hiphop and raggamuffin and sometimes have live rappers.
SugarShack on lower haight has had some open mike rap nights; I don't know
if there's a regular schedule for it.
Mission Rock on Sunday nights has phunky hiphop DJs.
I've also heard about some place in Portrero called The Jungle, but I
haven't checked it out.
If you like old-school rap, 70s funk & electro, try Nightbreak (upper
haight) on friday nights for "Groove Thing".

That's a little exageration unless were talking about 1,000 mic
hits (in which case it's true).  But, if you don't believe that
there is a cut off point at which intensity does not build, go
look it up for your self.  One good source is called Psychedelic
Drugs Reconsidered by Lester Grinspoon and James B. Bakalar.  It's
a compilation of articles, etc. from the Psychedelic Review that
has lots of useful info about botanical sources of psychedelics,
psychedelics in psycotherapy and treatments for alcoholism, street
culture, chemistry, etc.  And it will verify this fact.  Now I'll

First of all, I don't think the rave scene is directly related or 
descended from the NY rap scene, and I don't think it's trying to
be like it (don't get me wrong, I like rap too).

I didn't go to Toon Town, but in general I think that raves have
a diverse population; I do see quite a few blacks, asians, latinos,
etc at raves, and they are also represented on sfraves, as well.
Now they aren't in direct proportion to the population at large, 
there are all kinds of musical and economic and social reasons for
that, that we could discuss if the list wants to.

I'm no expert on the best rap clubs around here, but Nickie's in 
Lower Haight does a good job on Wednesday nights, and the Kennel
Club on Sunday nights does hiphop in addition to some other world
musics.

Status: R


I've been in the Bay Area for a little more than 1 year, and have been
to a couple raves. I would like to get some comments on one troubling
observation.

In New York I used to go to a lot of what were just called 'parties',
(I actually don't remember them beign called anything) but in the CA
sense they would be called raves. These parties were typically put
together for the purpose of exposing some neighborhood rappers.  They
were great. I love rap music, and I especially love being in a club
with people of all races and zero racial tension. (The bathrooms were a
problem, but all you had to do was stay out.)

The rave scene here is so white, and there are no live rappers.

Am I just going to the wrong places? (I hope so. If so fill me in!)

The techno sound is okay, some do it better than others. But the
thought I had at Teen-Town was, out of >1000 I don't see a single black
person.  Coming from NYC I thought this was a statistical
impossiblity.

Then, the total absence of lyrics hit me. I thought, are we escaping
the social issues inherent in rap music?  Most rap is boasting, but of
course a lot of it today is dealing with issues most (white) people
don't want to deal with.

Maybe a better question is who's spinning rap around here? If I get
some responses I can at least seek out the DJ's.

I hope no one takes any offense, I certainly don't intend any.

Well, I certainly saw a handful of black ravers, including Neon Leon whose
records I helped carry in for him to spin.

>Maybe a better question is who's spinning rap around here? If I get

Another DJ friend of mine (Blackstone) is starting up a new club that he's
targeting to be mixed:  racially, orientation, rave/rap, the works.  The club
will be every Wednesday starting August 26 at the Oasis (11th & Folsom).  He's
calling it Nasty Rhythm.  Both he and Neon Leon will be spinning house and DJ
Pause will be spinning rap and maybe some reggae in the other room.  Blackstone
and DJ Pause were tops in the rap scene here a few years ago.  Blackstone does
a lot of work at the DNA Lounge, spinning and booking acts, so look for rap
there.  I saw Arrested Development there a couple months ago.

Sorry this isn't entirely rave related, but thought y'all might want to hear
about it.  I personally think that with the nature of raves here in SF and the
history of the rap scene, the two will be an odd mix at Nasty Rhythm.  But I'll
certainly check it out.

Share and enjoy,

Tim

Subject: Russian River Re Union at ACME Acres, plus flyers flyers flyers!

I stopped by Ameba on Haight today, and found Preston and Mark
divying up tickets for this weekend's Russian River Re Union
at ACME Acres.  (I asked this guy, "who are you?", to which he
responded "Preston."  I had to mention something about how
I've heard all sorts of things about him, all good.) 

I asked him about the viscious rumor of this thing being
cancelled due to Feel-X. 
He said untrue.

Here's the rest of the flyer:

Sunday August 16th
CoProduced by: Stompy, dianna, & Destiny (has "Hygiene" mark)

front of colorful (but not overdone) flyer:

Recording says also:
Saturday: Canoes, Swimming, Camping under Stars
Sunday: Dancing under sun

Tickets:  Ameba on Haight 415.750.9368; City Zone? on Castro 415.558.9429
No glass containers, dogs or alcohol.  Kids welcome.
Be respectful of nature and the residents who live nearby.

They were talking about whether reservations would be needed.
The basic idea is that if you don't buy a ticket, then there is a good
chance the thing will be sold out before it starts.  If you call to
reserve a space then things aren't guarenteed but you'll be put into
a book which has priority over those who just show up.  I wouldn't
be surprised if no one in that book gets in if everything sells out.

I'm thinking about going to this for the whole weekend.
Does anyone want to come along?  Have car, will rave.
I don't have any luxuries in the car, and sometimes even have
trouble feeding it ... but I can get by this time I think.

This is the other flyers section.  I picked these up at a multiplicity
of places, the worst being ToonTown, the best being shops around the
Upper Haight and The Castro.  I'm sure there's duplicates with whatever

about the same time as I type this in ... ah well!)

Sorry if this sounds preachy, but:

Several Ways not to worry about Cops:
1) there's a convenient brain game for people "adulterated" in public, and it
goes "I bet you can't CONVINCE anyone you're on...." If you play this game,
there instantly becomes no need to get worried about getting busted for being
"on"
2) Don't Sell At A Rave
3) The correct answer to "do you know where I can score" is "Sorry."
4) It is IMPORTANT to change public conceptions about rave -- they think it's
"one giant drug party, with some music thrown in". We must convince them that
it's one giant dance party, and hardly anyone takes drugs.

	Well, after waiting the requested two weeks, I have decided to surface.
Is anyone thinking of going to this thing?  It looks interesting and the 
people that put the flyer together seem to be after a different image than
that found on the typical flyer.  It's almost gothic looking and doesn't
seem to imply the neo-60's peace and love consciousness most of the others
shoot for (or seem to at least).  It's this saturday, no idea on the location
and I don't even have a phone number.
	By the way, why is Connection scheduled for a THURSDAY night.  I'm
sure that this point was probably discussed and I just missed it, but I've
got to work on friday and there is no way I can stay up all night.  I'd love
to go, but it's impossible.  Oh well.

my comments on this subject stem from the fact that I personally
have never seen a rave promoter get involved in the policing of
drug sales/consumption at a rave.  maybe I'm wrong--maybe
they're heavily involved.   maybe mr-rave-promoter-joe takes
it as a point of personal pride that no drugs are sold/consumed
at his raves.  I've just never known promoters to be that involved.

if I were a promoter, I'd want to placate the cops and the ticket-
buyers ( druggy and non ).  I'd leave enforcement to the cops.

wow.  well, let me state clearly that it was NOT my intention 
to introduce hostility into this forum, and if anything I posted
did so inadvertently, I apologize both to you and the list.

if you post to < how many people is it now, Brian ? > however 
many people something that can be construed in a controversial
way, then OF COURSE you run the risk of getting volatile 
responses.  you did a fine job with your caveat-ing.  I thought
your comments were well-written and interesting.  that's why 
I bothered to respond.

since I suppose most sfravers dislike cat-fights, I'll take my 
remaining remarks to private mail, with the following exceptions:

I hope you're not suggesting that lesbians who wear   
lipstick are hypocritical in some fashion < !? >.
I suspect the limitations of this medium have caused
me to misinterpret your comment.

> So, no, that bearded guy with a pink triangle button isn't necessarily queer,

wait, are you so sure he's not a she ?  

> You had absolutely no grounds to draw this conclusion.
> Queer preaching, the blight of the 90's.

what was my conclusion again ?  

call me naive, but I resist categorizing people according to 
their appearance.  and I've been around enough actors to know
it's dangerous to categorize people because of their behavior.

well, that's my opinion.  so I guess we agree.
I'm sorry if the argument got in the way.

	So that we didn't compete with the other raves going on during the
weekend, so that we were sure we attracted a good crowd and not just those
out cruising for a "paaarty, duuude", because it was much easier to get 
Carlos and Spun that way....

	  You know I hate to say it, but these cops..although obviously we have
	serious distaste and reservations about what they are doing...are\
	only doing their job...


	I mean, what do you expect...Raves (and any pay-for event..) are public spaces...
	and people openly selling drugs to people they dont know are only
	asking for trouble...I'm just surprised that there has been so little
	scrutiny of the rave scene..honestly...

	  If people want to take the risk of trying to expose these people..
	(and I am sure that there is a risk of pointing out the wrong people..)
	they should be a lot more than 90% sure that what they are saying is true..
	I mean.. they could be inciting mob action that could result in people
	getting hurt...
	  And bringing a lot of undeserved scrutiny to the rave-list, I might add.

	  I mean, it is a drag seeing Joe the Ecstasy Dealer getting hauled away..
	but lets face it, these people go to events figuring that risk into
	their lives...that's why they charge so much for the damn stuff..

	(too much, in my opinion..to warrant buying it anymore..)

	So maybye we should all get off our damn soapboxes and just realize that we
	live in America/Amerika... All that energy would be far better expended
	trying to change the drug laws....in my opinion...

	  Just my 0.000002 cents worth...

	-chris.

Chris,
	The problem is that these guys are not just going after Joe the Ecstasy
dealer.  For instance these two women approached someone on the scene
who owns a small business, much like yourself asking for drugs, standing
close listening to conversations and generaly being intrusive.  I have had the
police come to my door at 4 am accusing me  (very falsely, I might add) of
being a Crack or coke or some such drug dealer because they got an 
"annonymous" report.  This can be a very frightening and stressful experience
since in this country these days an accusation seems to be enough for
the Archons (the powers that be) to confiscate all you worldly belongings and
basicly ruin your life.  As I said to the San Jose Cop at Creation, if you
guys want to do your job, I can tell you about two or three rock houses in
my immediate area that seem to opperate with impunity (or protection :).

	I'm not so much concerned with Joe or Jane the Ecstasy dealer.
They know (or should know) the risks involved,  I'm concerned with the kid
who doses for the first time and happend to have 5 hits on his person 
when one of these bitches  come up to him with a look of love and peace and
asks him does he have any A.  He having a wonderful trip since this is his  
eighteenth birthday celebration and here's the beautiful, sexy and exotic
women smiling at him and asking him if he has any acid.  He has a thought
through the acid haze that I don't know this woman maybe I should be careful
but everyone else at this rave party thing has been so nice and friendly
and friends share with friends, besides her body's booming and so are his
hormones.  So he reaches in his pouch and tears off a hit and give it to her.
"How much do I ow you?" she says. "Nothing." he replies, "I love you."
She smiles and walks away only to be replaced 4 minutes later by 2 burly
boys on blue who are asking him to empty his pockets...

	Yes I agree that we should work to get the drug laws changed.  But 
their something wrong in a country where an auto executative can get caught
buying 24 kilos of cocain and get off scot free and a friend of mine did
time in the maximum security federal pen for having a vial.

	You know sodomy is against the law in many states, I don't know about
California but in Massachusetts, it's a felony.  Now  do I say to my gay
friends who might get caught in the act of lovemaking in a state park or
something "well you know the risk!". Yes I'm sure they know the risk of being
Gay in a straight world just like I know the risks of being black in a white
world (sic).  But the bottom line is if it's a straight couple who is caught
the rangers can have a laugh and there is very little that can be done to them
(maybe indescent exposure) but the Gay couple, eventhough I must admit it is
unlikely, can be sent to federal prison,  (I guess they feel this is an
appropriate place to asist  them in rehabilitation :).  Anyway you get the idea, yes change the laws but we neeed to protect the people in our "family"
from unfair persecution.  If we can't do this then this scene isn't worth
shit, If we just talk about ComeUnity and Connection and do nothing to
actualize it.

I'm off my soapbox for today.

Subject: Re: What to Do?

Almost every media note about rave sounds like thisL
"Rave, the drug-oriented party phenomenon, ...."

I don't see Rave as a drug-oriented anything. There
have been plenty of parties I've been to that are just
like raves. No drugs there. Plenty  of drug parties with
no dancing.

Rave, to me, is a "gathering" in the 60's interpetation,
where people get together, dance, have fun, be nice to
each other. Quite a difference from the 80's "singles bar".

If we actively push on the media, they will change the perception
of Rave that they are feeding to the masses. Less public perception
of Rave as "just an excuse to take drugs" means less police hassles.

sorry if this is too soapbox for anyone's taste. I love Rave, love
dancing, don't do drugs.

Subject: FMR, phone numbers


Hi all,

The full moon rave was subpar although still good; the sound system wasn't
working very well until 3 or 3:30 (the subwoofers weren't working).  As
a result the energy wasn't as high, and it seemed more people left early.
Still, the people were good, as always.  The location was the same as
before but they moved the DJs and speakers to the level part of the 
ground.  Still too dusty (cough cough) and the moon was obscured by
the clouds most of the time.  Oh well.

I typed in phone numbers for all the raves that I still have the calendars
for; I don't know if this is of ANY use whatsoever, but maybe it'll be
good to have around if you forget to print the list [and you just can't
remember the Toon Town number :) ]  or if you get a new flyer and you
want to figure out if it's being promoted by the Feel-X people :).
Also shows the number of different raves over the past few months...
Please tell me if this is worth keeping up to date...

Subject: John Cage (kinda long)

A bit of bad news...

Composer, philosopher, and musical prophet John Cage died yesterday of a
stroke. He was 79.

Cage's work is of particular importance to the world of sampled music, as
he was one of the earliest proponents of the idea that all sounds, as well
as the spaces between them, are musical. Cage was also a pioneer in the use
of chance processes as a means of musical composition.

Both his books and recordings are worth checking out, though many will find
the writings more accessible than the music.

A full obituary appears below.

Subject: Avant-garde composer John Cage dies at 79



	NEW YORK (UPI) -- John Cage, one of the most controversial, colorful,
and adventurous composers and theorists in American music, died
Wednesday of a stroke in a Manhattan hospital. He was 79.
	A spokeswoman for the Merce Cunningham Dance Foundation, where Cage
was musical advisor, said the prolific composer and writer suffered a 
``severe stroke'' and died Wednesday afternoon at St. Vincent's
Hospital-Medical Center.
	His manager for the last 20 years, Mimi Johnson, said Cage suffered
the stroke Tuesday evening after a full day of work.
	``It was very unexpected,'' she said.
	By the late 1930s, Cage established himself as a leader of the
classical music world's avant-garde movement, a position he solidified
over the next five decades, expanding the influence of his ideas into
art and dance.
	His early ``prepared piano'' recitals -- where woodscrews, pieces of
metal, rubber bands and strips of paper were placed inside the piano to
produce exotic sounds -- drew high praise and bitter denunciations.
	The first prepared piano work, ``Bacchanale,'' premiered in 1938.
	His fascination with rhythms and percussion intruments greatly
influenced his early work, as did the music of Asia, especially India.
He later moved on to ``aleatory,'' or random, compositions, where a note
may be replaced by a dropped coin or the toss of a dice.
	Such compositions culminated in a series of projects for Black
Mountain College summer workshops in the 1950s.
	His 1954 work, ``4'33'',`` featured a pianist who sat at the keyboard
for the designated time but did not play a note. Eight years later, Cage
debutted ''0'00``, a silent piece in which anyone could perform
anything.
	In a 1946 interview, Cage said the elimination of harmony was his
principle contribution to musical composition.
	What others described as noise, as well as silence, were the key
ingredients of Cage's music. Because he so committed himself to breaking
with music's past, critics found that his compositions often defied
classification.
	Cage rarely used conventional forms, such as a quartet or concerto.
	In an association that spanned a half-century, Cage wrote several
ballet scores for pieces choreographed by Cunningham, beginning with the
1942 ``Credo in Us.''
	In May 1947, Cage's first piece for a large orchestra, written for
Cunnginham's ``The Season,'' lasted 18 minutes in its premiere by the
Ballet Society in New York City.
	The two expressed a number of radical innovations in musical and
choreographic composition, such as the use of chance operations and the
independence of dance and music.
	Born in Los Angeles, Calif., on Sept. 5, 1912, studied piano in his
hometown and Paris before coming under the influence of musical
experimenters Richard Buhlig, Henry Cowell, Adolph Weiss and Arnold
Schoenberg.
	Before dedicating himself to performing and composing, Cage taught at
the Cornish School in Seattle, Wash., Mills College, in Oakland, Calif.,
the School of Design, Chicago, and the New School for Social Research in
Manhattan.
	He wrote several books, including ``Silence'' (1961), and ``A Year
from Monday'' (1968), ``Notations'' (1969), ``M'' (1973), ``Empty Words''
(1979), and ``X'' (1983).
	Cage was the recipient of many awards and honors, beginning in 1949
with a Guggenheim Fellowship and an Award from the National Academy of
Arts and Letters for having extended the boundaries of music through his
work with percussion orchestra and his invention in 1940 of the prepared
piano.
	He was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and
Letters in 1968, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978,
and was inducted into the 50-member American Academy of Arts and Letters
in May 1989.
	France bestowed its highest honor in 1982, naming him Commander of
the Order of Arts and Letters.
	Cage also was the Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard
University for the 1988-89 academic year.
	Working on various projects at the time of his death, Johnson, his
manager, said he was finishing a piece entitled, ``58,'' for Austrian
radio.
	Cage was in the midst of a series of compositions named after the
number of musicians used in the work.
	The American Symphony Orchestra has scheduled the premiere of his
orchestral work ``74,'' for Nov. 8 at Carnegie Hall.
	Other recent commission include 1987's ``Europeras 1&2,'' by the
Frankfurt, Germany, Opera, which Cage wrote, designed, staged and
directed; 1989's ``101,'' by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Fromm
Foundation at Harvard University; and ``Europeras 3&4,'' by the Almeida
Music Festival and Modus Vivendi Foundation.
	Many international events have been planned in celebration of his
80th birthday, including Northwestern University's John Cage Now, held
in Chicago in March, and a month-long festival in Frankfurt this month
and next.
	Cage's only marriage ended in divorce in the 1940s. There were no
immediate survivors.

They're in no way hypocritical.  They just like the way they look with

effeminate to ultramacho.  In the same way, straight men range from being
very effeminate to ultramacho.  Etc.

Very much so.  People are infinitely surprising and unknowable.  Just as

Depends on how far back ya wanna go.  Since current theory seems
to indicate we all came from Africa your exactly right but more
recently, House came from Chicago and was a "black scene", and
Techno came from Detroit from a "white scene", although we all
know there were probably people of many races involved in both

Subject: Re:  hip-hop wanderings

My thoughts on the matter of rap lyrics and raves...

I agree with the comment made earlier that lyrics tend to distract from
the hypnotic quality of the music - that what was once a private, self
guided trip suddenly has a form and direction is so precise as be jarring.
Any lyrics that are more repetitive mantras than words are good, as they
add to the music rather than try and capture your concentration away from
the beat. Lyrics where the vocal qualities of the singer are the most
significant element are perfect, which is why I'm looking forward to more
4AD groups being sampled in the future.

So how can I reconcile that with the fact that I *love* the rap in "What
Time Is Love"?  Maybe because it's fairly lighthearted, because it's not
demanding too much from me the way a Consolidated or a Disposible Heroes
of HipHoprisy song might.  

Much of hip-hop is, from my perspective, a lot more agressive than your 
standard techno or house song.  I mean, more _anger_ is present; even a
blisteringly hardcore fast song like "Digeridoo" or "Close Your Eyes" 
doesn't convey the same sort of anger that a "hardcore" rap song might.
I like it sometimes, I really do appreciate the likes of Public Enemy 
and some Consolidated and Disposible Heroes and some Ice T... but the
atmosphere they convey is simply at right angles with the atmosphere in
house and techno.  This is sorta why raves that advertise with such anemic
anthems as "ONLY FOR THE HARDCORE", etc., really don't impress me at all.

So are techno music and raves a "white thang"?  I would say no, but I can't
account for the observation that was made that blacks aren't seen in as
large numbers at a typical rave as they are in the population.  I would say
the other minorities are there in appropriate levels, but why blacks 
choose not to go to raves is... something I can't explain.  Which is
terribly ironic, since house music was born from black music roots.

But, one counter-observation:  at the SFR lunch last week I was absolutely
floored when I looked at the cultural and racial diversity at our table. 
And here we were, talking our heads off, and treating each other like humans,
as if we had known each other for years. Yow. Did someone dose the tea? 8^)

As I understand it, the originators of Detroit techno are Kevin

black.  So it's not accurate to say that it was a "white scene",
unless you're talking about some of their influences (Kraftwerk, etc.)

Subject: Some bad news, and a plea for help...


No easy way to say it: Spun cancelled.  He DJ's at club FX on Thursday nights,
and while he usually only DJs for two or three hours, that night he'll be
doing it for 5 since the other DJ is taking a vacation. So, Spun said he
wouldn't have the energy to make it, despite Carlos's and my pleadings. 

:(

Well, it's not THAT bad, we still have 6 good DJ's, of which 3 are known,
great quantities, and 1 of which could carry the night by himself if he
had to (Carlos).  So, it's not like we'll be hurting for great music.  Not
at all.  It means we'll also be able to let the other DJ's have more time
now, which is a good thing.  The only really bad part about Spun cancelling
is the fact that he's on the fliers.  I'll take his name off the phone
messages when I rerecord them tomorrow.  I've given out about all the
flyers I feel we need to (people at the FMR were constantly saying, "Oh yes,
I heard about this..."), so I don't know if we need to make a big deal about
making new ones up and getting them out.  What does everyone think we should
do about this?  Hmm... I got it!  Play a tape of Spun's mixing in the buses.
Yeah....


Okay, to move forward --->

	We need pickup trucks.  At least one, much more likely two, and 
starting from Berkeley or SF if possible.  We need them for the bonfire
wood and for the tables. (Speaking of which: any more tables out there?)
So if _any_ of you have a truck out there with a bed in back that you
could offer, that would be great.  Even if you couldn't make it to the event
because you have to work on Friday,  you can still help, because the
hauling would take place Thursday afternoon...

	Also, anyone close to Sacramento thinking about going to this? 
DJ Drew needs a ride, and he has 10 people who are also willing to go (none
of them has a car, though).  They're more than willing to pay for gas, etc.,
and if you only want to drive to the city and take the floppy bus down,
they're planning on doing that, too.  Help!! :)

	Finally, we have one person on the list who's offered a ham radio for
communication use, and we need another one. If anyone can help with this,
you will be richly rewarded. 

	G'night!

One of the reasons that I like the music of the scene (the range
from techno - wailing diva) is that quite a few different cultures
have contributed to the sound.

I think it con safly say that their would most likely not be Techno without
"Electric Boogie" which was a break beat style that was the precursor
to Detroit Techno (can you say break dance!). But there would not have been
any electric boogie if Afrika Bambatta had not made Planet Rock and there would
most definately not have been a Planet Rock without KRAFTWERk whom
Africa Bambatta ALWAYS acknowledges as being one of the   prime influences.

I was kistening to Kraftwerk in the late seventies when it seem to be exclusively "acid hacker music".  I remember going home to baltimore a couple
of years later and hearing Kraftwerk on the "Black" stations!  I remember
being totally amazed and spent a considerable amounr of mental energy
trying to analyze how this crossover occured,  I mean if you've ever seen
Kraftwerk in the flesh not to mention their album covers the are literally
"from the heart of Whiteness" how did this music wind up being played on one
of the radio stations that James Brown owns?  

My theory is that Black GIs were exposed to Kraftwerk while on duty 
in germany.  But it may have totally been the work of Afrika Bambatta.

Has anything like this been attempted in San Francisco?  I mean, what is the
most clandestine thing that you've attended out there?  I'd imagine in a
situation like this, the amount of time in the location would be equal to the
amount of time it takes for the police to arrive.

Not very profitable, but at about $100 a shot, it would be a hell of a lot of

Mission Rock is a mile or so further south on 3rd St beyond the "Lefty

Title: EXILE & EXHILERATION

"A Video Meme From Genesis P-Orridge"

All material Copyright TRANSMEDIA FOUNDATION & G.P-ORRIDGE 1992.

On Saturday 15th February 1992 a Morality Swat Squad from Old Species Yard
initiated a Transmedia Soap Opera that explores thee myths and neuroses ov
Left Brain Society. Deftly woven fabrications silhouetted thee fears
Fundamentalism breeds to succour its peoples. Textperts dogmatised and
stigmatised thee innocent in preparation for a media "Burning Time". In
thee perfection ov postexistentialist politics this hysterical
orchestration ov NOTHING, uncovered NOTHING, with a content ov NOTHING,
achieving absolutely NOTHING. Nothing that was, except a seizure ov
counter-cultural meme cortex, namely thee 23 yeras ov video, film and
Performance Art archives curated by Genesis P-Orridge since thee 1960's.
Irreplaceable and unique visual pieces by Antony Balch, Derek Jarman, John
Maybury, Cerith Wyn Evans, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Akiko Hada,
Hyperdelic Video and ov course Psychic Television were spirited away
without a receipt ov confiscation, nor has a list ov materials removed ever
been supplied. Justification all ways generates condemnation. This act ov
officially condoned vandalism was validated as a "satanic" amusemeant
arcade originally, coumplete with mentally ill and financially rewarded
"freaks". This was quickly dismissed by The Independent and Mail On Sunday
as thee rectal tissue ov lies and abomination it truly was only to be
perpetuated by a secondary episode, employing even less talented actors and
actresses, concerned with a permanent scarring ov thee status quo initiated
by an anonymous gay performance art documentation ov 11 yeras age
(presumably thus a minor). To this day this forcible possession ov an
historical art archive stands as a Last Will and Testameant ov a
conservative whiplash debased in fiction and fueled by irony. To attempt to
silence, discredit, and destroy artists by confiscation and isolation is a
sickly reminiscence ov thee most violent, totalitarian and hypocritical
Storical eras. To corruptly utilise artist's children as a callous weapon
is thee product ov a degraded and ignorant system.

This video was presented at thee ZAP CLUB, Brighton, England as part ov
"PHARMAKON - a Symposium on thee Story, Evolution and Oppression ov
Psychedelic Drugs on 16th May 1992. Due to thee above situation, Genesis
P-Orridge was represented by a TV Monitor and thee digital messages now

Yes. This needs to be taught to every child along with the pledge of
allegiance. OOps I mean INSTEAD of it.

Yes, visually Kraftwerk are most definitely White, Euro, antiseptic,
perhaps uptight as well, and all those other qualities conventionally
opposed to Black, funk-ay, loose...

 -  Now, this is not the time or place to discuss the validity of those
categories. (BTW I don't mean to imply that Geoff White himself
subscribes to those.) - 

BUT - 

*aurally* Kraftwerk are not ESPECIALLY close to White European
popular, traditional, folk or art music, i.e. basically anything from
Beethoven to Elvis or Pat Boone or old English ballads. In terms of
what the instruments are doing, the notes and especially the rhythms
being played, I think Kraftwerk have much in common with Black
American music, soul, funk, James Brown, you name it. They must have
listened to loads of that, don't you think? It must have been popular
in Europe, after all, Europe has always been strongly supportive of
American jazz musicians, especially Black ones.

Kraftwerk's great achievement has been to take some of the absolute
minimal essentials from Black styles and combine them with the whole
'scientific', 'technological' Teutontic vorsprung-durch-teknik thing.

And that's what Afrika Bambataa and all of Kraftwerk's Black audience
probably picked up on. End of ethnomusicology lesson.

That is a great idea and I hope someone, somewhere will look into it.

Doesn't work as well as you'd suspect it would.   Your sheets need to be HUGE
at just a short distance.  We attempted to tie some sheets to a tree to
project on at the last one, and failed miserably.  The image was about four
times as large as our "white patch".  So we just shot off a metal building.
It looked fine.  I'd imagine that if the cliffs are tan or light colored, it
will work just as well.

As a matter of fact, in one of the artsy fartsy magazines I was reading
recently, they were doing this cross country thing of a wedding between the
statue of Liberty and the Christopher Columbus statue in Spain.  They did one
night next to some cliffs in Nevada and projected pictures of the statues
against them.  It looked rather dramatic.

Subject: re: hip-hop wanderings, and other stuff

Hey, people are nice inside and at heart (there's just so many things
trying to tear those apart though -- it's a wild world both good and bad).

Just a second, I can't hold back -- everybody, I'm having a wonderful day
today; I just thought I'd say that.  I'm happy, and want to make someone
else feel happy too!  I love it ...

About lyrics.  Hey, I wish I could get my hands on some serious lyrics.
I know I would really appreciate them, play them, think about them,
blast them, sooth in them (really! on my bad days), and all, but I agree
they are not the same material I would want to hear at a rave.

I agree with Brian's comments when looked at the angle of what music to
choose for a rave.

[I may be repeating the following, sorry, I haven't been keeping up
with the list because of the poor mail handling software at my disposal]

There were a few great articles in Odyssey Magazine, a neat little gay
rag coming out every two weeks written up by a few younger fags that
like to put together a neat advertisement package with some local interesting
chitchat inbetween; it's a collection in many households I've visited
(including my own of course !)  I love the way they write; you know you 
have to take everything with a grain of something (salt maybe), so you
can let loose and expect anything to come out at you.  And it does.
Well, they like to put themes into stuff.  They had a scathing ditty about
Rave culture by one guy who must have been around it for a long time and
was really tired with life, since he blasted it to hell (a few months
ago, I forget when/what/where/whatever).  But this time, hey, it's the
theme item, inasmuch it's got the front page covered with a neat design of
some rave someplace (with ravers that you'd find at many a rave).

Here are some of the articles.  Pick up a copy of this magazine if you
have a chance; but I know a lot of you aren't really in the area or
otherwise frequent this thing, so I know excerpting this without permission
probably won't hurt much ratioed with helping.

russian ravers

  On August 1, about 2,000 ravers headed north from the city to Feel-X
(as in the cat), a rave at the Russian River.  Despite having all the
necessary permits for the occasion, Sonoma County Sheriff deputies
infiltrated the rave searching for alcohol and/or drugs.

[.... my wheels wind to a screaching halt, as I reconsider my approach]

Sorry, but I just decided that if you haven't already got the thing,
this is a neat artwork in itself, so go out and get yourself.

It's called Odyssey Magazine, available in most gay venues, esp. in
the Castro area.  Most people you ask around there (who are under the
psychological hill) will be able to tell you where to pick one up.

Hi again all.

OK, so were watching Channel 7 news just a few minutes ago, and
they actually ran a spot about the Russian River rave this weekend,
saying it was cancelled by the Sonoma County Sherriff.  I called
Ameba: not so, says the woman who answered;
they went to court today and got an injunction allowing the
rave to go on!  They plan to try to get a retraction story later
on tonite.  Wow, raves are on the news!  Too bad this might
keep a few people away.  Not me, I'm all over this one.  Hope
to see you all there, but maybe keep calling Ameba for updates.

One good thing: they associated only Smart Drinks with raves, and
didn't even mention drugs!?!  Is this possible?

Other rumor mills have it that Warp Factor X will be in the Potrero
Hill district in a huge space, and now don't jump on me for this
next one, 'cause it *is* a rumor, but the figure 95,000 watts of
sound has been bounced around.  Damn.  Considering Juice/Destination
are the same thing and are at the DV8 (been there, done that), that
is where I am heading.

In San Francisco they've taken it a step further.  Some friends of mine have
gone to these "outlaw" parties, where instead of finding some isolated outdoor
spot, they pick a deserted, but highly public spot (like a subway station
after rush hour with an electrical outlet).  The two I've heard about have
been a group of 200 people assembling near the target location and then
descending en masse with a portable sound system and a tape player.  They then
party like mad until the cops kick them out.  Wish I was able to make it to one
of them.  The last one I heard about was 6 months ago.

They're organized (and I use that term loosely) with more of a Queer Nation
feel ("we're here, we're queer, and we're not going back") than a rave feel,
but same idea.

Share and enjoy and don't get caught,

Be *very* cautious of what the promoters want to spread around as far as
sound system size is concerned (and don't let it be the judge of how good
the sound system is anyways). One, oftentimes sound guys (the Shredder in this
case) will simply add up all the peak wattage ratings of their speakers
without a concern for the actual wattage being used, which is obviously
going to be much lower if you don't want to damage the speakers.  Second, they
might have a lot of power, but if you're running that on a wire-and-tin-
can speaker setup, it'll sound horrid.

Let Freedom Rave had an honest, clean 29,000 watts going through 12 subwoofers
and many mids and highs.  And I certainly didn't think it wasn't loud enough.

Be *very* cautious of what the promoters want to spread around as far as
sound system size is concerned (and don't let it be the judge of how good
the sound system is anyways). One, oftentimes sound guys (the Shredder in this
case) will simply add up all the peak wattage ratings of their speakers
without a concern for the actual wattage being used, which is obviously
going to be much lower if you don't want to damage the speakers.  Second, they
might have a lot of power, but if you're running that on a wire-and-tin-
can speaker setup, it'll sound horrid.

Let Freedom Rave had an honest, clean 29,000 watts going through 12 subwoofers
and many mids and highs.  And I certainly didn't think it wasn't loud enough.

Following up on my last message -- I just talked to one of
the organizers, and as far as they're concerned, it's still on.
It starts at 10am Saturday with a river clean-up; the first
40 people who show up get a free canoe trip.  Then from 4pm to
10pm they'll have a "small" sound system going with DJ's Tony
and Bones, plus volunteers (?).  At 7pm, they're planning
a kiddie festival (fun for all ages, I guess).

The music shuts down at 10pm until 8am Sunday -- there will
be a pancake breakfast at 7am.  Starting at 8am, you can
dance to DJ's Harry Who, Dani, Jeno, Thomas, Marky Mark, and
Nikki Rivera, probably in that order.

Only a limited number of tents will be allowed, although they'll
try to cram as many of you campers as they can.

If you go, say hi to everyone for me  ;^)

geez.  don't get me started.  start with a mall.  I recommmend serramonte.
I know it well.  move in, set up, plug in, get chased out.  next move,
maybe the zoo.  they've gotta have power outlets there.  so pay to get in,
set everything up, make fun of the snakes, et cet.  get kicked out.  next,
on to this place where I used to sorta hang on twin peaks.  I've got keys.
it's easy to get inside.  set up, get busted after, say thirty minutes,
split.  next stop, an s.f. roof top.  oh so beatle-esque.  come on, we've 
access to enough.  it should be a roof we can get to without implicating any  
tenants.  I can recommend a few.  the question is, of course, getting any 
equipment to the roof.  that would have to be dealt with once we had 
determined which roof.  I'm sure we can manage the rope.  next, well, how 
'bout under the gg bridge ?  is there power there ?  I'm not sure.  what
about the parking lot at the s.f. airport.  or inside the damn airport.
we could have the cops chasing us all OVER the place.  and I haven't even
mentioned my favorite berkeley places.  like soda's home.  or the roof
of my building ( mary poppins was filmed there ).  or right here right
now.  it'd be great till campus security moved in.  hh, any suggestions
for campus melee ?  whatever happened to those elaborate eshelman plans ?
graveyards.  mausoleums.  ouija.  come on, you guys at stanford must have
access to some cool places.  then there's mount diablo.  lincoln park.  
plus, if I play my cards right, I could probably talk a couple of my
favorite lawyers ( public defenders and district attys ) to tag
along.  there's nothing more satisfying ( well ... ) than when
the cops pull you over and the person sitting next to you has,
hey, a BIGGER BADGE !!  it always PAYS to have the law on your side.

we should make it into a complete 24 hour experience, with each
place estimated at about 30 minutes, travel/set-up time est. at
oh, an hour or slightly more, a very definite schedule/map set up
with perhaps occasional breaks built in to throw off any unwanted
followers.  hey, indulge me COMPLETELY and let me ENCRYPT the
instructions !! 

what the hell, can we incorporate a trip to reno ?
you know, work in the craps/random-is-divine element ?


in case you can't tell, I'm quite enthusiastic about the possibilities
of an electronically-organized-scavenge-the-rave-oid-odyssey-hunt.  I think
it could be great, with proper planning.  and extremely clandestine.
that adds to the fun, right ?  or have I been reading too much nancy drew ?

well, I'm pretty sure not all sfravers are queer, but I'd imagine
most could identify with "we're here, and we're not going back."

the ODYSSEY.  that should be the name of the next sfraves

The rumor mill has found out new anti-rumors.  Even if 95K watts of
sound was planned, the fire marshal pulled the permit for warp factor
just a short time ago.  They scrambled for a space, and came up with,
well, sorry to say, Townsend.

What a let-down.  It was gonna be in a huge, raw, dirty warehouse with
crap everywhere; now it's busted to Townsend.  Dragola.

Oh well, such it is with the rumor mill, hope this caught you all in

been busted BEFORE they started.  The scene it is a-changin, and we all

I just heard from Mark (ReUnion / Ameba), and the bottom line is that
Channels 5 and 7 got the story *totally* wrong.  The Sonoma Co. Board of Supes
did try to squelch the event, but Mark went to court yesterday and the
judge ruled that there was no legal way to stop it, provided they
adhere to the campground rules -- primarily, observing quiet hours at
night, and limiting the numbers to 350 overnight, and 600 by day.

So the media completely blew it in their haste for the sensational
story, and Mark figures with all the rumors flying around they
probably won't make capacity.  It's a pity that these guys, who
completely have their act together, have to suffer because of bozos
like the Feel-X organizers, uptight provincial politicians, and
overzealous news producers.

If I can convince anyone to join me, I think I'll probably drive up
there in the morning after Wacky Citrus.  Any takers?

Okay, everyone out there who wants a ticket and can't make it to Ameba,
GET IN TOUCH WITH ME IMMEDIATELY, and let me know how many to reserve. On
Tuesday night (the LAST DATE for advance registrations through me) I'll go
to Ameba and tell Mark, "I need to take back xx number of tix", and then
give those to Howard, who'll be running the SF bus departure site. I'll
put your names on a list (for example, hortonee + 2 guests), and then when
you go to the bus departure site, you'll give Howard $15 per ticket before 
you get on, and he'll give you your reserved ticket.  That works?  Also,
since there was interest in having the bus stop in Mountain View: if
ten people write me and say it would be more convenient for them to be picked
up in MTV, we'll have the 11pm bus stop there BRIEFLY.  Parking at the bus
departure site will be no problem; right now Howard and I are thinking 4th
and Townsend, where there's free 24hr parking (parking that doesn't magically
become 1-hour parking at 6am).

Hey, these rave things.  If they're "busting them before they're happening",
then I have a feeling too many promoters are trying to follow the letter
of the law and get the police involved as a precautionary measure.  Perhaps
there will be a fork:  the big money people who can sit around playing
politics to get a real permit for 6 months, and the people who just sink
underground.  We'll see flyers for the former, and hardly even hear of
the latter unless we really know who is who where ... or just the former.
I'm already talking nonsense, because I'm realizing this is all just sort
of silly prophesizing.

A quick glance at this weekend's calendar shows 5 raves for friday night.
In addition, a little cross checking on the DJ lists shows...

DJ			Raves
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Simon			Anythyst	Cool World	Juicy Fruit
Carlos			Anythyst	Cool World	Messiah
Spun			Anythyst 	Messiah
Scott Hardkiss		Anythyst 
Robbie Hardkiss		Messiah
? Hardkiss		Cool World


Note that Carlos is doing 3 raves the night after he does ours.

Note also that at least one of these raves (Messiah) is in the
south bay and one (Juicy Fruit) is probably in Sacramento.

Possibilities:

1. Somebody is lying about what DJ's they're having.
2. Two or more of these raves are, in fact, the same rave.
3. We have some really hard-working DJ's around here.

Yowza -- i completely forgot about the existence of nature's trip toy. The
sparkly sand at our no-cal beaches is one of my fond memories of kawlich
nighttime beach trips.

It's not magic -- these chemo-luminescent creatures really exist -- i
vaguely recall that they're diatoms. These are a kind of plankton --
basically unicellular or colonial algae with silicified skeletons. The
skeletons are often used in "diatomic filters" for aquariums.

And I think this is around the time of year when the little luminescent
buggers start showing up.

Just run along in the wet sand kicking up as much sand as possible and
you'll see flashes of light. If there's alot of them in the water, and
there's a good forceful set of waves churning things up, the waves
themselves will glow.

Speaking of chemically luminescent creatures, did you know that there
exists a semi-rare fungus that emits light? When I was a kid, my aunt (a
mycology prof. at the university of tubingen in germany) gave me a petri
dish that glowed in the dark -- it was full of these luminescent shrooms.

These fungii would form what are called "witches circles" in central
european cow pastures and forests. People would think these glowing circles
of fungus were locations where witches held their ceremonies. In fact, what
is happening is that the fungus grows outward in a circle, emitting light
at the edges where new nutrtients are discovered and dieing at the center.

If you do time lapse-photography of these witches circles, it looks very
much like an analog to the computerized "game of life" .

what this has to do with raves, i don't know....

Subject: Connection: what everyone's bringin (and what we need more of)


	Okay, what follows is the sum total of all the commitments people
have made - some stronger than others, but hopefully everyone will come 
through. If your name is on here for something you know you won't be able 
to bring, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. Let me first go over what we don't have and
really, really need.

1.  Monitor speakers for the DJ - I have a set of home stereo speakers and
	a Teac 100W amp I might be able to have a friend bring up from LA
	for it, but we really need a better speaker and amp.

2.  Two poles, a white bedsheet, and ropes - this will serve as a backup
	screen in case the cliffs don't work for the video projector.
	They must also have something to hold them in place.

3.  Flashlights - everyone bring flashlights

4.  Drinks - a few more people could bring water or juice to make sure we
	have enough.  Paper cups would be nice too.

5.  Fruit - If anyone can get bulk bags of oranges or something, that would
	be great.

6.  PICKUP TRUCK - no pickup truck, then no bonfire, and only two tables.

7.  Spare wedges of wood, to balance and make sturdy the DJ table on top
	of the rock.

8.  A Ladder - a nice strong 8ft one would be perfect.

9.  Ropes - strong ones, thin ones, all kinds - you never know what we'll
	need 'em for.

10.  A emergency kit - bandaids, etc., in case something happens.



	Okay, that should be it. Man, you people must be REALLY sick of
hearing me ask for stuff, huh?  I mean, REALLY sick! :)

Subject: Rave report, Club DV8 Friday Aug 14

Well, there were a few of us at club DV8 on friday night. I was hot to rave
and there was nothing appealing on Saturday night, so I decided to go.

The cover was $10, which was pretty good considering everything that was
going on inside. All of DV8 was open. There were three dance floors and
more little nooks and crannies to explore than I've ever seen at a rave.

The music was pretty much hit and miss most of the evening, but there were
three dance floors, so there was always something good to dance to somewhere.
Spun did his usual wicked set in the basement at about 3:30.

There were way too many people there, too much attitude, and it was too 
damn hot ... until about 3:00 a.m. It's a good thing I didn't get there
'til 2.

Pete's rave tip: If you're going to a rave where alcohol is going to be a
major part of the evening's profits (which is most raves held in clubs and
most 21+ raves) it will suck until at least 2:30 (probably more like 3:00).
Don't even bother to show up until 2:00. Also, if you're at a rave and it
does suck, try to hold out until 3:00, it'll probably get better by then.

Overall, I had a good time. There was a little more attitude there than I
like, but there was always something fun to do somewhere.

Just a few comments on this one.

Indeed there was no music spun on Saturday nite; the sound truck got
stuck on the beach, and as they were planning on turning it off at
10 or 11 pm, it never happened.  Saturday nite turned out to be sort
of the coolest Kamping trip you could have never thought of, 300 young
ravers all hopping from campfire to campfire, with the biggest crowds
at the best car stereos.

Sunday the tunes came on, with a few people raving all day and the biggest
crowds after the evening came and cooled things off a bit (ever tried
dancing in near 100 degree sun?), with the main attraction being
swimming in the river, floating canoes around the local flat water, and
smearing mud all over your body and letting it dry bright green.

Two or three Sonoma County Sherriffs patrolled the campground once every
30 minutes for two days straight; musta felt kind of dumb after so many
trips and not a bust to be had (as far as I heard....?)  Perhaps the most
telling trivia was the 50 decibel noise level limit for the night;
someone brought a meter and clocked the crickets doing 62 dB!?!?!  Yeeeeah!
Crickets breaking the law!  (So why didn't the sherriffs start
rounding them up and hauling them off to the pokey *=:-} ?? )

All in all, it was more of a camping trip with 299 of your best friends,
but still made it into the personal rave noteworthy as being one of the
best damn ways you could escape the warehouses for a weekend.  $20?  Too
much for pancakes in the morning and a camping trip; hmmmmm why is
it I am sure if you ask any of the organizers I'm sure they'll tell you
they lost a coupla grand???

Get a flatbed truck and have the entire sound system secured it, all fully

he/she could even play while the car is going to the next location!

You're not doing anything wrong, really, unless they ask you to leave and you
don't.  And many people I know thrive off living under a state of seige. :)

So make sure the drivers aren't intoxicated.  And give everyone clear

It took them months to find that place, plus I'm sure the farmer is expecting

danger would be eating me alive.

no...the idea is that you want to know who all the narcs are and
not have thme know that you know
tell all your friends and let them tell their friends
and then they might give up because of such a low yield

tell the cops you know they are narcs, then yes, they will send out
new ones and new ones and new ones and if you really piss them off
they might just call out someone bigger than they are
(doubt it, most people have egos about stuff like that)
but it is that ego that will make them pissed at you for 
screwing with them

dont piss off cops blatently!

yeah.. you should always talk to cops if you are sober,
let them know that you are just a bunch of people
who want to hang out together and listen to music
and maybe dance a little or something like that

having attractive people talk to them may or may not get you

It wasn't just pancakes and camping -- how many DJ's had to be paid?
15?  They also paid for virtually unlimited canoe rentals, security,
(@ $28/hr -- I asked them if they were available for Connection, but
they're surely out of our budget), and a couple of *ace* lawyers who
literally saved the event at the 11th hour.  I think $20 was a steal,
for all that went into this whole weekend of fun!

We were there for about seven hours Sunday, and heard some brilliant
mixing by Spun, Harry Who, and Nikki Rivera.  Wish we'd been able
to stay for the evening, when things were cooler, but swimming in the
river was so lovely alternating with dancing in the 95-degree-in-the-shade
heat...

[stuff deleted before and after]

How about having a pirate radio station and have someone dj there. Then all the
ravers will go to a meeting point and everyone will turn on their radio to that
station.  If the cops gets in the way, we just move on to another location or
city.  The equipment stays in one place (if they don't get caught) and we just 
move on.  It will be almost like the Pump Up The Volume movie.

While hassle-free partying is certainly more conducive to having fun, 
I would be a less-happy raver if the political implications of raving 
were dismissed just so everyone could always "have a good time."

Given any set of circumstances, there are limited choices I can make 
in compliance with those circumstances; given a chance to dream, 
I would choose a different set of circumstances. 

Raving questions the limits of our civil rights to gather both socially 
and politically for whatever reason. Raving further questions the extent 
to which we are free citizens (an oxymoron?) under modern (late) capitalism.
Moreover, the privatization and capitalization of raves by certain promoters 
(and, more recently, by the media) adds, IMHO, an interesting and problematic
complexity to rave idealism.

If you want a hassle-free party, throw one in your own home; 
but please don't call it a rave.

Fantasy- a sound system secured to the bed of a truck; a driver for the 
truck; the DJ riding shotgun (I personally call riding shotgun riding 
bitch, but anyway); all followed by a bus? A moveable feast rave???

I have to say that I am with Niels on this.  It sounds wonderful in theory,
but in practice it will only alienate the cops and people in general.
You've all heard me go on at length about this before, so I won't bore you
with the repetition, however you are missing what I think is his best point
-  that it just plain sucks to be raving and have to leave because it gets
shut down.  Don't we all slag Feel-X for the very same reason?
Also, I dont think it is yet time to start alienating the cops.  AlthoughI'm

them turning political if the cops keep on harassing quiet and harmless
parties like the beach last Sunday [2 cops in a car and 4 on motorcycles
just to bust a guy with a bud in a film can?  sounds like a big wast of my

Subject: Connection: field report, BD beach, Mon. night.


	Due to stopping in the city to make the downpayment on buses, I was
unable to get to the beach until 9:55.  I parked my car on BD road, where I
happened upon 8 other cars with people standing around them, looking like
they were trying to decide what to do.  Uh-oh, I thought, party time in
action.  I walked to the beach with a few of them; they said they were High
School students from San Jose who were here to party. *sigh*. Many of
them had bottles of various forms of alcohol.

	At 10PM there were two cars in the parking lot, but another ten on
BD road. No cops, but MORE than enough fog. 

	I walked along the ridge separating the beach from the highway. 
Unless we can open a locked gate at the north end or convince a farmr to let
us drive in from the south, there isn't any way for a car to get down there
(who posted saying cops drove down there? - I _did_ see fresh car tracks)
so we'll have to carry the equipment in.

	For an hour I walked around the beach, checking out where the DJ
stand will be se up, where the dance floor will be, where projections will
go from, the cliffs, etc.  All of it will work perfectly.

	The HS partiers had a fire going and were setting off firecrackers.
They seemed like a relatively peaceful bunch.  I didn't tell them anything 
about what we were doing. (Whaddaya think I am, stoopid? :)

	At about 11:30 I went driving looking for anymore entrances to the
accss road to the train tracks, which will also get us over the ridge. I
almost ruined my blazer in the process... anyways, on my way back to the
beach, a cop car passed in the opposite direction, so I stopped to check out
the two cars left in the BD parking area.  They both had $33 parking tickets.
HOWEVER, the cops obviously didn't go over the ridge to the beach, because
when I went over it, I saw a fairly large bonfire raging, in addition to a 
loud beatbox, and about 30 people total.  The fire must have been apparent to
the cops, because I could see the glow in the heavy fog. 

	I am told that this fog is very rare, so I hope there won't be 
this much on Thursday. If the fog is as bad Thursday night as it was 
last night, I won't bring out the video projector out. (but other electronics
should be safe - I'll bring towels to cover stuff just in case)


	So the obvious question is, how should we deal with any possible
partiers who may show up?  Most of the night's revelers were there by ten,
and some had started leaving by 11:30, when I left.  So, the bulk of them
would arrive before the first bus of ravers even arrives. 

	I suggest this: we're going to have a couple of people in front
of the beach and near the entrance to Bonny Doon road. Bonny Doon road
will be filled with the cars of sfraver staff.  So we tell them that
we are having a "gathering" here tonight, fully sanctioned by the police, 
and they are welcome to join us if 1) they leave their alcohol in the car
(we can even threaten to call in the cops on this) 2) they park at the 
shuttle bus point, and 3) they give donations.  Howzat?  They can't
really refuse in the face of us calling the police.  I think most of them
would move on rather than try and argue with us.  


	So if everyone gave a sacrifice to the fog monster....

	Brian

Welp, I attended it as well, and pointed out Larry's button and let him
know I was on here as well, I just don't have a button. :)  I stayed
for the first set as well, and when the second set began with more improv
techno, my friend and I decided to leave.  PTV was a very friendly bunch,
and I did get to sing with Genesis for a brief moment when he walked into
the audience.  I kept thinking he would try to push some juicer on me or
something, because Gen looked like he was from some talk show to me.  It kept
weirding-out my friend and I as we were anticipating some sort of sales
pitch from the way Gen looks. :)  We kept wondering if his hair was real too.

But we enjoyed the music and danced the whole first set.  The improv techno
was intense, but was a little sparse.  What can you expect from improv?
Genesis dedicated a song to the Queen of England which reminded the crowd
that Genesis was once into layers of noise (Throbbing Gristle).  I wasn't
expecting to hear anything like it, so it made me hhappy when he did so.

Paula smiled at me. :)  I noticed her belly button ring is larger than mine. (:

Overall, I enjoyed the evening, and hope to be at Bonny Doon on the 20th.

Ummm. Like the rave scene is really "underground" anymore now that you can
find flyers for every big rave in most any haight-street store and posters
for toontown on the kiosks.

Like didn't y'all see the cover-story articles on raving in the SF Weekly
or Bay Guardian back in February?? Like y'all didn't see the various TV
reportage of raving?

It's old news!

The thing to do is to become friends/friendly w/ the reporters so that they
feel invited into the scene, rather than the feeling of being an
observer/alien/outsider -- unless they've got deep-rooted phobias against
technno/disco/house/dancing, they'll probably end up seeing something
positive about it and writing positive articles. Any journalist knows the
power of omitting a few unecessary details in order to help a cause.

Ooops... and I just put a NYC-based guy that writes for Option Magazine
(friend of my sister & her-husband & his-sister) in touch w/ a bunch of
ravers because he's writing an article on the "SF rave scene" for that mag.
(He was at the FMR too! ... I've also told him about Connection).

(I also took my 33-yr-old sister and her husband (visiting from NYC) to the
FMR -- it was their first rave ever, and they liked it alot. They were
especially glad they saw what the place and the people looked like in the
light after sunrise.)

	I saw the following article in the current (15-21 August 1992) issue

scenes in Britain, written in the usual humorous, understanding and still
slightly-paternalistic tone of pretty much the rest of the writing in this
magazine...

[reprinted _without_ permission]

The Economist
15-21 August 1992
p. 47

"The travellers' club"

	Britain's well-known love of liberty and tolerance of eccentricity
have their limits. People with dirty hair who refuse to buy houses clearly
overstep them. These "so-called travellers," said Lord Ferrers, the Home
Office minister with responsibility for the police, "are a direct assault on
the structure of social life in the country." After big festivals in
Herefordshire, Powys and Hampshire, the government is planning to curb their
freedom to cruise around the fringes of society by making it harder to
collect unemployment benefit and, possibly, by tightening up the already
stiff Public Order Act.

	Lord Ferrers has failed to notice the useful social functions that
travellers perform. They offer ideal newspaper copy in the slow summer
months. Their anarchistic vagrancy reignites in discontented
mortgage-holders a belief that property is the basis of social order. And
they give unheard-of ministers a chance to make silly statements.

	Every summer in the past 20 years, a couple of hundred free,
open-air music festivals have take place somewhere in the countryside. If
the festivals have grown in size, that s partly thanks to the behavious or
some police forces. The 20,000-strong festival at Castlemorton in
Herefordshire, for instance, was the result of Operation Nomad, conducted by
the Wiltshire, Avon & Somerset and Gloucestershire police, all determined
that no festival should take place on their beat. They swept up all the
travellers they could find and shoved them over the border, leaving the
unsuspecting West Mercia police to take care of the problem.

	The growing popularity of hippie-dom also swells the festivals. It
is not so much that all the country's youth is taking to the road, but that
new elements have been turning up at the festivals. These participants now
divide into three groups.

o NEW AGE TRAVELLERS,previously known as hippies. They have been around
since the late 1960s. Some of them have been on the road all their adult
lives; some have brought up children, now teenagers, on the road. Their
beliefs tend to include some sort of mysticism, a distaste for cities and
passive dislike of The System. Nobody really knows how many of them there
are, but a figure of 10,000 is bandied about. According to Don Aitken, of
the Travellers' Aid Trust, new recruits are either middle-class, educated
types who have come to view that this is the best way of life, or
working-class kids whose lives in the city offer less freedom than does
vagrant poverty on the road.

o THE BREW CREW, named after their favourite drink, Carlsberg Special Brew.
They wear singlets, boots reminiscent of the skinheads' Doc Martens and
facial expressions derived directly from the punks. Their trade-mark is a
small black dog on a string. They are largely urban types, who take to the
road for bits of the summer. THeir active nastiness has been a bit of a
problem for other travellers: the hippies' determined tolerance has forced
them to put up with vanloads of drunk anarchists who join their camps and
fail to bury their excrement. But they are few and, the hippies say,
becoming fewer.

o RAVERS: the tens of thousands of bored children of all classes who used to
go to acid-house parties before those were shut down by the police and new
legislation. They have turned en masse to the hippies' festivals.

	In one way, the hippies have benefited from the ravers' invasion.
They make a bit of money by selling the tourists vegan curries, nutburgers
and bottled water to quench drug-induced thirst. In another way, they are
horrified. Having dropped out of urban life to find peace in the
countryside, they now find that thousands of city kids are roaring down the
motorways to join them. With the kids have come vast mobile sound systems
run by outfits called things like Spiral Tribe, Rough Crew and Circus Warp.
THeir rave music drowns out the hippies' unamplified bongo drums and
tambourines.

	Hippies also tend to disapprove of the drugs ravers bring with them:
cannabis, of course, is fine, but city kids take Ectasy, or a mixture of
acid and speed, which loosens the bowels. Hippies tend to carry shovels with
them; ravers do not. On the subject of ravers and the Brew Crew, hippies can
sound remarkably blimpish. Of their music Mr Aitken says, "they seem to
regard it as their job to keep a very loud noise going."

	If tighter laws are introduced, the hippies may suffer as a
consequence of the ravers' invasion. It is hard enough already to live on
the road and not break the law. A traveller cannot simply rent a
weed-covered, set-aside field from a farmer for a couple of weeks: the
farmer will be charged with running an unlicensed caravan site. Nor can a
farmer rent travellers a field without getting a license; and councils tend
to demand prohibitive prices for licenses in order to drive the festivals
into somebody else's backyard.

	Trying to stop these things happening is pointless as well as
illiberal. They will go on, as their persistence over the years has shown;
and trying to suppress them means more expensive forms of conflict between
the police and already discontented kids. Some sensible policemen are
already thinking about other ways of dealing with the business. Leading a
delegation to see Lord Ferrers, Ron Hadfield, chief constable of the West
Midlands and head of the top police officers' public-order committee,
broached the possibility of setting up permanent sites for the festivals.

As far as i can tell, there are no political implications of raving.  The
posting I was responding to had more of a tone of
do-it-to-break-the-law-and-thumb-our-noses-at-normal-people-trying-to-
go-about-their-normal-lives.

My basic feeling is that such behavior, in absence of a political
motivation to gather/protest, isn't a good idea. It just annoys people and
gives off a negative image in place of a neutral or positive one.

If the travelling illegal rave had a reason for existing other than just
thrillz-for-kidz and annoying people, I'd never have reacted so negatively
about the idea.

A while back, I posted something about politicized raving -- the
rave-to-ensure-everybody-votes -- and didn't see much of a positive
response to the idea.  My feeling is that the average rave-kid is less
interested in politics than partying -- this is not necessarily the case
with the various SFRavers I've met, but SFRavers aren't exactly "average."

FYI, the only explicit political referent I caught in the discussion
leading up to this was in Tim Hyland's posting about "highly illegal raves"
where he concluded:

| They're organized (and I use that term loosely) with more of a Queer Nation
| feel ("we're here, we're queer, and we're not going back") than a rave feel,
| but same idea.

I don't think a bunch of us shouting
	"We're ravin' -- ain't misbehavin',
	 your laws are wack -- get off my back jack!"
would get us very far... nor be taken very seriously... but it would be
enough for me to morally/ethically justify such activity.

> If you want a hassle-free party, throw one in your own home; 
> but please don't call it a rave.

Eh? 

> Raving questions the limits of our civil rights to gather both socially 
> and politically for whatever reason.

This has never been explicitly stated anywhere in the article I was
responding to. If this was the banner under which the travelling-rave would
occur, I would partially retract most of my comments.

But, as I said, I read the postings I responded to as an exhortation to
annoy the fuck out of normal-walking-around-people while revelling in the
adrenalin of doing something marginal. This may be fun for those involved,
but it is at somebody else's expense. Ultimately, it really no different
than, say, gangstas hanging out on a street corner, having fun by
hassling/threatening/bothering passers-by that aren't in their gang.

I'd much rather increase the peace....

> Raving further questions the extent 
> to which we are free citizens (an oxymoron?) under modern (late) capitalism.

As an entailment of the act of raving, the consequences of "raving" may
lead us to question our ultimate freedom... however "raving" itself hasn't
been at all explicit about asking that question. Neither was the article I
responded to.

The only explicit case I can think of is that rave up in sacramento to
protest laws against all-night dancing...

And I most certainly don't need a rave to tell me about the state of our
personal freedom. And you don't need a weatherman to tell you which way the
wind blows either.

Huh?  What is this?  Going to search folks?  I thought the thing was
acceptance.  An open attitude.  What would you think if _they_ were there
first, and told you that this beach is where they hold their "parties",
that you must leave your drugs in your car, and give them money or they'd
call the police?  I'd think: What a bunch of officious assholes.

Talk about using the police to enforce the rave view of what's acceptable
strikes me as a tad hypocritical when done in the same forum that has been
bleating about how the police are shutting raves down.

If raves are supposed to be a place to be open, friendly and accepting, does
that mean only to the 'right' people the doorman lets in?  Let everyone in -
and try being open and friendly to _everyone_, and you might find there are
more 'right' kinds of people than you thought.

Subject: parties, hassles and cops


Much as I enjoy illegal locations, gatherig in a public well-populated
place for a party is inviting trouble.
It's more fun to go to a secret abandoned location that has a chance
of not getting busted (while prepared for it) than going to a place just
to be busted.
As for cops, they are just like frat boys.(no offence to anyone out
there who is in a fraternity, this is a generalization after living
next to and opposite from fraternities for 3 years)
When you meet 1 frat boy, he is a reasonable human being with a brain
and reasonable behaviour, when you see a bunch of them together, they
share 1 neuron, get drunk/sick and act stupid. Cops as a group just
act stupid.
I thought all cops were scums, then I met some of them in person, and they
are reasonable people. Some of them believe that they are doing good
things.(Of course, there are scums out there too). It's the law makers that
have no regard for the wishes of the people that are at fault. Just look
at the traffic laws for example, if no one wants to drive under 55mph,
 then why set a limit at 55mph.
Drug laws are stupid too. Hemp was everywhere until some money grabbing
scum decided to make it illegal so that they can make money filling
the need for it artificially (medicine, fibres etc).

The alcohol is illegal.  The police will throw us off the beach if people
don't leave their alcohol in their cars.  And then the rave will stop
existing.  And then we won't meet anyone at all.

Is totally is.  Unfortunately, one of the preconditions wuth the SC Sherriff
is that there's no underage drinking, and by my book the only way to
convince _them_ that we mean it is to not allow alcohol on the beach.  I'm
not a teetotaler and I don't discount that some people may find alcohol at
a rave fun and somewhat needed; but if we don't want to get busted up, this
is what we gotta do.

We're not going to search folk.  We will impress upon them that alcohol will
be frowned upon, but if they are discreet about it and keep it to a small
bottle or hide it in their backpack, I think we can let it slide... There will
be no problem enforcing this, as the bus drivers know that I don't want alcohol
on the buses, and will help the map point people enforce this.

All I want to do is keep people from bringing kegs in.  But if they want to 
hold their own party on the other end of the beach....

>What would you think if _they_ were there
>first, and told you that this beach is where they hold their "parties",
>that you must leave your drugs in your car, and give them money or they'd

Well, we _will_ be there first, so there's no danger of that happening. :)

I'd go to one of the dozen other beaches around there first, but I agree with
what you're trying to say.  Like I said before, if they want to have a party
on the other end of the beach, there's not much we can do about it.

>Talk about using the police to enforce the rave view of what's acceptable
>strikes me as a tad hypocritical when done in the same forum that has been

Look, I'm trying to do this right, so it _doesn't_ get shut down.  I don't
consider it hypocritical.  As an individual, I could care less; I really am
not out to stop the consumption of alcohol at raves in general.  But as the
organizer, saying that we need to keep alcohol out is exactly the same as 
clubs that do serve alcohol saying the need to keep out those under 21.  What
actually happens is another story; but if the police show up and the rum is
a-flowin', it could be bad.

Maybe I am being somewhat dictatorial, and those who know me should know I'm
not normally like this.  But as I've found out from other rave organizers and
running other "events" in my life, you have to be somewhat pushy to make sure
everything goes as planned.

>If raves are supposed to be a place to be open, friendly and accepting, does

No, of course not.  I wasn't saying they shouldn't come in; in fact I think the
crowd that was there last night would probably have really gotten into it. :)

>Let everyone in -

Everyone is welcome, as long as they leave their egos at home and have an open
mind.

Subject: CONNECTION DIRECTIONS


first off, **SAVE THIS**. 

Okay, here are the directions for getting to the location.

The directions to JUST THE SC MAP POINT for those of you not helping to set up
or arriving after 11:30PM:

Take the 17 south (17 connects to the 280, 101, and 880 in San Jose) to Santa
Cruz.  Right as you enter SC there will be a sign for hwy 1 north.  Take it.
Stay on the 1 for a couple miles. The last stoplight you will see, right on
the edge of the city, is Western.  The next road after that, is Shaffer. Take
a left on Shaffer.  Shaffer is a non-residential area, with wide streets, and
the buses will be very soon after the turn.  If the buses aren't there look
for where people are grouped together. Don't arrive there before 11:15 or so 
- the first bus will be leaving SF at 10PM, and will arrive at the beach aroun
11:30, and get to the map point for the first load around 11:45.  The second
bus will be an hour later.  Donations will be asked for on the way onto the 
bus.

Starting at 6am there is legal parking at the beach, so starting then people
can go get their cars and drive to the beach if they feel like staying later
than 8am, which is when the last bus to SF leaves.



For those of you who will be coming early to help setup/cleanup/etc., you can
park at the beach until 10, at which time you must move your cars to BD road.
Bonny Doon Beach is almost exactly 7.2 miles north or Shaffer, and 1 mile south
of Davenport (i.e., if you hit Davenport you've gone too far).  There is a 
big parking area on the right, and Bonny Doon road on the left.

If you choose to take the 92 -> 1 south or 84 -> 1 south route, like I said,
BD is one mile south of Davenport.  You'll even see a sign that says "Bonny
Doon 3 <-", signifying the town of Bonny Doon up the hill 3 miles.  If you're
coming from SF I would recommend the 92->1 route - I got from Van Ness to BD
in around an hour and 15.

Hope this is clear... if not just hollar.  These will be pretty much the
directions on the phone messages, sans the staff parking.  I've decided to
make all non-staff parking at the SC location.

A rave with an explicit political purpose -- an ADMIT IT in
SF, for example, to protest the cops hassling the GG Park
raves -- would make a lot of sense.

A vaguely anarchic roving party also sounds interesting,
though it's worth putting some thought into how to avoid
needlessly annoying people.  For instance, pirate radio
transmitting to roving boxes is a good idea.  Or maybe it
should be college radio?  KFJC would be good for south bay,
if you could talk them into doing a techno marathon... (KZSU
is cool too, but it's too short range to be much good, sorry
pat).  Anyway, radio is good because the volume would be way
below the 5000 Gigawatt level.  And if you keep the site
moving you don't bug anyone for more than a short period of
time.

The idea of sitting still and waiting for the police to tell
you to move sounds like a bad idea, though.  Better to
predict the  police's response time, and set up a schedule,
like a half an hour in one place, then bug out.  

Continuous motion (a rave parade?) sounds nice, but I think
in practice the cops would track your movement and put in
road blocks.  

Anyway, if none of this sounds fun to you, no one is going
to force you to do it.  If you want safety, just stick to
the ones that are safe...

Let me expand on that a little, as highway 1 becomes Mission Street
for 2 miles, and this can be confusing to non-locals:

At the end of highway 17 follow the signs for Highway 1 - North.
The road will veer to the right and you will pass the entrance for
highway 9 at the first stoplight.  Turn right onto Mission Street
at the 2nd stoplight (highway 1 becomes Mission Street for 2 miles
in Santa Cruz).  Stay on Mission Street all the way through Santa
Cruz.  After you pass a Safeway on the left and one final 7-11
the road becomes Highway 1 again.  Western Drive is the first street
(and stoplight) immediately after you get on the highway again,
and Shaffer Drive is just beyond that (no stoplight though).

Brian, you may want to add (part of) this to the phone directions as well.

Well, if you're coming from the South, going North on 1, the parking area
and beach are on the left, and bonny doon road is on the right.

Yes, 280->92->1 is the best way from SF.  *Don't* take 84->1; it'll take
an extra ~30 minutes.  

If you live in the South Bay, even if you live/work near 84, 
I recommend 280->17 as a much faster route (than 84->1).

I built an FM transmitter last week.  The kit was $30 and was easy to solder
together.  It broadcast over two city blocks before being shorted out by a
rainstorm.  I've also got some mods for it if you want to make it more
powerful :-).  Crystal clear sound as well.

Sounds cool!  Wish I was in Colorado!  Try something like that here in San
Francisco at this time of year, and you get a nice big fog bank to look at!

Share and enjoy,

Yikes!  Thanks for the tip.  I called the sound rental and the generator
rental and found out that I needed 4000 watts for what I'm doing.  Would have
been a severe bummer to setup and find out that I didn't have enough power
that late in the game.  It was only $10 more for the 4K generator anyway.

Now lets, see, 4000 watts on the generator, times four speakers, times two
amps, times the time of day.  Hmmm, obviously equals 150,000 BOOMING XDZEBRA
WATTS OF BASS!

Subject: Re: analytical fantasy ( -- actually pirate radios )

Do we really want discussions such as this sitting in mail spools all over
the country?

Mind you, there are many ways to have a legal transmission, even if not from
the usual radio stations, and I heartily endorse the idea. Then I can drive
around with my stereo blasting, and have the party in my CAR.

It's just that the Snoopy Unpleasant People With Ties have busted bulletin
boards,, confiscated computers, and in general created Nasty Unpleasantness
for less provocation than what is being said here. Whether or not they are
"right" for doing so is an entirely separate subject. I, personally, do not
feel the need to be fingerprinted anytime soon.

I'm sure Ms Haynes doesn't mind, since undoubtedly her fingerprints are on
file at all your better Law Enforcement Agencies (smile honey, you're on
candid camera), but let's minimize hassle and maximize fun.

And, just to add fuel to the fire, my roommate is a licensed radio engineer
and technician, and could undoubtedly provide all the equipment necessary
and plenty of free technical advice. But that should be discussed in private
surroundings, n'est-ce pas?

Touche, mon ami. 

But I really don't know how seriously illegal, or what the penalties are
for non-licensed radio transmissions in this country. I'm pretty sure there
are many other countries where it is not a criminal case.

Anyway, as you said, it is pretty easy for anybody with an elementary 
electronics background to build a transmitter and I suspect it isn't
illegal to even publish schematics. I have a vague recollection of
seeing some in old magazines (for educational purposes only :-)).

Subject: Final "what we need" list, plus this week's rave guide.


Okay, things are coming together!  I just have a few more wish-list items,
if anyone out there can supply them....

flourescent light fixtures (4 tubes)
	(Bob Jesse has 4 4' fourescent tubes but no fixtures)
white sheets & rope - BIG white sheets (we can attach them together with duct
	tape to make them even bigger) - for making screens for the cliffs
	in case they don't reflect as well as they should. And any sort of
	rope will help.

And of course, the omnipresent need for a truck, but this time it's just for
wood, and actually any sort of payload space would work marvelously...


Okay, now for this week's list.  I bet you know what's first:

(oh, p.s. - if you're coming to help setup, it'd probably be smart to bring
food for yourself for dinner, as we shouldn't leave the beach.. 'course, 
someone could always make a pizza run... :)

UPCOMING RAVES IN THE SF/BAY AREA                     Last modified: 8/19/92
****************************************************************************

Thursday, August 20th - Connection: the first ever SFRaves RAVE. This will
	be held on a beach in Santa Cruz; DJ's for the event so
	far are Carlos, Moonpup, Dutch, DJ Drew from Sacramento,
	El Dorado (who some of you may remember from the picnic as Edan
	Cassidy, who I thought was better than the Hardkisses) and our 
	very own Jon Drukman.  The rave will be _free_, only because we
	can't control admission to the beach; however, since there is no
	parking in front of the beach for miles, we will be running shuttles
	from Santa Cruz throughout the night, and we'll ask for a $5 donation
	there.  There will also be two buses leaving from SF early
	in the night and returning in the morning.  Price for that is $15.
	(mandatory). This is a 	_beautiful_ location, and we're going to do 
	some GREAT stuff with it. Info numbers: 415-267-4889, 510-814-2233  
	Also, write me if you're willing to help (we need volunteers!).  This 
	will be a NON-PROFIT rave.  All money goes to DJ's and lighting and

Subject: SF trip summary(long)

well, i am back in boston and i figured because i bothered you all
getting info before the trip, i owed you a summary.

Revelation-it was o.k. lots of yuck types, good music, and the people that
had energy at 1AM still had it at 5AM.

ToonTown-despite about a million anti-recommendations, this rave was great.
sure, there were a heck of a lot of first time ravers there, but THEY
WERE INTO IT. that is much more important than wearing stylish rave-wear
and having the biggest glow-necklace, IMHO. i only rode on the gravitron
ride because it made me sick and i couldn't try the others. the music was
generally fun, especially later on in the morning. they had great
concessions there.

mission rock(sunday)-i only went in for about 1/2 hour because my friend
wasn't 21. it seemed pretty decent but there was a lot of attitude
going around, and it definitely had more of a club atmosphere than a
rave one. i actually felt underdressed there, which i give no nevermind
to here.

bahia(monday)-very groovy place. the DJ that spun early played very
boston-esque techno; that is happy techno with lyrics and keyboard
riffs. then it was all house music. the crowd seemed to know each other
well, but they weren't snooty at all. it's a nice small place that
i would definitely frequent if i lived there.

the top(tuesday)- house music all night long. this teeny club had good
house happening, with some deep house and techno. the neighborhood
left a lot to be desired, and inside it was 400 degrees. good music
in a small place. :)

FULL MOON RAVE(wednesday)
  wowza wowza-this is rave. this felt like the after-hours parties we
have here, with only the nicest heads(sorry-that means groovy, fun,
attitude free people) and lots of energy. it was even nice weather,
which i experienced twice while there. if you were there and didnt
see me, that's because i was having thE most EXcEllEnt timE and
lost track of a lot of things. i met about 100 people that night.
the music was great-similair to boston stuff, but ahead of us.

Juice/Destination Venus(friday)-well, it was a bit boring. yes, DV8
is one monster club, but it didn't feel like a club. i was on the
second floor most of the night because my friends were there, so
i can't say anything for sure about the other floors. the crowd was
generally yucky, beer-guzzlers trying to pick up babes. not that i 
didn't have fun- i can have fun at any rave, but it was more of an effort 
here than anywhere else.

Beach rave(sunday)-i am glad we showed up late for this, because it
didn't start until late afternoon. the people there were groovy,
but dancing in the sand was difficult. (note: cardboard is a must for
Connection) the music was too quiet for my taste. it was a fun chill
out activity, though i can see why people say the park was better.

NOTES________________________________

1. every rave i went to served alcohol except full moon. YUCK YUCK
   and DOuble YUCK! i have never been to a rave here that served.
   the beer-drinkers sober up even earlier and leave.

2. our raves are smaller, but a greater percentage stay until they
shut the music off in the morning.

3. none of the techno there has any vocals. personally, i love the
wailing diva type music. 

4. there was trancy stuff there, but none of what we call trance here.
  of course, no trance really has lyrics and it's hard to find the
titles of, so i can'y really compare.

5. i didn't here any of what we call hardcore techno.-did anyone
go to the Frankie Bones rave???????????? you have heard it.
(how was that rave, BTW?)

6. for as many watts as you guys advertise, it seems a lot louder
out here. i wear earplugs here and there i wanted them to turn it up.
i felt the need to dance near the speakers all night.

7. your raves aren't that far ahead of ours. just bigger and with more
special effects. and a whole lot more of them. maybe i enjoy ours
so much because i don't gop to them 3 nights a week. (more like 3 times
a month, the rest in clubs.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
all in all, i had a great time in SF!!!
thanks a lot to everyone for your comments and suggestions, i took
a lot of them. if anyone ver comes to the boston area, drop
me a note and i'll return the favor.

	This is a great idea for the next large outdoor rave.
	We can build/get a low power FM transmitter and broadcast the mix
	right from the DJ's coffin.  As long as the power is low
	Its perfectly legal and people sitting on the outskirts can
	hear the music better.  It's also a good idea if you have limited
	power in your main set up, everyone can add to the decibel level
	by turning on their individual Boom Boxes!

sounds good. i assume it's in utah.... oh well, guess I can't make it.

umm... if you're using a normal class AB power amplifier, you'll need
more like > 1200 watts of generator if you really want your 800 watt
(RMS) amplifier to work properly and without distortion. 

If it's a class A amplifier, you'll need at least 1600 watts of generator.

If it's one of those crappy Carver magneto-quackology amplifiers,
check the instruction manual and then check your brain, since Carver
power amplifiers suck badly. (why? because they sound like shit!)

Here's an idea I came up with years ago when Rave was just a brand of
shampoo... 

A giant 'silent' party where everyone has a Walkman radio, with head
phones, of course, all tuned to the same, possibly pirate, station.

Just an idea; and actually I have doubts about how much fun it would
be. However, I did once hear a bunch of good car stereos all tuned to
the same station and as the guy said, that is really nice.

(BTW, Y'all have seen Rave shampoo, haven't you? What if someone got a
bunch of never-used empties from the factory and served drinks in
them, yuk yuk)

How about this great or stupid idea of having everyone put on their walkman
headphones, tune to that station and start dancing.  I wonder how a cop will 
react when he sees over 100 walkman-wearing ravers dancing, and the cop doesn't even hear any music.

if the radius of coverage is less than a mile
i believe, i forget what the actual radius is, but i know it
is pretty small, but big enough to have fun

and it is totally legal
but im not sure if you are allowed to move the transmitter

it would be a neat thing to try to do
just set up a transmitter and dont let the cops in on the frequency
and hope that no one else does either and there ya go

just broadcast short messages every once in awhile
maybe have codes set up so you can send out false

or better yet... have a rave at the police HQ...

   Sure there are ways of having a legal FM transmission.  And you
could call those "pirate" radio stations.  They don't transmit very
far though.  But what's the problem of talking about it. 
   I have heard of (slightly) illegal pirate radio stations at
relatively low power (10 watts) broadcasting to over half of the US.
I assume though that this would be AM or shortwave.
   It would be kind of neat though to have a wide area rave or a
mobile rave organized through a radio staion or pirate station.

"Where's Techno in the Bay Area?" I found that the most complete store is
Compact Disc Land on University Avenue in Palo Alto. Though they don't have
UFOrb or the Blue Room :<(   they do have the best selection of techno I've
seen -- and it's all in a techno section, not scattered throughout rock or rap.
They also have one copy of the Orb video, complete with CD, for $40. I wanted toget it, but I shook the piggy bank and only got a squeal.
  Oh yes, one other nice thing about this store: they have lots of techno that
you can trial-listen to before you buy.  I saved myself some $ by hearing beforeI bought (lost it all right back, though, because I wound up buying two discs I
listened to and liked.  Easy come, easy go....).

OK, just to clarify:

It is perfectly legal to operate an FM transmitter with no license at
all, under certain restrictions. These restrictions are complex and
mundane, but the practical upshot is that we could certainly do it.

There exist "transmitters" we can use, such as one of those "listen to
your CD in your car on the FM radio" boxes, which require no setup, no
work, no license, and cost less than $100. Hell, I might buy one just
for hack value. Putting one at the top of a flagpole would allow it to
broadcast a few hundred feet in any given direction, and the legality
of this is impeccable. As is, incidentally, the sound quality.

The attractive thing is that this could make a silent party, the
reality is that people will bring their booboxen, and if they make
enough noise, the cops can still close it down. It is the noise, and
the public gathering, that they are franchised to disrupt, but if you
can show that it is legal to have a "private party" at some place, and
if there are no noise complaints, there isn't much they can do.

But in any case, you're going to have to get a lawyer. Welcome to the

	It is not illegal to build and use FM transmitters of the type I'm
talking about. I don't know the wattage restriction but it is more than
enough to cover a moderately large outdoor area (like our beach for instance).

Some friends of mine have done the mobile pirate rave, where a bunch
of them descended on, of all places, the airport.

About ten of them went into one of the domestic terminals at about midnite,
when it's all still open but deserted, and went nuts screaming and yelling
and dancing to a boom box.

His further idea was to get many people to do it, in synchro with a
KMEL techno/house broadcast, there or in another location with many small
sources of music all tuned to the same  broadcast, hopefully with the
radio station DJ's aware of the project and playing to it.

This way, a group can do this thing being very mobile, without DJ's of
course.  Of course, the airport could be one of the stupidest places
to do it, with all the security and federal and interstate statutes
to put you in the pokey for a long while....

Great minds, etc. etc.!

And with this brainstorm about radio raves (wadio waves) just getting off

sfraves. It's fascinating and I like it but the volume, unfortunately,

(I had heard a rumor that sfraves covered the Northwest US as well,

I'm hoping we're on the brink of an amateur radio revival and suddenly
Radio Shack will rival record shops as a place to hang out. ("Rave
tonight on 92.4 Mhz, pass it on!") Take that, Mondo 2000 magazine!

The trick will be to keep it from being a sequel to the 1974 CB fad. Ugh.

are you quite sure?  i worked for a tiny (5 watt) FM station in
college that got shut down by the FCC.  apparently at one point
(pre-reagan) it was quite legal to run an unlicensed small (less than
10 watt) station.  this all changed, but the FCC had had its funding
slashed and they really didn't give a shit.  so long as the small
stations didn't step on any real licensed stations signal, they were
left alone.  we were exposed by a zealous reporter from the school
paper who wanted to make a name for himself.  unfortunately, the name
he wound up with was "dickhead" because he pissed off lots of people -
including the real official licensed school radio station.  the pirate
stations probably would have continued indefinitely had that guy never
written his story.

A british friend-o-mine has a more descriptive name for the UK "travellers"
that caravan about from place to place. He calls them "CRUSTIES" -- this
name comes from the fact that they rarely take showers and are generally
stinky scumbags.

Basically, at big "party/concerts" like the Glastonbury Festival, you'll
see the crusties covering themselves with dirt and mud and generally
rolling around in shit.

Doesn't sound like much fun to me, but then again, they'd probably not

The walkman-rave idea is really good.  Imagine doing that in a shopping
mall:  hundreds of people doing that ravey dancing, with no (audible)
music.  It would be great.  It would be so... trippy.

Actually, he was referring to a rave called Messiah.

But about Messiah the techno band....  A few months ago some people
were going around claiming to be Messiah and booking shows.  They
would come on stage, play about 20 minutes of mediocre techno,
including a very bad version of "There is no Law", and get paid for
it.  They stopped doing it after someone figured it all out and warned
clubs not to book them.

(Anyone wanna try being Depeche Mode?  I bet we could sell out Shoreline
Amphitheater.)

I thought some of you might want to know that the above parties are rumoured to
be organised by some real estate agent who has been using a few people more in
tune with the party scene to get in touch with the DJ's etc. Anyone able to back
this up or dispose of this rumour? Anyway I know for certain Harry Who is not
playing at Cool World tonight and DJ La Paix is suppoed to be in London right 
now so it seems unlikely he will be spinning either. 

The reason I send out these facts is that most the organisors in the San 
Francisco area have been up to now pretty good about not advertising DJ's who 
are not playing unlike the LA scene. I would urge you all to spread the fact 
that these parties are lying to us and try to boycott them as far as possible.
Spread the word and keep the scene alive by showing these people we are not as
stupid as they believe we are and by supporting the honest promoters out there.

Peace,

Richard

What can I say about Connection last night?  It was a blast (off).
Carlos is reconfirmed as a god-like D.J.  John, you spun pretty hard too
but I guess you have to being Gods' personal D.J.|-)  Brian, you made it
come through! - with good help.  The projector and lights were exellent.
I think that cliff made one of the best back-drops I've seen.  People 
seemed tripped out that it was such a good rave put on by new organizers.
A lot of people didn't even know who we were.  Sand is harder to dance on
than I thought.  That's about it, no use in wasting words on what we all
know.  I guess the only thing I'm left wondering is when's the next one?

although using an unlicensed transmitter is illegal, drawing and

but showing people how to grow it isn't. a schematics exists in a
recent issue of some mainstream stuff including an article about a

Wow man.
	Connection last night was quite possibly the most fun rave I've been 
to...I'm sure everyone will post about it so I'll just say I really enjoyed 
seeing everyone there...Jon's set was great, I had 2 or 3 people ask me who he was...maybe later I'll post the story about how a SF cop saved the day for 
about 8 SFRavers...
	Last night there was a journalist from Options Magazine there named 
Dudley Saunders.  He was a nice person and he enjoyed the rave, and he is researching for an article on the rave phenomenon, from the standpoint that it's got
more to it than just a bunch of kids partying...He asked me to post his address to the list because he would like for anyone interested to write him on the 
subject of 'the rave movement', whatever you think it may be about.  I feel he
will write a favorable article and I encourage everyone to send him a bit of 
mail.  His address is:

Yeah!  This was the best place I've ever seen for a rave, the visuals
were on par with any other ($20 or other) rave (the cliffs had something
to do with that), Carlos was great (I missed Jon while I was at the map
point unfortunately), everything we needed for rave heaven.  It's great
how we could get so many people to help and contribute in the true
spirit of the rave community.  In addition to big thanks to Brian, 
special thanks should go to Geoff and James who talked the police out
of shutting it down...maybe we should use Geoff's diplomatic skills
in Yugoslavia :)

I was there until 4 am and had to leave to go to work this morning,
everybody else is probably still sleeping.
It was fabulous. There were about 200 people when I was there.
People were still showing up when I was leaving.
The fog kept coming in and fading, and when the fog was in the lights looked
real cool. I brought my laser to shoot into the fog, but the tube refused
to charge up. :-(
There were a whole bunch of cops checking it out, but they seemed only to be
concerned about safety, such as people getting into the water and drowning,
and the parking situation. Some cars got tolled because the drivers didn't
read the signs. As far as I can tell, no one got hassled.
Dancing in the sand was difficult. There was a bunch of bonfires and
people sitting around them. The projection on the TV was way cool,the texture
of the cliff face gave the images an added dimension. A few people 
decided to cast their shadows on the screen by dancing in front of it.
Anyway, I better go since to get ready for Salad tonight, see you all there.

Subject: Connection, buses, cops and bongos

Ok, I'm feeling more awake now, so here's part of my connection experience...
	Gunther and I arrived at 4th and Townsend to set up the SF map point 
and meet the buses at arount 8:45.  The whole day had been kinda hectic...I'm 
surprised Brian hadn't pulled all his hair out by 5 pm.  We had just stopped 
by ameba and picked up the money and the bus tickets (which M Normals designed
and are REALLY cool...a great imitation of a MUNI fast pass) ...ameba only sold
2 tickets which looked pretty bad at the time.  The first bus arrived about 30 
minutes after we expected it but as of yet no passengers had arrived.  The 
first person to show up was Brad, who we ended up giving a ride.  After a few
minutes, Chris, Robert, Dudley (see previous post), M Normals, and some other 
SFravers, plus 2 people not on the list came and bought bus tickets.  There 
were nine or ten people in all who left with the first bus when the second one arrived.
	Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  No one ever arrived to take 
the second bus.  This looked real bad, as we had a total of $130 and the buses
cost Brian 4 or 5 times that.  We decided to tell the second bus that we didn't need 2 buses to try and save some money.  Just after we did this, and the 
driver was getting ready to leave, a SF police car pulled up.  We had seen him cruising around and checking things out, and I thought Oh Shit, here comes the 
harassment.  I was already making my way across the street to the caltrain 
station to call Brian and tell him the bad news, when Gunther starts waving 
frantically at me... The cop, looking through his car window, says 'Is this the
Albion Bus stop?' and I thought man we ARE about to get busted for something.  
The driver says Yes, and then the cop says (in a congenial tone) 'I'm glad I
caught you... Your first bus broke down in Pacifica and here's the phone number
they are at.'  and then he left.  I was completely blown away... here's a cop
helping a rave to happen! Definantly the coolest thing the police have done
for me in a long time.  We then drove to pacifica w/ the second bus behind us
and found the stranded people. (M or Chris or someone else should tell the
story of the bus ride, it sounded interesting...).  Needless to say that by
this time I wasn't expecting much from the party...from our standpoint, the 
SF bus scenario was almost a total disaster.
	God, we were blown away when we got there.  Bonny Doon beach is
beautiful at night.  Coming over the ridge, the music from Jon's set was great
and the visuals were AWESOME.  The combo of the rotating light, cliff face
projection, laser, bonfires and white lights was incredible.  Plus there were
more than 100 people there early in the evening (well, it had only been
morning for 30 mins. or so :-)  The bus arrived right after our car and 
started off to the SC map point.  (I apologise to all of you who had to wait 
extra long there, we really had no way to get the bus there faster.)

	I had such a great time there that I can't really isolate the best 
parts (truly a legendary party, as Chris said).  One thing that was really neat was when the generator ran out of gas, someone started playing a bongo drum
and people kept dancing, and when the DJ got power back he mixed in with the 
drum beat.  The crowd was really into it all night.  There was some isolated
beer drinking and such, but I never saw any problems and all the people I ran 
into were very cool and friendly.  The DJ's were great, Carlos especially, and 
I was happy to get to see alot of the SFR people I hadn't met yet.  We've GOT
to do another one of these.

	Well, gotta go.  Hello again to everyone I saw there!

-Howard

Subject: Connection: Waarf's view


Wow, when I agreed to do security for Brian I expected a long night and
an inevitable confrontation with the Police but I didn't expect the ultimate
outcome.  I have been a bouncer in the past.  I  used to be bouncer/doorman
in this dive of a    club called the Cantab lounge in Cambridge Massachusetts.
(some of you MIT/Harvard type might remember this place) There use to be an
R & B/Soul band (Hot stuff like James plays) upstairs and a small, sweaty,
wild "disco" downstairs.  Now this part of Cambridge is racially mixed and
has been so since World War II, but the Cantab on a Saturday night was still
a rough place (at least on the surface) anyway. Throughout my career there,
I never had to beat-up or even shove anyone.  The worst it ever got was 
loud intimidating shouts or putting my chest in their face.  But I did learn
that security is about having people feel secure, not about fighting or
confrontation or even intimidation.  Having talked to may share of police
in my day both off duty and on, I know that, except for the occasional NAZI,
they are like everybody else, they don't want hassles with their jobs or
things occurring that they are going to have to take the heat for.  They also
have procedures that they follow, and surprisingly enough, they are more
afraid of us, then you think.  I knew that eventually we would have to deal
the law and our only hope was to try to get as many people "on site" before
the eventual confrontation occurred.  Basically they are reluctant to break
up a party with a large number of people, 2 or 5 or 10 cops won't take on
a crowd of 200 or 300 people, they'll need to call in backup which would
mostlikely be agencies from neighboring counties and the state or highway
patrol.  This is a major and expensive escalation which the locals have to
pay for, not to mention that the local law enforcement sorta looses face.
(it's a dick thang :) So  our only hope was undetection until the party
was in full swing but if anything can go wrong it will.  Bill and I worked
the parking lot from 10:20 on, we told people not to park there, and if they
did, they could/would be towed.  As long as we kept this parking lot clear
the police would not see any abnormality.  Eventually, people discovered
Bonny Dune Road and began to park there.  We tried to discourage this
but to no avail.  I took a quick hike  up the road and surprisingly, only a 
couple of dunces parked illegally or in such a way that towing was inevitable.
But still the large number of cars would have been a dead giveaway that
something was up, but what could we do?  We sent most people to the MapPoint and
as far as I know, most people went.  About midnight we saw a painted school bus
approach from the south, we tried to flag it down but it kept going.  We
thought, "Boy this driver is dumb", but when it didn't return I began to wonder
what was going on.  A young couple came up from the beach, they were
leaving early, she was an EMT, I tried to convince her to stay cuz we would
feel safer with someone like her arounda, but she was just getting off of a 12
hour shift and was going home.  I told he  I was surprised that the police
hadn't  shown up yet.  She said "You'd be surprised if I told you how many
police are already here."  I told her I figured as much but that we had nothing
to hide, we just want to dance all night that's all.  Her boyfriend pulled
up and they split.  I had the distinct feeling that we had just been checked
out.  Did we pass? Only time would tell. Around 1:30  I started to get reports
that the MapPoint was getting pretty full and that the police were there.
No one knew where the 1st bus had gone with it's passengers and we had to do
something about all of those people at the MapPoint.  I was just thinking how
was I going to fit 200 people in my CRX when the floppy  bus arrived from the 
north.  M Normal jumps out and tells the story of how the first bus broke
down and they called the police.  I figured that I'd better ride down to the 
MapPoint to make sure that the busses were loaded in an orderly manner.
When we got there I said to myself "Oh shit!" there were about 200 ravers
and about 6 cruisers and 10 or more police.  Now I myself am very distrustful
of police, from the time I was little it was something that was etched into my
synapses (ask any black man from the ghetto), coupled with this feara, was the
desire to keep this thing calm and to protect the ravers.  So I got out 
and told everybody to get on the bus.  I then realized that this was the
confrontation that we were waiting for,  I had expected it to happen out at
Bonny Dune but here it was in my face with no one around but me.  (Brian
was at Bonny Dune and I didn't know where the people running the MapPoint
were)  As I walked around a little I was basically waiting for the cops to
approach me.  then I looked back to see this burly guy with SHERIFF in yellow
letters on his blue jacket hassling the bus driver.  I went to get on the bus,
 a raver told me "Be cool, dude there's a sheriff on tha bus man"  I said
I know, I'm going to talk to him.  I tapped him on the shoulder and said
"Excuse me officer, it's there something wrong?" I felt like a lamb to the
slaughter.  He motions me outside and says "The Sheriff wants to talk
to you".  I can't explain what happened next because I sorta went into an
altered state, even though I was COMPLETELY sober and had taken great care
to not have any contraband on my person or in my vehicle.  I guess I could
say that I answered his questions honestly and truthfully without divulging
information that was not asked for.  I told him we had officially unofficially
tried to notify his office buy calling and posing a hypothetical situation.
I told him that we had security, that we, as a group, did not drink and were
discouraging others from bringing alcohol (I didn't tell him we were a bunch
of tweakers :) I told him that we had people on the cliffs to prevent people
from falling (I stretched the truth a little, were they still there?) Meanwhile
he's getting reports like "there are about 200 people on the beach".
I smiled inwardly cause I knew we had at least reached critical mass,  by
the book, it would be hard to shut us down by rousing us, either they would
try to cut off the head (my head?) or they would have to let us go or...
He say what is your name and I tell him.  He says just a minute Geoff and
goes back to his command car.  I'm shitting bricks, with images of me being
carried away in hand cuffs.  I'm then keenly aware of how ridiculous I must look
with a golden African floopy hat, a bunch of "rave" beads, a leather jacket,
and black Spandex tights. I'm watching the other cops standing around looking
at me with that "hungry dog" look that police have when they think they  might
have to make an arrest.  Just then, the promoter for Messiah steps to me
and says that if we get shut down here, we can move it to his space in Fremont.
I ask him really, are you sure? We don't have any money. He says go for it.
I think to myself, this is what the scene is really about, ravers should be
helping and supporting each other.  I don't remember his name but if you know
him tell him  that I was very grateful that he "had  my back" so to speak.
The Sheriff comes back and says that He's decided to let us have our party
and that I seemed like I was a responsible  man and he liked the fact that
I told him the truth.  I said thank you and told him he was welcome to  come
down and join us and that we would leave the beach cleaner then we found it.
A lot more went down then what I described here but as I said, I'm not 
exactly sure what I said or what   he said, but the basic result was good.
We ferried the people back to the spot only to find the highway patrol
waiting for the bus at the other end.  The Highway Patrol guy was one of
the NAZI types of police that I had mentioned before.  He was trying to break
it up.  I got out and said my usual opening line "Officer, is there something
wrong?"  He says you have to stop this right now, I say 1st I'm not in charge
and second the Sheriff says it's OK. He says really arrogantly "Your lying.
I don't believe you!"  I kinda chuckle cuz this time I have God (the Sheriff)
on my side :) and tell him 1st I don't have to lie to you and second I just 
came from Santa Cruz with this bus load of people that  the sheriff allowed to
take off and third why don't you get on your radio and ask.  He asked me what
my name was and I told him (Is this a ploy to see how afraid you are of them
knowing  you?).  He starting to get really pissed cuz he seems to be losing
control but this is not his jurisdiction, I  know that, he knows that, but
I don't say anything.  He saysa, " I"m calling a tow truck right now and having
all  of these cars in the parking lot towed."   I told him that these
were not  our cars and we had told people not to park there so go right ahead.
(the parking lot is their jurisdiction)  Then it seems he got a call about
some real crime happening some where cuz he jumped  in his car and took of.
We sent the bus back down to get more  people, I went and got my car  from
Bonny Dune Road feeling that it would be safer else where and I also wanted to 
"escort" the bus back up the second time around in case the highway patrol
decided to stop it in the middle of nowhere. When the second bus arrived,
the Blue Meanies had disappeared, something told me the worst was over.  All
that we had to  do now was survive the night without any casualties. (which
I think we did)  The next critical time would be in the morning when all of
the people had gone but the organizers are left to clean up.  If he wanted
to cite us for breaking any county ordinances, it would be then.  Around
3:30, after my car was safely parked at Santa Cruz, and all of the people
were  down the hill and raving, I went to Brian and relinquished my post
as "Security Officer".  It was  time for me to have some fun.

This is just some of my feelings about what  happened on Bonny Dune that night
I'm sure others have some insights that would be very valuable.  I learned
a lot about human nature, reality, cops, and myself, that nighta. I got a real
sense of what kind of community the rave scene can really evolve into.

I want to end this by acknowledging Brian for the fantastic job that he did.
I want to also let everyone know (cuz Brian is too generous to tell you)
That he lost about $500 (not to mention his $400 laser) so I am encouraging
all of us who are in a financial position to do so, to contribute.
I'll start with $50  which is what I spend at a good rave for admission and
"assist".  And I would encourage those of  you who can, to do what  you can.
Every little bit will help.

People seemed to have had a really good time and I'm sure we impressed some of
the  promoters who were  there.  If we had another, we could definitely
make a profit  but I  don't think I have the stomach for a profit making
illegal  rave.
Maybe a legal space "private party" type rave should be our next thing,
we could team up with some other promoter.  What do you all think?

Brilliant.  I feel guilty I didn't try and talk all of my
friends into going.  They'd never forgive me if they knew
what they'd missed, so luckilly they don't. 

I liked dancing on the sand, myself, but then I also liked
dancing on the rock, particularly on the edge of a ten foot
cliff overlooking the turntables while Carlos was spinning.

(As I came trooping down Bonny Doon road, there was this
funny little guy that was talking with everyone, yelling
things at the moon, and like that.  I was talking to him for
a while.  Didn't find out who he was until I got to the
bottom and met Brian again.  Anyway, Carlos review was "This
is like the first full moon rave I was at.")

I guess I missed Jon's set while I was manning a flash
light, directing people over the hill... but at least I got
to hear a dry run on tape last week.

Anyway, I just wanted to say that after I drove Marlo and
Craig (the man on the lightshow) back to Santa Cruz (we
grabbed dounuts and hung out at Craig's place, listening to
him babble about videophone technology, the first toontown,
and various other topics) I went back to Boonydoon and
crashed in the sun for a few hours.  That was around noon:
when I got back to my car, I found that all of the bags of
trash we'd left stacked up by the side of the road had
already been picked up.  I hope someone appreciates the
mass quantites of other peoples trash we picked up. 

And it seems most people liked the SFR t-shirt I made... 
more about that later...

Hey you ravers, that was a fun time thursday...friday...whatever...
When I showed up around 6 I expected to see a few more folks, but the
only vehicles I could guess were ravers were brian's 4Wd and the
cavalier filled with scrap wood. Brian's mostly from the stuff in it.

My hope was to help clean up the beach before hand and to help schlepp
things down...then mebby listen to some music and enjoy the beauty of
the site before I had to return to the world'o'work.
Having had many evenings there myself I was worried about someone
accidently cutting themselves on the glass, or slipping on some rocks
down at the control tower. Actually it wasn't all that bad...

After schlepping for an hour or so I decided it was time to rake up
around where someone (hey, wat was your name again?) was setting up a
big bonfire. I could rake glass where people would be distracted by
the flamedance...seemed like a good idea! Additionally, the sun was
getting ready to set, and with the clarity of the air I knew to expect
a beautiful evening. I raked out a radial circle while watching gulls
and peilcans walk in the air...it was very peaceful...it was also
while there was some consternation about the locatio of the "sound
guys"...but that passed.

Another hour or so passed, the sun was going down, so I decided to go
take my bags of trash and get some dinner. I left some toilet paper
and garbage bags at the control tower and climbed up the hill. When I
turned around at the top I could see that someone had lit the fire,
and the sun was just glowing out.

I went up to Davenport, to the "Cash Store". A great place to eat;
they have wonderful bread. I hung out, read Byte (wotta nerd) and
listened to two guitar players work out tocatta's. A peaceful meal and
then outside. I left my car there and hiked back down to the beach,
along the cliff face.

It was eerie and wonderful, to hear the surf combine with the pulse,
and to see the falling stars dissipate with the lights shining up from
the beach...to hear the oompah-loompha song...

anyway I got to where you _should_ hike down, but saw some folks
trying to get down a part that was treacherous...so I interdicted and
sent them down to the good part, where LA-Brian and squad were hanging
out. I think that's when I realized that no-one was hanging out making
sure that we had no cliff-divers. so I knew my place in the rave
universe at that point.
So I hung out and listned, did little dances, and watched bill shoo
people down to where they could pay...anyone who got past bill I
shooed down to LA-Brian. I was really suprised at how co-operative
everyone was, and how easily they just listend to some hairy grog
hanging out telling them to hike down to where it was safer...tres
cool. 

and that's it. I spilt after a while, hiked back to Davenport...where
midway I spotted a Big Bus with Lights all over...parked along the
road and with people hanging out trying to find the rave! SO I yelled
out at them: HEY! the rave is about a half-mile up the road!
They were pretty suprised that someone was out in the pitchblack
artichoke field giving directions, but we talked at bit more and off
they went. provedince.

brian-truck-owner, drop me a line with your snailmail address; a fund
is in order and I'ld like to send along some dead presidents.

Subject: My shoes stil have sand in them


	Hi all.  If my speech and grammar sound a bit out of whack, please
excuse me... I have had very little sleep in the past couple of days, I
had to move out of my apartment and into the dorms yesterday, and I've
come down with a bad cold.  But other than that I feel GREAT!

	Man, it was incredible to walk down about 4:30, the cops and buses
having been squared away, to see hundreds of people all having a great time,
to see Carlos banging away at some great tunes, to see people sitting around
campfires and enjoying themselves... and thinking, this was _our_ doing, 
_our_ creation.  We were actually pulling it off. Incredible.

	There are so many things to say and people to thank.  I think rave
medal #1 should go to Geoff White, who convinced the cops that what was
going on was legit, had to put up with me not being able to find security
people to replace hium so he could go dance, and overall made sure that
the "front-end" (parking + cops, etc.) went successfully.  If this were a
for-profit event, the promoters would have owed Geoff their lives.  Geoff,
I am sorry I put so much pressure on you, though.  Next time (uh-oh, here
we begin the "next-time" thread) we'll hire people, people paid to do that
job and do it well.  Also, thanx to Doc Benzene and the other people who
helped with the "front-end".

	Second award goes to the people who ran the map point.  The buses
caused the incredible crunch, and I'm sure you were in a real pressure
cooker.  Thank you for the long, hard work.  

	Third, many thanx to the people who watched over the sound system,
made sure the DJ's had what they needed, etc.  It was VERY cool when the
4kW generator went out, and the backup was started very soon after.  I
wasn't around, but I understand the cops came up and made an announcement
on the loudspeaker about parking on Bonny Doon; thanx for handling that
with grace.

	Fourth, thanx to Craig, the guy who practically ran the lighting
setup all night, who made sure the videos were always going, etc.  He was one
of the original Toon Town producers and said this rave was as good as
anything they'd ever thrown, and wanted to help. He didn't leave the station
until 7 or so in the morning!

	Fifth, thanx to everyone who brought wood and food and extension 
cords and everything we needed - everyone came though, we had TONS of water,
lots of small bonfires (including one on the top of the control-tower rock).
Randy Bias, Paul Thomas, Bryan Campbell, Mykl, Jonathan, Ed-with-the-firewood, 
and everyone else whose names I'm forgetting because I'm a dufus, take a bow.

	Sixth, thanx to the providers of the sound system: I know they're not
on the list, but a few people here know them.  The sound was much louder
and cleaner than I had thought it would be - absolutely stunning.  And for
free!! Incredible.

	Seventh, thanx to Bob Jesse for making the rental of the incredible
video projector possible.

	Eighth, thanx to the people who took the bus down from SF - it was a
gutwrenching experience, and I hope someone'll post about it. :)


	I really could go on and on... people came from all over, sfravers and
non-sfravers alike, to help with the effort, and it worked.

	Here's the DJ lineup, for those who didn't know faces:

	11-1 - Edan Cassidy (El Dorado)
	1-2 - God's Personal DJ, who played a truely god-like set (including
		his own twelve inch, both sides, twice)
	2-3:30 - Dutch
	3:30-5:30 - Carlos - incredible as usual. he loved the party... when
		the generator stopped, he was the first one up there to check
		it out....
	5:30-7:30 - Moonpup - He was really good, very friendly, and perfect
		for when the sun came up...
	7:30-9 - Drew - I had my doubts, but he worked out pretty well.


	Okay, now for the grim statistics.  I figure about 300-350 people 
showed up (about 200 more would have gone if the bus situation had been what
it should have been.) 

	Total contributions:

		$735

	Total costs:

		$520 deposit for the buses. 
		$225 as a remainder payment on the bus that actually made it
		$135 for the video projector
		 $35 for the sound guys - they asked if they should rent a 
			generator just for the sound system, I said sure - 
			turns out the one I had just for lighting worked for
			both lighting and sound, but I still felt they 
			shouldn't have to absorb that cost, especially when 
			everything else is free.


		----

		$-180.


	Now, I don't mind accepting a loss like that once every couple of 
months if the parties themselves could be that great all the time - but
I do feel really bad about not being able to pay the DJ's anything.  That's
not too relevant, since I've talked to all the DJ's since last night and
they all loved doing it so much they didn't care about the pay, so it's not
too much of a problem.  I just feel they should have been compensated for
their brilliant work...


	As for the bus that was a disaster:  Albion Explorer, the company that
runs the bus that failed and coordinated the deal with me, will not refuse
the initial deposit for the bus.  I mean, I guess that's one definition of
the word "deposit", but still they provided really CRAPPY service, whereas
the Mexican Bus co, who were subcontracted by the Albion people (and 
subsequently jacked by them too) were very nice and worked great.  Obviously,
getting back the bus deposit would mean breaking even ($245 deposit for the
failed bus).  If anyone out there has sufficient law experience and could let
us know what could be done, I would consider taking it to small claimns 
court.  


	I did suffer a larger financial and personal loss when, as Geoff
mentioned, my laser was stolen.  It was a red beam, 10mw in an orange 
plastic hard shell about 18 inches long by about 2 inches high and wide.
It cost me about $400 used.  If you could pass the word around about its
absence I would appreciate it.  I take a large part of the blame, since
I left it running on top of the same rock as the helicopter light, operating
with Gregg's terrific mirror-and-speaker deal, with no one to watch over it
and make sur it wasn't lifted, so I was careless.  But oh well.  As long as
people know it was taken and are on the lookout for it, I can't do much more.


	If you do want to help defray my loss, my new address and phone # is:

	2601 Warring St. #364
	Berkeley, CA 94720
	510-643-3496

	If we end up getting the bus deposit back, I'll save the extra money
for the "next time" - same thing with the laser, if you feel like helping me
that'd be great, but if it turns up I'll put that money towards our further
adventures... also, if you didn't help set up or tear down or otherwise help,
this might be your way to show you liked it, since many people put in 
HOURS of hard work for this event while others got to enjoy it for
free.....

	
	As for the inevitable thread of "should-haves" that will follow:

Police situation:  I knew tthis was going to happen, and since permits for the
 site don't exist, there was really no way of conducting this without hoping
 they would understand where we were coming from (which it appears they did).

Buses:  I think we should have scrapped the SF run altogether - the thought
 was good, to have this so that people can dose or dance or whatever and not
 worry about driving home.  But in the end only a few people signed up, most
 of those sfravers. (Thanx M for the tickets!)  It probably would have been
 better just to have local SC-based buses doing the transporting.

What else went wrong?  We were short of manpower in the morning, leaving a few
 of us to make a large number of trips over the sand... the fact that the
 setup was so far from the road was bad, yes, but in retrospect it _really_
 ensured that our stuff wouldn't get confiscated, huh? :)



	I'm too tired to even begin to talk about "next time", only that,
I can probably only handle that level of stress about once every 3 or 4
months, we'd probably have to find a new place, it's going to be very hard to
top ourselves, and with school starting I'm not sure how much energy I
will have... but I want to do it, and like I said before losing an amount
like $200 doesn't faze me.  I will have to get a job soon since the capital's
wearing down a bit thin (let me put it this way - had no one given money
I would have had to go to the bookstore to do my homework every day).  But
The reward was so high that it's absolutely worth it.  

	Besides, the popular opinion of the event was so great I bet we could 
hold one in the same place, same time of the week, and do the same amount
of limited flyering, and get 3 times as many people.  As long as parking is
handled...


	Okay, I'm gonna go grab some dinner.  G'night!

p.s. - the 415 number is going away, but I'm keeping the 510 number, at least
for now... howbout making it the official sfraves hotline?

I totally agree.  Gunther and I were pretty worried with the way the things 
turned out at the SF map point.  What we came up with was that the best idea 
the future was to get 4 or 5 people to rent mini-vans.  That would totaally
take care of the transpo problem, and also cost less than the damn busses.
I'm still pissed at Brian having to pay the deposit on the bus that broke
down.  It's lucky that anyone on that bus made it to bonny doon at all.
With our own mini-vans, this wouldn't have happened.

Also, better communications would have helped.  I had no idea how to contact 
the SC map point to tell them what was up in SF.

One more thing - I was so busy worrying about the buses and cops and making sure
everyone was doing what they had to that I didn't get to see a lot of what went
on.  There are x number of sfravers who went, and x different perspectives on
what happened.  If you have the time, I'd appreciate it if you could write to
me telling me about what you saw happen, your perspectives, etc;  you can send
it to the list, or to me personally.  I'll be compiling a big file on what 
happened and post it later on - please tell me if you _don't_ want me to include
something you tell me in this.

Subject: rumor of GG Park Rave // Connection Lost & Found


(1) I heard a rumor that there will be a rave at Golden Gate Park tomorrow
(sunday) at 25th and Fulton. Confirmations?

(2) Connection was great! Thanks Brian. I thought I was in for a bad
time when the cops at the map point told me not to park there, and
that there won't be any party, any busses, etc. Disbelieving, I then
tried to park on Bonny Doon road and the cops told me they'd tow me
even though I was off the road and legally parked (same story -- "go
home, there's no party here..."). Finally, I parked on a residential
street in Davenport and walked the mile to the rave site... 

(3) Someone stole my redish-orange large-sized internal-frame back
pack (label on it says "Milliard, Chamonix France") with various
goodies inside (Vuarnets, spare contact lenses, etc). If anybody found
this backpack please return it to me.  My friend's flashlight and
cooler were also stolen from the same location. 

I'm not expecting much... I have a feeling it was stolen by these
creeps that were throwing/breaking glass bottles against the rocks --
bet they didn't take kindly to me telling them off about their
actions. 

(4) A friend o mine forgot a blanket near one of the fires on the
beach. It was white with dark crosshatching. If anybody picked this
up, please send me mail. 

Thanks....

Yeah, definitely.  In this case I think that a couple of minivans doing the run
would have worked better since only a minimal number of people would be coming
from SF.  Let's face it, most people are going to choose to drive a longer
distance than bus it.

Yeah, but I don't think we will ever get enough people from SF to make it
bus worthwhile, but we could definitely fill a minivan or two just with
SFravers from SF and Berzerkely.

> Also, better communications would have helped.  I had no idea how to contact 
> the SC map point to tell them what was up in SF.
Definitely.  Also, I think we should have had a map point at Davenport since
anyone who drives from SF will take Hwy 1 (at least, I would).  This would tend
to catch most of the people who would donate, and those who won't there is no
point in trying to catch since sneaking onto a beach is rather easy.

I think that by reducing our expenses we could keep the next one donation only
and still manage to come out ahead.  What were the most expensive things and
how can we reduce the cost?

> Next time, next time...   :-)
Definitely.  Sore as I am, I loved every minute of it.  Even setting it up
and breaking it down.

i got to connection early in the evening, helped the sound guys lug

only to get really cold soon after that...  it was damp.  i was
getting anxious about my debut.  i got bumped an hour later and i
panicked because i thought some people who were really looking forward

  From the number of rave promoter wannabe's hungrily eyeing
our Bonny Doon site, I have the sinking feeling that it's
going to end up the target of many raves in the near future,
probably so many that sheriffs are going to shut down
*anything* they see there at night.  
  You gotta admit that it was an ideal outdoor site, except
for the cold.  
  Lest anyone get the wrong idea, Santa Cruz PD are mostly
nice guys.  The county deputies are another matter.  By their
standards, they were being really tolerant (and I include the
fat idiot who kept telling me where to stand).

 The music was not not loud, but just right close to speakers where

we still needed the buses for the shuttling, but I should have just had them

The buses were by far the most expensive thing, fully 83% of the budget.  Had
both buses been working, we definitely would have come out ahead.  There really
isn't any way to hold an event as large as that at Bonny Doon without having 
the buses - it was the parking on Bonny Doon road that bent the cops so out of
shape.  If we can find another free location with adequate parking near the 
site, we'd come out completely ahead.

Subject: Deep Space - Raving on a mountaintop

I thought you sfravers would like to know how my little junket went.  Here's
the review I posted to alt.raves:

"Hey Pete, wouldn't it be great if a UFO flew over and everyone at the rave
saw it?"

$30 for a generator, $80 for our sound.  $110 wasn't too big of a risk to
throw on an outdoor rave, but I decided to call for donations anyway.  My
partner John had gone out of town and I came up with the idea earlier in the
week.  It was too late to mail to the mailing list, so I made up flyers for
"Deep Space" and distributed to the ravers I knew in the clubs on Thursday and
Friday, plus giving them to people who seemed to be dancing harder than the
rest.

Saturday rolled and around and the clouds rolled in.  It had been raining on
and off all day.  It finally broke and I went and picked up the equipment.
Then it clouded over again.  People were calling me asking if it had been
cancelled.  I would cross my fingers and tell them that it was still on.  At
6:00 I changed the voice-mail message to give instructions on how to get to
the mountain-top.  I also said to bring a sweater and a raincoat, just in
case.

At 9:30, my friend Dan, and a reporter from a local newspaper took off for the
mountains.  The reporter had spent the entire day with me asking questions
about raves and taping my music.  He'd been to our raves before, but this was
quite different in the amount of preparation I needed to do.  All that really
needed to be done was to setup the sound equipment and go for it.  I didn't
rent any lights, in anticipation of the natural beauty of the location.  Dan
and I arrived first.  There was a camper bus parked right there, with the top
lifted up for camping.  I felt miserable about booting them, but what else
could be done?  If we didn't ask them nicely now, they'd be hassled all night
even if we did move to another spot.  Dan lied rather nicely about how we
thought there was a "no camping" restriction, so we didn't think there would
be a problem.  They eventually left.

At 11:00 everything was setup.  I had rented a 4000 watt generator, but found
that it STILL wasn't enough power to fully blow my bass bins.  They would cut
out if I had the gain too high.  It didn't sound bad, just like a louder
version of a stereo, but you couldn't FEEL the bass like you could at our
previous raves.  People kept telling me that it sounded OK, but I felt like I
would have rather had the earth shaking up there.  The ambient music went over
well.  I got a lot of compliments and "what is this?" type of questions.  I
sold all the remaining glow toys from our previous rave, and wished I had
more.  They looked absolutely fabulous in the dark of the night.  One guy told
me that he had thought a party of aliens had landed when he drove up to the
spot.

It sprinkled a bit earlier in the night.  Then the sky cleared.  It was
stunning.  The lights from the city glowed behind the mountaintops in the haze
while a zillion stars looked down upon us.  Several times I would just stare
at the sky in amazement.  Our lighting technician had done well.

At 1:00 AM, it happened.  I was fiddling with the decks when the newspaper's
photographer came and shook me on the shoulder.  He pointed at the opposite
hillside.  What the hell was it?  For all accounts, it looked like a glowing
stick figure dancing to the music.  Maybe the music was loud enough, and
passing alien stopped in to do some dancing?  Everyone on the ground had
stopped dancing and was staring up at the hillside in fascination.  The figure
didn't seem to notice, it just kept moving, sparkling, and flowing to the
music.  Eventually it started to work its way towards us.  Ahhh!  A man after
all, but completely decked out in multicolored Christmas lights.  He was a 35
year old waiter who's friend had told him about the rave.  He'd never heard of
anything like it, but thought "it sounded pretty psychedelic" so he dressed up
in lights.  Needless to say, this was quite an effect for the evening.

At about 2:00 AM people started to cut-out.  Even the reporter left,
disappointed that it hadn't gone further.  Dan told me to start playing some
really ambient stuff to get people leave.  I threw on Orb's Peel Sessions.
Five minutes later, a stream of cars came up the canyon.  About 50 more people
suddenly arrived.  The clubs had just gotten out.

So we went until 4:00 AM.  A cold front moved in and the temperature dropped
to about 40 degrees.  It was COLD!  I immediately decided to shut it down,
before it got any worse.  Nobody complained.

Again, all night long, no hassles from the police.  I felt for SURE that
something would happen this time, but it never did.  Someone told me later
that one had driven by, but didn't bother to stop.  Apparently we were right
next to the road, but not that visible.  I had told people to arrive early
because we'd probably be shutdown by 1:00, but again, no problems.  Is Utah
really the rave mecca?

I received $30 in donations.  I didn't feel bad because of the great
experience that was had by all.  I would have easily spent $50 for the
surprise of seeing that guy dancing on the hillside dressed in lights.  People
were so nice and friendly all night long.  Someone loaned me his sweater, a
girl brought me some handwarmers, a call for a flashlight after my desklight
burned out got me one in two minutes, I met several new people, and even one
guy told me that he had several warehouses for us to use.  All in all, it was
a success, one that I wish I could do again this summer, but it has already
started to get too cold.  Maybe an autumn deep forest rave will be in order in
October.

Hrm... There needs to be another map point on the other side of Bonny Doon up
hwy 1.  Maybe just a roadside setup on a shoulder or something?  Maybe some of

Definitely.  Sigh.  We need to find a millionare who wants to fund these

Ah, that explains it.  I went by "The Global Village Message

and was surprised to hear that the ambient chill thing was
last weekend only.  I thought I'd scrambled the date
somehow.  

I also did the ritual "wander through Mark's Meadow in the

Subject: SFR T-shirts


Okay, so there seems to be some demand out there for SFR
T-shirts, and I've beaten the silk screen crowd to the punch
with my low-tech methods (cardboard stencil and spray
paint).  The trouble is that I don't want to go into the
T-shirt business.  However, I'll consider getting into the
shirt-painting business.  You give me a shirt (or
something), I'll put the logo on it, and give it back to
you.  That way, everyone's stuff will look different.

To start with, I'm going to set the price a bit high, at $4... 
this is partly to pay for some set-up hassles I'm going to 
have to go through.  If there's a lot of demand, I'll drop
it to $3 or so, later. 

There's no text on my stencil (partly because it would be
hard to do, but partly because I hate text on shirts): I
used the "new" SFR symbol that Brian designed (it's on the
GIF you can download from Soda).  The three letters "SFR" are
pushed together and mutated slightly to get a symmetric
symbol, something like a cross in a womb.

Speaking of low tech methods, here's an ASCII picture of it:


                   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

                                 *

                                 
Right now, there's just one size stencil, kind of large at
around 8 by 9 inches.  As for color, I'd recommend black
paint on whatever, that way you'll get what you expect.
Some other color may wind up blending with the color of the
shirt... Of course, the "florescent" red I used on my
black shirt came out a deep orange/red that doesn't look so
bad, so it's not always a big problem.  

So any takers? 

-- Joe B. 

(If you'd rather do this yourself, be my guest.  The
following are the details of my technique, so skip this
stuff if you don't care: I used corrugated cardboard this
time, because I've found that poster board tended to warp as
the paint dried on one side.  The stiffer the better,
because that's going to translate into sharper lines when
you try and press the stencil down onto the shirt (I pile
bricks on the edges).  I did a little drafting to lay out
the logo the way I wanted it, then glued it down on the
cardboard, and hacked through it with a razor blade to cut
it out.  If I reuse this stencil a lot, I think I'm going to
buy some balsa wood strips and glue them down on one side to
help stiffen it up.  You want to use a *large* sheet of
cardboard, to cover the whole shirt, so you don't have
over-spray problems... which makes it a problem to orient
the stencil on the shirt: my solution is arrange the
"positive" I cut out of the cardboard to get an idea of
where the logo will look good, then use some chalk to mark
the position, then remove the positive, and position the
"negative" stencil so that it just hides the chalk marks.
Don't forget to put some newspaper inside the shirt,
especially if it's thin, to keep the paint from bleeding
through to the back.  Be careful about saturating the
stencil with paint, because it's going to try and drip where
you don't want it when you pick it up.  Oh, and choosing the
right spray paint is absolutely crucial: I tried some
FabSpray Fabric Color stuff recently that I know works well
on vinyl, but it's useless on cotton.  Good old Krylon flat
black is really good, probably because of the "high solids
content".  Once, I tried some gold-flake spray paint, but it
turns out that whatever solvent is in it leached out into
the cotton and left a huge sloppy dark stain around the
not-very-gold pattern.  I haven't tried the
"environmentally-safe" water based stuff yet, but I've got a
feeling it won't work very well.  Water takes too long to
dry, for one thing.)

Actually we did this with the lamp too.  That's how it broke.  I didn't have
any lights at all, it looked great under the stars with the glow toys.  We
also parked the cars around the center and turned on hazard lights and turn
signals for a groovy effect.  People would strobe their headlights too.

There is no doubt that we all want to contribute, so why don't u figure out
the exact amount u lost for the rave (after the bus deal is cleared), then
add the $400 for the laser and then we just divide it by the number of people 
on the list (less the one just getting the calendar and the one not living
in Bay Area); may be we add a couple of bucks for each person because
unfortunately someone won't send the money and if we are lucky u'll get 
all the money back.

For example if the worst case is $580 divided by 100 (I'm sure there
are more people willing to pay) we have to pay ~ $6. If Brian receives
more money I'm sure we can use them for the next one.

How do we send money?? I think the easiest way is by mail.

If someone has a better idea just speak up.

This is a really good idea because with all the BULLSHIT going on with 
some raves (read Sharon and the fight at Jama rave) we need an efficient
way to get reliable information on what's happening on a particular night
(latest news about a particular rave, raves that get busted ....)

much to work right, so you can imagine my excitement!

It would be too much for me to try to describe all that happened to me
in one simple message.

This thing was definately the best out door event I have ever gone to.
The location and implementation were stunningly good. My worst fears
weren't realized, as the crowd was quite large; although only half the
intended size ... I remember thinking that this event both proves that
our logistics were really good, and proves that we have lots to work on
our logistics. (How can it be better?  Excellent with lots of room for
improvement!)

The Bus Trip [or Amazingly Good Cop Karma]


We showed up at the corner of 4th and Townsend a bit before 10. Howard
was there with the tickets, and a few other people were standing
around as well.  We hung out and talked for a while, then just as it
was almost time to go, this glowing UFO of a bus with beautiful
multicoloerd running lights, all kinds of decorations and vivid paint
pulled up.  "WE wanna ride on THAT bus!" we all exclaimed at once.
Well, rules are rules, and we all climbed onto the other bus rather
than wait an hour for the cool Mexican bus.  Heh, heh.  Anyway, we
were underway, everyone hanging out in the back and having a swell
time talking, or trying to talk over Gloria Estefan on the bus stereo.
Suddenly there were all these noises, ending with a loud one and the
bus rolling to a stop beside the road.  Uh-oh.  We all look at our
watches and it's about 10:30.  The driver is having a fit, repeating
the only 3 swear-words he knows over and over.  He and his friend
stomp off the bus and open the engine cover in the rear.  Smoke.
Uh-oh.  We can tell right away that this bus isn't going to make it to
Santa Cruz.  Worse yet, we realize we're on Highway 1, not 280, even
though the directions were to take 280 so a load of people could be
picked up at the map point.  "What do you mean, 280? This is how you
get to Santa Cruz!" sez the bus driver.  We say nothing, and look
toward the mountains, still ahead.  We're stopped by a little cafe,
closed, but with a payphone out in front. We all try to figure out how
to get word back to SF so the other bus will look for us.  Nope, no CB
on this bus.  Nobody has friends who could pop by 4th and Townsend
with a message.  Hmmm.  We ask the bus driver if _he_ knows anyone in
SF who'd run a message to the map point, and he gets pretty pissed
off.  "I'm trying to get my bus fixed!" he screams at us.  "Well WE'RE
trying to get to Santa Cruz and we've paid you to get us there and it
isnt happening."  "I don't CARE."  "Well, you SHOULD care, we're the
customers and we've already paid!"  He stamps off and calls someone,
not to help us out, but to complain.  "Yeah, and they're saying
they're the customers and all that shit..."  We all put our heads
together and try to figure something out.  We doubt the other bus will
be foolish enough to take Highway 1, and we certainly have no faith in
the angry driver.  Heather keeps saying "I have a bad feeling."  One
guy borrows a pocketknife, starts cutting up a cardboard box, and
looking for a marker to make signs. Robert Jesse says, "this is kind
of crazy, but maybe the cops could help us..." We're ready to try
anything.  Chris calls information and dials up the [non-emergency]

it closes at 2am.  It has a bar, and people drink, but somehow the
attitude is fairly low-level.  For those who don't know, the Bahia
is a nice space, well lit, open layout, and clean (rather than the
grime and smell I expect whenever I go to DNA).  Bones DJd tonight,
playing well enough for me to forget who the DJ is (usually, I only
remember who a DJ is if they're bad, or really really good) while
getting into the dancing.  It was slightly mixed (with a few queers
making me feel quite comfortable being there).  The $3 entry fee
is well worth it.  The age group seems predominately early 20s, but
then I can be blind too.  They had chips and dip tonight.  They open
something like 9pm.


Also, the Detour has really good techno music.  Problem is, it's
a dark somewhat slimy harsh oppressive setting, filled with
people who are drinking and smoking, and worst of all dancing isn't
allowed (unless dancing is a part of you whereever you exist, which
it is for some people who are there.)  This gay male bar brings in
one of the most diverse crowds of people my age (early 20s) including
everything under the moon.  It's random how many of us come.  Also,
there are people all the way up the age range, with the people on
the top usually sort of just sitting around drinking (who knows
what for, I never see them talk to anyone, perhaps it's just me who
isn't interested or watching them).  I think early weekdays are best,
and the bar goes from afternoon sometime to 2AM (so you can go in
whenever you want).  I have mixed reactions to this place, but as
I'm into techno and gay and young this is someplace I've been
checking out recently.


Ok, so how is Mission Rock Resort going?

Subject: the Bus Trip [the rest of the story!!]

	[sorry!  my text processor screwed up my story!  I'd -love- feedback or corrections from y'all, by the way... -M]

	I hang on hold for about 15 minutes, terrified that I'll get
	cut off for lack of funds before they pick up my call. Finally they
	do, but the guy I talk to tells me "We're the police, not a messenger
	service."  True enough, but we're still stranded. Meantimes, the bus
	driver has poured two containers of transmission fluid into the bus
	and says he needs 8 or 10 more and then we'll be underway.  Trouble
	is, neither he nor his friend has _any_ cash. Well, none of us happen
	to feel like handing over any money to this guy, especially those of
	us who are on the list and _know_ how much Brian already gave him.
	Furthermore, none of us believe this bus would make it through the
	mountains and around the curves of Hwy 1, not with this guy at the
	wheel.  He can't believe we won't help him.  _We_ can't believe he
	won't help us - after all, he did contract to get us to Santa Cruz
	tonight, not to mention shuttling people from the map point.  Nope,
	the other bus is our only hope.  Or hitching, but we're still at least
	an hour out of Santa Cruz, and all the ravers are taking 280, as
	that's what it says to take on the directions.  The driver claims that
	the other bus is "for sure" going to take 1 also. He is becoming
	increasingly upset at our unwillingness to trust him and help him
	solve his problem.  Seems to us, though, that he should know what his
	bus needs, and be responsible for himself.  Anyway, Robert Jesse, not
	one to give up after only one try, dials 911.  Pacifica emergency
	dispatch connects him to SF emergency dispatch, and it must be a quiet
	night in SF, because they agree to go to 4th and Bryant and give
	Howard our message.  We're THRILLED, needless to say.  The bus driver
	comes up and tries to make a call on the payphone.  "Operator?" He
	hangs up rapidly, several times.  By this time it is around 10:55 and
	we're all tense, waiting.  It dawns on us all at once.  "Did I say
	Bryant?" "I don't know!" "I think I told him to say Bryant!"  "I'm
	_sure I said Bryant..."  The driver still hasn't connected.  "Can we
	make _one_ more call, please?" asks Robert.  "No, I'm using the
	phone!"  We try to explain, but the driver only gets madder and
	madder.  He screams right in Robert's face, his eyes bugging out.  He
	leans closer and closer and finally shoves Robert, who'd done nothing.
	"Stop it, stop it!" I say, to no avail. I'm afraid the driver will
	start punching any minute, he has huge, muscular arms.  "STOP IT." I
	step between Robert and the driver, get right in his face and stare up
	into his eyes.  "Tell _him_ to stop it" grumbles the driver but he
	steps back.  Robert is on the bus, then off again immediately, with
	his bag.  He dashes across the street and I wonder if he's upset
	enough to try for a ride back to town.  He comes back after a long
	moment.  He called the cops back and they sent out the corrected
	directions. We're relieved again.  It's almost 11 by this time though
	and we have no idea how long it will take the cops to deliver our
	message.  The payphone rings and Robert leaps for it. It's the SFPD,
	saying they didnt see anyone, where is it again?  We despair, as it is
	11:10 by now, but we tell them anyway and they say they'll try.  We've
	run out of ideas by this time, but the signs are done...  all we can
	do is wait.  Then the payphone rings again, and it's Howard
	saying,"you won't believe this, but..." and I scream in his ear, I'm
	so happy to know that help is on the way.  Dudley and I cross the
	highway to get food from the gas station and use their bathroom.  We
	are definitely _off_ this bus now!  Eventually Howard rolls up in his
	little car and we all talk at him at once, telling what happened.
	Then the bus comes into view over the hill.  A cheer goes up and
	everybody grabs their stuff and dances up the stairs into the Mexican
	bus, which is lit up like a party.  We settle into the seats and smile
	all the way to Santa Cruz.  Whereupon we cannot believe the party
	before our eyes, and we all rush to join in.  Next morning, the bus
	leaves for SF at 8 and we're all waiting.  The bus driver is playing
	very cool chill-out music, not the Orb, ok, but great chill-out music
	for being non-techno.  We're climbing the mountains when the bus
	coughs and then quits.  The driver pulls off into a little shoulder
	area, and we all pile out and try to help him push it back onto the
	road, but no use.  So he grabs a pair of gascans and sticks out a thumb.
	Seems like most people weren't interested in helping out a guy with a
	freaky bus, but eventually someone stops, and we wait,looking out
	over the ocean, while the tired ones sleep on the bus.  Suddenly the
	driver is back, getting out of a State Patrol car, and he pours the
	gas into the tank as we look on from one side of the bus and the cop
	looks on from the other.  The driver climbs on and it starts right up.
	The cop goes out onto the highway and stops traffic so we can pull
	out, and we're off, making one last stop at the Shell station across
	from where we waited the night before.  Oh yes, and he dropped people
	off at several places rather than just kicking us all out at 4th and
	Townsend.

I like the logo.
I'm not particularly into jesus, jeez guess I should capitalize.
the design reminds me more of the ankh symbol or however the hell
you spell it.  I think the symmetry is cool.  

anyway, I was politely educated by a born again dude that the
crucifix has jesus' BODY on it, so the proper thing to call
the embedded symbol in the shirt design is a cross.
that's what he says, at least.

crosses left the religious world long ago in my domain.

Okay, not to be out-done by our southern companions, steve@mtxinu and I
will be holding a Berkeley SFR lunch this Friday.  Believe it or not, the
best place I could come up with to hold it is my dorm!  It's actually much more
like an apartment than a dorm.  It's a fairly big place, and private,
and short-term parking is relatively close.  It'll be a bring-your-own-food
deal; I'll have Cokes and OJ, but try to bring everything else (I don't even
have utensils! :)  

	Time: Friday 12 noon until 1-ish.

	Location:  Clark Kerr Campus, Building 17 suite 103
		   2601 Warring St., Berkeley.

	Directions:  Take the 24 east, just past the 580/24 interchange
		Exit Claremont, turn left.
		Turn left at College
		Turn right at Dwight
		Turn right at Warring
		Past the "horseshoe" on the left, you'll see another parking
	lot entrance (before Derby). Turn left into there.
		Ignore the signs (you'll only be there an hour, chances are
	<5% they'll come through to ticket.)
		Try and park on the upper parking lot.
		Walk up the ramp between the L-shaped building on the left
	(building 12) and the one-story building on the right (building 16).  
		As you go up, you're facing building 17.  
		Go up the pathway on the left. 103 is on the left side of the
	building.

	If these are unclear directions, please let me and not the list know - 
I'll post corrections if they're needed.

	Hope to see you all there!

Subject: yer logo

Personally, if I was trying to deal with putting "SFR" into a logo, I'd just
bag it and make a picture logo.  However, here's a suggestion if you're stuck
on the idea.  Throw out the cross, just make it more like an F.  The symmetry
of your S and R can still be used.    Something simple:

	__
      ( __ )
      ) |  (

This looks a lot better on paper.  Something else I came up up with, but looks
too "futuristic" is:

      _ __ _
     (______)
      ) |  \

Again, draw it out and it experiment with it.  But again, if I was running the
badge machine, I'd just make a picture logo.  A cheshire cat with CRT eyes, a
circuit diagram, Milli Volt, or a pixelated airplane.  Whatever.

Well, I decided to FTP the gif file to have a good look at it before
having an opinion, and I agree completely with Neils.

The "crucifix" at the center is just too prominent. Looks like the
perfect logo for an Opus Dei group (bletch!).

I think we need to get rid of the left arm of that undesirable object!

True. To obtain a NoCode Technician license, you need only pass
(written) elements 2A and 2B. They consist of FCC regulations (what
frequencies can be used by who for what at what power level, etc) and
radio theory (antennas and feed lines, propagation, etc).

I'll offer to coach *anybody* through the exams. If you want to study
yourself, I recommend the book _Now You're Talking_ from the ARRL
(American Radio Relay League). The book has the entire question pool
for the element 2A and 2B exams; you *can't* fail. 

Exams are given by the VECs (Volunteer Examination Coodinators) almost
every week *somewhere* in the Bay Area. 

A NoCode Tech is permitted to use ham bands above 30 MHz (6m, 2m, 
220 MHz, 440 MHz, 1.2 Ghz and 2.4 GHz). In the Bay Area, FM voice
repeaters are plentiful on all bands, which means clear, strong
communications from a handheld 5 watt radio to anywhere around the
bay. With a 10 meter FM repeater gateway open, communication is
possible worldwide from a handheld transceiver. Additionally, most
repeaters have an 'autopatch' function which allow use of the
telephone system from your mobile radio...

Oh, by the way, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to Connection -- Ford had
my Mustang that night and I was stuck in Santa Clara...

	Okay, how's this - adopt the current logo as is, and those who have
a problem with the cross image can simply erase the left arm.  Bingo! no
cross.  I've gotten lots of good feedback about the logo, so I don't 
want to change it for the time being...

Youse guys have no taste.  Brian's logo is really good
because it's got some religious associations without being
completely identified with it.  It hovers around the edges
of meaning something in a really cool way.

If you want a different logo, go ahead and design one.  
If it's striking enough people here will remember it and
it'll work for people to identify you.  

If you want to stick with minor variations of the logo I'm
using, you might consider trimming the center-line upwards,
moving toward an addition-sign/red cross association, and
away from the crucifix.

i'm a licensed ham radio operator (KA1IOM) - totally devoid of

Well there are some of us who put the cross in the same category
as the swastika;  It's not something we want to be associated with
in any way.  I can just see myself mentioning to someone that I'm on
the SFRaves mailing list and getting back: "Oh yeah, I've seen
your logo, isn't that some kind of christian organization?"
Feel free to put any kind of design you want on your shirt, but I
don't think it should be called the SFRaves logo without some kind
of consensus.  This debate is starting to remind me why I hate
belonging to organizations/clubs/groups/institutions of any kind.

# 68: your mom, (mc2)      Mon, Aug 24, '92  (23:10)      48 lines

 dispatch from the front lines - Sunday night at 6th and Harrison, Uranus.
 (C) 1992 mc.
 
 I began to realize this morning, as I pondered the differences in attitudes
 here, some folks may not have the same traditions in gender experience.
 
 Liam and Dana brought my friend over to drive us to the EndUp around 10.
 I hadn't been there in a few months, and never before midnight, but Liam
had
 a call from the boy who left him and wanted to get out of his house.
 Trust fund Dana drove the Saab her parents, (dad,) bought her, and was as
 usual, morose about not having sex or a boyfriend since January last.
 
 I was totally bored.  I'm struggling with myself over my friend, who loves
 me, but says she doesn't know what a soul is.  She doesn't.  She's caring,
 kind, and amazing in the way the we connect and sweat.  I felt odd about
 feeling like flirting.  We sat outside and watched the drag queens and the
 adorable and fabulous latin boy in overalls like a cross between Lucy and
 Ricky, his pants moving like snakes.
 
 I kicked myself for getting there before 11.  I sucked.  Before 11 the DJs
 play that sucky arrhythmic house shit that the ravers like, a diarrhea
beat.
 We went in on a few good songs, got covered in sweat, and went back out to
 cool and watch.
 
 *Finally* the beat starts to get good and I go back in, later my friend
 joins me.  I'm feeling tense and feeling bad, I don't respond gently.  She
 does know me, and we push, grasp each others wrists and pull each other
 parallel, towards the floor while straining up on our toes.  A physical
 understanding is reached, and I divert my eyes, more actively search, and
 look, for the better dancers in the crowd, the women wearing the more
 revealing clothes.  We dance near each other, sometimes grinding, but my
 eyes are looking at other eyes and I feel strong.   Like most American eyes
 of any sexual persuasion, most avert, quickly, like there was something to
 be ashamed about looking in or at another's eyes.  Hell, I do it too.
 
 In the two cages made of electrical tape, transvestites, semi-naked men
with
 shining muscles, and transsexuals dance and touch themselves and each
other.
 Uh, subtlety is not a psychological necessity in the incomparable degree of
 sophistication these _men_ display their sexualities.  Stuck to the tape
was
 a three part sign that had previously been taped to a bare chest:
 
     FUCK
 
    FAMILY
 
    VALUES
 
 I have some thoughts about givers of life and all that.

 [like part 2, why question authority when you can fuck it?]
 
 11:30 and the house starts to rock, I'm moving my hips like a jackhammer,
my
 friend presses her chest against me.  Hot, we move towards the sliding
glass
 door between the dance floor and the patio outside.  A young woman there
has
 one on the most beautiful bodies I have ever seen, everything about her is
 gently swelling, on a brown belly tender as air, is a bumper sticker:
 RAVING HOMOSEXUAL.  My friend points and laughs, I put my hand on the
 sticker, rip up, and paste back softly.
 
 On the stage, there is a little show.  A hooded man is bowed over on the
 floor, a tall (every drag queen is for some reason tall it seems,) pre-op
 (?) transsexual with pierced semi-tits is dripping hot wax from a black
 candle on the nipples of Mr. hood.  A cute blond guy that looks like a
 junkie from Exeter has his hands in some kind of wrapping chained spread
 eagled to the ceiling and his feet to the floor.  Some *big* guy in a
 *tight* corset with tattoos and piercings *all* over his body is massaging
 the blonde's crotch.  I could care less.
 
 I'm three way kissing my friend and this voluptuous woman who tastes like
 pure olive oil, she pulls her t-shirt above her breasts, and we're dancing
 into each other.  I'm taller, and now tired of crouching with my thighs, I
 take a break, the two kiss and sway.  I watch the whippings everybody else
 is watching a little.  BOOORING, and I happily go back to dancing.
 
 I having fun, but I'm a little concerned about my friend, is she doing this
 just for me, is it alright to take Z------- home with us?  My friend says
 she's actually worried about how I'll feel if she ignores me with this
 woman.  Sheesh.  We take a walk and sort things out between us, and I feel
 disconnected, but clear, making right in my ways of myself for myself.  But
 I digress.
 
 Back inside is a damn *beautiful* manpussy with slender long and flowing
 legs in four inch fuck me pumps pushing heel against ass crack of the
blonde
 drag queen on the floor in 50's paisley spandex panties.
 
 Kinda takes my mind off my problems.

 [part three of Icelandic Saga...]
 
 Back on the dance floor there's a guy named Kent from San Mateo who kinda
 reminds me of (jeffryp), with two cute girls who are trying to figure out
 how to do what we're doing without much success.  A woman, smaller, like
 (eskimo) with glasses is swinging her hips and arms in a way so masculine
 and *serious*, it astounds me.
 
 There are the usual assortment of a few very beautiful and serious women
who
 come for the energy and don't want to be touched; the exotic men, dancing
 silently, again more serious than fun, anticipating the tragedies of
beauty.
 The fag hippie surfers, with chests so long, hairless, and trim of fat that
 they look like different animals; the ubiquitous eternal friends: the two
 gay roommates and their young female roommate; the prancing whatever in
 flowing black, waving sticks of incense around, untouchable in his own
 right; the teeming *multitudes* of short-haired fresh looking 32 year-olds
 in black boots, blue jeans, and white t-shirts with a saying on them.
 
 The drag queens don't dance, they just are.
 
 It's enough being fabulous, darling.
 
 It's now obvious to us that our Italian flesh nymph is more drunk, our
 dancing is more holding her up, and we start to dance apart.  The weird man
 I've been putting myself between happily gropes her up, and she starts to
 dance with other men.
 
 My friend gets disappointed.  We ask, are declined to take her home, and we
 leave, clear and just as well, walking up Haight and enjoying each other.
 
 She like a red-haired cholo, wearing a red flannel shirt with the top
button
 closed, over some black lace thing.  Me, boots, blue jeans, and er, a black
 t-shirt, long-sleeve, no saying.
 
 We catch a taxi at the projects, the driver stinks like vodka and lights a
 cigarette, missing my street.
 
 Through the gated path under the sky, and my friend and I share what we
know
 about each other, and sleep.
 
 This morning on the N Judah I suddenly remember that I forgot to get the
 phone number of the young Italian woman.  The guy sitting next to me
wonders
 why I said "Shit!" softly and goes back to reading the last day's news.
 
 Er, I thought last night was kinda, uh, tame.  Saturdays is a mostly women
 club, and is um, aggressive.  It's usually more crowded and the dance floor
 gets wet with sweat.
 
 I'd like to get a group from the Well to go next Sunday, August 30.  This
 band, "Crash Worship," like Einsturzende Neubauten on speed, is playing.
 They really kinda sound like freight trains fucking, and not gently.  $5
 cover, 10-3am, band at 11.  Your best entertainment value, I think.  YMMV.
 
 It'll be just a leetle bits wilder than last night, anyone interested?

Maybe you're going to raves looking for the wrong thing.  Many
people have intense, meaningful rave experiences totally
lacking in sexual content.  It's just one dimension.

The swastika was used as a mystical symbol by many different people for
millenia before it was adopted by the Nazi Party.

Mindless, knee-jerk reactions against a symbol that just happens to contain
a cross seem about a closed-minded and bigoted as your typical fundamentalist

So, let me ask the obvious question.  What are you doing here?  Us

I'm probably reading way too much into this, but always thought the PTV
symbol was a combination of a cross and an upside-down cross -- i.e.
a combination of Christianity and satanism.  I figured they were making
some sort of intentional religious statement.  This is not the case with
the SFR logo.

so just leave it at that.  If you want to start reading things into fun little

So what?  It is the reality of what a swastika means today that matters.

>Mindless, knee-jerk reactions against a symbol that just happens to contain

>Christian.

The purpose of a symbols is to communicate ideas.  The ideas often 
repesented by the cross and swastika are readily associated with some 
of the major episodes of oppression, war and muder in human history.
And much of the oppression that comes from these quarters is being targeted
directly at some members of this mailing list in today's reality.

>Bringing you today's friendly reality check,

I guess we live in different realities.  However, feel free to rave with
me decked out in swastikas and crosses if that is what you choose.  I'd
probably assume it was a joke.

Hello SFRavers,

I haven't been posting any messages, but I've been reading mostly all of the
postings that have come my way. 

I really am glad the CONNECTION party went well. I wish I could have gone, but
those during the week parties wear me out. I'd like to see more parties done,
maybe even weekly.  I hear more negative things about the SF/BAY AREA raves
than positive. Bad music, bad crowd, bad lighting, police shutting down, etc..
I have an idea that can remedy all of our raving troubles.

Anyway, now for the good part. I've been a DJ in SF for about 5 years and I 
have a great repore with the owner of a club in SF and well, here it is... 
I can get this space from 2am - 8am on Friday's when nothing else is throwing
down. This space would cost a little of nothing and we can charge a small cover
which can be used to pay DJ's and help throw future events. We can make our
event every week, every other week or even once a month. 

IT WILL BE A PARTY DESIGNED FOR SFRAVERS IN MIND. 

Our own DJ's lighting, smart drinks and yes even our own crowd. I believe
we can have some REAL fun.

I pass this idea in the minds of the SFR subscribers and I will wait for your
responce. If it's positive, I'll talk with the CONNECTION organizer (Brian) to
help get off the ground . Otherwise, I'll just continue...

Keep it alive,

duct tape logo. It's cheap, it's cute, it's an in-joke, and it makes sense.

Almost forgot:
I fail to see how calling people "closed-minded" and "bigoted", accusing them
of "mindless knee-jerk reactions" is either "friendly" or a "reality check,"
Mr Wisner.

One of the products I work on here at Apple had a splash screen that featured
a picasso painting "seated bather". It happens to be a female figure. No one
minded the picture, until someone eventually commented that "perhaps someone
might be upset" by the naked woman.

Needless to say, all hell broke loose. I finally got the artist to make
another logo that only showed the woman's face. Everyone liked that one, since
there was no controversy, and in addition, it was a better picture.

If some people want to change the SFR logo, by all means suggest replacements.
I'm sure there's some combination of lines and curves that will satisfy
everybody, but does not include any offensive symbolism.

Remember also that you don't have to be some kind of artist to do this -- just
sketch something out and send it in. We can always get one of the more artistic
people on the list to do a retouch on it

Personally, I think logos should be simple line drawings, so that they are
easy to render as graffitti (no one would ever do that, now would they!),
rubber stamps, ASCII graphics, etc.

I'm going to try and make *both* the south bay SFRAVES lunch
tomorrow, and the north bay lunch on Friday, so if you want 
to do a T-shirt drop-off, I'll be taking orders for the
stenciling of the ever-so-controversial pure Vitamin B
symbol.  Simple variations (that I can perform with masking
tape) are available for the asking (options include trimming
or chopping the left branch of the cross, or trimming the
central member upward).

Hm. Well when people start flaming each other about how
they're flaming each other, you know things are out of
hand...  I'm sorry if what I've been doing has acted to
trigger or encourage this... I've actually been trying to
suppress my usual negative/critical/hostile attitudes on
this list (there's reasons I'm called  "doom") since they're
perhaps un-ravelike and I am interested in coming up with
other ways to proceed... 

So, if someone swings a blade at you, try and use it to cut
in an interesting direction... and try not to be so quick to
draw your own blade.

There's more I could say, but I'll save it for sometime when
the traffic is lower.

Yeah, should be a good show.  They'll be showing some neat

Does anyone know of any all ages clubs in the south bay where a friend could
take her kid sister (15) to?  Must play dance music of some type, although
house/techno isn't a "requirement."

If I was sure of a rave this weekend that might be good I would suggest it to
them, but I'm not sure if they would go for it.  I think they are sorting
looking for a place where they could arrive at 7-8pm and leave at midnight.

Most of the 18+ clubs (as opposed to a/a or 21+) seem to card no matter what
from what I've seen so trying to pass her off as over 18 seems like a no win
situation.  

So...Anyone with some >really< good advice?

Thanks,

Umm. This doesn't add up.  The system I was using was supposedly only 800
watts (two JBL bass bins, two JBL mid&tweeters, Sonetic amplifier) and 4000
watts from the generator wasn't enough.  I didn't have any lights either.
Maybe the system is higher wattage than I think it is.

Subject: Re: wattage

You've got to realize two things before we all begin about wattage.

a> P != dB       Watts _do not_ equal volume.

b> Amplifers rated at 1000watts need greater than 1000watts generator power to
   power to operate, dependent on the amplifier design, and how the 
   amplifier utilizes power. Look at the ratings on the back of the amp for
   required power and give it about 1/3 more than what it's asking for for
   best results. I know of a system installed in a store that I used to work
   in (HMV) that was 1500 watts, and when we cranked it, The power lights on
   our fordham power line conditioner used to BLINK WITH THE BASSLINNE, because
   the drain was SO high, and this is working off of AC line current, no
   generator.

Understand that when a rave promotor says some shit like "10,000 watts of bass"
its bullshit. The most power you're going to see is 2000-5000W. If they're
silly enough to bring the gas for a 5000W system and the 10kw+ generator
required to juice it, you're going to be paying for a small nucelar power plant
nevermind your rave ticket.

I don't know anything about the Sonetic amplifier, but if it isn't a real
class A or class AB amplifier with a normal transformer-based power supply
(i.e. it uses a scheme similar to the Carver magneto-quackology amplifiers,
or uses a switching power supply), then you're in for some trouble running
off of a generator. You'll also be in trouble if you're trying to power
that amp in a wherehouse with old electrical wiring, or powering it off of
lots of extension cords.

Real amplifiers (esp. good pro quality ones) have huge power supply
capacitors and massive transformers that can take up the slack provided by
a relatively high transient-impedance line-voltage supply -- a big power
transient in the music will be supplied by the charge stored in the
amplifier's power supply capacitors rather than directly asking the
line-voltage supply for a surge of current. If the line-voltage is being
supplied by a generator, that transient surge of current simply won't be
there and your amplifier will clip/distort.

I think this is what was happening with your "4000 watt" generator. The
amp, though rated to produce 800 watts "average continuous power", was
probably putting out very short transients up in the 8000-10,000 watt range
that simply couldn't be supplied by the generator nor the amplifiers power
supply. So it resulted in a temporary drop in line voltage and the supply
voltage and clipped/distorted sound at the amplifier output.

Generators are especially bad at supplying power peaks demanded by a bad or
Carver-style amplifier. They don't have anywhere to store the energy, but
they are good at putting out constant amounts of power under their rated
load.

Rule of thumb is that if the amplifier boasts (say) 600 watts rms
continuous power, weighs less than 20 lbs and fits into 1-2 spaces in a
rack, it has a shitty power supply and will probably sound crappy when run
off a generator.

On the other hand, if the amplifier claims it is "class A" or "class AB",
uses a normal (non-switching) power supply, weighs over 50 lbs for 600
watts RMS, it'll probably sound great when powered by a generator...

Another test is to plug your monster amp into a 10A outlet along with a
light bulb. -- then crank the amp... if the light dims significantly in
sync to the beat of the music, you can be sure that the amplifier won't
sound good off of a generator. (e.g. Carver amplifiers always fail this
test).

Also, in general, you don't want to have hundreds of feet of extension
cords between your power amp and your line voltage source (generator or
power outlet). Plug it right into the source....

From:  Point Reyes Light, of Aug. 27, 1992
Headline (on front-page):  Firemen cancel big Nicasio rave
Headline (on page 8):  No raving in Nicasio
By:  Roger Phelps 

Several hundred concertgoers decended on Nicasio last Saturday night for
a "rave" party that caught sheriff's deputies and fire officials off
guard.

Responding to a fire west of Big Rock on Lucas Valley Road, Fire Marshal
Jack Rosevear spotted a car leaving the scene of a fire and followed it to
a "rave" party off a dirt road in Nicasio.

Raves - quasi-legal concerts in semi-secret locations -  originated in
England, and as many as six are produced in the Bay Area every week.  The
entrance fee to the Nicasio rave was $20 per person.

Driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic on a ranch road that heads north from
the intersection of Point Reyes-Petaluma Road and Nicasio Valley Road,
Rosevear was stopped by the party's promoter and others at the rave's gate.

"We got off on a bad foot right away," said Rosevear.  The fire marshal
said rave organizers stopped him from pursuing the car.  He then radioed
deputies for assistance.

Minutes later, he was able to question the passengers of the car he saw at
Big Rock.  He then let them go.

Deputies who responded said they saw 20-foot-high scaffolding, more than a
dozen "jumbo speakers," portable toilets, about 50 employees, and a five-
acre parking lot ringed with colored lights.

Apparently a light show had been planned with 40 to 50 laser lights, which,
along with a computer system, were plugged into "a generator as big as a
tractor-trailer [truck]," said Deputy Chris Henderson.

Fire Marshal Rosevear inspected the property and said he found several fire
violations including too many extension cords running into a multiple
power source and no designated smoking area.

He then talked to the party promoter, Dave Charfe, of San Francisco about
the fire hazards, and subsequently shut down the party, said Rosevear.

Later, Charfe told the Light he was shut down because he didn't have a
permit.

A party permit is only needed if the group exceeds 1,000.  "There were
50 people tops when they [fire officials] got there," said Charfe.
Deputies, who arrived shortly afterwards, said several hundred concert-
goers had gathered before the event was cancelled.

                      Thousands turned away
Several hundred more were turned back at the gate, said Deputy Henderson.
Motorists heading to the rave continued to arrive until 4 a.m., deputies
said, and one deputy estimated several thousand people altogether
showed up and were turned away.

At the party was read estate agent Peter Edwards who identified the
property owner as Seymour Lazar of Palm Springs.  Lazar was not at
the party.

Edwards said he obtained a okay from Lazar to rent the land for the
party.

George Gallagher of Point Reyes Station, who is an owner of a neighboring
ranch, said his calves were frightened by the noise and got loose.  The
partygoers "got crazy in there.  They ran my calves right over the fence,"
said Gallagher.

His cousin Rich Gallagher said the unexpected rave alarmed him, but 
there was "nothing I could do short of shooting.  I'm too old to fight."

Promoter Charfe, however, told The Light he was upset with the fire
officials for closing down his event because of all the gate fees he
lost.

Subject: Call for reviews and more...


Well, as you'll be able to tell by my .sig,  I spent part of the weekend 
looking for sites for Connection 2.  So far, Baker Beach is out, and Cronkhite
Fort (the one on top of the hill, basically just a bunch of tunnels and gun 
turrets) is also out.  By out, I mean getting the proper permission has been 
ruled out, and holding a less-than-kosher one would be logistically too 
difficult.  There is another campsite in the Marin headlands that sounds 
promising, but the max of 80 people might be a problem...

So, I am hereby putting out the call for more ideas on where to hold Connection
2 (and the answer to your question, Virginia, is yes, I am ready and willing
to coordinate the sequel.)  The location should follow some basic rules: 

1)  It should be free, or available for less than, say, $500.
2)  It should be outside, in a somewhat scenic locale.
	(main reason for this: having it in a warehouse means it'd probably
	be in a tough neighborhood, and it'd also entail getting permits,
	etc... maybe if it was an abandoned church or something. I know
	it'll get cold in the coming months...)
3)  Parking should be plentiful, either at the site or possibly within a short
	bus (ack!) ride.
4)  It should be relatively free of legal hangups, or at least well hidden and
	not requiring breaking through gates or anything.

I'd like to more or less keep discussion of the location off the list - propose
away, and if you agree with the post post that too, but I'd like to only
discuss the final location with people who are going to help with setup/tear
down.  

One thing that Randy suggested to me was the Renaissance Pleasure
Fair grounds - I can't even find an ad for them in the Sunday Chronicle, so
if anyone could get more info on this I'd appreciate it.

I'd like to run it the same way as before - donations, low overhead, etc.
Also, Randy came up with a cool date for the event - Halloween.  Saturday,
October 31st.  If what we're doing is surfing on the crest of the law (like
we did with Connection), that night will work because the police will 
obviously have other things on their minds. :)

I'd just like everyone to know that I've now broken even for Connection,
not for the laser but for everything else, and any extra money I get will
now be put towards Connection II (should we keep the name?  It would help
get people on what will definitely be a tough night.)

I want to finalize the location soon, because I want to start asking DJ's.
If we have it on Halloween, a Saturday, we'll obviously have competition
for their services, and we'd have to pay them this time of course.


Okay, enough with Connection 2 for now.  The main reason I posted was because
I wanted people to post reviews of the raves this past weekend, since I myself
had a hard time getting out of the B-town (though I finally saw the end of
"Brazil - brilliant movie! :) and I wanted to know how Funk Yard was, if
Magic Ticket happened, etc. "We want.... INFORMATION!"


Also, I have been silent on this issue because I wanted to hear what others
would say about it, but I am all in favor of having (and helping organize)
an event at Eric Lacy's club once a month or more.  I think having a smaller-
scale Connection, with a more relaxed atmosphere, charging only $5 or $7 to
get in, in a small space (300-400 people max), would be marvelous.  Getting
DJ's on a Friday night wouldn't be easy, but I know there's some great 
talent on the list, and we could also host other, smaller, less known DJ's
too.  Maybe we could even set it up as something like a proving ground, where
new DJ's come to practise and show off for other promoters or something...
ah whatever.  Those who would be willing to help with this (lighting, sound,
smart bar drinks, etc.) let me know.  I'm in touch with Eric right now, and
when I know more about the actual location I'll know exactly what we'll need
to put it together.  But I can't imagine it would require anywhere near the
level of energy I put into Connection.  Let's do it!  And let's do it for
the _scene_ - any extra money we can put towards future big outdoor raves.
(Keep calling the outdoor ones Connection, call the indoor ones something
else? chmod u+x?)


Any comments on this are more than welcome....

	Brian

p.s. - school's started now, for any who are interested.  Things are going
well... but it was scary to walk into Russian 2 and say to myself, man, it
was a _long_ summer.

Just in case it hasn't been raved over enough, I had to put in yet
another (late) compliment on Connection.  Even from the time I crested
that sand dune at the entrance and saw the beach, the waves, the projections
on the cliffs, the crowd and the music, I realized if I never saw another
scene like that I would still die a happy man.  Unbelievably great crowd,
especially in light of what I saw the rest of that weekend and since.
Perfect physical setting, tripping or not.  Killer music.  In the hundred
(?) or so raves I've been to, one of the very, very best.  One of the
raves which will be remembered as having helped define the SF rave scene,
I think.

As for Connection II:
  - I promise more personal involvement
  - keep the name
  - if possible, not Halloween; too many other things going on, and why
    have it on a Saturday?  I'm thinking of giving up weekend (Fri/Sat)
    raves altogether, wrong crowd, and competition for DJ's.

friday: everything was unappetizing for one reason or another.  a
bus ride to fantasia seemed like a real Bad Idea given the last
fantasia.  nothing else drew me in.  we wound up at dv8 anyway late in
the evening, because we heard that's where fantasia 2000 got bumped
to.  it was pretty damn pathetic.  bad dj, bad crowd, bad scene.  we
stayed for an hour.

saturday: the funk yard seemed like the place to be, so we struck out
for san jose.  struck out is definitely the right phrase there.  the
rave turned out to be in some athletic club.  when we got there, a cop
was sitting outside and the security had locked the doors.  "nobody
gets in now.  go away and come back in 20 minutes."  as we were
leaving, we ran into some friends on the street so we chatted for a
few minutes until we heard the security guy say "either get in or get
out.  now."  so we ran back and pressed in.  instantly my glasses
fogged.  it was about 800 billion degrees inside, with the humidity of
a tropical rainforest.  we made our way to the dance floor (which was
on a basketball court), which was considerably hotter!  aiiigghh.  ran
into my housemate and his girlfriend.  watched the bravest of the
brave attempting to work their bodies on the slick basketball court
floor while condensed sweat ran down the walls (really!).  the music
was spot on, as Spun was doing his usual godlike job.  unfortunately,
i could do little more than sit on a speaker stack, fanning myself
with a rave flyer while listening to Spun work.

eventually i wandered around trying to find cooler spots in the
building.  the chill out area seemed pretty chill, so i relaxed there
for a bit.  while hanging outside, i saw the security people getting
into a total snit over people smoking inside.  apparently they thought
there was crack smoking/dealing going on.  more likely it was just
marijuana, but the whole scene was getting pretty frightening.
eventually the whole thing just sort of turned off at 3 am.  no more
music; the smart bar and t shirt vendors were asked to pack up and
leave...

we heard that many people were going to one step beyond to continue,
but this didn't appeal to me at all, and we were still four or five
hours away from the after party, so i decided to just go home and
sleep.

all in all, a pretty bankrupt weekend rave-wise.  next week - the
event of the century, maybe?

We trudged over to Underground records in Josh's car half the company
therein severly  dosed. They we're dolling out the directions and the
passes at the counter.  Yesenia looked so beautiful but being a promoters
little miss thing has it's perks I suppose.  She put our passes on the 
counter and we split towards the little abadoned lot we dumped the car.
Josh who by now was somewhere past Mars rifles through his pockets only
to find and old Dead ticket stub and a few pears of lint. "Josh" I say
thumping him on the back, "Jerry has a bad influence on you dosen't he?"
We circle back spear the pass off the counter and make for the thing
before Guadalupe freeway.  We not only find it, but to our amusement, 
we find a british lad coughing directions to us. '

   "Keep your lights down and be real low key,"          
None of us know what this means but when you look like Jesus Jones
who's to argue.  Few ravers are milling about next to the warehouse
and we make in.  We meet two enormous n
bouncers who probably shank footballs for the niners in spring camp
and we make our way past there phallic flashlights.  The place is
dark, hot, and poorly lit.  We can see our hands.  This is not
good we notice.  The rave is in what looks like the local Y.  There
are two raquetball courts and one hoops floor.  We walk in, people
are lined around the dance floor, standing, just like a scene out
of a bad John Hughes film.  We should have brought a basketball.  The
music is thunderous, loud and penetrating.  But way too much bass.
We find the chill lounge but no one is chilling.  Some girl is sucking
on a bannana.  Oh I forgot, free fruit.  Some floppy man asks me where
the fry is.  Another raver asks me for X.  I pass them grapes.  It's
going to be a long evening.  When SPUN gets on things get moving.
The man is godlike, he mixes in Headhunter by Front 242 and I almost
orgasm onto the foul lines.  Later we hear Kings X "and I'm so in
ba ba ba, and I'm so in ba ba ba" and serious raving is noticed.
Altogether a good night and probably the salvation of what would
have been another sevey run in the South Bay with Carlo Rossi and 
cheesedip.  I didn't appreciate how they stuffed us in that gym,
air was scarce and sweat was rampant, now I know why Michael Jackson
carries around and oc

Supposedly, this is where last sunday's beach rave was supposed to
happen, ('cept I heard it never happened). Basically, it's about 2 miles
south of the previous location at great-hwy near the zoo.

Wacky concept I know, but howabout having Connection II be a daytime
rave?  Seems especially nice to be outside during the day, and it
won't be as cold either. 

What about the full moon rave site offa cummings skyway on 80 N?

PS: here's another vote for not holding Connection II on Haloween.
I'll be in Toronto. Say, anybody else on this list going to CSCW '92

I went to Virtual Reality.  It was basically a flop although the music
was pretty good while it lasted.  The admission was $20, there was no
music until 1:30 (the story was that the sound people were stopped and
searched by the police) and the music stopped at 4 o'clock.  The dance
floor was set up in a huge batting cage which was sort of neat except
all of the lights were on so the visuals were almost invisible.  I still
don't understand why there seemed to be more people playing video games
and miniture golf than there were dancing.  BTW Virtual Reality was at
the Malibu go cart place in Redwood City next to 101.

I think having a weekly or monthly rave at Eric Lacy's club is an
excellent idea.  I am willing to help out in whatever is needed.

Actually, it's "Los Kings del Mambo" by Studio X.  (BPM Records has the

From:  Point Reyes Light, of Aug. 27, 1992
Headline (on front-page):  Firemen cancel big Nicasio rave
Headline (on page 8):  No raving in Nicasio
By:  Roger Phelps 

Several hundred concertgoers decended on Nicasio last Saturday night for
a "rave" party that caught sheriff's deputies and fire officials off
guard.

Responding to a fire west of Big Rock on Lucas Valley Road, Fire Marshal
Jack Rosevear spotted a car leaving the scene of a fire and followed it to
a "rave" party off a dirt road in Nicasio.

Raves - quasi-legal concerts in semi-secret locations -  originated in
England, and as many as six are produced in the Bay Area every week.  The
entrance fee to the Nicasio rave was $20 per person.

Driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic on a ranch road that heads north from
the intersection of Point Reyes-Petaluma Road and Nicasio Valley Road,
Rosevear was stopped by the party's promoter and others at the rave's gate.

"We got off on a bad foot right away," said Rosevear.  The fire marshal
said rave organizers stopped him from pursuing the car.  He then radioed
deputies for assistance.

Minutes later, he was able to question the passengers of the car he saw at
Big Rock.  He then let them go.

Deputies who responded said they saw 20-foot-high scaffolding, more than a
dozen "jumbo speakers," portable toilets, about 50 employees, and a five-
acre parking lot ringed with colored lights.

Apparently a light show had been planned with 40 to 50 laser lights, which,
along with a computer system, were plugged into "a generator as big as a
tractor-trailer [truck]," said Deputy Chris Henderson.

Fire Marshal Rosevear inspected the property and said he found several fire
violations including too many extension cords running into a multiple
power source and no designated smoking area.

He then talked to the party promoter, Dave Charfe, of San Francisco about
the fire hazards, and subsequently shut down the party, said Rosevear.

Later, Charfe told the Light he was shut down because he didn't have a
permit.

A party permit is only needed if the group exceeds 1,000.  "There were
50 people tops when they [fire officials] got there," said Charfe.
Deputies, who arrived shortly afterwards, said several hundred concert-
goers had gathered before the event was cancelled.

                      Thousands turned away
Several hundred more were turned back at the gate, said Deputy Henderson.
Motorists heading to the rave continued to arrive until 4 a.m., deputies
said, and one deputy estimated several thousand people altogether
showed up and were turned away.

At the party was read estate agent Peter Edwards who identified the
property owner as Seymour Lazar of Palm Springs.  Lazar was not at
the party.

Edwards said he obtained a okay from Lazar to rent the land for the
party.

George Gallagher of Point Reyes Station, who is an owner of a neighboring
ranch, said his calves were frightened by the noise and got loose.  The
partygoers "got crazy in there.  They ran my calves right over the fence,"
said Gallagher.

His cousin Rich Gallagher said the unexpected rave alarmed him, but 
there was "nothing I could do short of shooting.  I'm too old to fight."

Promoter Charfe, however, told The Light he was upset with the fire
officials for closing down his event because of all the gate fees he
lost.

Yes, good idea.  Maybe we can have a pre-rave RAVE. It could start in the afternoon on
Saturdays and end around 10pm when the other raves starts.  What if we teamed up with
another promoter having a rave on that same day and rent a bus.  After our rave, the
bus will shuttle the people to their rave.

Subject: Black Rock Desert


There is going to be a "Burning Man Project" out in Black Rock Desert in 
Nevada this memorial day weekend. I don't think this can be called a rave as
it probably will have some older folks there & it is probably going to have a 
very spiritual theme.  DJ Goa Gil and 2 other dj's will be spinning house 
and other tribal & spacey music on Sunday night of this outdoor 3-4 day event 
this memorial day weekend.  I heard the driving time will be 8 hours? from 
San Francisco but I'm not sure.  The culmination of the event will be the 
burning of a large wooden structure shaped like a person.  Cost is $25, 
and I think one must bring all one's supplies for the 3-4 day event.  The 
Black Rock Desert is a flat hard-surfaced barren space for miles & miles 
according to the pamphlet I got.  I believe some preparation is required 
with respect to gathering supplies before you go such as 3-4 days worth of 
water for the desert, food, sun protection, shelter etc but I'm not sure.  
I think the organizers will provide portable showers and toilets.
You should go to House Wares to find out.  The Buring man number is 267-6948.

Count me in for Connection: The Next Incarnation!
I think a weeknight is better than a weekend, even though it makes us tired
because the DJs are all busy [are we gonna ask Carlos to do a 4th show of
the night?].  Also I think mid-week events draw better crowds.  Just MHO.

Also one word on thE E quEstion.  I know you've all seen [read??] my rants
on this, and I want to be more clear.  I have no problem with thE E itsElf,
I think it's swEll.  However, I don't like to highlight stuff like that on
fliers or posters that thE policE could sEE.  They aren't as dumb as they
look, not all of em anyway.  I love raving, and I loved Connection, and I
just don't want to take any stupid risks.  Worthwhile risks are another
story, but I really feel that the single greates threat to the
continuation of the rave scene is the perception that raves are just big
drug parties.  You and I know there is so much more to it than that, and we
could lose the whole thing over this.  The anti-drug hysteria has reached a
ridiculous level, but until it calms down a bit, I'd prefer it if we didn't
push our luck.  Gads, I went on about this, didn't I.  Oh wEll...

Halloween is probably bad 'cause of all the competition
(Castro, other raves) and the fact that cops all over the
country are edgy every Halloween.  Why not the Friday or
Thursday before?  Thursday is better than Friday, I think,
because people won't want to stay out all night the night
before Halloween and it seemed like we got a nice hard-core
group with CI in part because it was a Thursday.

Lots of folks would like a chance to wear their costumes
twice.  A pre-Halloween Halloween rave, eh?

>Someone was telling me about a streach of Beach south of SF below where we

Most places, Parks Service rangers are tolerant, nice folks.
The SF branch, for some reason, has a lot of assholes.  They
watch Baker Beach with an eagle eye (well, maybe not the north
half).  Don't expect a lot of leeway from them for anything
happening at Baker, Ocean, etc. beaches.

>I don't want to tangle with

>getting cited by a federal cops means you get a FBI case id and record even if
>it's a misdemeanor)  

Speaking as someone with a Federal record, the FBI is so
fascistic and omniscient that you should just give up worrying
about them.  If you are charged with any felony drug crime,
they open a file on you.  If you practice any kind of
political/social activism, they open a file on you.  If you
ask to see your file, they open a file on you.  If you lead a
life anywhere out of the reasonable norm, you'll end up with
an FBI file.  Unless you can get concrete, independent proof
that they have a file on you, they will never admit they have
a file on you and will never, ever divulge it.  So there's
really no point in worrying about it.

Subject: Our own private gatherings - call for DJ's!


	Okay, I just talked to Eric, and the space he's talking about sounds
great.  It's where Wicked and Come/Unity are held, 1015 Folsom, in the 
basement.  We can hold 200-250 people there, and for a mere $500, everything
will be provided (space, security, lighting, sound system, everything except
smart drinks and DJ's).  It can be had from 2am to 8am - starts late, I know,
but that's to keep the beer guzzlin' crowd that normally hang out there on a
Friday night away.  

	So here is where the list comes in.  All of you DJ's out there, who
would be willing to do a 2-hour-or-so stint, get back to me.  I will start
asking some DJ's, but since it's a Friday night/Saturday morning deal we'd
face stiff competition for the likes of Carlos and Spun.  But needless to
say, they are far from the only people with talent.  

	I propose a $5 head.  With 100 people (no problem, those of us from
the list could cover that) we'd break even.  With a full house we could
probably afford to pay each DJ $100 or more, and the extra money can go
towards future SFRAVES events. 

	Now all we need is a date, and a name.  The club is booked for 
September 19th, so we can go with the 11th, or late Sept/early Oct.  I
would be all for going on the 11th, but getting DJ's on such short notice
might be a problem, I agree.  As for the name... Eric suggested Insomnia,
which I like a lot (seeing as how that describes it well), but e-mail me 
if you have a religious problem with it or something. :)  I sorta want
to reserve the name "Connection" for larger once-every-two-or-three month
events, but we can certainly say on the fliers "brought to you by the 
organizers of Connection".

	Even though it's on a Friday night, I've become somewhat convinced 
that that shouldn't be a problem.  Unless we're up against a full moon rave
or a really promising Gathering, I think a large part of the hardcore crowd
are looking away from the big events and looking for something smaller; we'll
also be able to handle refugees from a shutdown rave, no problem.  So far,
the only thing I know of on Friday the 11th is "Higgledy Piggledy"... any
competition? :)

	So, any and all DJ's, get back to me.  I'll go call a bunch right now,
too...  do we want to have it on the 11th?  If so, arrangements need to be
made now, along with word-of-mouth and small flyering this weekend...

	Wheee!

	Brian

p.s. - Chris, do you want to do the Smart Bar?
