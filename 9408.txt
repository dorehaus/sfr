Agreed, simply because how a DJ gets the crowd off goes far beyond simply what
genre of music he's playing.  Keep in mind that within any genre there will be
very good tunes as well as some very trite and mediocre songs as well.  It's
also all up to the DJ to beatmix the tunes properly in addition to picking the
more interesting songs to play in his set.

Maybe if we had a list that had the names of DJs and a comment on whether each
individual DJ had good taste in music or not.  :)

Suffering a from a temporary lack of judgement and some rather persuasive
chicas, I went to Anthem of the Sun and even plunked down the $20 for no good
reason that I can think of now... It was at the YMCA @ 240 Golden Gate, a new
and unused location though obvious not bust-free, as it was shut down at
sometime after 3.  This really, really sucks cuz everyone was really gettin
into it and was suddenly dumped onto the streets and pretty much forced to
get in their cars and drive off in front of much police.  There was a very
interesting period, when the music was shut off and we were told that it
would start up again in about 15 minutes.  So everyone sat around in the dark
talking and trying to entertain themselves including some phat freestyle
rapping.  Probably the strongest sense of communal vibe I felt all night.
 The party was shut down conveniently before any of the big DJs could go
on(are Jeno and Garth even back fro NY yet?)  I sincerly hope that Richard
Sun(I'm assuming he's the promoter) never gets to do another party in this
city - I knew better but lots of people don't. Continuing my night of poor
decision making, I got in a car that was going to a party in Oakland.  Turned
out to be Ghost and friends' nitrous gallery/warehouse.  Definately not my
scene, interesting to observe though pretty depressing.  There are some
really lost people out there and I really wish we could pull them back into
something positive but I don't know how.  Overall, an interesting view of
some of the other flavors of SF, but I think I'll stick to the really great
smaller SFR related parties I've been to and of course I await the return of
the Wicked boys - see ya there.

I think the problem with Anthem of the Sun was that they found
a nice place that was north of Market, close enough to residential
areas so that loud thumping scrathched some of the locals the
wrong way.  There were a couple of noise complaints, which brought
the police.  From there the police and the not so nice Anthem security
just started screaming at people to leave now.  It's really too
bad, because there was a nice vibe going on upstairs, where a good
several hundred were dancing visciously, with the other half of
the main room covered with resting bodies.  The security were
unfriendly from the start, though, and they wouldn't let you
stop on the stairs or in hallways, as they continuously yelled
"keep it moving.." which was a problem as there was no chill out
or even remotely quiet area to pause... which lead many people 
on quests for the quiet areas, only to walk around in circles.
Beyond that, I still had about three hours of good dancing.  Met
enough HAPPY people to make me feel good about the evening.
Didn't feel good about the $20 and rude way they pushed everyone out.
In my opinion, they should've made some attempt at refunding 
part of the money... many but many people were fuming outside, which isn't
a nice way to end an evening.  So be it.  My weekend was doomed
the moment I started looking for the beach party in Santa Cruz.
How did the Santa Cruz party on Saturday go?
I must keep hope that raves will work in SC as that's where I live.

Regards to all...
-john.

Hello, my name is Tony.  No, not DJ Tony, stupid.  I dj under the assumed 
name "fog".  

My particular styles of definable music are:
House Music
Techno
Trance
Super-Tribal-Break-a-Funk
Hard House
Soft house
Ambient Techno
Ambient House
Super-Duper Fast (But not too fast) Deep house
Stoner Disco
Underground Trance
Natural Sounds

In fact, you can call my music whatever you want.  But you won't really 
know what I play until you hear me spin.  And when I buy new records, I 
am not necessarily going to stick to these dreadful parameters.  

Well, now I feel classified, just like a box of cereal.  Won't someone 
please come pour milk on me?

Well first you need to get everyone to agree on the terminology.

Then you need to ask each DJ which of these terms applies to them. And
you'd need to update it, say monthly, because DJs often go in new
directions or on binges.

We really weren't gonna do anything this weekend, but Anthem Of the Sun
got us curious, mainly because the new location was so close to home.
We got there a little before 3 and hung out outside a bit, but didn't get 
a good feeling from things.  Paranoid  behavior by the door and our
familiarity with this neighborhood led us to conclude that this party was 
in no way legal to go all nite.  Reports of an  overcrowded nonventilated 
scene from people leaving also helped us decide to not go in.  Had I known 
this was a Richard Sun production, we wouldn't have even bothered.  

Sunday: We went to the World Unity festival at GG Park Band Shell.  We
managed to be entertained by the diversity of people and *some* good
music.  The Band, Trance Mission was notably excellent - ethnic tribal
music, with digideroos, etc. - very trancey and danceable.  We encountered
Mr. Crunch who pointed us towards the other end of the Concourse where
Spaz had set up a small but effective sound system.  A bunch of 
percussionists created some clatter in an attempt to accompany the 
music, but it sounded more like a battle than a fusion.  Oh well,
it was all in the name of world unity where the struggle to forge
harmony often leads to chaos.  Not that I don't mind a little chaos in
my world, but when the goal is harmony/untiy, it can just end up feeling
like a lot of misdirected and wasted energy.

Anyway, there weren't many ravers there, so we never got much of a vibe 
going.  Shoban started DJing and upped the BPMs much to the distress of 
the percussionists who nevertheless flailed away.  But wind caused the 
tonearms to flail all over the place as well.  Anyway, thanx to the Spaz
people for trying - hopefully more publicity next time will get a real
party going.

Aaron - 6.25%
Pollywog - 6.25%
Adam X - 6.25%
Thomas - 6.25%
Garth - 6.25%
Richie Rich Hawtin - 6.25%
Tony - 18.75% <------------winner!
Andre Lucero - 6.25%
Doran - 12.5%

Undecided - 6.25%

Thanks to all, there will be another poll soon with a less ambiguous

basically I just wanted one.  

Happy Lucky Charms,
Tony

Simon was to come on at 4am and was all phsyched to play, so we get in
around 3:15.  I was surprised to see signs all over  the doors with
"Private Party" written on them.  Was the place already overcrowded?  Was
this a way to keep the prying eyes of law-enforcement distanced?  No sooner
had we arrived when someone came up to Carlos and said shut the music down
for a half an hour until the cops leave.  I ran downstairs to see what was
_really_ going on and there were three cops on the street yelling at people
to leave or risk arrest.  Nope, it wasn't going to happen so I ran back
upstairs and grabbed our stuff and left.

The space was nice, but unfortunately not bust-free.  The sound system
kinda sucked, but I suppose they were trying to keep the noise level down.

   The weekend started off with my friends party in Santa Cruz.  He was 
extremely psyched and had a lot of people psyched also.  Unfortunatley, 
he assumed that he would be able to pull it off in the small cove to the 
left of Bonny Doon... 

   However, since the last HUGE FMR at Bonny, the Rangers have been told 
they can arrest people for crossing the train tracks.  This comes from 
So. Pacific Railroad, they have told the Santa Cruz police to arrest 
people for trespassing on the tracks.

   Anyways, the rangers caught my friend WHILE unloading the gear.  They 
gave him a parking ticket and told him they would arrest him and his 
friends and confiscate the sound system if he threw the party... So this 
scared the shit out of him and he didn't have the guts to throw it at 
another site.  He also never changed the voice mail.. ::SMACK!!::  I told 
him I was a bit pissed for having to drive up to SC (With my other 
friends as well) and then have no party and THEN not changing the 
message..  Sigh.. The only thing that Santa Cruz seems to have left are 
some of the smaller, indoor, parties like the sweatbox and the redroom.

   So I slept most of Saturday, in preperation for our Cloud Factory 
party.  We had been planning it for quite some time and had a great 
beach site (a GIANT sand crater from an old sand mine.) two good systems 
and five great DJ's.  Our planning paid off, and even though we had a few 
brushed with the cops (they closed down the map site) and even though it 
was a bit of a walk to the site, we still had almost 100 people show up 
from Monterey and Santa Cruz.  Unfortunatley there weren't too many of 
you from San Jose or San Francisco....... But HOPEFULLY you will all trek 
up here in two weeks for our next party ;)

  Well, if anyone else wants to comment on the party, feel free.. I feel 
kind of biased since I was one of the DJ's and helped throw it.. 

 p.s.

  Many thanks to Bryce for DAT'ing the whole night.  Hopefully we can get 
a four or five tape set out of the evening in a few months... maybe ;)

 Peace..

-Ernie

I don't think that many people voted -- I voted for Adam X
and I really can't believe that anyone else here did --
yet he got a whopping 6.25% of the vote.

An awesome weekend! I'm so sorry other people had bad run ins.

Friday: the last SPAZ.
Although it didn't go all night it ROCKED until 2am when noise complaints
from upstairs Kalesa forced it to shut down. Since it was the normal
time range and $3.00 then this is no big deal. Alex, Shobhan, Topher
and others spun in the totally packed downstairs while Weird Blinking LIghts
and OST jammed live emusic upstairs after Takeshi spun an ambient set.

Saturday: Ultraviolet
A new gorgeous central warehouse space with massive well ventillated rooms
and amazing Jeffery/Denise decorations. $3.00, all night.

Its amazing how great the underground parties are. Our under $5.00 scene
is really great here. Its very diverse and filled with great locations
and people.

I'll never understand how anyone could even THINK of going to a $15.00 or
$20.00 party when there are so many great small parties around.

Make sure you check out Weird Blinking Lights at Gaia Mantra this saturday
at 2:00pm and its FREE!

amazing!  one of the DJs that i really miss now that i'm in exile in
Boston :-) then again, i didn't vote, or she would have been listed...

Uh, which means 16 people voted :)

I'm working on a SFRaves demographic survey, which I'll make live 
sometime soon, and I can make "favorite DJ's" a part of that.
I did a similar survey like 2 years ago, so it's long overdue.

Deak--

What you and others need to know is to consult people
who know before you plan BDBeach parties.  It is not
just SP that prevents crossing the tracks, it is literally
against the law to use the beach the way we have for
parties.  It will be heavily surveiled for some time now
because of the last large, messy FMR (NOT becaue of the
Rolling Stone article).  I've lived here for 22years
and gone to may partiesin the 70s, 80s, and 90s at BD
Beach.  After suitable (whatever that amounts to) time,
we start having parties there again. Let's have more
consultation in the community before alerting the forcres
again!

ciao,
Will

i find it strange and interesting that most all of the favorite dj's are 
from the bay area...doesn't anyone like dj's from anywhere else...or 
is that just an east coast phenomena? i never saw the survey in my mailer 
or i would have voted for joeski *a dj in ny* ....geez i guess people 
here aren't really exposed to stuff going on out there...you know most 
ne-ravers i know could rattle off atleast 3 dj's from sf...geez you 
would think we were the center of everything *and maybe we are* but 
time to start thinking globally...susie (: the "bicoastal raver babe"

If--as I gathered Brian said--only 15 people participated in the poll,
those percentages don't mean much!  Yje *number* of people polled,
I believe, should *always* be part of the reporting!

Thanks go to you anyway for doing this--and getting, I'm sure,
both kudos and brickbats as well as some good suggestions for
future ventures like it!

ciao,
Will

Joeski will be playing at a rave here on (I think) August 20th, along
with Joey Beltram and others.

I'm a little uncomfortable with this polling stuff which is why I didn't
participate.  16 responses isn't enough to tell much, anyway.  Also, not
to complain too much, but I've never heard of "Richie Rich Hawtin" although
both Richie Hawtin and Richie Rich were at the Detroit music conference
I just attended :)

One of the great things about the current state of affairs is that there
are so many different DJs with so many different and valid approaches.
Someone might be 'on fire' one night and not the next; some are steadier
than others but never reach the peaks of those who try and sometimes
fall on their faces.

  Just to clear something up..  I was only asked by my friend to DJ 'HIS' 
party in Santa Cruz.  I was really pissed at how poorly he handled it.  
However, I was helping out with the party in Monterey, which was thrown 
by the Cloud Factory.  We pulled it all together and had a lot of fun 
doing it! Only problem was the 2.5 hours it took to get the equipment OUT 
of the spot =/

Hi!  Sorry sorry to all those who went searching for the New Moon party
last month and either couldn't find it or found it after it was busted.
We had problems with our voicemail (American Message Service) & couldn't
change our outgoing message to let people know what was up!  In the end,
we moved it to Berkeley's Chateau co-op, home of MESS, where after a
refreshing dip in the pool, we started up again.  Thanks especially go
out to Bryce, Sean C., Rowan & Sean's pal Greg (from Davis) who kept it
going during the afternoon.  It was fun hanging out on the porch with you
guys!  

This coming sunday the party will be indoors, possibly in SF.  Voicemail
(415-267-3076) is troublefree at the moment....but...does anybody have
advice on which companies are the best?  We are thinking of changing

Subject: Burning Man and other fun nuggets

RE: Brians correction about the Burning Man Festival, um, in fact the
organizers are asking for $30. from EVERYONE, however, given that people
cannot afford the techo-pagan fire ritual, they are reasonable and want all
participate.  They are very strict with tickets, each one has a serial
number and officially they are printing up Zippy Pronoia Tour/Burning Man
vouchers, good for $5 off the $30 ticket price.  These vouchers will be
handed out by the Zippies (the Tour zippies, that is) from August 21 to
August 28 at the Grand Canyon Area.  Details to follow.

Contact 1.415.AM.PROID for updates as we post them to voice mail.

REGARDING the heaps of dialogue, the criticisms (both the fair and lying-ass
slime variety), we are reading it all as a group, and pondering the
appropriate responses to sfraves and alt.culture.zippies...

The FACTS of what happened at Vivid Pronoia (yes, the objective FACTS) are
not quite what everyone may think.)

We have limited online access, lots of zippies who want to respond
individually, and as a group.  More power to the power of debate!

Hang in there, we will contribute to the dialogue and address concerns
shortly.  Meanwhile, manifest life poem...

Subject: Saturday Night
Date: Mon, 1 Aug 1994 19:01:52 -0700 (PDT)

	We left the South Bay for San Francisco on Saturday night
with a few parties in mind, but having no idea what would be good
or bad.  
	Our first stop was the Berkeley student co-op, where the
Mother Earth sound system was set up.  We knew many people there,
and had a good 1.5-2 hours of dancing fun.  The semi-enclosed room
was comfortably full with about 20 people dancing.  The vibe is
what you would expect from a small gathering such as this.  Not
many people, but everyone putting a lot of energy into the air.  
Happy people and good times.  We could have stayed there for much
of the night, but San Fran was beckoning...
	Anthem of the Sun did have a good location.  The YMCA provided
a real ravey feel, with lots of hallways to hang out in/explore.  But
most of the hallways were brightly lit, taking most of the mystery
away.  Twenty bucks got you a good location, a good sound system, 
and even good music.  But, as we all know, you can't buy vibe, and 
this event was sorely lacking.  Most of the people there were about
the same age I was when I got into raving in '91.  But I don't 
remember the parties I went to being like this.  I remember my first
raves as being totally chaotic, totally crazy, and completely fun.  I 
remember huge rooms of people where no one was sitting down, 
where no one could really stand to sit down(?). I remember complete
and total release of youthful energy, and it was wonderful.  
	But, Anthem was different.  Sure, many people were dancing,
but most were just half-into it.  There were lots of little wanna-be
gansta types.  Everyone had the "rave" clothes, but few seemed to
rave like I used to (It took me about 7 events before I invested in my
first Clobber shirt.)  I am wondering if the rave scene that swept 
through my life when I was 18 is different now.  It seems more
diluted, to much like any other teenage party.  I would like to think
that it was just a bad event, but if that same event had occurred in '91, with
the same location, laser, sound and DJ's, It would have
gone OFF!  I'm still having just as much fun going to raves/house clubs
now as I did when I started, so I don't think the scene is going bad.
I just think that the younger people are getting crappy events, and
this is preventing them from seeing how wonderful raves really are.
I would hate to be this narrow demographic of people who 
experienced raves.  I would hope instead that each year more and
more kids got into the scene, into the "real" rave scene, the rave
scene we experienced.
	Anyway, my friend suggested we leave and check out Funky 
Budda.  I tried to forget the fact that I paid 20 dollars for 45 
minutes of club.  I think we left just before things started to fall
apart there.  Funky Budda was in the same location that Spundae is
held at.  We got there and Mark Farina was spinning a wonderful, 
funky house set.  This club was pretty cool.  It was a classic house
club.  Probably about a 50/50 gay/straight homogenized crowd, 
complete with freak show-ers and drag queens (A guy there had
18 inch platform shoes!).  By about 4:30 the place was bursting with
energy and love.  I don't think I have heard such good house music 
since I left LA.  By about 6:30 the atmosphere started changing from
a house club to a gay pick-up club.  I even got hit on.  ("what, you're
STRAIGHT!!??", "Yeah man, but I ain't NARROW!")  Hmmm, come to 
think of it, maybe it was mostly a gay club.  Oh well, the music
and vibe were great, and that is what matters to me.  Funky Budda
is a great place to go if your 1st choice San Fran club does not work
out.  21+, 5 dollar cover.
	Comment/Question:  I have noticed that most of the cool 
renegade parties out there spin mostly hard trance/techno.  Do any
of you do more funky, housy parties?  Let me know.

You have to expect that people will have to pick people who are local. 
They are the ones that people are most exposed to and they are there week 
after week. As for DJs who are from elsewhere, there has been some 
"guest" djs that come from various places. Some of them are really good, 
but when you go and see them half the time you don't know who they are or 
whether they are on or not. A one time experience doesn't really 
constitute a favorite DJ... 



And yes susie, I am reading sfraves mail again:)

Might as well make a yearly what's in and what's out list. I dunno what 
happened to my Wired/Tired post. It would be great to see the list in a

Since I posted a request for information about XLR8R Magazine, I've
received about 8 direct replies.  I want to thank everyone who responded.
Once again it just goes to show how tight a community SFRs are and most of
them were not tied to the publication.
>From all the postings, the greatest news came from Matthew J. Corwine (he
does have links to the magazine), who informed me that XLR8R magazine is
moving to San Francisco.  I think this is great news.  For one thing there
will be more coverage of the local scene although I thought they were
already doing a pretty good job at it for a magazine from Seattle.  Another
posting gave me an address on Haight street but was not specific whether it
was their new operating location so I will not post that address.
I hope they (XLR8R magazine) will post their info here for everyone to
benefit from as I'm sure I'm not the only one interested in the development
of their move to the Bay Area.

Great News...and thanks again everyone.

Yep, that was Craig. He did a cut on the "50 years of Sunshine" CD.
Brad (think he's going by Tumbleweed), came on after him around 3am, but
my temporal reckoning could have been a bit flawed by then ....
This was put on by some of the old Mr. Floppy crowd, but I didn't see Paul
there.
For those of you newer to the scene, Mr. Floppy put on the some of
the coolest undergrounds a few years back. The last Ultraviolet was well over
a year ago.

SO clearly getting agreement on what these terms mean is first, before
anything else can occur (whether anything else is desirable or not :-) ).

I think that would a good idea and could be entered into the new version
of the alt.rave FAQ as well.

If people have entirely conflicting ideas of what these terms mean (even
techno and house, by the way!) then what is the point of even using them?

Well, 'tis confirmed, 'tis for real, XLR8R really is now in San 
Francisco.  It's quite a loss for our fair city, but quite a gain for 
yours.  The format is being upgraded, the circulation is growing, and 
Andrew, Andrew, and Ethan are pleased as punch to be down there.  Here is 
all the appropriate contact information:

And some other goodish news:I'm putting out a record, with Seattle DJs 
Michael Manahan, and Dervish, on Visible come October.  Seems as if

Actually the artist(s) is the Bass Bin Twins. I've seen 2 12", including
the aforementioned 'A-1 Love,' but there's supposedly a third one as well.
I believe it's one guy who recently moved to SF from LA. I'll see if I can
find out more info.

This really has nothing to do with the situation at hand,
but sorta does...

It's just that it scares me when people start talking about objective facts,
because then they usually follow it up with lots of perceptions
and in doing so tned to ignore other possible perceptions.

It's most likely because i come from a system of thought that
believes the only facts are those which we create.
(ie 1+2=3, why? because we said so :)

You can have your perceptions of what happened and someone else witnessing
the same events will have a different perception.  Even more likely
is that you witnessed different (or more) events and thus have a completely
different perception of the situation than others might.

BUT for you to have the "objective FACTS" would mean that you have
no subjective filters in your brain/soul.  Hell, even if you were a 
camera i wouldnt trust you to represent the objective facts
much less a living machine with feelings and ideas.

just some thoughts

It ain't gonna happen.  I called the music from last friday tribal to deep 
and my roomate called it acid.  We were at the same party.  We listen to lots
of each others music.  We like to talk about music.

I sympathize with the adjective overload syndrome.  And with all the SF
parties it would be nice to have some better guide. 
You just have to go and commit.  
Let it take you somewhere.  
It's ok to warm up to something different.
I prefer this.  I like variety.

The music doesn't always have to hit you like a mack truck
Maybe it gets Deep because of your new funky friends
Or the groove you just found
Words just don't always cut the Mustard
It is too experiential 

Think of the descriptions as little clues or hints for you to work with
The promoter doesn't want to spoon feed you  
This is not, however, all that easy ...
Some parties do jam mash potatoes down your throat
while others leave you starving

because I can say to my friends, "I like House"

	Actually, his name is Pete, and as far as I know he's indeed 
living up here in SF.  I met him @ Rasputin's a few weeks back, and he 
struck me, on 1st impression, as one of the coolest motherfuckers on the 
scene.  He put out a white label that scorches like none other, and 
seemed perfectly modest, even humble, when I started flying off the 
handle about what a milestone record it was.  I'll speak up if I hear 
from him again.

Someone posted earlier today asking what was played at the various
renegades and said something to the effect that they thought the
renegades are mostly techno.

If you like variety and music in general, you are bound to find
something you like at any and all the renegades being thrown (NMR,
MESS, Spiral Jive, Cloud Factory, Liquid Air, Sunset, sorry if I
missed anyone :-) ).  None of them are more than about half techno.  
Sometimes you can even catch a few hip-hop or even industrial tracks
mixed into a set.

Of the "usual" Liquid Air DJs only about half of them play techno, 
and the style of techno ranges from very acid-house influenced to very 
smooth spacey trance to harder more "old style" techno.  On the house 
side the last Liquid Air featured sets from Tamara (funky stuff and old 
school acid house from 1988), Lee An (progressive and "happy/disco/diva"), 
and Deaks (progressive and light trance).

Speaking of Liquid, we're pulling out the sound system this FRIDAY in
honor of Bryce's birthday.  He's spinning near the beginning so get
there early if you want to hear him :-)  It's free, it's outdoors, and
we're attempting a location that hasn't been used in a LONG time (no, 
not Bonny Doon).

Call (415) - 985 - 5244 or finger me Friday night for info.

See you!

Well, it's a bit late, but then again, i've been constructing an InterNet
site...where does all the time go?  In any case, I was invited to attend
Cirrus, which was put on by the folks at the Cloud Factory in Monterey.
I was asked to bring Liquid down, and to provide some advice on logistics,
location, etc.  As time went on, however, it became clear to me that the
folks at the Clound Factory were very organized, and they eventually told
me i needn't bring Liquid, just myself.

I thought the date was a good omen, from the very first mention to me...
the eve of Lammas, an ancient harvest festival.  Lammas is traditionally
the time of the first harvest, and one of the major festivals in a variety
of ancient Northern European calendars.

The site was absolutely awesome, and worth the work to load in (though the
load out was a real bear, as ernie has already mentioned).  Cirrus was held
in a natural amphitheater, and was well away from any neighbors of any kind
(except birds and marine life).  At the top of the amphitheater, one could
see the breakers, the bay, and beyond, the lights of Monterey...quite
charming!  There was also the long hops down the side of the site to the
base, where the sound system was set up.  Despite a few logistical problems
at the map point, which were ultimately corrected by quick updates to the
voice mail, almost everything went smoothly.

Cirrus had an excellent sound system that thumped but good, and filled the
entire space with sound...very impressive for a rental...and the sound
provider was a pro.  I attended from the very beginning to the very end, and
met many old and new friends.  The quality of the DJing was superb...Tim,
K-Go, Ernie, Christian and I provided some bang-up music which kept people
dancing till just past dawn.  The Cloud Factory had originally asked for 
US$2 at the map point, but when problems arose, requested donations at the
decks; many people contributed.  Despite a few mishaps, all of the equipment
needed to throw the event without a hitch were present, and were provided by
the entire group of people who organized the event.

I have to tell you all that i was *very* impressed with the organization
of the folks from the Cloud Factory.  It was a group effort from the
inception (that's clear) all the way through the end.  Everyone pitched
in to help where needed, travelling, hauling, whatever needed to be done
got done without grumbling, without nasty encounters, and without any
hand-wringing.  They were prepared for a variety of potential problems with
interlopers (though none showed up).  They got the word out, and kept folks
informed of the latest news...a very good package, all told...they put many
an SF-based organizer to shame, and they've only been doing this for a very
short while.

I strongly recommend to you all that you attend one of their events in the
near future.  These folks know how to do it right!

this is kinda directed in the hyperreal management :) direction
but figured i would try to generate some more flam.. er talk :)

a friend of mine said he was trying to come out with a pamphlet
on drug use and all that
and noticed that there was a lack of info on
meth, cocaine, amphetamines, ritalin and other pills
that it seems like a lot of kids are popping now days...

considering the amount of traffic that happened not too long ago
that was around the topic of crystal, i think it would be a good idea
to start generating some info, BOTH good and bad on the usage
of this and other chemicals that im sure people
on this list have experience with

(actually this is mostly a test message cuz i havent
gotten mail all day and a wierd thing happened
when i did a who sfraves :)

from sfraves-planners and resubbed everyone except those I knew weren't 
on sfraves.  I'll make an announcement to the calendar list and to

I don't know how it happened; I'm pretty sure it's a bug in majordomo,
as I wasn't working in that area at all yesterday.  I did have to reboot 
hyperreal, that's all I can think of that might cause it, and only a 
couple others had write access to it.

Anyways, sorry about the mess.

This has happened twice now to a list I run on netcom, which also uses
majordomo.  It first happened when the list got to about 500 people
and 10-15 MB/day of traffic.  It probably is a majordomo bug.

Okay, Derek found a list dated June 1st and I reinstalled that.  For those of
you just tuning in, the sfraves list was somehow erased sometime 
yesterday, and I didn't have a backup copy.  Everything else on hyperreal 
is fine, as far as I can tell; anyways, there are probably a bunch of you 
getting this mail who unsubb'd from sfraves over the past month, and if 
you are, let me know and I'll re-unsubscribe you.  

Thanks for understanding.  Once I'm sure most people are re-subb'd I'll
post the messages that haven't made it through yet today.

	Brian

  Went to CU last night at 1015 Folsom and spent most of the evening in the
 ambient room with Dubtribe ( I had been wanting to hear their live stuff
 for some time ) and I was pleased. Way out excellent tribal ? rhythms
 played on electronic/natural drums, great vocals from a woman ( who is 
 she ? ) and nice mix of beat oriented ambient tunes. Check it out - I 
 notice they will be back on Sept 7 at next CU monthly....

  About 2:30 I left the ambient room and went into the main - WOW What a
 PARTY. Can we talk about dancing sardines ? But it sure looked like the
 people were having one hell of a great time. I didn't expect this many
 party people on midweek but there they were dancing their asses off...
 definitely not for the claustrophobic but absolutely worth checking if
 you want to dance with a crowd... at $7 I have no arguements with the
 price....

  I noticed something as I listened to the music at the CU last night
 which has caused me to wonder if I'm hearing things "right". The music
 I heard in the main room seemed to have far more beat than music - but I
 am defining "music" as synthe or other instrument melody... Don't get me
 wrong what I seemed to be hearing was WONDERFUL to dance to but I'm not
 sure that as a musician I would enjoy simply listening to it... which
 brings me to a question for those on the net with more listening experience

 Am I indeed hearing 2 (or more?) major types of music...

 1) played at FF had the strong beat but also has an almost equal element
    of "play with your head electronic sound" VERY strong synthe presense
    with more of a sense of melody...

 2) played at CU had a strong beat without nearly as much of the melody 
    and electronic swirls Etc.


  Comments ?



  BTW I'm fishing for differences to help me search out types of music and
   am not really aiming at judgments of better or worse ie. this is great
   but that sucks. Also labels are going to be a major pain in the butt..
   but then in order to talk you have to use something.....

Looks like a good weekend coming up.  Had a great time at Come-Unity
last night, great energy & felt like old times.  I think I'm going to
catch Digs & Woosh at Pure Space tonight, then hopefully I'll be awake
enough for Liquid Leo tomorrow and then if I get some sleep Saturday,
Wicked and the new moon party.  I dunno if I still have the endurance
for this scene. ;)

Way out excellent tribal ? rhythms
 played on electronic/natural drums, great vocals from a woman ( who is 
 she ? ) and nice mix of beat oriented ambient tunes. 

The vocals may have been sung by Terra Deva she appears on a CD called SF 
House Culture which I believe is produced by the Dubtribe? Anyways her voice 
is sweet and the CD is nice as well..

Here's an updated phone list, with an entry for every letter of the
alphabet, except Q and V.  Hopefully I'll start maintaining this
on hyperreal, and then you'll be able to get the current one via
ftp or WWW.  Bonus points to everyone who can remember all of these
parties, and grand prize to anyone who's been to all of them. ;)
Someday I'll compile a grand list of every party that's ever been
listed in the calendar...

Subject: Little Boxes on the Dancefloor

On the subject of categories of and labels for music, the following comes to
mind.  Categories can be a heplful tool for distinguishing various parts of the
musical field, and labels can be useful devices for gathering
together musics with similar properties for discussion, promotion, and
discovery.  Categorization, however, is by its very nature a process of
analysis and division, separating various dimensions of the vague musical realm
from each other across lines which are generally arbitrary and often quite
unnatural.  The consequences of these two aspects have become quite clear over
the past few years.  What once was just Rock (a category used originally to
separate it - I imagine - from blues and pop) has fragmented into Metal,
Hip-Hop, Grunge, House, Techno, New Age, Glam, Goth, Ambient, Industrial, etc.,
and all of these realms have further shattered into micro-genres.  Because of 
these tiny domains, marketing and communication becomes far more efficient 
(witness the specificity of zines and net lists), and more types of music are 
allowed to flourish.  But these little regions all to often tend to ghettoize 
music, and to include or exclude recordings or performances based upon a 
definition which soon hardens into a formula - a formula which then becomes a 
law for those who wish to dwell within a given micro-genre.  In this way labels
tend to discourage musical cross-pollenation and to encourage the sort of
inbreeding that produces mediocre and generic music; yet it is that very
cross-pollenation that produces new genres in the first place.  I realize that
this is a paradoxical situation, for here we are in a techno/house forum
which has attracted us precisely because we know what those labels mean.  I
also admit that I generally use the term "ambient" to describe what I do,
dsepite the fact that I dislike what the appearance of that term has started to
do in that area of sound.  With chill rooms and dance floors, the rave scene
provides a setting in which many forms of music come together and coexist
in blissful collage, and I hope that the compulsion to label does not close the
doors that have been opened here.  The highest compliment I can pay a piece of
music these days is to call it "none of the above." <-- Joshua / Thermal

Arghhh.... I've been insulted! =)

Sorry Laura, but I would never consider what I play "happy/disco/diva." I 
though _I_ was the one playing funky/acid house from the late 80s (along 
with lots of Italian/UK trance), unless of course you consider DJ Pierre 
"happy" house....

I think it's just a matter of semantics, but from my perspective, what I
play is as far away from happy/disco/diva house as Richard Hawtin. Well, 
okay, not quite, but I think you should stop by the Sound Factory to get 
the full diva treatment before you accuse me of such a crime again. =)

I second this. I've been listening to Bryce's new tape all week and I 
must say it's wonderful. I suggest that everyone make a special effort to 
come early to watch Bryce spin. I'm sure he'll blow you away.

Sorry Lee . . . but I swear to god I heard happy sounding (i. e. major

I have no idea what any of this music is anymore.

Hello,

Okay, it sounds like what the DJ spins at an event is dictated by the
promoter.  Well then, once again, we need the promoters to supply more
information!

If the listing only says:

" Groovy Thump '94
  At a new location near SFPD HQ
  DJs  Toni  Joe  Glumph
  (415)555-5555      (408)555-5555     (510)555-5555  "

and the recorded message never says anything other than the location or
the map location, and the DJs all have been known to spin a variety of
styles depending on the requirements of the promoter, then you really
don't know if you're going to get happy-house or hard-trance.

Maybe instead we need a listing of recurring events:

Groovy Thump             annual                happy-house
Ride Cymbals Forever     weekly                hard-trance

etc.

respect,

    Ken

if you pull up in a car with california tags, you'll get in for free!

oh and susie forgot to mention that deeelite will also be playing live at 
this event.  we've been trying to contact dubtribe, but they haven't 
returned the call.

from what we've heard about s.f.'s outdoor raves in beautiful locations, 
this will be the first event on the east coast similar to that.  the 
dance fields are right on a lake in a valley between three mountains...

hope some of you can make it.

peace

ComeUnity
was not very expensive 

I'll focus
On friday I had a good time
On saturday I was doing some shopping and I 
dropped by the X-Large store party with nice people
free beer and music.  What was most fun was "touching
base" - catching a little bit of the previous evening's 
mood.  Head bobbing and smiles.  Very mellow.
Some genuine excitement.

This is what I wanted from ComeUnity.
A midweek drop-in.

I got the big room at 1015 Folsom and a 
weekday city bar crowd.  Not drinking.
Just out.  Plenty of dancing.  Social.        
Maybe a bit overly flirtatious.

I heard Simon and Garth.
I was not inspired.  The music was sparse 
and seemed dry.  It was all or nothing.  
Seeing the staff drag an overdose/heat exhaustion victim
through the crowd was sad.

There's a dance cover of the old Doobie Brother's song, the chorus of which
goes "Without love, where would you be now?", which has become my housemate's
holy grail.

If anyone has any clues who it's by, what it's called and/or where to get my
hands on it, 
they would be most appreciated.

Subject: Putting on my OWN rave

HI,

  I am finally getting the opportunity to put on my OWN rave.   I am currently
trying to decide what date to hold the rave.    I want to do everything right,
like have it low cost (To pay for the space usage),   have the right DJ's,  
and have both free food and food available for sale,  such as sandwiches,
and other stuff.

  I want to hold it sometime within a month,  and not have it conflict with
Burning Man,  or Grand Canyon rave.

  I am working through experienced promoters,  that seem to have an incredable
knack for superb organization.   I have had lengthy discussions on every aspect
from paying DJ's and getting sound systems,  to finding spaces.

  So,  please let me know of any preferred dates you think I should pick to
hold it,  sometime a month from now.

More details follows...
John D.

You're probably right. I do like to vary it up. An entire night of minor
keys seems to me a little depressing. =) On the other hand, I remember all
of the DJs before me playing at least one or two "diva" tracks also
(didn't Tamara play a Sade track?). 

> I have no idea what any of this music is anymore.  

Me neither. It's all house to me.... =)

GRAND CANYON MEGA RAVE UPDATE. GOOD NEWS.

Hello all,

This is Andrew Morin of EPIC Productions, I want to update you all 
on the situation regarding the rave near the Grand Canyon. There has 
been talk for several months about the "Grand Canyon Mega Rave" and 
whether the event would actually take place. One of the hang-ups 
was the inability of the World Unity Festival, which the Mega Rave 
was to be associated with, to finalize a site. It appears that this 
hurdle has been overcome. We visited the actual site, which sits 
atop a spectacular Mesa surrounded by the Kaibab National Forest 
which borders the Grand Canyon. There are many obstacles still to 
overcome to produce the event, but things are starting to come 
together. EPIC Productions, in association with Fraser Clark the 
Zippy philosopher, and the World Unity Festival, will be producing 
the event. 

The World Unity Festival begins on August 22 at the Mesa which is 
located approximately 35 miles to the north of Flagstaff, Arizona on 
route 140. The Mega Rave is now scheduled for Wednesday, Thursday, 
Friday and Saturday August 24, 25, 26, and 27. There will be camping 
near the festival as well at National Forest sites in the immediate 
vicinity. I'll be providing additional details about the rave as the 
picture becomes clearer. You can call our information line for 
updates: (415) 905-8800 or (408) 457-4955.

Some people (including the press in Europe and Australia) have been 
calling the Mega Rave the real Woodstock of the 90's.  It really could be an 
amazing event . Spread the word and lets make it happen! 

Love,
Andrew

Ken, you STILL don't get it.  What doesn't apply to DJs as far as
labeling definitely does not apply to events.  Furthermore, events
come and go so quickly and the names change so frequently that it
seems hardly worth the effort to put together some kind of permanent
comprehensive list.  The sf-raves calendar is the best and most
complete current guide I know of for the Bay Area (by FAR), but even
in spite of diligent upkeep by Derek it isn't and can't be completely
accurate.  

Most of all, what I object to is the paint-by-numbers approach to this.
"Oh, it says here COSMIC FOOFOO is happy diva hardcore, that sounds OK
to me!"  The musical identity of each event is complex and derives as
much from the attitude of the crowd and the characteristics of the space
as from what the DJs are playing.  I've heard DJs play nearly identical
sets in different places and come away thinking the experience was 
considerably different overall.  I don't mind broad generalizations --
what they do at Sound Factory is NOT happy diva hardcore, I suppose :-)
And while at least a little bit of an idea about the differences in
the various events is helpful, I don't believe that this is supposed to
be a shopping mall experience.  There is no Orange Julius or Foot Locker
of the house/rave/techno/hiphop/industrial/whatever scene, where you
know exactly what you're going to get when you walk in the door.

I LIKE it that way, even if it leads to unachieved expectations a good
portion of the time.

Well, I know this is kinda late.  I expect much "seen it/ dunnit/ sawit/ 
" and so forth but here goes.

I'm fairly new here and havn't met anybody on this list, but still we had 
a good time at Anthem of the Sun.  Totally warm vibes everywhere.  I was 
under the impression that they (the people who put it on) had all their 
ducks in order; as they even had their security personnel trying to keep 
everybody mellow.  This was my FIRST event and I thought it was a blast!  
I really didn't know what to expect, but I was impressed.  The lazers 
were the BEST I have EVER seen!!! (now these may be nothing compared to 
what some of you have been to).  The fog worked well too, it didn;t plug 
up my lungs like some places do (Slim's).  At one point, we were 
near the front and almost were zapped by that red laser-sight thing 
that hit some woman's water bottle on her head!  Everyone seemed 
appreciative 
of the music, but I have a couple things I'm not clear on.  First, I 
think there's got to be a way to find out WHO is WHO; there were so many 
DJ's there that I'd be cool to know who each one was so we newcomers can 
identify with them and get a feel for what they spin and how.  Also, we 
couldn't find the chill room w/ ambient music; I was hoping to see what 
one was like, but there's always next time.  

I'm glad I didn't forget to bring my own water.  But overall we had a 
good time, dancing the night away.  We must have left just before it was 
busted up, but one person who drives a group has the most power and when 
he/she gets tired, everyone else can't do much but to aquiesce or walk home!

Any more suggestions for us rookies out there?

Since this was my first, how should one rate a sound system?  What does 
one look for as it sounded great to me; I could hear rumbling bass and 
high tweeters...

You know, I appreciate the fact that there is a high potential for cool 
stuff to happen during those 3-4 days, but despite the hype that has been 
generated regarding this so-called megarave on the net,in XLR8R mag, and 
many other places, there have been no firm details regarding a rave at all.
How are those of us who don't live near the grand canyon expected to make 
the TIME and FINANCIAL commitment to head down there...?  Spread the word?
About WHAT?  If I am going to drive or fly all the way down there (and 
I'm sure this is the case with many of us), I want to know for certain 
that there will be a "mega rave", because I certainly wouldn't want to 
travel that far to listen to philosophy and wander through a new-age arts 
festival--I can do that here in Washington (no flame intended).

I think the only thing that will help *Ken Get It* is
to have Ken go to a rave!  ken in his last public post
to me and sfr put in a slam at me saying that *I* was
the one requiring people to pass a litmus test of drug
use to qualify as ravers ( a*real* acid test!). WRONG!

Ken, you never answer us about why we don't see you at
raves, why you're just this little fly in the cyber pigment,
why you rant so about raving.  Come out of the tiger closet
and rave, man! I don't give a damn anymore that you never had
the civility to answer my posts to you privately; I'm concerned
now about the salvation of your eternal soul!  Get off the left
brain soapbox of classifications and justifications and actually
*embrace* those "11 Signs and Synbols of Inner Peace" you love
so much aned *come out and rave*!

Categories, smategories!  You didn't like me talking about 
gays, drugs, wondering what *you* meant by dj classifications!
Let go, man! Fly! Dance!F***ing Rave!

ciao fornow,

Look for the same things you'd look for in a good stereo system.:

Bass should be tight and have lots of punch, but should not be muddy.
If they turn up the bass too high, it reverberates off the walls and
every song sounds like a 5 engine locomotive going by. Not good.
Strong, clear bass defines the beats.

Mid and highs should be clear--but not screeching. You should be able
to stand *somewhere* and hear a good stereo image. That makes for good
tweak factor :). I'm starting to really believe in putting mid-high
cabinets over the crowd and aiming them down because highs don't "go
around". They're pretty much stopped by people in front of the
cabinets.

The sound should be loud, but you shouldn't need earplugs. Some mostly
deaf DJs and promoters don't seem to understand this. That's why
they're deaf. Responsible promoters don't turn it up to hearing-damage
levels.

 Hey Will - having a tough week ? I hope we have some good gatherings
 to smooth the "wrinkles in our brains" :-)  

 For myself I'm having trouble with classifying the music much less the
 DJ's. I'm buying as much of the stuff as I can absorb ( and afford ! )
 but I like to buy stuff I really like... stuff with lots of spacey 
 electronics. 

 I just bought Behind the Eye: Eye Q Comp Vol 1 and just love it. There's
 even a song on it I've heard a DJ spin but for the life of me I would
 not be able to even guess as to the record classification. If Ken or
 anyone else wants to classifiy things I would prefer more references to
 music that is available - what's hot (and why) or what's just so-so. 
 Right now I'm a candidate for becoming a major "train spotter" but then
 that's because I'm really into prusuing the music - both live, DJ'ed and
 at home....

 Later

Grand Canion Rave will not be as big as BURNING MAN but if a lot of 
people do show up it will probably be up to the SPAZ and Santa Cruz crews 
to entertain everybody expecting MEGA-RAVE 

Groove Kitchen at Russian river will be beautiful ...we too will be using 
that spot in October. There is an Indian Burial ground which needs 
reclaiming near by so lets groove with respect and maybe we can reuse the 
spot to raise money for that purpose.

Tribal Funk had a chill "room" at the 24th and illinois location last friday
Flash and colin threw a nice one! 

Geoff white is still not subscribing but word is he bought turntables!

salutations, allen@ameba

Hey all, I've just been through a really rough time in which I lost
my job (though no fault of my own) and in which I contracted the worst
case of poison oak (from the 2nd site of the "Zippy" party) that the 
doctor at UCSF Medical Center Acute Care Clinic had ever seen.  Anyway,
my job hunt is going really well and the doctor put me on steroid/antibiotic
treatment and my skin is starting to heal.  I'm telling you all this because 
I'm suddenly BURSTING with positive energy and am looking forward to 
tonight's  LIQUID LEO party!

Last night Bryce, Susie, Cyril, and I went to look at the site.  We feel
pretty positive about it and it has nice amenities like lots of easy
parking, a nearby porta-potty, and is sufficiently hidden from sight yet
affords interesting scenic views.  It's Bryce's Birthday and he's stoked
to give us a good set, and if Ethan's set from the Santa Cruz party is
any indication of what he's into now, we are in for the technotrance trip
into space.

So, even though my skin looks bad I'm huggable and NOT contagious.  Come
on out and say HI, if you're a lurker and want to meet some sfravers please
join us and we'll make sure you get introduced around.

Logistics:  call the Liquid line at (415) - 985 - 5244 after 10 for
directions.  We'd like people to arrive starting at 12:30.  Please
park quickly and quietly and quickly get our of your cars and up to
the site.  You can also finger my account for directions after 10 tonight.

Aside from Ethan and Bryce we'll be featuring our main man of smooth
groove Lee An, and I'll bring my records along too.

See you later,

Laura

Glad you had a good time at the party.  I probably would have had a blast 
if that was one of my first parties, too.  Not to detract from what you 
were saying, or nothing, just that I had heard the party got busted at 
3am and everyone paid $20 and some people confronted those disgusting 
GOONS there.  As for identifying a good sound system, I would say that 
you really just have to go to a bunch of parties and see for yourself 
what a good sound system is really like.  you will know it is good when 
it is loud but not distorted or piercing your eardrums 9bring earplugs!0  
Anyway, if you have any other questions about raves or oregano, please 
don't hesitate to make them available to the sfr community!!!!!!!!!!!!

On a day off I had, I decided to watch tv and channel flip..

First I was flipping through the soap operas and the word "e-mail" was used..
I flipped back and the people on the tv show had an argument and 
complained that they should check their e-mail more often for things that 
are going on and if they have a complaint then e-mail them...

Second thing I saw was on MTV news.. In an incident in Rockwell, TX 
someone was arrested or something (I didnt catch it all) and the main 
thing I heard was that they are now testing the Plastikman album for LSD.

In response to your post about the music being mostly beat at ComeUnity 
party, I think it is an ongoing phase.  The real dj's in the scene seem 
to be playing more music with beats and less synth.  Of course, that's 
just a supposition.

Do we really want to get Richie arrested?  If he were to end up going to jail
for this I swear I will organize all the mw-ravers (Mid West) I know and
stage a rave-in demonstration in front of whatever place in Detriot holds
the court and/or jail.

Don't worry about it, you need not give only half a smile... :-)

But I'm sure he could take his 303 with him, just as long as kind 
wireheads smuggle in batteries....

Well, he's obviously referring to DJs who do not actually exist.  
Possibly these are the DJs that sometimes appear on flyers yet never 
actually make it to the party.  And you *know* those are the hippest of 
them all.

Hey Laura!  I feel sorry for you cause I know first hand how bad poison oak
can be...the itchingggggggg!!!  I do not know the details of how you caught
yours but hear this, you will get a laugh out of it, if nothing else.  I
once was hiking in the bushes and had to go for a whiz!  Well on the way
off the trail I'm sure I got a hand full of the famous herb on my hands.
Now you can guess what happened a day later.  Well, I thought the Lord had
blessed me and given me a brand new, much larger peice of equipment like
you wouldn't believe.  How disgusting....  Anyway hope you're doing much
better.

I will not be able to join all of you at Liquid Leo tonight.  Sounds like
it's going to be a lot of fun.  Well if I can get back in the area early
enough maybe I'll go for a few songs.  But just in case, I just wanted to
say "Happy Birhtday Bryce" and also to all the other Leo's out there.  Have
a wild, crazy and safe party.  (I'll be at F&FIII for sure)

I just heard about a warehouse dance party tonight going on from
about 10 to 5.  But... this is from a friend who never goes
raving and he just passed on the message from his other friends
who are ravers.  What does it mean?
It means that I can't be held responsible as to the legitimacy
of these instructions, as clear and direct as they are.
But, if you're bored in Santa Cruz and want to try.
"Go down river st. until you get to the third street to the
left.  This streeet begins with an E.  ummm.. Ensal? (These are
the directions as they were relayed to me, I think her means third
street onvce river turns into hwy 9.  So you).  Take that left, go down
one block and turn right on post.  Then just go down a little bit
and there's a bargain barn on the left, and a warehouse on the right.
That's the place.  "  soooo... easier than driving up to a failed
party at Bonny Doon even.
Good luck... I think I will try it around midnight or so.
If you're in the area... there's also a small house party going on
at my house  and uh a few of you locals are invited.  Although not
rave atmosphere specifically, as my other two housemates aren't
"really into that strange stuff", it's friendly and something to 
bump your head into a couple of times.  This is 316 Ocean St.
now how wise is that.. giving away my home address... well...
probably not too unwise as it's already nine and I doubt too many of you will 
see this before it's too late.  Such is life.
Anyway... good night all and jhappy being ...

zzz.... What I said was (paraphrased):

What is your NEXT step - requiring sfravers to provide a substance abuse 
test with positive results?

MEANING that - since you require people who post to sfraves to prove to you 
that they've attended raves, then who knows what else you will require them 
to validate.

All this was in my original post as above.

I think it is time for you to find mail reading software that QUOTES the 
message you are replying to, so you have it right there to look at, AND so 
that others reading it can see the original and the reply.

>Ken, you never answer us about why we don't see you at

How do you know that you don't see me??

I posted an entire post to sfraves about this.  I'm still waiting for a 
convincing POSITIVE reason to tie e-mail addresses to physical bodies.
(To reiterate, I go to an event, I talk to someone, if we want to talk 
later on, we exchange phone numbers, or if the person has one, e-mail 
addresses -- why should this be done in the reverse direction??)

And, who is this "us"?  Or is this the royal "we"? :-)

> I don't give a damn anymore that you never had
>the civility to answer my posts to you privately;

I sent you a private e-mail message that I had not received any private
e-mail messages that I had not responded to. :-) :-) 
Clearly you didn't get that one either. :-)
This site is the sixth one I've tried in the last year; I think that 
Internet e-mail reliability is an unattainable mirage. :-)
(Tigerteam is down for the weekend, completely revamping their software.)

To repeat what I said in the private e-mail message, please send me the 
topics of any private e-mail for which you didn't receive a response.

So far, this site has worked, so send it here. :-)

>I'm concerned now about the salvation of your eternal soul!

No concerns needed there, thank you!

>Get off the left brain soapbox of classifications and justifications.

Since I'm not much of a poet, there's not much I can put on sfraves from 
the right brain.  (Although I'm hoping to have some .MOD or .WAV files 
from the right brain by the end of the year to upload somewhere. Hmmm, not 
a bad track title - "Right Brain Soapbox".)

>Categories, smategories!  You didn't like me talking about 
>gays, drugs, wondering what *you* meant by dj classifications!

Excuse me?  Can you show me a quote where I stated that I didn't like you 
talking about those things??  Say whatever you want!  

>Let go, man! Fly! Dance!F***ing Rave!

Every chance I get!

PS I'd like to encourage anyone else who objects to the content of my posts 
to let me know, either in e-mail or by posting.  Thanks!

Greetings!  My sincere and deep apologies to all who attended or tried
to attend Liquid Leo.  Twenty-one people were cited for violation of
a curfew law.  The officers claimed we were in the park illegally, though
no signs were posted stating that.  We did, however, get a few songs, and
I was just starting to get into a groove when we were visited.

I must say that everyone who was there reacted very well, making as
happy an occasion as possible, talking geek-talk with the officers,
helping pack up, and so forth.  Thanks for the gifts of upside down
cake (literally), roses, cookies, and more...everyone shared their
things, and made as good a time of it as possible.

after i post this, i will be setting up a mailing list on Ultima to
discuss this, strategize, bitch, rejoice, whatever.  It will be run
by majordomo, so sending a one line msg of "subscribe oyster-gate"
will do the trick.

Oh, and i think it's important that no one ever try to do an event at
that site again: Oyster Bay Regional Shoreline.

Again, my apologies.  I'll try to make it up to you all.  And thanks for
all the birthday best wishes...you all really touched my heart.

Followup to the Santa Cruz party.

It worked!  Not only did I have a cool party at my house with
10-20 people dancing pretty hard until 3am, with no neighbor
or police interactions.... but also the warehouse party had
a good crowd of 40+ people when I got there at 3:30, a nice crisp
unmuddled sound system, and a good floor.  You know, floors are
important... solid, good traction, trippy black and white patterns...
DJ had the right attitude, even if he couldn't beat match very well,
I forgot his name as I was very tired... but he was responsible for
the whole thing and he is going to try to hold them every week.
Same place.  Main problems were that the place was sort'f small, not
enough people to make it crowded though, but enough to make it pretty
warm inside.  I'll go so far as to say hot.  So if you decide to try
it next week bring cool clothing and water water water.  He's
charging $5 a month, charging on one weekend a month.  It's a wonderful
thing to happen to Santa Cruz, for those quiet friday nights.
So... what more can I say.

So are people going to Wicked or Ex-Why-ZZZ tonight?

warm saturdays....

-john.

no comments about the "issues" being discussed, but a personal

I'll be doing another of my occasional on-air excursions this coming
Monday (actually, early Tuesday morning the 9th) on KBOO 90.7 FM
(Portland), from around 2:30 to 5:30 am.  The regular occupant of
that spot, my friend Jan Celt, has generously offered to let me play
*anything I want*.  Heh :)  Suffice it to say it will be housey-
trancey-technoey.  Might throw in some dub too . . .

Hi!  Does anybody need a place to live or knows somebody looking?

My room-mate's getting married & is moving in with her fiance late August/
early September.  So....I am looking for somebody to move in here.

The place is:  El Cerrito close to Plaza BART & is just a quick
		drive from 80 and 580..perfect for late-nite excursions
		to distant events
		(oh yeah, um, 20 min bike ride to UC, 5 min walk to
		Plaza BART, just two stops from Berkeley)

The rent is;  $387.50/ month, with $500 deposit. 

Pets:		cats, snakes, fish, maybe a dog? Cat already in residence
		(cat has attitude)

Neighborhood:	hardworking, suspiciously quiet, home-owning, apt-dwelling,
		unpretentious El Cerrito.  sometimes foggy, sometimes hot
		hot hot.  apt is in a four-unit complex, neighbors are good
		people.

Me:		28, molecular biology student at Cal, pretty clean, pretty
		neat, pretty mellow.  my only hangup:  please no tv in 
		the common space..but lots of music!

If you are interested, email me with your phone number and I'll call you
within a day, for sure.  Move-in date is flexible, oh, and there's a lot
of storage space, if needed.  I have no preferences with regard to gender,
race or age.  Unfortunately, to get into the place you have to go over a
step & so MIGHT be made wheelchair accessible.  


thanks,

annthrax

 By request from Denis 

 WBL plays Gaia Mantra - the sun shines in SF - the day was HOT !

 After the appropriate setup, warm up of the analogs, tunings and other
 preps the show went on with ~ 20 people or so wandering in and out.

 Nice analog ambient performance. LFO's oscilating, waveforms forming,
 brains rotating around their stems. Good group of people sharing fun
 vibes... and the price was right...

 A good time was had by all and Even as I type my music partner is
 messing with my mind by playing "analog madness" through massive
 processing. The performance of WBL has inspired me to add a heavily
 analog/processed ambient work to our works in process. When I hear
 good stuff I get inspired and I heard good stuff yesterday !


 PS Good to meet you Cindy and glad to see you out and about Ethan. To
    others I talked with -  great day wasn't it ?

thanks to everyone who helped out with my paper on ambient music!
but, too much observation and not enough participation  plagues this 
social "scientist" like a bad hair cut...
therefore, I personally invite everyone to tonight's new moon party where 
myself and fellow Earth-boy Scottie will present the "mother Earth sound 
system ambient experience" in a tag-team style.  We're opening (i 
believe) so come early and come often.

peace to ya mind in da summertime,
whitsitt

p.s. tho i've been generally down on the internet (something about 
wanting real, not virtual, community and un-mediated experience), you 
sfraves folks have proven to me that you can indeed transmit the love 
vibe over electronic means. thanks...

'Long Train Running' by the Doobie Brothers. (Remix, not a cover.) This was
re-released both in '92 or '93 and in '94 with different mixes, althought
the commonly heard one (the Ben Liebrand Full Guitar mix) is on both
re-releases.

Wicked
was fairly expensive ... 
I think this is the most I have paid for a party in about 2 years
A cup of ice was free.  Water was a few dollars.

It was about 1:00 and the line was long.
I may have waited with the honorable and former sfr entertainer
John S Lee.  I am not sure though.  

It was packed, hot, and loud.  There was a cool hallway exit and a very hot
and smoky balcony.  Behind the dj and to the sides of the bar were little
areas where the sound was nice.  The sound was decent everywhere.  

People were cute and older.  
Diverse, with a mix of serious 
tshirt ravers and more fabulous clubby types.  
It was not a super "feel me/share with me" crowd.
(Although I did bum a smoke and a mint!)
I can see how the combination of all of this could be interpreted
as being colder or even rude compared to the hug fests that some 
parties are.  I thought it was great.

I danced with people I hadn't seen since going to the short lived zendada
a few months ago. I suppose you might call them the wicked posse.
I am not sure though. ;)  It was very fun.  You get the coolest feeling 
when you see people who have moved you before.  The obvious, I guess.
A greater hope for the morning, definitely.

I did a strange little jig with some really tall muscular pierced guy and
his friend.  He shook my hand when it was over.  In fact, this encounter was
typical for the evening.  As the music moved from the beat focused (all you need)
stuff back into richer sounding (what you want) pieces it got wierder.  
(pardon my parenthetical House mantras ...)
anyway, this may have been Jeno  
heavy on the Dramatic breaks and frog noises.

There is an excellent sense of timing, a feeling of 
experience, dancing with the Wise.  
I had fun playing along.

Overall, this was probably a pretty average Wicked.  
Dave

Yeah, Wicked was wicked, is wicked, will be wicked..  I really missed those
guys while they were gone.  Quite a few "tourists" early on, but as usual
they disappeared sometime after Jeno started up - it really felt like two
distinctly different parties with a very clear switch, though that might have
been me :-).  I was rockin' too hard to hug anyone till it was over as were
most, but there were definately some friendly hugs/goodbyes at the end.  I
brought a couple people who had never been to a Wicked before and they
couldn't shut up all day sunday about what an amazingly great time they had.
 What is that song with the frogs anyway? I gotta have it.

The only track I know of with frogs on it is 'Tree Frog' by Hope, which
to my knowledge was first released on a Belgian label last fall and has
been relicensed and rereleased several times.  Has a sort of chugging
beat with a voiceover, "It's getting closer," interspersed with frog
noises.  Very catchy.  I played it, if memory serves, at either the
first F&F or at the Berkeley party in February.  At the time it seemed
like more or less a novelty track (but with more character than other
'novelty' items like the recent 'Swamp Thing' by The Grid which I detest).
However, I note it's charting very highly both here and in the UK which
means it caught on without any serious promotion and that means a BIG
response from DJs and dance floors.  And so it goes.

Anyway, if it's NOT that one, I'd sure like to know!

I just got this in the mail from Mute:

Plastikman's Sheet One A Case of Mistaken Identity

New York, NY -- On Monday, July 27, a 20 year old in Rockwall, Texas
(just outside Dallas) on his way to visit his girlfriend in the next
town was pulled over by the police for speeding.  He was asked to step
outside the car so the police could search it.

Inside the car, the police found was NovaMute Records' Plastikman Sheet
One CD.  Apparently believeing that the perforated artwork of the CD
booklet might contain "controlled substances", the young man was arrested
and booked on suspicion of "possession of a controlled substance."  This
charge is considered a 2nd degree felony/schedule 1, that means the 
punishment can be 2-20 years with up to a $10,000 fine.

The young man's father called Mute Records New York office for help in
trying to convince the police the CD booklet was artwork.  Mute Records
couriered a sealed shrink-wrapped CD to the father to show to the police.

The young man spent 5 1/2 days in jail and was released this past weekend
on $5500 bail, and a trial date has now been set for August 23rd.  Currently
the polic are testing the CD booklet in a lab.  Results will not be ready
for three weeks.

PLASTIKMAN is Richie Hawtin, one of the most revered figures in the global
techno underground.  He is the founder of +8 Records and the man behind
F.U.S.E. and Circuit Breaker.  Richie Hawtin is also known as one of the
world's top DJs for his trance, ambient techno music.  PLASTIKMAN's
Sheet One is a trip through the highlights of the electronic underground.
Mind music for the post-acid generation.

At press time, it is unclear whether NovaMute Records will include this
artwork in future PLASTIKMAN Sheet One CDs.

Ben Liebrand did the '89 remix of M's "Pop Muzik".  He sure does get around,

So the Wicked location was the King Street Garage that I keep hearing 
about?  It seemed more like a club to me as far as all the architecture.  
This has got to be one of the sweatiest venues yet.  I would agree that 
some of the good places to dance were right next/behind the DJ tables and 
in the two corners at the sides of the bar.  The only problem I had was 
in the the corner on the left of the bar the floor was always very 
slippery.  I am assuming this was sweat condensing off the big parachute 
they hung off the celing... but boy was it wiggly.  Speaking of celings I 
really feel sorry for whoever has to put up those "wicked nets" every 
time, they must be so nappy!  But they're always there.
One thing I notice about Wicked is that the people are all there to get 
down and feel the music and dance.  I always get that feeling and it's 
always so satisfying to see so many people at once hooting and cheering 
in response to a _feeling_ .  I mean I've seen people cheer when 
they see something blow up or change into a bunny, but rarely when they all 
"just feel like it".  Thanks Wicked.

what's that Drip Drip song I always hear?

Can anyone tell me who did that remix of Carmina Burana (originally composed by
Carl Orff)?  I caught it late one night and thought it might be a cool present

Name of the track is 'O, Fortuna', I believe, but I've forgotten who the 
artist is.

if i remember right, it's the first track off of a compilation disc entitled
"Rave 'Till Dawn"...
i don't know who did it, but the disc is fairly easy to find.

Greetings Friends!

Just wanted to give everyone an informational and philosophical update 
on the upcoming Friends & Family which will be in SF this Saturday, 
August the 13th.

As you may know, F&F has always been a conscious attempt to provide a
smaller and more intimate alternative to the larger scale and often more
expensive traditional SF fare. Towards this end, certain things are, and
will continue to be, important to us. 

Primary amonsgt these is that this party be a collaborative, cooperative
effort. Experience has shown that nothing generates vibe like the
collective interaction of as many different creative people as possible. I
hasten to stress that this does not apply solely to 'peformers'; no party
is a party without the people who simply come to the party...as someone
that comes to this party, your input, suggestions and criticisms are
welcome before, during and after the party. On a larger scale, F&F
continues to evolve with parties roughly every six weeks, so if you want to
be a part of it, in any way shape or form, please let us know, we'd love to
have ya :)

Next is that F&F be home to a broad variety of dance and listening music
both intra-, and inter-event. We make it a point of including in every
party djs that will play: ambient and other forms of experimental
electronic music, djs that will play house, djs that will play trance, and
yes, djs that will play that poor bastard stepchild of the sf scene: techno
:) 

We are also going to make it a point to provide air time for evolving
talent. Every party will feature at least one, if not two djs or musicians
you have probably not heard before. 

As I mentioned above one of the other chief goals of this party is that it
be as inexpensive as possible. The arrangement we have with Komotion (the
space that houses this party) is that the party is a benfit for the space
(I have attached Komotion's blurb at the end of this post in case you're
interested). This one will support the audio and print magazine they
publish which, in my estimation, is fantastic material. Please seek it out;
you will enjoy it, in addition to which submissions are welcome so if you
have something to say consider it as a forum :). Future parties will go
towards making some improvements to the space though we would also like to
to do benefits for other worthy causes; suggestions are welcome. But in any
event, the $3 donation requested at the door is the bare minimum needed to
meet our costs and and the space's. As a matter of policy everyone involved
in the party works for free.

Lastly, one of the things that brings me the greatest joy about this party
and the ones that have preceded it is that they are sfr parties! With the
exception of Galen *every single person* involved is from sfr! Right On.

Okay now some specifics:

This party kicks off with the debut of Sean Casey. So come early and show
your support for new musical blood in the scene! We'll also get to hear
Giamma (who I haven't heard since the first F&F) who will finish the party
off with some house grooves in the morning :) Jon D returns with his hard
and often fiendish musical mayhem, Lee's gonna roll some trance, I'm gonna
spin some techno/trance and our Friend Galen from sunset will join us and
play... whatever he feels like :) John Howard has, unfortunately,
cancelled.

Doin the do in the multimedia, might-be-ambient, could-be-a-chillroom,
lounge, planet six is gonna get it goin, next is freezer of noc/noc fame
followed by Weird Blinking Lights who's new CD is a must-have. Next our
very own HDW who has indicated to me that he intends to twist our minds in
no uncertain fashion +) Mohsen will also join us. M, it turns out, will be
covering Woodstock for the Well, we'll miss her, Ovid may still do
something...

Visuals by our own Michael Clay and others (yes! yet more collaboration...)
Lasers by Sean Casey...
Audio by soundvision and the liquid sound system :)

There's still plenty of room for participation so if you wanna bring alter
materials, body paint, day glow string, additonal lighting, or a nude guy
or gal please feel free :)

This party is *all* ages, everyone is welcome! We will however enforce a
strict dress code: no one in long pants will be admitted. Thank you for
your cooperation in this matter.  +)

Komotion is located at 16th & Folsom in sf
party goes from 10pm til 7am
cost $3
additional info: 415.985.5244

looking forward to seeing you all there!
lots of love
ethan.


Komotion Blurb:

Komotion is an artist's collective, an alternative, an experiment. We are a
diverse group of musicians, writers, artists and engineers seeking to
create an environment that inspires and informs. Our multi-purpose arts
center is home to some 40 musicians who perform, rehearse and record here.
Our evening events, run by all-volunteer labor, are adventurous and bring
forward special talent. We have presented music of all kinds, art, poetry,
film, theatre, video and dance, as well as hosted numerous benefits. Our
engineers produce many recordings by emerging Bay Area artists in our
16-track studio. A core of writers works on our magazine, which provides a
forum for debate around cultural and political issues.

Komotion doesn't pay the performers at its events except to cover their
expenses. The door charge, drink prices, etc. are so low that in general,
we can only cover the rent and the basic expenses out of the events. Even
without money, however, many new acts and established artists have chosen
to perform here. Being artists ourselves, we put great care into the sound
and other aspects of the facility, to create the best possible experience
for performer and audience alike. The actual scheduling of events, editing
of the magazine, etc., is sone by committtee in a kind of anarchistic
fashion. We find things to be livelier with as few rules as possible.

Komotion has a current membership of about 300 locally and another 100 or
so internationally. At this point, our events are not "membership only" but

I hope Hawtin *does* put these sheets into further releases. For that
matter, let's start doing all our flyers in corrugated cardboard
artwork. Staple them to telephone poles :). Anything to frustrate

for quite some time i have wanted to do this,
the problem being that i didnt want people going around saying
"you know, man... MOST of the flyers are real,
but they did actually did about 30 of them..."
or somethng like that

and puttign a dislaimer on it would kinda bite too

AND, if anyone got arrested and spent 5 days in jail for
something i did.. that would be rather depressing

but i would really like a lot of people with blotter or other stuff
that is perfectly harmles so that it makes it more difficult
for police to discriminate
(just like i think people should smoke tobacco out of bongs
so that there would be like 50 bongs on the street
and if 5 of them didnt have tobacco....)

There's a new remix of 'Feet' by the Sandals out domestically that slows
down with a funky breakbeat and has quite a few breaks with frogs.

Scotto came over and I thought I give him the opportunity, him
being net impaired and all :), to say hello.

****************insert scotto text here***************

Hi! First off, I am completely computer illiterate, but try to be
talented in other ways. Please bear with me as I am a virgin on
these machines. So here's the story before the book, pay-per-view,
documentary, and movie come out; SCOTTO STYLE.

A couple of years ago, lady Kier from Dee-lite and the Drop
Collective were passing around some ideals (and a joint) about the
future of "techno" and "house" in Rock-n-Roll Amerikka.  We came up
with the ultimate party RAVESTOCK.

After visiting her lawyer who also is Michael Lang's (woodstock),
we were advised of plans for W 2 and a potential lawsuit if the
rave were to take place. By that time, I had set the press wheels
in motion, (Details Jan "93). So after constant proposals, faxes,
phone calls, it came together about 12 days ago (a year later than
planned).  This was partially due to our prior relationship with
Metropolitan when they supported MASKARAVE 2 , part of the See the
Light Tour featuring Moby, Orbital, Aphex Twin, and Vapourspace.
There were 5,000. Also, the ORB simultaneously put in proposals to
Polygram/Woodstock et all. The most ridiculous part of this is the
lack of time and budget provided. At any rate, flyers are out, and,
it's happening.

We don't claim to be perfect. Events have conspired, in the past to
fuck up our events, and we have made some mistakes. But our
intention is, was and always will be to produce events that create
an environment that supports our community and that our community
supports. The ORB canceled a european date at a huge festival to be
with us @ RaveStock, Orbital has to fly in from london and fly
right the fuck out to france. AphexTwin has been true to the
underground vibe and he's with us. The Dj line up represents a
cross section of our styles, each of them respected. Frankie Bones,
legendary hardcore from Brooklyn; Keven Sauderson, a father of the
detroit techno scene; Doc Martin; fierceness personified from
LA/SF;Little Louis Vega has been house since before it was house
and Dimitry, from Dee-lite has been with us since our days at The
Red Zone and The World. DJs Louis and Alex Paterson represent some
of the best of the UK scene.

The Drop Collective with Liquid Sky Music (Soul Slinger) will
showcase new talent. Breakbeat and Jungle Vibes will close this
mutha event on Sunday.......Monday........whenever.......:)


NOW THE IMPORTANT PART--YOUR INVOLVEMENT  PART ONE

We are the next generation, right? We must show the rock-n-roll
folk what's up for the NEXT 25 YEARS and we MUST COME TOGETHER in
our love for electronic dance music and in the spirit of PLUR and
community support the future sounds. One of our goals has always
been to expand into mainstream (just enough) to "convert" heads
open the doors of consciousness, art and the spirit of community.


YOUR INVOLVEMENT PART TWO

If you are from the first Woodstock, or that generation of love,
you have the most crucial role of all. See, our generation looks
back at all the nostalgia, hype, myth, and the hopes and dreams of
an era of great social change.  But look at the 80's, look at what
hasn't changed. NOW we all could have a second chance, a second
revolution with your guidance and love. TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL,
teach us the whole deal and TOGETHER, IT WILL HAPPEN!
What will happen, you ask? Remember you are the baby boomers,
right?  Well we are the Babies of the Baby Boomers, so there's MORE
of us PLUS Ya'll. So what could happen....Legal Hemp, A different
government, an environmental political party,a sexual revolution?
I don't know. What I do know is that our generation is partly lost,
definitely confused, and we could use some guidance from those
who've been through a little bit more.

One last point, 25 years ago Woodstock peaked and probably hurt a
growing festival movement that basically died in Amerikka. It has
been thriving in EUROPE for years, and with the help of The Techno
scene, maybe, just maybe, Woodstock 2 could help launch another
wave of festivals here to spread the vibe 90's style and bridge the
barriers of racism, abuse, and empower a whole generation.
Woodstock '94 will define our generation and its the ideal vehicle
to introduce electronic dance music to a broad audience. It's set
to be the largest rave ever with 250,000 expected to attend
(175,000 tickets sold as of today) and millions more attending
virtually on PPV and on the net.

Thanks for listening to my rave :)
peace
Scotto

Subject: Results of the Raving and Sexual love survey
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Here are the results of a survey that I posted several months ago to the list.
Just to remind everyone, here is the original post...



	It seems that this subject has never really been explored
	here on sfraves but I think if there ever was a place to talk
	about raving and sex/love this would be it.  First a few qualifiers,
	I'm using the term sexualove to try to be a little more accurate
	and to also side step some flames.  Sexualove is that special energy
	that you feel for (an)other(s) that would or could reach expression
	in a physical (sexual) way.  It doesn't mean that you have to actually
	"have sex" (but it could) but it is a "deeper" feeling then just the
	"platonic" emotions that have readily been shared.

	My questions are:

	1) How has your sex/love life, capacity, expression, etc. changed
	since you have been raving?

	2) For people who are single, do you find it easier or harder to get
	into a sexualove relationship now that you are a raver?

	3) For people in committed relationships, how has raving changed your
	sexualove cycles/behavior?

	4) Is making love to another raver "different" than making love to
	a "non-raver"?

	5) Does the Eros that is generated at some parties (like a Wicked)
	excite you or is it a turn off?

	6) Since you have become a raver, do you think that you are more or less
	open to exploring other sexualove lifestyles then the one you are
	currently practicing?

	7) Do you think ravers are more tolerant of other people's sexualove
	preferences?

	8) If you are at a party and the music is _really_ goin-off and
	a friend comes up to you (that you've wanted for sometime, I
	might add) and wants you to go with them to the chill-out room
	(obviously to make- out); do you go with them or do you stay on the
	dance-floor?

	9) For those of you who trance, how has this affected your sexualove
	life?  Do you enter trance states more easily while making love?  Does
	it get in the way of meeting perspective partners at a party (as in
	you look pretty funny with your eyes crossed :)

	10) How many of you now (or have) made love to music (house or
	otherwise) and how has this experience affected you?


I know some of these questions are pretty intimate, you can use some 
anonymous mailers to reply, if you don't want anyone to know who you are.

All in all 16 people actually replied with answers:

11  Males
3   females
2   I couldn't tell from the post


Here are some excerpts that don't quit fit anywhere else...

The year I was a heavy raver, I wasn't really
trying to use raves as a hunting ground for babes... and in
fact I think I was really relieved at the relatively
a-sexual quality of raves.  I'd spent a few years hanging
around in the club scene, and the intense defensiveness of
women in that meat-market type scene could really be a drag.
One of the cool things about raves is that people seemed
more focused on a "just be where you are" kind of attitude,
and not so much worrying about where they're going to wind
up that night. 

One way you might look at it, if you've got your love
phasers focused on just one person, you don't get to
experience and add to the group vibe that raves are about. 

If this is true, then what it really means is that raving by
itself can't really be a complete existence in itself.
There's got to be something else you're into, some other
social structures you're involved with.  It is a shame that
what you might call the existing courtship customs of this
culture are so inadequate, but it is a young culture after
all... only several decades since the death of the
Fifties...

========

Personally, one of the great draws of techno/rave music has been the tantric
rush I get from the big sub-bass slam beat. When I am dancing or listening
and move into a trance state, it seems to be always more grounded in the
earthy/sexual side of the spirit/soul than the lofty/religious ecstacy of
perhaps the Sufi trance dancers. Actually, I'm not that sure that these mind
sets are really that far apart, both being expressions of love and devotion
in their own ways...

As for making love to trance/dance/techno, I have unfortunately found few
partners in the last 20 years or so who were as interested as I in bedding
down to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, or Music for Airports, or any of the many
others disks in the library of this sort...(one girlfriend even complained
that Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" had too come off the turntable one evening
because it was 'too compelling'...funny, I thought that was the whole point
of having the stereo on whilst in bed...


=======

Hi Geoff,
  I'm sorry I didn't answer your questionairre..
i've been way busy..
But just an observation..A lot of the current crop of ravers seem
almost asexual compared to the pre 1992 bunch.Sexual energy was
the rule,not the exception then.. now.. well..
Maybye I havn't been going out enough,but sometimes I'd rather
go out to a non-rave type club.. The ravers are too involved
with trying to out-cool each other now.. This didnt used to be so.
-C.

Here are some choice answers:

> 	1) How has your sex/love life, capacity, expression, etc. changed
> 	since you have been raving?

1.  Raving has definitely been a major part of the unfolding
of my expression of love, agape as well as eros.  In fact,
the Platonic kind of love engendered in both MDMA and the
virtual ecstasy of the vibe at good parties and the Apollonian
and Dionysian revelry unite to make all of us at these
celebrations realize our godliness or lighbody spirituality
in a world in which these aspects of "love" are too often
fragmented or even absent from our lives.  So I would call my
experiences evolutionary, having their roots in my being as well
as in my earliest religious experiences.

----
Not to sound trite, but I've found that I tend to beat match during
intercourse.  No really!  Matching my body's rocking and thrusting
movements with my partner's.  I guess raving has given me a greater
sense of beat and timing.  Other aspects of sex as covered in this
question remain unchanged from before when I raved.
----
1. Raving has definitely opened my mind towards sexuality. Although I am
still a straight male, I feel totally at ease with anyone's sexual
"expressions" at raves or anywhere else. Of course, Eros can bend anyone's
guidelines and rules...

2. It's much easier to get into a sexualove relationship. I've met some very
openly sexual lovers through the whole rave thing. Some very adventuresome,
passionate people, too.
----
For me it is difficult to say, as it really hasn't happened much (I
don't really pursue it, but I'm not unreceptive to it either). But I'd
say I'm a lot less hung up about feeling and getting intimate with
people.

My last boyfriend and I raved nearly every weekend.  It did have an effect
on our sex life . . . we'd have sex a lot less because we were always 
tired from being up all night.  When we both still did drugs, we'd take
acid, stay up all night,  and then after a rave we'd have breakfast,
take a shower, and have sex, and eventually fall asleep.

have only had this experience with one woman, so can't really generalize. but
i would say that the love-making was different, a bit more of a 'meeting' of th
  souls.

Eros is a turn-on for me a lot of the time. Not in a way that makes me
want to pick up someone, but more in a way that adds a slight sexual
"taste" to the whole trance/vibe/music experience. It encourages me to
stay in touch with the sexual part of myself and acknowledge it in
others. The wholeness of our existence includes sexuality, and this
seems to carry it over into the rave experience. It's very nice.
Perhaps someday some of the "sexual good vibes" from a party might
carry over into a more private experience.

I have thought about other sexlove lifestyles, and I don't mind the
thoughts,  I just don't know if I will act on them...

i don't think ravers are that different. my experience with ravers is mostly
here in the bay area, where there is a more tolerant attitude in general.

i think that trancing has affected ALL my life, sex included. it seems to
allow me to connect to the whole world in new/different/unexpexted ways.
it has affected my sex life in my desire to travel with my lover to that
place 'in between' sexually. as for interferring with meeting people, on the
contrary, i think trancing has helped in making me more sensitive to other
people's vibes.

10. I love getting down with the real deep stuff. Rave is fun; hardcore is
great if you have the stamina. But my favorite sexy music is actually deep
stuff like Massive Attack, One Dove... things that sound sexy with plenty o'
groove! It's gotta be deep and/or hard - just like the sex itself!

	I just got back from Sunset and I have to say that this is 
simply the coolest twist on raving.  There, at the Berkeley Marina, 
there was so much vibe, so much love, that you could almost
see it like a cloud above you.  Everyone there was simply "into" it.
I don't think I have ever been to an event where I have seen so many
positive, happy, smiling people.  The music system, the DJ, the location,
everything seemed virtually perfect.  I really think that this is what
raving should evolve into, a daytime activity.
	During the day everyone is just so much more awake, alive. 
There at the Marina, people would walk by and they would be just
in awe at what they were seeing:  about 100 young people thoroughly
enjoying themselves in a peaceful, positive way.  (Rave PR would be
no problem if they were all during the day!).  Okay, I'll stop 
commenting on this event.  All I can say is, check it out!
	Logistics:  We had to leave early, much to my dismay, because
someone in our party was just too cold.  If you don't plan on dancing
the whole time, then bring some VERY warm clothes (big jackets
were being worn by a lot of people).  If there are any people on the 
net who are involved with the Pacific Soundsystem, please e-mail me.

asexuality and ambiguity is fun
rawer blatant sexual energy is fun
any form of sexual energy as inspiration seems fair game

note, however, that I would make a distinction between 
overt sexuality as an energy source or cool body trip
and getting hit-on ala meat market style 

also, this *really* seems to go with the music which sometimes
draws on an aggressive feeling, or maybe a silly/fuzzy bear
feeling, or whatever
personally, I am a real sucker 
for a low down sweaty groove ...

it strikes me, sometimes, as out-cooling at being not cool
an "i am a serious raver" syndrome
true to the underground shit
don't clutter me

I like rave tourists who maybe just dropped by after a cocktail party
They are there to have fun -  just like the beyond e hardcore til dawn
folks are.  Bring them in.  Use them.

I like poking fun.  Dancing fools.  Self-mockery is ok. 
I like a room full of bad ass motherfuckers ready to go OUT 
I like the Shit right there, right now, whatever it is I am
gonna make it happen on the Fly  
I am gonna take it, and Spin it, and throw it back
I am going to speak when I have something to say
You do what you want, what you can, When you can
this is the Timing - the collaboration
and you Know 
that everyone else Knows
how really really Cool you are

OK, I can see Massive Attack, but One Dove? Dot just doesn't do it for me. :)
I'm still waiting for Johnny Marr to put out a solo album of just his guitar.
Raw sex right there. :)

I agree, and didn't mean to imply that I disliked 'tourists.'  I enjoy
trippin on their obviously different(from mine) mental state/motivation -
natural and uh, assisted both.  And we can alway use 'fresh blood.'  Though a
space like King Street that lets them have a Corona in hand probably won't
convert 'em.  Not to say that I don't like King St. myself - I have lots of
great and varied memories from that place.  It's weird now that's its all
paved and stuff out front though.

I really think this is true.  Although for most people who don't rave, 
there is a fear of "abandon", of letting go, nevertheless they could be 
tricked into it :-) if the other aspects were accessible to them.

However, I only know [personally] one other person (outside of those met at 
raves or in rave-culture) who is at all willing or capable of doing 
anything between midnight and dawn (other than being asleep at home :-) ).
 
While it is true that the 3 hours before dawn is the best time for trance-
inducing activities, nonetheless if extending rave culture to others is a 
consideration, then perhaps Troy is right that more daytime events are 
needed.  Perhaps "In the Light" could be held more often?

Hello Brian,

It seems that in my posts about DJs and events, most people reacted more to 
the concept of pigeonholing them with one or two words, rather than the 
concept of giving people more information about events.

This must have been due to my use of language, since there have been many 
posts on sfraves calling for more information about events.

Ultimately, I'm not at all interested in reducing things to one or two 
words - maybe I'm still not used to cheap 650MB disk drives :-).

So, perhaps the ftp site could have a directory for events, with sub-
directories for each name (Basics, Wicked, etc.) containing reviews and 
experiences that have been posted to sfraves.

So, for example, someone who reads the bare bones listing for the recent 
"Anthem of the Sun" would have somewhere to look for a description that 
would help them to evaluate which event to choose for that night.
respect to all,

i get a sneaking suspicion (as does comrade Penna) that Ken Stuart 
<ken@snowcrest.net> has not been to a rave.  this is a damn shame, 
because he is missing out on a lifestyle that he is obviously curious 
about because he subscribes to sfraves.  If Ken Stuart 
<ken@snowcrest.net> chooses to continue on this path, a no growth 
situation will continue and stagnation will occur.  it will be much like 
the rest of america that watches television to try to get all their 
information.  it is much easier to go eat a burger king everyday and sit 
at home and watch television and use the computer and other electronic 
media as a substitute for seeing the real thing.  

however, i hope that Ken Stuart <ken@snowcrest.net> will choose a 
different pathway, one that is much happier and will lead to much more 
spiritual, emotional, and physical growth.  if Ken Stuart 
<ken@snowcrest.net> chooses to make it down to where Tony V Garcia 
<deepfog@cats.ucsc.edu> exists in harmony with the ocean, Tony V Garcia
<deepfog@cats.ucsc.edu> will TREAT Ken Stuart <ken@snowcrest.net> to his 
first rave.  and provided he is a nice person and is NOT a COP, he will 
even allow him to trance, which in my opinion, is exactly what Ken Stuart 
<ken@snowcrest.net> needs, but is hiding from that fact and denying that 
it can help him in any way.  

well, ken, now there are no excuses.  dont' bother responding to this 
with an argument on every line.  if you don't want to go to a rave, don't 
even bother responding to this post, because you will be wasting my time 
and your time and about 900 other people's time.

I think I may have misled people a while ago when I said that 900 people
were getting the calendar.  About 600 of those people only get the calendar,
not the sfraves mail.  However, this doesn't mean wasting 300 people's
time is not as bad as wasting 900 people's time. :-)

I think this would be a great idea. Collect reviews and make them
available via FTP or WWW. Then newbies (and us oldbies) could browse
them and find out what other people thought.

I don't think Ken is wasting anyone's time. If he has or hasn't been
to a rave is irrelevant. If you _must_ judge what he says, then judge
it on the strength of content, and not on who you believe him to be.

If we take the position that someone who hasn't had "the experience"
doesn't have something worthwhile to say, then we potentially turn a
deaf ear to wisdom.

Ken has made some valid points; I also think he displays a
"non-insider" perspective sometimes, and might benefit from a
first-hand experience. But let's not demand it as a condition for
considering what he says.

If you are referring to a previous "Anthem of the Sun" party, I think
it happened a year ago, at a different venue, with some different DJs and
a *completely* different outcome that this year's version.  I've been to
Basics parties at the Richmond Civic Center, the Stone, the Trocadero,
and at an armory, and as far as I'm concerned, they were *very* different
parties: Being at one (let alone reading about one) would not have
prepared me for the next one.  I could say something similar about Wickeds
also.

When I first started raving about 3 years ago, I was greatly disturbed
at the unpredictability of the experience.  Not being able to know where
I was going until just hours before going out was abhorrant to me.  After
a while, you do pick up an intuitive sense of direction, but there still 
aren't *any* garauntees as to what kind of an rave you can expect on any
given night.  I think clubs can give you that kind of predictability,
but for me, an almost hopeless control freak, the chaos of raving has been
very liberating, teaching me to live more in the Now instead of worrying
and trying to predict what will be.  Raving taught me to take risks, to
let go of expectations, and to be prepared to be surprised or disappointed.
And if I just went to the parties that suited my tastes 3 years ago, I may 
have never learned and discovered other kinds of parties that I *thought* 
I would never be able to enjoy.

I think a very simple solution to Ken Stuart's Dilemma is at hand.
It just so happens there is an event called Friends & Family *this
very Saturday* at a convenient location.  In the dialectic between
praxis and theory, it seems like this would be a good time to
acquire the necessary antithesis.  Pardon the garbled Kantian
methodology here, it seemed appropriate :)

I agree.

We're lucky to be in an area so full of opportunities.  If one turns out 
bad, there's another one somewehre else.  So many choices!  Where would I 
be without Derek Chung's Dry Yet Essential calendar?!  (thanks, man)  I 
try to take friends to raves and often they ask "where is it?" and I feel 
so good telling them "I don't know" becasue it could be very surprising.

The answer is even better.  I'm working on creating hypermail versions of the
sfraves archives, as well as implementing a fast WAIS-like (but not wais,
something better called glimpse) keyword search, so you can look for "Wicked"
for example and get back every post that had that term in it.  I dunno that I
could do it very easily through FTP, and I think the number of people with
FTP access but without access to even a rudimentary WWW browser like Lynx is
vanishingly small.

 I'm going to be out of commision , rave-wise , this weekend as I am working
on some circuitry for the FM transmitter . This will be the transmitter 
that will be micro-casting the music at RADIO!RADIO! , the SFR picnic
at Sunnyvale Baylands Park.

 Much love and other vibe-stuff to you folks , tonight at the San Jose 
Oasis , and any events from now and Monday - including , of course ,
the Friends and Family benefit party at Kommotion - I hope it goes as
good as the previous one did ...

Thank you.

I would only like to add that first-hand experience does not necessarily 
produce an "insider" perspective.

And, is the insider/non-insider dichotomy really in line with the rave 
perspective?  Or is it that we feel unity only with those who happen to be 
there?

Thanks for your reasoned reply.

However, isn't something being said by the promoter when he uses the same 
name?  There is an implicit claim of continuity.  Hence, reading an sfraves 
post about the previous occurrence of that event should at least tell one 
what the promoter is trying to tell us it will be like.

And, if the review of the previous "Anthem of the Sun" says "... first DJ 
started spinning at midnight...", then one at least knows that there is no 
real "Sun" aspect, despite the name :-) .

That's not much of a problem for me, I can't even predict if my car will 
get there. :-)

Hi!  the sunset party was really great:  those of you who got there early
got to hear Gavin Hardkiss' ambient set...he doesn't dj hardly at all &
so you guys pat yourselves on the back for getting to hear something really
special.  I'm so bummed i missed it!

I am a big fan of the Hardkisses in general- i'm hoping they'll keep doing
stuff in the "scene" like playing these littler parties...Robbie Hardkiss
spun sunday, too...he is the shit.  It was soooo nice!  His music makes me
feel all mintyfresh/grungyfunky.  

I'm very glad to see Galen is playing Friends and Family this Saturday.  You
guys that haven't heard him and who like a technoey sound will probably
enjoy it.  He does the faster shade of a house.  Does anybody else out there
feel the way I do?: that Galen's sets make your brain as well as your
body move?

Yes, it's true...i'm in the cult o' dj's.  'cause they are artists!  give
a dj a crowd, a setting, a musical problem (like...play ambient & then
make a transition into house...for example!) ...and watch what goes down.


The New Moon party went off at a location on Lower Haight.  The site 
fit not too many people & so it was a smallish party.  Lotsa of the 
same people from previous parties showed, which was very nice.  Also some
folks from all over the place.  One guy from LA brought party favors-
basically stuff he picked up off the ground and then embellished with
crystals, stick-on rhinestones, etc.  He spins ambient & hopefully will
be able to come up again to do so soon!

I just want to say that the people who were there were so incredibly
cool...respectful of the space, open-minded, friendly, enlightened, cute
/angelic.  The ages were pretty much mixed, but as usual there were a 
lot of younger people...i am so incredibly proud of this generation of
people coming up.  they get a lot of sh*t in the media that they don't
deserve.

the space is a basement gallery that is slowly being fixed up to 
resemble the ancient city of Atlantis!  (or so it seemed to me..) the
front room was painted blue & had artificial fish hanging from the
ceiling.  there was also a huge fish tank as well as a large orb lit
from within.  the dance area was smallish, but adequate for the crowd.
we set up foam and cushions in another room where people chilled out.
smoking was allowed outside by the back door.

i talked a lot with ishmael, one of the guys that donated the space.  he
was very much into the idea of ambient music stimulating thought, slowing
people down, encouraging reflection and meditation.  he was soooo
cool to let us also do dance music, even though he could have been in
trouble with the authorities because of noise complaints.  i heard
you can get a $300 fine if you disturb the peace too often in SF.  is
(i just heard that somewhere...)

quotes from Ishmael:  "Cats have more chakras than humans"
			"the youth need to slow down"

ain't it the truth!  but imho, the youth need to DANCE!

(and dance they did!)

Thanks thanks thanks go out to Ishmael, Bryce for spinning & bringing
Metrovision & just generally being incredibly cool, as always, Sean
for bringing fans, Maui for being there & dancing her butt off, Harlan
for the lights, Gregg Helt for organizing & bringing foam & blankets,
Philip for DATing.  you guys are what make it happen!

love,

annthrax

Just got back from the Oasis party and I must say there were lots of 
people there, and on a wednesday, allright!  If you called the info line, 
didn't it seem like the guy kept on going, and going and even still 
going? 
I had a good time seeing the crowd grow as time went on and there were 
even a few shouts going out now and then later into the night, it was a 
good club-type-general-carefree-feeling-with-the-feeling-someone's-
watching you drinking a Samuel Adams... Visuals were good a la slides 
through a colorwheel amd various disco strobes and spots made sure you 
couldn't easily kick back and watch.  Free water at le bar! with ice and 
a straw even!  Such a deal.  and it was free to get in, too!  Is this a 
regular Oasis thing on wednesdays?

I heard that drip-a-drip song again.  It always tweaks my melon just a bit!
I met Harry Who for the first time and he gave me all these flyers for 
Groove Kitchen and Pure Space tonight in SF.  Hey Harry, thanks for 
saying hi, what is your e-mail address?

All in all an excellent weeknight-club-rave-thing.  ...go SJRaves!

I'll just take this little opportunity to throw in a plug for my roommate's
new CD ("Let the Magic Flow" by Deluxe).  It's half ambient and half dance,
and the tracks are all mixed together.  It goes back and forth between ambient
and dance and back to ambient and back to dance again.

The CD isn't out yet.  The release date is "around Labor Day".

(A number of people have asked me when we'll be coming out with some new
Ultraviolet Catastrophe material.  This CD is aobut as close as you'll get.
It's 99% Jeff, but Jon D and I both made small contributions as well.)

As Ann said, both these parties were really nice. The weather was
perfect for the Sunset party. There were about 40-60 people there
sharing smiles and a good time. Oh I do love parties like that :).

The NMR went really well in the lower Haight. Music selection was a
bit eclectic :), but the basic groove was there and smiles and
dancing were shared by all. Very trippy space! Kudos to Bryce for
bringing the sound, to Harlan for his excellent (and excellently
appropriate) lights, and for the altar and munchies provided by Gregg
and Ann.

My Fans from Hell (sm) performed well in their second party test,
evacuating most of the smoke and providing a minor hurricane for the
dance floor :). Check em out at Komotion this Saturday. "High Velocity
Air Circulator" (ahem) at Price Club for $40. These are seriously
powerful fans with a 5 year warranty at a great price. I love these
things and I highly recommend getting a couple if you throw indoor
parties.

See you all Saturday! I'm spinning! Wheeeee.... :)

Derek's out of town this week so he asked me to pass this along.
It looks like QUITE a busy weekend - two on Friday and five parties on 
Saturday (including at least three outdoor parties) so there should be NO 
excuse to not get out and boogie.  Friends and Family has become the
quasi-formal SFR get-together and collaborative venture, so come on down 
and meet the family :)  

Have fun!

	Brian, reprising the role...

A few words of advice:

Say hi to me! I'll be wearing my white T-shirt with a _big_ Bach on
the front and back. I'm tall, thin, and smile too much :). And I know
lots of people, so if you're new to this, I'll take you around and
introduce you to some very nice people. And I'll be *real* easy to
find between 10 and 11 :) :) :).

Wear very light clothes!!!  The last F&F was insane with about 200
people shakin it inside most of the night.  We're going to have major
fannage, but it's still going to get **hot** in there--expect it and
prepare. At the very least, bring shorts.  Water is _free_, so drink
all you want, we'll pour more :).

F&F II filled up really fast! We got back after dinner at about 9:45
and there were already 10 or 20 people dancing. The place was packed
by 11:30. So you might want to come out early...

Bring toys, bubbles, paints, lights, slinkies, munchies, blo-pops,
anything you want.

As the last time: $3, all ages, ins&outs, free water, lots of good
attitude, and some really great DJing. (I haven't heard Jon Drukman or
Ethan spin in quite a while. I can't wait :). And we're setting up SO
early that everything should be right on time.

Remember, light (or no) clothes...

See you there!

Sean

 New Music for Jay
Does anyone have some titles for me 8-).  I would like to take this opportunity
(while SFRaves is quiet) to ask for some help in finding some great new jams. 
I have been diggin Future Sounds of London and Ultramarine (especially tracks
"discovery and pansy" off of every man and woman is a star), but I've had them
for a while.  Can anyone suggest some similar style CD's that I gotta have or
any must-have's that I shouldn't live without?  The more obscure the better. 
Suggestions for possible places to get them are also helpful.  Although I have
most of the recent postings on great places to buy music, I would appreciate
some direction.  Thanks. ;-)


Lurking with respect

Raven in the Sun

BTW, as you might have already guessed, I prefer CDs over albums only because I
don't have a decent turntable.  Peace.

Agreed - but unless someone wants to sift through the archives going
"this is a review" and extracting them, being able to keyword search
for "review" or "Wicked" is the next best thing.  Besides, many reviews 
turn into full threads on subtopics, and many posts are compound reviews, 
and many posts are not entirely reviews but talk about events, etc...

Sameer - I know about and appreciate the hypermail archive you have
running at c2; I want to put past archives under this as well as 
the keyword search mechanism.

        Try telnet to cdconnection.com and cdeurope.com.  They have
about 300,000 titles between them -- 100,000 domestic and 200,000 european
(the european listings are about twice as expensive and include a lot
of singles, cassettes and vinyl).  They like VISA.  I've bought about
150-200 discs from the domestic side and been happy with the service.
You can even ftp the domestic database.

        I just went through the stuff mentioned in the alt.raves "favorites"
thread, and ordered about 15 of them.  Its worth checking the domestic for
things you find on the european because of the price difference.

Andrew

PS they also have modem access, with lots of local numbers.

I just finished my first tape recently, if anyone is interested.  It's 
called "Ambient Zombie".  If anyone would like a copy of it, call me at 
408-479-4327.  The cost will be very low, just simply to cover the cost 
of a blank tape and the mailing cost, if those costs even apply to your 
situation.  The type of music ranges from ambient house-techno with a 
little acid sprinkled in here and there.  

bye!

deepfog

ps, those f&f goers, i will probably be wearing the glittery jester hat 
with bells on it and a matching shirt, both which are very 
distinguishable!  So as they say here in Santa Cruz, don't be shy, come 
say hi!

There's no such thing as irrational.  Right now I'm working on a proof that
shows that pi is really 3 for small circles and 4 for big circles.

I'll let y'all know when I'm done.

hey,

i just got a cool record (sorry, no recent CD's...), called
"SNOEK RECORDS  A CYGNUS LOOP PRODUCTION".  the cut 
called "NYHAGINGI" is really great shit, real funky beats
and good basslines, instruments, etc., fairly "normal"
instruments, "so funky it's stretching the defintion of
house", and has a purple and green graphic of a fish on 1
side of the 12" label.  while it doesn't bite any recognizeable
disco hit, the discophobic may want to steer clear...

Intuitively obvious, I'd say.  Try something more difficult, like
proving pi is 3 for a small square but 4 for a large cool person.

I'll get you for that.

	This mail is from Andrew Morin of EPIC Productions:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Having visited Arizona up to August 10 this is the scoop so far:

	The organizers of the World Unity Festival are presently in disarray.
There are conflicts among many of those who are working, thus far for no
pay, on the event and the main person organizing the festival is under
intense stress as things fail to come together.  It just feels like a
period when organizing the world on this level just isn't working out
well for many.  In any case, the festival does not at this time have a
site.  Both the Sky Dome at the University which was to be the site for
the two day concert on Sat.  amd Sun.  August 27 and 28, as well as a
site for the week long free portion of the event have not been secured.
With the conflicts amongst the ranks of the organizers as well a s the
problem with sites I just don't see how things are going to come
together properly given that only ten days remaining to the official
opening date of the event on August 22.

	With the Unity Festival having such severe problems it appears
very problematic to attempt the rave.  At best it would be a one night
event given that it would need to be guerrilla.  The bottom line at this
point is that several thousands of people are going to be showing up in
northern Arizona for an event that may not come off at all.  The
enterprising raver could bring a sound system and DJs down and probably
put on a party, but there is trouble in the air because of the
disorganized state of things down there.  EPIC and Fraser Clark are
keeping our options open.  We will probably be attending Narnia in
northern San Diego County.  If the Unity Festival organizers have
pulled off a miracle,  we might then head to Arizona to do the
guerrilla.  I'll keep you posted on the ever shifting sands of the south
west.

My recollection of the timetable is:

Big Room: Sean Lee Ethan Galen Jon D. Giamma
Multimedia Room: Planet 6 Mohsen HDW & Ovid Weird Blinking Lights BPM/0

ethan has the definitive answer, but he may be off-net for the weekend.
I'm sure about Sean, Giamma, Planet 6 and myself (HDW).  the others are
surmises.

I'm curious which other parties are happening tomorrow night around
town.  I only know about Freefall and Weed.  then again, i haven't been
scoping the flyer racks in forever.

anyway, hope to see you there at some point. if i find out a better/more
accurate schedule, i'll let you know.

I haven't seen any articles on the topic, so I figured I'd be the first to
   draw attention to the lamitude of ws94.  Like many of you, I've followed
   this obviously mainstream, commcerialized, overhyped, etc. mega-event
   from a distance.  These qualities are not themselves indicative of
   a non-happening devoid of the community feelings that we know well as
   part of sfr - but let's face it:  when you grab a random sample of
   people booked to see the bands that are playing ws94, promoted on
   televison, etc. - you're getting a pretty unexceptional mix of people,
   and the crowds have never had a great deal of spirit, community, or
   otherwise egoless, open, unselfish motives.  From what I've read of the
   original, it's what made it exceptional.

Anyway, the main thrust of this is to perhaps masturbate as I share the
   sentiment that if the Saugerites folk really want to experience the
   feelings that the original ws goers felt, they should hit an sfrave
   (like F+F or LA, not Sharon...).  I need not preach to this crowd about
   vibe - you enlightened me.  Regurgitation is for the classroom and the
   bathroom.

Obviously, this is set against the more cynical backdrop of the 90s, as
   opposed to the comparatively cheery optimism of the 60s, brimming with
   anything-is-possible ideals rather than, it-should-be-possible-why-isn't- 
   it-happening ideals... I think it's safe to say that most people prefer
   the realism, even if it's coupled with frustration.  The sfravers all
   have day jobs and make no pretense that the scene is about anything
   other than having a harmless good time, and promoting good will.

On a concluding note, those of you with access should check out today's
   (sat) New York Times, and its article(s) on the saugerites event.  In
   the inner page is a terrific (I mean that both ways) photo of three guys
   snapping photos and leering at a topless woman (her back to the nyt camera).
   There are two women in the background staring at her like she's crazy.
   Pictures say a thousand words, and that photo easily replaces this review.

peace, vibe, and community

Virtual communities are not like real life communities.
There are more fantasies and projections.
It is a step beyond the telephone - which is hard enough
for me to talk on.  Subtleties are lost.  Body language. 

I am not going to pick up your mail or feed your dog
I don't have jumper cables

I do not really care about you
other than the loss I might experience
if you were to stop posting
sorta like a power outage during my favorite tv show
my concern goes as far as my desire to be entertained by you 

One thing virtual communities 
have in common with real communities
is the occasional 
Psycho Neighbor

watch out,

Fantasies and projections don't happen in real life, too.  Look at anyone 
who idolizes someone else they hang around.

New subtleties are created.  Language becomes *very* important - 
being able to express yourself explicitly becomes the order of the day.  
Real-life subtleties that shouldn't matter (color of your skin, social 
status, hair color, etc) are lost.

I don't know my neighbors, really, and have never asked them to watch my 
mail or feed the pets.  I rely on others on the net in a neighborly sense 
to a much greater degree than I rely on those who live in close proximity 
to me.

Hmm... I wish I could impress upon you how strongly connected I feel to 
other people I share the Internet with, but it's a personal thing I suppose.

This is true :):)

Read "Virtual Communities" by Howard Rheingold.  Or even SFRaves archives 
from late 92 or so :)

Whilst Ken gives many virtual smileys in his tendencious
and sseemingly endless polemical e-mailings, we've yet to
swee *his* smiley face--if in fact there *is* a KEN STUART!

There's a difference between just saying and feigning "best
to all," Ken, and *really* meaning it by being a part of our
community.  Come out, come out, wherever you are, Kenny!

last night i went to go see a movie called sex drugs and democracy....i 
think it is a really interesting film that portrays dutch society as a 
place where people can coexist and tolerate each other and their personal 
choices.....from the movie promo...

"Sex, Drugs & Democracy, a feature-length, documentary film, explores the 
mimits of personal freedom.  The film takes an uncensored look at the 
unconventional approach to morality and politics in Holland with an 
outstanding soundtrack, featuring all new American and Dutch bands."

they even have a part of the film where they talk about raves as a safe 
self contained place to intoxicate people....

go see it...susie (:

p.s. i hate kennedy on mtv she is such a bitch!!!! she went to the 
"rave-party" and acted like the wanker she is....the least they 
could have done was gotten a vj who actually likes techno to cover 
the night time techno activities...ravestock is a total joke...gee was the 
orb on pay per view?

Don't underestimate promoting good will!

The frustration just comes from expectations -- sometimes it just takes a 
long time to "come back around". :-)

Hi Brian and other virtual folx--

In his Re: Virtualness post, Brian sez:

> New subtleties are created.  Language becomes *very* important -
> being able to express yourself explicitly becomes the order of the day.
> Real-life subtleties that shouldn't matter (color of your skin, social
> status, hair color, etc) are lost.

If there's one thing I've learned about language it's that
virtually *everything* is language: those "subtleties that 
shouldn't matter" are ever-present even in the VR world of
cyber communication. In place of "color of your skin,
social status, hair color, etc.," we have spelling, organization,
form of discourse (mediation, argumentation, narrative,
abstract synthesis, etc.), conceptualization of one's realtion
with "the world" and others, point of view which *reflects*
color of your skin, hair color, social status, etc.

In other words, we *never* get away from those subtleties
that *you* say "shouldn't matter" because what we say and how
we say it are further abstractions of, to some degree or other, all
of them.  So it's very important to get to know each other's
context to get the best possible communication.

Which brings me back to Ken Stuart, who continuously argues that
it's not important for him to meet us at raves.  My answer is that
to the extent that context is missing, communication is less complete.
While your hair color may be of little import, I don't believe
in "shouldn'ts" and I know enough of the human condition that we
can say "shouldn't" as often as we want and we will not wipe away
that importance, lesser or greater that it may be in each communicAa-      
tions situation we have face-to-face.  "Should" and "shouldn't"
do not exist, and invoking them can be dangerous.

Of course, what you meant came from what I interpret as good
intention, largely because I know you.  I know you are not
trying to impose a moral order on us, but rather expressing 
your desire for clear communication somehow based on a standard
of explicit expression, whatever that is.  Sounds simple,
but it is eeven *more* difficult in the world of virtual
communities, where our abstraction  of printed language is
based on a more abstract concept of who we're communicating
with than it is in the physical world.  Example: look at how
David and Brian, Will and Ken conceptualize VR communication
*so* differently! In physical communication *all* of our
physical instrumentalities come into play during the 
communications process; in VR they are contracted into a
very few.  If Rheingold ignores or skims over this all-important
difference between the two communications media, his discussion
has little or no value. The medium *is* both the message and
the massage, and attempts to over-simplify this will not
shed light on how communication takes place and what some of
the most basic filters are!

This topic comes up *so* often and--in my view as a student of
communications-- is so often (usually out of a perceived need
to soothe flamers) over-simplified that we spin our wheels over 
and over about it.

What do *you* think?

ciao,
Will

The last schedule I got looked like this:

10:00 - 11:00          Sean Casey
11:00 - 12:30          Lee
12:30 - 02:00          Ethan
02:00 - 03:30          Galen
03:30 - 05:00          Jon D
05:00 - 06:30          Giamma

There may have been last minute changes I don't know about. This is
supposed to be a pretty flexible schedule (a pretty flexible
party--there will probably be some (good) surprises), so times may
vary.

Not including me (this is my first time!), this is a *killer* DJ
lineup.  We're going to blow the fucking roof off. Bring your boxers
and prepare to twitch! Whooooooeeee!

:)

 I disaggre...  If you've ever been on a MOO for a couple weeks you've

 You don't have someone to feed your dog or read your mail, rather you 
have a mail sifting program, and maybe someone to log on for you while 
your on vacation so your mail doesn't overflow...  YOu don't have jumper 
cables, but when you have a system crash your have virus programs...

 Not true, as i interpritate it, i some people on this mailing list left, or

 As they say on NBC, and all thoughs news broadcasts, "If you wouldn't 
let your child walk down a dark alley, at night, you probly shouldn't let 
them login."   Watch your back is more like it, don't watch your TV...

RADIO! RADIO!   -  Status Report 1

What???: An SFR picnic , with music provided by SFR DJs , and simultaneous
         local broadcast by FM stereo micro-transmitter.
Where: South Bay city of Sunnyvale , Sunnyvale Baylands Park , the Owl Burrow 
        picnic area .
When: Saturday , Aug. 20th , from 1PM to ?? ( no later than 8PM is suggested,
       as vehicles must leave the park by 8:30PM ).
Directions: To be supplied later this week - at the intersection of Lawrence 
            Expressway and Highway 237.

Site amenities : One barbecue pit with a 20" x 70" grilling area . Water 
  faucets and drains. Electrical outlets. Recycling bins. Restrooms and pay 
  phones.  Big playhouse with slide for those SFRavers with kids. Big meadow 
  nearby - nice steady afternoon breeze for kite flying! 

   Stroll around the park and see the wonders (?) of the nearby salt marsh 
  and estuary. However ,alcohol is allowed within the bounds of the picnic 
  area only - no staggering around the park with a brewskie in your hand .


REQUEST FOR STUFF: I will be bringing some ice cream and/or sherbert packed 
in dry ice for the kids ( and for the adults too ! ). The spot that I'm 
thinking of for setting up the mixer has some shade in the afternoon, so I 
don't think we need a canopy. Other than that, I'm hoping that folks will 
volunteer to bring stuff -

Table for mixer and turntables.

Charcoal for the barbecue ( I think two large bags should be enough - could 
those folks who are going to bring something to grill please email me , so I 
can estimate how much charcoal to get ).

Food and drink - How do folks want to do this - bring your own food & drink , 
or do a shared potluck kind of thing? I'm willing to buy some bags of ice to 
keep the soda cold , if we're sharing .

                 That's if for now!
                 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

RADIO! RADIO! - Directions to Sunnyvale Baylands Park

General notes: 

 There is a huge softball complex called Twin Creeks located right next to 
Sunnyvale Baylands Park. There should be enough signs to tell you which 
one you're at. The entrance of Sunnyvale Baylands Park is at the intersection 
of Moffet Park Drive and Caribbean Drive ; the main part of the park is at 
the southeast quadrant of the Caribbean Drive/Lawrence Expressway/
HW 237 intersection.

 Parking at Sunnyvale Baylands Park is $3.00 per vehicle. Cars are allowed
in the park until 8:30PM , the park itself closes at 9PM.

FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO PENINSULA :
First , get to HW 237 -

  HW 280 - South , past Palo Alto . Take the HW 85 exit , North to Mtn. View . 
Drive past El Camino and take the HW 237/HW101 South exit. You will then
be on HW 237 , East. 

 HW 101 - South , past Mountain View to Sunnyvale. Take the Alviso / 
Milpitas exit to HW 237 East. 

 Once on HW 237 East,  drive past Fair Oaks Ave. and take the Lawrence
Expressway/Caribbean Drive exit - choose the Caribbean Drive branch of
the exit. Stay in the right hand lane on Caribbean Drive - the park entrance 
is the first right turn as soon as you drive over HW 237.  After the toll
booth , take the right hand drive to the last picnic area , called Owl Burrow.

FROM THE EAST BAY:
>From HW 880 - Drive south on HW 880 towards San Jose and Milpitas. At
Milpitas, take the Alviso Rd./Calaveras Blvd. exit to HW 237 West . Drive
towards Mountain View and Sunnyvale . Use the Lawrence Expressway/
Caribbean Drive exit , taking the first Caribbean Drive branchoff. The
entrance to the park will be the first right turn after the on-ramp . After 
the toll booth , take the right hand drive to the last picnic area , called 
Owl Burrow.

LOCAL DIRECTIONS:
Assuming you know how to get to either Mathilda Ave. , Fair Oaks Ave. ,
Wolfe Road, or Lawrence Expressway , drive up any of them towards the 
bay.  Mathilda Ave. intersects HW 237 - take the HW 237 East exit , and
drive to the Caribbean Drive offramp. Wolf Road merges into Fair Oaks Ave ; 
take the HW 237 East exit , and use the  Caribbean Drive exit . Lawrence 
Expressway becomes Caribbean Drive at HW 237 - the entrance to the park 
will be on the right after HW 237.


Hope to see you there!

Weeeeeee, `didn't expect to get a free sauna thrown in with the deal, and
what a deal it was...

Sean Casey debut: Five stars; Check it out if you get a chance.
Nice well blended set. Sean has more pitty on us melting dancers than
most dj's. He would pump us up with some fast house beats for a few minutes
and then let off the steam only to hit us again once we caught our breath.
Other dj's to this of course, but Sean struck me as being especially good
at it in terms of both blending and in choosing how long to let the fast
and slow sections last. Maybe J.S.Bach was helping out.

Lee was great too (that was Lee, right?). Does anyone know what the track was 
with the very heavy drum mix where the vocal sample says 'wasted' or 'busted' 
or 'breakdown' or '?' at the end of every eight bars? That track is a drug.
Beware.

It's probably been said before, but the people at the F&F productions are
really friendly; that goes for the crowd as well as the people running the
show. Everyone on the floor knows how to get down too. I can't wait for the
next one!

I definitely want to see this.

Interestingly enough the house club I was at in A'dam last February is
called RoXY. Can't say what the real underground parties are like, since
neither I nor any friends that live in the Netherlands have found one yet,
but this place was really going off. The best part was actually the crowd;
lots of eye contact, smiling, wiggling, and very little inhibition.
Heel gezellig!

I don't know if they went into official policy very much in the movie, but
you should know that house parties *are* being cracked down on in Holland.
Drug use is tolerated, but it is not *accepted*, and it is not technically 
legal.

There are a lot of ambiguities in the Netherlands between the written law
and the way it is enforced, but the general pattern seems to be that if
something is discrete and happens in a well defined social setting that
does not produce 'casualties' (e.g. addicts, deaths, violence, non-functional
people) then it is tolerated.

All that aside, Holland is a great place to go out in. You can stay out until
about any hour you choose; no need to drive and if you can't get a train or
a bus to where you want to go, just hop on a bike to get where you want to
be (the county is *flat*). Many is the time we peddled the route from Leiden
to Katwijk at 3 in the morning. The people are very mellow and friendly too,
especially if you speak a little Dutch.

Zet de kleine blomtjes uit!

	Yet another perfect event.
	I LOVE the heat. it really keeps the posers away and leaves only the
	dedicated people.

	Sean Casey rocked the house. Lee took us deeeeeeep into the LEEsound.
	Ethan danced us into oblivion. John D put a fist of beats through my
	mind. 

	Planet 6 sound had a great set- live flute!!!!
	HDW of course brought us into the jungles of his mind and then Ovid	
	stepped in and dropped some thoughts.
	
	BPM/0 really had a great sound- they used the EBOW on a GUITAR to
	give that endless sustain...

	Mousen did a three source mix and had great sound.

	It was PACKED and everyone had a blast. I really like Kommotion and
	their staff. Everyone was cool on the street in front and we weren't
	hassled even ONCE.

	Hats off to all the SFRaves crew for yet another awesome event.

	I really enjoyed the minimal setup- no huge buckets of toys and
	cables everywhere. It makes setup and takedown easy and I could
	relax knowing that people wouldn't trip over cables.

	Our Weird Blinking Lights set was completely fun- its the first time
	all three of us played an SFRaves event and it was great. I hoped 
	you enjoyed it.

Wow sfraves, we all did it AGAIN!  From careful planning and set up
to people going all out to dance and have fun, the group of us
contributed in ways huge and small to make the best party I've been
to in a while!

I only wish I had the same stamina I did two years ago when dancing
all night was not a problem.  Maybe the fact that I used to sleep till
5pm the day before a party had something to do with it? :-)

Anyway, Brian and I arrived around 11:30 to find Komotion full and
bopping in high gear.  None of this "fashionably late" stuff, the
Friends and Family know that when the music starts the party starts.
I'm sorry I missed Sean's debut, I could tell by the mood on the floor
when I got there that it must have been killer.

I tried to save myself for Ethan, but when Lee got into that sequence
of tracks that had a local maximum at "Robot Man" I was totally sucked
into the dance.  In case anyone is wondering, I am the woman who was
running around with the inflatable giraffe.  Her name is Georgina, and
she came to me at a great party I went to two years ago.  I figured
that since she hadn't been out in two years last night would be a good
time. :-)

When Ethan got going I was proud to join the legion of 
sfraverbabesinblacksportsbras . . . hey, maybe we can convince Ameba to
design something that will glow under black light?  Every time I hear
Ethan spin he plays mostly different music from the time before.  And
although I was expecting one thing but got another, I'm all the more
happier because Ethan's impeccable taste in music and supurb mixing
skills gave me ears a total treat.

The visuals in the main room were incredibly cool.  I saw animated
images based on Escher drawings, psychedelic fractals, and (my
favorite) a set of patterns that looked like Oriental rugs.

The chill hall seemed to work better this time.  I especially enjoyed
the pair consisting of an ambient DJ and a guy playing dreamy feedback
electric guitar a la Robin Guthrie.  

Gush gush gush.  It was so cool seeing so many old friends and even
cooler meeting new people.  Of all the things I've done in conjunction
with the rave scene the one thing that brings me more joy than all the
others is meeting net people and seeing them out at a great party.
Special hugs go out to Kia and Susie, since many people were confusing
the three of us with each other all night. :-)

Ok, let's keep the vibe alive -- everyone come to "Radio Radio" next
Saturday afternoon and you know we'll have a great time.  Bring your
friends and family, too!

Thanks for the great time everyone, especially the F&F production crew.

Laura

Incredible! Awsome! A Spiritual Experience!

It is difficult to put into words the feelings experienced at FFIII.  The
energy and the spirit of the crowd, the people you meet, The Family
Atmosphere is really special and unique.

I missed Sean's set but got to meet him. A very warm and friendly guy he
is.  Lee was already seriously into his set when I hit the dance floor.
Great music again.  To me nothing beats Ethan for a hard trance hypnotising
set.  He is incredibly good at taking you one step higher into never, never
land.  At one point the crowd was so driven by the music it seemed like
everyone started to clap their hands all at the same time to the beat of
the music.  The energy was just overwhelming.
Thanks to Steve for notifying me that WBL was going to perform their set in
the chill room (I never would have left the dance floor).  Yes I finally
got to hear them and what a trip it was.  An incredible journey into their
eerie ambient world.  -"Steve did I really hear some BPMs here and there
through your set?"

To me the crowd is what makes F&F so special.  Especially the warm smiles,
the truly  piercing eye contacts, the feeling that everyone is experiencing
a magical journey.  Someone (I did not ask his name) got this great body
paint job.  He looked wild!  What did you think of Laura's pet
Giraff...soooo cute.

Again a party like this would not be so perfectly put together without the
people behind it. Thanks to Ethan, Bryce (sorry I missed your ambient set)
and everyone else involved.  The visuals were just awsome, much better than
I've seen in many expensive Clubs.

I could go on, and on, and on........

I can't wait for the next one.

   This was offically my last weekend of summer.  I'm moving up to USF in 
a week, so you'll soon  be seeing a lot more of me :)  anyways...

   The partying started off Friday night down here in Monterey.  After 
the success of the last Cloud Factory party, and not having talked to 
Scott or anyone for two weeks, I wasn't sure how well this one was going 
to go off.  My fears were soon calmed after I found out we had an amazing 
site in a canyon, and the weather was absoloutly perfect.  We had our 
black lights, but the shooting stars provided a once in a lifetime light 
show.

   We had to break a few locks to get on to the property and even with 
nearly 50 or more cars pouring down this deserted road, we never once had 
problems with the authorities :)

   A large crowd from Monterey showed up and many thanks to those who 
came down from Santa Cruz at 4 am.  The party peaked with about 150 
people and I would say 200+ came throughout the night.  The musical 
selection encompassed the entire spectrum from house to trance to 
breakbeat, unfortunatley, we didn't get it on DAT this time.. Oh well :)

   Kudos to Bryce for deciding at the last minute to make the long drive 
down here and join us!  We had a nice breakfast in Salinas after we 
packed everything up around 7:30am and then we all (almost all :) slept 
to 5pm...

   At which point it was time to head of up to F&F !!!  Almost the entire 
Cloud Factory posse made the trip up and we had an incredible time 
sharing and providing energy.  I was very impressed with Sean C's set, he 
played some fierce tribal/trance/progressive stuff which made me dance my 
ass off.  

   Lee started out a bit slower and gave people a chance to recover from 
Sean's fast set but after about 20 minutes he had the crowd dancing like 
mad to his classic acid trax :) .. I loved dancing above the crowd in the 
corner, you can see all the bodies moving to the rhythm and absorb all 
that energy and then send it back out to them!

   Ethan tweaked my head HARD!  I haven't danced that hard in a while.  
Amazing stuff.

   I lost track of the DJ's after that and spent a lot of time talking 
with my friends and hanging out in the chill room.  My only disapointment 
was that I didn't spend much time meeting new people, but rather I hung 
out with friends I won't be seeing for a long time... But that's OK since 
I'll be living with y'all real soon :>

   Huge Hugs to Bryce and Ethan and everyone else involved!

Peace, rave and happiness! 

 -Ernie

Hi All-

I wish I could have been with you all at FF3 but work & circumstance have 
me in L.A.

Not to fear. I still got a dose of some serious music. While you all were 
sweatin away at Kommotion I was waiting to get in to the Shark Club in 
downtown to L.A. to hear Frankie Bones (NY), Skylab 2000, Thee-O & Eli Star.
I had to wait to 3am which was kind of difficult but it ended up being 
worth it.

Frankie Bones was quite good (though a bit too much ego) but Thee-O and 
Eli Star (both L.A. dj's) were fucking AMAZINg. 

The music was from another planet. Eli Star worked the floor with serious 
psychedelic ambient trance acid house until 10AM. 

The best religious experience I've had in a long time.

Though L.A. is pretty fucked up  (like everywhere else) it has got some 
serious energy and mind blowing music.

C-YA soon in SF

peace------------------------------OUT------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>>!!

yeah, but shee-it, have heart, and check this out:

1.  my buddy Tonette's little girls were flower girls
    in my and Leslie's wedding; I met Tonette on funky-music,
    an email list just like this

2.  spent last tues night in LA with my pal AdW, backstage
    watching Public Enemy do a non-public show; I met AdW
    on funky-music and he is now a part of the musical projects
    I do an a very close friend.

3.  I work w/ a friend, one Niels, er, uh, hmmm... can't remember
    his last name...maybe some of you know him?!?!?!  he's another
    good friend...guess where i met him?  ding-ding-ding-ding!!!!
    YES!, that's right, another cyberpal  (sorry, cn't rezist..;-)

nutcases are even safer and more entertaining, just don't give them
your address!  really tho, if you think about it, were really dealing
w/ each others minds which has a nice kinda egalitarianism to it, you
don't base things on anything other than what someone "says", using
*this* medium.  when you get to know someone over the net their personality
tends to leak through the things they say.  sure some nut could invent
a persona to do evil shit and use the net to hide who they really were,
but the chances that something they did would appear inauthentic are
quite large, IMHO, i've seen people try to front on the net and it's
usually pretty obvious.

so i don't mean to detract, you *should* be careful, but i want to
counter the warning with optimism, i've got a slew of wonderful
friends i met on the net and wouldn't want anyone to think it has
to remain superficial...although, a deeper level of bonding occurred
w/ most of my net friends when we met in *real  life*, it now occurs
to me...

lat,

*

i hate to jump on a bitch-fest right after a blissful net.friends posting,
but boy do I *knowwhatyoumean* about kennedy (kidney?).  it's like she's
george bush's daughter or something...hu-huh, huh, uh-huh,huh, huh-huh...
she also apparetly claims to be a virgin Les just mentioned (my wife Les
hates her w/ much piss & vinegar too!), and said in some interview that
she was (or rather revealed that she was) exteremely rightwing, etc.  like
i'm surprised...the fact she even *mentions* the concept of virginity in
a 1 page article speaks volumes...i feel a newsgroup coming on...

I couldn't wait for saterday, so me + friends checked out
Mother Earth Sound System's party in the East Bay.  This was really
a great, great party.  The sound system was very nice.  The location
was a wonderful, isolated park that was on the shore of an east
bay inlet, and had a wonderful view of thousands of Oakland's 
brightest sodium-vapor lights.  All this party could have used
was a few more people.  The MESS folks are a very cool family
who are extremely friendly to new comers.  Support 'em!  

	FFIII:  One word: WOW!  Ovid:  You are probably one of the
few people who understands physics enough to truly relate
science to spirituality.  Don't miss the opportunity to talk with
this guy.  Resonate:  Where can I get myself a Realistic synthesizer?
	Regarding Laura's comments on sfraverbabes:  (Allow my
primal male instinct to invade a bit)  with or without shirts, you're
all HOT! and I love you ALL!  You're blasting the mainstream impression that
internet users are white, nerdy males.  You're the
coolest girls around (and ya'll can dance!)
	
	Anyone have any insider info on Futur?  Will this be hip or hype?

 On this weekend of the comercialized Woodstock anniversary - I want to
 mention that F&FIII had all the vibes and most of the activities of the
 original...

 There were great tunes spinning all night - with the introduction of new
 talent - great job Sean !
 There were black lights, strobes, lasers, video visions everywhere - with
 many people sporting trippy black light artwork.
 There was a "camping area" on the main stage.
 There was shared food and plenty of free water. 
 There were periodic rain showers in the form of someone spraying the crowd
 with water.
 There was ambience abounding in an ambient room that worked better this
 time.
 
 OK so there wasn't any nude bathing and the press hype was noteably 
 missing and it did pass by a bit faster than an entire weekend but I
 can guarentee that F&F III had all the best vibes of any! "magical,
 mystical" rockout ever produced !  

 If you missed Woodstock maybe you were young or not even here yet :-)
 If you missed F&F I & II we were warming up...
 If you missed last night you missed THE WOODSTOCK 94 of SF !!!
 ( Where were you Crunch ? )


 And it all came off because of many, many people's pitching in a lot or
 a little and of course, because everyone showed up "in the flesh"...

 Which takes me to my next post...

 I've noticed a few posting of late about the "virtual community" and how
 we don't have to help each other. We are just here for entertainment and
 if we left it would be like an interruption in a TV show. ( Boy IMHO is that
 person lost - or perhaps I read wrong and it's a joke. )

 WE ARE NOT A VIRTUAL COMMUNITY. Read that twice. 
 We are a REAL community LINKED by virtual means. Thus, if I want to talk
 with one of you - I can do so day or night at my leasure. I don't have to
 drive from my San Mateo home to the city to be in touch but I am in touch
 with real people ( not some entertaining TV shows! ). F&F III PROVED that 
 and it was BETTER - FAR BETTER - than the recent Come Unity or Wicked -
 IMHO (and yes I was at both!). 

 I do notice that some people do treat people they meet on-line like 
 entertainment. They flame, they insult, they don't ask questions first
 and so on - these are virtual people to them. If that's the way you want
 your world so be it.  But consider well....

 1) politicians treat people like "virtual vote machines". They respond
    when they must as far as they must but people they make laws for (OR
    AGAINST) are often NOT REAL to them. (Think about many drug laws are
    they sensitive to real people?) 

 2) IRS treats people like "virtual money machines". They respond as long
    as it's in their favor to do so.

 3) Businesses often treat people like "virtual consumers". We don't have
    to sell you stuff AND give you support AND service do we ? 

  I could go on - but you get the point. If you like the way situations
 like 1 -3 play out, then go ahead and join them as:

 4) People who treat on-line people as "virtual people". I don't have to
    be concerned about your feelings or help you since you are not part
    of MY REAL COMMUNITY. IMO if you do that, you just became one of the
    situations above and I don't want to hear you bitching about how 
    everyone around you doesn't care Etc.

 In the meantime if you do need your tire changed, or a ride Etc. I'll
 be more than willing to do what I can for the REAL community I read
 but who I talk with virtually.


 PS If you want to know what a virtual community is get SIM CITY or better
    yet Little Computer People. Those are truly virtual. The rest of us are
    REAL - even if we speak virtually......


  My more than $.02

 MIKE (YES I'M REALLY HERE*) CLAY


* And from what I experienced last night so are a LOT of other people!!!!

ooooo...this is such an interesting thread....

yo, Will..you say that the language we use must necessarily reflect the
cateogries to which we belong in the "real" world.  that our choices for
punctuation, the typos we leave behind, our grammar, emerge out of our
"real" personalities.  

by the same token, couldn't those of us who are particularly skillful with
language, those of us who understand its slipperynesses, synthesize whatever
virtual persona we want?  (i ain't no such wizard, by the way!) what i mean
is, language doesn't necessarily have to have any logical, self-evident
thing about it that marks it as coming from one person and not another.  
hence your suspicions concerning Ken's having been to a rave.

It is tempting to take your teasing (?) as  cold text without feeling
behind it.  don't you think it's part of the fun of the virtual universe
to allow such abstract concepts as "Ken" to exist, to play, to cause 
trouble, to grow, to observe & enjoy?  yet if you hadn't had this debate,
i would have never thought about the fact that i know lots of the "posters"
just through what they say here & not from parties.

you are all spirits who speak through my little Mac Plus!  now go shake
your booties, all of you!

PS  Oh my god, the sunset party was FABULOUS.  Friends n' Family was so
incredibly filled up with the neatest people!  Who named this one?  You
are a genius.  'cause that's exactly what it was!  yay yay ya! thankyou
for such a great party!

Friends & Family & FUN!

Komotion is such a great space, it's not perfect and doesn't have to be
. . . . it was hot in the big room but not completely unbearable
(I never sweated like I did at Heaven in Detroit when Cajmere and Dajae
performed) . . . . I thought *all* the DJs and performers were top 
notch, if anything the hallway crew was even more impressive, in part
because most ambient/chill spaces are so damn unclear on the concept
(e.g., the event in portland last weekend where the "ambient" was
so loud you didn't even want to be in the same room) . . . . the
dayglo paints and other fun stuff really made the space come alive . . . .
I concurred with Bryce that it was great to see some kids early on,
they looked like they were having fun with face painting and Gak . . . 
I'm really sorry I didn't stay until the end, both 'cause I missed
Giamma's set and helping on cleanup, but I was pure exhausted after
zooming down from Portland on 4 hours of sleep, a nice visit to
Gaia Mantra, two hours spinning at Ameba and another (unofficial)
hour to warm up before Sean came on, which was great because I finally
got to hear how it sounds with a decently loud system from behind
the wheelz of steel; I didn't really have a set selected so I just
tossed in the deep house I had in the record bag (knowing full well
the wondrous onslaught of trance about to unfold :) . . . . it was
a real hoot to give the folks at the bar my copy of Monk with the
really weird story about another event that supposedly occurred at
Komotion a while back . . . . i really liked turning loose to the
cavalcade of 303ish stuff all night . . . i was going to go to
Sunset this evening but got involved in really long listening 
session at Tweekin' and ended up NOT going to the Jerry Garcia
show at the Warfield (many miracle seekers out on Market), and
totally unexpectedly ended up at Bimbo's on Columbus watching
Gato Barbieri tonight (the first time I saw him was in 1978!),
then had a GREAT cannoli at one of the cafes so this weekend
definitely turned out ALL ACES and thanks to you all sfraves,
yer the greatest!

yeah, i agree it's cool to have *lunatic fringe*, if no one else does
it, I usually sign up for the job myself...of course when someone appears
*not* to have a real-world analog, it's *NATURAL* for folks to get
curious as well, I admit, i'm now curious about this "virtual ken".
does he come with "virtual barbie"? (pardon my sophmoric double entendre,
can't hep myself).  and he REFUSES TO APPEAR IN THE FLESH?!?!?  Ba-by,
you gots to wonder about that!!!  someone who refuses to "be real",
why?  are you a narc or a nerd, ken?  we'll likely figure it out by and
by...so what up, ken?  how come you won't come out and play?

wow, i didn't know he was touring again, i haven't even thought
of him in a while...i just picked up a bunch of new records by some
other 70's luminaries like bob james, curtis mayfield, leon haywood,
johnny "guitar" watson and gil-scott heron.  i'll post details upon request,
since it's more soul than house (-related) music, but i also have some
recent house/etc 12"'s i'll give quick descriptions of as soon as
i assimilate it...

Wow! What a party!

Once again everyone came and donated their sweat and ability and made
a wonderful party happen. A ton of thanks and love to everyone that
helped and to those that brought their smiles and good vibes.

The visuals were just excellent. I really liked the trippy Friends and
Family rainbow color-cycled stuff. Cool :). This time I tried varying
the lighting at times through the night, and it seemed to charge the
crowd. Once again, cool :).

The ambient room music was wonderful, and I'm often iffy about ambient
room music. Every time I walked through it was something new and
interesting. Often I'd hear this really neat stuff, and realize "oh
wow, this is live" :). It sounded that good.  I heard a lot of really
beautiful ethereal pieces that snagged me and I'd have to stay a
while.

The dance music was fucking _killer_. I thought Lee and Ethan played
some of the best sets I've ever heard.  They were just dead on in the
groove, and the progression was wonderful. The crowd was thrashed. I
don't know how many people I talked to who begged for mercy. And I've
never heard so much hootin and hollerin at one of our parties :). 

I had SO much fun spinning for you!!! You all were so nice and so
supportive that any nervousness I had went away in no time and all
there was left was the will to thrash :). And I made lots of goofs
(and learned lots of lessons ;)), but looking out there and seeing all
those smiles I just laughed it off and jammed on.  You made it
wonderful for me :).

Thanks to everyone who put their effort into making this party happen,
and thanks to YOU for bringing your good attitude and shakin booty to
this party. Your smiles and good vibe took this party into the
stratosphere. Wow.

Next time :)

Sean

PS - Once again, $3 bought you: killer ambient & dance, live
performances, free water, free fruit, visuals, lasers, ins & outs,
hassle free promoters & door people with _good_attitudes_, 2
bathrooms, body paints, a great sound system at a perfect volume
level, and about 8000 smiles :). Shop and compare.

PPS - How hot did it get? At center of the dance floor during peak, 91
degrees, 94% humidity. Whew! We told you :). But people were chugging
the free water like crazy, and as far as I know there were no
problems.

Perhaps this is a silly thing to go off on a tangent about,
but Kennedy is the only VJ on the channel with a personality.
Yeah, she's a Republican, but if you have heard her speak
about her politics, she shows herself to be pretty damn smart
and really with it... if all the Republicans out there had her
views, this would be a much less fucked up country (hell, if
the Democrats thought like her...).

Because she is young, intelligent, a woman and in a prominent
media position, she ends up speaking at lots of conservative
conferences that show up on whatever the conservative cable
channel is. Watch her beat up oldtimers about censorship and
defend sex-ed in schools and then talk about what a bitch she
is.

I wanted to stay out of this, but I'm finding myself getting annoyed
at some of the antagonism here.  That someone behaves a little differently 
than us and doesn't seem to be conforming to some unwritten law
concerning SFRaver social intercourse is no reason to spew suspicion
and derision in hir direction.  Ken has never really "refused" to do 
anything.  He just doesn't come much, that's all.  Before I started 
raving, I was not much of a socialite either, shying away from most social 
situations, especially ones that had an air of cliquishness and 
advertised rejection towards nonconformists.

I agree that because understanding raving is primarily experiential, his
perspective comes across as rather uninformed at times.  But I don't see 
how *challenging* him to participate and putting him on the defensive is
constructive for anyone.  

Anyway: kudos to Ethan & co. for another successful Ph&Ph!  Sunset was
Great too.  Coming next: FMR, Future, Boogie Buffet... Things seem to be 
*really* picking up around here. d:-)

...who wishes people would lay the hell off Ken, esp. in public?  Besides the
fact that I think it's rude to our friend Ken, I'm not particulary interested
in all these is "Who is Darkman"-style messages.

(p.s. sorry I couldn't stay at F&F longer, but I had to get up early Sunday;
I somehow let my rich-boy friend talk me into helping turn SF into the
bourgeois petroleum-burning playground that is the Great SF Treasure Hunt...
and the worse part is I kinda had fun.  Oh well, at least a worthy charity
is $35 richer.)

No, Stevie, you're not.

Encouraging someone's mystique is one thing- but 
challenging someone's net "identity" serves to 
discredit his/her voice & that's no fun.

The invitations that have been extended to Ken to 
"show himself" have mostly been genuine; on 
the "i'd like to meet you" & "join us" level. However,
some invitations have been offered as dares, 
as in "I dare you to...."- that's very 
counterproductive, no?

Re: F&FIII- way bummed to have missed this one-
why is it my calendar always runs against F&F? 
Mayday! M'aidez! somebody come and fix it for me!

I promised myself to do a triathlon this year-
did it yesterday. these things should come with

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]

in the delerium of the heat, i watched the MTV coverage of
woodstock yesterday, mostly hoping to see some coverage of ravestock

as my boss just put it:
"People keep saying that this cant possibly be the first one,
this is all about money and commercialism, but so was the first one.
The bands played expecting to get paid, and the promoter was planning
on making a lot of money, and everyone went there to listen
to some music while getting high and getting laid.  I really 
dont see that much of a difference, except that the first time,
they werent able to keep people out."

Really, i have to agree.. Quite frankly, woodstock looked like fun.
Running around in the mud for three days with seemingly friendly
people and little violence, being able to check out some cool
but probably far from top of the line VR stuff, listening to
a lot of cool music, sounds like fun. Forget the relationship
to the first one, hell forget the first one altogether,
its mostly a myth anyway.  After that, its just a big party,
like any european festival, just that theirs tend to be a bit cheaper
and probably dont have a day long wait to get out.

Funny things about woodstock '94 as seen through MTV:

People saying "There is such diverse group of people here:
old hippies, young hippies, ravers, etc etc."
and they were showing pictures of such people as the person was listing them:
Old White Hippie, Young White Hippie, White Raver, White etc etc.

Green Day being interviewed, TWICE. Okay it was one interview in two parts,
but they totally blew of Chris COnnely in the first part,
so i dont know why they did teh second part cuz it only got worse.
They basicaly sat there making wierd faces at teh camera every once in awhile
or just sitting there looking at the ground, whil saying 
that the wanted to be the next sha na na and saying 
"Actually i think we will just get up and tell everyone *bleep*" to which 
Chris responded "Well Country Joe already led the Fish cheer"

Green Day also looked like they were having the most fun..
while Trent Reznor got much muddier, green day was actually playing
their instruments and it looked like they (NiN) were all too
wasted to know what was going on

there was some other wierd stuff.. but ObKennedy.

Kennedy was a DJ in LA called the Virgin Kennedy, so it
might have been a reference to that.  Yes from what i hear/read
she is really conservative, but really.. who cares.

The rave coverage was totally lame, but if MTV wanted something
better they would have gotten it. For the most part, i thought
it was kinda funny, but it had nothing to do with ravestock.

Kennedy is actually the only thing that made it worthwhile.
It was kinda wierd how they stuck the two really stupid VJ's together
out in the mess, and had connely and tabitha sorenberger together
as the slightly intellectual banter VJS, 
and rakkman and kennedy and allison as teh disenfrachised type VJ's
who rag on MTV and all teh other VJ's and woodstock altogether.
Listening to Kennedy and Allisons side comments made it somewhat bearable.
Especially after that one idiot said "Man.. theres even deerS at woodstock"
and then it switched over to them and they said "DeerS??" and laughed
(he's not an idiot cuz he doesnt know the plural of deer,
but little intelligence was displayed throughout his ramblings)

One for the I-told-you-so dept.  Check out the full page inside spread in
   today's NY Times... the photographer who took the headline shot is a
   genius: although the caption describes the scene as the remains of the
   concert and the bodies standing, huddled stragglers amidst the pouring
   rain, mud and hell -- what it really looks like is a scene straight out
   of a {Rwanda, Ehtiopia, ...} encampment.  The accompanying articles
   compare the concert to Spring Break, compelte with topless,
   baseball-capped guys, "Co-Ed Naked Rugby" tshirts, etc.  Two women who
   went painted themselves after going topless, stood for photo-ops and it
   was estimated that 5,000 gawkers took them up on the offer.

I feel bad for the folks who feel as we do, but don't have access to
   something like F+F3 (whose awesomeness has been amply captured in the
   continuous stream of posts - DJs: you are god(dess)like.  May your
   happiness repay you for your deeds)  Imagine these less-fortunate, who
   wish to trance, feel vibe, experience... - and whose only chance to get
   away from the folks for a weekend, camp out and community - is to drop
   $135 at some sleezy promoter, stand in mile-long lines to go to the
   bathroom, and otherwise lose horribly.  I feel worse for the people who
   didn't know better and walked away thinking they had been part of
   something big (as opposed to just being part of something large).

I hope I'm not bitching/preaching to the choir here, but please understand:
   as a relatively recent arrival to the bay area, I can safely safe that
   the vast majority of our beloved country is not like this.  And, now
   knowing the difference, it pains me to think of friends and family who
   don't.  And we should care: mandatory sentencing, possession seizure,
   random testing, etc. are voted on the national level, which makes the
   bay area count as a handful of votes.  A largely irresponsuble group of
   people such as what descended on Saugerities is not only silly and
   stupid, but also ammunition for the conservative set who see the entire
   lot of us as irresponsible "kids" (ie. under 30) who need to be
   protected from ourselves, who need to be stopped from influencing their
   children, who need to grow up, etc.  Trust me: most of the country
   wouldn't believe you if you said that you've met lots of people who've
   repeated done {x,l,...} and hold day jobs other than pumping gas.

But I don't want to end of a sorrowful note: this was a very awesome
   weekend, punctuates beautifully by fnf3, by the people, the music, and
   the feelings.

later,
adam

The little bit of Woodstock coverage I saw on MTV was about par for
the course.  MTV has never ever risen above the on the air content-
to-volume quotient of its earliest jocks (remember Martha Quinn and
J.J. Jackson, anyone?).  Kennedy is a particular horror; she's a
Lake Oswego, Oregon (we call it Lake El Swanko here) Young Republican
type, totally self-absorbed.  Borrowing the old Dorothy Parker jibe,
she has Personality, but it runs all the way from A to B.  I heard
about one on air bit she did waking people up in their tents. 
Probably thought she was Making Their Day.  I would have rubbed her
self-reverential face in some mud.  

>From M's report on the Well, it looks like The Orb stole the show,
they played nearly three hours on saturday morning and did You Know
What that anyone who as experienced the sunrise PLUR vibe knows about :)

We had a great time at F&F and I didn't miss Woodschlock one little bit.

Well, I may be crotchety
or lost or just a big meanie
but I didn't intend to get in over my head
on this virtualness idea

There is a difference between just knowing 
someone virtually and knowing them in person.

I like this list which is nothing but the people on it.
I don't think it is so Exotic.  It is the lost art of
letter writing but sped up a little bit and with the twist
of jumping right in with hundreds of mostly anonymous pals.
I guess I relate pure virtualness to a degree of anonymity.
Having only your words to move past this.

TV is too passive and didn't work so well.
My call to be entertained stands.

******* 

I went to Sunset yesterday.  I'd guess at least a 100+ people.
I thought I would just drop by for a little bit but stayed until
9 or 10.  The music was good - somehow accessable, not so hard -
perfect for a balmy afternoon.  That hill is amazing.  It was very
cool to look up at everyone dancing and enjoying the view.

Someone needs to bring a big flag and a horse 
and just Conquer that baby ...
for the Nation, man

hi y'all,
just saw 's,d &D' and really liked it! there are several comments i want to
make: i thought the movie eschewed the political and focused too much
on the personal. it is hard to see from the movie that one reason for
teh kulture which developed in hollnad is the result of HUNDREDS of years
of democracy - yes, holland's democracy is older the the us! i think it is
from something like 1580's; dutch folx, help me out on this! so it is not
something built overnight.
the other question i had, as applied to us, is whether the dutch experiment
would also work on a larger scale. holland has 50 mil. people, us 250.
also, the size of holland - tiny- compared to that of us, might mitigate
against the development of such a culture, a participatory culture, with
tons of interactions between people. what do other people think ?
take care/shalom

	I would like to report some quick status on MESS.  Myself and my friend
	Rob arrived shortly after midnight.  They were still setting up and
there
	was about 20 people there.  At around 12:45 the music was going.
	The site was enclosed by trees on one side and water on the other.  The
	dance area was on grass which was both a blessing and a disaster.  The
	grass absorbed the energy while dancing which made it easy on the
	knees but hard to keep going for long periods of time.

	The good features of this event were the positive attitude, smiles and
	etcetera.  The sound system was perfectly balanced between highs and
lows
	and very clear.  Mother nature had a show of her own for us, residual

I found that to be so evil, all of these people continually saying, "it's
all about coming together, no matter who you are, in the spirit of unity."

No. It was all about having enough money to be there and be cool.

No mention of who was playing at ravestock, just kennedy making snide
remarks about liking the music and her dancing really silly. erg.

It all looked really horrid but yet I still watched hours of the
coverage - talk about pathetic. :)

We started 1 1/2 hours early! Starting setup 4-5 hours early is a
*great* way to reduce stress if you're throwing an event.  Not only
that, but the DJs get to spin longer :) and people who show up early
get music from minute one.

In my last post I forgot to mention the Komotion people, who are a
dream to work with. What a great collective!

I'll have to join the chorus and say that F&F3 was AWESOME!!  The music was
great (especially Sean and Lee and Ethan - you guys were INTENSE!) and I've
never danced so hard or sweated so much in my life.. :)  The vibe was
incredible, lots of smiles and laughs everywhere, and hugs from people I
don't even know.. :)

The chill room was great, even if it was sort of narrow and lots of people
were (ick) smoking in there.. But the live ambient stuff going on made it
totally worth it!  The blacklight art project went pretty well, too.. Thanks
to Bryce for providing the paints and the tarp!  

I saw lots of happy faces (lots of them new) and people who might be signing
up to this list because of the party, too..  Phred and I were working the 
door for a little bit so the Komotion guys could get out and dance and we
were getting compliments left and right, as well as questions and lots of
interest!

I had a wonderful time, and I'm definitely proud of being an
sfraverbabeinablacksportsbra after this event!  Every time I go to an
sfraves party, I'm always looking forward to the next one.. They just keep
getting better!

Hugs to everyone..

P.S. If you didn't know, I was the one who looks like susie from behind and
was dressed kinda like Laura..  Pretty soon I think nobody's going to be
able to tell us sfravergurls apart!  :)

Hi Folx--

EVERYTHING has already been said (now that Sean's
added bit about the Komotion folx came through) about
the perfection called F & F III (and--echoing Mike Clay--
where *were* you, Crunchie?! Hope all is well!  You 
*weren't* at Woodschlock, were yuh?  Guys in our gen
know better than *that,* don't we?).

Thanks to all the folx who put in sooooo much love,
devotion and just plain hard work into F&FIII--it proved
once again that whatever goes around comes around...and
in this post-Celestine Prophecy world it's happening 
increasingly simultaneously!

Thanks to all the folx who either put up with or did not
put up with my gestalt with Ken. By pushing our buttons
as far as they will go we find out a lot about ourselves.
Mike Clay (again) is right when he says that we are *not*
a virtual community but the virtual extension of a real
(actual) community.  Through threads like Ken and I and       
others have had we have an opportunity to learn a great
deal. I won't tell you what I learned because that's not
the same as what you learned--and in this case may not even
be relevant to what you learned.  The gestalt is over.

ciao fer niao,
Willi

I just received a phone call from a NON-net raver in Stockton, a woman
named Aimee who was wearing blue and yellow striped pants.  She called
to ask for help in locating a camera that she'd brought to the party.

It's a Samsung camera with a zoom lens, and was loaded with black and 
white film.  Aimee said the last time she saw it was a bit after 3:00 am.  
She said she spent a lot of time inside up on the stage in the right 
corner.

If anyone has seen it or found it, PLEASE write back to me and I'll
give you her phone number.  I really hope it can be located, there's
not much worse than losing something at a party (or worse yet having
something taken).

Thanks,

Laura

X-Mts: smtp
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

q: A friend of mine and i were debating the merits of apple's high
   consultant/employee ratio (>30%).  I expessed the viewpoint I've been
   taught, that the high consultant rates make it a financial lose in the
   steady state (ie. one year of paying a consultant is more expensive than
   one year of paying an employee).  He instead suggested that this isn't
   the case, which is not unreasonable given the math of my own
   experiences.  When asking the obvious question about why everyone
   doesn't use lots of consultants, he suggested lower morale and team
   building issues as being important.

   Simultaneously, we were talking about the smallness of the bay area
   computing world.  This then prompted me to ask: Wouldn't the
   company-of-consultants model work well if consultants were expected to
   interact with full timers and each other, and to treat their employment
   as a short duration full-time employment.  Consider:

1. "Permanent" employees average two years at a company in computers.  Even
   in other fields, people typically don't get (real) raises- they find a
   new employer and renegotiate.  Successful promotions tend to be closer to
   re-hirings rather than pay-for-experience.  The exception is the
   extortion-based raise tied to indispensibility.

2. My own experiences are that, in this industry and in 1994, full timers
   don't really form deep relationships with a company, permanent or
   temporary.  At the last company I worked for, I was definitely a
   consultant, but I formed much closer relationships with the company and
   with my coworkers than many of the lifers.  I still keep in close
   contact, and it's understood that there's a small (but real) chance that
   I'll someday work for them or otherwise do business with them again.

3. As a matter of job security, I think people are starting to realize that
   there really isn't any de facto security: you're paid for your skills
   set and it's your job to continuously upgrade them and to stay marketable.
   And I also think that people are learning to relax about this and not
   lose sleep that they'll lose their job (permanently) tomorrow.  It takes
   years for a skill to be unmarketable.  It takes far less time to acquire
   new skills.

4. Team building is not as long term or important as it's given credit for.
   While I know of folks who stick around for the atmosphere, the fact is
   that 20K pay raises lure away amazing numbers of talented people
   (especially within a geographic area).  This is quite apart from the
   greater mobility that greater connectivity has brought us.  It's been my
   own experience that teams that last five years are rare, and like war,
   they lose steam after 5-7 at the most... This easily fits into the
   model, since 5 years is basically a small number of contract renewals,
   and it makes it much easier for everyone when the team does break up:
   you see it coming months before the first key person drops.

   Anyway, you can see the direction I'm heading: wouldn't it be an overall
   win for many (most?) people to be consultants.  As I understand it, more
   than 30% of Apple are consultants.  While astronomical by today's
   standards, this seems like a reasonable figure in the proposed model.
   Here are some of the ramifications I've thought of.  Please add:

 - the smallish community would get even more tightly knit, since you'd
   have worked with many more people during your lifetime.  Again, from
   experience, it's kind of neat to shuffle around a bit and get
   opportunities to work with extraordinary and talented people, and not
   stay holed up with one set of senior folks too long.  Senior folks seem
   to like to see periodic shuffling in the ranks as well, with junior
   members sticking around for a few years before taking more senior
   positions elsewhere.  In time, six degrees of separation would become
   two.  The last few times I've met new people in the cs community out
   here, I've had no trouble tracking down a reference with one or two
   phone calls and/or email.

 - the health insurance issues change somewhat, since people would pick
   his/her own, and it wouldn't be tied to your employer- since if people
   shuffle companies every 6mon-2yrs, it doesn't make sense to tie the
   group plan to the company.

   It also means that the HMOs etc. are under the gun of real competition
   from the customers directly, instead of from management...

 - None of this excludes the possibility of signing five- and ten- year
   contracts for senior folks who've really settled down.  In this way,
   it's like those neomarriage things where people marry for ten years at a
   time, sometimes going off with other partners for a while and coming
   back later.  Key idea: one (set of) relationship(s) is rarely forever,
   and it often makes sense to circulate a little, for variety, to learn...

 - Companies themselves would (I think) do better by having more outside
   experience circulating through.  It's not bad now, but the entire
   concept of rigid corporate culture (eg. HP's hardware centric stance)
   cannot be good for competitiveness.  Obviously, companies would be more
   nimble during recessions and company-specific downturns.  In reality, I
   think it's clear that if a company can't afford the employees, layoffs
   happen anyway, so the morale argument here is a bit flimsy, no?

 - Clearly, this would work better for some jobs than others.  Senior
   researchers often work on projects lasting a decade or more, with few
   noteworthy intermediate results.  Some even include physical constraints
   (ie. archeology), so clearly corporate or government sponsorship is
   necessary: in the extreme case, spies aren't going to start working for
   other governments every six months, and astronauts aren't going to work
   for fly for the "other" NASA :-)

 - I would think this interacts nicely with the emerging telecommuting and
   "virtual office" culture, since remote consulting would boil down to
   whose internal email and news you receive, and which videoconferences
   you attend.  Working for a new company would amount to negotiating a
   contract, getting on their net, and reading a company FAQ-like
   background sheet on the permanent and current set of employees, and
   reading a month's worth of back email (to get up on the current topics
   of conversation).

Questions:
 - what are the real numbers here?  What are the financial implications of
   converting a salaried position into a contracted position?  what other
   morale-related issues have I missed?
 - what other implications can you think of?

Your thoughts appreciated.  Please respond to the entire cc: and To: list
   if you do.

Thanks again,
adam

ps. This started because the person with whom I had the original
    conversation was buying a pair of concert tickets from me... and he
    turned out to have previously worked two cubicles away from a friend of
    mine.  I'd say "how unusual", but it really happens all the time now.

Greetings!  I had a GREAT time at Friends and Family.  My good time is
directly attributable to all of you on the list who shared in the creation
of this marvellous rave, and all our new friends and family who visited
with us once again.

at best, i can only recall a montage of a very few high points for me during
this one, because there were so many.  the graffiti walls in the hall and
loo lounge, especially the phrase "eat more pork rinds".  i also remember 
the psychedelic sun on the plastic. i remember the diffraction pattern
of the laser shifting on the zodiac poster as it wafted in the breeze,
a red dot shifting over the face of the moon.  i remember several children
running from one end of the space to the other, laughing, asking questions,
being body painted.  i remember hearing and dancing to many of my favorite
tunes.  i remember ethan's day-glo boxers with smiley faces :)  i remember
it being so hot and humid that i /had/ to take off my shirt (a first to
me--i guess i can call myself a "shirtless male hunter-gatherer" now :) ).
i remember people yelling on the DJs as they made mix after mix after
incredible mix.  i remember a woman who gave out beautifully gift wrapped
sacks of candy.  i remember awesome live music in the multimedia lounge.
i remember loaning my car to one of the folks from komotion so they could
get more things to drinks, and thinking how great that we were so many so
early in the evening.  i remember being so excited when it seemed so early,
and there were folks lined up waiting to get in, and seeing them come in,
and not having met many of them before.  i remember talking with friends
(so many smiling people!) on the sidewalk.

i had a wonderful time, and i'm so glad to hear from many of you that you
enjoyed yourselves, too!

gee whiz, i'm really sorry, i didn't intend to offend, but
was feeling fairly smart alecky as is my bent on occasion.
i found the whole concept pretty amusing but should probably
have kept my amusement to myself, as i had thot the whole thing
to be a humorous (i.e. intended to be) discussion when obviously
such was not the case.  i wholeheartily apologize for hurting
*anyone's* feelings, *even* if ken *is* a lurking police officer...
[which i confess i really think is unlikely, and insignificant]

i've really been quite giddily slaphappy recently, probably on
account of being on vacation for quite a while.  i know vacation
is hard to come by sometimes, but gaoddamn! i've got to plug it
cuz i don't think i've had my attitude adjusted this nicely in
*ages*.  by hook, crook, or whatever you all should get away from
your day to day when you get the chance, cuz it definitely feels
good!  meanwhile, i'll try to keep unwarranted smart remarks to
a minimum...

I didn't go, but I watched some of the MTV coverage, chatted on the
woodstock IRC channel, perused the Well's woodstock WWW page, listened
to some bits on scrambled payperview.  I even watched some chunks of the 
original on PBS, for perspective.  Why?  Well how often does a *party* get
so much attention?  It sure beat coverage of OJ saga.  The event was 
important simply because there was so much attention focused on it.

First of all, it was clear that this was a completely mainstream america
event.  There were families there, yuppies & their kids, teenages from
suburbia; ie. everyone's next door neighbor & coworker, along with a 
handful of contrived weirdos from last years halloween parade. 

Drugs: There were two big issues here.  The first one was the outright
banning of alchohol.  Plenty got in, but alchohol seemed to be more
feared by the promoters than *anything* despite it's legal and 
socially-sanctioned status.  The second issue was that, of course, lot's 
of people were doing lot's of drugs.  It was reported in a rather ho hum 
manner - this was "woodstock" afterall - but there was a refreshing
lack of hysteria about it.  And with nearly zero security and a third
of a million people crowded together in near anarchy, nothing too terrible 
resulted.  Amazing.

There was a rave.  Didn't get much coverage, but it happened, and 
amazingly enough, everyone survived that too.  Maybe the next time an 
ambitious promoter tries to get a site together for a Megarave somewhere, 
local officials might be just a little less frightened of the concept.

Tamara whines:
>I found that to be so evil, all of these people continually saying, "it's
>all about coming together, no matter who you are, in the spirit of unity."
>No. It was all about having enough money to be there and be cool.

Yeah, people went there to be cool, but they *did* come together.  And
from what I could see, most seemed to be having fun and there seemed to be
a positive vibe.  Considering 100,000 people got in for free, anyone who 
wanted to haul there asses up there could of gotten in.  All you needed
was some awareness, a friend with a car, the willingess to endure... kinda 
like getting to an FMR.

The promoters never pretended that this was not a commercial event.  The
amount of cynicism surrounding it was enormous, but the party went off 
anyway.  When a successful party happens in relative harmony with the
surroundings community, it helps the cause of parties everywhere.

Many, many heartfelt thanks to everyone that helped make this party go as
totally off as it did; it was so fucking great to be at a *rave* again! One
of the better nights of my entire life. Thank you!

Everyone was fantastic, but highlights of the night, for me, were: 

Sean Casey's amazing set; forget debut, this was one of the best sets I've
ever heard -- period. 

Giamma *mixing in* from CD to Jon D's last record. Blew a fair number of
minds I'd say. Hot shit Giamma; not to mention the rest of his set --
totally amazing. 

Visuals. I just *cannot* say enough about what Michael Clay and his friend
Jim did. Best viusals I've ever seen. There was an amazing sequence (all
night really :) of 3-4 image composites featuring european architecture.
One had a 3 spired cathedral overlayed with 3 angels, overlayed with some
lotus-like floral stuff in the middle...in the morning the words 'friends
and family' spiraled of into psychedelia, followed by 'rave on', 'love on'.
Yet again, an amazing talent right in our midst. Hats off to you Michael.

The energy. The people. I saw people there I haven't seen at a rave in
*years*. Big smiles, hugs all night, totally entirely positive. Not even
one remotely negative thing happened to me all night.

I thought the multimedia, ambient chill-whatever worked especially well
this time too. Not only was it really beautiful in there (somehow it felt
like dawn all night) but the sound isolation was really adequate and the
wildly eclectic variety of fine music that went down was just great. Fine
job everyone. 

And the graffiti, legendary. Best inscription of the night: 

eat more pork rinds +)

Hats off to all the folks at Komotion too. What a great group of people;
volunteers actually showed up *in the morning* to help us clean up and coil
muddy cables... Class act, start to finish.

And the kids...  :)   :)   :) boy did they have fun! All painted up and
just running all over. Right on.

 :)

Budget for the party:

 - promotion:        $30
 - u-haul:           $31
 - fans:             $50
 - misc. supplies:   $30
 - fruit:            $33
 - breakfast for 8:  $50

 - total:            $224 :)


The next F&F will be Saturday, September 24th. Bryce is going to 
coordinate this one as I will be getting to know the newest memeber of 
my friends and family :)

lots of love, and thanks again!

I just want to add another note of thanks to Michael and jim for the
visuals.  Best I've seen at *any* party in a good long while.  And
the F&F logo was Rilly Kewl!  The peak moment was during Sean's set
when they were showing all the buildings being demolished -- it
matched *perfectly* with the mood of the music without it being
clash-bang-destructo, more like a different version of that famous
loop of the milk drop.

And finally, of course, a big thanks to Ethan and Bryce!  Now before
you boys start with the "aw shux" routine, I think it's perfectly
appropriate to take some credit.  You say you can't do it without us,
but we LOVE to do it with you!

Er, if I had paid $135 for entry tix plus everything else to get to the
event, I probably would have made damn sure I thought I was having fun,
despite anything to the contrary.  Meaning, the psychology of "we've
committed the time and energy to have fun now, so we're going to have fun
now..." is apparently very prevalent in modern day America.  You don't have
to be a conspiracy theorist to see that this is how modern media creates its
own news now - people have become way too malleable.  Woodstock '69 wasn't
designed to be great, it just sort of happened to have been great through
accident.  "This Generation's Woodstock" would have had to have been a mostly
spontaneous gesture - I submit that the most successful era of the FMR's (end
of 92 to end of 93) were mini-woodstocks for our generation.

  While attending a BBQ with a friend last saturday i caught Kennedy's
interviews.  She was incessently rude and would zip open
the tents of people who were sleeping stick the camera's lights and her
microphone in the person's face and expect them to say something. I was
amazed no one said anything nasty to her, but then again that might've
been edited out. After doing this her report continued on the sense that
"Well if its late and everyone is asleep lets check out the rave!" 
  So she then went over to the ravestock event and attempted to ask
this one particularly e'ing chap how he was doing.  He responded by just
dancing along and staring out at the camera with a smile.

  At this particular point i was enjoying the coverage and blurted out:
"Hah! He's e'ing his ba*ls off!" 
 Unfortunately i forgot the atmosphere of people i was with, and was 
later scoulded by my friend for the comment ;)

thanks so much, phred, and thank you /all/, sfraves!  it really is an "aw
shux" kinda thing...i know that i do work on these things, and it's really
nice that everyone appreciates that work.  but, really, i don't do any more
than i can, and only with the talents that i possess.  i truly and honestly
believe that i am just another partygoer.  it wouldn't be a party of the
magnitude and quality we just experienced without you all, and without
everyone who came, or talked with us about what they like and don't like
about parties, or those who threw parties we went to and liked or didn't
like.  Friends and Family is an important nexus in our community, and i
want it to continue being a confluence of as many people, ideas, visions,
experiences, and friends and families:  in that way, i believe, lies the
self-refreshing, ever-morphing, always creative matrix our hyper-circle of
friends and family expresses itself in.  

thanks to all of you who acknowledge my contribution to friends and family,
and other events.  in acknowledging my contribution, you are (in my view)
acknowledging those very same qualities in yourselves.  Bravo/brava
everyone!  we sure can throw a great party!

Well, I just *had* to write about this party-- even if I do have to log 
on here in Davis to do it. (Thank you, Peter, for loaning me that 
laptop-- just gotta get a female-female converter...)

Sean got me cranked.

Lee got me flying.

Ethan killed me and wiped the floor with me.


The atmosphere wasn't just warm in temperature -- i'm still *totally* 
high off the vibe that was just rushing through the place :) :) :)

I met a *record* number of people from the list! I even got to talk with 
alot of folks at some length, a rare thing and a good one. :)

It was also wonderful to find out that there are *so many* folks who are 
still into YSH.  :) :) :)

Yeah, there were a heck of alot of us sfraverbabesinblacksportsbras, 
weren't there?

Well, since this is coming back to the screen about two single letters 
per minute, at 2400 baud, I'm going to have to conclude later.


A big thank you and I love you to all the folks that came, and especially 
to Ethan, Bryce, Sean, myself, Matt, Greg, Mike (visuals) and Keith 
(Komotion) for their wonderful energy and dedication to sfr and to each 
other -- hard work never felt so good!

Maui

ps: and thanx for breakfast, Ethan!

Okay, let's clear this up (especially since this was the very first point 
of contention weeks ago :-) ).

[Paranoia mode on]

You cannot tell who is an undercover police officer.

Either on the net OR in person.

Sometimes, you might be able to tell that someone IS an undercover police 
officer, either if they are inept or if they don't care whether you know.

However, just because you once identified one or think you identified one, 
doesn't mean that those same patterns would apply to all others.

Even watching someone "rave" or pop an E is no guarantee, because the mind 
can always think something like "I did it for my country and the children" 
or some such silly rationalization.

So, you never can tell.  You might even be married to one. :-)

I'd like to say "And by the way, I'm not a police officer", but it really 
doesn't help you, because you could always think "maybe he's lying".

And, from my perspective, anyone else on sfraves or in any club could be a 
police officer.

It's just like secret agents, you can't tell if they're a double agent or 
a double-double agent. :-)

[Paranoia mode off]

So, big deal.

Remember that police officers are human beings just like anyone else.

>From some posts here, it seems that a warm rational conversation 
which appeals to the police officers as being part of "us" rather than 
"them" has some times been very effective in getting lenient treatment (as 
well as preventing "us" from creating a mental "them").

So, keeping putting flowers in the gun barrels. :-)

Hey Jack,

A couple tracks to get you started:

Robot Man "Do Da Doo--Plastikman's Acid House remix." This the track that 
I played that Laura mentioned earlier. Also, check out anything else by 
Richard Hawtin/Plastikman which includes....

Fuse "Substance Abuse." Older track that you should still be able to find 
lying around.

Bobby Konders "Nervous Acid" You should be able to find bootlegs of this 
classic in record stores. 

Astral Matrix "High Tide" Spankin new track that roars! Pretty simple, 
but effective.

Saint Etienne "Like a Motorway--David Holmes/Dust Brothers remix." Two 
different styles, both wicked (technically, I would only consider the 
Holmes mix "acid".)

Project 4007 "It's our turn DJ Duke remixes." Floor burner. Check out the 
"DJ Duke Acid Groove." The only down side to this song is that was released 
about six months ago and probably been played thrice daily since.

Hardfloor--anything by this group, but listen first to "Aceperience" and
their remix of Robert Armani's "Circus Bells" on Robert Armani's double
pack remix album. 

Phuture--anything by them, but especially "We are phuture," "Acid Trax,"
and maybe the latest--"Mental Breakdown." Phuture is basically DJ Pierre
and Roy Davis, two pioneers of the 303 sound. I'm a bit disappointed in
most of the newer releases of Phuture since they only seem to be collages
of the older tracks. But if you can't find the older tracks, the newer
ones are as good as any. 

Underground Resistance-- "Acid Rain (1-3)" More 303s than you can 
hallucinate.

A few names to look out for:
Sven Vath, Caspar Pound, Ege Bam Yasi, Aphrohead, Acid Junkies, and Niko.

Some Labels to pay attention to:
Plus8, Strictly Rhythm (for your Acid house needs--one warning, though: 
this label also release a lot of main stream house as well....), 
Djax-up-beats, Trax, Eye-q, Harthouse, Labworks, and many of the smaller 
Detroit and Chicago labels, i.e. Definitive, Emotive, Nugroove, etc....

Have fun.
Lee

This is true.  However, in the case of "Woodshlock"/"Greedstock"'94, I 
found the media prepublicity to be enormously cynical and negative.
If we want to talk about being "cool"; slamming Woodstock '94, and the 
capitalistic/MTV angle seems to have been the cool thing to do for the 
past couple of months, and still is I suppose.  Talk about an obvious 
target.  But hey, I was as cynical as anyone, and I still wouldn't have 
paid to go.

Woodstock '94 was designed to be great (I guess) and therefore seemed 
doomed to fail.  The fact that it succeeded at all was largely an accident, 
IMO.  A shitload of people (nonravers, nonPLUR devotees) came together with 
minimal authoritarian structure and uncomfortable accomodations.  They 
managed to coexist in relative harmony for the sake of music and the chance 
to share in a unique experience.  I'm having a hard time seeing the "evil" 
in it, that's all.

The thing that I'm still waiting to hear reported is how symbolic 
Woodstock 94 is of the entire generational issue.  All of the cynical 
press coverage is along the lines of "it was better when we were young.
Kids today are so capitalistic and shallow."

But -- these are the same people who did the original Woodstock, a symbol
of the peace and love non-materialistic 60s generation, who are now trying
their best to gouge $100 from their own children in generation X, then 
blame us for destroying one of their most loved icons.

That was from the awesome film Koyanisquattsi (my contribution to the
nights visuals :) by Goddfrey Reggio (with soundtrack by Phillip Glass,
perhaps one of *the* most sampled musicians in techno; the vapor space
intro for example...) Michael also added real time effects to it later in
the evening as well. There are long slow motion shots of people walking up
the street in las vegas...he kind of solarized this close up of an old man
turning and looking deep into the camera..his face kind of bubbled and
flared....

Lee's suggestions were pretty exhaustive but....

Keep your eyes open for work by Random XS (on DJAX), *great* new acid. Also
most stuff on Important Records (German) especially Acrid Abeyance...this
stuff can get *real* hard :) Similarly the Psycho Tribes (Labworks,
Germany) label has got loads of excellent deep trancy acid...

One of my all time favorites in the classic acid house vein has got to be
"Land of Confusion", by Armando...I've got it on Warehouse but I think the
remixes of it are available as DJAX-UP 155...Also in the acid house vain
check out the Baker Track series by Rodney Baker on Rockin House...Minimal
but great mixing tools. On the minimal tip good acid coming out of Italy as
well, check out Acid Tools/Randmoizer (A/B side) on Muzak...

I just love acid fiends :)

Oh yeah, MUST HAVE: The Two Full Moons and a Trout Remixes, double pack by
Union Jack on Rising High (another great label)... my favorite record(s)
over the last couple months :) 

see ya

i second this, and lee's suggestions, too.  I would like to add my personal
favorite 303 based EP:  TTB002, by Richard Brown.  This looks like an indie
release.  I picked it up in SD, and have heard reports it showed up in 
Primal.  3 of the 4 tracks are outstanding: TTB303, Flange-o-matic, and
Electronics for Dogs.  Buy this record if you see it!  i have heard reports
of a TTB003 out that is a wanker, so watch out.

Also, i recommend Generation of Sound's "Feel It", and Solar Quest, both
on Chocci's Chewns.  Outstanding 303.  Solar Quest has a track that has a
303 sounding like bagpipes!

And, if you can only buy one thing, get the Plastikman double EP:  this is
an oldie, but an absolute classic.  Be on the lookout for the ElektroStatik
EP as well...my favorite Hawtin tracks.

Also, an older set of releases are on the Edge label, often seen in BPM,
and in Orange County.  #5 and 9 are awesome.

Ummm.. i dunno i have paid 20 bucks and driven for
3 hours through the middle of nowhere to get to a party more than a few times.
And you know...  very few people there seemed to have an attitude of
"well dammit, i've gone through this much trouble, im going to force myself
to have fun" 
it was either one of bitching and moaning about the whole thing
or they were having fun...
but unless it was a subconscious thing...

most of the people i know who say that whole "im going to enjyo myself"
thing, spend their whole time saying that and bitching
about why all the reasons why they are going to just go and
have a good time

Woodstock '69 WAS designed to be great, its just that
it turned out to be great in a different way than it was planned.

Woodstock '69 and '94 are quite similar in the way the completely
trashed the environment just to have a good time.  BUT i bet
the clean up from 94 will be a hell of a lot better than 69.

Woodstock '69 was a bunch of kids ripping off a promoter,
land owner and a bunch of artists while trashing the environment
all in the name of peace and love.  (IMNSHO :) 

To me, a mini-woodstock would be a few thousand people rushing a concert/party
and getting in for free so that the promoter couldnt afford
to pay anyone but the artists still performed and people had a great time.

Although i think some of the FMR's were getting kinda close to that
about the environment and all, the FMR's were intended to be free.
(Speaking of which, i really hope the Sunset crew is taking
care of the Marina or other places they use.)

Im sorry, but i just dont think of Woodstock as something to live up to..
actually i dont think we shoudl be trying to duplicate anything in the past
its just way too much of Gen X type thing to do :)

The idea of throwing a party on the beach where a few hundred or thousand
people get together and dance and have fun and whatever isnt really a new
idea, im sure the people who came down the bearing strait 
beat us to that idea a hell of a long time ago,
but i dont see the need to compare to those parties anymore
than i do to see a comparison to woodstock

they had fun
we're having fun, i hope :)

Recently seen in _Urb Massv_:

"And now, a quick story.  If i was going to call this something, i'd call 
it 'the overachiever,' but i won't. 

"A few Saturdays ago, a friend came and picked me up about 3 in the morning.
I knew he was coming, so i had some cocktails waiting.  I'll call him 'Alex'.
We had some drinks, then decided to hit a few clubs and check out an
outlaw called Launc Pad, put on, incidentally, by the S.F.Net [sic],
some computer deal i know nothing about [sic :)].  So we swing by Funky
Buddha up on Broadway, then Release, then down Third St. to the bay for
Launch Pad.  As we're walking down the path to get to the party, we can start
to hear the music and make out people dancing and milling about.  We get a
little closer and i see that 1) the DJ is an old, old friend of mine, and
2) there's a large contraption standing next to him.  I'll call the DJ
'Buck'.  So we come up to Buck and I realize that he's lugged a Reel To Reel
Tape Player all the way down a dirt path and set it up in this cold field at 
5 in the morning and is mixing (not easy do to off a reel, especially with
frozen hands) to about 15 kids as the sun comes up over San Francisco Bay!
What kind of devotion is that?!  I couldn't believe it.  So we had a good
laugh, dug the party, and then headed home for a breakfast of bong hits
and Heineken before sending Buck and his Reel off to play at Light-n-Up.
Now that's dedication!  The End.

"OK. Maybe you had to be there, but that shit was /funny/!"

Thanks to everybody for coming and making F&F III a very fun but very safe
place at the same time.

I was lots of fun for me to spin in the morning, thanks to all the people
who stayed and danced.

A very special thank to Bryce and Ethan for their endless positive energy.

	Love

Incidentally, if you happen to find yourself in London in the near future 
with a fixin' for some new vinyl, you should visit Choci himself at his 
store (also called Choci's Chewns). Choci will ask you for a couple songs 
you like, estimate your style, and then procede to start slam-mixing 
large amounts of vinyl in that you'll find to your liking, while dancing 
about, whooping, and jumping off the walls. Energetic hardly is 
a discriptive enough word. Loony is almost a better discription, but only 
a sane man would stock such music. Lots of hard trance, acid, and gabber.
The stores a bit hard to find, it's essntially a basement in an alley off 
of soho. (the address: The Basement, 9-12 St Annes Ct. (Off Wardour ST.) 
London, W1V 3AX.) Highly recommended, and has the least attitude of any 
of the DJ shops in London.

Thanks, Lee. :)

I just really was upset by the whole thing where people thought it was
this great celebration of diversity. I probably overlooked the fact that
for some people, it really was, in comparison to their normally
insulated lives. I think I just took for granted what I'm used to and
applied that to other people.

Let me second this VERY VERY STRONGLY - I had the opportunity to hear
Josh Wink in New York last month and it was one of the most incredible
times I've ever had on the dancefloor - first time I've ever almost not been
able to contain myself with screaming because the music felt so damn good.
It induced all sorts of ritualistic tribal dances....oh baby....do not
miss this....


And wait until you all meet Mikebee! He (and handi and doug) will be
wonderful additions to SFRaves!

Since it's praising Choci time, I may as well add my favorites.... Look
out for "Acid crumble" parts 1 and 2, and the latest release--Sound
Foundation's "Worship--the twisted mix." The first two may be hard to find
as they've been out for a while now, but they're worth it if you can get
your hands on them.

He's spinning at Futur, this Saturday at the Richmond Civic Center.
Joeski (a DJ from NY) will also be spinning, along with Jeno and DJ Dan.
They had planned to book Joey Beltram for this party, but it didn't work
out.

I played 'Electronics for Dogs' both in my Ameba set and my warmup for
F&F&F and definitely second Bryce's recommendation on the Richard Brown
EP (if you can find it) -- four quite different and very interesting
tracks.

Samalll parties seem to be in this summer as ocmpared to last summer when 
they seemed to be a bitg hardert o find.  I liked friends and family 3, 
but laura la gasssa was nowhere to be found!  well, i dont' know what she 
looks like, so that was no help.  also, i was lookfing for "Susan R. 
Kameny", who was also nowhere to be found.  So after long seconds of deep 
depression, i danced my fingers off on what I call the mezzanine level, 
but what most people call the "sweatbox"   did maui say it was like 95 
degrees in there?  i believe tath was true.  

boing, im  on bart...........emb.......oakland.......berkeley
took the 51A instead of the M...............walked the rest of the way

Sunset was definitely alive this weekend.  There I meccad with the wind, 
the grass, the dirt, and the trees.  i reverted back to my primal being 
and for one minute in my life, forgot about the 99 cent whopper, which if 
you eat enough of them, can cost you 99 dollars at Jenny Craig.  So the 
moral of this story is if Sunset can make me forget about consumer 
products all the way until the sun goes down, something must be good.  I 
looked up that hill and saw a nationof ravers.  i heard some local kids 
as they were l3evingsay "yo man, i come here every sunday>"  

maybe we could set up one of these little sunset parties on the white 
house lawn.

I mentioned this awhile back, but i'm doing it again now that i know more 
about it....   

            Ambient Radio Shows on KWOD 106.5 FM (Sacramento)
           ---------------------------------------------------

Sunday Night -    10p - 12   :  Ambience; a purly ambient radio show, 
playing everything from Less House Hippy, to KMFDM, to Seefeel, to the 
Orb, a good show for listening to selected tracks, and new stuff...

I'm getting triplicate copies of everything in the SFRaves mailing list,
so when the hyperreal machine was taken off line,   something happened,
that one should look at and try and fix.

The only thing I could see causing that is the fact that when I take 
hyperreal down and back up, it restarts the sendmail queues it was 
working on, which can result in a few people (evidently hitting netcom 
users) getting messages delivered both times.  It's now up at its new 
place and happy and stable, so that shouldn't happen much anymore.  
Nothing "happened" when I moved it.  If I notice anything else unusual (I 
haven't) I'll fix it and let you all know.  Thanks for your patience.

Brain,  I think you have more work to do,  as I'm even getting THIS message
in triplicate.    As I logged off,  then back on again,  and as I was plowing
through 3 times more mail,  I get 3 more,  then 6 more,  etc,  all divisible
by 3.

Russian River rave report
-------------------------

  Sorry for being late with the report,  but due to power outage and the
heat wave,    I couldn't get on the computer any sooner.  And especially
sorry I missed F&F III.

  On the way up to Healdsburg,  I met Radion who invited us to a Thai Chi
party out near the Russian river.    WOW!! I was really getting INTO this
Thai Chi stuff BIG TIME,  really enjoyed it,  dispite the fearce heat.

  After that,  we took a great swim in the river before heading to the
Groove Kitchen site.     We arrive just after dark,   and the music was
a mellow Acid Jazz,   as we started to get in the mood for serious dancing.

  After about 10 pm,  the music picked up,   although not at full volume,
was just barely adequate for dancing,   but they kept it up all night.

  The place was really beautiful,   very warm evening,  up in the high
80's.    About 250 people showed up,  and it had a flavor like the rainbow
gathering with lots of small encamplemts.    We set up camp,   and I made
a great Chill out area to go to when I wanted to stretch out after dancing.

   All throughout the evening,  the sound was nudged up until the camp
owners complained,   then it had to get turned down.   Once they left,
the sound went back up again,   with more and more people dancing.

   About 6 am,  Marky Mark took over the turntables,  and the volume started
to get turned way up,   as the energy level increased,  and people woke up,
in the morning,  things were really hopping.

   Down by the river,  there was this eary fog that clung along the banks,
making the scene almost prehistoric with the moss hanging from the trees,
I almost expected to see a T' rex stomping around out there.

   As the morning progressed,  the energy and joy levels were of the likes
I haven't seen in a long time.    Radion was dancing like there was no
tommorrow,  with the biggest smile I have ever seen, and it just spread
around the group until I was laughing so hard I could hardly dance.
By that time,   about 50 - 70 people were kicking up a storm BIG TIME
as Marky spun the most incredable trance set I've heard in a very long 
time.    There were a lot of bystanders looking on shaking their heads
as we went apeshit hopping around the dance area.   When Jeno went on,
everyone went berserk.

   Even in the morning, just as the sun was coming up,   the temperature
was still a balmy 70 degrees,   very calm,  no wind and the eary fog 
clinging around the river banks.

   About 10 am or so,   we were told to turn the music down again,   then
we had free hot cakes and food and took a break from dancing.

   While kicking back in the warm weather,   the sound crew moved the speakers
to overlook the cliffs and face the river,   as people were starting to swim.

   As the music started up again,   I warmed up dancing,  in anticipation of
jumping in the river.    WOW!!   Dancing and swimming are such a GREAT 
combination,  especially as I was dancing in the water,  swerling around to
the music.   WOW!!...  I finally figured out some new swimming motions and
movements that put me in a super trancey state,  as I was taking advantage
of the ever present currents moving me down river,  then going back up stream
again,  swimming to the music.    Acid Jazz is perfect for dancing, while
in the water....  as I made slow direction changes and flips underwater to
the music.     I could even hear the music while underwater....  What a trip!!
I'll never forget the experience.    

   Later in the afternoon,   after the music changed to slower acid jazz, more
and more people were in the river,  covering themselves totally in mud.    Aaron,
my friend looked like the "Swamp thing" as he sported a pineapple leaves on his
head,  covered completly in mud.    Lots of people were totally covered in mud
which served to protect them from the fearce sun.    By the afternoon,  the
temperature was about 105 degrees,   most everyone was dancing in the river by
that time.

   About 5 pm,  the camp owners forced us to shut down the music,   but out 
popped the boom boxes,  so the music never really stopped.    

   I met some people from India (Goa) who had some killer tapes from the
legendary Goa raves.    We had a killer dinner that evening,   and hung around
and enjoyed the very warm evening before heading back Sunday evening.

   For those at Freinds and Family III,   I'm sorry to have missed hearing
Sean spin,   but I know I'll get more of a chance at a later time.    But,
I much prefer outdoor events where I can escape the constant cigerette
smoke totally.    This is the first time where I haven't felt the sickening
dizzyness on a Monday,  like I do,  after I've been cooped up in a stuffy 
and hot room,  doing aeroboc dancing,  sucking in the poisons.     So,  for
those wondering where I was this weekend,    you all know.    Again!!  I
couldn't be in two places at once,   but perhaps I can make F&F IV.

Peace

YO,

check this out.  jack-baby was joking w/ y'all on the ken trip,
cuz i thought the whole episode was amusing, understand?  good!

i wasn't on the list when the conversation started, but suspected what
ken revealed below, that cop paranoia was in effect and i was goofing on it.
i hope that doesn't offend anyone, but gee-fucking-whiz folks, it SURELY
ain't a big deal.  as for philosohpy on conformity and interaction with
police, you *must* talk with me in person as i don't want to type that
much, and LIKE I SAID BEFORE I WAS *PULLING* *YOUR* *LEG*.  i hope that's
clear...pardon me for being so cranky, i got a tad frustrated seeing
an insignificant 1-liner "blossom" into a hatfield 'n' mccoy feud...


~"it's all about the liks cuz were heavy on the kicks
 but we're easy on the treble...[adjust my mic level]
 i'm droppin shit slik tossin' bottles like a discus
 the liks can rock a party from halloween to christmas
 that's why i' screamin' on mc's like i'm onyx
 i'm hooked on gin & tonics like yo mama's hooked on phonics..." (k. tee?)

I can't find the problem on my end.  I looked very carefully through the 
mail logs and three copies of each mail are definitely NOT being sent 
from here to your account.  

If you are having this problem, and you are NOT on netcom, please let me 
know.

----------------------

it kinda looks to me like "those people" (i.e. those who went) *INSISTED*
on having a good time, which I can appreaciate and maybe even pay respect
for.  after all, it appears that they had a good time against rediculous
odds!   good for them, i wouldn't *EVEN* have attempted it.

i also agree that the FMR is alot closer to what i associate w/
the original though, and i wonder how many woodschlockers have been
lucky enough to have the kind of hyper-fun i've become accustomed
to over the last 20 years...*everyone* deserves it, but you have to
realize it's there, and then do what the woodschlockers did...

	INSIST ON IT!!!

wow, thanks for all the suggestions! since there has been so
much info on hand, maybe some folks can answer another question
along the lines of great but discontinued musical instruments (like
the 303).  I've heard that someone has set up mini-moog's with
MIDI (it was a pre MIDI synth) and that you can buy these things
somewhere.  anyone know where?

I know there have been many posts about F&FIII, but I had to add my 2cents. 

...Thanks to all involved for the *great* time. It was my second F&F and I
didn't think anything could top the last! The music was phenomenally
relentless:) You guys thrashed me! (but the most delightful thrashing i have
ever received:))

I was finally able to meet more SFRavers (anthrax, maui, ...) but,
regretfully, missed saying hello to others (especially sean after such a
great set and laura (& georgina), who i danced next to for quite a while but
didn't know until the post about the giraffe).

Believe it or not this all leads up to the main topic of my post...

I will be work/playing on Maui sept. and oct. and, although there is plenty
to do, I will miss the F&F, SPAZ, YSH, Sunset, ...  events. Does anyone out
there know what's up in the islands? 

peace,

I got a taste of some "jungle" and I like it. An Irish dj who just 
arrived spins here in the evenings.

I went to LA this week and sat on the beach with VAX of House Pets
and missed F&F III.

Working on reviews of tapes and if anyone wants to review their fave dj tape
send it to me. any tape except the ameba 1 only live 8-track. The first 
was Ethan July 1994 @ameba and was sold yesterday to an sfraver who 
couldn't resist. 

An ex-girlfriend was visited while in LA and she asked me to stop talking
about raves.

My girlfriend michelle goes to more raves than me. She is cool.

Woodstock is the sanctified "drug" event and it is so revealing about so 
much,
....I wont even bother.        salutations, allen@ameba

Greetings, Ravers!

I know it's very soon, and the sweat from F&F^3 has barely been cleaned off,
but it's surprisingly soon to our next date at Komotion: Saturday, September
24th.  I'd like to ask you all a few questions, so you can help set me in
the right direction to help organize the next one.  Thanks in advance for
your time!

1).  Do you want another one? Is September 24 a good date?
2).  What theme would you like?  I've had a vision of doing an ambient oriented
     thing in the big room, but i will be happy to provide what the consensus
     desires.  I can provide an ambient fix in other ways :)
3).  What needs to be improved for the next one?  What wasn't there that you
     would like to experience? What was there that you want to stay for the
     next one?
4).  How can you assist us?
5).  How can we assist you?

Again, many thanks!

setting up sound system(s) somewhere in the area,so fellow mobile dance 
fanatics are also welcome.the meeting may also be attended on IRC

Yes,  that is a week AFTER the planned date for MY party,  which hasn't
materialized yet,  by the way.

Well,  according to the reports I've gotten from the last two F&F gatherings,
about the heat and humidity,   what would it take to make the place cooler?
Or is it set that way deliberately?

>4).  How can you assist us?

Well,  if I can get the SonnaVista,  and a projection video system,  I would 
be honored to be a CyberJox and provide the "Eye candy".

I'll come if I can.  I'll come *spin* if I can.  However, I must say
that with a major campaign in progress I'm iffy for anything that
far in advance.

 Should be fine!

 Jim and I would love to play for a more ambient oriented event. Our music
 while it will have beats is not currently hardcore dance beat oriented - 
 more like something approaching the softer side of the Orb.
 Of course, I could understand if everyone wants only the "get down-go up
 party" from the onset. Another position might be to begin the evening
 ambient building up to an all out groove in the middle say 2:30-3:00 and
 then to go out that way or to bring things back to Earth in the morning
 say about 5:30. Of course, this would take a bit of coordinating between
 the music contributors but I'm sure that's possible too.

 I'll pass - I'm not sure you can improve near perfection. The ventilation
 would really take an attic fan - and that would require roof alterations
 with $$, permits etc.

> 4).  How can you assist us?

 Can supply live music as Star Zeit - we assume our music is as good as our
 visuals. Can supply visuals. Can supply BOTH - obviously. Am discussing
 with Komotion on producing some visual segments with thier logos and themes
 "bouncing through" - perhaps to be used on the 24th?
 I have a video projector and screen with VCR. Also, have a small PA
 consisting of 2- 15" Cabs, 2- 12" Satellites with stands to raise them and
 a 250 watt per side amp.

> 5).  How can we assist you?

 Let me know what assistance is needed and whether I should begin working
 up some visuals, music or both.

Hi:
As a nubee to the list I'd like some prognostications on the upcoming 
FUTUR in Richmond next Sat nite. Seems like the last time I saw something this 
big was the "World Groove" at the COW PALACE. That, a mon avis, wasn't the 
greatest... But I'd like some info from people more in the know than this
neophyte!

Also... when is the Full Moon? ... I thought it was Fri Nite..
but ken's post says something about going to the Full Moon AFTER the 
Richmond rave...

dazed and confused... (as usual)

Hello,

I was logged on to CDC (Compact Disc Connection) and they have listed:

Steve Hillage - Rainbow Dome Music    $13.13

so it seems to be still available.

Also, I picked up recently Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Vol. II,
and I have toient Works Vol. II,
and I have to concur that it is brilliant, magical music.

Futur should be good, and maybe only the let freedom rave will 
compare(even though I missed it) in terms of big good rave of the summer.
Funky techno delivers and the NASA people did good last time they were here,
See the Light tour.

We only get that flavor on a big scale once a year, techno progressive, 
Meanwhile massive parties are happening around the u.S. this weekend, 
Narnia in SanDiego and some thing in St Louis. Hardkisses booked at both 
those..... HOWEVER Didn't I see SPAZ booked at FUTUR? Aaron? will It be Cool?

So DJs come in and record an 8-track, for your mom on mothersday.

salutations, allen@ameba

IMHO

>1).  Do you want another one? Is September 24 a good date?

Absolutely! As far as the date is concerned I'm sure everyone will have
their own opinion for a favorite day or week but you ultimately have to
make the decision. (For instance I would prefer a different weekend because
on a holiday weekend too many friends come in town or too many people go
out of town.  The next weekend is no good either 'cause I'll be in SD....it
is just impossible to accomodate everyone.)

>2).  What theme would you like?  I've had a vision of doing an ambient oriented
>     thing in the big room, but i will be happy to provide what the consensus
>     desires.  I can provide an ambient fix in other ways :)

I think an ambient ORIENTED thing would be a GREAT idea.  First I think it
would be almost impossible to recreate F&F^3 in it's feel and energy except
to duplicate it exactly using the same formula.  By having something
completely different you will cultivate a different energy bringing out
various moods in people's personality.  Having been to both "Ambience"
performances at King Street (not trying to compare or influence), I felt
that both parties were very condusive to meeting and talking more with new
aquaintences. I feel that it would be better to have a variety of ambient
music including some with beat because it breaks the heavyness/seriousness
that ambience can create.  Pete Namlook did it very well in his live
performance by bringing in a drum loop that people started to sway to.
Same with Young American Primitive who did a very upbeat ambient set at the
second "Ambience" Party.

>3).  What needs to be improved for the next one?  What wasn't there that you
>     would like to experience? What was there that you want to stay for the
>     next one?

Again, I thought the visuals were incredible at F&F^3 a deffinite keep.  As
far as the heat goes, I personally don't mind it for dancing, but for an
ambient party it may be difficult to sit through.


It could be interresting to see or read how this will develop.  I do not
have any specific talent in how to help (I'm just a succer for great music)
but all the same I would enjoy helping if I fit anywhere.

Okay (although this information gets posted often to alt.rave...).

Compact Disc Connection is a company that has modem phone numbers all over 
the US, although they are right here in the Bay Area.

You can logon to their system at (408)985-8982 (8N1, 9600 baud max.).

Or you can telnet to cdconnection.com (199.35.15.2).

They have an on-line catalog listing 90,000 CDs, including most domestic 
CDs and some imports.  They stock NOTHING, but order from their suppliers 
several times a week.  Hence they have no warehouse or inventory costs.

I've used them several times, with no problems.  They managed to fill 
every request, except for one CD was out of stock at all their suppliers - 
pretty good overall.  If you order $100 or more, shipping is free.  If 
they can't fill a request, then the shipping charge is only that 
percentage of what they fill (ie if they fill 3 out of 4, then they only 
charge you 75% of the usual shipping charge).  Naturally, they use credit 
card for payment.

What they DON'T carry, you can usually get from EAR/Rational Music, which 
is at   angst@xmission.com   , who specializes in techno & alternative 
stuff, including imports (mostly CDs, btw).

RADIO! RADIO! Status Report 2

 DJ schedule - This is the DJ sequence so far:

 Bryce :    Setup to 2PM
 Laura :    2PM to 3PM
 Harrywho : 3PM to 4PM
 JSL :      4PM to 5PM
 Talizman : 5PM to 6PM
 Deaks :    6PM to 7PM
 ???? :     7PM to end ... ( Open slot , but read below ) 

 Speaking of the end ... if folks are going to other things Saturday
night , then maybe 7PM is a more realistic ending than 8PM , if not
sooner. Depends on how many folks are left by then. 8PM is the absolute
end time , to give time for cleanup and breaking down the sound system. 

 
 Getting to Sunnyvale Baylands Park from Santa Cruz: I guess I forgot 
the folks coming from the coast! Take HW 17/880 from Santa Cruz ,
through the mountains and hills to Los Gatos and San Jose. Take HW 280
north towards San Francisco , and take the Lawrence Expressway exit
and head north/east towards the bay on Lawrence. After driving  about 
five miles , you'll reach the HW237 overpass. Once over HW 237 , the 
park entrance is at the right. After the toll booth, take
the right hand driveway to the end , to the picnic site called Owl
Burrow.

 Who's Who ??? - My wife Mary and I have designed some RADIO! RADIO! 
name tags for those who show up - match faces to names! They'll be
luggage-style tags , 2.5" by 3.5" .
 We'll need some markers so folks can sign and decorate their name
tags - any volunteers? If ya' got day-glo , even better! 

 Food & drink - Only two replies so far on my question about potluck 
vs bring-yer-own ... more info please!

 Table - I think I can convert my Black & Decker workbench into a table
for the mixer and turntables. I just gotta get busy with some wood
and nails ... Of course , if someone has a handy table with at least
19" by 60" dimensions , it would save me some sawing ...

 Canopy - I am going to call the park tomorrow and ask them if they
will allow me to tie ropes to their picnic roof beams. If so , a 
windbreak/sunshade canopy can be simple done with some rope and a
big tarp.


	That's it for now -

             yes allen, it should be fairly Cool as the organizers have 
seen fit to book a few interesting musical entities including Air Liquide
not to mention Funky Tekno regular Graham La Paix , who as you may know spins
Kerrazzzy Trance Acid Musik.i did hear somewhere that Joey Beltram wasn't 
gonna make it---i'll research that particular fact and report back.
when is mothers day?perhaps we should organize a mothers' day party and 
everyone can bring their mom.we can ask Mother Earth S.S. to come and 
play.......

Subject: UK Criminal Justice Bill: Repression of Raves
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


The Criminal Justice Bill now before Parliament in the United Kingdom
is partly a political response to the social backlash against the spreading
of 'rave culture'.  In its typically heavy-handed way, as so often
during the dead-hand rule of the Tories, it tries to deal with societal
change through repression.  The provisions banning outdoor unlicensed
raves would be instantly tossed out as unconstitutional in the United
States due to the specificity of language about the definition of the
prohibited music and special treatment under the law for a particular
class of people (those attending outdoor raves).

But the provisions concerning the seizure of property, including audio
equipment and vehicles, are well within the bounds of current American
law, as evidenced by computer seizures in the various high-profile
"hacker" shutdown operations and the more widespread seizure of property
under the revised drug laws *prior to conviction or even indictment*,
and regardless of whether legal proceedings continue following the
seizures.

So I think we in the States have to pay attention to the course of the
Criminal Justice Bill, not only for any outdoor parties we may be
attending or involved with, but because this represents potential future
pressure on our rights under the continually eroding and nearly forgotten
Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution.

I grabbed this text off the uk-dance mailing list.  A second large rally
(following the one last month) is scheduled this Sunday in London,
running from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square.  The turnout will no doubt
be more impressive even than the last one.

I'll try to fill in on developments as they occur, but I'd appreciate
info and thoughts from any of our UK friends here.

Sections 53-56 of the Criminal Justice Bill

Powers in relation to raves

53.--(1) This section applies to a gathering on land in the open air of
         100 or more persons (whether or not trespassers) at which amplified
         music is played during the night (with or without intermissions)
         and is such as, by reason of its loudness and duration and the time
         at which it is played, is likely to cause serious distress to the
         inhabitants of the locality; and for this purpose--

         (a) such a gathering continues during intermissions in the music
             and, where the gathering extends over several days, throughout
             the period during which amplified music is played at night (with
             or without intermissions); and

         (b) "music" includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised
             by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.

     (2) If a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent reasonably
         believes that ten or more persons are present on land in the open
         air--

         (a) making preparations for the holding there of a gathering to
             which this section applies,
         (b) waiting for such a gathering to begin there, or
         (c) attending such a gathering which is in progress,

         he may give a direction that those persons and any other persons who
         come to attend the gathering are to leave the land and remove any
         vehicles or other property which they have with them on the land.

     (3) A direction under subsection (2) above, if not communicated to the
         persons referred to in subsection (2) by the police officer giving the
         direction, may be communicated to them by any constable at the scene.

     (4) Persons shall be treated as having had a direction under subsection
         (2) above communicated to them if reasonable steps have been taken to
         bring it to their attention.

     (5) A direction under subsection (2) above does not apply to an exempt
         person.

     (6) If a person knowing that a direction has been given which applies
         to him--

         (a) fails to leave the land as soon as reasonably practicable, or

         (b) having left again enters the land within the period of 7 days
             beginning with the day on which the direction was given,

         he commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to
         imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or a fine not
         exceeding level 4 on the standard scale, or both.

     (7) In proceedings for an offence under this section it is a defence for
         the accused to show that he had a reasonable excuse for failing to
         leave the land as soon as reasonably practicable or, as the case may
         be, for again entering the land.

     (8) A constable in uniform who reasonably suspects that a person is
         committing an offence under this section may arrest him without a
         warrant.

     (9) This section does not apply to a gathering licensed by an
         entertainment licence.

    (10) In this section--

         "entertainment licence" means a licence granted by a local authority
         under--

         (a) Schedule 12 to the London Government Act 1963;

         (b) section 3 of the Private Places of Entertainment (Licensing)
             1967 c. 19. Act 1967; or

         (c) Schedule 1 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions)
             Act 1982;

         "exempt persons", in relation to land (or any gathering on land),
         means the occupier, any member of his family and any employee
         or agent of his and any person whose home is situated on the
         land;

         "land in the open air" includes a place partly open to the air;

         "local authority" means--

         (a) in Greater London, a London borough council or the
             Common Council of the City of London;

         (b) outside Greater London, a district council or the council of
             the Isles of Scilly; and

         "occupier" and "vehicle" have the same meaning as in section 51.


54.--(1) If a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent
         reasonably believes that circumstances exist in relation to any
         land which would justify the giving of a direction under section 53
         in relation to a gathering to which that section applies he may
         authorise any constable to enter the land for any of the purposes
         specified in subsection (2) below.

      (2) Those purposes are--

          (a) to ascertain whether such circumstances exist; and

          (b) to exercise any power conferred on a constable by section 53 or
              subsection (4) below.

      (3) A constable who is so authorised to enter land for any purpose may
          enter the land without a warrant.

      (4) If a direction has been given under section 53 and a constable
          reasonably suspects that any person to whom the direction applies has
          failed without reasonable excuse to remove any vehicle or sound
          equipment on the land which appears to the constable to belong to him
          or to be in his possession or under his control, the constable may
          seize and retain that vehicle or sound equipment.

      (5) Subsection (4) above does not authorise the seizure of any vehicle
          or sound equipment of an exempt person.

      (6) In this section--

          "exempt person" has the same meaning as in section 53;

          "sound equipment" means equipment designed or adapted for
          amplifying music and any equipment suitable for use in
          connection with such equipment, and "music" has the same
          meaning as in section 53; and

          "vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 51.


55.--(1) If a constable in uniform reasonably believes that a person is
         on his way to a gathering to which section 53 applies in relation
         to which a direction under section 53(2) is in force, he may,
         subject to subsections (2) and (3) below--

         (a) stop that person, and

         (b) direct him not to proceed in the direction of the gathering.

     (2) The power conferred by this section may only be exercised at a
         place within 5 miles of the boundary of the site of the gathering.

     (3) No direction may be given under this section to an exempt person.

     (4) In this section, "exempt person" has the same meaning as in section
         53.


56.--(1) Where a person is convicted of an offence under section 53 in
         relation to a gathering to which that section applies and the court
         is satisfied that any sound equipment which has been seized from him
         under section 54(4) or which was in his possession or under his
         control at the relevant time has been used at the gathering the
         court may make an order for forfeiture under this subsection in
         respect of that property.

     (2) The court may make an order under subsection (1) above whether
         or not it also deals with the offender in respect of the offence in
         any other way and without regard to any restrictions on forfeiture
         in any enactment.

     (3) In considering whether to make an order under subsection (1)
         above in respect of any property a court shall have regard--

         (a) to the value of the property; and
         (b) to the likely financial and other effects on the offender of the
             making of the order (taken together with any other order that
             the court contemplates making).

     (4) An order under subsection (1) above shall operate to deprive the
         offender of his rights, if any, in the property to which it relates,
         and the property shall (if not already in their possession) be taken
         into the possession of the police.

     (5) Where any property has been forfeited under subsection (1) above,
         a magistrates' court may, on application by a claimant of the
         property, other than the offender from whom it was forfeited under
         subsection (1) above, make an order for delivery of the property
         to the applicant if it appears to the court that he is the owner
         of the property.

     (6) No application shall be made under subsection (S) above by any
         claimant of the property after the expiration of 6 months from the
         date on which an order under subsection (1) above was made in
         respect of the property.

     (7) No such application shall succeed unless the claimant satisfies the
         court either that he had not consented to the offender having
         possession of the property or that he did not know, and had no
         reason to suspect, that the property was likely to be used at a
         gathering to which section 53 applies.

     (8) An order under subsection (5) above shall not affect the right of any
         person to take, within the period of 6 months from the date of an
         order under subsection (5) above, proceedings for the recovery of the
         property from the person in possession of it in pursuance of the
         order, but on the expiration of that period the right shall cease.

     (9) The Secretary of State may make regulations for the disposal of
         property, and for the application of the proceeds of sale of property,
         forfeited under subsection (1) above where no application by a
         claimant of the property under subsection (5) above has been made
         within the period specified in subsection (6) above or no such
         application has succeeded.

    (10) The regulations may also provide for the investment of money and
         for the audit of accounts.

    (11) The power to make regulations under subsection (9) above shall be
         exercisable by statutory instrument which shall be subject to
         annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.

    (12) In this section--

         "relevant time", in relation to a person convicted of an offence under
         section 53, means the time of his arrest for the offence or of the
         issue of a summons in respect of it;

         "sound equipment" has the same meaning as in section 54.


   Retention and charges for seized property

57.--(1) Any vehicles which have been seized and removed by a
         constable under section 52(1) or 54(4) may be retained in accordance
         with regulations made by the Secretary of State under subsection (3)
         below.

     (2) Any sound equipment which has been seized and removed by a
         constable under section 54(4) may be retained until the conclusion of
         proceedings against the person from whom it was seized for an offence
         under section 53.

     (3) The Secretary of State may make regulations--

         (a) regulating the retention and safe keeping and the disposal and
             the destruction in prescribed circumstances of vehicles; and

         (b) prescribing charges in respect of the removal, retention, disposal
             and destruction of vehicles.

      (4) Any authority shall be entitled to recover from a person from
          whom a vehicle has been seized such charges as may be prescribed in
          respect of the removal, retention, disposal and destruction of the
          vehicle by the authority.

      (5) Regulations under subsection (3) above may make different
          provisions for different classes of vehicles.

      (6) Any charges under subsection (4) above shall be recoverable as a
          simple contract debt.

      (7) Any authority having custody of vehicles under regulations under
          subsection (3) above shall be entitled to retain custody until any
          charges under subsection (43 are paid.

      (8) The power to make regulations under subsection (3) above shall be
          exercisable by statutory instrument which shall be subject to
          annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.

      (9) In this section--

          "conclusion of proceedings" against a person means--

            (a) his being sentenced or otherwise dealt with for the
                offence or his acquittal;

            (b) the discontinuance of the proceedings; or

            (c) the decision not to prosecute him,

           whichever is the earlier;

           "sound equipment" has the same meaning as in section S4; and

           "vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 51.

Just got back from Buzz at San Jose Oasis and it was definitely alive.  
Plenty of house and lots of free waterrrr. The one really cool thing 
about this is the "modern" room which has no ceiling and if you squint 
real hard you can see stars past the room and city lights.  It's a great 
place to cool off after doing the house-shuffle in the main room.  Though 
the music in this "modern" room leaves a bit to be desired there is 
definitely good energy there besides all the usual club gawkers and 
scammers : Tonight I saw a guy roller-dancing around a beer bottle, it 
was insane!
There is also this group of fellows, who frequent the club, and they do this 
type of dance which I can only describe as 
slow-motion-tae-kwon-do-breakdancing, it's really fun to watch.  There 
must be a name for this technique?
Next wednesday it's Julius Papp, Doran, and Tony, so my flyer says.

On Monday I've been going to Free Life, which is at Gregg's Bar in San 
Jose on Julian and Montgomery.  It truly is Free and it's hosted by Harry 
Who and Rick Preston.  The dance floor is small but it seems to be just 
right for the amount of people as the crowd can sometimes fill the whole 
place.  Plenty of blacklights here and so far lots of sweatin' to the beats.

Oh yeah.  Friends and Family really hit the spot! I think wearing cotton 
clothes was my mistake as I could almost wring the sweat out of it and it 
never seemed to dry... gotta get some polyester, man.  Maybe one thing 
that may or may not help for the next one is somehow get ALL of the fans 
off the floor and above the crowd so the wind doesn't just die after 
hitting a few happy people's legs.  Face level wind was very pleasant 
when I could work my way to that tall fan in front, and I never felt as 
if I was hogging the breeze.  SOmehow the vibe was so intense for me I 
gave it too much and tweaked my back again.  (the first time was of 
course also from an SFR event)  I had to leave early because I pretty much 
could no longer move without crying.  It heals quickly, but when it goes, 
it really goes.

I can bring food to RADIO! RADIO! and I have a 30" x 42" drafting table 
if that's usable.

Studio Electronics in Encino (818-776-8104) does midi retrofits for
Minimoogs. Expect to pay an appendage or two though, 'cause they don't
come cheap. A friend of mine was quoted $1400 several months ago for a
Midimini. I think if you supply your own Mini, you might save $200-300. =)

Good luck,
Lee

Could someone please mail me the directions to Radio Radio?  They seem
to have gotten erased from my mail files some sort of finger slipping
thing I assume.  I am comming from Oakland since I know there are more
than one set of directions.

thanks!!

I also had a great time at Buzz in San Jose last night.  It took
a little while for iut to pit to pick up, as the whole bar crowd stand
around and play pool people outnumbered the music music people,
but the visuals were great and when they finally turned on the intellibeams
I was able to lose myself in the trance.  Free entrance, free water..
perfect beat and the occasional great acid.  To those in the
Santa Cruz/San Jose area... I redccommend it.  If anybodsy y from Santa

that is if I can still bnreathreathe after this intense weekend coming
up.
I really regret missing Friends & Family... 
i was even right there in San Francisco but I was with loser
friends who made me drive them back to Santa Cruz so we could
watch mvideos and go to bed early.  Curses.  I'll get them to a rave
someday, although it'll probably be with the head of a shotgun or

Sounds like war to me. I'd organize an "arrest-out" if you could. Get
as many thousands of people as possible to present passive resistance
to the police. Put lots of lugs on the sound gear and have lots of
people chain themselves to it and to each other. Make a nice media
circus out of it. Distribute petitions. Etc.

with regard to swooshs post:



dontcha hate it when people just stand there and look!...
sorta afraid to dance as if it wasn't cool... 
During the FF3 last week we went over to INERTIA  which was in the
mission and even tho CHRISTOPHE was playing some great stuff... 
there were about 15 people on the floor and about 100 just looking...
so we left quickly and went back to FF3.

If we're going to slow this one down a bit (bpms, that is), i'd be happy 
to spin some slow, trippy acid jazz and dub. It might make a good segue 
between softer ambient stuff and full-out grooves. I was hoping to spin 
this sauturday at RadioRadio, but I doubt my work schedule will allow it.

RADIO! RADIO! - Directions to Sunnyvale Baylands Park

General notes: 

 There is a huge softball complex called Twin Creeks located right next to 
Sunnyvale Baylands Park. There should be enough signs to tell you which 
one you're at. The entrance of Sunnyvale Baylands Park is at the intersection 
of Moffet Park Drive and Caribbean Drive ; the main part of the park is at 
the southeast quadrant of the Caribbean Drive/Lawrence Expressway/
HW 237 intersection.

 Parking at Sunnyvale Baylands Park is $3.00 per vehicle. Cars are allowed
in the park until 8:30PM , the park itself closes at 9PM.

FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO PENINSULA :
First , get to HW 237 -

  HW 280 - South , past Palo Alto . Take the HW 85 exit , North to Mtn. View . 
Drive past El Camino and take the HW 237/HW101 South exit. You will then
be on HW 237 , East. 

 HW 101 - South , past Mountain View to Sunnyvale. Take the Alviso / 
Milpitas exit to HW 237 East. 

 Once on HW 237 East,  drive past Fair Oaks Ave. and take the Lawrence
Expressway/Caribbean Drive exit - choose the Caribbean Drive branch of
the exit. Stay in the right hand lane on Caribbean Drive - the park entrance 
is the first right turn as soon as you drive over HW 237.  After the toll
booth , take the right hand drive to the last picnic area , called Owl Burrow.

FROM THE EAST BAY:
>From HW 880 - Drive south on HW 880 towards San Jose and Milpitas. At
Milpitas, take the Alviso Rd./Calaveras Blvd. exit to HW 237 West . Drive
towards Mountain View and Sunnyvale . Use the Lawrence Expressway/
Caribbean Drive exit , taking the first Caribbean Drive branchoff. The
entrance to the park will be the first right turn after the on-ramp . After 
the toll booth , take the right hand drive to the last picnic area , called 
Owl Burrow.

FROM Santa Cruz:
Take HW 17/880 from Santa Cruz ,
through the mountains and hills to Los Gatos and San Jose. Take HW 280
north towards San Francisco , and take the Lawrence Expressway exit
and head north/east towards the bay on Lawrence. After driving  about 
five miles , you'll reach the HW237 overpass. Once over HW 237 , the 
park entrance is at the right. After the toll booth, take
the right hand driveway to the end , to the picnic site called Owl
Burrow.

LOCAL DIRECTIONS:
Assuming you know how to get to either Mathilda Ave. , Fair Oaks Ave. ,
Wolfe Road, or Lawrence Expressway , drive up any of them towards the 
bay.  Mathilda Ave. intersects HW 237 - take the HW 237 East exit , and
drive to the Caribbean Drive offramp. Wolf Road merges into Fair Oaks Ave ; 
take the HW 237 East exit , and use the  Caribbean Drive exit . Lawrence 
Expressway becomes Caribbean Drive at HW 237 - the entrance to the park 
will be on the right after HW 237.

Hope to see you there!

 Hi - Larry Ching here -

 My workplace has decided to start discouraging employees from accessing the
Internet for non-business reasons. This means I'll only be reading my mail
early in the morning , or after 6PM , from my home computer. Hopefully ,
this won't gum up my coordination of the SFR picnic (RADIO!RADIO!) too
much!

                                                           THE CD COMPILATION

As the FREE party Interstellar Outback in Lexington, KY (August 26-28)
approaches
I am glad to announce the availability of an important fund-raiser for the
event.

A limited edition of 1,000 Compact Discs have been pressed TO be sold with
all profits
going to pay those nasty bills that are accumulating to produce the
Interstellar Outback party.
The CDs (73 minutes) will be sold for a limited time on the net for $10 plus
$1 shipping and
for $8 at the party (so it would actually save you money to go and have a
great time!!!).
Hows that for advertising skill:)

The CD includes a 4 color insert of the flyer and a WIDE variety of music
from those artist
(both DJs and Bands) that will be attending the party.  All tracks were
recorded digitally
and they're Phat!  There is a great representation of the RAVE scene here
with everything from
HardCore, Jungle, Trance, House, Acid, and Ambient.  Do yourself a favor and
those who have
worked to hard to produce all aspects of Interstellar Outback the party and
donated their time,
money and music for the CD.  Check it out.

Thanks,
EllisD

At first my thanks for bringing us F&F^3. I really had a very good time.
I arrived almost at the end of Sean set but I really liked what I heard.
Hope to hear more next time. Great music also with Lee, Ethan and Galen
and all of you in the ambient room. Good to see some old friends and make
new ones. Sorry I cound't hear John and Giamma but I had a long week and I
was quite tired.

And now it's time to think abuout the next one:

> 1).  Do you want another one? Is September 24 a good date?

	Yeah!!!! (: only another one ? :) Yeah! (: soo late ? :)

> 2).  What theme would you like?  I've had a vision of doing an ambient oriented
>      thing in the big room, but i will be happy to provide what the consensus
>      desires.  I can provide an ambient fix in other ways :)

	I like the idea of an ambient big room and I agree with the others
	who proposed "more than 0 bpm" music so that it still possible to
	dance, eventually followed by some more fast trancey stuff.

> 3).  What needs to be improved for the next one?  What wasn't there that you
>      would like to experience? What was there that you want to stay for the
>      next one?

	I really liked the videos/visuals of F&FIII, so go for it.
	An ambient night could be the occasion to experiment the collective
	art, argument of last month posting. One thing could be make a new
	SFR banner or a F&F banner (I remember my first SFR party, at the 
	basement at 1015 folsom, with this big sheet hanging on a wall, under
	black lights and everybody stopping there and painting).
	Another thing, probably more complex to organize could be a "musical" 
	experiment. I'm thinking of it as people bringing their instruments
	(it can be a flute, a wistle or just a noisy toy) and making 
	"arrangement" around the music the DJ is spinning (it need to be
	amplified but probably by a second source in a "protect environment"
	(but I think the stage, on the back of the main speakers should be
	fine).

> 4).  How can you assist us?
> 5).  How can we assist you?
	I can bring an instrument mixer, my bass and some other musical toys.

... 37 days left to FFIV (but only one to Radio! Radio! :)

Ciao,

If you don't have the SFR button i'll bring some empty ones at Radio! Radio!
I got the old images from hyperreal and I'll try to update and print some
of them.
...Or send me a new image.
...Or bring your own.
...Or make your own Saturday.  I will bring some coloured paper too.

If you want to bring your own design, the button is 2 1/4 inches in diameter.
It is a plastic one and does not need the picture to be bigger than its size.

See you Saturday,

On hyperreal.com:/pub/incoming you can find a file sfr94.gif with two ideas
for the buttons. Let me know what do you think. The quality is very bad because 
the program I'm using (MS-Windows - bleah!!!) but they look very nice on paper.
I'm playing with the colors now, but I think one thing, I see another on
the screen and I obtain a third one on paper, so....
I'd better stop here for tonite.

Damn! I wish I'd known about it, I need to go visit my parents in

Just to remind or inform anyonme who is bored in Santa Cruz
and under 21 on a friday night...
There is that unnamed (as far as I know) party without
a phone number (also as far as I know) going on every
friday in a small warehouse space located at:
>From mission (hwy 1) go north on river st. (where it turns
into hwy 9) and take the third left, a street called E-somethin gg,
go down a block and turn right on post, follow that down to
the end and park.  If you don't hear anything or see people
walk down the street to your right and look for a parking
lot to the right of that street.  In there lies a door, where there
may be someone asking you for five bucks, and opr or there will be noone
there asking you for anything, in which case you just walk up
the stairs.  I didn't go last week so I can't describe
the innards in more detail, because I but I did stop by on my way
to the Monterey party and there were a lot of peopl;e theree there....
I just didn't want to pay the $5 and then leave for Monterey...
so...
happy day!

"RADIO! RADIO!"  -  Final Status Report on the SFRaves Picnic in 
 Sunnyvale Baylands Park

 Since most of you can only read your email at work , this will be the last
status report you get before the picnic ( unless I think of something
else ).  New items are at the beginning of this message , general points are 
repeated in the middle. I have some slightly improved directions to the park 
at the end .
    Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
New Items:

Closing DJ -  There may be a DJ for the 7PM to 8PM time slot - DJ Loren! No 
certain confirmation yet , but it looks good. I think he'll be the only non-
mailist DJ on Saturday. Many of you have heard him spin at MOTION and 
other events.

Food and Drink - Three people have volunteered to bring some extra food and
drink - thanks! I think most folks will be bringing their own food and drink - 
don't forget that we have a barbecue pit with a 20" x 70" grill. ( Actually ,
we have two pits , but since one is upwind of the DJ ... ) . By the way ,no 
offers  to bring charcoal yet - anybody?

Boozy Drink - Only alcoholic beverages allowed are beer and wine , and even 
then only in the Owl Burrow picnic area.

Park Stuff - 
 I forgot to mention - no pets allowed in the park. 
 There's always been a constant breeze blowing through the park in the 
afternoons that I've been there - if you've got a kite , bring it!
 Bring that sun blocker !

What's Yer Tag? - My wife Mary has designed a RADIO! RADIO! name badge that
we're going to laserprint on big tags - And Raffaele has got button blanks for
your decoration! So , bring those markers and get to it!

Setup - If anyone wants to help with setup , you're welcome! Setup will 
 start at12 noon .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
General Notes: 

 Time: 1pm to ?? (8pm?)   .
 Audio augmentation via micro FM stereo transmitter. Bring your FM stereo 
   portable radio!
 DJs Bryce, Laura, Harry Who?, JSL, Talizman, Deaks, and maybe Loren.
 Ice cream and sherbert for the kids ( leftovers for the adults! )

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RADIO! RADIO! - Directions to Sunnyvale Baylands Park

 There is a huge softball complex called Twin Creeks located right next to 
Sunnyvale Baylands Park. There should be enough signs to tell you which 
one you're at. The entrance of Sunnyvale Baylands Park is at the intersection 
of Moffet Park Drive and Caribbean Drive ; the main part of the park is at 
the southeast quadrant of the Caribbean Drive/Lawrence Expressway/
HW 237 intersection.

 Parking at Sunnyvale Baylands Park is $3.00 per vehicle. Cars are allowed
in the park until 8:30PM , the park itself closes at 9PM.

FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO PENINSULA :
First , get to HW 237 -

  HW 280 - South , past Palo Alto . Take the HW 85 exit , North to Mtn. View . 
Drive past El Camino and take the HW 237/HW101 South exit. You will then
be on HW 237 , East. 

 HW 101 - South , past Mountain View to Sunnyvale. Take the Alviso / 
Milpitas exit to HW 237 East. 

 Once on HW 237 East,  drive past Fair Oaks Ave. and take the Lawrence
Expressway/Caribbean Drive exit - choose the Caribbean Drive branch of
the exit. Stay in the right hand lane on Caribbean Drive - the park entrance 
is the first right turn as soon as you drive over HW 237.  After the toll
booth , take the right hand drive to the last picnic area , called Owl Burrow.

FROM THE EAST BAY:
 From HW 880 - Drive south on HW 880 towards San Jose and Milpitas. At
Milpitas, take the Alviso Rd./Calaveras Blvd. exit to HW 237 West . Drive
towards Mountain View and Sunnyvale . Use the Lawrence Expressway/
Caribbean Drive exit , taking the first Caribbean Drive branchoff. The
entrance to the park will be the first right turn after the on-ramp . After 
the toll booth , take the right hand drive to the last picnic area , called 
Owl Burrow.

FROM SANTA CRUZ:
 Take HW 17/880 from Santa Cruz , through the mountains and hills to 
Los Gatos and San Jose. Take HW 280 north towards San Francisco , and 
take the Lawrence Expressway exit and head north/east towards the bay 
on Lawrence. After driving  about five miles , you'll reach the HW237 
overpass. Once over HW 237 , the park entrance is at the right. After the 
toll booth, take the right hand driveway to the end , to the picnic site 
called  Owl Burrow.

LOCAL DIRECTIONS:
 Assuming you know how to get to either Mathilda Ave. , Fair Oaks Ave. ,
Wolfe Road, or Lawrence Expressway , drive up any of them towards the 
bay.  
 Mathilda Ave. intersects HW 237 - take the HW 237 East exit , and
exit HW 237 at the Caribbean Drive offramp. 
 Wolf Road merges into Fair Oaks Ave ; take the HW 237 East exit , and use 
the Caribbean Drive exit . If you miss the entrance to HW 237 from Fair Oaks , 
take any right hand turn after you drive over HW 237 - you'll intersect 
Caribbean Drive. Turn right onto Caribbean Drive , and continue to Sunnyvale 
Baylands Park.
 Lawrence Expressway becomes Caribbean Drive at HW 237 - the entrance to 
the park will be on the right after HW 237.

Hope to see you there!

> Are the songs mentioned on the cd mixed by a dj or seperate tracks?

For the most part, they are separate tracks.  Josh Wink's track is 11 
minutes long, and while he does have some beautiful tracks out, he is 
also an amazing dj (met him at Rebirth this past weekend in Cleveland), 
leading me to believe that his track may be an excerpt from one of his 
sets.

Either way, it's great to finally be on CD ;)

Hi,

Am I right in assuming that there might be a Full Moon Rave this evening
(Or early Sat morning)?

If so,  then I would like to be in the queue or phone tree.    Again,
I suspect that around 11 pm,  I'll be getting gobs of calls from people
asking me where it is,    so for those in the know,  please phone me
so I can discretly spread the word around.    Again,   I'll give out
my number(s)....   1-415-381-5847  or 1-800-381-5847 (Use sparingly
pleeze).

By the way,   after I learn it's location,   would I be giving too much
away to give out the location in my outgoing message?

I only have 15 seconds of outgoing message time on my machine.  And 
Oh!!  how wonderful it is to have local access to Netcom...

See U all there....
Peace

  of course just leave some e-mail...

	RADIO! Sat.  I have been receiving this mailing list for about
	6 weeks now but have been so busy that I have not been able to
	attend any events.  Very upset that I missed F&F3 but am
	looking forward to the next one.  Anyway looks like my Sat
	might just clear up enough so that I can make it to RADIO!
	RADIO! hopefully!  I want to meet all the SFRavers since I
	have been reading your posts for a while now and you all sound
	like a fun bunch.  So IF I make it please come up and say HI.
	I will be the 6'7" blond with shorts (probally purple) and a
	tan button down shirt with a T-shirt under it.  Of course I
	will make a name tag for myself.

I can try and forward info to the sf list as long as i stay subbed to it.  I
live in Ohio but recently joined the sf list just to see what the chatter is
like.  There is an event here (in Dayton, Ohio, about two hours north of
Lexington) that you might be interested in coordinating a return home for.

Its called Voodoo, and dj's include Joey Beltram, Mark Farina, John Acquaviva
and a rare live performance by Vapour Space.  Plus local dj talent, chill out
room, etc.  Call 513.496.1071 for directions and info.

Peace,

Jim

Thanks for the info! I doubt the sfraves list people would be
interested in Lexington itenararies, but I would be. Funny you'd
mention Dayton, that's where I moved to from Lexington (worked at
WPAFB, lived in Huber Heights). Don't think I'd go there if I visited
Lex though. I drive 2 hours every weekend to San Francisco (I live in
Sacramento), and if I go to Lexington, I don't think I want to do a
lot of driving.

Someday I think it'd be really fun to take a crate back to Lex and
spin at a party there. Likewise, if any of you are ever going to be
out here, let me know. I'm involved with throwing a lot of small-med
undergrounds and outdoor renegades (as well as some regular events)
and can probably get you in the lineup.

My spinning debut was last Sat. Wow! That was killer. Watching 200
people dance their asses off to my stuff was one of the coolest things
in my whole life :) :) :)

i just wanted to thank Chris for bringing this to my (our) attention.
i know many of you out there probably don't care about this stuff, and
it is not really rave related, but on the other hand, the WWW is a
really interesting way to interact with people and information.  much
like a rave, i guess, in that sense.

so i guess i'm just writing in encouragement of people sending
pointers out to any really groovy things they see out there.

exploring the new frontier,
Bob

 Well , I got my trial/fine notification in the mail today from the
Municipal Court of San Leandro-Hayward Judicial District. This was 
in regards to the birthday party we had for Bryce and the other
Leos at the Oyster Point Park.

 I quote:
 "Clear this citation on or before the due date of 09/16/94 by:
 1) Paying $270.00    OR
 2) Appear in court - This court has walk in court Mon. - Fri. except 
    holidays. You must be at the Traffic window Room 102, by 7:45 A.M.
    The cut off to appear in court is the first fifty people."

 What I don't understand - does this mean , if I take the time to come 
to the court , I may end up paying less than $270.00 ?

Mine was $270 - what the fuck?

There was something on there about a "walk-in-court". Does that mean
that we can just show up and fight the ticket? The cop isn't likely
to show up on the same day that I decide to go in.

Or will the judge just say "Were you there? - Guilty. Pay your fine."

$270 - ouch!

Subject: mtv

hi all,
an intersting thing happened wednesday that i wanted to get some feedback on.

we drove to new york to pick up the emerald forest fliers, and stopped by
kier's house to show here what they looked like and to give her some.  we
were chillin for a while talking about the party and the question came up
about media coverage of the event.  she's doing a lot of interviews with
some of the more underground dance zines and she's been talking about the
"emrald forest moonrise gathering" in the interviews.  as it turns out,
there a lot of
people interested in coming to the event, and possibly doing some type of
feature story about it.  for us, it's an odd thing, and while unappealing
in many ways, still tantalizing for the international recognition that
this event would receive.  anyway, i think if mixmag, or djtimes, or
project x, or vibe, or urb wanted to do some type of story we probably
wouldn't have a problem with that.

however, that's not the funny thing.  what is is that kier got a call
from mtv, and they not only wanted to cover the event, they offered
promotion as in they would hype it up on the station prior to the party.

after about 5 seconds of thought, we all agreed that our answer would be
no.  so we told mtv in a nice way that they weren't invited.  i'm just
wondering what anyone might think of that decision...

as a side note, our policy for any jounalistic coverage would be
absolutely no
lighting is allowed at our parties other then what we provide
so there won't be any flash
camera's going off, or any film crews obnoxiously lighting up the dance
floor.

do you think the zine coverages would be cool?

any zines we should or shouldn't allow?

lonnie

(just wanting a bunch of $.02's to add up to a $10.00 decision
     we don't feel this should be just our call)

Maybe it was $270.. I got confused with my $235 parking ticket:). I knew 
it was some insane amount of money. My friend heard when people were 
talking to the cops that the sign was "stolen" from the premises. Thus 
there was no sign posted at the site at the time of the party.

Greetings!

I have several things to pass on:

1)  There is a majordomo list on ultima.org specifically devoted to 
    discussion of this topic.  please feel free to subscribe, or get 
    more info:  majordomo@ultima.org, contents: help. the list is called
    oyster-gate :)

2)  each citation is, i assume US$270: mine was issued for this amount.

3) this is, IMNSHO, an outrageous fine, way out of line for the essentially
   victimless "crime" it was

4) a copy of relevant portions of the cited ordinance is available via
   anonymous ftp from ultima.org, directory pub/Oyster.Bay.Info

5) those wishing to appear in court must do so before September 19, 1994;
   however, you need not appear in Hayward, per the ordinance

6) this citation is for a misdemeanor, not a "mere" traffic-type ticket.
   although i am not entirely sure of the consequences of misdemeanors vs.
  "tickets" vs. felonies, i suspect it leaves a more permanent record than
  a generic parking ticket. the information mailed out to us does not 
  mention this fact :(

Because it is a misdemeanor a friend of mine said that we might be
able to request a jury trial?

I really like this. It doesn't forbid reporting or picture taking,
just forbids that truly annoying bright light in your face, which can
be a BIG vibe killer under certain circumstances. Besides, anyone who
goes to the trouble of using a sensitive video camera or high speed
film will get a truer representation of what it's really like. Not to
mention possible consequences of having a conservative employer
watching you dance, soaked in sweat, with that trance look on your
face...

	There is a package, called term (or term114/term115 or what is the
	latest version), that run in the same way and is public domain. 
	I'm using it under Linux, so I can run Mosaic on a standard dialup 
	connection or I can have multiple shells. I think it is installed 
	on netcom, but I'm using a private copy newer than what they have.
	The major drawback (but I think it is the same with this TIA tool)
	is that it run on Unixes only, so you have to have a Unix (or Linux,
	or whatever else is around) box. You get the sources and you find 
	binaries for Mosaic modified for term for some platforms (so you don't
	need to have the Motif libraries). 

	If you need more informations or you want to install it and need some
	help, feel free to drop me a mail.

You might want to call the prosecutor's office and talk to them about
it. The "average" fine (that issued by the judge) could be a lot less
than the pre-pay, i.e. the judge may typically sentence such cases
lightly. Also find out court costs.

Someone very reasonable might also want to discuss it with the
prosecutor or judge and see if it can be dismissed. If there actually
was no sign (drive there during the day and take pictures -- even if
there is one it may not be very visible or visible at night), then
paint yourself as a bunch of people just looking for a place to play
music and dance without bothering anyone. Point out there was no
alcohol, no drugs, no litter (indeed you had trash bags and left the
place cleaner than when you found it), no destruction, no violence, no
graffiti, and otherwise nothing socially disturbing. Also offer to
pass the word around (like at places where one gets flyers) that there
is a curfew at that space and it should not be used.  You were acting
in good faith and thought you had found a place for your little
gathering where they could be outdoors (for free) without disturbing
anyone.  If you appear utterly responsible and regretful perhaps you
will get a token fine.  Someone who knows the judge better might be
able to tell you that.

You might also find out if there is a statute that requires curfews to
be clearly posted at parks and such. If so, and they weren't, your
lawyer could get all the tickets dismissed.

Suggestions:

-- See if there is a lawyer on the list, or a lawyer friend of someone
   on the list who might take the case pro-bono. They could spend one
   court date representing everyone.

-- If worst comes to worst, we might try raising some funds to help
   pay off the tickets. At around $5800 for the lot of you, that's
   pretty ambitious, but you might get enough to help a little.

-- At the very least, get some addresses...councilpeople, mayor,
   whatever, and we can start a letter writing campaign about the
   unfairness.

-- Character witnesses? Some very respectable people could testify
   that Liquid * parties are extremely responsible and that they don't
   believe you'd have been there if there had been a sign or any other
   reason to believe the land was off-limits after dark.

More ideas if I come up with them. I'll pledge $50 to a fund if it
comes to that.

If all of you can and do request jury trials you'll either get them
dismissed or have the satisfaction of watching the courts jump through
hoops. I doubt a jury would levy that kind of fine anyway.

I'm extremely upset by this, even more so because I wasn't there
with you all when it happened.  In fact, I'm wide awake now
writing this because I can't sleep from thinking about it.

I'm thinking that this whole thing is on par with what happened
two Halloween's ago with GRAVE in Minneapolis.  The party was
busted and every one of the several hundred people there was
charged with something like aiding and abetting the sale of
alcohol in an unlicensed establishment.  The fines were very
high, maybe $600 per person.  The final result was that the entire
case was dismised.

One of the first things that was done was that someone found a 
lawywer willing to represent the entire group.  The first thing
the lawyer did was tell everyone NOT to pay the fine in advance.
The lawyer had each person request an individual trial, that they 
NOT be processed as a group, and when the City of Minneapolis realized 
what a zoo that would be they droppped everything.

Failing that kind of approach, I'm wondering if the fine could
be reduced to something like $25 per person.  I spent a day in
traffic court watching people get their several-hundred dollar
speeding tickets reduced SUBSTANTIALLY.  A large number of people
at Liquid Leo are students and cannot afford the cruel and unusual
fine of $270, maybe the judge would take pity.

I feel so sick at heart about all this.  If it comes down to it I
will donate $270 to a fund to help people (especially the students)
pay their fines; but I don't think you all should just roll over and
pay up without trying to get things dropped or reduced first.

Uh, yeah, could someone re-post the subscribe address for this mailing list?
I had no idea this shit would be 270 dollars.

Welcome to the system!  I would love to spend days and days fighting this.
But, right now I am a co-op, and I am supposed to be impressing the
world's best computer company:

"I can't make it to work today becuase I have to appear in court.  I was
at the wrong party a month ago"

It would be much easier for me to just pay the 270 dollars and admit
defeat.  I don't know if I will do that, but it is one of the more likely
options.

I've been using tia for a couple days now, and for the most part I'm
impressed.  These guys will make tons of (well deserved) money.  It's
25 bucks per license, which is very affordable considering how much
the typical SLIP account costs at most sites (many have hourly rates).

It took me about an hour to set up (ordering is instantaneous w/ a
credit card... you download the SW from their site).  It requires
TCP/IP (of course) and some kind of SLIP software (I use InterSLIP
from InterCon).

There are a few drawbacks... Some software will not work with it (See
U See Me, for example), and netcom users cannot use it to read news
(netcom has some kind of facist policy of denying access to their nntp
server to people with lowly shell accounts... not a problem if you
have access to another nntp server), and I have yet to get eudora to
work quite right.  Prolly my fault.  Mosaic, fetch, Anarchie, and
others all work fine.

It's definantly worth checking out... in addition to the URL Chris
posted, you can telnet to marketplace.com to order.

I'd say it's definantly worth the $25, even after just trying it for 3
days or so.

Is anyone from the Berkeley area going?  Can anyone give me and one other 
a ride (we'll help pay gas if that is an issue)?  Does anyone know of a 
better event to which I should attend?

All these questions ;)

I'll be logged on frequently today, so please mail or talk request this 
address.  Thanks.

I'm getting a lot more than 3, so far I've gotten 11 copies of Sean's
Interstellar Outback (THE CD!) message. Many other messages are also
repeating.

I'm trying to contact my friend Mark the Lawyer, who lives in SF but
is back east right now.  He'd relish at least giving some good advice
on this case.  I'm sure he'll chuckle when he hears about the missing
sign.  Before anyone does anything rash, give me another day or so
to track him down (he's visiting family in New York right now).

I'm glad Laura brought up the GRAVE bust, and I think there's a strong
lesson in that.  

Anyway, I'll get back to the list the minute I hear from Mark.

I receive the list at 2 addresses. At judge@foundation.tricon.com I'm 
just getting one of each, but at komotion@netcom.com I get anywhere from 
3 to 11 copies of some things.

Brother, brother, what's goin' on?

Considering that all the problems reported are with netcom accounts,
and considering that Brian has checked hyperreal and the majordomo
and mail logs, it must mean that something is wrong at netcom.  Maybe 
you all should let Netcom know that something is seriously messed up?

Just trying to be helpful, hope it gets fixed soon,

Perhaps netcom, yet again, has its head shoved firmly up its ass.

Or something :-)

BIG HUGE amounts of applause to Larry and Mary Ching for their
efforts organizing a stellar picnic.  The day was gorgeous, the
site was perfect except for a bit too much wind, the people were
great (it was really nice to see people like Jim and to meet his
wife Barbie and their new baby), the music was way nifty, and the
food was yummy!  And Raffaele's new SFR buttons were beautiful!  

My only regret is that I forgot to bring Georgina.  She would have
liked it. :-).  We *might* get out to Futur tonight, but I'm a
bit tired from being in the sun.  I remembered to put on sunblock,
but Brian is red as a lobster.

Score:  well-organized daytime picnics 10, falling in the poison oak
	in Santa Cruz 0  :-) ;-)

GO GO GO SFR . . . that friendly family feeling is really building!

I seem to have left my water bottle holder at the RADIO! RADIO! party location.
If anyone found a water bottle holder please email me and I would be glad
to make arrangements to retrieve it. It's clear vinyl vertical straps with
blue stretchy horzizontal straps and had a bottle of Crystal Geyser water in
it. 
By the way, nice party. Perfect weather!!

"an opportunity to hear DJs *we* don't normally get to hear"

Who is this *we*?  Some of us have heard a good many of these DJs.
I'm all for expanding party DJ lists to include out-of-town and "unknown"
talent, that's for sure.

But without making this too pointed, Ken, once again you're presupposing
and it's fairly apparent it would be helpful for you actually to *hear*
some of this stuff?  Second best, to hear some tapes, I'd gladly dub a
couple for you to give you the idea.

Jeno is from England.

peace out

I'm sorry I had to miss this one, but I really want to give Larry and
virtual hug for carrying through on this.  Another sfr breakthrough!
The first (that I know of) WIRELESS party!

I'm listening to my favorite tape (Jon Williams and Phil Smart's Kitchen

The great thing about this list is that you guys CAN ORGANIZE.
I bet if you all put your heads together and each  contributed $50.
You could hire a lawyer to take your case AND GET ALL THE CHARGES
DROPED and maybe even have the citations revolked (so they don't appear
on your record).  The net is here, make use of it.

So, there's some good music on the telee?  It's too bad we don't get it 
in Santa Cruz, but is there someone out there that would be willing to 
tape this or some other good show on Flux so I can watch it?  I would 
supply the tape or give you something equally nice in return for this 
wonderful gift you give this uncultured santacruziano.  

If anyone would like to do this, email me back "off the air".  :)

ack.  you are correct - if you appear in court and plead extenuating
circumstances or something you may be able to get a reduced fine.  I suggest
_everybody_ go in on the same day, it may help.  also if anyone knows a
lawyer they may be able to suggest what to say, etc.

I can *guarantee* each post is only being sent to netcom users once, by 
looking at my mail log.  

If someone from netcom could save 11 similar messages together, with
their *entire* headers, compress that and upload it to hyperreal into
/incoming, I'll take a look at it.

Just for balance, I should point out that the phrase Ken used was also 
used in Ethan's post about how Friends and Family parties will always 
have one or two new DJ's in the lineup.

I think many of us have itchy trigger fingers these days.

Just a pointer to the oyster-gate list . . . if you were at the party
and are concerned about the $270 fine and misdemeanor charge, please
get yourself on the oyster-gate list as that is where developments
will be posted first.

To subscribe -- mail majordomo@ultima.org and put

subscribe oyster-gate 

in the body of the message.

Thanks to Phred we are close to having either a lawyer or a contact for
a laywer.  I strongly suggest that you do not rush out to pay your fines
or arrange for time off for the court date until the lawyer has been
consulted.  There are several courses of action that could be taken; but
paying off the fine right away will be only admitting defeat when it could
be the case that the fine will be eliminated or reduced.  You might have
to end up going to court, but then again you might not -- it's too early
to tell right now without consulting with the laywer.

So please just hang tight and get yourself on the oyster-gate list to
stay abreast of the situation.

Laura

GRAVE actually happened in Milwaukee, not Minneapolis.

This is of course entirely unimportant except for the fact that us
midwesterners get awful persnickety when people can't tell us apart.

stevie, who grew up 50 miles from Milwaukee but has never been to Minneapolis.

	Would it be inappropriate for me to make a partially
philsophical and partially commercial statement here? If so I
apologize.

Philosophy: Netcom has 30,000 users now. In my opinion that is *too
huge*. Net providers should be small and decentralized, serving their
local community, with a number of users that they can handle.  One of
the great things about the net is that it is decentralized. Tiny
providers all over can just start up and people can get connected
through a system in their own town. A system with a few dozen machines
in San Jose and POPs all over the country is so much like America
Online and Compu$erve that in my opinion it is antithetical to the
"spirit of the net".
	The fact that netcom is so huge is causing many these problems.
SunOS wasn't really meant for 30,000 users, really.

Commercial: There are those of us who are setting up small community
oriented public access net sites. I have set one up in Berkeley, I
think Bryce has set one up or is in the process of setting one up in
San Francisco.. We're offering network access for cheaper and in a
more personalized way than the giants, netcom, crl, etc.

	I urge you to support your local providers, who can provide
you network access with personalized service and a commitment to the
community that they are serving.

Tuesday, August 23rd (that's this week) will be the last night for 
Together.  The party ran for two years but it is now time to say 
goodbye.  The final night will be as usual:  1015 Folsom, 21+, doors
at 10pm, but there will be one wonderful exception--it's all gonna
be free!  DJ's, well I forgot to ask, but I'm sure you won't be
disapointed.  See you there.


Take care.

RADIO! RADIO!  -  Post Picnic Report

 Well , I liked it - of course , I may be biased. 

 Bryce beat me to the site , with half of his equipment unloaded when I got
there. Raffaele , and then Willis Wong , showed up to help with the setup.

 Thanks to all the folks who came and shared and danced. It was great to 
see so many new and old faces - I wish that I had talked to everyone. 

 The FM stereo transmitter didn't work out as well as I'd hoped - I'll need 
to design a signal pre-processer and a better antenna to cut down on the
noise & distortion. Also , maybe another frequency than the one shared by 
a Portugese radio station in Gilroy.

 Thanks to all the DJs! Bryce , Laura , Ernie Deaks , John S. Lee/JSL , Harry
Who , Talizman , and Loren. My apologies for not getting the second tarp 
up sooner - if we ever do that site again , blocking that strong afternoon
breeze will have to be planned for. Also , for next time - a sound level 
meter to help track the volume level to park ranger specifications. 

 It was definitely a learning experience for me - I'll be posting something 
on the planners list about what I could have done , or could have done better.
The one big mistake I made was forgetting to ensure a back-up sound system
in case Bryce had an unfortunate accident!

 Great weather , a bothersome but not totally mean parker ranger , and 
good people!

Subject: If this is the Futur.....
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I must at first admit that I expected something different from Futur, but
Futur is what I got.  I thought I was going to hear the East Coast dj's of
Acid House and Progressive House music. NOT!!!! 
Instead, Joey, & DB played industrial grade 145bpm + plus Hardcore. Since
this was my first, I guess I am measuring my response to it, by my experience
of dancing to it. Joey blasted off like a runaway subway train on speed.
Instead of dancing into a body gro0ve I found myself furiously trying to keep
up with the beat.

 Not unlike my experience of dancing to Ska music this summer in Tahoe. Maybe
frenzy is the wished for psychic state? Could someone tell me if this music
is driven more by speed than X? 

While Josh Wink did play some House, it wasn't until Jeno began at 4:00am,
did I think that the party began. At 4, the entire vibe of the party changed.
Fresh replacements, many SFravers, lee and janie, Craig, Peter and a few
other notables appeared out of nowhere. I did go to the party to hear Jeno
play a massive sound sytem, and I wasn't disappointed.

 By comparison, I noticed that Jeno plays with and to the crowd. The music
rising and falling organically, my heart rate rising and lowering.  Dancing
to it creates waves of exhilaration and trance. The hardcore was faster than
a speeding bullet, never varying speed, once began.

Certainly ,the sound and light show was among the best of the summer's
parties, and the dancers also added to the visuals. Am I just cynical in
thinking that the hardcore I heard is just headbanger heavy metal gone disco?
Did I miss something here?  ........ Robertj...........Monterey

It seems that Brian said y'all should go together to appear in court, 
while someone else said keep your cases seperate.  Should I be wasting 
your time pointing this out?  Maybe if you do all go together and try to 
not get your cases lumped into one, I think Laura said that.

Hello merry SF Ravers. I was recently a NW Raver from Seattle but now I live 
down here as of three weeks ago and I am a proud new subscriber to this list!

I was wondering, among other things, could anyone suggest a few addresses 
of Alaskan ravers or people who might know Alaskan raver types. We (XLR8R 
Magazine (stuffy rave fanmag)) are doing at bit on rave up there and would 
like to get further in our research as our writer up there is having a 
bit of difficulty figuring things out.

Thanks and thanks,

Andrew

     A note from a lurker...
     
     Radio Radio was terrific. I'd been waiting all summer long for it. It 
     was my first event, but definately not my last!
     
     Meeting all of you (Larry, Laura, Ron, the list is long and 
     distinguished) was a blast! Larry, thanks so much for all the effort 
     you and Mary put into planning. 
     
     The weather was beautiful! My buddy Alex had a great time harnessing 
     the wind for his stunt kites.
     
     Kudos and good karma points to all those involved in planning/spinning 
     for this fantastic event!

i don't have my notice with me at the moment, but as i recall it said that
you'd _still_ pay the fine before you go to court (which is a trial by
judge only) & you'd get it refunded if found not guilty.
we're going to request a month's extension (& maybe keep doing that as long
as we can get away with it).

from my court experience, if you set a court date and plead not guilty, 
you pay the fine as bail...

the wierd thing is that if you plead "guilty with an explanation"
you dont have to pay the fine until you go to court

this creates an interesting situation becuase the officer
does not have to show up, but the judge can still let you off
this was in traffic court and i dont know what different options might be 
available for this situation, BUT chances are you
have to pay before and then get a refund

Its kinda cute how you're innocent until proven guilty,
but you not only have to lend the government money
until they say you are not guilty
but you have to lose money/time by going to court
just because you are innocent

i just wonder how many people have "proved their guilt"
because they couldnt take time off work
or it would cost them more money to do so
or simply lack of transportation

i dunno.. the words "drowning" and "witch trials"
seem to come to mind

OK, so it was your dependable Jeno set, but it did it for me.  I really tried
to dance to the other DJs slammin sets but I just couldn't get going and I
really like hardcore - it's killer on the pumpin' car stereo at night at 90+
mph or at home in that immobile, at-one-with-the-couch state of mind.
 Fortunately, Richmond civic center gives you the option of a great balcony
view of the whole show(and show it was but that's why I went.)  I *really*
enjoyed watching the Lasers, dancers, etc. and nodding my head to some really
amazing 150 bpm choons - a nice balance of relaxation/stimulation.  The
work-out from Jeno was way too short and left me hungry for more.  Couldn't
talk anyone into driving me to Sunset and I didn't feel capable even with a
couple of double mochas in me.  Anyone else in Marin want to carpool once in
a while?

We had a pretty good time at Future.  A high tech production, but not
overly cheesed in commercialism; excellent visuals, sound and assorted 
extras like exotic dancers and a firebreather.  The main feature of this 
party was the out-of-town DJs and live techno bands.  Most of the nite 
featured music that was harder and faster than anything we ever get at the 
mainstream parties around here.  When we arrived (2am), DJ DB was spinning 
an eclectic high energy set that thoroughly entertained me. It was also my 
first taste of a DJ who does the MC thing with a microphone.  I've never 
depended on a DJ screaming in my face to inspire me to dance, but the 
crowd seemed to react positively to it, and it didn't detract too much from 
some great spinning.

The heat of the main room and the high bpms wasn't Janie's cup of tea, so
we spent a lot of time in the alternative space located near the front
entrance.  It was kind of an inconsistant atmosphere there; ambient DJs 
alternating between the hard acid trance of the live bands.  For $25, I 
would have liked to have seen one of the side rooms opened as a real chill 
space.  Of the live acts, Air Liquide was the only one that impressed me.  
The ambient (with beats = soft trance?) sets were very good however.

Overall Future was a good party.  The vibe was pretty good, not exactly a
love-in, but lot's of enthusiasm and happy faces.  

The Sun, Moon, & Stars:

I have to say that by far, Sunset has been my favorite regular party this
summer.  Great sound, great DJing, great vibe, great scenery, beautiful
setting, free/donation, easy access (4 me) and completely legal.  This time 
we got to hear Tracy spin a truly wonderful set, along with the regulars 
Galen & Solar whom we have loved week after week.  Mark (Ameba) had every 
right to be proud of his mate's performance, and his grin was so wide as he 
pranced around to it that I thought his head was going to split in two. <:-D

The setting was extra spectacular this week - a red/orange/purple dusk
covering one half of the sky, and a huge glowing full moon and emerging 
stars taking command of the other.  At the top of the hill, the 360 degree 
view was breathtaking.  At the party`s peak there were about 200 people, 
half of them dancing.  The park setting is so great for chilling and 
socializing.  I was reminded of the days of the weekly GG Park parties at 
Marx Meadows where people saw each other's smiles and got to interact.  The 
Sunset parties seem even warmer and friendlier than those were, and they 
last so much longer too, from 2 to 9:30.  It's great to see the breakdown 
of cliques and the happy interactions between ravers, local families, dogs, 
kids, kites, bubbles...  Things generally start to take off at around 5-6, 
peaking at sunset (surprise!) and staying strong until the end.  

Even though we had no sleep the nite before and the music was a bit more
laid back than at Future, being outdoors made us feel so much more alive 
that we *really* danced our asses off.  Galen, the who heads the "Pacific"
group that puts these on is yet another hero of the noncommercial SF Bay
Area house scene.  They are planning an extra long Sunset party for Labor 
Day weekend, and a nighttime rave in a month or so.

	Well Future was exactely what I had expected music-wise.  Didn't
	really enjoy being worn out by deadly fast beat with no groove.  I
	was too worn out to stay and hear any of Jeno, we were just leaving
	and it did seem like the music was picking up.

	I enjoyed meeting all the new faces there (Matt, Michelle, Milton, and
Nina).
	I would like to say the groove and the vibe between everyone was great
	and I had tons of fun talking with the groups of people.

	I only hope that in the "futur" that the music will be more in synch
with the
	crowd.  In addition I did not take to kindly to paying $25 to get into
	the place after I waited 45 minutes to get in.  Was it my imagination
	or did that line start moving only after they started charging $25.

	Ron.

Personally, I thought Futur was great.. I got in at around 9 pm (only paid
$15 and didn't wait in line for the security check for more than about 15
minutes) and was very impressed by the setup, even though the acoustics 
were a lot less than perfect (the reverb off the auditorium walls gave it
that "school gym" feeling).. Being a worshipper of the 303, I LOVED the
stuff being spun (who was that British guy?  I thought he was incredible..)
and most of the people around *me* seemed to really be enjoying it.  I 
hardly left the dance floor before heading for home at around 8 am.  

When the music was over, someone (I'm assuming it was the promoter) got up on
stage and thanked everyone, "including those guys who flew out from texas",
whom John (swoosh@cats.ucsc.edu) and I had picked up at the airport earlier
that day.. (Hi Chris and Mike!)  --for those who don't know, Mike was the
one who could do some *pretty* cool things with lightsticks.. :)

The visuals were intense -- absolutely spectacular - lasers, really trippy 
projections, and colored light effects really made the show (although 
I wanna kill the person who decided every three seconds was a good time 
to turn on the fog machine - cough, cough).  It was cool running into 
more sfravers (some of whose names I've forgotten.. I met sooo many people on
Saturday!) :) and especially ucsc ravers (like Matt!)  They even had this
weird floor show thing going on on a platform in the center of the dance
floor -- dancers covered in mirrors and glow in the dark things.. I could
never quite figure that out.  

The space-cheerleader quotient was high, as well as a lot of *young* 
people - I met a lot of 14, 15, and 16 year olds there (not that I should
talk, I just turned 18 last month). :)  I thought the vibe was really 
good, though, and it was definitely one of the best events I've been to 
all summer.  A lot of people came a long way for it, too (I ran into some 
people I went to high school with in Santa Barbara).  I was a little
disappointed to be the only sfravergurlinablacksprtsbra there though.
(Shame on you, susie and laura, you hawdcoah gurls!), but it was definitely
worth EVERY second (and every dollar I paid.. I feel sorry for whoever gets
to clean the women's bathrooms today).

I've been told that Pure Space at the DNA is now the hottest midweekly
party in SF.  I've always found the DNA to be a somewhat gloomy club 
setting, but if you want to hear SF's top name DJs and be with people who 
are really there to dance, Pure Space is apparently the place to be thursday

$25 dollars?  Boy am I glad I didn't waste my time.  You know, I think 
the next step is going to be where they charge you on a sliding scale 
based on how much money is in your checking account.  and they won't even 
need to see your atm card, because we will all have barcodes permanently 
cemented to our foreheads, so they can just access your account in the 
blink of an eye.  it's so painless.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my informal poll concerning Friends
and Family Four.  I tried to repond to you each individually, but got
lost during the past 4-5 days.  My apologies.  I did read each piece of
email carefully...and taken your comments to part.

So far, nearly 25 people have written in response.  The rate of response
has tailed off substantially since the weekend, so i'm taking it that most
everyone who wants to respond /has/ responded.  If not, please forward your
reply to me soon, so that it can guide me early on in the preparations.

The overwhelming response was that Saturday, September 24th was a fine date,
and that folks did want to have a party then.  I've spoken with the folks
at Komotion, and the date is confirmed, so we are all set there.

The primary concern of almost every response was the heat and humidity.
Both ethan and i have spoken with the folks at komotion, and they are very
aware of the problem, and want to help.  They have offered a number of 
suggestions, including doing the work up front and having our parties pay
back their investment, and alternately, gathering the money from the parties,
and having it done when there's enough money.  One kind person from the list
has offered to front some money...thanks, you know who you are.  Needless
to say, I will be talking with Matt, Judge, and other people from the
collective, and i will get back to you with the plan we agree on.  Thanks
again for your help!

The consensus was not so clear on the format of music for the big room
during the next party.  Quite a number of people were in favor of all
ambient, a number said that any format would be ok, one person suggested
that if we were to do all ambient that we should change the name, since
folks had an expectation of an F&F as hot and sweaty dance music, and
several others suggested varying the music from ambient to dub to dance
and back down to ambient over the course of the night.  A couple of folks
requested all dance like we have had for past Friends and Families.  It
would seem that diversity is the safest course :)  I will attempt to 
provide something to please as many folks as I can.  Thanks again for
your suggestions!

Well, that's it for the report so far.  If you have further comments,
please send them along by the end of this week!

In keeping with the continuing spirit of Friends and Family, the SFRaves
and community party, I'm calling on the list to help provide the talent
(musical, visual, and other) to help produce the next Friends and Family
party, which will be held near the Autumnal Equinox, on Saturday, September
24th, 1994.  Preference will be given to list people, and we will try to
invite at least one person from outside the list to share their talents
with us, and we will also try to debut at least one person in the big 
room.  

A number of you have already expressed an interest in performing.  Thanks
for your requests...no need to repeat them, i have them in a folder.  If you
haven't sent me (brycer@ultima.org) a note that you're interested in playing
for this one, please do so by the end of the week.  As I mentioned in my
prior post, the format will be diverse in the big room and probably in the
hallway as well.  Note that we also have only 10-12 slots available, so I 
may not be able to schedule everyone who is interested for this event...sorry.
Also, for you musical folks, if i haven't heard you play, i would like to
hear a tape...this is in keeping with ethan's request for the last party.

Thanks again for all your help, and for helping make these such great parties!

Well, seeing as how I was one of  happy people near
amaranth (Kia, Kristin) and also being a 303 fiend, I
thoroughly enjoyed the extreme acid and intensity of the
night.  The light show was simply incredible, with the spheres
and transformations  going on in the Triangular
screen.  Powerful sound that did the severity of the music justice.
Yes, it wore you down fast and blitzed a traditional nice/peace vibe,
but experiencing that extreme was just amazing for me.  Absolutely
worth the $15 I paid to get in.  I guess a lot of people didn't
get to see how it built up, but I really liked the choreography of
the evening.  They started off much more mellow, with almost no lights,
and then started picking things up, sending off a powerful series of
strobes and a wash of color every now and then, and only began
introducing things like the lasers after an hour or more, and then
finally got to things like the video and craziness well after the music
had just built itself  up to the hardcore state it was around midnight
when the England guy came on.  And Josh Wink was just great.
So, I guess it just depends on your immediate crowd and mood,
and energy... which I had enough of to go straight until the
end, although I was moving much more slowly for the final twisted
da dum dum da doh doh... but... all in all one of the best
parties I've experienced.  It was intense but felt so good.
I personally, can't wait for another one, after at least a month or
two to rest my aching limbs.

And  everyone I met was just in the b                                             yup...  *grin*

Also:  I got to host two ravers from Texas who flew in for this event.
Chris and Mike had a good dtimetime, and I'm not sure exactly how the promoter
heard about them, but it was nice of him to thank them for coming at
the end.  Being as exhausted as we were afterwards, they weren't
quite up enough to continue raving Sundayu, so I ended up dropping them
back off at the airport, where they were able to move their tickets
home from Monday to Sunday./    Mike did have a really cool thing
going on with his glo-sticks, if any of you sawa him.

Well, I did have one for that date, and had posted here a while back,
hoping that someone would take the lead to organize a party for
it.  Unfortunately, no one stepped forward  - the park needed
a deposit 6 weeks in advance.  I suppose it is possible that that
date, or some other one is still open.  If you want, I can give you
the phone numbers and names in the Parks & Rec. Dept., as well
as any pertinent info for taking on such a worthy cause.  d:-)

I'm really suprised to hear about the fast tendencies of Josh Wink and Joeski.
When I left the East Coast last winter, Wink was playing groovy tribal stuff
and Joeski was spinning progressive house.

On the other side of the coin, if you think 145 bpm is fast . . . heh heh heh.
I start my sets around 140 and work up to about 160 . . . and it's not hardcore
I'm playing either :-)

No, I would not say the music is fueled by "speed" or "X" or whatever . . . there's
just a strong lingering influence of the Dutch and German hardcore scenes, but
I thought that was (sadly) dying out based on the reports I was getting from
friends back East.

I am wondering if the East Coast people played fast stuff because they were asked
to by the promoters?

I would not accuse the East Coast DJs of ignoring the crowd -- I've had to play
"on spec" before and it can really kill your desire to put out a good set.  I've
heard of one other party where Beltram was told to play the hard stuff, and he
was bumming because he really wasn't in the mood at all.  A side note to this

oh, never mind the side note, my editor is messed up.

Anyway, I've had some amazingly great times tranced out to blistering hardcore.
Most slower bouncier happier housier stuff puts me to sleep unless it's heavy
on "them acid noizes."  hee hee. 

Now, as for "real" hardcore (as opposed to the fast trance that a lot of peole
out here who don't have a steady diet of 140bpm+ music) goes, that started dying
as an art form a while ago in my not so humble opinion.  I started out spinning
the hardest of the hard -- 160bpm and distored 909's were my lifeline.  For a
short while in the spring of 1993 I was finding lots of good records in that
genre.  But then suddenly it all dropped off and I developed other interests.  
My point is that yeah, I could really see it degenerating into a cross between
speed metal and disco.  It's funny in a cheezy way -- Bryce's set at Liquid Drain-O
is a prime example - we were all laughing and dancing and waving our hands in the
air -- but I think the genre was just too narrowly defined to remain viable for very
long.

Well, enough babbling.  Sorry for the sentences that don't make sense, I have to
get out of my mailer and fiddle with the environment variables for my editor for
a while.

Plenty of sun, very friendly people, excellent music from all DJs, a cool 
breeze, food to share, very colorful SFR buttons, some bubbly babies, a 
coconut in the ice bucket, probably the most sterile bathroom in the bay area,
lots of jester hats!, a trippy goggle-thing which you blow in and look up 
and just go "wowwwww!!"... 
Had a very good time. 
Thanks sfravers.   

Free Life is tonight at Julian & Montgomery in San Jose.  Yep, it's free

Both these events left me feeling I had a nice, well-rounded weekend.

The music at future was fast.  At one point I could not believe how fast it
was.  But even more unbelievable was that I was keeping up with it.  I 
payed for this, not having enough energy to fully enjoy Jeno's sets.  The
Richmond convention center is a great place for Very Large Events.  It 
reminded me of the Shrine in LA.  The vibe was pretty cool.  People really
seemed to be into dancing and having fun.  My 15 dollars was well spent
on previously mentioned visuals.  With all the fog, you could sit up
on the balconies and look down on a truly heavenly 'scape.  I couldn't
imagine heaven being any more visually appealing. 

Sunset was also great.  I really, really enjoyed Tracy's spinning.  I hope
she becomes a regular at sunset.  Her soulful, housey, funk set made up 
for the colder trance sets spun by white males at Futur.

Sunset is held at the most incredible place in the Bay.  You get a full view
of the Bay bridge, the Golden Gate, Downtown, Berkeley and Oakland.
simply wonderful, wonderful.

We went to Futur and had a pretty good time.  The lights were incredible,
the music was fast and hard.

The chill space kinda sucked, though...esp. compared to a Gathering I went
to a while back that was also held at the Richmond Civic Center.  At that
one, a side room had been opened up and there were lots of mats on the
floor where people could lie down for the true chill experience.  At Futur,
the main lobby was the so-called ambient room, a bad place because of the
traffic.  People looked like they were enjoying themselves, however.  There
were some parachutes overhead that softened the decor somewhat, but nothging
on the floor to soften that!

Also, the entry price of $25 was way too much.  

The Sunset party at the Marina, however, was great, as usual.  Tracy & Solar
both did great sets...I got there when Solar was playing.  The full moon
rising over the hill was incredible!

I'm glad to hear that Galen is maybe going to start doing nighttime parties.
He really has his sh*t together.  I probably should say that _Pacific_
has its sh*t together, because there's more people involved than just G.
, I'm sure!

Anyway, I loved the housey sounds of Sunday!  I am way too wimpy for hard-
coah!

feeling very satisfied,

annthrax

Well, this is my first post, I've been reading for a couple of weeks and
thought I should say hi. I live in Santa Cruz and have for 23 years, I've
been spinning for the last 6 years and raving for the last 2 and a half. I
have a small system that i wouldn't mind sharing/using somewhere. As yet I
have not spun a rave/party, but I've been spinning house for along time and
thought it was time to come out of the closet so to speak. I've also got some
lighting equipment. I look forward to meeting you all, and mail me if you can
use my services or if i can help set something up.
 I've heard a lot of people post about the "small party in Santa Cruz" that
happens on Fridays. It's called the Sweat Box (It does get hot as hell!) and
i thought you folks might want better directions. Take Hwy 17 and stay on it.
At the first light take a right, That's Hwy 9/River St. Go up 3 streets to
Encinal, take a left on Encinal. Take your first right and your first right
again. That's it, really easy. It's the last Warehouse on the right, Really
hot, good vibe, good music, i was told it will be happening this Friday (Aug.
26th) and then they are moving to a better location. Usually 5 bucks, or
donations. If you went last week, I'm the guy who showed up with all the
lights.
 Last thing, I'm headed to Oregon on the 25th (Portland) till the 31st.
Anybody know of anything going on up that way?
 Thanks, 
   Taylor

Orbital's new one "Snivilisation" comes out tomorrow (Tuesday) in a
domestic pressing (Can't Wait!!).
Any recommendations for places that will have this and maybe at some
sort of a discount (I don't mind paying more for items if it requires
the input of knowledgeable staff, but this is a no-brainer ;-0

ben franklin said something to the effect that "people who are willing
to trade a little liberty for a little security deserve neither".  i'll
also wager that they'll *get* neither, any takers?

i've seen alot in the media in the last few years about how americans
are increasingly willing to give up personal and civil liberties in order
"to be protected" WRT to hysteria over crime and drugs, and yet i've also
heard that both crime and drug use have been slowly but quite steadily
*decreasing* over a period of several years (don't remember the *exact*
#'s, but you get the idea).  what does this imply?  why would people's
willingness to give up freedom for protection from crime & drugs increase
when both are actually *decreasing*?!?!?   what is giving people the 
perception that they *ought* to trade valuable things like liberty for
a decreasing threat?

anyone have any insight on how these issues relate to the *crime bill*
just passed in the house of rep's?  how does this relate to the concept
and availablility of privacy?  TAZ's?  drugs?  what's the "big picture"?

-----------------

my wife and i were eating in a favorite breakfast joint on haight
st in the city and these 2 middle aged guys in tie dye's sat down next
to us.  the minute they sat down, i had a feeling that there was something
*unusual* about them, they just weren't *at home w/ themselves* or something,
and as the meal progressed we eventually realized they were agents.  i
could be wrong, but i'd bet 500.00 on it any day of the week.  oh, i've
seen *plenty* of middle aged guys in tie dye, my dad included, but these
guys were a treat.  after a while we started baiting them, which was a 
gas.  even if these guys weren't narc's, there was something so 
frightfully insincere about them that it was almost like theatre, real
amusing.  anyone got any ideas for anti-security security?  while we all
know that things like operation dead-end (DEA's attempt to rid SF of
acid, starting w/ the deadheads) are going on around us, at raves, dead
shows, walking down the street on haight st. etc., we never talk about it.
i find that a little wierd, it's not like doing so is incriminating (so
i'm going way out of my way here, in case you hadn't noticed).  anyone
got any good/funny/scary/what-a-joke narc stories?  let's pry the lid
off this sucker...

in this age of crime bills, lack of respect for the constitution and bill
of rights and so on, what can a true freedom loving raver do to protect 
his (fleeting?) liberty?  a whole pack 'o ravers?

I love it when a DJ surprises me like that :). Who says you gotta play
just one kind of music? One of the feelings I got when I played F&F
was that things could go *anywhere*. I'm always excited about parties
where I get that feeling.

A few things:

To protect yourself, know your rights and defend them vigorously. Know
how to deal with law enforcement.

To improve the situation, there's a million groups working towards
reform. They could use your help. Sew seeds. Be a buffer between the
rave community and non-ravers you know.

And don't forget to enjoy what you *do* have.

Doesn't the DEA have a WWW home page or something? :-) I know that they have
a magazine/newsletter available at well-stocked libraries.  It's certainly
interesting reading with lots of statistics and bust stories.  There have
been several articles in national magazines about the LSD crackdown usually
detailing that one young deadhead's now well-known plight - his girlfriend
turned out to be an excellent and dedicated publicist.  Most of these
articles point out the DEA policy change and subsequent Dead attack was
instigated by one person!  Prior to this guy's appointment a few years ago,
the DEA did not conduct investigations to uncover LSD operations, only making
busts on a 'if we run in to it' basis.   Just goes to show what a difference
one person can make. He said something like,"We've hit a vein, and we're
going to mine it till it runs out." nice guy.

Yes I can somehow agree with cheaper but I also beleive in supporting small
local businesses.  Try Gaia Mantra on Valencia @ 16th.  Alex said he will
have it in Wednesday:)
I hear the album is somewhat ambient!

Umm... not what i would call it.  I mean this has already probably
been flamed out in idm or something, but i really dont think
this album is that hot... Its "interesting"

This could be comparable to the way that that guy who your friend is
trying to set you up with is "interesting."  
Whats that netcliche? Mileage May Vary.

  The Grand Canyon mega rave is on and looking great.    Authorities such
as park rangers and police are cool and laying back.    Several hundred
are already on site which is a stunning fabulous forest with lots of
trees.

  Bring a gallon of water per person per day,  it is dry and hot during
the day against dehydration for 3-4 days.   World Unity festival started
on Monday till Saturday evening.

Directions:   Kaibob National forest, Mt Kendrick.    Exit on the Parks
exit coming in on the 14 Rt  from the west.   Turn left at the T junction
of the ramp,  turn right at the gas station on Spring Valley Rd.   At the
junction with 144 road go straight on until the next junction turn left
onto the 90 rt then there will be rangers and sign posts.   180 is not
such a good route.

The war on drugs is a front that keeps us from dealing with the real
issues in government.  Some of the real issues are that this country is
not taking care of its people.  Spending on prisons and incarceration have
gone up, while spending for education has slowly but surely decreased. 
DoesnUt anyone see that if everyone doesnUt have an equal opportunity to
grow and change through education that many of them end up turning to
crime or become a burden off the welfare system, to name just a few
avenues?  Social welfare has gone down steadily in the past 20 years, and
the people that suffer are the poor.  By not dealing with this problem, we
are strangling ourselves as a country.  Instead of locking people up for
doing drugs, why not educate them about the proper use and show them the
possible consequences of abuse? 


One really bad side effect about this stupid war on drugs is the minimum
sentencing bit.  I donUt know how many of you have seen 48 hrs with the
kid who is going to jail for 10 YEARS for selling a sheet of acid.  So we
are filling our prisons with nonviolent people like RRonS I think was his
name, and we are paying $40,000 per year to have a prison guard to guard
him.  For that price we could PAY for all of RonUs college tuition for 3
years.  But instead we are going to pay $400,000 dollars (plus benefits)
to keep Ron locked up in prison, where there is definitely not a good
chance for him to grow.  Someone who goes to college often puts back what
they were given simply by being self sufficient and not being a burden on
society, if they are in prison, they are simply taking up space.  It is
like a snowball effect, because the less we spend on education, mark my
words, the more society will degenerate, and we will feel the need to
build more prisons and give up more of our civil rights to capture these
RcriminalsS, most of which are non-violent and do not belong in prison in
the first place. 

Last night on KGO radio (810 am) Bernie Ward (10pm-2am) had a female
caller whose husband is serving a 4-year term for possession of marijuana. 
She has 2 kids, I believe,and is now trying to support herself and also
send her husband money in jail.  According to this caller, 80% of the
people in this particular prison are serving time for the same types of
crimes:  possession of drugs.  Now what the **** do I care about these
people carrying drugs?  Do we really have to fill up our prisons with
these people?  The prisons are so full it is no wonder to me that some of
the violent offenders kind of Rslip through the cracksS.  And who asked my
permission to build these prisons and pay guards and wardens salaries to
do absolutely nothing but sit on their behinds and watch the prisoners
age? 

ThatUs all for now.  Of course thereUs always dessert...

Greetings!

I had a conversation with Bob Felvidge this evening, who we were referred
to indirectly by a friend of Fred's (thanks so much, Fred!).  Bob has worked
on at least one similar case involving a group of bike messengers in San 
Francisco, and has some familiarity with the East Bay judiciary. 

Bob and I spent some time discussing what I knew about the citations.  We
then went on to discuss some strategies, and possibilities concerning the
citations.

Because of the public nature of these lists, I would prefer that people
who were issued these citations get together to discuss these matters
relatively soon, in person.  I propose a meeting at my house in the
next few days, let's say Friday night.  Please email me privately for
directions and what not.  

Also, Bob has requested the following factual information to help in
his preparation of a case (should we decide to engage his services):

1)  a copy of the entire ordinance
2)  a list of names, addresses and phone numbers of everyone who was cited
3)  a copy of the front and back of a few citations, plus a copy of the
    material mailed by the Alameda County court system.  At the very least,
    he needs a citation written by the second officer...mine was written
    by Badge Number 85.  

I will take care of Item 1.

If you were cited, and will consider participating in this effort, please
send me your contact info as soon as possible.  I will keep this information
in confidence, as will Bob, i'm sure.  If you prefer not to send this
information via email, perhaps you can come to the in person meeting, and
give me the information then.

I am willing to do quite a bit of legwork on this.  If it is most convenient
to meet you somewhere to obtain a copy of the citation and supporting materials,
i'll do it.  If you'd like to contact me by phone, my business number is
415.642.9791

Ideally, we'd like to get this information together by the end of the week,
so we can make a decision, and proceed apace.  It would be best if we can
obtain some contact information about /everyone/ who was cited, to obtain
the broadest array of facts, and present as unified a strategy as possible.

Thank you all for your time and patience.

Tonight was definitely in my top-5 most memorable evenings spent at 1015. 
(Keeping in mind that I work the main dance floor lights virtually EVERY 
Friday and Saturday, all night, and have for the past two years...that's 
pretty remarkable!)   I'm really feeling sad to lose this experience for 
the future. 


Here are people doing a club FOR THE PARTICIPANTS...not 
their money!!! (This was evidenced their charging NOT ONE DOLLAR for 
admission, even though there was a truly magnificent performance by 
DubTribe.   I didn't hear even a hint of dissent, except for the lack of 
opportunities to be Together again. 

*Bravo!!!!!* to all involved in this production.  Please come do us again 
soon!

 Given the recent discussion about NETCOM , I'd like to ask the list
in general if anyone offers INTERNET access services? Or knows of a
good INTERNET access service?

 Info needed:
 1) Monthly charge.
 2) Charge for memory usage.
 3) Other usage charges.
 4) Assuming the basic services ( email , newsgroups , ftp , telnet ),
    what other special services are available?
 5) Telephone area code(s)? ( I live in Sunnyvale , in the South Bay,
    so a service that's only in the 415 area is a toll call. However ,
    others may be interested , and I may be logging in from another 
    location other than the 408 area ).
 6) General opinion of the access provider ( please let me know if
    you're the owner or an employee !  :-)  )

 In fact - if you folks email me the information , I'll compile it
and post the resulting summary to sfraves/sfraves-planners.

To whoever is interested in such services ^^^:

While I don't know exactly what services he provides, I can speak for 
Sameer's (of sfraves and the Berkeley-Nexus) knowledgeability and 
sincerity.  Contact him (sameer@soda.berkeley.edu is one of his 20 
accounts I'm sure ;) if you are in the 510 area code.

Ok, I'm just going to post this because it's a fair deal:

The Duck Pond Public Unix
(408) 249-9630
4 lines, 14.4k modems
$10/month for 5 megs storage per day
$15/month for 10 megs storage per day
email, uucp, ftp, telnet, archie, lynx

There's no time limit per session, but you figure with 4 lines and 
currently 40 users, one should be curteous.  The sysadmin is fair and is 
always working on the system.  Just recently he upgraded modems and added 
a hunt group so you only need to dial one number.  Also newly installed 
is the lynx www browser and the pine mail program.  I've been on Quack 
for several months now and think it's a real good deal.  To get on you 
just dial up and login as "guest" for info, or you can  
http://quack.kfu.com to the home page.

Hello,

Just as an inquiry  (ie I am NOT advocating anything in particular) --

Is there any sort of policy or community_agreement on whether or not it is 
ethical to post information to sfraves that is " word of mouth only ; just 
tell your friends " ?

( Perhaps it depends on your definitions / interpretations ? )

 "Ethical" ? That's a heavy word - I'll pass on commenting weither an
ethical problem is involved.

 Dealing with a purely speculative , imaginary case - let's say someone
was holding a party , and they wanted to limit attendance for some
reason - maybe the site of the party is too small for a large crowd ,
maybe the party is supposed to be for the his friends and aquaintences
he's met in SFRaves , as well as other friends he knows. Then , this
fellow would be in his rights to request some limitation on the folks who
know about his party. That's my opinion. There's a difference between
a public party and a private party.

 Even public parties may want to limit the maximum size of the crowd , 
forsite and human comfort purposes, and other reasons. ( The FMR , for
 example ).

 For a can of worms - why use the term "ethical"? Ken , please expand
on this term in your inquiry.

Well I guess I should ponie up :)


	InterNex Information Services (of which I am part owner) offers
	SLIP/PPP access into the Internet via ISDN.  

	WE DO NOT OFFER SHELL ACCOUNTS BUT...  

	What other service provider can offer you Mosaic on your Mac or
	PC at 112kbps?  Basically we connect your MAC or PC directly to
	the Internet, you have your own domain name and receive mail
	directly to you home or company machine.  With the new
	residential ISDN tarrifs in effect you have unlimited calling
	between the hours of 5 pm and 8 am, it is $.01 per minute at
	other times.  Our rates start at $29/month (first 30 hours
	connect time included) and $2/hr above that.  The lowest cost
	ISDN board for a PC is around $500, this let's you connect at
	56 kbps. On the high end, and ascend router (smaller than a
	modem) cost arount $1500, but you get 112kbps and can hook up
	up to 254 different machines on your side, you could even run
	your own community ISP. This is the type of connection that
	nexsys.net (my home machine) has.  Starting in October, we will
	be offering frame-relay (dedicated 56k and above) connections.
	In addition to myself (Director of Network Operations) we have
	other ravers working here also.  If you want more info send a
	mail message to:

	info@internex.net

	or just email me.  

	SFravers who sign-up through me between now and September 15
	will get the first month of Internex' fees waived.
	(That's $29 + what ever you use for the first month)
	 (You have to e-mail me first to get this deal !)

Posting to sfraves is posting to a rather public place. One can ask
for discretion, but it's like putting flyers somewhere and asking for
discretion.

There have been some rumblings that law enforcement subscribes to this
list. Another thing to consider. Personally, I'd consider it unwise to
post complete directions to any renegade or break-in on here.  The
longer a location is known, the more coordination law enforcement can
make with other jurisdictions, etc. And one may not only jeapordize
their party, they may jeapordize all future parties. (For a fine
example, look at how the FMR folks have ruined more than one site for
all parties.)

I don't mind telling people how to thwart the law, because I feel law
enforcement has much better things to do than go around breaking up
parties. I.e. get a life, fight some crime.

Hey, Ken!

I think it really depends on the source. If you 
know the people/person who are/is hosting 
said event, then just ask them/him/her- would it be OK 
to post the info to SFRaves? If the event is to be held 
at an "illegal" site, or in a place where the police 
may very well make their presence felt, then give it 
lots of extra consideration before posting the info. 

Conversely, you could offer to send the info 
upon request; i.e., you tell the list you have some 
word of mouth info about an event, that you're hesitant to 
post it to the list, etc...., but that if someone's 
interested, then he/she should mail you personally for the info.
It's usually good to supply some teasers here, like a DJ list 
or general locale- say, Santa Cruz County or East Bay, etc...


Take care-

Jocelyn

I stocked up on invites at Mushroom Jazz and Together this week, so
now there's plenty of listings for your party needs.  Mushroom Jazz
is incredibly crowded nowadays, and Together has retired in to the
SFR Hall of Fame after over a year.  I can't think of a whole lot of 
weeklies which lasted over a year - Housing Project, Boogie Buffet,
Osmosis (?), Spundae, Mushroom Jazz, Carefree (?), Deep Space (?) - 
any others?

Thanks to all who sent info this week...

Hi, folks. As some of you may already have heard, Komotion was paid a visit
this morning by a member of the S.F. Fire Department. He cited numerous
fire code violations at the space and seems intent on shutting down
Komotion's live music and house parties indefinitely.

The fire marshal, one Lt. A.S. Armanda, apparently came in response to a
complaint from a patron of one of our recent events, claiming that the
building appeared to be unsafe. Although no one has come forward as the
complainant, it seems most likely that the call was made by someone at
Friends & Family 3, as that was the most heavily attended event at Komotion
in months.

At this point, we are calling an emergency meeting TONIGHT (Thursday) at 6
p.m. at the Komotion collective warehouse at 2779 16th Street (at Folsom).
Sfraves list members and anyone with an interest in or experience with
these issues are especially encouraged to attend.

As for the immediate implications of this information, it seems quite
likely that F&F IV is on hold until further notice.

Komotion has had a long and tenuous relationship with police and fire
authorities in its eight-year history. Visits from fire marshals are
nothing new, but with this visit the SFFD appears to have escalated its
threats. The marshal indicated that if we continue to produce in events
with an occupancy in excess of 49 PEOPLE, he will personally issue $270
citations to everyone in attendance.

I seem to recall that this $270-per-person allegation has come up before in
the SF rave community. I apologize for not reading or archiving this list
more carefully--Komotion just joined a couple of weeks ago--but I remember
seeing the "A $270 Party" thread. If anyone has any info or advice that
might be helpful, please your getting in touch and/or coming to our
meeting.

Lastly, on the off chance that the mysterious individual who made the
complaint to the authorities is a reader of this list, we would REALLY like
to hear from you and better understand your concerns. Your actions have
placed eight years of organizing of music and dance in jeopardy. Do you
really feel that unsafe?


En solidarite,

Boy, somedays you just can't get people to show up, and others you get
so many the gesta^H^H^H^H^Hfire marshall's office becomes involved.

Perhaps someone was genuinely concerned for the safety of the
attendees. Perhaps other motives are involved. If I were a competing
promoter and worried about losing $15-$20 a head to an F&F party,
complaining to the fire marshall would be a brilliant move.

Not that I know what really happened. Except maybe not enough payola
to grease the officials. Always comes down to money, doesn't it? Can't
even throw free parties anymore, because someone with a desk isn't
getting their cut.

SpaceHunt '94 resumes...

---------------------------

i would say that if the maker of the complaint doesn't make their
identity known, their motives could be considered suspect.

exactly what are the code violations and exactly how dangerous
are they in real terms?  if the violations are really dangerous
then someone did you a favor.  if not it could be political, sffd
and sfpd are both notorious...


see the thing in the weekly on the catholic church-sfpd connection?
interesting...

If the Space Engineers of the Blue Cube *really* want to impress us,
perhaps they will think about the Digital Noise Cancellation System
which will rocket them into heroic orbit in the mythos of the world
rave community!

I mean, you could actually do it . . . you can buy noise-cancelling
earphones NOW and I don't imagine the circuits are that hard to
reverse engineer . . .

So you put the speakers for the DNCS outside the Space With Da Tumps,
turn it on (prolly runs on a Sparc II or maybe some fancee DSP stuff),
and voila!  No complaints from the neighbors or visits from the Fire
Marshal!

Seems to me that you should be able to find out the specific nature of
the complaint, if not the name of the complainant.  In most places
(certainly in Portland) you can work things out with the Fire Marshal
assigned to your area if you address things in a businesslike way and
give them some room to maneuver and satisfy the requirements of their
bureaucracies.  If you have one who's simply got it in for you, nothing
you do will satisfy them and you should plan now to follow an appeals
route.  

I don't feel that F&F3 was run in an unsafe manner, mostly because 
I had complete confidence in the ability of those running the event to
deal with any problems that developed, both our crew and the Komotion
staff on hand.  I think you can advance with confidence knowing that
is your situation.

I've looked into this in depth, and unfortunately it's just too
difficult. To make it work, one would have to generate phase inverted
sound waves in a dispersion pattern that exactly matches that of the
sound leaving the house. If the dispersion pattern doesn't match
exactly, the interference causes the waves to cancel at some
locations and add up at others. At some locations it will be quiet,
and others it will be louder what than one started with.

It works with headphones because one is working with a small area
where the the sound dispersion is easy to duplicate. It's much easier
to cancel sound coming in than sound going out. 

One possibility might be to couple subwoofers to the walls and use
them to cancel the shake caused by the music. I don't know what it
might do for the acoustics inside, but it might reduce the amount of
bass transmitted outside. Wonder if it's been tried?

Just imagine if one could do it. Total stealth parties :).

Upon learning that it was Jon Howard the was spinning Eric B and Rakim

Part of the problem is the fact that certain parts of the government are
getting paid to *deal* drugs, while other parts are getting paid to lock
users and dealers up.  There is an enormous subculture in the intelligence
and policing agencies involved in the trafficking of hard drugs, especially
cocaine (bush and is buddy Oliver North were apparently raking  in the cash

---------------------------------

I heard the prison "industry" was the fastest growing "industry" in
California, so I think the point is that certain folks in the "prison
industry" want a cut of that 400,000.00!!  Like you said it's all
about money and these people want money more than they want you to
keep your rights.  Whether America survives or not (IMHO) in the long
term depends on whether we can pry these people's cold dead fingers
from the reins of power and it ain't going to be easy...

Thursday night here in the Berkeley hills was an XL Store house
party.  Hip Hop djs and free refreshments.  I have been feeling  
a bit slow - but I dropped by.

I wish we could expand our party listings to 
include more Hip Hop stuff.  I haven't clued in to any
after-hours, cheap, warehouse feeling, Good parties of this
sort in a long time.  It seems hard to believe they aren't
going off somewhere in the City ...

This Saturday Night seems loaded with the cheapo/free parties.
Any thoughts on Tribal Funk vs THC?

I've never heard of THC.  I have been to one nice Tribal Funk
party.  I'm in the mood for some freaky shit!

     The best place to hear John play this type of music is at the Boogie
Buffet on Sunday mornings at 1015 Folsom.  He will also be playing at the
Groove Kitchen on 9-3 with Mark Farina and Markie which will be kickin'!!!

whoa....now the whole story comes out....1015 was being bothered by the 
police  a few months back because catholic charities was trying to put up
low income housing next door...i suppose this was the incident *i 
think comeunity may 4th?* where they took the mixer and stopped the party 
early...

taken from the sf weekely aug 24, 94 p. 7

"The muscle of the Catholic Church--when backed by the police--has also 
been felt on the streets, as Ira Sandler, owner of the popular gay 
nightclub 1015 folsom, knows well.  Catholic Charities had submitted a 
plan to put up low-income housing next to the club, and when Sandler 
officially complained this year, fearing there would be too many 
conflicts with the residents, a police offical declared at a public 
meeeting that he was going to shut down the club.

'The cops didn't have anything on 1015 Folsom, but they told Ira he 
better settle with the Church or else,' said Sandler's attorney Mark 
Rennie.

'It was definitely the police siding with the Church over a nightclub 
owner.  The whole thing stunk to high heaven."

IMHO, this is why rave mass and all of its rhetoric scares the daylights 
out of me...i realize that party is going to be episcapal and not 
catholic but still some of the same ideology/control/power religious 
junk/stuff prevails...

Speaking about drugs, we must look back to sf history and learn that 
one can contribute the end to phrohibition IMHO directly to the catholics 
and jews who were allowed to make wine for religious uses...amazing what 
political power can do....

also what about oliver stone conspiracy theory #666 that the Irish 
Republican Army sells e to support their cause *religious/homeland*

crazy thing this religious political power stuff...susie (:

Since hate, fear, finger pointing, and denial of responsibility are so
deeply engrained in our society, I don't think the basic ideological changes
needed are going to come for hundreds of years at least. There are
groups with sound reasoning, but they are outnumbered by our fast
breeding spoon fed philosophy majority.

What we will probably see is relief in the form of practiciality. When
1 out of 5 people are in prison, the economics of the thing will start
to become apparent to even the most thick-headed. When people's share
of the enforcement burden gets painful enough, they'll press for
reform.

Thus reform will be driven essentially by evolution, and not
enlightened choice (the cold war was a good example). I don't think it
will take *that* long though, as people are already starting to feel
the crunch.

A friend of mine, a psychobiology major, said it well when writing to
a university administrator who had been applying pressure on him for 
providing educational drug information:

    "... tried to convince me of the brainwashed misinformation that
    alcohol (for example) is inherently "better" than marijuana (for
    example) simply BECAUSE IT IS LEGAL. I'm sorry, but legal
    scheduling is irrelevant to the laws of chemistry and
    pharmacology. Criminalizing something doesn't make it a poison and
    legalizing it doesn't make it good for you. I find it hard to
    believe that, were caffeine criminalized tomorrow, the University
    would take the position that it's a terrible drug that destroys
    lives and kills millions of people each year. However, that seems
    to be the brainwashed, propagandized position taken by so many
    people against other drugs based solely on the fact that they've
    received an illicit status."
                                  
So hang in there, and keep yelling. My biggest suggestion to people
fed up with the way things are: Find ways to communicate your ideas
effectively. Doing it online is a good start. Since most people aren't
online, find ways to reach them too.

For those people distributing information at raves, keep it up. I am
finding that a lot of people actually read and remember the
information. It's working!

I believe I know about the guy Matthew Fox that puts the rave "masses" on...
He was silenced by the Catholic Church for being TOO liberal.. really 
cool guy I'm told...  so I wouldn't worry about him.. he's spent his
whole life fighting the Papacy... finally gave up and becam Episcopalian...

I've heard this one before. Of course artificially induced paranoia is a
great source of some truly imaginative conspiracy theories....OK, so maybe
there are some Irish promoters and lots of policeman really are Irish and
some parties never get busted.  So why do these Catholic and thus one would
think, IRA-sympathetic cops want to shut down a club that some might claim is
a source of IRA support? Or maybe it's not...And where does the House of
Pain/Cypress Hill link fit into all this?

Never take me seriously unless you want to,

There's actually a lot more to that story.  I think there's a thread 
about this on alt.drugs right now.  Baseline being that for the first 
time in a couple of years, the quality of Ecstasy in Northern Ireland 
clubs is very high, and this has been leading to much more peaceful 
coexistance and lowered tensions in the area.  The IRA has been linked to 
the rise in supply, to the point of strong-arm tactics to chase the bunk E 
dealers out of the Irish clubs.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello again, sfraves. Thanks to all list members who have sent suggestions
and messages of support as we sort through this mess.

First a clarification: so far, no one at Komotion has been cited for any
code violations. At the time of Lieutenant Armada's visit on Thursday
morning, the space was empty. Hence, no public assembly was taking place,
and no violation was actually witnessed.

The inspector did make quite clear, however, that in his opinion, Komotion
is unsafe for public assemblies of ANY shape or size, and cited specific
requirements which must be met before lawful gatherings can take place:

   -- chemical flameproofing of all curtains, carpets, acoustical tiles or
      other flammable materials hanging from the walls;

   -- a thorough clearing out of debris from doorways, corners, bathrooms and   
      the adjacent alley which serves as a fire exit;

   -- acquisition of new trash cans equipped with lids, and made of some
      non-combustible material;

   -- overhaul of all electrical wiring, including the entire sound and
      lighting system, to be supervised by a licensed electrician;

As soon as these basic conditions are met, we can schedule a re-inspection
of the facility by Lt. Armada himself, at which point our right to public
assembly will be reconsidered. In the meantime, we are expressly forbidden
from booking shows, parties, readings or gatherings of any kind.

For the most part, these are basic housekeeping concerns, certainly long
overdue, and as such we do not dispute them. (Some of it sounds a little
weird - like the wall hanging business - but still easily accommodated). We
expect to have most of the major renovation done within the next couple of
days, albeit at some expense. An electrician friend-of-a-friend has agreed
to sign off on the wire repairs. In addition to the trash pickup, we've
decided to repaint the entire building, in order to give the space more of
a clean, orderly appearance.

Of more serious concern is the inspector's estimate of the maximum legal
occupancy for the building. Armada indicated that even after the above
repairs are completed, we are still only authorized to produce events with
an attendance of 49 PERSONS OR LESS. This figure is the bare minimum for
meeting halls, parties in private homes, and other gatherings not requiring
a permit.

If enforced, this limit would spell death for rave/house parties at
Komotion, as well as make it nearly impossible for us to pay our rent as a
benefit promoter booking six to eight events for month.

At this point, our next step has been to consult an lawyer to clarify our
rights and responsibilities. We have made an appointment through S.F.
Lawyer Referral with an attorney specializing in building and fire codes.
With his help, we may be able to ascertain the basic modifications
necessary to get our occupancy raised to at least 99--still a bit tight,
but a significant improvement. Till then, all our future events, including
F&F IV and YSH, are on hold.

We realize that to some of you, Komotion may be just another room to rave.
To us and our supporters, it is a unique and vital non-profit community
resource serving artists and activists of all colors and persuasions. Some
of us have invested much of our adult lives in building a music and dance
environment that inspires, informs and breaks down borders.

Well, that's the news. Once again, we at Komotion would like to thank
everyone in the sfraves community, and the Friends & Family crew in
particular, for everything they've done to make this relationship work. I
hope we'll get the chance to work together again in the future.

One more thing. After rereading my original "ACHTUNG!" post in light of
comments made by Marty (MVasey@eworld.com), I want to apologize to anyone
who may have been put off by the tone of that message. If my words seemed
to assign some sort of "blame" on sfr for recent events, the effect was
wholly unintentional. We do not wish to alienate you or anyone else.
Sfraves and Friends & Family have introduced us to a new and vibrant
subculture full of good people, positive energy and much to teach us all.
Let's hope we can keep it going.


En solidarite,

Here's a question:

The people density at 1015 the last time I was there was comparable
with that at Komotion the last time I was there.  What did or does 1015
do to get permission to pack people in for events?  

I'm just asking because maybe it would help Judge et. al. work things out.

As I understand it, the main structural difference between us and, say, 
1015 is the lack of a rear exit. The wall behind Komotion's stage is 
right up against that of the next building; hence no room for exits.

One possible option is knocking out a doorway through the west wall that 
opens onto the adjoining alley, but that could take $$$ and our landlord 
is not obligated to pay for it...

HI. I"m mikebee. some of you know me. I am moving out to SF this week 
with John Shiple (Handi-Boy :) ) and we may need a place to stay for a 
few days and possibly a week...so we thought we'd ask all the people we 
knew for crash space, so as to save us as much money as possible. :), and 
SFraves is a perfect place to do it all at once. (i apologize for the 
lack of rave-related content here)
so..if you have space and are willing to take in two eager-to-please east 
coast ravers who will do anything you ask, write me at the address below. :)
THANKS

I'd guess it's the possibility of a smoker accidentally igniting a
curtain or wall hanging. I seem to remember something like this
starting the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire.

I do agree that the main room needs a second exit. I suppose that even
if seriously inconvenienced, some good will come of it.

If any of us can help, please let us know.

If you're going to Lollapalooza, be sure to check out the Electric Carnival!
It's the big white tent in the Shoreline Ampitheater parking lot with blue
red and yellow dots on it, like a bag of Wonder Bread.  Not only is it 
professionally air conditioned, with its own set of industrial strength
diesel generators, but it's also packed full of hands-on interactive media!
It's really a big experiment sponsored by Paul Allen's Interval Research,
that's touring around with the concert. They've put together a whole bunch of
interactive exhibits, with facilitators to help people use them, and they're
video taping how people interact, and interviewing people to find out what
they think of the stuff. 

I'll be facilitating multi player SimCity running on an SGI Indigo and an
NCD X terminal in a couple of kiosks, which is a product I developed for X11.
As a special offer to sfrave subscribers, if you mention the name of this
mailing list, I'll show you the secret undocumented cellular automata screen
saver, which is especially good if you're on drugs, so come prepared and share! 

There's also something called the Midi Zoo, where you can see and hear Bounce,
another project I'm hacking on with David Levitt. Bounce is a visual data flow
programming language, for creating real time simulations with midi, macromind
director graphics, networking, and all kinds of esoteric i/o devices like data
gloves and convolvotrons (it was originally called "body electric", and was
developed by VPL for virtual reality programming, and David and I are
developing it into a product for implementing interactive multimedia).
Bounce is hooked up to a bunch of bizarre midi stuff like synthesizers, 
keyboards, drum pads, slider boxes, a midi controlled mixer, a vocalizer that
shifts the pitch of your voice and harmonizes in barbershop quartet, a jam man
that loops and layers sounds, and other stuff I couldn't begin to describe.
It's the big noisy mess of cables in one of the lion cages, you can't miss it. 

There will of course be a network connection, and lots of world wide webbing 
and stuff like that. I'm not supposed to give out the official web address
yet, but you might be able to guess. I've assembled some media I recorded at
the Lollapalooza show in Colorado, and some info about simcity and bounce,

PPS: And here's a summary of some recent news coverage from earlier this month.
John Markov wrote a good article on it, I think. 

PAUL ALLEN'S ELECTRIC CARNIVAL
        Paul Allen, Microsoft's other co-founder, is financing a $2 million
traveling technology exhibit as part of the Lollapalooza tour.
Concert-goers can take time out to play with computerized toys that turn
their voices into alien sounds or manipulate their images digitally to see
what offspring might look like. Meanwhile, Allen's company, Interval
Research Corp., is taking notes on what attracts the sub-Generation X
crowd, seeking hints on what might be the Next Big Thing in consumer
electronics. (New York Times 8/5/94 C1)

Yeah, you're probably right. But how do art galleries get around this? 
I've definitely been to some pretty smoky spaces with plenty of canvas 
hanging around, and I don't ever recall seeing a 'certificate of 
inflammability' hanging from anything. 

As for the curtains, they're in the main room, where smoking is not allowed.

We have $500 in the bank. If done by a contractor with a permit, adding 
another exit to the main room could cost as much as $10,000. Considering 
the fact that we may not be able to have large shows until the exit is 
already in place, that money could prove very difficult to raise.

Serious inconvenience indeed. We may never know what good could 
theoretically come from such a feat.

> If any of us can help, please let us know.

Thanks. Right now we've got the painting, the flameproofing and the 
electrical work covered. We're taking down the lighting system for now, 
as it's just too messy to bring up to code. When it comes time to put in 
a new, legal one, I'm sure we could use all the help and advice we can get.

It's obivious that Komotion will require some serious money to really get 
sorted out properly. This does pose a challenge, but not one that we 
can't overcome.

One avenue to explore would be to seek grant money to fund the needed 
improvements to the building as well as paying for appopriate legal 
representation to deal with the bureaucratic/politcal aspect of things.

I would be intersted in investing more energy in helping find solutions to 
some of these problems when I return to the Bay Area next week

Hopefully we can all learn from these challenges and become stronger in 
our projects of transformation and liberation.

Will Be In touch.

I picked up the vinyl double-pack today.  Looks like it has the same cuts
as the import CD (I didn't see the US release), though in a slightly
different order.  

On first listening it doesn't have any obvious "classic" tracks like Chime
or Halcyon or you-name-it, but it's worth a serious listen and is high
quality work (as always with the Hartnolls).  What I really like about
Orbital is that P&P don't merely drop their melodic ideas into different
'genres' (as listening to any random release these days with the obligatory
"radio mix," "club mix," "trance mix" and so forth shows), but they *adapt*
those genres to an overall musical conception.  Which is why it was a bit
amusing to read from some quarters that Snivilisation is 'a bit ambient'
or 'has breakbeats!' or 'is aimed at the commercial market' or various
other things I've read -- all true, to be sure, but sort of missing the
point.  

The other thing I like is that Orbital never stand still.  They could have
just relaxed into the fantastic groove they found in the 'brown album' --
surely a classic effort overall.  Snivilisation goes in all different
directions.  

c u in the future

Yes Tony, I empathize with you completely.

There was a clip with Prez. Clinton speaking to a group of teenagers on TV
a few days ago. I think it was actually footage from back during the 
campaign, but the drug thing is hot in the media right now... anyway,
he said something like the following:

"You know, my brother was arrested for possession of cocaine awhile back
and he did 14 months in prison, and then went into rehab. I'm glad it happened,
because if it didn't; I'm sure he'd never have gone into rehab and he'd
probably be dead by now."

<flame on>
So what, Bill? So you've got it so together, that you can be president of the
United States, and you can't even help your own brother with his drug problem?
It's the responsibility of the police to arrest your brother, so that he can
be helped with his drug problem? Would he be dead from doing coke, or dead
from dealing with the wrong people; people he would never have seen were
the substance legal. Is jail supposed to be healthier than getting high?
<flame off>

You can see what I'm getting at.

This kind of thinking is especially scary to me, because it reminds me very
strongly of the kind of thinking I'd hear from my own and my friends' parents
when I was a teenager, and by extension perhaps reflects the thinking of a
large portion of the people that support the WOD. People are so hysterical 
about drugs, they feel like they need police to deal with their own relatives.
This is irrational panic fueled by fear of the unknown.

This is why the need for *education* about the real effects, dangers and 
potential rewards of various drugs is so great, IMHO. Knowledge tends to dispel
fear, and replace panic with rational assessment. Obviously, there *is* the
potential of negative effects of varying severity with different substances,
but if this information is made available, and a substance is available in 
known quantity and purity, the risks are minimized. Say if the FDA controlled
drugs instead of the DEA.

At least there has been some of what I would call non-hysterical presentation
of the issue recently in the media (at least on MTV, which isn't much from
the standpoint of political influence, but at least it's national media).
There still seems to be a real lack of agreement about physiological effects
from long term and casual use of various schedule 1 substances.

Anyway, I guess the point is that I don't see how drug use can be treated
as anything but a health issue. There is simply no justification for turning
it into a crime.

Did anyone attend this party?  I was there and had a helluva time 
spazzing out to some great music.  The space it was in was great!  Large 
ceiling warehouse with hardwood floors that really had some BOUNCE.   

Four turntables as promised, but only two being needed.  Visuals... well 
not much but I would have to say I didn't care because people were into 
the dancing thing and that made me happy. 

Lots of SPACE to move around too!  Bongo drummers in the far end for that 
boonga beat... only ONE bathroom for everyone and it was kept pretty clean
 somehow.  I found it difficult to wait in line for the bathroom while 
the "ribbit" song was going off and the crowd was going crazy.. dancing in 
line was painful yet necessary :)

An interesting thing with this setup was the main speakers were placed 
far away from the dj.  Only a smallish (yet loud) monitor type speaker 
was in front of the dj table for people up front.  it was strange to see 
larger crowds forming _away_ from the dj in front of the big speakers.  
but it was definitely a better distrbution of sound for this space giving 
more room for everyone to move.

Thank you Bryce for getting the information together and hosting this

For ANYONE who was at Oyster Bay and has not contacted Bryce about it
yet, DO SO NOW... $270 is harsh, but it is more than just the money.

I can't speak for everyone, but in my experience so far DJing the
further away the main system the easier it is to mix. F&FIII was a
real education in this respect. The main system was booming in over
the monitors, so I crank up the monitors, then my headphones can't get
loud enough to hear over the monitors! (why do some DJs tilt their head
to one side? to compress the earphone against their ear...). It was a
lot of work sorting out all the sounds, but something that should get
better with experience. I'll probably think about having some extra
headphone amplification available for those mixers that don't put out
a lot.

I am a fan of booming monitors at the DJ booth so people can jam right
there with the DJ. I also love a lot of DJ<->crowd interaction, as
it's just plain fun. I think that was the best part of spinning at
F&FIII, having my friends right there in my face and throwing that
energy back and forth. Whew!

I've heard of this before on badly loaded sendmail systems. Either a
race condition or timeouts of the locks. I can imagine this happening
on a system with 30,000 users and one machine receiving all the
inbound mail. I'm curious to know how they plan to fix it.

All I can say is the president is obviously saying this in part to keep 
his public opinion up.  This country is in a "drug scare" that is almost 
as bad as the "red scare" of the 1950's.  And it is really sad, because I 
have met so many people out there that have so many misconceptions about 
drugs.  Look what happened when the surgeon general just hinted about the 
legalization of drugs.  I was afraid she was going to get the can.  There 
are no politicians that I know of out there that will even touch the 
subject of drugs unless they come out against them, because that is a 
sure-fire plan these days.  "stamp out drugs, stamp out crime, stamp out 
illegal activities".  It makes me angry.  When is this country going to 
grow up and pay attention to the real issues?

A couple of reviews -

After wasting free passes for 1015 Folsom on some huge 
oldies office party I wound up with House music for $8
at the End Up last Friday night (a week ago).
I can't remember the official name but there was a big
"dance til ya drop" or some such banner out front.
Amusing people looking for FMR info from the doormen.
The music was good.  Fairly hard with a dash of 
diva to lighten it up.  Male strippers (sporting the
ever fashionable Tom Cruise in Diapers look) were an
added bonus.  Go with friends if you want to avoid flirting.
We were committed to boogie because a friend of a
friend and fellow dancing fool died of an overdose.
I would say the evening worked out great.
People.  Moving.  Keep your head On.

Tribal Funk this Saturday was $5 and in Oakland.  I knew I 
couldn't stay out late but I was buggy from a cold and too
much time at home so I went for awhile.  Small place, medium 
enthusiasm crowd, and the music was heavy rotation funky house.  
It was not a party that fit my mood, I guess.

        Brief message to those people who were at the Oyster Bay Liquid Leo...

        The citation you received was a MISDEMEANOR, which is more serious
than a parking ticket.  As Mike wrote, it's about more than simply coming
up with $270 -- it's a permenant record that you have to contend with.  I
encourage all who have not yet contacted Bryce or placed themselves on the
oyster-gate@ultima.org list to do so immediately.  A collective response is
being organized, and details are available from these sources.  The public
nature of this list prevents us from discussing this any further.

Hi--

I'm taking advantage of posting my last to sfraves
for awhile by thanking those who came to and contributed
so much to my GAP on Saturday and Sunday:

Bryce for the Liquid Sound System which he didn't even
get a chance to spin on himself, except at the opening
set up time

Allen of ameba for rescuing us from our unplugged phase,
which because of his magick lasted only about an hour, for
spinning the most excellent seven or so hours heard anywhere
(Craig has made audio/video copies for me which we are all
welcome to copy!)--it would have been excellent no matter 
how long or short the time was!  Have *you* heard this guy spin?

Craig for the video projection *balls* that glowed all night
with his particular brand of computer-videography magick (again,
the audio-video record is now in the Penna archives!)

Laura for spinning a kicka** set that got us all going and if
that weren't enough her mere (*mere*?!) presence at the party
upped the energy and consciousness quotients a buzzillion points!

Ethan nrg Miller for the flamin' set that brought the law down,
but kept the party going until that magick tyme in Sanity Cruise
when all cords must be unplugged (around midnight), so we could
talk, communing with each other and with nature until Allen showed
us a way to plug in again

deepfog (Tony V Garcia) for doing a tremendous starter set that 
not only warmed us up but heated us to the quantum level we needed
to keep on our feet until midnight and beyond.  Keep this man in
mind for *your* next party!

jason d (Jason Davis--Robert Ernest's account on e-mail here) for
his seamless set that just kept flowing so endlessly thatI didn't
separate the records' bpm from my own (the rave equivalent of not
being able to separate the dance from the dancer). *This* is another
up-and-comer in our dj world to keep in mind! Yow!!!

Larry for being the beautiful man he always is, showing up late,
leaving late, making sure everything and everybody were a-okay!  It's
*always* a special energy when Larry is there, n'est-ce pas? A
buzzillion tahnks and loads of quantum karma, Larry!

Susan (No, I won't be spinning) Kamany (opps! I misspelled your
surname?!) for being there--which is an ingredient more important
than it sounds unless you've *been there* with Susan!

I *know* I've forgotten *someone* with direct or indirect sfr
connections, so *please* post me to amend this, any of you who
are more prescient than I right now!  Please note my new Marin
county phone number as of Sept. 2 below.  I'll still be reachable
personally at my e-mail address below, but after tomorrow I won't
be on sfraves for awhile.  It's Peru in October - November and
India, etc., later in the winter.  Any tips any of you have I'll
welcome!

Bless you/us all!
Namaste,

will

And what about Naomi?  BTW, what *is* the Cyprus Hill
connection?  House of pain can claim Irish, (and with
the visible stereotypes I'm not arguing... I'm Irish
too, but wouldn't want to be associated with them...;-),
but Cyprus Hill?  To my knowledge there not Irish, not
police, probably rave friendly, and much much cooler than
house of "I'm bad, honest I am!"...

-----------------

you *are* oblidged to provide safe exit in case of a fire, and
this is not play-land, burn units are *ugly*.  if this is the basis
of the fire marshall's complaint, and if they'd get off your back
for putting in a fire exit, you'd probably be best off to do it.
perhaps you could renegotiate your contract if you put in the door
and get a break since you're improving the building...

David's assessment of Tribal Funk seems pretty accurate, though he
clearly didn't stay to the end.
The site was an old abandoned night club, in some ways ideal - except
that there was only one WC!
To keep a VERY low profile, there were no in's and out's (which made
sense this time) and no one allowed in after 2 am (normal bar closing
time).
Jazz E was a no show, so DJ Utopia from Redding spun instead between 1
and 2:45 - this must have been when David was there, it was a good set,
but pretty standard house fare.
At 2:45 Tony came on and minutes later the Oakland Police arrived. :-(
The overhead spinning color light was taken down at that time - I'm not
sure if that was Tony's request or due to the police visit :-).
The police looked everything over, especially the display for Cloud
Nine, complete with neon light and full color brochures - I guess they
figured out that illicit substances don't have ads. :-)
While this was going on, the main speakers failed, but people continued
to dance, seemingly unaware, just to the sound from the (rather large)
DJ monitors.  When this was fixed, it produced the biggest positive
reaction of the evening :-).
Minutes later, the promoters stopped everything to announce that the
cops had to shut it down because they didn't have a permit - BUT, they
were going to allow them to continue to 4 am anyway (about 35-40 minutes
more).
So, Tony played another 20 minutes of tribally trancey sounds, followed
by only 20 minutes for Josh, who finished with "We Are Family" with
everyone holding hands in the air.
I think that there's an advantage in being in Oakland; the cops were
probably relieved that there were no weapons, alcohol or overt drug use
and so probably said to themselves "they're good kids, let's give them a
few more minutes".  Whereas in small-town-suburbia, they would have said
"what bad kids, wildly dancing to weird loud music, we better stop it
now." (Santa Cruz, perhaps?).
The one major downer was SO MUCH smoke in the air - maybe smoking is
more hip in the East Bay?  I can understand why the Captain is looking
for mostly outdoors events now (he also hates the smoke).
I wish smoking would some day become un-cool!  (fat chance)

Damn, I wholeheartedly agree.  There's NOTHING that pisses me off more
when dancing, (and its really HARD to piss me off then :), than people
holding lit cigarettes on the dance floor... taking a drag every couple of
minutes... and letting the smoke waft over to me. Shit! Go sit down...
smoke the damned cigareete and THEN come to the dance floor!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Think we can get some T-Shirts made " SMOKE 'EM, DON'T HOLD 'EM"....

There were a LOT of people out at Sunset again this week.  Or maybe it just
seemed like more than usual...'cause they were yellin' & clappin' so much;
SOMEBODY went out a bunch this weekend!  (*sigh* not me...hadda work)

Lotsa folks were passing out flyers for the upcoming Labor Day weekend. Wow.
Is it really the end of summer?  :(

The dj played the ribbity song.  Everybody yelled a little more than usual
when they heard it start, which was fun.

Custom of the Sunset party:  stand on the top of the hill & watch the sun
slide down behind the mountains across the water.  Cheer!

enjoy & lots love,

Hiya!

Spun can scratch, but I don't know if the scratches 
on his CD can be attributed to him. I would be 
willing to bet that some, but certainly not all, 
of the scratching is his doing. 

In the interest of DJ history- Spun was a hip hop 
DJ before he was a rave DJ- in the mid to late 
eighties? 

Out & about-

Just a little FYI:

Lately in ba.mountain-folk there's been a discussion about
the practices/policies of CAMP (Citizens Against 
Marijuana Planting). Apparently, they fly their 
helicopters very low over the SC mountains. Someone said 
that they weren't allowed to fly below 1000 ft, though 
they've been spotted at ~300ft. Guess what- they're 
main benefactor is Anhauser Busch! 

Somebody ought to plant a Busch beer garden for them 
to photograph!

Also noted- government agencies selling aerial view 
photos of personal property door-to-door.

"Hi! We thought you might like these since we can't use 
them against you..."

Take care-

------------------
while i had a great time at together, i had a short-lived bummer when i
actually got sexually harassed by some guy in a cheesy turtleneck 
shirt/sweater...having been familiar w/ gay dance clubs for a long
time (79?), i was surprised at the brazen (?!) attitude this guy had.
i'm dancing away, probably w/ a really dumb look on my face (my initial
impression was that the perpetrator thought I was too high to defend
myself...not!) when this hand came swingin' down around toward me butt!
at the last second i noticed this and grabbed the wrist just prior to 
contact.  i gave the guy a look like "oh no you don't!" and let go, 
thinking that this was over...next, he came dancing over and gyrates
by me, intentionally bumping into me and kinda reaching near, but not
actually grabbing this time...so i moved away slightly to give him
more room...he follows me and it becomes obvious that this is intentional.
for the next several minutes every time i think that i've managed to
survive the episode, dude comes over and either bumps or brushes up
against me or starts reachin' fo shit again...finally he tries to put his
hand on my waist or near there and i have to grab him by both shoulders and
firmly say "dude!  get off my tip!!!   ok?!?!?"  i let go and he starts
clucking to his friends acting like I'm harassing him!!!  after i physically
made it clear that i would accept no more, he quit, but I had to go to
that length...it was wierd and tho i'm not damaged by it, it further
underscores what women have told me for years about dealing w/ pushy men.
the part that really got me was how indignant he got when he couldn't get 
his way, truly amazing.  dude was *not* a raver, as far as I could tell.

however, 15-20 mins later, it was history, forgotten till the comment
above reminded me.  that was an amazing party, this little eye opener
not withstanding...I gotta check out jon howard more...

Get their tail number and report the violation the FAA. Federal regs
require civilian aircraft to fly a minimum of 500' over uninhabited
areas and 1000' over inhabited ones except during takeoff and landing.
If more than one person calls, it will be taken quite seriously.

There also may be violation of privacy issues involved. It's one thing
to take pictures from the air. It's another to take close ups. Someone
with a fence or a wooded property has a reasonable expectation of
privacy.

Fight back!

As a contributor to the smoke at Tribal Funk I thought
I would comment -

In an indoor space I always try and be considerate to
the people in the main dance area.  This area is usually
hot and crowded.  I will find more room.

However, at TF they were blasting a fog machine a good deal 
of time I was there.  When this is happening I smoke wherever. 
I almost feel obligated to do so.  Obviously somebody made
an effort to get smoke into the room - I'm just helping out.

The promoters are not naive.  
I am sure they consider this.

Well, House of Pain owes a lot of their sound to DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill.
 Look for the name Soul Assasins for Muggs produced stuff.  I was going to
babble on about some connection between this Irish/IRA/E  (House of Pain) and
the Mexican mafia/Chicano gangs/HEMP/Chiba (Cypress Hill.)  Catholicism being
the link between these two.  The point is that you can take various racial,
cultural and religious groupings/stereotypes and mix 'em up into crazy
conspiracy theories and  Cypress/H.oP. play with this imagery themselves.  Of
course I just came up with this point about a second ago...

Yeah,
	I must say that some men  don't seem to know when to quit,
It also underscores that gay men are still MEN (In that they think they have
a right to finger/paw you just because their dick is hard).  I've had my
ass grabbed by complete strangers in clubs, even after I made it know that I 
didn't want the attention. I even had to push this guys once (which is not my
style) to get him to leave me alone.

Fog smoke isn't carcinogenic and vasoconstrictive, and doesn't make my
sinuses feel like someone is driving nails into my head right between
my eyes. It doesn't stink, either.

Tobacco sucks.

Mijos! Sunset has been consistantly my favourite party. Outdoors, bay-view,

smiles, dancing, talking, lounging, fruit, bubbles, energy, rest, no busts,
free, long,  Galen et al.

Seems like a perfect world, everyone with mats and blankets, water and
toys. The 21 and ups, the younger crowds, so much innocence, so many
smiles, knowing nods,  such exchange of love. Even if your weekend has
drained you, this is the place to recharge, or spend what's left of your
energy. 

Obviously, I had a wonderful,playful day. Love to all, beeeeee happy!

Also, FYI, Ultima.Org, and by extension, the oyster-gate mailing list, have

The problems should be repaired shortly.  At this time, the list is

(hello everyone, I finally got back on)

(Pullman was great)

anyway, I just glanced and read something to effect that smoke machines
weren't as bad as cigarettes..I dunno.  I don't smoke, but I really
hate smoke machines.  how many of us have left a party imagining our 
lungs coated with the smoke machine crap coated on our shoes?

I hate smoke machines.  I don't care if Rosco and all of those heads make
supposedly safe smoke machines, they still stink (pina colada flavor not
withstanding) and I don't know how they can be much better than cigaret
smoke...
at least with cigarets you can run.  It seems that a lot of the smoke machine
operators out there just want to completely gas the crowd...it sucks,
especially in small places..

just my non cents...

see ya all at Groove Kitzch and probably Spundaes..

(have a good week)

That would be the cut "sandals", by feet or vice versa (or something
like that)...they have it at star alley in linden alley (near hayes &
franklin).  it's got several mixes, one by folks that you guys mention
alot, the hardkisses, which i think is the "frog mix" (i might be wrong).
i also discovered that the hardkisses use the same studio I use (Jam
Studio - Markus, don't say I never did nuttin' fo ya, Internat'l adverts
right here, bro) as I noticed this 12" on the wall next to mine...does
anyone have a discog of the hardkiss output?  i've run into 'em enough
i'm getting curious...as well as being interested in hearing what they
have done at Jam since i'm using most of the same gear but making totally
different music...

-----------------------------------------------
some of it sounds like he did it because of differences in the fidelity
of the scratches, i.e. some of the scratching is really clear and up front
while other scratches are more muffled/buried in the mix/sound like more
recording generations, etc.  it also sounded like jon howard was cutting
live at together (godDAMN that was the shit!), which set my blood to
boilin', it sucks if the dj is just doing tricks (or it *can* anyway),
but the art of scratch is a serious musical innovation in the right hands.

i never heard about him back then, but i usta groove to doc martin at
the firehouse 7 (16th st., SF) back when he was spinnin' shit like
"life is..." and "dopeman", etc.  doc has some serious skills and is the
1st house/rave/etc. dj I got into (I had written house off as slap-
together-bar-music prior to hearing doc spin some of the heavily
percussive stuff he used to spin at townsend when he was there alot).
now i'm feeling a tilt back to da funk, and i must say, i ain't
complainin'...

I agree, tobacco sucks (i am a non-smoker). Fog machines also suck, even
though visually appealing :).

I have no problem with people smoking in open outdoor areas and i suppose i
wouldn't  have a problem with a fog machine in an open outdoor area either.
but smoking and/or fog machines in a closed small area with lots of hot
dancing people is a bad idea.

peace,
marty


 Am i the only other person out there who doesn't  like fog machines?

This has been a very interresting topic of mine as of lately.  I'm a big
advocate of inclusion and mix groups.  I feel it is the only way to disarm
prejudice and intollerance, be it color, age, sex and orientation.  I
sometimes wonder what is appropriate behavior when you find yourself having
a sexual advance made to you by a person of the same sex (or opposite sex)
if you are of different orientation?

>i was surprised at the brazen (?!) attitude this guy had.
(read Tenderloin Waxx's posting "Re: reviews" for complete details).

>From your posting it sounds like you were bothered primarily because this
guy would not give up and that he became indignant he couldn't get his own
way.  Maybe because of the way you detailed quite graphically your
encounter makes me believe that you were anoyed more at the fact that he
was gay (or at least not your idea of a good looking individual no matter
what orientation he was). ---But that's probably beside the point as you
seem familiar with dancing at gay clubs---.

The point I'm trying to get at is the fact that in a mixed group we will
all sooner or later face this type of behavior and I feel there should be a
proper way to handle each other.
I've never been to "Together" so I do not know if it's a "gay" or "mix"
crowd.  But let's assume that mister X thought he was at a gay club.  Does
it give him the right to be blunt about his sexual advances.  Personnally I
feel that any public encounters should be handle with certain reservations
at first, until a certain understanding has been established.  I love to
dance with anyone (man or woman) and it usually feels great knowing we're
in the same frame of mind.

Keeping Tenderloin Waxx's story in mind, here is a story about an encounter
I had just a few weeks back.  This is a very simple innocent happening but
I still remember it to this day.  I was dancing by myself, in high orbit
with the music, and this guy walks to me.  He tells me a few words and my
natural reaction is to hold him by the waist so I can hear better.  *Very*
abruptly, he pushes both my hands away as if I did something to insult him.
Now he walks away and I'm left to wonder what that was all about.  Was I
staring at him earlier from my high plateau?  Did he think I was making a
gay pass at him?  Never could figure it out.  The point is still respect
and proper communication.  Being secure with oneself and being open to
diversity. (That is a beautiful peaceful picture to me).

>his way, truly amazing.  dude was *not* a raver, as far as I could tell.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that blatant sexual behavior is more
prominent in "clubs" rather than at "raves".

Feed this thread for awhile.
I'm curious about your thoughts on mix club ettiquette.

Fog machines when overused are vile.  I owe a winter of chronic
bronchitis to a fog machine with weird molds growing in the
geletin-based juice.

In case anyone is wondering, I'm working in my new job now and
it's cool.  I got to buy a new wardrobe, too (no more jeans and
Ren & Stimpy t-shirts in the office).

When Judge gets an estimate of how much it would cost to put the 
alley-door into the main room at Komotion, could he let me know?

I love the idea of having a hip-hop DJ at a party.  For a while
in Baltimore they had hip-hop "chill" rooms that we're so chill they
were hot :-).  Also, a few renegades in New Jersey had a DJ that did
a hip-hop set.  It was a really cool change.  I also like the idea
of hearing an industrial/EBM set, too.  I used to get so tranced out
to the likes of Front 242 even before I realized what it was to trance
to music.  Variety yes!

In CH's "Stoned is the way of the Walk":

"Remeber Sister Maggie? Breasts were kind of saggy
' Used to sell me buddha out of fucked up little baggies.
Set me up with ..(?).. even when I had no money,
she said pay me back with some latin dick honey."

Catholic nun selling pot in return for sexual favors.

A note on CH:  There first album was written and produced for black\hispanic
kids in the city, and I tend to believe all the stories.  The second album was
written and produced for white kids in the suburbs, and I think most of those
songs are fantasy.

A few other random thoughts:

Sunset was not quite as good this time.  The kids have found out about it.
Lots of poseurs (ie, kids who have the look but never dance).  I could do
without the obnoxious, self-important meth heads.  (the mello meth heads
are okay).

Fog is just sugar and water, your mucous traps it and moves it pretty
easily.  Smoke is vile chemicals.  Fog does not really bother me, smoke
does.  But hey, I know you are all addicted, so I don't mind too much.
Of course, if anyone wants to fill a room with some *kind* of non-addictive
plant smoke, I wouldn't mind. 

Hope was great after 5:00am, when we got there.  Tribal Funk was fun, but a
bit claustrophobic.

As a dedicated smoker, I think smoke machines are great.  As well as the 
spectacular effects you get with a few lasers, it actually feels as if my 
lungs are being *cleaned* compared to the abuse they normally receive!

Welp, think about it:  it could well have done him a good service.  Prison is
kind of an enforced rehab.  Rehab the hard way.  So in this way, he's right. 
However, the fact is, the prison system sucks anyway, whether you're sending
junkies, pushers, or murederers there.  However, you gotta admit that some
junkies might need a forced rehab to kick the habit... most rehab centers allow
you to opt out if you want to.

I would like to see if anyone out there putting a party together will let me
try out the stuff I've sequenced on my computer on their crowd to see what
kinda reaction I get.  I've composed some spiffy acid trance numbers on my
computer and can put enough stuff seamlessly together for a thirty minute set.

I'm not much for pigeonholes, but the stuff reminds me at times of a
schizophrenic Spicelab or Aphex Twin.

If anyone putting some party together is interested in giving it a listen, drop
me a mailing address and I'll send you a demo.

Besides, I'm really just looking for a reason to leave L.A. for a weekend and
fart about in the Bay Area and this would make a cool excuse.

I too hate those smoke machines.

someone said that the fog doesnt smell as bad
as cigarette smoke, but I beg to differ,
I have never smelled worse than after a party with
one of those things.  My underware, my socks everything
saturated with sticky fog wierdo stuff.  

Plus, Im not a chronic athsma sufferer, I only get
it from super aerobic activity, and never from 
dancing to house music, Except when there is a 
fog machine.  
(A freind with more severe athsma problems has had
to wait outside a club more than once from fog, 
Im sure poor ventilation and cigarettes played a
part, but it was the fog that got him gagging.)

Perhaps it isnt carcenogenic, but still, Im sure
that it cant possibly be good for you.  
I wonder if there is a way to get more info on
what it does consist of, and what it does inside
of you...
does anyone know?
I have always kinda wondered if it was doing me 
any great harm....

I just had to comment on this thread

	From a few of the reports I have heard, quite a few of our 
country's "corrective" facilities are quite infested with the substances 
that could put one in there in the first place. (Where I heard this, I 
have forgotten so I guess you would have to take my word on it) Thus, 
prison does not always constitute forced rehab, nor even forced detox. 
Furthermore, one's environment plays a great role in someone going sober. 
Although a physical addiction may be ended in some prisons by a simple 
lack of the addictive substance, the accompanying mental addiction or 
craving will not necessarily be broken as well.

Don't quote me on this, but someone that worked at Club Oasis in SF a couple
years ago said that most of the "good" fog machines, meaning the ones that
produce thick and dense smoke, use an oil-based fluid that is somehow
transformed into fog.  This oil-based crap is very bad for you, and many of the
employees of the club reported nausea and shortness of breath when the machine
was used consistently.  This is just a second-hand report, but it does
illustrate the point.

Unfortunately, I like fog when used properly with lasers and other light
sources to produce cool and eerie effects but not at the expense of my or
anyone else's health.

I know that dry ice is much better for you, but the drawback is that it is
somewhat dangerous to have around and use regularly, from what I hear.  The
other downside to dry ice is the fog is not quite as dense.

Just my observations and what I've heard...

Looks like we'll be serving up oatmeal Saturday morning at Burning 
Man.  Bring your favorite toppings (and a little to share with
everyone).  Fruit, brown sugar, or what have you.  I'm gonna bring
a little milk to cool the oatmeal down but I can't bring a lot 
because my coolers full.  If anyone else can bring some to contribute
that would be great.  Look for the location info on the Burning Man
community board.  Oh, if you can't bring anything, don't worry, *please* 
come and eat with us anyway.

Take care, and see you soon.

ravnbird sez:

>if you are of different orientation?


IMHO, no-one of any gender or orientation should make overt passes at anyone 
else of any gender or orientation. Putting ur hands on someone's ass ain't 
cool no matter what the situation/orientation is... 

However if ur a straight person and someone gay makes a "gentle pass" at u, 
just say... "sorry, I'm straight". If ur gay, and the person is straight, just
say "sorry, I'm gay"   If ur both of the same orientation u can just say.. "sorry, I'm with someone" ... If they're being nice about it u can also be nice 
about rejecting it :)

If the pass is not a "gentle pass" e.g., some jerk grabs ur ass... then let the
bastard know that u won't tolerate it... 

There's no reason that just because the club is considered "gay" that a guy,
gay or straight, should feel that they have to put up with unwelcome advances!!!
This also applies to straight clubs where women have to put up with shit all
the time.. 

Off the soapbox :)

Smoke machine smoke is vaporized water and glycerine along with other
stuff to keep it from clogging the fog machine. It is non-toxic, and
as far as any research has shown, is not bad for your health.

It is a problem for asthmatics, as is cigarette smoke. Some people
find it annoying, some people really like it. Few people like it when
it's overdone. Lasers and fog are very very cool.

I like the Dust Brothers mix, which I played at F&FIII. Breakbeat with
industrial samples overlaid. I hope to find more stuff like this :).

I don't think it's that simple. In some circumstances, it is
acceptable (and expected) behavior. In others, it is abhorred.
Unfortunately, we have so much diversity in person and venue in the
scene, it's hard to get anyone to agree what the rules are.

I think in any case, if someone indicates a negative, it should be
dropped. But, to play the devil's advocate, where does that leave room
for persuasion? I had a very nice 2 year relationship because I got
persuaded.

Rules? Can we make rules?

Sometime after we wake up, I guess. :)  I'm not sure, really.  
I'm trying to plan this loosely because I don't know what to expect.
I'm just gonna bring oatmeal, water, and a stove and leave the rest
up to everyone else. :)  I wanted to do this more so we'd all have a
chance to meet early in the event and the food is only the catalyst.

Mmmm-mmm-mmm, hot oatmeal on a hot desert day, I can't wait!!!

Take care.

Subject: Raving in an Underground Nuclear Bomb Shelter in Russia

I guess you sf-ravers can't just drive up here for next weekend, but I
thought you might be interested anyway. I just spent Saturday night at the
Tunnel, corner of Lyubansky Pereulok and Zverinskaya Ul in St. Petersburg,
Russia.
The club features trance, house and ambient music in a converted
underground nuclear bomb shelter. The cover charge was 10,000 roubles which
works out to about $8. I couldn't find out who the dj was but the music mix
was quite current. Many people were quite cool (from my cultural
perspective), but there was an interesting contingent of young women
dressed in 'office secretary 1945'. I have a broken leg (rollerblading) so
I danced on one leg there. It ran all night (11am - 6pm) but we
unfortunately we had to leave about 1:30 because we did not have visas and
unless we returned to our ship by 2am we would be fined about 300,000
roubles.
Also, if you happen to be in Helsinki, I recommend the e-club. The cover is
about 20 FIM, and the hours are 9pm to 4am, though no one gets there til
midnight. The address is Mannerheimintie 3, contact Elukka Eskelinen of
PopZoo Productions at +358-40-5010017 for details. It is in some ancient
ornate ballrooms, divided into dance and chill areas and holds about 300
people. The night I was there they had DJs General Njassa and Magic Sam
(Finland) and DJ Mixmaster Morris (UK). Also they had 'Virtual Nightclub'
projected on the wall, a really interesting interactive rave simulation on
Mac CD-Rom from London.

Derek.

When Denis mentioned DV8's upstairs room, it brought back a cool memory.
I remember when that Enigma song got popular, and DV8 had the upstairs
"ballroom" decorated with some ancient Greek (as I recall...) pillars, columns,
and statues.  That room had the "Wall-o-strobe" which when facing it without
fog would be as blinding as the sun!  Anyway, the DJ, someone remarkable, but
the name escapes me, would be playing music, and at the end of a song, he would
dowse the lights, fill the room with fog, then start the Gregorian intro to
that Enigma song.  The room would feel cold almost, even though there were many
people close together.  When the deep bass kicked in, the "Wall-o-strobe" would
kick in as well as the moving overhead lights.  The effect was awesome.

Ahh the good ole days...
(-=mcv=-)

PS:  I guess that means that I like level 4 fog rating, but with an
explanation.  Generally I prefer 3-4 based on the healthful,
for-the-fun-of-it-type fog.

Fog machines do very little for me
In fact, light shows don't do much for me either
They are like black lights - sometimes too bright and
harsh and in your face.  Like everything at a party 
it is cool if escape is possible when desired.
(away from smokers, lights, heat ...)

I like people
lots of beautiful people

If I hit-on a woman like I've been hit-on by men 
I would be slapped.  And "hit-on", to me, is already
a brutish version of something that can be subtle
and exciting.  I don't care where you are I think
you should be respectful.  You are wrong if you
are using your location (club/party) as an excuse
to shortcut dealing with people on an individual
basis.

I wish someone would tell me about Groove Kitchen
This is a party with some history, no?

If not a full blown underground hiphop party then
maybe hiphop to crazy old acid with a clean end   
and fabulous people.  Get down.

I think variety is good, and can work as a theme
unto itself.  Too mixed up can throw me.

Ah, perhaps that's because the mineral oil they use in foggers, is a normally

Besides star alley which also has lots of house/etc., the best
place I know of his soul disco records on 15th & market in San Francisco.
He tends to have alot of underground stuff you'd never hear anywhere
else and you can hear some of the cuts before you buy...

Someone should check there for fliers and send 'em in.   
Maybe ask around about what is out there - almost any
recommendations or tips would be interesting!

Ya know, I'm really tired of all of this empty vapid pathetic Zippie spew
flying into my mbox and using up network bandwidth. Collectively your
purposeless movement has nothing to offer, nothing to say, and has done
absolutely nothing.

>From minute one of your corporate style hype you, as a group, have not 
presented a SINGLE THING in terms of worthwhile words, actions, or 
achievements.

It would be nice if you would crawl back to whatever place you came from
and spew your pathetic drivel at each other instead of US.

According to a friend of mine who works for American Cyanamid, the
"dry fog" is a polymer and is exteremely save (it's been tested
for the usual carcinogenic kinds of things).  "Wet fog" is geletin
based (as in Jell-o) and so isn't carcinogenic as such BUT if people
don't clean out the fog machine weird mold can grow in it which you
could, in turn, inhale.
